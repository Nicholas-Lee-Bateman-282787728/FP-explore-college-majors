All the military action looked so real and the camera-workwas flawless.  As far as the plot is concerned you can read the other reviews since they cover that pretty well.  This film reminded me somuch of Black Hawk Down, and it was just as painful to watch those scenes where our soldiers get hit by enemy bullets, RPGs and grenades.Some reviewers have said that some of the acting was not that great and I agree somewhat.  But I do not consider that to be a deficiency of thefilm since some real Navy SEALS and not professional actors were used to provide the film an authentic look and feel of military maneuversand communications under very hostile conditions.  The plot of the film moves very rapidly and there is almost no irrelevant materialwhich should not be there.  Bullets are flying practically all the time.  Absolutely great entertainment.  On the other hand, because this filmis based on real military experiences (not necessarily the plot sequences in the film), it does serve to show us citizens the hell that our soldiersand their families have to endure to serve their country.  I feel humbled by the real sacrifices which our men and women in uniform have to make.This is a 5-star film and a 5-star honor to our military.

Don't care what others say negative about our arm forces. Your all heros, and I can or do much but a simple thank you.For 2nd is this great journal of soldiers who are out today, battling in the far places from home. It's not a a storey really to me. It's more kinda of a documentary/slice of reality. This men are real men. They have no acting degree, and no real preparation for the big screen. This is their story. They use real weapons, real live ammo and real families.  With that said, their is really not much of a story plot in this. Now on to the features, I got to say, the action scenes are awesome. Now I do warn that their is a part of this movie that might or will be disturbing to viewers. Not for kids, trust me. Now the scene is a woman being kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. They ask her to give them info about her job, and I think you get to were I'm going at if she doesn't tell them. It's pretty disturbing and not something if you do get offended easily. It's an action movie, but it's also a close to reality movie. Past that scene and it get pretty good. Good soundtrack, amazing resolution and just a great movie.Even though it say Blu-Ray, it actually is the DVD, with digital copy and the Blu-Ray DVD. All packed nicely.

Overall, I think the action was a bit too much. Basically, what happened is the story got drowned out in the all that fighting.The story in any case did not make sense, a rich Russian Jewish drug smuggler who is a nasty person who tortures people, is helping an old friend who is somehow related to Chechnya. Why should this drug dealer do something like this is not explained leaving me thinking the story is stupid. Furthermore, his friend is a converted Muslim who for some reason wants to commit terrorism in the U.S. Why? A Chechnyan's enemy is not the US but Russia. Chechnya would see the US as an ally against Russia. Surely, it would make more sense for this plot to become a movie of Russian Seals.Another problem with the story, is that it is obvious from almost as soon as we see the scene with the coming baby which seal will die. As such when he does die, we are robbed of the tragedy as its expected.It is also full of patriotic fever. Which maybe off-putting to some people.The acting varies from very good, for example, Alex Veadov to very poor. Probably, as many of the actors were picked for their ability to do action then their acting ability.The characters because the story is so poor, do not come out well.Overall, this is another story that the writers let us down.Update: Since the Boston bombing, if I wrote this now, I would reconsider my comments about a terrorist from Chechnya wanting to commit terrorism in the U.S.",2,Great action movie but the story is stupid,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,1564,"['***Spoiler', 'Alert**Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'action', 'great', 'main', 'purpose', 'showing', 'off', 'US', 'seals', 'Overall', 'think', 'action', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Basically', 'what', 'happened', 'story', 'got', 'drowned', 'out', 'fighting.The', 'story', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'rich', 'Russian', 'Jewish', 'drug', 'smuggler', 'who', 'nasty', 'person', 'who', 'people', 'helping', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'somehow', 'related', 'Chechnya', 'Why', 'should', 'drug', 'dealer', 'do', 'something', 'not', 'explained', 'leaving', 'thinking', 'story', 'stupid', 'Furthermore', 'friend', 'converted', 'Muslim', 'who', 'reason', 'commit', 'terrorism', 'U.S.', 'Why', 'Chechnyan', 'enemy', 'not', 'US', 'Russia', 'Chechnya', 'would', 'see', 'US', 'ally', 'Russia', 'Surely', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'plot', 'become', 'movie', 'Russian', 'Seals.Another', 'problem', 'story', 'obvious', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'see', 'scene', 'coming', 'baby', 'seal', 'will', 'die', 'such', 'when', 'die', 'are', 'robbed', 'tragedy', 'expected.It', 'also', 'full', 'patriotic', 'fever', 'Which', 'maybe', 'off-putting', 'people.The', 'acting', 'varies', 'very', 'good', 'example', 'Alex', 'Veadov', 'very', 'poor', 'Probably', 'many', 'actors', 'were', 'picked', 'ability', 'do', 'action', 'then', 'acting', 'ability.The', 'characters', 'story', 'so', 'poor', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'well.Overall', 'story', 'writers', 'let', 'down.Update', 'Boston', 'bombing', 'wrote', 'now', 'would', 'reconsider', 'comments', 'terrorist', 'Chechnya', 'wanting', 'commit', 'terrorism', 'U.S']",Act of Valor

The plot feels a lot like a good Tom Clancy story (he was involved in the making of the movie). The acting during the drama scenes was fairly stiff but really came alive when moving into the action scenes, as might be expected.

It is almost like a documentary, but it isn't, but it's entirely realistic. The actors in the fictional movie, based on actual Navy Seals operations, are real life seals and because of that, some of the acting is a little stiff, but on the other hand, because of that, the Seals operations depicted are jaw-dropping realistic.On February 7th, retired Lt. Gen James Vaught confronted Special Ops Commander Adm. Bill McRaven about the recent openness of the Seals tactics following the killing of Bin Laden and in the forefront of the release of this movie. The seals rely on secrecy to prevail. They require anonymity to be who they are. So, does ""Act of Valor"" reveal too much about the tactics of Navy Seals? I would be nave to have an opinion either way, but I do anyway. Navy Seals require all elements of a team working together. One comment in the movie was this, ""One stick can easily be broken, but in a bundle, that stick is strong.""  Seals are the best of the best. If our enemies learn anything from this film, it is that if the Seals are onto you, you better have been trained well.""Act of Valor"" as said to me by a veteran of Vietnam who was sitting nearby in the movie theatre, ""should be required viewing in high schools and college.""  It is plain and simple an inside look of the sacrifice that these elite men do to keep the world safe. There is evil in the world and as much as many try to deny it, it is true and these Navy Seals silently, secretly and without praise, defend us on a regular basis so that we can sleep at night and get up and watch the news and have opinions about what is going on in the world.The bird's eye view inside the Navy Seals is one of a kind and not to be missed. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film. I felt the intensity of the operations first hand, understanding what was at stake and knowing that these men, although it was just a movie, are patriots and comrades to the 9th degree.

1466178,A3E0IFPCA7KKP9,B005LAIGYQ,Christopher J. Martin,"[0, 1]","Act of Valor is an amazing movie. In this movie the SEALs rescue a CIA operative who has been taken hostage. The intelligence information recovered on the rescue sets the SEALs off on a chase to hunt down terrorists who plan to sneak suicide bombers wearing suicide vests that are unable to be seen by metal detectors in to the United States.In addition to the amazingly well done intense action, the movie does give viewers a glimpse of the home life of some of the guys in the unit. The only drawback is that the scenes at home aren't long enough. I cared about the two main characters the movie focuses on but not as much as I would have if the characters lives at home were more well developed. The most emotionally intense scenes come at the end of the movie and made me proud that we have Americans who put their lives on the line every single day to keep this country safe.I found the action scenes very believable. This isn't Rambo type stuff, the movie shows how careful the SEALs operate and try to achieve the goals of the mission with as much stealth and as little risk to American lives as possible. On the other hand, the movie also shows that while special operations teams have access to advanced technology like drones, most of their work still involves them putting their lives on the line in close quarters with the enemy.",4,Great movie!,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",2012,1341,"['Act', 'Valor', 'amazing', 'movie', 'movie', 'SEALs', 'rescue', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'been', 'taken', 'hostage', 'intelligence', 'information', 'recovered', 'rescue', 'SEALs', 'off', 'chase', 'hunt', 'down', 'terrorists', 'who', 'plan', 'sneak', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'wearing', 'suicide', 'vests', 'are', 'unable', 'be', 'seen', 'metal', 'detectors', 'United', 'States.In', 'addition', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'intense', 'action', 'movie', 'give', 'viewers', 'glimpse', 'home', 'life', 'guys', 'unit', 'only', 'drawback', 'scenes', 'home', 'are', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'cared', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'characters', 'home', 'were', 'more', 'well', 'developed', 'most', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'scenes', 'come', 'end', 'movie', 'made', 'proud', 'have', 'Americans', 'who', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'single', 'day', 'keep', 'country', 'action', 'very', 'believable', ""n't"", 'Rambo', 'type', 'stuff', 'movie', 'how', 'careful', 'SEALs', 'operate', 'try', 'achieve', 'goals', 'mission', 'as', 'much', 'stealth', 'as', 'little', 'risk', 'American', 'possible', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'also', 'special', 'operations', 'teams', 'have', 'access', 'advanced', 'technology', 'drones', 'most', 'work', 'still', 'putting', 'lives', 'line', 'close', 'quarters', 'enemy']",Act of Valor

1466180,A27F1WYCM6IEYH,B005LAIGYQ,Colten,"[4, 15]","The fictional action movie Act of Valor is pure propaganda - though not officially produced by the United States Navy, the project rose out of short Navy recruitment films created by co-directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, the success of which led the filmmakers to ask the Navy to use not only real military equipment but also active-duty Navy SEALs in a feature-length narrative film.Act of Valor exists for one purpose: To make the Navy, particularly its elite SEAL teams and their weapons and methods, seem so exciting, cool, and noble that viewers will, if not want to actually sign up, at least come away with an elevated opinion of and support for such military personnel and their country's endeavors. The film reinforces its message with plenty of visceral appeal, drawing both on the excitement and heroism of an action film and an emotional appeal based on the warrior tradition of honor, sacrifice, and brotherhood - all of it underscored by the fact that these are actual SEALs using real tactics and weaponry.As military action entertainment, Act of Valor come with all the contrived premises and plot mechanics of the sub-genre. A Chechen Islamist has teamed with an opportunistic, hedonistic international smuggler to launch a massive suicide-bombing campaign in the United States. The film's elite SEAL team heroes are called forth and sent rushing around the world to thwart the attack. Peppered with military jargon and slang, the action unfolds either with awestruck panoramas of American firepower or from the gun-barrel point of view of a first-person shooter video game.There are several visual moments in Act of Valor that grab - real Navy gunboats laying down a deadly field of fire, a real submarine slowly submerging - but they rely almost wholly on the filmmakers' access to genuine equipment operated by actual sailors rather than any inherent skill from the director. Otherwise, the movie is often a sub-par, uneven effort - for every scene that benefits from the verisimilitude, there are several that suffer from a lack of film-making and story telling skill and a slavish devotion to clich&eacute;. For the most part, McCoy and Waugh rely on an all-too familiar excess of people, places, and things getting shot and/or blown up in big, orange fireballs and then making Big Speeches about the nobility of it all. Beyond the bullets and explosions, Act of Valor's real message is about the bravery and sacrifice of the men and women operating all that cool weaponry, with plenty of solemn talk about codes of honor, tradition, and warrior blood being passed down through the generations. The film's plot and characters remind us, &#34;There are threats everywhere,: therefore America need the man and women and military might and firepower so dazzlingly on display.While Act of Valor's brutal villains are sneeringly played by professional actors, the film's Navy heroes, including its main protagonists &#34;Chief Dave&#34; and &#34;Lieutenant Commander Rorke,&#34; are portrayed by unnamed, real-life &#34;active-duty&#34; SEALs reportedly ordered by the Navy to participate in the film for promotional purposes, despite a prior history of strict operational secrecy. The SEALs are not good actors, and the film's hagiographic context and deferential direction does not allow the sort of naturalism that might have let the non-professional actors come off less stilted. The trade-off for using real SEALs and their to-be-expected lack of acting ability is that no one can accuse Act of Valor of sporting &#34;pretty boy actors playing with guns,&#34; but everything the &#34;real&#34; characters say and do feels heavily filtered through both action-film tropes and the Pentagon's public relations department. As characters, Dave and Rorke are not just good men, but good family men - they have human problems, but no real weaknesses, flaws, or failings. The heroes and the actions of the nation they serve are completely sanitized in the flames of ideology, sacrifice, and honor.While the dramatic interactions in Act of Valor feel as stiffle staged as a 1980s corporate training film, the combat scenes with all their visceral, manipulative power are intended to play at some emotional level as documentary - the film opens with the claim it is &#34;based on real acts of valor&#34; and closes with the names of every Seal killed in action since September 11, 2001. As an action film, Act of Valor may be clunky and clich&eacute;d, but the moments that do work as gut-level entertainment thrills only help sell the propaganda's message. For all the film's &#34;realism&#34; and talk about bravery and protecting America's freedom, this is still a war fantasy, intended to sell combat as a thrillingly dangerous adventure where even those who make the ultimate sacrifice do so in beatific slow motion and a ushered into the hallowed halls of Valhalla, their names and memories draped in honor.",1,"The tricky thing about propaganda is that

1466186,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B005LAIGYQ,CriticNic,"[0, 0]","I'm quick to admit that I love playing first-person shooter video games, as well as watching shoot `em up action flicks. I grew up with Rambo and Medal of Honor. Do I support war or condone acts of violence? No (well, often on the fence about the former). I don't know what it is about hardcore action sprinkled with bloody violence that gives some of us an adrenaline rush, but one thing's for sure is that it doesn't always translate to our real world desires. Where am I going with this and what's the point? The film Act of Valor is an up close and personal dramatized encounter with real-life Navy SEALs, a high body count, and some of the most realistic combat effects I've seen. I enjoyed this film due in great part to the action, as will many viewers of this film, and I don't see why that has to be a bad thing.Don't get me wrong, I, like many people, look for more than cheap thrills with movies. But I see nothing wrong with a nice adrenaline filled action movie from time to time. Act of Valor is a great example of such a film. It's got a fairly standard terrorist-driven storyline, lots of gunplay and tactical action complete with first-person perspectives that put the viewer right in the middle of the action. It's clear that the SEALs weren't trained in classical acting when forced to perform dramatic dialog, which I forgave knowing this fact from the beginning, but in the tactical scenarios it's clear they are the real deal. The SEALs don't give off the presence of hulking action stars, but rather impose a more controlled, modest demeanor.Now I may be making this sound like a no-holds-barred shoot-everything blow-stuff-up flick, but that would do this film injustice. After all, this film is centered around a group of individuals whom represent some of our nations greatest heroes. It is said that the film originally was meant to be a recruitment film for the Navy. Had I seen such a recruitment film when I was in high school, I may be in a different career. Not only does the film depict guys that can kick some serious butt and pull off life-saving missions against incredible odds, but it also shows respectable characters that truly believe in what they are doing and care for their team as they would family while at the same time risking their lives for people they've never met.The film does what many of its kind have a hard time doing, and that is putting meaning behind the action. While the story isn't anything spectacular, the feelings of patriotism, heroism, and camaraderie feel authentic and successfully translate to the real world. In other words, the film doesn't make the gamer inside you want to shoot at the bad guys, but it makes you want to shoot at the bad guys while saving someone's life and perhaps even an entire population. The film also gives the viewer the realization, mainly by casting real life SEALs such as leads Dave and Rorke, that these people are among us everywhere we go. That itself is a pretty big eye-opener.A lot of people are going to hate on this film for being too violent, pro-American, etc. and for it's other faults such as a fairly standard storyline and weak dramatic acting. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course, and in some cases I would agree with some of those opinions. However, I believe that sometimes people are too serious when it comes to movies. Why does one have to agree with everything a movie says or does to enjoy it? While Act of Valor may have set out to enlighten, inspire, and promote, that doesn't mean it has to have those effects on you to appreciate it. I personally welcomed such an authentic feeling action flick packed with purpose that still satisfied the FPS fan inside me.The factors keeping me from calling this a perfect action film would be that I would have loved to have gotten to know the characters outside of combat (perhaps the filmmakers wanted to limit the amount of dramatic acting that would have been required to achieve this?). The film certainly could have used improvement in some of these areas. The choice to cast the real-life SEALs did indeed add that level of authenticity where it counted, but detracted from the overall cinematic quality. Nonetheless, I enjoyed enjoyed Act of Valor and felt like I got a good insight into a very exclusive team that serves our country while simultaneously being entertained.Source: criticnic.com 17-July-2012Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox",4,Solid action from the real deal,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,4434,"[""'m"", 'quick', 'admit', 'love', 'playing', 'first-person', 'shooter', 'video', 'games', 'as', 'well', 'watching', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'action', 'flicks', 'grew', 'up', 'Rambo', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'Do', 'support', 'war', 'condone', 'acts', 'violence', 'well', 'often', 'fence', 'former', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'hardcore', 'action', 'sprinkled', 'bloody', 'violence', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', ""n't"", 'always', 'translate', 'real', 'world', 'desires', 'Where', 'am', 'going', 'point', 'film', 'Act', 'Valor', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'dramatized', 'encounter', 'real-life', 'Navy', 'SEALs', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'most', 'realistic', 'combat', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'due', 'great', 'part', 'action', 'will', 'many', 'viewers', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'be', 'bad', 'thing.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'many', 'people', 'look', 'more', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'movies', 'see', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'nice', 'adrenaline', 'filled', 'action', 'movie', 'time', 'time', 'Act', 'Valor', 'great', 'example', 'film', 'got', 'fairly', 'standard', 'terrorist-driven', 'storyline', 'lots', 'gunplay', 'tactical', 'action', 'complete', 'first-person', 'perspectives', 'put', 'viewer', 'right', 'middle', 'action', 'clear', 'SEALs', 'were', ""n't"", 'trained', 'classical', 'acting', 'when', 'forced', 'perform', 'dramatic', 'dialog', 'forgave', 'knowing', 'fact', 'beginning', 'tactical', 'scenarios', 'clear', 'are', 'real', 'deal', 'SEALs', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'off', 'presence', 'hulking', 'action', 'stars', 'rather', 'impose', 'more', 'controlled', 'modest', 'demeanor.Now', 'may', 'be', 'making', 'sound', 'no-holds-barred', 'shoot-everything', 'blow-stuff-up', 'flick', 'would', 'do', 'film', 'injustice', 'film', 'centered', 'group', 'individuals', 'whom', 'represent', 'nations', 'greatest', 'heroes', 'said', 'film', 'originally', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'recruitment', 'film', 'Navy', 'Had', 'seen', 'recruitment', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'career', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'depict', 'guys', 'can', 'kick', 'serious', 'butt', 'pull', 'off', 'life-saving', 'missions', 'incredible', 'odds', 'also', 'respectable', 'characters', 'truly', 'believe', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'care', 'team', 'would', 'family', 'same', 'time', 'risking', 'lives', 'people', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met.The', 'film', 'what', 'many', 'kind', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'doing', 'putting', 'meaning', 'action', 'story', ""n't"", 'anything', 'spectacular', 'feelings', 'patriotism', 'heroism', 'camaraderie', 'feel', 'authentic', 'successfully', 'translate', 'real', 'world', 'other', 'words', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'gamer', 'want', 'shoot', 'bad', 'guys', 'want', 'shoot', 'bad', 'guys', 'saving', 'someone', 'life', 'perhaps', 'even', 'entire', 'population', 'film', 'also', 'viewer', 'realization', 'mainly', 'casting', 'real', 'life', 'SEALs', 'such', 'leads', 'Dave', 'Rorke', 'people', 'are', 'everywhere', 'go', 'pretty', 'big', 'eye-opener.A', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'violent', 'pro-American', 'etc', 'other', 'faults', 'such', 'fairly', 'standard', 'storyline', 'weak', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'Everyone', 'entitled', 'opinion', 'course', 'cases', 'would', 'agree', 'opinions', 'However', 'believe', 'sometimes', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'serious', 'when', 'movies', 'Why', 'one', 'have', 'agree', 'everything', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'Act', 'Valor', 'may', 'have', 'set', 'out', 'enlighten', 'inspire', 'promote', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'effects', 'appreciate', 'personally', 'welcomed', 'such', 'authentic', 'feeling', 'action', 'flick', 'packed', 'purpose', 'still', 'satisfied', 'FPS', 'fan', 'me.The', 'factors', 'keeping', 'calling', 'perfect', 'action', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'gotten', 'know', 'characters', 'combat', 'perhaps', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'limit', 'amount', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'required', 'achieve', 'film', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'improvement', 'areas', 'choice', 'cast', 'real-life', 'SEALs', 'did', 'indeed', 'add', 'level', 'authenticity', 'where', 'counted', 'detracted', 'overall', 'cinematic', 'quality', 'Nonetheless', 'enjoyed', 'enjoyed', 'Act', 'Valor', 'felt', 'got', 'good', 'insight', 'very', 'exclusive', 'team', 'country', 'simultaneously', 'being', 'entertained.Source', 'criticnic.com', '17-July-2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox']",Act of Valor

I did not go to this movie for the acting, I went to see our real life Navy Seals pay tribute to those who sacrificed everything for our country, and I was not disappointed.I have read several books by Seals and about Seals over the years, starting way back when Dick Marcinko's first book came out, and I always watch any movie or tv special about them.  I feel it takes a special kind of person to do this job and it fascinates me.This movie has a fictional plot; however, the extractions and sacrifices in the movie all have actually happened in the field and they are re enacted in this movie in different locations.  How awesome was it to sit their and watch the things I had imagined in my head in real life.  I say real life, because these are things they actually do, real technology actually used, real split second decisions actually made.  The action was fantastic and I will go see this movie again on the big screen to make sure I caught everything.What was most profound to me was the way the team worked together and their commitment to each other.  The fact that they can see something horrific happen to their best friend, and keep doing their job, put their emotion aside until their mission is done.  I have read in countless books about men that keeping going while wounded not for themselves or to get back home, but so they don't let down the person next to them, the person they go into battle with.  This movie shows that.  It shows these men to be multi faceted.  They are not war mongers.  They are men with families and a deep sense of history and honor.  This is what I feel should be taken away from the movie.So if you are not sure what you are getting into with this movie, they were not shy about head shots and brain splatter, they did not focus on it, it was all done in a very matter of fact way, but it is there.  There is a torture scene that made me squirm, not graphically shown, but you knew what was happening.  Overall though if you have let your child play Grand Theft Auto or 1st person shooter games, this is not any more violent.This movie is not a propaganda or recruiting film it is real life. Remember that when watching, don't look for something to be there for a political reason, as an american look at this film and be proud, appreciative and thankful that we have men like this willing to give everything so that we can be safe.  I for one am, and I was really glad they listed the Seals that sacrificed everything for us at the end.  This movie broke my heart while instilling a huge sense of pride for our servicemen and first responders.  I hope everyone goes to see this movie on the big screen it is worth it.  I don't know but I hope the producers/studio whomever is in charge makes a substantial donation to the Navy Seal Foundation as the men in this movie were not, nor did they want to be compensated.Anyway I will be purchasing this movie as soon as it is available and encourage you to do the same, it is important to know what someone will sacrifice for you.",5,Wow!!!,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3120,"['know', 'people', 'will', 'think', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', '5', 'stars', 'acting', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'movie', 'acting', 'went', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'pay', 'tribute', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'everything', 'country', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.I', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'books', 'Seals', 'Seals', 'years', 'starting', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'Dick', 'Marcinko', 'first', 'book', 'came', 'out', 'always', 'watch', 'movie', 'tv', 'special', 'feel', 'special', 'kind', 'person', 'do', 'job', 'me.This', 'movie', 'fictional', 'plot', 'however', 'extractions', 'sacrifices', 'movie', 'have', 'actually', 'happened', 'field', 'are', 're', 'enacted', 'movie', 'different', 'locations', 'How', 'awesome', 'was', 'sit', 'watch', 'things', 'had', 'imagined', 'head', 'real', 'life', 'say', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'things', 'actually', 'do', 'real', 'technology', 'actually', 'used', 'real', 'split', 'second', 'decisions', 'actually', 'made', 'action', 'was', 'fantastic', 'will', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'big', 'screen', 'make', 'sure', 'caught', 'was', 'most', 'profound', 'was', 'way', 'team', 'worked', 'together', 'commitment', 'other', 'fact', 'can', 'see', 'something', 'horrific', 'happen', 'best', 'friend', 'keep', 'doing', 'job', 'put', 'emotion', 'aside', 'mission', 'done', 'have', 'read', 'countless', 'books', 'men', 'keeping', 'going', 'wounded', 'not', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'person', 'next', 'person', 'go', 'battle', 'movie', 'men', 'be', 'multi', 'faceted', 'are', 'not', 'war', 'mongers', 'are', 'men', 'families', 'deep', 'sense', 'history', 'honor', 'what', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'movie.So', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'shy', 'head', 'shots', 'brain', 'splatter', 'did', 'not', 'focus', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'matter', 'fact', 'way', 'there', 'torture', 'scene', 'made', 'squirm', 'not', 'graphically', 'shown', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'have', 'let', 'child', 'play', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', '1st', 'person', 'shooter', 'games', 'not', 'more', 'violent.This', 'movie', 'not', 'propaganda', 'recruiting', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'Remember', 'when', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'something', 'be', 'there', 'political', 'reason', 'american', 'look', 'film', 'be', 'proud', 'appreciative', 'thankful', 'have', 'men', 'willing', 'give', 'everything', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'safe', 'one', 'am', 'was', 'really', 'glad', 'listed', 'Seals', 'sacrificed', 'everything', 'end', 'movie', 'broke', 'heart', 'instilling', 'huge', 'sense', 'pride', 'servicemen', 'first', 'responders', 'hope', 'everyone', 'see', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'hope', 'producers/studio', 'whomever', 'charge', 'substantial', 'donation', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'Foundation', 'men', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'did', 'want', 'be', 'compensated.Anyway', 'will', 'be', 'purchasing', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'available', 'encourage', 'do', 'same', 'important', 'know', 'what', 'someone', 'will', 'sacrifice']",Act of Valor

Van Court ""Van""","[23, 29]","When the directors worked with the US Navy on a separate project, they dreamed up the idea for an accurate movie about the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) community, they realized that there just weren't actors that could fill the roles.  So they collaborated with the Navy and real NSW personnel to make this movie.A SEAL platoon goes hunting, trying to unravel a skein of drug dealers, arms smugglers, jihadis, a plot to commit atrocities within the borders of the US.  They deploy around the globe in order to stop a massive terrorist act within the US, and at the same time allow a glimpse into the personal lives of these men and their families, and the other service members that support them.As much as a SEAL recruiting film, it seemed like the NSW small boat guys were pitching their career opportunities too, and a cinematic exposition of the tools of NSW.  High altitude, low opening (HALO) parachuting, submarines modified to support SEALs, UAVs, and other equipment was prominently displayed, but it was clear that the equipment was only there to aid the men in their mission, and that no technology would replace their training.  Still, gadget junkies will get a fix with real rather than made-up hardware.  The boat crews, especially, seemed like they enjoyed their work greatly.The most intriguing character, and the most proficient actor of the Navy personnel was Senior Chief, the intelligence analyst/interrogator.  Of all the sailors in the film, he was the one that could be mistaken for a professional actor, but during his interrogation scene, one can understand why his specialty would give him the skills that transfer to performance.  This also made for an interesting subtext; the brutal torture by bad guys failed to get the subject to talk but the professional interrogation by the Navy interrogator broke the subject without the interrogator laying a finger on him.All in all, an excellent action flick.  The quality of acting generally wasn't stellar, but given the tax dollars spent training these men for their disciplines, that can be excused.

I'm a military buff so I've got stuff to watch (the extract early in the film is ridiculous...great nod to the arm of the Seals you never hear about providing support for the main teams of operators). What you've heard is likely true:- There are no Oscar-winning performances here.- There's a solid sense of the simulated range of missions or sub-missions that could unfold in a real-world scenario.- There are a lot of examples of SEAL tactics and equipment (though obviously not enough to expose TOO much).You know who you are and if you should be watching this movie. If you're looking for something well-written and like something Tom Cruise might star in or something along the lines of Band of Brothers (beautiful mini-series by the way) or Saving Private Ryan, please don't bother getting this then coming back here and giving it a bad review. Check out the trivia on IMDB and you'll understand:- This is as much of a recruiting tool for the Navy as America's Army (the game) was for the Army.- The team that plays the main characters in the film were actually assigned to a special public relations unit specifically for this purpose (most Spec Ops operators would never give up their identity if they can help it).- The producers had originally cast the movie with actual actors, the SEAL team being advisers for the film. In the end, the team members felt the actors couldn't represent them properly so they pushed to be the ones on screen.- There are a number of scenes where live ammunition was actually used. They treated it like a (somewhat) standard military exercise.In the end, if you're a military buff, you'll get a kick out of this film. You'll laugh at the attempts at creating some sort of actors out of the SEAL team members but the combination of the action and when the team starts to get hurt, you'll get into it soon enough. The initial extract sequence at the beginning of the film is ridiculous (good ridiculous, not bad). Everyone has a right to their opinions political or otherwise (and are free to leave the political ones out of product reviews) but you can't deny we've got a pretty damned solid military.

NAVY SEALS doesn't hold a candle to ACT OF VALOR. Charlie Sheen would soil himself if thrown in the company of this film's tough as nails cast, a significant chunk of which is comprised of real life active duty U.S. Navy SEALs (whose names, by the way, are left off the credits). ACT OF VALOR is neither as ferociously right wing nor as jingoistic as I've been led to believe. Yes, there are moments which very well may invoke your bump of patriotism. But, mostly, it's a thrilling, well-crafted war picture. It may even recruit a whole new mess of squids.Roselyn S&aacute;nchez is the only recognizable name here. She plays a CIA operative who is abducted while working undercover in Costa Rica. When SEAL Team 7 is deployed on an extraction mission, a terrorist plot concerning multiple attacks on U.S. soil is unearthed.There's no doubting that this cast of Navy Seals is accomplished on many, many fronts. But, understandably, their acting skills aren't so squared away. Still, there's something inherently likable about these elite frogmen, and it's not just because these men are genuine heroes who put their lives on the line every day to protect our butts. The film focuses most on two Seals - Lt. Rorke, who is an expecting father for the first time, and his best friend, a USN Chief who also serves as the (sometimes awkward) voiceover narrator. If there's a closet actor hiding in this bunch of rookie actors, it's the guy who plays the Senior Chief. Of everyone, he flaunts the most personality. One of my favorite scenes has him conducting an interrogation onboard a smuggler's yacht. I love it that he swings down onto the yacht, removes his military gear, and reveals a suit and tie underneath. It's a nice touch.I found it easy enough to overlook the sometimes wooden performances, found it easy to admire their earnestness. All those bonding moments early on - as the Seals and their families gather at the beach just before a black ops - may seem corny and trite, but it cements in my mind how close the team members are and just how much they depend on each other. It's particularly telling that the Chief would advise the others to make sure to straighten out their personal affairs before they all head ""downrange."" Carrying personal baggage into the field of engagement is one sure way to compromise the mission and the men.There are no hotshots on SEAL Team 7, no cocky Charlie Sheens. What they lack in things thespian-y, they more than compensate for with the authenticity they stamp on the screen. These cats move a certain way, behave a certain way. They handle their weaponry with a familiarity born out of hard-earned experience. When the film arrives at those moments fraught with warfare, they look extremely competent and professional. The combat sequences are intense and, at times, visceral. This isn't a documentary, but it at times captures the feel of one. I'm cribbing a quote here: ""ACT OF VALOR is a field manual on current weapons and tactics, a primer on the whys of acts of terrorism, and how SEAL teams and other units are prepared to protect America and Americans from such fanaticism.""One of my favorite poems is Rudyard Kipling's ""If.""

Remember that spectacular demonstration of marksmanship when three of them, standing on a tossing boat, felled three hostage-holding Somali pirates with simultaneous shots? That was followed a year or so later by the end of Osama bin Laden, so these elite fighters are the ones we look to for military prowess.I can only hope this film's regular release contains the introduction by the two principals behind this project. They were embedded with a platoon of Navy SEALs in hopes they would get enough material for a movie. It quickly became obvious to them that there are NO Hollywood actors who could approach the calibre of the men they were with, in terms of fitness, devotion to their families, intelligence, and skill levels. Consequently, they cast a group of active duty SEALs! (Shooting was occasionally delayed while cast members were briefly deployed.) When we know those guys up there on the screen have actually done the things we see, it adds immeasurably to our involvement; plus, many of the scenes were shot using live ammo!The upshot is, even though the Bandido Platoon is a fictitious one, this story is based on feats of the most elite, highly trained group of effective warriors in the modern world, using up-to-the-minute technology under highly challenging circumstances. Because of artistic license, we see the same seven men off the coast of Somalia, in the Ukraine, in the tropical forests of Costa Rica and just south of the Mexican border. They are trying to stop a chilling plot that uses ceramic pellets in suicide vests. Ceramic doesn't set off metal detectors, so terrorists plan a coordinated attack in crowded areas: football games, shopping malls, concert arenas and airports. When explosives kill and maim hundreds, the economic impact will be devastating (like 9/11).This film starts with the rescue of a kidnapped CIA operative, which leads to the terrorists, who are linked to drug cartels in Mexico (they know how to penetrate America's borders). The domino effect of international terrorism and drug trade is compelling stuff. How can the American drug consumer ignore the down-range impact of his or her folly! Expect lots of gunfire, SCUBA diving, some really satisfying blowie uppie stuff, and stealth warfare (when these seven guys silently break the surface of that stream... goosebumps!).I found this far more involving than your average run-of-the-mill action film. It's clear that these guys are SEALs, not actors, but there wasn't a moment when anyone's attention strayed; we were rooting for them to complete their mission so they could all return home to their families.

For example, my friend and I looked at one another as soon as one of the SEAL characters, played by a real SEAL, was revealed to be expecting his first child with his lovely wife, and said, ""He's toast,"" because that has been a cliche of so many war movies for 50 or 60 years at least.One of the keys of great drama is that a movie should make us ""care"" about the characters. We care about these characters -- real Naval personnel and SEALS because we should care -- not because we really care about these characters. We are given ""thumbnail"" sketches of what should have been told another way. For example, one character relates how depressed his ""old man"" was when he realized ""he was no longer dangerous."" What a great opportunity to flash-back to the actual scene and get real impact! Instead, it is related as a second-hand memory and loses what could have been thoughtful character development.Not to disparage the efforts of the SEAL and Naval personnel cast, but I never had enough of any one character to develope a real impression of him (or her). I blame the writer(s) for this or even remember their names. No time was really spent SHOWING US why these men, or any men, become SEALS. No time was spent SHOWING US the real impact this career choice has on their family life. No time was spent telling us what the ""life of a SEAL"" outside of combat is like. For example, how are rotations and assignments handled? No time was spent showing us what makes a man choose SEALS . . .as opposed to Special Forces . . .as opposed to Force Recon Marines.I know from several close friends who have served with or worked with SEALS what the real price these people often pay for their career choice. This is emphatically NOT being in the regular military. As an American, it seems to me that a proper treatment of this important subject would have exposed us to an understanding of what the real cost (not merely paid in blood) is.We get plenty of firefights, plenty of exciting technology in infiltrations and ""exfiltrations"", and plenty of certified-charicature heroes and bad-guys.The most interesting ""bad guy"" was the Russian (Russian bad-guy! What are the odds?) Christos. He could have been a really interesting character with a little development.RECOMMENDATION:(1) If you want to see how real SEALs talk, fight, and serve on missions, by all means see this movie.(2) If you want a real story deeper than a comic book, this will disappoint. I really enjoyed ""The Heart and The Fist"" -- a superb book on what motivated on man to become a SEAL officer.I have a old friend, and two of her sons have become SEALS. I haven't met them or talked to them, but this gave me very little insight into what their lives, other that shooting people, rescuing people, or blowing stuff up, are like.Having read a number of Tom Clancy novels (who USED to be a good storyteller), I am afraid I expected the shortcomings of this movie.",3,More recruiting tool that entertaining story,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,3888,"['First', 'all', 'just', 'movie', 'review', 'watched', 'old', 'friend', 'streaming', 'version', 'One', 'having', 'been', 'military', 'having', 'helped', 'manufacture', 'sell', 'many', 'items', 'went', 'boom', 'movie', 'made', 'interested', 'project', 'were', 'subtitles', 'streaming', 'video', 'having', 'lot', 'familiarity', 'general', 'military', 'jargon', 'subtitles', 'are', 'must', 'are', 'involved', 'special', 'operations', 'DVD', 'not', 'come', 'kind', 'basic', 'jargon', 'translator', 'are', 'just', 'things', 'will', 'keep', 'asking', 'What', 'mean', 'Second', 'film', 'style', 'was', 'largely', 'first-person', 'shooter', 'video', 'game', 'where', 'are', 'looking', 'weapon', 'sites', 'love', 'kind', 'video', 'game', 'love', 'explosions', 'firefights', 'will', 'enjoy', 'large', 'parts', 'movie.SOME', 'SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', 'place', 'where', 'movie', 'bogs', 'down', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'entirely', 'too', 'predictable', 'example', 'friend', 'looked', 'one', 'as', 'soon', 'one', 'SEAL', 'characters', 'played', 'real', 'SEAL', 'was', 'revealed', 'be', 'expecting', 'first', 'child', 'lovely', 'wife', 'said', 'toast', 'been', 'cliche', 'so', 'many', 'war', 'movies', '50', '60', 'years', 'least.One', 'keys', 'great', 'drama', 'movie', 'should', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'care', 'characters', 'real', 'Naval', 'personnel', 'SEALS', 'should', 'care', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'thumbnail', 'sketches', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'way', 'example', 'one', 'character', 'how', 'depressed', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'dangerous', 'What', 'great', 'opportunity', 'flash-back', 'actual', 'scene', 'get', 'real', 'impact', 'Instead', 'related', 'second-hand', 'memory', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'thoughtful', 'character', 'development.Not', 'disparage', 'efforts', 'SEAL', 'Naval', 'personnel', 'cast', 'never', 'had', 'enough', 'one', 'character', 'develope', 'real', 'impression', 'blame', 'writer', 's', 'even', 'remember', 'names', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'spent', 'SHOWING', 'US', 'why', 'men', 'men', 'become', 'SEALS', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'SHOWING', 'US', 'real', 'impact', 'career', 'choice', 'family', 'life', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'telling', 'what', 'life', 'SEAL', 'outside', 'combat', 'example', 'how', 'are', 'rotations', 'assignments', 'handled', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'showing', 'man', 'choose', 'SEALS', '.as', 'opposed', 'Special', 'Forces', '.as', 'opposed', 'Force', 'Recon', 'Marines.I', 'know', 'several', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'served', 'worked', 'SEALS', 'what', 'real', 'price', 'people', 'often', 'pay', 'career', 'choice', 'emphatically', 'NOT', 'being', 'regular', 'military', 'American', 'proper', 'treatment', 'important', 'subject', 'would', 'have', 'exposed', 'understanding', 'what', 'real', 'cost', 'not', 'merely', 'paid', 'blood', 'is.We', 'get', 'plenty', 'firefights', 'plenty', 'exciting', 'technology', 'infiltrations', 'exfiltrations', 'plenty', 'certified-charicature', 'heroes', 'bad-guys.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'Russian', 'Russian', 'bad-guy', 'What', 'are', 'odds', 'Christos', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'interesting', 'character', 'little', 'development.RECOMMENDATION', '1', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'real', 'SEALs', 'talk', 'fight', 'serve', 'missions', 'means', 'see', 'movie', '2', 'want', 'real', 'story', 'deeper', 'comic', 'book', 'will', 'disappoint', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Heart', 'Fist', 'superb', 'book', 'motivated', 'man', 'become', 'SEAL', 'officer.I', 'have', 'old', 'friend', 'two', 'sons', 'have', 'become', 'SEALS', 'have', ""n't"", 'met', 'talked', 'gave', 'very', 'little', 'insight', 'what', 'lives', 'other', 'shooting', 'people', 'rescuing', 'people', 'blowing', 'stuff', 'up', 'are', 'like.Having', 'read', 'number', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'who', 'USED', 'be', 'good', 'storyteller', 'am', 'afraid', 'expected', 'shortcomings', 'movie']",Act of Valor

However 80% of viewers said they ""liked it"" on Rotten Tomatoes. I agree with the non-reviewers.Act of Valor is a great film, that not only tells a solid story but let's us see how Navy Seals actually carry out a mission.The realism comes from the producers, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, spending so much time working closely with the SEALs on a documentary. They respected the SEALs and the United States Navy respected the filmmakers. So a pact was made and Act of Valor became the first film to use actual Navy SEALs as the cast.Members of Bandito Platoon, SEAL Team Seven are at home with their families at the beach. They know their time is limited. Their commander reminds them to get all personal matters out of their minds, and that if he needs to he will meet with their spouse or any family member who they are having a problem. He tells them their minds need to be clear with only the mission at the forefront.Their mission is to extract Morales (Roselyn Sanchz), a CIA'operative, whose partner has been killed and she captured, tortured and most likely, unable to move on her own.The seven man team moved into the jungle after making a successful HALO jump. They decide to enter the compound ahead of time, because they can hear screams coming from Morales. Two provide cover as five do a search by search room-clearing textbook style.

Many of the stars of the movie were active SEALS who portrayed the combat Navy Seals in the movie. The movie is based on real life scenarios but they are formed into a fictional story line. The action and suspense is outstanding and you understand what these soldiers endure in the face of the enemy every day.The SEAL team was so close knit that they knew what the other was going to do before they did it. They based their philosophy on a quote from Tecumseh, ""While a single twig will break, a bundle of twigs are strong."" They were totally focused on the mission and protecting the members of their team.This is a story about the real world and it is graphic in nature. There are some very bloody scenes and some torture done by terrorist. These scenes will get to you so just be prepared.

Sure some of the lines are flat compared to Brad Pitt or someone but isn't that balanced or even made better by having the real people say them?  It's like being mad that real life isn't as idealistically delivered as Hollywood lines.  Sometimes we say flat or cheesy stuff in real life.Second the propaganda angle is also a bit off.  Its simply a film about people of high character doing cool but dangerous stuff and it gives them the credit they deserve.  Its just a pseudo documentary.  It hardly sugar coats anything, no spoilers but bad things happen to bad people and good people in the film.  Maybe a little simplistic for the critics but most people really are a lot simpler than people in ""the movies"" anyway so whats wrong with a film of well-adjusted people now and then.Finally, there is no comparison between this and many of the completely average movies out there.

1466278,A204RDEM9N5N88,B005LAIGYQ,LT. John,"[4, 6]","I remember when the film first came out in theaters, and I was a bit skeptical of how effective this movie was going to be. Our Navy unit had a few SEALs around and they were not talking about it much. As it turns out, it is because almost no one even knew about the movie! Seems like it was an indy-sleeper with very little marketing. After the opening weekend, everyone on base was talking about it!First, the movie presents real people doing their real jobs. Nothing ruins a movie for me than watching some pretty-boy actor, shooting his M4 from the hip and 'capping' bad-guys at 200m. No thanks. I'll take real people any day!OK, so here are the negatives:1)The acting is a trifle 'stiff'. It does remind you that these guys are sailors first and actors second. I am fine with that, but you notice it from time to time. That being said, the only time it is 'stiff' is in the scenes that are non-job related. When the action goes on screen, the flow is very natural. I wish they would have put in some real military banter. Listening to these guys in real life cutting each other up is hilarious! They should have let the SEALs improv some lines here and there!2)There are some holes in the plot,especially if you are expecting a ""Tom Clancy"" experience.Outside of that, the movie rocks!.But, you have to first appreciate what you are watching. You are seeing a modestly exaggerated expose' of the SEALs capabilities. (as compared to the silly-stupid hollywood exaggerations....yes, I mean you, charlie sheen in the 1980's SEAL movie!) Most of what they are doing in Act of Valor is a glimpse into this Spec-war world.The movie is unique in feel and style, and worth a view, even if you are not a military buff. My wife was engrossed in this movie despite the fact that she doesn't ""get"" why we watch all this military ""stuff"".The action is fast and hard. Even the sentimental parts are well done in the context of the movie.I also should mention that this movie is the only pro-military movie out there right now. It means a lot to the military community to be seen as good-guys doing a hard job. Whenever Matt Damon comes out with another of his movies where he preaches (and distorts) about the military, he is not looking for sailors and soldiers to watch it.Now, how about Act of Valor 2???",5,A great new Genre of film!,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,2298,"['remember', 'when', 'film', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'was', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'how', 'effective', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Navy', 'unit', 'had', 'few', 'SEALs', 'were', 'not', 'talking', 'much', 'out', 'almost', 'one', 'even', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'indy-sleeper', 'very', 'little', 'marketing', 'opening', 'weekend', 'everyone', 'base', 'was', 'talking', 'First', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'doing', 'real', 'jobs', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'watching', 'pretty-boy', 'actor', 'shooting', 'M4', 'hip', ""'capping"", 'bad-guys', '200m', 'thanks', ""'ll"", 'take', 'real', 'people', 'day', 'OK', 'here', 'are', 'negatives:1', 'acting', 'trifle', ""'stiff"", 'remind', 'guys', 'are', 'sailors', 'first', 'actors', 'second', 'am', 'fine', 'notice', 'time', 'time', 'being', 'said', 'only', 'time', ""'stiff"", 'scenes', 'are', 'non-job', 'related', 'When', 'action', 'screen', 'flow', 'very', 'natural', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'real', 'military', 'banter', 'Listening', 'guys', 'real', 'life', 'cutting', 'other', 'up', 'hilarious', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'SEALs', 'improv', 'lines', 'here', 'there', '2', 'are', 'holes', 'plot', 'especially', 'are', 'expecting', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'experience.Outside', 'movie', '.But', 'have', 'first', 'appreciate', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'are', 'seeing', 'modestly', 'exaggerated', 'expose', 'SEALs', 'capabilities', 'compared', 'silly-stupid', 'hollywood', 'exaggerations', '.yes', 'mean', 'charlie', 'sheen', '1980', 'SEAL', 'movie', 'Most', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Act', 'Valor', 'glimpse', 'Spec-war', 'world.The', 'movie', 'unique', 'feel', 'style', 'view', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'military', 'buff', 'wife', 'was', 'engrossed', 'movie', 'fact', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'watch', 'military', 'stuff', '.The', 'action', 'fast', 'hard', 'Even', 'sentimental', 'parts', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'context', 'movie.I', 'also', 'should', 'mention', 'movie', 'only', 'pro-military', 'movie', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'lot', 'military', 'community', 'be', 'seen', 'good-guys', 'doing', 'hard', 'job', 'Whenever', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'out', 'movies', 'where', 'distorts', 'military', 'not', 'looking', 'sailors', 'soldiers', 'watch', 'it.Now', 'how', 'Act', 'Valor', '2']",Act of Valor

1466280,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B005LAIGYQ,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I really wanted to love this film about US Navy SEALs, but I was ultimately slightly disappointed and below, I will try to explain more in detail why it happened. This review contains some limited SPOILERS.To begin with the good stuff, the action scenes in this film were VERY good. There are three major fights in ""Act of valor"" and they are really impressive, filmed in a way as realistic as possible, in a style reminding a little of ""Blackhawk down"". Absolutely nothing to criticize there.Although not an expert on the military things, considering that US Navy closely collaborated in making of this film ans some real ex-Navy SEALs played in it, I believe that the description of weapons, equipments, vehicles and tactics was as close to the reality as it was possible without revealing too much of professional secrets - and indeed, this film has a feeling of ""real stuff"". Once again, nothing to criticize here.I also agree with the ideology of this film and its martial message. There are indeed evil people out there who either want to make money of other people's suffering (like drug traffickers) or want to murder other people just because they do not share their beliefs (like islamic extremists) - and if their threat becomes too serious to ignore they must be taken out (killed or captured) by those who defend civilized societies, which means mostly professional soldiers and spies. Period.However, even with all the above, I didn't enjoy this film as much as I hoped, mostly because of a very weak scenario. Without revealing too much, I must however say that all the intelligence aspects of this film seemed to be expedited in the fastest possible way - whereas in the real world intelligence gathering is an excruciatingly difficult and time consuming task.Also, for the life of me I can not understand why the criminals (weapons and drug traffickers) were so eager to join with terrorists in the plot against United States. Money is earned to be enjoyed and if one is dead, his fortune is of no use - and being part of a really huge terrorist attack against the world leading superpower offers poor prospects of survival.Finally I rather didn't like the fact that the leading villain was a Russian converted to islam and connected to Chechnyan rebels - in the real world, Chechen guerillas, even the most extremist, never targeted US interests. Also, maybe by an excess of precautions, no bad guys from radical islamic organisation are Arabs but instead they are all Moros from southern Philippines.Considering that most of SEALs are played by real ex-SEALs and not by actors, it is hardly fair to criticize their acting and anyway it is not so bad. But there can be no excuses for the scenarist who wrote the dialogs, which are so atrociously boring that in the second part of the film I really hoped that somebody will start shooting, just to not hear them anymore. I ultimately fast forwarded some conversations just because the great final raid.The ending, on another hand, was pretty moving and I fully agree with its message - we must be grateful to those who labour, suffer and risk their lives so we, simple citizens, can enjoy our life and freedom without fear.I do not regret that I bought and watched this film, but I definitely didn't enjoy it as much as ""Blackhawk down"" and I do not think I will keep my DVD. Still, it is worth to be watched once, for the great action scenes.

This is a fictionalized film, these events really did not happen but they are based on events that have happened to SEALS since the war on terrorism. In 2007 the two directors of this film, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, worked on a film project where the navy allowed them to work with real Navy SEALS. The directors came out with an idea to make a realistic movie based on the Navy SEALS. While deciding on casting they decided that the only people they wanted playing the Seals were the Seals they met themselves. Act of Valor uses real Navy SEALS and at times real ammunition in some of the fire fight scenes.If you have not seen this film I definitely recommend to at least rent it. It is not a documentary but it is the most realistic military movie that I have seen. Definitely worth a viewing.Some Spoilers:A CIA operative is captured by a drug smuggler. SEAL Team 7 is sent in to save her. SEAL Team 7 discovers the Drug smuggler is connected to a high level terrorist that seeks vengeance on America.

1466300,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005LAIGYQ,M. Oleson,"[6, 12]","There may be spoilers.From what I've read co-directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh were given uncommon access to military knowhow and technology, specifically the U. S. Navy SEALs.  Their original goal was to produce a quasi-documentary/recruiting film.  That evolved into a full length commercial film.  From that perspective I suspect they hit their mark.  There are some unusual aspects to this movie.  With some obvious exceptions, the primary cast is made up of real life active SEALs.  It is pretty clear they are not actors but I'm inclined to give them plenty of slack in that area.  I doubt real actors could have delivered some of the combat lingo and battle maneuvers like the real deal either.SEAL Team 7 is assigned a mission to rescue a kidnapped CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez, TV's ""Without a Trace"") from terrorists located in Costa Rica.  She had been close to uncovering a jihadist plot to infiltrate the U. S. from Mexico.  In a bit of a sticking point, prior to their departure the filmmakers spend an unusual amount of time showing the men with their families so that we know they are just regular guys.  They have wives and kids.  You know just guys no different than any other neighbor.  It was a little much.What isn't overdone are the action sequences.  They are absolutely thrilling.  I was especially taken with the initial mission to rescue Agent Morales (Sanchez).  This involved parachuting in at night, navigating through the jungle and swamp and taking out the capturers with machine-like precision.  The first-person-video-game-like helmet-cam brought a snicker at first but it isn't overdone.  In a heart-pounding escape, the team is overwhelmed with bad guys, but is also aided by swift boats dropped into the river by huge helicopters.  So cool.  The bad guys have some big guns, but so does the Navy and they know how to use them.  Subsequently, a retrieved Blackberry leads the commanders to uncover details about the bigger plot.Working with a Russian smuggler, a Chechnya terrorist has lined up 16 Philippine suicide bombers to wear vests filled with explosive ceramic ball bearings and ignite them in various U. S. cities.  As the mission continues, the SEAL Team takes out half the terrorists in one location but must move near the U. S. border in Mexicali to prevent the remainder from tunneling in under the protection of the local drug cartel.  Working with their Mexican counterparts this final battle will have many casualties including some good guys.  I must admit I loved the action sequences in this movie, but the screenplay is a clunker.  Frankly it is irrelevant.  This is the best military recruiting film since ""Top Gun"" and even with its flaws is worth seeing.BLU RAY UPDATE (6-10-14)This second viewing on Blu ray provides reinforcement on some of my initial comments.  The film purposely is one-sided but I knew that from the beginning.  And I have to say, the best part are the action sequences, especially the first rescue of the captured CIA officer.  As the bad guys are about to outgun the escaping SEALs, they run into 2 swift boats armed with .50 cal. machine guns.  Game over.  Regardless of one's political beliefs, this is an adrenaline inducing scene.  On to the Blu ray disc itself.The video has a 1080p resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Using small digital cameras, the filmmaker's you-are-there feel comes across beautifully in this transfer.  Colors and skin tones are perfect.  Jungle greens and desert tans come across accurately.  In some of the night sequences, you might find a bit of visual noise but it's not distracting.  With a non-stop action flick like this you would hope to get a solid audio track.  And boy do you.  It comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it's a stunner.  The viewer is caught in the middle of the constant action sequences and the sound onslaught is everywhere.  Surprisingly, at least to me, the film has an excellent musical score thanks to Nathan Furst and it plays well when the scenes call for it.  Top shelf, demo quality audio.

It's appalling how this film advances the Russian propaganda of framing the resistance in Chechnya as the terrorists, while the systematic violence of the Russian government that Chechnya's people have suffered is ignoredA Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches from Chechnya.  It's exactly the same manipulation that takes place here in the U.S., where our long history of state violence is ignored, while the blowback is totally removed from the context in which it takes placeBlood and Oil.  Chalmers Johnson, a veteran of the Korean war himself, wrote the classic book on the topic of selective outrage and how governments have a blind spot a mile wideBlowback, Second Edition: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire.Another one-star reviewer made a good point about the military cultism he saw in this film.  I imagine that reviewer, like so many people here in the U.S., doesn't have access to much independent analysis (like the radio show, 'Democracy Now!') that further confirms his point.  Most of our elite establishment media feeds the cult-like idolization of the military; but, here and there, a person can find resources that expose the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us aboutThe Complex: How the Military Invades Our Everyday Lives (American Empire Project).  Eisenhower also warned us about how the military complex would affect our spiritual lives as well.  His warning, and the workings of the warfare state, are brilliantly presented in the film,Why We Fight.We desperately need to stop the Big Government and Big Business collusion that is bankrupting our country through the endless waste, fraud and abuse of Pentagon spending; and end the suffering caused by our perpetual warfare.  Our best defense, and the best way for citizens to act in a valorous way, is to seek honest critiques of war-mongering and the propaganda that makes it possible.

1466325,AUDW8J8GH0IDO,B005LAIGYQ,"ReAgent 6 ""Mixed media: movies, music and wha...","[2, 8]","An elite SEAL team is tasked with recovering a captured CIA agent. They stumble across intelligence which leads them on an international man-hunt for a terrorist who is plotting strikes within the US.The movie overall has a tough job of walking the line between being action-packed and realistic. The film uses active/real Navy SEALs, which causes a small hit in the acting department. Lines are delivered like real human beings having a conversation and not with over the top drama like most war movies- even in combat they get on with soldiering and never have that hysterical ""Oh no, what do we do now?!"" moment. It's like we are an invited guest overhearing the military briefings and are eavesdropping in on intimate conversations with the team members. This works out well as it builds a sense of intimacy between us; the viewing audience, and the SEALs.Act of Valor follows many real military protocols and it was nice to hear the proper and more correct use of the phrase `Frag-Out' as opposed to ""Fire in the Hole"", which is used in most movies. They took a few liberties by showing the SEALs acting without air support for several of their missions and having this single unit deployed for the entire movie -on missions spanning the globe. I guess we don't have that many SEALs after all- maybe fitting since they do say ""Damn Few"". To explain the limited use of Air Calvary, one officer explained that they did not want another ""Blackhawk Down"" and so it was boots on the ground for the entire mission. Nice reference.The Video Game ConnectionMany other reviews are calling this movie an Army Recruitment commercial. I didn't see that at all. I felt a sense of pride for our armed forces and took a second look at the kinds of sacrifices our men and women are asked to make as part of their service. Top Gun was the kind of movie that made you want to fly a jet by the end. Hell, they started putting recruitment booths outside the theaters when that movie hit full momentum. Act of Valor made me want to play a game like Call of Duty or anything where I get to rush buildings and shoot terrorists. They even placed the camera at the top of the barrel like a first-person shooter in many of the action sequences. So I'm already saying I'm surprised this movie doesn't tie in to a video game. Seems like an obvious opportunity.Extra Points Awarded for avoiding these clich&eacute;s ...1) One dimensional Characters. Each member of the Seal team was somewhat similar to each other and were all normal men. This eliminates broad character extremes like `The Angry/Gung-ho Soldier', `The Jokester', and `The Coward'. The Stern/Stoic Captain, `The Sensitive Journal Keeper', `The A-hole (who always lives), The Goodie (who dies) and `The Psycho'.2) The leader or captain who cares more about the men than the mission. *Probably not the guy you'd put in charge of a mission where saving his soldiers would mean the death of many more, usually including his men eventually.3) The General or commander who cares more about the mission than the soldiers, even when his disregard for their lives actually jeopardizes the mission.4) One super soldier killing an incredible amount of enemies- especially if he's about to die and also Act of Valor avoided weapons with unlimited ammo.5) Jar-head soldiers who only care about killing and getting laid. For once, it's not the girl back home; it's the wife and children back home. That adds a whole new dimension to what's being sacrificed by simply being active- way beyond just living and dying on a mission.6) Cursing to be `realistic'. There are professionals who have respect and a high regard for all the other branches so there was no slight to the other branches and the language was relatively clean.The AtmosphereThe soundtrack and sound effects are a highlight in this movie. I saw Drive by Nicolas Winding Refn starring Ryan Gosling and felt like the movie grabbed my stomach and wouldn't let it go until the end. I had a similar feeling with Act of Valor due to its near-perfect pacing and tense and suspenseful atmosphere. Side note: That great rap song used in the trailer does not appear in the movie (unless it's tacked on at the end of the credits) nor does it seem to be on the soundtrack. And from what I understand the soundtrack is comprised of country music. Surprising- since the instrumental music and incidental tones in the movie were epic and orchestral in nature.Politics is a small issue in Act of Valor. The burden of the bad guy falls on two characters. A smuggler names Christo and the old-school Jihad terrorist, Abu Shabal. The Russian Christo is given a bit of humanity by showing that he has some sensibility and sensitivity. The main terrorist Shabal is pretty much an animal for all intents and purposes and we never find out why or how he got to be that way (do you really care? Didn't think so). If you have strong feelings either way about US overseas policy, you know whether or not you should be seeing this film. Aside from that, it's not the job of any SEAL to figure out just how evil or justified the bad guy is. For most movies, you can put a names and faces on the enemy soldiers to let us know that war is bad and there are real people on the other end of those guns. Terrorists will not get any such treatment so do not include that as poor character development as a criticism of Act of Valor.Overall, I enjoyed Act of valor and would recommend it to anyone who wants to a solid action movie that's heavy on the realism. If you want to see a more dramatic focus on the individual then I recommend The Hurt Locker. If you want to see more of a documentary, I suggest Restrepo.",4,Act of Valor Movie Review,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,5673,"['elite', 'SEAL', 'team', 'tasked', 'recovering', 'captured', 'CIA',

1466326,A16GM9G38VTJMV,B005LAIGYQ,RedConOne,"[1, 2]","Act of Valor is a fantastic movie that uses real tactics and equipment, It started out as a short recruitment film until they realized they could make it a full length feature film. Unlike most Hollywood films this movie is mostly live fire oppose to blank firing guns or flash paper guns. The rifles are real and the bullets are real and the film is great it was certainly refreshing to see that all the vehicles and equipment was real. This film is probably the closest you will get to seeing what SEALs do without going and joining their elite ranks. The plot is very simple: The SEALs are trying to stop a madman. I would certainly like to address a something many people and critics complained about...the acting. Yeah the acting did lack slightly but you have to remember these guys are SEALs not actors. Their trained to be warriors not actors so yeah i expect the lines to be a little forced and uncomfortable. But you know what? no actor could do the combat scenes as well as the real deal did. Because just as SEALs aren't trained to act, actors are not trained in combat tactics. While actors are trained in basic things before starting a war movie quite often their IA (Immediate Action: what a warrior is trained to do when fired upon) is lacking and unsatisfactory. Actors don't have the smoothness like the real SEALs which all comes down to its what SEALs have been trained for.Overall the acting in my opinion doesn't make the movie lack at all. I think far too many people are getting spoiled with these movies that come out nowadays with intense acting and complex plots (such as inception). The slight awkwardness in the SEALs acting is more than offset by the intense action scenes and the realism of the film and its equipment. This film is a must have for military members/vets/military buffs/guys who want to become SEALs/ or your action junky who likes war movies.The realism wins this film many points in my book.5/5 Stars Outstanding action packed adrenaline ride that puts you next to one of our finest fighting forces.",5,Outstanding Film,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,2047,"['Act', 'Valor', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'real', 'tactics', 'equipment', 'started', 'out', 'short', 'recruitment', 'film', 'realized', 'could', 'make', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'movie', 'mostly', 'live', 'fire', 'oppose', 'blank', 'firing', 'guns', 'flash', 'paper', 'guns', 'rifles', 'are', 'real', 'bullets', 'are', 'real', 'film', 'great', 'was', 'certainly', 'refreshing', 'see', 'vehicles', 'equipment', 'was', 'real', 'film', 'probably', 'closest', 'will', 'get', 'seeing', 'what', 'SEALs', 'do', 'going', 'joining', 'elite', 'ranks', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'SEALs', 'are', 'trying', 'stop', 'madman', 'would', 'certainly', 'address', 'something', 'many', 'people', 'critics', 'complained', 'acting', 'Yeah', 'acting', 'did', 'lack', 'slightly', 'have', 'remember', 'guys', 'are', 'SEALs', 'not', 'actors', 'trained', 'be', 'warriors', 'not', 'actors', 'yeah', 'i', 'expect', 'lines', 'be', 'little', 'forced', 'uncomfortable', 'know', 'what', 'actor', 'could', 'do', 'combat', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'deal', 'did', 'just', 'SEALs', 'are', ""n't"", 'trained', 'act', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'trained', 'combat', 'tactics', 'actors', 'are', 'trained', 'basic', 'things', 'starting', 'war', 'movie', 'quite', 'often', 'IA', 'Immediate', 'Action', 'what', 'warrior', 'trained', 'do', 'when', 'fired', 'lacking', 'unsatisfactory', 'Actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'smoothness', 'real', 'SEALs', 'down', 'what', 'SEALs', 'have', 'been', 'trained', 'acting', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'lack', 'think', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'spoiled', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'nowadays', 'intense', 'acting', 'complex', 'plots', 'such', 'inception', 'slight', 'awkwardness', 'SEALs', 'acting', 'more', 'offset', 'intense', 'action', 'scenes', 'realism', 'film', 'equipment', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'military', 'members/vets/military', 'buffs/guys', 'who', 'want', 'become', 'SEALs/', 'action', 'junky', 'who', 'war', 'movies.The', 'realism', 'film', 'many', 'points', 'book.5/5', 'Stars', 'Outstanding', 'action', 'packed', 'adrenaline', 'ride', 'next', 'one', 'finest', 'fighting', 'forces']",Act of Valor

The film was technically well made and it was very interesting to see a new perspective on how the SEAL teams communicate and depend on one another, but I think the effect would have been much more powerful had the tone of the film stayed within a documentary or ultra-realistic style. When the characters stopped and tried to act like ""actors"" and not just like themselves, it really shocked me out of the environment I am sure the director intended for the audience. There are moments, especially during the action portions of the film, where I can really sense what the director wanted and it works really well, but then we cut to an unneeded dramatic scene in order to up the tension and life doesn't happen that way. The real SEAL team members don't get to peak into the motivations of their targets the way the audience gets to, I felt I was cheating in places. I wanted to see ONLY what the SEAL team members would have, somewhat like Paranormal activity was filmed. Perhaps it was my own fault for expecting too much or expecting what I would have done with the film instead, but that's that.While I disagree with most of the dramatic choices the director made in an effort to sell the film to audiences, I appreciate the chance that was taken on this film, though overall poorly executed in my opinion.

I was shocked and angered at the stupid, moronic reactions to the movie and that so many had given it a low rating.It seems like this was driven by people thinking the acting was bad which is absurd. There is no weakness in the acting. It is solid from beginning to end and one could name many hollywood blockbusters that acting inferior to this film.It also seems like these negative reviews are driven by hollywood elitist movie critics who were trying to read allot of political messages into the movie and saw it as propaganda or a recruiting film. This shows a complete and utter misunderstanding of the movie. The movie was motivated by a sense of patriotism and the desire to honor the men and women who serve at the most elite levels of the military. But it seems many people cannot see that. Such patriotism is lost on them.Situations like these continue to reinforce the weakening of my faith in humanity and society today.People have had such absurd reactions to this movie. It just makes me angry. These negative, bizarre off the wall reaction seem quite prevalent among many people and it's just disgusting.But anyway, back to the movie. It is a realistic, well directed depiction of Navy Seals and the roles they play. It was amazing to see how mobile they are and the advanced technology they use when deploying or extracting from operations. I think some people can't comprehend the realism of the movie because it is not a unrealistic free-wheeling, hyper-active hollywood film that do quite forceful things to stir peoples emotions.The realism of combat is as absolute as you can get in a movie. The action is portrayed how it would actually occur. Perhaps some people don't know what to do with this. They can't handle the truth or don't want to.But for any level headed person with even ounce of patriotism and a tolerance for action, this movie should be very enjoyable and moving.A great movie with a noble message.

So on Friday night we didBattleshipand on Saturday we did Act of Valor. And what a difference! With one you get suckered by stupidness and with the other you get captivated by awesomeness.Director Peter Berg recently did an excellent superhero movie with Will Smith calledHancock. So when I saw that Berg would be at the helm of Hasbro's Battleship, based on the trailers, I thought we'd get a cool military movie that focused on the Navy and how it would handle an alien invasion. However, what Berg delivered with Battleship was a hokey, corny, unrealistic dud. I almost walked out of my own home theater.On the other hand, fledgling Directors Mike McCoy & Scott Waugh come up with the unique concept of casting a group of real Navy SEALs in a story about fighting terrorists, and they deliver a powerful, realistic, emotional thrill ride of a military film.So if we break out some of the important elements of both films, let's see how they fare against each other:Battleship Story: 1 star - A cool Sci-fi/military concept turned into silliness by goofball, slow-moving side stories and disastrous attempts at humor.Act of Valor Story: 5 stars - A serious, action packed military film based on true events of the heroism of US soldiers that have to rescue an abducted op and take out a terrorist.Battleship Acting Talent: 2 stars - Taylor Kitsch (John Carter), Alexander Skarsgrd (True Blood) and Rihanna (Really? Rihanna???) corn up the screen with unbelievable portrayals of men and women who fight for our country.Act of Valor Acting Talent: 5 stars - U.S. Navy SEALs and U.S. Navy Special Warfare Combatant Crewmen show audiences their stripes and make you think that your watching real life Black Ops events captured on camera.Battleship Action: 3 stars - When the actors aren't hamming up the screen, the action is not bad, but unfortunately there's way too much hamming up the screen.Act of Valor Action: 5 stars - Even the short amount of time at the beginning of the movie that is spent introducing you to the heroes that will star in the film moves along due to the underlying tone of something big about to happen.

1466378,A256QKS1DIQ54U,B005LAIGYQ,T. Bollinger,"[6, 24]","Solid action is not enough to even out the distractingly bad acting delivered from the active duty Navy Seals, here. Moreover, the script comes across as merely standard-issue, a Call of Duty-like action flick. Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are good and appropriately violent, but everything in between the shooting is a jumbled mess of paper-thin characters, awful dialogue, and a confusing plot. In short, our Navy Seals deserved a better film than this -- and should have stayed far, far away from acting.First off, trying to sell this film on its use of active-duty SEALs comes across as really shallow and overly commercialized -- a desperate attempt for attention when the marketers know they don't have a script worth selling in the slightest. If `Act of Valor' managed to actually use its real life heroes effectively for more than just thirty-five minutes of the movie, I might have felt inclined to overlook the laughable final product that was made. But, alas, such was not the case. The Seals look appropriately badass and effective when the action's going, and some of the scenes are pretty tense. When things slow down, though, the film becomes a flat, boring, disaster.You have to understand that as an action film, the reason why films like `Die Hard' and `Aliens' and `Hard-Boiled' and `The Raid' worked was that, besides just having cool action (and all the set pieces of those examples easily overshadowed the zeniths of `Valor's best action), all of those movies were successful, or, ""good,"" because they made things interesting when people/aliens were not getting shot, stabbed, or otherwise blown apart. If your badass commando flick has a bunch of kick-ass shootouts, but everything in between is a boring piece of crap, then your film is not really that badass is it? It just becomes a bunch of disjointed scenes of random violence with nothing to connect them or make them feel really important. As movies, those types of projects are failures. And to that end, you can't just make an hour and forty minute action scene, 'cause then you're stuck with a situation like `Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,' where the audience gets exhausted less than halfway through the movie. You see, there needs to be some kind of acceptable, underlying narrative underneath those festivals of violence, so that the action set pieces can build on one another, and the experience as a whole is a lot more entertaining and enjoyable. It doesn't have to be much, but you need some reason to care about why all that stuff is getting blown up. For instance, `The Raid' took literally five minutes to establish that its main character, Rama (Uwais), had a pregnant wife who was expecting her child, and everything after that was pure violence interspersed with intense sequences of cat-and-mouse games. The plot and developments are nice and simple, yet effective.In `Act of Valor' an eerily similar situation is set up right from the beginning, but unlike in `The Raid' you don't care about the main characters, you don't care about the pregnant wife, and you couldn't care less about anything that goes on in between all the shooting. Why? Because every line of dialogue the SEALs utter is delivered in such a terrible, monotonous way, it's embarrassing. Where as `The Raid' kept everything nice and simple with minimal dialogue and nail-biting hideouts, with `Act of Valor,' we have to sit through one long, boring conversation after another, over and over, before the credits roll. Gosh, the dialogue is so cheesy and artificial, and the protagonists deliver it in such fake and staged ways, that I could not stop myself from laughing constantly whenever people weren't shooting each other. It is quite acutely on the same level as Jake Lloyd reciting his lines word-for-word in `The Phantom Menace.' That's all that people are doing in this movie -- reciting lines.The plot is hopelessly boring and cliched, and there is nothing to keep you interested in the slower moments of the plot, and no reason why you should care about any of the characters or anything that's at stake. It is literally a handful of action scenes intermixed with a bunch of nobody-shooting-anything scenes. This is not a movie. It is a glorified, overly long recruitment video for the US Navy. Look, I think I've made it clear how much I love the USA (and if not, please allow me to direct your attention to `One Last Stand for Uncle Sam' in the ""Main Articles"" section), but come on people, this level of jingoism and childishly simplistic portrayal of terrorism and war is...well, laughable. Haven't we all known that war is not 100% black-and-white since we first watched `Platoon?' This thing might have been watchable if the plot had been communicated better than not at all. All I remember from the ""story"" is that some terrorist bad guys were gonna do some bad things because they were bad. Yes, I was paying attention, but no, nothing in the plot was interesting or coherent. The storyline was confusing and I had no idea what the hell was going on. Of course, I didn't really care, because the characters we were supposedly rooting for (the ones with American flags on their sleeves) were nothing more than a bunch of cardboard cutouts.Essentially, films like `Act of Valor' sell themselves on their cliched, artificial patriotism and ""authenticity,"" and rely on droves of passionately patriotic and/or Call of Duty fans to come flocking to the theatres at the promise of seeing OHMYGAWDREALNAVYSEALSINAMOVIETHISISGONNABEAWESOME!!!! Or something like that. I think people need to realize that action films using ""real-life"" military tactics with either trained professional athletes (`The Raid') or veteran actors (many, many war films) is not that uncommon, so the promise of seeing REAL-LIFE Navy SEALs enacting REAL-LIFE maneuvers is not that big of a deal in the slightest. Furthermore, none of that really matters if the REAL-LIFE military personnel can't act. How are we supposed to be invested in the action scenes if the REAL-LIFE characters in them don't act like REAL people? `Act of Valor' selling itself on the showcasing of active-duty Navy SEALs in its cast was nothing more than a dirty, sleazy, marketing gimmick. But hey, it worked!---------------------------------------------------------------------SCORE: 3/10+ Action scenes are intense and fun to watch.- The dialogue and acting from the main cast are horrendous. If you wanna see an hour and fifteen minutes of people who can't act, reciting lines with blank expressions on their faces, interspersed with some REAL-LIFE military action, this is the film for you. On the plus side, those boring, talking scenes are darn funny.- The script is incoherent and confusing; various story elements and devices are cliched and cheap, banking on jingoism and ""authenticity"" to sell what can laughably be called a plot.- Did I already mention how bad the dialogue is?? Why the hell would anyone in their right minds pay $10 to see this lazy mess when can just rent a great war film for like $2? Heck, if you want realistic war scenarios, watch `Saving Private Ryan.'

1466381,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B005LAIGYQ,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[10, 16]","""Act of Valor"" is an action picture with a difference:  It features actual Navy SEALS in staged scenes of what they have been trained to do.  In the wake of the SEALS' successful assassination of Osama bin-Laden, the movie seems equally a recruiting video and a gripping drama of men under pressure who never lose their cool and always stay focused on a mission's goal.The plot concerns a SEAL team doing its part to save the United States and its citizens from international bad guys.  It takes the team from one exploit to another, often showing in minute detail how well coordinated team members are and how it is often necessary to communicate silently when discovery could mean death.  Team members are referred to only by their first names, such as Lt. Commander Rorke and Special Warfare Operative Dave.  The rest of the cast are actors.The villains are broadly drawn -- Mexican drug cartel members, Chechnyan crime kings, and a drug smuggler turned jihadist.  They don't quite twirl their mustaches and scowl at the camera, but directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh aren't exactly subtle.  They actually appear at the beginning of the film, claiming its authenticity and warning of its no-holds-barred images.  Whether to hype the picture or give it a documentary feel, their appearance seems contrived.""Act of Valor"" has the look and feel of any number of World War II movies.  We get to know the principals as they engage in gun battles and covert missions, and they are portrayed as almost supermen in their ability to read, outthink, and outshoot their enemies.Blu-ray extras include interviews with each of the Navy SEALS, deleted scenes, directors' commentary, and several featurettes including a making-of documentary and a look at the tactics employed by Navy SEALS.

1466388,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B005LAIGYQ,Todd Smith,"[0, 1]","Act of Valor is a refreshingly new and ambitious idea, that takes the stories of active U.S. Marines and turns them into one big story, which is then played out by the very Marines who experienced them. I loved the concept, but this film falls way short of expectations. I believe the purpose of military is the service and protection of our nation, but in Act of Valor the Marines are portrayed as trigger happy Americans. We see the Marines, following up on CIA Intel, going into four different foreign countries, shooting first and asking questions later. Is this really the image of our military that we want to portray to the rest of the world? Regardless of what's real and what's not, these Marines come off as ruthless, with an attitude of 'we're American, we'll do what we want.' As expected, the action scenes were some of the best and most realistic I've ever seen. I would except nothing less, being that the film features men who have been in actual combat and know what it looks like. The acting, also as excepted, was really awful, but for the first time in the twenty month history of this blog I won't blame the actors for it, since after all, they aren't really actors. The action sequences alone more than make up for the bad acting job, but again, I have a real problem with the message this film is sending out to the world.

After a CIA agent is kidnapped there is only one group that can get her out. The US Navy Seals are sent in to extract her. Along the way they discover a threat to the United States and are sent to stop that as well. I will save you from my every war movie is compared to ""Saving Private Ryan"" speech again because you probably can say it yourself now. I will say that the evolution of war movies is interesting though. The 70's started with movies like ""Green Berets"" which is pretty tame and went to ""Full Metal Jacket"" which got a little more graphic. Then movies like ""Platoon"" came out which changed the way they were made, more internal struggle mixed with realistic war scenes. That was the norm until ""Saving Private Ryan"". The hand-held camera feel and the as-if-you-were-there realism really raised the bar and was continued with ""We Were Soldiers"". Since then the genre has had some hits and misses but nothing really amazing since. Then this movie comes out. Rather then a full review of this I will just say that you NEED to watch this. Words can not to this justice. The fact that real seals are used in this makes the movie that much more impressive and realistic feeling. The things that they do would be unbelievable if it wasn't what they actually do. I can go on and on about this but if you have to watch one war movie in your life then make it this one. Overall, amazing and intense. One of the best movies of the year. After watching this you will feel more pride and respect for the US military then you already had.

1466392,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005LAIGYQ,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[28, 87]","In 2007, around the time that Act of Valor was first being kicked around by the Navy, the military was experiencing the lowest recruitment levels in their history. It was so bad, that within a few months they would be lowering the entrance standards to historic levels. Something had to be done, and since they already had directors Scott Waugh and Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy on the payroll shooting recruitment vids, it made sense to use their talents in what would essentially be a feature length commercial that would feature real military grade equipment and active duty Navy Seals.It's not the worst idea in the world. John Ford made propaganda movies for the military during WWII. Although Act of Valor probably would have disappeared into the dustbin of movie history if not for the arrival of Seal Team 6 into the national consciousness. Their high profile capture and disposal of Osama Bin Laden had every studio clamoring for a movie on the prized military unit, and in June of 2011 Relativity bought the rights to Act of Valor for a whopping sum, especially when you figure there isn't a single big name star attached.With all that build up, Act of Valor digs itself into a pretty deep hole right off the bat, with the directors explaining to us in detail just how authentic their movie is compared to others. To their mind, and that of the Navy apparently, no actor can adequately carry out the physical and emotion tolls. Their movie is different than everybody else's. A perfectly fine position to take if actors were being asked to actually go to war. But as it turns out, soldiers can't carry the emotional and physical tolls of...well, acting. Even worse, McCoy and Waugh prove themselves to be exactly what they claim not to be in the beginning, which is just another pair of Hollywood directors pulling the exact same stunts. What's the difference between these two and the Crank duo of Neveldine/Taylor? Oh, Neveldine/Taylor have a signature style, that's what. McCoy and Waugh look like they studied at the Peter Berg School for Michael Bay Imitators.The story actually kicks off with an unsettling bang, with a suicide bomber in Jakarta using an ice cream truck to lure dozens of children into the blast radius. Confidence that we may be privy to a more realistic, less glamorized approach is bolstered by the matter-of-fact nature of this disturbing scene. The incident is the tip of the iceberg, of course, with a deep cover agent(Roselyn Sanchez) investigating the terrorists beaten and taken hostage, forcing the United States to call in the heavy hitting Navy Seals for a snatch 'n grab operation that soon explodes into a full on war against terror.It's at this point we're introduced to the brave men(no skirts on this squad!) we'll be following for the course of the film, mostly through some terribly dry and plodding narration giving us the most basic introduction to the team as possible. Part of the reason could be to emphasize the unit rather than the individual, which is understandable, but that idea is nixed with the stilted attempt to show a close-knit and deeply personal bond between Dave and Lieutenant Rorke. We see the entire unit and their families hanging out on the beach, the men saying tearful good byes to their families before deployment on this dangerous mission. Using the soldiers and their real life families proves to be a major mistake for a number of reasons, but the most significant is that it's hard even for the most well trained actor to play themselves. In an instance like this, what we get are soldiers and their wives acting out how they wish to be portrayed, rather than just being natural. It comes off as stiff and resoundingly inauthentic.All the while this is being backed by the narrator, making vague allusions to bravery, honor, and courage. Great ideals to uphold, certainly, but the guy reading it sounds like somebody forgot to remove the bolts from his head. It's just macho talk with little substance behind it, a warrior code that you might find draped on the tunnel leading onto a football field, or screamed into a boxer's face between rounds. It sounds good, and hits all the patriotic buttons, but not much else. Frankly, it sounds like something out of Zack Snyder's 300, so it shouldn't be a surprise to know the script comes from that Spartan flick's writer, Kurt Johnstad. Nuance and subtlety haven't entered into his playbook over the last five years, apparently.Succeeding in it's primary objective most completely during the film's biggest action set piece, where the actual live fire from the military grade armaments is put to jaw dropping use as the team mounts a watery rescue mission. Waugh and McCoy set the action up beautifully, revelling in the thousands of spent bullet shells booming from the hydrofoil's cannon. This leads to a crazy, high speed chase that shows the directors will make some great action movies in the future. Great Hollywood style action movies. The rest of the film spits in the face of their supposed realism yet again, as splattery head shots are all too frequent, seen in a video game style first-person shooter perspective that we've seen numerous times before. There's nothing new here, and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, when you make the claim that we're about to experience something totally outside the realm of Hollywood filmmaking, you ought to back that up. Right?Act of Valor is going to be a polarizing film, though, as some will bend themselves into a pretzel to defend it and it's heroic stars. On the way out of the attended screening, a colleague in the same breath categorized the film as being the most realistic military move he had ever seen and it was totally like Call of Duty.  What?  The truth lies somewhere in between. The genuine hardware does add a little something extra, but the bad acting, generic direction, and the filmmaker's outright arrogance does the movie no favors. Waugh and McCoy can pump their chests all they like over using real soldiers to re-enact what soldiers do, but who cares if they fail miserably at presenting a cohesive story? This is a movie, after all, right? Best leave it to the professionals.",2,"Real soldiers in a completely unrealistic, Hollywood military film",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,6181,"['2007', 'time', 'Act', 'Valor', 'was', 'first',

What if you depict events in that war starring the brave individuals who are actually fighting it? Crazy, right? But crazy enough to work?The film opens with voice-over of a man reading the always heart-wrenching last letter. Later we're introduced to two CIA operatives deep inside an organization with ties to terrorists. Lisa Morales (played by Roselyn Sanchez) and Walter Ross (played by Nestor Serrano) are acting as aid workers in a small town in Mexico while investigating the town's benefactor, commonly referred to as Christo. Christo (played by Alex Veadov) is a smuggler with ties to a Muslim extremist by the name of Abu Shabal (played by Jason Cottle). When Morales and Ross (Sanchez and Serrano) are discovered, Ross is killed and Morales is kidnapped and held hostage so that she can be tortured for information. Once those in authority discover signs of a struggle in Morales' residence, a crew of Navy SEALs is called in to perform a rescue mission. Revealing any additional details would give away too much of the story.Now, having only seen the film once, character names and story arcs are kind of a blur. Also, as the names of the lead ""actors"" in this film are being withheld for security reasons, any praise or criticism of any particular cast member is pointless.

Casting active-duty Navy SEALs to play themselves (as well as several professional actors including Roselyn Sanchez as supports), directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh have created an action film that is deeply flawed but still worth watching for its authentic combat scenes.The story goes like this. A Navy SEALs team led by Lieutenant Rorke (played by LCDR Rorke) is sent on a covert mission to rescue an abducted CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez). In the course of accomplishing the mission they stumble upon a secret that involves an international smuggler and some packages.""Act of Valor"" benefits from the great combat sequences that are intense and authentic, and the fine photography that helps raise the tension.

The filmmakers know this is an action movie, and ""Act of Valor"" delivers.But I did find the script by Kurt Johnstad thin and clich&eacute;d, with too many expository dialogues and underwritten characters.

There's a lot of criticism of the acting and a lot of talk that the guys were emotionless, but I don't think people realize how realistic this was.  I think the guys showed emotion the way they actually do, because it's them, being themselves.  I realize people have become used to these amazing dramatic renderings of emotion as portrayed by professional actors, and yes, those portrayals are more polished and less awkward to watch.However, having served many years myself and having worked, on occasion, with spec ops guys in both the Army and Navy, I can tell you that the way they are in real life is not perfect emotional rendering.  They actually have to shut it down, and that is pretty much what it looks like from the outside.  These guys are great at what they do, but what they do is not acting.  I've been around some pretty intense operational moments, farewells before deployment, etc., and it doesn't look like what you would expect it to.  There is a lot of awkwardness, a lot of stuffed emotions. And operators in the spec ops world ARE absolutely, ridiculously calm (some might say emotionless) in extremely intense situations. For real.  It's NOT Hollywood.  It's also not some fabulously beautiful man baring his soul and letting you see just how much he's going to miss you.  It's things only his wife would know that show how he feels, but it doesn't look like what you'd expect necessarily.The scenes when they are planning the ops seem a little stilted, but not as much as you would think.  Dialogue in these meetings doesn't go down like something from one of the Bourne movies.  People don't actually talk like that in real life.  I think this was so authentic and honest, and people are so conditioned to seeing the cinematic version of events, they don't stop to think:  have I ever had a conversation at work or with my significant other that sounded that perfectly timed, that cool, whatever?  Nope.  Not really.  Not only that, the action is all real, and a lot of the bullets are real, and for people who don't get how intense and incredible that is, there's nothing anyone could possibly say to you to give you the proper perspective.  You'd have to go to a live range and live it for yourself.  It's a great movie, precisely because it's so real. I have no idea what all the negativity is about.People need to get this:  the reason we haven't had another 9/11 since 2001 ISN'T because there haven't been any more attempts.  It's because our military has been on watch and prevented them.  Doing just exactly the kinds of things you see in the movie.  And how they come off as actors is irrelevant.  I saw a review online that said the acting was so bad, the SEALs deserved better, to show them as they really are.  I laughed.  These guys ARE showing you how they really are, it's just not as set perfect as everyone wants to believe.  They had daily input into the script, and wouldn't say a line if it wasn't something they'd actually say.  The review also had issues with the interrogator, which I thought was also funny, because the interrogator is the real deal, and that is what he does, and how he does it, for a living, every day.  How many people has the reviewer seen interrogated in real life, I wonder?I imagine everyone whose real story has been brought to film has felt inside like they really looked good with that actress or actor portraying them, because they know it wasn't that polished in real life.  This is the real deal.  All those who are anti-military and who love to hate what the military does are going to find fault with this movie because it is completely unapologetic and it doesn't try to be Hollywood.  It shows you just how much our guys have to do to neutralize threats.  These are also the people who want to believe that threats only exist if we provoke them, and they would be terrified if they knew just how many bad guys are plotting against us every day, and would happily dispense with any of us in reaching their goals, in the most horrifying and gruesome ways possible.  Anyone who is caught up in grading the quality of acting from an artistic and theatrical perspective will also be disappointed, but if you can let yourself in on the secret that this is very much how things go down in the real world, you might actually enjoy it.  The filmmaking is outstanding and the story is a fictional portrayal of a real-world situation that absolutely COULD happen.  This movie rocks, and I salute the film makers and especially men who made it, as well as all their brothers and sisters in arms.  I am proud to have served with you.",5,Outstanding movie,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,4659,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'loved', 'lot', 'criticism', 'acting', 'lot', 'talk', 'guys', 'were', 'emotionless', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'realize', 'how', 'realistic', 'was', 'think', 'guys', 'showed', 'way', 'actually', 'do', 'being', 'realize', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'used', 'amazing', 'dramatic', 'renderings', 'emotion', 'portrayed', 'professional', 'actors', 'yes', 'portrayals', 'are', 'more', 'polished', 'less', 'awkward', 'watch.However', 'having', 'served', 'many', 'years', 'having', 'worked', 'occasion', 'spec', 'ops', 'guys', 'Army', 'Navy', 'can', 'tell', 'way', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'perfect', 'emotional', 'rendering', 'actually', 'have', 'shut', 'down', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'outside', 'guys', 'are', 'great', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pretty', 'intense', 'operational', 'moments', 'farewells', 'deployment', 'etc.', ""n't"", 'look', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'lot', 'awkwardness', 'lot', 'stuffed', 'emotions', 'operators', 'spec', 'world', 'ARE', 'absolutely', 'ridiculously', 'calm', 'might', 'say', 'emotionless', 'extremely', 'intense', 'situations', 'real', 'NOT', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'not', 'fabulously', 'beautiful', 'man', 'baring', 'soul', 'letting', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'going', 'miss', 'things', 'only', 'wife', 'would', 'know', 'show', 'how', ""n't"", 'look', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'necessarily.The', 'scenes', 'when', 'are', 'planning', 'ops', 'seem', 'little', 'stilted', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'think', 'Dialogue', 'meetings', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'something', 'one', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'talk', 'real', 'life', 'think', 'was', 'so', 'authentic', 'honest', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'conditioned', 'seeing', 'cinematic', 'version', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'conversation', 'work', 'significant', 'other', 'sounded', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'cool', 'Nope', 'Not', 'really', 'Not', 'only', 'action', 'real', 'lot', 'bullets', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'intense', 'incredible', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'could', 'possibly', 'say', 'give', 'proper', 'perspective', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'live', 'range', 'live', 'great', 'movie', 'precisely', 'so', 'real', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'negativity', 'about.People', 'need', 'get', 'reason', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', '9/11', '2001', 'IS', ""N'T"", 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'more', 'attempts', 'military', 'been', 'watch', 'prevented', 'Doing', 'just', 'exactly', 'kinds', 'things', 'see', 'movie', 'how', 'come', 'off', 'actors', 'irrelevant', 'saw', 'review', 'online', 'said', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'SEALs', 'deserved', 'better', 'show', 'really', 'are', 'laughed', 'guys', 'ARE', 'showing', 'how', 'really', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'set', 'perfect', 'everyone', 'believe', 'had', 'daily', 'input', 'script', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'line', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', ""'d"", 'actually', 'say', 'review', 'also', 'had', 'issues', 'interrogator', 'thought', 'was', 'also', 'funny', 'interrogator', 'real', 'deal', 'what', 'how', 'living', 'day', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'reviewer', 'seen', 'interrogated', 'real', 'life', 'wonder', 'imagine', 'everyone', 'real', 'story', 'been', 'brought', 'film', 'felt', 'really', 'looked', 'good', 'actress', 'actor', 'portraying', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'polished', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'deal', 'who', 'are', 'anti-military', 'who', 'love', 'hate', 'what', 'military', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'fault', 'movie', 'completely', 'unapologetic', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'guys', 'have', 'do', 'neutralize', 'threats', 'are', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'believe', 'only', 'exist', 'provoke', 'would', 'be', 'terrified', 'knew', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'plotting', 'day', 'would', 'happily', 'dispense', 'reaching', 'goals', 'most', 'horrifying', 'gruesome', 'ways', 'possible', 'Anyone', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'grading', 'quality', 'acting', 'artistic', 'theatrical', 'perspective', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'can', 'let', 'secret', 'very', 'much', 'how', 'things', 'go', 'down', 'real', 'world', 'might', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'filmmaking', 'outstanding', 'story', 'fictional', 'portrayal', 'real-world', 'situation', 'absolutely', 'COULD', 'happen', 'movie', 'salute', 'film', 'makers', 'especially', 'men', 'who', 'made', 'as', 'well', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'arms', 'am', 'proud', 'have', 'served']",Act of Valor

The film is inspired by true events and combines excellent combat sequences using the latest battlefield technology resulting in a true to life action film for the ultimate action/adventure movie fan.The film focuses on a SEAL Team and shows the secretive world of these elite and highly trained soldiers. In a story of global anti-terrorism, Act of Valor takes audiences deep into the kidnapping and rescue of a CIA operative, which reveals the discovery of a deadly terrorist plot against the US. The SEAL team is then dispatched on a race against time manhunt, to prevent the terrorist attack.There has been some talk about the quality of the acting, but take into account who is playing the main characters, then this is not a movie about acting, if we can believe that professional footballers and wrestlers can play soldiers then why can't we let real Navy Seals show us how its done!
