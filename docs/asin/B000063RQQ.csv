695808,A3M8H644ON5FQD,B000063RQQ,Amazon Customer,"[66, 68]","There's a moment early on in John Carney's ""On The Edge"" that serves to self-assuredly define itself as the alternative to the tired, Hollywoodized coming-of-age genre. In a scene between Jonathan (Cillian Murphy) and his psychologist (Stephen Rea), a chidingly defiant Murphy declares there won't be any ""Good Will Hunting"" moments between doctor and patient. True to his word as the movie is true to its central point about the fragility and the value of life, there aren't any. And the result is quite simply a breath of fresh air.I won't bore you with plot points because I don't believe any self-respecting movie review should (hello Mr. Ebert). And anyway, like most good movies, ""On The Edge"" is the kind that should be watched with as little knowledge of the plot as possible so as to make its charm and impact that much more...charming and impactful.Cillian Murphy (of ""28 Days Later"" fame) delivers a subtle, understated but no less brilliant performance as a young man quietly grappling with his fate, slowly coming to terms with the value and importance of his own life.The script, often quirky and with a sometimes oddly upbeat feel for a movie that could have come off as an extreme downer, leaves plenty of room inbetween the lines for supporting actors Tricia Vessey and Jonathan Jackson to flex their more than capable acting muscles. Superlative acting vet Stephen Rea (""The Crying Game"") is perfectly cast as a psychologist with baggage that's never so much stated as it is implied in his countenance.But it's Cillian Murphy that carries the movie with the effortlessness of ease, and a presence and ability that belies his years. Seeing Murphy at work, it's easy to forget you're watching a movie, and I can't recall a time that I've been more moved or captivated by the depth of emotion and compassion expressed by an actor in a mere reaction shot. It's downright fascinating to watch him steal scenes without uttering a word or twitching a muscle. But thief he is, whether he knows it or not, and it's one of the many things that adds an extra notch of respectability to a movie already rife with it.No less miraculous and awe-inspiring is director John Carney, who in addition to co-writing the script also scored the original music and sang lead vocal on the final song--something I haven't heard of being done since Sylvester Stallone crooned the theme song for his directorial debut ""Paradise Alley"" back when he was still respectable.""On The Edge"", although quite possibly a bit too emotionally heavy to watch time and time again, is without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen this year and is definitely worth a viewing.",5,"Surprisingly good, moving and effective",1059609600,"07 31, 2003",2003,2656,"['moment', 'early', 'John', 'Carney', 'Edge', 'self-assuredly', 'define', 'alternative', 'tired', 'Hollywoodized', 'coming-of-age', 'genre', 'scene', 'Jonathan', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'psychologist', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'chidingly', 'defiant', 'Murphy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'moments', 'doctor', 'patient', 'True', 'word', 'movie', 'true', 'central', 'point', 'fragility', 'value', 'life', 'are', ""n't"", 'result', 'quite', 'simply', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'plot', 'points', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'self-respecting', 'movie', 'review', 'should', 'hello', 'Mr.', 'Ebert', 'anyway', 'most', 'good', 'movies', 'Edge', 'kind', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'as', 'little', 'knowledge', 'plot', 'possible', 'so', 'make', 'charm', 'impact', 'much', 'more', 'charming', 'impactful.Cillian', 'Murphy', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'fame', 'subtle', 'understated', 'less', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'young', 'man', 'quietly', 'grappling', 'fate', 'slowly', 'coming', 'terms', 'value', 'importance', 'own', 'life.The', 'script', 'often', 'quirky', 'sometimes', 'oddly', 'upbeat', 'feel', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'extreme', 'downer', 'plenty', 'room', 'lines', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Tricia', 'Vessey', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'flex', 'more', 'capable', 'acting', 'muscles', 'Superlative', 'acting', 'vet', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Crying', 'Game', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'psychologist', 'baggage', 'never', 'so', 'much', 'stated', 'implied', 'countenance.But', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'movie', 'effortlessness', 'ease', 'presence', 'ability', 'years', 'Seeing', 'Murphy', 'work', 'easy', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'time', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'moved', 'captivated', 'depth', 'emotion', 'compassion', 'expressed', 'actor', 'mere', 'reaction', 'shot', 'downright', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'steal', 'scenes', 'uttering', 'word', 'twitching', 'muscle', 'thief', 'not', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'extra', 'notch', 'respectability', 'movie', 'already', 'it.No', 'miraculous', 'awe-inspiring', 'director', 'John', 'Carney', 'who', 'addition', 'co-writing', 'script', 'also', 'scored', 'original', 'music', 'sang', 'lead', 'vocal', 'final', 'song', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'being', 'done', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'crooned', 'theme', 'song', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Paradise', 'Alley', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'respectable', 'Edge', 'quite', 'possibly', 'bit', 'too', 'emotionally', 'heavy', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing']",On the Edge

While I never got the impression that the main character (a young teenage boy) was about to commit suicide, or shown any signs of commiting suicide (besides that car ride scene) his character was nonetheless quite impressive and very moving throughout the movie.  While at the psychiatric hospital, he met a girl he fell in love with instantly, and he quickly found out why she was in the hospital too (which is what makes the movie so good).He also met other people who he seemed to get along with quite well, though throughout the film he had a psychiatrist trying to help him, though honestly, I never got the impression the boy even needed help.  He seemed more like a regular kid with a few problems that could have easily been solved just by having someone get close to him and talk, and sending him to a mental hospital was a bit extreme.  That's the impression I got throughout the film because for the most part, his character was quite normal.His acting was really good though.  You cared about which direction his life was taking whenever he encountered that girl, and you wanted to see what happened when he was about to get into major fights with people at bars or bowling alleys.

695813,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B000063RQQ,K.T. May,"[1, 1]","Every once in a while, a film comes along with a common subject that is fashioned differently and feels like a breath of fresh air. 2001 Irish film  ""On the Edge"" is one of these movies.The adorable Cillian Murphy, (Batman Begins), stars as Jonathan, a young man with a carefree, non-committal attitude towards life.  He has just lost his father and, after a night of debauchery, tries to commit suicide by driving his car off of a cliff with his father's ashes in the back seat.  Keeping with the light humor displayed throughout the story, though, Jonathan lives and his only wound is a broken pinky finger.  Because he tried to kill himself, he is offered the choice of a prison sentence or admission to a mental hospital.  He chooses the mental hospital.At the hospital, which Jonathan clearly states he is treating as a vacation and nothing more, he is coached along by a psychologist, Dr. Figure, played by Stephen Rea, who ends up helping him deeply despite his first impression of the doctor.  Jonathan attends a group therapy session and ends up making friends with Toby, (Jonathan Jackson), another young man with a dark secret and Rachel, (Tricia Vassey), whom Jonathan immediately fancies but who creeps him out a bit with her turn-on of blood.Over the course of the film, you can see how the bonds between these three people are deepened, with Dr. Figure fleshing out the picture and helping Jonathan despite his protests.  Toby harbors a crush on Rachel, which becomes more apparent when he writes a poem for her.  Jonathan defends Toby when he almost ends up in a violent fight at a bowling alley and Jonathan almost ends up paying for it.  This will be the first time that Dr. Figure steps in an tries to teach Jonathan that he needs to start valuing his own life, too.  Jonathan will learn that lesson by the end of the film, though, when his love for Rachel grows and, after a tragic circumstance, her parents take her out of the hospital.  Jonathan is miserable and worried and in the end, Dr. Figure helps him to achieve the one thing he desparately needs to do.The acting in this film is rich, especially from Jonathan Jackson who is an American actor but flew to Ireland to make this film and took on the accent in an uncanny fashion.  Cillian Murphy is excellent as always, as is Stephen Rea, and the story is interesting enough to keep your attention.  It is sort of like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" meets a young adult drama, but without a lot of the melodramatic acting that usually comes along with it.  Plus, the soundtrack is a nice boost, starting out right up front with ""1979"" by the Smashing Pumpkins and includes ""Alright"" by Supergrass, ""Please Forgive Me"" by David Gray, and ""Is She Weird?"" by the Pixies, among other great songs.If you were impressed with Cillian Murphy's performance as the Scarecrow in Batman Begins, you should definitely check out this film.  And even if you have no idea who he is, this is a charming film that takes place in psycho-therapy but doesn't make the whole film about that concept.  It is more of a focus on human behavior and relationships and what leads us to do what we do.",4,"We've all been ""on the edge"" at times...",1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,3152,"['once', 'while', 'film', 'along', 'common', 'subject', 'fashioned', 'differently', 'feels', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', '2001', 'Irish', 'film', 'Edge', 'one', 'movies.The', 'adorable', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Jonathan', 'young', 'man', 'carefree', 'non-committal', 'attitude', 'towards', 'life', 'just', 'lost', 'father', 'night', 'debauchery', 'tries', 'commit', 'suicide', 'driving', 'car', 'cliff', 'father', 'ashes', 'back', 'seat', 'Keeping', 'light', 'humor', 'displayed', 'story', 'Jonathan', 'only', 'wound', 'broken', 'pinky', 'finger', 'tried', 'kill', 'offered', 'choice', 'prison', 'sentence', 'admission', 'mental', 'hospital', 'mental', 'hospital.At', 'hospital', 'Jonathan', 'clearly', 'treating', 'vacation', 'nothing', 'more', 'coached', 'psychologist', 'Dr', 'Figure', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'who', 'up', 'helping', 'deeply', 'first', 'impression', 'doctor', 'Jonathan', 'group', 'therapy', 'session', 'up', 'making', 'friends', 'Toby', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'young', 'man', 'dark', 'secret', 'Rachel', 'Tricia', 'Vassey', 'whom', 'Jonathan', 'immediately', 'fancies', 'who', 'creeps', 'out', 'bit', 'turn-on', 'blood.Over', 'course', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'bonds', 'three', 'people', 'are', 'deepened', 'Dr', 'Figure', 'fleshing', 'out', 'picture', 'helping', 'Jonathan', 'protests', 'Toby', 'crush', 'Rachel', 'more', 'apparent', 'when', 'poem', 'Jonathan', 'Toby', 'when', 'almost', 'up', 'violent', 'fight', 'bowling', 'alley', 'Jonathan', 'almost', 'up', 'paying', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'Dr', 'Figure', 'tries', 'teach', 'Jonathan', 'start', 'valuing', 'own', 'life', 'too', 'Jonathan', 'will', 'learn', 'lesson', 'end', 'film', 'though', 'when', 'love', 'Rachel', 'grows', 'tragic', 'circumstance', 'parents', 'take', 'out', 'hospital', 'Jonathan', 'miserable', 'worried', 'end', 'Dr', 'Figure', 'achieve', 'one', 'thing', 'desparately', 'do.The', 'acting', 'film', 'rich', 'especially', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'who', 'American', 'actor', 'flew', 'Ireland', 'make', 'film', 'took', 'accent', 'uncanny', 'fashion', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'excellent', 'always', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'story', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention', 'sort', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'young', 'adult', 'drama', 'lot', 'melodramatic', 'acting', 'usually', 'soundtrack', 'nice', 'boost', 'starting', 'out', 'right', 'up', 'front', '1979', 'Smashing', 'Pumpkins', 'Alright', 'Supergrass', 'Please', 'Forgive', 'Me', 'David', 'Gray', 'Weird', 'Pixies', 'other', 'great', 'songs.If', 'were', 'impressed', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'performance', 'Scarecrow', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'even', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'charming', 'film', 'place', 'psycho-therapy', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'film', 'concept', 'more', 'focus', 'human', 'behavior', 'relationships', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'do']",On the Edge
