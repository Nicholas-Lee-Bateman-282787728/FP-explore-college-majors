I felt as though I was in my teens again.  The songs are great, Olivia looked and sounded fantastic.  The only thing that I was disappointed about then and now is that when she sings You're the One that I Want (from Grease), it is not with John Travolta.  The guy that she sings it with is just ok but I don't care for him too much.  Specifically, not for that song.  He's talented but he's not John.  This is a great DVD, however, the subtitles can get a bit annoying.  Fortunately, I have been able to look past them.",5,Olivia at her best!!,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,649,"['saw', 'concert', 'tv', 'when', 'was', 'teens', 'huge', 'ONJ', 'loved', 'adult', 'watching', 'DVD', 'still', 'love', 'felt', 'was', 'teens', 'again', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'Olivia', 'looked', 'sounded', 'fantastic', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'disappointed', 'then', 'now', 'when', ""'re"", 'One', 'Want', 'Grease', 'not', 'John', 'Travolta', 'guy', 'just', 'ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'Specifically', 'not', 'song', 'talented', 'not', 'John', 'great', 'DVD', 'however', 'subtitles', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'annoying', 'Fortunately', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'look']",N/A

Watching this DVD has allowed me to understand why Olivia once was the Diva of Pop prior to Madonna and Whitney Houston. I wasn't even an Olivia fan prior to watching this DVD, and now, I am.I think her talent and showmanship have been highly underestimated and even underappreciated.Yes, this DVD has somewhat of a cheesy early 80s feel, but anything of that era looks sorta cheesy these days.The subtitles are both in Korean or English. The sound can be heard either in DTS or Stereo. Although the sound quality isn't bad, it is recorded using early 80s acoustic technology and it isn't exceptional.Don't let Olivia's early 80s music videos dissuade you from buying this DVD, she is a different type of performer live and this DVD captures her in it.",5,Olivia at her peak,1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,871,"['Taped', '1982', 'concert', 'when', 'Olivia', 'was', '33', 'height', 'fame', 'Olivia', 'absolutely', 'performer', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'allowed', 'understand', 'why', 'Olivia', 'once', 'was', 'Diva', 'Pop', 'prior', 'Madonna', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'Olivia', 'fan', 'prior', 'watching', 'DVD', 'now', 'am.I', 'think', 'talent', 'showmanship', 'have', 'been', 'highly', 'underestimated', 'even', 'underappreciated.Yes', 'DVD', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'early', '80s', 'feel', 'anything', 'era', 'sorta', 'cheesy', 'days.The', 'subtitles', 'are', 'Korean', 'English', 'sound', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'DTS', 'Stereo', 'sound', 'quality', ""n't"", 'bad', 'recorded', 'using', 'early', '80s', 'acoustic', 'technology', ""n't"", 'exceptional.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'Olivia', 'early', '80s', 'music', 'videos', 'dissuade', 'buying', 'DVD', 'different', 'type', 'performer', 'live', 'DVD']",N/A

941746,A2EGXV8S6URQ8U,B000BG0PDA,Visor,"[1, 1]","First, I feel the need to remind people that this concert was shot on NTSC video (not film) using 1982 camera technology.  The video quality is obviously not perfect, but it's the best you can expect for its time.  I have the VHS version, and the DVD has noticeably better picture quality.  I also have the Video Gold collection, and the PQ is pretty much the same.  I don't get why people are complaining about color qualty as if the differences were like night and day.  They're not, and besides, color quality is really difficult to judge for such an old concert, especially with the stage light colors constantly changing.The sound quality is excellent, particularly the newly-mixed DTS track.  The 5.1 and 2.0 Dolby tracks are also nice, although you'll need to turn up your volume to hear them at the same level as the DTS track.It's true that English subtitles automatically appear during the program, but you can turn them off by simply pressing your ""Subtitle"" button a couple of times (you'll need to bypass the Korean subtitles as well).My only true complaint is that the slideshow intro was cut out of the program and placed in the Special Features section.  This ruins the effect of her career build-up and anticipation of her walking out on-stage.  Ah well, maybe I'll splice them back together again if I decide to make an .mpg file for playback on my WD TV Live.This DVD is no longer available directly through Amazon, but I got a brand new shrink-wrapped copy of it through eBay for $5 including shipping.  Overall, this DVD was a good deal for only $5.  Plus, that's one more VHS tape in my dwindling collection I can get rid of!",4,A good quality video for its time,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,1647,"['First', 'feel', 'need', 'remind', 'people', 'concert', 'was', 'shot', 'NTSC', 'video', 'not', 'film', 'using', '1982', 'camera', 'technology', 'video', 'quality', 'obviously', 'not', 'perfect', 'best', 'can', 'expect', 'time', 'have', 'VHS', 'version', 'DVD', 'noticeably', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'also', 'have', 'Video', 'Gold', 'collection', 'PQ', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'complaining', 'color', 'qualty', 'differences', 'were', 'like', 'night', 'day', ""'re"", 'not', 'besides', 'color', 'quality', 'really', 'difficult', 'judge', 'such', 'old', 'concert', 'especially', 'stage', 'light', 'colors', 'constantly', 'changing.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'newly-mixed', 'DTS', 'track', '5.1', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'tracks', 'are', 'also', 'nice', ""'ll"", 'need', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'hear', 'same', 'level', 'DTS', 'track.It', 'true', 'English', 'subtitles', 'automatically', 'appear', 'program', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'simply', 'pressing', 'Subtitle', 'button', 'couple', 'times', ""'ll"", 'need', 'bypass', 'Korean', 'subtitles', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'true', 'complaint', 'slideshow', 'intro', 'was', 'cut', 'program', 'placed', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'effect', 'career', 'build-up', 'anticipation', 'walking', 'out', 'on-stage', 'Ah', 'well', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'splice', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'decide', 'make', '.mpg', 'file', 'playback', 'WD', 'TV', 'Live.This', 'DVD', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'directly', 'Amazon', 'got', 'brand', 'new', 'shrink-wrapped', 'copy', 'eBay', '5', 'including', 'shipping', 'Overall', 'DVD', 'was', 'good', 'deal', 'only', '5', 'one', 'more', 'VHS', 'tape', 'dwindling', 'collection', 'can', 'get', 'rid']",N/A
