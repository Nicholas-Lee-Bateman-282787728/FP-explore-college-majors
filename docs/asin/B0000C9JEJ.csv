774151,A2ZS8TWUL1QTRH,B0000C9JEJ,A.J. Dill,"[9, 12]","I have not heard much good about Final Fantasy Unlimited, but I decided to give the show a chance since I am a Final Fantasy fan. The show did bring in many bits and pieces from the game series such as Chocobos, the character Cid, many summon creatures, and did a pretty good job with the fantasy setting. Another positive for the show is the voice acting is overall, very good. The voices fits with the characters and the dubbing is well done. Unfortunatley, these are only good remarks I have about the show.What is wrong with the show- quite a few things. First of all, the animation is odd. The combination of 3D graphics and 2D graphics did not fit together. Also, many different animation sequences were used over and over again through the entire show. The show would have been better if all their time was spent on the 2D animation- adding shading, looking to see if characters looked proportional, and definitely better character design. Of all the anime shows I have seen, this series takes the cake for the worst looking characters. I'm not talking about the main characters for they are fine, but the secondary characters and enemys look like they belong in a kiddy show. Because of this horrible character design, it was difficult for me to get into the show. Here is an example- the army of good guys are dressed in gray body suits with bulky black gloves, boots, and hoods; they have no muscle or facial definition at all and some of them appear fat; worst of all were their weapons- long pipes with which they blow darts out of. I often found myself laughing at the characters since they looked too ridiculous to be menacing or realistic.Another big problem with the show was it became very predictable. In every single show, an enemy attacks the good guys and Kaze uses his weapon, the magon, to save the day. The show quickly became boring. What annoyed me the most was the overkill with the chocobo pulling the little heroine girl's piggy tails. It wasn't funny the first time and it was dang annoying by the tenth time. Another predictable thing was each time the show showed the evil emperor, he was eating some odd meal and loosely going over their evil plans. The writers had plenty of things to go more deeply into such as the conflict with Makenshi and his brother, Kaze's past and romance. I have seen tid bits of the manga and I believe a lot was left out.Speaking of leaving things out, this is the last problem I had with Final Fantasy Unlimited. At the end, there are many things I wanted to find out, mostly who died and who survived the final battle. It is left unknown if the kids, their parents, and the other main characters survived the ordeal and return home. Also, the show never tells if the destroyed planets are restored. Then there is the whole thing about the horrible monster Omega and how his crystal fragments are scattered about Wonderland. The show needed an extra episode or two to tie up these loose ends.I came with low expectations for the show and even then I was still disappointed. I highly suggest you don't waste your money on buying the dvd set or renting it.",1,I gave it a chance but...,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,3117,"['have', 'not', 'heard', 'much', 'good', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Unlimited', 'decided', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'am', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'fan', 'show', 'did', 'bring', 'many', 'bits', 'pieces', 'game', 'series', 'such', 'Chocobos', 'character', 'Cid', 'many', 'summon', 'creatures', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'fantasy', 'setting', 'positive', 'show', 'voice', 'acting', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'voices', 'characters', 'dubbing', 'well', 'done', 'Unfortunatley', 'are', 'only', 'good', 'remarks', 'have', 'show.What', 'wrong', 'show-', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'First', 'all', 'animation', 'odd', 'combination', '3D', 'graphics', '2D', 'graphics', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'together', 'Also', 'many', 'different', 'animation', 'sequences', 'were', 'used', 'over', 'again', 'entire', 'show', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'time', 'was', 'spent', '2D', 'animation-', 'adding', 'shading', 'looking', 'see', 'characters', 'looked', 'proportional', 'definitely', 'better', 'character', 'design', 'anime', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'cake', 'worst', 'looking', 'characters', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'fine', 'secondary', 'characters', 'enemys', 'look', 'belong', 'kiddy', 'show', 'horrible', 'character', 'design', 'was', 'difficult', 'get', 'show', 'Here', 'example-', 'army', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'dressed', 'gray', 'body', 'suits', 'bulky', 'black', 'gloves', 'boots', 'hoods', 'have', 'muscle', 'facial', 'definition', 'appear', 'fat', 'worst', 'were', 'weapons-', 'long', 'pipes', 'blow', 'darts', 'often', 'found', 'laughing', 'characters', 'looked', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'be', 'menacing', 'realistic.Another', 'big', 'problem', 'show', 'was', 'became', 'very', 'predictable', 'single', 'show', 'enemy', 'good', 'guys', 'Kaze', 'weapon', 'magon', 'save', 'day', 'show', 'quickly', 'became', 'boring', 'What', 'annoyed', 'most', 'was', 'overkill', 'chocobo', 'pulling', 'little', 'heroine', 'girl', 'piggy', 'tails', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'dang', 'annoying', 'tenth', 'time', 'predictable', 'thing', 'was', 'time', 'show', 'showed', 'evil', 'emperor', 'was', 'eating', 'odd', 'meal', 'loosely', 'going', 'evil', 'plans', 'writers', 'had', 'plenty', 'things', 'go', 'more', 'deeply', 'such', 'conflict', 'Makenshi', 'brother', 'Kaze', 'past', 'romance', 'have', 'seen', 'tid', 'bits', 'manga', 'believe', 'lot', 'was', 'left', 'out.Speaking', 'leaving', 'things', 'out', 'last', 'problem', 'had', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Unlimited', 'end', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'mostly', 'who', 'died', 'who', 'survived', 'final', 'battle', 'left', 'unknown', 'kids', 'parents', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'survived', 'ordeal', 'return', 'home', 'Also', 'show', 'never', 'destroyed', 'planets', 'are', 'restored', 'Then', 'whole', 'thing', 'horrible', 'monster', 'Omega', 'how', 'crystal', 'fragments', 'are', 'scattered', 'Wonderland', 'show', 'needed', 'extra', 'episode', 'two', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends.I', 'came', 'low', 'expectations', 'show', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'still', 'disappointed', 'highly', 'suggest', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying', 'dvd', 'set', 'renting']",Final Fantasy: Unlimited

774155,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0000C9JEJ,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[48, 52]","I'd have to say I was disappointed when I first saw the first episodes of Unlimited. It was named Final Fantasy, but very little linked it to the incredible video game series of the same name. The story seemed immature and generic and not interwoven with many character driven side stories; only the Final Fantasy mascots appeared (Chocobo, for one); and the music didn't reflect the classical style that went with the games. So, needless to say, I didn't bother buying anymore of the DVDs in the series.Then the box set came out, and I admitted to myself that I was at least curious about how this series would end, plus I had learned that Gonzo made Unlimited, and Gonzo has yet to fail me in any of my anime endeavors. I bought it, and I watched the first episodes again. I cringed, because suddenly I felt the same way and even found a few more things I disliked about it. But I didn't stop, and continued to watch, and found that, slowly, this series evolved. It became emotionally driven, with a lot of elements that made Final Fantasy great. There were mascots galore (the stated chocobo, cactuar, moogles, summons, and Cid). Some of the music heard can be heard in previous games (the opening song--not the title song--and the battle victory).Still, it wasn't as Final Fantasy as its namesake, but I found that in watching the anime the entire way through that that was okay. Though it isn't a good chapter in Final Fantasy, it's a great stand-alone anime nonetheless. It has great animation, a strange style that seems both classical and cutting edge (Astroboy with CG). The story deepens as the two main characters search for their parents, and other story lines reveal themselves as well, such as Kaze's story, the main character in charge of a powerful gun capable of summoning creatures into battle, and Lisa, a martial artist with the power to control elements. The antagonists also turn into something more than they had been in the beginning. A deeper, more sinister foe appears later, one that adds a sense of dread to the story that wasn't there previously. All in all, it adds up to one decent anime. And the value itself can't be beaten. Twenty-five episodes of anime for less than fifty-bucks.It's difficult, however, to recommend this anime. I'd only recommend this to Final Fantasy fans who don't take the game too serious. If you do, you'll be disappointed with this anime. I'd also recommend it for anyone who enjoys experimentation in their animation.

The two find their way into Wonderland, beginning their adventure of mystery and exotic lands.There is a combination of animations.  One animation type looks hand drawn and simplistic.  The artwork is not very detailed, but still done nice.  The second type of animation is 3D computer generated.

There are summons such as Phoenix.2.) Fanfare Victory music is played: just like the games.  (maybe cheesy, but it's there)3.) There are chocobos.  (chocobo music is even played)4.) In all Final Fantasy games, there's a man named Cid.  In FF: Unlimited, there is also a man named Cid.For a start, FF: Unlimited (Phase 1) is well done.  The first episode may be a little slow, but it's great when it picks up.  The lead characters have great personalities.  However, I find the little girl a little obnoxious at times.  The chocobo is cute, as it likes to yank on the little girl's hair and yell out, &quot;KWEH!&quot; from time to time.  The enemies in this series are a little corny, but all in all not bad.I give Phase 1 a 4 stars because of the slow start.  I also didn't like feeling like FF: Unlimited was a rip from Alice in Wonderland.  I wish they would've named the world something a little more creative, but that's just me being picky.",4,"Cheesy, Fun, And Entertaining...",1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,1788,"['Final', 'Fantasy', 'Unlimited', 'great', 'qualities', 'one', 'may', 'look', 'animated', 'series', 'First', 'all', 'story', 'pretty', 'decent', 'captivating', 'little', 'slow', 'once', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'really', 'hard', 'be', 'pulled', 'from.The', 'story', 'basically', 'about', 'two', 'children', 'looking', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'world', 'Wonderland', 'two', 'find', 'way', 'Wonderland', 'beginning', 'adventure', 'mystery', 'exotic', 'lands.There', 'combination', 'animations', 'One', 'animation', 'type', 'hand', 'drawn', 'simplistic', 'artwork', 'not', 'very', 'detailed', 'still', 'done', 'nice', 'second', 'type', 'animation', '3D', 'computer', 'generated', 'two', 'two', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'together', 'blend', 'well', 'nicely.It', 'great', 'series', 'watch', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'fan', 'qualities', 'games.1', 'are', 'summons', 'such', 'Phoenix.2', 'Fanfare', 'Victory', 'music', 'played', 'just', 'games', 'maybe', 'cheesy', 'there', '3', 'are', 'chocobos', 'chocobo', 'music', 'even', 'played', '4', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'games', 'man', 'named', 'Cid', 'FF', 'Unlimited', 'also', 'man', 'named', 'Cid.For', 'start', 'FF', 'Unlimited', 'Phase', '1', 'well', 'done', 'first', 'episode', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'slow', 'great', 'when', 'up', 'lead', 'characters', 'have', 'great', 'personalities', 'However', 'find', 'little', 'girl', 'little', 'obnoxious', 'times', 'chocobo', 'cute', 'yank', 'little', 'girl', 'hair', 'yell', 'out', 'quot', 'KWEH', 'quot', 'time', 'time', 'enemies', 'series', 'are', 'little', 'corny', 'not', 'bad.I', 'give', 'Phase', '1', '4', 'stars', 'slow', 'start', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'FF', 'Unlimited', 'was', 'rip', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'named', 'world', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'creative', 'just', 'being', 'picky']",Final Fantasy: Unlimited

774165,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B0000C9JEJ,Lesley Aeschliman,"[1, 1]","Final Fantasy Unlimited: The Complete Collection is a five disc DVD box set that contains all twenty-five episodes of Final Fantasy Unlimited.  This set was released in 2005, after the seven single DVD releases came out.Each disc in the set contains five episodes.  For the second through fifth discs, the only menu option is for languages.  In this menu, you can choose to either have the English audio, or to have the Japanese audio with English subtitles.  On the first disc, you can choose the languages, you can see the DVD credits, and there's a link for ADV Previews.  In the ADV Previews, there are trailers for Azumanga Daioh, DN Angel, Full Metal Panic? FUMOFFU, Rune Soldier, Gatchaman, and Madlax.I found the lack of special features in this box set to be rather disheartening, especially after discovering through research that the seven individually released DVDs did come with bonus features.  For whatever reason, when ADV released this box set, they decided not to include any of those bonuses and just put out a bare bones box set.By the time I finished watching this set, I was rather disappointed in how the series turned out.  In the first episode, it seemed like the series had a lot of potential.  However, as the episodes went on, it became clear that the series followed a rather predictable formula in the episodes, and that the character of Kaze was definitely a ""deus ex machina"" (a ""chair of the gods"").  Between my disappointment in the series, as well as my frustration in the lack of special features, I was rather disappointed in this DVD box set overall.However, if you are a fan of Final Fantasy Unlimited and are trying to collect the series on DVD, I would personally recommend trying to track down the seven individually released DVDs.  However, if you don't mind the lack of special features, then you might have an interest in this box set.  If you decide to purchase the box set, I would recommend shopping around to find the best deal for it that you can.In order to write this review, I watched a copy of this DVD box set that I was given as a gift.",2,Disappointing series and lack of special features,1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,2092,"['Final', 'Fantasy', 'Unlimited', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'five', 'disc', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'twenty-five', 'episodes', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Unlimited', 'set', 'was', 'released', '2005', 'seven', 'single', 'DVD', 'releases', 'came', 'out.Each', 'disc', 'set', 'five', 'episodes', 'second', 'fifth', 'discs', 'only', 'menu', 'option', 'languages', 'menu', 'can', 'choose', 'have', 'English', 'audio', 'have', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'English', 'subtitles', 'first', 'disc', 'can', 'choose', 'languages', 'can', 'see', 'DVD', 'credits', 'link', 'ADV', 'Previews', 'ADV', 'Previews', 'are', 'trailers', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'DN', 'Angel', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'FUMOFFU', 'Rune', 'Soldier', 'Gatchaman', 'Madlax.I', 'found', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'box', 'set', 'be', 'rather', 'disheartening', 'especially', 'discovering', 'research', 'seven', 'individually', 'released', 'DVDs', 'did', 'come', 'bonus', 'features', 'reason', 'when', 'ADV', 'released', 'box', 'set', 'decided', 'not', 'include', 'bonuses', 'just', 'put', 'out', 'bare', 'box', 'set.By', 'time', 'finished', 'watching', 'set', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'how', 'series', 'turned', 'out', 'first', 'episode', 'seemed', 'series', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'However', 'episodes', 'went', 'became', 'clear', 'series', 'followed', 'rather', 'predictable', 'formula', 'episodes', 'character', 'Kaze', 'was', 'definitely', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'chair', 'gods', 'Between', 'disappointment', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'frustration', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'overall.However', 'are', 'fan', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Unlimited', 'are', 'trying', 'collect', 'series', 'DVD', 'would', 'personally', 'recommend', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'seven', 'individually', 'released', 'DVDs', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'interest', 'box', 'set', 'decide', 'purchase', 'box', 'set', 'would', 'recommend', 'shopping', 'find', 'best', 'deal', 'can.In', 'order', 'write', 'review', 'watched', 'copy', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'given', 'gift']",Final Fantasy: Unlimited
774166,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B0000C9JEJ,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[30, 33]","When I first heard that there was a Final Fantasy series that was to be introduced as a DVD series in the US I was quite excited.  Certainly, as a game series, Final Fantasy has consistenly hit high marks in both story and graphics.  It seemed reasonalble to expect that the series, coming out at the same time as other series that have shown landmark levels of quality would be something to watch.  Alas, that is not the case.A great tower of light suddenly plunges into the modern world, and titanic monsters appear in epic battles.  The world changes subtly as a darker presence begins to take possession of the shadows.  A pair of research scientists start an investigation, but disappear right after they publish a book about a strange underground world that seems to have appeared right under our feet.  Now it falls to Yu and Ai Hayakawa to try and find their parents.  The board an odd subway train, and are transported to...Wonderland.In this DVD we take our first tour of wonderland, as the young children discover the mysteries and threats that surround then and acquire new companions like Lisa, who has her own special variety of 'martial arts,' and Kaze who uses a magical gun to carry out his role as a summoner (remember FF8 and FFX).  At present the story stays focussed at this level, a bit more fight and adventure oriented, although I expect that the serious story arcs will gradually become more important.While the work is acceptible as standard Saturday morning cartoon fareit really lakes the flair that marks most Final Fanasty work.  In fact, other than some creatures like Chocobos, it really has very little in common with the Final Fantasy game series.  Scripting and character development are minimal, aimed at an audience that isn't quite ready for the complex relationship building which marks the show's namesakes.  And the artwork is interesting in spots, but more cartoon-like, reminiscent of  than the originals.A quick glance at the credits shows that there is very little cross over between the game creators and the series staff.  This explains many of the little gaps that make the show confusing for a long time fan.  If one approaches this as an independent work rather than as an heir to one of gaming's greatest lineages, then it is an acceptable and entertaining series.  Buy if you are looking for the world of Gaia, peopled with Yuna's, Strife's, and Vivi's you are going to be disappointed, as I was.",3,Behind the Curve,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,2448,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'series', 'was', 'be', 'introduced', 'DVD', 'series', 'US', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'Certainly', 'game', 'series', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'consistenly', 'hit', 'high', 'marks', 'story', 'graphics', 'seemed', 'reasonalble', 'expect', 'series', 'coming', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'series', 'have', 'shown', 'landmark', 'levels', 'quality', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'watch', 'Alas', 'not', 'case.A', 'great', 'tower', 'light', 'suddenly', 'modern', 'world', 'titanic', 'monsters', 'appear', 'epic', 'battles', 'world', 'subtly', 'darker', 'presence', 'take', 'possession', 'shadows', 'pair', 'research', 'scientists', 'start', 'investigation', 'disappear', 'right', 'publish', 'book', 'strange', 'underground', 'world', 'have', 'appeared', 'right', 'feet', 'Now', 'Yu', 'Ai', 'Hayakawa', 'try', 'find', 'parents', 'board', 'odd', 'subway', 'train', 'are', 'transported', 'Wonderland.In', 'DVD', 'take', 'first', 'tour', 'wonderland', 'young', 'children', 'mysteries', 'threats', 'surround', 'then', 'acquire', 'new', 'companions', 'Lisa', 'who', 'own', 'special', 'variety', ""'martial"", 'arts', 'Kaze', 'who', 'magical', 'gun', 'carry', 'out', 'role', 'summoner', 'remember', 'FF8', 'FFX', 'present', 'story', 'focussed', 'level', 'bit', 'more', 'fight', 'adventure', 'oriented', 'expect', 'serious', 'story', 'arcs', 'will', 'gradually', 'become', 'more', 'important.While', 'work', 'acceptible', 'standard', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'fareit', 'really', 'flair', 'most', 'Final', 'Fanasty', 'work', 'fact', 'other', 'creatures', 'Chocobos', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'game', 'series', 'Scripting', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'minimal', 'aimed', 'audience', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ready', 'complex', 'relationship', 'building', 'show', 'namesakes', 'artwork', 'interesting', 'spots', 'more', 'cartoon-like', 'reminiscent', 'originals.A', 'quick', 'glance', 'credits', 'very', 'little', 'cross', 'game', 'creators', 'series', 'staff', 'many', 'little', 'gaps', 'make', 'show', 'confusing', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'one', 'independent', 'work', 'rather', 'heir', 'one', 'gaming', 'greatest', 'lineages', 'then', 'acceptable', 'entertaining', 'series', 'Buy', 'are', 'looking', 'world', 'Gaia', 'peopled', 'Yuna', 'Strife', 'Vivi', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'was']",Final Fantasy: Unlimited
774167,AGYNZFMF3Y7C,B0000C9JEJ,Mayle,"[12, 24]","No wonder it got canceled. If you where expecting a beatiful story line like ones you play or something a unique story like ff series usually does. Well guess what your not gonna find it here. Usually i would atleast compliment the graphics here but the main charactes seem more like background sketches that the animators didn't really care about. Oh and the digital graphics. The digital graphis where nice at first til they got extremely repetive and they seemed to be forced on to conclude the episodes. The only thing that i can't really critisize for the very little fact the he it never fails is the soundtrack. It seems that the only one who actually cared for this project was Nobuo Uematsu which he never fails to bring the soundtrack to life with the Final Fantasy series. Don't get me wrong I wasnt expecting something final Fantasish. But, it said on the box it was based in the final fantasy world. So now the final fantasy world is called wonderland? I didn't know that final fantasy was inhabited by a bunch of patato sack looking people. I can't belive i was even curious to buy the whole box set. Im disapointed for the fact that i actually trusted on square enix to provide atleast a good story line. If your curious of the anime it wouldnt be better to just watch the last Cd. The writers drag you threw all the anime wondering the characters past yet they manage to unveiled their secrets in the last episodes near the end. The series was meant to be more than 26 episodes but it sucked so bad that they canceled it. Oh yeah it got that bad. Also on the trasilation seems like a train wreck. If you dont watch it by subtitles you might miss the Final fantasy feel of the story which is extremely sad i found that out near the end. In my opinion this was wrost than spirits with in. I tried to like it but i couldn't manage with such crumy character models that seemed that they where done by amatures at gonzo. I think the reason for the making of this anime was either for: To scare people about crossovers and how bad they can get. Or Square-enix and Gonzo where making so much money Square enix said ""hey lets make something that lowers our sales!"" and Gonzo was probably like ""Hey yeah let's make it a series that kid's can't grasp the concept and it's too dumb for adult's to like. lets just put mushroom people!"" If your a kid and like this you probably would get distracted by a passing bird in the sky and forgot what you were doing one second later. It get's that bad. I though i never said this but, I finally found an anime that i dont like at all. Next time when i try to do something like this I'll just flush money down the toilet. Honestly i wouldn't watch it agian unless they would pay me or I was lossing all hope for human kind. Bottom line:Storyline: -1/5Animation: 2/5Music:  3/5 (I wouldn't recomend the sountrack though it's too expesive.)Overall: 1/5 that's cause too many people praised it making it sound like its a great anime when its not. I would rather sit down and watch pokemon(I dont like pokemon...)

I know the series focused mostly on the two children trying to find their parents but I also thought there would either be some cameos from characters of the games are have some references to the game worlds, sadly there was neither and the animation while not horrible wasn't anything to be proud of either.  The voice actors for the Japanese cast did do a great job for their character roles sadly the dubbed English voice cast while not the worst of the lot leave a lot to be desired.  Also again with some anime you just don't really feel any empathy for most of these characters, if one was killed or hurt so what?  The storyline itself isn't to bad and if you've never played the games and are looking for a unique anime here's a decent one, but if you have played the game and are looking for some kid of reference to the games or game characters you'll be sadly disappointed.

774171,AAJ9VIJDUZ35Z,B0000C9JEJ,tvideo,"[1, 2]","Rather than review all the phases, I figure it's best to do the first since you'll be starting off with this one anyway :)The 'Final Fantasy' direct game series (meaning 1-11) has always been the basis and the best. The spin-off games have always been recieved with mixed opinions, since they can be quite different.However, the Final Fantasy Animation have always been recieved very poorly. The first anime called &quot;Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals&quot; was in 4 parts and took place after the FF5 video game...the translation of names was inconsistance w/ the later released US video game, needless to say it was pretty bad. We all remeber Sony's attempt to show off the PS2 CG movie...which was terrible.However, FFU is actually the 3rd and best atempt for an animated FF series. As the games it is a completely new story, but with classic FF elements (Chocobos, Summon Spells, Charcters leave &amp; join the party) so in this aspect it is pretty good.The English dubbing is also pretty good, though Yu's voice actor always sounds like he reading his lines and they should have used someone else in my opinion (that's quite annoying!).The story will be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys the games, I would base the character types (like Fungus and other weird one) on a FF6 &amp; 9 level = NOT for everyone as some are silly, I do not believe Amano created them, but that's the overall flavor.This is somewhat like Xenogears animation (mix of CG &amp; Cartoon) but overall not quite that much...but again you get the idea. 90% is animated with only a few scenes and small fractions with some CG special effects like Kaze's Demon Gun (AKA Magun in US).Overall don't expect this to be based directly on a FF game. I reccomend it for die-hard Squaresoft/FF fans.The Japanese version would fir nicely in the &quot;Teen&quot; rating, but sadly the US version is slightly toned down and thus younger children would enjoy it :(",3,Best Final Fantasy Animation so far,1084060800,"05 9, 2004",2004,1928,"['Rather', 'review', 'phases', 'figure', 'best', 'do', 'first', ""'ll"", 'be', 'starting', 'off', 'one', 'anyway', ""'Final"", 'Fantasy', 'direct', 'game', 'series', 'meaning', '1-11', 'always', 'been', 'basis', 'best', 'spin-off', 'games', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'recieved', 'mixed', 'opinions', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'different.However', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Animation', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'recieved', 'very', 'poorly', 'first', 'anime', 'called', 'quot', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Legend', 'Crystals', 'quot', 'was', '4', 'parts', 'took', 'place', 'FF5', 'video', 'game', 'translation', 'names', 'was', 'inconsistance', 'w/', 'later', 'released', 'US', 'video', 'game', 'needless', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'remeber', 'Sony', 'attempt', 'show', 'off', 'PS2', 'CG', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible.However', 'FFU', 'actually', '3rd', 'best', 'atempt', 'animated', 'FF', 'series', 'games', 'completely', 'new', 'story', 'classic', 'FF', 'elements', 'Chocobos', 'Summon', 'Spells', 'Charcters', 'leave', 'amp', 'join', 'party', 'so', 'aspect', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'English', 'dubbing', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'Yu', 'voice', 'actor', 'always', 'reading', 'lines', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'someone', 'else', 'opinion', 'quite', 'annoying', '.The', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'who', 'games', 'would', 'base', 'character', 'types', 'Fungus', 'other', 'weird', 'one', 'FF6', 'amp', '9', 'level', '=', 'NOT', 'everyone', 'are', 'silly', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'Amano', 'created', 'overall', 'flavor.This', 'somewhat', 'like', 'Xenogears', 'animation', 'mix', 'CG', 'amp', 'Cartoon', 'overall', 'not', 'quite', 'much', 'again', 'get', 'idea', '90', '%', 'animated', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'small', 'fractions', 'CG', 'special', 'effects', 'Kaze', 'Demon', 'Gun', 'AKA', 'Magun', 'US', '.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'based', 'directly', 'FF', 'game', 'reccomend', 'die-hard', 'Squaresoft/FF', 'Japanese', 'version', 'would', 'fir', 'nicely', 'quot', 'Teen', 'quot', 'rating', 'sadly', 'US', 'version', 'slightly', 'toned', 'down', 'thus', 'younger', 'children', 'would', 'enjoy']",Final Fantasy: Unlimited
