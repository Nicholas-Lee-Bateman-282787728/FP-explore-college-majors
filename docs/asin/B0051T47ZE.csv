I have seen it done before in several movies.  I did find Warwick's profession to be a hoot!  I believe that was the best part of the movie for me.  As for the torture...I didn't find it offensive..or horrid.  I found it tame compared to movies like Cannibal or The Serbian Film. In fact, I was rather disappointed there wasn't more and the fact that....SPOILER ALERT.....the small wounds and slashed throat were done with Warwick using a make up kit was just a let down.  Warwick may have been coo-coo for cocoa-cocoa puffs but he didn't kill anyone in the movie. In fact, he seemed like a kind caring host by even setting his victim free once the party was over.I didn't care much for the acting/casting in the movie. The only one I was amused by was Mr. Pierce when he did his little table dance to the tune of ""Car Wash"" and there was another scene in the bathroom where he was having sex with one of his imaginary friends and spanking her imaginary behind...that was worth a giggle.

Clayne Crawford is bank robber John Taylor who gets injured on a job and crashes at Warrick's house after being rejected by the religious zealot next-door, played surprisingly by Helen Reddy.John has every intention of victimizing Warrick, but our host is severely unhinged, and the tables are turned...and then the tables are turned...and, well, stay tuned for lots of sadistic and dark comedic fun with a surprise ending that will have you reeling.  One of my favorite parts in the movie is the ""Car Wash"" scene during which I couldn't help laughing out loud.

1437387,A1NVO2OVXE09F4,B0051T47ZE,Caryss Wood-Behan,"[0, 1]","The Perfect Host is an impatient movie.  Rather than delivering subtle, sumptuous hints at what is yet to come, it rushes forth, half-cooked, dropping one sloppy serving after another into viewers' laps.John, on the run from police after robbing a bank, gains entry into the posh pad of dapper Warwick Wilson by feigning an association with one of Warwick's close friends. Warwick's accommodating gestures prove short lived when a radio news alert reveals John's true identity. His ruse exposed, John's affable demeanor turns menacing and aggressive, with all indications portending a dire outcome for Warwick. Surprisingly, the effete, ostensibly weaker, Warwick gains the dominant position, and John finds himself gagged and bound to a chair. Thus begins the first course of a deranged dinner party served with ""deception"" as the theme.As guests begin to arrive, Warwick makes no attempt to conceal John's compromised condition. He skitters manically from room to room, ensuring the satiety of his friends whom we come to learn do not really exist at all. As host, Warwick also stops to check on his prisoner, John, every so often, leaving him with a kick, punch, burn or other assault. During each sadistic pit stop, Warwick force-feeds alcohol to John before scampering off to showcase some freakish talents which include dancing in twisting, writhing serpentine movements as well as an inexplicable air humping act.A Perfect Host - even one played by a perfect actor such as David Hyde Pierce - needs to include more on his dinner menu than roasted duck, hardcore slapstick, and court-jester shenanigans. The superior abilities of Pierce and Clyde Crawford (a young, Michael Keaton type) might have taken this dinner gathering to a glorious finale had their roles been complemented by other interesting characters.  Evidently, The Perfect Host production team thought otherwise, opting to toss in some extras bodies as filler content, while delivering no substance. Consequently, the easy-bake oven approach that created this flop of a movie misses an opportunity to deepen the story's message about the human tendency to deceive and to mislead others. Instead, the writer fires a farrago of disordered elements into The Perfect Host's salver, straight through to the film's absurd ending.An audience would have been better served without a mist of made-up dinner guests and a muddle of disparate, distasteful side dishes littering the table.",1,Decline the invitation to this dinner party...,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,2447,"['Perfect', 'Host', 'impatient', 'movie', 'Rather', 'delivering', 'subtle', 'sumptuous', 'hints', 'what', 'yet', 'come', 'forth', 'half-cooked', 'dropping', 'one', 'sloppy', 'serving', 'viewers', 'laps.John', 'run', 'police', 'robbing', 'bank', 'gains', 'entry', 'posh', 'pad', 'dapper', 'Warwick', 'Wilson', 'feigning', 'association', 'one', 'Warwick', 'close', 'friends', 'Warwick', 'accommodating', 'gestures', 'prove', 'short', 'lived', 'when', 'radio', 'news', 'alert', 'John', 'true', 'identity', 'ruse', 'exposed', 'John', 'affable', 'demeanor', 'menacing', 'aggressive', 'indications', 'portending', 'dire', 'outcome', 'Warwick', 'Surprisingly', 'effete', 'ostensibly', 'weaker', 'Warwick', 'gains', 'dominant', 'position', 'John', 'gagged', 'bound', 'chair', 'Thus', 'first', 'course', 'deranged', 'dinner', 'party', 'served', 'deception', 'theme.As', 'begin', 'arrive', 'Warwick', 'attempt', 'conceal', 'John', 'compromised', 'condition', 'manically', 'room', 'room', 'ensuring', 'satiety', 'friends', 'whom', 'come', 'learn', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'exist', 'host', 'Warwick', 'also', 'check', 'prisoner', 'John', 'so', 'often', 'leaving', 'kick', 'punch', 'burn', 'other', 'assault', 'sadistic', 'pit', 'stop', 'Warwick', 'force-feeds', 'alcohol', 'John', 'scampering', 'off', 'showcase', 'freakish', 'talents', 'include', 'dancing', 'twisting', 'writhing', 'serpentine', 'movements', 'as', 'well', 'inexplicable', 'air', 'humping', 'act.A', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'even', 'one', 'played', 'perfect', 'actor', 'such', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'include', 'more', 'dinner', 'menu', 'roasted', 'duck', 'hardcore', 'slapstick', 'court-jester', 'shenanigans', 'superior', 'abilities', 'Pierce', 'Clyde', 'Crawford', 'young', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'type', 'might', 'have', 'taken', 'dinner', 'gathering', 'glorious', 'finale', 'had', 'roles', 'been', 'complemented', 'other', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Evidently', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'production', 'team', 'thought', 'otherwise', 'opting', 'toss', 'extras', 'bodies', 'filler', 'content', 'delivering', 'substance', 'Consequently', 'easy-bake', 'oven', 'approach', 'created', 'flop', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'deepen', 'story', 'message', 'human', 'tendency', 'deceive', 'mislead', 'others', 'Instead', 'writer', 'farrago', 'disordered', 'elements', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'salver', 'straight', 'film', 'absurd', 'ending.An', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'mist', 'made-up', 'dinner', 'guests', 'muddle', 'disparate', 'distasteful', 'side', 'dishes', 'littering', 'table']",N/A

1437390,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0051T47ZE,C. Sawin,"[11, 15]","Films with a twist are a strange animal, aren't they? Certain filmmakers have made a career out of it like Christopher Nolan and M. Night Shyamalan while films like Oldboy and The Usual Suspects completely rely on a twist to give everything a bit of a deeper meaning. But when does it become too much? If a film has more than one twist is it overkill? What about the ones with several? Getting tangled up in swerve after swerve probably isn't a good idea. That's one of the reasons most people hated Basic. Maybe it's a guilty pleasure of mine, but I almost always enjoy a movie with a good twist or two in it. And frankly, The Perfect Host is unlike anything the films it may share traits with.Everything seems like an open and shut case as the movie begins. John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) just robbed a bank and is looking for a sanctuary of sorts to take cover in until the heat blows over. He stumbles onto the home of Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce), which happens to be a rather extravagant home. Warwick is preparing for a dinner party and eventually lets John in after John convinces him that he's a friend of a friend. Push comes to shove and suddenly Warwick is up to speed and John now has the upper hand. But things aren't always what they seem and it just so happens that John walked right into Warwick's trap. The night only gets stranger and stranger for John as Warwick's insanity takes center stage.The movie is mainly a cat and mouse game between John and Warwick. John Taylor initially comes off as a selfish, despicable lowlife but there's actually a pretty interesting back story to him. Warwick's story is just as interesting. He's classy, quirky, and charming in an awkward kind of way. He has this Jack Torrance quality to him that draws you to his character. His antics are what make the film as good as it is. It'd be like injecting Rubber's outlandish qualities into the first half of The Human Centipede before the actual human centipede comes into play. The Perfect Host is a dark, humorous, and spellbinding journey.The music also compliments the visuals so well. The quieter and more orchestral sounding pieces not only match the class that Warwick is trying to project, but also make his darker intentions put you a bit more on edge. Not that anything is relatively terrifying in The Perfect Host, but everything is so outlandish that you're not entirely sure what to expect. The music tends to get more over the top to match Warwick's spiral into madness, which is a superb quality for a film like this to have.The Perfect Host may be a bit overwhelming to some. The way the film is constantly twisting and turning in directions you don't expect may come off as a little tiresome, but it is really fantastic if you're a fan of unpredictability. Things you've thought you've figured out unravel to reveal you only knew part of the story. It's as if The Perfect Host has a never-ending amount of layers that's driven by the rather incredible performance of David Hyde Pierce and the equally impressive Clayne Crawford. The Perfect Host won't be for everyone, but to the ones it does speak to is some of the finest bat$#%! insanity to ever be filmed.The DVD is mostly bare bones when it comes to special features. We get a Making of featurette featuring writer and director Nick Tomnay. The feature is about eleven minutes long and features Tomnay talking about the film spliced with scenes of the film. There is some interesting stuff in there like how The Perfect Host was originally a short, black and white flim that was shot in 2000, only taking 17 days to shoot the film, and Clayne Crawford putting a rock in his shoe to keep his limp up throughout the film. Tomnay also tells us how David Hyde Pierce came aboard and discusses how important the music is to the film. Then there's the four and a half minute featurette HDNet: A Look at The Perfect Host. This is mostly just a highlight reel from the film along with David Hyde Pierce talking about it. Throw in the theatrical trailer and that wraps up the special features.The Perfect Host is rated R for language, some violent content and brief sexual material. It's presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital sound with optional Spanish subtitles and has a widescreen aspect ratio of 1.78:1. It's approximately 93 minutes long and should be available in both retail stores and most online retailers now.",4,Some of the finest bat$#%! insanity to ever be filmed,1314748800,"08 31, 2011",2011,4390,"['Films', 'twist', 'are', 'strange', 'animal', 'are', ""n't"", 'Certain', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'made', 'career', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'Oldboy', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'completely', 'rely', 'twist', 'give', 'everything', 'bit', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'when', 'become', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'twist', 'overkill', 'What', 'ones', 'several', 'Getting', 'tangled', 'up', 'swerve', 'swerve', 'probably', ""n't"", 'good', 'idea', 'one', 'reasons', 'most', 'people', 'hated', 'Basic', 'Maybe', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine', 'almost', 'always', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'good', 'twist', 'two', 'frankly', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'anything', 'films', 'may', 'share', 'traits', 'with.Everything', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'movie', 'John', 'Taylor', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'just', 'robbed', 'bank', 'looking', 'sanctuary', 'sorts', 'take', 'cover', 'heat', 'over', 'home', 'Warwick', 'Wilson', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'be', 'rather', 'extravagant', 'home', 'Warwick', 'preparing', 'dinner', 'party', 'eventually', 'John', 'John', 'friend', 'friend', 'Push', 'shove', 'suddenly', 'Warwick', 'up', 'speed', 'John', 'now', 'upper', 'hand', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'what', 'seem', 'just', 'so', 'John', 'walked', 'right', 'Warwick', 'trap', 'night', 'only', 'stranger', 'stranger', 'John', 'Warwick', 'insanity', 'center', 'stage.The', 'movie', 'mainly', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'John', 'Warwick', 'John', 'Taylor', 'initially', 'off', 'selfish', 'despicable', 'lowlife', 'actually', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'back', 'story', 'Warwick', 'story', 'just', 'interesting', 'classy', 'quirky', 'charming', 'awkward', 'kind', 'way', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'quality', 'character', 'antics', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'good', ""'d"", 'be', 'injecting', 'Rubber', 'outlandish', 'qualities', 'first', 'half', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'actual', 'human', 'centipede', 'play', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'dark', 'humorous', 'spellbinding', 'journey.The', 'music', 'also', 'visuals', 'so', 'well', 'quieter', 'more', 'orchestral', 'sounding', 'pieces', 'not', 'only', 'match', 'class', 'Warwick', 'trying', 'project', 'also', 'make', 'darker', 'intentions', 'put', 'bit', 'more', 'edge', 'Not', 'anything', 'relatively', 'terrifying', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'everything', 'so', 'outlandish', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'music', 'get', 'more', 'top', 'match', 'Warwick', 'spiral', 'madness', 'superb', 'quality', 'film', 'have.The', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'overwhelming', 'way', 'film', 'constantly', 'twisting', 'turning', 'directions', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'tiresome', 'really', 'fantastic', ""'re"", 'fan', 'unpredictability', 'Things', ""'ve"", 'thought', ""'ve"", 'figured', 'out', 'unravel', 'reveal', 'only', 'knew', 'part', 'story', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'never-ending', 'amount', 'layers', 'driven', 'rather', 'incredible', 'performance', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'ones', 'speak', 'finest', 'bat', '%', 'insanity', 'ever', 'be', 'filmed.The', 'DVD', 'mostly', 'bare', 'bones', 'when', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'Making', 'featurette', 'featuring', 'writer', 'director', 'Nick', 'Tomnay', 'feature', 'eleven', 'minutes', 'long', 'features', 'Tomnay', 'talking', 'film', 'spliced', 'scenes', 'film', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'how', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'was', 'originally', 'short', 'black', 'white', 'flim', 'was', 'shot', '2000', 'only', 'taking', '17', 'days', 'shoot', 'film', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'putting', 'rock', 'shoe', 'keep', 'limp', 'up', 'film', 'Tomnay', 'also', 'how', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'came', 'aboard', 'how', 'important', 'music', 'film', 'Then', 'four', 'half', 'minute', 'featurette', 'HDNet', 'Look', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'mostly', 'just', 'highlight', 'reel', 'film', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'talking', 'Throw', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'up', 'special', 'features.The', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'violent', 'content', 'brief', 'sexual', 'material', 'presented', 'English', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', 'optional', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.78:1', 'approximately', '93', 'minutes', 'long', 'should', 'be', 'available', 'retail', 'stores', 'most', 'online', 'retailers', 'now']",N/A

Not so with Nick Tomnay's THE PERFECT HOST.  The film is laugh-out-loud hilarious in spots, while in others it is genuinely disturbing.For it's first two-thirds, HOST is almost existential.  It revolves around bank robber John (Clayne Crawford) who seeks refuge in the house of unassuming Warwick (David Hyde Pierce), who turns out to be a lunatic.  There's no mistaking it: this is Hyde Pierce's film, and for much of it he nimbly carries its weight on his unpredictable shoulders.  Known for the straight-arrow role of Niles Crane on ""Frasier,"" Pierce clearly has a ball slipping into Warwick's blood-soaked shoes, dancing and humping air and twisting about like a nine-year-old on an acid trip.  He's utterly mesmerizing, switching from serious to hilarious with a snap of his fingers.  More surprisingly, Crawford is a perfect match.  He has some hilarious moments himself (""I can't speak for everyone else, but I'm having a great time""), but he's really meant to induce a sense of pathos, which he manages admirably.  For a good part of the film, he's swooning in an alcoholic daze, and yet he still manages to be likeable and sympathetic.  His role is rather thankless (Pierce is the star here), but Crawford doesn't seem to mind much.If the film had remained with these two characters, inside Warwick's house, it would have been an easy 5 stars.  Unfortunately, somebody somewhere must have expressed concerns about having a film revolving around one clearly unsympathetic character, and another who pushes the limits.  So they creates some flashbacks, and then a few scenes with detectives, and then tacked on a third act that sort-of brings everything together.  Or at least it's meant to; what it actually does is destroy the point of the film.  THE PERFECT HOST is, indeed, near-perfect when it's confined inside the walls of Warwick's house; but when the outside world encroaches, it becomes entangled in its own innate unbelievability, and so flounders.  The film is still worth a few viewings, but that third act is so utterly disappointing, it makes you wish the filmmakers had been a little more gutsy.",3,"""Lighten up, John, it's a party!""",1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,2264,"['Few', 'movies', 'successfully', 'manage', 'combine', 'horror', 'comedy', 'probably', 'two', 'are', 'such', 'perfect', 'companions', 'people', 'tend', 'over-think', 'Not', 'so', 'Nick', 'Tomnay', 'THE', 'PERFECT', 'HOST', 'film', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'spots', 'others', 'genuinely', 'disturbing.For', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'HOST', 'almost', 'existential', 'bank', 'robber', 'John', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'who', 'refuge', 'house', 'unassuming', 'Warwick', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'lunatic', 'mistaking', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'film', 'much', 'nimbly', 'weight', 'unpredictable', 'shoulders', 'Known', 'straight-arrow', 'role', 'Niles', 'Crane', 'Frasier', 'Pierce', 'clearly', 'ball', 'slipping', 'Warwick', 'blood-soaked', 'shoes', 'dancing', 'humping', 'air', 'twisting', 'nine-year-old', 'acid', 'trip', 'utterly', 'mesmerizing', 'switching', 'serious', 'hilarious', 'snap', 'fingers', 'More', 'surprisingly', 'Crawford', 'perfect', 'match', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'everyone', 'else', ""'m"", 'having', 'great', 'time', 'really', 'meant', 'induce', 'sense', 'pathos', 'admirably', 'good', 'part', 'film', 'swooning', 'alcoholic', 'daze', 'yet', 'still', 'be', 'likeable', 'sympathetic', 'role', 'rather', 'thankless', 'Pierce', 'star', 'here', 'Crawford', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'film', 'had', 'remained', 'two', 'characters', 'Warwick', 'house', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', '5', 'stars', 'Unfortunately', 'somebody', 'somewhere', 'must', 'have', 'expressed', 'concerns', 'having', 'film', 'revolving', 'one', 'clearly', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'who', 'limits', 'creates', 'flashbacks', 'then', 'few', 'scenes', 'detectives', 'then', 'tacked', 'third', 'act', 'sort-of', 'brings', 'everything', 'together', 'least', 'meant', 'what', 'actually', 'destroy', 'point', 'film', 'PERFECT', 'HOST', 'indeed', 'near-perfect', 'when', 'confined', 'walls', 'Warwick', 'house', 'when', 'outside', 'world', 'encroaches', 'entangled', 'own', 'innate', 'unbelievability', 'so', 'flounders', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'few', 'viewings', 'third', 'act', 'so', 'utterly', 'disappointing', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'gutsy']",N/A

David Hyde Pierce is absolutely perfect for this roll, as if it were written just for him to show his range of acting.  When an injured young bank robber who claims to have been mugged shows up at his door seeking entrance under the guise of knowing a mutual friend having gained information from post card in mail box, we wonder who's fooling who here.  He is eventually invited in and after using the phone to call a non-existant cousin who is not yet home, he is invited to sit for half an hour with a glass of wine until cousin will be available.  David Hyde Pierce is preparing for a dinner party and eventually invites the young man to join them which he gladly does.  Oh my, the guests are only seen through the eyes of the host (and we the viewers) who talks to them and interacts with all while always including our young man in the conversation.  Neither man is who he seems to be.  There are just too many twists and turns to tell that would only be spoilers.  I must tell you that I was very surprised when I realized that the ""old lady neighbor"" was Helen Reddy of all people.

1437416,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0051T47ZE,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","It's nice now and then to be surprised a bit by a movie. They say there are only a handful of plots that are rotated and transformed into various films so when something original comes along it's a treat. THE PERFECT HOST is one of those movies.John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) is on the run. He's just robbed a bank of over $300,000, is wounded and the police know his name and are showing his picture on the news. Now he needs a place to hide until things cool off.Trying one house in an affluent area of LA he's rebuffed by a Jehovah's Witness (Helen Reddy) who keeps him out of her house. Checking the mailbox next door for some insight into who lives there, he meets Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce). Spinning a tale that he's just back from Australia where he met Warwick's friend Julia, he asks to use his phone to reach his cousin for assistance since he's been mugged.Preparing for dinner guests, Warwick allows John to use his phone and launches into a discussion about Julia. He dresses for his guests and all goes along smoothly until John, while trying to listen to the news about his robbery, loses his cool and threatens Warwick. And this is where things begin to change. It seems that Warwick had been giving John red wine that was drugged to drink and now the tables turn.In a normal film this is where the victim would call the police, the criminal would threaten him and then later escape to insure his threat. But here we have John wake to find himself tied to a chair at the dinner table while Warwick attempts to introduce him to the party guests who have arrived. The problem is that all the guests are there in Warwick's mind only.As the night progresses a game of cat and mouse fluctuates between these two characters. John is given an insight into what the night holds in store for him as Warwick takes his picture with a Polaroid and then shows him a scrapbook that he keeps. Each page has a picture taken of someone else. Could it be that John has landed in the home of a serial killer? And what are the chances that he will live past this night?The movie is a great combination of mystery, suspense and dark humor as the night goes on, the party in full swing (at least in Warwick's mind) and John looking for the opportunity to escape. Occasional moments are there for him to do so, but one might guess that Warwick planned them that way to make the night more entertaining.Pierce does a fantastic job as Warwick, a demented soul that seems like a combination of the Niles Crane character he portrayed so well on FRASIER, Hannibal Lecter and Elwood P. Dowd. He's fussy about his home, deadly to the extreme and able to see folks who aren't really there. When pieced together they make him a dangerous and unstable person to be around. A twist that I won't reveal towards the end makes him even more unusual if that's possible.Crawford does a great job as well, keeping up with Pierce as he goes from a menacing to a sympathetic character. We didn't see the robbery from the start and never really see the entire thing, but with flashbacks we get to find out his reasons for the robbery, noble though faulted they might be. Before the night is over we hope he escapes, we hope he can find a way out of this nightmare and the city.The twist that comes when prey becomes hunter is a nice one but it doesn't stop there. As the night winds down another twist comes across. And then this one is followed by yet a third twist and the fourth twist that makes the whole story unusual, funny and keeps you waiting for the final moments to see how it plays out. And as the final credits are about to roll, you wonder just what will happen afterwards. The answer isn't offered but various possibilities come to mind.THE PERFECT HOST is an interesting and unusual movie more for fans of dark humor and of David Hyde Pierce.

Of course, both the host and the robber have underlying secrets that provide the first major twist and as the evening progresses, even stranger things are revealed.  Further information would result in the verboten spoilers; suffice to say it borders on incredulity.  It does have a devilishly perverse ending, though.David Hyde Pierce is indeed the perfect host.  His performance is deftly controlled even in his most manic moments, shifting effortlessly from perverse humor to simple perversion.  It is a remarkable performance.  Clayne Crawford is equally impressive as the robber who mistakenly underestimates his host.  Singer Helen Reddy shows up in a small role as Pierce's busybody neighbor, and acquits herself well.

Our criminal isn't necessarily as tough as he talks, and our mild host is far more terrifying than he at first appears.If the film stopped there, meshing one man's lower-class struggle with the mental decay of the upper-class, ""The Perfect Host"" would be a brilliant if short film.  But director Nick Tomnay wants to keep peeling back layers, so he keeps inventing increasingly unlikely surprises about each of character.  By the time the police get involved, ""The Perfect Host"" starts overstaying its welcome.Still, David Hyde Pierce as Warwick Wilson is at his best here playing a character that's essentially Myles with a wicked edge. He effortlessly switches between simpering and sadistic without skipping a beat.  His counter is less compelling, if only because his role consists of swearing, shouting, and stomping around in frustration.John Taylor's (Clayne Crawford) flashbacks introduce a third character who complicates the film in ways that aren't always positive. Simone's (Meghan Perry) machinations are only slightly less believable than our host, which starts to really test the audience's patience.  The plot also tries hard to make both main characters a little more likable with mixed results.Barring some plot hole questions (what happened to Taylor's foot? How does Wilson do any work without sleeping?), ""The Perfect Host"" is a compelling psychological thriller of one-upmanship.

It certainly goes without saying that his brilliant portrayal of ""Niles"" in the television show FRASIER was consistently incredible. And his wildly successful performance in the enthusiastically acclaimed Broadway musical production of CURTAINS was thrilling to watch. But this little motion picture skillfully guides out him out of anyone's belief that he'd ever become type-casted. It grabs your undivided attention from beginning to end, causing you to marvel at how such a small-budget film can succeed at being SO entertaining in *spite* of having such a small budget.The movie is a unique, well-paced and small cast black comedy ""thriller"" wherein both male leads - Mr. Pierce and Mr. Clayne Crawford - deliver such enthralling performances that you will find yourself wondering exactly which of their two characters you ""should"" be rooting for. Rather than presenting the viewer with ""super-smooth,"" finely detailed cinematography so common among today's digitally-photographed high resolution motion pictures, this film is deliberately shot with a somewhat grainier, ""grittier"" feel. And while its supporting cast members deliver incredibly fine and properly restrained performances, the supporting male cast member portraying the character of a subordinate police detective deliberately presents his role as a cardboard character for the sole purpose of reminding you of exactly which characters you need to keep yourself focused on.

Mainly due to the fact I've never been a big fan of DHP. Never liked him on Frasier & cant say i've ever seen a film with him in it so again, had no desire or intention of watching this flick.I just happened to turn on the tv & the movie was just starting on whatever channel the tv was on when I turned it on. Before I could change the channel, my phone rang & as I spoke on the phone I watched the 1st 3 or 5 minutes. Once I hung up the phone I wanted to at least watch a few more minutes just to see what was going on with the guy & his bag & his injury.Needless to say, the next thing I knew I was halfway thru the movie & was really enjoying it so I obviously watched it all.All I can say is I was shocked out how much I enjoyed the flick. LOTS of twists & turns you simply never see coming which is always good with any flick. Far too many movies are 'predictable', but this certainly was not.Who ever thought good ole 'Niles' could not only act, but could play such a 'twisted character' & boy did he do a great job.Anyway, no spoilers here but I will say I liked the movie so much I set my DVR to record it next time its on as I really liked the movie & certainly will watch it again. To those who were like me & had no desire to watch this flick, you may want to give it a shot. I figured I would HATE it, but I actually loved it, so dont dismiss this flick.....watch it yourself & see if YOU liked it. Im thrilled I watched it by 'accident' as had it not just been starting & had my phone not rang, I would not have watched it & im very glad I did.Call it a 'TWIST' of fate that I caught this flick, & yes, pun intended for Niles who plays his 'twisted' charachter to perfection, imo.Also, big thumbs up to whoever came up with this plot/script. Just great is all I can say. Movies with ALOT more 'hoopla' dont have scripts this good with so many unpredictable twists & turns.

After realising `the feds' are on to him, he seeks refuge by going to ground. After initial lack of success he rings the doorbell of seemingly nice if slightly anal type in Warwick Wilson (David Hyde-Pierce `Frasier's brother).

1437447,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0051T47ZE,trebe,"[0, 2]","The Perfect Host (2010) is a tale of suspense involving a criminal on the run, with a couple of major twists that make it hard to say too much without spoiling the story.  Several times the film establishes a particular situation, only to radically change direction.  While these transitions and events do not make for a particularly credible story, the offbeat nature of what happens, and some strong acting performances by stars David Hyde Pierce and Clayne Crawford, make for an odd tale that mostly holds your interest, at least for one watch.  Some spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.John Taylor (Crawford) has just committed a robbery, and is wanted by the police.  With an injured foot, he wanders into a residential area looking to find some refuge.  After being turned down by a woman (former pop star Helen Reddy), he convinces her neighbor, a man named Warwick Wilson (Pierce) to let him into his home.Taylor has claimed to be an acquaintance of a friend of Wilson's, who is travelling in Australia.  Wilson, who is preparing dinner for gathering to take place at his home, plies his guest with plenty of wine, and engages in small talk about the land down under.  Taylor blows his cover when a news report about his crime comes on the radio.  He threatens his host, but before he can do anything, he falls unconscious from drinking drugged wine.When Taylor awakens, he is tied to a chair at the dinner table, as Wilson is carrying on apparently having a party with a group of imaginary guests.  When the movie assumes Wilson's point of view, the guests are visible having a good time.  But when events are seen through Taylor's eyes, Wilson appears to be interacting with no one.  Apparently quite mad, Wilson shows Taylor a photo album with pictures of abducted people, who appear to have been beaten, cut, or perhaps killed.The stage is set for some horrific acts to take place, but rather than a torture session, the film takes another radical turn, as Warwick Wilson assumes a completely new role, but one that still directly involves Taylor.  This much too convenient connection is a sticking point, as Taylor and Wilson soon cross paths again.  As things wind down, it appears that suspicion has fallen on the clever and confident Mr. Warwick Wilson, but whether he will pay for his crimes remains in doubt.The writing displays a certain degree of cleverness, but the gaps and flaws in this unconventional crime drama are difficult to overcome.  Clayne Crawford gives a strong performance, but it's remarkable the way his character seems to take in stride whatever happens, no matter how weird.  David Hyde Pierce's edgy performance is entertaining, and makes the movie fun to watch.  Familiar to many for his work on the TV series Frasier, he seems a very natural fit playing a highly intelligent, but mentally unbalanced jumpy type, and the way he ambles along is another engaging quirk.The Perfect Host is uneven, and doesn't quite pull things together, leaving the viewer to accept Warwick Wilson for the strange fellow that he is.  With some tense moments, the movie is an interesting although not entirely satisfying watch.",3,red or white wine with your thriller?...,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,3152,"['Perfect', 'Host', '2010', 'tale', 'suspense', 'involving', 'criminal', 'run', 'couple', 'major', 'twists', 'make', 'hard', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'spoiling', 'story', 'Several', 'times', 'film', 'particular', 'situation', 'only', 'radically', 'change', 'direction', 'transitions', 'events', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'particularly', 'credible', 'story', 'offbeat', 'nature', 'what', 'strong', 'acting', 'performances', 'stars', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'make', 'odd', 'tale', 'mostly', 'interest', 'least', 'one', 'watch', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'proceed', 'will.John', 'Taylor', 'Crawford', 'just', 'committed', 'robbery', 'wanted', 'police', 'injured', 'foot', 'residential', 'area', 'looking', 'find', 'refuge', 'being', 'turned', 'down', 'woman', 'former', 'pop', 'star', 'Helen', 'Reddy', 'neighbor', 'man', 'named', 'Warwick', 'Wilson', 'Pierce', 'let', 'home.Taylor', 'claimed', 'be', 'acquaintance', 'friend', 'Wilson', 'who', 'travelling', 'Australia', 'Wilson', 'who', 'preparing', 'dinner', 'gathering', 'take', 'place', 'home', 'guest', 'plenty', 'wine', 'small', 'talk', 'land', 'down', 'Taylor', 'cover', 'when', 'news', 'report', 'crime', 'radio', 'host', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'unconscious', 'drinking', 'drugged', 'wine.When', 'Taylor', 'tied', 'chair', 'dinner', 'table', 'Wilson', 'carrying', 'apparently', 'having', 'party', 'group', 'imaginary', 'guests', 'When', 'movie', 'Wilson', 'point', 'view', 'guests', 'are', 'visible', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'when', 'events', 'are', 'seen', 'Taylor', 'eyes', 'Wilson', 'be', 'interacting', 'one', 'Apparently', 'quite', 'mad', 'Wilson', 'Taylor', 'photo', 'album', 'pictures', 'abducted', 'people', 'who', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'beaten', 'cut', 'perhaps', 'killed.The', 'stage', 'set', 'horrific', 'acts', 'take', 'place', 'rather', 'torture', 'session', 'film', 'radical', 'turn', 'Warwick', 'Wilson', 'completely', 'new', 'role', 'one', 'still', 'directly', 'Taylor', 'much', 'too', 'convenient', 'connection', 'sticking', 'point', 'Taylor', 'Wilson', 'soon', 'cross', 'paths', 'again', 'things', 'wind', 'down', 'suspicion', 'fallen', 'clever', 'confident', 'Mr.', 'Warwick', 'Wilson', 'will', 'pay', 'crimes', 'doubt.The', 'writing', 'certain', 'degree', 'cleverness', 'gaps', 'flaws', 'unconventional', 'crime', 'drama', 'are', 'difficult', 'overcome', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'strong', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'way', 'character', 'take', 'stride', 'happens', 'matter', 'how', 'weird', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'edgy', 'performance', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'Familiar', 'many', 'work', 'TV', 'series', 'Frasier', 'very', 'natural', 'fit', 'playing', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'jumpy', 'type', 'way', 'along', 'engaging', 'quirk.The', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'uneven', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'things', 'together', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'accept', 'Warwick', 'Wilson', 'strange', 'fellow', 'tense', 'moments', 'movie', 'interesting', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'watch']",N/A

To find a place where he can hide temporarily from the police, John cons his way into the house of Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce), a mild-mannered, middle-aged man living in a big and comfortable house in a suburb. What John Taylor didn't know is that the house's host was preparing a dinner party. And kind and polite Warwick Wilson is ""the perfect host"" of the very strange dinner party John has to join.First, let me say that if you are looking for gory horror movies like ""Hostel,"" this movie is not for you. (The film's trailer is a bit misleading.) Violence is included in ""The Perfect Host,"" but the thriller - I think it should be called a thriller - has also some off-kilter comedic elements.The best part of ""The Perfect Host,"" Australian writer/director Nick Tomnay's feature debut, is David Hyde Pierce as nice and polite Warwick Wilson, who slowly reveals his true colors. Clayne Crawford is also effective as the criminal who has to deal with the very unusual situations around him.However, the film feels padded even at 93 minutes. (""The Perfect Host"" is based on a 2001 short film by the same director.) Not every action takes place inside of Warwick's home, which weakens the intriguing premise considerably.

1437451,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0051T47ZE,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 4]","""The Perfect Host"" may not be the perfect movie but it's darn entertaining particularly when David Hyde Pierce dominates the movie (which is most of the movie). ""The Perfect Host"" moves from a suspense thriller into a black comedy fairly quickly and the cast does their nimble best to keep up with the shifting tone. There are a couple of twists in the movie and, if you buy them, you'll enjoy the movie more than less.John Taylor (Clayne Crawford)a bank robber on the run from the police cons his way into the home of Warrick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce)unaware that Warrick who is hosting a dinner party that night isn't mentally there. The tone shifts and rather than Taylor being the cat preying on an innocent homeowner, he finds the tables turned.The Blu-ray was shot in digital with the Red One camera which results in a presentation that doesn't have as much depth as I'd like although blacks are pretty solid throughout and color--although muted--is consistent as well. The meager bit rate probably doesn't do the film any favors considering how short the movie is, you'd expect this to be at a higher bit rate.The lossless audio sounds quite good although you should keep in mind that this is primarily a dialogue driven movie it does come alive during the party scenes where music is blasted at full volume.The special features are on the lean side. Co-writer and director Nick Tomnay discusses his decision to expand his 25 minute black and white short film into a feature film and working with a low budget often having to DIY most of the stuff including editing the film on weekends.The second featurette was clearly created as a promo piece to entice viewers to see the film and it's quite good as summarizing the plot and appealing to those who haven't seen the film. We also get a couple of previews and the trailer for the film which interested me in seeing this initially.It's a pity that the film doesn't include the original 25 minute film that the director made. It would have been fascinating to compare the two and even see how they compliment each other.The performances by Crawford and Pierce as mentioned are marvelous and provide much of the fuel that makes the film chug along. The somewhat clumsy introduction of the subplot involving the police looking for Taylor would probably have worked if it had been more carefully introduced into the film. As it is the two strands run parallel without truly intersecting until the very end of the story for the pay off twist ending. There's a lot of potential in the story some of it realized nicely (the main story thread) and some of it not so much (the subplot involving the police).Although it's not a perfect film, ""The Perfect Host"" will do a good job of keeping you entertained but like a party the last act veers out of control a bit appearing a bit tacked on.I'd still recommend ""The Perfect Host"" for rental. 3 1/2 stars",3,Entertaining movie that benefits from a fun performance from Pierce,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,2900,"['Perfect', 'Host', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'movie', 'darn', 'entertaining', 'particularly', 'when', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'movie', 'most', 'movie', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'black', 'comedy', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'cast', 'nimble', 'best', 'keep', 'up', 'shifting', 'tone', 'are', 'couple', 'twists', 'movie', 'buy', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'less.John', 'Taylor', 'Clayne', 'Crawford', 'bank', 'robber', 'run', 'police', 'cons', 'way', 'home', 'Warrick', 'Wilson', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'unaware', 'Warrick', 'who', 'hosting', 'dinner', 'party', 'night', ""n't"", 'mentally', 'there', 'tone', 'shifts', 'rather', 'Taylor', 'being', 'cat', 'preying', 'innocent', 'homeowner', 'tables', 'turned.The', 'Blu-ray', 'was', 'shot', 'digital', 'Red', 'One', 'camera', 'results', 'presentation', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'depth', ""'d"", 'like', 'blacks', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'color', 'muted', 'consistent', 'as', 'well', 'meager', 'bit', 'rate', 'probably', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'favors', 'considering', 'how', 'short', 'movie', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'higher', 'bit', 'rate.The', 'lossless', 'audio', 'quite', 'good', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'primarily', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'movie', 'come', 'alive', 'party', 'scenes', 'where', 'music', 'blasted', 'full', 'volume.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'lean', 'side', 'Co-writer', 'director', 'Nick', 'Tomnay', 'decision', 'expand', '25', 'minute', 'black', 'white', 'short', 'film', 'feature', 'film', 'working', 'low', 'budget', 'often', 'having', 'DIY', 'most', 'stuff', 'including', 'editing', 'film', 'weekends.The', 'second', 'featurette', 'was', 'clearly', 'created', 'promo', 'piece', 'entice', 'viewers', 'see', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'summarizing', 'plot', 'appealing', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'couple', 'previews', 'trailer', 'film', 'interested', 'seeing', 'initially.It', 'pity', 'film', ""n't"", 'include', 'original', '25', 'minute', 'film', 'director', 'made', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'compare', 'two', 'even', 'see', 'how', 'compliment', 'other.The', 'performances', 'Crawford', 'Pierce', 'mentioned', 'are', 'marvelous', 'provide', 'much', 'fuel', 'film', 'chug', 'along', 'somewhat', 'clumsy', 'introduction', 'subplot', 'involving', 'police', 'looking', 'Taylor', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'worked', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'carefully', 'introduced', 'film', 'two', 'strands', 'run', 'parallel', 'truly', 'intersecting', 'very', 'end', 'story', 'pay', 'off', 'twist', 'ending', 'lot', 'potential', 'story', 'realized', 'nicely', 'main', 'story', 'thread', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'subplot', 'involving', 'police', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'will', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'entertained', 'party', 'last', 'act', 'veers', 'control', 'bit', 'appearing', 'bit', 'tacked', 'on.I', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'Perfect', 'Host', 'rental', '3', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A
