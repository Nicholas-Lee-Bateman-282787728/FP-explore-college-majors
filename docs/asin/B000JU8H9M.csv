1029292,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000JU8H9M,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 3]","`Miracle in the Rain' is a could-be classic.  Off the radar screen, `Miracle...' is an offbeat adventure, celebrating ordinary people coming to life when able to do so.  Both romantic and religious, it stars Jane Wyman in a remarkable performance as Ruth Wood, a spinster caught in life's dreary web.  She meets Private Art Huegenot (played with lively spirit by Van Johnson*--not my favorite actor--in a role of a lifetime.)  The developments are life-changing and exuberant.The story begins with Ruth going to work.  Quiet, she works in an office with a blond bombshell who makes out with the boss in his office.  Nearby, a young man keeps a map in front and keeps track of the raging war.  And as a consolation, a kindly woman offers to take the edge off of Ruth's solitary existence.  Later, in a New York rainstorm, she bumps into Private Art, who, given a pass to enjoy the city, can only glower about rain and everything else.  Charming the socks off Ruth, who knows nothing but her day job and her night support of her ailing and abandoned mother, he convinces her to let him show her the town she`s never seen before.  Cautiously, she warms up to him.  When there's freedom at point zero, both the colorful extravert and the shy recluse hit it off.  Then, the specter of war looms over them both.  Having lost her father who abandoned both her mother and herself, she can only feel bitterly cheated, missing out on a brief awakening in her sadly pedestrian life.  The movie interweaves the stories skillfully many years before modern movies like today do.`Miracle in the Rain' deserves to be unearthed by classic movie fans.  At first the characters and development are genuine and believable.  Later, a good film becomes a fine one with loose ends coming together and a satisfying resolution for those who love old-fashioned movies.  Rent or buy 'Miracle in the Rain,' and it could the next 'It's a Wonderful Life'.*Johnson often played the stock garrulous roles.

1029293,A5KI6YH8EJV3C,B000JU8H9M,"50 Somethin' Pop Pundit ""Old school arbiter o...","[2, 2]","I write this review on the news day that Van Johnson left us at 92. Don't bother with critics who herald his more well known films. This is a career performance, his best role ever. There's an all too convincing innocence complimented by sweet co-star Jane Wyman that just gets to you in deep poignant places that other poorly cast films don't dare to tread.Wyman stars as a sad, lonely lady lost in the big city in unconscious quest of romantic self fulfillment. Johnson is her dashingly positive upbeat foil who wins her heart just before he goes to war. And that she should lose him makes this a retro reality show for the old adage that life is often what happens to you when you're busy making other plans.Johnson was a leading man and Wyman his leading lady in a day and age when there was still room for shmaltz and sentimentality in American cinema because the ranks of the Hollywood film community were seasoned by less cynicism and more idealism. And that such a mindset depicts a sad love affair is testament to the power of faith or hope vs. despair.This doomed love story features a spiritual combination of religious and supernatural plot twists that set it apart from other romances made in the 50s. People unable to deal with sadness in cinema are cautioned to pass on this. But for those who like their entertainment to express a full range of emotional experience, this film is a heart wrenching epic.Again, let me stress easy-going film fans of comedy relief or cut and dried happy endings will not appreciate or understand this offbeat tale. It takes a bold soul to deal with the brief bliss and eternal sorrow of two star crossed lovers whose fate makes the film but breaks your heart.

I'll be back as if I'd never left you."" -- Van JohnsonJane Wyman is wonderful as a lonely woman brought to life by the unexpected attention of soldier Van Johnson in this tender soaper. Though it doesn't have quite the charm of ""The Clock"" with Garland and Walker, there is something very real and ultimately moving about this bittersweet story of falliing in love during wartime.Ruthie (Wyman) lives in New York where she takes care of her heartbroken mother, still shell-shocked years after Ruthie's father called one night to say he was leaving. It has not allowed the sweet Ruthie much of a life outside her job and mother. When she meets a soldier in an elevator named Art (Van Johnson), his warm and friendly manner is just the right medicine for Ruthie, who's never really been noticed.Johnson really shines in a role tailor-made for his boyish charm. He is lonely too, and masks his need with constant chatter so that Ruthie can't tell him to go away. Art sort of invites himself to dinner and over the next two days they paint a  picture of love's transforming magic, which does not always take huge amounts of time. It is a picture painted on a canvas of fresh grass in Central Park, boat races, and a city made for falling in love.When Art's 153rd is slated to pull out, however, their happiness is interrupted. It is the small touches, such as Ruthie's pride in a story Art gets publised in the paper, and a truck full of soldiers yelling goodbye to Ruthie when Art leaves that make this film rise above its soap opera origins. Ben Hecht's script, based on his own story, doesn't hurt either. A lovely and subtle score by Franz Waxman adds just the right mood to this special film.Writing Art every day until he can write her back, a letter finally arrives for a lonely Ruthie, waiting for the voice and words which will make her heart live again. To reveal more would be unforgivable to anyone with a romantic heart who hasn't seen this yet. I can only say that a scene in the rain is a poignant moment never forgotten by those who have seen it, either recently or years ago.A great cast gives Johnson and Wyman the room they need for two lost souls to find each other.

You know, the stuff that Bette Davis and Joan Crawford seemed to have a patent on in the early to mid-40's. I am continually telling my like-minded friends that Hollywood stopped making 3+ hanky movies after 1949. (Not a completely true statement on my part, but def. a heart felt one as I really like the oldies the best).Well, I somewhat reluctantly settled back with this dvd and a bowl of popcorn on a snowy day in Chicago and the flood gates just opened up. I yanked the box of Kleenex out and cried through at least half the movie. As wonderful as Jane Wyman was in Johnny Belinda, I really think this is as good or possibly even better a movie because of her sensitive performance. Wyman just seems to have this innate ability to act with her expressive face. She doesn't need a lot of dialogue or hysteria. Wow, what a scene stealer! As for the other players, Van Johnson delivers his usual stellar performance as the nice, 'gee whiz' sort of young man that he seemingly had the corner on in all the old MGM movies he was in and Eileen Heckert is great as Wyman's friend. Still this is a Wyman movie, no doubt about it.As for the quality of the print, it was very good. My only question was why did this movie languish in an underground vault (apparently unviewed for so many years)? I have to assume that the powers-that-be knew they were sitting on a gold mine that was just waiting for the advent of home video.Anyway, make sure you have a full box of Kleenex before you sit down to watch this one so you won't have to stop it midway into the movie.",5,"Pull Out The Kleenex, Honey",1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,1585,"['just', 'love', 'weepers', 'know', 'stuff', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'seemed', 'have', 'patent', 'early', 'mid-40', 'am', 'continually', 'telling', 'like-minded', 'friends', 'Hollywood', 'stopped', 'making', '3+', 'hanky', 'movies', '1949', 'Not', 'completely', 'true', 'statement', 'part', 'def', 'heart', 'felt', 'one', 'really', 'oldies', 'best', '.Well', 'somewhat', 'reluctantly', 'settled', 'back', 'dvd', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'snowy', 'day', 'Chicago', 'flood', 'just', 'opened', 'up', 'yanked', 'box', 'Kleenex', 'cried', 'least', 'movie', 'As', 'wonderful', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', 'really', 'think', 'as', 'good', 'possibly', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'Wyman', 'just', 'have', 'innate', 'ability', 'act', 'expressive', 'face', ""n't"", 'need', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'hysteria', 'Wow', 'what', 'scene', 'stealer', 'other', 'players', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'usual', 'stellar', 'performance', 'nice', ""'gee"", 'whiz', 'sort', 'young', 'man', 'seemingly', 'had', 'corner', 'old', 'MGM', 'movies', 'was', 'Eileen', 'Heckert', 'great', 'Wyman', 'friend', 'Still', 'Wyman', 'movie', 'doubt', 'it.As', 'quality', 'print', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'question', 'was', 'why', 'did', 'movie', 'languish', 'underground', 'vault', 'apparently', 'unviewed', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'assume', 'powers-that-be', 'knew', 'were', 'sitting', 'gold', 'mine', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'advent', 'home', 'video.Anyway', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'full', 'box', 'Kleenex', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'one', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'stop', 'midway', 'movie']",Miracle in the Rain

She's a plain Jane with no life other than work and taking care of her sick mother. He's a lonely soldier on leave. Meeting Arther changes Ruth's life (it gives her one). In the short time they see each other, they fall in love. Arthur gives Ruth an engagement ring (his mother's) just as he leaves for war. And then, life happens.Wonderful performances from everyone.

A sincere, beautifully acted and photographed melodrama in the classical style, ""Miracle in the Rain"" should please fans of these things. Jane Wyman is wonderful, and her prayer scene in St. Patrick's cathedral, after her lover departs, is a gem. That the film wanders for a while and takes too many side roads is forgivable, considering the impact and mysticism of the final scene, which fans will remember fondly and which I won't spoil here. The print on this DVD is fine, and the image crisp and sharp (though it looks as if they've used the Lucille Ball ""Mame"" filter on all of Wyman's close-ups). Perhaps it's not all you've heard it to be, but still well worth a look for its unabashed sentiment and stylish presentation.

Ruth (Jane Wyman) works in an office and lives with her mother. Her father ran away when she was younger, and her mother desperately hopes for his return. As a result, she warns Ruth away from men, but they prove to be unavoidable. A solider on leave, Art Hugenon, stumbles upon her in the rain one day. He tags along to her home for dinner and spends the next few days taking her to the park, out to dinner, and anywhere else she wants to go. He is called to battle sooner than he had hoped, but leaves an engagement ring with Ruth and a promise of his love for her.This is not your typical wartime romance; it is much more realistic than a film like The Clock with Judy Garland. However, it retains the classic movie touch that makes it a million times more emotional and memorable than any movie made today. The two stars are wonderful in their parts. Wyman says so much without uttering a word, and Johnson's boyish charms leave no one guessing as to how Ruth could fall so quickly.There are some wonderful extra features included here like a short about how film is processed and another that visits the set of this movie and interviews its stars.
