To say it was quirky is an understatement.The series primarily takes place at Crane, Poole, and Schmidt, a huge law firm with the main players being William Shatner's egomanical Senior Partner Denny Crane with his ""Mad Cow"" disease, overactive libido, and gun fetish coupled with James Spader's ""skirt chasing"" attorney Alan Shore, then Candice Bergen adding the frosting on the cake as Shirley Schmidt, the one sane mind in the entire firm, who was once married to Shatner's character, who still fantasizes about her at every opportunity.The story lines are so improbable as to make you scratch your head and wonder how the writers could even imagine them (think Betty White as a serial murderer who gets off three times?) and then suddenly Alan or Shirley will be in a court room with a closing argument that makes you stop and actually THINK about what may have been a relevant issue in our lives:  air or ground-water pollution by huge chemical companies for instance or tobacco companies being sued because someone died from lung cancer after smoking their cigarettes for 40 years.The closing scenes in every episode with Denny and Alan out on the balcony smoking their cigars and drinking cognac while reflecting on their day in court (or life in general as they see it) are gems all by themselves.Get the whole set -- I bet you won't be able to stop watching.

A real lawyer who got hired by genius writer-producer Steve Bochco (Hill Street Blues, LA Law, NYPD Blue).  Boston Legal is IRREVELENCE to the maximum!  An 0ff-shoot of the more serious The Practice (which I never got into, too serious) James Spader (Stargate the movie and more recently NBCs BLACKLIST) teams up with William Shatner (I am NOT Captain Kirk, I am Denny Crane and you're not!). Candace Bergen (I am NOT Murphy Brown, I am Ms. Schmidt and don't call me Shirley), John (I wish I was a Loofa) Laroquette and incidental characters like,Betty (Serial Killer) White, Roma Mafia, Henry Gibson, my friend Frank (I know you think I'm a hack actor) Birney.  Dialog like:  (Opposing lawyer):  You did go to law school didn't you?  Spader replying): Actually I got my degree on the Internet.  Shatner (To Shirley's 17 year old grand-daughter):  You're as hot as grand ma (Shirley) are you as dirty?  Shirley's grand daughter (to Shirley): you were a suffragette, weren't you?  Shirley (To her grand daughter) How OLD do you think I am!?  Leave.  Through the windows, it's faster!  They take unwinnable cases before judges including the Supreme Court of the US.  They take ridiculous cases, like Denny Crane pulling an illegal concelled weapon and shooting a black man.  And him being defended using the Supreme Court ruling on the 2nd amendement.  This series is a send up of LAW, LAWYERS and TV SHOWS, NETWORKS and SCHEDULING (Schatner to Spader as Denny Crane to Alan Shore &#34;There must be some time slots we haven't used yet!&#34;  If YOU truly believe that all the lawyers in the world should be sent into the OCEAN to drown then Denny Crane and Alan Shore must lead the pack and they RULE this show!  At the end of each show they sit on the balcony with Scotch whiskey and smelly cigars talking about Shirley Schmidt's Cheer Leader uniform from High School and all Denny can think about is Crane in POOLE with Schmidt!  This show is to TV what M*A*S*H was to Theatrical MOVIES.  This is Comedy/Drama of the ABSURD and David Kelley takes on EVERY taboo law case known to Man with Denny Crane and Alan Shore confronting the US Supreme Court without a CARE in the world!  When all is said and done Denny and Alan have but ONE thought and that is to see Shirley in all her spendor to which Candace Bergen (Shirley) can't stop laughing about!  The pervert lawyers at Crane, Poole and Schmidt aim to damp out racism, sexism, homophobia, government spying,false imprisonment, underage voting, under IQ death sentences and every other liberal cause you can think of from happening while they dwell on what it's like to lift Shirley's cheer leader skirt!

This exquisitely written series starring James Spader as the brilliant but naughty Alan Shore and William Shatner as Denny Crane one of the founders of the law firm of Crane, Poole, and Schmidt.  I don't know how David E. Kelley and the other writers slept while they were creating the situations that they put the characters in each week.  Their brains must have been firing non-stop!  My favorite part of each episode is when Alan Shore gives one of his summations.  He takes on the Establishment in whatever form it has taken that week and exposes the truth.  Despite his other issues, Alan Shore is a spokesman for the little guy.

In particular, one shouldfollow the development of the friendship between the characters played byJames Spader and William Shatner, one of the unique ones in television history. But thereis a lot of action in the development of the lawyer with Asperger's Syndrome; he may driveyou crazy with his idiotic gestures and noises, but his journey is really quite touching.Betty White's subplot--she's a serial murderess; and that's not a spoiler, because the showis quite open about it from the start--is also interesting, though it's played for comedy.There is a lot of sociopolitical material here, a lot of it extremely edgy. Most of it isleftist-driven, but at one point a gay organization tries to stop two men from marryingbecause their reasons ""aren't good enough""--a shocking reversal of what one might expecton the subject of marriage equality. Still, the show is very briskly paced and the scriptsare extremely smart, because so many of the characters are top-notch lawyers who can wineven difficult cases.

He is obnoxious and of course his Alzheimer disease is an excuse for him being so rude.  Crane's love of women is hilarious whereas James Spader's character (Alan Shore) love of women is just gross and over the top.The only two downfalls of the show is Alan Shore's relentless pursuit of woman and that in every season they introduce new characters that you get attached to and then in the next season you never see or hear about them again.Overall, this is a really good series that is sure to make you laugh and think at the same time.

This is the only TV series that I own or desire to own.  The writing was well done.  The topics were thought provoking.  And it kept up with current events.  In some ways this reflects the history of issues in our country during the period in which it was filmed.  And what a better way to preserve history--through crazy, thought provoking humor.  My favorite show was the last episode but I can't think of an episode I didn't like.  For me, this series even made me sometimes view the world differently, even if i wasn't aware of it at the time.  Just a couple of days ago, I was in a store where a man had a ""tick"" and made some kind of funny noise.  I just turned to my friend and said, ""he squeeks"".  It seems like a simple thing, but before I would have been uncomfortable or even made a joke at the persons expense.  i guess some people might think that comment is a joke--but if they knew this series they would know it was much more of an acceptance and statement of fact.One other thing that I love about this series is that it doesn't seem to matter which side of an issue you are on  or what your political affiliation is.  Or at least in my family.  I have a sister who is polar opposite of me when it comes to politics--but we both loved this show.  I think when a show can do that, it is magical because more people are able to listen to both sides of an issue when it is presented in a fun way.If you loved this series, you will of course love this DVD set.
