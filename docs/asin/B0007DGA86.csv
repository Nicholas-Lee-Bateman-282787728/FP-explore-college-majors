880499,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0007DGA86,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","""Whatya got to eat?"" asks Bob Ford, who backshot his great friend Jesse James not too long ago. Says Joe, the bartender at the Silver King Saloon in Creede, Colorado, ""Sweet corn, cornmeal mush, cornpone with cracklins and corn whiskey."" ""I'll have it,"" says Bob.Lukewarm corn, cooked ambitiously, is about all there is in Sam Fuller's debut as a director. Fuller had been writing scripts and story outlines in Hollywood for quite awhile. Finally he made a three-movie deal with a B movie producer: If I can direct the movies, and I won't charge you, I'll write the screenplays.The first of the three, I Shot Jesse James, is a potentially intriguing story of a loser, but told with a script that has little tension, directed with little flair and acted, for the most part, with a dull, steady cadence. A good deal of the dialogue and many of the actors are just competent. Still, if you're a Fuller fan, I Killed Jesse James may be worth watching. It's part of Criterion'sEclipse Series 5 - The First Films of Samuel Fuller. The set includes The Baron of Arizona and Steel Helmet.Fuller, in my view, was not one of the great directors (or screenwriters; he usually wrote his own screenplays). He wasn't one of the great craftsmen, either. What he had was a tough, knock-about personal story, a confident willingness to dance to his own music, a streak of subversiveness that could undermine the fatuousness of Hollywood, the establishment and the nervous, and enough talent to take the commonplace material and actors he often was dealt and turn at least parts of his movies into something to admire. He was the kind of Hollywood non-Hollywood director that some cineastes and film critics adore. It would take a person wearing blinders, however, not to recognize that his movies are, at best, variable. Most of them don't hold up very well unless the viewer has been first captured by Sam Fuller's iconic anti-establishment reputation.Pickup on South Streetis probably his best work, with fine performances by an A-level cast, an unusual script considering it was originally intended as an anti-Commie screed, and a story that Fuller keeps moving along.The Big Red One, highly praised by many, is an effective and realistic war movie dear to Fuller's heart. But it seems (to me) to go indulgently on and on and on.For the rest of his movies, those that I've seen, there's just excellent bits and pieces mixed into a B-movie sensibility, awkward dialogue (almost any scenes involving a man and woman), and too much discursiveness. Fuller, in my opinion, needed a strong editor to work with and a strong writer with whom to collaborate. I have a feeling that Fuller would find either prospect completely unsatisfactory.Shock CorridorandThe Naked Kiss, anointed by Criterion, for me aren't just pulp movies, they're almost embarrassing examples of overwrought pulp movies. This is all just opinion. Watch The Naked Kiss and see what you think.But back to I Shot Jesse James. When Bob Ford (John Ireland) puts a bullet in the back of his friend, Jesse James, Ford hopes to gain amnesty and a large reward. He'd been befriended by James and had been part of James' gang. Ford wants to marry the love of his life, the singer Cynthy Waters (Barbara Britton). He thinks he can leave the criminal life and settle down with Cynthy. Instead she rejects him. He's called a coward and a backshooter. Most people hold him in contempt. He gets only a small part of the reward. He still thinks that if only he can make money he can win Cynthy. And there's that straight talkin' guy who likes Cynthy, too, a man named John Kelley (Preston Foster, top billed) who keeps showing up. There's a showdown, and that's that.John Ireland, in my view, had a lot of screen presence, but he needed a good script and strong direction to be at his best. Just watch him as Fantail inRaw Deal(1948), as Cherry Valance inRed River(1948) and as Jack Burden inAll the King's Men(1949). Even in a piece of Brit noir schlock,The Glass Tomb(1955), he brings enough quality and interest to make it worth watching. Here, he's constrained by an uninspired script that gives him no opportunity to do anything but show what a sad sack loser Bob Ford is. But wait until that showdown. It only lasts a couple of minutes, but John Ireland shows what he can do.",3,"Sam Fuller's first movie he directed.

880503,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B0007DGA86,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 1]","Samuel Fuller was, no question, one of the great American originals, completely inimitable (and perhaps indescribable, at times).  This, his first feature, opens on a stark tableau: bank robbers and bank employees, tensely standing each other off, the robbers hesitating to shoot while the tellers try to waste their time. A signal is tripped, a siren blares, a shootout occurs, a bandit is wounded and a teller killed -- all in less than a minute. Jesse James (Reed Hadley, fine here in a rare lead role) and his henchman Bob Ford (John Ireland) escape, James saving Ford's life and in typical Fuller fashion, foreshadowing his own doom as he tells Ford that now he's ""responsible"" for him.This has little to do with what is known of the real James and Ford brothers; it seems pretty hard to believe that rural/western born Jesse was the cultured gentleman he acts in the early part of this film, and the later scenes of Ford and John (later Marshall John) Kelley bear scant resemblance to the historical record; no matter though if you're more interested in the taut, exciting storyline that Fuller has crafted - and, let's face it, the western genre, and the Jesse James story in particular, have rarely been well-served in the area of ""accuracy.""  Jesse lasts just a few minutes onscreen, and then it's Ford's turn to play on our sympathies as his cowardly actions haunt him for the rest of the film, and he tries to no avail to redeem himself in the eyes of his sweetheart, Cynthy, who we know instinctively will wait for him -- only so far.Many of Fuller's trademarks are already in place: hard-bitten dialogue (though not so outlandish and over-the-top here as it would be in some later films), fairly heavy use of wide-eyed close-ups, and an in-your-face, blunt yellow journalistic style that on first glance may seem to admit little subtlety. Poke around a little though and you'll find a lot of complexity in the character of Bob Ford, especially, and a fairly ambiguous attitude about both vigilantism and honor. The acting is surprisingly solid here given Fuller's penchant for picking hammy players, though only Preston Foster as Kelley seemed entirely at home.This ol' VHS is all right, though you'd be better served getting the Criterion Eclipse set that also includes the even better BARON OF ARIZONA (another western) and the Korean war film THE STEEL HELMET.",4,Enter the tough as nails world of Sam Fuller for the first time in this cheap but interesting western,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,2376,"['Samuel', 'Fuller', 'was', 'question', 'one', 'great', 'American', 'originals', 'completely', 'inimitable', 'perhaps', 'indescribable', 'times', 'first', 'feature', 'stark', 'tableau', 'bank', 'robbers', 'bank', 'employees', 'tensely', 'standing', 'other', 'off', 'robbers', 'hesitating', 'shoot', 'tellers', 'try', 'waste', 'time', 'signal', 'tripped', 'siren', 'shootout', 'bandit', 'wounded', 'teller', 'killed', 'less', 'minute', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Reed', 'Hadley', 'fine', 'here', 'rare', 'lead', 'role', 'henchman', 'Bob', 'Ford', 'John', 'Ireland', 'escape', 'James', 'saving', 'Ford', 'life', 'typical', 'Fuller', 'fashion', 'foreshadowing', 'own', 'doom', 'Ford', 'now', 'responsible', 'him.This', 'little', 'do', 'what', 'known', 'real', 'James', 'Ford', 'brothers', 'pretty', 'hard', 'believe', 'rural/western', 'born', 'Jesse', 'was', 'cultured', 'gentleman', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'later', 'scenes', 'Ford', 'John', 'later', 'Marshall', 'John', 'Kelley', 'bear', 'scant', 'resemblance', 'historical', 'record', 'matter', ""'re"", 'more', 'interested', 'taut', 'exciting', 'storyline', 'Fuller', 'crafted', 'let', 'face', 'western', 'genre', 'Jesse', 'James', 'story', 'particular', 'have', 'rarely', 'been', 'well-served', 'area', 'accuracy', 'Jesse', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'onscreen', 'then', 'Ford', 'turn', 'play', 'sympathies', 'cowardly', 'actions', 'haunt', 'rest', 'film', 'avail', 'redeem', 'eyes', 'sweetheart', 'Cynthy', 'who', 'know', 'instinctively', 'will', 'wait', 'only', 'so', 'far.Many', 'Fuller', 'trademarks', 'are', 'already', 'place', 'hard-bitten', 'dialogue', 'not', 'so', 'outlandish', 'over-the-top', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'later', 'films', 'fairly', 'heavy', 'use', 'wide-eyed', 'close-ups', 'in-your-face', 'blunt', 'yellow', 'journalistic', 'style', 'first', 'glance', 'may', 'seem', 'admit', 'little', 'subtlety', 'Poke', 'little', 'though', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'complexity', 'character', 'Bob', 'Ford', 'especially', 'fairly', 'ambiguous', 'attitude', 'vigilantism', 'honor', 'acting', 'surprisingly', 'solid', 'here', 'given', 'Fuller', 'penchant', 'picking', 'hammy', 'players', 'only', 'Preston', 'Foster', 'Kelley', 'seemed', 'entirely', 'home.This', 'ol', 'VHS', 'right', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'served', 'getting', 'Criterion', 'Eclipse', 'set', 'also', 'even', 'better', 'BARON', 'OF', 'ARIZONA', 'western', 'Korean', 'war', 'film', 'THE', 'STEEL', 'HELMET']",N/A

The film focuses on Robert Ford (John Ireland), the man who was a part of Jesse James' robbery gang and who eventually killed him.  Ford was a controversial man and was often depicted as a coward for shooting his friend James in the back and collecting a reward for his death.  Apparently, Ford thought these actions would make him a hero, but he ended up having a rather miserable life afterwards, including a humiliating stint as an ""actor"" who re-enacted the shooting of James on stage nightly.The story of Robert Ford is an interesting one, and the film sticks pretty close to the truth - only the last 15 minute or so strays from the facts.  Unfortunately, ""I Shot Jess James"" is rather pedestrian and without much life; the acting is no better than average, and Ireland makes a bland anti-hero.  Robert Ford's story is told much better in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"" with Casey Affleck scoring as Ford.  Even with such a brief runtime (81 minutes), I found my attention wandering when watching this competent but rather boring Western.
