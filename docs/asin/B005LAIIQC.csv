I talk about some things you might not want to read.Action: BThe pace of the movie was all wrong and it was way too long for what you got. Some parts really seem to drag out, and just when you think things are finally picking up, they slow down again without any heart racing climax.Music: DI don't even think it was the same soundtrack as previous movies. There were no intense moments where the music kicked in and I was like: ""Yes! This is Bourne! This moment right here is proof that this is the best spy series ever made!""Cool spy stuff: C-Remember Jason Bourne taking over the U.S. Embassy, grabbing the map, taking the earpiece, outsmarting his enemies? There weren't many of these moments which is surprising since Aaron Cross was supposed to be super smart from his brain chemicals.New Bourne: CIt is hard to judge Renner's performance because I did not like the character Aaron Cross. They gave him way too much personality. I mean come on, aren't ""assets"" supposed to be trained killer, human cyborgs with no emotions? Cross was telling jokes and he was questioning the moral implications of his orders/actions way too much. Just shut up, go into killer machine mode, and destroy everything as efficiently as possible. That's what I want to see, not your ethical growth as a character.Fight scenes: BNot as good as part 1 and 3, but way better than part 2 which had that weird camera thing going on.Chase scene: B -A few good ones, but I think the producers are starting to equate the length of the chase with the quality of the chase. The roof jumping was something we have seen before (better) in part 3. The motorcycle scene had intensity, but I was kind of disappointed when Marta killed the toughest, baddest, assassin ever trained by man. We should definitely have seen a hand-to-hand combat scene or knife fight with this guy.CIA (Or whoever they were): C -Norton was good in the beginning of the movie, but didn't bring it the second half. The woman CIA agent who takes over Landy's job of ""quarterbacking"" things gave a poor performance. I didn't find her believable at all, but that was probably because the actress playing Landy was perfect for that role. The rest of the intelligence crew seemed weak too.

1490497,A3TZLMZVP5H5J4,B005LAIIQC,Boz,"[9, 20]","I never became a Matt Damon fan until I saw the Bourne Identity. I got the box set and was impressed with how wonderfully and seamlessly they had tied all 3 different stages of his life reawakening and starting to think for himself. Damon made me a believer in his talent, the intensity in his eyes, his actions and split second timing to keep himself alive against all the power his handlers were throwing against him was amazing and of course the writers, directors and camera men were obviously working in harmony on all three movies and they all Jelled together perfectlyNow the Legacy if we are to believe it, the timeline for this story is paralleling  the time that Jason was in New York still looking for answers and trying to come in out of the cold. The script is so convoluted I could barely follow the narrative. Cold Lakes, wolves, another agent killing time in a little shack totally bored with himself and stupid enough to go back into the shack even after hearing an uninvited visitor in the sky fast approaching. And then there is Edward Norton who talks about another Black Ops project called Outcome. He is afraid everything is unraveling and that all agents still out there beside Bourne need to be eliminated. And all the originals from the Bourne movies were there, the fat old white guys talking about things that I didn't understand because unlike the Bourne movies, this project Outcome was not fleshed out enough to comprehend what they were talking about at any one moment aside from the usual double-cross. These were they guys who were worrying about Bourne but if you hadn't seen the Original Bourne they really don't seem to be acting in this movie as though there was any connection.I have seen Jeremy Renner in other films and thought he was a good actor who need to find his niche in the movie Industry. There are few actors like Gary Oldman, who can change spots at a moments notice and thats why he gets so many varied and unusual roles and does them well, sometime even without makeup you never realize its him,so well does he become his character. Remmer is not on that level. Mission Impossible, Avengers. 28 weeks later. IMHO he has talent but not fore every role and this was one of them. He was a bore, he really seemed clueless as too what was goig on. ""I fell off the Grid"" yea? and? that means what to you and the consequences. Damon seems a natural when it comes to self defense with quick lightening moves to save his skin. Renner is more the pummel punch and run, not what you expect from someone in this program, but then again he did say his I.Q. was lower then the standard requisite but they let him in anyways. Were they hard up? Dont know, I guess we dont need to know why someone who didn't measure up mentally was allowed to join a super soldier program.And what was the geek gon postal about? Psychotic break was the cover story but again we are left to guess and why wast brain power on a totally useless scene.Rachel Weisz, I dont care how you slice it, is not an actress of any caliber. From the first time I saw her in the mummy movies I thought she was great as a ditz, then she was  playing opposite grand actors like Gene Hackman and Bruce Davison in Runaway Jury, she was the same. She is going to be forever playing mediocre characters like a nurse in  Bourne Legacy, she is wooden and very unappealing all around and does not do movies any favors when she is in them.Edward Norton sounded like a cross between his American History X character and Italian Job double-crosser. He is and can be even more of an excellent performer, witness ""The illusionist"" brilliant. Here I don't know what his job was because he wasn't part of the original canon. A cut scene with him telling Aaron Cross the job they do and innocent people gettig killed. A  morality speech shoved right in the middle. Was this supposed to reveal some pathos about Aaron Cross.? Were we supposed to feel some empathy for him.  He sat there all sad and sweaty as Norton lectured him about the realities of war and the job they do.This movie should not be considered Canon in my opinion. The chase scene was the lamest I have ever seen, with some number 2  on the list with low empathy who just as bad as Cross, one of their supposed better operatives they copycat the Moroccan chase scene which was well coordinated  and just made it into a stupid chase down Manilla streets, with motorcycle jumps that were so laughable it was sad.In my final summation I think they screwed up because they didnt really know what to do with Remmer. They focused a lot of chatter on coverups and in the end you have this aborted Legacy. They should have never done this move. They should have waited and cajoled Matt Damon to come back on his terms and make another fabulous Bourne movie. This film should not be the Legacy of what happened to Jason Bourne and all others like him.",1,What a mess of a movie.,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,4897,"['never', 'became', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'fan',

1490503,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B005LAIIQC,Brian Driver,"[1, 2]","THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHlN!""The Bourne Legacy"" begins on the right note:An inert body floats on the surface of a body of water, seen from underneath--much as Matt Damon did in the opening scene of ""The Bourne Identity,"" which began the previous trilogy.But, as he abruptly dives down into arctic waters to fetch an important submerged packet we quickly see that this movie is going to be different from that one, though not overly so.  In the end, the opening scene will have let us in on that, too: we're different, but we're similar, too.First of all, this is a more than enjoyable film that is capably handled and well directed.  I did have some caveats, but you can rest assured your money will be well spent.This time around, Jeremy Renner is our ""Bourne,"" though in the name of Aaron Cross (or sometimes Number Five).  What's interesting is that this movie takes place in approximately the same time-frame of ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" the final member of the trilogy, which ended with Bourne and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, as a high up muckity muck who has been investigating CIA shenanigans) outwitting the creators of a secret corps of high dollar super soldiers tasked with black ops missions like assassinating foreign bigwigs unfavorable to the U.S., etc.  Cross is a member of Outcome, a fittingly named project in which its agents have been systematically ""enhanced"" genetically, giving them higher mental and physical performance than any previous agents have ever achieved.Including Bourne, I guess.Like the previous trilogy, the government officials in charge of these clandestine activities have grown frightened of exposure, and the movie details the officials' cold, calculated murders of Outcome operatives rather than risk their identification.  As one might guess, they let one get away, and for that they will pay dearly.I suppose, that is...as the movie doesn't show that.  In fact, while Ed Norton is, as always, terrific in the role of one of the bureau chiefs, the old cast of the ""Bourne"" trilogy simply hit their marks one by one and are dismissed, their parts probably taking up a collective minute or two of screen time.  Bourne himself (Matt Damon) was shown only in still shots--I wonder what he got paid for that?  Landy and these others (played by Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, Stacey Keech, and David Strathairn) are merely the window dressing meant to show us the tie-in is all part of the same kind of shadow government we all fear are running things anyway.As to agent Cross, Jeremy Renner looks the part and does a nice job capturing the essence of a trained killer who is as lethal with a gun as he is with a pen, a nail, or whatever else he can get his hands on.  I was a little disappointed that this movie never really tested Renner other than some very clever parkour scenes across the rooftops of Manila to rescue the female scientist who is helping him (Rachel Weisz).Toward the end of the movie, as our bureau chiefs get really nervous and demand results, they dig up an operative from a NEW government program called Larx (his number is Larx-03), and his use even draws gasps from his handlers, as we find that the Larx(ians?) are bred to be even MORE highly developed physically and have been programmed not to feel pain OR remorse.  This seems a sure setup for a great battle that will let  us check out just how good our Mr. Cross is.  Yet--and I'm not going to tell you how it ends--I was disappointed there too.All in all I felt ""The Bourne Legacy"" was a worthy spin-off, yet I don't think it really hit its stride.  It took a little too much time setting itself up, held very few real surprises, and didn't have that same improvisational cleverness that Damon's character always seemed to possess--the buffer ""MacGyver,"" if you will.But Renner looks the right man for the part.  He's got a sweet yet well-traveled face, he certainly seems to be physically capable, and he seems to have the smarts for handling a complex role--if you have any doubts, see him in ""The Hurt Locker.""  And Rachel Weisz is a fine actress, possessing the skills to be both vulnerable and competent at the same time.But the one I'm looking forward to seeing is any remnant of the Larx  program (gasp!) as his nemesis.  Maybe Larx-04 will test his mettle.Of course, we could maybe sometime see one of these Gazillion Dollar Soldiers just carry out an actual mission.  I know I'm asking a lot, but in these Recessionary times it would be nice if our Gazillion Dollar Soldiers actually stopped killing each other and actually tackled some enemy bad guys.""Bourne, Re-Born""?

1490551,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIIQC,C. Sawin,"[5, 12]","Jeremy Renner is Aaron Cross; the new Jason Bourne. It feels like Renner is trying so hard to make this character work. Cross is so sarcastic, quick witted, and smart mouthed. It's difficult not to like him and Renner does the absolute best job he can with the character. Producer Frank Marshall has been so adamant about a fifth movie possibly seeing Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner team up. The issue is ""The Bourne Legacy"" seems to be banking on that idea so much that this just feels like filler. You have this new character who knows exactly what he signed up for and realizes what can and will happen when everything goes wrong; he's essentially the exact opposite of Jason Bourne. But the Aaron Cross character doesn't really go anywhere. As soon as things finally start to get somewhat interesting, you find yourself walking out of the theater.The rest of the cast mostly just feels like they were thrown in to act astonished at Aaron Cross' actions. Edward Norton was a huge drawing factor, but really only has a few memorable one-liners. His ""moral excrement"" conversation with Cross is quite possibly the most intriguing scene in the movie though. Rachel Weisz can usually be counted on to give a great performance, as well. Her character, Dr. Marta Shearing, seems so melodramatic though. Nearly everything that happens to her before she meets up with Cross is so ridiculously overdramatic and she does nothing but cry. Thankfully, her chemistry with Jeremy Renner saves her performance from being a complete waste. Their conversation in the car as Dr. Shearing explains the specifics of the blue and green pills is fascinating and fairly intelligent.""The Bourne Legacy"" does do a few things right. It does have a few semi-long one-take shots. ""Semi-long"" meaning longer than the rest of the ridiculously fast edits scattered throughout the rest of the film. The best example is when Aaron runs up the side of a house, climbs up the roof, opens the window, gets inside the house, and immediately shoots somebody in the head. There's also this pretty great motorcycle chase that had shades of ""Terminator 2"" in it. Cross's interaction with the wolves seemed like this huge shout out to ""The Grey,"" which should only be seen as a good thing.The problem with the Bourne franchise is that the camera work is so dizzying; the camera tries to move faster than Jason Bourne or Aaron Cross does and it leaves you feeling kind of nauseous. ""The Bourne Legacy"" doesn't have an ending. Everything just stops. The biggest action sequence in the entire movie transpires, then it gives you a calm moment to catch your breath. But it doesn't follow up with anything afterward. It is pretty much left at, ""I'm just seeing what our options are."" If your movie has a bigger open ending than the average horror film, then you've got a problem.""The Bourne Legacy"" mostly just comes off feeling as disposable as the agents in the program. It's a dull excuse of a thriller that is incapable of satisfying that fictitious salivating gland deep within your soul that craves heavy action and adrenaline pumping adventure. The ball has officially been dropped.

1490567,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005LAIIQC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","For over a decade, action/thriller spy fans have been entertained by Robert Ludlum's ""Bourne"" series.Featuring a film adaptation of the trilogy (""The Bourne Identity"", 2002; ""The Bourne Supremacy"", 2004; and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", 2007) by Tony Gilroy (who co-wrote each film), it was thought by many that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" would be the final film in the series.Of course, the Bourne films were a tremendous success but by 2008, a fourth film was being planned.  But with Paul Greengrass (who directed the second and third ""Bourne"" film)  not returning as a director, actor Matt Damon said he would not do another Bourne film.But Tony Gilroy along with his brother Dan Gilroy would begin working on writing a fourth film that didn't include Jason Bourne titled ""The Bourne Legacy"".  Not wanting to re-create a Bond series with a different actor, he would only work ona fourth film if none of the original cast or filmmakers were involved.  And with the events of ""Bourne Ultimatum"", it would lead to ""Bourne Legacy"" post-Bourne.The film which was budgeted around $125 million would go on to earn over $276 million in the box office and now will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in Dec. 2012 courtesy of Universal Studios Home Entertainment.VIDEO:""The Bourne Legacy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and while watching this film, I was pleased with the clarity and detail.  Wonderful contrast and I detected no aliasing, no banding or artifacts.  No problems with the picture quality whatsoever.  Videophiles will be pleased with the overall picture quality especially the cinematography courtesy of Robert Elswit (Magnolia"", ""Michael Clayton"", ""Syriana"" and ""There Will Be Blood"").Thanks to the many gorgeous location shots and great coverage of the action sequences, ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a film that looks amazing on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Bourne Legacy"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1, DTS Digital Surround 5.1, DVS 2.0 and Espanol, Francais DTS Digital Surround 5.1.  ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a film that features plent of action and as one can imagine from a big budget action film, this film is absolutely immersive on Blu-ray.  From Aaron in the the frozen area of Alaska, the sounds of a missile being shot and a cabin being blown up, wolves growling from the distance, gun shots being pumped, a motorcycle chase-scene, a laboratory being riddled with gun shots and the ambiance of crowd scenes galore, ""The Bourne Legacy"" sounds amazing on Blu-ray, great use of surrounds for panning and directional audio and also LFE for explosions.Subtitles are in English SDH, Espanol and Francais.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Bourne Legacy"" comes with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (6:48) Featuring three deleted scenes with optional audio commentary with Director/co-writer Tony Gilroy, co-writer Dan Gilroy and director of photography Robert ElswitRe-Bourne - (6:11) A featurette about the challenge of continuing the Bourne series without Jason Bourne.Enter Aaron Cross - (7:11) A featurette with Jeremy Renner about playing the lead role of Aaron Cross.Crossing Continents - (8:22) A featurette on the various locations where ""The Bourne Legacy"" was shot.Man Vs. Wolf - (4:36) A featurette on creating the Aaron Cross vs. Wolves fight scenes and what was real and what was animatronic.Wolf Sequence Test - (1:39) The animated storyboard for the wolf attack scene.Moving Targets - (6:11) A featurette featuring the cast and crew discussing the focus on the characters of Aaron Cross and Dr. Marta Shearing.Capturing Chaos: The Motorbike Chase - (7:49) A featurette on the filming of the motorcycle chase scene.Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with Director/co-writer Tony Gilroy, co-writer Dan Gilroy, editor John Gilroy, director of photography Robert Elswit, second unit director Dan Bradley and production designer Kevin Thompson.EXTRAS:""The Bourne Legacy"" comes with the Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and UltraViolet version of the film.  Also included is a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:I have to admit that prior to the theatrical release of ""The Bourne Legacy"", I was skeptical of a film based on the Bourne Series but yet doesn't feature Jason Bourne as the primary character.  I asked myself of how would Tony and Dan Gilroy create a story without its lead character, which many of us have enjoyed!  And one can only wonder if Tony Gilroy was going to follow a similar 007 style of storyline with its treatment of the character but with a different actor.Thankfully this was not the case with ""The Bourne Legacy"" as the Gilroy brothers really planned this film out with future potential in mind.  Consider it a storyline within the world of the Bourne series, it's storyline of hidden government black ops groups, testing of soldiers using chemical pills but then the secret side of government who wants to hide any lead to this secret black ops groups by trying to eliminate those who were involved.Enter Aaron Cross, a member of the black ops group, Operation Outcome, one of the many operatives that is to be killed, so no traces of Operation Outcome can be discovered during the investigations of Operations Treadstone and Blackbriar.But due to his enhanced thinking and ability due to the pills he had been taking as part of Operation Outcome, he manages to thwart his death, but letting the retired Col. Eric Byer, USAF and his staff think that he's dead.For those who thought about comparing actor Jeremy Renner to Matt Damon in this action-role, the first half hour literally makes you forget Damon as Renner is able to show that he can do action scenes.  And it helps that his popularity as Hawkeye in the summer blockbuster ""The Avengers"" showed that he's more than capable of taking on the role as the primary operative and protagonist.With two talented actors with Renner and Edward Norton as the antagonist, the film is strengthened by its female lead, Rachel Weisz.  Playing a geneticist, Dr. Marta Shearing, fortunately this is not your banal sexpot, short-fling character.  She's a smart intelligent woman that has been pulled into danger as she is also targeted for death and now the character along with Aaron Cross are doing all they can to survive and run.The film not only features very good acting but also exciting action sequences.  And the cinematography to cover the fast action was exciting to see.  Robert Elswit may be known for films such a ""Magnolia"", ""Michael Clayton"", ""Syriana"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" but when it comes to action films such as ""Mission Impossible: The Ghost Protocol"" and ""Salt"", he is a cinematographer with a great eye when it comes to action films.  And so far this is one of his best best films yet.  Thanks to the many gorgeous location shots, ""The Bourne Legacy"" is a film that does look quite amazing!But what about the film's faults?  The primary fault that I found with ""The Bourne Legacy"" is not setting up of what happened in the previous three films.  For those who haven't watched the trilogy, and those who have and have not seen it in several years, will probably not remember Pam Landy's character and what took place between Jason Bourne and the CIA Deputy Director and what the CIA was secretly doing.  I suspect many viewers will be lost of what is going on and just setting up of what took place in three films, and getting people up to speed.Also, what made the Bourne films so exciting is its plot.  While ""The Bourne Legacy"" is well-acted, I felt there was too much action over substance, too much of the cat and mouse game than delving deeply into the characters which was done in the previous three films.Still a film that will have tremendous potential but I rather see more of the deep intelligent plot co-existing with the action, than the film being all about the action.As for the Blu-ray release, videophiles and audiophiles will absolutely enjoy the presentation of ""The Bourne Legacy"" on Blu-ray. The video is well-detailed, amazing clarity and picture quality features no blemishes or anything problematic.  The lossless audio because of the intense action is immersive and impressive!  And there are a good number of special features included as well.  Also, the additional extra of having a DVD, Digital Copy and Ultraviolet version is a plus.Overall, ""The Bourne Legacy"" shows promise of being something greater for future sequels.  The first film featured good acting, clever and intelligent writing and amazing action sequences and cinematography (and also music).  But its action sequences eclipses its plot quite a bit.  Still, ""The Bourne Legacy"" is an awesome Blu-ray release and fans of the Bourne series will surely enjoy this film in HD.

1490598,A35ZY4VJUCJ19W,B005LAIIQC,"F. Hughes ""jeop86""","[0, 1]","What a difference a director and actor make. Paul Greengrass perfected his frenetic, hyperactive technique with the Bourne Ultimatum, which made the original Bourne Identity look a little tame by comparison. The brilliant masterpiece that was Ultimatum stands in stark contrast to this well-meaning effort, which, despite a lot of time, money, and talent, falls flat. A big chase scene at the end does not a movie make. Also, if you are not completely familiar with the first three movies, you will be lost.If I described the first half of this film to you, with its multiple subplots and frantic cross-cutting, you'd think it sounded pretty good. In reality, it is leaden, full of limp scenes that fail to have the intended effect. At this stage in action movies, watching a guy hiking Alaska and climbing cliffs is not particularly exciting, despite the cross-cutting to show us what was going on in the next room during the last half hour of the Bourne Ultimatum. In fact, much of the first half is glacial. One can only imagine what the editor's big brother, director Tony Gilroy, gave him to work with if this was the best he could do.  Scenes mostly never generate the feelings we assume they were going for. For example, Aaron Cross's sojourn with another mysterious program agent in a remote cabin is clearly supposed to be tense and suspenseful, but it plays out like we are forced to watch two closeted men set up on an awkward blind date. A visit to Rachel Weisz's lab is similarly boring. An interrogation scene features assassins so skillfully playing caring therapists that the suspense never builds properly.Another part of the problem is Jeremy Renner, a fine actor but not a particularly likeable one. His odd, pop-eyed looks make him appear slightly R-word, which, we learn, his character was until genetically engineered by the world's cutest scientist. So our hero's motivation is merely to keep getting the drugs that prevent him from regressing back into Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel. Gone is the ongoing battle between Jason Bourne's programming to kill and his resurgent sense of morality, replaced here by a junkie's need to get his next fix. In a deleted scene, we see that, if necessary, Cross is perfectly willing to stab to death an innocent State Trooper who stops him for speeding. Hardly a hero to root for.As for ""finishing what Bourne started"" as the tag line proclaimed, nothing like that happens. In fact, by movie's end, we are set up for at least two more sequels, as the villains appear more powerful and untouchable than ever, with poor Pam Landy hung out to dry and Noah Vosen back in the game.There is a terrific motorbike chase at the end and a scary look at where your prescription might actually be coming from, but, as said before, that does not a movie make.",2,The Bourne Legazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,2805,"['What', 'difference', 'director', 'actor', 'make', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'perfected', 'frenetic', 'hyperactive', 'technique', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'made', 'original', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'look', 'little', 'tame', 'comparison', 'brilliant', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'Ultimatum', 'stands', 'stark', 'contrast', 'well-meaning', 'effort', 'lot', 'time', 'money', 'talent', 'flat', 'big', 'chase', 'scene', 'end', 'not', 'movie', 'make', 'Also', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'familiar', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'lost.If', 'described', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'multiple', 'subplots', 'frantic', 'cross-cutting', ""'d"", 'think', 'sounded', 'pretty', 'good', 'reality', 'leaden', 'full', 'limp', 'scenes', 'fail', 'have', 'intended', 'effect', 'stage', 'action', 'movies', 'watching', 'guy', 'hiking', 'Alaska', 'climbing', 'cliffs', 'not', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'cross-cutting', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'next', 'room', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'fact', 'much', 'first', 'half', 'glacial', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'editor', 'big', 'brother', 'director', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'gave', 'work', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'do', 'Scenes', 'mostly', 'never', 'generate', 'feelings', 'assume', 'were', 'going', 'example', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'sojourn', 'mysterious', 'program', 'agent', 'remote', 'cabin', 'clearly', 'supposed', 'be', 'tense', 'suspenseful', 'out', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'two', 'closeted', 'men', 'set', 'up', 'awkward', 'blind', 'date', 'visit', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'lab', 'similarly', 'boring', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'features', 'so', 'skillfully', 'playing', 'caring', 'therapists', 'suspense', 'never', 'properly.Another', 'part', 'problem', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'fine', 'actor', 'not', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'one', 'odd', 'pop-eyed', 'looks', 'make', 'appear', 'slightly', 'R-word', 'learn', 'character', 'was', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'world', 'cutest', 'scientist', 'hero', 'motivation', 'merely', 'keep', 'getting', 'drugs', 'prevent', 'regressing', 'back', 'Cletus', 'Slack', 'Jawed', 'Yokel', 'Gone', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'programming', 'kill', 'resurgent', 'sense', 'morality', 'replaced', 'here', 'junkie', 'need', 'get', 'next', 'fix', 'deleted', 'scene', 'see', 'necessary', 'Cross', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'stab', 'death', 'innocent', 'State', 'Trooper', 'who', 'speeding', 'Hardly', 'hero', 'root', 'for.As', 'finishing', 'what', 'Bourne', 'started', 'tag', 'line', 'proclaimed', 'nothing', 'fact', 'movie', 'end', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'least', 'two', 'more', 'sequels', 'villains', 'appear', 'more', 'powerful', 'untouchable', 'ever', 'poor', 'Pam', 'Landy', 'hung', 'out', 'dry', 'Noah', 'Vosen', 'back', 'game.There', 'terrific', 'motorbike', 'chase', 'end', 'scary', 'look', 'where', 'prescription', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'coming', 'said', 'not', 'movie', 'make']",The Bourne Legacy

Therefore, I did not seek out ""The Bourne Legacy"", nor did I have any desire to watch it. However, a friend had it, and he encouraged me to watch it. I looked at the disc to see how long the run time was, and I groaned when I saw that it clocked in at two hours and fifteen minutes. Fortunately, I gave it a chance- and I'm glad that I did.From the very beginning, I was drawn into this story by the beautiful cinematography, the engaging way in which the plot was presented, and the subtle, superb acting. Though far from over-the-top, the action sequences are riveting, pulse-pounding, and convincing. All of Cross' moves carry a weight of absolute authenticity (probably due to an outstanding choreographer, more than anything else), which let me sink into the movie and become absorbed. Nothing in the realm of the action is outlandish, and so the movie seems ""real"".Though juiced up with some high technology and political conspiracy, this is essentially a simple revenge movie at its core. And that's part of what makes it great. In the previous three movies, Jason Bourne kept alluding to a desire for revenge against the agency, but he never seemed to mete out appropriate levels of justice. Cross makes up for that by exacting more revenge in one movie than Jason did in three. Fortunately, there are a few high level targets still standing, which makes me suspect Cross might come back to finish the job.""The Bourne Legacy"" is a modern action movie, done right.",5,"In my humble opinion, this is the best of the ""Bournes"", by far",1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1674,"['saw', 'previous', 'three', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'felt', 'were', 'okay', 'ultimately', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'impression', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'recalling', 'anything', 'most', 'basic', 'details', 'Therefore', 'did', 'not', 'seek', 'out', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'did', 'have', 'desire', 'watch', 'However', 'friend', 'had', 'encouraged', 'watch', 'looked', 'disc', 'see', 'how', 'long', 'run', 'time', 'was', 'groaned', 'when', 'saw', 'clocked', 'two', 'hours', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Fortunately', 'gave', 'chance-', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.From', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'drawn', 'story', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'engaging', 'way', 'plot', 'was', 'presented', 'subtle', 'superb', 'acting', 'far', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'riveting', 'pulse-pounding', 'convincing', 'Cross', 'moves', 'carry', 'weight', 'absolute', 'authenticity', 'probably', 'due', 'outstanding', 'choreographer', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'let', 'sink', 'movie', 'become', 'absorbed', 'Nothing', 'realm', 'action', 'outlandish', 'so', 'movie', 'real', '.Though', 'juiced', 'up', 'high', 'technology', 'political', 'conspiracy', 'essentially', 'simple', 'revenge', 'movie', 'core', 'part', 'what', 'great', 'previous', 'three', 'movies', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'kept', 'alluding', 'desire', 'revenge', 'agency', 'never', 'seemed', 'mete', 'out', 'appropriate', 'levels', 'justice', 'Cross', 'up', 'exacting', 'more', 'revenge', 'one', 'movie', 'Jason', 'did', 'three', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'few', 'high', 'level', 'targets', 'still', 'standing', 'suspect', 'Cross', 'might', 'come', 'back', 'finish', 'job', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'modern', 'action', 'movie', 'done', 'right']",The Bourne Legacy

1490640,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAIIQC,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[11, 20]","The original Matt Damon BOURNE trilogy is probably the only trilogy of films I've ever seen that got progressively better as the films went on. Doug Liman's THE BOURNE IDENTITY is pretty darn good, and Paul Greengrass' THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is excellent, but Greengrass' finale, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, has become one of those films that I will watch every time it's on. It's just that good. But the unsung hero of all of those films was writer Tony Gilroy, who wrote (or co-wrote) the adaptations to all three previous films and is the co-writer/director of this film. He was smart enough to adapt the books for a more modern era, and make Robert Ludlum's novels cohesive and spry enough to work on the screen by stripping them down to the essentials. When the finale of the BOURNE series hit theaters in 2009, it seemed like a shame since A: star Matt Damon said that he would not return to the role if it wasn't directed by Greengrass and B: Universal would be losing a very lucrative and critically-pleasing franchise. Now, whether doing a Jason Bourne-less BOURNE film was something of a studio decision, or if Gilroy felt that there was more story to tell about the shadowy government programs that birthed agents like Bourne. Either way, we were given THE BOURNE LEGACY, a film that does what it proposes to, but not what it's supposed to do.From the opening moments of the film, we are given a recognizable image: a figure floating in the water, immobile. But it starts to move and swim and we are introduced to Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), an agent of Project Outcome, which is either the progenitor of agents of Treadstone or Blackbriar, or is one of the newer kids on the block. While he is at a training facility in the wilds of Alaska, all hell is breaking loose at the CIA. Eric Byer (Edward Norton), the head of Project Outcome is looking to destroy all evidence of his program due to the chaos that Bourne unleashed on the agency at the end of ULTIMATUM. This leads to several agents of Outcome being killed, but Outcome isn't just deep-cover agents; it's science. Via gene therapy, each agent takes ""chems"" that alter their intelligence and strength; it doesn't make them superhuman, but it does make them better than your average agent. All the research involved is done at a secret facility within a pharmaceutical conglomerate, and one of those doctors is Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). When the call comes to remove the evidence, all of the researchers are killed except Shearing, and all of the agents except Cross. If we just look at the formula of the BOURNE franchise, it's obvious that these two are destined to meet and form a reluctant partnership based on the mutual needs of the other. With Shearing, she needs Cross to protect her. With Cross, he needs Shearing because he needs his chems so that he can remain strong enough and smart enough to protect himself and her. This leads her to a crash course in Tradecraft 101, leads him to see how he dreads becoming what he used to be, and leads everyone on a collision course.From here on out, there's going to be some SPOILER territory, so be careful.As I was watching the film, there were a great many small moments I appreciated; the nail in the fire extinguisher, whatever Cross was doing with the electrical wire and the passports, the use of the laminant on the airline safety cards to create a fake ID, etc. I also really liked the people in it; I think that Renner did a terrific job with what he had to work with as a character. When we see who he was before, it's easy to understand why going back to his previous level of intelligence scares him. He's an effortlessly physical actor, and I appreciated the way that both he and Gilroy differentiated his character from that of Jason Bourne. Cross is inquisitive, talkative, charming and allows himself to be fun, as opposed to Bourne's eternal ennui of identity. Same can be said of Weisz and Franka Potente, but where Marie was more or a free spirit and a passionate woman, Marta is more rigid, a little colder and more fearful because she knows who's out there and I daresay gives her a stronger arc than Marie. Sadly, while I love both Renner and Weisz, I didn't feel a great deal of chemistry between the two. Norton, while still being very good, sadly is very underutilized in this film. He's basically a less screen-active David Strathairn from ULTIMATUM; eternally frustrated with his plans going awry but still calm and seemingly a step ahead. He has no room to breathe, performance-wise, but that's less to do with him and more to do with the script.The script isn't bad, but it's not good either. Gilroy is an extremely gifted writer and perhaps an even more gifted writer/director as evidenced by the phenomenal drama/thriller MICHAEL CLAYTON and the breezily entertaining espionage rom-com DUPLICITY. But this, co-written with his brother Dan, while exposing us to some new ideas also doesn't bring us many new things. It also lacks the big moments. I liked the introduction of the idea of people like Bourne and his ilk actually being medically enhanced (there's a moment early on where it's pointed out that Bourne was actually the first agent of the program to go as long as he had without the chems, but it's quickly glossed over because this isn't his movie any more) and that the science behind all of this doesn't seem so unreal. The scene at Marta's home is extremely well-done and executed. It had genuine surprises, real tension and some very deftly choreographed action. I also admire the way that this film tried to get away from some of the formula of this franchise, but in doing so, it abandoned some of the things that made it so successful. The first is a lack of a formidable physical antagonist. Where all the previous BOURNE films had that one BIG fight that may have only taken about four or five minutes of screentime, you were breathless for those moments. This film doesn't have any of those; it just has the mini-moments where Cross is fighting multiple opponents, and while that's neat, it doesn't have that impact. You do get something like that in LEGACY, but it becomes a motorcycle duel, and it's just kind of blah. Second, it lacks a mental antagonist that Cross can effectively match wits with. Third and most importantly, it lacks any real emotional journey. Bourne has three films with at least three different journeys of the soul: With IDENTITY, it was literally identity-driven; with SUPREMACY, it was vengeance; with ULTIMATUM, it was the search for truth. With LEGACY, we have fugitives-on-the-run complex where the film gives them the reason to run, but it gives them no place to go to, and that essentially ruins the ride. Does that make the journey entirely not worth taking? No, but it doesn't really give us any reason to want to see what happens with these characters either after the credits start to roll.Where the film also trips itself up is with all the new ideas it introduces. There's a lot of story they try and pack in to this one film to get it to where they think it needs to progress, but none of it really seems organic.While there are certainly worse ways to spend an evening, THE BOURNE LEGACY, while having some really good ideas, has far too little to offer the brain and the heart to give you the satisfaction of a good film.2.5/5 stars",2,"BOURNE shoots for new

1490666,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B005LAIIQC,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[10, 21]","Going to the midnight showing of The Bourne Legacy I wasn't expecting much, but was hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I had with other movies I've had doubts with. Like I had doubts with when I went to see the Bourne Identity, but before I get to my opinion of the film I must first talk about the films that came before. After all Legacy is a continuation and a direct sequel to the Bourne films, so I must first talk about the previous films a little first. Back in 2001 and 2002 leading up to the Bourne Identity I had only remembered seeing Matt Damon in Saving Private Ryan and Good Will Hunting nor had I heard of the books Identity was based off of, so I had my doubts about the film. Still I took a chance and was happily surprised. The Bourne Identity was a great film. The action wasn't over the top like much of the action films of the 1980's and 1990's. It had a unique story, which at the time I don't remember it having been done like it had with this film. The characters were interesting, and the music was great. The film led me to Robert Ludlum novels the film was based off of. I read his three Bourne novels and I must admit I enjoyed the Identity and the rest of the films more then I like the novels. Right now I can only think of one other time that has happened, and it was with The Lord of the Ring series. I enjoyed the novels, but they weren't truly great books. The films on the other hand were great especially the first two. When The Bourne Supremacy came out in 2004 I had no doubts about the film or Mat Damon this time. It was a great film, and that was even with them killing of Marie an important character from the books and a character I liked. That's how good Supremacy was for me, and who could forget the car chase seen in Moscow with Karl Urban. It's one of the best car chases scenes of all time along with the likes of Bullitt, The French Connection, Ronin and The Road Warrior. When The Bourne Ultimatum came out in 2007 it had a lot to live up to, and through I thought it would be good I didn't think it could surpass Supremacy, but again I was wrong. Ultimatum was as good if not better than its predecessor. That's a rarity in films and franchises for a third sequel to be as good if not better than the film that came before. Right now I can only think of a few films like The Revenge of the Sith, The Dark Knight Rises and Alien 3. Ultimatum was a great film and had a good ending. I know the studio and director left an opening for another film, but in my opinion they should had let sleeping dogs lie. Robert Ludlum had stopped writing Bourne novels back in 1990. I know Eric Van Lustbader is a capable writer, but Ludlum had finished Bourne's journey and the novels feel forced. Matt Damon was moving on, and so was Paul Greengrass. If Universal really wanted to continue with the franchise it should have gotten down on its hands and knees and begged those two to come back, and pay them whatever they wanted. You can see why I had my doubts about Legacy. Still with that being said I'd still gave it a chance like I had with Matt Damon and Identity back in 2002, which leads us to Bourne Legacy.Where to begin? Where to begin? I could start with the lackluster action, the uninteresting characters. No I'll start with the forced story. When I saw the trailers it looked like they were trying to turn Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) into some kind of super soldier. If I want to see a movie with super heroes in it I'd go to see any of the super hero films that come out every few months now a days. That was what was so good about the Bourne films. Sure Jason Bourne was government trained killer, but he was still human, and could get hurt. It's one of the reason's the films were so good. In Legacy they tried to destroy what was so good about the previous films with the story about genetics and drugs turning people into super soldiers. Then there is Gilory trying to force his failed story into the Bourne universe. It's like a child trying to force a square peg into a round opening it just isn't going to work. That's what it feels like in this film as director and writer Gilory tries to force his story with Bourne's. Sure Gilory was the writer for the previous films, but he had inspiration from Ludlum's books. If he created this screenplay on his own then he needs to stick to adapting screenplays from novels, because he can't do it on his own. Maybe Universal forced him to do it this way after all I know they were desperate to keep this franchise going. If so then I can forgive him for his lackluster to bad screen play. The only thing or person that truly saves the story is Aaron Cross. His story is compelling especially how he came to be part of the program and who he was before it. The character kept me interested in the film.I like Jeremy Renner. I remember him from the average S.W.A.T. remake along with his good performance in 28 Weeks Later, and his great performance in The Hurt Locker. He is a really good actor. He was one of the truly bright spots character wise in The Avengers as Hawkeye. Sure he should have, but didn't have a lot of screen time, but he did a lot with what he had, and in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol again he was one of the truly bright spots. It's the same with Legacy. He brings emotion and depth to the character, but just like in The Avengers and Ghost Protocol I thought he was short changed as Gilory didn't spend enough time with the Renner/Cross as he spend most of the first part of the film trying to force his story into the Bourne Universe. Besides Renner I can't think of anyone who had a good performance, and that's a shame because this film had a pretty good cast of actors. Edward Norton was forgettable in this film. Stacy Keach was underused. Scott Glenn who I like as an actor was pointless in this film as again he was only used to try and force this story into the franchise. The only one who remotely came close to truly standing out was Rachel Weisz (Marta Shearing). Her character was interesting, and I do like the actress and character, but she reminded me a lot of Marie, which is another thing about the story in this film. It's as if Gilory was trying to reboot the franchise and made it similar to The Bourne Identity.The action which was great in the previous films felt underwhelming in The Bourne Legacy. Don't get me wrong there were a few scenes that were good. One in a lab which was riveting, and one in a house out in the woods, which I thought was well done. Still the rest was just underwhelming, and the climax, well the climax action scene was just a letdown. Gilory could have done so much, but it was basically a rehash of a scene in one of the previous films. I expect better action from the Bourne franchise.I'm not sure what involvement Universal had in the directing and writing of this film, but if they didn't have much it speaks to what kind of director and writer Tony Gilory is, and like I said earlier as a writer Gilory had the benefit of a source material with the previous films. Now Gilory was on his own with the story. Trying to create his own story that fit into the universe of Bourne and it doesn't work. As a writer he's basically adapted screenplays from their source material and I think he should stick to that. As a director again I question why Universal chose him. Sure he has made one good film in Michael Clayton, but he has directed only two films before. He's never directed action scenes before and you can tell from watching the Legacy.Overall watching this The Bourne Legacy is watching the death of a franchise. There are only two ways this franchise is going to continue/survive. One is that it makes a ton of money, which I don't see happening or Universal gets on its hands and knees and begs Matt Damon to come back to try and save this franchise. That being said this isn't a horrible film. It's just a representation of a studio trying to keep a franchise alive out of greed. I think the Bourne Legacy could have worked if they had hired a better writer and director and didn't try to force the story into the Bourne universe. It's sad because Jeremy Renner is a really good actor and does a good job in this film with what he has. Still I think the studio should have let the franchise die after Matt Damon and Greengrass didn't come back. The Bourne Legacy isn't a terrible film or bad one it's just a below average action film that shouldn't have been made, and I can't recommend anyone see in the theater. Wait for Redbox.",2,It was like they were trying to force a round peg into a squre hole with this story and film.,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,8527,"['Going', 'midnight', 'showing', 'Bourne',

1490704,A3UXQLM9I775JJ,B005LAIIQC,"Kristofer Sandlund ""The Storyteller""","[1, 2]","Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are excellent. Edward Norton may just be the best actor on the planet. So where does this movie go wrong? There are two problems with the latest Bourne entry: The script and the editing. The basic premise of ""shut the program down"" meaning ""kill everyone involved"" is unoriginal, unimaginative, and basically just plain stupid. Mass murders lead to more congressional probes, more attention, greater risk- not less. Oh, and let's murder all the lab geeks and send a 5 man highly trained hit team in to take out the lone surviving tech. Sure... why not? That sounds like a great way to avert suspicions.The second problem is the editing. It starts out with promise. The opening scenes are well done, and it felt like ""Bourne"" should feel. Tense, highly technical, state of the art and beautifully shot. Later on however, things just bog down. We didn't need to see a bald lab tech taking out everyone in the room- not for 10 minutes. Hey, this guy wasn't Arnold Schwarzenegger- someone should have thrown their pocket calculator at his temple- scene over, everyone's safe! Then it gets good again- the scene at the Doctor's house is once again ""Bourne"" like- very well shot, and Renner is just great!My final gripe- the chase scene in Manilla is another ""editor gone wild""- just awful. You throw about 1,000 ""cut shots"" at us in rapid machine gun fashion, and we're supposed to be in awe. No, we're just nauseated. This same mistake was made in the car chase at the end of Bourne 2 in Russia. Rapid cut shots...arrrrrgh!The set up for a sequel is a good thing. We want to see Aaron Cross and Jason Bourne in the same movie. Bring back Pamela Landy and several other old characters from the Bourne trilogy and it could be fantastic! Please bring back Edward Norton but give him a better script. We want to see him as the grand master, playing a life and death chess match against Pamela, Jason, and Aaron.

It also for me doesn't really start to cook until halfway through, whereas the original Bourne films always engaged me from the very start.  However, I have a huge crush on Jeremy Renner and am a huge fan of Rachel Weiz.  If you look at it as a stand-alone film, it's entertaining and fun, especially as I said in the 2nd half, but it's nowhere up to the edginess of Bourne and really has more of a science fiction twist which takes it completely in a different direction.  I liked the characters, but the pacing just didn't cut it, the ""suspension of disbelief"" wasn't really there, and some the chases seemed really canned, like watching a Bourne rerun.  The efforts to tie it in to the original trilogy seemed forced and again, the flow just wasn't there.  I gave it three stars.

1490809,A39W3263A9HCMN,B005LAIIQC,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[2, 5]","Both Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon joked sometime around the release of The Bourne Ultimatum that there would be a fourth movie entitled ""The Bourne Redundancy"". After all, the Bourne book series did go on after Ultimatum, but it wasn't without changes in writers and, sadly, character. And such a book named The Bourne Legacy would indeed be released, except it wasn't released until after Ultimatum. Now I myself will admit I've only read the first two books in the series but not Ultimatum, and it looks like after The Bourne Redundancy... whoops, I mean Legacy, I won't be any time soon.That isn't to say, however, that The Bourne Legacy is, in any way, a bad movie. Because it isn't. It's got quite a lot going for it. It's just a tad disappointing, is all. This was one of my most anticipated movies of the summer, aside from The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers, both of which were absolutely stellar efforts. I mean, for one, I love the Bourne movies. I remember when my dad and my uncle took me to see The Bourne Supremacy upon its release in 2004. Since then it has become my favourite film in the series and my favourite of the series thus far. The movies it was sandwiched between were great too, though I do consider Ultimatum to be my least favourite of the original three.The Bourne Legacy takes place at about the same time as the events in Ultimatum. While Bourne is on the run, Alex Cross (Jeremy Renner) is one of a few selected people put on a super soldier program entitled ""Operation Outcome"", run by the CIA. He stays chemically enhanced physically and mentally with a set of multicoloured tablets that he stores in a necklace, named ""chems"". He is to take a different colour at each different stage in the day. While deployed in Alaska for a training program, he pretends that he has run out of chems and stumbles upon another like him, named Number Three, staying with him to get some more chems before returning to civilization.Meanwhile, the CIA has been giving others in the program a pill that they convince them will mean more chemical enhancement, without having to take multiple pills. This is really their way of shutting the program down, killing them, run by Eric Byer (Edward Norton), a retired air Forster commissioner. After he sends a drone to kill Number Three, he realizes Cross is still on the run, and will do whatever he can to finally kill Cross off. Cross comes across the doctor who provided him with the chems, Dr. Shearing (Rachel Weisz), and finds out a shocking secret about the process of being chemically enhanced and the way his body takes in the drugs, which leads them to Manila for one hell of an explosive climax.There is quite a bit to like about The Bourne Legacy. For one, Jeremy freakin' Renner. He is instant man crush fuel and this film does not disappoint in that regard. He can act up a storm and he is great for action scenes. And boy, is he beastly in this movie. He has a fair share of great action sequences throughout and if you came specifically to see him slap up some bad guys, then you're in for a treat. Weisz is great as she always is and manages to do an American accent well, with no noticeable slips. The action sequences and chase sequences are fun to watch too, even if the movie becomes just a tad too reliant on action.But there's too much to hate for the movie too. For one, the story seems to not make much sense. The idea of super soldiers is interesting but they don't do much to explain it, like when they bring in this idea of ""viralling off"". They give a quick description of what it is, they do it, bam, it's left in the dust as if it never existed. And it's never really explained why they want to shut down the program. There was lots more they could have done with such a sinister subject.Another issue is the characters are flat and boring. Cross himself isn't even that interesting of a character. Even when it's explained how he was put in the program, there isn't much to salvage. It's never a good sign when you don't care about the antagonist too- as the saying goes, ""a movie is only as good as its antagonist"", Byer doesn't do much to lift himself from that trap.In the third act, the term ""an embarrassment of riches"" comes to mind- the third act is too long, and is just chase scene after chase scene after chase scene and while the climatic motorbike chase is thrilling, at the same time it's just... It's like, the writers forgot the plot and just threw in as many chase scenes as they could.If anything, think of The Bourne Legacy as a good chase movie. Because that's what it is. It's a decent film that's entertaining and has plenty of great chase scenes and action. But as a Bourne movie... well, it's that in name only, and despite Renner, is just a chase movie disguised in spy movie faff. And while it could have been a much, much worse movie,theres lots of ways it could have been better. By that, I mean ""lots"".",3,Re-Bourne again (and again and again and again and again and again and...),1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,4930,"['Paul', 'Greengrass', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'joked', 'sometime', 'release', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'would', 'be', 'fourth', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Bourne', 'Redundancy', 'Bourne', 'book', 'series', 'did', 'go', 'Ultimatum', 'was', ""n't"", 'changes', 'writers', 'sadly', 'character', 'such', 'book', 'named', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'would', 'indeed', 'be', 'released', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'Ultimatum', 'Now', 'myself', 'will', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'only', 'read', 'first', 'two', 'books', 'series', 'not', 'Ultimatum', 'Bourne', 'Redundancy', 'mean', 'Legacy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'time', 'soon.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'however', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'way', 'bad', 'movie', ""n't"", 'got', 'quite', 'lot', 'going', 'just', 'tad', 'disappointing', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'movies', 'summer', 'aside', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'Avengers', 'were', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'efforts', 'mean', 'one', 'love', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'remember', 'when', 'dad', 'uncle', 'took', 'see', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'release', '2004', 'then', 'become', 'favourite', 'film', 'series', 'favourite', 'series', 'thus', 'far', 'movies', 'was', 'sandwiched', 'were', 'great', 'too', 'do', 'consider', 'Ultimatum', 'be', 'least', 'favourite', 'original', 'three.The', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'events', 'Ultimatum', 'Bourne', 'run', 'Alex', 'Cross', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'one', 'few', 'selected', 'people', 'put', 'super', 'soldier', 'program', 'entitled', 'Operation', 'Outcome', 'run', 'CIA', 'chemically', 'enhanced', 'physically', 'mentally', 'set', 'multicoloured', 'tablets', 'stores', 'necklace', 'named', 'chems', 'take', 'different', 'colour', 'different', 'stage', 'day', 'deployed', 'Alaska', 'training', 'program', 'run', 'chems', 'stumbles', 'named', 'Number', 'Three', 'staying', 'get', 'more', 'chems', 'returning', 'civilization.Meanwhile', 'CIA', 'been', 'giving', 'others', 'program', 'pill', 'convince', 'will', 'mean', 'more', 'chemical', 'enhancement', 'having', 'take', 'multiple', 'pills', 'really', 'way', 'shutting', 'program', 'down', 'killing', 'run', 'Eric', 'Byer', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'retired', 'air', 'Forster', 'commissioner', 'drone', 'kill', 'Number', 'Three', 'Cross', 'still', 'run', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'can', 'finally', 'kill', 'Cross', 'off', 'Cross', 'doctor', 'who', 'provided', 'chems', 'Dr.', 'Shearing', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'out', 'shocking', 'secret', 'process', 'being', 'chemically', 'enhanced', 'way', 'body', 'drugs', 'Manila', 'one', 'hell', 'explosive', 'climax.There', 'quite', 'bit', 'like', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'one', 'Jeremy', 'freakin', 'Renner', 'instant', 'man', 'crush', 'fuel', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'regard', 'can', 'act', 'up', 'storm', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'boy', 'beastly', 'movie', 'fair', 'share', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'came', 'specifically', 'see', 'slap', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'then', ""'re"", 'treat', 'Weisz', 'great', 'always', 'manages', 'do', 'American', 'accent', 'well', 'noticeable', 'slips', 'action', 'sequences', 'chase', 'sequences', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'too', 'even', 'movie', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'reliant', 'too', 'much', 'hate', 'movie', 'too', 'one', 'story', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'idea', 'super', 'soldiers', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'explain', 'when', 'bring', 'idea', 'viralling', 'off', 'give', 'quick', 'description', 'what', 'do', 'bam', 'left', 'dust', 'never', 'existed', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'why', 'want', 'shut', 'down', 'program', 'was', 'lots', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'sinister', 'subject.Another', 'issue', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'boring', 'Cross', ""n't"", 'even', 'interesting', 'character', 'Even', 'when', 'explained', 'how', 'was', 'put', 'program', ""n't"", 'much', 'salvage', 'never', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'antagonist', 'too-', 'saying', 'movie', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'antagonist', 'Byer', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'lift', 'third', 'act', 'term', 'embarrassment', 'riches', 'mind-', 'third', 'act', 'too', 'long', 'just', 'chase', 'scene', 'chase', 'scene', 'chase', 'scene', 'climatic', 'motorbike', 'chase', 'thrilling', 'same', 'time', 'just', 'writers', 'forgot', 'plot', 'just', 'threw', 'as', 'many', 'chase', 'scenes', 'could.If', 'anything', 'think', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'good', 'chase', 'movie', 'what', 'decent', 'film', 'entertaining', 'plenty', 'great', 'chase', 'scenes', 'action', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'well', 'name', 'only', 'Renner', 'just', 'chase', 'movie', 'disguised', 'spy', 'movie', 'faff', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'movie', 'lots', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'mean', 'lots']",The Bourne Legacy

An expansion of the Bourne universe, according to the press release, this fourth entry offers more of the same with equal amounts of pizzazz and thrills. It`s a winning formula, and if it aint broke. Hollywood aint gonna fix it.Taking place nearly concurrent with the franchise's previous entry, the Bourne Ultimatum, this time out we follow the exploits of Aaron Cross (Renner). Cross was a part of different black ops called Outcome, but when the Bourne scandal (now there's an interesting unused title) is broke to the press, Treadstone decides to cover their tracks by eliminating all Outcome agents as well. The Outcome agents are genetically enhanced super soldiers, Cross is the only one to escape with his life, but is in need of his stabilizing meds. This leads him to seek out Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who was in charge of the research program, and he finds her in just the nick of time as she about to have her government contract terminated for good. The two have to rely on one another to survive and escape those who are now hunting them.The story is as complicated as any other Bourne adventure, and yet somehow easier to follow and more straightforward. This is not necessarily an asset as a lot of the mystery seems to have been let go in favor of even more stunts and shoot outs. The movie does keep viewers tense and on the edge of their seats for the entirety of this fast moving thriller. Even at two hours and fifteen minutes, it feels brisk and is over before you know it. The pacing is so taunt that it's effortless in it's ability to disguise it's failings.The breakneck final chase scene, on motorcycles no less through Manila, in particular is one of the best you'll see all year. It's pulsating, suspenseful and exhilarating to the max. It will make the heart beat fast and the blood pressure sore. Finely done and a stirring achievement thanks to the dp Robert Elswit and editor John Gilroy`s fancy know how. The action scenes are the usual quick cuts to help A-list stars look like athletes, but at least the shaky cam is kept to a minimum this time.Renner is a thoroughly acceptable substitute for franchise regular Matt Damon. Damon's Jason Bourne is still very much a presence in the film, with many photographs of the actor seen through out, as well so much of the plot hinging on his whereabouts and as the title suggest, his legacy. Renner, who's become well known of late in supporting roles, makes a smooth transition to leading man. I would happily see future adventures starring the talented actor since Damon has in recent interviews hinted at the unlikeness of his returning  to the role.Weisz also is in fine form here playing a tough and smart role. Her Dr. Shearing, while not an action hero, is no damsel in distress, either. Weisz is too smart to play stupid roles anymore, she was fantastic and Oscar snubbed in a film last year titled the Whistleblower and notice the way she ditched the histrionically awful Mummy  franchise as soon as she won an Academy Award. She is a top flight actress, beautiful and a wonderful screen presence, I hope they don't make the same mistake as they did earlier with Frank Potente and keep Weisz a integral part of this new series incarnation.I've said before that any good thriller depends on the strength of it's villains and keeping with the Bourne formula of excellent character actors playing well written, sneering antagonists this time around we get Edward Norton and Stacy Keach. These two fine actors are enthralling enough to watch in their own right that the only logical complaint could be that we spend too much time focusing on the heroes in this movie. Also as a bonus many of the series past stars, including Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn and Albert Finney, pop up in welcome cameos.Directed by Tony Gilroy, taking over from franchise helmer Paul Greengrass, Gilroy is a capable director who has showed moments of greatness. His inspired first film was Michael Clayton, one of the best movies of 2007. Gilroy misstepped somewhat with his second picture the over inflated Julia Roberts-Clive Owen vehicle Duplicity. The Bourne Legacy not only gets Gilroy back on track, but has moments that once more hint at the tremendous potential that lie within.Gilroy has had a hand in writing the other three Jason Bourne adventures, so it seemed a natural choice for the budding auteur to take the helm. Co-writing this time with his brother, Dan, Gilroy has turned out another adequate workman like script. They keep the proceedings at a steady pace and make Cross an acceptable replacement for the familiar Bourne, a similar cross between James Bond and Harry Palmer. Once again the film raises more questions than it answers, and adds nothing predominantly new to the franchise, it would appear to just lead us into the next series installment but it knows what it is doing and it does it well. This also ranks as the second best man vs. wolf movie of 2012.This entry works just fine, unfortunately that's it and really nothing more. Still, it delivers the goods and fans and novices of the series alike should get their money's worth as long as they aren't expecting too much.

It can make for disaster (""Grease 2"") or yield surprisingly good results (""Batman Begins"").  That's the challenge faced by ""The Bourne Legacy,"" the fourth in the Bourne series and the first starring Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"").The previous Bourne movie, ""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" released in 2007, starred Matt Damon, who created the role on screen.  When Damon and director Paul Greengrass decided to take some time off from the series, Universal faced the same problem Columbia did with Spider-Man:  how do you keep a lucrative franchise alive without the star and the director who made it a success?  A lot was at stake; the first three Bourne pictures had earned nearly a billion dollars worldwide.Rather than have a new actor assume the role, the production created an entirely new covert government-trained assassin:  Aaron Cross.  Several actors were considered, among them Jake Gyllenhaal, Tobey Maguire, Garrett Hedlund, Michael Fassbender, Alex Pettyfer, Kellen Lutz, Josh Hartnett, Paul Dano, and Michael Pitt.  After a long series of auditions, Renner won the role.""The Bourne Legacy"" isn't, therefore, technically a sequel.  Call it a spinoff, with a new protagonist and new-to-the-franchise director Tony Gilroy expanding the saga created by Robert Ludlum.  Cross faces life-or-death stakes triggered by events of the first three films.  Also new to the series are Edward Norton, Rachel Weisz, Stacy Keach, and Oscar Isaac.  Franchise veterans Albert Finney, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Scott Glenn reprise their roles from the earlier films.Special features on the two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include seven behind-the-scenes featurettes, feature commentary with the creative team, digital copy, and deleted scenes.",3,"Take away Jason Bourne, add Aaron Cross",1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,1808,"['Switching', 'stars', 'profitable', 'movie', 'sequel', 'risky', 'business', 'can', 'make', 'disaster', 'Grease', '2', 'yield', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'results', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'challenge', 'faced', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'fourth', 'Bourne', 'series', 'first', 'starring', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Hurt', 'Locker', '.The', 'previous', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'released', '2007', 'starred', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'created', 'role', 'screen', 'When', 'Damon', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'decided', 'take', 'time', 'series', 'Universal', 'faced', 'same', 'problem', 'Columbia', 'did', 'Spider-Man', 'how', 'do', 'keep', 'lucrative', 'franchise', 'alive', 'star', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'success', 'lot', 'was', 'stake', 'first', 'three', 'Bourne', 'pictures', 'had', 'earned', 'nearly', 'billion', 'dollars', 'worldwide.Rather', 'have', 'new', 'actor', 'assume', 'role', 'production', 'created', 'entirely', 'new', 'covert', 'government-trained', 'assassin', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'Several', 'actors', 'were', 'considered', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Alex', 'Pettyfer', 'Kellen', 'Lutz', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'long', 'series', 'auditions', 'Renner', 'won', 'role', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', ""n't"", 'therefore', 'technically', 'sequel', 'Call', 'spinoff', 'new', 'protagonist', 'new-to-the-franchise', 'director', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'expanding', 'saga', 'created', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'Cross', 'life-or-death', 'stakes', 'triggered', 'events', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'Also', 'new', 'series', 'are', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Franchise', 'veterans', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'reprise', 'roles', 'earlier', 'films.Special', 'features', 'two-disc', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'include', 'seven', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'feature', 'commentary', 'creative', 'team', 'digital', 'copy', 'deleted', 'scenes']",The Bourne Legacy

And you're going to get a couple of them in this movie with the likable stars Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross and Rachel Weisz as Dr. Shearing doing the running as the big, bad secret government agency tries to track them down and kill them.  Renner, an engaging actor who has shown some chutzpah in a variety of movies including ""The Town"", ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"", and ""The Hurt Locker"", does not play a copycat Bourne here.  Renner's Cross character has his memories and knows who he is and rather likes himself; he's also capable of making his own moral choices.  As such he floats above the proceedings here.  Gone is the jigsaw fuzzy puzzle of finding out his identity which made the original Bourne and it's sequels sharply compelling.  In its place is Cross' need to get his hands on a drug that will keep his mind sharp and he saves Weisz's Dr. Shearing so that the two become a team and accomplish this mission.  But there isn't any real saving the day here as it is about saving the man; it's Bourne lite actually.  It's got a lot of action and some moments of intensity and you can follow it (as it jags back and forth a few times with memory revelations the main story seems to be taking place and progressing as the other Bourne actions were taking place) but there is a lot of throwaway references to Treadstone and Blackbrier and such by a lot of good actors in board rooms that amounts to essentially a bunch of talking heads repeatedly telling us how critical it is to stop the public from finding out the big, bad secrets.  Gone is the dogged determination of the Pamela Landy character's determination to find the truth and the truth here is that the film suffers for it.  Renner gives some cool and light humor touches to his uber-agent and is the real reason to see this film but it does pale in comparison to the Damon outings.

I adore the first 2 Bourne Movies in this series, the 2nd being my favorite (it had feeling, vision, and purpose) , the third feeling a little too handheld even for me, but it ends very well.. ""Bourne Legacy"" is muddled and so far afield from what was introduced in the original movies that it's indecipherable. Had they not transplanted Jason Bournes picture in this I would have never even guessed this was the same series.. different colored pills/medications/dosages? Where did this come from?

And, given the super-soldier treatment he's been subjected to wins in the end.Some of the stereotypes get a bit thick. Agents of the covert agency wrap themselves in a bizarre patriotism, to swaddle their consciences from the evil they knowingly do - as long as it serves the greater good, as they define the term, that's good enough. The representative scientist within the program has an idealistic naivete about being in it only for the science, and that her personal career sacrifices somehow justify something. There's reality in those characters, though - I've seen similar beliefs, in less exaggerated form, in people I've known.But I didn't come for a morality play. I came for plenty of adventure, running around, blowing things up, and maybe a side order of chaste romance. I got it. Maybe a few plot elements seemed gratuitous (like LARX, a suitable foil to Our Hero seemingly conjured from nowhere), but the whole came together well.-- wiredweird",4,Decent sequel,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,1178,"['got', 'everything', 'came', 'see', 'given', 'expectations', 'set', 'earlier', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'great', 'action', 'evil', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'loyal', 'honest', 'man', 'horribly', 'abused', 'system', 'determined', 'free', 'given', 'super-soldier', 'treatment', 'been', 'subjected', 'wins', 'end.Some', 'stereotypes', 'get', 'bit', 'thick', 'Agents', 'covert', 'agency', 'wrap', 'bizarre', 'patriotism', 'swaddle', 'consciences', 'evil', 'knowingly', 'do', 'as', 'long', 'greater', 'good', 'define', 'term', 'good', 'enough', 'representative', 'scientist', 'program', 'idealistic', 'naivete', 'being', 'only', 'science', 'personal', 'career', 'sacrifices', 'somehow', 'justify', 'something', 'reality', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'similar', 'beliefs', 'less', 'exaggerated', 'form', 'people', ""'ve"", 'known.But', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'morality', 'play', 'came', 'plenty', 'adventure', 'running', 'around', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'maybe', 'side', 'order', 'chaste', 'romance', 'got', 'Maybe', 'few', 'plot', 'elements', 'seemed', 'gratuitous', 'LARX', 'suitable', 'foil', 'Hero', 'seemingly', 'conjured', 'nowhere', 'whole', 'came', 'together', 'well.', 'wiredweird']",The Bourne Legacy
