Of course, that always goes without saying, and it is understandable that the two rarely compare well.The premise of the film is that an 11 year plans to commit suicide on her 12th birthday, documents by movie camera, her home life with clueless parents trivializing over the trivials in life.Meanwhile, the elderly tenant in the building, and the superintendent, I believe, began a relationship that is sweet.  In essence, this is what life should be about, connecting with people, not trivializing and disconnects.The acting was done well, and sweet little girl was far more mature than most 12 year olds.  She seemed to be a miniature adult.But, I am assuming the book revealed the pieces missing that I was referring to when I said, it is missing something.There was too much shown of the young girl documenting her family, rather than giving the viewer those critical elements that make us ""feel"" that she had some revelation.

The Hedgehog tiptoes through a few lives. The lens and players quietly sharing moments that ultimately ad up to a film that leaves you feeling...literally feeling. And these days saying a film raised an emotion (other than excitement due to an energetic edit or hyper sound system) says a lot.Story goes...Little Paloma (Garance Le Guillermic) is facing another birthday. She will be twelve. She has decided not to be twelve. She is planning to kill herself as she feels death is nothing. Paloma is a deeply introverted brooding - but charming - child.She is also a rich child in a rich home. Her family is busy with their own dramas (imagined and real). They know Paloma is there, but not who she is.With her father's old video camera Paloma begins to document what she has determined will be her last 165 days. A child of Nietzsche-esque tendencies Paloma is a suffering being who feels she is destined to grow into nothing. She shall be just another being stuck in the rut of life, as exposed as some insignificant little goldfish wallowing in a privacy-free bowl.Above her own swanky apartment home's level a neighbor has died. In their place comes a gentle Japanese man (Togo Igawa).Unlike the other residents, he is immediately intrigued with the building's janitor Renee (Josiane Balasko ). The two seemingly yin and yang souls dare to cross ""classes."" A reserved kinship is explored; friendship and ""what ever they want it to be.""Young Paloma has also just recently noticed Renee. Not simply as subject matter for her film, or the building's frumpy janitor, but as a woman with a secret...The young girl playing Paloma, Garance Le Guillermic, is like a French Dakota Fanning; talented and adorable. Hollywood is sure to ""discover"" her and treat her as they've done Keira Knightly. Hopefully, Garance will get through her assigned stylist's whims, the studio's gobbstopping-money-centric machine and find herself still interested in doing these kinds of thoughtful films.Josiane Balasko, who plays the somewhat invisable Renee, is a veteran in foreign film. And her decades of experience shines like a creme brulee on a table of store-brand sugar cookies. That is not to say her costars are weak (not at all). Josiane is just the clear scene stealer - and she hardly speaks!Igawa is an elegant gentleman you will recognize, though you may not recall from where. Head over to IMDB.com and see for yourself.In every aspect, The Hedgehog is wonderful. The acting all around superb, the sets and location marvelous; I could have done without the fish murder...but still. Director Mona Achache has an exceptional eye for bringing out the loudest statements with the smallest of voices. Get to this film, order this film, see this film. It will remind you not every film is a generic studio-driven farce remarkable only in the egos before and behind the lens and bottom-line profits.Snack recommendation: Ramen noodles and tea",5,Great film,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,3034,"['bluntreview', 'dot', 'com', 'France', 'usually', 'place', 'find', 'small', 'amazing', 'films', 'exception', 'Hedgehog', 'tiptoes', 'few', 'lives', 'lens', 'players', 'quietly', 'sharing', 'moments', 'ultimately', 'ad', 'up', 'film', 'feeling', 'literally', 'feeling', 'days', 'saying', 'film', 'raised', 'emotion', 'other', 'excitement', 'due', 'energetic', 'edit', 'hyper', 'sound', 'system', 'lot.Story', 'Little', 'Paloma', 'Garance', 'Le', 'Guillermic', 'facing', 'birthday', 'will', 'be', 'twelve', 'decided', 'not', 'be', 'twelve', 'planning', 'kill', 'death', 'nothing', 'Paloma', 'deeply', 'introverted', 'brooding', 'charming', 'child.She', 'also', 'rich', 'child', 'rich', 'home', 'family', 'busy', 'own', 'dramas', 'imagined', 'real', 'know', 'Paloma', 'there', 'not', 'who', 'is.With', 'father', 'old', 'video', 'camera', 'Paloma', 'document', 'what', 'determined', 'will', 'be', 'last', '165', 'days', 'child', 'Nietzsche-esque', 'tendencies', 'Paloma', 'suffering', 'being', 'who', 'destined', 'grow', 'nothing', 'shall', 'be', 'just', 'being', 'stuck', 'rut', 'life', 'as', 'exposed', 'insignificant', 'little', 'goldfish', 'wallowing', 'privacy-free', 'bowl.Above', 'own', 'swanky', 'apartment', 'home', 'level', 'neighbor', 'died', 'place', 'gentle', 'Japanese', 'man', 'Togo', 'Igawa', 'other', 'residents', 'immediately', 'intrigued', 'building', 'janitor', 'Renee', 'Josiane', 'Balasko', 'two', 'seemingly', 'yin', 'yang', 'souls', 'dare', 'cross', 'classes', 'reserved', 'kinship', 'explored', 'friendship', 'what', 'ever', 'want', 'be', 'Young', 'Paloma', 'also', 'just', 'recently', 'noticed', 'Renee', 'Not', 'simply', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'building', 'frumpy', 'janitor', 'woman', 'secret', 'young', 'girl', 'playing', 'Paloma', 'Garance', 'Le', 'Guillermic', 'French', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'talented', 'adorable', 'Hollywood', 'sure', 'discover', 'treat', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Hopefully', 'Garance', 'will', 'get', 'assigned', 'stylist', 'whims', 'studio', 'gobbstopping-money-centric', 'machine', 'find', 'still', 'interested', 'doing', 'kinds', 'thoughtful', 'films.Josiane', 'Balasko', 'who', 'somewhat', 'invisable', 'Renee', 'veteran', 'foreign', 'film', 'decades', 'experience', 'shines', 'creme', 'brulee', 'table', 'store-brand', 'sugar', 'cookies', 'not', 'say', 'costars', 'are', 'weak', 'not', 'Josiane', 'just', 'clear', 'scene', 'stealer', 'hardly', 'Igawa', 'elegant', 'gentleman', 'will', 'recognize', 'may', 'not', 'recall', 'where', 'Head', 'IMDB.com', 'see', 'yourself.In', 'aspect', 'Hedgehog', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'superb', 'sets', 'location', 'marvelous', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'fish', 'murder', 'still', 'Director', 'Mona', 'Achache', 'exceptional', 'eye', 'bringing', 'out', 'loudest', 'statements', 'smallest', 'voices', 'Get', 'film', 'order', 'film', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'remind', 'not', 'film', 'generic', 'studio-driven', 'farce', 'remarkable', 'only', 'egos', 'lens', 'bottom-line', 'profits.Snack', 'recommendation', 'Ramen', 'noodles', 'tea']",N/A

1361693,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003SXHZGS,Grady Harp,"[12, 12]","Something there is about little French films that is like discovering a free-floating water lily in a quiet stream: it approaches you, shares it lovely scent as it passed, and then continues on out of sight, leaving you warmly happy at the privilege of observing a gentle bit of nature if only for a moment.  THE HEDGEHOG does just that. Mona Achache directs her screen play adapted from the novel ""L'&eacute;l&eacute;gance du h&eacute;risson"" by Muriel Barbery, casts an impeccable group of actors who bring to life this tale of how serendipitous nods of love can alter lives.The title comes form the definition of a hedgehog as a prickly-on- the-outside, cuddly-on-the-inside critter that is often misjudged. And that definition applies to several characters in the story though it is most directly connected to bourgeoisie apartment house concierge Renee Michel (Josiane Balasko), a middle-aged and sour hermit who lives to mop the floor, distribute mail, and to give you a wary eye to passersby. The building is inhabited by rich people, a fact we learn from the narrator of the story - Paloma Josse (Garance Le Guillermic), an eleven-year-old girl disturbed by her privileged life in Paris. Her father Paul (Wladimir Yordanoff) is distracted by his government job while her mother Solange (Anne Brochet) drinks champagne with anti-depressants while talking to her plants, and her sister Colombe (Sarah Le Picard) focuses her shallow life on a pet goldfish. She decides she will kill herself in 165 days on her 12th birthday and begins to document the hypocrisy of the adults in her apartment building with her father's old 8mm camcorder. Her harsh judgments do not seem to include Renee: though they are at opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum Paloma senses something unusual about Renee, explores her apartment and discovers the extensive secret library in Renee's back room, and that the often untidy appearing and distant matron reads Tolstoy to her cat Leo. Renee's hedgehog appearance does indeed contain a cuddly inside, a fact that is revealed when a new tenant - Kakuro Ozu (Togo Igawa) moves in and he and Paloma realize they are kindred spirits. Mr. Ozu is a wealthy Japanese businessman and he strikes up a friendship with Paloma as they discuss their shared curiosity for the downstairs concierge woman and their delight in playing the game Go with one another. Kakuro's attention to and kindness for Renee creates changes: Renee is instructed by the maid Manuela Lopez (Ariane Ascaride) to have her hair done and to wear a new dress when Renee reluctantly accepts Kakuro's invitation to dinner.  As Paloma observes the changes Kakuro creates in both Renee and in herself, her own coming of age becomes a much less pessimistic prospect. `Planning to die doesn't mean I let myself go like a rotten vegetable. What matters isn't the fact of dying or when you die. It's what you're doing at that precise moment.'  And from there the story moves like that free floating water lily - passing on through life enlightened by its presence.Josiane Belasko, Garance Le Guillermic, and Togo Igawa are brilliant in their roles.  The script is quiet, intelligent and ultimately deeply touching, but it is the direction of Mona Achache that polishes this little gem to a glow. Clearly this is one of the finest films of the past decade.

Teslovich,"[3, 5]","An unhappy eleven year girl (Paloma Josse), who is normal in most respects in that she has glow in the dark stars on her bedroom ceiling; wears overalls all the time (consistent with her unkempt spontaneous lifestyle); draws patterns with brush calligraphy pens; thinks about her sister's goldfish in it's fishbowl; asks endless questions; finds adults to be shallow. Except, all of the while methodically acquiring the drugs needed to end her life in 165 days (her 12th birthday) because she doesn't want to live life like an unhappy fish in a fishbowl.But, the world around her is a fishbowl (and she's the fish) in the occupant owned Parisian five condo apartment building. Also unhappy is the building's reclusive poorly paid and largely ignored supervisor/custodian (Renee Michel) whose self worth is about as low as it can be. Renee finds refuge in her books, one of which is Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina"", which contains this plot significant quote, ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.""As we follow Paloma around, the scenes are at times funny, at times tragic and at times profound i.e. Paloma thinks kindness is what should matter in life; states that psychoanalysis rivals religion for it's love of suffering; says we are all hedgehogs in life (a metaphor of what we show on the outside compared to what's inside).""The Hedgehog"" reminded me of the movie, ""Le Quattro Volte"", a story about a lonely shepherd and his goats who experience the cycle of life to death to life. Similarly, in ""The Hedgehog"" we have a goldfish who lives, dies and lives again. And, for Paloma could there be a similar cycle where she regains her life from death?

The novel was a philosophical treatise on the meaning of life in the Parisian ""htel particulier"" settings. One of the themes of the story was that we remain the primates and our lives have no meaning except the struggle for survival. The redeeming features are the great books and the art in general. It is, so to speak, the tears of admiration that the great art and the great books give us. This is a point of view close to the ideas of Arthur Schopenhauer. He was the first European philosopher who knew anything about the ideas of the Orient. The book and the film are inspired by the Japanese and Russian cultures as well as French philosophy. The director of the movie had to shorten the story and reduce the philosophical dimensions of the novel for the benefit of the action. The main feature of the movie is the gradual falling in love of a self-effacing concierge Renee with a Japanese tenant called Kakuro Ozu.

So why did I not love this movie? Well, too much time is spent on the preternaturally precocious prepubescent Paloma as she epaters le bourgeoise in her apartment building, secluding herself and engaging in endless ennui.  Like her predecessor Holden Caulfield, she has the people in her immediate milieu pegged as phonies- all except for one -the prickly concierge Rene Michel.Josiane Balasko, as Mme Michel, is a gem and here she saves the movie playing a secret auto-didact, who retiring behind her facade, chomps on epicurean delicacies and reads in her amazing private library with her fat tabby at her side. I don't know about you, but really, could life get much better than that?Apparently it can, because along comes M. Ozu , no relation to the great Japanese auteur, a man so perfect and evolved he can see the wabi- sabi not only of objects but of people. And so both concierge and girl drop their masks and show their true natures as a deep bond develops between the three. Unfortunately this section is far too short and too underdeveloped in the film.Too soon, everything comes to a very European end, and we are hit over the head with the symbolism of the resurrected goldfish and his bowl, as little Paloma, previously contemplating suicide, comes to some breakthrough conclusions about life.I think I might have liked it better if I was in my teens or early twenties and hadn't yet considered the impermanence of life, class differences, the sadness and isolation of existence - and the pleasure and consolation cats, dark chocolate and reading can give us. As it is, I almost felt that I was being lectured, and that all the symbolism and esoteric links were a little too pat and clever, holding me at arm's length from the characters and the story.However, that does not mean you should not see the movie, for it has some wonderful moments- and Balasko is amazing, genuine and delightful. For a richer, more authentic picture of a Parisian childhood peopled by eccentrics and book lovers, featuring culture clash and  class consciousness, James Ivory's film, A Soldiers Daughter Never Cries, the fictionalized account of James Jones' daughter Kaylie's childhood, springs to mind.

It is a quiet, low-key, story of a middle aged, overweight, frumpy, concierge who takes care of an upscale building in Paris.  She makes her self invisible and her sole consolations in life are her cat, Leo, and her extensive library which she hides behind closed doors. In one of the apartments lives Paloma, a bright but unhappy 11 year old girl who is also always hiding in her own way. She is planning to kill herself on her 12th birthday and she counts the days off on her wall with a Japanese brushpen.  She recognizes, what no one else does, that there is more to Renee, the concierge, than meets the eye.  Into this scene enters a new character, a  wealthy, older Japanese gentleman, who, unlike everyone else in the building, sees the charms of both the young girl and the concierge. The interactions between these unlikely three constitute the story.I haven't read the novel on which the film was based. Other reviews here state that it is better than the film.  I think that the problem I had with the film was the casting.  The Japanese man that we see is quite handsome, charming as well as very rich. One would imagine that he could have had half the older women in Paris to choose from. The concierge is shown as not just plain, but downright dowdy.  Nor does she seem to have any spark of personality that would indicate on first meeting that there is something more to her.  She doesn't seem particularly bright or interesting or anything that would justify his interest. Even after her ""makeover"" she is still sullen and awkward.  So, for me, anyway, his interest in her isn't credible. I can imagine that this would not have been a problem in the novel.  The young girl who plays Paloma is not the most lovable child either and some people may have a hard time relating to her.What saved it for me was the story itself, which is lovely.  And the visuals.  Paloma draws very well.  Even the calendar on her wall, counting the days to her planned suicide is beautiful. She makes a card for Renee, showing her in her secret library that is utterly charming.  Renee, besides loveing Tolstoy, also has a taste for Japanese culture which we see in her stone teapot.

But the book (my favorite read of 2008 and likely to be on my top 10 list forever) is just a little bit more so.This story takes place in an upscale Parisian apartment building and tells of three denizens thereof--a young girl with a movie camera who busies herself filming all the things about her life and its surroundings--most especially her dreadful family--that have led to her decision to kill herself on her 12th birthday; the crusty sad-sack concierge who masquerades as the mostly-invisible resident nobody, but is, in actuality, its resident intellectual;  and the new tenant, a courtly, kindly and wonderfully wise Japanese electronics entrepreneur who quickly sets about bringing out the buried gifts and hidden depths of the other two.It took two years for this fine French film to finally make it to my town (Washington, DC), and I was somewhat wary it wouldn't live  up to  Barbery's book, but I needn't have been.  It's a remarkably good movie that stays true to the book and has set its setting and cast its three stars perfectly. The main reason I remain partial to the book and recommend you read it first if you have that option, is that like most books, not all of it could fit into one standard-sized movie and in the case of this story, ""all of it"" can't help but trump ""most of it.""

When I ordered it for $27 last week from an Amazon outside seller,  Amazon was showing 8 copies available. So don't dismay if this page reads ""unavailable"" today.  Keep checking back. Addenda 1/10/12: Also note that seller prices here seem to vary quite a lot from day to day and  (2) On receipt of the DVD was disappointed to find that while the movie itself offers English subtitles, its extras do not.",5,There's only one thing I could recommend to you more highly...,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,2114,"['would', 'be', 'book', 'marvelous', 'French', 'movie', 'Elegance', 'Hedgehog', 'are', 'excellent', 'book', 'favorite', 'read', '2008', 'likely', 'be', 'top', '10', 'list', 'forever', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'so.This', 'story', 'place', 'upscale', 'Parisian', 'apartment', 'building', 'tells', 'three', 'denizens', 'thereof', 'young', 'girl', 'movie', 'camera', 'who', 'filming', 'things', 'life', 'surroundings', 'most', 'especially', 'dreadful', 'family', 'have', 'led', 'decision', 'kill', '12th', 'birthday', 'crusty', 'sad-sack', 'concierge', 'who', 'mostly-invisible', 'resident', 'nobody', 'actuality', 'resident', 'intellectual', 'new', 'tenant', 'courtly', 'kindly', 'wonderfully', 'wise', 'Japanese', 'electronics', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'quickly', 'bringing', 'out', 'buried', 'gifts', 'hidden', 'depths', 'other', 'two.It', 'took', 'two', 'years', 'fine', 'French', 'film', 'finally', 'make', 'town', 'Washington', 'DC', 'was', 'somewhat', 'wary', 'would', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Barbery', 'book', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'remarkably', 'good', 'movie', 'true', 'book', 'set', 'setting', 'cast', 'three', 'stars', 'perfectly', 'main', 'reason', 'remain', 'partial', 'book', 'recommend', 'read', 'first', 'have', 'option', 'most', 'books', 'not', 'could', 'fit', 'one', 'standard-sized', 'movie', 'case', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'trump', 'most', 'recommendations', 'order', 'are', '1', 'Read', 'then', 'see', '2', 'Just', 'read', '3', 'See', 'then', 'read', '4', 'Just', 'see', 'it.12/7/11', 'UPDATE', 'Was', 'surprised', 'discover', 'when', 'came', 'back', 'page', 'three', 'days', 'writing', 'above', 'Le', 'Herisson', 'DVD', 'was', 'showing', 'UNAVAILABLE', 'When', 'ordered', '27', 'last', 'week', 'Amazon', 'outside', 'seller', 'Amazon', 'was', 'showing', '8', 'copies', 'available', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'dismay', 'page', 'unavailable', 'today', 'Keep', 'checking', 'back', '1/10/12', 'Also', 'note', 'seller', 'prices', 'here', 'seem', 'vary', 'quite', 'lot', 'day', 'day', '2', 'receipt', 'DVD', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'movie', 'English', 'subtitles', 'extras', 'do', 'not']",N/A
