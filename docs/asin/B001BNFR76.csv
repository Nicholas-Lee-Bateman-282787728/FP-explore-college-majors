Bysshe,"[1, 2]","Let's be clear upfront:  This is an English Language film, released in L.A and the UK, produced in Toronto and L.A., but directed and filmed entirely on location in Kerala by award winning cinematographer/director and Kerala native Santosh Sivan.Sivan spent his early career partly with Mani Ratnam, on RojaRojaand Dil SeDil se: Bollywood Movie. While the cinematography is entirely professional in this film, the ad hoc nature of Santosh's early film style with Mani are missing in Before the Rains: THIS IS A CLOSED SET PICTURE.  With its beauty (a difficult mistress) the film lacks the fascination of a varied mis-en-scene that filmmakers from David Lean down to the smallest Indian independent, shooting the the eighties, manage to effect when shooting in India.Merchant/Ivory's association with India has stamped this product.  Its long career in India started with Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, longtime screenwriter for M/I in 20 films (Heat & DustHeat and Dust / Autobiography of a Princess - The Merchant Ivory Collection; Shakespeare WallahShakespeare Wallah - The Merchant Ivory Collection).  More recently, M/I had the 1988 production The DeceiversThe Deceivers - The Merchant Ivory Collectionwith Pierce Brosnan playing in a story of the early years of Sleeman's career when he was tracking down gypsy dacoits. Totally ""angrez.""BEFORE THE RAINS was not such an original story, but an adaption from an Israeli film called YELLOW ASPHALTYellow Asphalt(see my review), which featured as one part of a trilogy a story that  sounded ""universal"".One reviewer of Yellow Asphalt (Wiki article) thought the cinematography of the desert was ""boring"", where other films from the Judaean desert  were more beautiful.  Sivan seems to have ignored an aesthetic developed in the original film for the Indian remake, which endeavors to be beautiful- Kerala is beautiful- what can you do?A new screenwriter was used on this film, Cathy Rabin (d. 2007).  Her script is taut and spends no time on wavering from this story's progression of fate.  This film is relentless, in its anxious descent into shame, loss, and unwelcome transformation. All the while advertising itself cinematically as ""ravishing and breathtakingly beautiful.""Linus Roach not only radiates both a British ""state-of-mind"", a fixture in an M/I production, but also the residue of the matter-of-fact scripts he read on Law & Order, where he played for a number of years.Besides the closed set and the disappointment of the lush appearance of the film, the lingering level of detail from the source film ""YELLOW ASPHALT: Red Roofs"" is disturbing.Like Ajay Devgan's ApaharanApaharancoming from Mississippi BurningMississippi Burningwhat truth of India is left?  How do we know?The two movies together make a good film making comparison of story development with regards to the presentation of so called ""universal stories"" and cinematic truth that probably could not be found in a film class.

East meets West, man meets woman and; to borrow from another movie: ""Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and screaming."" If you add in a pistol, make sure someone has life insurance. Chekov's gun principle rules in the theater of the British Raj.There is a fair wrinkle in this variation of the Raj the love triangle (is it a polygon if the lovers are both also married to others?). The weight of the impending tragedy will fall on NK Neeland the Indian brains behind the Imperial British Heel, sorry this time he is just a planter. NK lives bestride the two cultures. He also has to deal with the rising Indian Independence movement. Ultimately he has to handle all of the details of his boss's love affair then handle all of its implications for the planter and for his own village.Before the Rains is not a bad movie.

But this is a forbidden affair as the woman is married and cheating on her husband has great consequences on all involved in the affair.Without disclosing more, the love and life in paradise, turns into a tragedy of gigantic proportions.  Young woman dies, her village tribe seeks revenge for her loss of life; British landowner looses everything: his family, his money, his future.Interesting meditation on different times in India when locals were seeking independence from the British rule.  Cultural differences are so vast that until it is too late neither side understands the other.  It is also a story that tells us that all actions have their consequences.  Some of them affect us personally, the others affect the ones closest to us.  Self-gratification leads to tragedy regardless of one's cultural background.",4,Every love has consequences,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,1186,"['Emotionally', 'charged', 'story', 'British', 'expatriate', 'living', 'Southern', 'India', 'search', 'riches', '1930s', 'British', 'are', 'moving', 'exporting', 'tea', 'India', 'exporting', 'spices', 'pepper', 'cinnamon', 'cardamom', 'Away', 'wife', 'child', 'lonely', 'British', 'landowner', 'love', 'affair', 'servant', 'beautiful', 'Indian', 'woman', 'local', 'village', 'forbidden', 'affair', 'woman', 'married', 'cheating', 'husband', 'great', 'consequences', 'involved', 'affair.Without', 'disclosing', 'more', 'love', 'life', 'paradise', 'tragedy', 'gigantic', 'proportions', 'Young', 'woman', 'village', 'tribe', 'revenge', 'loss', 'life', 'British', 'landowner', 'everything', 'family', 'money', 'future.Interesting', 'meditation', 'different', 'times', 'India', 'when', 'locals', 'were', 'seeking', 'independence', 'British', 'rule', 'Cultural', 'differences', 'are', 'so', 'vast', 'too', 'late', 'side', 'other', 'also', 'story', 'actions', 'have', 'consequences', 'affect', 'personally', 'others', 'affect', 'ones', 'closest', 'Self-gratification', 'tragedy', 'regardless', 'one', 'cultural', 'background']",Before The Rains
1172766,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001BNFR76,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","***1/2A mixture of social commentary and period-piece melodrama, ""Before the Rains,"" directed by Santosh Sivan, takes place in India in 1937 during the waning days of British rule.Henry Moores (Linus Roache) is an English businessman living with his wife (Jennifer Ehle, the ghost-wife from ""A Gifted Man"") and young son (Leo Benedict) in the Madras district of colonial India, where he is supervising the construction of a road that must be completed before the monsoonal rains begin to fall.  Moores is also having a clandestine affair with a beautiful Indian housekeeper named Sajani (Nandita Das), who is herself married to an unloving and abusive husband from the village.  Through a series of tragic circumstances, the affair manages to have lasting repercussions not only for Moores and his family but for Anglo-Indian relations in the area as well.The story by Cathy Rabin serves as a microcosm for what was occurring on a national scale at that time, as the oppressed natives were just beginning to assert their right to oust the British and become the leaders of their own nation.  Thus, Moores' dilemma becomes much more than just a personal one of love and marital infidelity due to the extraordinary circumstances taking place around him.  For not only is Henry breaking his own marriage vows with the affair; he is violating any number of social taboos involving race and class structure as well. The situation becomes even more complicated when another of his servants, T.K. Neelan (Rahul Boss), becomes a pawn in Moores' game to extricate himself from the consequences of his actions, and T.K. is finally forced to choose between his desire to be a part of a growing future promised by the Brits and his innate loyalty to his own people who serve under them.  The triumph of the screenplay is that each of these characters emerges as a well-meaning but often flawed individual caught in a world greater than his or her own private passions.Even though there are times when the gravity of the social issues feels a bit diminished by the contrivance of the plotting - as if the melodrama were not commensurate in importance and value with the seriousness of the subject matter - on the whole, this is a well-acted, thoughtful and gripping drama that makes important points about colonialism, class structure, personal morality and the untamable nature of the human heart.",3,social commentary ultimately wins out over melodrama,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,2385,"['***1/2A', 'mixture', 'social', 'commentary', 'period-piece', 'melodrama', 'Rains', 'directed', 'Santosh', 'Sivan', 'place', 'India', '1937', 'waning', 'days', 'British', 'rule.Henry', 'Moores', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'English', 'businessman', 'living', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'ghost-wife', 'A', 'Gifted', 'Man', 'young', 'son', 'Leo', 'Benedict', 'Madras', 'district', 'colonial', 'India', 'where', 'supervising', 'construction', 'road', 'must', 'be', 'completed', 'monsoonal', 'rains', 'begin', 'fall', 'Moores', 'also', 'having', 'clandestine', 'affair', 'beautiful', 'Indian', 'housekeeper', 'named', 'Sajani', 'Nandita', 'Das', 'who', 'married', 'unloving', 'abusive', 'husband', 'village', 'series', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'affair', 'have', 'lasting', 'repercussions', 'not', 'only', 'Moores', 'family', 'Anglo-Indian', 'relations', 'area', 'well.The', 'story', 'Cathy', 'Rabin', 'microcosm', 'what', 'was', 'occurring', 'national', 'scale', 'time', 'oppressed', 'natives', 'were', 'just', 'beginning', 'assert', 'right', 'oust', 'British', 'become', 'leaders', 'own', 'nation', 'Thus', 'Moores', 'dilemma', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'personal', 'one', 'love', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'due', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'taking', 'place', 'not', 'only', 'Henry', 'breaking', 'own', 'marriage', 'vows', 'affair', 'violating', 'number', 'social', 'taboos', 'involving', 'race', 'class', 'structure', 'well', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'servants', 'T.K', 'Neelan', 'Rahul', 'Boss', 'pawn', 'Moores', 'game', 'extricate', 'consequences', 'actions', 'T.K', 'finally', 'forced', 'choose', 'desire', 'be', 'part', 'growing', 'future', 'promised', 'Brits', 'innate', 'loyalty', 'own', 'people', 'who', 'serve', 'triumph', 'screenplay', 'characters', 'emerges', 'well-meaning', 'often', 'flawed', 'individual', 'caught', 'world', 'greater', 'own', 'private', 'passions.Even', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'gravity', 'social', 'issues', 'bit', 'diminished', 'contrivance', 'plotting', 'melodrama', 'were', 'not', 'commensurate', 'importance', 'value', 'seriousness', 'subject', 'matter', 'whole', 'well-acted', 'thoughtful', 'gripping', 'drama', 'important', 'points', 'colonialism', 'class', 'structure', 'personal', 'morality', 'untamable', 'nature', 'human', 'heart']",Before The Rains

It's exquisite to look at, while actually boasting a plot that moves right along, and stars some gorgeous people giving us a passionate, moving story of a mature interracial love affair.Linus Roache(Batman Begins) stars as Henry Moores, an Englishman who's big in the spice trade: he's settled on an estate in India, and hopes to build a road that would enable him to greatly expand the productivity of his plantations.  The beauteous Jennifer Ehle (Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)), turns in a restrained performance as his wife Laura.  Rahul Bose turns in a thoughtful performance as TK Neelan, a resident of the local village, caught between his respect for the past, and his hopes for a bright English-assisted future.  The always reliable veteran John Standing is Charles Humphries, a grandee of the local expat English community.  And the beautiful Nandita Das is stunning as Sajani,the servant who catches Moores' eye, with disastrous results for all concerned.Add a star if you are a particular fan of the Raj; and, whatever you do, keep the tissues handy.",4,"In a Lovely, Evocative Time and Place",1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,1434,"['Rains', 'recently-released', 'Anglo-Indian', 'film', 'set', 'South', 'India', 'waning', 'days', 'British', 'colonial', 'Raj', 'lovely', 'evocative', 'time', 'place', 'certain', 'fascination', 'still', 'been', 'looked', 'number', 'British', 'films', 'several', 'really', 'slow-moving', '-films', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'film-making', 'school', 'exquisite', 'look', 'actually', 'boasting', 'plot', 'right', 'along', 'gorgeous', 'people', 'giving', 'passionate', 'moving', 'story', 'mature', 'interracial', 'love', 'affair.Linus', 'Roache', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Henry', 'Moores', 'Englishman', 'who', 'big', 'spice', 'trade', 'settled', 'estate', 'India', 'build', 'road', 'would', 'enable', 'greatly', 'expand', 'productivity', 'plantations', 'beauteous', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Special', 'Edition', 'A', 'E', '1996', 'restrained', 'performance', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Rahul', 'Bose', 'thoughtful', 'performance', 'TK', 'Neelan', 'resident', 'local', 'village', 'caught', 'respect', 'past', 'hopes', 'bright', 'English-assisted', 'future', 'always', 'reliable', 'veteran', 'John', 'Standing', 'Charles', 'Humphries', 'grandee', 'local', 'expat', 'English', 'community', 'beautiful', 'Nandita', 'Das', 'stunning', 'Sajani', 'servant', 'who', 'Moores', 'eye', 'disastrous', 'results', 'concerned.Add', 'star', 'are', 'particular', 'fan', 'Raj', 'do', 'keep', 'tissues', 'handy']",Before The Rains

1172769,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001BNFR76,Z Hayes,"[7, 7]","""Before the Rains"" is a sumptuous period drama set during the waning days of British imperialism in India. Most of the natives are clamoring for freedom from the colonialists yet the British carry on with their enterprises - one such enterprise is by Henry Moores [Linus Roache], a British tea planter who hopes to build a road to transport spices from the Indian state of Kerala. Moores is ably assisted by his loyal right-hand man TK [Rahul Bose] who tries to maintain a balance between two worlds, East and West, often precariously. Moores' family is back in England and from the beginning of the movie, viewers are made aware of his illicit affair with his beguiling maidservant, the married Sanjani [Nandita Das].When a tryst between the two is discovered by two village kids, it sets off a calamitious chain of events - Moores' family [consisting of Jennifer Ehle as his wife and a young son] return only to find things have changed, Sanjani's brute of a husband tries to physically beat the truth out of her, and TK is stuck between his loyalty to Moores and his desire to do what is right. A tragic incident acts as a catalyst that propels the story towards its inevitable conclusion.Some may feel the story is all too predictable - the 'evil' colonialist who takes advantage of the innocent local woman, the Indian assistant who wishes to straddle both worlds but finds himself not fully belonging to either one etc, but ""Before the Rains"" is more than that. Moores' character as played by Linus Roache does show traces of redemption, and neither is Nandita Das' Sanjani just a plain old gullible village woman. This is a woman who fully knows the repercussions of her actions and is altogether willing, albeit naive. TK as credibly portrayed by Rahul Bose shows us the inner conflict in a man who believes in unity between the colonialists and Indians, yet finds that in the end, he does need to make a choice - as his father tells him ""No one gets lost on a straight road"".The cinematography is achingly beautiful [not surprising given that the director Santosh Sivan is a successful one himself] and the score is haunting -it captures the beauty of Kerala [which happens to be one of the most beautiful states in Southern India] in all its resplendent glory. All in all, I'd recommend this to those who love period dramas, and also fans of Merchant-Ivory productions.",4,"""No one gets lost on a straight road""",1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,2379,"['Rains', 'sumptuous', 'period', 'drama', 'set', 'waning', 'days', 'British', 'imperialism', 'India', 'Most', 'natives', 'are', 'clamoring', 'freedom', 'colonialists', 'yet', 'British', 'carry', 'enterprises', 'one', 'such', 'enterprise', 'Henry', 'Moores', '[', 'Linus', 'Roache', ']', 'British', 'tea', 'planter', 'who', 'build', 'road', 'transport', 'spices', 'Indian', 'state', 'Kerala', 'Moores', 'ably', 'assisted', 'loyal', 'right-hand', 'man', 'TK', '[', 'Rahul', 'Bose', ']', 'who', 'maintain', 'balance', 'two', 'worlds', 'East', 'West', 'often', 'precariously', 'Moores', 'family', 'back', 'England', 'beginning', 'movie', 'viewers', 'are', 'made', 'aware', 'illicit', 'affair', 'beguiling', 'maidservant', 'married', 'Sanjani', '[', 'Nandita', 'Das', ']', 'tryst', 'two', 'discovered', 'two', 'village', 'kids', 'off', 'calamitious', 'chain', 'events', 'Moores', 'family', 'consisting', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'wife', 'young', 'son', ']', 'return', 'only', 'find', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'Sanjani', 'brute', 'husband', 'physically', 'beat', 'truth', 'her', 'TK', 'stuck', 'loyalty', 'Moores', 'desire', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'tragic', 'incident', 'acts', 'catalyst', 'story', 'inevitable', 'conclusion.Some', 'may', 'feel', 'story', 'too', 'predictable', ""'evil"", 'colonialist', 'who', 'advantage', 'innocent', 'local', 'woman', 'Indian', 'assistant', 'who', 'straddle', 'worlds', 'not', 'fully', 'belonging', 'one', 'etc', 'Rains', 'more', 'Moores', 'character', 'played', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'show', 'traces', 'redemption', 'Nandita', 'Das', 'Sanjani', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'gullible', 'village', 'woman', 'woman', 'who', 'fully', 'repercussions', 'actions', 'altogether', 'willing', 'albeit', 'naive', 'TK', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'Rahul', 'Bose', 'inner', 'conflict', 'man', 'who', 'unity', 'colonialists', 'Indians', 'yet', 'end', 'need', 'make', 'choice', 'father', 'one', 'lost', 'straight', 'road', '.The', 'cinematography', 'achingly', 'beautiful', '[', 'not', 'surprising', 'given', 'director', 'Santosh', 'Sivan', 'successful', 'one', ']', 'score', 'haunting', '-it', 'captures', 'beauty', 'Kerala', '[', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'states', 'Southern', 'India', ']', 'resplendent', 'glory', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'who', 'love', 'period', 'dramas', 'also', 'fans', 'Merchant-Ivory', 'productions']",Before The Rains
