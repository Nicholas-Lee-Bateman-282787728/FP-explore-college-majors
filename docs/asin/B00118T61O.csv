1130594,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B00118T61O,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","Chit is at the end of his rope after losing his job while the bills continue to pile up. Opportunity arrives in the form of a mysterious phone call that offers him the chance to win $1M if he can complete 13 challenges. For each one he completes, a larger sum of money will be deposited into his bank account, but failure at any single task will end the game immediately and remove the funds. How far will Chit be willing to go to win the $1M and change his life forever? The answer is, pretty far. The tasks begin simply enough with Chit having to kill and eat a fly; two challenges down, and quick cash. His next objectives quickly turn to violence, cruelty, and worse as he progresses forward. 13 is beautifully shot, smartly written, and wickedly funny. Terrence has such an unconventional look that makes him recognizable and relatable as an average, everyday working man. The sad and pathetic plight he finds himself in allows the audience to identify with the character even throughout his deplorable acts. There are admittedly several shocking gross out moments in the script which may turn some viewers off, but the absurdity of the scenes in the context of the film makes them easier to accept. The plot itself often feels like a cross between SAW and THE TRUMAN SHOW, though it has its own clear and distinctive voice. While it may not be the typical Horror film in the traditional sense, it is filled with equal parts suspense and dark humor, which make it enjoyable for a larger audience. I love this film.

1130595,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00118T61O,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","Chit is having one of the worst days anyone could possibly have. Prame, the guy who always seems to outsell everyone else in the office, swiped a sale right out from under his nose, then his car was repossessed, then he lost his job, he has bills piling up, and his mom's asking him for money. He has no idea what to do. And then he gets a strange phone call. Whoever it is knows all about him. They're offering him a chance to make something of himself. He's been selected to be a contestant on a game show. What does Chit have to lose? As the game progresses, Chit finds out that he can win up to 100 million baht if he completes 13 challenges. The only problem is that not only do the challenges get more and more disturbing as the game goes along, but they're also getting darker and more twisted. There are rules to the game and if Chit breaks any one of them, the game ends and he loses everything. Will Chit still be left standing by the time this is all over? Will his financial problems be solved?I guess this is translated a few different ways. IMDb and Netflix have different names for the characters than the version I watched. In the version I watched, the main character was named Phuchit(called Chit throughout most of the film), but Netflix and IMDb list him as Pusit. I guess the English dub lists him as Chad. The film is also known as 13: Beloved. All the technicalities aside, the DVD cover may be a bit misleading. It might make you think you're in for a bloodbath or a serial killer type of film. This isn't the case. This is an intelligent thriller. Possibly more intelligent than you first give it credit for.Films from Thailand seem to be some of the only films that are still somewhat original these days. That's not to say the film doesn't have its similarities to other films. The most obvious being its similarities to Saw. But instead of ripping off a successful horror film just to put out another one to try and cash in on the same audience like so many others have done before it, they took an idea associated with the film, put their spin on it, came up with a well developed story, and turned it into a thriller that builds up as it goes along. The only factor that drags the film down is the use of CGI in the film. I can only think of two scenes off the top of my head that used CGI, but you can tell it's just that...below par CGI. You really start to feel bad for Chit though. As the game drags on, you realize there's nothing Chit won't do to try and get his life back on track.The one thing that may make or break the viewer's opinion of the film is the ending. From other reviews I've skimmed through, the majority of people seem to hate it. I think it fit the film. As the game gets into its closing stages, Chit keeps telling himself that he's still human even after the horrific events he's witnessed tonight and were his doing. The ending fits that logic. There is a slight twist at the end, but I don't want to spoil anymore than what I already have.13: Game of Death is a Thai thriller that I think just about anyone can sit down and enjoy. It's well-written, there's more character development than you may be expecting, it's suspenseful, it picks up momentum as the film progresses, and it builds towards an ending you may not be expecting.

1130607,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00118T61O,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 4]","13: Game of Death (Chukiat Sakveerakul, 2006)13: Game of Death, an incredibly silly Thai flick in the vein of The Game or 13 Tzameti, could have been a stellar example of, and addition to, the genre. A lot of the ingredients work really well here, and for the most part, the movie draws you in and won't let you look away. And yet there are some times where everything falls apart so spectacularly that the viewer is left wondering if the movie's entire crew got fired halfway through and a bunch of seventh-graders were brought in to replace them.The plot is a simple one: Pusit (Bangkok Loco's Krissada Terrence) is having a really, really bad day. After one of his co-workers stole a client out from under him and made a big sale, he got laid off from his job. His ex-girlfriend is on her way to becoming a big pop star, and left him in the dust as soon as was convenient. He's drowning in debt. His car just got repossessed, and his only real friend, Tawn (Shutter's Achita Wuthinounsurasit), is so indecisive that the best she can come up with is to offer him a smoke out in the back hallway of the building where he, erm, used to work. Once she heads back inside, Pusit gets a very odd call. After a bit of back-and-forth, he's presented with a challenge: if he can kill a fly that's buzzing around his head with a newspaper, he'll be given 50,000 baht (roughly five thousand dollars American). Once he does, he gets another call, and is told that if he can complete the rest of the game, which consists of thirteen challenges, the ultimate prize is ten million. When the mysterious caller on the other end asks if Pusit is interested, he doesn't hesitate very long. The challenges, however, get a lot harder, and a lot more degrading, as the game goes on...The major flaw the movie has is that it doesn't really know what it wants to be, and so it pinballs from screwball comedy to action film to gore flick to drama and back again. Obviously, movies have integrated genres successfully for decades, but 13 never quite seems to know how to go about it, and the different pieces of the film jar against one another far more than they should. Normally that would be a minor gripe, but we end up veering between different faces of this movie so many times, and so quickly, that there's a kind of metaphysical nausea to be had while watching it.Other than that, it's not a bad little movie at all, though I can pretty much guarantee you at least one challenge will squick you out. (Which one probably depends on what baggage you bring to the table, but Sakveerakul wanted to make sure he covered as many disgusting bases as possible. Red Room ain't got nothing on this bitch.) The acting is good enough, and Krissada Terrence has some fine comic timing.

1130609,A1C139F5C7Y38P,B00118T61O,"The Matrix Fan ""Video Gamer since 1979.""","[21, 22]","I must say, When I brought this movie home last night, I thought I was just getting another horror movie rental, but I was pleasantly surprised by the psychological thriller known as 13: Game of Death. It presents us with a question: what would you be willing to do for money?The film starts off pretty slow - we're introduced to a man known as Chad or Chit (this depends if you watch the movie in English or Thai) and he's having a run of bad luck. His bank account is seriously overdrawn, his girlfriend has no more interest in him, and as the last straw, he's gotten fired from his job.When all seems lost, Chad gets a mysterious call on his cell phone. Apparently someone has been watching him for a long time and has chosen him to compete in a special game. The caller offers Chad a chance to change his life - if he completes 13 tasks set before him, he will be rewarded with one million dollars.However, if he decides to stop, Chad will lose all the money he has earned and will be left with nothing.At first, Chad has no problems with the challenges that are presented to him. Over time, however, they get increasingly difficult - physically, mentally, and morally. Chad realizes that there is something else going on behind this game...the task master seems to be setting up challenges which bring back memories Chad thought he had buried forever.Before the night is over, Chad will have to face all of his worst inner fears in his pursuit of the final cash prize.Will 13 be his lucky number?I feel 13: Game of Death succeeds on a number of levels. It serves as a taut thriller, keeping us guessing as to what Chad's next task will be. Each challenge is designed to provoke a morally questionable response from Chad, very similar to the delivery of traps in theSawfilm series.I also found myself wondering what I would be willing to do for a million dollars. There are some tasks I could do without breaking a sweat, other tasks would leave me feeling guilty for years. Surprisingly, there's quite a bit of humor thrown throughout the movie, and while it is surprisingly light on gore; it still manages to entertain and captivate our attentions.13: Game of Death is a clever morality tale hidden in a horror/thriller film. Sure, we'd all like to have the gold ring, enough money to solve all our problems. Unfortunately, money like this doesn't come without a steep price to pay - and Chad will be finding out just how high that price is.This film definitely makes an excellent rental, but if you're a fan of movies like Saw,Seven (New Line Platinum Series), or foreign films likeOldboy, I highly recommend this for ownership.The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because of the film's pacing and the misleading cover. The cover, in my opinion, will not entice people to buy it, it will lead them further down the shelves. As a foreign film, there is no American advertising to speak of...so the only way 13: Game of Death will get seen is by positive word of mouth.Spread the word, folks.",4,What would YOU do for a million dollars?,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,3012,"['must', 'say', 'When', 'brought', 'movie', 'home', 'last', 'night', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'horror', 'movie', 'rental', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'known', '13', 'Game', 'Death', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'money', 'film', 'pretty', 'slow', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'man', 'known', 'Chad', 'Chit', 'watch', 'movie', 'English', 'Thai', 'having', 'run', 'bad', 'luck', 'bank', 'account', 'seriously', 'overdrawn', 'girlfriend', 'more', 'interest', 'last', 'straw', 'gotten', 'fired', 'job.When', 'lost', 'Chad', 'mysterious', 'call', 'cell', 'phone', 'Apparently', 'someone', 'been', 'watching', 'long', 'time', 'chosen', 'compete', 'special', 'game', 'caller', 'offers', 'Chad', 'chance', 'change', 'life', '13', 'tasks', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'one', 'million', 'dollars.However', 'stop', 'Chad', 'will', 'lose', 'money', 'earned', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'nothing.At', 'first', 'Chad', 'problems', 'challenges', 'are', 'presented', 'time', 'however', 'get', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'physically', 'mentally', 'morally', 'Chad', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'game', 'task', 'master', 'be', 'setting', 'up', 'challenges', 'bring', 'back', 'memories', 'Chad', 'thought', 'had', 'buried', 'forever.Before', 'night', 'Chad', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'worst', 'inner', 'fears', 'pursuit', 'final', 'cash', 'prize.Will', '13', 'be', 'lucky', 'number', 'feel', '13', 'Game', 'Death', 'number', 'levels', 'taut', 'thriller', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'what', 'Chad', 'next', 'task', 'will', 'be', 'challenge', 'designed', 'provoke', 'morally', 'questionable', 'response', 'Chad', 'very', 'similar', 'delivery', 'traps', 'theSawfilm', 'series.I', 'also', 'found', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'million', 'dollars', 'are', 'tasks', 'could', 'do', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'other', 'tasks', 'would', 'leave', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'years', 'Surprisingly', 'quite', 'bit', 'humor', 'thrown', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'light', 'gore', 'still', 'entertain', 'captivate', 'attentions.13', 'Game', 'Death', 'clever', 'morality', 'tale', 'hidden', 'horror/thriller', 'film', 'Sure', ""'d"", 'have', 'gold', 'ring', 'enough', 'money', 'solve', 'problems', 'Unfortunately', 'money', ""n't"", 'come', 'steep', 'price', 'pay', 'Chad', 'will', 'be', 'finding', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'high', 'price', 'is.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'excellent', 'rental', ""'re"", 'fan', 'movies', 'Saw', 'Seven', 'New', 'Line', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'foreign', 'films', 'likeOldboy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'ownership.The', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'film', 'pacing', 'misleading', 'cover', 'cover', 'opinion', 'will', 'not', 'entice', 'people', 'buy', 'will', 'lead', 'further', 'shelves', 'foreign', 'film', 'American', 'advertising', 'speak', 'only', 'way', '13', 'Game', 'Death', 'will', 'get', 'seen', 'positive', 'word', 'mouth.Spread', 'word', 'folks']",13: Game of Death

The rules are he has to complete all of the tasks, follow their every instruction and on no accounts allow anyone to find out about the `game' - any breach and it is game over.As you have guessed the tasks become increasingly nasty and abhorrent. A couple of things to point out, his mobile has a ring tone like a police siren, which acts to ramp up the tension every time it rings; he is also a `half breed' as his abusive father is an American. This means he has often suffered racial abuse and that comes into play too. Parts of this film are truly sickening, but there are some rare comic lighter moments, and you do need them. The acting is great, the music is excellent and the story will have you gripped. There are a couple of plot holes that annoyed me slightly, but to say what they are would be a plot spoiler. There are also one or two too many coincidences, but that aside this is a really great film.The rights have been bought in America by The Weinstein Company, an offshoot of Miramax, so a remake is planned. As ever I think you should see the original first, there are some cultural clashes that might mean you do not quite get why one `task' is worse than another, but quite frankly as they progress past number 5, they are all pretty bad. If you are a world cinema fan this is one you should definitely see, if you are on the squeamish side though, might be best to avoid, I thoroughly enjoyed it - well most of it anyway.",4,Brilliant and disturbing.,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,2301,"['one', 'films', 'missed', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'so', 'was', 'rather', 'pleased', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'Krissada', 'Sukosol', 'Clapp', 'Puchit', 'salesman', 'who', 'had', 'bad', 'three', 'months', 'car', 'repossessed', 'one', 'co-workers', 'nicks', 'one', 'clients', 'mum', 'keeps', 'borrowing', 'money', 'thinking', 'high', 'flyer', 'oh', 'successful', 'girl', 'friend', 'dumped', 'too', 'Then', 'boss', 'Just', 'when', 'hopeless', 'call', 'mobile', 'offered', '10,000', 'baht', 'swat', 'fly', 'annoying', 'him.On', 'completion', 'task', 'sure', 'enough', 'money', 'gone', 'account', 'then', 'explain', 'task', 'two', 'rules', 'will', 'be', 'thirteen', 'different', 'tasks', 'time', 'amount', 'will', 'increase', 'final', 'thirteenth', 'one', 'completion', 'will', 'get', '100million', 'baht', 'rules', 'are', 'complete', 'tasks', 'follow', 'instruction', 'accounts', 'allow', 'anyone', 'find', 'out', 'game', 'breach', 'game', 'over.As', 'have', 'guessed', 'tasks', 'become', 'increasingly', 'nasty', 'abhorrent', 'couple', 'things', 'point', 'out', 'mobile', 'ring', 'tone', 'police', 'siren', 'ramp', 'up', 'tension', 'time', 'also', 'half', 'breed', 'abusive', 'father', 'American', 'often', 'suffered', 'racial', 'abuse', 'play', 'too', 'Parts', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'sickening', 'are', 'rare', 'comic', 'lighter', 'moments', 'do', 'need', 'acting', 'great', 'music', 'excellent', 'story', 'will', 'have', 'gripped', 'are', 'couple', 'plot', 'holes', 'annoyed', 'slightly', 'say', 'what', 'are', 'would', 'be', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'are', 'also', 'one', 'two', 'too', 'many', 'coincidences', 'aside', 'really', 'great', 'film.The', 'rights', 'have', 'been', 'bought', 'America', 'Weinstein', 'Company', 'offshoot', 'Miramax', 'remake', 'planned', 'ever', 'think', 'should', 'see', 'original', 'first', 'are', 'cultural', 'clashes', 'might', 'mean', 'do', 'not', 'quite', 'get', 'why', 'one', 'task', 'worse', 'quite', 'frankly', 'progress', 'past', 'number', '5', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'are', 'world', 'cinema', 'fan', 'one', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'are', 'squeamish', 'side', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'avoid', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'well', 'most', 'anyway']",13: Game of Death
