494885,A3CSRP3P4U9HI,B000006RE8,Alan R. Holyoak,"[16, 16]","Though this movie is now nearly 20 years old, it is still extremely watchable.  It does not rely on special effects.  It, rather, relies on the development of Hitchcock-like suspense.In the movie, the magazine  reporter fiance of a CIA computer specialist is executed by terrorists via  random drawing while she is on assignment in europe.  This infuriates the  main protagonist of the movie -- the CIA employee.  He collects enough  information on CIA sensitive activities to blackmail the agency into  allowing him to go into eastern europe so he can locate and eliminate the  terrorists that killed his fiance himself.He is the amateur in a  professional's game.  The plot is believable, the suspense is tangeable,  and the story line not predictable.I promise that if you like suspense  movies, you will love this one!  The acting, from main and supporting  characters, is good.  I particularly enjoyed the character who played the  father of the murdered fiance.  CIA officers and execs also play their  roles (though perhaps a bit stereotyped) quite well.5 stars.",5,An intelligent movie with suspense and a true underdog,959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,1069,"['movie', 'now', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'extremely', 'watchable', 'not', 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'rather', 'relies', 'development', 'Hitchcock-like', 'suspense.In', 'movie', 'magazine', 'reporter', 'fiance', 'CIA', 'computer', 'specialist', 'executed', 'terrorists', 'random', 'drawing', 'assignment', 'europe', 'main', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'CIA', 'employee', 'enough', 'information', 'CIA', 'sensitive', 'activities', 'blackmail', 'agency', 'allowing', 'go', 'eastern', 'europe', 'can', 'locate', 'eliminate', 'terrorists', 'killed', 'fiance', 'himself.He', 'amateur', 'professional', 'game', 'plot', 'believable', 'suspense', 'tangeable', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'predictable.I', 'promise', 'like', 'suspense', 'movies', 'will', 'love', 'one', 'acting', 'main', 'supporting', 'characters', 'good', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'father', 'murdered', 'fiance', 'CIA', 'officers', 'execs', 'also', 'play', 'roles', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'stereotyped', 'quite', 'well.5', 'stars']",Amateur VHS

The fact he wasn't part of the gun set doesn't make him less a spy. The story however wants you to think of him as a helpless  bookworm. John Savage does one of the best roles of his career as a CIA agent that has been relegated to desk duty research which is his forte. When his fiance is killed overseas by ruthless terrorist he wants justice. With the help of his abilities he is able to formulate a plan and apply pressure in a way the CIA can't refuse. Good acting, directing, camera work, and music. Good action and great locations. A very entertaining movie that has been far overdue getting to DVD. Fans of spy movies should enjoy it and many that like action movies as well. Just as in the real world of espionage, all the loose ends aren't always tied in nice little knots.
