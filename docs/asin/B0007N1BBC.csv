Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe star in this adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell' s book about the industrial region in the north of England in the mid-nineteenth century. Margaret Hale (played by Denby Ashe) moves from the south of England to Milton, a factory town of cotton mills, gloomy weather, hard people and gray buildings where she meets cotton mill owner John Thornton ( played by Armitage) when he is beating one of his workers in the mill. Thorough worker's riots,  strikes, and meeting in society, they become better acquainted and Thornton falls in love with Margaret who refuses him because she doesn't like him and he is in trade. When both of her parents have died, she returns to the south where she begins to appreciate him and Milton.. After inheriting a fortune, she goes north to invest in the mill and returning to the south by train, she spies Thornton on the northbound train.

883266,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B0007N1BBC,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[3, 3]","This BBC costume drama is like ""Pride and Prejudice"" with guts and muscle. It tells the story of Margaret Hale, strong-minded daughter of a village vicar and John Thornton, tough northern mill owner. Hale's father refuses to sign a pledge of Church loyalty and is forced to leave his post. His family is uprooted from the beautiful countryside of the south of England, where life meanders on as it always has, to the tough, grimy, polluted northern mill town of Milton where Mr. Thornton and other masters are busy running the engine of the Industrial Revolution.The author, Mrs Gaskell, who herself lived in both North and South, is unblinking in chronicling the hardship and cruelty of the ""dark Satanic mills"" including the degradations of child labor, dangerous machines, excessive hours, low wages and air polluted with cotton that coats the workers' lungs and sends them to early graves. She is remarkably fair mediating between workers trying to form a union that will protect some of their rights and ensure a fair wage and the owners engaged in cut-throat competition.The acting is wonderful, especially by the two principals who have real chemistry. There is a kind of Pride and Prejudice about their affair, which begins as in Austen with a botched proposal and proceeds through a process in which they learn to respect and then to love one another. The secondary roles are also great, especially the redoubtable Sinead Cusack as Thornton's no-nonsense mother.

883272,A1H6II8C6LM82K,B0007N1BBC,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This is an excellent film adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's masterpiece North & South, the story of a woman who moves from a lovely, countryside existence to a English textile mill town due to her mother's health concerns.  The film is not the typical English garden, cottages, everything is lovely atmosphere but instead reflects the overall atmosphere of a mill town:  many dark, rainy days, little grass, views of factory areas, dark colors for costumes, and very impoverished characters.  Even the leads are not ""hollywood handsome"" in the typical sense....yet this is the beauty of the film in that the setting is realistically reflective of a mill town, prior to unionized labor, when mill workers were not protected by health laws, or child labor laws, and where illness and want were a matter of course.This is not a happy, wappy, let's go to the ball sort of movie...but one that deals with the serious socioeconomic issues of life in such a town between the mill owner and his desire to keep the people employed and his mill working, the workers who are underpaid and undernourished and want the mill owner to pay more, and the main character who wants things to improve for both sides.  There is a slight romance, characters in general are low key, and the focus is on relationships as well as the economic realities that affect those relationships.  Overall it is not a cheery film but a poignant,worthwhile, entrancing one, with a feel good ending.  An excellent, serious film, as you can see from all the other reviews. (G-rated).If you are looking for a film of similar superlative quality with a less serious, somber slant,  the same author wrote ""Wives & Daughters"" which is more Jane Austen like, in that the emphasis is on social interactions in a small English village, beautiful costuming, a romance as well as an intriguing plot and many wonderful characters.

However wonderful the book may be, I believe that this adaptation lived up to it. The screenplay, the actors, and all the supporting work (sets, costume, etc) were tremendous.What a wonderful love story, the feeling of inadequacy from Thornton to deserve the love of a lady like Margaret was heartfelt. Margaret, on her part, is a strong female character and her dislike for Thornton was real - she didn't get caught up in his wealth, but in the person. Then when he proved to her that he was good, she didn't throw herself at him but maintained a respectful front. I believe she did so because she didn't want to belabor the fact that she hurt him when she rejected him and he has moved on. Then there was the misunderstanding with Frederick that kept Thornton at a distance upon her departure, but he did decide to after her when he realized that there wasn't another man in the way. I could watch the scene in the end at the train station over and over..so romantic!I didn't care too much about the whole strike deal, but I did like the personal story regarding Margaret's friendship with the Higgins family and also the future dealings between Nicholas and Thornton.

883280,A1KU4WYGZBAX0G,B0007N1BBC,Ansley,"[3, 3]","I've watched many period dramas, and this one stands out in its appeal for people whether romantics or not.  This one is based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel _North and South_.  It has romantic elements without having romance as the singular basis for its appeal.For viewers not so sold on romance, there is drama involving life's stages; social complexity of rich magnates vs. poor working class; questions of justice and fairness in legal situations (i.e. Fred's situation of having to live in Spain for fear of being hanged).  There is humor with the characters of Dixon and Fanny.  There are true to life transitions of two people overcoming their differences for the reward that is in their sameness.  All of these and more contribute to the opportunities for relatedness in this story.Other favorite aspects of this movie are the screenplay and the casting.  If I look too closely at the direction of some scenes, I notice that there is usually filming either very close to the subject or very far away, not as much in between.  My personal opinion is that more ""in between"" would've made the movie even better, but I do make it a point not to be distracted by something like that.  The story is easy to get lost in, and I always do.Special features include deleted scenes, an interview with Richard Armitage who plays Mr. Thornton, commentary etc.Clearly this already has a lot of recommendation.

883281,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B0007N1BBC,Anthony L.,"[4, 4]","North & South proves once again that BBC is the master of period dramas, and quality TV for an intellectual audience. Their programs remain consistently good, their casts do not succumb to the A-list Tendency, which is to cast actors for their name and fame only. Their production values remain very high, no matter the budget, and they consistently choose good subjects.Let us first speak of the acting. Richard Armitage is absolutely electrifying in his role as John Thornton, the stern and brooding mill owner who may seem cold on the outside, but is revealed to be an good and honourable man inside. His performance is absolutely phenomenal! Armitage, actually, is always phenomenal, and brings to his role charisma, gravitas, drama, and his piercing gaze and excellent voice. I recommend seeking out his excellent roles asJohn PorterandThorin Oakenshield. His presence on the screen is noticeable, and helps carry the miniseries by lending it his dramatic weight.The rest of the cast is brilliant, too. Daniela Denby-Ashe plays a pretty-faced but complex Margaret Hale, a worthy counterpoint to Armitage, Tim Pigott-Smith is typically excellent as her bookish father, and Brendan Coyle (Downton Abbey) steals the scenes as the leader of the uprising worker's unions. Sinead Cusack, wife of Jeremy Irons, plays in a strong performance as Thornton's mother. This show of excellence does not stop at the leads, but carries down even to the minor characters and extras. BBC, I tell you, is unrivalled in excellence.The production values, set design, and costumes are rich and realistic. The air is smokey and grey, the streets dark and muddy, the costumes rich, period-accurate, and lived-in. The sets feel real, mostly because they ARE, - lit by candles and smokey gas lamps, the wallpapers fading and the chairs perhaps a little scuffed. This is not the shiny, almost story-bookish unreality that plagues so many soap operas. The result is an engrossing and involving adaptation.The story does not disappoint, an effective mystery of romance, drama, character study, and political pronouncement on worker's leagues and fairness of rank. Gaskell's work is not as comedic as Austen's, nor as classic as Dicken's, but is still excellent, and a must-read for fans of the miniseries, or any of the aforementioned authours.I highly recommend North & South as both an engrossing character study and drama, and a showcase for some of the BBC's finest acting (courtesy of Richard Armitage and Co.) and excellent production values. Five stars!Also recommended, some of my favourite BBC classic dramas:Pride and Prejudice- the undisputed lord of all costume dramas, Pride and Prejudice, starring Colin Firth as Darcy. The best.Bleak House- solid cast in excellent series.Our Mutual Friend- Paul McGann in a rich, sumptuous Dickensian miniseries.Tess of the d'Urbervilles- the lovely Gemma Arterton in an all-star portrayal of Thomas Hardy's novel.Middlemarch- the always awesome Rufus Sewell in this elegant adaptation of the George Elliot novel.",5,"Excellent production values, a smart script, and fantastic acting combine to make another BBC triumph!",1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,3038,"['North', 'South', 'once', 'again', 'BBC', 'master', 'period', 'dramas', 'quality', 'TV', 'intellectual', 'audience', 'programs', 'remain', 'consistently', 'good', 'casts', 'do', 'not', 'succumb', 'A-list', 'Tendency', 'cast', 'actors', 'name', 'fame', 'only', 'production', 'values', 'remain', 'very', 'high', 'matter', 'budget', 'consistently', 'choose', 'good', 'subjects.Let', 'first', 'speak', 'acting', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'absolutely', 'electrifying', 'role', 'John', 'Thornton', 'stern', 'brooding', 'mill', 'owner', 'who', 'may', 'seem', 'cold', 'outside', 'revealed', 'be', 'good', 'honourable', 'man', 'inside', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'Armitage', 'actually', 'always', 'phenomenal', 'role', 'charisma', 'gravitas', 'drama', 'piercing', 'gaze', 'excellent', 'voice', 'recommend', 'seeking', 'out', 'excellent', 'roles', 'asJohn', 'PorterandThorin', 'Oakenshield', 'presence', 'screen', 'noticeable', 'carry', 'miniseries', 'lending', 'dramatic', 'weight.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'too', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'pretty-faced', 'complex', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'worthy', 'counterpoint', 'Armitage', 'Tim', 'Pigott-Smith', 'typically', 'excellent', 'bookish', 'father', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'scenes', 'leader', 'uprising', 'worker', 'unions', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'wife', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'strong', 'performance', 'Thornton', 'mother', 'show', 'excellence', 'not', 'stop', 'leads', 'down', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'extras', 'BBC', 'tell', 'unrivalled', 'excellence.The', 'production', 'values', 'set', 'design', 'costumes', 'are', 'rich', 'realistic', 'air', 'smokey', 'grey', 'streets', 'dark', 'muddy', 'costumes', 'rich', 'period-accurate', 'lived-in', 'sets', 'feel', 'real', 'mostly', 'ARE', 'lit', 'candles', 'smokey', 'gas', 'lamps', 'wallpapers', 'fading', 'chairs', 'perhaps', 'little', 'scuffed', 'not', 'shiny', 'almost', 'story-bookish', 'unreality', 'so', 'many', 'soap', 'operas', 'result', 'engrossing', 'involving', 'adaptation.The', 'story', 'not', 'disappoint', 'effective', 'mystery', 'romance', 'drama', 'character', 'study', 'political', 'pronouncement', 'worker', 'leagues', 'fairness', 'rank', 'Gaskell', 'work', 'not', 'as', 'comedic', 'Austen', 'as', 'classic', 'Dicken', 'still', 'excellent', 'must-read', 'fans', 'miniseries', 'aforementioned', 'authours.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'North', 'South', 'engrossing', 'character', 'study', 'drama', 'showcase', 'BBC', 'finest', 'acting', 'courtesy', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Co.', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'Five', 'stars', 'Also', 'recommended', 'favourite', 'BBC', 'classic', 'dramas', 'Pride', 'Prejudice-', 'undisputed', 'lord', 'costume', 'dramas', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'starring', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Darcy', 'best.Bleak', 'House-', 'solid', 'cast', 'excellent', 'series.Our', 'Mutual', 'Friend-', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'rich', 'sumptuous', 'Dickensian', 'miniseries.Tess', ""d'Urbervilles-"", 'lovely', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'all-star', 'portrayal', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'novel.Middlemarch-', 'always', 'awesome', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'elegant', 'adaptation', 'George', 'Elliot', 'novel']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"
883282,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,B0007N1BBC,A_Plain_Janeite,"[4, 4]","First off, period dramas are definitely my favorite genre of movie.Up until I viewed this series, ""Pride & Prejudice"" '95 easily took top honors as my all-time favorite!  Now I'd say, it's pretty much a tie between N&S; and P&P;!After all these years, I've finally decided to write a little review...I found this at my local library back in 2006, and promptly took it home to watch.  (At the time, the authors name didn't jog my memory.  I hadn't realized that she wrote ""Wives & Daughters""-- which had previously been turned into a miniseries, that I enjoyed when (PBS) Masterpiece Classic aired a few years before.)Being as I hadn't read the book prior to viewing, I had nothing to compare it to.I can't remember exactly if I watched the whole series in one sitting or not, but I distinctly recall my reaction to the ending-- I was in utter tears!  Never had an ending (a happy one at least) moved me so much as this one had!!  Of course, the classical score (""Northbound Train"") softly playing in the background packs quite the emotional punch as well!As far as initial impressions go-- I don't think anyone in the cast disappointed me with their performance.  The whole thing was expertly acted; in particular by the leads Daniela Denby-Ashe (Miss Hale), and Richard Armitage (Mr. Thornton)- both of whom were entirely unknown to me at the time.The locations, scenery, script, and musical score are all top notch!Last year I was able to finally read the book, which brought fresh understanding to its characters (especially Mr. Thornton)...For anyone inclined, I strongly urge you to read the book; you'll get so much more out of the story if you do! (Or perhaps the audio-book if you don't want to read all 400 some pages.)Beyond just a tale of romance, and social etiquette-- the book and movie really gives you a glimpse of the great change that the industrialized age was bringing to not just England, but the rest of the world. Which in turn had an impact on society in general.It really goes without saying that life back then was extremely hard; death came at a much earlier age than nowadays!The conditions the industrialized working class had to endure obviously led many to an early grave. Workers unions were created to ensure proper working conditions, and fair wages.Also, instead of being born into privilege, one could insure their own financial independence, and social status.Just like her contemporary (and friend) Charlotte Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell wrote strong female characters.  Like ""Jane Eyre"" I would imagine that ""Margaret Hale"" was not typical of the average woman of that period (or how they were expected to behave).  These characters were ahead of their times, and obviously so where the real women that wrote them--or at least aspired to be (much like Jane Austen)!**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**If I had to have one little quibble about the film verses the book, it would be the way in which the leads met.  Mr. Thornton although a ""bulldog"" never did that to a worker (in fact, as both later portrayed, he actually struck up a friendship with Nicholas Higgins)!One hit would have gotten the point across- instead he ended up beating him! While it's entirely possible that an owner/overseer could have done that back then for the reason stated in the movie, it just wasn't in line with his character. But I guess the writers/producer/director felt that the novel's reasons Margaret took a dislike to him maybe wouldn't translate to film well--especially since the way society viewed things back then and now, are so different; and therefore had to get to the point right away by having the character do that.Although the film ending is different than the book, I have no qualms with it.  Perhaps it's not the way things would have been done back then (at least in public), but in my opinion, it does convey more emotional depth than the actual book ending (which has an abrupt, almost unfinished feel to it).___________If you desire further understanding of the Victorian era/life, here are a few things I can recommend to view: ""Who the Dickens is Mrs. Gaskell?"" (found on disc 3 of ""Wives & Daughters"" in ""The Elizabeth Gaskell Collection"" dvd collection).  Historical (reality) documentary shows: ""Victorian Farm"", ""Victorian Pharmacy"", ""The Supersizers Go...Victorian"", and ""Turn Back Time: The High Street (1st Episode: Victorian Era)"".**P.S.** There is a new (mini) series called ""The Mill""; based on factual accounts/documents of the Quarry Bank Mill in Cheshire, England.  Set in the year 1833, during the height of the industrial revolution.  There are 4 episodes total; and a second series/season has been commissioned.  All I can say is, if you desire to know how  mill workers of the time lived, you will find it in this series.  It's very much in the vein of ""North & South"": very realistic, no glossing over (also comparable to recent Dickens adaptations such as ""Little Dorrit"", and ""Bleak House"").  It air's on Channel 4 in the UK, but Acorn Media UK will release it on dvd in August (2013).  FYI, it's also been picked up for a second series (season).Another mini (2 episodes) documentary series recommendation is ""How The North Was Built (with Robson Green)""-- about the 18th/19th century industrial revolution!In conclusion, I feel this series definitely did the book justice, despite the 2 discrepancies.  And highly recommend this miniseries to those that enjoy period dramas (particularly those by Charles Dickens, the Bronts, Thomas Hardy, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony Trollope, Catherine Cookson, etc.)!**EDIT**: The 1975 BBC miniseries adaptation of ""North & South"" (starring Patrick Stewart and Rosalie Shanks), has been released from Acorn Media.

883283,A2U549OUP6XJ1B,B0007N1BBC,"April79marie ""April79marie""","[41, 44]","This BBC film is a pure jewel! Like some of the reviewers on Amazon, I didn't see the film on TV because French TV seldom broadcast British films like Pride and Prejudice and North&South.; But luckily for me, I have a strong liking for everything that is English (cinema, literature, theatre and music) and I am always deeply interested in what British TV can produce. I've seen the BBC Pride and Prejudice many times (I've also read the book) I like it -even though my preference goes to the new 2005 movie (sorry, can't help it)- and I am even familiar with Elizabeth Gaskell's work (I've read Mary Barton and I've started reading North&South;). So, on reading the positive reviews on Amazon and on the BBC website, I decided to buy it, although I knew little about the whole story. My God, I never imagined that this BBC film could be so good! I can't even describe how I felt when I first watched the first episode except that I became completely hooked and I couldn't stop watching until I knew how it ended. And what an end!!! Now I can only say that it has even eclipsed the BBC P&P; film in my heart. Everything is perfect, the cast and the acting, the setting, the photography, the dialogues, the music, the social background. The background definitely adds another interesting layer to the film because you can see both sides, the mill owners' and the workers' and you can see them at their work. All the characters are marvellous and so likeable. They really make a difference because they have a lot of depth and there is always a certain dignity about them.We can thank Elizabeth Gaskell for creating such wonderful characters, yet they wouldn't make such an impression in the film if the actors weren't so great. They really got into their parts. Sinead Cusack is a magnificent Mrs Thornton, this iron lady who does her best to control her emotions but then you look through her eyes and realize that she is not as cold or hard as she seems, especially when you take full measure of the depth of her love for her son. What a fantastic mother she is! And what about Brandon Coyle/ Higgins, I mean, I've just talked about the dignity of the characters, here is a fine example, you just have to look at the face of this union leader to know that he is at heart a good man, even though he is a bit ruthless sometimes. Jo Joyner as John's sister is a delight, probably the only source of comic relief in the story. But the whole cast is great! And of course, the film wouldn't be so captivating if there wasn't Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage in the parts of Margaret and Mr Thornton. Mr Thornton, oh, God, What a man! I fell in love with this fascinating character. Of course, Richard Armitage is already so charismatic that you can't take your eyes off him. But the man is so dedicated to his work, -contrary to Darcy, he has known poverty and he has had to fight back-that you feel an admiration for him! Out of nothing but using his wits, he has been able to run a fine business and when we first meet him, he is a well-off and powerful mill owner. His position in society makes him arrogant and brutal, yet, he remains fair with his workers and, thanks to Margaret, he becomes more aware of the living conditions of the working class and even becomes a caring master. He has such a strength or resilience; yet, at the same time, his love for Margaret makes him vulnerable. Oh, the way he looks at her! (sigh)It is incredible what the two actors can produce on screen. In the proposal scene, the interaction between them is so intense. There is so much passion on their faces and in the way they respond to each other that it is breathtaking. I was really shaking inside. -I always feel a bit frustrated by the BBC P&P;, although the actors are excellent, because the film sticks too much to the book. And I wish that we could see more touching of hands or more signs of passion between Firth and Ehle.- Thankfully here, the film, North &South;, is not completely faithful to the book especially concerning the dialogues and so they have more impact in the film. The ending scene, in particular is so beautiful that it brings tears to my eyes. Is it due to R. Armitage's magnetism on screen or to the tenderness that is palpable between them when they talk or when they look at each other or to the way they touch each other's hands with the enchanting music behind? I can't tell. I don't think any words can really describe how I feel about this film so I will just stop there and let you enjoy the film for yourself. The DVD is also worth the money because it includes an interview with Armitage and commentaries.",5,Simply captivating and Richard Armitage's acting is fantastic!,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,4636,"['BBC', 'film', 'pure', 'jewel', 'reviewers', 'Amazon', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'TV', 'French', 'TV', 'seldom', 'broadcast', 'British', 'films', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'North', 'South', 'luckily', 'have', 'strong', 'liking', 'everything', 'English', 'cinema', 'literature', 'theatre', 'music', 'am', 'always', 'deeply', 'interested', 'what', 'British', 'TV', 'can', 'produce', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'BBC', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'also', 'read', 'book', 'like', '-even', 'preference', 'new', '2005', 'movie', 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'am', 'even', 'familiar', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'work', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Mary', 'Barton', ""'ve"", 'started', 'reading', 'North', 'South', 'So', 'reading', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'BBC', 'website', 'decided', 'buy', 'knew', 'little', 'whole', 'story', 'My', 'God', 'never', 'imagined', 'BBC', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'describe', 'how', 'felt', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'became', 'completely', 'hooked', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'knew', 'how', 'ended', 'what', 'end', 'Now', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'even', 'eclipsed', 'BBC', 'P', 'P', 'film', 'heart', 'Everything', 'perfect', 'cast', 'acting', 'setting', 'photography', 'dialogues', 'music', 'social', 'background', 'background', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'layer', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'sides', 'mill', 'owners', 'workers', 'can', 'see', 'work', 'characters', 'are', 'marvellous', 'so', 'likeable', 'really', 'make', 'difference', 'have', 'lot', 'depth', 'always', 'certain', 'dignity', 'them.We', 'can', 'thank', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'creating', 'such', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'yet', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'such', 'impression', 'film', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'really', 'got', 'parts', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'magnificent', 'Mrs', 'Thornton', 'iron', 'lady', 'who', 'best', 'control', 'emotions', 'then', 'look', 'eyes', 'realize', 'not', 'cold', 'hard', 'especially', 'when', 'take', 'full', 'measure', 'depth', 'love', 'son', 'What', 'fantastic', 'mother', 'what', 'Brandon', 'Coyle/', 'Higgins', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'just', 'talked', 'dignity', 'characters', 'here', 'fine', 'example', 'just', 'have', 'look', 'face', 'union', 'leader', 'know', 'heart', 'good', 'man', 'even', 'bit', 'ruthless', 'sometimes', 'Jo', 'Joyner', 'John', 'sister', 'delight', 'probably', 'only', 'source', 'comic', 'relief', 'story', 'whole', 'cast', 'great', 'course', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'captivating', 'was', ""n't"", 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'parts', 'Margaret', 'Mr', 'Thornton', 'Mr', 'Thornton', 'oh', 'God', 'What', 'man', 'fell', 'love', 'fascinating', 'character', 'course', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'already', 'so', 'charismatic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'man', 'so', 'dedicated', 'work', '-contrary', 'Darcy', 'known', 'poverty', 'had', 'fight', 'back-that', 'feel', 'admiration', 'nothing', 'using', 'wits', 'been', 'able', 'run', 'fine', 'business', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'well-off', 'powerful', 'mill', 'owner', 'position', 'society', 'arrogant', 'brutal', 'yet', 'fair', 'workers', 'thanks', 'Margaret', 'more', 'aware', 'living', 'conditions', 'working', 'class', 'even', 'caring', 'master', 'strength', 'resilience', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'Margaret', 'vulnerable', 'Oh', 'way', 'sigh', 'incredible', 'what', 'two', 'actors', 'can', 'produce', 'screen', 'proposal', 'scene', 'interaction', 'so', 'intense', 'so', 'much', 'passion', 'way', 'respond', 'other', 'breathtaking', 'was', 'really', 'shaking', 'inside', 'always', 'feel', 'bit', 'frustrated', 'BBC', 'P', 'P', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'film', 'sticks', 'too', 'much', 'book', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'touching', 'hands', 'more', 'signs', 'passion', 'Firth', 'Ehle.-', 'Thankfully', 'here', 'film', 'North', 'South', 'not', 'completely', 'faithful', 'book', 'especially', 'concerning', 'dialogues', 'so', 'have', 'more', 'impact', 'film', 'ending', 'scene', 'particular', 'so', 'beautiful', 'tears', 'eyes', 'due', 'R.', 'Armitage', 'magnetism', 'screen', 'tenderness', 'palpable', 'when', 'talk', 'when', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'touch', 'other', 'hands', 'enchanting', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'words', 'can', 'really', 'describe', 'how', 'feel', 'film', 'so', 'will', 'just', 'stop', 'there', 'let', 'enjoy', 'film', 'DVD', 'also', 'worth', 'money', 'interview', 'Armitage', 'commentaries']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

I watched ""North and South"" based on an automated 'if you like this then watch this' feature on a website, and boy, was I wowed by what I saw. This is probably the best BBC miniseries since the mid-90s ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth--if you like that series, go watch this NOW.""North and South"" is a captivating mix of romance and industrial strife. The miniseries is set in Milton an industrial mill town in northern England (played beautifully in the series by Edinburgh, Scotland--if you've ever been there you'll recognize the familiar crags in the cemetery scenes), where the Hale family has moved from their home in Hampshire. Margaret, the Hale daughter, is taken aback by the grit of industry.  She quickly meets Mr. Thornton, a local mill owner. After a good deal of clashing (think Elizabeth and Darcy), a mill strike, and lots of drama, a love develops.I think what makes ""North and South"" so wonderful is that combination of romance and political intrigue.  Margaret does not sit idly or wander around the countryside all the time--rather, she is engaged with the mill workers and the owners, and learns enough to engage in interesting debate about workers rights. It's her intellect that softens Mr. Thornton as much as her looks, and it's wonderful to watch her in action.  The entire cast is superb--I especially love Daniela Denby-Ashe--I hope I see her in something else soon!As I said at the beginning of this review--if you're a P&P; fan, or a Dickens, or Bronte fan, go see this miniseries immediately.

Initially, I didn't know this though - I only knew that I liked the movie and was interested in the  time period.  The movie actually inspired me to read the book (which I found online in both print and audio versions for free).  For those who care to know, Elizabeth Gaskill's novel North and South is quite lengthy.  The writers and director did a good job of condensing this long book into the four episodes.  I much preferred to book's ending to the movie's but that is not unusual for adaptations.To give you a time reference, Gaskill was a contemporary of Charles Dickens.  In North and South, she explores issues like class distinctions and social justice.  I will admit that  the Industrial Revolution has previously been of little interest to me.  This movie-and then the author's books - has piqued my curiosity.If you are a fan of movie adaptations of Jane Austen novels, I believe you will also find North and South worthwhile and enjoyable as well.

883301,A1SL26ZAKYESXH,B0007N1BBC,"Carissa ""web shopper""","[2, 2]","Elizabeth Gaskell is slowly emerging as one of my favorite authors of her era.  She strongly believed that women have specific and definite opinions and that expressing them in the proper venue should be appreciated and valued by all.  However, the reactions that young Miss Margaret Hale receives form those around her shows us just how unequal women were in former times.  Despite the fact that Ms. Hale didn't even recognize how much she admired the strong male lead character and took a long time to discover her real feelings for him, only added to the mystery of the times and the complexity of the female mind.  I love that these 2 had such a hard time connecting with each other thru communication, misjudgements, stereotypical thinking, etc. still there was something so attractive about each of them that made the other never give up hope of something more. Romance, maybe?  Even when they both thought they despised each other, they couldn't even commit to that.  This portrayal of Gaskell's work is so on target as far as the author's creative expression, that I truly see the clash between the sexes at these times as the back drop of all the failures of that era.This is one video I will see over and over as it has so much character textures.

883302,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0007N1BBC,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[4, 4]","I actually know someone who has read all of Elizabeth Gaskell's novels.  Apparently Gaskell was a 19th century social reformer who saw her work more as advancing the causes of the poor working man and the formation of unions for same.  So she may well be turning in her grave if she were to discover the legions of females panting over Richard Armitage, who plays the male lead character, cotton weaving mill factory owner Thornton.  However, Armitage has not provoked this reaction in me with his star turns in VICAR OF DIBLEY or SPOOKS (called MI-5 in the USA).  So Gaskell must have put a very solid love story to sell what otherwise would have been a very hard to sell novel.  To further demonstrate exactly how good this was, I was flat on my back in the hospital recovering from surgery when I watched this on a dvd player.  I loved it despite all the other hospital activity going on around me, including being poked and prodded.As I've previously stated, I don't think the make or break factors in romance works are the heroines.  I think it is the hero. Thus, Armitage's brooding, smoldering performance as Thornton I think will rank with Colin Firth's playing Darcy in ""Pride & Prejudice"".The reason for the title is that the heroine moves from the south of England, which was still quite bucolic, to the much harsher north.  The north is newly industrialized and all the focus is on profits to be made in factories with little thought towards the welfare of the working man.  The heroine is a preacher's daughter and finds most of this treatment inhumane.  She is rather newly poor herself as her father had a falling out over church dogma so has foisted this move upon them.  However, she has a very rich godfather who looks after her and is estate planning with her in mind.  This will lead to some very surprising twists in the tale.The director incorporates many artistic flourishes throughout in the filming.  There is one beautiful scene where the cotton in the mill is floating through the air as if it were snow and for a moment you think it is winter but it is not.  The ending is filmed in summertime at a railroad station where the two leads are on trains going in opposite directions, one north and one south.  They both briefly get off the train and run into one another.  The filming of this sequence is absolutely lovely.  (The reader of the Gaskell novels told me this scene does not exist in the novel.)The key roles, all beautifully acted, are the male and female leads, the mother of the male lead, the father of the female lead and the union organizer who deals with both of the leads.",5,Love Story Extraordinare with One of the Best Endings Ever Filmed Romantically,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,2616,"['actually', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'novels', 'Apparently', 'Gaskell', 'was', '19th', 'century', 'social', 'reformer', 'who', 'saw', 'work', 'more', 'advancing', 'causes', 'poor', 'working', 'man', 'formation', 'unions', 'same', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'turning', 'grave', 'were', 'discover', 'legions', 'females', 'panting', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'who', 'male', 'lead', 'character', 'cotton', 'weaving', 'mill', 'factory', 'owner', 'Thornton', 'However', 'Armitage', 'not', 'provoked', 'reaction', 'star', 'VICAR', 'OF', 'DIBLEY', 'SPOOKS', 'called', 'MI-5', 'USA', 'So', 'Gaskell', 'must', 'have', 'put', 'very', 'solid', 'love', 'story', 'sell', 'what', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'hard', 'sell', 'novel', 'further', 'demonstrate', 'exactly', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'was', 'flat', 'back', 'hospital', 'recovering', 'surgery', 'when', 'watched', 'dvd', 'player', 'loved', 'other', 'hospital', 'activity', 'going', 'including', 'being', 'poked', 'prodded.As', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'stated', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'make', 'break', 'factors', 'romance', 'works', 'are', 'heroines', 'think', 'hero', 'Thus', 'Armitage', 'brooding', 'smoldering', 'performance', 'Thornton', 'think', 'will', 'rank', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'playing', 'Darcy', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '.The', 'reason', 'title', 'heroine', 'south', 'England', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'bucolic', 'much', 'harsher', 'north', 'north', 'newly', 'industrialized', 'focus', 'profits', 'be', 'made', 'factories', 'little', 'thought', 'welfare', 'working', 'man', 'heroine', 'preacher', 'daughter', 'most', 'treatment', 'inhumane', 'rather', 'newly', 'poor', 'father', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'church', 'dogma', 'so', 'foisted', 'move', 'However', 'very', 'rich', 'godfather', 'who', 'estate', 'planning', 'mind', 'will', 'lead', 'very', 'surprising', 'twists', 'tale.The', 'director', 'many', 'artistic', 'flourishes', 'filming', 'one', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'where', 'cotton', 'mill', 'floating', 'air', 'were', 'snow', 'moment', 'think', 'winter', 'not', 'ending', 'filmed', 'summertime', 'railroad', 'station', 'where', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'trains', 'going', 'opposite', 'directions', 'one', 'north', 'one', 'south', 'briefly', 'get', 'off', 'train', 'run', 'one', 'filming', 'sequence', 'absolutely', 'lovely', 'reader', 'Gaskell', 'novels', 'told', 'scene', 'not', 'exist', 'novel', 'key', 'roles', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'are', 'male', 'female', 'leads', 'mother', 'male', 'lead', 'father', 'female', 'lead', 'union', 'organizer', 'who', 'leads']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

I don't normally buy movies on DVD without first seeing them, but I decided to go ahead and do it with this one because I had heard such good reviews about it from people whose opinions I trust very highly, since they have similar tastes.I'm glad I did buy it because this movie was made SO well.  The story is a fairly common one- actually, it is very similar to Pride and Prejudice, with one character very proud for much of the movie, and another being prejudiced against the first, all based on a misunderstanding.  Some scenes even harken back to the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, but this film also stands very firmly on its own two feet.  It is set in the North of England, and everything from the background scenery (with cotton flying through the air surrounding the mills) to the accents of the characters (very easy to make class distinctions) is done wonderfully.The characters also come across very well.  I had never heard of either Richard Armitage or Daniela Denby-Ashe before this production- now I'll be sure to watch for them.  Armitage's portrayal in particular was spectacular.  He gave Mr. Thornton's character so much depth that it really was possible to feel, like Miss Hale, that the man had major flaws, but fall in love with him all the same.I didn't think Daniela did as well a job at portraying Margaret Hale as Richard Armitage did with portraying Mr. Thornton, but she did act pretty well.  And the movie, overall, is superb.  Between the authentic settings, the beautiful music, and the wonderful plot, I fell in love with North & South.

Through most of it it, I wanted to shake Margaret and her parents, very believable passive aggressive characters played brilliantly. They are an interesting vehicle for exploring Milton and the North and the industrial cloth trade. I fell in love with Higgins, Thornton and Bell and the actors that played them.  Armitage plays Thornton with all the burden, authority, and search for joy - he enjoys his job when everything works.  (I think I have a thing for Yorkshire men.) He cuts a dashing figure, but, more, he strikes a strong realistically ethical cord. Sinead Cusack is so strong and plays Mrs. Thornton with so much complexity. She also, in spite of the harshness of the character, is beautiful - harsh beauty, like a lonely yellow flower hidden in a thicket. The chemistry of the cast and the sense of history transports you.  The commentary on Episodes 1 and 4 are very interesting, but don't listen to them until you watch the whole series.  This is an ace production. Watch it and take the time to be entertained and taught.

I can only say I added this DVD to another purchase (which was Pride & Prejudice 2005) because it kept popping up--period drama, BBC...reviews kept saying it wasn't about the Civil War. I could not figure out how North & South BBC could have 5 stars in the majority of the reviews. I mean really!  Didn't watch it for 2 months. Then one night at 10:00 pm I dropped it in the dvd player.  I had no idea it was 4 hours long! Thought I would watch about an hour and a half and watch the rest the next night or when I had time.The first 20 minutes or so I'm thinking why is this so great.  Then, It happened. I was hooked and 3-1/2 hours later, and several rewatches of key scenes I had to tear myself away from the tv to go to bed.I can't tell you how many times I've watched N&S.;  The story draws you in. It is better not to watch clips on the internet, rather get the whole effect, like I did, from beginning to end. At the first viewing I had reservations about some parts and interpretations and it took two or three times watching the full dvd to absorb and think about the story line.  North & South is not just a love story, it has depth, complications, social tension, winding several stories around life during the industrial revolution in the mid 1800s in England. There is so much that goes on in the 4 hours of viewing that one needed the end for closure.  It blew P&P; (all of them) out of the water!

I admit I'm disappointed I didn't give this a chance sooner because it's so wonderful I could have watched it five times by now. Like the other reviewers as I said I passed it by and like those reviewers I'm glad I finally gave it a chance. I had been so disappointed with other period pieces lately that I didn't want to be so again. I was very much the opposite. Mr. Thornton rivals Mr. Darcy from Pride & Prejudice for my affections. The character was so scary at first but as you get to know him from a new point of view you respect and admire him for his determination and honesty. His faults only serve to make him human which makes him all the more wonderful. The chemistry with Margaret was undeniable. Every meeting was charged with an electricity I'd not seen in some time. You can't help but love them both and their follies. As other's have said, if you loved Pride & Prejudice (preferably with Colin Firth) then you will love North & South (2004).

My aunt is a loan-broker. If you, too, would like to risk your job and thousands of dollars because you simply HAVE to know if the gorgeous yet volatile mill-owner ends up with the annoying, straight-laced parson's daughter then by all means buy ""North and South"" today.Based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell (who also wrote ""Wives and Daughters"", dying after 800 pages but just before the end, for which I shall never forgive her) ""North and South"" follows the adventures of the allegedly fiery Margaret Hale as she moves form the sleepy South of England to the fast-moving, soot-covered North. I say ""allegedly fiery"" because she is played by Daniela Denby-Ashe, who is the series' one weak point. It's not that she's bad--she isn't. But she doesn't really display the strong spirit the script demands. She's pretty, alright, but she lacks emotional weight, and in several scenes where Margaret is supposed to be in turmoil Denby-Ashe just looks vacant. Normally a less-than-stellar performance on behalf of the female lead would sink a story, but then most series don't have Richard Armitage playing the male lead. Coming off like Hugh Jackman's older brother, Armitage is fantastic and makes the story truly addictive. His John Thorton is the lower-class Mr. Darcy, and he tempers the mill master's anger with shades of true humanity. My rating stays five stars because of Armitage.Lending fine support are Anna Maxwell Martin (also excellent in the recent ""Bleak House"") as Margaret's lower class friend, Brendan Coyle as a combative union supporter, and some truly gorgeous music and cinematography. For all those Brit-lit geeks out there ""North and South"" is a home-run and not to be missed.

883318,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B0007N1BBC,CoffeeGurl,"[22, 22]","I love period pieces.  There is nothing greater than to be transported into an era that is different from this one.  I am a sucker for historical novels and enjoy imagining the scenery, clothing and characters of those times, but watching them come to life on my television could be just as wonderful.  I bought the BBC DVD called North and South because of all the rave reviews here.  Oh. My. God!  This has got to be one of, if not the best historical mini-series I have ever watched.  It is right up there with Pride and Prejudice and a few Spanish-language historical ""telenovelas"" I've seen over the years.  This is the series adaptation of the classic Elizabeth Gaskell novel (which I read almost ten years ago) about Margaret Hale, the beautiful daughter of a middle-class clergyman and her sudden departure from the southern countryside to the seedy world of factories and tradesmen in the north of England.  Milton is quite a different world from what she is accustomed to, especially when she meets the Thornton family, namely the disarming cotton manufacturer Mr. John Thornton, whom she sees as uncouth and uneducated based on his ill treatment to one of his employees.  When Mr. Thornton becomes one of her father's pupils, feelings ensue between them, but pride and prejudice keep them from getting close.  To his annoyance, Margaret befriends a family of steel workers whose main breadwinner is leading an union that will enable manufacturers to increase their underlings' wagers.  This does not sit well with Thornton, for his business is in trouble...This wonderful Victorian love story set against the backdrop of the industrialized England is one beautiful surprise!  I used the ""pride and prejudice"" thing on purpose because the plot is vaguely similar to the Jane Austen novel.  In fact, there was a particular scene that reminded me a great deal of the proposal/rejection scene in P&P;, only this one is more heartfelt.  Despite the comparisons, North and South is a memorable story in its own right.  Daniela Anby-Ashe is wonderful as the spirited Margaret Hale.  Brendan Coyle was compelling in his portrayal of the sweet-natured and determined union leader Nicholas Higgins, Sinead Cusack was incredible in her role of the proud and protective mother Hannah Thornton, and Jo Joyner does a good job in playing the snobbish and annoying sister Fanny Thornton.  But it is Richard Armitage that took my breath away in his role of Mr. Thornton.  He brought the hero with a tough and brutal exterior but with a heart of gold to life!  He also brings a great deal of sensuality to his character using his beautiful eyes.  Mr. Armitage is not handsome in a conventional way, but his eyes, smoky voice and nuance portrayal of a flawed romantic hero has drawn many female viewers to him, including me. Swoon.  He is right up there with Colin Firth when it comes to adding sex appeal to his acting.  He is a gifted, wonderful actor and I shall look forward to watching something else with him in it in the future.  As for the mini-series, the story is wonderfully woven and executed.  The story doesn't follow the novel through and through though.  Some changes were made and I think Thornton is more complex and in depth here than he was in the book.  The ending is also different from the novel, but I enjoyed this ending because it kept the overall romantic feel of this adaptation.  There are several memorable scenes in this series.  My personal favorite is the one where Thornton says, ""Look back at me.""  (You'll see what I mean when you watch the film.  Sigh.) As for the other aspects of the series, I enjoyed getting a glimpse of the seedy world of Milton and its inhabitants, and the wardrobe and scenery are beautiful!  The cinematography is amazing.  I marvel at the lighting and how it set the mood when they changed from the colorful scenes in the countryside cottage to the dark and gloomy ones in Milton.  The music scores also set the perfect tone for the scenes.  You can tell just how much attention to detail went into the filming process.  I cannot recommend North and South enough.  Hollywood hasn't created something this beautiful in a long time.  It appears that I will have to look to BBC for wonderful acting, gorgeous sets and beautiful stories whenever I'm in the mood for a period piece.  I look forward to watching more novel adaptations like this one.",5,"""I believe I have seen hell, and it's white.

883325,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B0007N1BBC,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[106, 112]","Top Twelve Reasons ""North and South"" is a ten:PRODUCTION VALUES: Historic looms weave again. Lemon-yellow sunlight floods a garden's translucent petals and leaves. Made me cry. Gave me chills.MARTIN PHIPPS' HYPNOTIC SCORE: reminiscent of Gorecki; minimalism that drills past the kapital-K-krap of the last hundred years of pop culture and reaches something as fundamental as the beat of a human heart, the lungs' breath. Honors both one of the most wrenchingly intimate onscreen moments ever and yet also the sweep of the Industrial Revolution.SINEAD CUSACK: breathtaking as a ruthless matriarch; better, even than Nancy Marchand as a Mafia queen in ""The Sopranos.""POSTURE: Never has so much drama been milked out of actors' vertebrae. Helen Hayes' czarina pose in ""Anastasia"" was good, but Sinead Cusack's carriage and Richard Armitage's spinal column earn special Academy Awards.PLOT TWISTS: I did not know where this one was going until the very last moment of the very last scene. Twists pulled me into the issues the plot engages, and made me engage them myself.IT'S COMPLICATED: Leftist academics' pinko-tinged glasses depict the workers as beautiful and bosses as diabolical. But tycoon Andrew Carnegie, who brutalized his workers, was an epic philanthropist; workers scabbed, drank, and beat their kids. N&S; depicts historical complications with its heroic/brutal workers/bosses. All characters are sometimes sympathetic, and sometimes utterly alienating -  just like real life! A complex script works to earn our understanding, and our love, for complex human beings, the service, art, at its best, performs.CHICK FLICK: ""Fight, flight, or fix it"" is a male response. Guy flix: explosions, chases, gadgets. ""Tend and befriend"" is a female response. We restore the world by ministering to its root: human hearts. N&S; presents its heroine and its viewer with misunderstandings she must address; doing so, she matures, and we mature with her. Margaret's blossoming is an integral cog in a shock striking the world even today: the journey from tradition and pastoral beauty to sharp-elbow competition and industrial ugliness. Margaret's flailing culture shock and attempts to find, remain, and cultivate her best self under a rulebook she hasn't yet seen mirrors millions' struggle. Daniela Denby-Ashe limn's Margaret's triumph with honesty and grace. She's not afraid to be unlikeable; she's not even afraid to be noble.MISOGYNY-FREE ZONE: We are so awash in misogyny, often fed by women themselves -  who can forget the blow struck for women's dignity by celebrities who go out without their underthings? -  that N&S; is almost shocking in the respect it shows women. Margaret Hale has a front-row seat to one of the greatest upheavals in human history: industrialization. She takes on its rewards and woes. She makes decisions, engages with the powerful, grows and changes. And she does all this without once trivializing herself, or allowing anyone else to trivialize her. *And* she's accompanied by interesting women and girls, both rich and poor. That, alone, makes N&S; worth more than a hundred critical darlings in which misogyny is an inescapable ingredient.MORALITY. CHRISTIANITY. HOPE. REMEMBER THOSE? Gaskell's book and this adaptation take on really hard challenges: workers v. capitalists, traditional rural life's poverty and its beauty v. laissez-faire capitalism's new opportunities, ugliness and anomie. N&S; could have just exploited the Industrial Revolution as colorful backdrop; it didn't. N&S; attempts to offer solutions and hope, based on fundamental Christian values like non-violence and sharing. Gee, what if the folks who had made the nihilistic downer film ""Syriana,"" about our dependence on petroleum, had tried something similar? When the N&S; boss and his workers sat down to a meal together, I cried cynicism-free tears. But . . . what WERE they eating? It looked like sludge. The redemption in the movie's key kiss is not just about eros, it's also about agape. And that made me cry. (Cried many times.)BRENDAN COYLE AS NICHOLAS HIGGINS: Let's import Higgins, making sure he keeps that snazzy, puffy-sleeved shirt that displays his chest hair. He'd be a greater boost to the trade union movement than locating Jimmy Hoffa.NOT A SINGLE WASTED CHARACTER, PERFORMANCE, OR SCENE: A bereaved husband converses with his late wife, as a maid looks on, her facial expression speaking volumes. A desperate man gazes at running water dyed purple. The most amazing scene of all, every bit as stunning as the famous crane shot in GWTW: a woman, her straw hat and bumpkin gait rendering her an agrarian silhouette in an industrial landscape, drawn by a seductive, menacing, thrum, walks up to a large wooden door, pulls it back, and steps into the Industrial Revolution. ""I have seen hell, and it is white, snow white."" Mebbe so. But that scene is cinematic heaven-on-earth.RICHARD ARMITAGE: I don't even want to go there. Let's just say that I've just purchased the latest ticket to his crowded harem of adoring fans, and this: even if I had watched N&S; with the sound turned off; Armitage's performance was so exquisitely articulate I could have transcribed pages of dialogue and backstory just from studying his face. But if I watched with the sound turned off, I would have missed the most arresting screen voice since Orson Welles, and the dreamiest since Ronald Coleman . . . Ladies, cave.

The depiction of the milltown, the miserable lives of the mill workers, the union stirrings and the general labor unrest of the time was very well presented, as was, of course, the basic human drama. Everyone in the cast was superb, especially Sinead Cusack as the millowner's hard/soft mother, Brendan Coyle (why don't they use him more?)as the union leader, and the two leads.In this regard, I have to say that Richard Armitage was a revelation as the sexy, brooding and semi-tough millowner .

In the book, much of Margaret's dislike of Thornton hinges on his being in trade rather than a gentleman, which just made her seem like a snob to me. The dramatic fight scene created a real tension and reason for her antipathy. I was glad to have one less death, and the way other information was doled out made much more dramatic sense, too.

883341,A15BHDNAUEBEKP,B0007N1BBC,Evelina,"[7, 7]","Richard Armitage makes this series. He is  the perfect choice for the character who, in the book, is forceful, masterful, hard, and capable of great love for one woman. He is also a loving son and a kind brother.I felt that many people could have played Margaret Hale, and was not too enamored of the actress. She did an okay job acting wise but the character she portrayed to those who read the book is not up to par.  In the book, Margaret, eighteen or nineteen, is often described as queenly, noble, dignified, restrained; she is the softened female version of the masterful Thornton.  You can see her in her middle age becoming like his mother, loving and tough (of course, not as tough as he is). I don't see those qualities in this actress. But it's not a terrible choice. It works. The actress does have the large expressive eyes that Gaskell refers to, and the beautiful mouth.I was not quite sure why she refused his proposal.  The series did not make it clear enough. The book, of which I have read about half, makes it plain. After she showed her love for him in front of all the world by throwing her arms around him to protect him from the mob, she was ashamed and embarrassed. For those times, that was forward and un-maidenly conduct. So when he came to propose, she felt that he was presuming. She wanted to show him she was not so easily gotten. That's not how she puts it to herself, because she does love him. Her conscious rationale is that she does not love him and that she would have thrown her arms around anyone.Armitage is perfection, as he stalks about frowning. When we and Margaret first meet John Thornton, he is beating the you know what out of some worker. That is not in the book, but it is a master stroke by the series' producers. At one point in the series, Margaret is feeling that Milton is ""hell"" and then we see John, as if there is a link between him and that place. Thornton, in the series, continually has an air of suppressed violence and restrained passion. Seems like he could do anything at any moment - but he won't. And therein lies the secret of the attraction of the alpha male in fiction. Edward could drink Bella's blood, but he won't. What we want is restrained violence. Why such a character is so devastatingly attractive even in this feminist age (and the more liberated we become, the more the fictional male becomes like that, it's the secret to the success of British historical dramas), I will leave to psychologists to explain.",5,"okay, about that John Thornton",1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,2489,"['Richard', 'Armitage', 'series', 'perfect', 'choice', 'character', 'who', 'book', 'forceful', 'masterful', 'hard', 'capable', 'great', 'love', 'one', 'woman', 'also', 'loving', 'son', 'kind', 'brother.I', 'felt', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'enamored', 'actress', 'did', 'okay', 'job', 'acting', 'wise', 'character', 'portrayed', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'book', 'Margaret', 'eighteen', 'nineteen', 'often', 'described', 'queenly', 'noble', 'dignified', 'restrained', 'softened', 'female', 'version', 'masterful', 'Thornton', 'can', 'see', 'middle', 'age', 'becoming', 'mother', 'loving', 'tough', 'course', 'not', 'as', 'tough', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'qualities', 'actress', 'not', 'terrible', 'choice', 'actress', 'have', 'large', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'Gaskell', 'refers', 'beautiful', 'mouth.I', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'refused', 'proposal', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'clear', 'enough', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'half', 'plain', 'showed', 'love', 'front', 'world', 'throwing', 'arms', 'protect', 'mob', 'was', 'ashamed', 'embarrassed', 'times', 'was', 'forward', 'un-maidenly', 'conduct', 'So', 'when', 'came', 'propose', 'felt', 'was', 'presuming', 'wanted', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'gotten', 'not', 'how', 'herself', 'love', 'conscious', 'rationale', 'not', 'love', 'would', 'have', 'thrown', 'arms', 'anyone.Armitage', 'perfection', 'frowning', 'When', 'Margaret', 'first', 'John', 'Thornton', 'beating', 'know', 'what', 'worker', 'not', 'book', 'master', 'stroke', 'series', 'producers', 'one', 'point', 'series', 'Margaret', 'feeling', 'Milton', 'hell', 'then', 'see', 'John', 'link', 'place', 'Thornton', 'series', 'continually', 'air', 'suppressed', 'violence', 'restrained', 'passion', 'could', 'do', 'anything', 'moment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'therein', 'secret', 'attraction', 'alpha', 'male', 'fiction', 'Edward', 'could', 'drink', 'Bella', 'blood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'What', 'want', 'restrained', 'violence', 'Why', 'such', 'character', 'so', 'devastatingly', 'attractive', 'even', 'feminist', 'age', 'more', 'liberated', 'become', 'more', 'fictional', 'male', 'becomes', 'secret', 'success', 'British', 'historical', 'dramas', 'will', 'leave', 'psychologists', 'explain']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

It too, for me, is one of the best (if not the best) BBC miniseries that I've ever seen and I have seen many.  What I love the most about this series is that it shows the ""class struggle"" at all levels whether it is social status, geographical status (from what area a person is from or what local they might inhabit) employment level status (worker, employer) etc.-(I'm still of the strong opinion that it still DOES matter no matter where one might live) Anyway, this presentation does a wonderful job of showing the class differences in England mid-1800.  The acting is simply superb by a huge cast; however, I must single out a few of my favorites.Richard Aarmitage plays the moody mill owning Thornton.-what a wonderful character very much like Mr. Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice"". He's a dark, brooding, handsome and seemingly not too nice man; however, in actuality he is a very good man.  Aarmitage turns in a fantastic performance on the level of Colin Firth (as Mr. Darcy) in Pride and Prejudice.  Daniela Denby-Ashe, as Margaret the heroine of the story and Thornton's love interest, is marvelous as one of those very strong ""Jane Austin type of women""  Thornton's haughty but basically good mother is played wonderfully by Sinead Cusack.  I also love Tim Piggot-Smith (in more of a subdued role for him) as Mr. Hale, Margaret's father.  To be honest all of the actors are great in this presentation.This miniseries exhibits great direction along with a great script.  The recreation of the era and local is marvelous.  I love the cotton mill scenes with the machines roaring and cotton dust flying all over the place-fabulous.

883350,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0007N1BBC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[8, 8]","So I popped NORTH & SOUTH into my DVD player, and imagine my surprise when scenes of the American Civil War failed to appear on the screen. This is instead the BBC adaptation of the classic novel by 19th century author Elizabeth Gaskell. And while there are no Johnny Rebs or Patrick Swayzes lurking about, there is a union. There is even a skirmish of sorts engaged between calculating factory owners and despairing laborers on strike. Nothing about any of that would lead you to believe that this is one of them timeless romances over which girls tend to swoon. But I haven't yet mentioned Margaret Hale, brought to life vividly by a marvelous actress named Daniela Denby-Ashe.Temporarily put aside the love story, and the central theme would revolve around the bridging of the social divide in the Victorian era. Margaret Hale, our young heroine, finds it difficult to adapt to her unfamiliar new environs. Torn from her priveleged life in bucolic southern England, she eyes the booming industrial northern town of Milton and sees much that disgusts her: the squalor, the furor, the common folk's open hostility, that air of desperation. Absorbing her particular scorn is sullen local mill owner John Thornton (Richard Armitage) whose abusive treatment of an employee instantly prejudices Margaret against him. Imagine her distaste when she learns that John Thornton is her minister father's new pupil in the Classics. Right about now, you're perhaps sensing echoes of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE. And there is a parallel to how the romance in both novels plays out. Except that NORTH & SOUTH commands even more of an investment into the story. PRIDE & PREJUDICE is fraught with wit and lightheartedness. NORTH & SOUTH is bleaker and more somber and offers deeper insight into the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of its time and place. Side characters such as Thornton's stern Yorkshire-accented mother (Sin&eacute;ad Cusack) and Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle), the passionate union leader, are crucial to plot development.Period dramas aren't normally in my wheel house. To me, a Bront is a kind of dinosaur and a Hawthorne is a cancelled show on TNT. But I think Jane Austen crosses all barriers, and I find her more accessible than Dickens. Somewhere in the ether, Elizabeth Gaskell may resent hearing this, but if not for Jane Austen, I wouldn't even come near a Gaskell adaptation. The BBC teleplay, told in four episodes, somehow draws me into its tale of labor strikes and factory closures, elements which in any other story would render me not giving an ef. But the union stuff works because it serves as a backdrop to Margaret and Thornton's tempestuous yet understated romance. Class distinction is pretty much the crux of the conflict between the two central characters. That, and a misunderstanding involving Margaret's fugitive brother.Margaret is someone who doesn't bow down to conventions. An outsider to Milton, she doesn't hesitate to befriend those beneath her social status. Her ties to both the ruling and working classes lend her a unique perspective. Her outspoken nature incenses Thornton. But it also intrigues him. Thornton's mother isn't so conflicted. She straight up loathes Margaret.One step forward. Two steps back. That sums up Margaret and Thornton's relationship. Daniela Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage strike a spark and keep it lit. Denby-Ashe breathes life into Margaret, a modern girl trapped in a Victorian era corset, a restricting happenstance she shares with the equally independent Miss Elizabeth Bennett. Margaret doesn't shy away from speaking her own mind. As Denby-Ashe comments in the DVD's production notes, Margaret boldly looks people in the eye when she converses with them, an act which women in those days generally tend to not do. Meanwhile, Richard Armitage's superpower must be scowling. He lends a brooding intensity to his character, and first impressions would dictate that his character must be a tyrannical master who subjects his worker to abuse. Except that each progressive episode peels away another layer of his character, reveals his sensitivity and innate decency and awful loneliness. The moments in episode 4 in which Thornton shares the dinner table with Mr. Higgins and his other employees are understated but pretty moving. NORTH & SOUTH runs for four hours, not that you feel the length. I haven't read the book, but I venture to say that this is one of the finest adaptations ever put to screen. The production values are convincing and immersive. The screenplay is absorbing. The acting is stellar. In a bloody face-off between these two NORTH & SOUTH mini-series, Patrick Swayze just wilted under one of Richard Armitage's unconvivial scowls.Special features: audio commentary on episodes 1 & 4 with producer Kate Bartlett, director Brian Percival and screenplay writer Sandy Welch; an interview with Richard Armitage (00:11:30 minutes long); 5 Deleted Scenes, including an extended proposal scene (00:11:38 minutes long); cast biographies with an in-depth look into the actors' roles in NORTH & SOUTH; and production notes.",5,"""Everywhere there is conflict and unkindness.

883356,A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK,B0007N1BBC,Irishgal,"[1, 1]","When it comes to period dramas and classic literature, I always read the book before watching the movie. While some, especially the BBC, do a good job of bringing literary classics to the screen, I've found that the book is usually better. However, that is not the case with &#34;North and South&#34;. This time, the BBC wins over author Elizabeth Gaskell in what is the &#34;best&#34; version of this story.&#34;North and South&#34;, originally published in 1854-55, is a type of Dickensian take on Jane Austen's &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; crossed with the industrial revolution. After her clergyman father's crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and her parents move from Helstone, an idyllic village in Hampshire, to the northern town of Milton, where they live among cotton manufacturers and their workers. This new world is so different from the old one that the family is initially unsure where to begin, and Margaret, so well-adjusted to life in the South, struggles to find her place in this culture that seems so strange.One of her father's pupils is John Thornton (Richard Armitage), the owner of Marlborough Mills, and a well-respected master in the town. Thornton and Margaret do not exactly hit it off; she is repulsed by his behavior towards his workers, while he is perplexed by her arrogance and lack of knowledge of how things are done in Milton. However, the more the two are thrown together, the more they begin to understand each other. When a strike hits the town, Margaret is torn between the two sides - understanding both Thornton's point-of-view and that of his workers, particularly union leader Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle).What makes this movie work in a way the book didn't is its pace. Granted, at four hours, it is long (though shorter than some BBC adaptations). However, it cuts out many of the false starts of the novel and, because it is a visual medium, can show in a glance what took Gaskell multiple pages to describe. Is the film an exact replica of the novel? No, it isn't, but the changes work in enhancing the storyline rather than detracting from it. Overall, the casting is fantastic - there is little doubt that the two leads play well off each other, and with other major roles being well-cast (especially Sinead Cusack as Hannah Thornton), it comes together.My only real issues are minor; first, the casting of Brendan Coyle is something I find questionable given how the character was described in the book, though if you haven't read the work you probably won't notice. The other blemish is the lack of production value. When &#34;North and South&#34; hit television screens in November 2004, it wasn't highly-publicized and was regarded by the BBC as a rather low-budget production. Therefore, when watching, it becomes obvious that less care was taken with this than with other adaptations done by the network. This, however, is not the fault of the series but rather the BBC, and it still stands the test of time.Here in the US, &#34;North and South&#34; is overlooked, both as a novel and as a period piece. However, in the UK, it is regarded as one of the greatest costume dramas of the decade, and if you are in the mood for something well-acted, well-written, and making a big improvement on its source of inspiration, look no further.",5,Better Than the Book,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,3317,"['When', 'period', 'dramas', 'classic', 'literature', 'always', 'read', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', 'especially', 'BBC', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'literary', 'classics', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'found', 'book', 'usually', 'better', 'However', 'not', 'case', '34', 'North', 'South', '34', 'time', 'BBC', 'author', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'what', '34', 'best', '34', 'version', 'story.', '34', 'North', 'South', '34', 'originally', 'published', '1854-55', 'type', 'Dickensian', 'take', 'Jane', 'Austen', '34', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '34', 'crossed', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'clergyman', 'father', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'parents', 'move', 'Helstone', 'idyllic', 'village', 'Hampshire', 'northern', 'town', 'Milton', 'where', 'live', 'cotton', 'manufacturers', 'workers', 'new', 'world', 'so', 'different', 'old', 'one', 'family', 'initially', 'unsure', 'where', 'begin', 'Margaret', 'so', 'well-adjusted', 'life', 'South', 'find', 'place', 'culture', 'so', 'strange.One', 'father', 'pupils', 'John', 'Thornton', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'owner', 'Marlborough', 'Mills', 'well-respected', 'master', 'town', 'Thornton', 'Margaret', 'do', 'not', 'exactly', 'hit', 'off', 'repulsed', 'behavior', 'workers', 'perplexed', 'arrogance', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'Milton', 'However', 'more', 'two', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'more', 'begin', 'understand', 'other', 'When', 'strike', 'town', 'Margaret', 'torn', 'two', 'sides', 'understanding', 'Thornton', 'point-of-view', 'workers', 'particularly', 'union', 'leader', 'Nicholas', 'Higgins', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'movie', 'work', 'way', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'pace', 'Granted', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'shorter', 'BBC', 'adaptations', 'However', 'out', 'many', 'false', 'starts', 'novel', 'visual', 'medium', 'can', 'show', 'glance', 'what', 'took', 'Gaskell', 'multiple', 'pages', 'describe', 'film', 'exact', 'replica', 'novel', 'No', ""n't"", 'changes', 'work', 'enhancing', 'storyline', 'rather', 'detracting', 'Overall', 'casting', 'fantastic', 'little', 'doubt', 'two', 'leads', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'other', 'major', 'roles', 'being', 'well-cast', 'especially', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'Hannah', 'Thornton', 'together.My', 'only', 'real', 'issues', 'are', 'minor', 'first', 'casting', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'something', 'find', 'questionable', 'given', 'how', 'character', 'was', 'described', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'work', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'other', 'blemish', 'lack', 'production', 'value', 'When', '34', 'North', 'South', '34', 'hit', 'television', 'screens', 'November', '2004', 'was', ""n't"", 'highly-publicized', 'was', 'regarded', 'BBC', 'rather', 'low-budget', 'production', 'Therefore', 'when', 'watching', 'obvious', 'less', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'other', 'adaptations', 'done', 'network', 'however', 'not', 'fault', 'series', 'rather', 'BBC', 'still', 'test', 'time.Here', 'US', '34', 'North', 'South', '34', 'overlooked', 'novel', 'period', 'piece', 'However', 'UK', 'regarded', 'one', 'greatest', 'costume', 'dramas', 'decade', 'are', 'mood', 'something', 'well-acted', 'well-written', 'making', 'big', 'improvement', 'source', 'inspiration', 'look', 'further']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

883360,A17JVI15BRY90P,B0007N1BBC,James T. Wheeler,"[12, 12]","Thanks to all who wrote in to Amazon.com about this outstanding series.  We would never have heard of it otherwise.  My wife and I have been enjoying dramas like this for over 30 years on Masterpiece Theatre.  Now, we see where they've gone.Since the show runs 4 hours and is rather dark much of the time, it wouldn't make fun viewing on a rainy day.  Nevertheless, if you have the time and energy, this miniseries will reward you with a memorable experience.With the problems we have today a lot of people get depressed and angry.  Still, once you see a show like this you can be glad you didn't have the problems they had back in the 1850's when this story took place.  Grim working conditions, worse living conditions, disease, intolerance, and more.  There was no ""safety net"" for anyone.Despite all their problems, the characters in this drama show the type of courage and resiliency that give one hope for the future.  Amid the gloom and strain of everyday existence, the characters look for wisdom and understanding, and of course, love.  There are some similarities with the themes in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" as others have said.  But there's little of the sardonic humor you'll find in a Jane Austen piece.  This production shows mostly hard scrabble poverty and tough manual labor, but the happy ending makes it all worthwhile.  If anyone wondered where unions came from, to fight for decent wages and working conditions, look no further.Because dialogue can be hard to follow in places, viewers might want to switch on Subtitles.  Northern British accents are not what most of us are used to and their idioms and words can be difficult to follow.

883366,A106016KSI0YQ,B0007N1BBC,Jay Dickson,"[5, 5]","There could be no better imaginable adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel than this 2004 mini-series. Sandy Welch, who is the best of all BBC adaptors of great Victorian novels (despite the claims made for Andrew Davies), kept exactly to the spirit of Gaskell's great love story that explored the rise of the Northern manufacturing centers in the North of England and the shift of might in the country from the milder agrarian South. Intriguingly, Welch actually cut quite a bit from the novel's early chapters that explain in greater depth how Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) was transplanted with her family to the Northern city of Milton (meant to be a stand-in for Manchester) when her father (Tim Piggot-Smith), a mild-mannered reverend in the Southern counties, has a crisis of conscience and leaves his congregation. In Milton the Rev. Hale becomes the tutor to a wealthy self-made mill owner, the Byronic John Thornton (Richard Armitage), who falls for Margaret despite the disapproval of his steely mother (Sinead Cusack). But Margaret fears Thornton despises her for her family's loss of fortune, and Thornton worries that Margaret holds his trade in contempt...Really, Gaskell's story has much in common with PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, although it has none of the humor but much more of a richer sociohistorical texture to it. Very wisely Welch emphasized the Austenian aspect of the love story while also adding some wonderful scenes of the inside of the Thornton factory, Marlborough Mills, which are presented stunningly (in an actual old textile mill with the original machines) as saturated with the choking fluff of cotton in the air. The cast is terrific, with Denby-Ashe, Piggott-Smith, and the finely nuanced Lesley Mandeville as the Hale family, although the greatest standouts are Cusack as the flinty Mrs. Thornton and the dashing Armitage as her proud son. (The popularity of this miniseries, which caught BBC executives by surprise, was attributed to Armitage making the same sort of splash in his role that Colin Firth did a decade earlier as Mr. Darcy; in a winning interview extra of the DVD set Richard Armitage notes that the comparison has been made and is charmingly humbled by it, and by the greatness of his role.)

Her father refuses to sign the bishop's declaration of conformity with the Common Book of Prayer, thus making him a dissenter. As a result, he loses his position in the church and moves the family lock, stock and barrel to Milton, far enough away, he thinks, to make his disgrace a secret. There, they live on his wife's meager income while he ineffectively tries to make money giving ""lectures"" and taking private pupils. In this booming industrial town, an Oxford education is a rarity. One of his pupils is Mr. Thornton, owner of a thriving cotton mill. Mr. Thorton is a self-made man, intelligent but not educated.The daughter, Margaret, is first repulsed, then attracted to Mr. Thornton (very like Pride & Prejudice.) A series of reversals and sudden deaths changes the fortune of both Margaret and Thornton.The problem with Gaskell's writing is that it is less skillful than Bronte or even Dickens. She has a good eye for the milieu but uses a broad brush and her novelistic machinations are rather jarringly unlikely--or handled less skillfully than the same ""unlikely"" occurrences would be by Bronte or Dickens. But the drama makes for a good miniseries, and the script is quite faithful to the book, except the initial chapters where Mr. Hale pretty much destroys his family is played down a lot. This is in my opinion Mrs Gaskell's best novel and it was a good read--and it makes a good dramatic series. However, Wives and Daughters, a weaker book, made for a better series, in my opinion.",4,Good interpretation of this Victorian Industrial Age novel,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,1648,"['Mrs', 'Gaskell', 'novel', 'deals', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'rural', 'Helstone', 'south', 'England', 'Milton', 'gritty', 'industrial', 'town', 'north', 'father', 'sign', 'bishop', 'declaration', 'conformity', 'Common', 'Book', 'Prayer', 'thus', 'making', 'dissenter', 'result', 'position', 'church', 'family', 'lock', 'stock', 'barrel', 'Milton', 'far', 'enough', 'away', 'make', 'disgrace', 'secret', 'live', 'wife', 'meager', 'income', 'ineffectively', 'make', 'money', 'giving', 'lectures', 'taking', 'private', 'pupils', 'booming', 'industrial', 'town', 'Oxford', 'education', 'rarity', 'One', 'pupils', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'owner', 'thriving', 'cotton', 'mill', 'Mr.', 'Thorton', 'self-made', 'man', 'intelligent', 'not', 'educated.The', 'daughter', 'Margaret', 'first', 'repulsed', 'then', 'attracted', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'very', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'series', 'reversals', 'sudden', 'deaths', 'fortune', 'Margaret', 'Thornton.The', 'problem', 'Gaskell', 'writing', 'less', 'skillful', 'Bronte', 'even', 'Dickens', 'good', 'eye', 'milieu', 'broad', 'brush', 'novelistic', 'machinations', 'are', 'rather', 'jarringly', 'unlikely', 'handled', 'less', 'skillfully', 'same', 'unlikely', 'occurrences', 'would', 'be', 'Bronte', 'Dickens', 'drama', 'good', 'miniseries', 'script', 'quite', 'faithful', 'book', 'initial', 'chapters', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Hale', 'pretty', 'much', 'family', 'played', 'down', 'lot', 'opinion', 'Mrs', 'Gaskell', 'best', 'novel', 'was', 'good', 'read', 'good', 'dramatic', 'series', 'However', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'weaker', 'book', 'made', 'better', 'series', 'opinion']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

Northern-born Gaskell must have been wicked smart, as she worked for Charles Dickens and was the first to rework Pride & Prejudice! Gaskell cleverly reverses Darcy and Elizabeth's characters, Mrs. Thornton acts as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Thornton's sister Fanny substitutes for all the Bennett sisters, and the industrialized north is as desirable or even more so than Ms. Austen's beloved pastoral southern England.Her protagonist is Margaret Hale (Danilea  Denby-Ashe) an educated, refined, virtuous young woman from the ""unmercantiled"" South who is thrust into the ugliness and conflicts of Milton, an fictionalized industrialized Northern city (meant to be Manchester). Our heroine is transformed by her life in a Northern town, both as an individual and as a woman.  The backstory of the Industrial Age, English textile mills, speculative ventures, unions and labor/management relations illuminates that era very well.The four-disc series displays all the BBC hallmarks: uniformly good cast, thoughtful locations, authentic costumes and great set design. However, the cinematography has a more modern feel than many of the period dramas. The authentic mill interior with the white cotton floating through the air is stunning, especially with our dark haired hero striding through it like a Northern snow storm.Richard Armitage is mesmerizing as John Thornton, with his lethal combination of piercing blue eyes, soft voice and explosive temperament. RA can convey more in a glance than most actors can in a fifteen minute exposition and his subtle use of his hands and mouth subtly convey inner emotions in this break-out role. Supporting cast members Tim Pigott-Smith (The Jewel in the Crown) and Sinead Cusack (Eastern Promises [Blu-ray]) are right up there with him every step of the way. The scenes between Armitage and Cusack are just amazing as they possess a familial resemble in coloring and the tenderness and pride between mother and son is palpable and deeply affecting.N&S; relies on the same general plot as Pride & Prejudice so in the second half of story-Margaret spurns Thornton's marriage proposal but then is compelled by his moral character/actions to reconsider. Thornton always acts honorably but has a quick temper and an inferiority complex. When he is brought low by circumstances beyond his control, he reacts by becoming more humane and compassionate which works to his advantage on many levels. This is a keeper, just go ahead and buy it and place it on the shelf next to BBC Pride and Prejudice so you can watch it at any time.",4,A girl could really cotton to John Thornton,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,2839,"['Richard', 'Armitage', 'Guy', 'Gisborne', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Seasons', '1-2', 'really', 'wowed', 'thought', 'should', 'watch', 'North', 'South', 'BBC', 'adaptation', '1855', 'book', 'British', 'author', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'Collection', 'Wives', 'Daughters', '/', 'Cranford', '/', 'North', 'South', 'Northern-born', 'Gaskell', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'wicked', 'smart', 'worked', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'was', 'first', 'rework', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Gaskell', 'cleverly', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'characters', 'Mrs.', 'Thornton', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'Thornton', 'sister', 'Fanny', 'Bennett', 'sisters', 'industrialized', 'north', 'desirable', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Ms.', 'Austen', 'beloved', 'pastoral', 'southern', 'England.Her', 'protagonist', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'Danilea', 'Denby-Ashe', 'educated', 'refined', 'virtuous', 'young', 'woman', 'unmercantiled', 'South', 'who', 'thrust', 'ugliness', 'conflicts', 'Milton', 'fictionalized', 'industrialized', 'Northern', 'city', 'meant', 'be', 'Manchester', 'heroine', 'transformed', 'life', 'Northern', 'town', 'individual', 'woman', 'backstory', 'Industrial', 'Age', 'English', 'textile', 'mills', 'speculative', 'ventures', 'unions', 'labor/management', 'relations', 'era', 'very', 'well.The', 'four-disc', 'series', 'displays', 'BBC', 'hallmarks', 'uniformly', 'good', 'cast', 'thoughtful', 'locations', 'authentic', 'costumes', 'great', 'set', 'design', 'However', 'cinematography', 'more', 'modern', 'feel', 'many', 'period', 'dramas', 'authentic', 'mill', 'interior', 'white', 'cotton', 'floating', 'air', 'stunning', 'especially', 'dark', 'haired', 'hero', 'striding', 'Northern', 'snow', 'storm.Richard', 'Armitage', 'mesmerizing', 'John', 'Thornton', 'lethal', 'combination', 'piercing', 'blue', 'eyes', 'soft', 'voice', 'explosive', 'temperament', 'RA', 'can', 'convey', 'more', 'glance', 'most', 'actors', 'can', 'fifteen', 'minute', 'exposition', 'subtle', 'use', 'hands', 'mouth', 'subtly', 'convey', 'inner', 'emotions', 'break-out', 'role', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'Tim', 'Pigott-Smith', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'Eastern', 'Promises', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'step', 'way', 'scenes', 'Armitage', 'Cusack', 'are', 'just', 'amazing', 'possess', 'familial', 'resemble', 'coloring', 'tenderness', 'pride', 'mother', 'son', 'palpable', 'deeply', 'affecting.N', 'S', 'relies', 'same', 'general', 'plot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'so', 'second', 'half', 'story-Margaret', 'spurns', 'Thornton', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'then', 'compelled', 'moral', 'character/actions', 'reconsider', 'Thornton', 'always', 'honorably', 'quick', 'temper', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'When', 'brought', 'low', 'circumstances', 'control', 'becoming', 'more', 'humane', 'compassionate', 'advantage', 'many', 'levels', 'keeper', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'place', 'shelf', 'next', 'BBC', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'can', 'watch', 'time']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

""Words-at-war""","[2, 2]","The 4-part film adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, North & South, is like Pride & Prejudice meets Hard Times and done almost effortlessly. In the same tradition of Jane Austen and the Bronte Sisters come John Thornton and Margaret Hale. Two different people from two different worlds who collide in industrial 1850s Milton, Manchester, England in the gritty, fast paced north versus Margaret's slower, insulated and utopian way of life in the south. Where first impressions are lasting but not forever.John (brilliantly, wonderfully, acted by Richard Armitage) has come up from the dregs to build his cotton business in Milton but at the cost of being purely business minded and nothing else. He knows nothing else and because of it, is hard and harsh but bluntly honest and is as he appears. There is no artifice, no ego, only a will and his way--and to Margaret, at times unforgivable, especially his brutal treatment of his mill workers, who some she befriends. Margaret, though not rich by any means, is perceived as spoiled and haughty but in reality, she is just a young woman trying to accept her new lot in smog-tinged Milton and trying not to lose herself in the process. As a strike threatens the livelihood of John's business and family, so too does grim strife and struggles hit Margaret. Through interactions that color their understanding of each other, they battle in words and actions, and as a result, begin to truly learn more about each other and who each really is. And that they may have more in common than not.What I loved about this eloquent BBC mini-series is the intoxicating, electric and smoldering tension between the leads, Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe, as well as the supporting cast who lend exegetic information about our leads as well as give depth and richness to the overall story. Armitage is simply sublime in his nuanced rendering of a commanding, driven, secretly terrified but passionate John Thornton. His intense and brooding acting makes John Thornton a class in his own, as most want to compare him or declare him the 'New Mr. Darcy', when he is in fact a fantastic John Thornton. In Denby-Ashe, we have a Margaret who is both spirited, independent, vocal yet naive and just as terrified, but an equal match to John. While Denby-Ashe did a marvelous job, hands down, Armitage is clearly the one everyone will talk about.Now, I have not read the novel (YET) and I prefer to read the book before seeing the adaptation, especially in classic novels though most productions tend to stay more true to the storyline than not. Because of that, reading the novel FIRST tends to enhance the experience of watching the movie because you know the little things that were left out and fill them in yourself as you watch. Also, seeing how actors play these characters, how production meets up to standards and how the director holds up his/her end of the bargain and doing the book justice is fun. The only issue I have with this adaptation is that the subcontext that exists in the book that wasn't present in the film. It seemed, at times, that the director and screen writer were relying more on us the audience to be familiar with the style (i.e. ala Austen) and romantic plot rather than fully showing us the development of their romance. The romance is predictable--that's the whole point. We know how it'll end, that's not the point, the point is how they get there and all the subtle ways they reveal their emotions toward each other. That said, the directing and editing was somewhat abrupt, especially in last two episodes, showing not enough but 'almost there' of their romance. I felt like I'd missed some key moments between John and Margaret that I should have seen, that is, their growing affections toward each other and WHY they begin to relate to each other and what bonds knit them closer to each other. We don't really see that. In some respects,  John's affections were much more clearly conveyed, developed and explained, and shown, than Margaret's, which sort of 'happens' for her in the last forty or so minutes of the fourth episode. The secondary plot about Margaret's brother wasn't neatly woven into the rest of the story and was sort of obvious, and as a result, rendered a bit useless and ineffective.Am I being too picky? Maybe but I still LOVED this movie and it has become one of new favorites and must see/must haves. In terms of the social and industrial changes represented in the novel/film, it was fascinating and was a character in and of itself as well as part of John's personae too. However, I know very little of those times, especially the social aspect, but felt there was enough about it without overpowering the rest of the story. Don't judge this to Pride & Prejudice. North & South deserves its own cult following purely for the fact of a great movie and wonderful actors who brought rich, multi-layered characters to life. It was worth every penny, and the extras, including commentaries and interviews, were a delight. I will now be reading the book, then watching the movie again and seeing it in a whole other light...sigh.",4,Simply...divine. 4.5 Stars.,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,5125,"['4-part', 'film',

She is caught between so many conflicts and struggles more within herself than with others as she lives strives to balance her strong opinions and ideals with characters firmly rooted in the standards of society. This was my first encounter with Sinead Cusack. I was quite impressed with her role as Mrs.Thornton. How stiff and unyielding, yet how kind beneath that tough, protective exterior. Mr. Armitage was as brooding and complex a character as I've seen in ages.

His scenes with Daniela Denby-Ashe never left me in doubt of good chemistry between them as they portrayed Margaret Hale and Mr. Thornton.The production values were excellent, showing the contrast between Margaret's idyllic life in the south to the harsh atmosphere of a northern industrial town. It was highlight by the difference in mannerisms and speech between the characters as well.  It wasn't hard to pick out the class system of the times.  The scenes shot in the cotton mill itself were a good use of how harsh it must have been, relying on the almost automatonical movements of the machines and the contrast of the white of the cotton and the black of their attire.The screenplay was a good adaptation of Gaskell's story, and the use of windows and the train platform at the end was a very good example of how the characters belong in separate worlds until, finally, Margaret and Thornton meet, exiting trains to speak on a middle ground that they had strove to find, but previously failed at.",5,Well Done Drama,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,1363,"['period', 'piece', 'BBC', ""n't"", 'done', 'well', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'Tim', 'Pigot-Smith', 'Mr.', 'Hale', 'gentle', 'sometimes', 'awkward', 'approach', 'dealing', 'wife', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'no-nonsense', 'staunch', 'support', 'son', 'show', 'was', 'stolen', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'performance', 'swung', 'harsh', 'stunningly', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'never', 'left', 'doubt', 'good', 'chemistry', 'portrayed', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'Mr.', 'Thornton.The', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'excellent', 'showing', 'contrast', 'Margaret', 'idyllic', 'life', 'south', 'harsh', 'atmosphere', 'northern', 'industrial', 'town', 'was', 'highlight', 'difference', 'mannerisms', 'speech', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'pick', 'out', 'class', 'system', 'times', 'scenes', 'shot', 'cotton', 'mill', 'were', 'good', 'use', 'how', 'harsh', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'relying', 'almost', 'automatonical', 'movements', 'machines', 'contrast', 'white', 'cotton', 'black', 'attire.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'good', 'adaptation', 'Gaskell', 'story', 'use', 'windows', 'train', 'platform', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'characters', 'belong', 'separate', 'worlds', 'finally', 'Margaret', 'Thornton', 'meet', 'exiting', 'trains', 'speak', 'middle', 'ground', 'had', 'strove', 'find', 'previously', 'failed']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

883407,A26KIF01GEUXBT,B0007N1BBC,Kyle Pratt,"[4, 4]","Set in a gritty north England industrial town this excellent four-hour BBC mini-series adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's 1854 novel is nonetheless an outstanding period romance.Margaret Hale, the protagonist, is forced to move with her parents from an idyllic country parsonage of Helstone to the gritty industrial town of Milton after her father leaves the ministry. There Margaret meets one of the leading men of the city, the mill owner Mr. Thornton.  This first meeting shows the hot tempered side of Thornton and sets up a Pride and Prejudice style misunderstanding.  It is good to remember that this is not a miniseries about the Victorian era; it is a largely faithful adaptation of a Victorian novel.  Elizabeth Gaskell was Victorian and she was writing about Victorians.

Many, many years ago I fell in love with 1996's version of Jane Eyre and thought I would never find a period film that I loved as much. I was wrong. Dead wrong.I'd been putting off watching North & South for a long time but yesterday afternoon I gave in and was glued to my television from the very beginning to the very end.Margaret Hale is a beautiful, head strong, opinionated woman who's family has just been uprooted from the green lushness of the south by her father who's decided to leave the clergy. He takes Margaret and her mother north to a place that could not be more different than Margaret's beloved Helstone. The northern industrial town of Milton is dirty, busy, smoke-filled, rough and the air is constantly full of cotton fluff that comes from the cotton mills. To say that Margaret doesn't like Milton would be a bit of an understatement, and when she meets mill owner John Thornton her opinion of Milton only goes downhill.Okay, let's talk about setting. The setting was almost visceral. Milton made me feel cold, wet and grimy while Helstone left me feeling like I wanted to lay down in some grass and nap in the sun all afternoon. The people of Milton are overworked and hungry. I felt like I was walking the streets of Milton with Margaret. I was thrown back in time and it was all so authentic the way a period film should be.Characters. Richard Armitage who plays the mill owner John Thornton was the standout in this film. His brooding, strong and fair but tortured hero was a performance that everyone should see. The other characters were played excellently as well but Richard Armitage was simply divine.Daniela Denby Ashe as Margaret Hale did stubborn but sympathetic so well. She may be my favorite female character that I've seen in every movie I've yet to see. She had beliefs and compassion. I admired that.The love story. The train scene had me swooning and you'll know what I mean if you've watched the movie. I was rooting for Margaret and John to find their way to each other. I loved, loved, loved John and Margaret and I believed in their passion and love for each other.One thing that I adore about period films is that the little things in the movie mean so much. The fleeting brush of fingers, the secret looks, the way a wealth of feeling can be expressed with one whispered word. North & South does that beautifully. Beautifully.There is so much more that I want to say about this film but I would hate to ruin it for anyone else. So, the only other thing I will say that you should watch it. Forget any doubts you may have and watch it because it is an experience you won't soon forget.",5,I was captivated...,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,2705,"['miniseries', 'oh', 'man', 'Brilliant', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'Many', 'many', 'years', 'fell', 'love', '1996', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'thought', 'would', 'never', 'find', 'period', 'film', 'loved', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'wrong', 'Dead', 'wrong.I', ""'d"", 'been', 'putting', 'off', 'watching', 'North', 'South', 'long', 'time', 'yesterday', 'afternoon', 'gave', 'was', 'glued', 'television', 'very', 'beginning', 'very', 'end.Margaret', 'Hale', 'beautiful', 'head', 'strong', 'opinionated', 'woman', 'who', 'family', 'just', 'been', 'uprooted', 'green', 'lushness', 'south', 'father', 'who', 'decided', 'leave', 'clergy', 'Margaret', 'mother', 'north', 'place', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Margaret', 'beloved', 'Helstone', 'northern', 'industrial', 'town', 'Milton', 'dirty', 'busy', 'smoke-filled', 'rough', 'air', 'constantly', 'full', 'cotton', 'fluff', 'cotton', 'mills', 'say', 'Margaret', ""n't"", 'like', 'Milton', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'understatement', 'when', 'mill', 'owner', 'John', 'Thornton', 'opinion', 'Milton', 'only', 'downhill.Okay', 'let', 'talk', 'setting', 'setting', 'was', 'almost', 'visceral', 'Milton', 'made', 'feel', 'cold', 'wet', 'grimy', 'Helstone', 'left', 'feeling', 'wanted', 'lay', 'down', 'grass', 'nap', 'sun', 'afternoon', 'people', 'Milton', 'are', 'overworked', 'hungry', 'felt', 'was', 'walking', 'streets', 'Milton', 'Margaret', 'was', 'thrown', 'back', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'authentic', 'way', 'period', 'film', 'should', 'be.Characters', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'who', 'mill', 'owner', 'John', 'Thornton', 'was', 'standout', 'film', 'brooding', 'strong', 'fair', 'tortured', 'hero', 'was', 'performance', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'played', 'excellently', 'as', 'well', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'was', 'simply', 'divine.Daniela', 'Denby', 'Ashe', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'did', 'stubborn', 'sympathetic', 'so', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'female', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'had', 'beliefs', 'compassion', 'admired', 'that.The', 'love', 'story', 'train', 'scene', 'had', 'swooning', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'rooting', 'Margaret', 'John', 'find', 'way', 'other', 'loved', 'loved', 'loved', 'John', 'Margaret', 'believed', 'passion', 'love', 'other.One', 'thing', 'adore', 'period', 'films', 'little', 'things', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'fleeting', 'brush', 'fingers', 'secret', 'looks', 'way', 'wealth', 'feeling', 'can', 'be', 'expressed', 'one', 'whispered', 'word', 'North', 'South', 'beautifully', 'Beautifully.There', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'want', 'say', 'film', 'would', 'hate', 'ruin', 'anyone', 'else', 'So', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'should', 'watch', 'Forget', 'doubts', 'may', 'have', 'watch', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

883413,A2HKRNELD7DGX1,B0007N1BBC,Lili_K,"[23, 25]","Although Mrs Gaskell is not my favourite author - it's Jane Austen forever!! - I find her novels quite nice and entertaining. It was some years ago when I read the novel N&S.; I liked it but it did not make a lasting impression. I roughly remebered the storyline and that was all. So knowing the novel in itself wouldn't have moved me to purchace the film, but having read the reviews I felt intrigued - better than Mr Darcy/Firth ??!! - and thought I'll give it a try.So yesterday afternoon I thought I'd watch an episode, maybe two, in-between some ironing and ... I ended up watching the whole series in one and didn't do too much ironing.The 1st episode started like a typical costume drama with a wedding party, gossip and dancing: nice but nothing special really. However, when I got to the scene where Margaret is meeting John Thornton for the first time - a dark angel in the ""white hell"" - I was completely absorbed by the story.Richard Armitage as Mr Thornton intrigued me from the first (actually I remember preferring this character to Margaret Hale's in the book). He is absolutely wonderful: charismatic, brooding and brutal (ok, I know it's female drooling over him, but I simply can't help it!). And as his character gained more and more dimensions I simply fell in love with him myself. He is upright, honest and despite strict discipline passionate and sensitive. One of my favourite scenes with him - all his scenes are my favourites when I come to think about it! - is when he is watching Margaret depart in the carriage and concetrating his whole being on making her look back ... OOOOHHHHH, his sheer force of concentration/compulsion sent shivers down my spine. I think his character is wonderfully elaborated: starting from the ""brute"" beating one of his employees cruelly (though it turns out he has his reasons); the loving son the mother is devoted to; the man suffering to control his unreturned love and passion; the rejected man in love helping Margaret (although he is risking his credibility and reputation as a magistrate) despite his hurt feelings; the employer getting closer to his workers (dining with them together)and a future family man (treating the little orphan kindly). The happy smile (SIGH, SIGH) at the end is as becoming as his brooding before.Richard Armitage (son) and Sinead Cusack (Hannah Thornton, the mother) are simply wonderful together. The strong bond of affection, based on their absolute trust in each other, is almost tangible between them. I think my top favourite scenes are their pas de deux before and after the proposal. They really took my breath away.Daniela is a lovely, sensitive Margaret, though a bit pale and monoton besdide Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack. However she succeeds in displaying the gradual change of her character: from prejudiced, sophisticated Southerner to a person appreciating people for their true worth not for the (country)sides they represent.Fanny, Thornton's sister is harshly colourful in clothes and vulgar and hilarious in character very suitingly opposed to both her mother & brother and Margaret. Her light touch is very welcome.The minor characters - Margaret's parents, Nicholas & Betsey Higgins, Mr Bell, the other mill owners - play their parts very convincingly.The strong contrasts are everywhere: in scenery, coustumes, colours and music. I think the costumes suited the characters very well - dark, strict colours for John and Hannah Thornton, light and feminine for Margaret, harsh for Fanny. The music is also very moving. The Edinburgh scenery for Milton suits the atmosphere of the series wonderfully.BUY THIS!

The story is in some ways similar to PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, except NORTH AND SOUTH is a far more serious tale with more depth and with a greater overall message.This mini-series version is mostly faithful to the original story, but if you have time, you should read the book first before you watch the movie.  There is so much in the book that enriches the movie, and the love story will be SO much more emotionally satisfying when you get the details of how much Margaret really endured during her 18 months in Milton.  Usually people who know and love a book are disappointed when they see a film version, but not here.  While a cinematic productions always has it's little deviations, this particular one is so absolutely faithful the the spirit and intent of the book that there was nothing that left me feeling unfulfilled when I saw it.  Still, I think that having read the book made me appreciate the movie more than if I didn't already know the story.The end of this movie version is somewhat changed - the story itself has not been altered, but the setting has been changed to enhance the romance of the end.  Usually, I am a purist and hate when moviemakers deviate even a little bit from a book that I love, however, I have to say that this is one of the VERY RARE cinematic alterations that actually improves on the original by enhancing the original story without changing the outcome.I could go on and on about how well this movie was cast (nailing the spirit of the characters in a way that I seldom see onscreen), the first rate acting (from the most incidental extra all the way up to the lead parts), the great directing, lush scenery, costumes, musical score, and reasonably accurate screenplay.  But if I go on and on, you will have less time to enjoy this  masterpiece.SO.  If you are a sucker for intensely moving romance, with more depth than is ordinary, then you will love NORTH AND SOUTH.

Netflix kept recommending it to me because of my tendencies towards BBC romances. I've always been a die hard Jane Austen fan.Originally I was a bit confused, because I'm familiar with North and South, the American Civil War miniseries. I couldn't figure out why Netflix kept saying I should try North & South because of my previous interest in movies like Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. I never read the synopsis for movies, because I hate ruining the plot. I added it to my watch instantly queue and gave it a go.Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised! North & South consists of 4 ""episodes"" which tell the tale of Margaret Hale (played by Daniela Denby-Ashe) and John Thornton (played by the spectacular and oh-so-gorgeous Richard Armitage). After being uprooted from her home, Margaret and her family settle down up north in Milton, an industrial city known for its production of cotton. Margaret meets Mr. Thornton, a tough cotton mill owner, under less that desirable circumstances and takes an immediate dislike to the man.The story from there follows Margaret's efforts to feel at home in a foreign and unhappy place. She misses her life in the south, her home which she often called 'paradise' and London, where she spent so much time with her beloved cousin and friends. You watch as she gains new friends, learns about herself and the realities of life, and undergoes great joys and tragedies.If you love romantic movies and BBC, you have to check out North & South!

I did not want it to end!The cast is unforgetable with Richard Armitage as the stern, proud but compelling John Thornton,(he's so darn gorgeous!) and the lovely Daniela Denby-Ashe as the headstrong and forthright but charming Margaret Hale.There's many similarities between, this series and Pride and Prejudice but it stands out brilliantly.It's about a woman, Margaret Hale, from the South who moves from her romantic, sleepy laidback village, with her family, to the North and whose life collides with that of an intemperate if misunderstood industrialist, the charismatic mill-owner, John Thornton, in a bustling, northern city of Milton.Instantly she gets into a dispute with him over his harsh treatment of an employee.What she doesn't notice is Thornton's deep sense of responsibility for his employees' welfare. On the other hand, he misinterprets some of Margaret's own actions and intentions. But he is instantly attracted to her, while she has only the deepest contempt for him.Later, she refuses his offer of marriage, only to realise far too late the kind of man he really is. Hard and harsh he may be, but he's also a man of stength and intergrity but it seems he no longer feels the same way he did about her, after catching her in a compromising situation... but despite it all, he still protects her reputation.And that's another tangled web to watch unravel.Like in most period drama's, they both are stubborn and drag out their obvious attraction over many painful months and events, and I loved every bit of it.This series rates right up there for me along with Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre... perhaps ever higher. It's beautifully filmed and has some heart-wrenching moments that causes a tear or two.I think John Thornton is the most romantic hero and he definitely beats Darcy, hands down.

Since its first broadcast, viewers across the globe have hailed it as one of the best - if not the best - British period miniseries ever produced. It was voted BBC's ""Best of 2004"" in drama, actor and actress categories, among others.Many in the US will probably confuse Elizabeth Gaskell's ""North & South"" to John Jake's civil war drama of the same name.  While Jake's tells the story of America's north and south, Gaskell's story is rooted in Victorian England. John Thornton, a handsome, stern, passionate manufacturer from Milton represents the north. Margaret Hale, an outspoken, beautiful and spirited young woman from Helstone represents the south.  When the Hales move from the idyllic village of Helstone to the bustling, industrial city of Milton, Margaret and Thornton's lives collide.John Thornton is instantly attracted to Margaret while she is repulsed by his haughty demeanor and the way he treats his employees.  She develops a disdain for the wealthy 'masters' (manufacturers) and strikes a friendship with the daughter of the local union leader, much to Thornton's dismay.  As Margaret becomes better acquainted with Mr. Thornton, she gradually comes to admire him.  She discovers that he is hardworking, a devoted brother and son, generous and kind to Margaret's parents, and is loyal and honorable.  However, when the workers in Milton strike, the turn of events that follow drive a wedge between Margaret and Thornton and eventually threaten to pull them apart.""North & South"" is produced by the excellent BBC and the screenplay was written by Sandy Welch, who also penned the outstanding ""Our Mutual Friend.""  Everything you would expect from a topnotch BBC production is here - locations, sets, costumes, casting, direction, cinematography.  The story is an adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's little known but well loved 19th century novel.  Mrs. Gaskell also wrote ""Wives & Daughters"" which was turned to another superb miniseries starring Justine Waddell, Keeley Hawes and Francesca Annis in 1999.I would be very remiss in writing a review for this miniseries without applauding the exemplary cast.  The little known Richard Armitage has earned a throng of fans overnight because of his unforgettable portrayal of John Thornton.  He has since replaced Pride & Prejudice's Colin Firth as my favorite brooding hero and infuses so much passion and charisma into his role.  Daniela Denby-Ashe is wonderful and charming as Margaret Hale.  Also excellent are Brendan Coyle as the gruff but good-hearted Nicholas Higgins, Sinead Cusack as John Thornton's haughty but devoted mother, Joy Joyner as the funny and superficial Fanny Thornton, Lesley Manville as Mrs. Hale and Tim Piggot-Smith as Mr. Hale.""North & South"" has since replaced 1995's ""Pride & Prejudice"" as my favorite miniseries.  It tugs at the heart and sweeps the viewer off their feet.  The relationships that develop between its main characters (notably, Thornton and Margaret; Thornton and Higgins; Margaret and Bessy Higgins) and the journey that Margaret and Thornton go through are truly unforgettable.  In fact, you will wish that the ending didn't come so soon!""North and South"" went through a sad process of editing when BBC America aired it in July 2005. A full hour was cut from the miniseries to make room for commercials.  Finally, with this dvd release US viewers now have a chance to see this instant classic as it was meant to be seen - with a 233 minute running time and with all the scenes intact.  The dvd also includes a delightful interview with Richard Armitage, a handful of deleted scenes (including an extended 'proposal' scene), commentaries and cast biographies.If you are an anglophile or a fan of high-quality period drama, you owe it to yourself to see ""North & South."" Fans of ""Pride & Prejudice,"" ""Wives & Daughters,"" ""Middlemarch,"" Dickens / Austen adaptations and the like should not miss this.  I have no doubt that most of you will fall in love with this miniseries as many of us have. Everyone whom I have recommended this miniseries to have at least liked it (and at most, are completely obsessed with it).

First, the acting/choice of actors. Let's start with the most noteable (and most fun to talk about :)). Richard Armitage as John Thornton is now one of my favorite 19th century heroes. I love his raw emotion! His acting has such a genuine quality to it. Daniela Denby-Ashe is a wonderful Magaret Hale. I can't put my finger on what, exactly, is so good about her performance, it just fits. I like that both of these actors are good looking, but not so attractive that it makes the rest of us feel intimidated. It's their personalities that draw me in, not their looks. Although their appearances do help... especially in the case of Mr. Armitage, whom I can't help noticing is incredibly fine, me being a mortal female.Also I have to mention Fanny Thornton. I don't know the name of the actress who plays her, but she did a fantastic job. She cracks me up. And (forgive me if I misspell it) Sinead Cusack, who plays Fanny and John's mother, did a very noticeably good job.The story of course is wonderful. I love the plot turns! And the score is perfect. The music is almost haunting; it fits the story quite well. For those of you have read the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, this adaption stays fairly close to it. There are a few liberties taken but all in all it's a very accurate adaption, much of it word-for-word with what happens in the book.I could go on for days, but that most likely would not be received well by anyone reading this.

The love story here is very similar to that between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. She takes an initial dislike while he reluctantly forms an attration, there is a botched proposal, she gradually comes to see his good qualities and falls in love herself. It is the REST of the story that puts this one over the top. The hero, Mr. Thorton, is the master of a cotton mill, while the heroine, Margaret, befriends a group of strike-ready mill workers. The viewer can understand both sides of the struggle and it is really interesting to see how it plays out.

883444,A1IM6GAVUQJ27X,B0007N1BBC,Michael Kim,"[37, 41]","I viewed the recent BBC production of Jane Eyre. Then I heard about another well reviewed series North and South. I read Elizabeth Gaskell's noveland purchased and viewed the DVD of the 2004 BBC production. It's a wonderful story of love, reminiscent of Darcy and Elizabeth from Austen's Pride and Prejudice, in a backdrop of the changes being wrought by the Industrial Revolution. The BBC production stays mostly faithful to the overall themes of the novel, although it does take a major leap of dramatic license at the end. What makes this work so interesting is instead of the closed world of landed gentry portrayed in Jane Austen's work or the gothic psychological inwardness of Charlotte Bronte, Gaskell through her characters (especially the interaction between the Hales and Thorntons) explores how the Industrial Revolution was overturning the last remnants of the old feudal/aristocratic order -- to be replaced by commerce and money. At first, Mrs. Hale and Miss Margaret Hale look down on the mill-owning Thorntons because they are engaged in trade, while Mr. Hale is an educated ex-clergyman of the Church of England. The females in the Thornton family look down on the Hales because they are relatively poor while they have achieved great financial success in textile manufacturing. The BBC series reinforces this societal tension when Mr. Thornton meets some relations of Margaret's -- who live in London -- at the Great Exhibition (no such scene took place in the novel), and one of them in a condescending tone mentions his brother wants to ""dabble"" in the cotton trade; Mr. Thornton as his usual brooding self responds, to paraphrase, that 'he does not dabble.' Also, as a Yank I was captivated by the different accents of the southern Hales versus the northern Thorntons. On top of this conflict between the old and new elite, labor strife is personified by union leader Nicholas Higgins, who organizes a strike against the cotton mills -- including Mr. Thornton's, with the hope of improving the lives of downtrodden mill workers.The production value of this mini-series is tremendous. In scenes in the Hales' old residence of Helstone one sees an idyllic rural setting where the sun always shines. In contrast, in the industrial city of Milton (Manchester) it's always gray, and I do not remember ever seeing the sun come out. The scene where Miss. Hale meets Mr. Thornton for the first time is spectacular, another departure from the novel, as she is shocked to see the workings of a cotton mill as particulates of cotton float around her as if it is snowing. The overall feel of the mini-series is rather grim, appropriate for an industrial setting, with sorrowful music dominating the score.There are many great acting performances. Among them is Richard Armitage as John Thornton. He fits Gaskell's portrayal of the self-made man who underneath his proud, brooding exterior has inner self-doubt about his worth because he is not a gentleman based on Margaret's standards. His mother Hannah Hale played by Sinead Cusack steals the scenes she's in. One can call her the original Iron Lady but underneath a hard as nails exterior is a mother devoted and proud of what her son has achieved. One sees a beautiful portrayal of a mother's love for her son when she consoles him over Miss. Hale's rejection of his proposal of marriage. Of course, immediately after that she growls her indignant hate of Miss. Hale for rejecting her son. Brendan Coyle is excellent as the union leader Nicholas Higgins who tries to get what he feels are fair wages for his workers. Despite being on opposites side of, to use Marxian terminology, the bourgeoisie/proletariat divide he and Mr. Thornton discover they are more alike than they are at first willing to admit. Finally, Tim Pigott-Smith plays the quiet, dignified Mr. Hale who is burdened by what he has done to his family in leaving the Church of England over a matter of conscience.Besides these factors what really stands out is how the series presents both sides of the conflict between workers and capitalists. In one scene, we see the workers under Higgins' leadership discuss how their wages were cut five years ago, and how they want their old wages restored just to keep up with the increasing prices of food and other necessities -- while in another scene Mr. Thornton and his mother discuss their problems in competing against the flood of textile imports from America. Viewing this series was a nice antedote to having to watch that horrid Norma Rae in college.Finally, in an era in which businessmen are portrayed as evil in most Hollywood movies, this series presents a compelling protagonist in Mr. Thornton the capitalist. We really see his mind at work when his hosts a supper with the other mill owners and invites Mr. Hale to join them. (I find myself wishing to be in the company of these men who look like they are having a good time drinking, smoking and talking business than in some stuffy drawing room discussing polite topics.)  They are discussing whether to install fans at the mills to lessen the ""fluff"" in the air. Mr. Hale argues it's a Christian thing to do. But Mr. Thornton who has installed the fans argues morality has no role to play. He installed the fans because it keeps the workers healthy and more productive, justifying the investment in the fans. One can see the torch passing from the spiritual world to one of impersonal economic calculation. I must admit my blood was roused by Mr. Thornton's clear economic rationale and how the power of market forces in this case benefits both workers and owners. I have not seen a more positive portrayal of a businessman in quite some time. Yes, he does soften around the edges as the story progresses but he does not renounce who he is.",5,Love During the Industrial Revolution,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,5782,"['viewed', 'recent', 'BBC',

It was THAT good.  Richard Armitage's Thornton, as someone else mentions, just smolders on the screen - his deep, soul-piercing looks at the actress that plays Margaret just sent thrills up my spine.  The story is very much a Pride and Prejudice type tale, with some reversals - Thornton has Darcy's pride and reserve and is misunderstood by the 'Lizzie' type - Margaret - in some ways, but unlike P and P, he is the one who is socially 'below' Margaret, who is a gentleman's/parson's daughter, and the daughter of a member of the nobility/society, and has lived amongst the social belles of London.  Margaret has not been exposed before going to the industrial town of Milton to the extreme poverty and dreariness of the early booming industrial revolution, and the exposure/comparison to that environment compared to the idyllic countryside and flower-filled scenery around her beloved parsonage home of Hellstone are a shock to her and her mother.  Margaret, however, is a strong, independent woman, the equal in many ways to the temperament and strength of Thornton, though his violent treatment of one of his employees repels and shocks her when they first meet, and sets the stage for her hate which eventually turns to love.  The proposal scene is also very much like Austen's between Darcy and Elizabeth.  I have not read the novel so cannot compare to how this production differs from Gaskell's book, but I have loved all the Gaskell novel adaptations by the BBC and so far this is over and above my favorite, as the love story is so engrossing alongside the historical details of the early cotton mills.  The sets and costumes are also amazing, as well as the acting by the rest of the cast, particularly the lady who plays Thornton's mother - incredible.

883455,A3DDPQ9342UNMY,B0007N1BBC,"N. Doyle ""film buff""","[5, 6]","I've always admired the way Victorian England is used so effectively in British TV series and nowhere is this more evident than in NORTH AND SOUTH, the story of relationships between different classes in British society during the 1850s.The story itself bears a strong resemblance to Charlotte Bronte's work, SHIRLEY, a novel that dealt largely with strikes and mill owners. Since Elizabeth Gaskell was a good friend of Charlotte Bronte, it's no wonder that her story deals with some of the same customs and values as Bronte's work.RICHARD ARMITAGE, whose very image conjurs up remembrance of Laurence Olivier's Heathcliff in ""Wuthering Heights,"" has a glowering presence and uses it to portray the hard-working mill owner who has to bear down on his workers when it looks as though his cotton mill is about to face a strike. He makes an unfavorable impression on the heroine of the story, played assuredly by DANIELA DENBY-ASHE, who has come north with her family to relocate in a climate and atmosphere not particularly to her liking.The story delves into the conflicts in many relationships, but keeps the central focus on the intense attraction between the two main characters despite their differences. SINEAD CUSACK as the man's shrewdly possessive mother gives a sharp characterization and TIM PIGOTT-SMITH as the girl's dignified father and BRENDAN COYLE as a rough mill worker are excellent in colorful supporting roles. The entire cast gets into the spirit of the drama and contribute to the uniformly fine quality of the acting.For romantics who pine over Victorian romance, surely this is one of the best of its kind with production values in costumes and settings that cannot be bettered. A viewer is certain to want to see more of Gaskell's work brought to the screen after the successful transition of this full-blooded character study.",5,Excellent transition of Gaskell's novel to the screen...,1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,1851,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'admired', 'way', 'Victorian', 'England', 'used', 'so', 'effectively', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'nowhere', 'more', 'evident', 'NORTH', 'AND', 'SOUTH', 'story', 'relationships', 'different', 'classes', 'British', 'society', '1850s.The', 'story', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'work', 'SHIRLEY', 'novel', 'largely', 'strikes', 'mill', 'owners', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'was', 'good', 'friend', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'wonder', 'story', 'deals', 'same', 'customs', 'values', 'Bronte', 'work.RICHARD', 'ARMITAGE', 'very', 'image', 'up', 'remembrance', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Heathcliff', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'glowering', 'presence', 'portray', 'hard-working', 'mill', 'owner', 'who', 'bear', 'down', 'workers', 'when', 'cotton', 'mill', 'face', 'strike', 'unfavorable', 'impression', 'heroine', 'story', 'played', 'assuredly', 'DANIELA', 'DENBY-ASHE', 'who', 'come', 'north', 'family', 'relocate', 'climate', 'atmosphere', 'not', 'particularly', 'liking.The', 'story', 'delves', 'conflicts', 'many', 'relationships', 'central', 'focus', 'intense', 'attraction', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'differences', 'SINEAD', 'CUSACK', 'man', 'shrewdly', 'possessive', 'mother', 'sharp', 'characterization', 'TIM', 'PIGOTT-SMITH', 'girl', 'dignified', 'father', 'BRENDAN', 'COYLE', 'rough', 'mill', 'worker', 'are', 'excellent', 'colorful', 'supporting', 'roles', 'entire', 'cast', 'spirit', 'drama', 'contribute', 'uniformly', 'fine', 'quality', 'acting.For', 'romantics', 'who', 'pine', 'Victorian', 'romance', 'surely', 'one', 'best', 'kind', 'production', 'values', 'costumes', 'settings', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bettered', 'viewer', 'certain', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'Gaskell', 'work', 'brought', 'screen', 'successful', 'transition', 'full-blooded', 'character', 'study']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

883468,A29L5XFQV8KD00,B0007N1BBC,p. g.,"[7, 7]","Though I love many of the BBC products, Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South a top 2 favorite of anything I've viewed.The characters are so well portrayed.  They brought you to believe in their causes, even on opposing sides of the issues,  and you could tangibly feel their emotions in various scenes.The three lead characters, John Thornton, Nicholas Higgins and Margaret Hale were strong in their ideals and communicated these  effectively. Yet very interestingly, in their personal relationships, specifically the proposal scene, John Thornton and Margaret Hale are  communicating on seemingly different 'frequencies' and misinterpreting each others words at every statement. You literally feel the frustration of their conversation.  You can however, understand their previous communications and feelings lend themselves to these statement misinterpretations.One reason I was so drawn to this story were the high ideals and morality of  Thornton and Higgins to do 'the right thing' regarding workers/co-workers and to be men of their word with great integrity.  The  great mutual respect they end up having for one another is so well deserved and fits with their character portrayals.  Their integrity and morality makes them two of my favorite characters of all time and one reason N&S; is in my top 2 pick.Margaret also has ideal of trying to do 'what is right', yet her character at times seems to hold on to a bit of a grudge.  She also seems 'sleepy'/dullish in faculties at times(very limited though).As for feeling the emotion, (SPOILER ALERT) Margaret's departure scene from Thornton's mill - you feel it inside!  Also as she says goodbye to the Higgins'. Other spots, when Thornton finally gets she has a brother in Spain- you go ""YEAAAAH"".  And there are others.When I got this dvd, I literally watched it 4 times in 1 week.There are so many nuances and fine points to the characters and scenes, as well as the repeated yellow roses which I only noticed in half the spots till about the third time.This story comes more alive each time I watch.

I couldn't resist reading the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell (which is a really good book, it's now one of my favorites)... the movie is kinda like the book, although the production is (i confess) much better because of the modernization for us younger female watchers.The story begins with Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) at her cousin's wedding in London where she is talking to a young man (who would later propose to her but she would refuse) about how wonderful her country life is where her father is parson and her mother is a sweet yet delicate woman.Mr. Hale moves the entire family (including the maid Dixon) up North to the mill town of Milton (for a reason I wont tell!!!) and they are set up in a little house.Country girl Margaret absolutely hates the dirt and noise and the utter gruffness of the millworkers in Milton and the town itself.  But there is nothing Margaret hates more than the handsome, intellegent, lovely, mean, handsome mill owner John Thornton.Being an obsessed P&P; watcher and reader, Mr. Thornton really reminded me of Mr. Darcy (accept much meaner) and well Richard Armitage is such a great actor and such a good looking man that I was very happy with the choice of him for Mr. Thornton.The choice of Margaret was a dissapointment.  In the book Margaret is suppose to be a strikingly beautiful young woman but I felt that Daniela Denby-Ashe was a little bit too Eastern European looking and tough.  I knew that she was making her voice sound very ... delicate... but I just felt that Margaret was not presented in the way that she should have -- strong willed, intelligent, and beautiful buuuut I did get over that by the end, the wonderfully romantic ending.In the romance department (which I'm quite aware of since I did a huge project on romance novels and I'm in love, literally in love, with Barbara Cartland) there were parts that just made me ... sigh.I especially loved how the writers of the script put in the ""looking over the shoulder at Mr. Thornton"" and added that part in the swirling snow where Mr. Thornton squints his eyes and hoarsly whispers ""look back..look back at me"" ... sighbut the end... what can I say.. my heart flutters just thinking about it.  I wont tell you'll just have to watch it.The plot of the movie has a lot of twists and turns, and I feel is quite accurate to the time period of mills and unions, where the worker had no right and could only hope that their demands would be met through striking.  For some reason though, Mr. Thornton and Margaret are always in the right places and the right time to see the wrong things about each other.The entire story is a relationship built upon misunderstanding and confusion and about the supression of truly passionate feelings.  North and South is such a good movie and novel. I would HIGHLY recommend watching this incredible BBC production!",5,BBC's North and WOW !,1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,3217,"['review', 'PD', 'Daughter', 'reason', 'bought', 'DVD', 'heard', 'how', 'wonderful', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'deemed', 'best', 'BBC', 'production', 'ever', 'Well', 'have', 'agree', 'actually', 'really', 'love', 'most', 'BBC', 'productions', 'watched', '233', 'minute', 'program', 'one', 'sitting', 'way', 'bedtime', 'just', 'had', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'reading', 'novel', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'really', 'good', 'book', 'now', 'one', 'favorites', 'movie', 'kinda', 'book', 'production', 'i', 'confess', 'much', 'better', 'modernization', 'younger', 'female', 'watchers.The', 'story', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'cousin', 'wedding', 'London', 'where', 'talking', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'propose', 'would', 'refuse', 'how', 'wonderful', 'country', 'life', 'where', 'father', 'parson', 'mother', 'sweet', 'yet', 'delicate', 'woman.Mr', 'Hale', 'entire', 'family', 'including', 'maid', 'Dixon', 'up', 'North', 'mill', 'town', 'Milton', 'reason', 'wont', 'tell', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'little', 'house.Country', 'girl', 'Margaret', 'absolutely', 'dirt', 'noise', 'utter', 'gruffness', 'millworkers', 'Milton', 'town', 'nothing', 'Margaret', 'more', 'handsome', 'intellegent', 'lovely', 'mean', 'handsome', 'mill', 'owner', 'John', 'Thornton.Being', 'obsessed', 'P', 'P', 'reader', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'really', 'reminded', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'accept', 'much', 'meaner', 'well', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'such', 'great', 'actor', 'good', 'looking', 'man', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'choice', 'Mr.', 'Thornton.The', 'choice', 'Margaret', 'was', 'dissapointment', 'book', 'Margaret', 'suppose', 'be', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'felt', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'Eastern', 'European', 'looking', 'tough', 'knew', 'was', 'making', 'voice', 'sound', 'very', 'delicate', 'just', 'felt', 'Margaret', 'was', 'not', 'presented', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'strong', 'willed', 'intelligent', 'beautiful', 'buuuut', 'did', 'get', 'end', 'wonderfully', 'romantic', 'ending.In', 'romance', 'department', ""'m"", 'quite', 'aware', 'did', 'huge', 'project', 'romance', 'novels', ""'m"", 'love', 'literally', 'love', 'Barbara', 'Cartland', 'were', 'parts', 'just', 'made', 'sigh.I', 'especially', 'loved', 'how', 'writers', 'script', 'put', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'added', 'part', 'swirling', 'snow', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'eyes', 'hoarsly', 'whispers', 'look', 'back..look', 'back', 'end', 'what', 'can', 'say..', 'heart', 'flutters', 'just', 'thinking', 'wont', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'it.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'lot', 'twists', 'turns', 'feel', 'quite', 'accurate', 'time', 'period', 'mills', 'unions', 'where', 'worker', 'had', 'right', 'could', 'only', 'hope', 'demands', 'would', 'be', 'met', 'striking', 'reason', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'Margaret', 'are', 'always', 'right', 'places', 'right', 'time', 'see', 'wrong', 'things', 'other.The', 'entire', 'story', 'relationship', 'built', 'misunderstanding', 'confusion', 'supression', 'truly', 'passionate', 'feelings', 'North', 'South', 'such', 'good', 'movie', 'novel', 'would', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'watching', 'incredible', 'BBC', 'production']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

I bought this for my wife based on the reviews here on Amazon and we were completely captured by it. Extremely well-done - acting, photography, etc.Some viewers on the BBC website have taken issue with the adaptation from Gaskell's novel, but for the most part, the story coheres and is intact within itself. Only in the last scene does the script and director seem to depart from strict Victorian mores as an accomodation to modern sensibilities. But even then, it's hardly a deal-breaker.As good as Pride and Prejudice? I can't say that exactly, since P&P; was at least twice as long and had more time to be more entertaining. But I will say this -- N&S; was far, far superior to most dramas on Masterpiece Theatre in recent years. Certainly equal to Wives and Daughters, and probably better. N&S; has the benefit of a better male role in Mr. Thornton, and this production has the indisputable asset of Richard Armitage. My wife really liked him and I think that Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is in serious danger of being dethroned as the 19th Century paragon of appeal.It seems to me that Gaskell adapts to the screen more successfully than Dickens is.

883477,AQR22MPF45M3P,B0007N1BBC,Rachel Ford,"[3, 3]","North & South is a tale of people shaped by a time and place. There is first Margaret Hale, the compassionate, strong willed daughter of a country churchman; Mr. Hale, the aforementioned former pastor who, moved by doubt and conscience, resigns his post in the rural south of England and moves his family to the bleak, northern industrial town of Milton; John Thornton, stern-faced master of a cotton mill who, driven by family tragedy, strives to maximize the ever important bottom line without destroying his workers in the process -- all for the sake of the business, of course; Mrs. Thornton, John's mother, who is as fierce an advocate for her son as she is a ruthless capitalist; Nicholas, the determined union boss who sees the need -- and opportunity -- for improvement; his daughter, Bess, who has paid the ultimate price for the industrial revolution; etc.This is very much a human story, a story of people separated by a vast chasm of varied experience and situation, who must, through bitter trial and even at times against their will, come to recognize at least a modicum of virtue in their fellow man's opposing viewpoint. Thus, as it begins, to Mr. Thornton the smoker who endangers the entire mill and its hundreds of workers by smoking amidst highly flammable conditions, is a threat who must be dealt with expeditiously and fiercely; to Miss Hale, he is an unarmed man who daren't defend himself, and the beating of him is an exercise in excess and cruelty. To Nicholas and his fellow mill workers, the master's claim that there is no money to meet their demands is proof of duplicity and further abuse; and, to Mr. Thornton, it is the reality of his world. There are at work in this film several competing factors -- the generous nature of slow, easy-going rural life contrasted with the cold realities of a fast, hard industrial world; the bottom line for a business as opposed to the comfort and welfare of its employees; even the moderate climate of the south versus the chill of the north.As these many, competing themes come into play, friendships are formed, lives are destroyed, hearts are broken, and life goes on as it always has. This is a story of people in the midst of turmoil. It is bleak, terrible and hopeless at points; and for all that it probably ends on too optimistic a note to ring wholly true. But that is not a bad thing -- after portraying so much suffering and pain, it is a relief to have a happy ending (or as happy as one can expect, given the circumstances).This is a phenomenal series; the story is, as you may have guessed from my description thus far, agonizingly good, but the screenplay, acting, costumes and settings are all perfect. The two main stars are phenomenal, but so too are the supporting characters; everyone becomes who he or she is supposed to be. 5/5 stars -- a great story perfectly executed",5,Destinies forged in the birth of modern industry,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,2861,"['North', 'South', 'tale', 'people', 'shaped', 'time', 'place', 'first', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'compassionate', 'strong', 'willed', 'daughter', 'country', 'churchman', 'Mr.', 'Hale', 'aforementioned', 'former', 'pastor', 'who', 'moved', 'doubt', 'conscience', 'resigns', 'post', 'rural', 'south', 'England', 'family', 'bleak', 'northern', 'industrial', 'town', 'Milton', 'John', 'Thornton', 'stern-faced', 'master', 'cotton', 'mill', 'who', 'driven', 'family', 'tragedy', 'maximize', 'ever', 'important', 'bottom', 'line', 'destroying', 'workers', 'process', 'sake', 'business', 'course', 'Mrs.', 'Thornton', 'John', 'mother', 'who', 'as', 'fierce', 'advocate', 'son', 'ruthless', 'capitalist', 'Nicholas', 'determined', 'union', 'boss', 'who', 'need', 'opportunity', 'improvement', 'daughter', 'Bess', 'who', 'paid', 'ultimate', 'price', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'very', 'much', 'human', 'story', 'story', 'people', 'separated', 'vast', 'chasm', 'varied', 'experience', 'situation', 'who', 'must', 'bitter', 'trial', 'even', 'times', 'will', 'come', 'recognize', 'least', 'modicum', 'virtue', 'fellow', 'man', 'opposing', 'viewpoint', 'Thus', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'smoker', 'who', 'entire', 'mill', 'hundreds', 'workers', 'smoking', 'amidst', 'highly', 'flammable', 'conditions', 'threat', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'dealt', 'expeditiously', 'fiercely', 'Miss', 'Hale', 'unarmed', 'man', 'who', 'dare', ""n't"", 'defend', 'beating', 'exercise', 'excess', 'cruelty', 'Nicholas', 'fellow', 'mill', 'workers', 'master', 'claim', 'money', 'meet', 'demands', 'proof', 'duplicity', 'further', 'abuse', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'reality', 'world', 'are', 'work', 'film', 'several', 'competing', 'factors', 'generous', 'nature', 'slow', 'easy-going', 'rural', 'life', 'contrasted', 'cold', 'realities', 'fast', 'hard', 'industrial', 'world', 'bottom', 'line', 'business', 'opposed', 'comfort', 'welfare', 'employees', 'even', 'moderate', 'climate', 'south', 'chill', 'north.As', 'many', 'competing', 'themes', 'come', 'play', 'friendships', 'are', 'formed', 'lives', 'are', 'destroyed', 'hearts', 'are', 'broken', 'life', 'always', 'story', 'people', 'midst', 'turmoil', 'bleak', 'terrible', 'hopeless', 'points', 'probably', 'too', 'optimistic', 'note', 'ring', 'wholly', 'true', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'portraying', 'so', 'much', 'suffering', 'pain', 'relief', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'as', 'happy', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'given', 'circumstances', '.This', 'phenomenal', 'series', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'guessed', 'description', 'thus', 'far', 'agonizingly', 'good', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'perfect', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'so', 'too', 'are', 'supporting', 'characters', 'everyone', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', '5/5', 'stars', 'great', 'story', 'perfectly', 'executed']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

883480,A1MHJTVNMPDBES,B0007N1BBC,Ravyn,"[24, 24]","I rarely buy DVDs without having first seen the film, but based on reviews posted here and over on Netflix, the very favorable comparisons made to Colin Firth's Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice"" and Richard Armitage's John Thornton in ""North and South"", I rushed out and bought this sight unseen. I didn't really expect it to live up to all the rave reviews, but I'm delighted to say it exceeded them, and oh, what a romantic ending -- compares favorably the ending in the Kiera Knightley/Matthew Macfayden movie, ""Pride and Prejudice"" although it takes place beginning on a railway platform and ending inside a train carriage.I certainly can see why many compare ""North and South"" with ""Pride and Prejudice"" although most refer to the 1995 BBC production. But I would include the 2005 film in my comparison (and I love both versions) because, for example, I really noticed the close-ups on the touching of Thornton's and Margaret's hands, especially at the dinner party (I half expected Thornton to flex his hand as Macfayden's Darcy did; he doesn't) and later Margaret kissing his hand -- both these events compare very favorably with Matthew Macfayden's Darcy's reaction to holding Lizzy's hand to help her in a carriage and the ending when she kisses his hand. And Thornton's more casual look in the final sequences without his coat and cravat -- which gives him a romantic Lord Byron look in his big sleeved white shirt with wide cuffs which come to his knuckles -- rivals the casual look Darcy presented when he comes to Lizzy at dawn at the end of the film. These men go from being buttoned up and formal to more casual romantic suitors. It's very pleasing. I think most women will swoon at the kisses -- the best I've seen in a very long time -- as I did and it is true the 5+ minute ending is one of the most romantic and satisfying ever filmed. I've rewatched it many times.Although the excellent story (wonderfully acted throughout by a talented cast) is grim at times (people do die in this), and it is certainly not the lighthearted fare of ""Pride and Prejudice"" as it deals with the Industrial Revolution -- the horrifying working conditions in the cotton mills, strikers versus their employers -- I think the story is more real and easier to relate to than ""Pride and Prejudice."" And, interestingly enough, it is a story which would more easily be updated to a present day story in some ways (look at United Airlines, General Motors and others which are struggling with worker's vs. management, layoffs and averting financial ruin). I found it is easier to relate to businessman/entrepreneur John Thornton struggling to run his cotton mill, a huge manufacturing complex, as he deals with restless workers and the market forces of the cotton industry (the pre-Civil War Americans -- this story is set around 1850 -- are flooding the English markets with cheap cotton products and English manufacturers like Thornton are having a hard time competing) than to landed gentry and matchmaking of Jane Austen's books. This business aspect, as well as certain parts of the love story, are almost contemporary.The love/hate, pride/prejudice behavior between Thornton and Margaret definitely rivals in many ways the Elizabeth/Darcy relationship right down to her rejection of his offer of marriage, their verbal barbs, his walking from her home after his rejected proposal (shades of Colin Firth's Darcy leaving Mr. Collin's house after Lizzy rejected him). Above all, Richard Armitage (a very handsome actor) as Thornton definitely does smoulder as much as Colin Firth's Darcy did -- maybe more so.

I initially ordered this for my Kindle; but when I got the DVD for a separate device, I discovered a number of additional scenes, as well as &#34;special features&#34; that I really enjoyed.I read a previous review by someone who pointed out that the Margaret Hale character is one of the few who was never portrayed in a sexist way, or treated as &#34;less than&#34; in any scenes. So true. Her character again and again spoke her mind; and then she lived with the results. And the results were not the typical slap-in-your-face or insulting to your intelligence. Her life and how she lived was thoughtful and real. (well, as real as a period drama gets)This series honestly presents the many conflicts of industry vs. social concerns. That they did it in a love story made it quite genuine and touching. As grownups, we know that everything is a shade of grey--or we do if we've experienced any kind of tragedy in our lives. To see that same shading in a costume drama is so wonderful. So many things presented as entertainment today are stupid, vapid, misogynistic, and just garbage. It's wonderful to watch something that has realistic, complex characters respectfully and fully acted by talented folks...to get all that in a heartfelt romance is such a treat.

883485,A3T0A0NM8636JW,B0007N1BBC,"Revital Shapira ""Book lover and illustrator""","[3, 4]","I enjoy many costume dramas by the BBC but this one stand out, in my opinion, because of the realistic depiction of the social struggles and living condition in post industrialized England in the second half of the 19 century. It really surprised me, and for the better - I was expecting to see a sappy love story, presented in period costumes and sprinkled with some British upper crust accent, but found it a much more down to earth and engrossing drama that doesn't just deal with romance but with the real lives and challenges of the people of that time.  And as far as accents go it's refreshing to hear  some beautiful English northern accents, and when spoken with Richard Armitage's intoxicating baritone they sound even better.Many viewers have compared this mini series to Austen's &#34;Pride and prejudice&#34; because of the resemblance in the main character's relationship, but as a whole piece, those two don't even live in the same universe.Forget about all those Jane's Austin's adaptations you've seen of green english country side . This story takes place in the industrialized north, and there are factories, and child labour, poverty and despair, and the color you'll see most is grey.  In fact, it is so bleak and hopeless, it has put me off at first, and I had to make myself keep watching (of course, I'm very happy I did).I would say that the comparison I would make between &#34;North and south&#34; would be to Dickens, and not Austen. You see so much misery and sickness related to the work in the cotton mills and death is so present in the this story, it feels like a Charles dickens book, only without all the many grotesque characters with bizarre names. I have to say it was both moving AND depressing, as you see people trying to break free from their  poverty and despair, they almost succeed, but it's just beyond their reach. Still, to my modern eyes, it is far better to see people trying to take charge of their future and make something of themselves than to watch All those Austen characters just waiting for a good marriage or an inheritance to lift them up from their dire situation.If you're just in it for the romance - you will not be disappointed. The love story of the two main character is also moving and worth watching. Though it's not the most original romantic plot ( He wants her, she thinks she doesn't want him, but then realizes she was wrong )  it's fun to watch because of the two wonderful actors and the great chemistry between them. Richard Armitage is brooding and handsome and just perfect for this role as a man of action who speaks little and unable to show his softer side.

883487,A1OVF0KSZZRTEV,B0007N1BBC,R. L. Cobleigh,"[4, 4]","Although this bears some resemblance to various elements of the Pride & Prejudice plot and characters, it far exceeds the themes of P&P; in terms of strength and weight. I found myself fascinated by the backdrop: the cultural transition from a predominantly agricultural economy (taken for granted in the background of Pride & Prejudice, which was set about 70 years earlier) to an industrial one. All of the old order is being upended; this change is happening faster in the north of England than in the south; there is tension between the old privileged classes and this newly-rich entrepreneurial one; women's position in society is changing because suffrage has made inroads and women go to work alongside men in the factories; the environmental upheaval is having a terrible effect on public health; the beginning of labor disputes between factory owners and the unions is going through birthing pangs, with a great deal of volatility on both sides. I was engaged by the romance, definitely, but I was fascinated by all the forces acting on the lovers, and I was caught philosophically between these two main characters, because I was given enough information to understand both of their perspectives and to see that there was no easy resolution to their conflict, because their conflict was larger than themselves. They couldn't just &#34;cut through all the crap and sort themselves out, already,&#34; because they both had excellent reasons to be doing exactly what they were doing and to continue doing it. So the real question became: could they sort themselves out at all? The gap seemed unbridgeable unless both of them gave way, at least somewhat.Unlike with Mr. Darcy and Lizzy, there was never any doubt in my mind that Mr. Thornton had fallen pretty thoroughly in love with Margaret very early on, in that doomed, &#34;Of course I'm attracted to the one person I can't have&#34; sort of way, so despite his initial status as a villain, he was simultaneously a tragic figure that I found myself rooting for. This is a powerful, riveting combination, and the force of it drew my attention so thoroughly that I found myself utterly fascinated by him. I must admit: this was not true of Mr. Darcy the first time I encountered Pride & Prejudice. Without picking up on all the character subtleties in Mr. Darcy (which Colin Firth played so skillfully that I missed most of them on first viewing but I now see them as glaringly obvious), we have no reason to believe that he cares a whit for Lizzy until he suddenly shows up almost out of nowhere with an awkward proposal that leaves you thinking, &#34;WTF?!&#34; Of course, once you know the plot and characters of Pride & Prejudice well, it's easy to read between the lines and figure out that Mr. Darcy is in the same position as Mr. Thornton (although Darcy is perhaps less of a true villain and more of just a shy, misunderstood, stiff sort of personality). Mr. Thornton, on the other hand, is plenty hot-blooded and outspoken, and his very lack of gentility is one of his strengths in the life he's made for himself. Being a self-made man, not one who's inherited a mansion and tenants and a life of leisure traipsing from one country estate to another, he's a lot harder and more pragmatic than Mr. Darcy. Although Mr. Thornton doesn't hide his feelings as much as Mr. Darcy does, the task of portraying him requires no less subtlety, and Richard Armitage is no less skillful than Firth in doing so. What Firth does is keep a lid on Darcy until we get a wild explosion that reveals just how much has been silently going on underneath. By contrast, Armitage starts Mr. Thornton off without any visible restraint and then has the similarly difficult task of convincing us that Thornton is not the vicious brute that he initially appears to be, without refuting our first glimpse of the character: in Thornton's eyes, his actions are entirely consistently throughout the story, although by the end of it we don't seem him as a villain at all.The secondary characters in North & South are stronger than those in Pride & Prejudice, I must admit. Mrs. Thornton and Nicholas Higgins stand out, and I absolutely love Mrs. Thornton: there's a strong female character for you! The only secondary characters in Pride & Prejudice that leave an impression (e.g., Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine) are all somewhat caricatured. By contrast, Mrs. Thornton and Higgins feel just as real and intelligent and reasonably motivated as the two main lovers do. These secondary characters of course serve a purpose in the plot, but they have their own rich tapestry of lives and histories and are compelling in and of themselves.The quality of the acting in North & South is easily at the same level as that in Pride & Prejudice; there is not a single off-note and there are plenty of notes that tug you towards the characters. They really did assemble a fantastic cast that had plenty of chemistry, and not just between the two leads (who have it in spades). The final scene at the train station is my all-time favorite romantic resolution scene.Well worth your time, and not just to watch it once, but to re-watch it and really think about its themes.",5,It

883492,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B0007N1BBC,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[34, 36]","Richard Armitage, who plays the enigmatic mill owner John Thornton, gives fellow Brit Colin Firth a run for his money in terms of great acting and yes, the hottness factor. Speaking of Colin Firth associations, the proposal scene is reminiscent of Darcy and Elizabeth in terms of misunderstandings and unjust, preconceived opinons.  It seems that from the moment of her refusal, Margaret is thereafter interested in and (subconsciously) attracted to this self-made man.I thought the relationship between John and his mother particularly beautiful.  Yes, Mrs. Thorton had a harsh opinion of Margaret Hale, but that was mostly out of her desire to protect her son from Margaret's romantic rejection.  Mrs. Thorton said that a mother's love will outlast every other type of love, and she believed in her son and knew he'd take care of her even after his prospects had changed.  (Fortunately, Margaret's (contrived) business proposal would get the mill up and running again.)This movie (based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel) allowed for all points of view--we saw too close for comfort the plight of the mill workers who'd soon strike: some of them lived in constant fear of starvation, while others contracted consumption because of unhealthy working conditions and died well before their time.  We also see child labor and how it was normalized at this point in time.  Yet John Thorton, our romantic hero and the proprietor of one of the three or four cotton mills in Milton, is not without compassion or principles.  However, the interests and perspectives of the mill owners and workers were at cross-purposes. Mr. Thorton and the other mill owners discussed concerns about the impending strike, whether they should seek cheaper suppliers outside of England, and whether they should recruit Irish workers to fill in for the strikers.  Margaret's dad, a displaced parson (he had qualms about the mandatory role of the Book of Common Prayer in the Anglican Church) offered spiritual advice to the mill owners, but I don't think his well-intentioned interjections were much heeded. However, he observed that when he heard reasoned arguments from both sides of the dilemna, he could understand both points of view, and therefore, he recommended that both parties (mill owners and striking workers) have open dialogues.Mr. Thorton became Rev. Hale's pupil, and the two of them tackled Plato and other monumental works.  Mr. Thorton's education was interrupted when he was forced to leave school at 16 and take care of his mother and younger sister while repaying his deceased father's debts from speculation.The role of Fanny, John's younger sister, seemed one-dimensional and stereotypical.  She seemed to have forgotten that she and her family were impoverished not too long ago b/f her brother's Horatio Alger rags-to-riches turnaround. The mother was far more connected to the family's source of income and purposely lived close to her son's mill and even supervised some of the workers.  She was beaming with pride over her son's accomplishments, yet she forgot how to see from the layman's perspective.Elizabeth Gaskell wrote with a great social conscience. Yet she also wrote with a great romantic imagination. That two people who seem so different would come to fall in love and be willing to revise their faulty perceptions and grow and change is sight for sore eyes.  My favorite scene from this movie is the last scene at the train station where John and Margaret ""publicly display their affections"" (a bit risque for the Victorian era) after Margaret nervously proposed her ""business plan"" to save the mill. I don't think John's thoughts could have been further from the mill as he kissed and embraced Margaret. (I confess to having been more than a little jealous of Daniela Denby-Ashe during this scene! :-)The music was ""specially composed by Martin Phipps,"" yet I think I recognize some of Mahler's symphonic music in the movie.  As a Mahler fan, the music makes the movie even more beautiful.",5,So beautiful!

883493,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B0007N1BBC,Scott FS,"[2, 2]","The words of the title for my review are uttered by Margaret Hale, the heroine of the lush BBC miniseries, North and South, when she described the cotton factories in the fictional town of Milton, in the industrial north of England. The South in the title refers to the prosperous and more 'refined' south of England, including London.There are 454 reviews of this wonderful miniseries as I write this.  I'm sure somewhere in those 454 reviews, there is at least one or two synopses of the plot.  So I won't go over well-trod soil.  But I will comment on the acting, the cinematography, and the art direction.The acting is superb.  Richard Armitage plays John Thornton, the owner of one of the vast, busy, and almost inhumane cotton mills in Milton.  Armitage has a extensive background as an actor, primarily in British television, most notably 'MI-5'.  Daniela Denby-Ashe plays the aforementioned Ms. Hale.  She's a capable actress, and lends a solid presence to the role.  Also notable is Hale's father, the disillusioned preacher who leaves the Church of England on a matter of conscience, played by veteran actor Tim Pigott-Smith (Robert Merrick in the excellent 'The Jewel in the Crown).The cinematography is second-to-none.  It captures the grime of the city, the bleak working and living places of the masses (and that is an apt word to describe how those unfortunate souls are treated), and the fine clumps of cotton that float ever-present through the factories.  (The 'snow white of hell' that Hale describes at the end of the first episode.)  The art direction is also excellent.  It's just as you'd imagine a Dickens city to be.This is a superior effort, with lots of money to back it up.  Milton does look like an Earthly version of Hades, with the exploitation of workers, extreme poverty and widespread child labor.  It's also a very interesting look at English history, lightly covered in other films, regarding the fantastic changes in the lives of the English as the industrial revolution took full hold. These are issues that Charles Dickens would tackle in many of his own works around the same time as the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, upon whose novel this miniseries is based.It's hard to believe that the life portrayed in Austen's novels is only a couple of decades prior to this gritty work.Very Highly recommended.  This is the type of work you look forward to watching, and sad when it ends.  It's a winning effort, and I give it a full five stars.  I look forward to watching it again.

883502,AI0KXH1O95X0H,B0007N1BBC,"Sir Robert ""Order of the Anglophiles""","[26, 28]","I give high recommendation for you readers to see this exceptional production of BBC, based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell. I have a number of BBC productions here, but this one is remarkable and quite different.To begin, this four-episode film has a darker shade than the rest of them; for good reasons, too, since the story is set in the industrial town of Milton in northern England, sometime during the mid 1800's, if I'm not mistaken. As one of the characters puts it: ""a God-forsaken place where people breathe smoke and eat money!"" Pollution, death and class distinction between workers and their masters are much evidently played out here. Even the message about unions and strikes are unashamedly laid out on the table. BBC's renditions of ""David Copperfield"" and ""Our Mutual Friend"" were never this dark, brooding and straightforward.Another merit this film has is its fiery intensity and passion. Just the scene where Margaret rejects Mr. Thornton is proof enough. People may say that this scene is just another ""Pride and Prejudice"" in another packaging, but still Director Brian Percival did a very good job of distinguishing this one from the former, even topping it out, as many testimonials in Amazon.UK and here will point out.Many reviewers will say that this and that character steals the screen, but in my point of view, they are all scene stealers. The performances are top-rate, especially by the two mothers, who seem to symbolize opposite ends of disposition to me. I love both of them. Just watch as the soft-spoken Mrs. Hale (Lesley Manville) scold her husband for dragging them into ""this God-forsaken place!"" Watch, too, for the scene where tough Mrs. Thornton (Sinead Cusack,) in a surprising turn, counsels her son to pursue Miss Hale. As for the two younger leads, they are marked for their likability and attractiveness. Miss Denby-Ashe is simply beautiful as Margaret Hale, our sweet-natured but surprisingly head-strong female protagonist. Her belief in other people's good is what won me over. As for the uncommonly handsome Mr. Armitage, well, I read a review at Amazon.UK where the reviewer commented that she ovulated everytime the guy popped into the screen. Now although it is impossible for me to ovulate, I can at least give weight to her praises. I don't ever recall seeing such a strong male screen presence before. This may be the reason why the ""rejection scene"" was pulled off perfectly.Hey, isn't that the adorable Pegotty (Pauline Quirke) from ""David Copperfield"" in another role as household servant?I do admit that this production has at least one misfire: the ending was a bit maple-syrupy. After all the fiery intensity the movie went through, the ending seems a bit out of place. Mr. Thornton became quiet and subdued and happy all of a sudden, after much scowling and smouldering throughtout. I wondered whether Margaret doubted his intentions since she had come into a considerable fortune. But ladies, I don't believe any of you will care about what I just said here. All you will care about is Richard Armitage, and Richard Armitage alone, plus his kiss!! And guys, isn't Daniela Denby-Ashe simply adorable? So who cares about that tiny misfire, right? And anyway, Margaret could not have had thoughts of doubt regarding Mr. Thornton's character, since it was she who believed in him first and foremost.All in all, the production values are exemplary, the performances top-notch. The electricity and romance are to die for. E. Gaskell's message is truthful enough, I just wished that the world we live in nowadays could solve its problems by simply understanding the other side, and dialogue. This film teaches something about giving way to others.Finally, special mention to the magnificent score by Martin Phipps. Here, I wish to gain the attention of BBC: kudos for including ""Deleted Scenes"" into the Special Features. But it would have been more interesting if you didn't dispose of ""The Making Of..."" and ""The Music Of..."" that were normally mainstays of your DVDs. These are things I have come to love in a BBC DVD. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who share my views on this matter.A note to would-be viewers: one particular death scene (there are four in all!!) might disturb younger viewers.",5,Another Winning Adaptation From Elizabeth Gaskell's Novel,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,4274,"['give', 'high', 'recommendation', 'readers', 'see', 'exceptional', 'production', 'BBC', 'based', 'novel', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'have', 'number', 'BBC', 'productions', 'here', 'one', 'remarkable', 'quite', 'different.To', 'begin', 'four-episode', 'film', 'darker', 'shade', 'rest', 'good', 'reasons', 'too', 'story', 'set', 'industrial', 'town', 'Milton', 'northern', 'England', 'sometime', 'mid', '1800', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'one', 'characters', 'God-forsaken', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'breathe', 'smoke', 'eat', 'money', 'Pollution', 'death', 'class', 'distinction', 'workers', 'masters', 'are', 'much', 'evidently', 'played', 'out', 'here', 'Even', 'message', 'unions', 'strikes', 'are', 'unashamedly', 'laid', 'out', 'table', 'BBC', 'renditions', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'Mutual', 'Friend', 'were', 'never', 'dark', 'brooding', 'straightforward.Another', 'merit', 'film', 'fiery', 'intensity', 'passion', 'Just', 'scene', 'where', 'Margaret', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'proof', 'enough', 'People', 'may', 'say', 'scene', 'just', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'packaging', 'still', 'Director', 'Brian', 'Percival', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'distinguishing', 'one', 'former', 'even', 'topping', 'out', 'many', 'testimonials', 'Amazon.UK', 'here', 'will', 'point', 'out.Many', 'reviewers', 'will', 'say', 'character', 'screen', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'scene', 'stealers', 'performances', 'are', 'top-rate', 'especially', 'two', 'mothers', 'who', 'seem', 'symbolize', 'opposite', 'ends', 'disposition', 'love', 'Just', 'watch', 'soft-spoken', 'Mrs.', 'Hale', 'Lesley', 'Manville', 'scold', 'husband', 'dragging', 'God-forsaken', 'place', 'Watch', 'too', 'scene', 'where', 'tough', 'Mrs.', 'Thornton', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'surprising', 'turn', 'son', 'pursue', 'Miss', 'Hale', 'two', 'younger', 'leads', 'are', 'marked', 'likability', 'attractiveness', 'Miss', 'Denby-Ashe', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'sweet-natured', 'surprisingly', 'head-strong', 'female', 'protagonist', 'belief', 'other', 'people', 'good', 'what', 'won', 'over', 'uncommonly', 'handsome', 'Mr.', 'Armitage', 'well', 'read', 'review', 'Amazon.UK', 'where', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'ovulated', 'everytime', 'guy', 'popped', 'screen', 'Now', 'impossible', 'ovulate', 'can', 'least', 'give', 'weight', 'praises', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'recall', 'seeing', 'such', 'strong', 'male', 'screen', 'presence', 'before', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'rejection', 'scene', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'perfectly.Hey', ""n't"", 'adorable', 'Pegotty', 'Pauline', 'Quirke', 'David', 'Copperfield', 'role', 'household', 'servant', 'do', 'admit', 'production', 'least', 'one', 'misfire', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'maple-syrupy', 'fiery', 'intensity', 'movie', 'went', 'ending', 'bit', 'place', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'became', 'quiet', 'subdued', 'happy', 'sudden', 'much', 'scowling', 'smouldering', 'throughtout', 'wondered', 'Margaret', 'doubted', 'intentions', 'had', 'come', 'considerable', 'fortune', 'ladies', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'will', 'care', 'what', 'just', 'said', 'here', 'will', 'care', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'alone', 'kiss', 'guys', ""n't"", 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'simply', 'adorable', 'So', 'who', 'tiny', 'misfire', 'right', 'anyway', 'Margaret', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'thoughts', 'doubt', 'regarding', 'Mr.', 'Thornton', 'character', 'was', 'who', 'believed', 'first', 'foremost.All', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'exemplary', 'performances', 'top-notch', 'electricity', 'romance', 'are', 'die', 'E.', 'Gaskell', 'message', 'truthful', 'enough', 'just', 'wished', 'world', 'live', 'nowadays', 'could', 'solve', 'problems', 'simply', 'understanding', 'other', 'side', 'dialogue', 'film', 'something', 'giving', 'way', 'others.Finally', 'special', 'mention', 'magnificent', 'score', 'Martin', 'Phipps', 'Here', 'wish', 'gain', 'attention', 'BBC', 'kudos', 'including', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Special', 'Features', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'dispose', 'Making', 'Music', 'were', 'normally', 'mainstays', 'DVDs', 'are', 'things', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'BBC', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'share', 'views', 'matter.A', 'note', 'would-be', 'viewers', 'one', 'particular', 'death', 'scene', 'are', 'four', 'might', 'disturb', 'younger', 'viewers']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

In the last 15 years, the BBC has produced quite a few such dramas, many of which are excellent.  Even among these, North & South is thoroughly outstanding.The character development is wonderful and truly satisfying, a rarity indeed.  We see the characters portrayed as humans and rejoice as we see them change, grow, and adapt their worldviews via these experiences.  Most all of the characters, certainly the main ones, are shown as complex individuals of depth with both good and bad qualities including kindness, love, loyalty, service to others, prejudices, anger, and mistrust.There is a wonderful lack of bias in the storytelling.  Although there are multiple conflicts presented, the filmmakers do not tell us how to think about any of it.  The film manages to completely avoid a simplistic good vs bad paradigm.  Instead, the portrayal is much more real.  Just when it seems Thornton will be characterized as a rich, evil businessman who would do anything for profit, you see his devotion to his mother and his efforts to treat his workers fairly in a highly competitive industry and often unforgiving world.  Just when it appears the union workers will be portrayed as saints, we see Margaret pointedly challenging the union leaders on their tactics and behavior.  There are many moments of unexpected dialogue which alter the perceptions of both the characters and the viewer.  It creates a brilliant examination of the issues which yields complexity and depth rarely found in any film.I only wish they would release this on Blu-Ray.",5,A True Masterpiece of Art,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,1636,"['wife', 'are', 'fans', 'English', 'period', 'dramas', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'last', '15', 'years', 'BBC', 'produced', 'quite', 'few', 'such', 'dramas', 'many', 'are', 'excellent', 'Even', 'North', 'South', 'thoroughly', 'outstanding.The', 'character', 'development', 'wonderful', 'truly', 'satisfying', 'rarity', 'indeed', 'see', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'humans', 'rejoice', 'see', 'change', 'grow', 'adapt', 'worldviews', 'experiences', 'Most', 'characters', 'certainly', 'main', 'ones', 'are', 'shown', 'complex', 'individuals', 'depth', 'good', 'bad', 'qualities', 'including', 'kindness', 'love', 'loyalty', 'service', 'others', 'prejudices', 'anger', 'mistrust.There', 'wonderful', 'lack', 'bias', 'storytelling', 'are', 'multiple', 'conflicts', 'presented', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'think', 'film', 'completely', 'avoid', 'simplistic', 'good', 'vs', 'bad', 'paradigm', 'Instead', 'portrayal', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'Just', 'when', 'Thornton', 'will', 'be', 'characterized', 'rich', 'evil', 'businessman', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'profit', 'see', 'devotion', 'mother', 'efforts', 'treat', 'workers', 'fairly', 'highly', 'competitive', 'industry', 'often', 'unforgiving', 'world', 'Just', 'when', 'union', 'workers', 'will', 'be', 'portrayed', 'saints', 'see', 'Margaret', 'pointedly', 'challenging', 'union', 'leaders', 'tactics', 'behavior', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'unexpected', 'dialogue', 'alter', 'perceptions', 'characters', 'viewer', 'brilliant', 'examination', 'issues', 'yields', 'complexity', 'depth', 'rarely', 'found', 'film.I', 'only', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'Blu-Ray']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

There she meets John Thornton (Richard Armitage) the owner of a cotton mill struggling with labor problems. When Margaret meets John she immediately takes a dislike to him because he is in the process of brutally dismissing a worker who is smoking in his factory. Unaware of his motives-he's concerned about the factory burning and killing his employees-she marks him as dark and brutish. John begins taking lessons from Margaret's father and slowly develops a crush on her. He proposes marriage, she refuses. She overcomes her prejudices against John after learning more about him, but he succumbs to gossip about her and convinces himself he no longer loves her. And so the back and forth of missed connections continues through five titillating episodes of will they or won't they. Will they overcome their pride and confess their affection? Will they listen to gossip or follow their heart? Will Margaret learn to love Milton and come to understand John's values? The romantic push and pull is played out most interestingly against the backdrop of turn of the century labor struggles in England.Anyone intrigued with the type of romantic chemistry found in movies likeWhen Harry Met SallyandPride and Prejudice (Penguin Classics)will be head over heels in love with North and South. Two sworn enemies begin brewing with passion and affection for eachother...it's the most satisfying sort of girl porn. John Milton is played most passionately and affectionately by Richard Armitage. Dark, brooding, but decisive and oh so sexy...he's the perfect hero of this romantic masterpiece. I don't usually like dark haired men, but he's butter. Delightful.If you like the romantic element of this series, I'd highly recommend the BBC production ofPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996). If you end up liking the BBC production, I'd also recommendHouse of Cards Trilogy (House of Cards / To Play the King / The Final Cut).

Millhorn,"[7, 8]","North and South co-mingle the beauty, elegance and virtue of one part of England's past, with the cruel reality of it's industrial other side. On the one hand you have the godly, chaste and beautiful Miss Margaret Hale, and on the other, the beast, in the person of John Thornton. I love the display of reality that was present during the cruel days of Englands inner city life, with the hardships of life in it's poverty stricken areas. But I also relished in the beauty, the scenery and manners of the middle and upper classes, where civility reigned. The only reason I couldn't give this excellent film a 5 star rating was because it was a little long, it was a little too focused on the harshness of the Mill and their workers. The love story and juicy parts came towards the middle and end of the film, where you know the beauty and the beast just had to break their respective independent hard shells, and start falling for each other. I also liked the fact that the Parson of the story was not presented in a negative light, but just as another bloke that was struggling to make ends meet. The female character of North and South Miss Margaret Hale, occasionally showed the cracks of her humanity but overall, she was articulate, beautiful, chaste, and very lady like. The character of John Thornton was steely, hard, and at times mean. But once you get to the point of discovering why he was that way, and what he had to go through to pick himself up by his bootstraps, your opinion of him will gradually change.

883512,A3QGPFUH2D4S4S,B0007N1BBC,S. Tucker,"[24, 25]","For those of us with an unashamed weakness for good period dramas, the BBC's NORTH AND SOUTH satisfies on several levels, despite it's gloomy industrial leitmotif.  Since it is based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, we know that it will be more genteel than the Brontes, yet still pack a Romantic, but Victorian, wallop.  It's beautifully done cinematically: the physical contrast between Northern and Southern England is stark---the former, has skies that are, cold, gray, and constantly on the verge of storm.  It is home to cotton mills whose interiors are prey to the the whirling snow of cotton fibers.  Our window into the South tends toward green fields needing mowing, yellow primroses or time in a London townhouse with a ""bell jar"" atmosphere.N & S has engaging characters we admire and come close to detesting at the same time.  Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) comes to Milton, a Northern factory town, with her father, a former vicar, who has given up his parish on a point of conscience and her mother, an invalid with an over-protective servant in tow.  Margaret casts a wary eye on life as it is lived in Milton because these rough-tongued Northerners upset her ideas of everthing from good manners to independent women.  The foremost villan of her North is John Thornton (Richard Arimtage), a factory owner who beats a factory-worker under her nose at her first meeting with him.  A close runner-up is Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle), an idealistic labour leader whose rough honesty and wary hospitality humanizes him in our eyes from the start.What the story-line lacks in originality is made up tenfold by the fine performances of the cast previously mentioned and other notable performance by Sinead Cusack as Thornton's cold, wary, bristling mother and Anna Maxwell Mantin's turn as the aggressively air-headed daughter of the Thornton house.This four part (two disc) set will be something I'll view again and again in the future because it is satisfying on so many levels---the music is powerful, the political theory is irrefutable, and I defy the viewer not to be deeply moved by the last scenes in a train station.

883516,A3R5AFKW4FP0U5,B0007N1BBC,SusieQ,"[76, 102]","I haven't read Mrs. Gaskell's book, so I was able to watch this DVD with no reader's pre-conception about how the story was adapted and/or the changes to its plot.  I was willing to enjoy what I hoped, from everything I'd heard and read about it, was a typical high-quality British TV production.And there are qualities about this production that I did enjoy, very much.  Tim Piggott-Smith's performance as Rev. Hale; Sinead Cusack's performance as Hannah Thornton (where has this actress been? one never sees her enough and she's so good), and Richard Armitage as John Thornton, are excellent.  The attention paid to the Victorian-era details - the costumes; the household furnishings; the contrast between the damp and gloomy northern mill town as opposed to the flowering southern vicarage where the Hales come from.  And I loved the soundtrack - what perfectly suited-to-this-story music.But, I had some problems with casting choices, the first one (relatively minor) being the actor who played Paul Hale.  With his shaggy hair falling into his eyes and certain mannerisms, this actor struck me as a bit too 21st century to be playing a young man of the 19th century.  More seriously the biggest problem I had was the performance of Daniela Denby-Ashe as Margaret.  I still don't quite know if it was the actress playing her, or the character of Margaret as written, or a combination of both factors, but by the second episode and as the story continued, I was experiencing an increasingly negative feeling toward her.  Certainly the actress's nearly-chipmunk cheeked, pudding face with its pink-lidded eyes and usually vacant expression and blank stares (only ever fully awake during exchanges or arguments with Thornton), gradually began annoying the heck out of me.  I admit that by the last episode, I would have hoped Margaret and John didn't reconcile, if only one couldn't see it coming a mile away... All my sympathies at that point were with Mrs. Thornton, especially when she criticized Margaret to John Thornton.  I felt exactly the same way.Thus, unfortunately, the very romantic ending to the series, at the train station, didn't find favor with me, the way it seems to have affected so many other female viewers.  That last glimpse of Margaret's face, turned away from John to look out the train window, was the last straw.  Turned away to look out the window, from the man who's just pledged his undying love for her!  Why would a director choose this ending?  The only thing that saved that scene, for me, was the music welling up in the background.If I were to purchase anything regarding this production (the DVD was a library loan) it will be the soundtrack, if it's available.  I did enjoy the production for the majority of the performances and for its attention to detail, but because I just didn't have the overwhelmingly positive reaction that most viewers seem to have had for Richard Armitage/Daniela Denby-Ashe's so-called chemistry, I personally can't speak to fully enjoying this adaptation.  Obviously many viewers felt much differently!****This is my third, and last, attempt to leave a review of this particular television mini-series.  I would appreciate if certain of the 370+ positive reviewers of this DVD, some of whom left borderline hostile/rude comments which unfortunately got deleted (and no, this was not my intention), and who thought this series was a five-star-or-even-more, utterly wonderful and fantastic viewing experience, would take into account that my review actually was not written to thoughtlessly ""bash"" this TV miniseries.  I've stated one major problem I had with it which affected MY total enjoyment of the production.  I agree 100% that any other viewer of ""North and South"" might think Daniela Denby-Ashe is fabulous as Margaret, but I, personally, didn't find her performance that great.  There are a few reviews on Amazon.co.uk that concur with my opinion about her performance.Thanks.",3,Third time lucky?,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,3953,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Mrs.', 'Gaskell', 'book', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'DVD', 'reader', 'pre-conception', 'how', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'changes', 'plot', 'was', 'willing', 'enjoy', 'what', 'hoped', 'everything', ""'d"", 'heard', 'read', 'was', 'typical', 'high-quality', 'British', 'TV', 'production.And', 'are', 'qualities', 'production', 'did', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'Tim', 'Piggott-Smith', 'performance', 'Rev', 'Hale', 'Sinead', 'Cusack', 'performance', 'Hannah', 'Thornton', 'where', 'actress', 'been', 'one', 'never', 'enough', 'so', 'good', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'John', 'Thornton', 'are', 'excellent', 'attention', 'paid', 'Victorian-era', 'details', 'costumes', 'household', 'furnishings', 'contrast', 'damp', 'gloomy', 'northern', 'mill', 'town', 'opposed', 'flowering', 'southern', 'vicarage', 'where', 'Hales', 'come', 'loved', 'soundtrack', 'what', 'perfectly', 'suited-to-this-story', 'music.But', 'had', 'problems', 'casting', 'choices', 'first', 'one', 'relatively', 'minor', 'being', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Paul', 'Hale', 'shaggy', 'hair', 'falling', 'eyes', 'certain', 'mannerisms', 'actor', 'struck', 'bit', 'too', '21st', 'century', 'be', 'playing', 'young', 'man', '19th', 'century', 'More', 'seriously', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'performance', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'Margaret', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'was', 'actress', 'playing', 'character', 'Margaret', 'written', 'combination', 'factors', 'second', 'episode', 'story', 'continued', 'was', 'experiencing', 'increasingly', 'negative', 'feeling', 'Certainly', 'actress', 'nearly-chipmunk', 'cheeked', 'pudding', 'face', 'pink-lidded', 'eyes', 'usually', 'vacant', 'expression', 'blank', 'stares', 'only', 'ever', 'fully', 'awake', 'exchanges', 'arguments', 'Thornton', 'gradually', 'began', 'annoying', 'heck', 'admit', 'last', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'Margaret', 'John', 'did', ""n't"", 'reconcile', 'only', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'sympathies', 'point', 'were', 'Mrs.', 'Thornton', 'especially', 'when', 'criticized', 'Margaret', 'John', 'Thornton', 'felt', 'exactly', 'same', 'way.Thus', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'romantic', 'ending', 'series', 'train', 'station', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'favor', 'way', 'have', 'affected', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'female', 'viewers', 'last', 'glimpse', 'Margaret', 'face', 'turned', 'away', 'John', 'look', 'out', 'train', 'window', 'was', 'last', 'straw', 'Turned', 'away', 'look', 'out', 'window', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'pledged', 'undying', 'love', 'Why', 'would', 'director', 'choose', 'ending', 'only', 'thing', 'saved', 'scene', 'was', 'music', 'welling', 'up', 'background.If', 'were', 'purchase', 'anything', 'regarding', 'production', 'DVD', 'was', 'library', 'loan', 'will', 'be', 'soundtrack', 'available', 'did', 'enjoy', 'production', 'majority', 'performances', 'attention', 'detail', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reaction', 'most', 'viewers', 'seem', 'have', 'had', 'Richard', 'Armitage/Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'so-called', 'chemistry', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'fully', 'enjoying', 'adaptation', 'Obviously', 'many', 'viewers', 'felt', 'much', 'differently', '****This', 'third', 'last', 'attempt', 'leave', 'review', 'particular', 'television', 'mini-series', 'would', 'appreciate', 'certain', '370+', 'positive', 'reviewers', 'DVD', 'whom', 'left', 'borderline', 'hostile/rude', 'comments', 'unfortunately', 'got', 'deleted', 'was', 'not', 'intention', 'who', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'five-star-or-even-more', 'utterly', 'wonderful', 'fantastic', 'viewing', 'experience', 'would', 'take', 'account', 'review', 'actually', 'was', 'not', 'written', 'thoughtlessly', 'bash', 'TV', 'miniseries', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'had', 'affected', 'MY', 'total', 'enjoyment', 'production', 'agree', '100', '%', 'other', 'viewer', 'North', 'South', 'might', 'think', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'fabulous', 'Margaret', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'performance', 'great', 'are', 'few', 'reviews', 'Amazon.co.uk', 'concur', 'opinion', 'performance.Thanks']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

883526,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B0007N1BBC,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[169, 178]","With his sharp, hawklike features and piercing eyes, Richard Armitage (Cold Feet ser. 5), gives a breathtaking perfomance in what is doubtless to become his signature role as the stern, powerful, proud cotton-mill owner, John Thornton, in this splendid four-part 2004 adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's turbulent 1855 novel, North & South.Margaret Hale is a beautiful young woman who has been a part of London society and who ""hales"" from an Edenic village in the South of England--a part of the world where life moves at a slower pace, untainted by the filth, over-crowding, anonymity, and abject poverty which was a by-product of the industrial revolution in the North.  Her life is turned upside down, however, when her father, a local vicar, suffers a crisis of faith which results in him leaving the church and uprooting his family to the dreary, smoky, northern industrial town of Milton where he hopes to eke out a living as a tutor.Margaret is disgusted by all she sees in this new, foreign place which is unlike anything she has ever known.  She lays the fault for the appalling social conditions at the feet of the industrialists--the ""masters""--towards whom she betrays an almost instant prejudice.  The industrialist who bears the brunt of Margaret's antagonism and criticism is John Thornton, a pupil and friend of her father's.The central story revolves around the antagonistic relationship between these two characters, and it is hard not to make comparisons with Austen's Pride & Prejudice.  Though he's a hard-working industrialist rather than an idle, landed gentleman, Thornton is very similar to Darcy, as much for his serious, stern, brooding nature as for his integrity and strength of character.  Also like Darcy, he falls desperately in love--despite himself--with a strong-willed, proud, outspoken, intelligent young woman who spurns his love and sends him off with his tail between his legs.  Like the aloof, prejudiced Elizabeth Bennet, it is only after spurning her would-be lover that Margaret Hale comes to realize just what sort of man she has rejected.  That said, I will say no more regarding their relationship, as I don't wish to spoil the story for those unfamiliar.North & South also deals with the working and living conditions of the mill workers and with the labour unions of the time.  We see the union from the perspective of both the masters and the workers, but we also see tension within the ranks of the workers.  Solidarity is the foundation upon which the union gets its strength, but we are forced to question the justification of the union's tyrannical enforcement of it when we see cruel harships befall certain individuals as a result.Dvd extras include deleted scenes and an interesting 15-minute interview with Richard Armitage.  Text-based extras include interesting production notes and ""bios"" of 5 of the main actors, which consist of little in the way of biography and are mostly comments about themselves and their roles!  There is also a commentary on episodes 1 & 4.North & South is a powerful, passionate, beautiful story (not to mention rivetting--I initially watched it on television, and rarely have I seen a show in which it was SO hard to wait for the next episode).  The acting is flawless and the production values unsurpassed, which result in a visually stunning, rich, dynamic presentation.  I have no hesitation in saying that this is one of the best dramas (period or otherwise) produced by the BBC in a very long time.  It will be a special treat for anyone with a penchant for period productions; as for those who enjoyed 1995's Pride & Prejudice, it is absolutely a must see!

This review contains no spoilers.  FANTASTIC, so poignant, romantic, both heroine and hero WONDERFUL and complex (I originally watched it for free on Prime and immediately ordered the DVD).  It's not frothy, no comedy of manners, it's a drama, slower-moving but portent with meaning, existential, life or death issues, the tension between values in southern and northern England, and those of the moneyed vs the working class.  Also about the love within families, between friends, within our human family, just wonderful.I loved it SO much I downloaded the kindle version of the book (published 1854) by Elizabeth Gaskell, which, although very different, I also adored.  Sort of like Jane Austen (less scathing wit, more vision and heart) plus the Industrial Revolution and a social conscience (and intimacy, must've raised a few eyebrows in its day).  SO romantic- ""every age is the same, it's only love that makes ANY of them bearable..."" (to borrow a line from Malcolm McDowell inTime After Time).I also downloaded the evocative, haunting musical theme (link below).  The cinematography is stunning, atmospheric, every shot portent with meaning and beauty, punctuated perfectly by the exquisite music.  I bought the DVD as well, had to have it.  Brendan Coyle (Downton Abbey, Lark Rise to Candleford, etc), a favorite actor, has a prominent role as a union leader.

Daniella Denby Ashe's performance as Margaret Hale was wonderful, as was Richard Armitage's as John Thornton. This is one of those films you reach for when in need of comfort. I generally watch a lot of horror and thrillers, but this one is like a favorite blanket when I need stillness in my life, but want to watch a movie. It's quiet, soft and gentle in its richness, wrapping itself around you and making you care about all of the characters. It's a brief look at the socio-economic climate of the period through the eyes of the main characters who transform through to meet a new world--and each other. It's really a very lovely story well told.",5,I love this film--and not just because I'm having an imaginary relationship with Richard Armitage,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,738,"['Beautifully', 'written', 'set', 'performed', 'great', 'film', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'Daniella', 'Denby', 'Ashe', 'performance', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'was', 'wonderful', 'was', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'John', 'Thornton', 'one', 'films', 'reach', 'when', 'need', 'comfort', 'generally', 'watch', 'lot', 'horror', 'thrillers', 'one', 'favorite', 'blanket', 'when', 'need', 'stillness', 'life', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'quiet', 'soft', 'gentle', 'richness', 'wrapping', 'making', 'care', 'characters', 'brief', 'look', 'socio-economic', 'climate', 'period', 'eyes', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'transform', 'meet', 'new', 'world', 'other', 'really', 'very', 'lovely', 'story', 'well', 'told']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

I immediately checked with Amazon.com and saw all these glowing reports to substantiate what I had just witnessed...What is likely the best miniseries I have ever watched.From the opening scene, through the turmoil of the classes that was the industrial north of that period...to love and loathing between John Thornton and Margaret Hale. The story intertwines the classes and draws you in. It is so hauntingly beautiful and I challenge you to turn off the DVD player after episode 1. Personally, I've watched my DVD to many times to count and always watch the whole series in one sitting.The locations and costumes are expertly recreated, the music is haunting and beautiful and will resonant in your mind for hours after you have finished viewing, but the characters will live with you forever...especially John Thorton and his love for Margaret.The acting was brilliant. I'd not heard of Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe prior to seeing them portraying the lead parts but Richard Armitage has snatched my love and affection for Mr. Darcy and made me fall utterly and devotedly in love with his Mr. Thornton.This DVD is a treasure that you will keep returning to time and time again.",5,Hauntingly Beautiful,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,1307,"['first', 'stumbled', 'North', 'South', 'when', 'BBC', 'America', 'did', 'North', 'South', 'marathon', 'one', 'Saturday', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'immediately', 'checked', 'Amazon.com', 'saw', 'glowing', 'reports', 'substantiate', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'witnessed', 'What', 'likely', 'best', 'miniseries', 'have', 'ever', 'opening', 'scene', 'turmoil', 'classes', 'was', 'industrial', 'north', 'period', 'love', 'loathing', 'John', 'Thornton', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'story', 'classes', 'so', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'challenge', 'turn', 'off', 'DVD', 'player', 'episode', '1', 'Personally', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'DVD', 'many', 'times', 'count', 'always', 'watch', 'whole', 'series', 'one', 'sitting.The', 'locations', 'costumes', 'are', 'expertly', 'recreated', 'music', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'will', 'resonant', 'mind', 'hours', 'have', 'finished', 'viewing', 'characters', 'will', 'live', 'forever', 'especially', 'John', 'Thorton', 'love', 'Margaret.The', 'acting', 'was', 'brilliant', ""'d"", 'not', 'heard', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'prior', 'seeing', 'portraying', 'lead', 'parts', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'snatched', 'love', 'affection', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'made', 'fall', 'utterly', 'devotedly', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Thornton.This', 'DVD', 'treasure', 'will', 'keep', 'returning', 'time', 'time', 'again']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"

883537,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0007N1BBC,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","This 2004 BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's ""North and South"" now ranks as one of my all-time favorite period dramas, up there with 1995'sPride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)andCranford: The Collection (Cranford / Return to Cranford), among others. Interesting to note that all three BBC adaptations of Gaskell's works, i.e.Wives and Daughters, as well as ""Cranford"" and ""North and South"" are all stellar productions. Being a great fan of British period dramas, I am surprised it took me this long to discover ""North and South"".The story of ""North and South"" is both a love story as well as a story of class and industrialization. Margaret Hale (portrayed by the beautiful Daniela Denby-Ashe) is the lovely daughter of a clergyman, Richard (Tim Piggot-Smith) and his wife, Maria (Lesley Manville who also played Mrs. Rose in ""Cranford""). When her father breaks with the church over an issue of conscience, Margaret is forced to uproot from the idyllic southern town of Halston in Hampshire and move to the industrial town of Milton in Northern England. There the Hale family try to adjust - father Richard finds a job as a tutor and teacher, but mother Maria and Margaret find it more difficult to come to terms with the customs of the Northerners who seem a much coarser lot than the genteel Southerners. Plain speaking and independent-minded Margaret chafes at the strictures placed upon her sex and also comes to learn about the inequalities between the working classes and the mill owners.This sets the stage for the clash between John Thornton (Richard Armitage in a magnificent performance), owner of a cotton mill and Margaret, whose first impression of Thornton is of a cruel and insensitive man who treats his employees abysmally. Sparks soon fly between the two though it is Thornton who feels the initial strong attraction to Margaret. Margaret is too overcome by her first impressions to really feel much for Thornton, and her developing friendship with a young mill worker and her father, Nicholas (played by pre-Downton Abbey's Brendan Coyle) further fractures the fragile relationship between Thornton and Margaret (Thornton becomes Richard's pupil, studying the classics and the two men form an affectionate friendship, despite Margaret's animosity towards Thornton). When Nicholas becomes a union leader, calling for a strike at all the cotton mills to fight for a raise and better working conditions, Thornton and Margaret clash even more.Richard Armitage's performance as the brooding, proud cotton mill owner John Thornton reminded me of both Mr. Darcy ofPride and Prejudiceand Mr. Edward Rochester ofJane Eyre (Signet Classics). Armitage delivers a credible and magnetic performance and the natural chemistry between Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe makes for riveting viewing! I could not take my eyes off the screen, especially when these two were engaged in heated conversation.There's so many layers to this wonderfully-written production. There's romance, family tensions, class and gender issues, and many more. All of these are masterfully weaved into a production that not only looks beautiful (with a haunting score to boot) but also flows seamlessly. I watched all four episodes (Prime members get free streaming) in one sitting and plan to re-watch it again. There's much to savor here, and the love/hate relationship between Thornton and Margaret Hale anchors the story, making for a compelling and engaging viewing experience. This is truly a wonderful production and I am purchasing the DVD to add to my period drama collection.",5,A most beautiful adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel with stellar casting,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,3568,"['2004', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'North', 'South', 'now', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'period', 'dramas', 'up', 'there', ""1995'sPride"", 'Prejudice', 'Restored', 'Edition', 'andCranford', 'Collection', 'Cranford', '/', 'Return', 'Cranford', 'others', 'Interesting', 'note', 'three', 'BBC', 'adaptations', 'Gaskell', 'works', 'i.e.Wives', 'Daughters', 'as', 'well', 'Cranford', 'North', 'South', 'are', 'stellar', 'productions', 'Being', 'great', 'fan', 'British', 'period', 'dramas', 'am', 'surprised', 'took', 'long', 'discover', 'North', 'South', '.The', 'story', 'North', 'South', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'class', 'industrialization', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'portrayed', 'beautiful', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'clergyman', 'Richard', 'Tim', 'Piggot-Smith', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Lesley', 'Manville', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'Mrs.', 'Rose', 'Cranford', 'When', 'father', 'breaks', 'church', 'issue', 'conscience', 'Margaret', 'forced', 'uproot', 'idyllic', 'southern', 'town', 'Halston', 'Hampshire', 'move', 'industrial', 'town', 'Milton', 'Northern', 'England', 'Hale', 'family', 'try', 'adjust', 'father', 'Richard', 'job', 'tutor', 'teacher', 'Maria', 'Margaret', 'find', 'more', 'difficult', 'come', 'terms', 'customs', 'Northerners', 'who', 'seem', 'much', 'coarser', 'lot', 'genteel', 'Southerners', 'Plain', 'speaking', 'independent-minded', 'Margaret', 'chafes', 'strictures', 'placed', 'sex', 'also', 'learn', 'inequalities', 'working', 'classes', 'mill', 'owners.This', 'stage', 'clash', 'John', 'Thornton', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'owner', 'cotton', 'mill', 'Margaret', 'first', 'impression', 'Thornton', 'cruel', 'insensitive', 'man', 'who', 'employees', 'abysmally', 'Sparks', 'soon', 'fly', 'two', 'Thornton', 'who', 'initial', 'strong', 'attraction', 'Margaret', 'Margaret', 'too', 'overcome', 'first', 'impressions', 'really', 'feel', 'much', 'Thornton', 'developing', 'friendship', 'young', 'mill', 'worker', 'father', 'Nicholas', 'played', 'pre-Downton', 'Abbey', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'further', 'fragile', 'relationship', 'Thornton', 'Margaret', 'Thornton', 'Richard', 'pupil', 'studying', 'classics', 'two', 'men', 'form', 'affectionate', 'friendship', 'Margaret', 'animosity', 'Thornton', 'When', 'Nicholas', 'union', 'leader', 'calling', 'strike', 'cotton', 'mills', 'fight', 'raise', 'better', 'working', 'conditions', 'Thornton', 'Margaret', 'clash', 'even', 'more.Richard', 'Armitage', 'performance', 'brooding', 'proud', 'cotton', 'mill', 'owner', 'John', 'Thornton', 'reminded', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'ofPride', 'Prejudiceand', 'Mr.', 'Edward', 'Rochester', 'ofJane', 'Eyre', 'Signet', 'Classics', 'Armitage', 'credible', 'magnetic', 'performance', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'Armitage', 'Daniela', 'Denby-Ashe', 'riveting', 'viewing', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'especially', 'when', 'two', 'were', 'engaged', 'heated', 'conversation.There', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'wonderfully-written', 'production', 'romance', 'family', 'tensions', 'class', 'gender', 'issues', 'many', 'more', 'are', 'masterfully', 'weaved', 'production', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'score', 'boot', 'also', 'seamlessly', 'watched', 'four', 'episodes', 'Prime', 'members', 'get', 'free', 'streaming', 'one', 'sitting', 'plan', 're-watch', 'again', 'much', 'savor', 'here', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Thornton', 'Margaret', 'Hale', 'story', 'making', 'compelling', 'engaging', 'viewing', 'experience', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'production', 'am', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'add', 'period', 'drama', 'collection']","North and South Set North & South  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 United Kingdom"
