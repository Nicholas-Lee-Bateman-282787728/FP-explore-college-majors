I really loved how they rotated the ""camera"" angles during periods of chase and shifted the background to move with the character. It made the film seem more alive. The creators of the film seemed to focus in too much upon the animation though and less upon character development and plot.The three main characters are a Grandfather, Father and Son (Old Mr. Steam, Middle-aged Mr. Steam and Kid Steam). Each is fairly fleshed out, but the son is rather typical and bland. The most interesting of which is probably the excitable grandfather. The father was uhh prophetic.All together it was a great film, and my eyes were glued to the screen watching it. The end animation sequences tended to draw out a bit and the plot/character development was bland.

Akira was a complex, violent, and disturbing film. Steamboy seems more akin to Walt Disney. Unfortunately for me, I bought this movie expecting Akira and I was obviously disappointed. But then I watched it a second time; I forced myself to, with a mindset that didn't include Akira. I told myself that I've seen and enjoyed anime of this type before (Spirited Away), so it couldn't be all that bad.I was right. The film was excellent the second time (and the first time as well, only I was of the mind to hate it because of it's less-mature themes). In the end, I realized it was actually very close to Akira in that it was a story of a young boy trying to save his family and friends from a technological catastrophe, and has to do all this with very mixed emotions of what is right and wrong (no more spoilers, I promise). When I realized how good this movie actually was, I also realized that, like Akira, it's a groundbreaker. It proves what Studio Ghibli has been attempting to prove on its own: that anime does not have to be violent, strange, or downright macabre to be good.Pick this film up if you want to see a new side to anime. And remember, it's no Akira, Ghost in the Shell, or Ninja Scroll, but it still deserves its name among these anime greats.",5,"Remember, Steamboy's no Akira",1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,1339,"['Steamboy', 'Akira', 'many', 'fans', 'think', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'crime', 'Akira', 'was', 'complex', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'film', 'Steamboy', 'more', 'akin', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Unfortunately', 'bought', 'movie', 'expecting', 'Akira', 'was', 'obviously', 'disappointed', 'then', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'forced', 'mindset', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'Akira', 'told', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'anime', 'type', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad.I', 'was', 'right', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'second', 'time', 'first', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'was', 'mind', 'hate', 'less-mature', 'themes', 'end', 'realized', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'close', 'Akira', 'was', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'trying', 'save', 'family', 'friends', 'technological', 'catastrophe', 'do', 'very', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'more', 'spoilers', 'promise', 'When', 'realized', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'actually', 'was', 'also', 'realized', 'Akira', 'groundbreaker', 'what', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'been', 'attempting', 'prove', 'own', 'anime', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'violent', 'strange', 'downright', 'macabre', 'be', 'good.Pick', 'film', 'up', 'want', 'see', 'new', 'side', 'anime', 'remember', 'Akira', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'still', 'name', 'anime', 'greats']",Steamboy: Director's Cut
909918,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B0009P42S2,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[20, 28]","Much has been made over the fact that the director of Steamboy is the same who directed the anime classic Akira.  As a fan of Akira from way back when I first saw it in '89, I was expecting first rate animation.  Steamboy didn't disappoint me, at least not there.Ray Steam is the son and grandson of two of Victorian England's greatest living scientists and inventors.  One day some mysterious men from the O'Hara Corporation show up on his family's doorstep, asking for a package that has just arrived from Ray's grandfather who has been away on an expedition with his father.  Ray learns just in time however that these men are evil and that he must not let them have the contents; one ""steam ball"", which contains within itself enormous power.  Immediately the action ensues as Ray flees the Corporate men to deliver the steam ball back to his grandfather.  We follow along as Ray goes on a journey to find not only the answer the mystery of the steam ball, but also the answer to the question: what is the purpose of science - power, happiness, or something else?This is a very realistic vision of Victorian England combined with some fantastically precocious machine technology which was intended to make for a very weird cinematic experience.  Too bad that this experience was thwarted time and again by a plot that was stretched too thin and dragged on too long.  The pacing alternated between long, lethargic stretches of dialog and frantic action sequences featuring steamy explosions, crashes and chases.  This story could have been --and should have been!-told in about 20 minutes less time.  It's as if nobody was editing this.(Director's Cut, you say?  I respond:  there's a reason that God gave us editors.  Make better use of them!)That it is a superb  technical achievement, I can't deny.  That it is one of the most elaborate animes ever made (as the dvd back cover trumpets) is without any doubt.  A visual feast, gorgeous cinematography (animaphotography?  Oh well...), incredible attention to details, genius of direction...yes, all of that and more.  But this film should be a lesson to directors everywhere; the best visuals in any medium cannot compensate for or transform an essentially boring story.First, choose your script well!-Andrea, aka merribelle",3,Brilliant animation ruined by poor narrative,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,2278,"['Much', 'been', 'made', 'fact', 'director', 'Steamboy', 'same', 'who', 'directed', 'anime', 'classic', 'Akira', 'fan', 'Akira', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'saw', ""'89"", 'was', 'expecting', 'first', 'rate', 'animation', 'Steamboy', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'least', 'not', 'there.Ray', 'Steam', 'son', 'grandson', 'two', 'Victorian', 'England', 'greatest', 'living', 'scientists', 'inventors', 'One', 'day', 'mysterious', 'men', ""O'Hara"", 'Corporation', 'show', 'up', 'family', 'doorstep', 'asking', 'package', 'just', 'arrived', 'Ray', 'grandfather', 'who', 'been', 'away', 'expedition', 'father', 'Ray', 'just', 'time', 'however', 'men', 'are', 'evil', 'must', 'not', 'let', 'have', 'contents', 'one', 'steam', 'ball', 'enormous', 'power', 'Immediately', 'action', 'Ray', 'Corporate', 'men', 'deliver', 'steam', 'ball', 'back', 'grandfather', 'follow', 'along', 'Ray', 'journey', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'answer', 'mystery', 'steam', 'ball', 'also', 'answer', 'question', 'what', 'purpose', 'science', 'power', 'happiness', 'something', 'else', 'very', 'realistic', 'vision', 'Victorian', 'England', 'combined', 'fantastically', 'precocious', 'machine', 'technology', 'was', 'intended', 'make', 'very', 'weird', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Too', 'bad', 'experience', 'was', 'thwarted', 'time', 'again', 'plot', 'was', 'stretched', 'too', 'thin', 'dragged', 'too', 'long', 'pacing', 'alternated', 'long', 'lethargic', 'stretches', 'dialog', 'frantic', 'action', 'sequences', 'featuring', 'steamy', 'explosions', 'crashes', 'chases', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'should', 'have', 'been', '-told', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'less', 'time', 'nobody', 'was', 'editing', 'Director', 'Cut', 'say', 'respond', 'reason', 'God', 'gave', 'editors', 'Make', 'better', 'use', 'superb', 'technical', 'achievement', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'one', 'most', 'elaborate', 'animes', 'ever', 'made', 'dvd', 'back', 'cover', 'trumpets', 'doubt', 'visual', 'feast', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'animaphotography', 'Oh', 'well', 'incredible', 'attention', 'details', 'genius', 'direction', 'yes', 'more', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'lesson', 'directors', 'everywhere', 'best', 'visuals', 'medium', 'can', 'not', 'compensate', 'transform', 'essentially', 'boring', 'story.First', 'choose', 'script', 'well', '-Andrea', 'aka', 'merribelle']",Steamboy: Director's Cut
909919,A1STJE8KFRWK3S,B0009P42S2,Brian Glass,"[1, 1]","I'm a fan of Akira (as most people reviewing here are) and I enjoyed Steamboy just slightly less.  I've gotten older since I saw Akira, my views on the world are different and animation has changed in that time too.  I thought the animation was gorgeous in this movie but as I was watching it I couldn't help but think it's just not ground breaking.  Of course that's not intended as a criticism.  It's almost impossible to be ground breaking today the way Akira was when it first came out and for several years after.  I love the hand drawn stuff but computer animation loses some of the ability to awe.  That's not a fair assessment however.  Steamboy is a work of art in it's own right.The story moved along at a good pace in my opinion.  It wasn't any slower than Spirited Away or Royal Space Force - Wings of Honneamise.  The slow quiet moments allowed a better appreciation of the beautiful images and animation.  The problem with the story wasn't the pacing but the clich&eacute;d anti-capitalist rants.  It is too simplistic a world view.  The movie wants it both ways.  The overt message is violence and war are wrong while the action is fetishizing that violence.  The battle scenes have a how-cool-is-this look and feel to them.  The artists aren't necessarily trying to see how beautiful they can make war but that's the end result.The underlying themes in this movie are certainly similar to Akira and while I've heard it said this film is more viewer friendly there are still some deeper things going on that are less obvious.  While I thought the anti-capitalist messages were almost niav&eacute; they were still thought provoking (but just a little).  It would be getting carried away to say there was anything more deep and meaningful going on here than comic book philosophy.In the end the movie is gorgeous to look at with a lot of senses numbing action sequences and good entertainment",4,"Great Animation, Trite Plot",1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,1905,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Akira', 'most', 'people', 'reviewing', 'here', 'are', 'enjoyed', 'Steamboy', 'just', 'slightly', 'less', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'older', 'saw', 'Akira', 'views', 'world', 'are', 'different', 'animation', 'changed', 'time', 'too', 'thought', 'animation', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'just', 'not', 'ground', 'breaking', 'course', 'not', 'intended', 'criticism', 'almost', 'impossible', 'be', 'ground', 'breaking', 'today', 'way', 'Akira', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'several', 'years', 'love', 'hand', 'drawn', 'stuff', 'computer', 'animation', 'ability', 'awe', 'not', 'fair', 'assessment', 'however', 'Steamboy', 'work', 'art', 'own', 'right.The', 'story', 'moved', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'opinion', 'was', ""n't"", 'slower', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Royal', 'Space', 'Force', 'Wings', 'Honneamise', 'slow', 'quiet', 'moments', 'allowed', 'better', 'appreciation', 'beautiful', 'images', 'animation', 'problem', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'pacing', 'clich', 'eacute', 'anti-capitalist', 'rants', 'too', 'simplistic', 'world', 'view', 'movie', 'ways', 'overt', 'message', 'violence', 'war', 'are', 'wrong', 'action', 'fetishizing', 'violence', 'battle', 'scenes', 'have', 'how-cool-is-this', 'look', 'feel', 'artists', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'trying', 'see', 'how', 'beautiful', 'can', 'make', 'war', 'end', 'result.The', 'underlying', 'themes', 'movie', 'are', 'certainly', 'similar', 'Akira', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'said', 'film', 'more', 'viewer', 'friendly', 'are', 'still', 'deeper', 'things', 'going', 'are', 'less', 'obvious', 'thought', 'anti-capitalist', 'messages', 'were', 'almost', 'niav', 'eacute', 'were', 'still', 'thought', 'provoking', 'just', 'little', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'carried', 'away', 'say', 'was', 'anything', 'more', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'going', 'here', 'comic', 'book', 'end', 'movie', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'lot', 'senses', 'numbing', 'action', 'sequences', 'good', 'entertainment']",Steamboy: Director's Cut

909923,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0009P42S2,"Cloud ""...""","[8, 9]","It's a common law that only gets broken rarely: the more anticipated something is, the less likely chance it'll meet or exceed expectations. A new cd by a band you love might not be that great. The follow-up to a director's past masterpiece falls below expectations. Steamboy is one of those kind of films where there's an obvious enthusiasm and passion involved, it's just not what it should've been.We're in the mid 1800's right smack in the middle of the Industrial Revolution in Europe. Steam is the big thing so when Ray Steam(very lazy name) gets his hands on an odd ""Steam ball"", he soon becomes a target for the O'Hara Foundation. They want to harness the power of the ball for their own needs(which obviously don't benefit anyone) so Ray has to keep the ball away from people who would want to use it.One thing that made Akira enjoyable was that the story just seemed to unfold without any hiccups(even if you couldn't understand it). Steamboy's pacing is incredibly off since it feels so SLLOOOWWW. So much happened yet I was only 40 minutes in. It doesn't help that there's not much to the story either. The moral of the story it seems is that technology for personal use is bad while technology benefiting everyone is good. Granted you could say it's something else but the film is so black and white that you'd have to say it like that. Many technology we use we actually use on our own or for our own needs.The characters aren't really that interesting either and don't go through much change. Ray is your typical hero that saves the day when he doesn't exactly possess the skills to do so, it's more through luck. There's Scarlett, your very typical spoiled brat who wants things her way and for us to answer everything or criticize when we don't know it. Usually in films they learn their lesson but here, she's still bossy and spoiled. The only one that really goes through any amount of change is our ""villain"" but he has a big change of heart incredibly quickly you're like ""gee that was fast"".Now all those negatives and some positives? Of course and it's the animation. Using 3D, the animation looks very stylized and fluid without being a bit obvious. A lot of 2D/3D mixtures tend to be very noticeable to distinguish the 2 but here it's almost flawless. I say almost because certain characters in early scenes almost looked pasted onto the background.Now I didn't watch the english dub but it's probably good since it has reliable Patrick Stewart and Alfred Molina and Anna Paquin...playing a boy. Yes, Rogue from X-Men is playing a teenage boy. She even mentions in the special features that the ADR people had to tell her to say things more lower register. Why they didn't just get a young guy actor or an older one with good range to do it is beyond me.Is it a great film? No. Terrible film? No. In the middle? Most definately. If you're an anime fan, you should check it out but since this is a highly anticipated project from the man who brought you Akira, you'll probably find it won't live up to your expectations.",3,3.5; everything but the essential parts work,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,3044,"['common', 'law', 'only', 'broken', 'rarely', 'more', 'anticipated', 'something', 'less', 'likely', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'exceed', 'expectations', 'new', 'cd', 'band', 'love', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'follow-up', 'director', 'past', 'masterpiece', 'expectations', 'Steamboy', 'one', 'kind', 'films', 'where', 'obvious', 'enthusiasm', 'passion', 'involved', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been.We', ""'re"", 'mid', '1800', 'right', 'smack', 'middle', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', 'Europe', 'Steam', 'big', 'thing', 'so', 'when', 'Ray', 'Steam', 'very', 'lazy', 'name', 'hands', 'odd', 'Steam', 'ball', 'soon', 'target', ""O'Hara"", 'Foundation', 'want', 'harness', 'power', 'ball', 'own', 'needs', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'benefit', 'anyone', 'so', 'Ray', 'keep', 'ball', 'away', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'use', 'it.One', 'thing', 'made', 'Akira', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'story', 'just', 'seemed', 'unfold', 'hiccups', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Steamboy', 'pacing', 'incredibly', 'so', 'SLLOOOWWW', 'So', 'much', 'happened', 'yet', 'was', 'only', '40', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'help', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'either', 'moral', 'story', 'technology', 'personal', 'use', 'bad', 'technology', 'benefiting', 'everyone', 'good', 'Granted', 'could', 'say', 'something', 'else', 'film', 'so', 'black', 'white', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Many', 'technology', 'use', 'actually', 'use', 'own', 'own', 'needs.The', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'much', 'change', 'Ray', 'typical', 'hero', 'day', 'when', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'possess', 'skills', 'do', 'so', 'more', 'luck', 'Scarlett', 'very', 'typical', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'who', 'things', 'way', 'answer', 'everything', 'criticize', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Usually', 'films', 'learn', 'lesson', 'here', 'still', 'bossy', 'spoiled', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'amount', 'change', 'villain', 'big', 'change', 'heart', 'incredibly', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'gee', 'was', 'fast', '.Now', 'negatives', 'positives', 'course', 'animation', 'Using', '3D', 'animation', 'very', 'stylized', 'fluid', 'being', 'bit', 'obvious', 'lot', '2D/3D', 'mixtures', 'tend', 'be', 'very', 'noticeable', 'distinguish', '2', 'here', 'almost', 'flawless', 'say', 'almost', 'certain', 'characters', 'early', 'scenes', 'almost', 'looked', 'pasted', 'background.Now', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'english', 'dub', 'probably', 'good', 'reliable', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'playing', 'boy', 'Yes', 'Rogue', 'X-Men', 'playing', 'teenage', 'boy', 'even', 'mentions', 'special', 'features', 'ADR', 'people', 'had', 'tell', 'say', 'things', 'more', 'lower', 'register', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'young', 'guy', 'actor', 'older', 'one', 'good', 'range', 'do', 'me.Is', 'great', 'film', 'No', 'Terrible', 'film', 'No', 'middle', 'Most', 'definately', ""'re"", 'anime', 'fan', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'project', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'Akira', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'wo', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations']",Steamboy: Director's Cut

909925,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0009P42S2,Cubist,"[4, 4]","Steamboy is the latest entry into the Steampunk subgenre, speculative fiction that presents an alternate historical setting of the Victorian era in which modern technological advances were invented earlier in history through the assistance of steam-era technology. Early fiction like Jules Vernes' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's novel, The Difference Engine and Alan Moore's popular comic book, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comic book are perhaps some of the best known examples of this subgenre. Gibson's Cyberpunk fiction had a profound influence on one of director Katsuhiro Otomo's previous anime movies, Akira, one of the greatest animated films ever made. Steamboy sees him influenced by Gibson's fiction again as he wrestles with some of the same themes, such as man vs. technology that he explored in Akira while maintaining the same level of quality animation.Otomo's film explores the differing views of science. Ray's grandfather believes that only the fruits of advances in science should be available to the educated and the privileged while his father believes it should be shared with everyone as he says at one point, ""Science exists as a power to be used in reality."" He believes it should be used to improve all of humanity, not just a small portion of it.Watching this movie only reinforces how bad The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen movie is compared to its original source material and the Steampunk genre in general.

Anna Paquin, Alfred Molina and Patrick Stewart talk briefly about the film and their appreciation for Otomo with Stewart speaking the most eloquently about the time period that Steamboy is set in.""Interview with Katsuhiro Otomo."" he started working on the project ten years ago with actual production on the film itself starting seven years ago.

That's what steampunk is all about, after all, the investment that England made in infrastructure built for steam locked them into a future path that turned out to be weak and ill conceived in hindsight. It's a wonderful fantasy and when done well, it can be a rich alternate history.  Tim Powers and Bruce Sterling create interesting Steampunk tales, and I can imagine if they'd written a story for Katsuhiro Otomo to direct, the combination would be magnificent.  That said, the story just didn't work for me.At first it was predictable, like stock parts off the fiction workshop shelf.  A boy gets a powerful item of technology and has to fight his own father for the rights to assert his own will, his own ingenuity, and strike out on his own.  There isn't enough background to allow the viewer to believe that this boy has the skills necessary to pull off his part in this story.  There also isn't enough plot to sustain the believability of the entire story.Bad guys are comical and wooden, good guys are stereotyped and predictable.

The moody colors, amazing 3D drawn landscapes, and the detail in the steam machinery were incredible eye-candy, and will delight any fan of animation.Unfortunately, the plot is nonsensical (even for anime), the characters are truly terrible, and the cell-style 2D character animation style jars horribly with the 3D backgrounds.  The characters in *Steamboy* look like amaturish paper cutouts laid over the background of a completely different movie.  Even the colors don't match.  (Imagine Inuyasha appearing in a scene from *Full Metal Alchemist*, and you'll get the picture).I don't really know how to review this movie, because I'm so astonished by how good the background animation is.  It's some of the best I've seen anywhere, yet it has these horrible 2D characters that aren't even nearly as well animated and seem to be taken from a different movie.  The plot, such as it is, seems to have tacked on at the very last minute, and has already been ably evicerated by other reviewers.Not recommended except for technical animation fans.

I can, however, say that I enjoyed Otomo's contribution to the film Memories more than I did Steamboy.  Both share the same kind of heavily industrial world of the past, cast in sepia-like tones reflecting an atmosphere of gloom.  That was more than okay for Memories' ""Cannon Fodder,"" but the world of Steamboy eventually grew tiresome to me.  The animation of this film is excellent, but it consisted of far too many scenes of exploding machinery, to the detriment of character development and storyline.  Frankly, I just didn't care about this plot all that much.You've got a young, inventive boy who finds himself in the middle of a conflict over the nature of science.  It's an argument that will erupt in loud, frightening chaos over the city of London.  The boy's name is Ray Steam, and steam is definitely the key word in all of this.  Ray receives a parcel from his grandfather containing an ultra-powerful ""steamball,"" and almost at once he's forced to honor his grandfather's request to keep it out of the hands of ""the Foundation.""  His father, however, or at least a somewhat mechanized version of him, happens to be in cahoots with the Foundation, and he begins to win his son over to his own version of science.  He has used the vast power of steam to take his own father's vision of a Steam Castle and turn it into a well-armed weapon, complete with steam-powered flyers, subs, and mechanized fighters.  The grandfather, looking much the worse for wear, shows up to try and sabotage his evil son's efforts, and he confronts Ray with his own peaceful vision of science.  Fortunately for the audience, there's a spoiled little rich girl (by the name of Scarlett O'Hara - I kid you not) to add some life to all this philosophizing and artificiality.  The whole thing soon breaks down into a not-so-small war over London.  If you like explosions and scenes of utter destruction in your anime, you'll definitely want to check out Steamboy.  That's about all you'll find in the second half of the film.To me, Steamboy is a case of style over substance.  None of the characters are as fully developed as I would have liked, and the whole story never manages to take on very much depth.  Motion pictures, even anime, cannot live on cinematography alone if they want to be truly successful.  With its underdeveloped storyline, Steamboy just didn't prove satisfying to me.",3,"Looks great, but the plot itself doesn't build up much steam",1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,2507,"[""'m"", 'still', 'learning', 'ropes', 'when', 'anime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Steamboy', 'Katsuhiro', 'Otomo', 'legendary', 'Akira', 'can', 'however', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Otomo', 'contribution', 'film', 'more', 'did', 'Steamboy', 'share', 'same', 'kind', 'heavily', 'industrial', 'world', 'past', 'cast', 'sepia-like', 'tones', 'reflecting', 'atmosphere', 'gloom', 'was', 'more', 'okay', 'Memories', 'Cannon', 'Fodder', 'world', 'Steamboy', 'eventually', 'grew', 'tiresome', 'animation', 'film', 'excellent', 'consisted', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'exploding', 'machinery', 'detriment', 'character', 'development', 'storyline', 'Frankly', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'plot', 'much.You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'young', 'inventive', 'boy', 'who', 'middle', 'conflict', 'nature', 'science', 'argument', 'will', 'erupt', 'loud', 'frightening', 'chaos', 'city', 'London', 'boy', 'name', 'Ray', 'Steam', 'steam', 'definitely', 'key', 'word', 'Ray', 'parcel', 'grandfather', 'containing', 'ultra-powerful', 'steamball', 'almost', 'once', 'forced', 'honor', 'grandfather', 'request', 'keep', 'hands', 'Foundation', 'father', 'however', 'least', 'somewhat', 'mechanized', 'version', 'be', 'cahoots', 'Foundation', 'win', 'son', 'own', 'version', 'science', 'used', 'vast', 'power', 'steam', 'take', 'own', 'father', 'vision', 'Steam', 'Castle', 'turn', 'well-armed', 'weapon', 'complete', 'steam-powered', 'flyers', 'subs', 'mechanized', 'fighters', 'grandfather', 'looking', 'much', 'worse', 'wear', 'up', 'try', 'sabotage', 'evil', 'son', 'efforts', 'Ray', 'own', 'peaceful', 'vision', 'science', 'Fortunately', 'audience', 'spoiled', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'name', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'kid', 'not', 'add', 'life', 'philosophizing', 'artificiality', 'whole', 'thing', 'soon', 'down', 'not-so-small', 'war', 'London', 'like', 'explosions', 'scenes', 'utter', 'destruction', 'anime', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Steamboy', ""'ll"", 'find', 'second', 'half', 'film.To', 'Steamboy', 'case', 'style', 'substance', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'developed', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'whole', 'story', 'never', 'take', 'very', 'much', 'depth', 'Motion', 'pictures', 'even', 'anime', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'want', 'be', 'truly', 'successful', 'underdeveloped', 'storyline', 'Steamboy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'prove', 'satisfying']",Steamboy: Director's Cut

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","As his follow-up to ""Akira,"" Katsuhiro tomo spent a staggering eight years producing ""Steamboy,"" a stellar example of anime steampunk. It's full of detailed animation, solid direction and some really inspired action scenes, although the final fourth is extremely bloated. Dark, detailed, gritty and full of smoke, steam and grime.In the mid 1800s, Dr. Lloyd Steam (Patrick Stewart) and his son Eddie Steam (Alfred Molina) are involved in top secret experimentation for the O'Hara Corporation. There's a disaster which leaves only one machine intact -- the Steam Ball.Then Eddie's son Ray (Anna Paquin), a budding inventer, gets the Steam Ball in the mail -- and some thuggish Foundation men destroying the house to get the valuable machine. Ray escapes with the Ball, barely eluding the men, and ends up captured by a rogue zeppelin that tears a train apart. Great scene.But the man in charge of this is none other than Ray's father Eddie, who was terribly burned and is now part machin. Eddie, who is still working for the Foundation, is in charge of the powerful Steam Tower and all the war inventions inside. Now Ray's loyalties are divided, as his father and grandfather battle in a war that has no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" -- but which may wreck London, then the world.If you're going to spend almost a decade working on a movie, then people expect a masterpiece. And while ""Steamboy"" won't change anime the way ""Akira"" did, it's still a prime example of the steampunk genre -- Victorian English surroundings, but with steam-powered tanks, subs and other technology.The main plot is basically about a family's conflict over different ideas about how technology should be used. But Katsuhiro tomo includes a deeper meaning to the conflict -- there's no clear-cut villain and hero here, since both Eddie and Lloyd have good intentions, though one believes in peace through power, and the other knows that power corrupts.And the animation is amazingly detailed, so you can see every puff of steam and smear of grease. No big watery eyes here. It makes the action scenes -- including a zeppelin and train almost smashing into Victoria Station -- all the more compelling. In between, we have some solid character development, such as Ray getting to know the bratty O'Hara heiress, and experimenting with primitive subs and machinery.But every movie has a flaw, and ""Steamboy's"" is that the last fourth is bloated. It's a brilliant battle -- especially the flying soldiers -- and the end itself is satisfying. But it's too slow and meandering, and has too many lingering shots of the bulbous tower over London. Fortunately it regains its footing in the last few minutes, especially when Ray takes control of the plot.Ray himself is one of the most compelling child-heroes ever -- he's genuinely smart, resourceful and mature, but he's still young. He's only learning that not everything in life (even your family) is what it seems. And the supporting cast is also good, with a subdued Molina as Eddie and Stewart as the feisty Lloyd, who seems like an older version of Ray. And then there's Scarlett, a spoiled brat who is pretty annoying up until the final battle.""Steamboy"" suffers from a rather slow finale, but the movie itself is a brilliantly-animated, solidly-plotted adventure.

If so ""Steamboy"" is the movie for you. The movie opens in a factory where the steam pressure has increased to a dangerous level. After the inevitable explosion the movie switches to its second scene, a factory with an uncontrolled buildup of steam. This is a movie that SERIOUSLY enjoys showing the effects of steam pressure. The knock against ""Steamboy"" is that it's visually stunning but lacking in story. For the first half of the movie I was ready to write a review disagreeing but at the half way mark the movie seemed to lose...steam?""Steamboy"" takes place in Victorian era England featuring steam technology that never actually existed. At this point mythological industrial era technology has practically reached the level of genre having been used in more than a few movies and books most recently in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" and the unfortunate ""Wild Wild West"". The story revolves around the near magical steam ball, a bowling ball size object that contains enough pressure to power an entire building. This is the device that young Ray Steam uses to become the titular ""Steamboy"" although he doesn't don his flight suit and steam rocket until an hour and a half into the movie and even then only takes a few short flights. The last half hour of the movie seems to be an homage to steam pressure with expanding and exploding pipes and endless scenes of destruction and then the movie quickly ends.The plot seems a bit threadbare which is a shame after the loving devotion spent on animation. Director Katsuhiro tomo seemed to be trying to make some kind of point about the place of science at the dawn of the industrial age but I wasn't sure what the point was. On one hand the Steam Castle was a technologic (if unfeasible) wonder but on the other hand the technology was used to create weapons which nearly destroy London.

The story takes place during the industrial revolution. A young boy named James Ray Steam receives a package from his grandfather which contains a powerful ball that pretty much harnesses the power of steam. Just as the package gets to his home, two suspicious looking gentlemen arrives at his home and tries to take the ball from James. James doesn't allow the agents to take them when he sees the note from his grandfather that the men are not good. This quickly sets off a chase between these agents and James. Slowly but surely the premise of the film of the goodness of humanity vs. the evils and dangers of technology is revealed.I loved the animation of the film. The combination of hand drawn animation and computer generated animation was gorgeous, especially towards the end of the film. The first hour of the film had me deeply engrossed but the last hour started to drag on for me. Sometimes I think director's cut versions of films are really not necessary 'cause they have a tendency to bog down the story of the film, and this is the case here on ""Steamboy"". I also was annoyed for most of the film by Miss Scarlett. I never understood her relationship to Dr. Eddie Steam. I only watched the Japanese version. America needs to stop ruining anime films with their dreadful English dubbing. It just takes so much away from the magic of what the Japanese created.

Alas, no such luck.  I'm forced to agree with the several reviewers who wrote that the story alluded to in the drawings over which the End Credits ran (called ""The Adventure Continues"") looked like a much better (and potentially more entertaining) story than the one Mr. Otomo insisted on telling us.Steamboy is certainly chock full of ideas, but they are all ideas that have been repeatedly expressed before.  Among these are many that nobody would dispute and thus hardly needs reminding of:War is terrible.Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.Technological advances (like EVERYTHING ELSE) can be misused.The conduct of the Great European Powers in the generation prior to World War I was suicidally stupid, almost as suicidally stupid as was the conduct of Japanese militarists prior to World War II.In addition to these Mr. Otomo tosses out a couple other ideas more easily disputed:Capitalism is bad.  As compared to what?  There is a reason capitalist countries have to build walls to keep people out, communist countries have to build walls to keep people in, and socialist countries have to tear down their walls in order to deal with the fact that their socialized-into-uselessness citizens have lost, along with all other ambitions, the ambition to breed a new generation capable of funding their continued uselessness.Designing, manufacturing, and selling arms is wrong.  That rather obviously depends on who you are selling them to and what they will be used for.  People who see no difference between arming dictators for conquest and arming democracies for self-defense and liberation of the conquered and enslaved are probably delusional about lots of other things as well.  Of course arms manufacturers selling advanced weapons indiscriminately to the highest bidder is arguably a bad idea, but since outside of fiction (where it has become a clich&eacute;) this doesn't actually happen, it's a moot point.  Strong governments, without which advanced arm manufacturers cannot exist, will not tolerate this sort of thing; anytime something like this is alleged to have happened in real life, you will invariably find that the controlling government at least tacitly approved,...or somebody's going to be executed.Why have I ignored the plot in my review thus far?  Well, Mr. Otomo doesn't deem it very important, so I don't see why I should.  Briefly, Ray Steam's (Yeesh, what a name!) father and grandfather have a disagreement over the proper use of a great scientific advancement, the steampunk equivalent of nuclear power, and though they never truly resolve it, they do manage to trash a large part of London debating it.  In the process Ray Steam manages to save the rest of London (Yay!) and the thoroughly obnoxious Scarlett O'Hara (a considerably less obviously good result).The end.IMHO Katsuhiro Otomo's brilliant artistic vision deserved a lot better than Katsuhiro Otomo's thoroughly inept plotting.

I liked ""Steamboy"", Katsuhiro Otomo's 2004 film, even though the idea of a sort of industrial revolution era sci-fi did seem a little odd at first.Ray Steam is a boy growing up in 1860s Manchester. His grandfather and father are both engineers, and pioneers in steam based technology. On a trip to Iceland, these relatives discovered a liquid that could be transformed into a high density, high pressure steam, which could fuel machinery with a minimum loss of energy. With this liquid, bolted up inside black metal ""steam balls"", almost anything can be achieved. This is science at its most powerful, and has many international eyes turned toward Great Britain. Plot and counter-plot are uncovered, intentions are made known and the Steam Castle (a giant floating fortress, powered by steam) is revealed. Ray's father wants to world to see it, his grandfather wants it torn apart. Scarlett O'Hara, an American heiress to a businessman's fortune, is just there for the ride, and for Ray's company. Ray, however, is very confused. These are very confusing times? What will he do?It's interesting seeing England (and London in particular) through Japanese eyes. The London of ""Steamboy"" is a little on the theoretical side, everything looks well researched and studied, but it does lack a bit of that charm, warmth and pomp that the English landscape, architecture and people have. The accents and the use of British slang in the English dub, for instance, feel a little bit pushed. Still, it is a very atmospheric backdrop, and suits the story well, I thought. The characters are fairly interesting to watch, which keeps the more philosophical dialogue (the nature of science, etc) from seeming over the top. There is action, but it is diluted a bit by the atmosphere, the colours and the slabs of dialogue between shots. I didn't really mind though, left me time to think about what was being explored.Special features include several making of segments, original production drawings, original theatrical trailer, and some pre-visual bits and pieces.Worth a look for fans of anime, fans of the Victorian era and maybe lovers of the older style of sci-fi (like Jules Verne, H.G.

909939,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B0009P42S2,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[8, 9]","Taken on its own, this is a dazzling film. Fans comparing various anime might find reason to cavil, but I probably like it for reasons others don't. It doesn't mix and match CGI effects or use up its bag of tricks. It's not given to constantly shifting camera angles merely because computerized cameras can do that, which still seems a novelty to live action producers. It stays largely to its color palette, the dark, forbidding tones of a Dicknesian Victorian England. By comparison I found the preview for Final Fantasy VII, which some fans probably consider state of the art, extremely boring.Steamboy plays like a filmed book, very deftly showing more than it tells. When there is speaking, it rarely clears things up, but merely adds more red herrings to the story. The film obviously owes a lot to Sherlock Holmes, as well as the earlier mechanical (as opposed to later electronic) ingenuity of The Wild Wild West TV show. But it draws subtly from these inspirations. Steamboy ends as it has to, in the epic fashion of Jules Verne and all Victorian and Edwardian visionary novels. One scene is also quite similar to the visually arresting opening of Chesterton's 1905 novel, The Ball and The Cross, although the story line is entirely different. I expect that except for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the future visions of this era are largely unexplored as film territory. The ending also suggests that a sequel, or even a series could follow. But instead it does something else: depict the ""continuing adventure"" in poignant scenes behind the closing credits. Choosing one of the extra features runs this imaginative portrayl without the credits.The main characters are all inventors, and all in the same lineage. The father and grandfather's long- winded speeches about Science are hard to take seriously, but the same optimistic view of a rosy future exists in numerous Victorian era books. The show also revolves around the London Exhibition and the famous Crystal Palace, then the showplace of British and world progress. But what else is the film? A parable? A puzzle? An exploration?

The movie had the mild cost of over 25 million dollars, and was in production for well over a decade. Even though it didn't really make the kind of impact that Otomo's previous works did, it is still a compelling film.Set in the 1860s, Ray Steam(yes, his last name is Steam!)is the prodigal son of the steamologist, Edward. Edward and his genius father Lloyd have spent the last few years developing a highly compressed form of energy in a containment called a Steamball. Lloyd sends it to Ray for safe keeping from the conniving O'Hara Foundation, of which Edward has alligned himself with. Ray eventually gets kidnapped by the O'Hara thugs, and confront his father, along with the very bratty Scarlett O'Hara. He makes of with the Steamball, and tries to seek help from Edward's rival, Robert Stephenson(based on the actual scientist). However, Stephenson wants to use it to fight Edward and the O'Hara Foundation who have created a giant steam-powered flying fortress called the Steam Castle. The castle begins to assualt London during the Great Exhibition, which leads to some great battle sequences between the O'Hara and Stephenson forces, with steam-powered tanks, battlesuits, airplanes, and submarines. Ray uses the Steamball to create a portable rocket, and flies into the castle to stop his father, and rescue Lloyd and Scarlett. Ray gets Scarlett away before the castle eventually falls, although both Lloyd and Edward apparently surivived according to the montage during the closing credits.Steamboy is one of the shining examples of steampunk's influence on anime, more so than some Miyazaki movies like Howl's Moving Castle. It incorporates some of the best from the genre including the outlandish 19th Century technology and the bounding spirit found in the works of Mark Twain and Jules Verne. Now, the major faults with that though are it spends too much time debating on the morals of science and what it should be used for. The time they waste showing Lloyd and Edward arguing over philosophy alone would've taken at least thirty minutes off the movie. The other problem is that it's a little longer than necessary, and seems like it seriously lost alot of its direction during the last act. It does however leave a bold mark in the annuals of animation, and worth checking out at least for some exhilirating visuals.

I love these movies with a passion, and since seeing them decided to see all of Miyazaki's movies. Well, I've seen all his movies that my local rental store has, so what now? I decided to expand my view of anima, see something else, and see if anyone can possibly be as good as Miyazaki. I sawGrave of the Firefliesand loved it.But then I saw Steamboy. All I have to say about this movie is, well, it isn't Miyazaki. Sure the animation looks great, nothing Miyazaki has ever made looked quite this good, not even Spirited Away. But this movie lacks the fun and awe of Miyazaki's works. Miyazaki's movies have great, and I do mean GREAT, stories and some of the best characters ever made. Steamboy lacks both of these. The story here is pretty stupid overall. We are apparently supposed to sympathize with Ray's granddad, but he was crazy. I'm telling you he belonged in a loony vill, and Ray's dad seemed to care about him, instead of just using him like the grandpa did.And I never found myself actually likening these people. Ray didn't know what he wanted to do, his dad was too, what's the word, Darth Vader like, and his grandpa was crazy and preachy. Who's left? Miss? She was a brat, and a stupid one at that. Unlike in any of Miyazaki's films, these people were just. . . there.If you want to see some great anima, see Spirited Away, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, or any of Myazaki's movies.

Especially for your first viewing. Roger Ebert gave this a negative review (after watching the dub) for having a nonsensical storyline. Well, the subbed version I saw in the theatre (Im lucky enough to live in a city where it played), made lots of sense and was actually quite simple. It's a story about science, more specifically energy, and how to use it. Different ideologies are represented by different characters. Eventually these opinions manifest into physical action, in a battle, and the film ends with what I can only describe as the opposite of a big explosion! Cool! Original!Having said that, this film (like Akira) is not really about story and characters. This film is a singular, visual statement. Like Michelangelo's David. It amazes me how many people don't get this! Akira is a statement about the ""End of the World"" mentality many post WW2 young japanese men felt (and still do), as a result of the bomb, rapidly advancing technology and a long history of violent earthquakes. It's about the rebuilding of Tokyo. Steamboy is the same way. The story and the characters are just tools for Otomo to express his statement.And finally the animation. I can say without a doubt that this is THE BEST ANIMATION I have ever seen! It is so clean, so technically perfect, so intricate, and so consistant I can't believe human hands achieved it. I think it is so flawless people accept it and begin to underappreciate it.

909959,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009P42S2,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","After directing ""Akira"" in 1988, Katsuhiro tomo avoided making another feature length anime for years.  In 1991 he did a live action film, the horror-comedy ""Warudo apaatoment hora"" and then in 1995 he did the ""Cannon Fodder"" segment for ""Memories.""  He wrote the scripts for Hiroyuki Kitakubo's ""Rjin Z"" in 1991 and adopted Osamu Tezuka's manga for Rintaro's ""Metoroporisu"" in 2001.  But it was not until 2004 that tomo helmed  ""Steamboy"" and left himself open to the inevitable comparisons of this two-hour anime with the classics in the field in which he had a major hand.On the one hand ""Steamboy"" is as visually stunning as you would expect, albeit in a decidedly different way from ""Akira"" and ""Metroporisu.""  This time around tomo is not telling a futuristic story, but one set in 1866 in the London of Victorian England, which mandates sepia toned colors rather than working with a palate of bright neon colors.  That alone justifies a different look to ""Steamboy,"" and the chief attraction for this anime are the hand-drawn animation, enhanced by computers, of the massive machines of gears and pistons.  But there is another interesting consequences to the setting of ""Steamboy,"" which is that for the first time with a Japanese anime I am recommending that you listen to the English audio track rather than the Japanese.  Since the characters are actually English, then for once it makes sense to go this route.  Besides, we are talking Patrick Stewart as grandfather Dr. Lloyd Steam, Alfred Molina as his son Dr. Eddie Steam, and Anna Panquin as James Ray Steam, who is the film's title figure.The key idea behind ""Steamboy"" is to recast the Industrial Revolution of the 19th-century with steam now holding a power and promise akin to atomic energy after World War II, although I guess scientifically the power is more like a jet engine (but the implications for transforming the world strike me as being more in the realm of the idealized future represented by atomic power).  Ray Steam is a boy inventor who comes into possession of ""steam ball,"" and then finds himself in a struggle between his father, who has become part-machine and power mad, and his grandfather, who turns into a wild-eyed Cassandra of gloom and doom.  The evil Dr. Steam is building an army with steam-powered tanks, mechanical  armor suits, and even steam jet packs for aerial assaults.  If tomo did not read Jules Verne at some point in his life I would be really surprised, because ""Steamboy"" owes as much to Verne's writing as it does to James Bond spy films and Tom Swfit adventures.However, the story is just not up to the grandeur of the animation, which involves not only the captivating combination of hand-drawn animation and computers, but also some great camera movement.  If this were a live-action film we would be talking about the impressive cinematography, especially since tomo seems to make a point of going for angles you are unlikely to get in the real world.  So there is more than just the retro look of ""Steamboy"" to recommend when it comes to the visuals of this 2004 film.  But tomo does not explore the steam technology as much as I would have liked, so that a promising idea becomes rather conventional and the substance behind the style ends up being disappointing.  Even the big debate behind the power play is childishly simplistic, so we are not dealing with a potent allegory either.  Besides, I was waiting for there to be more of a payoff to the character of Scarlett O'Hara (Kari Wahlgren).  Then again, it is entirely possible that tomo is never going to top ""Akira"" (what has James Cameron really done since ""Titanic""?) and even with its faults ""Steamboy"" is certainly worth watching.",4,"Think Tom Swift playing James Bond in a Jules Verne novel rather than ""Akira"" revisited",1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,3709,"['directing', 'Akira', '1988', 'Katsuhiro', 'tomo', 'avoided', 'making', 'feature', 'length', 'anime', 'years', '1991', 'did', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'horror-comedy', 'Warudo', 'apaatoment', 'hora', 'then', '1995', 'did', 'Cannon', 'Fodder', 'segment', 'Memories', 'wrote', 'scripts', 'Hiroyuki', 'Kitakubo', 'Rjin', 'Z', '1991', 'adopted', 'Osamu', 'Tezuka', 'manga', 'Rintaro', 'Metoroporisu', '2001', 'was', 'not', '2004', 'tomo', 'helmed', 'Steamboy', 'left', 'open', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'two-hour', 'anime', 'classics', 'field', 'had', 'major', 'hand.On', 'one', 'hand', 'Steamboy', 'visually', 'stunning', 'would', 'expect', 'albeit', 'decidedly', 'different', 'way', 'Akira', 'Metroporisu', 'time', 'tomo', 'not', 'telling', 'futuristic', 'story', 'one', 'set', '1866', 'London', 'Victorian', 'England', 'sepia', 'toned', 'colors', 'rather', 'working', 'palate', 'bright', 'neon', 'colors', 'alone', 'justifies', 'different', 'look', 'Steamboy', 'chief', 'attraction', 'anime', 'are', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'enhanced', 'computers', 'massive', 'machines', 'gears', 'pistons', 'interesting', 'consequences', 'setting', 'Steamboy', 'first', 'time', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'am', 'recommending', 'listen', 'English', 'audio', 'track', 'rather', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'English', 'then', 'once', 'sense', 'go', 'route', 'are', 'talking', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'grandfather', 'Dr.', 'Lloyd', 'Steam', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'son', 'Dr.', 'Eddie', 'Steam', 'Anna', 'Panquin', 'James', 'Ray', 'Steam', 'who', 'film', 'title', 'figure.The', 'key', 'idea', 'Steamboy', 'recast', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', '19th-century', 'steam', 'now', 'holding', 'power', 'promise', 'akin', 'atomic', 'energy', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'guess', 'scientifically', 'power', 'more', 'jet', 'engine', 'implications', 'transforming', 'world', 'strike', 'being', 'more', 'realm', 'idealized', 'future', 'represented', 'atomic', 'power', 'Ray', 'Steam', 'boy', 'inventor', 'who', 'possession', 'steam', 'ball', 'then', 'struggle', 'father', 'who', 'become', 'part-machine', 'power', 'mad', 'grandfather', 'who', 'wild-eyed', 'Cassandra', 'gloom', 'doom', 'evil', 'Dr', 'Steam', 'building', 'army', 'steam-powered', 'tanks', 'mechanical', 'armor', 'suits', 'even', 'steam', 'jet', 'packs', 'aerial', 'assaults', 'tomo', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'point', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'surprised', 'Steamboy', 'as', 'much', 'Verne', 'writing', 'James', 'Bond', 'spy', 'films', 'Tom', 'Swfit', 'adventures.However', 'story', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'grandeur', 'animation', 'not', 'only', 'captivating', 'combination', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'computers', 'also', 'great', 'camera', 'movement', 'were', 'live-action', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'talking', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'tomo', 'make', 'point', 'going', 'angles', 'are', 'unlikely', 'get', 'real', 'world', 'more', 'just', 'retro', 'look', 'Steamboy', 'recommend', 'when', 'visuals', '2004', 'film', 'tomo', 'not', 'explore', 'steam', 'technology', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'promising', 'idea', 'rather', 'conventional', 'substance', 'style', 'up', 'being', 'disappointing', 'Even', 'big', 'debate', 'power', 'play', 'childishly', 'simplistic', 'are', 'not', 'dealing', 'potent', 'allegory', 'was', 'waiting', 'be', 'more', 'payoff', 'character', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'Kari', 'Wahlgren', 'Then', 'again', 'entirely', 'possible', 'tomo', 'never', 'going', 'top', 'Akira', 'what', 'James', 'Cameron', 'really', 'done', 'Titanic', 'even', 'faults', 'Steamboy', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching']",Steamboy: Director's Cut

The film was in production for ten years and utilized more than 180,000 drawings and 440 CG cuts.  With a production cost of $26,000,000, Steamboy is the most expensive full length Japanese animated movie produced to date.The animation in Steamboy is very well done, and the viewer can tell that a lot of time was taken to produce the film.  As you watch, you can also see how torn Ray is when he's having to decide whether to help his father or his grandfather.  A viewer can also tell that an alternate history was utilized.  While steam is the main source of power, there are some elements of the technology utilized that either wouldn't have existed yet, or progressed faster than they did in our timeline.This DVD release of Steamboy contains several special features, and on the special features menu, they are split out into: Featurettes, Animation Onion Skins, Production Drawings, and Previews.  Under ""Featurettes,"" there are a total of four items included.  The first is an almost nineteen-minute documentary about producing the English dub of Steamboy, which includes interviews with some of the voice actors and some of the crew members involved with the dub.  Next is a five-minute interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo.  Otomo is speaking in Japanese, but instead of putting subtitles on the bottom of the screen, an American voice-over is dubbed over Otomo's voice.  Personally, I found this rather annoying.  Next is a ""Multi-Screen Landscape Study,"" which is a nineteen-minute piece that aired on three screens at a Steamboy exhibition.  Here, subtitles are utilized to translate the spoken Japanese.  ""The Adventure Continues"" is a textless version of the ending credits, which serve as a kind of epilogue for the film.The ""Animation Onion Skins"" runs for about four-and-a-half minutes, and shows the various developmental stages of five scenes (which shows everything from rough animation to final scenes).  ""Production Drawings"" runs for almost six minutes, and it shows paintings that had been done as the sets were developed.  The ""Previews"" menu includes several previews of both anime and non-anime releases from the studio that released Steamboy.Overall, Steamboy is a great film.

909962,A3M81YQA9Z6F0W,B0009P42S2,M. Fisher,"[2, 5]","I, being a (self-proclaimed) animation oficionado, know somewhat of the reputation of Katsuhiro Otomo.  I, myself have never seen AKIRA (yes, I know I should), but after hearing how good this guy was, I wanted to see Steamboy.So, I rented it from Blockbuster and popped it into my DVD player.  I watched the beautiful steam effects and animation.  I will give him credit for the fact that his movie was visually beautiful.  However, I could see some definite things that needed fixing.In the first ""act"" of the movie, the pace was good, exciting; interesting things happened; the story moved along and kept you interested.  The characters were interesting and we didn't get bogged down TOO much in exposition.  The chases were superb, and that steam bike-wheel invention of Ray's was, I have to say, awesome.I'm sad that I can't say the same for the rest of the movie.In the second ""act"", we are introduced to Scarlett and wonder why Otomo ditched Emma for this loser; Ray's dad and grandfather spout endless, stock philosophy; and Ray pretty much sits around and listens.  There was only character fattening here for the father and grandfather, not fleshing out.  And every time you think, ""Hey, Scarlett might be okay after all,"" she contradicts herself and makes you hate her even more.Finally, there's the third act of the movie, where things pick up again--not quite to the level of the first act, but SO much better in comparison to the second act that it looks like a gift from heaven.  Ray and the others  actually do some useful, good things (even Scarlett! *shock and amazement*), and (better yet) there's only minimal philosophy-spouting!  Yayness!  There are a couple of pretty annoying things there (like not getting to see Ray catch Scarlett), but overall it was good. Not great, but good.Then there's the end credits--and I guess they're okay for some people, but I thought that they really didn't need any of them but seeing his house rebuilt and him coming home.  That would be the fairy tale moment to end it at.  I guess I'm just an old-fashioned romantic, but the rest of them seem unnessecary to me.So, bottom line:Rent it, don't buy it.",3,GREAT animation--Disney in quality--but...,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,2158,"['being', 'self-proclaimed', 'animation', 'oficionado', 'know', 'somewhat', 'reputation', 'Katsuhiro', 'Otomo', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'AKIRA', 'yes', 'know', 'should', 'hearing', 'how', 'good', 'guy', 'was', 'wanted', 'see', 'Steamboy.So', 'rented', 'Blockbuster', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'watched', 'beautiful', 'steam', 'effects', 'animation', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'However', 'could', 'see', 'definite', 'things', 'needed', 'first', 'act', 'movie', 'pace', 'was', 'good', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'things', 'happened', 'story', 'moved', 'along', 'kept', 'interested', 'characters', 'were', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'TOO', 'much', 'exposition', 'chases', 'were', 'superb', 'steam', 'bike-wheel', 'invention', 'Ray', 'was', 'have', 'say', 'awesome.I', ""'m"", 'sad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'rest', 'movie.In', 'second', 'act', 'are', 'introduced', 'Scarlett', 'wonder', 'why', 'Otomo', 'ditched', 'Emma', 'loser', 'Ray', 'dad', 'grandfather', 'spout', 'endless', 'stock', 'philosophy', 'Ray', 'pretty', 'much', 'sits', 'listens', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'fattening', 'here', 'father', 'grandfather', 'not', 'fleshing', 'out', 'time', 'think', 'Hey', 'Scarlett', 'might', 'be', 'okay', 'hate', 'even', 'more.Finally', 'third', 'act', 'movie', 'where', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'again', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'first', 'act', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'comparison', 'second', 'act', 'gift', 'heaven', 'Ray', 'others', 'actually', 'do', 'useful', 'good', 'things', 'even', 'Scarlett', '*shock', 'amazement*', 'better', 'yet', 'only', 'minimal', 'philosophy-spouting', 'Yayness', 'are', 'couple', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'things', 'there', 'not', 'getting', 'see', 'Ray', 'catch', 'Scarlett', 'overall', 'was', 'good', 'Not', 'great', 'good.Then', 'end', 'credits', 'guess', ""'re"", 'okay', 'people', 'thought', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'seeing', 'house', 'rebuilt', 'coming', 'home', 'would', 'be', 'fairy', 'tale', 'moment', 'end', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'old-fashioned', 'romantic', 'rest', 'seem', 'unnessecary', 'me.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'Rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",Steamboy: Director's Cut
909963,A1IM6GAVUQJ27X,B0009P42S2,Michael Kim,"[38, 48]","Background:Steamboy is the first movie directed by a giant from Japanese anime Katsuhiro Otomo since his ground breaking movie Akira from 16 years ago. Unlike most anime fans I saw Steamboy before seeing its more famous partner. If you are expecting another Akira you will be disappointed since Steamboy is a 180 degree opposite in ambiance although both movies explore similar themes. Instead of Akira's dsytopic nihilistic Neo-Toyko Otomo re-creates a romantic optimistic Victorian England. Steamboy has the feel of a more mainstream Hollywood style action/adventure movie. Steamboy presents a fascinating intersection of history and sci-fi as its backdrop. The DVD is the director's cut with your choice of having the dialogue in English, Japanese and various Romance languages. Also, one can have subtitles in English, and the other languages.Non-spoiler Plot:Steamboy takes place in Victorian England in 1866. Although Otomo rewrites history by throwing in many elements not yet existing in 1866 but are from that overall period including Tower Bridge and battleships not built till the last decade of the 19th century. The movie is centered on the ownership of a Steam Ball which can generate the power equivalent to a small nuclear reactor. The movie, as typical in many Japanese anime and fantasy movies, centers on the issue of what is the proper use of this new breakthrough technology. This conflict is represented as an intergenerational conflict within the Steam family. The elder Steam, Lloyd (voiced by Patrick Stewart) has become deranged seeing his invention being put to what he sees as evil uses, his son Eddie (voiced by Alfred Molina), who is half man/machine, in a Nietzschian view sees the Steam Ball as a showcase of the power of science for science sake to push humankind to new heights. Eddie's 13 year old son Ray (voiced by Anna Paquin) is caught in the middle trying to save his father and grandfather and London from the consequences of their invention. A nefarious corporation, the O'Hara Foundation wants the Steam Ball, and the British are interested in acquiring it too sending Robert Stephenson, a tribute to the namesake who with his father invented the railway locomotive and built the first rail line from Liverpool to Manchester in 1830, to gain control of the Steam Ball for the sake of national security.The movie spends the first part in Manchester and the surrounding countryside, including a panorama showing to borrow Dickens ""satanic mills"" dominating the city spewing black smoke into the air. The movie shifts to London centered on a park on the bank of the Thames. Otomo accurately animates the atmospheric effects of London's fog and smog. The park is home to the Crystal Palace, magnificently recreated in this anime movie, housing the Great Exhibition and the O'Hara Foundation Pavilion, using the design of Royal Albert Hall. [In history, the Crystal Palace, one of the great architectural achievements of the Victorian era, was built in 1851 to house the Great Exhibition of that year. The Great Exhibition in what might be considered the first World's Fair organized by Queen Victoria's consort Prince Albert the Exhibition invited all the nations of the world to showcase the technologies and applications that came about from the Industrial Revolution.]  The O'Hara Foundation sponsors the research of Eddie and Lloyd Steam that resulted in the invention of the Steam Ball. As we learn in the film the O'Hara Foundation has darker purposes for attending the Great Exposition besides showcasing the latest benevolent inventions. The titular representative of the O'Hara foundation is Scarlett O'Hara (voiced by anime regular Kari Wahlgren), around the same age as Ray, who is the sole heir to the O'Hara fortune. We immediately get the idea the Scarlett is a spoiled brat who complains about the smell and soot of London and enjoys bossing around the head of marketing for the O'Hara Corporation Archibald Simon. (PETA members might not like what she does to her poor Chihuahua Columbus). Although Scarlett is the one character who undergoes the most change as she sees the consequences of the her family's firm inventions. The movie is filled with action and adventure including chase scenes, and battle that breaks out at the area around the Crystal Palace where Otomo introduces many of the ""futuristic"" elements of the movie, and the reveling of Eddie's vision of science in the Steam Castle (Steam Tower in the english subtitles).Analysis:The main strength of this film is the gorgeous combination of traditional hand drawn 2-D and 3-D CGI animation. From what I have read, Otomo and his creative design team spent time on England, visiting London, Manchester and York, and studying steam locomotives and machinery from the Victorian era to beautifully recapture Victorian England, the motifs of that era, and the mechanical designs of the machinery down to the last rivet. For example, the Royal Navy ships in the movie are accurate recreations of real warships from the Victorian era. This research paid off in the stunning detail of the movie. You are starring at the screen just to soak up the details of the machinery Otomo created. I enjoyed how the movie used real historic events and places, mentioned above, as the backdrop for the movie. They showed great imagination in designing the ""futuristic"" elements which retains a 19th century appearance and mechanical design. Unlike other Japanese anime with their convoluted plot lines this is a straight forward action/adventure movie. The movie is dominated by browns and has a sepia tone to it. There are some wonderful animation effects including how lenses distort images, from what I understand this is a very difficult effect, to scenes with tons of falling confetti, to a scene where glass is shattered and on each chard you see an imprinted moving image from an earlier scene.There is not much character development in this movie except for perhaps Scarlett. Most of the characters are representations of the different uses of science and technology. Eddie is the personification of science for science sake without any moral/ethical considerations. Lloyd takes the opposite view that science must be looked at in terms of the moral/ethical impact and science should be restricted if it leads to a ""bad"" outcome. Ray is caught in the middle conflicted about what he should do and shows concern for both his father and grandfather. His actions and decisions are based on what he learns about the motives of the characters and his underlying desire to save his father and grandfather. Robert Stephenson sees science as being used for national security reasons. Scarlett espouses the economic rationale for scientific advancement. Although the characters are not quite so black and white. Eddie is perhaps misguided but he is not evil personified. When one sees Lloyd's vision of the uses of science for frivolity you might find yourself believing his view is just as extreme as Eddie's but in the opposite direction. Scarlett has the obvious rich girl spoiled brat attitude but Otomo shows underlying this faade is a sensitive, and intelligent girl. Otomo has these characters espouse their beliefs explicitly in their dialogue which often become monologues and lectures.Otomo uses the several characters to present different philosophies on the use of science but leaves it up to the viewer to make their own decision. The plot could used some improvement and the action can get a bit overwhelming at times. The machinery tends to overwhelm the story Otomo is trying to tell.I very much enjoyed the classical soundtrack by Steven Jablonsky. He developed wonderful themes for Ray and Scarlett and utilizes them throughout the movie.Overall, Steamboy should appeal to a both anime fans and a more conventional audience. This movie is far superior to Hollywood's recent attempt at Steampunk with Will Smith's Wild Wild West and Sean Connery's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.Time magazines Richard Corliss listed Steamboy, along with Akira, as one of the top 5 anime movies available on DVD. A side benefit of this movie is the educational opportunities this movie provides in further explorations of the Victorian era and the Industrial Revolution.The movie is rated PG-13 for the action. The PG-13 is more to the PG side than R side. There is one scene with blood but there is no objectionable language or suggestive sexual scenes.DVD Features: The transfer to DVD is excellent with great sound and picture quality. The aspect ratio was 1.85:1 so the transfer does not take full advantage of widescreen TVs, the wide screen version of Star Wars has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The DVD features are pretty bland. There is no director's commentary which is understandable give the language barrier. There is a 5 minute interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo. There is a 15 minute featurette about the challenges of re-dubbing the movie in English with Anna Paquin, Alfred Molina, and Patrick Stewart. The 20 minute multi-screen landscape study splits the screen three ways. First there are scenes from the movie mixed with real life shots of London. 15 minutes of this featurette are interviews with the creative team discussing how they made the movie. The ending montage shows the images from the end credits of the English dubbed theatrical release without the text. Although this ending was a condensed version of the director's cut ending, which is the ending for the movie on this DVD. The production drawings are still shots of paintings used to develop ideas in the movie, some of which are pretty interesting. The animation onion skins shows the process by which five scenes are built combining hand drawn and CGI techniques although there is no dialogue explaining the process.",4,Anime for a mainstream

909964,A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ,B0009P42S2,Michael K. Smith,"[0, 0]","Steam-punk is sort of the retro version of cyberpunk -- 19th century gears and punch cards instead of electronics and computers. It's 1866 and the Drs. Lloyd and Edward Steam, father and son, have invented the ""steam ball,"" a soccer-ball-sized contraption that will contain and control steam pressure far greater than any boiler. (How it works and how you get the steam in there is brushed aside -- fortunately.) They use this fantastic new energy source, financed by the mysterious O'Hara Foundation, to construct and power the Steam Tower, now on display near the Crystal Palace at London's Great Exhibition. But the Foundation is really in the international arms business and the Steam Tower is their greatest weapon yet, including steam-powered-augmented armored solders (""steam troopers""), flying machines, submarines, and the Tower itself, which stomps around London like a gigantic metal godzilla. And who's to bring an end to this carnage? Why, Ray Steam, the adolescent scion of the Steam family and a genius inventor himself. It takes awhile before you figure out who are the Good Guys and who are the Baddies, and even then you're never quite sure. In fact, the moral of the whole story appears to be: Never trust anyone when it comes to corporate greed and weapons profits. There's lots of neat stuff here, including Ray's steam-powered omnicycle, and the enemy's huge iron waldoes, and especially Ray's makeshift quasi-rocket platform. My favorite character, though, is the arrogant, spoiled, egotistical, and completely self-involved Miss Scarlett (""Scarlett O'Hara"" -- right) who wanders in and out of danger in pursuit of her own wishes.

O'Blenis,"[3, 3]","A movie that starts slow but good and builds to a massive scope of action and imagination, ""Steamboy"" is yet another example of how vast the field of anime has become.  Set in a London of 1866 just like the one in history books and set on the metaphorical eve of events that will change human history and cause the world to diverge from 'our' future.  Most of the movie's main characters are members of the Steam family (fourteenish-Ray Steam is the title character), and the father and grandfather of the family, away for years working in America, have discovered a method of harnessing steam power to far greater yields than anything ever seen in 'our' world.  This new technology puts the two against each other and starts the ball rolling toward the 1866 London Industrial Fair, and a sudden turning point in the world's history that occurs in a few hours of a single day.  Much of the movie is spent trying to decide which side one, as the viewer, wants to be on, what the true motivations of the various characters really are, and who is telling the truth about what.  As with the rest of the movie, this angle of uncertainty is very well done.  A tour-de-force of visual imagery and epic ideas, masterfully animated, this one in my opinion far outdoes director Katsuhiro Otomo's previous full-length anime ""Akira"".

909981,A267RZGUQ6KM2L,B0009P42S2,Terrell T. Gibbs,"[18, 19]","In Steamboy, Director Otomo turns his attention to the Steampunk genre, and the result is a gripping Victorian era techno-thriller. The macguffin of the plot is a ball that is supposedly able to store steam at enormous pressure and density. It doesn't make much sense, but it manages to drive a plot with a lot of action, engaging steam-puffing war machines, and some moderately sophisticated debate about the uses of science and technology.The characters are engaging, although hero Ray is  the usual somewhat generic plucky adolescent. The spoiled adolescent aristocrat Scarlett is considerably more interesting, as are Ray's father and grandfather, who personify conflicting ideas about the uses of technology.The animation is, of course, wonderful, as expected from the director of Akira. The film is full of strikingly original action scenes, which are both well conceived and well executed. Destruction abounds. Reputedly, the film used quite a bit of computer graphics, but it is extraordinarily well integrated. The hand-drawn characters do not have the ""pasted in"" look that has characterized most previous attempts to combine hand drawn and computer generated art, and I was hard put to tell where the traditional animation ended and the computer animation began.The DVD includes both the original Japanese version (with English subtitles available) as well as an English dubbed version. The English dubbing is extremely well done, with top notch talent including Anna Paquin (Rogue from the XMen movies) as the adolescent boy hero, Patrick Stewart as his grandfather, and Alfred Molina as his father. The English dubbing was overseen by Otomo himself, and is arguably better suited to the story than the original Japanese, as it is set in Victorian England. There are, however, a few moments where the words do not quite mesh with the mouth movements--which is a bit of a testament to the quality of the animation; in most animated films, you can't tell what language the characters are supposed to be speaking, anyway.Although this is an animated film, it is not a kid's movie, and some parents will probably find some scenes inappropriate for small children.

O'Sullivan,"[5, 10]","STEAMBOY is a brilliant failure.Like it's beloved cogs, gears and steam - STEAMBOY manages to run, but it never really runs at full power.  THE ROCKETEER did this better, while the LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN already sold us on the biggest problem with STEAMBOY... the message, and it's this message that grounds STEAMBOY well before the film has even gotten started.  To bring it to a boil for you quickly - they don't call it an ""arms race"" because it sounds keen.  This is a movie about science and technology and the precarious balance between its use to enlighten and advance the human race (THE GREAT EXHIBITION), or to enslave it (WAR MACHINES).  STEAMBOY is caught on the horns of an age old problem - the same power I use to write this review also is used to execute people, or restart a heart, or light up the night.  Power is power - it's neither good or evil, but can be used by those that would wish to do one or the other... and it's this point that STEAMBOY manages to display in some of the most beautiful and detailed artwork I've seen in a long time.  But by now the films heartfelt message is only preaching to the choir - we got it, we've seen it, it's old news.And while STEAMBOY never made any promises, it was sold as a different film all together.  If you're a fan of TOM SWIFT then STEAMBOY will send more than a few chills up and down your spine - it's so close to the tone of those first SWIFT adventures as to make you nearly drool.  THE ROCKETEER is here as well, and while that film can't lay claim to being anything but a homage to past Rockeeters', STEAMBOY does pay its respects to the DISNEY film in several small ways.  Little funny moments and in jokes are scattered all through this film (my hands down favorite is ""Pregnant"" Ray - during the very exciting train attack - watch for Ray sticking the Steam Ball down his shirt, and later during a quiet moment before he's kidnapped, he is standing on the train looking for all the world as if he's in his ninth month - and then watch him rub the Steam Ball like a baby - the visual is very clear and funny here... Ray is about to give birth to a whole new world.  The Steam Ball is one baby that's going to change everything).STEAMBOY is a divided film - clearly they wanted the message of the film to be front and center, but you can't help but wish they had minimized this and instead gave us more of Ray being STEAMBOY.  It's shocking that the film I really wanted to see could only be seen during the closing credits.  All the action, romance and adventure I desired was all but hidden and being slowly clawed to death by the cast and production lists.The US voice cast is excellent, while the orginal language track delivers STEAMBOY's original passion, and the subtitles both add more information and also leave out important facts (if you get the chance, listen to the US voice cast and read the subtitles - it's like two different movies at certain points).In the end - there's not a frame of STEAMBOY that does not draw you into its world.  It's packed with brilliant ideas, performances, and two big payoffs - the first being what can be called as the first Steam Ice Age, and the second - the closing credits behind which the real STEAMBOY's heart truly beats.",2,JAMMING,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3262,"['STEAMBOY', 'brilliant', 'failure.Like', 'beloved', 'cogs', 'gears', 'steam', 'STEAMBOY', 'run', 'never', 'really', 'full', 'power', 'THE', 'ROCKETEER', 'did', 'better', 'LEAGUE', 'OF', 'EXTRAORDINARY', 'GENTLEMEN', 'already', 'sold', 'biggest', 'problem', 'STEAMBOY', 'message', 'message', 'STEAMBOY', 'well', 'film', 'even', 'gotten', 'started', 'bring', 'boil', 'quickly', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'arms', 'race', 'keen', 'movie', 'science', 'technology', 'precarious', 'balance', 'use', 'enlighten', 'advance', 'human', 'race', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'EXHIBITION', 'enslave', 'WAR', 'MACHINES', 'STEAMBOY', 'caught', 'horns', 'age', 'old', 'problem', 'same', 'power', 'use', 'write', 'review', 'also', 'used', 'execute', 'people', 'restart', 'heart', 'light', 'up', 'night', 'Power', 'power', 'good', 'evil', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'would', 'wish', 'do', 'one', 'other', 'point', 'STEAMBOY', 'display', 'most', 'beautiful', 'detailed', 'artwork', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'films', 'heartfelt', 'message', 'only', 'preaching', 'choir', 'got', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'old', 'news.And', 'STEAMBOY', 'never', 'made', 'promises', 'was', 'sold', 'different', 'film', 'together', ""'re"", 'fan', 'TOM', 'SWIFT', 'then', 'STEAMBOY', 'will', 'send', 'more', 'few', 'chills', 'up', 'down', 'spine', 'so', 'close', 'tone', 'first', 'SWIFT', 'make', 'nearly', 'drool', 'ROCKETEER', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lay', 'claim', 'being', 'anything', 'homage', 'past', 'Rockeeters', 'STEAMBOY', 'pay', 'respects', 'DISNEY', 'film', 'several', 'small', 'ways', 'Little', 'funny', 'moments', 'jokes', 'are', 'scattered', 'film', 'hands', 'down', 'favorite', 'Pregnant', 'Ray', 'very', 'exciting', 'train', 'attack', 'watch', 'Ray', 'sticking', 'Steam', 'Ball', 'down', 'shirt', 'later', 'quiet', 'moment', 'kidnapped', 'standing', 'train', 'looking', 'world', 'ninth', 'month', 'then', 'watch', 'rub', 'Steam', 'Ball', 'baby', 'visual', 'very', 'clear', 'funny', 'here', 'Ray', 'give', 'birth', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'Steam', 'Ball', 'one', 'baby', 'going', 'change', 'everything', '.STEAMBOY', 'divided', 'film', 'clearly', 'wanted', 'message', 'film', 'be', 'front', 'center', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wish', 'had', 'minimized', 'instead', 'gave', 'more', 'Ray', 'being', 'STEAMBOY', 'shocking', 'film', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'closing', 'credits', 'action', 'romance', 'adventure', 'desired', 'was', 'hidden', 'being', 'slowly', 'clawed', 'death', 'cast', 'production', 'lists.The', 'US', 'voice', 'cast', 'excellent', 'orginal', 'language', 'track', 'STEAMBOY', 'original', 'passion', 'subtitles', 'add', 'more', 'information', 'also', 'leave', 'out', 'important', 'facts', 'get', 'chance', 'listen', 'US', 'voice', 'cast', 'read', 'subtitles', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'certain', 'points', '.In', 'end', 'not', 'frame', 'STEAMBOY', 'not', 'draw', 'world', 'packed', 'brilliant', 'ideas', 'performances', 'two', 'big', 'payoffs', 'first', 'being', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'first', 'Steam', 'Ice', 'Age', 'second', 'closing', 'credits', 'real', 'STEAMBOY', 'heart', 'truly', 'beats']",Steamboy: Director's Cut

All I can say on that is, WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.I don't know about the DVD version, as I watched this in the theatre, but one thing's for sure; I will NOT rent/buy this DVD; the movie hits an all-time low from the very beginning. Why couldn't they dub this film in English????? It's not very realistic, seeing a bunch of ENGLISH people in ENGLAND speaking JAPANESE!!! The plot seems to wander aimlessly round and round so much my head spins just thinking about it...until we meet our alleged heroine, Scarlett O'Hara (what are they trying to point out here? Or was her naming just an uncanny coincidence?)who shamelessly displays animal cruelty on her poor, helpless little chihuahua. Needless to say, I loathed her from the very beginning. Being a rich, spoilt brat, she did not warm my heart, failing to play the part of a ""heroine"". Plus, the relationship between Ray Steam (like the pun?) and Scarlett did not build: there was one point where they seemed to be a bit 'different' so to speak, and that, apart from wowing at the graphics, was probably the best part of the movie. Other that that, I came out of the theatre very irritated and almost deaf: the volume was insanely high...I couldn't even catch up on some sleep!

The attention to detail is amazing and the look of the steam-powered technology really does blend rather well with the somewhat victorian setting. Overall, it's a pretty impressive film, even if it drags in some areas. A five out of five for the movie by itself.However, the dub is what really kills it. I would be willing to say that about 60% of the characters dubbed voices match the characters themselves. Yes, that includes Patrick Stewart and Alfred Molina. It's the voices of the young boys that kills it.In the original Japanese film, women voiced the boys. This is a common practice, and actually in the Japanese version, the voices fit pretty well. It's the voice actresses they have for the English dub that don't even come close.On a personal note, I had a very hard time buying into the idea that those were the voices of young boys. Sony should have played it safe and had young actors in that age group do the voices.The main protagonist, James Steam (Steamboy), was dubbed by Anna Paquin. If the fact that her voice sticks out like a sore thumb doesn't do it, the bad british accent will.This is definately one you will want to watch subtitled with the original Japanese voices. It makes the movie that much more enjoyable. I would reccomend it if you don't mind reading subtitles.-Matt",4,Really good movie.

Although the movie is set in Victorian England, it's thoroughly Japanese. For one thing, the metal monster tears up the city in the big finale - this time, the city is London. It's a good story, though, with an enticing bit of sequel-bait at the end.The animation is all you could hope for. I'm convinced Otomo picked Victorian technology because it's so visually understandable, so easy to respond to. A silicon chip may have far more potential in it, but huge clashing gears, striking sparks as they engage, project a tangible sense of power. Voice commands to a computer could have consequences of any magnitude, but it means a lot more to see human muscle wrestling against a giant lever.The good vs. bad technology issue is drawn without subtlety, but probably works at a level that kids can approach. It's kid-friendly in other ways, too: there's some violence, but bloodless, people keep their clothes on, and some ugly realities of steam technology have been tamed. Pipes and boilers burst a few times in the movie, but no one really gets hurt by it - when that happened in the real world, people died in horrific ways.It's not Akira, but rises to Akira's standards in every way.
