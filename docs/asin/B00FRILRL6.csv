Of course, the acting is great, because of the talent and skills actors put in this movie. It's their job, so it is obvious that they do their best in whatever movie it might be. Why I didn't like this movie? Because it's nothing new, funny, worth telling others or worth using any lessons from the movie. The story line is very weak and worthless. On the other hand I should admit that directing of the movie is not bad, it's very good. My judgement of this movie is not based on the movie itself. I always like to see something valuable in the movie apart the movie creation itself. There was a time in my life when I was watching a lot of movies and then I decided that it's enough to waste my time watching other people's lives. For me it's not enough just to watch the movie, I want to take something away for myself.

After watching those movies, and other comedies starring De Niro, like the Meet the Parents series, this movie actually disappointed me.  It has some dry/dark humorous parts, though not a laugh out loud type of movie, more of a smirk.  Also, overall, the movie is pretty good, with a nice and suspenseful plot, however (without giving away the ending) the ending of the movie is actually rather ridiculous and way too staged.  I think they had a fairly amusing movie throughout,and the last 20 minutes or so they just smashed together not knowing what else to do.

It co-stars Michelle Pfeiffer, Dianna Agron and John D'Leo as his wife and kids, plus Tommy Lee Jones as the agent charged with protecting them.After De Niro testifies against a mob boss, he and his family are targeted for assassination. They're placed in Witness Protection and bounced from location to place because one of them is always blowing their cover. Their latest home is a village in Normandy, France where the locals don't take kindly to rough-edged interlopers from Brooklyn.The surprises come fast in this picture. It seems wife and teens are as prone to violence as De Niro is, maybe more so. The first day they're in town, Pfeiffer is insulted at a local grocer's and she firebombs the place! The daughter has her pencilbox stolen by another girl, and she beats the kid senseless with bare fists. The boy is attacked in school by a gang, so he organizes his own posse and they thrash the bullies. Meanwhile, De Niro, a shut-in who's trying to write his Mafia memoirs, hospitalizes anyone he feels has disrespected him. That includes the town's only plumber and the head of a local chemical plant that's turning the water supply brown.The story really gets crazy when something the son wrote for a school newsletter makes its circuitous way, essentially as a piece of trash, right to the Mafia Don who's looking for De Niro, a 4,000 mile journey.This one has a thrilling finale, a shootout where the family's outnumbered.A comedy only in the darkest sense, THE FAMILY works best as the exaggerated domestic side of the gangster film genre.",4,"Next-door neighbors from Hell, NY",1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,1688,"['Written', 'directed', 'Luc', 'Beeson', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'USA/France-2013', 'definite', 'winner', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'best', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'co-stars', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Dianna', 'Agron', 'John', ""D'Leo"", 'wife', 'kids', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'agent', 'charged', 'protecting', 'them.After', 'De', 'Niro', 'testifies', 'mob', 'boss', 'family', 'are', 'targeted', 'assassination', ""'re"", 'placed', 'Witness', 'Protection', 'bounced', 'location', 'place', 'one', 'always', 'blowing', 'cover', 'latest', 'home', 'village', 'Normandy', 'France', 'where', 'locals', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'kindly', 'rough-edged', 'interlopers', 'Brooklyn.The', 'surprises', 'come', 'fast', 'picture', 'wife', 'teens', 'are', 'prone', 'violence', 'De', 'Niro', 'maybe', 'more', 'so', 'first', 'day', ""'re"", 'town', 'Pfeiffer', 'insulted', 'local', 'grocer', 'firebombs', 'place', 'daughter', 'pencilbox', 'stolen', 'girl', 'kid', 'senseless', 'bare', 'fists', 'boy', 'attacked', 'school', 'gang', 'own', 'posse', 'thrash', 'bullies', 'Meanwhile', 'De', 'Niro', 'shut-in', 'who', 'trying', 'write', 'Mafia', 'memoirs', 'anyone', 'disrespected', 'town', 'only', 'plumber', 'head', 'local', 'chemical', 'plant', 'turning', 'water', 'supply', 'brown.The', 'story', 'really', 'crazy', 'when', 'something', 'son', 'wrote', 'school', 'newsletter', 'circuitous', 'way', 'essentially', 'piece', 'trash', 'right', 'Mafia', 'Don', 'who', 'looking', 'De', 'Niro', '4,000', 'mile', 'journey.This', 'one', 'thrilling', 'finale', 'shootout', 'where', 'family', 'outnumbered.A', 'comedy', 'only', 'darkest', 'sense', 'THE', 'FAMILY', 'best', 'exaggerated', 'domestic', 'side', 'gangster', 'film', 'genre']",The Family

Many American movie actors are going abroad to film their action movies these days and for the most part, they&#8217;ve all been pretty terrible; for instance, &#34;Live Free or Die Hard&#34;, &#34;Taken 2&#34;, &#34;From Paris with Love&#34; and &#34;The Cold Light of Day&#34;, two of which Luc Besson had a part in. So, does &#34;The Family&#34; fall into that mold?DeNiro plays Giovanni Manzoni, a mobster in the witness protection program that turned on his cronies and is now a heavily monitored and frequent mover. His family, Maggie, Belle and Warren are products of their father. They have learned a few things about getting what they want and defending themselves. With their new home in Normandy, France, they struggle to hide their nature.The movie trailer plays into the movies comedy and the description of the movie leads with the word comedy. While I found a lot of the movie pretty funny, I think it is important to not go into the movie expecting to be humored like one of our American version crude comedies. Go into &#34;The Family&#34; not knowing what to expect and you&#8217;ll find that it tackles many genres of film and has a good range of comedy, action, drama, and to top it off, some quality suspense.To be honest, some of Luc Besson&#8217;s earlier films are some of my favorite movies I&#8217;ve ever seen because those movies had amazing characters and great personality. Besson, lately though, has had a tendency to overwhelm the viewer with relentless shooting from cruddy characters who you could care less about. This is thankfully not the case in &#34;The Family&#34;. While pretty much everybody in the film has a layer of &#8216;crud&#8217; to them, you begin to see an interesting thing develop as the movie plays out; a redeeming nature to the crud.Go into &#34;The Family&#34; expecting to see a comedy and you may be disappointed. This is Luc Besson&#8217;s homage to the gangster personality. He couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better man to walk in the lead characters role in DeNiro. In fact, the film also pays homage to one of DeNiro&#8217;s finest movies, &#34;Goodfellas&#34;. This isn&#8217;t the Coen&#8217;s &#34;Miller&#8217;s Crossing&#34;, but the mood of the film may be similar. It isn&#8217;t a comedy. It is a gangster film that isn&#8217;t afraid to make you laugh, cry and lean forward in your seat as the stuff starts to go down.",4,If you think you're going to see a comedy... it will DISAPPOINT.,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,2685,"['was', 'good', 'move', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'return', 'something', 'mobsterish', 'turn', 'bottom', 'yearly', 'movie', 'list', '34', 'Big', 'Wedding', '34', '34', 'Family', '34', 'comedy/crime', 'drama', 'well-known', 'action', 'director', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Leon', 'Professional', 'Taken', 'Many', 'American', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'going', 'abroad', 'film', 'action', 'movies', 'days', 'most', 'part', '8217', 'been', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'instance', '34', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', '34', '34', 'Taken', '2', '34', '34', 'From', 'Paris', 'Love', '34', '34', 'Cold', 'Light', 'Day', '34', 'two', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'had', 'part', 'So', '34', 'Family', '34', 'fall', 'mold', 'DeNiro', 'Giovanni', 'Manzoni', 'mobster', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'turned', 'cronies', 'now', 'heavily', 'monitored', 'frequent', 'mover', 'family', 'Maggie', 'Belle', 'Warren', 'are', 'products', 'father', 'have', 'learned', 'few', 'things', 'getting', 'what', 'want', 'defending', 'new', 'home', 'Normandy', 'France', 'struggle', 'hide', 'nature.The', 'movie', 'trailer', 'movies', 'comedy', 'description', 'movie', 'word', 'comedy', 'found', 'lot', 'movie', 'pretty', 'funny', 'think', 'important', 'not', 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'humored', 'one', 'American', 'version', 'crude', 'comedies', 'Go', '34', 'Family', '34', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', '8217', 'find', 'many', 'genres', 'film', 'good', 'range', 'comedy', 'action', 'drama', 'top', 'off', 'quality', 'suspense.To', 'be', 'honest', 'Luc', 'Besson', '8217', 's', 'earlier', 'films', 'are', 'favorite', 'movies', '8217', 'ever', 'seen', 'movies', 'had', 'amazing', 'characters', 'great', 'personality', 'Besson', 'lately', 'had', 'tendency', 'overwhelm', 'viewer', 'relentless', 'shooting', 'cruddy', 'characters', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'about', 'thankfully', 'not', 'case', '34', 'Family', '34', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'film', 'layer', '8216', 'crud', '8217', 'begin', 'see', 'interesting', 'thing', 'develop', 'movie', 'out', 'redeeming', 'nature', 'crud.Go', '34', 'Family', '34', 'expecting', 'see', 'comedy', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Luc', 'Besson', '8217', 's', 'homage', 'gangster', 'personality', 'couldn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'asked', 'better', 'man', 'walk', 'lead', 'characters', 'role', 'DeNiro', 'fact', 'film', 'also', 'homage', 'one', 'DeNiro', '8217', 'finest', 'movies', '34', 'Goodfellas', '34', 'isn', '8217', 'Coen', '8217', '34', 'Miller', '8217', 'Crossing', '34', 'mood', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'similar', '8217', 'comedy', 'gangster', 'film', 'isn', '8217', 'afraid', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'lean', 'forward', 'seat', 'stuff', 'go', 'down']",The Family

If they took Henry Hill from Goodfellas and Christopher from The Sopranos, wrapped those two characters together and told us what happened long after Henry Hill was relocated in Arizona, you would have this highly European flavored story.If you like mob movies, this one is for you. Robert De Niro's acting, narration and his character is both highly believable and a good role for one of the greatest actors of my generation. Nice to see him in something with a dark humor rather than many of the roles he has taken lately in comedy.Michelle Pfeiffer provides us with a nice counter point to De Niro and sizzles on the screen at 55 years old. She was quite a pleasure in this role and like Susan Sarandon and Sigourney Weaver, she goes on to prove that there is still a place in today's 20 something laden movie world for a mature actress.The best of the writing is the great use of the universal adjective and an explanation from the son in &#34;The Family&#34; on why that, the F-bomb is not the word most know it as. But instead a summation of something much greater when used in the way screenwriters Luc Besson (director)  and Michael Caleo take it, use F$%* very wisely and with it like a spice--to season--this movie to great use.Watch for a few Sopranos alumni and of course &#34;Big Pussy Bonpensiero&#34; amongst them.",5,What A Fun Little Movie,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,1481,"['Fun', 'fast', 'very', 'pleasing', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'violence', 'great', 'look', 'life', 'mob', 'capo', 'end', 'rather', 'beginning', 'took', 'Henry', 'Hill', 'Goodfellas', 'Christopher', 'Sopranos', 'wrapped', 'two', 'characters', 'together', 'told', 'what', 'happened', 'long', 'Henry', 'Hill', 'was', 'relocated', 'Arizona', 'would', 'have', 'highly', 'European', 'flavored', 'story.If', 'mob', 'movies', 'one', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'acting', 'narration', 'character', 'highly', 'believable', 'good', 'role', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'generation', 'Nice', 'see', 'something', 'dark', 'humor', 'rather', 'many', 'roles', 'taken', 'lately', 'comedy.Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'nice', 'counter', 'point', 'De', 'Niro', 'sizzles', 'screen', '55', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'quite', 'pleasure', 'role', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'prove', 'still', 'place', 'today', '20', 'something', 'laden', 'movie', 'world', 'mature', 'actress.The', 'best', 'writing', 'great', 'use', 'universal', 'adjective', 'explanation', 'son', '34', 'Family', '34', 'why', 'F-bomb', 'not', 'word', 'most', 'know', 'instead', 'summation', 'something', 'much', 'greater', 'when', 'used', 'way', 'screenwriters', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'director', 'Michael', 'Caleo', 'take', 'use', 'F', '%', '*', 'very', 'wisely', 'spice', 'season', 'movie', 'great', 'use.Watch', 'few', 'Sopranos', 'alumni', 'course', '34', 'Big', 'Pussy', 'Bonpensiero', '34', 'amongst']",The Family

1673018,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00FRILRL6,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 8]","Known for bringing a hip edge to populist genre pictures that focus mainly on high-octane action with a heavy dose of U.S.-influenced pop culture, Luc Besson is a French filmmaker who directed some terrifically audacious films in the nineties (1994'sL&eacute;on: The Professional, 1997'sThe Fifth Element) but has largely focused on producing and writing since the millennium. He comes back to the director's chair with this 2013 mob comedy which bears his signature mark of extreme, almost fanatical violence within the context of a story that already feels unsettled as neither a crime melodrama nor a family situation comedy. With a screenplay co-written with Michael Caleo, Besson has made a tonally unbalanced film whose primary saving grace is an adroit cast headed by Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer. Neither is a stranger to this milieu as they appear to play extensions of characters they've already played inGoodfellas(which is given a cheeky nod in the plot) andMarried to the Mob. That's fine by me since both bring a world-weary finesse to their portrayals that elevate the cartoonish movie into something close to human if not quite humane.The fancifully graphic story focuses on Giovanni Manzoni, his wife Maggie, their daughter Belle and their son Warren. He is a second-generation mobster who decides to turn state's evidence against Don Luchese, a Brooklyn crime kingpin. After a failed attempt to rub out Manzoni at a family barbecue, Luchese is sent to prison, and in turn, the Manzoni tribe enters the Witness Protection Program where they end up being renamed the Blakes and relocating from the south of France to a village in Normandy. Each family member has trouble fitting in because they all share the same volatile temper and the same immoral sensibility to solve any problem with brutalizing violence. Manzoni is Fred Blake who pretends to be a history author writing about the Normandy landings and beats up a plumber who tries to rip him off. In my favorite scene of the movie, Maggie blows up a local grocery store when the proprietor and local customers make fun of American vulgarity in French. Belle pummels a would-be lothario with a tennis racket after he tricks her into joining him and his buddies for a not-so-innocent picnic. Warren seeks revenge against the local school bullies by creating a confederacy of outcasts with sought-after skills and connections.All their proclivities come to a head when Luchese discovers their whereabouts through the most contrived of circumstances. De Niro can play this type of role in his sleep, but credit him for not making this another Fockers sleepfest as he brings genuine warmth to a character that finds a cathartic release in his newfound purpose in writing his memoirs. Even in her bleached blond flashbacks, Pfeiffer displays her shopworn beauty with little vanity and manages to create an empathetic character out of what could have been a shrewish caricature. Tommy Lee Jones plays exactly to type as the stoic agent who leads the protection detail for Manzoni.Gleealumnus Dianna Agron brings a refreshing calmness to the role of a bad girl who is at heart a soulful teen falling in love for the first time while never forgetting her obligation to the family. John D'Leo fits well into the deadpan demeanor of a been-there, done-that kid brother as Warren. But Besson just doesn't know how to mesh the considerable comic chops of his core cast with the violence he wants to showcase, especially in the final gun battle sequence, which would have been fine in a straight-ahead actioner but just refuses to bring this truly absurdist movie together. It's a marginal disappointment considering all who is involved in this production including executive producer Martin Scorsese.",3,Disparate Elements Refuse to Gel in Besson's Absurdist Mob Comedy,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,3768,"['Known', 'bringing', 'hip', 'edge', 'populist', 'genre', 'pictures', 'focus', 'mainly', 'high-octane', 'action', 'heavy', 'dose', 'U.S.-influenced', 'pop', 'culture', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'French', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'directed', 'terrifically', 'audacious', 'films', 'nineties', ""1994'sL"", 'eacute', 'Professional', ""1997'sThe"", 'Fifth', 'Element', 'largely', 'focused', 'producing', 'writing', 'millennium', 'back', 'director', 'chair', '2013', 'mob', 'comedy', 'signature', 'mark', 'extreme', 'almost', 'fanatical', 'violence', 'context', 'story', 'already', 'unsettled', 'crime', 'melodrama', 'family', 'situation', 'comedy', 'screenplay', 'co-written', 'Michael', 'Caleo', 'Besson', 'made', 'tonally', 'unbalanced', 'film', 'primary', 'saving', 'grace', 'adroit', 'cast', 'headed', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'stranger', 'milieu', 'appear', 'play', 'extensions', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'already', 'played', 'inGoodfellas', 'given', 'cheeky', 'nod', 'plot', 'andMarried', 'Mob', 'fine', 'bring', 'world-weary', 'finesse', 'portrayals', 'elevate', 'cartoonish', 'movie', 'something', 'close', 'human', 'not', 'quite', 'humane.The', 'fancifully', 'graphic', 'story', 'focuses', 'Giovanni', 'Manzoni', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'daughter', 'Belle', 'son', 'Warren', 'second-generation', 'mobster', 'who', 'turn', 'state', 'evidence', 'Don', 'Luchese', 'Brooklyn', 'crime', 'kingpin', 'failed', 'attempt', 'rub', 'out', 'Manzoni', 'family', 'barbecue', 'Luchese', 'sent', 'prison', 'turn', 'Manzoni', 'tribe', 'Witness', 'Protection', 'Program', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'renamed', 'Blakes', 'relocating', 'south', 'France', 'village', 'Normandy', 'family', 'member', 'trouble', 'fitting', 'share', 'same', 'volatile', 'temper', 'same', 'immoral', 'sensibility', 'solve', 'problem', 'brutalizing', 'violence', 'Manzoni', 'Fred', 'Blake', 'who', 'be', 'history', 'author', 'writing', 'Normandy', 'landings', 'up', 'plumber', 'who', 'rip', 'off', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'Maggie', 'up', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'when', 'proprietor', 'local', 'customers', 'make', 'fun', 'American', 'vulgarity', 'French', 'Belle', 'would-be', 'lothario', 'tennis', 'racket', 'joining', 'buddies', 'not-so-innocent', 'picnic', 'Warren', 'revenge', 'local', 'school', 'bullies', 'creating', 'confederacy', 'outcasts', 'sought-after', 'skills', 'connections.All', 'proclivities', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'Luchese', 'discovers', 'whereabouts', 'most', 'contrived', 'circumstances', 'De', 'Niro', 'can', 'play', 'type', 'role', 'sleep', 'credit', 'not', 'making', 'Fockers', 'sleepfest', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'character', 'cathartic', 'release', 'newfound', 'purpose', 'writing', 'memoirs', 'Even', 'bleached', 'blond', 'flashbacks', 'Pfeiffer', 'shopworn', 'beauty', 'little', 'vanity', 'manages', 'create', 'empathetic', 'character', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shrewish', 'caricature', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'exactly', 'type', 'stoic', 'agent', 'who', 'protection', 'detail', 'Manzoni.Gleealumnus', 'Dianna', 'Agron', 'refreshing', 'calmness', 'role', 'bad', 'girl', 'who', 'heart', 'soulful', 'teen', 'falling', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'never', 'forgetting', 'obligation', 'family', 'John', ""D'Leo"", 'well', 'deadpan', 'demeanor', 'been-there', 'done-that', 'kid', 'brother', 'Warren', 'Besson', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'mesh', 'considerable', 'comic', 'chops', 'core', 'cast', 'violence', 'showcase', 'especially', 'final', 'gun', 'battle', 'sequence', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'straight-ahead', 'actioner', 'just', 'refuses', 'bring', 'truly', 'absurdist', 'movie', 'together', 'marginal', 'disappointment', 'considering', 'who', 'involved', 'production', 'including', 'executive', 'producer', 'Martin', 'Scorsese']",The Family

Adapted from Tonino Benacquista's novel by both Beeson and Michael Caleo this cinematic outing blends American gangsters, a witness protection gangster's family with out of country FBI agents and places the action in Normandy, France and the result is an at times brutal tale while at other times an examination of a family made dysfunctional by the father's past, with a lot of secondary plots that bring increased interest to the plot.The Manzoni family (father Giovanni - Robert DeNiro, mother Maggie - Michelle Pfeiffer, daughter Belle - Dianna Agron, and son Warren - John D'Leo) is relocated to a sleepy town in Normandy, France under the witness protection program after snitching on the mob. Despite the best efforts of CIA Agent Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones) to keep them in line, Manzoni and his wife and their children can't help but revert to old habits and blow their cover by handling their problems the ""family"" way, enabling their former mafia cronies to track them down. Each member of this strangely close and devoted family takes punishment of outside harassing victims into their own hands, a sweet love affair ensues with Belle and her math coach, and an innocent clipping made for the school newspaper by Warren leads to the Mafia attempt to destroy the family once and for all.  Yes there are funny moments in the smart script, but this is more a drama than a comedy - a film noir. The acting by DeNiro, Pfeiffer, Agron and D'Leo (a real discovery!) is first class. A lot of killing goes on, but the film is so well directed and acted that it is a fine evening's entertainment.

Or alternatively provided more occasions of the delving out justice to racists, jerks and would be rapists which were very enjoyable viewing.  Who hasn't been in a store while travelling (especially in France) where locals thinking you don't understand their language start making derogatory and racist remarks about yourself or your race.  Only to grovel like cowards when one of your group tells them off fluently in their own language.  Well Michelle Pfeiffer playing the mob mother, goes one step better than this at a supermarket.  As does Diana Agron when four boys drive her out of town and expect certain favours to bring her back.  In fact Agron surprisingly plays her probably best most meatiest role and furthest away from her Glee cheerleader yet.  I wasn't expecting much from her, but she was probably the best character of the whole mob family.  John D'Leo also doesn't do a bad job as the son, I have to admit I'd never heard of him before this film.  Robert De Niro as the mob father also delves out justice to a plumber who turns up late and tries to rip him off and others throughout the film.  That's pretty much what the film is, sort of a fantasy of what you'd like to do to those who do bad things to you but know you can't as in real life there are consequences.  Sort of like Michael Dougas' character in Falling Down.Granted this film isn't believable at all.  Even if this family wasn't on the witness protection program, and know these actions would bring unwanted attention, no one could do them in real life and get away with it.  But that's what makes Family, fun viewing.  It did need though to lessen the in between the encounters with locals scenes as they were a bit boring.

But it had good actors in it, so I and we decided to go see it.  It was one of the oddest movies I have ever seen.  It was so violent.  Not just the husband, who was in the mob.  But the wife and their two kids also.  When they got mad, they would just beat the hell out of people.  At the same time, it was also funny.  In a dark comedy sort of way.  I laughed a bunch of times.  It was really about a man who was in the mob, who snitched and was now in hiding.It has Tommy Lee Jones, who I did not know was in the movie.  The acting was great from all the actors.  But it was an odd movie.  My mom said it best.  It was the type of movie that you will either love or hate.  I liked it very much.  I think something else that made it different, is that it was not filmed in the US.  Well, it was not supposed to be in the US.  I've no clue the location it was actually filmed.  But you can see the man trying to live his life as if he were a normal man and not from the mob.  He thinks twice about killing two people, but then it comes back and you see he was just thinking about it and did not do it.Some things did not really work well.  Like his daughter getting so upset that a guy did not want to run away with her.  She thought he was her first true love.  Just because of the way his eyes looked to her.  Then the thing she was going to do after it all was way to crazy.  Then the son wanting to leave when he was under 18 to join the family.  I mean, if his father was so wanted by the mob and all they wanted to do was kill him and his family.  How in the hell was his son expecting to go join?

It's especially nice to see Robert DeNiro under acting- giving his character Giovanni a wry, weary realism in the midst of a basically out-of control family.  Michelle Pfeiffer is a gem as the wisecracking female counterpart to DeNiro and Tommy Lee Jones basically reprises a the sardonic and straight laced Agent K from the Men in Black films.However (and this is a big one) the rest of ""The Family"" is an uneven, unexplainable, unbelievable mess of a comedy/drama/thriller.  Director Besson would have been served well to eschew tightroping the thematic percentages and go with one genre or another. Is this a comedy? No.  A thriller? No. A classic Mafia tale? No.  So as a result the, scattershot thematic execution of the screenplay results in a meandering, inconsistent mess of a film where each of the family members has an opportunity to show how bad*ss they can be in not conforming with the French locals.So instead of feeling the least bit of empathy for this witness protected American mob family we're convinced over and over that they operate on their own terms, regardless of location, and that the teenage (??) kids have synthesized their gangster father's violent tendencies into their own brand of sociopathic behavior.  The violent behavior by mom, daughter, son, and father are exaggerated and unnecessary and serve only to highlight an incredibly thin plot.To make matters worse, Besson basically ignores the lovely French locations lending the film a bland and generically ""European"" feeling.  At the same time Besson has spares no opportunity to allow village inhabitants a chance to spew vapid anti-American insults which serve only to inflame DeNiro's violent clan even more.  In one especially hideous display of unprovoked violence the daughter (played by Dianna Agron) unleashes a viciously disproportionate tennis racket assault on a testosterone fueled oaf.Were ""The Family"" not well acted it'd merit a half star.

1673176,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00FRILRL6,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 0]","checked this movie out from the library because love Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfieffer, didn't know what it was about except vaguely about a mob family in Europe, hadn't seen the previews, thought it was a comedy. it's not a comedy, kind of a mob movie with comedic overtones. liked it sort of, hard not to in parts as story is presented as a new family setting up house in a new town, and they don't bother anyone unless they're bothered. that sounds okay, except it's not. I actually thought the kids' reactions were pretty fair given that they're teenagers and it made sense for the son to beat up the guy who viciously beat him. the parents, on the other hand, couldn't behave rationally and had short fuses in the face of ordinary rudeness from average citizens. both De Niro and Pfieffer's characters overreact violently to mistreatment by strangers, i.e., one or the other doesn't take kindly to snide remarks about Americans by local French citizens, don't appreciate being gouged by a plumber, want clean drinking water and are willing to beat people to get it, and when they're given the runaround have no problem showing their displeasure, which they do excessively violently. they never seem to count the cost or indeed suffer any significant consequence for their extremely antisocial behaviors. you heard the phrase, two wrongs don't make a right? well, that's this couple personified. in the real world, federal protection plan or no federal protection plan, the De Niro/Pfeiffer characters would be imprisoned for years for the behaviors they demonstrate in this film.  it makes sense that characters who were apparently top of the food chain in their business wouldn't suffer fools gladly, but they come across as psychopaths with no self-control. the problem is that the parents' behavior as individuals is so over the top you wonder how they can effectively parent or be any kind of role model to their kids. in the real world, when you read about people in the news who, for example, conceal carry, and who pull out a gun and shoot an unarmed person during an ordinary dispute, like someone stealing your parking spot, these film parents are that type of person. they dispense ""justice"" immediately as if they are god.  the writer tries to protect them by showing that they initiate no violence but merely respond to disrespect/discourtesy, but in a world where the nation suffers school/mall/theater shooting seemingly monthly, if not weekly, it'd be better if Hollywood would reconsider what it's putting out into the world about how film characters settle their disputes. not blaming Hollywood, just saying if the American flag can be put in films, and propaganda can run through films (as it does here, in my opinion, when De Niro's character says, paraphrasing, his federal agent is so straight he'd turn in his own mother if she cheated on her income tax statement), why not show interesting, nonviolent ways stars can solve disagreements. why not give something useful, along with entertainment. the kids were written better because they for the most part dealt violence to violence: the daughter wasn't about to be raped when she beat up the young man, though you could see where the situation was heading; her beat down of the young man would've played better had she run away and he chased and caught her: she was somewhat anticipatory with her smackdown (as the teen merely touched her shoulder with his finger), but at least she didn't shoot him. given the way the story was written, I was actually surprised, and relieved, when the daughter didn't have the young teacher she desired wacked or harmed when he rejected her. all the actors were good. totally unbelievable that the feds would put up with the shenanigans of this family, whether they were originally in the federal witness program or not, can't see the government continuing to protect them. what I did like was that the parents prepared their kids, as the kids clearly could take care of themselves. another unbelievable point: the family was made up of violent individuals, yet were kind and loving to one another. so, overall, I liked the film for the acting and touches of comedy, but couldn't totally enjoy it due to the parents lack of self-control and also unbelievable that the government would continue protecting them given the family's propensity to harm others.  2 and a half stars.",2,a family who believes in pushback

With huge star power and a well known Director, this film had all the makings of a classic, unfortunately it has some major plot holes and lacks direction. One moment it seems like you're watching a comedy, that is about to break out, but then in the blink of an eye it's a drama, addressing difficult issues. The big tagline is that the Manzoni family is in hiding, and can't seem to behave themselves, but it's a lot more than that. The FBI has decided to place this Italian, Brooklyn mob family in the south of France. Even if their behavior wasn't outlandish, how is a Brooklyn family supposed to fit into a small village in France? They would naturally stand out like a sore thumb. Besides the obvious plot holes, other things are left out of the equation, the most glaring being the back story behind the families joining the program. While the story is all over the place, the film does feature a truly all-star cast and trust me, they help. If this wasn't De Niro, Jones, and Pheiffer, the film would have completely fallen apart and failed to hold my interest. The fact is that these are some the best actors in the world and they all do a tremendous job of keeping the audiences attention. There isn't much of a story here and it's nowhere near as funny as it was advertised to be, but big names and great performances fill seats in the theaters and that should have been this films hook.

The question they really should have asked was, what happens when it's all over?&#34; After Giovanni (De Niro) a high ranking mobster turns state's evidence him and his family are relocated (again) to Normandy, France. The only problem is that between him, his wife Maggie (Pfeiffer) and their two kids have a hard time adjusting to the normal life. After an innocent act allows their past to catch up with them they must confront it head on. I have said before that De Niro is a great actor but will do just about anything. From the young Godfather to Fearless Leader or a Vietnam vet to a gay pirate he does have incredible range. With him doing so many movies there are going to be many hits and misses. While this movie is pretty much what I expected it's nothing amazing. It's not a straight up mob comedy like Analyze This was but it's also not a serious Goodfellas type. I will say the scene where Giovanni is asked to review a movie is great only because of the one they picked. Overall, I expected it to be just OK but really a movie produced by Scorsese, directed by Luc Besson and starring De Niro should be much better then this.

The film has a great cast of actors including Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Tommy Lee Jones, and Dianna Agron, some interesting characters and beautiful photography (by Thierry Arbogast), while striving to find a story to tell.Based on a book by Tonino Benacquista and co-executive-produced by Martin Scorsese, &#8220;The Family&#8221; (also known as &#8220;Malavita&#8221; meaning &#8220;Badfellas&#8221;) chronicles the life of a former mafia boss Giovanni Manzoni, now &#8220;Fred Blake,&#8221; and his wife Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and two children Belle (Dianna Agron) and Warren (John D'Leo) living in a quiet village in Normandy, France, under FBI witness protection plan. The American family has some run-ins with locals who do not know their true identity, despite the advice from FBI agent Robert Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones).&#8220;The Family&#8221; suffers from the inconsistent tone as a result of the lack of story. As a comedy it is too violent; as a gangster film it is too absurd (FBI and mafia in France?). Those violence-prone characters suddenly get weak during the shoot-out. Reference to one classic gangster movie (by Martin Scorsese) is mildly amusing, but not enough. The subplot about Belle and the math teacher goes nowhere.This is regrettable because the younger players Dianna Agron and John D'Leo are so good, almost stealing scenes from veterans. I wanted to know much more about their characters and how they dominate the school, than the clich&eacute;d culture clash episodes or tired and pointless &#8220;action.&#8221;",3,"Or ""Malavita""; Well-Acted, But Uneven",1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,1709,"['Luc', 'Besson', '8217', 'latest', 'movie', '8220', 'Family', '8221', 'typical', 'example', 'film', 'where', 'wealth', 'great', 'talent', 'wasted', 'thin', 'material', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'actors', 'including', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Dianna', 'Agron', 'interesting', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'Thierry', 'Arbogast', 'striving', 'find', 'story', 'tell.Based', 'book', 'Tonino', 'Benacquista', 'co-executive-produced', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', '8220', 'Family', '8221', 'also', 'known', '8220', 'Malavita', '8221', 'meaning', '8220', 'Badfellas', '8221', 'life', 'former', 'mafia', 'boss', 'Giovanni', 'Manzoni', 'now', '8220', 'Fred', 'Blake', '8221', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'two', 'children', 'Belle', 'Dianna', 'Agron', 'Warren', 'John', ""D'Leo"", 'living', 'quiet', 'village', 'Normandy', 'France', 'FBI', 'witness', 'protection', 'plan', 'American', 'family', 'run-ins', 'locals', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'true', 'identity', 'advice', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Robert', 'Stansfield', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', '8220', 'Family', '8221', 'suffers', 'inconsistent', 'tone', 'result', 'lack', 'story', 'comedy', 'too', 'violent', 'gangster', 'film', 'too', 'absurd', 'FBI', 'mafia', 'France', 'violence-prone', 'characters', 'suddenly', 'get', 'weak', 'shoot-out', 'Reference', 'one', 'classic', 'gangster', 'movie', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'not', 'enough', 'subplot', 'Belle', 'math', 'teacher', 'nowhere.This', 'regrettable', 'younger', 'players', 'Dianna', 'Agron', 'John', ""D'Leo"", 'are', 'so', 'good', 'almost', 'stealing', 'scenes', 'veterans', 'wanted', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'characters', 'how', 'dominate', 'school', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'culture', 'clash', 'episodes', 'tired', 'pointless', '8220', '8221']",The Family
