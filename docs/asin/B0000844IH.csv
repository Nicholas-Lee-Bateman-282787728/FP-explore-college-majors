733335,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0000844IH,A. Burchfield,"[9, 10]","I originally saw this documentary on The Discovery Channel and thought it was pretty interesting. The first disc consists of the program itself and starts/ends with a meeting of survivors of the battle from both sides.Some of the German survivors actually went on Cameron's expedition to the wreck site, they gave advice on best robot camera entry points &amp; so on. I thought the reenactment scenes looked very good (see disc 2 for a behind the scenes segment on that)as did some of the computer animated segments. Perhaps the most interesting point made was the contention that evidence indicated that the Bismarck's crew scuttled the ship, as they claimed, and most of the British Naval gunfire was ineffectual at best.Disc 2 was actually more interesting to me with it's  many segments of computer animation illustrating various parts of the battle &amp; the sinking of the Bismarck. There's a section of multiangle video views of the ship, that's a joke because while there are some interestinng wreck pictures I could not get the claimed multi angle function to work",3,"Informative, good but not great",1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,1073,"['originally', 'saw', 'documentary', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'first', 'disc', 'program', 'meeting', 'survivors', 'battle', 'sides.Some', 'German', 'survivors', 'actually', 'went', 'Cameron', 'expedition', 'wreck', 'site', 'gave', 'advice', 'best', 'robot', 'camera', 'entry', 'points', 'amp', 'so', 'thought', 'reenactment', 'scenes', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'see', 'disc', '2', 'scenes', 'segment', 'did', 'computer', 'animated', 'segments', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'point', 'made', 'was', 'contention', 'evidence', 'indicated', 'Bismarck', 'crew', 'scuttled', 'ship', 'claimed', 'most', 'British', 'Naval', 'gunfire', 'was', 'ineffectual', 'best.Disc', '2', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'interesting', 'many', 'segments', 'computer', 'animation', 'illustrating', 'various', 'parts', 'battle', 'amp', 'sinking', 'Bismarck', 'section', 'multiangle', 'video', 'views', 'ship', 'joke', 'are', 'interestinng', 'wreck', 'pictures', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'claimed', 'multi', 'angle', 'function', 'work']",James Cameron's Expedition - Bismarck

I highly recommend Bismarck to WWII history buffs out there as well as those interested in lost vessels and undersea exploration (also those Clive Custler fans out there like myself). The recreations were fantastic and having contributions from some of the actual German survivors really added depth to this top-notch production.Another DVD worth owning for the Cameron/historical adventure enthusiast isThe Lost Tomb of Jesus,5,"A worthy ""Quest""",1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,477,"['ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'documentaries', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Bismarck', 'WWII', 'history', 'buffs', 'out', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'interested', 'lost', 'vessels', 'undersea', 'exploration', 'also', 'Clive', 'Custler', 'out', 'there', 'recreations', 'were', 'fantastic', 'having', 'contributions', 'actual', 'German', 'survivors', 'really', 'added', 'depth', 'top-notch', 'production.Another', 'DVD', 'worth', 'owning', 'Cameron/historical', 'adventure', 'enthusiast', 'isThe', 'Lost', 'Tomb', 'Jesus']",James Cameron's Expedition - Bismarck
733337,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0000844IH,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","James Cameron, for lack of a better phrase, was on top of the world after Titanic came out. The biggest cinematic gamble at the time, it went on to score 11 Oscars and get a domestic profit of 600 million, the highest ever. Then he kind of dropped off the map, well sort of. Since then he made 3 deep sea dive documentaries and a short-lived tv show. After his Titanic documentary Ghosts of the Abyss, he made Expedition: Bismarck which chronicles the sinking of a german war ship during WWII.During World War II, the German forces had a ship called the Bismarck, which was a very formidable battleship. After it sank a British clip, they got a bit angry and decided an all-out assault on the ship. A lucky shot nailed the propeller, crippling it and sending it in circles, allowing British fleets to sink it. This film centers around recreating the sinking and allowing James Cameron and other divepeople to explore the wreck.One of the things that's always interesting with re-creating mysteries is when they have little demonstration videos to show just what happened in a kind of CSI-like fashion. So when they talk about shells rupturing hulls and the ship sliding you're kind of ""huh?"" but the CG videos allow you to see it in clear detail, without the water's murkiness.One thing that's thankfully kept to a minimum, which later film Aliens of the Deep suffered from is when people go ""wow that's great, wow that's awesome!"". There's a couple of scenes like it here but it's not as intrusive so it's more basic and to the point. Granted a jellyfish with a translucent scarf is going to bring about such reactions but then again an 800 ft ship damaged and on the bottom of the ocean should bring the same reaction.It's a well-made documentary from a guy who did quite a few. To see a representation of war in its most horrible form and revisit it is quite compelling and the fact that it was a German ship Hitler actually visited but without being finger waving throughout the film was a nice touch.",4,Incredibly fascinating,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2005,"['James', 'Cameron', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'was', 'top', 'world', 'Titanic', 'came', 'out', 'biggest', 'cinematic', 'gamble', 'time', 'went', 'score', '11', 'Oscars', 'get', 'domestic', 'profit', '600', 'million', 'highest', 'ever', 'Then', 'kind', 'dropped', 'map', 'well', 'sort', 'then', 'made', '3', 'deep', 'sea', 'dive', 'documentaries', 'short-lived', 'tv', 'show', 'Titanic', 'documentary', 'Ghosts', 'Abyss', 'made', 'Expedition', 'Bismarck', 'sinking', 'german', 'war', 'ship', 'WWII.During', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'German', 'forces', 'had', 'ship', 'called', 'Bismarck', 'was', 'very', 'formidable', 'battleship', 'sank', 'British', 'clip', 'got', 'bit', 'angry', 'decided', 'all-out', 'assault', 'ship', 'lucky', 'shot', 'nailed', 'propeller', 'crippling', 'sending', 'circles', 'allowing', 'British', 'fleets', 'sink', 'film', 'centers', 'recreating', 'sinking', 'allowing', 'James', 'Cameron', 'other', 'divepeople', 'explore', 'wreck.One', 'things', 'always', 'interesting', 're-creating', 'mysteries', 'when', 'have', 'little', 'demonstration', 'videos', 'show', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'kind', 'CSI-like', 'fashion', 'So', 'when', 'talk', 'shells', 'rupturing', 'hulls', 'ship', 'sliding', ""'re"", 'kind', 'huh', 'CG', 'videos', 'allow', 'see', 'clear', 'detail', 'water', 'murkiness.One', 'thing', 'thankfully', 'kept', 'minimum', 'later', 'film', 'Aliens', 'Deep', 'suffered', 'when', 'people', 'go', 'wow', 'great', 'wow', 'awesome', 'couple', 'scenes', 'here', 'not', 'intrusive', 'more', 'basic', 'point', 'Granted', 'jellyfish', 'translucent', 'scarf', 'going', 'bring', 'about', 'such', 'reactions', 'then', 'again', '800', 'ft', 'ship', 'damaged', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'should', 'bring', 'same', 'reaction.It', 'well-made', 'documentary', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'quite', 'few', 'see', 'representation', 'war', 'most', 'horrible', 'form', 'revisit', 'quite', 'compelling', 'fact', 'was', 'German', 'ship', 'Hitler', 'actually', 'visited', 'being', 'finger', 'waving', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'touch']",James Cameron's Expedition - Bismarck

This one is about the analysis of its sinking based on the wreck.The animation is pretty cool and successful for the illustration. The film is more movie-style than documentary and some parts are very similar to the movie ""Titanic"" by James Cameron.In my opinion, the main contribution of this film is to settle down the dispute about if the British sank or the German scuttled the Bismarck. Without this, I shall rate this film three stars.",4,Controversy finally settles down,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,561,"['want', 'know', 'whole', 'journey', 'Bismarck', 'better', 'Search', 'Battleship', 'Bismarck', 'NG', 'choice', 'one', 'analysis', 'sinking', 'based', 'wreck.The', 'animation', 'pretty', 'cool', 'successful', 'illustration', 'film', 'more', 'movie-style', 'documentary', 'parts', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'movie', 'Titanic', 'James', 'Cameron.In', 'opinion', 'main', 'contribution', 'film', 'settle', 'down', 'dispute', 'British', 'sank', 'German', 'scuttled', 'Bismarck', 'shall', 'rate', 'film', 'three', 'stars']",James Cameron's Expedition - Bismarck
733339,AU69ERKOK9ZSJ,B0000844IH,Nicholas Dujmovic,"[3, 5]","While I agree with the limitations of this DVD mentioned by other reviewers, and even though James Cameron is, well, not a guy I'd care to have over for dinner, this is a worthwhile video if you have young boys AND if you've already seen the very good 1960 British movie 'Sink the Bismarck.'  It's a great followup to a compelling story about how the Bismarck threatened the lifeblood of civilization, and how the good guys beat the odds and sunk her.  Cameron's expedition allows for good talk with children about how wars are tragic even when they need to be fought, how young people die, sometimes horribly, and how the survivors afterwards can indeed be friends.  Even though the Germans in that war were our enemies, they are our friends now and we can respect and honor the sacrifice they made for their country, even while we recognize that their cause was evil.",4,Worthwhile entertainment to share with young sons,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,869,"['agree', 'limitations', 'DVD', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'even', 'James', 'Cameron', 'well', 'not', 'guy', ""'d"", 'care', 'have', 'over', 'dinner', 'worthwhile', 'video', 'have', 'young', 'boys', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'very', 'good', '1960', 'British', 'movie', ""'Sink"", 'Bismarck', 'great', 'followup', 'compelling', 'story', 'how', 'Bismarck', 'threatened', 'lifeblood', 'civilization', 'how', 'good', 'guys', 'beat', 'odds', 'sunk', 'Cameron', 'expedition', 'good', 'talk', 'children', 'how', 'wars', 'are', 'tragic', 'even', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'fought', 'how', 'young', 'people', 'die', 'sometimes', 'horribly', 'how', 'survivors', 'afterwards', 'can', 'indeed', 'be', 'friends', 'Even', 'Germans', 'war', 'were', 'enemies', 'are', 'friends', 'now', 'can', 'respect', 'honor', 'sacrifice', 'made', 'country', 'even', 'recognize', 'cause', 'was', 'evil']",James Cameron's Expedition - Bismarck
