We loved the first 2 films, and the 3rd didn't disapoint at all.  The whole concept of Crocadile Dundee is a little cartoonish anyway, so you don't rate these as 'serious' stories, rather accept them as humorous entertainment, which they do pretty well.  I always enjoyed the 'Paul Hogan Show', kind of reminded me of Benny Hill or Monty Python, which is to say, it may be really silly humor sometimes, but you can't deny the entertainment value of it!  (If you do, you won't find a place in my circle of friends, a loose sense of humor is a requirement, lol)  So, Croc 3 gives us a reasonable story line, a new character as Mr & Mrs Croc now have a son, and a few funny parts that you wanna go back and watch again, an acceptable bad guy and his cronies, and the inevitable Dundee climax, all fit for the whole family to watch together with no covered eyes, or ears.

1077465,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000QUEQ6S,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","The CROCODILE DUNDEE TRIPLE FEATURE is a triple feature movie set that contains all three of the Crocodile Dundee movies in one volume.Although he was a fairly well known tv star in Australia, Paul Hogan was a virtual unknown in the United States. Then, in 1986, along came CROCODILE DUNDEE and Hogan became a huge international movie star who also helped make Australia a dream vacation destination for millions of Americans.Hogan stars in the movie as Mick Dundee, a part Aborigine crocodile hunter who doesn&#8217;t hunt for fun. Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) is a New York journalist on assignment in Australia. Before coming back home she&#8217;s trying to track down a local man from the very small town of Walkabout Creek who supposedly had part of his leg bit off by a croc, but managed to survive and crawled out of the Outback several days later. She eventually meets the man who the story is about and he agrees to take her on a journey to retrace the steps of that episode. This leads to some hilarious moments in the Australian wild with Sue, but the story takes an even more interesting turn when Mick agrees to accompany Sue to New York City where he explores the urban jungle.Hogan was not only the star of the movie, but he also created the story and co-wrote the screenplay. The chemistry between himself and Kozlowski is exceptional and it really came as no surprise that the two eventually ended up in a very long term real-life romance with each other.CROCODILE DUNDEE was a major surprise hit when it first was released. Other than some 1980s fashions with Sue and the people in New York, the film remains fresh and vibrant a quarter of a century after it first came out. The movie has a great, well-written story with some very colorful characters and some good actors who have some amazing on-screen chemistry. There are some really funny lines that became catch phrases of the time (&#8220;You call that a knife?&#8221;), but there is also humor that works on several different levels from classic slapstick to wry and witty. Also, although there are a few adult references, CROCODILE DUNDEE is basically a family film. It was rated PG-13 in 1986, but is only a PG movie by today&#8217;s standards.Although the movie might not be a critical darling, CROCODILE DUNDEE was a huge popular success that remains fresh and relevant today and offers something for everyone in a family to enjoy.It's rare that a sequel (not part of a planned series of films) lives up to the original film; sequels almost always aren't as good as the original films they follow. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is one of those few sequels that's just as good as the original and, in some ways, is an even better film. The movie begins in New York City. Although he has been in New York City for a while, Mic (Paul Hogan) is still ignorant of city life. Sue's (Linda Kozlowski) writing career is bigger than ever. One day Sue receives some photographs from her ex-husband Bob that depict the murder of a man at the hands of the lead of a Colombian drug cartel. Her life is in immediate danger and she ends up getting kidnapped. Mic rescues her, but knows the danger isn't over and that the criminals will not stop. So, Mic takes Sue with him back to Australia so he can protect her and fight off the drug lords on his own turf.CROCODILE DUNDEE II has some humorous moments, but it's a more serious movie than the original. The audience actually gets to see some real character development with Mic and Sue. The first movie was more of a comedy with some romance thrown in; the romance actually wasn't the main focal point of the story. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is more of an action-adventure movie with a good dose of comedy that's actually tied together by a love story; the relationship between Mic and Sue is the catalyst for most of the plot. I actually enjoyed the more serious tone of the picture and found it gave it a bit of gravitas that the first movie never really had.I first saw CROCODILE DUNDEE II in a movie theatre as a kid and I remember thinking even then how good of a sequel it was. I've seen both films several times since then and my impression of CROCODILE DUNDEE II has not changed: it's a great sequel to a classic 80s movie that remains as memorable now as it did when I first saw it.CROCODILE DUNDEE II is a great sequel and follow-up film to CROCODILE DUNDEE. It's got a good plot and finds the right balance between comedy and action-adventure.The third movie in this triple feature is CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES. After thirteen years in limbo, Mick &#34;Crocodile&#34; Dundee is back. This was a really enjoyable movie that everyone in my family enjoyed watching. The picture provides lots of laughs and the story works rather well.Mick and the love of his life, Sue, have a son together and are living in Mick's home territory of the Australian Outback. However, a publisher at a Los Angeles newspaper that Sue's father owns suddenly dies and her father temporarily offers her the position until a permanent replacement can be found. Surprisingly, Mick agrees and they move to LA. Once there, Sue begins to investigate the sudden death of the previous publisher and Mick goes undercover at a movie studio.The critics blasted this film, but like many of the movies they review, they are way off target. The film is funny and family oriented. The plot is more believable than many big budgeted affairs and there is very little violence and no sleaze. The only major drawback about the movie is that it has been thirteen years since the last Crocodile Dundee film. Still, the movie fits well within the trilogy. Overall CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES is a delightful movie that the entire family can enjoy.Although the Crocodile Dundee movies aren't really a trilogy (they are more like two movies that work really well together and then a third movie epilogue), it&#8217;s great to find a DVD set that has all three of these movies together in one package.",5,The Entire Crocodile Dundee
