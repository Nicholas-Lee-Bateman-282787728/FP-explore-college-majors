It works perfectlywell as a stand-alone story. You've got your mysterious Babel-like soaring-into-the-clouds tower,roamed by monsters, which has to be traversed level by level. Most of the &#34;climbers&#34; go in seekingtreasure, but a few seek to battle the evil god up at the very top.Todd voices the usual schmuck, roped into doing this by the usual pretty face, accompanied by aband of your usual stock characters. The story works well. The plot becomes impressively intricatefor a video-game adaptation. You've got the once-heroic king who may not be all that heroic, courtfactions, political intrigues. They certainly did a good job of creating a medieval who-is-looking-to-stick-a-dagger-in-whose-back-next atmosphere.I should note that there are a......gratuitous?....number of bath scenes.

1384150,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B0043988P8,RavenRing,"[18, 23]","The Tower of Druaga is a mysterious tower filled with riches and monsters and the god of evil residing at the top. Every 5 years, the Summer of Anu arrives and the monsters become weak. Jil and his friends are Climbers - people who climb the tower and whose goal is to defeat the evil god Druaga at the top and claim the mystical Blue Crystal Rod, which is said to have the power to grant wishes. But Jil and his friends aren't the only ones climbing the tower - there are many other groups of Climbers, and even the kingdom of Uruk sends its army to climb. The race is on!I was first introduced to The Tower of Druaga through the Funimation preview, which impressed me by being an actual preview (unlike most anime trailers), and a good preview at that. When I found it was based on a video game, I wasn't sure if that was a bad thing or not, but when I heard favorable reviews of the series, I decided to give it a shot.The first episode had me in stitches - it was a parody of RPG games, and was really well done and entertaining. The second episode is where the story really starts. The parody element continue to show up through out the series, though is most common in the first half. The story itself isn't bad, though full of plot holes. Stuff is thrown in with little explanation and anything important is mostly ignored as long as possible. The characters are flat, and Jil is horribly annoying. The rest are just a little annoying. And if you expect a cool ending where everything comes together and all is explained, keep dreaming.But for all of its many, many shortcomings, Tower of Druaga was fun to watch. The Tower has lots of cool things about it and I enjoyed the references to Babylonian mythology. I finished the first half of the series slightly impressed. Unfortunately, the second half falls back into mediocrity. The sparkle of the first half wears away, and we are left with plot holes and flat characters. There is a convenient break in the story after the first half, so if you wanted to stop there, you could. Though I admit that the beginning of the second half was rather fun, getting to see what happened to our heros after they finished their quest and all.As for this box set, I expect it to be like all of Funimation's complete collection releases - good quality for a good price. The Amazon page for this product claims that it is 2 discs and 260 minutes, which is probably copied from the product details of the second half of the complete collection. That is, its wrong. This set will have 4 discs in two thin-pack cases and 24 episodes, which is about 560 minutes of runtime. I've heard a little of the English dub, enough to decided that it is pretty good, I just like the Japanese dub better.If you are looking for random, pointless fun, The Tower of Druaga might be your show. The complete collection is fair deal, much better then buying the halves separately. If you just want to try it out before committing a whole $36.99, Crunchyroll.com has the entire series streaming for free (or at least at the time of this review it was).",3,Climb to the Top!,1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,3073,"['Tower', 'Druaga', 'mysterious', 'tower', 'filled', 'riches', 'monsters', 'god', 'evil', 'residing', 'top', '5', 'years', 'Summer', 'Anu', 'arrives', 'monsters', 'become', 'weak', 'Jil', 'friends', 'are', 'Climbers', 'people', 'who', 'climb', 'tower', 'goal', 'defeat', 'evil', 'god', 'Druaga', 'top', 'claim', 'mystical', 'Blue', 'Crystal', 'Rod', 'said', 'have', 'power', 'grant', 'wishes', 'Jil', 'friends', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'ones', 'climbing', 'tower', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'groups', 'Climbers', 'even', 'kingdom', 'Uruk', 'army', 'climb', 'race', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Tower', 'Druaga', 'Funimation', 'preview', 'impressed', 'being', 'actual', 'preview', 'most', 'anime', 'trailers', 'good', 'preview', 'When', 'found', 'was', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'bad', 'thing', 'not', 'when', 'heard', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'series', 'decided', 'give', 'shot.The', 'first', 'episode', 'had', 'stitches', 'was', 'parody', 'RPG', 'games', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'entertaining', 'second', 'episode', 'where', 'story', 'really', 'parody', 'element', 'continue', 'show', 'up', 'series', 'most', 'common', 'first', 'half', 'story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'Stuff', 'thrown', 'little', 'explanation', 'anything', 'important', 'mostly', 'ignored', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'Jil', 'horribly', 'annoying', 'rest', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'annoying', 'expect', 'cool', 'ending', 'where', 'everything', 'together', 'explained', 'keep', 'dreaming.But', 'many', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'Tower', 'Druaga', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'Tower', 'lots', 'cool', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'references', 'Babylonian', 'mythology', 'finished', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'slightly', 'impressed', 'Unfortunately', 'second', 'half', 'back', 'mediocrity', 'sparkle', 'first', 'half', 'away', 'are', 'left', 'plot', 'holes', 'flat', 'characters', 'convenient', 'break', 'story', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'wanted', 'stop', 'there', 'could', 'admit', 'beginning', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'rather', 'fun', 'getting', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'heros', 'finished', 'quest', 'all.As', 'box', 'set', 'expect', 'be', 'Funimation', 'complete', 'collection', 'good', 'quality', 'good', 'price', 'Amazon', 'page', 'product', '2', 'discs', '260', 'minutes', 'probably', 'copied', 'product', 'details', 'second', 'half', 'complete', 'collection', 'wrong', 'set', 'will', 'have', '4', 'discs', 'two', 'thin-pack', 'cases', '24', 'episodes', '560', 'minutes', 'runtime', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'little', 'English', 'dub', 'enough', 'decided', 'pretty', 'good', 'just', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'better.If', 'are', 'looking', 'random', 'pointless', 'fun', 'Tower', 'Druaga', 'might', 'be', 'show', 'complete', 'collection', 'fair', 'deal', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'buying', 'halves', 'separately', 'just', 'want', 'try', 'out', 'committing', 'whole', '36.99', 'Crunchyroll.com', 'entire', 'series', 'streaming', 'free', 'least', 'time', 'review', 'was']",The Tower of Druaga: The Complete

1384152,A277UC8WJVAIIE,B0043988P8,The Wiz,"[1, 2]","I know what you're thinking: ""so...a show about heroes climbing a tower... sounds lame"" but wait, that's just the central theme to a much larger fantasy saga representing a fusion of ancient Sumerian mythology (probably one of the reasons a tower is central to the story) and the medieval European pattern we're all used to. About three episodes in I actually found myself liking Tower of Druaga better than similar fantasy shows like Legend of Legendary Heroes or Fairy Tale mainly because of the characters and how they really develop individually as well as relationally not to mention this show has some of my absolutely favorite voice actors especially for Jil (Todd Haberkorn), cute little Coopa (Monica Rial) and Melt the snobby wizard (Chuck Huber) and on and on.Be aware that episode one is really misleading with its almost excessively wacky approach (very funny nevertheless) but when you get past it you find a really solid fantasy.  Also, despite a continued thread of humor throughout the series, it comes across as a fairly mature show, not because of excessive fan service (minus the occasional bathing scene), language or violence but because it treats this epic fantasy with a touch of drama.  I'm also an avid D&D; fan and this show just conveys a lot of that same feeling and so I absolutely did NOT want to leave this world by episode 24.  I was a leetle disappointed that the ""bonus material"" doesn't include any commentaries about the show but oh well... that sort of thing never affects my overall rating of a DVD anyway and besides, the opening song makes a great ring-tone so how's that for a bonus.Please Gonzo... make another season of TOD!!!  :o)",5,Tower of Awesome,1373414400,"07 10, 2013",2013,1675,"['know', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'so', 'show', 'heroes', 'climbing', 'tower', 'lame', 'wait', 'just', 'central', 'theme', 'much', 'larger', 'fantasy', 'saga', 'representing', 'fusion', 'ancient', 'Sumerian', 'mythology', 'probably', 'one', 'reasons', 'tower', 'central', 'story', 'medieval', 'European', 'pattern', ""'re"", 'used', 'three', 'episodes', 'actually', 'found', 'liking', 'Tower', 'Druaga', 'better', 'similar', 'fantasy', 'shows', 'Legend', 'Legendary', 'Heroes', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'mainly', 'characters', 'how', 'really', 'develop', 'individually', 'as', 'well', 'relationally', 'not', 'mention', 'show', 'absolutely', 'favorite', 'voice', 'actors', 'especially', 'Jil', 'Todd', 'Haberkorn', 'cute', 'little', 'Coopa', 'Monica', 'Rial', 'Melt', 'snobby', 'wizard', 'Chuck', 'Huber', 'aware', 'episode', 'one', 'really', 'misleading', 'almost', 'excessively', 'wacky', 'approach', 'very', 'funny', 'nevertheless', 'when', 'get', 'find', 'really', 'solid', 'fantasy', 'Also', 'continued', 'thread', 'humor', 'series', 'fairly', 'mature', 'show', 'not', 'excessive', 'fan', 'service', 'occasional', 'bathing', 'scene', 'language', 'violence', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'touch', 'drama', ""'m"", 'also', 'avid', 'D', 'D', 'fan', 'show', 'just', 'conveys', 'lot', 'same', 'feeling', 'so', 'absolutely', 'did', 'NOT', 'want', 'leave', 'world', 'episode', '24', 'was', 'leetle', 'disappointed', 'bonus', 'material', ""n't"", 'include', 'commentaries', 'show', 'oh', 'well', 'sort', 'thing', 'never', 'overall', 'rating', 'DVD', 'anyway', 'besides', 'opening', 'song', 'great', 'ring-tone', 'how', 'bonus.Please', 'Gonzo', 'make', 'season', 'TOD', 'o']",The Tower of Druaga: The Complete
