I wasn't aware of the film when I read the novel, and have thought about the accomplishment over the years, and even moreso when I heard that a new feature film has been released that was made in 2012 and was a big hit in Norway, and spreading in popularity across Europe, and hopefully eventually coming to the U.S. soon.  In attempting to learn more about the current film, I discovered that Amazon had the original film with the actual footage of the journey made by the original crew and thought..&#34;WOW&#34;, here's a chance to see the real thing before the hollywoood types release their version.  So I saw it, and really enjoyed it.  The shots of the ample food suppy, the relentless pursuit of sharks, and the whale shark were really great.  The feat of allowing the currents and winds from the Trade Winds move the balsa wood raft toward the Pacific Islands over several months was proof that the descendants of modern Pacific Islanders were at least partially comprised of the people of South America, who made very large rafts from balsa trees that once grew near the coast.  All of the objections thrown at that theory were easily overcome with the reality of the KonTiki crew that not merely survived but thrived during the voyage, never wanting for water or fresh fish to fuel them on.  They tested the idea of satisfying the requirement of obtaining fresh water by drinking fluid from the glands of fish, ....not tasty but effectively providing fresh water.  The film is a good record of the voyage, but was unable to capture their struggle with at least two serious storms at sea, something the new hollywood production will no doubt be able to simulate.

That might be tough to say based on this 1951 Academy Award winning documentary by biologist Thor Heyerdahl. But this is exactly what Thor and several other men try to prove by building a raft in Peru and drifting/sailing into the Pacific Ocean.The film is interesting if very dated. The cartoonish depictions of the world map and their travels were often hard to watch, reminding me of some kid's crayon drawing scrawling across the screen, but informative in a kind of regressive nature.The more interesting aspects of this 58-minute documentary were how involved the world was in the Kon-Tiki expedition (Ham radio operators were listening around the world), and some of the strange and new discoveries of fish species during their voyage.But lost to me were the difficulties of the journey. More film time was spent describing the rigors of gathering the rare cork-like wood for their raft than was given to their actual struggles out on the water.Once we're on the Pacific Ocean with them, we also feel that this is some sort of simple trip, as if they're just trolling around a lagoon (felt kind of Gilligan's Islandish). But this was also a bizarre strength for the film. In today's (2005) reality TV world, every bug bite that some contestant on Survivor receives is broadcast as if a limb were amputated, but here the men seemed minimally interested in the sharks following them and when their cooking facilities nearly burn up.Scientifically, though, I think this documentary is a serious flop. The initial idea was to prove that the peopling of the Pacific Islands came about by ancient mariners from South America. Although I still believe this is true, doing it in 1946 with a sextant, cooking stove, experimental military food supplies, and other modern conveniences didn't set well in my analytical mind.Final summation: watch it once if you're a film history buff.

This one-hour feature documents Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl's voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a balsa-wood raft, to simulate how South American natives might possibly have voyaged west and settled in the islands of Polynesia.Crude, black-and-white grainy 16mm film, simple English narration. The production is bare-bones. But I've seen this film two or three times. Instead of ""reality TV"" which is far from reality, this is reality. Five guys who set out in a boat they did not know would be able to survive the distance, finding out by hard experience what it might have been like for any ancient mariner who tried to do the same.Many days were calm, and the crew could lash the steering paddle down, letting the wind and the current carry them toward their Polynesian goal. They could get in a basket below the water line and watch the ocean life, or float lazily away from the main raft in a rubber lifeboat.Every morning they got up and picked up the flying fish that had landed on the raft and been stranded. Breakfast! At other times they speared and clubbed dolphin fish (not dolphins) for a change of meat. They caught many sharks, mainly to discourage them from following the raft. They worried about whales and other large fish, but were never troubled by them.In about three month's time, they arrived in Polynesia and were driven toward the coast of a small island. They very nearly were wrecked on the reef. It was by no means certain that they would make it safely to shore, but finally the raft came to rest and they were able to unload the important equipment, set up on shore, and radio their successful landing and their position. They met natives (wearing Western clothing) and eventually a boat was sent to retrieve them.It is a simple story, told in a straightforward way. It doesn't seem especially dramatic, but it is authentic.

567265,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B000055XNX,Jack E. Levic,"[0, 0]","After watching the 2012 theatrical film KON-TIKI, I wanted to view the real thing. Thor Heyerdahl's journey on a balsa raft across the unforgiving Pacific Ocean was a remarkable feat of courage. Heyerdahl proposed that the Polynesian Islands in the Pacific could have been populated by South Americans rather than by Asians, which was the accepted fact of the day. After 101 days and 4,300 nautical miles on a bolsa raft, he and his 5 fellow adventurers proved without a doubt that a raft leaving Peru could, in fact, could reach the Polynesian Islands. In fact, it was amazingly easy and far from impossible as he had been told.The original Heyerdahl documentary is a complete step back in time. Although the recent theatrical version dramatized some facts, it did follow the real story closely. The theatrical movie had the advantage of filmmaking techniques and all the possible safety factors. Heyerdahl and his men were pioneers on so many levels. They brought along a movie camera to film their adventures. This was long before reality TV so it is amazing they men thought to document their story alone and without a film crew or safety features.  These men did everything and took all the risks. Obviously, pieces are missing in the story and are filled-in by the narrator. The ocean seems peaceful but there was a 5 day storm where no filming was done. The original Kon-Tiki is more authentic than any Hollywood creation. These men lived this adventure and surprisingly did quite well on the journey.The version I watched is from Janson Media. It does have a menu with some bonus features to enjoy. I know Heyerdahl and his team filmed in black and white under harsh conditions, so I don't know if the film could have been enhanced for clarity. Again, this was 1947 and people weren't making documentaries on the high seas. The men were filming under harsh conditions and without today's high-tech cameras. A few rolls of completed film were destroyed by the environment.The final documentary may be technically crude by our modern sensibilities but it is truly amazing. It does seem like more effort could have been used in the graphics and maps that explain the journey. The opening information scroll at the beginning is barely readable with the Kon-Tiki figure background. Keep the authenticity of the footage but it would be good to enhance the non-documentary footage.Nothing beats the original KON-TIKI. Here is the amazing story of how 6 men crossed the Pacific on a raft. It is a no frills story. The drama was built in and there is amazing footage of sea creatures who followed the raft. It is realism at its best. The crew risked their lives to board a rubber dinghy (a bit of modern technology that did not affect the raft).

Ridiculed by the scientific establishment, Heyerdahl wanted to duplicate the legendary voyage of an ancient race of settlers led by the mythical hero Kon-Tiki. The expedition attracted worldwide attention as one of the most daring feats of its day. Heyerdahl's story was told first in his book and then in this 1950 Oscar-winning Documentary Feature directed by Olle Nordemar. The story of &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; is half Lindberg crossing the Atlantic and half Schleimann discovering Troy, since it has inspired not only other perilous voyages but archeological investigation.

The film only runs 58 minutes and is narrated by Thor Heyerdahl himself.  According to IMDb, the film runs 77 minutes, so I'm not sure where the other 19 minutes went.The movie was released at the same time as his book, which documents his 6-man team (and 1 female parakeet) and their 5000 mile trip from Peru to Polynesia in 1947.  Some time is spent early explaining why Heyerdahl felt that the ancestors of the vast island chain had originally come from South America rather than the accepted Asia.  He spends some time showing how the raft was conceived and constructed but little about how he acquired financing.Shot by Heyerdahl and his crew using a 16mm camera with no audio, the compilation shows some harrowing experiences although Heyerdahl's perfectly British accented English suggests that they were no big deal.  There were a couple exceptions.  They had a rubber dingy on board so that a crew member or two could float away from the raft to take pictures.  They quickly learned that the dingy even with 2 men paddling like crazy couldn't keep up with the Tiki.  The raft had no way of turning around so they were lucky to rescue the men by tossing a long rope.  Another incident involved a pod of whales that came very close to the boat and another involving a whale shark, highly dramatized in the 2012 film.The normal sized sharks were always around but seemed to be of marginal concern to the crew.  In fact they fished for them and Heyerdahl has a throwaway line in the documentary where he says that at one time they had 9 sharks on board for food, experiments and chum.  Many of the events shown here are recreated in the newer film, but in most cases they are overly dramatized for today's audiences.  For example, the bird is eventually lost during some turbulence.  In the new film she is caught midair by a shark.I was surprised that Heyerdahl doesn't mention his crew more by name in the narration or explain what their primary purpose was.  We don't get very close to them.  Still the voyage was a remarkable achievement and the resultant film is as well.  A bit more excitement in the narration would have given a better sense of the true danger.  I will also mention that the Heyerdahl crew seems to be a bit overjoyed when it comes to beating their fresh catch to death with hammers and clubs.",4,3 1/2 stars for the abreviated version via Amazon streaming,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,2467,"['thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'documentary', 'having', 'just', 'seen', 'terrific', '2012', 'Norwegian', 'dramatic', 'adaptation', 'film', 'only', '58', 'minutes', 'narrated', 'Thor', 'Heyerdahl', 'According', 'IMDb', 'film', '77', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'other', '19', 'minutes', 'went.The', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'book', 'documents', '6-man', 'team', '1', 'female', 'parakeet', '5000', 'mile', 'trip', 'Peru', 'Polynesia', '1947', 'time', 'spent', 'early', 'explaining', 'why', 'Heyerdahl', 'felt', 'ancestors', 'vast', 'island', 'chain', 'had', 'originally', 'come', 'South', 'America', 'rather', 'accepted', 'Asia', 'time', 'showing', 'how', 'raft', 'was', 'conceived', 'constructed', 'little', 'how', 'acquired', 'financing.Shot', 'Heyerdahl', 'crew', 'using', '16mm', 'camera', 'audio', 'compilation', 'harrowing', 'experiences', 'Heyerdahl', 'perfectly', 'British', 'accented', 'English', 'suggests', 'were', 'big', 'deal', 'were', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'had', 'rubber', 'dingy', 'board', 'crew', 'member', 'two', 'could', 'float', 'away', 'raft', 'take', 'pictures', 'quickly', 'learned', 'dingy', 'even', '2', 'men', 'paddling', 'crazy', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'Tiki', 'raft', 'had', 'way', 'turning', 'around', 'so', 'were', 'lucky', 'rescue', 'men', 'tossing', 'long', 'rope', 'incident', 'involved', 'pod', 'whales', 'came', 'very', 'close', 'boat', 'involving', 'whale', 'shark', 'highly', 'dramatized', '2012', 'film.The', 'normal', 'sized', 'sharks', 'were', 'always', 'around', 'seemed', 'be', 'marginal', 'concern', 'crew', 'fact', 'fished', 'Heyerdahl', 'throwaway', 'line', 'documentary', 'where', 'one', 'time', 'had', '9', 'sharks', 'board', 'food', 'experiments', 'chum', 'Many', 'events', 'shown', 'here', 'are', 'recreated', 'newer', 'film', 'most', 'cases', 'are', 'overly', 'dramatized', 'today', 'audiences', 'example', 'bird', 'eventually', 'lost', 'turbulence', 'new', 'film', 'caught', 'midair', 'shark.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'Heyerdahl', ""n't"", 'mention', 'crew', 'more', 'name', 'narration', 'explain', 'what', 'primary', 'purpose', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'close', 'Still', 'voyage', 'was', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'resultant', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'more', 'excitement', 'narration', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'better', 'sense', 'true', 'danger', 'will', 'also', 'mention', 'Heyerdahl', 'crew', 'be', 'bit', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'beating', 'fresh', 'catch', 'death', 'hammers', 'clubs']",N/A
