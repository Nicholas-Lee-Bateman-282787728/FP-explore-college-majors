1112664,A2T95IH81W2YJZ,B000X07SQ6,Amazon Customer,"[20, 22]","I highly recommend buying this box set.  This is a great value!  I had purchased Season 1 in a store for $39.99.  I couldn't believe that it was on dvd.  I always loved the show.  I decided to check Amazon just to see what the prices were.  Much to my amazement, I saw this package of all three seasons for the same price.  I returned my first purchase to the store and bought this one.  I got an excellent deal on my purchase.  If you don't want to pay a lot of money, then check out the different sellers for the item that you want to buy.  For a brand new item, lots of time their prices beat the price offered by Amazon.  This set is well packaged.  It opens out so that the discs are protected.  Each disc has a side A and side B.  This is clearly stated on the inside of the cover where it lists each episode per disc.  It also gives a little blurp about each episode.  One other thing, the pilot offers commentary from Lynda Carter.  You may turn this feature off.  Each episode is presented unedited.

1112670,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B000X07SQ6,D. A. Reed,"[3, 5]","One of the best superhero shows. Unlike Batman and Superman, who've had multiple movies, TV shows (live action & animated) and actors, this is Wonder Woman's sole venture into television starring in her own show. Say what you want about the animated Justice League/Justice League Unlimited shows (great shows by the way), but this captures Wonder Woman and her message of peace perfectly. Coupled with the fact that Lynda Carter is the only person (I pray that she keep the title) to have ever played her in live-action furthers my belief. I know this was done in the mid to late '70s when violence was being heavily scrutinized but I think that helps the character. She promotes peace and wants man to achieve more than petty violence and war, and pilot movie and a few moments in season 3 aside, pushing or throwing her opponents gets her message across to Nazis and other evildoers (at least she does more than her Super Friends counterpart). Now, onto the series itself.Lynda Carter plays her perfectly. You can tell there's a certain naivet&eacute; to her during the first season, as she's a complete stranger in man's world. Sure Superman came to Earth from Krypton, but he was raised as a human with American ideals and beliefs. I think my best example of this is during the first part of The Feminum Mystique, when she explains to her sister certain aspects of living in the US. This naivet&eacute; is also present in season 2 but not as much. All she really does is update to 1970s living and then she develops for the rest of the series' run. Lyle Waggoner is good as Steve Trevor, but I've never read the actual Wonder Woman comics, so the only thing of Trevor's character I know of is from the series. He's a bit of a chauvinist in the first two seasons (obvious reason in the '40s and the women's libs were starting around the same time in '70s). He's a patriotic man, willing to fight for his country (evident in season one) but once they move the series into the '70s, its almost like the writers didn't know what to do with him since most of the love interest stuff they downplayed and by season 3 the character hardly featured at all. I won't really mention the other characters as they only lasted one season (Blankenship and Etta Candy), only featured for eight episodes (Joe Atkinson) or they were featured characters but dropped by mid-season two (everyone on Paradise Island). They did introduce the computer with an attitude, IRA (who was able to figure out everything before the main cast and only seemed to serve someone for Trevor to talk to when they were limiting his appearances) in season 2 and later, the annoying comic relief that is the Road Runner imitating Rover but fortunately their appearances in episodes are brief.Production-wise, the series makes use of the special effects of the day. Wonder Woman's powers are present, including; super strength, speed (not as fast as Superman and Flash), bullet-proof bracelets, the Lasso of Truth, and her tiara boomerang (like I said, I've never really read the comics so I don't know if she has more or not). Other powers are present, like being able to mimic someone's voice, super-hearing or the occasional one-off power (for some odd reason she was able to send underwater pulses in one season 3 episode) but they weren't really used as much and eventually not at all. The special effects for the bracelets were always cool but I noticed she didn't use them as much later when the series switched to CBS. And of course, the ONE thing I do know that they incorporated into the comics was the spin she did to turn into Wonder Woman. A hallmark of the show that was always looked forward to. She has the invisible plane/jet, of which I'm glad she's not able to fly like in her more recent incarnations, but the effects used for the plane sequences could've been done better, even by '70s standards. She has multiple outfits (again, don't know if they're in the comics) which started in season 2 for some reason; she has a diving suit, a motorcycle suit (basiclly the diving suit with a helmet) and a skate-board suit (this one was only used once). By season 3, they were starting to film her in slow-motion when she runs (akin to Lindsay Wagner) but I think they were only capitalizing on The Bionic Woman's popularity. Villain wise, other than the Nazis and a few of their agents, none of her actual comic book villains appeared in the show like Cheetah, Giganta (both were featured in Challenge of the Super Friends) or Dr. Poison. Instead she battled corrupt business men/politicians (when aren't they evil or corrupt), scientists, aliens, Frank Gorshin or artists and women who have the ability... to control...ants? Hm, not sure where that one came from.The writing is good, but at times can be downright horrible. Whenever they have Carter be evil or pretend to be a criminal, the way she does it isn't convincing and comes off (to me anyway) as stilted and wooden. The occasional big name star would show up like Red Buttons, Stella Stevens, Cloris Leachman, Debra Winger, Robert Reed, Carolyn Jones, Eric Braeden, Roddy McDowall, Leif Garrett, etc. To me, out of the three seasons, the first is the best and I'll get to that in a minute. Season 3 was the weakest, mainly in writing and the fact that Wonder Woman was teaming up with random kids whom you would think Wonder Woman would want to keep out of danger. The second was able to mix the good storytelling of the first season, while dealing with the modern topics that would be present in the third. In season 1, it felt like Wonder Woman had a purpose and was fighting for a cause, the characters were more developed and they were sticking to her comic book roots. Seasons 2 and 3, she battles people who're minor inconveniences, like Martin Mull and his ability to hypnotize people with his magic...flute? Again not sure who came up with that. Her alter-ego Diana Prince featured more as well, which is both a good and bad thing. The good thing is you can develop the character of Diana as her own and its great to see her do stuff outside the Wonder Woman costume. But in a way that's also a bad thing. They started to, in my opinion anyway, decrease the actual Wonder Woman character's apperances and the only time Diana would spin into her was if it was a situation that Diana herself could not get out of. Which makes me think ""Why didn't you just go in as Wonder Woman in the first place?"" But for all the series' good episodes (my favorites being the pilot, Last of the Two Dollar Bills & Judgement From Outer Space from season 1, The Return of Wonder Woman, Anschluss '77, Light Fingered Lady & Screaming Javelin from season 2 and Stolen Faces, Going, Going, Gone, & The Starships Are Coming from season 3) and bad episodes (Formicida, Gault's Brain, My Teenage Idol is Missing and The Murderous Missile), it was an excellent show with great actors and writers, much better than the garbage they show today.",5,"Fighting For Our Rights In The Ol' Red, White & Blue!",1275609600,"06 4,

""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[5, 7]","William Moulton Marston's super-empowered Superheroine comes to vibrant life in this ""blast from the past"" 1976-1979 series. The series shares some of the same ""high camp"" sensibilities as ""Batman"" (1966-1968). But ""Wonder Woman"" holds up much better than ""Batman."" Lynda Carter is the perfect embodiment of the comic book Superheroine, and she portrays her with a captivating sincerity. Like Christopher Reeve as ""Superman"", Lynda Carter plays Wonder Woman as the friend you always wish you had. Carter believes in the feminist message of Wonder Woman and the importance of her mission. She delivers the important Season 1 lines, ""a society that does not respect the power of women is doomed to failure"" with strong conviction.Season 1 is extremely faithful to Wonder Woman's comic book orgins, and is set during World War II.  Amazon Princess Diana discovers the dishy Major Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner from ""The Carol Burnett Show"") after he crash-lands on her mystical home of Paradise Island. After he is nursed back to health, Diana returns with him to America (as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman) to help in the battle against the Nazis. Debra Winger makes a rather inauspicious professional debut as Diana's younger sister Drucilla (A.K.A. ""Wonder Girl."") Wonder Girl is definitely ""Blunder Girl"" when she accidentally gives away the secret location of Paradise Island, which is quickly invaded by Nazis, in the episodes ""The Feminum Mystique, Parts I and II.""Season 1 has a rather innocent charm. But producers wisely realized that the series would not survive if Wonder Woman continued fighting Nazis forever. When the Series switched from ABC to CBS for Seasons 2 and 3, the series zoomed forward in time to ""present day"" 1977-1979.  Ageless  Diana/Wonder Woman returns to America to work at the Inter-Agency Defense Command (The ""I.A.D.C.) with Steve Trevor, Jr. Lyle Waggoner returns as the son of the character he portrayed in Season 1. Producer Douglas S. Cramer decided to extinquish any romantic sparks between Diana and Steve. Steve became Diana's boss at the I.A.D.C. and their relationship remained platonic.  Wonder Woman wasn't quite finished fighting Nazis. A mad scientist creates a clone of Hitler in the episode ""Anschuluss '77."" Other ghosts, and a terrible misunderstanding, from World War II are confronted in the episode ""The Man Who Could Move The World.'Diana/Wonder Woman often went off on exciting missions on her own, fighting mad scientists, a manicial magician, a demented toymaker, a disembodied brain, and several alien terrorists from outer space (""Mind Stealers From Outer Space, Part I and II"" and ""The Boy Who Knew Her Secret, Part I and II"")!Memorable guest stars include John Saxon,  Cloris Leachman, Fannie Flagg, Carolyn Jones, Beatrice Straight,  Robert Reed and Eve Plumb (both from ""The Brady Bunch""), Jessica Walter (""Arrested Development""), Roddy McDowall, Dack Rambo (""All My Children""),  Rick Springfield  (""General Hospital""),  Henry Gibson (""Laugh-In"").

The quality is fantastic in this series & the bonus features are pretty good as well. Lynda Carter has given the Wonder Woman comic book hero life in all 3 seasons. Her acting can not be touched for this series, there is an innocence about Wonder Woman that Lynda Carter had clearly portrayed in this series. Lynda was clearly born to portray this beautiful, smart & compassionate super hero, she has done this super hero justice. Season 1 is the best in the series dealing with the war of the Nazis, many of my favorite episodes are within season 1. Seasons 2 & 3 are just as good but the war is not over,.. technology & man create havoc for the young princess Diana making each episode a joy to watch.

1112698,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000X07SQ6,Taheen Lopez,"[2, 31]","I don't see why Warner Bros. felt a need to have to make a complete series DVD box set of WONDER WOMAN during these tough economic times.So I'm wondering if this is just another gimmick that Warner Bros. to try to make extra money to try to squeeze our hard earned cash during all these budget cuts going on right now or is Warner Bros. trying to compensate for all the flaws that they had in some of the WONDER WOMAN DVD box sets that were shown inadequeately.Perhaps Warner Bros. got the idea to make a WONDER WOMAN:THE COMPLETE COLLECTION DVD box set from Universal since Universal had released a complete series DVD box set of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, KNIGHT RIDER, and MIAMI VICE last year(2008)in order for Warner Bros. to compete with Universal, despite this stinkin recession were in right now.However, I suspect that this complete series DVD box set of WONDER WOMAN is no better and is probably no more siginificant than the first 3 individual season box sets of WONDER WOMAN for that matter either, unless of course this DVD box set may have a bonus material episode telling us both the producers and Lynda Carter's experience while filming WONDER WOMAN in the 1970's and what led to its cancellation on CBS and all, kind of like the bonus features on the last 3 seasons of THE INCREDIBLE HULK DVD's did, especially on THE INCREDIBLE HULK-SEASON 5 DVD when creator(Ken Johnson)explained how and why CBS had ended up cancelling THE INCREDIBLE HULK all of the sudden back in November of 1981 in the middle of its Fifth Season, due to budget cuts & controversy at CBS.Therefore when CBS had abruptly cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK back in the mid Fall of 1981; it was quite similar to when CBS had abruptly cancelled WONDER WOMAN in September of 1979 since I was under the impression that WONDER WOMAN was starting a 4th Season when the last 2 episodes ""The Man Who Couldn't Die"" and ""Phantom Of The Rollercoaster"" were shown on their original air-dates on CBS for the very first time, but I was wrong since CBS had cancelled WONDER WOMAN in mid September of 1979, which was perhaps due to a big slump in ratings, unlike the case with THE INCREDIBLE HULK.As a matter of fact, THE INCREDIBLE HULK had better ratings than WONDER WOMAN did and had even lasted longer than WONDER WOMAN did too even though CBS had unfortunately cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK 2 years later after CBS had cancelled WONDER WOMAN since the special-effects on THE INCREDIBLE HULK got too expensive due to budget cuts from the recession we had in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president along with the fact that various people felt that the Hulk was running out of steam on top of that even though the ratings on THE INCREDIBLE HULK were still high enough to last another season.Anyway since Warner Bros. has made this WONDER WOMAN:THE COMPLETE COLLECTION DVD box set like Universal has made a THE INCREDIBLE HULK: THE COMPLETE SERIES DVD box set; this box set takes me all the way back to memory lane when both WONDER WOMAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK were part of CBS's Friday night line-up back in 1978 and 1979 when WONDER WOMAN was on every Friday night at 8PM followed by THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 9PM.In addition something else I noticed about both WONDER WOMAN & THE INCREDIBLE HULK was I noticed that a lot of the people who guest starred on WONDER WOMAN had also later guest starred on THE INCREDIBLE HULK too like Albert Popwell, Peter-Mark Richman(SANTA BARBARA), Jared Martin(DALLAS), Saundra Sharp, Taaffe O'Connell, Rick Springfield(GENERAL HOSPITAL), Henry Darrow(SANTA BARBARA), Al White, Denny Miller, Art Metrano, Bradford Dillman, John Reilly(ALL MY CHILDREN), Michael Baseleon, Nicholas Coster(AS THE WORLD TURNS), Frank Marth, George Caldwell, Christine Belford, Richard Narita, Frank Doubleday, Dick O'Neill, Ron Lombard, David White, Charlie Brill(SILK STALKINGS), etc.",3,In Her Satin Tights
