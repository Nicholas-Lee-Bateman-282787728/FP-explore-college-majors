1199898,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001HCQVSK,B. E Jackson,"[1, 3]","Fetching Cody is quite the unusual film. It doesn't really fall under one specific category but rather *numerous* categories. It has a subtle amount of sincerity, it includes a small share of funny elements, and there's a realistic message behind it all.However, there's definitely a fair amount of cheesy, adolescent humor as well which explains why I'm dragging down the rating a couple notches.It's about a young drug addict and his girlfriend who walk around the city streets all day communicating with each other, having fun and doing drugs, and eventually one night -to the boyfriends horrible surprise- the girlfriend falls into a coma from an overdose. Soon after, the boyfriend stumbles across a time machine by way of a recliner. Yes that's right- an armchair. ""Oh boy is *this* gonna be a disaster"" I was thinking to myself.However it wasn't THAT bad. Obviously the time machine was used so the boyfriend can travel back in time and prevent the girl from ever considering taking drugs, but constant illogical decision making on his part happens to make the situations even WORSE.There's really only three specific times he goes back in time to try and change the past.One- when his girlfriend was playing volleyball in gym class and all her classmates were making fun of her. He tries to prevent a certain... embarrassing thing from happening to her (sorry, it's inappropriate to discuss what I'm referring to right here on amazon).Two- when this dude was trying to kill himself by shooting his brains out in his back yard. I believe they said he was the brother of the girlfriend (and by the way, I forgot to mention the girlfriends name is Cody, hence the movie title). Anyway, as horrible as this is to admit, these segments were actually quite funny. No ladies and gentlemen- suicide is obviously NOT even remotely funny, but the way the movie writers portray it here, yes, you'll be laughing too, believe me.Three- when he tries to break up the relationship between his girlfriend and another guy she was dating during the Christmas holiday.The boyfriend constantly tries changing the past in these specific instances.The conclusion wasn't too good, and even though the storytelling throughout the movie may have been quite cheesy, it was definitely well meaning too.

1199904,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B001HCQVSK,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[1, 2]","This film did not get any distribution originally, but I have a feeling Jay's performance in Tropic Thunder helped this get a re-release this week. Filmed in Canada with loads of indie production companies backing them, the crew/cast managed to make a decent indie about trying to help the one you love, even whilst prostituting yourself, being strung out and homeless.Granted, it is difficult to feel anything for our main character played by Jay, as he is a drug dealing, part-time prostitute who gets high all day. Yet he still has managed to find a diamond in the girl played adequatley by Sarah Lind. Amongst their tragedies, he manages to find a time traveling chair that he uses to try and right the wrongs in his love's earlier life. Yes, there are an incredible amount of gaping plot holes (counted roughly 20 different time line missteps) and bad scenes (an arresting officer throws two drug dealers in the back of his car with no cuffs to save time), but I realized this was about the love story and not the logistics.The DVD has a small production featurette, which did contain a quick brief with the lady who was supervising the time line issues - she stated she was just having fun, so I would venture to say the continuity issues were not on the front burner. The DVD cover art talks about all the other films Jay has done/is doing so it is good to see some of his other work getting some press. If it were rated it would be R for language and drugs, and I would give it 3.5 stars for the heart that went into making it. Having just reviewed this and Holly, the whole ambiguous ending theme wore on me a little. I would say give it a try though.",3,"Time travel, love and a few hidden performances",1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,1660,"['film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'distribution', 'originally', 'have', 'feeling', 'Jay', 'performance', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'helped', 'get', 're-release', 'week', 'Filmed', 'Canada', 'loads', 'indie', 'production', 'companies', 'backing', 'crew/cast', 'managed', 'make', 'decent', 'indie', 'trying', 'help', 'one', 'love', 'even', 'whilst', 'prostituting', 'being', 'strung', 'out', 'homeless.Granted', 'difficult', 'feel', 'anything', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Jay', 'drug', 'dealing', 'part-time', 'prostitute', 'who', 'high', 'day', 'still', 'managed', 'find', 'diamond', 'girl', 'played', 'adequatley', 'Sarah', 'Lind', 'Amongst', 'tragedies', 'find', 'time', 'traveling', 'chair', 'try', 'right', 'wrongs', 'love', 'earlier', 'life', 'Yes', 'are', 'incredible', 'amount', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'counted', 'roughly', '20', 'different', 'time', 'line', 'missteps', 'bad', 'scenes', 'arresting', 'officer', 'two', 'drug', 'dealers', 'back', 'car', 'cuffs', 'save', 'time', 'realized', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'logistics.The', 'DVD', 'small', 'production', 'featurette', 'did', 'contain', 'quick', 'brief', 'lady', 'who', 'was', 'supervising', 'time', 'line', 'issues', 'stated', 'was', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'would', 'venture', 'say', 'continuity', 'issues', 'were', 'not', 'front', 'burner', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art', 'talks', 'other', 'films', 'Jay', 'done/is', 'doing', 'good', 'see', 'other', 'work', 'getting', 'press', 'were', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'R', 'language', 'drugs', 'would', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'heart', 'went', 'making', 'Having', 'just', 'reviewed', 'Holly', 'whole', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'theme', 'wore', 'little', 'would', 'say', 'give', 'try']",Fetching Cody

Not exactly a total failure, thanks to the excellent work from the star Jay Baruchel (""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" the 2010 live-action fantasy opposite Nicholas Cage), but ""Fetching Cody"" still needs a more thought-out script and better, more imaginative, direction.To save his girlfriend Cody (Sarah Lind) who has fallen into coma (probably because of overdose), drug peddler Art Frankel (Jay Baruchel) goes back in time using the recliner-looking time machine his homeless friend Harvey (Jim Byrnes) found in a dumpster. Art thinks he can change his girlfriend's fate by offering timely help to her, but things turn out more difficult than he thought. In the first place, how much does he really know about the life of ""Cody""?Like ""The Butterfly Effect"" (2004), the story of ""Fetching Cody"" revolves around a young man in love, or the relations between Cody and Art. The difference is that ""Fetching Cody"" is not a thriller (though it includes one over-the-top death scene). ""Fetching Cody"" is more about the two characters, especially Art who desperately trying to understand what he should have done, or what he should do.Despite its intriguing underlying premise, however, the end result doesn't really deliver, wasting every chance to make the story more interesting. The narrative is drawn-out, the characters are flat, and the conclusion is disappointingly weak.
