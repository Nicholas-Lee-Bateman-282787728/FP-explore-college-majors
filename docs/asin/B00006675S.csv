I recently decided to rent it for my 6 year old son, and what a treat it is!  Biscuit Eater tells the story of two young boys, Text and Lonnie (one African American and one Caucasian), and their adventure training a seemingly un-trainable bird dog.  Lonnie's father trains dogs professionally but has given up on the one they call biscuit eater, so he unloads the dog on local store owner Willie Dorsey (played with great humor and gusto by Godfrey Cambridge).  Lonnie and his friend Text hatch a scheme to get the dog back, and after doing so they discover that he is actually a diamond-in-the-rough champion bird dog that just needs the right kind of training.  They boys end up competing in a local bird dog competition with a good chance of winning, but due to unforeseen circumstances they are forced to choose between victory and family loyalty.The Biscuit Eater harkens back to a gentler era of film-making and I'm sure some will accuse it of being boring (though I would totally disagree).  It is gently paced and relies heavily on story, plot, and character relationships unlike many modern kids' movies.  There are wonderful themes of racial unity, family loyalty, and community solidarity along the way and the idyllic rural life setting is wholesome and endearing.  This movie is nothing like most modern children's movies that rely on heavy doses of slapstick, sarcasm, hyper paced editing, and adolescent pretension.  I loved this one, and more importantly so did my 6 year old son.  If you're looking for something for the kids that isn't just entertaining but is also uplifting, you'll do well by the Biscuit Eater.",4,Sweet & Wholesome To the Core and Vastly Enjoyable,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,1813,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'weekly', 'broadcasts', 'network', 'tv', 'kid', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'Biscuit', 'Eater', 'point', 'long', 'have', 'memory', 'recently', 'decided', 'rent', '6', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'what', 'treat', 'Biscuit', 'Eater', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'Text', 'Lonnie', 'one', 'African', 'American', 'one', 'Caucasian', 'adventure', 'training', 'seemingly', 'un-trainable', 'bird', 'dog', 'Lonnie', 'father', 'trains', 'dogs', 'professionally', 'given', 'up', 'one', 'call', 'biscuit', 'eater', 'dog', 'local', 'store', 'owner', 'Willie', 'Dorsey', 'played', 'great', 'humor', 'gusto', 'Godfrey', 'Cambridge', 'Lonnie', 'friend', 'Text', 'hatch', 'scheme', 'get', 'dog', 'back', 'doing', 'so', 'discover', 'actually', 'diamond-in-the-rough', 'champion', 'bird', 'dog', 'just', 'right', 'kind', 'training', 'boys', 'end', 'up', 'competing', 'local', 'bird', 'dog', 'competition', 'good', 'chance', 'winning', 'due', 'unforeseen', 'circumstances', 'are', 'forced', 'choose', 'victory', 'family', 'loyalty.The', 'Biscuit', 'Eater', 'back', 'gentler', 'era', 'film-making', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'accuse', 'being', 'boring', 'would', 'totally', 'disagree', 'gently', 'paced', 'relies', 'heavily', 'story', 'plot', 'character', 'relationships', 'many', 'modern', 'kids', 'movies', 'are', 'wonderful', 'themes', 'racial', 'unity', 'family', 'loyalty', 'community', 'solidarity', 'way', 'idyllic', 'rural', 'life', 'setting', 'wholesome', 'endearing', 'movie', 'nothing', 'most', 'modern', 'children', 'movies', 'rely', 'heavy', 'doses', 'slapstick', 'sarcasm', 'hyper', 'paced', 'editing', 'adolescent', 'pretension', 'loved', 'one', 'more', 'importantly', 'so', 'did', '6', 'year', 'old', 'son', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'kids', ""n't"", 'just', 'entertaining', 'also', 'uplifting', ""'ll"", 'do', 'well', 'Biscuit', 'Eater']",The Biscuit Eater
