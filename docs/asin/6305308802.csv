It is a pity that all of Steve Martin's good  films were made during the 80s - I hope that he rediscovers fun for the OOs  (?)This is a good transfer, the picture quality is excellent.

Alas, that silly guy has all but disappeared in the tamer '90's. Of course, I'm talking about that wild and crazy guy Steve Martin. This is, by far, Steve's funniest movie(besides The Jerk). He plays a prominent brain surgeon who falls for a gold digging hussy(played seductively wicked by Kathleen Turner). Once the new wife shows her true colors, our beloved doctor falls in love with a &quot;special&quot; brain he finds in the lab of a mad scientist(David Warner). Where else would he find it?. He can hear the brain's thoughts. The voice of the brain supplied by Sissy Spacek. It shows how much a man can fall for a woman's mind, rather than her body. Martin is a master genius. That much is true. He delivers one of his most memorable comedic performances. Kathleen Turner is wonderfully bitchy in the role. Who else is more suited?. The gags are silly and some are over the top. But, it works. Martin has a knack for making simple things laugh out loud funny. He also has a way of making silly things look downright intelligent. He can make walking down the street funny. That's the sign of a true comedian. Carl Reiner directed this comedy classic. Watch out for the 'Elevator Killer'. It's one of the better jokes.

I don't understand why this movie couldn't be released with both wide screen and full screen format, but there you go.  With this DVD, we only get the full screen release.  That doesn't take away from how funny the movie is, and maybe I am just being nit picky as is my way sometimes....Anyway, Steve Martin stars as Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr, a world-renowned brain surgeon, who has developed a new method of brain surgery called the cranial screw top method.  It involves unscrewing the top of a person's skull for easy access and much faster recovery time.Suffering the recent loss of his wife, he accidentally hits a woman named Dolores, played by Kathleen Turner, with his car.  She suffers a massive head injury, and Steve Martin is the only one who can save her.  She also bears a remarkable resemblance to his deceased wife.  He saves her, they fall in love, and get married.  Only problem is she is a conniving, cheating, lying, evil woman who's main interest is money and infuriating her husbands, making the veins stand out on their foreheads.During their honeymoon trip to Europe, Dr. Hfuhruhurr meets a fellow scientist who has perfected a method of keeping brains alive in jars.  During a visit, one of these brains, that of a woman, begins to talk to him, through telepathy of some sort, and they develop a relationship.  Realizing his feelings are growing for this bodiless brain, he drifts away from his wife and even begins scheming to replace his wife's brain with that of Anne, the brain in the jar.There's a lot more, but that's the gist.  This is a very funny sci-fi comedy movie, in the vein of a Young Frankenstein, but not as good.  This is what I call 'old style' Steve Martin, the more rowdy, raucous, animated Steve from the old days of SNL and The Jerk, before he became more refined and sophisticated.  I still think he's funny now, but I just never got into that whole Father of the Bride/LA Story comedy.  Lots of sight gags, some slapstick and profanity, and a little nudity, which give this movie an R rating.  No extras, no wide screen format, but still a lot of fun.

Now that I've enjoyed watching both of these movies on this two-sided DVD (each movie occupying one side), I'm deeply grateful that I got this DVD, because &#34;My Blue Heaven&#34; is wonderful!My Blue Heaven is the only movie I've seen Steve Martin doing an impression of a mafioso, and he pulls it off brilliantly. In fact, this deserves to be known as one of Steve Martin's best movies ever! The plot involves Steve Martin's character, Vincent Antonelli, a New York mobster, being relocated to the New Jersey suburbs as &#34;Todd Wilkenson&#34; as part of a witness protection program. Much of the ensuing humorous situations stem from the assorted problems his character gets into with the local police and local judge, and the way he is repeatedly excused from criminal activity by the man assigned to look after him by the FBI, played by Rick Moranis. This is a true romantic comedy, with the local DA (played by Joan Cusack) falling in love with the FBI protector, thanks to a good deal of assistance from Vinnie. Truly a classic!The Man With Two Brains is campy, good-natured comedic fun. Steve Martin plays the role of a brain surgeon who's invented a novel way of &#34;unscrewing&#34; peoples' heads to more quickly access the brain.

459597,A8S11VP9Z36D6,6305308802,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[3, 4]","This film which is over 20 years old does more than just hold up...it remains a comic masterpiece that bears repeated viewings. Each time you will find a new comic detail...including the name of the window cleaner used to kill people (""Pane in the Glass""). Steve Martin and Kathleen Turner are a comic pair made in heaven. Martin shines as Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr, the surgeon who invented the Screw-Top Zip-Lock Brain Surgery Technique. His beloved first wife is already dead; with his car he accidentally hits the wickedly beautiful Delores Benedict (Turner) who has just tortured her rich husband into having a fatal heart attack. The Doctor saves her with his surgery technique and then marries her, under the delusion that she is a sweet woman. She tortures him by witholding sex, sleeping with the hired help, and showing no respect for all that he holds dear. While on a European honeymoon that will hopefully spark their first sexual encounter, the Doctor meets Dr. Alfred Necessiter, a scientist who can transfer the knowledge from a disembodied brain into another body. And where do these dead bodies come from? Why, the infamous European Elevator Killer, of course! The reveal of his identity at the end of the film is sheer comic genius. The Doctor discovers how evil Delores truly is, while at the same time, he finds that he has a telekinetic connection to one of Necessiter's brains in a jar. How it all comes together at the end is perfection. Martin's extremely dry delivery and love of physical comedy is matched by Turner, who doesn't mind getting down and dirty (literally...as she is pushed into the mud when it is learned that she is truly a scheming witch only after the Doctor's inheritance). It is difficult to do justice to this comic masterpiece with a summary, so all I can say is get it! However, this DVD edition has a few major strikes...there are NO extras...not even a friggin' theatrical trailer. The picture is also cropped to full-screen (modified from the original widescreen). On the plus side, the picture is excellent quality.

This film displays the considerable talents of the former as an experienced director and the latter as a still young comedian making a solid mark in film after success in Television. In addition to their major primary contributions, they made up 2/3 of the writing team. The plot is outlined in Amazon's lead review leaving me only to emphasize that Martin is given ample latitude for his still fresh physical comedy as well as his ability to get off the comic line. He is excellent. So, too, are the many sight-gags built into the scenic design in a Marxian (as in Marx Brothers) and (Buster) keatonesque fashion. As Martin's beautiful but vicious wife, Kathleen Turner does all that could be done with the role. Supporting cast does its thing commendably with Estelle Reiner (Mrs. R.) making a very brief appearance as a victim of the elevator killer (which allows a familiar face to be seen in a Hope-Crosby sort of cameo).

Kathleen Turner gets most of them, and I think it's her earnest delivery of them that makes them so funny:*When Steve Martin comes home and Turner tells him she fired their gardener Ramon, Martin asks why, and she says he came up behind her and grabbed her breasts.  ""He was measuring for a new hood ornament.""*When Martin comes home and finds a man examining Turner's butt, he is furious and orders the man out of the house, who just happened to pay fifteen thousand dollars for the honor of adoring her fanny.  In a rage, she says ""You never wanted me to have a job of my own.  A career of my own.""*When Martin and Turner engage in a fight, he kicks her in the groin area and she quips, ""Ow..right in the balls.""There are more great lines, and Martin and Turner's delivery is sublime; I'm not sure they would have been as good if delivered by other actors.

This movie has SO many memorable moments, many of them gloriously ridiculous, many sublimely subtle. Martin, in his early films such as THE JERK, was all over the map, mining for humor.  Low humor, physical humor, verbal humor, satire, it didn't matter as long as it might be funny.This is a low budget movie with some delightfully twisted moments.  Martin plays famed brained surgeon, Dr. Huffarahrr (or something like that) who marries one of his patients, the beautiful (but evil) Kathleen Turner, hot off her great role in BODY HEAT.  The movie's plot is hardly important though...it mostly revolves around brain surgery jokes and humor at Martin's expense because he is so desparate for intimate relations with his wife, who is mostly hoping he'll die so she can take his money.  When Martin falls in love with a disembodied brain (don't ask), things just get weirder.  (The brain is voiced by Sissy Spacek, by the way.)That summary probably doesn't make much sense, but the main thing to remember is that the movie is funny.  It feels a bit like a TV movie in its production quality, and it's opening credit style and background music firmly date this movie to the early '80s.  And there's a HUGE Merv Griffin joke, so you'd better know who Merv Griffin is.  Much of the joke is ""low"" humor, but it's so well done, so over-the-top, that you can't help but smile.Man With Two Brains is hardly a work of genius.  It isn't as solid as ALL OF ME or PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES, which are slicker films with true hearts...but it is good, dirty fun for 90 minutes.  Martin is very funny and we are reminded of his early ""glory days"" as the nation's hottest comic.  Kathleen Turner is a hoot, and it's fun to remember what a bombshell femme fatale she was.  The usually reserved and impeccable David Warner (Titanic, Time After Time) gets to get a little unhinged here, and that's fun too.  There's a guaranteed laugh about every 60 seconds, so that's a lot of laughs.  The movie is VERY inexpensive now, so I heartily recommend taking a look.Word of warning...the DVD has NO extras.

I saw it on Amazon recently and was eager to pick up a copy and see what I think to it now.I found it to be a fun movie.  It has a definite ""80's"" feel to it that I liked.  It made me smile in a few places, but I didn't find it a hilarious ""laugh-a-minute"" type movie experience.  The movie had a very ""cartoon"" type feel to it - with some scenarios being quite ridiculous (but still fun!)It's not the greatest film I've ever seen.  The dialogue was weak and awkward in places and sometimes it was just a bit too strange for my tastes.  But it's a fun movie anyways.  One I'll keep, although not one I'll want to re-watch too regularly.",3,Fun movie,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,749,"['remember', 'watching', 'movie', 'kid', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'recall', 'much', 'other', 'enjoyed', 'saw', 'Amazon', 'recently', 'was', 'eager', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'now.I', 'found', 'be', 'fun', 'movie', 'definite', '80', 'feel', 'liked', 'made', 'smile', 'few', 'places', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'hilarious', 'laugh-a-minute', 'type', 'movie', 'experience', 'movie', 'had', 'very', 'cartoon', 'type', 'feel', 'scenarios', 'being', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'still', 'fun', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'dialogue', 'was', 'weak', 'awkward', 'places', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'strange', 'tastes', 'fun', 'movie', 'anyways', 'One', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'not', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 're-watch', 'too', 'regularly']",The Man with Two Brains
