But, it is nice that this collection has the entire third season, as opposed to Family Guy and American Dad with their ""volumes"" of 16 episodes (don't get me wrong, I still buy them, but still...).I really enjoy the show.  I may be paraphrasing Seth MacFarlane, but Cleveland was such a laid back character on Family Guy, we really didn't get to know him too well.  He has really come into his own in Stoolbend, and the supporting cast is great too (I'm also not sure if Cleveland Jr. is really smart or really dumb).My favorite episode is probably ""Die Semi-Hard""; I love a good spoof, and that was a great spoof of Die Hard.",4,"Really like the series, but not happy about the DVD-R Format",1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,714,"['prior', 'reviewers', ""'m"", 'not', 'happy', 'DVD-R', 'Format', 'lack', 'extras', 'nice', 'collection', 'entire', 'third', 'season', 'opposed', 'Family', 'Guy', 'American', 'Dad', 'volumes', '16', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'buy', 'still', '.I', 'really', 'enjoy', 'show', 'may', 'be', 'paraphrasing', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'Cleveland', 'was', 'such', 'laid', 'back', 'character', 'Family', 'Guy', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'too', 'well', 'really', 'come', 'own', 'Stoolbend', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'too', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'sure', 'Cleveland', 'Jr.', 'really', 'smart', 'really', 'dumb', '.My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'probably', 'Die', 'Semi-Hard', 'love', 'good', 'spoof', 'was', 'great', 'spoof', 'Die', 'Hard']",The Cleveland Show Season 3

This is better than nothing, but we fans don't get the extras we've come to love and appreciate. STILL... I guess we should be happy that we have this. However, for being a DVD-R product, the quality was pretty good.Now, for me, this leads to other questions... Is ""Bob's Burgers"" - a rather recent and most outstanding show - going to follow suit?

My main reason for purchasing the season sets is to get the deleted scenes and creator commentaries. I'll hold off until a release of what I have come to expect comes about.
