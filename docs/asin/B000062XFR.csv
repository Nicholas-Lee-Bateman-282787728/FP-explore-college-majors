How did it happen? Because, many Korean movie goers were so inured to Hollywood style hyperbolic action movies , virluently romanticized gangster movies, and not-so-funny comedy movies that painfully realistic movies such as Failan were nothing other than 2 hours of painfully boring experience. But, slowly people began to pay attention to this movie due to excellent acting and heartbreaking romance that is subtle ,but highly emotive.The plot of the movie is roughly based on a short story of a certain Japanese writer named Jiro Asada. But , the movie version is much more romanticized , so much so that two works hardly have any similarities , apart from the eventual tragic endings and the name of female protagonists. the movies begins with very brief scence of Failan(means While lily , symbolizes her premature death)'s arrival of Inchon( second biggest port of Korea) from mainland China in order to search for her relatives who allegedly resided in Korea. The plot revolves around and jump back and forth between Failan's life in Korea( yeah , it shows all shoddy, seamy,sordid sides of 12th biggest economy in the world) and third class thug Kang Jae . There are frequent flash backs that may disconcert some viewers and give a slight hard time to follow and assemble the whole plot, but when movies moves to climax (or anti-climax ) you surely can forget the plot but absorbed to the superb acting of two main protagonists. Unlike some idiotic reviews , the movie is more than worth watching. I heard that a Hollywood studio recently begin to shooting remake version of this movie.

It's the heart-wrenching kind so unless you're okay with feeling blue after the movie, avoid this bittersweet tale of sorrow and regret.Failan is about a down and out gangster whose miserable life just got more so when he learns of the death of his wife - a young woman by the name of Failan whom he has never met. As he goes through the process of identifying the body and other last rites, he slowly learns more and more about the person who was his wife only on paper. The journey of discovery is told with such grace that one can't help but feel for the both of them.Initially, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was its tempo, but in retrospect, it was masterfully paced.  However, this realization took a lot of patience because the first 40 minutes of the movie was almost soley about the man. Now, I know it's important to engage the audience by following the subject for a while but I think 40 minutes is a bit too long. That said, I wonder if that might have been one of the keys to the movie's surprising ability to touch you during the final scenes. You feel a bit more compassionate towards him because you understood where he's coming from. That he, unlike his boss, was a good person at heart.Once in a great while, a movie comes along and is able to significantly affect your perception of the human condition. This is one of them.

The film makers were very meticulous in photographing the landscapes of the two lead actors' faces that emits such sadness and desperation.  Choi Minsik, looking less menacing than in ""Shiri"" plays a no good gangster who  can't seem to do anything right.  For some quick cash, he marries a Chinese immigrant lovingly played by Cecelia Cheung.  The Minsik character was teasingly urge by his buddy who arranged the deal to see what his new wife looks like, but in true form, he just takes the money and goes along his merry way.  I think this is the most pivotal part of the movie, becuase if he would have just taken a second look, he would have seen a face exactly like himself, desperate, kind hearted and just needing someone to care a little bit, it would have touched him and it could have changed the tragic course of his life.  Minsik and Cheung, [...]played their part so well, that you can almost put them in the ""Most tragic romantic couple"" list.  These two actors are  so crafted in acting out their parts, that this is one of the reasons why this movie is soo endearing.

692191,A28RXZ72BE0UQC,B000062XFR,Kosmos,"[0, 0]","Regardless of how you ended in this main page for Failan (especially if you were browsing on Choi MinShik's movies), I definitely recommend that you at least watch it one time in your life. Even if tearjerkers are not your cup of tea, it will be a very enriching experience. It will be very difficult not to be touched emotionally and asking yourself a lot questions about what you just watched. I will try not to repeat many insightful points made by the many excellent reviews here, and just say that I wholeheartedly agree with them. Thus, I can also confirm that the few negative reviews are just disingenuous to say the least.The same director made the movie ""Our Happy Times"" (aka Maundy Thursday), another fine movie of the same caliber. Read reviews on imdb.com. I also recommend ""More Than Blue"" featuring Lee BoYoung, one of the best and beautiful actresses in Korea, along with Lee NaYoung (Our Happy Times). Personally I can watch these movies many times alone or with others and always get a fresh perspective and feel something deep in my soul as if you were watching it for the first time. Good movies like these will leave you with lingering questions well after their ending. I have downloaded these movies in my device through Samsung Media Hub at a very low price. You can preview these movies by searching the internet before you buy them. Other Korean movies that I like are: A Man From Nowhere, War Of The Arrows, and Once Upon A Time(2008 with Lee Bo Young).I did not like A Sad Movie as much as others did. It is ok but definitely not at the same level as Failan and the other two I mentioned above. I agree that Choi MinShik is a great actor but never liked that much his other successful movies like Old Boy, Saw the Devil, and Shiri. And if you come across A Moment To Remember and The Classic, they were a total waste of time.A test for a high-quality movie is whether you want to watch it more than one time, as many times as needed if you have to watch it with friends and loved ones. If you cannot bring yourself to watch it again or are indifferent then something is wrong. Only then is it worth paying the price of purchase. I cannot remember how many times I watched movies from the great Akira Kurosawa, Kon Ichikawa (The Burmese Harp), Masahiro Shinoda (Double Suicide), Yasuhiro Ozu (Autumn Afternoon), and of Masaki Kobayashi (Harakiri & Human Condition). I will be doing the same with movies from director Song HaeSung and the other Korean directors of the above mentioned movies.",5,Beautiful Poetry - Examine Your Life Before It Is Too Late,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,2519,"['Regardless', 'how', 'ended', 'main', 'page', 'Failan', 'especially', 'were', 'browsing', 'Choi', 'MinShik', 'movies', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'least', 'watch', 'one', 'time', 'life', 'Even', 'tearjerkers', 'are', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'enriching', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'not', 'be', 'touched', 'emotionally', 'asking', 'lot', 'questions', 'what', 'just', 'watched', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'repeat', 'many', 'insightful', 'points', 'made', 'many', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'here', 'just', 'say', 'wholeheartedly', 'agree', 'Thus', 'can', 'also', 'confirm', 'few', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'just', 'disingenuous', 'say', 'least.The', 'same', 'director', 'made', 'movie', 'Happy', 'Times', 'Maundy', 'Thursday', 'fine', 'movie', 'same', 'caliber', 'Read', 'reviews', 'imdb.com', 'also', 'recommend', 'More', 'Than', 'Blue', 'featuring', 'Lee', 'BoYoung', 'one', 'best', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'Korea', 'Lee', 'NaYoung', 'Happy', 'Times', 'Personally', 'can', 'watch', 'movies', 'many', 'times', 'alone', 'others', 'always', 'get', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'feel', 'something', 'deep', 'soul', 'were', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'Good', 'movies', 'will', 'leave', 'lingering', 'questions', 'well', 'ending', 'have', 'downloaded', 'movies', 'device', 'Samsung', 'Media', 'Hub', 'very', 'low', 'price', 'can', 'preview', 'movies', 'searching', 'internet', 'buy', 'Other', 'Korean', 'movies', 'like', 'are', 'Man', 'Nowhere', 'War', 'Arrows', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', '2008', 'Lee', 'Bo', 'Young', '.I', 'did', 'not', 'A', 'Sad', 'Movie', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'did', 'ok', 'definitely', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'Failan', 'other', 'two', 'mentioned', 'agree', 'Choi', 'MinShik', 'great', 'actor', 'never', 'liked', 'much', 'other', 'successful', 'movies', 'Old', 'Boy', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'Shiri', 'come', 'A', 'Moment', 'Remember', 'Classic', 'were', 'total', 'waste', 'time.A', 'test', 'high-quality', 'movie', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'one', 'time', 'many', 'times', 'needed', 'have', 'watch', 'friends', 'loved', 'ones', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'watch', 'again', 'are', 'indifferent', 'then', 'something', 'wrong', 'Only', 'then', 'worth', 'paying', 'price', 'purchase', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watched', 'movies', 'great', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Kon', 'Ichikawa', 'Burmese', 'Harp', 'Masahiro', 'Shinoda', 'Double', 'Suicide', 'Yasuhiro', 'Ozu', 'Autumn', 'Afternoon', 'Masaki', 'Kobayashi', 'Harakiri', 'Human', 'Condition', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'same', 'movies', 'director', 'Song', 'HaeSung', 'other', 'Korean', 'directors', 'above', 'mentioned', 'movies']",Failan
692192,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000062XFR,Linda Linguvic,"[21, 21]","The 2001 Korean film won some Asian festival awards but is otherwise little known.  It's an interesting story about a young Chinese woman, played by Cecilia Chuung, who wants to make her home in Korea. Her parents have died and she has spent all her money to come to Korea in search of an aunt who has long since moved away. She lovely, she's young and she's penniless.In the meantime there is a aging low-level gangster, played by Min-sik Cho, who has just come out of jail.  He lives in a rough tough world and he seems stuck there.  Life is hard for him, he lives in a dump and he is nothing but a pawn for the gang leader who tyrannically rules over him.  He'd love to return to the fishing village of his childhood but this does not seem possible as he has agreed to serve time in jail for his boss who has just committed a murder.In order to stay in Korea the young woman had to marry a Korean and she and the gangster have had a paper marriage for about a year.  She's sick though.  We see her coughing blood when she goes for a job as a prostitute.  It seems a ruse at first, a way of not having to work at the oldest profession, but the audience soon learns that her disease is real.  She does get a job though, working as a laundress.  The work is hard and backbreaking but she gets into it, even does extra work, and the woman she works for comes to love and respect her.She's never met the gangster she married, but she's obsessed by him.  She writes him letters thanking him for his kindness and even makes a trip to his town to get a glimpse of him.  He reads her letters over and over.  She's the only one that seems to care for him.The acting is extraordinary, especially that of the gangster.  His face is full of expression and he makes the audience really understand his character.  It's a challenging role.  And he just shines.The ending is sad, however.  And inevitable.This film isn't perfect but It gave me a glimpse into a world that is otherwise closed to me.

692193,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B000062XFR,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 1]","I first watched ""Failan"" right after watching the Iranian filmBaran, another film about the untried or untaken chances of the heart, and you have to believe I was about ready to cash in my chips; two thwarted love stories - two tearjerkers, really - probably not something I want to repeat again in one evening.  Yes, I suppose that's a ""spoiler"" but I think you need to know at least that before coming to this powerful, almost unbearable film.Like ""Baran"" this has a story with a twist that happens early; but you may well not catch it, or not catch it right away - I didn't at first, whether through not paying close enough attention or somewhat poor subtitles, I don't know. So I'll try not to spoil it. Basically we have two parallel stories; as the film opens we see a very young Chinese woman, Failan (Cecilia Cheung) emigrating to South Korea - her parents have died and so she goes to her only relatives. Unfortunately, they have left and she is all alone; deciding to stay, she finds her options limited, and the only way she can stay for any length of time is through marriage to a South Korean citizen.Enter Kang-jae (Choi Min-suk), a small-time gangster in the port city of Incheon, always in need of cash, just out of jail. He lives in a dive apartment with his best friend; he's always got problems with the boss of his gang; he gets no respect from the younger thugs. Early on, he seems to be struggling for a way out - eventually, through Failan, he comes to realize what that might be.I can't say too much more without spoiling the whole plot - which, as I said, might be a little ambiguous, especially if you're not paying quite close attention. The film's narrative isn't completely linear, and it's the subtle way in which flashbacks/forwards are used that helps to give ""Failan"" it's ultimate power as melodrama and love story, as we wonder always what could have happened. Cheung is quite good as the put-upon Failan, though her character isn't all that well-developed and the film might be even more powerful if we knew her hopes and dreams and desires a bit better; then again, this ultimately becomes a moral journey for Kang-jae; it's really for the most part his story, and the very indistinctness of Failan is perhaps important to that journey. Choi is just astonishing here, every bit as good as he would be a couple of years later inOldboy.

The misguided love for this film is understandable because the performances of the two lead actors are amazing, utterly fantastic. You could pull any number of scenes completely out of context from this film and just look at them and they might make you cry, but the characters they portray as a whole are not worth an investment in tears.The story in a nutshell is this: Failan is Chinese. Her parents die and she travels to Korea to seek out her last remaining relative, an aunt, who unfortunately left Korea years ago for Canada. (I guess Failan's parents weren't very close to their siblings.) There must be a subtext for why Failan decides to stay in Korea because saying ""there's nothing to go back to"" hardly justifies accepting a paper marriage to stay in the country taking a job as a launderer to make money to pay off the mob who underwrites the marriage--after failing an audition to be a prostitute by coughing up blood at the interview. Kang-jae is the bottom-feeder gangster wannabe slob who marries her for a paycheck without wanting to see her or know anything about her. Time passes and gangster stuff happens. Kang-jae is about to take a ten-year jail time fall for his boss who promises to buy him a boat when he gets out but Failan dies all by her lonesome in some far off village and Kang-jae must detour his life in order to make funeral arrangements for the wife he forgot he had. This is where things get wonky.Failan writes a couple ""love"" letters to Kang-jae thanking him for being kind enough to marry her and presumes that he is therefore a swell guy worthy of her love and devotion, but he doesn't get them until she's dead. Why would she write love letters to this guy she doesn't know? A guy who marries foreign girls for a fee? She must have some idea of what that kind of arrangement is all about. It has nothing to do with her. At the very least she should be grateful Kang-jae leaves her alone and doesn't expect sexual favors in return for his kindness. She tries to see him once at the video store where he works but the meeting is interrupted by the police hauling him away (for selling porn to a minor). It's not even close to an endearing moment. The film maker paints a portrait of this young woman as pure virginal innocence and devotion, which appeals as some male ideal, but nothing more. There is no reason to like this girl for who she is or what she does. We can only admire her, as men, for what she represents. And Cecilia Cheung, as Failan, does some powerful representing. She is angelic.Min-sik Choi, most famous--to western audiences, at least--for his performance in Oldboy, plays Kang-jae. He is a superb actor with an incredibly impressive and expressive physical presence. He wears loose fitting pants. He's a man's man, confidence personified. But he's a teddy bear too, albeit one who's a very loose cannon perennially toying with the end of his fuse. He's got baby fat everywhere and wild baby hair. His face is a work of art, chiseled and scarred with been-there done-that experience, handsome in a Hell's Angels kind of way. He is an enigma who plays the paradox perfectly. He's able to make us believe he has entered some life altering introspective awareness stage upon reading Failan's letters to him when all he's really experiencing is massive regret for not gettin some the whole time. He doesn't even see a picture of her until she's, and I quote, a ""dead bitch"" lying on a table. And then he reads the faux flattering poems of loneliness from this Virgin Mary. I'd cry too if I were him. He blew it. He's an unlovable and unlikeable dunce not an everyman who deserves a better lot in life and tragically missed it.This film is a crock of crud, highly recommended for the performances. It's not a tragic love story, it's a fetish. Keep in mind the first half of the film is sloppy gangster comedy developing the character of Kang-jae. Failan doesn't show up until the second half, and she's already dead. Her story leading up to her death is told in parallel with Kang-jae's awakening sadness (or sad awakening), dealing with her death. It's very effective until the unnecessary, testosterone injected finish.",3,Great Performances in a phony melodrama,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,4401,"['Time', 'drop', 'tough', 'love', 'film', 'many', 'consider', 'one', 'pinnacles', 'contemporary', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'melodramatique', 'weeper', 'right', 'sympathy', 'not', 'empathy', 'mean', 'manipulative', 'misguided', 'love', 'film', 'understandable', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'amazing', 'utterly', 'fantastic', 'could', 'pull', 'number', 'scenes', 'completely', 'context', 'film', 'just', 'look', 'might', 'make', 'cry', 'characters', 'portray', 'whole', 'are', 'not', 'investment', 'tears.The', 'story', 'nutshell', 'Failan', 'Chinese', 'parents', 'die', 'Korea', 'seek', 'out', 'last', 'remaining', 'relative', 'aunt', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'left', 'Korea', 'years', 'ago', 'Canada', 'guess', 'Failan', 'parents', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'close', 'siblings', 'must', 'be', 'subtext', 'why', 'Failan', 'stay', 'Korea', 'saying', 'nothing', 'go', 'back', 'hardly', 'accepting', 'paper', 'marriage', 'stay', 'country', 'taking', 'job', 'launderer', 'make', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'mob', 'who', 'marriage', 'failing', 'audition', 'be', 'prostitute', 'coughing', 'up', 'blood', 'interview', 'Kang-jae', 'bottom-feeder', 'gangster', 'wannabe', 'slob', 'who', 'paycheck', 'wanting', 'see', 'know', 'anything', 'Time', 'passes', 'gangster', 'stuff', 'Kang-jae', 'take', 'ten-year', 'jail', 'time', 'fall', 'boss', 'who', 'buy', 'boat', 'when', 'out', 'Failan', 'lonesome', 'far', 'off', 'village', 'Kang-jae', 'must', 'detour', 'life', 'order', 'make', 'funeral', 'arrangements', 'wife', 'forgot', 'had', 'where', 'things', 'get', 'wonky.Failan', 'couple', 'love', 'letters', 'Kang-jae', 'thanking', 'being', 'kind', 'enough', 'marry', 'presumes', 'therefore', 'swell', 'guy', 'worthy', 'love', 'devotion', ""n't"", 'get', 'dead', 'Why', 'would', 'write', 'love', 'letters', 'guy', ""n't"", 'know', 'guy', 'who', 'foreign', 'girls', 'fee', 'must', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'kind', 'arrangement', 'nothing', 'do', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'Kang-jae', 'alone', ""n't"", 'expect', 'sexual', 'favors', 'return', 'kindness', 'see', 'once', 'video', 'store', 'where', 'meeting', 'interrupted', 'police', 'hauling', 'away', 'selling', 'porn', 'minor', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'endearing', 'moment', 'film', 'maker', 'portrait', 'young', 'woman', 'pure', 'virginal', 'innocence', 'devotion', 'appeals', 'male', 'ideal', 'nothing', 'more', 'reason', 'like', 'girl', 'who', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'admire', 'men', 'what', 'Cecilia', 'Cheung', 'Failan', 'powerful', 'representing', 'angelic.Min-sik', 'Choi', 'most', 'famous', 'western', 'audiences', 'least', 'performance', 'Oldboy', 'Kang-jae', 'superb', 'actor', 'incredibly', 'impressive', 'expressive', 'physical', 'presence', 'loose', 'fitting', 'pants', 'man', 'man', 'confidence', 'personified', 'teddy', 'bear', 'too', 'one', 'who', 'very', 'loose', 'cannon', 'perennially', 'toying', 'end', 'fuse', 'got', 'baby', 'fat', 'everywhere', 'wild', 'baby', 'hair', 'face', 'work', 'art', 'chiseled', 'scarred', 'been-there', 'done-that', 'experience', 'handsome', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'kind', 'way', 'enigma', 'who', 'paradox', 'perfectly', 'able', 'make', 'believe', 'entered', 'life', 'altering', 'introspective', 'awareness', 'stage', 'reading', 'Failan', 'letters', 'when', 'really', 'experiencing', 'massive', 'regret', 'not', 'gettin', 'whole', 'time', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'picture', 'quote', 'dead', 'bitch', 'lying', 'table', 'then', 'faux', 'flattering', 'poems', 'loneliness', 'Virgin', 'Mary', ""'d"", 'cry', 'too', 'were', 'blew', 'unlovable', 'unlikeable', 'dunce', 'not', 'everyman', 'who', 'better', 'lot', 'life', 'tragically', 'missed', 'it.This', 'film', 'crock', 'crud', 'highly', 'recommended', 'performances', 'not', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'fetish', 'Keep', 'mind', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'sloppy', 'gangster', 'comedy', 'developing', 'character', 'Kang-jae', 'Failan', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'already', 'dead', 'story', 'leading', 'up', 'death', 'told', 'parallel', 'Kang-jae', 'awakening', 'sadness', 'sad', 'awakening', 'dealing', 'death', 'very', 'effective', 'unnecessary', 'testosterone', 'injected', 'finish']",Failan

The people on here giving it negative reviews must not have really been paying attention to it. As to the comments about the characters being stereotyped, they're gangsters! Did you miss that point?

One would have to be heartless not to empathize with his unknown bride Failan.Not much that I can add to what other reviewers have said except that I recommend this movie without reservation.  If there is anything to complain about-the sub-titles are rather small--but this is a minor complaint--and far better than the sub-titles intruding!In life we all make choices-for Kang-jae it seems like he always made the wrong ones--until it was too late.  Cecilia Chung plays the part of Failan flawlessly,and Choi Min-shik also does a wonderful job as Kang-jae.Quite a few really good films are coming out of Korea recently--this is one of the best.
