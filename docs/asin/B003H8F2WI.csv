Omar's ambitious girlfriend pressures him into going to Uruguay to talk them into changing their minds.Gund's brother Adam (Anthony Hopkins) is in favor of the project, as much because it might raise interest in ""The Gondola"" and they'd make money. They need money. Gund's widow Caroline (Laura Linney) is dead set against it. The third executor is Arden Langdon (Charlotte Gainsbourg), Gund's mistress and the mother of his daughter Portia. She is against it at first, mostly because Caroline is, but eventually comes around.They all live together on the vast estate that the Gunds inherited from their parents. Adam's lover, Pete, is the manager of the estate and has been pestering Adam to let him make the land profitable. He has plenty of good ideas, but some cash will be needed to make any of it work.

I have not read the book.James Ivory does not disappoint. This is a movie which struck so many chords with me. Having visited Buenos Aires and other parts of Argentina a few years ago, I identified with the sense of elegance which the film telegraphed both in terms of the gorgeous scenery and the people that it depicted.  I recall walking in Recoleta and seeing middle aged very well kept women sporting their furs with a casualness which had long been abandoned in cities like New York years ago, in response to the vociferous anti-fur lobby. But then and there I thought Buenos Aires seemed stuck in a time warp slightly out of touch with a reality that the rest of the world had long since embraced.  So too in this movie. Here was a group of people tolerating each other and existing in a world not sustainable anywhere else or in any other context.  The author seeking his approval for execution of his precious biography of a deceased author, had a girl friend, Deirdre, who was almost literally disparaged for being too much of the real world and out of sync with the artifice of the gracious but dated Ocho Rios estate and its well-heeled inhabitants. But it was the navigation of that world with language and costuming that was so elegant and measured, that sets this film and its great cast led by Sir Anthony Hopkins, Laura Linney, Omar Metwally, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Hiroyuki Sanada, apart from the ordinary and the mundane.This film despite being an ode to an upper class existence that most of us will never experience, confers credibility on it and makes us ordinary folk very much interested in how this all turns out for these sorry bunch of misfits bent on validating each other's existence in this finely wrought but fragile world.",5,Beautifully rendered,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,1878,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'faithfulness', 'details', 'book', 'derived', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book.James', 'Ivory', 'not', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'struck', 'so', 'many', 'chords', 'Having', 'visited', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'other', 'parts', 'Argentina', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'identified', 'sense', 'elegance', 'film', 'telegraphed', 'terms', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'people', 'depicted', 'recall', 'walking', 'Recoleta', 'seeing', 'middle', 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'kept', 'women', 'sporting', 'furs', 'casualness', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'abandoned', 'cities', 'New', 'York', 'years', 'ago', 'response', 'vociferous', 'anti-fur', 'lobby', 'then', 'there', 'thought', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'seemed', 'stuck', 'time', 'warp', 'slightly', 'touch', 'reality', 'rest', 'world', 'had', 'long', 'embraced', 'So', 'too', 'movie', 'Here', 'was', 'group', 'people', 'tolerating', 'other', 'existing', 'world', 'not', 'sustainable', 'anywhere', 'else', 'other', 'context', 'author', 'seeking', 'approval', 'execution', 'precious', 'biography', 'deceased', 'author', 'had', 'girl', 'friend', 'Deirdre', 'who', 'was', 'almost', 'literally', 'disparaged', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'real', 'world', 'sync', 'artifice', 'gracious', 'dated', 'Ocho', 'Rios', 'estate', 'well-heeled', 'inhabitants', 'was', 'navigation', 'world', 'language', 'costuming', 'was', 'so', 'elegant', 'measured', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'led', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'apart', 'ordinary', 'mundane.This', 'film', 'being', 'ode', 'upper', 'class', 'existence', 'most', 'will', 'never', 'experience', 'confers', 'credibility', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'very', 'much', 'interested', 'how', 'out', 'sorry', 'bunch', 'misfits', 'bent', 'validating', 'other', 'existence', 'finely', 'wrought', 'fragile', 'world']",The City of Your Final Destination
1345697,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B003H8F2WI,C.Wallace,"[3, 9]","This film is based on a novel by Peter Cameron. I have not read this book, and it seems to me that reading it is a prerequisite to understanding much of the movie, particularly the jumbled conclusion. A young American college professor, Omar Razaghi (Omar Metwally) is under pressure to finish his thesis in order to keep his job. He wants to write a biography of an author, Jules Gund, who committed suicide because he could not finish another novel after his one great success. Gund lived on a huge family ranch, apparently first settled by his parents, in Uruguay, five thousand miles away from Omar's college. Although the ranch is most impressive, it's been a long time since that novel's success and money is tight.Omar wants to get the authorization of the late author's family before writing the biography. Three people control Jules's estate: his widow, his older brother(Anthony Hopkins), and his mistress. Omar's pushy girlfriend pushes Omar to go to Uruguay to get the coveted approval, even though he has received a letter from Uruguay indicating that the family is not willing to grant authorization. Incredibly, he just shows up at the remote ranch uninvited. He has never met anyone there.Most of the above surfaces in the first scenes of the film. The film quickly proceeds to flounder. I soon found myself not caring about Omar or his Gund project. This film has some of the blandest acting that I have ever seen. I could imagine director James Ivory telling the actors things like, ""Could you tone that down a bit? A little more subdued, please."" Laura Linney, however, does add some heat to the mix in her portrayal of the widow, particularly early on. Hopkins has had a long and distinguished career, but his is a tepid role in this film, and his performance is not inspiring.I suppose the scenery is pretty nice. There are some undeveloped but interesting references to the Gund family's German roots. There is an atmosphere of genteel decay. Some remarkably dull jewels. We learn a little about bee stings. There's a gondola imported all the way from Venice. Omar gets stuck in quicksand (or is it just mud?).

1345701,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003H8F2WI,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 4]","THE CITY OF YOUR FINAL DESTINATION (2008, released 2009 and 2010) is director James Merchant's latest offering ... and whatever this film may be considered, I for one am glad to see Merchant at the helm so long after Ismail Ivory's death. Even if it is based on a silly novel by Peter Cameron ....This rather tiresome story concerns Omar Razaghi, an assistant professor/doctoral student at a Kansas university (beautiful Boulder, Colorado is the unnecessary stand-in) who is obsessing about writing a biography of one Jules Gund. The fictitious Gund is a deceased writer of one single famous book, ""The Gondola"", something more or less like an autobiography. Omar needs authorization from Gund's executors or his biography of Gund, which is his doctorate or post-doctorate project (we aren't clear what it is) goes down the crapper.In a seemingly pointless and rather dreary storyline, Omar travels to Uruguay to meet the surviving Gund Family at the sprawling Gund estate: Gund's widow Caroline (played as the usual nasty dragon lady by the revolting Laura Linney), his brother Adam (a stunning but wasted Sir Anthony Hopkins), his paramour/hanger-on Arden (the oh-my-god-stop-dead beautiful genius Charlotte Gainsbourg) and Adam's beautiful boyfriend Pete (Hiro Sanada).Poor Omar is none the better off having a brow-beating Norwegian (or is she German) girlfriend, Deirdre (the spectacularly lovely Romanian-born Alexandra Maria Lara). She was the worst of the characters because she really had no purpose except to annoy me. She might have played Linney's daughter with that onscreen persona. Also ... why make her a strange, unidentified Teutonic person when she could have just played herself, a Romanian? Are Germanic people bigger bitches than Latins?The reason I say this film is 'pointless' is because the real objective here is to show us how certain people seem to belong together while others should avoid one another like the plague. I have only to examine my family to know that - but I suppose Merchant had to film this. Paltry and unwanted too: it opened in America on 18 April 2010, on one screen. It raked in a whole $24,401 after having been filmed on a budget of $8.3 million!Oh, we owe Merchant Ivory Productions a little more than that, people! Get this and see how you like it. As with most MI films, the acting is so-so, but everything is so beautiful and done with care (mostly). The story may drag a bit and this may seem as if it should have taken place in Victorian England, as I feel it should have done. However, the presences of the still-drop-dead-gorgeous Charlotte Gainsbourg - who sang one of the soundtrack songs - and Anthony Hopkins alleviate the feeling of worthlessness inherent in this story.All in all, with its many flaws, it is a fine experience that kept my attention throughout - and unlike most film of this caliber, it was not pretentious or preachy.

1345702,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003H8F2WI,Grady Harp,"[24, 24]","Peter Cameron's elegant, wistful novel THE CITY OF YOUR FINAL DESTINATION has been well transitioned to the screen by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and director James Ivory: in so many ways this film brings a host of fond memories of all of the films made by the members of Merchant Ivory films. It has the same sense of grace of transporting one culture into another, of examining interpersonal relationships as they are tied to etiquette and tradition and family, and the chances we take in the name of self-fulfillment and love.  It is a mood piece and a delectable offering for the brain.Omar Razaghi (Omar Metwally) is a postgraduate student and instructor at a Colorado College, living in a tenuous relationship with Deirdre (Alexandra Maria Lara), and delaying his desire to write his PhD thesis -a proposed biography of deceased novelist Jules Gund. He is unhappy with his life, frustrated that his thesis committee will not approve of his dissertation unless he has the family of Jules Gund's permission to write the biography. After a little nudge from a colleague he decides to travel to Uruguay - without Deirdre - to gain permission from the Gund family to proceed.  Deirdre, hurt because Omar wants to go without her, insists that Omar travel to Uruguay: this may his only chance to step out of the life whose rut he is in and move on to higher means.Omar journeys to Uruguay where he meets the Gund 'family' - Gund's gay brother, Adam (Anthony Hopkins) and his lover of 25 years  Pete (Hiroyuki Sanada); former wife Caroline (Laura Linney); and Arden (Charlotte Gainsbourg), Gund's mistress and mother of Gund's daughter, Portia.  Though greeted with hospitality it is clear that the family, as executors of Gund's estate, refuse to give Omar permission.  Omar is invited to live with the Gund's  until he can make arrangements to return to the US, but the visit is extended, allowing for changes to insert in the family unity as each one slowly agrees to allow Omar to write the biography.  Omar has a fall, is recovered by Arden (Deirdre flies to Uruguay for support but senses the change in Omar's feelings with Arden),  and  during his recovery Omar awakens to what he really wants in life - love, beauty, and the freedom to express himself in all matters.In the manner of fine story telling, there are excellent moments of passion, and comedy, and a fine dissection of family life in all its permutations.  The cast is uniformly excellent, composed of such a stellar group of actors.  This is a quiet adagio of a film, filled with charm, elegant cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, and fine music - both from the classics and from contemporary writing by Jorge Drexler.

He needs permission from his brother and his widow. So off to Uruguay, to meet the family. This group is quirky and living in a little isolated colony, a hermetic environment where they all stew in their own juices about their relationship to each other and the departed Jules. The group includes his brother, the brother's lover of 25 years, Pete, his widow (played admirably by Laura Linney) and Jules' young mistress and their daughter Portia. Omar must get approval from all three brother, widow, and mistress or the biography will not be authorized. Pushing him all the way is his ambitious girlfriend Dierdre. When Omar falls out of a tree and is stung by some bees and ends up in hospital, the mission takes a left-hand turn. Suddenly, it's not about Jules Gund, but about each person and their innermost desires.The script is from Peter Cameron's novel and is very good. The acting is of course, top notch with such a cast.

1345708,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003H8F2WI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 17]","There have been some truly great films created under the Merchant/Ivory banner.  More than 20 years later, I can still enthuse rapturously about sequences from ""A Room With A View,"" ""Howards End,"" and ""The Remains of the Day.""  Well ""The City of Your Final Destination"" is the first major release by director James Ivory since his long time producing partner Ismail Merchant died in 2005, so --in my book--its arrival was quite an event.  In adapting Peter Cameron's novel, screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (a frequent Merchant/Ivory collaborator who won Oscars for ""Room"" and ""Howards End"") has created a high-minded and stylish literary adaptation.  Ivory has assembled a terrific cast including Laura Linney, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Norma Aleandro, and Anthony Hopkins--so, all in all, sounds like a recipe for triumph!  Well, here's my rave....""I liked it.""  Stately and elegant, there was much that I admired about ""The City of Your Final Destination""--but ultimately, the film is a little bloodless, a little inert.When doctoral student Omar embarks on writing a biography of recently deceased author Jules Gund, he initially receives a refusal to participate from Gund's family.  Pushed by his aggressive girlfriend, he decides to challenge their denial and travels to Uruguay to visit the estate they all share.  The three people standing in his way are Gund's brother (Hopkins), his widow (Linney) and his mistress (Gainsbourg).  Omar is soon enchanted by Gainsbourg and befriended by Hopkins, and the book deal starts to seem secondary as he is accepted into this new lifestyle.  Linney, his last obstacle, holds steadfast for reasons of her own.  All the actors are nice--but while Omar is affable, he is also a bit vacant.  Gainsbourg and Hopkins are pleasant and Linney, as always, is lovely and strong.My disappointments with ""The City of Your Final Destination"" comes from its lack of real passion or emotion.  Having released only one book, Gund's legacy is treated as if he were Hemingway--and the film doesn't make a case for his literary significance.  He seems to have been a unconventional sort who lived with vigor what with an at-home mistress and an unexpected suicide, but we never see anything remotely hinting at his tempestuous nature.  Heck, his suicide is barely spoken of and is of little dramatic consequence--anyone looking for ANY motivation about Gund will be left hanging.  The characters, especially Linney, remark that a biography would be obtrusive because it would expose the family to judgement and potential criticism.  The general mantra is something akin to ""No one would understand us, we don't understand ourselves.""  But aside from the living arrangement being slightly unusual, there is nothing about this family that is particularly scandalous or intriguing.  In the film, everyone is so pleasant and polite, their dark secrets and revelations don't seem especially noteworthy.I liked "" ""The City of Your Final Destination.""  It's gorgeous to look at, for sure, and the actors do well.  But the dramatic elements fell short.  It just fails to bring anything of real emotional consequence to the forefront.  I never really knew or cared about Gund and the vitality of his clan was so muted as to be inconsequential.  It's sophisticated and lovely, but a little empty.  I doubt that I will be thinking about ""City"" much next month--much less in 20 years.

1345713,A387BD735MI50R,B003H8F2WI,R. Schultz,"[3, 4]","There's not much action in this film. It has the feel of a staged production, which isn't necessarily bad. It opens its paneled door and invites you in as a guest at the presumably Uruguayan estate of a deceased author who was a Salinger-like recluse known for the one major book he produced. His wife, his mistress, his brother, and the brother's partner, continue to live on together in their South American Garden of Eden retreat. (How such a large estate can be maintained with so little hired help remains one of the few mysteries of the plot.)There are some tensions between these people who sometimes seem to exist as out-take chapters from the great man's writings. There is an undercurrent of residual jealousy between the man's lawful wife and his mistress. Some additional disagreement is triggered by the intrusion on the estate of an aspiring young American writer intent on writing the biography of his author-hero. Then a bit more potential bitterness is added to the olio when the young writer's girlfriend arrives from the States to tend to him in the wake of an accident he's suffered - and to derail any budding romance he might be entertaining.These differences don't generally come to a boil though, or even a simmer. For the most part, the characters remain marinating in their own privileged lives of civilized comfort. Since this is a James Ivory production (the remaining member of the famed Ivory-Merchant team), you know the setting will necessarily be a civilized one.This movie tries to make a gondola that's housed in an out-building on the estate into a central character. The gondola was imported, at great risk and expense, from Europe by the author's parents. They rescued it as part of their attempt to rescue themselves from the Nazi onslaught in Europe. But the repeatedly invoked image of the gondola in this film sort of falls flat. The script was based on a novel by Peter Cameron, and I sense that the gondola might have been a more integral symbol in the book - a symbol of displacement - a symbol of withdrawal from ordinary use and usefulness - a symbol of risk and removal in order to maintain some sane sense of continuity. But all these possible meanings for the gondola get a bit lost in the necessarily brief 2-hour format of a film. Here the gondola itself comes off more as an intruder in the film - and worse yet, an irrelevancy.Nevertheless, as a whole, this is a worthwhile watch. The actress Charlotte Gainsbourg is memorable and appealing as the author's gamine mistress. Anthony Hopkins lends his usual note of classicism to his role.Maybe not much happens in the course of this film. But it will probably linger with you, putting you in a mood of calmer hopefulness that some people, somewhere, might yet prove to be civilized.",4,A Mellow Marinade of Characters,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,2785,"['not', 'much', 'action', 'film', 'feel', 'staged', 'production', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'paneled', 'door', 'guest', 'presumably', 'Uruguayan', 'estate', 'deceased', 'author', 'who', 'was', 'Salinger-like', 'recluse', 'known', 'one', 'major', 'book', 'produced', 'wife', 'mistress', 'brother', 'brother', 'partner', 'continue', 'live', 'together', 'South', 'American', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'retreat', 'How', 'large', 'estate', 'can', 'be', 'maintained', 'so', 'little', 'hired', 'help', 'one', 'few', 'mysteries', 'plot', 'are', 'tensions', 'people', 'who', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'exist', 'out-take', 'chapters', 'great', 'man', 'writings', 'undercurrent', 'residual', 'jealousy', 'man', 'lawful', 'wife', 'mistress', 'additional', 'disagreement', 'triggered', 'intrusion', 'estate', 'aspiring', 'young', 'American', 'writer', 'intent', 'writing', 'biography', 'author-hero', 'Then', 'bit', 'more', 'potential', 'bitterness', 'added', 'olio', 'when', 'young', 'writer', 'girlfriend', 'States', 'tend', 'wake', 'accident', 'suffered', 'derail', 'budding', 'romance', 'might', 'be', 'entertaining.These', 'differences', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'come', 'boil', 'even', 'simmer', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'remain', 'marinating', 'own', 'privileged', 'lives', 'civilized', 'comfort', 'James', 'Ivory', 'production', 'remaining', 'member', 'famed', 'Ivory-Merchant', 'team', 'know', 'setting', 'will', 'necessarily', 'be', 'civilized', 'one.This', 'movie', 'make', 'gondola', 'housed', 'out-building', 'estate', 'central', 'character', 'gondola', 'was', 'imported', 'great', 'risk', 'expense', 'Europe', 'author', 'parents', 'rescued', 'part', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'Nazi', 'onslaught', 'Europe', 'repeatedly', 'invoked', 'image', 'gondola', 'film', 'sort', 'falls', 'flat', 'script', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'Peter', 'Cameron', 'sense', 'gondola', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'integral', 'symbol', 'book', 'symbol', 'displacement', 'symbol', 'withdrawal', 'ordinary', 'use', 'usefulness', 'symbol', 'risk', 'removal', 'order', 'maintain', 'sane', 'sense', 'continuity', 'possible', 'meanings', 'gondola', 'get', 'bit', 'lost', 'necessarily', 'brief', '2-hour', 'format', 'film', 'Here', 'gondola', 'off', 'more', 'intruder', 'film', 'worse', 'yet', 'irrelevancy.Nevertheless', 'whole', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'actress', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'memorable', 'appealing', 'author', 'gamine', 'mistress', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'usual', 'note', 'classicism', 'role.Maybe', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'course', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'linger', 'putting', 'mood', 'calmer', 'hopefulness', 'people', 'somewhere', 'might', 'yet', 'prove', 'be', 'civilized']",The City of Your Final Destination

The biographer travels to Uruguay to try to persuade the family.This movie deserves five stars because its characters are well developed and because everything was original, in a pleasing way. Or if it was not absolutely original, it at least avoided triteness. For example Omar, who appears to be the main character, turns out to be the least attractive character. But you need to be a discerning judge of character to recognize his faults, or indeed to recognize that he has faults. If you are not careful, you may find yourself thinking he is a typical protagonist, one of the good guys.Other examples of the movie's avoidance of triteness: no violence, no guns, no spies, no car-chase sequences, no superheroes, no aliens, etc. Only one scene might be called an action sequence, and even it is humble in that respect. Nevertheless, from beginning to end the movie is interesting. The location of the story--Uruguay--is fresh. The cowboys (gauchos?) are different from American cowboys. Even the color of the alcoholic beverage is new, a cherry red.The cinematography and sound are excellent. The acting seems perfect, though in this regard I am not a perfectionist.Though I gave you a synopsis of the plot, the story is all about character. Who is right? Who is wrong? Who does the right thing? Who does the wrong thing? Who deserves whom, and who does not deserve whom? Go ahead and ignore the old dictum, ""Judge not, or you will be judged."" Tear these characters to pieces, and I do not mean the actors and actresses, I mean the characters. Or commend them. Judge them! If you can do that, the movie should earn your appreciation.",5,"An example of a movie being good, without being violent.",1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,1754,"['plot', 'family', 'deceased', 'author', 'give', 'biographer', 'authorization', 'write', 'author', 'biography', 'biographer', 'Uruguay', 'try', 'persuade', 'family.This', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'everything', 'was', 'original', 'pleasing', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'absolutely', 'original', 'least', 'avoided', 'triteness', 'example', 'Omar', 'who', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'out', 'be', 'least', 'attractive', 'character', 'need', 'be', 'discerning', 'judge', 'character', 'recognize', 'faults', 'indeed', 'recognize', 'faults', 'are', 'not', 'careful', 'may', 'find', 'thinking', 'typical', 'protagonist', 'one', 'good', 'guys.Other', 'examples', 'movie', 'avoidance', 'triteness', 'violence', 'guns', 'spies', 'car-chase', 'sequences', 'superheroes', 'aliens', 'etc', 'Only', 'one', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'action', 'sequence', 'even', 'humble', 'respect', 'Nevertheless', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'interesting', 'location', 'story', 'Uruguay', 'fresh', 'cowboys', 'gauchos', 'are', 'different', 'American', 'cowboys', 'Even', 'color', 'alcoholic', 'beverage', 'new', 'cherry', 'red.The', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'acting', 'perfect', 'though', 'regard', 'am', 'not', 'perfectionist.Though', 'gave', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'story', 'character', 'Who', 'right', 'Who', 'wrong', 'Who', 'right', 'thing', 'Who', 'wrong', 'thing', 'Who', 'whom', 'who', 'not', 'deserve', 'whom', 'Go', 'ahead', 'ignore', 'old', 'dictum', 'Judge', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'judged', 'characters', 'pieces', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'actors', 'actresses', 'mean', 'characters', 'commend', 'Judge', 'can', 'do', 'movie', 'should', 'earn', 'appreciation']",The City of Your Final Destination
