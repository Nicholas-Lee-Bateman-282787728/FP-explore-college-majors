1623445,AIMR915K4YCN,B00B9JKREK,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[1, 1]","Two events collide in HAYRIDE to create the backbone of the story. Event #1- A behemoth-sized,  mass-murdering maniac named Duncan is captured, escapes custody, kills his police escorts, and goes on a fresh killing spree. Event #2-  An annual Halloween hayride takes place nearby. On the night before the festivities, the hayride's creators have gathered around the fire, telling tales of ""Pitchfork"", a crazed, homicidal farmer out to punish everyone for his daughter's disappearance. Finally, the big night arrives. The real, gooshy fun begins when Duncan shows up, and starts dispatching unwary victims one by one.  But wait, how can we be sure that it's Duncan and not the legendary Pitchfork? HAYRIDE is an ultra-low-budget film that makes the best of its limited resources. Are there clunky spots? Yes. Is there a bit of cheeeze? Sure, but overall it's an effective Halloween retro-slasher. This movie even contains some character development!

First of all, I will say there is some dialogue in the movie that seemed kind of off to me as filler material which slows the movie down in certain parts. But with that said, the beginning to the movie is fantastic. We get some background during the opening credits and it's spaced out nicely. There are a lot of parts in the movie where they have different coloring used in scenes and different artistic angles, etc- it's awesome. It's very different for a horror movie and it looks really nice. The cinematography is excellent. The acting is even pretty good. I loved the old school horror feel to it. A lot of people haven't mentioned the sack the killer wears on his head- there are a couple of scenes with him wearing it that are just extremely creepy the way he looks at the camera. I got this through red box but this is one worth owning because it's so much fun. If you are huge fan of low budget  horror movies, you will love this even though it doesn't look real low budget. Excellent direction, photography, camera angles used, and pacing. Loved it. :)",4,Pleasantly Surprised!

1623451,ATCO49HZAY7C4,B00B9JKREK,orion725,"[0, 1]","This was a poorly done movie. Not just due to the low budget and bad acting, that can sometimes be overlooked, but the glaring editing errors made it unwatchable.  In one scene a character is brutally bludgeoned to death. When the sledge hammer is raise up, there is barely a speck of blood on it after cruyshing someones skull. I don't need bloody gore in  a movie and believ that less is more in horror, but this seemed strange.In other scenes things change from frame to frame. The worst was the long, boring dialogue. This is a problem with many scripts written by inexperienced writers. Rather than show you, they tell you. The result is a long monologue that seems unnatural and a lot of filler that does nothing to move the story forward.We don&#8217;t get to see the back story being played out fully, Instead we get to hear various people tell the story of pitchfork man while actors play out the scene in cut off frames. It&#8217;s difficult to describe how terrible it is to watch the killer in flashback with most of his body and most of his actions cut out of the frame (done with an annoying grainy texture and strange underlying crackling noise) while a voice over tells you what is happening.It&#8217;s just not worth watching.  When the final reveal comes and we see who the killer really is, it makes no sense.

However, two things on the disc kept it from being a complete waste of time.First, Richard Tyson delivers an occasionally arresting, professional performance. His narrative of the legend of Pitchfork did draw me close in around the campfire, listening to him. He has a more mature, macho ease that commands some respect on screen.The second point of interest on the disc can be found among its bonus extras. It includes three audition videos. There's the audition of the young woman ultimately cast in the lead female role. Then it includes two different actors auditioning for the lead male role. There's quite a difference between their deliveries. With one, there is no ""chemistry"" with the female lead at all. He ended up being cast in a supporting role. The actor who ultimately got the lead role continues to read in a rather scripted fashion, but is definitely more animated.More DVD's should include audition footage among their bonus features.",2,Has A Few Redeeming Features,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,1064,"['generally', 'amateurish', 'low-budget', 'film', 'nothing', 'new', 'contribute', 'psycho-slasher', 'genre', 'However', 'two', 'things', 'disc', 'kept', 'being', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.First', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'occasionally', 'arresting', 'professional', 'performance', 'narrative', 'legend', 'Pitchfork', 'did', 'draw', 'close', 'campfire', 'listening', 'more', 'mature', 'macho', 'ease', 'respect', 'screen.The', 'second', 'point', 'interest', 'disc', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'bonus', 'extras', 'three', 'audition', 'videos', 'audition', 'young', 'woman', 'ultimately', 'cast', 'lead', 'female', 'role', 'Then', 'two', 'different', 'actors', 'auditioning', 'lead', 'male', 'role', 'quite', 'difference', 'deliveries', 'one', 'chemistry', 'female', 'lead', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'cast', 'supporting', 'role', 'actor', 'who', 'ultimately', 'got', 'lead', 'role', 'read', 'rather', 'scripted', 'fashion', 'definitely', 'more', 'animated.More', 'DVD', 'should', 'include', 'audition', 'footage', 'bonus', 'features']",Hayride

Steven (Jeremy Ivy) brings his girlfriend Amanda (Sherri Eakin) home with him around Halloween. We get to hear and see some of the local flavor as the film builds their character, lines like, ""You're not from around here"" and ""roads that go no where."" And of course every proud small town in the south has ""the best BBQ in the state."" They plan to take Capt. Morgan's Haunted Hayride, a local tradition which features ""pitchfork man"" based on a local story. Here in Barnwell, we have ""rakeman."" He doesn't kill people, he just rakes leaves, sort of like Sling-blade, but creepier.Meanwhile a killer has escaped who might pass for Toj Johnson's son. In the opening scene the killer walks slow dragging an ax. He is able to catch up to a young panicking female at a flat out run...okay she stopped to rest for a second. A pair of odd couple cops are looking for him. Their lines were stale and predictable.This was a low budget production. In spite of that the filming aspects, special effects, etc were done well. They filmed in color, didn't use any hand held stuff and had multiple camera angels (i.e. multiple cameras), just like real movies. The acting was so-so, to fairly decent. The Hayride itself takes nearly an hour to happen.While the film wasn't bad, it barely held my interest. The dialouge was too boring with the opening restaurant scene lasting way too long.
