1110545,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000WMA74A,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 0]","Season 8 is a real watershed (or great divide, if you wish) between the early seasons and those which will follow. I will try to avoid spilling too many beans, but its hard to avoid the fact that two of the most important characters leave, and one seasons 1-3 character returns (Susan Lewis).Of course, the season is monopolized by the lives of Green and Benton. With Benton, it is largely with his battle over custody of &#34;his&#34; son. It is balanced on the kind of tipping point which puts the audience on the side against the law and accepted practice.The brightest trends are the endurance of Abby Lockhart (Moira Tierney) and the rehabilitation of John Carter (Noah Wyle), with a bit of a blemish on Kerry Weaver's tough exterior (Weaver's scenes are almost always some of my favorites throughout the series. At times, especially in the beginning, she is abrasive against Greene's easy going competence. Once they are no longer in competition, Weaver's hard-ass but fair attitude is a great antidote to Robert Romano's generally nasty persona.Late in the season, Mekhi Phifer comes on to start filling in the empty slots for the second half of the show's 15 seasons. Phifer's character, which would seem to be a replacement for Eriq La Salle's Peter Benton, is of a much different temperament, who seems sometimes oversure of himself, and sometimes too reckless.The season ends with what may have been the best season ender since the beginning, which is appropriate, since the season as a whole is pivotal for the characters in the show as a whole.",5,"Lots of different opinions about this season.

Other than that, the season was too often a reminder of just how good the show HAD been. Later characters in the series lacked the same chemistry of the first five years and although you rooted for them to get it right, they never seemed to get the same magical mix they had the first five years of the show.

1110549,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000WMA74A,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[1, 1]","This season set of ER gets five stars from me mainly because of the great story lines, strong character development and overall presentation of this season of ER. However, as has been the case with many of the show's releases, the extras were severly lacking, with a gag reel and deleted scense comprising all of the extras. A huge ER fan like myself could really use some more insight into the show.As the title of this review says, season eight was the swan song for Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards). Watching the episode where Carter reads the letters from Greene and Corday, written during the good doctor's final hours on the beach in Hawaii, a true ER fan couldn't help but get choked up. And then, one episode later, watching as Mark enjoys his final weeks with his family in Hawaii, it wasn't easy. But Anthony Edwards was leaving the show and t his is the way it was determined his exit would take place. It was certainly tough to see him go.In his final season, Greene dealt with more than his fair share of issues, but the biggest was the return of the tumor that had first appeared a season earlier. As viewers, we had watched Dr. Greene go through so much, an attack in the hospital bathroom, a divorce, the death of his parents, but with British surgeon Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston) he seemed to have found a new happiness. They had a daughter, Ella, and seemed happy, but then the tumor reappeared and everything changed. The couple dealt with some tough times in his final months, but in the end, they were happy and together and that's what fans would've wanted for Mark. He got the chance to get to know his older daughter, Rachel (guest star Hallee Hirsch) a little better and while they had their own problems, it was obvious they cared for each other.Dr. Greene's death was not the only departure from Cook County General Hospital in season eight. Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle), one of the original cast members, also departed after waging a custody battle for his son Reese. When Reese's mom, Peter's ex, was killed in a car crash, Peter and her new  husband, Roger (guest star Vondie Curtis Hall), waged a battle for custody of Reese. It wasn't until Peter quit the ER for the steadiness of a 9-5 job that he won custody of his son. Also leaving the ER was Dr. Cleo Finch (Michael Michele), Peter's girlfriend. This season she seemed relegated to simply the role of girlfriend and didn't have tons of story lines, so her departure was relatively minor.Also walking through the hospital doors for the final time was Dr. Dave Mallucci (Erik Palladino), who was fired by Dr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) after a series of transgressions that culminated in the death of a patient. Dr. Jing-Mei Chen (Ming-Na) was also fired by Weaver for the same incident, but eventually sued to get her job back and was successful. Though she began the year as the chief resident, she returned without the title.Returning to the show was Dr. Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield), after a five-year absence. Dr. Lewis left in the middle of season three to go to Arizona with her sister and her niece. She returned in the middle of the season and Dr. Greene, one of her closest friends, offered her a job, which she accepted. She entered a brief relationship with Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) and she was one of those hit the hardest by Mark Greene's death, due to their close friendship over the years. She also got to do a crossover episode with another NBC show, Third Watch, when she heads to New York to find her niece after recieving a troubling phone call.As for Carter, ER became his show after the exit of Greene. As the longest standing doctor in County General, Carter was going to be looked at for leadership. During the season, we got a look into his mega-rich family, as his mom (guest star Christina Hendricks), dad (guest star Michael Gross) and grandmother (Frances Sternhagen) all make appearances throughout the season. After his relationship with Dr. Lewis ends, Carter pursues a relationship with nurse Abby Lockhart (Maura Tierney), which culiminates in the season's final episode. And I got goosebumps when Carter took Dr. Greene's stethoscope out of his locker and hung it around his own neck. This was Carter's show from that point on.Besides Dr. Greene's death, one of the other big stories of season eight was Weaver's ""outing."" Viewers knew she was gay, but most of the hospital staff didn't. However, her relationship with firefighter Sandy Lopez (guest star Lisa Vidal) pushed her out of the closet and into the world for everyone to see. It was a rocky go in the early going, but things smoothed out as the season wore on.Dr. Luka Kovac (Goran Visnjic) and Abby continued their up and down relationship, though they do break up midway through the season. Luka gets his friend Nicole (guest star Julie Delpy) a job at the hospital and she endears herself to nobody by stealing from the other staff members. Abby also returns to drinking, a problem she had conquered earlier in her life, which in turn, gets Carter upset with her, though as mentioned, as the season comes to a close, they are  hurtling toward each other at full speed.Dr. Robert Romano (Paul McCrane) continues to be a thorn in the side of Dr. Weaver, Dr. Corday and Dr. Benton for much of the season. While his character is relatively viewed as a pain, it is obvious, as Greene is slowly dying, that he cares about his fellow doctors more than he lets on. And he shows no signs of the horrors that will befell him in future seasons.Sharif Atkins joins the cast near the end of season eight as med student Michael Gallant, who is also an Army Reservist. He is joined later in the season by guest star Mekhi Phifer as Dr. Greg Pratt. Phifer would go on to become a regular the following year.On a personal note, this DVD release allowed me to see one of only two episodes of ER that I have missed in its 14-year run. I missed Dr. Benton's final episode, where he eventually won his court case against Roger and quit his surgical job for private practice. It was nice to get some closure on Dr. Benton's ER stay and now I have just one episode I have missed, a few seasons down the road.As mentioned, a few more bonus features would've been nice. However, this was another solid season of television, featuring some of the best characters ever created. Dr. Mark Greene, Dr. John Carter and Abby Lockhart have, and will remain some of my favorite television characters ever.",5,"Farewell Dr. Greene, you will be missed",1207008000,"04 1,

However, coming from a family of both doctors and lawyers, I can't help but notice that the writers (either physician-writers or writers bowing to physician-technical advisors) place ALL lawyers in a bad light. There is a law student who stabbed Carter and killed Lucy. The clerk's comment: ""Lawyers are half as smart as doctors but twice as sneaky."" And up to the 8th season - two bunggling attorneys caught in the small pox lockdown. The latter were painted as stupid (for walking on coals of fire thereby burning their feet) while trying to recruit patients to file a class action against the hospital for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress as a result of False Imprisonment (insensitive). Any first year law student knows that an administrative sanction such as containing the spread of a contagious disease is an exception to the tortious act of false imprisonment. The doctors' hatred of lawyers should be placed into perspective. I have yet to see an episode of ""L.A. Law,"" ""Law & Order"" or ""The Practice"" bash doctors the same way as ER has been bashing lawyers. Not ALL lawyers are practising medical malpractice or personal injury law. A lot of them are actually practising medical malpractice DEFENSE,  constitutional rights and human rights law, public interest law and other fields of law practice that serve the public. Don't look at the profession but the person practising it.  Even to the disgust of the average medical practitioner, medical malpractice attorneys make sure that doctors perform according to medical standards - set by doctors. Suits are there to remind doctors that leaving a sponge in a patient's digestive system or cutting off the wrong leg are not a conspiracy to raise medical malpractice insurance premiums or just to piss them off but to actually help patients injured by some incompetent doctors...of course they don't exist in ER.",4,Need not resort to lawyer bashing,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,2010,"['was', 'able', 'watch', 'ER', 'marathon', 'season', '1-8', 'very', 'good', 'medical', 'drama', 'am', 'hooked', 'characters', 'are', 'engaging', 'However', 'coming', 'family', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'writers', 'physician-writers', 'writers', 'bowing', 'physician-technical', 'advisors', 'place', 'lawyers', 'bad', 'light', 'law', 'student', 'who', 'stabbed', 'Carter', 'killed', 'Lucy', 'clerk', 'comment', 'Lawyers', 'are', 'half', 'smart', 'doctors', 'twice', 'sneaky', 'up', '8th', 'season', 'two', 'bunggling', 'attorneys', 'caught', 'small', 'pox', 'lockdown', 'latter', 'were', 'painted', 'stupid', 'walking', 'coals', 'fire', 'thereby', 'burning', 'feet', 'trying', 'recruit', 'patients', 'file', 'class', 'action', 'hospital', 'Intentional', 'Infliction', 'Emotional', 'Distress', 'result', 'False', 'Imprisonment', 'insensitive', 'first', 'year', 'law', 'student', 'administrative', 'sanction', 'such', 'containing', 'spread', 'contagious', 'disease', 'exception', 'tortious', 'act', 'false', 'imprisonment', 'doctors', 'hatred', 'lawyers', 'should', 'be', 'placed', 'perspective', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'episode', 'L.A.', 'Law', 'Law', 'Order', 'Practice', 'bash', 'doctors', 'same', 'way', 'ER', 'been', 'bashing', 'lawyers', 'Not', 'lawyers', 'are', 'practising', 'medical', 'malpractice', 'personal', 'injury', 'law', 'lot', 'are', 'actually', 'practising', 'medical', 'malpractice', 'DEFENSE', 'constitutional', 'rights', 'human', 'rights', 'law', 'public', 'interest', 'law', 'other', 'fields', 'law', 'practice', 'serve', 'public', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'profession', 'person', 'practising', 'Even', 'disgust', 'average', 'medical', 'practitioner', 'medical', 'malpractice', 'attorneys', 'make', 'sure', 'doctors', 'perform', 'according', 'medical', 'standards', 'set', 'doctors', 'Suits', 'are', 'there', 'remind', 'doctors', 'leaving', 'sponge', 'patient', 'digestive', 'system', 'cutting', 'off', 'wrong', 'leg', 'are', 'not', 'conspiracy', 'raise', 'medical', 'malpractice', 'insurance', 'premiums', 'just', 'piss', 'off', 'actually', 'help', 'patients', 'injured', 'incompetent', 'doctors', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'ER']",ER: Season 8

1110555,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000WMA74A,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","This is, in my opinion the best season of ER.  That is due in large part to the storyline that lead to Anthony Edwards' departure from the show.  From its inaugural season in 1994 ER was the show everyone had to watch and talk about.  It was a ratings heavyweight for years.  It was the show that helped turn George Clooney into a superstar, and went on to become one of the longest running shows in TV.  Certainly in recent time.  By the 8th season many of the main cast had left.  This season would see the departures of Dr. Greene and Dr. Benton, but the return of Dr. Lewis.  After this season the only two characters from the original (main) cast would be Dr Carter and Dr. Lewis.Personally I think this season would have been the best spot to end the show.  To me the show just did not have the same feel after this season. Not to say that there were not good characters, story-lines or episodes in the remaining 7 seasons, but I think the perfect ending would have been for Dr. Green to pass the torch to Dr. Carter.  The series would have gone out on a high (albeit sad) note. The episodes ""The Letter"" and ""On The Beach"" were two of the best episodes in the entire series and would have been perfect series finales.  And, the show never could have been accused of staying on the air too long had it ended at that point. Personally I look at ER as two different series.  The one that lasted up to this season, and the one that remained on the air from seasons 9-15.  If you were a fan of the show at any point in its run, but especially of the early years, you will love this season.",5,The Pinnicle of ER,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,1591,"['opinion', 'best', 'season', 'ER', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'storyline', 'lead', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'departure', 'show', 'inaugural', 'season', '1994', 'ER', 'was', 'show', 'everyone', 'had', 'watch', 'talk', 'was', 'ratings', 'heavyweight', 'years', 'was', 'show', 'helped', 'turn', 'George', 'Clooney', 'superstar', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'longest', 'running', 'shows', 'TV', 'Certainly', 'recent', 'time', '8th', 'season', 'many', 'main', 'cast', 'had', 'left', 'season', 'would', 'see', 'departures', 'Dr.', 'Greene', 'Dr.', 'Benton', 'return', 'Dr.', 'Lewis', 'season', 'only', 'two', 'characters', 'original', 'main', 'cast', 'would', 'be', 'Dr', 'Carter', 'Dr.', 'Lewis.Personally', 'think', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'spot', 'end', 'show', 'show', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'feel', 'season', 'Not', 'say', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'characters', 'story-lines', 'episodes', 'remaining', '7', 'seasons', 'think', 'perfect', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Dr.', 'Green', 'pass', 'torch', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'high', 'sad', 'note', 'episodes', 'Letter', 'Beach', 'were', 'two', 'best', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'series', 'finales', 'show', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accused', 'staying', 'air', 'too', 'long', 'had', 'ended', 'point', 'Personally', 'look', 'ER', 'two', 'different', 'series', 'one', 'lasted', 'up', 'season', 'one', 'remained', 'air', 'seasons', '9-15', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'point', 'run', 'especially', 'early', 'years', 'will', 'love', 'season']",ER: Season 8

IMO, Season 8 wasn't one of the better of the 'middle' seasons.  I found most of the Dr. Greene/Elizabeth/Rachel stuff to be tiresome in the extreme, Kerry's 'outing' very badly handled,  the Nicole story pointless,  and Benton's paternity story-line utterly tedious.  On the other hand, the return of Dr. Lewis and the storylines with Carter's mom were very enjoyable. Still, I generally preferred Seasons 6,7 and 9.Be that as it may -- the DVDs. It seems that as the series goes on the DVDs become more and more bare-bones, while the price remains about  the same. The extras include the usual deleted scenes (some of which were not actually deleted ...), and a very short gag reel, (which took some hunting down -- it was on a different disc than the box claimed) about a quarter of which consists of scenes of Tony Edwards surfing in Hawaii.

1110565,A1TJJ7W8SF75D,B000WMA74A,Timothy T. Ward,"[19, 27]","After a dismissal seventh season, ER did bounce back some with Season 8. One of the best surprises early on was the return of Sherry Stringfield as Dr.Susan Lewis, whose character was strong and compelling for the first two and a half years of the series before she left. Unfortunately, the writers didn't do all that much with her when they brought her back. We also see the exit of Dr.Peter Benton, which the writers handled very well as they made the circumstances feel real for the character plus it allowed the thankful exit of Dr.Cleo, who seemed to be nothing more than Peter's girlfriend, but the writers did a terrible job with the exit of Anthony Edwards as Dr.Greene. He deserved a much better farewell than that beach episode, which was so flawed that much of it is barely memorable. What does stick in my memory is his spoiled brat, teenage daughter coming off like she must be miserable with the world for having had such a terrible life so far, which wasn't the case if you watch episodes from the previous seasons. The scene where she releases the ballons after his funeral also felt pseudo-like, but the fact that a different girl played his daughter with this season might be the reason. Personally, despite Dr.Greene having had a tumor in a previous storyline, the producers should have allowed him to be written out of the show rather than be killed off. The worst episode though was when Weaver mandates the staff to take a class on sexual misconducts/harassment in the workplace, which features Carter and Luka fencing(yes, give us viewers a break, please!)but what helped make ER a good enough season this time around was getting rid of Dr.Dave while getting to know and love Abby a lot more as she transformed from the once medical student to the new Carol Hathaway. Dr.Kerry Weaver and Dr.Chen also have workplace conflicts, and this storyline proved to be one of the show's best throughout the season as the writers created a realistic portrayl of what happens when mishandled patient care leads to devastating consequences.
