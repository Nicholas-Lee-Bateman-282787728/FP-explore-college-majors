Dismissed as a 'stupid & ignorant' Mexican deputy sheriff by most of the white community in a small town run by a tyrant. Valdez is brutally treated for asking justice for a widow who's husband, was wrongly accused of a murder and forced to kill by Valdez. $100. for her pain and subsistence was laughed at.  After being mistreated and mocked, he then has his revenge involving his great tracking and sniper skills formerly being one of the greatest 'Indian scouts' in his youth (that no one knew about).  He is an expert sniper, with his 'Sharps' Rifle and special load that even his enemies begin to fear and respect him....Great Western, one of the best next to Hombre with Paul Newman.",5,Revenge is so sweet in the 1800's.,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,769,"['like', 'most', 'Americans', 'always', 'love', ""'underdog"", 'what', 'Valdez', 'Dismissed', ""'stupid"", 'ignorant', 'Mexican', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'most', 'white', 'community', 'small', 'town', 'run', 'tyrant', 'Valdez', 'brutally', 'treated', 'asking', 'justice', 'widow', 'who', 'husband', 'was', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'murder', 'forced', 'kill', 'Valdez', '100', 'pain', 'subsistence', 'was', 'laughed', 'being', 'mistreated', 'mocked', 'then', 'revenge', 'involving', 'great', 'tracking', 'sniper', 'skills', 'formerly', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', ""'Indian"", 'scouts', 'youth', 'one', 'knew', 'expert', 'sniper', ""'Sharps"", 'Rifle', 'special', 'load', 'even', 'enemies', 'begin', 'fear', 'respect', '.Great', 'Western', 'one', 'best', 'next', 'Hombre', 'Paul', 'Newman']",Valdez Is Coming/The Ride Back/Buffalo Bill and the Indians
