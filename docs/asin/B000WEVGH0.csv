1108933,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B000WEVGH0,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 2]","I want to say upfront that I'm a sucker for found footage movies. While I usually come away from them dissatisfied (the nature of the found footage story pretty much guarantees the ending is going to be non-existent no matter how much awesomeness came before), I still can't help myself. There's something very intimate and honest about the format. Also, I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting ways to tell a story, and I think the found footage format is really open to those possibilities. With that in mind, I watched this movie, INVASION, that my aunt loaned me.INVASION (aka INFECTION) is a 2005 movie from director Albert Pyun, a man who, I've read, is considered on par with Ed Wood, but who, in my opinion is responsible for some unheralded classics (THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER, the disastrous 1990 version of CAPTAIN AMERICA, 1991's DOLLMAN). The premise of the movie (written by Cynthia Curnan) is that an alien invasion has taken over a small, isolated town in the middle of the night. We see the action taking place solely through a police car's dash-mounted camera. That was all my aunt had to say, I was sold.The story starts with Deputy Bardo riding out to where a meteor was reported to have fallen to the ground. Along the way he passes a man with a broken down truck, for whom he calls a tow truck. Then he passes a couple parked in the woods after that night's high school prom, whom he comments to himself he'll ""rouse"" on his way back. When he gets to the scene of the call, at first he has a hard time finding old man Jenkins, the local who called in the crash, but when he does find him, the man attacks the deputy and we see something black and snakelike wriggling into the deputy's ear. From there he goes back to the prom couple and attacks the boy, but the girl, Cheryl Cooper, gets away by hopping into the cop car and taking off.Cheryl contacts Deputy Ben who, along with Dr. Franks, tries to figure out what's happening to their town. Cheryl, however, is trapped in the park where Deputy Bardo had found them. One end of the road through the park is a dead end, while all the roads out have been blocked, first by the now-infected tow truck driver, then by Deputy Bardo and Old Man Jenkins.As Cheryl's desperation level gets higher and higher, things back in town are also getting worse. Deputy Ben and Dr. Franks split up to check out the town, but only one of them comes back and Cheryl starts getting conflicting stories about what she should do: stay in the car or hide in the woods. Considering the circumstances, neither idea sounds all that great.INVASION is a very small, simple movie. With the only camera being mounted on the dash of the police cruiser, a good deal of what we hear plays into the tension and suspense. Jenny Dare Paulin plays Cheryl and she does a decent job. A little over-dramatic in a few spots, but considering for 90% of her screen time she's just a voice, she pulls it off ok.INVASION is not without flaws, however. There are a couple of spots when Cheryl begins hallucinating that she sees multiple ghost-images of herself approaching from the woods. That would be fine, except we're seeing the action through a police cruiser's camera, and we see the hallucinations, too. Ghostly images of Cheryl in her prom dress, coming closer, then fading away to nothing. The camera shouldn't have seen that.Also, since most of the action is just Cheryl driving down one dirt road after another, trying to find a way out of the park, the action lags quite a bit in several places. INVASION is a good movie and it's well-done, but it also opens itself up several times for you to check the clock. And while the movie officially runs 81 minutes, the story itself only runs about 68. There's a very very lengthy credit sequence at the end. Which means that, in 68 minutes, this story couldn't keep me interested enough even for an HOUR without making me want to see how much was left. That's not good.Still, though, it was a good movie and I'd certainly watch it again. The plot is anything but original, but it's such a tried and true one that it still works, even though I've seen it a hundred times. And I don't care what people say about Albert Pyun, I like his movies, and INVASION is no exception. Hell, he even crafted a decent ending, which this type of movie has almost never been able to pull off before. INVASION was cheap, simple, and at times slightly blah, but overall I dug it.",4,Invasion,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,4453,"['want', 'say', 'upfront', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'found', 'footage', 'movies', 'usually', 'come', 'away', 'dissatisfied', 'nature', 'found', 'footage', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'ending', 'going', 'be', 'non-existent', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'awesomeness', 'came', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'something', 'very', 'intimate', 'honest', 'format', 'Also', ""'m"", 'always', 'lookout', 'new', 'interesting', 'ways', 'tell', 'story', 'think', 'found', 'footage', 'format', 'really', 'open', 'possibilities', 'mind', 'watched', 'movie', 'INVASION', 'aunt', 'loaned', 'me.INVASION', 'aka', 'INFECTION', '2005', 'movie', 'director', 'Albert', 'Pyun', 'man', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'considered', 'par', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'who', 'opinion', 'responsible', 'unheralded', 'classics', 'THE', 'SWORD', 'AND', 'THE', 'SORCERER', 'disastrous', '1990', 'version', 'CAPTAIN', 'AMERICA', '1991', 'DOLLMAN', 'premise', 'movie', 'written', 'Cynthia', 'Curnan', 'alien', 'invasion', 'taken', 'over', 'small', 'isolated', 'town', 'middle', 'night', 'see', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'solely', 'police', 'car', 'dash-mounted', 'camera', 'was', 'aunt', 'had', 'say', 'was', 'sold.The', 'story', 'Deputy', 'Bardo', 'riding', 'out', 'where', 'meteor', 'was', 'reported', 'have', 'fallen', 'ground', 'way', 'man', 'broken', 'down', 'truck', 'whom', 'tow', 'truck', 'Then', 'couple', 'parked', 'woods', 'night', 'high', 'school', 'prom', 'whom', 'comments', ""'ll"", 'rouse', 'way', 'back', 'When', 'scene', 'call', 'first', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'old', 'man', 'Jenkins', 'local', 'who', 'called', 'crash', 'when', 'find', 'man', 'deputy', 'see', 'something', 'black', 'snakelike', 'wriggling', 'deputy', 'ear', 'back', 'prom', 'couple', 'boy', 'girl', 'Cheryl', 'Cooper', 'away', 'hopping', 'cop', 'car', 'taking', 'off.Cheryl', 'contacts', 'Deputy', 'Ben', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Franks', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'town', 'Cheryl', 'however', 'trapped', 'park', 'where', 'Deputy', 'Bardo', 'had', 'found', 'One', 'end', 'road', 'park', 'dead', 'end', 'roads', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'blocked', 'first', 'now-infected', 'tow', 'truck', 'driver', 'then', 'Deputy', 'Bardo', 'Old', 'Man', 'Jenkins.As', 'Cheryl', 'desperation', 'level', 'higher', 'higher', 'things', 'back', 'town', 'are', 'also', 'getting', 'worse', 'Deputy', 'Ben', 'Dr.', 'Franks', 'split', 'up', 'check', 'out', 'town', 'only', 'one', 'back', 'Cheryl', 'getting', 'conflicting', 'stories', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'stay', 'car', 'hide', 'woods', 'Considering', 'circumstances', 'idea', 'great.INVASION', 'very', 'small', 'simple', 'movie', 'only', 'camera', 'being', 'mounted', 'dash', 'police', 'cruiser', 'good', 'deal', 'what', 'hear', 'plays', 'tension', 'suspense', 'Jenny', 'Dare', 'Paulin', 'Cheryl', 'decent', 'job', 'little', 'over-dramatic', 'few', 'spots', 'considering', '90', '%', 'screen', 'time', 'just', 'voice', 'off', 'ok.INVASION', 'not', 'flaws', 'however', 'are', 'couple', 'spots', 'when', 'Cheryl', 'hallucinating', 'multiple', 'ghost-images', 'approaching', 'woods', 'would', 'be', 'fine', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'action', 'police', 'cruiser', 'camera', 'see', 'hallucinations', 'too', 'Ghostly', 'images', 'Cheryl', 'prom', 'dress', 'coming', 'closer', 'then', 'fading', 'away', 'nothing', 'camera', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'that.Also', 'most', 'action', 'just', 'Cheryl', 'driving', 'down', 'one', 'dirt', 'road', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'park', 'action', 'quite', 'bit', 'several', 'places', 'INVASION', 'good', 'movie', 'well-done', 'also', 'up', 'several', 'times', 'check', 'clock', 'movie', 'officially', '81', 'minutes', 'story', 'only', '68', 'very', 'very', 'lengthy', 'credit', 'sequence', 'end', 'Which', '68', 'minutes', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'interested', 'enough', 'even', 'HOUR', 'making', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'not', 'good.Still', 'though', 'was', 'good', 'movie', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'watch', 'again', 'plot', 'anything', 'original', 'such', 'tried', 'true', 'one', 'still', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'people', 'say', 'Albert', 'Pyun', 'movies', 'INVASION', 'exception', 'Hell', 'even', 'crafted', 'decent', 'ending', 'type', 'movie', 'almost', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'INVASION', 'was', 'cheap', 'simple', 'times', 'slightly', 'blah', 'overall', 'dug']",Invasion aka Infection

1108940,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000WEVGH0,Carl Manes,"[7, 7]","INVASION is an experiment in SciFi and Horror that reintroduced the ""found-footage"" film years before CLOVERFIELD or REC. It is entirely unique in that it tells its story in a single, continuous shot that is taken from the dashboard camera of a police cruiser. Deputy Brick is dispatched to investigate a meteor landing. Upon arrival, it is learned that the meteor is host to a parasitic alien, which begins infecting anyone it comes in contact with deep within the remote state park. What is most interesting about this shooting style is that it forces the viewer into a first-person account of the events, while offering a variety perspectives as different characters enter the vehicle and assume the role of the narrator. INVASION'S greatest strength also becomes its greatest weakness, in that the static camera is strictly focused on the road the entire duration of the film while the characters exchange dialog over the radio. Conceptually, this is a brilliant move in securing the film's integrity, but the average viewer is not likely to be entertained by watching an hour of actionless driving on an empty road. It does manage to successfully create a large-scale invasion on a non-existent budget, however, and is an interesting watch for SciFi fans.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Invasion,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",2010,1291,"['INVASION', 'experiment', 'SciFi', 'Horror', 'reintroduced', 'found-footage', 'film', 'years', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'REC', 'entirely', 'unique', 'story', 'single', 'continuous', 'shot', 'taken', 'dashboard', 'camera', 'police', 'cruiser', 'Deputy', 'Brick', 'dispatched', 'investigate', 'meteor', 'landing', 'arrival', 'learned', 'meteor', 'host', 'parasitic', 'alien', 'infecting', 'anyone', 'contact', 'deep', 'remote', 'state', 'park', 'What', 'most', 'interesting', 'shooting', 'style', 'viewer', 'first-person', 'account', 'events', 'offering', 'variety', 'different', 'characters', 'enter', 'vehicle', 'assume', 'role', 'narrator', 'INVASION', 'greatest', 'strength', 'also', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'static', 'camera', 'strictly', 'focused', 'road', 'entire', 'duration', 'film', 'characters', 'exchange', 'dialog', 'radio', 'Conceptually', 'brilliant', 'move', 'securing', 'film', 'integrity', 'average', 'viewer', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'entertained', 'watching', 'hour', 'actionless', 'driving', 'empty', 'road', 'manage', 'successfully', 'create', 'large-scale', 'invasion', 'non-existent', 'budget', 'however', 'interesting', 'watch', 'SciFi', 'fans.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Invasion aka Infection

1108951,A2CGM4GQON1DYE,B000WEVGH0,Will,"[1, 2]","As previously mentioned the credits take up a third of the film. Why you would want to be credited on this is beyond me. It starts with a neat idea, a ""bug"" brought down on meteorites infecting a small town. What you get instead is a cop car dash-cam being driven back and forth on the same one mile stretch of dirt road a seemingly infinite number of times. After being driven for a short period of time by an uninteresting police officer, the car is taken over by a hysterical teen girl. Literally the entire movie is driving back and forth on the same short dirt road at night. A GoPro and a flashlight could have created a better film.People have pointed out that you need to use your imagination to really get into the film. While I agree that a well planned plot twist that leaves the viewer with a bit of ambiguity can make a film. What the film should not do, is make the viewer imagine it in its entirety. At this point all you have is a premise not a full fledged movie. I love bad horror movies and enjoy a lot of low budget works. Unfortunately, this was not one of them.",1,"Great concept, horrible execution.",1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,1083,"['previously', 'mentioned', 'credits', 'take', 'up', 'third', 'film', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'credited', 'neat', 'idea', 'bug', 'brought', 'down', 'meteorites', 'infecting', 'small', 'town', 'What', 'get', 'instead', 'cop', 'car', 'dash-cam', 'being', 'driven', 'back', 'forth', 'same', 'one', 'mile', 'stretch', 'dirt', 'road', 'seemingly', 'infinite', 'number', 'times', 'being', 'driven', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'uninteresting', 'police', 'officer', 'car', 'taken', 'over', 'hysterical', 'teen', 'girl', 'Literally', 'entire', 'movie', 'driving', 'back', 'forth', 'same', 'short', 'dirt', 'road', 'night', 'GoPro', 'flashlight', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'better', 'film.People', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'need', 'use', 'imagination', 'really', 'get', 'film', 'agree', 'well', 'planned', 'plot', 'twist', 'viewer', 'bit', 'ambiguity', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'What', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'do', 'make', 'viewer', 'imagine', 'entirety', 'point', 'have', 'premise', 'not', 'full', 'fledged', 'movie', 'love', 'bad', 'horror', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'low', 'budget', 'works', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'one']",Invasion aka Infection
