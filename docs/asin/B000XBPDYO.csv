It begins with workers making steel from ore. It moves to the swordmaker's art of forging a magnificently crafted weapon perfectly suited for the style of combat the culture revered. It shows that polishing and sharpening are a separate art also practiced by great craftsmen.There is a great deal of science in the video that explains the properties of steel, how it is hardened, and how the weapon requires different steels to accomplish its task.It isn't perfect, but this video is very good!",4,See it made.,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,722,"['excellent', 'video', 'showing', 'technology', 'developed', 'centuries', 'great', 'craftsmen', 'produce', 'not', 'simply', 'weapon', 'work', 'art.The', 'video', 'art', '*and*', 'science', 'producing', 'katana', 'samurai', 'sword', 'workers', 'making', 'steel', 'ore', 'swordmaker', 'art', 'forging', 'magnificently', 'crafted', 'weapon', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'style', 'combat', 'culture', 'revered', 'polishing', 'sharpening', 'are', 'separate', 'art', 'also', 'practiced', 'great', 'craftsmen.There', 'great', 'deal', 'science', 'video', 'properties', 'steel', 'how', 'hardened', 'how', 'weapon', 'different', 'steels', 'accomplish', 'task.It', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'video', 'very', 'good']",NOVA: Secrets of the Samurai Sword

1113913,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000XBPDYO,Jeffery Mingo,"[5, 29]","Remember in ""Kill Bill 1"" how it was so special that Beatrix had a Hattori Hamza sword?  Well, this documentary covers all the effort put into making samurai swords.  (Then again, when that Hobbit named his weapon Sting, the West can praise swords too.)  This documentary showed how it took 15 people six months to make one sword.  There is a documentary on samurais themselves in existence.  Perhaps interested viewers should watch the two programs consecutively.The science of making the sword is privileged over the samurai themselves.  Chemistry or engineering majors may like this work much more than East Asian Studies majors.  One interviewee said, ""Atoms don't minding doing blah, blah, blah.""  He actually gave atoms anthropomorphic traits.Of course, the samurai lived decades before Freud and thousands of miles away from Vienna.  Still, I can't help but think of the phallic nature of swords.  At one point, the narrator says, ""One person called samurai films 'sword porn.'""  Still, I cracked up when the narrator said, ""No samurai wants to be caught with a broken sword.""  He never laughs at his own double entendre.This program showed Westerners and Japanese, English speakers and Japanese ones.  Still, all the academics were white and all the blacksmiths were Japanese.  I don't know why they didn't include any Japanese scholars in this.  The documentary begins with showing a modern, female samurai, but I've never seen female samurai in old films or woodblock prints.  I wish the documentary had spoken about when women began learning these skills usually associated with men.",3,Swords over Samurai,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,1594,"['Remember', 'Kill', 'Bill', '1', 'how', 'was', 'so', 'special', 'Beatrix', 'had', 'Hattori', 'Hamza', 'sword', 'Well', 'documentary', 'covers', 'effort', 'put', 'making', 'samurai', 'swords', 'Then', 'again', 'when', 'Hobbit', 'named', 'weapon', 'Sting', 'West', 'can', 'praise', 'swords', 'too', 'documentary', 'showed', 'how', 'took', '15', 'people', 'six', 'months', 'make', 'one', 'sword', 'documentary', 'samurais', 'existence', 'Perhaps', 'interested', 'viewers', 'should', 'watch', 'two', 'programs', 'consecutively.The', 'science', 'making', 'sword', 'privileged', 'samurai', 'Chemistry', 'engineering', 'majors', 'may', 'like', 'work', 'much', 'more', 'East', 'Asian', 'Studies', 'majors', 'One', 'interviewee', 'said', 'Atoms', 'do', ""n't"", 'minding', 'doing', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'actually', 'gave', 'atoms', 'anthropomorphic', 'traits.Of', 'course', 'samurai', 'lived', 'decades', 'Freud', 'thousands', 'miles', 'away', 'Vienna', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'phallic', 'nature', 'swords', 'one', 'point', 'narrator', 'One', 'person', 'called', 'samurai', 'films', 'porn', 'Still', 'cracked', 'up', 'when', 'narrator', 'said', 'samurai', 'be', 'caught', 'broken', 'sword', 'never', 'own', 'double', 'entendre.This', 'program', 'showed', 'Westerners', 'Japanese', 'English', 'speakers', 'Japanese', 'ones', 'Still', 'academics', 'were', 'white', 'blacksmiths', 'were', 'Japanese', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'Japanese', 'scholars', 'documentary', 'begins', 'showing', 'modern', 'female', 'samurai', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'female', 'samurai', 'old', 'films', 'woodblock', 'prints', 'wish', 'documentary', 'had', 'spoken', 'about', 'when', 'women', 'began', 'learning', 'skills', 'usually', 'associated', 'men']",NOVA: Secrets of the Samurai Sword

Being an episode of Nova, this documentary focuses heavily on the science.  It still feels a little like the whole documentary got shortchanged.  There are hints here at what could have been included, including the spiritual nature of the sword.  Yes, the blades are the most important aspects of these swords and yet it seems that we should have also been shown at least a little about how a sword's furniture is created.
