1430769,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004WO9OOS,DVD Verdict,"[5, 5]","Judge Victor Valdivia, DVD Verdict -- ""Attacked as racially and culturally insensitive in its first season, The PJs doesn't shy away from edgy humor and controversial topics in its second. What's more, the show does more to flesh out its characters and relationships in this season than in the previous one. If this season ends up being a little more uneven than the first, it still contains some of the series' funniest jokes and best episodes, making it a worthy companion to the first season. The show still explores life in the projects with unabashed honesty and cutting wit, it still makes hilariously crude and edgy humor, and it makes no apologies for any of it. There are two reasons why this season isn't quite as stellar as the first. For one thing, some of the all-star writers (such as Simpsons vets Al Jean and Mike Reiss) who were involved with the first season are absent. Second, there are some episodes this season where Murphy, for whatever reason, did not do the voice of Thurgood. And this isn't quite the place to start watching, as the first season is more consistent and inventive. Still, The PJs remains a sadly underrated series and Lionsgate deserves credit for finally letting fans get to see it again after many years, even without extras.""",4,The PJs refuses to knuckle under to its critics,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,1269,"['Judge', 'Victor', 'Valdivia', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Attacked', 'racially', 'culturally', 'insensitive', 'first', 'season', 'PJs', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'edgy', 'humor', 'controversial', 'topics', 'second', 'What', 'more', 'show', 'more', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'relationships', 'season', 'previous', 'one', 'season', 'up', 'being', 'little', 'more', 'uneven', 'first', 'still', 'series', 'funniest', 'jokes', 'best', 'episodes', 'making', 'worthy', 'companion', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'still', 'life', 'projects', 'unabashed', 'honesty', 'cutting', 'wit', 'still', 'hilariously', 'crude', 'edgy', 'humor', 'apologies', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'season', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'stellar', 'first', 'one', 'thing', 'all-star', 'writers', 'such', 'Simpsons', 'vets', 'Al', 'Jean', 'Mike', 'Reiss', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'absent', 'Second', 'are', 'episodes', 'season', 'where', 'Murphy', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'voice', 'Thurgood', ""n't"", 'quite', 'place', 'start', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'more', 'consistent', 'inventive', 'Still', 'PJs', 'sadly', 'underrated', 'series', 'Lionsgate', 'deserves', 'credit', 'finally', 'letting', 'fans', 'get', 'see', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'even', 'extras']",The PJ's: Season 2
