1645908,A2IYTNAMLR5TJR,B00CCYNYBO,Don McGregor,"[1, 1]","The Mavericks have a few things in common with James Bond: both take card games seriously and both enjoy the company of women. The Mavericks, as a rule, don't like to fight, and certainly would not accept any damn license to kill.Most times, the personalities of the Mavericks are laid back, and that suits Roger Moore fine. He's certainly believable as a Maverick, except for the fact that no one has made mention of him in the previous three years, which takes getting used to, and is now os the prime center of attention whenever Bart refers to a relative. It's as if he forgot he had a brother named Bret.It should be noted before I charge into the individual episodes of the fourth season, that with Moore or without, Maverick always had a formidable goal to try to achieve.The challenge that Maverick had to meet week after week is: How to be Maverick?Even with James Garner, it was not easy living up to the unique tone and spirit of Maverick.There's much more in my full review of the 4th year of Maverickin the new Riding Shotgun column on Comicsbulletin.com,including many photos, including sequential sequences.Even some photos of Edd Byrnes and77 Cherokee Strip.For Maverick fans, fans thinking of buying this set, and for thoseinterested in reading some tidbits about what was happening behindthe scenes.Hang in there!Don McGregor",5,"[.Before He Was James Bond and Lord Sinclair, He Was a Maverick..]",1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,1343,"['Mavericks', 'have', 'few', 'things', 'common', 'James', 'Bond', 'take', 'card', 'games', 'seriously', 'enjoy', 'company', 'women', 'Mavericks', 'rule', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fight', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'accept', 'damn', 'license', 'kill.Most', 'times', 'personalities', 'Mavericks', 'are', 'laid', 'back', 'suits', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'fine', 'certainly', 'believable', 'Maverick', 'fact', 'one', 'made', 'mention', 'previous', 'three', 'years', 'getting', 'used', 'now', 'os', 'prime', 'center', 'attention', 'whenever', 'Bart', 'relative', 'forgot', 'had', 'brother', 'named', 'Bret.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'charge', 'individual', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'season', 'Moore', 'Maverick', 'always', 'had', 'formidable', 'goal', 'try', 'achieve.The', 'challenge', 'Maverick', 'had', 'meet', 'week', 'week', 'How', 'be', 'Maverick', 'Even', 'James', 'Garner', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'living', 'up', 'unique', 'tone', 'spirit', 'Maverick.There', 'much', 'more', 'full', 'review', '4th', 'year', 'Maverickin', 'new', 'Riding', 'Shotgun', 'column', 'Comicsbulletin.com', 'including', 'many', 'photos', 'including', 'sequential', 'sequences.Even', 'photos', 'Edd', 'Byrnes', 'Cherokee', 'Strip.For', 'Maverick', 'fans', 'fans', 'thinking', 'buying', 'set', 'thoseinterested', 'reading', 'tidbits', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'behindthe', 'scenes.Hang', 'there', 'Don', 'McGregor']",Maverick The Complete Fourth Season Back to Back 2 Pack

1645910,A15C8E35JMSIEY,B00CCYNYBO,GA Russell,"[6, 8]","I won't repeat what I said for the Maverick Season 3 box regarding the pricing.  The price gouging policy of Time Warner is true here as well.The series Maverick was created by writer Roy Huggins for James Garner.  When Warner Bros. found that they could not produce at the rate of an episode a week, Jack Kelly was brought on board to ease everyone's burden.Garner's leaving the show after Season 3 gave the general public the impression that the show would not be very good anymore.  However, in my view the shows of Season 4 are entirely satisfactory, and well worth seeing.Moore left after Season 4.  The scripts of Season 5 were quite mediocre, and the show was deservedly cancelled at its conclusion.",5,Excellent season,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,706,"['wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'said', 'Maverick', 'Season', '3', 'box', 'regarding', 'pricing', 'price', 'gouging', 'policy', 'Time', 'Warner', 'true', 'here', 'well.The', 'series', 'Maverick', 'was', 'created', 'writer', 'Roy', 'Huggins', 'James', 'Garner', 'When', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'found', 'could', 'not', 'produce', 'rate', 'episode', 'week', 'Jack', 'Kelly', 'was', 'brought', 'board', 'ease', 'everyone', 'burden.Garner', 'leaving', 'show', 'Season', '3', 'gave', 'general', 'public', 'impression', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'anymore', 'However', 'view', 'shows', 'Season', '4', 'are', 'entirely', 'satisfactory', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing.Moore', 'left', 'Season', '4', 'scripts', 'Season', '5', 'were', 'quite', 'mediocre', 'show', 'was', 'deservedly', 'cancelled', 'conclusion']",Maverick The Complete Fourth Season Back to Back 2 Pack

1645913,A3POOPMP1XPZCU,B00CCYNYBO,Henri Bronsgeest,"[0, 0]","The year without James Garner.  Not bad on reflection.  Roger Moore takes over as cousin Beau, but even he quit half way through the season.  The problem is not Maverick but Warner Bros.  They had many TV series during this time period but felt it was beneath them to have TV shows instead of movies!  Typical attitude by the major studios during those day even though they were big hits.  So, to save money they would reuse scripts from the various shows and just change the names and locale and move the contract actors from series to series.  No wonder many of them walked out.  They even tried another brother who looked and dressed like Bret.  It did not work.The good news is that the shows, alternating with Bart, are not bad at all.",4,Beau and Bart and some others,1405728000,"07 19, 2014",2014,740,"['year', 'James', 'Garner', 'Not', 'bad', 'reflection', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'over', 'cousin', 'Beau', 'even', 'quit', 'half', 'way', 'season', 'problem', 'not', 'Maverick', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'had', 'many', 'TV', 'series', 'time', 'period', 'felt', 'was', 'beneath', 'have', 'TV', 'shows', 'instead', 'movies', 'Typical', 'attitude', 'major', 'studios', 'day', 'even', 'were', 'big', 'hits', 'So', 'save', 'money', 'would', 'reuse', 'scripts', 'various', 'shows', 'just', 'change', 'names', 'locale', 'move', 'contract', 'actors', 'series', 'series', 'No', 'wonder', 'many', 'walked', 'out', 'even', 'tried', 'brother', 'who', 'looked', 'dressed', 'Bret', 'did', 'not', 'work.The', 'good', 'news', 'shows', 'alternating', 'Bart', 'are', 'not', 'bad']",Maverick The Complete Fourth Season Back to Back 2 Pack
