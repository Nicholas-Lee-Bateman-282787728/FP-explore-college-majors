1144340,A2WJCE8VF3STFW,B0013XZ6G6,Judith,"[1, 2]","Beverly Cleary's book The Mouse and the Motorcycle is a modern classsic.  This film does justice to the book, but it does look a bit dated.  Children still frequently take this book out of the library where I work.  I think they will enjoy this live action version of the book.The bonus feature is Wee Gillis.  This live action movie of the book of the same name really feels old.  The picture is fuzzy, and the style of the narrator feels very stodgy and dull.  We no longer keep a copy of this book on the library shelves because patrons didn't check it out anymore.  I doubt many children will want to watch this bonus.I was torn between giving this DVD 3 or 4 stars.  It's good enough, but it might be better if somebody filmed a more up-to-date version of The Mouse and the Motorcycle.",4,Classic Kid's book,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,790,"['Beverly', 'Cleary', 'book', 'Mouse', 'Motorcycle', 'modern', 'classsic', 'film', 'justice', 'book', 'look', 'bit', 'dated', 'Children', 'still', 'frequently', 'take', 'book', 'library', 'where', 'work', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'book.The', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Wee', 'Gillis', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'really', 'feels', 'old', 'picture', 'fuzzy', 'style', 'narrator', 'very', 'stodgy', 'dull', 'no', 'longer', 'keep', 'copy', 'book', 'library', 'shelves', 'patrons', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'out', 'anymore', 'doubt', 'many', 'children', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'bonus.I', 'was', 'torn', 'giving', 'DVD', '3', '4', 'stars', 'good', 'enough', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'somebody', 'filmed', 'more', 'up-to-date', 'version', 'Mouse', 'Motorcycle']",The Mouse and the Motorcycle plus Bonus Story
