I don't like to see the actors in wide-body. This only cost me $15, so I'll keep it just for the curiosity value. The transfer is fair, but it was probably done from a mediocre taping. It would be interesting to know what software was used to produce the DVD.Scary? Hardly. If this makes your hair stand, you have a very low tolerance for fear. Mystery, yes. That is, for someone who doesn't know the story. It would have worked pretty well in 1958.Andre Morell was a fine actor, but I didn't care for his work in this. Particularly in the early cabinet meeting. When the decisions go against him, he sits there looking like a petulant child. Maybe it's the recording, but his speech is often unintelligible.Col. Breen's demise is puzzling. How did it happen? At least, in '5 Million Years to Earth', we see him destroyed, more fun that way.I have '5 Million Years to Earth', and I prefer it.

1112808,A118A49ORGNEUM,B000X0TVUC,D. Barber,"[5, 5]","I'm a sci-fi buff. I have loved all of the classics. The Day The Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet, and yes, I'm even one of those zealots who owns  Things To Come. Five Million Years To Earth is one of my long time favorites. I had read, on occasion, that the movie was based on a British television broadcast from the 50's. When I saw it available at Amazon I promptly ordered it. For my fellow sci-fi enthusiasts, I'll try to give a clear picture of the film.It's made in six installments which ran on consecutive Mondays, beginning on December 22, 1958 and ending on January 26th, 1959. Each episode lasted about 35 minutes. The overall character of the episodes reminds me somewhat of the early Twilight Zones or even the gothic Dark Shadows. Low budget yes, but still rather well done. The series follows the plot and even the dialog of the movie very closely. I recognized whole lines from the movie. Actually, since the serial came first, one should say the film followed the serials dialog.The picture quality is quite good for 1950's television. Remember when Twilight Zone experimented with videotape for one season? The quality here is a good deal better than that. The focus is slightly soft (HD is spoiling us all), but overall I would call the picture quite decent. The acting is somewhat amateurish, a little like a daytime soap. As for the ship, it's entirely different from the movie and not nearly so imaginative. The shape of this ship reminded me of something and it took me a while to put my finger on it. The Martian ship looks like a musicians flute. Picture the mouthpiece as the ships entrance and the cells for the Martians, as the flutes fingerholes. While not as imaginative as the movie's ship, it did look more functional.The six episodes and timings are:  The Halfmen (00:00), The Ghosts (00:35), Imps and Demons (01:10), The Enchanted (01:43), The Wild Hunt (02:16), Hob (02:51). The DVD ends at 03:27.I would call the program interesting and a different spin on the original. Like Playhouse 90 and the era of (sometimes live) television, there is a kind of dynamic here that is not found in slickly produced modern television. A raw vitality, you might call it. If you liked the movie you will likely enjoy this precursor. By the way, have you looked at the price Amazon wants for the movie DVD?

I have not seen the movie version yet, but this TV version is really good. Even though it is slow moving at times, I still found it quite creepy - the haunting musical score and the black & white picture help create the eerie astmosphere of the piece. And for it's time it, even now days, it has some really big science-fiction concepts in it. I think Nigel Kneale is the best sci-fi writer of all time, surpassing Arthur C. Clarke, H.G. Wells, and Jules Verne. And when you see ""Quatermass and the Pit"" you might understand why. The acting and directing is top-notch, plus not to mention the excellent lighting, and the great design on the spacship and creatures.The Plot:London construction workers uncover fossilized human remains five million years old and beneath that an alien spacecraft. Professor Quatermass (played to perfection by Andre Morell) is called in to investigate. His investigations reveal a bizarre and horrifying connection between the ship's alien crew and the evolution of man on Earth.I'm not going to say more than that because it might spoil the story.

1112815,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B000X0TVUC,Matthew Kresal,"[24, 25]","There is a saying I am rather fond of about going out at your best. Over six weeks in late 1958 and early 1959 the BBC brought its involvement in the Quatermass stories to a close. In doing so they lived up to that saying by producing what remains one of the most imaginative and brilliantly crafted pieces of science fiction to ever be put on a screen either big or small.For starters there is of course the excellent cast. As the third actor to play the role of Professor Bernard Quatermass for the BBC (and the fourth if you count Brian Donlevy in the first two Hammer Quatermass films made prior to this being aired) Andr&eacute; Morell gives what might very well be the definitive Quatermass. From the moment he appears Morell takes on the role and makes it his own with his excellent line delivery and very human reactions to the situations around him. Morell's Quatermass is more convincing then his predecessor as both scientist and as a man frightened by what he finds and is all the better for it. Yet Morell's Quatermass is just the first of what can be termed a trio of leading characters.The other two characters in that trio are Cec Linder as Dr. Matthew Roney and Anthony Bushell as Colonel James Breen. Linder plays Roney as a man fascinated by his discoveries and willing to the consequences of them no matter the cost. Linder and Moreell also have some fantastic chemistry together that makes the friendship between Quatermass and Roney seem even more realistic. Bushell as Breen on the other hand is just the opposite: a man almost primitive in his thinking to the point of ignoring the facts. If Roney is Quatermass's friend then Breen is his enemy and the man most responsible for the serial's shocking finale. Bushell gives a fine, if not over the top at times, performance as the army officer forced into a sequence of events he can not understand nor wants to.The rest of the cast is fine as well. From John Stratton as the leader of the bomb disposal squad to Christine Finn as Roney's assistant to Brian Worth as journalist James Fullalove to Richard Shaw as Sladden and Robert Perceval as the Minsiter of Defense amongst many there isn't a role miscast in the entire six episode production. The production proves that it isn't just the leading roles that count but the small ones as well.For all the excellent members of the cast it is as much the aspects of the serial behind the camera that make Quatermass And The Pit as imaginative and brilliantly crafted as it is. Despite being a live TV production Quatermass And The Pit as the feel of being a feature film of the time. This is especially true of both the music and especially of the special effects. The haunting score of Trevor Duncan remains a fantastic example of how a simple score can be made highly effective. The special effects done by Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine remain as impressive to this viewer today as they must have been for audiences fifty years ago including the sequence at the end of part four and of course the insect like Martians.Then there is the script at the heart of it all. A decade or so before Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke brought it to the mainstream in 2001: A Space Odessy, writer Nigel Kneale asked the fascinating (and to some terrifying) question ""what if what makes us human isn't human at all?"" and terrifyingly answered it. Kneale looks at human nature and in particular racism and the occult in a science fiction context and shows us the consequences of racism in a way that is too realistic to be ignored. Kneale uses the limitations of live TV (i.e. a story driven by dialog mainly) to create a script full of fine dialouge and debates on everything from the nature of racism to the military takeover of otherwise peaceful scientific research. In particular there are two speeches by Quatermass (one at the Ministry in episode four and the other at the end of episode six) that stand out as amongst the best pieces of science fiction writing ever.In short Quatermass And The Pit is television science fiction at its best. It is a production full of fine performances, good effects, fine music and a brilliant script. It might be fifty years old, in black and white and rather filled with dialouge but you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way for that makes Quatermass And The Pit brilliant fifty years on.",5,"An Imaginative And Brilliantly Crafted Piece Of Science Fiction,",1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,4348,"['saying', 'am', 'rather', 'fond', 'going', 'out', 'best', 'six', 'weeks', 'late', '1958', 'early', '1959', 'BBC', 'brought', 'involvement', 'Quatermass', 'stories', 'close', 'doing', 'so', 'lived', 'up', 'saying', 'producing', 'what', 'one', 'most', 'imaginative', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'pieces', 'science', 'fiction', 'ever', 'be', 'put', 'screen', 'big', 'small.For', 'starters', 'course', 'excellent', 'cast', 'third', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'Professor', 'Bernard', 'Quatermass', 'BBC', 'fourth', 'count', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'first', 'two', 'Hammer', 'Quatermass', 'films', 'made', 'prior', 'being', 'aired', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Morell', 'what', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'definitive', 'Quatermass', 'moment', 'Morell', 'role', 'own', 'excellent', 'line', 'delivery', 'very', 'human', 'reactions', 'situations', 'Morell', 'Quatermass', 'more', 'convincing', 'then', 'predecessor', 'scientist', 'man', 'frightened', 'what', 'better', 'Morell', 'Quatermass', 'just', 'first', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'termed', 'trio', 'leading', 'characters.The', 'other', 'two', 'characters', 'trio', 'are', 'Cec', 'Linder', 'Dr.', 'Matthew', 'Roney', 'Anthony', 'Bushell', 'Colonel', 'James', 'Breen', 'Linder', 'Roney', 'man', 'fascinated', 'discoveries', 'willing', 'consequences', 'matter', 'cost', 'Linder', 'Moreell', 'also', 'have', 'fantastic', 'chemistry', 'together', 'friendship', 'Quatermass', 'Roney', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'realistic', 'Bushell', 'Breen', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'opposite', 'man', 'almost', 'primitive', 'thinking', 'point', 'ignoring', 'facts', 'Roney', 'Quatermass', 'friend', 'then', 'Breen', 'enemy', 'man', 'most', 'responsible', 'serial', 'shocking', 'finale', 'Bushell', 'fine', 'not', 'top', 'times', 'performance', 'army', 'officer', 'forced', 'sequence', 'events', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'to.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Stratton', 'leader', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'squad', 'Christine', 'Finn', 'Roney', 'assistant', 'Brian', 'Worth', 'journalist', 'James', 'Fullalove', 'Richard', 'Shaw', 'Sladden', 'Robert', 'Perceval', 'Minsiter', 'Defense', 'amongst', 'many', ""n't"", 'role', 'miscast', 'entire', 'six', 'episode', 'production', 'production', ""n't"", 'just', 'leading', 'roles', 'count', 'small', 'ones', 'well.For', 'excellent', 'members', 'cast', 'as', 'much', 'aspects', 'serial', 'camera', 'make', 'Quatermass', 'Pit', 'imaginative', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'being', 'live', 'TV', 'production', 'Quatermass', 'Pit', 'feel', 'being', 'feature', 'film', 'time', 'especially', 'true', 'music', 'especially', 'special', 'effects', 'haunting', 'score', 'Trevor', 'Duncan', 'fantastic', 'example', 'how', 'simple', 'score', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'highly', 'effective', 'special', 'effects', 'done', 'Bernard', 'Wilkie', 'Jack', 'Kine', 'remain', 'as', 'impressive', 'viewer', 'today', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'audiences', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'including', 'sequence', 'end', 'part', 'four', 'course', 'insect', 'Martians.Then', 'script', 'heart', 'A', 'decade', 'so', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Arthur', 'C.', 'Clarke', 'brought', 'mainstream', '2001', 'Space', 'Odessy', 'writer', 'Nigel', 'Kneale', 'asked', 'fascinating', 'terrifying', 'question', 'what', 'what', 'human', ""n't"", 'human', 'terrifyingly', 'answered', 'Kneale', 'human', 'nature', 'particular', 'racism', 'occult', 'science', 'fiction', 'context', 'consequences', 'racism', 'way', 'too', 'realistic', 'be', 'ignored', 'Kneale', 'limitations', 'live', 'TV', 'i.e', 'story', 'driven', 'dialog', 'mainly', 'create', 'script', 'full', 'fine', 'dialouge', 'debates', 'everything', 'nature', 'racism', 'military', 'takeover', 'otherwise', 'peaceful', 'scientific', 'research', 'particular', 'are', 'two', 'speeches', 'Quatermass', 'one', 'Ministry', 'four', 'other', 'end', 'episode', 'six', 'stand', 'out', 'amongst', 'best', 'pieces', 'science', 'fiction', 'writing', 'ever.In', 'short', 'Quatermass', 'Pit', 'television', 'science', 'fiction', 'best', 'production', 'full', 'fine', 'performances', 'good', 'effects', 'fine', 'music', 'brilliant', 'script', 'might', 'be', 'fifty', 'years', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'rather', 'filled', 'dialouge', 'know', 'what', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'way', 'Quatermass', 'Pit', 'brilliant', 'fifty', 'years']",N/A

1112821,AA1PC0QO51BWQ,B000X0TVUC,Spike3,"[1, 2]","Unlike many others, I didn't have any outstanding playing issues with the DVD.  I thought the production was atmospheric, and the special effects decent for a late 1950's BBC production.  However, I couldn't help but notice an audio speaker at the top of the thought projection helmet.My problem comes with the script trying to be too many things, and the plot inconsistencies which resulted.Spoilers follow:By the end of the movie, we've established a couple of things:Alien invaders deemed ""martians"" (I don't recall any proof of that origin within the series, other than visions of the planet seeming to have had a red atmosphere) are completely dead (and have been for an estimated 5 million years), but have infused their consciousness into a ceramic ship which can somehow absorb power from insulated AC powerlines.  The alien intellect seems limited to telekinesis and obsessive genocide (of any foreign life form).  In spite of this, for some reason, they have managed interplanetary travel.The ""science-fiction"" story is more of a ""theory-fiction"" story, in that the story's  foundation is based on assuming the theory of evolution is true  - well, sort of.  You see, man was only able to evolve to the status of monkey which walks erect.  It took the good intentions of the three legged genocidal insects doing biological and surgical experiments on the monkeys to produce what would become known as the human race.  Aside from most genetic mutations being destructive ones, a lack of transitionary species (which should be abundant, were evolution correct), and considering that true science is based on observation - whereas Abiogenic origination of life has never been observed or demonstrated.  Even with the intelligent input of scientists (which would only serve to support Intelligent Design) we have not been able to create life from non-life.  So having these bugs were genocidal to the point of killing their own species (if they were viewed as non-conforming).  It seemed like a really weak plot device to propose that evolution was true, but it could only do so much - we needed giant alien bugs to finally kick off our sentience.  Weird, since the bugs did not behave at all intelligently during the story, but rather came across as solely malevolent and psychotic.  Even if they had the scientific ability and tools to do it, why would they bother messing around making mutants of a totally foreign species, instead of just killing them off?  Their purpose was invasion, yes?  What's easier to get rid of: unintelligent monkeys, or sentient beings who would defend themselves?A proposed result of this supposed martian heritage is that each of us has a genetic memory of the carnage of the bugs carrying on their killing spree before they left for earth, and that memory is really really scary.  So scary that it would put a seasoned excavator and a female anthropologist into shock.  You wouldn't think seeing bugs attacking each other would be so depressing.And what of the spaceship?  Three bugs were completely preserved because they had completely sealed themselves off in part of the ship, and had remained that way until that part of the ship was opened to the atmosphere after 5 million years (via a method never examined after the borazon drill failed)...per Wikipedia, ""Following the drilling attempt, a hole has somehow opened up in the wall"".  It was theorized the aliens sealed themselves off because they were not resistant to earth bacteria.  So it was better to die of suffocation and starvation than disease?  And what of bacteria encountered during their ""biological and surgical experimentation""?Telekinesis was only imparted  to those ""in tune"" with the bug consciousness.  By the last chapters, the in-crowd was using it to attack the uncool with flying objects.  However in the first telekinetic instance, the guy effected was causing stuff to fly at and injure himself.  Why?  And what was the rational for him assuming the stature and movements of one of the bug creatures while all of this was occurring, and why did it wear off when he collapsed at the church door?The bugs were taken to be synonymous with ancient demons, and we are told that demons hate iron and water.  This was new to me, so I looked up the topic and came up with this:  ""In theory, if ghosts do exist and they do use electromagnetic energy to manifest, then hypothetically one could use a conductor of electricity, such as iron to drain or ground out the energy from the spirit. Therefore, touching a grounded, iron object to the spirit itself would drain all usable energy from that spirit. Based on this theory, many cemeteries are enclosed by iron fencing to keep the spirits in"".  That factor at least follows, the ship was powered by magnetic energy, absorbing ever so slight power from insulated cables, as straight wire produces very little electromagnetic flux.  So at least the end, with a chain grounded to the Knightsbridge plumbing system becomes plausible within context.  However, with 5 million years to absorb magnetic flux from the earth's poles, it doesn't make sense for the ship to have remained dormant until dug up.Ah, but was it really dormant?  News items record strange noises and happenings in the area going back hundreds of years, and a workman saw a ""ghost"" walk through the wall.  So if the powers that be could manifest themselves while buried in the ground, why bother possessing people - for the sole purpose of exterminating others who couldn't be possessed - instead of doing it themselves?  And if you're intelligent, why spend centuries doing nothing but spooking the locals?And what's the deal with some people getting physically infected with something which physically resembles frostbite on the skin?  Why did none of them go to the doctors and make an issue of it?  Was it because they were possessed?  If the people could be possessed by mind, why ruin their bodies, as in Colonel Breen finding himself turned into a snowman by the end of the story along with a couple others.  Are we to assume that others infected were cured when the spaceship was destroyed?As I saw it, the script had too many loose ends, too many improbabilities, and just too much stuff thrown together which didn't really fit.I found suspension of disbelief easier with the Quatermass II serial.",3,"Ghost story, bureaucratic critique, horror story, invasion story, et al",1357084800,"01 2,
