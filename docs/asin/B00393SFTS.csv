I know very little of Thai and Malaysian culture, so a lot of the settings for this movie were alien to me. The result is a story that is at the same time classic (you may say cliche, in some cases), epic with its dose of action and heroic characters (Lord Jarang and Pari on everyone else), and a very particular twist (the magic of the Du Lum). Overall I enjoyed it completely. I'd recommend it if you are looking for something entertaining and definitely out of the beaten path.",5,Quite unique,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,550,"['hard', 'classify', 'movie', 'traits', 'make', 'unique', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'Thai', 'Malaysian', 'culture', 'lot', 'settings', 'movie', 'were', 'alien', 'result', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'classic', 'may', 'say', 'cliche', 'cases', 'dose', 'action', 'heroic', 'characters', 'Lord', 'Jarang', 'Pari', 'everyone', 'else', 'very', 'particular', 'twist', 'magic', 'Du', 'Lum', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'completely', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'beaten', 'path']",Legend of the Tsunami Warrior

1333407,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00393SFTS,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","The most confusing part of this movie was the plot, or plots, or understanding the direction the story and its motley plots are taking.  In the beginning these giant, powerful cannons are lost in battle and sink to the bottom of the sea.  Some Princess anticipating more of an unending battle with her nemesis wants to retrieve them, but they're just too gosh-darned deep.  So this princess' engineers try to recreate the technology, but fail.  Our attention then begins to shift between a love story of sorts, a fisherman-sorcerer whose powers grants all the insights offered by your local weather forecast and allow communication with sea life, a sundered tale of betrayal and revenge, a sorcerer who employs a cadre of pirates and Thai-style ninjas, another maybe-not-bad sorcerer, flashbacks involving some Dutchmen and the cannons, and a Dragonball-like sorcery training session.  Basically a whole lot of sorcery and a whole lot of random crammed into a whole lot of generally slow-paced movie.  Two hours of it to be exact.  But wait, towards the end we come full circle back to the cannons in a siege battle.Just about everything in this movie is of inconsistent quality.  The combat choreography is not complex, some of the moves are filmed crisply while others seem poorly executed, and a few solid acrobatics are snuck in among other lethargically-wired maneuvers.  This movie features beautiful underwater shots and gorgeous set design.  However, the CGI effects (when they are not CGI sea creatures) are of inconsistent quality and the wardrobe follows suit, ranging from stunning to uninspired.  Most outfits are dull and maybe authentic, but then the team of assassins in the beginning had the most impressive garbs of the entire movie.  What gives?That said, it appeared that they were trying really hard to make this a Thai mega-adventure movie.  I can respect that.  I'd never watch this movie again, but I wouldn't necessarily suggest that you never watch it.  I have a feeling that you'll either love it (like many an Amazon reviewer seemed to) or just feel ""eh"" after watching it (like me).This is a mediocre Asian saga movie.

Finally, I decided to play it through streaming (on Netflix as of 6/13/12). To my surprise, Tsunami Warrior brings a unique fantasy epic that I truly enjoyed.The story is about a rebel war against the queen. Each side really needs cannons to beat the opposing force. Each side also has their own set of allies. There is the queen's army, the rebels, some ninjas, pirates, and even sorcerers. The magic used throughout the story is called Du Lum, which has a light and a dark side; think of it kind of like Star Wars, they even use a similar Force Push. The Du Lum is also used to summon sea critters for assistance. There are martial arts and weapons based fights along the whole movie, leading to an epic war from sea to kingdom. The movie is a mixture of action, adventure, fantasy, and some romance.I was interested throughout the entire movie, especially when it starts to pick up about 30 minutes in. The settings were also great. I don't have any complaints in the acting. My complaint comes from the weak special effects, but I quickly got over it. I enjoyed the movie because it's so different from the regularly released movies. For anyone looking for something out of the ordinary, I highly recommend it.(4.5/5)",5,"Bizarre but amazing!

This tale of an ancient &#34;Aquaman&#34; is a lot of fun. The C.G.I. is well done & the costumes are beautiful. The tenacious self sacrifice of the newly appointed queens guard & his sub sequential ever growing collection of scars bears testimony of his loyalty almost steals the show. But there is so much going on that no one character could possibly steal a show of this scope! Action galore, and I love the involvement of the different cultures interacting in this very fun film!

And that mysterious powers gained through sorcery must come from a place of love & light & will always backfire if the power comes from hate & revenge.

Pirates,Ninjas,Martial Arts,Aqua Man, romance, drama, etc...etc... it's all here. For what the film is it's pretty entertaining. I can't say anything truly bad about it. It has a lot of action and special effects, and the acting is on par with the typical acting you'd expect from an action movie like this. The films is also lengthy about 2hrs or so but it actually feels longer since there is so much happening. Matter of fact I think that's the only part about this movie where anything can be taken away from it. There is just too much going on in the movie.There's about 5 different plots and sub plots all happening on film at once. Trying to follow the main story is a bit hard because you can't figure out just what is the main story. Is it about Wizards? Is it about revenge? Is it about romance? just what is this film about. I'm still asking myself haven seen it and I still don't have the answer. My advice to anyone watching the movie is to pick a character and follow their story. It's almost like a Choose your adventure story. You can pick The body guard,the Queen, The Princess, The Canon Engineer, The young Wizard,The Old Wizard, The Pirate king, I mean just pick one. All of their stories get about equal play time in this movie (I picked the Queen I liked her outfit).Basically to anyone interested in this movie the first thing you need to know is that it's subtitled, and that it was made in Thailand and has a heavy influence of Eastern Culture. If your not into those types of movies than right of the type you won't enjoy this film... however if you don't mind a little culture shock, than like me you will probably find the film entertaining.There's really no comparison to this film. It just branches off into too many directions. The mains story is about a Young man who is born with the power to control the sea. He has a gift for a magic art called ""Dun Lum"" that allows him to do this. The young man grows up in a humble and peaceful village. When he is older he finds himself wanting to protect the things he loves so he joins a group of local towns people who ward off pirates. Some stuff happens and he finds himself looking after the village inventor who has many secrets that lead him to the adventure that turns him into the Tsunami Warrior.That is the bases of the plot the rest you'll figure out on your own should you decide to watch the movie. I recommend checking the film out it's on the level of a Pirates of the Caribbean with the action sequences cinematography. The feel of the film isn't cheap but there's some effects that you have seen done better (which some reviews nag about). It you watch this expecting an entertaining action film that is what you will get because that is just what this film is. Don't try to pick it apart or try to fill in all the holes. Just enjoy the film for what it is.I recommend renting this film to see if you like it before adding it to your collection.",3,A decent film worth looking into...,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,3010,"['Legend', 'tsunami', 'warrior', 'mix', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'Pirates', 'Ninjas', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'Aqua', 'Man', 'romance', 'drama', 'etc', 'etc', 'here', 'what', 'film', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'truly', 'bad', 'lot', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', 'par', 'typical', 'acting', ""'d"", 'expect', 'action', 'movie', 'films', 'also', 'lengthy', '2hrs', 'so', 'actually', 'longer', 'so', 'much', 'happening', 'Matter', 'fact', 'think', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'where', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'movie.There', '5', 'different', 'plots', 'sub', 'plots', 'happening', 'film', 'once', 'Trying', 'follow', 'main', 'story', 'bit', 'hard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'main', 'story', 'Wizards', 'revenge', 'romance', 'just', 'what', 'film', ""'m"", 'still', 'asking', 'haven', 'seen', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'answer', 'advice', 'anyone', 'watching', 'movie', 'pick', 'character', 'follow', 'story', 'almost', 'Choose', 'adventure', 'story', 'can', 'pick', 'body', 'guard', 'Queen', 'Princess', 'Canon', 'Engineer', 'young', 'Wizard', 'Old', 'Wizard', 'Pirate', 'king', 'mean', 'just', 'pick', 'one', 'stories', 'get', 'equal', 'play', 'time', 'movie', 'picked', 'Queen', 'liked', 'outfit', '.Basically', 'anyone', 'interested', 'movie', 'first', 'thing', 'need', 'know', 'subtitled', 'was', 'made', 'Thailand', 'heavy', 'influence', 'Eastern', 'Culture', 'not', 'types', 'movies', 'right', 'type', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'culture', 'shock', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'film', 'really', 'comparison', 'film', 'just', 'branches', 'off', 'too', 'many', 'directions', 'mains', 'story', 'Young', 'man', 'who', 'born', 'power', 'control', 'sea', 'gift', 'magic', 'art', 'called', 'Dun', 'Lum', 'do', 'young', 'man', 'up', 'humble', 'peaceful', 'village', 'When', 'older', 'wanting', 'protect', 'things', 'so', 'group', 'local', 'towns', 'people', 'who', 'ward', 'off', 'pirates', 'stuff', 'happens', 'looking', 'village', 'inventor', 'who', 'many', 'secrets', 'lead', 'adventure', 'Tsunami', 'Warrior.That', 'bases', 'plot', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'own', 'should', 'decide', 'watch', 'movie', 'recommend', 'checking', 'film', 'level', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'action', 'cinematography', 'feel', 'film', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'effects', 'have', 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'reviews', 'nag', 'watch', 'expecting', 'entertaining', 'action', 'film', 'what', 'will', 'get', 'just', 'what', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'pick', 'apart', 'try', 'fill', 'holes', 'Just', 'enjoy', 'film', 'what', 'is.I', 'recommend', 'renting', 'film', 'see', 'like', 'adding', 'collection']",Legend of the Tsunami Warrior

1333417,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00393SFTS,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[6, 6]","The Legend Of The Tsunami Warrior (original Thai title - Puen Yai Jon Salad) takes place in a fantastical centuries-ago Thailand, where a peaceful and prosperous coastal kingdom is threatened by the increasingly bold raids of a small army of cutthroat pirates.  As the land's benevolent queen and her allies attempt to navigate the diplomatic waters and gather allies - often at great risk of life and limb - to stand against the murderous anarchy, two warriors end up leading the struggle on the battlefront.  One is an extraordinarily skilled young member of the royal guard. The other is a man who was orphaned during a pirate raid years back, and now seeks to learn the ancient art of 'Du Lum' (I believe that's what it was called) - a magic that can control the oceans and its creatures - to fight back against the pirates and avenge his family.In this fast-moving, twist-filled adventure tale, there's tremendous imagination and all kinds of surprises and plotlines running.  The most powerful cannon ever built lies sunken at the bottom of the sea and both sides seek to retrieve it; the orphaned warrior seeks out the last living master of Du Lum, who refuses to teach it to anyone for fear of its destructive power; the backstory of various characters becomes revealed.  Come to think of it, it sounds very much like a live-action anime, and I think this will have great appeal for anime fans, as well as fans of everything fromThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)to Chinese historical epics likeThe Warlordsto Thai action-eers likeOng-Bak - The Thai Warrior.  Cool special effects, engaging heroes and villains, astonishing action sequences and spectacular visuals all help raise this one way up.  Another thing I liked was the way they set up the 'good guys vs. bad guys' scenario this time around.  Often with a story like this you have the good kingdom and the evil kingdom.  The good kingdom is present, along with the good kingdom's attempts to search out like-minded allies.  But instead of an evil kingdom per se, we've got a loose association of pirates, mercenaries and assasins from all over the place - Thailand, Java, I think Burma was the homeland of some of them - all gathered together for their own gains.  Nice change of pace.While some will think that some of the more dynamic action sequences were overkilled a bit, and some will think that some of the drama tended toward the melodramatic, I don't really agree.  It all fit in with the huge, epic feel of the tale being told.And kind of on topic with 'huge, epic feel', who can resist the sight of vicious marauders on the open seas being opposed by heroes riding in on the backs of giant manta rays?  And to answer any questions, it DIDN'T come off campy.  You need style to make that kind of thing work so well, and the filmmakers here have it.One of the best Thai movies I've yet seen.",5,"Mighty, Imaginative Epic On The Seas of An Ancient And Magical Thailand",1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,2924,"['Legend', 'Tsunami', 'Warrior', 'original', 'Thai', 'title', 'Puen', 'Yai', 'Jon', 'Salad', 'place', 'fantastical', 'centuries-ago', 'Thailand', 'where', 'peaceful', 'prosperous', 'coastal', 'kingdom', 'threatened', 'increasingly', 'bold', 'raids', 'small', 'army', 'cutthroat', 'pirates', 'land', 'benevolent', 'queen', 'allies', 'attempt', 'navigate', 'diplomatic', 'waters', 'gather', 'allies', 'often', 'great', 'risk', 'life', 'limb', 'stand', 'murderous', 'anarchy', 'two', 'warriors', 'end', 'up', 'leading', 'struggle', 'battlefront', 'One', 'extraordinarily', 'skilled', 'young', 'member', 'royal', 'guard', 'other', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'orphaned', 'pirate', 'raid', 'years', 'back', 'now', 'learn', 'ancient', 'art', ""'Du"", 'Lum', 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'magic', 'can', 'control', 'oceans', 'creatures', 'fight', 'back', 'pirates', 'avenge', 'family.In', 'fast-moving', 'twist-filled', 'adventure', 'tale', 'tremendous', 'imagination', 'kinds', 'surprises', 'plotlines', 'running', 'most', 'powerful', 'cannon', 'ever', 'built', 'sunken', 'bottom', 'sea', 'sides', 'seek', 'retrieve', 'orphaned', 'warrior', 'out', 'last', 'living', 'master', 'Du', 'Lum', 'who', 'teach', 'anyone', 'fear', 'destructive', 'power', 'backstory', 'various', 'characters', 'becomes', 'revealed', 'Come', 'think', 'very', 'much', 'live-action', 'anime', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'appeal', 'anime', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'everything', 'fromThe', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Trilogy', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'Special', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'Chinese', 'historical', 'epics', 'likeThe', 'Warlordsto', 'Thai', 'action-eers', 'likeOng-Bak', 'Thai', 'Warrior', 'Cool', 'special', 'effects', 'engaging', 'heroes', 'villains', 'astonishing', 'action', 'sequences', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'help', 'raise', 'one', 'way', 'up', 'thing', 'liked', 'was', 'way', 'set', 'up', ""'good"", 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'scenario', 'time', 'Often', 'story', 'have', 'good', 'kingdom', 'evil', 'kingdom', 'good', 'kingdom', 'present', 'good', 'kingdom', 'attempts', 'search', 'out', 'like-minded', 'allies', 'instead', 'evil', 'kingdom', 'se', ""'ve"", 'got', 'loose', 'association', 'pirates', 'mercenaries', 'assasins', 'place', 'Thailand', 'Java', 'think', 'Burma', 'was', 'homeland', 'gathered', 'together', 'own', 'gains', 'Nice', 'change', 'pace.While', 'will', 'think', 'more', 'dynamic', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'overkilled', 'bit', 'will', 'think', 'drama', 'tended', 'melodramatic', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'agree', 'fit', 'huge', 'epic', 'feel', 'tale', 'being', 'told.And', 'kind', 'topic', ""'huge"", 'epic', 'feel', 'who', 'can', 'resist', 'sight', 'vicious', 'marauders', 'open', 'seas', 'being', 'opposed', 'heroes', 'riding', 'backs', 'giant', 'manta', 'rays', 'answer', 'questions', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'come', 'off', 'campy', 'need', 'style', 'make', 'kind', 'thing', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'filmmakers', 'here', 'have', 'it.One', 'best', 'Thai', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen']",Legend of the Tsunami Warrior
