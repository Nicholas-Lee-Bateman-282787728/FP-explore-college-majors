245064,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630109445X,Acute Observer,"[0, 4]","The In Crowd, 1987 filmLarry Parker is the host of a television show that caters to young adults by showing singing groups and teenagers dancing to music. A young man lip-syncs to what he sees on TV instead of studying (a flawed character?). We see the preparation that goes into the rehearsals. One girl needs a new dancing partner. There is personal conflict due to jealousy. ""Its really him."" Is fame fleeting? The show producer tries to control the guests' personal lives. The background suggests the 1960s. [No one seems to have a care about their future: college, marriage, or the draft.] Do movies create an emotional bond with their viewers? Yes.The couple visit a party. The girls talk about a movie actress as if she was a personal friend. A record player provides music at this train station. ]The ""twist"" was popular around 1962, then faded.] Cal is accepted by this crowd. Cal brings Vicky back home. Her boyfriend is not acceptable to her parents. Her father offers advice. Back at the High School life goes on. Cal is treated like a Big Shot after being shown on television. Did teenagers hang around a train station then? The English teacher discusses ""A Tale of Two Cities"". Cal shows good judgment. Larry Parker shows up at school. [Would such an interruption be possible then or now?] Do these dances show a form of popular conformity? Who makes them up? Cal and Popeye are caught by a gang and Cal gets punched in revenge. They pose for wedding photos at the boardwalk. The crowd is told to by record albums. [The show's purpose is to sell merchandise.]Cal and Vicky have another date. We see two dancers hopping around like trained professionals. [Those ""hot pants"" were in style in the early 1970s. Were they replaced by ""cigarette jeans""?] Cal and Vicky park in the rain. ""I'll cry too."" Cal finds a surprise visitor at home. They show off their dance steps, like some wild birds. [Believable?] Cal and Vicky attend a performance of ""The Mikado"". Would that appeal to most teenagers then or now?] There is a scene at dinner. Vicky tells Cal about her plans for her future. What will he do? The television station cancels Larry Parker's show. That new ""psychedelic"" music dates this era to about 1967 or so. [No mention of changed musical tastes or their cause.]The dancers gyrate as if they were trained professionals. ""Technical difficulties"" end the show. [Diminished audiences?] Cal needs to borrow his girlfriend's car for tonight. Will she do it? [Can you believe Cal's part in this plot? I can't.] The police transmit a warning about Dugan. ""Cast your fate to the wind"" was a popular song in 1964. Dugan has a problem with his bike. Cal's car hits a red police car. LPs have replaced 45 RPM records. Who wants to revisit Highway 61 in Minnesota? And so this movie finally ends.This recreation of the past fails to ring true to me. Do those who were born in the 1960s or later believe this story? If you can't believe this happening today can you believe it happening over fifty years ago? Its more of a parody that mock the imagined attitudes of people from that time. Did you find it funny? A false premise is a shaky foundation for anything. ""American Graffiti"" did a better job in reinventing the recent past.",1,Recreating the Past,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,3241,"['Crowd', '1987', 'filmLarry', 'Parker', 'host', 'television', 'show', 'young', 'adults', 'showing', 'singing', 'groups', 'teenagers', 'dancing', 'music', 'young', 'man', 'lip-syncs', 'what', 'TV', 'instead', 'studying', 'flawed', 'character', 'see', 'preparation', 'rehearsals', 'One', 'girl', 'new', 'dancing', 'partner', 'personal', 'conflict', 'due', 'jealousy', 'really', 'fame', 'fleeting', 'show', 'producer', 'control', 'guests', 'personal', 'lives', 'background', '1960s', '[', 'one', 'have', 'care', 'future', 'college', 'marriage', 'draft', ']', 'Do', 'movies', 'create', 'emotional', 'bond', 'viewers', 'Yes.The', 'couple', 'visit', 'party', 'girls', 'talk', 'movie', 'actress', 'was', 'personal', 'friend', 'record', 'player', 'music', 'train', 'station', ']', 'twist', 'was', 'popular', '1962', 'then', 'faded', ']', 'Cal', 'accepted', 'crowd', 'Cal', 'Vicky', 'back', 'home', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'acceptable', 'parents', 'father', 'offers', 'advice', 'High', 'School', 'life', 'Cal', 'treated', 'Big', 'Shot', 'being', 'shown', 'television', 'Did', 'teenagers', 'hang', 'train', 'station', 'then', 'English', 'teacher', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', 'Cal', 'good', 'judgment', 'Larry', 'Parker', 'up', 'school', '[', 'Would', 'interruption', 'be', 'possible', 'then', 'now', ']', 'Do', 'dances', 'show', 'form', 'popular', 'conformity', 'Who', 'up', 'Cal', 'Popeye', 'are', 'caught', 'gang', 'Cal', 'punched', 'revenge', 'pose', 'wedding', 'photos', 'boardwalk', 'crowd', 'told', 'record', 'albums', '[', 'show', 'purpose', 'sell', 'merchandise', ']', 'Cal', 'Vicky', 'have', 'date', 'see', 'two', 'dancers', 'hopping', 'trained', 'professionals', '[', 'hot', 'pants', 'were', 'style', 'early', '1970s', 'Were', 'replaced', 'cigarette', 'jeans', ']', 'Cal', 'Vicky', 'park', 'rain', ""'ll"", 'cry', 'too', 'Cal', 'surprise', 'visitor', 'home', 'show', 'off', 'dance', 'steps', 'wild', 'birds', 'Believable', ']', 'Cal', 'Vicky', 'attend', 'performance', 'Mikado', 'Would', 'appeal', 'most', 'teenagers', 'then', 'now', ']', 'scene', 'dinner', 'Vicky', 'Cal', 'plans', 'future', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'television', 'station', 'cancels', 'Larry', 'Parker', 'show', 'new', 'psychedelic', 'music', 'era', '1967', 'so', '[', 'mention', 'changed', 'musical', 'tastes', 'cause', ']', 'dancers', 'gyrate', 'were', 'trained', 'professionals', 'Technical', 'difficulties', 'end', 'show', '[', 'Diminished', 'audiences', ']', 'Cal', 'needs', 'borrow', 'girlfriend', 'car', 'tonight', 'Will', 'do', 'Can', 'believe', 'Cal', 'part', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", ']', 'police', 'transmit', 'warning', 'Dugan', 'Cast', 'fate', 'wind', 'was', 'popular', 'song', '1964', 'Dugan', 'problem', 'bike', 'Cal', 'car', 'red', 'police', 'car', 'LPs', 'have', 'replaced', '45', 'RPM', 'records', 'Who', 'revisit', 'Highway', '61', 'Minnesota', 'so', 'movie', 'finally', 'ends.This', 'recreation', 'past', 'fails', 'ring', 'true', 'Do', 'who', 'were', 'born', '1960s', 'later', 'believe', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'happening', 'today', 'can', 'believe', 'happening', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'more', 'parody', 'imagined', 'attitudes', 'people', 'time', 'Did', 'find', 'funny', 'false', 'premise', 'shaky', 'foundation', 'anything', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'reinventing', 'recent', 'past']",N/A

This movie is a nostalgic look at a time when our country was very different from what it has now become.  It covers the transition from the early Beatle era to the hippie scene.  However, it is the dancing which is superb; fascinating to watch.  Anyone who remembers Dick Clark and his regular troop of dancers when they were still in Philadelphia will really experience flashbacks!  Great soundtrack too.  If you love music, dancing and a good plot about a DJ who desperately tries to save his show and prevent the end of an era, don't hesitate to buy this great film.",5,Great Journey Back To The Sixties,1012003200,"01 26, 2002",2002,577,"['[', ']', 'movie', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'time', 'when', 'country', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'now', 'become', 'transition', 'early', 'Beatle', 'era', 'hippie', 'scene', 'However', 'dancing', 'superb', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Dick', 'Clark', 'regular', 'troop', 'dancers', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'Philadelphia', 'will', 'really', 'experience', 'flashbacks', 'Great', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'love', 'music', 'dancing', 'good', 'plot', 'DJ', 'who', 'desperately', 'save', 'show', 'prevent', 'end', 'era', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'buy', 'great', 'film']",N/A
