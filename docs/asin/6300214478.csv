Of course there is no bond as that bond of men that have faced death in battle.  You men seems to have a strong sense of loyalty because they thought of us as criminals because of Vietnam.  You know why? Hmm?  Because you lost.  And in this country that is like going bankrupt, your out of business. They want to forget about you, you cost too much and you didn't turn a profit. That's why they won't go over there and pickup our buddies and bring them home, because there is no gain.  That's because the books are still in the red.  The politicians still know the books are in the red, the same politicians that never lost one son in Vietnam, not one!&#34;Long speech, I know......but the very sad thing about it - it hits the nail right on the head.

I  saw this on the big screen when I was 14, and even then I was interested in  learning more about the Vietnam War.This may not necessarily be a guidebook  to what the war was like, but it certainly is a tribute to those that  fought, got captured, and died in that war.Film is excellent and does not  waste any time. Training scenes are best.One of the best parts is when the  men learn that wanna be gung ho type Marine(discharged for striking an RTO  who fell asleep!), who was not in Nam, wants to go save those men because  his father was shot down in the war.  Film is a fine production with  good effects, and an effective use of location shooting. Interesting  characterizations are conveyed to the audience rapidly as we learn a little  about each man that is recruited by Hackman to go find the missing POWS(his  son among them).I got teary-eyed at the end as survivor reveals to Hackman  how his son died in the prison camp.If any American is not moved by this  scene then you need about 20CCs of humanity.Highly recommended and  important film.",5,Uncommonly Good!,962064000,"06 27, 2000",2000,1349,"['loved', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'stupid', 'Norris', 'films', 'great', 'cast', 'here', 'that', 'fine', 'job', 'Hackman', 'Swayze', 'Stack', 'Randall', 'quot', 'Tex', 'quot', 'Cobb', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'Tim', 'Thomerson', 'Harold', 'Sylvester', 'almost', 'wish', 'did', 'sequel', 'may', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'when', 'was', '14', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'Vietnam', 'War.This', 'may', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'guidebook', 'what', 'war', 'was', 'certainly', 'tribute', 'fought', 'got', 'captured', 'died', 'war.Film', 'excellent', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'Training', 'scenes', 'are', 'best.One', 'best', 'parts', 'when', 'men', 'learn', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'gung', 'ho', 'type', 'Marine', 'discharged', 'striking', 'RTO', 'who', 'fell', 'asleep', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'Nam', 'go', 'save', 'men', 'father', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'war', 'Film', 'fine', 'production', 'good', 'effects', 'effective', 'use', 'location', 'shooting', 'Interesting', 'characterizations', 'are', 'conveyed', 'audience', 'rapidly', 'learn', 'little', 'man', 'recruited', 'Hackman', 'go', 'find', 'missing', 'POWS', 'son', 'got', 'teary-eyed', 'end', 'survivor', 'reveals', 'Hackman', 'how', 'son', 'died', 'prison', 'American', 'not', 'moved', 'scene', 'then', 'need', '20CCs', 'humanity.Highly', 'recommended', 'important', 'film']",N/A

Many believe that several soldiers in Vietnam suffered this ultimate fate.  It's America's duty to not only seek POWs, but to also bring them home.  When red-tape and politics stand in the way as a hindrance to freedom, drastic measures are necessary.Gene Hackman plays Jason Rhodes, a Korea vet who has been hired by Harry McGregor (Robert Stack) to succeed where democracy has failed.  Both have sons they believe to be POWs in Vietnam, and they intend to organize a daring rescue mission.Rhodes gathers many members from his son's former unit, a motley crew consisting of an explosives expert (Blaster - played by Reb Brown); a tunnle-rat, jungle warfare expert (Wilkes - played by Fred Ward); a wild man, warrior who is a little too attached to a grenade (Sailor - played by Randall ""Tex"" Cobb), and two helicopter pilots (played by Tim Thomerson and Harold Sylvster) for the evacuation of POWs.  They set up training at a replica POW camp in Galveston, TX - financed by McGregor.  There, they meet with Scott, played by Patrick Swayze, whose father is MIA in Vietnam.  Scott desperately wants to go on the mission, and his presence amongst seasoned vets creates tension at first.  Eventually, however, the team bonds, Scott is treated as equal, and the team is ready for the mission.What follows is a daring rescue mission with selfless acts, incredible heroism, daring rescues, and a perfect resolution - the ending all viewers want.One of the most unheralded Vietnam movies out there, and one of the best.

213001,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,6300214478,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[8, 10]","The premise of this film is that Americans were left behind in Southeast Asia after the war and the US government has done little or nothing to get them back home. This does not sit well with some people. Included among these are a powerful industrialist and a former Marine officer. They both have kids who were left behind and they are not willing to take bureaucratic platitudes in exchange for their kids' lives.Gene Hackman plays the retired Marine officer. He will not let things lie for the sake of diplomatic niceties. For 10 years after the war, he puts all his time and energy into tracking down information on the missing POWs. When he finds evidence, he recruits some of the buddies of his son to go on a private rescue expedition. He gets funding from a wealthy industrialist who also has a missing son. The scratch rescue team puts together a plan and heads to Southeast Asia.Nothing goes according to plan. The mission is betrayed by the US government and they lose their equipment and the majority of their funds. It looks like they are stuck but these guys are unwilling to take no for an answer. They pool their funds, scrounge some weapons and steal equipment. They then carry out their rescue mission with bittersweet results.Some of this film is believable. That US POWs were left behind is commonly accepted. That diplomatic niceties would lead to the betrayal and frustration of rescue efforts would be par for the course. That men would be willing to die to save friends and comrades in arms from eternal prison is also quite acceptable.Some of the film is beyond belief. The planning and execution of a complex mission seem substandard.

213004,ACNKNZSZQGZ5Q,6300214478,John Moulis,"[7, 7]","This was the first movie to address the previously hidden subject of soldiers missing in action after the Vietnam War.  It predates Rambo First Blood II by almost two years.  Comparing the two films is like comparing  Muhammad Ali to a preliminary boy. Uncommon Valor is an excellent movie -  well directed, well scripted and the incredible versatility of Gene Hackman  shines through.  It was the first movie to show Vietnam veterans in a positive light and changed the groundrules for portraying veterans and the war on the big and small screen.  Many people were upset by the film's ending - if you like happy  endings this is not for you.  Still, it is handled sensitively and doesn't  detract from the rest of the film.  One shining talent is the fellow who  plays Blaster (Reb Brown) whom producer John Milius previously used in Big Wednesday, another classic film.  Reb appeared in several other movies as well as a guest spot on the 1970s TV sitcom Happy  Days.  Another actor who glows like a beacon is Randall ""Tex""  Cobb.  Robert Stack puts in a glowing performance as the millionaire businessman who finances the mission to rescue the POWs.  An interesting thing is the fact that this was one of Patrick  Swayze's first films.  The success of movies like Dirty Dancing and Ghost can be traced back to his role as the young and gung-ho marine who joins the mission to rescue his father.  When this film was released in Australia it was  called Uncommon Valour and had different opening titles.  It was also rated  PG.  I can't for the life of me understand why the video is rated R.  Perhaps the bad odor created by Rambo First Blood II has tainted all movies  in this genre.

These movies showed the harrowing, gritty, and savage aspects that the Vietnam war doled out on soldiers.Now, what about those soldiers that did not come home?  Those soldiers that were left behind?  Those soldiers that the U.S. Government did not think were worth rescuing because it was not politically feasible?  Well, that brings us to Uncommon Valor.This is a movie about Prisoners of War who were not forgotten by a group of Veterans who put aside everything, put themselves in harms way, and dared to defy the U.S. Government to do the right thing and bring those soldiers home.We have Gene Hackman who is the retired Army colenel risking all to find his son and bring him home. Very powerful portayal here by Hackman who is determined to surmount all obstacles and do whatever is necessary and lead his group of men to find the prisoners.Fred Ward, in a very good role, is an ex-tunnel rat that is still very haunted by a quite traumatic experience he had in a tunnel in Vietnam replete with vivid nightmares.  Just as Hackmans character is still haunted by nightmares from the Korean war.  Ward, accepting his fears and the trials and tribulations to follow, knows that they cannot leave POW's behind.Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb is another one recruited who never quite regained touch with society after the war but is admirable in the way that he gives everything in his soul to make sure this mission is a success.Reb Brown, not a widely known actor as compared to some other characters in this movie, does a fine job as a demolitons expert who gives his life to ensure the success of bringing the boys home.Patrick Swayze is the young but tough-as-nails ex-Marine who will go to Hell and back to be part of this mission due to his father being shot down in Vietnam and who is Missing in Action.  When the other Veterans learn of Swayze's fathers status, they adopt Swayze as one of their own and Swayze does an excellent turn as an inexperienced but very, very determined team player.Tim Thomerson and Harold Sylvster are the helicopter pilots that absolutely refuse to quit, and, no matter what the odds, they will fly that team and those POW's out of danger no matter what it takes.  Both give excellent performances as great pilots under heavy stress.Lastly we have Robert Stack who, like Gene Hackman's character, has a son who is missing in action and has a vested interest in this mission.  Stack finances the whole operation and holds his ground when he is threatened by officials within the government to call off the mission.  Stack portrays his part very nicely.This movie is truly excellent and sends a very clear and decisive message.  The United States government thinks it is not worth the effort or politics or trouble to retrieve men lost in a very ugly and very horrifying war.  After what those men have been through in the war and in a prison camp, it is worth every dollar, every ounce of pain, every drop of sweat, every tear shed and every conviction of what is right to go and get those men out of that Hell hole and bring them home.  There should be no hesitation whatsoever.  You DO NOT leave anyone behind.......ever.

It's a hackneyed plot, of course - one that is supposedly based on a true story, but it sure did keep my eyes glued to the screen.Gene Hackman is cast as an army colonel whose son disappeared in Vietnam ten years before.  He suspects that there are secret prisoner of war camps in Laos and he is determined to find out what happened to his son.  This is where the plot becomes unbelievable.  Hackman looks up six of his son's former army buddies and enlists them in a secret mission to go to Laos and find out the truth.  Each of these men have a tale of their own, of course, and they are all reluctant to go back to the scene of their army experiences but Hackman convinces them and they are soon training for this job in a secret army training center, supervised by a young Patrick Swayze who must win the respect of the war-hardened older Vietnam veterans.  Testosterone flows as they compete on challenges and competitive training exercises with consists of hand-to-hand combat as well as stuff being blown up. Then, when they finally get overseas, they are met with one challenge after another as they bond in their mission.This is not a great film.  It has every clich&eacute; in the book.

213012,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6300214478,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I always liked this excellent film very much and recently I was delighted to discover that it didn't age AT ALL since 1983. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Frank Rhodes was a simple soldier when he went missing (presumed killed in action) in South Vietnam in 1972, the last year of American military presence in this country. His father, USMC  Colonel Jason Rhodes (Gene Hackman), always believed that he survived and was taken prisoner - but Frank was not released with other American POWs in 1973. Refusing to believe that his son is dead Colonel Rhodes spend all his time and money ever since to find out if there are any American prisoners still being held prisoners in Vietnam.Finally, after ten years of disappointments (and having since retired) he finds some information about a concentration camp in Laos (a vassal state of North Vietnam since 1975) in which other than local political prisoners are supposedly held also some Americans (either soldiers or civilians) who were captured by communist forces during Vietnam War.After petitioning government in Washington for help, but receiving none, Rhodes receives  financing and support from Senator MacGregor (Robert Stack), whose son also went missing in Vietnam. Having both reliable intelligence and sufficient funding, Rhodes recruits a group of Vietnam War veterans, including some who were in the same platoon with Frank and proposes them to cross into Laos from Thailand, attack the camp, free all American prisoners and bring them back. And then the film really begins.I always liked this film, from the first time I saw it in cinema in 1984, for following reasons:1. Actors are EXCELLENT! Gene Hackman and Robert Stack (as his character doesn't go on the mission for age reasons his role is rather small) are of course the greatest stars, but other than them we can also see there Fred Ward (who plays a former ""Tunnel Rat"") in one of his best roles and a very young Patrick Swayze (the only non-veteran member of the team), who absolutely SHINES in this film. But it is the professional kick boxer Randall ""Tex"" Cobb (a REALLY huge guy with a REALLY ugly mug) who is the real star of this film as Sailor, a really odd even if mostly harmless Vietnam veteran who clearly had too much LSD and strong liquor in his younger years...)))Less known but very able actors Reb Brown, Tim Thomerson and Harold Sylvester play the three remaining members of the team, explosive expert Blaster and chopper pilots Charts and Johnson.  Hawaiian actor Kwan Hi Lim plays Jiang, a Lao veteran who once fought for Americans and has now a smuggling business on border between Thailand and Laos and last but not least Americano-Vietnamese actress Lau Nga Lai plays one of his daughters, who can take care VERY efficiently of mules and merchandise as well as of any man trying to give her trouble...)))2. Scenario is strong, dialogs are very good, there are some lighter and even merry moments included (even if this film is mostly tragic and dark). Also, the fighting scenes are VERY GOOD - do not expect here one sided slaughters like in ""Rambo II"" and ""Missing in Action"" franchise and there certainly is no martial arts (of little use against guys with AK-47s...). No, here even if this is an adventure/action movie, fights are more realistic and tougher than usually in Hollywood productions - and when enemy opens fire some of his bullets bring death...3. This film shows some uncomfortable truths, usually passed under silence by the pinko press and left winged intellectuals. Even if the presence of American prisoners in South East Asia after 1975 was almost certainly a myth, the existence of extremely deadly concentration camps in both Vietnam and Laos (and let's not even talk about what the Red Khmers did in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979) is a FACT - and in both those countries this tropical version of gulag still exists TODAY in Year of Grace 2014!Another uncomfortable truth left wingers avoid to mention as far as possible is the massive use of chemical weapons by Vietnamese army against civilian populations belonging to ethnic minorities (mostly known under the collective name of ""Montagnards"") resisting the communist regime, both in Vietnam and in Laos. Countless tens of thousands of civilians were killed in those countries between 1976 and 1980 by massive use of sarin and mustard gas against their villages - as the result the anti-communist guerrillas FULRO were deprived of the support of the population and were completely defeated in Vietnam by 1985 - but some Hmong tribes continue to resist in Laos even today... This film is I believe the ONLY one in which those atrocities are even mentioned, when the team travels through a completely devastated, deserted country, in which even most of vegetation died...4. A particularly great care given to weaponry. Because of some complications the team loses most of its costly modern equipment in Thailand and they must improvise - as result once the real mission begins they will have to fight with an odd assortment of aged WWII (and even older!) but still valiant weaponry:- three M1911 Colt 0.45 handguns- five M1928A1 Thompson 0.45 sub-machine guns- one M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle- one M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) light-machine gun- one M18 57 mm recoilless rifleThis venerable collection of antiques will be later supplemented with captured weapons, but still...I also appreciated that instead of giving to all communist soldiers the AK-47s, director decided to equip at least some of them with older SKS Simonov semi-automatic rifles as it was frequently the case in South East Asia communist countries in the 80s- it actually adds a touch of authenticity...5. This film was the first and definitely the best of all the 80s ""Back to Vietnam to save the MIAs"" films - and it actually was the one that inspired them all, from the quite watchable ""Rambo II"" and the first ""Missing in Action"" to the very forgettable ""Missing in Action 2"", ""Missing in Action 3"" and ""Behind Enemy Lines"" (a.k.a ""P.O.W. the Escape"").Bottom line, this is an excellent adventure/action film, with great actors, good scenario, really abominable villains, powerful action scenes, strong ending and one helluva Last Speech Before The Battle by Gene Hackman. A film to buy, watch, love and keep for more viewings.

Haunted by visions that his son, a Vietnam War MIA, might still be alive in some camp in SE Asia, and with the backing of a Perot-ish entrepreneur (Robert Stack), he assembles a motley crew of former special forces officers for an ad-hoc search-and-rescue mission into Laos.  The vets, who've settled into civilian life (all walks) are reluctant, but Hackman manages to sell them - we lost, and in America, that's like going bankrupt, he tells them.  That's unacceptable (this movie came out, what, 1985?)  The film has two phases, preparing the vets for their return to combat readiness, and the final mission itself.I didn't want to see this flick when it came out, thinking it would be some screed right out of Soldier of Fortune, with Hollywood trying to bring its make-believe to a war that didn't want it.  Instead, &quot;Uncommon Valor&quot; excels - mostly because it eschews most of what would soon become normal for the Rambo movies.  The troops here aren't cold-calculating super-warriors who speak in hushed-Sly Stallone tones, and the Vietnamese aren't sidekicks who speak pidgin.  Instead, the vets are rusty and reluctant.  As Sailor, Randal &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb (who appears barechested thruought, wears a hand grenade and sleeps through Co. Rhodes' chinese firedrills) plays the least adjusted, and most combat ready of the vets, and it isn't clear how much he's there for comic relief or just there to remind how many vets hadn't readjusted to civilian life.  His opposite is Pat Swayze, an ex-marine (4th Recon Division, Rhodes tells us) who was too young to have served, but has his own reasons for having to go.  Also on board are Fred Ward, and Reb Brown - the latter playing a prodigy on the subject of mines and other explosives who doesn't let the incendiary nature of his craft keep him from bringing a Mr. Rogers bent to the show.  (&quot;Today boys and girls...&quot;)  Though quickly getting up to speed, they remain rusty through the film, unsure of themselves and completely mortal.  When the CIA intercepts the crew (the vanguard for the complacent politicians who lost no sons or brothers to the war) and seizes their weapons, the vets must go on with 2nd hand guns - cast-offs from earlier wars, and face a war that they've never really left.  The action scenes are sketched well and keep away from being exploitative, while the script manages to verge from serious to light when it matters, and never panders to any jingoism.  This is not a Rambo movie.  This is not about stamping &quot;victory&quot; where history shows defeat - but rather about grown men facing the consequences of their defeat when their nation would rather they just forget about it.",4,Above and Beyond most other Vietnam movies,982800000,"02 22, 2001",2001,2811,"['Colonel', 'Cal', 'Rhodes', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'US', 'Army', 'ret', 'last', 'long', 'line', 'dedicated', 'doomed', 'military', 'officers', 'Haunted', 'visions', 'son', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'MIA', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'camp', 'SE', 'Asia', 'backing', 'Perot-ish', 'entrepreneur', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'motley', 'crew', 'former', 'special', 'forces', 'officers', 'ad-hoc', 'search-and-rescue', 'mission', 'Laos', 'vets', 'who', ""'ve"", 'settled', 'civilian', 'life', 'walks', 'are', 'reluctant', 'Hackman', 'sell', 'lost', 'America', 'going', 'bankrupt', 'unacceptable', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'what', '1985', 'film', 'two', 'phases', 'preparing', 'vets', 'return', 'combat', 'readiness', 'final', 'mission', 'itself.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'flick', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'screed', 'right', 'Soldier', 'Fortune', 'Hollywood', 'trying', 'bring', 'make-believe', 'war', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Instead', 'quot', 'Uncommon', 'Valor', 'quot', 'mostly', 'most', 'what', 'would', 'soon', 'become', 'normal', 'Rambo', 'movies', 'troops', 'here', 'are', ""n't"", 'cold-calculating', 'super-warriors', 'who', 'speak', 'hushed-Sly', 'Stallone', 'tones', 'Vietnamese', 'are', ""n't"", 'sidekicks', 'who', 'speak', 'pidgin', 'Instead', 'vets', 'are', 'rusty', 'reluctant', 'Sailor', 'Randal', 'quot', 'Tex', 'quot', 'Cobb', 'who', 'barechested', 'thruought', 'hand', 'grenade', 'sleeps', 'Co.', 'Rhodes', 'chinese', 'firedrills', 'least', 'adjusted', 'most', 'combat', 'ready', 'vets', ""n't"", 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'there', 'comic', 'relief', 'just', 'there', 'remind', 'how', 'many', 'vets', 'had', ""n't"", 'readjusted', 'civilian', 'life', 'opposite', 'Pat', 'Swayze', 'ex-marine', '4th', 'Recon', 'Division', 'Rhodes', 'who', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'served', 'own', 'reasons', 'having', 'go', 'Also', 'board', 'are', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'latter', 'playing', 'prodigy', 'subject', 'mines', 'other', 'explosives', 'who', ""n't"", 'let', 'incendiary', 'nature', 'craft', 'keep', 'bringing', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'bent', 'show', 'quot', 'Today', 'girls', 'quot', 'quickly', 'getting', 'up', 'speed', 'remain', 'rusty', 'film', 'unsure', 'completely', 'mortal', 'When', 'CIA', 'crew', 'vanguard', 'complacent', 'politicians', 'who', 'lost', 'sons', 'brothers', 'war', 'weapons', 'vets', 'must', 'go', '2nd', 'hand', 'guns', 'cast-offs', 'earlier', 'wars', 'face', 'war', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'left', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'sketched', 'well', 'keep', 'away', 'being', 'exploitative', 'script', 'verge', 'serious', 'light', 'when', 'never', 'panders', 'jingoism', 'not', 'Rambo', 'movie', 'not', 'stamping', 'quot', 'victory', 'quot', 'where', 'history', 'defeat', 'rather', 'grown', 'men', 'facing', 'consequences', 'defeat', 'when', 'nation', 'would', 'rather', 'just', 'forget']",N/A
213030,A2FA18B50XGXJX,6300214478,Sam Damon Jr.,"[2, 4]","Another Gene Hackman masterpiece....what if?........We sent a private military unit back into Laos or Vietnam to rescue our abandoned servicemen?The film concludes rightly that our own government would get in the way, and then there would be the Vietnamese or the Laotians...after a battle scene at a asian rice paddy with burning helicopters...the first few moments of the film shows the futility to getting accurate intelligence, but once he gets it, Hackman's character acts on it. He goes to his son's team mates who made it out of the LZ that they left him at years ago...don't get wrapped over the axle like some vets do that its unrealistic that we would leave someone in this way, we wouldn't. The beginning is a METAPHOR--a symbol of what America did in a larger sense when she refused to fight and lose more men to return the men we left behind. Real Soldiers wouldn't leave a buddy if it meant themselves getting killed, our government's leaders/bureaucrats-for-life don't feel this way. If you realize the Soldiers are running and they can't see who is shooting at them you'll realize its a metaphor.There is a Ross Perot type fellow who comes in and funds the rescue team's training and they go into action. In country they lose all their weapons/equipment and are forced to improvise with WWII/Korean-era arms bought on the black market. Fortunately Hackman's Colonel is an old Korean war vet and he mentors them and soon they are on approach march to the POW camp, they split up and Team A assaults the camp while team B steals helicopters to get away. The battle scenes are realistic in that the need to aim with marksmanship skills is portrayed in lieu of the normal Hollywood garden-hose depiction of weapons. However, as good as the vets are in their fieldcraft, the odds are stacked against them and not everyone returns from the mission, but one American POW is rescued and though its not his son, Hackman's wife reunite under a flood of media lights to confront the liars in our government who said there were no POWs left behind.Its been over 17 years now since this film came out and we are no longer talking about our POW/MIAs; perhaps we should re-watch this film? The point of this film is a reality check: IF we sent military force into Southeast Asia we would find our men being held captive. That's the message of this film, now what are we going to do about it now? If our country had honor we would have the valor to send the Vietnamese an ultimatum: send back our living POWs within x amount of time or we will declare war on you, not &quot;normalizing&quot; relations because we are scared of having to fight the Red Chinese and want Vietnam to be our counter to their drive for control of the Pacific.",5,Art imitates life or the other way around?,970444800,"10 2, 2000",2000,2736,"['Gene', 'Hackman', 'masterpiece', '.what', '..We', 'sent', 'private', 'military', 'unit', 'back', 'Laos', 'Vietnam', 'rescue', 'abandoned', 'servicemen', 'film', 'rightly', 'own', 'government', 'would', 'get', 'way', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'Vietnamese', 'Laotians', 'battle', 'scene', 'asian', 'rice', 'paddy', 'burning', 'helicopters', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'film', 'futility', 'getting', 'accurate', 'intelligence', 'once', 'Hackman', 'character', 'son', 'team', 'mates', 'who', 'made', 'LZ', 'left', 'years', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrapped', 'axle', 'vets', 'do', 'unrealistic', 'would', 'leave', 'someone', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'beginning', 'METAPHOR', 'symbol', 'what', 'America', 'did', 'larger', 'sense', 'when', 'refused', 'fight', 'lose', 'more', 'men', 'return', 'men', 'left', 'behind', 'Real', 'Soldiers', 'would', ""n't"", 'leave', 'buddy', 'meant', 'getting', 'killed', 'government', 'leaders/bureaucrats-for-life', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'realize', 'Soldiers', 'are', 'running', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'who', 'shooting', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'metaphor.There', 'Ross', 'Perot', 'type', 'fellow', 'who', 'funds', 'rescue', 'team', 'training', 'go', 'action', 'country', 'lose', 'weapons/equipment', 'are', 'forced', 'improvise', 'WWII/Korean-era', 'arms', 'bought', 'black', 'market', 'Fortunately', 'Hackman', 'Colonel', 'old', 'Korean', 'war', 'vet', 'soon', 'are', 'approach', 'march', 'POW', 'camp', 'split', 'up', 'Team', 'A', 'camp', 'team', 'B', 'helicopters', 'get', 'away', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'realistic', 'need', 'aim', 'marksmanship', 'skills', 'portrayed', 'lieu', 'normal', 'Hollywood', 'garden-hose', 'depiction', 'weapons', 'However', 'as', 'good', 'vets', 'are', 'fieldcraft', 'odds', 'are', 'stacked', 'not', 'everyone', 'returns', 'mission', 'one', 'American', 'POW', 'rescued', 'not', 'son', 'Hackman', 'wife', 'reunite', 'flood', 'media', 'lights', 'confront', 'liars', 'government', 'who', 'said', 'were', 'POWs', 'left', 'behind.Its', 'been', '17', 'years', 'now', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'talking', 'POW/MIAs', 'perhaps', 'should', 're-watch', 'film', 'point', 'film', 'reality', 'check', 'sent', 'military', 'force', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'would', 'find', 'men', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'message', 'film', 'now', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'now', 'country', 'had', 'honor', 'would', 'have', 'valor', 'send', 'Vietnamese', 'ultimatum', 'send', 'back', 'living', 'POWs', 'x', 'amount', 'time', 'will', 'declare', 'war', 'not', 'quot', 'normalizing', 'quot', 'relations', 'are', 'scared', 'having', 'fight', 'Red', 'Chinese', 'want', 'Vietnam', 'be', 'counter', 'drive', 'control', 'Pacific']",N/A

First, why is the CIA doing surveillance at the American airport on a retired Colonel and his mercenary crew going on a POW/MIA mission?  The CIA is not chartered for domestic surveillance.  Second, the boat scene, after the crew has loaded its gear on it, fails to show Mr. Chang's two daughters.  It showed all the other members but not the girls - where were they?  Third, in the scene where Patrick Swayze fires from thehill-top down onto the Lao guards, Mr. Chang was shot in the head.  By whom?  Unless a sharpshooter was hiding nearby, it would be nearly impossible for an infantryman to shoot upward to his target and hit him in the forehead, especially with the ""fog of war"" occuring through most of that scene.Comments aside, the movie is inspiring and brings tears to my eyes due to the fact that a handful of guys had the balls to go back to SouthEast Asia and retrieve our POWs/MIAs whereas the Government failed to do so.

Judged objectively on its historical accuracy and plausibility, however, the movie was a childish over-simplification....and not very good.The premise, based on fact, was excellent: a mission to rescue American POW's from their sadistic captors in Laos. If accurately portrayed, with any regard for reality, the story could have risen to the four or five-star level, but instead it rapidly turns into an endless barrage of cartoonish cliches and characters that have all been seen countless times (and done much better) in movies like the Dirty Dozen. This movie bears as much resemblance to the Viet Nam war as Hogan's Heroes bears to WWII or the A-Team (TV series) bears to actual combat.See if any of these concepts seem familiar: for an impossible mission, gather a rag-tag team of misfits, take them to a secluded training site where they are quickly and miraculously turned into dedicated, disciplined fighters (in this case by chopping down trees and carrying poles around....the Navy Seals must have it all wrong). Naturally, their mission suffers several reversals (usually due to the ""evil"" government), but the team members all bravely choose to continue anyway, improvising as they go. Naturally, a couple are killed (usually the big, ugly ones), but the majority emerge relatively unscathed and victorious (to a crescendo of soul-stirring music). Does any of this sound familiar? Does this really sound like a four or five-star production to you?This movie may indeed have been loosely based on real events, but I absolutely guarantee that the way the REAL soldiers looked, acted, and prepared for the mission bears no, and I mean NO, resemblance to this gaggle of sterotypes. To imply otherwise is an insult to those men and a gross simplification of their mission. I sincerely wish that our enemies in Southeast Asia were cannon fodder for brave Americans who trained by carrying poles around; but reality, as always, was much more grim and certainly not as we wished it could have been.Indeed, superficial, formulaic, laughably simplistic movies like this are not only a disservice to heroic reality, they are an insult to common sense. Check out the perfect haircut and snow white teeth on the prisoner rescued last (Robert Stack's ""son"")...only Hollywood would insist on proper grooming for a POW who has been through years of hellish torture.It's a shame that an accurate movie could not have been made about the real mission, instead of this silly, sanitized, trite visualization. Finally, one last overriding question remains that must be asked of any ""heroic rescue"" plot: what is the net gain in sacrificing four people to save four people? Is this really a ""victory""?Buy it, rent it, watch it if you must....then see whose review hits this cliched nail on the head.",2,"This Movie was Unrealistic, Trite, and Cliche-Ridden.....",1121385600,"07 15, 2005",2005,2983,"['think', 'lot', 'high', 'ratings', 'given', 'movie', 'were', 'based', 'emotional', 'response', 'typical', 'Hollywood-style', 'revision', 'history', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'what', 'wish', 'had', 'happened', 'Judged', 'objectively', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'plausibility', 'however', 'movie', 'was', 'childish', 'over-simplification', 'not', 'very', 'good.The', 'premise', 'based', 'fact', 'was', 'excellent', 'mission', 'rescue', 'American', 'POW', 'sadistic', 'captors', 'Laos', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'regard', 'reality', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'risen', 'four', 'five-star', 'level', 'instead', 'rapidly', 'endless', 'barrage', 'cartoonish', 'cliches', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'movies', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'resemblance', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'war', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'WWII', 'A-Team', 'TV', 'series', 'actual', 'combat.See', 'concepts', 'seem', 'familiar', 'impossible', 'mission', 'gather', 'rag-tag', 'team', 'misfits', 'take', 'secluded', 'training', 'site', 'where', 'are', 'quickly', 'miraculously', 'turned', 'dedicated', 'disciplined', 'fighters', 'case', 'chopping', 'down', 'trees', 'carrying', 'poles', '.the', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'must', 'have', 'wrong', 'Naturally', 'mission', 'suffers', 'several', 'reversals', 'usually', 'due', 'evil', 'government', 'team', 'members', 'bravely', 'choose', 'continue', 'anyway', 'improvising', 'go', 'Naturally', 'couple', 'are', 'killed', 'usually', 'big', 'ugly', 'ones', 'majority', 'emerge', 'relatively', 'unscathed', 'victorious', 'crescendo', 'soul-stirring', 'music', 'sound', 'familiar', 'really', 'sound', 'four', 'five-star', 'production', 'movie', 'may', 'indeed', 'have', 'been', 'loosely', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'absolutely', 'guarantee', 'way', 'REAL', 'soldiers', 'looked', 'acted', 'prepared', 'mission', 'mean', 'NO', 'resemblance', 'gaggle', 'sterotypes', 'imply', 'otherwise', 'insult', 'men', 'gross', 'simplification', 'mission', 'sincerely', 'wish', 'enemies', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'were', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'brave', 'Americans', 'who', 'trained', 'carrying', 'poles', 'reality', 'always', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'grim', 'certainly', 'not', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'been.Indeed', 'superficial', 'formulaic', 'laughably', 'simplistic', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'disservice', 'heroic', 'reality', 'are', 'insult', 'common', 'sense', 'Check', 'perfect', 'haircut', 'snow', 'white', 'teeth', 'prisoner', 'rescued', 'last', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'son', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'insist', 'proper', 'grooming', 'POW', 'who', 'been', 'years', 'hellish', 'torture.It', 'shame', 'accurate', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'real', 'mission', 'instead', 'silly', 'sanitized', 'trite', 'visualization', 'Finally', 'one', 'last', 'overriding', 'question', 'must', 'be', 'asked', 'heroic', 'rescue', 'plot', 'what', 'net', 'gain', 'sacrificing', 'four', 'people', 'save', 'four', 'people', 'really', 'victory', 'Buy', 'rent', 'watch', 'must', '.then', 'see', 'review', 'cliched', 'nail', 'head']",N/A

The key characters played a brilliant role in this movie and also helped the American people remember about the possibility of MIA's still remaining in Southeast Asia.Gene Hackman plays Colonel Jason Rhodes, a proud military officer who is at his wit's end 10 years after the Vietnam War has ended, and his son, a fellow Marine officer who had been captured on an operation in Laos in 1972, still remains missing-in-action somewhere in Laos. Rhodes is so persistent in trying to get any info on getting his son back, he is soon forced into retirement and is going to Thailand to offer bribes to anyone who can sneak into Laos to get his son's signature, even if the signature happens to be fakes.By 1983, Rhodes gets in touch with several members of his son's old unit, including Patrick Swayze, who plays a former Marine who was in fact discharged after striking a radio operator, and with no previous war experience, to help get the men back on a war-footing, in order to penetrate deep into Laos illegally and rescue his son with any other MIA's they encounter. Some of them are reluctant, and one is just plain crazy, being taken out of a jail cell because he happens to like wearing a grenade around his neck. And with the help of a Texas billionaire oil-rig owner who just happens to be missing a son as well from the war, Rhodes takes his plan into action of training the men how to liberate a POW camp and to get supplies for their secret mission into Laos.Once in Thailand, their supplies are confiscated by the local police and told to leave the country as soon as possible. Undaunted, Rhodes and his team hook up with some contacts, some weapons from the black market, and move through the mountains and into Laos, with an encounter against a border patrol. The force splits up into two teams---one to hijack some helicopters from the Laotian Air Force, and the other to screen the nearby POW camp and to blow up their bridge across the river to prevent enemy reinforcements from reaching the camp.What happens after that is unexpected, including the unexpected fate of Rhodes' son being told by the liberated son of the Texas oil man himself. Explosions and casualties on both sides, including two out of three helicopters shot down.
