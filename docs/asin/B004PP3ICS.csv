1423654,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B004PP3ICS,blackaciddevil,"[3, 4]","Forget Me Not is a 2009 Supernatural Horror film directed by Tyler Oliver. It stars Carly Schroeder, Cody Linley, Chloe Bridges, Jillian Murray, Micah Alberti & Chris Atkins. It tells the story of Sandy Channing who, along with her friends, party to celebrate graduating one night when they decide to play a game that they played when they were kids in thier local cemetary. Unannouced, a girl appears and wants to join in the fun. The group lets her. Unfortunately, they find out that it was one big mistake because, from that point on, things start to happen to every one in the group.Despite the film recieving negative reviews and criticism, I personally thought the film was a good one. Sure, it took awhile for the story to get rolling and it was made on pretty low budget but the idea behind the movie was original and that's what I liked about the movie. You see too many films these days, Supernatural Horror or otherwise, that are too much alike and really predictable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this movie doesn't have its' moments that are downright predictable or unoriginal but, more often than not, it gets alot of things right. For that alone, I have to give props. The film company, Phase 4 Films, and the director were brave enough to tread new ground.The only gripes I had with the film was the fact that it took awhile for things to get rolling and the fact that they relied too much on showing skin as I think the film could've held its' own without that. My stance on that has always been, if it is integral to the story, I'm all for it....but, if it's there just to get a reaction out the viewer or to keep them interested, I'm not.Overall, Forget Me Not is a decent film. Don't listen to these naysayers. It's not as bad as they let it on to be.

1423655,A518CRYX4QKAH,B004PP3ICS,Bookworm936,"[4, 6]","Wow!  This movie was really rather lame.  We watched it the other day and dumped it off at the half price book store today.I understand the plot revolves around the rhyme/rules of the graveyard game played in the movie; however, it is severely flawed in its application.  The altering of time makes it awkward.  Some characters remember things and others don't even though they were in the same room and had shared experiences.  Also, the ending states what the person must do to overcome; yet, it doesn't work?  The fact it doesn't work violates the rules of the game.  The whole plot lacks cohesion and doesn't mesh well at all.The other things that bothered us were the characters. Their actions/attitudes were very pathetic.  Why would the movie include a scene where a teenage girl has sex with a store clerk while her friends steal alcohol?  I don't know many teens who would go to that extent for beer.  I understand the viewer normally suspends some disbelief in a horror movie; but a little bit of realism wouldn't hurt.  And I don't know many parents (the parent in the movie was the town sherrif) who would be OK with their child half naked and making out with their boyfriend on the counter while their buddy drinks a beer.A few other details bothered us but they were mainly about the settings...why the jeans were left on under the hospital gown (we are assuming for the sake of the actresses modesty).  Or why a person could walk around a hospital and not see ONE worker to question her about why she is out of bed.  Or how machines can function on their own accord?On a side note, when did ghosts start wearing duct tape on their clothing?  Is duct tape suppose to mean something scary or envoke terror into the hearts of the viewer?  The ""ghost make up/costumes"" were VERY POORLY done.  Infact, we found them very laughable.  And why do ghosts always move in the quick forward manner like the ghost from the Ring?  It seems like once the Ring came out all ghosts had to be black/white and move quickly in a jerky manner.",1,So ghosts use duct tape on clothing to look scary?,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,2037,"['Wow', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'rather', 'lame', 'watched', 'other', 'day', 'dumped', 'off', 'half', 'price', 'book', 'store', 'today.I', 'understand', 'plot', 'rhyme/rules', 'graveyard', 'game', 'played', 'movie', 'however', 'severely', 'flawed', 'application', 'altering', 'time', 'awkward', 'characters', 'remember', 'things', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'were', 'same', 'room', 'had', 'shared', 'experiences', 'Also', 'ending', 'states', 'what', 'person', 'must', 'do', 'overcome', 'yet', ""n't"", 'work', 'fact', ""n't"", 'work', 'rules', 'game', 'whole', 'plot', 'cohesion', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'all.The', 'other', 'things', 'bothered', 'were', 'characters', 'actions/attitudes', 'were', 'very', 'pathetic', 'Why', 'would', 'movie', 'include', 'scene', 'where', 'teenage', 'girl', 'sex', 'store', 'clerk', 'friends', 'steal', 'alcohol', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'teens', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'extent', 'beer', 'understand', 'viewer', 'normally', 'disbelief', 'horror', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'realism', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'parents', 'parent', 'movie', 'was', 'town', 'sherrif', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'child', 'half', 'naked', 'making', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'counter', 'buddy', 'drinks', 'beer.A', 'few', 'other', 'details', 'bothered', 'were', 'mainly', 'settings', 'why', 'jeans', 'were', 'left', 'hospital', 'gown', 'are', 'assuming', 'sake', 'actresses', 'modesty', 'why', 'person', 'could', 'walk', 'hospital', 'not', 'see', 'ONE', 'worker', 'question', 'why', 'bed', 'how', 'machines', 'can', 'function', 'own', 'accord', 'side', 'note', 'when', 'did', 'ghosts', 'start', 'wearing', 'duct', 'tape', 'clothing', 'duct', 'tape', 'suppose', 'mean', 'something', 'scary', 'envoke', 'terror', 'hearts', 'viewer', 'ghost', 'make', 'up/costumes', 'were', 'VERY', 'POORLY', 'done', 'Infact', 'found', 'very', 'laughable', 'why', 'do', 'ghosts', 'always', 'move', 'quick', 'forward', 'manner', 'ghost', 'Ring', 'once', 'Ring', 'came', 'out', 'ghosts', 'had', 'be', 'black/white', 'move', 'quickly', 'jerky', 'manner']",N/A

1423659,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004PP3ICS,Eric Sanberg,"[7, 9]","I would have liked to see this in better hands. It took nearly an hour before the story started to take shape and that's way too long for a flick like this.Here's the scoop. A group of high school seniors, on the weekend of their graduation, are partying and decide to play a particular game in the local cemetery. A young girl appears, unannounced, and wants to join in. They let her. After that, bad things begin to happen to the group. I won't spoil the mechanics but it really was a pretty good idea.The opening scenes are unremarkable. You meet these kids as they celebrate and party and booze it up and have sex. I had a difficult time keeping them straight and they were all too cute, shapely and good looking. The one girl's father is the town's head cop and I didn't believe him for a minute. I don't believe she would act like she did in front of her dad and I doubt he'd let her. As the girlfriends and boyfriends shifted their allegiances there were so many names tossed back and forth they melted into a murky pool. When I finally started to square them away is when the story started to take shape, but I was already getting antsy. Now the movie shifts into gear and you see, rather plainly, where things are headed. So now it's not as much a question of what's going to happen, but more a question of how. The creepified demon things that appear with increasing frequency throughout have been seen in any number of Japanese movies so there was nothing new there. The directing was hack level. The acting was OK. The production values in general were good enough.This is a shame. It's a good idea for a story but it was handled poorly. And at an hour fourty three it needed some editing.

Or have you forgotten a few acquaintances? I'll look at a yearbook and my sister will have to remind me ""You dated her in your sophomore year"", or ""You were best friends' senior year"".  But what if your friends start to disappear, time is altering, and no one remembers them except you. Strange, right?That's what Sandy (Carly Schroeder - Lizzie McGuire) thinks in Forget Me Not, when her friends Jake (Micah Alberti - All My Children), Hannah (Brie Gabrielle - Hannah Montana), Lex (Jillian Murray - The Graves), Chad (Zachary Abel - The Secret Life of the American Teenager), TJ (Sean Wing - You Again), and Layla (Chloe Bridges - Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam) begin disappearing, one at a time.It all begins when the group of friends, in a post graduation celebratory game of cemetery tag, includes a strange, nameless young lady, who, at the end of the game stands on the edge of a cliff and asks Sandy ""Do you remember me?"" before jumping. Soon after, her friends start to disappear and the timeline changes with nobody remembering the missing friends. Cue the flashbacks with a young Sandy (Courtney Briggs - The Gold Retrievers), and her friend from the orphanage Angela (Bella Thorne - Big Love) playing in the graveyard and picking flowers; forget-me-nots'. (I didn't see that one coming) Two events happen in the past that shape the events of the future. First Sandy brings her friends to play in the cemetery and Angela becomes jealous; and the friends play a prank on Angela in the graveyard one night that puts her in a coma six years before. Jump to the present, Angela is still in a coma, the friends are still missing, and Sandy is the only one who remembers them but the remaining friends think she's losing her mind.The main cast is relatively young, and don't have a large resume to lean on, but they carry the range of emotions from not-a-care-in-the-world high school graduates, to confusion and fear with at least a horror movie believability. There are small roles for names like Barbara Bain (Mission Impossible, Space 1999), Christopher Atkins (Blue Lagoon), and Dan Gauthier (Son in Law) give credibility to the film but in no way take away from the performances of this young cast.Special Features:Deleted ScenesAlternate EndingsPhoto GalleryTrailerKarl's Scores:Acting - B+Setting - ASpecial Effects - B+Creep Factor - ATension - AWhat the Heck Moments - Oh MyOverall - A+Smaller budget and ""B"" horror films seem to be more unique and have more passion then their big budget counterparts, and Forget Me Not is one of these. With a lesser known cast that is trying to make a name for themselves, and without a big effects budget, this film relies on a good script and passionate actors. Carly Schroeder turned in an amazing performance as the haunted Sandy, with the remaining cast assisting her voyage to insanity with the supportive disbelief you would expect from high school friends. Coupled with an exceptional plot twist, Forget Me Not is an unforgettable thrill ride, if you remember it.ComicsOnline give Forget Me Not 5, I remember 4, wait 3, I recall 2, I forget, maybe 1, no, it's definitely 5 memory lost friends out of 5.Pick up your copy of Forget Me Not on DVD at Amazon.com.Keep ComicsOnline.com at the top of your favorite for more horror reviews and news.",5,ComicsOnline Says,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,3425,"['Remember', 'friends', 'school', 'Can', 'remember', 'schoolmates', 'dated', 'partied', 'cruised', 'hung', 'out', 'have', 'forgotten', 'few', 'acquaintances', ""'ll"", 'look', 'yearbook', 'sister', 'will', 'have', 'remind', 'dated', 'sophomore', 'year', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'senior', 'year', 'what', 'friends', 'start', 'disappear', 'time', 'altering', 'one', 'Strange', 'right', 'what', 'Sandy', 'Carly', 'Schroeder', 'Lizzie', 'McGuire', 'Forget', 'Me', 'Not', 'when', 'friends', 'Jake', 'Micah', 'Alberti', 'My', 'Children', 'Hannah', 'Brie', 'Gabrielle', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'Lex', 'Jillian', 'Murray', 'Graves', 'Chad', 'Zachary', 'Abel', 'Secret', 'Life', 'American', 'Teenager', 'TJ', 'Sean', 'Wing', 'Again', 'Layla', 'Chloe', 'Bridges', 'Camp', 'Rock', '2', 'Final', 'Jam', 'begin', 'disappearing', 'one', 'time.It', 'when', 'group', 'friends', 'post', 'graduation', 'celebratory', 'game', 'cemetery', 'tag', 'strange', 'nameless', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'end', 'game', 'edge', 'cliff', 'Sandy', 'Do', 'remember', 'jumping', 'Soon', 'friends', 'start', 'disappear', 'timeline', 'changes', 'nobody', 'remembering', 'missing', 'friends', 'Cue', 'flashbacks', 'young', 'Sandy', 'Courtney', 'Briggs', 'Gold', 'Retrievers', 'friend', 'orphanage', 'Angela', 'Bella', 'Thorne', 'Big', 'Love', 'playing', 'graveyard', 'picking', 'flowers', 'forget-me-nots', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'Two', 'events', 'happen', 'past', 'events', 'future', 'First', 'Sandy', 'friends', 'play', 'cemetery', 'Angela', 'jealous', 'friends', 'play', 'prank', 'Angela', 'graveyard', 'one', 'night', 'coma', 'six', 'years', 'before', 'Jump', 'present', 'Angela', 'still', 'coma', 'friends', 'are', 'still', 'missing', 'Sandy', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'remaining', 'friends', 'think', 'losing', 'mind.The', 'main', 'cast', 'relatively', 'young', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'large', 'resume', 'lean', 'carry', 'range', 'emotions', 'not-a-care-in-the-world', 'high', 'school', 'graduates', 'confusion', 'fear', 'least', 'horror', 'movie', 'believability', 'are', 'small', 'roles', 'names', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Space', '1999', 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'Dan', 'Gauthier', 'Son', 'Law', 'give', 'credibility', 'film', 'way', 'take', 'away', 'performances', 'young', 'cast.Special', 'Features', 'Deleted', 'ScenesAlternate', 'EndingsPhoto', 'GalleryTrailerKarl', 'Scores', 'Acting', 'B+Setting', 'ASpecial', 'Effects', 'B+Creep', 'Factor', 'ATension', 'Heck', 'Moments', 'Oh', 'MyOverall', 'A+Smaller', 'budget', 'B', 'horror', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'unique', 'have', 'more', 'passion', 'then', 'big', 'budget', 'counterparts', 'Forget', 'Me', 'Not', 'one', 'lesser', 'known', 'cast', 'trying', 'make', 'name', 'big', 'effects', 'budget', 'film', 'good', 'script', 'passionate', 'actors', 'Carly', 'Schroeder', 'turned', 'amazing', 'performance', 'haunted', 'Sandy', 'remaining', 'cast', 'assisting', 'voyage', 'insanity', 'supportive', 'disbelief', 'would', 'expect', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'Coupled', 'exceptional', 'plot', 'twist', 'Forget', 'Me', 'Not', 'unforgettable', 'thrill', 'ride', 'remember', 'it.ComicsOnline', 'give', 'Forget', 'Me', 'Not', '5', 'remember', '4', 'wait', '3', 'recall', '2', 'forget', 'maybe', '1', 'definitely', '5', 'memory', 'lost', '5.Pick', 'copy', 'Forget', 'Me', 'Not', 'DVD', 'Amazon.com.Keep', 'ComicsOnline.com', 'top', 'favorite', 'more', 'horror', 'reviews', 'news']",N/A

""Professional Word Monkey""","[4, 9]","SYNOPSIS: A party-filled graduation weekend turns into a nightmare for popular class president Sandy Channing (Carly Schroeder) when her friends begin to vanish one by one. Soon Sandy discovers they have awakened the vengeful spirit of a girl they mistreated years ago. Now she must work to resolve the dark mysteries of her past before she and all her friends become unwilling victims in this bloody horror flick.REVIEW: I found the movie entirely predictable, but not in a bad way: teens finally get their comeuppance for a childhood prank and a game that goes wrong. It's like going on a rollercoaster ride of ghoulish thrills where you know who's going to get it next, but because the special effects are well done and the monsters are unique, it makes it for a scary fun time for all. Carly Schroeder plays the heroine in the movie in her first horror movie. There's not much of a storyline, lots of predictable 'jump-out-at-you' spooky thrills and the ending isn't much of a surprise, but that doesn't really seem to matter because the movie is filled with creepy-good excitement. Carly's good at what she does, and that in itself makes the movie worth watching.This film has been a long time coming, having been filmed during the summer of 2009 and premiered in October 22, 2009. I'm glad it finally made it to DVD. Also appearing in the film are Jillian Murray, Micah Alberti, Brittany Renee Finamore, Sean Wing, Zachary Abel, Bella Thorne, Christopher Atkins and Barbara Bain.

The concept was original, creative, & intriguing. It lacked direction, emotion, & suspense. As others have stated, there were many missed opportunities to scare or thrill us. The first 35 minutes or so of the movie is pointlessly wasted & should have been edited out. To correct another reviewer, I am definitely not a fan of torture/gore movies like ""Saw"". I am from ""The Nightmare on Elm Street"" generation, & I consider ""Halloween"" and ""Scream"" to be two of the greatest horror films ever made. I had hoped that this movie had attempted to incorporate the suspense of ""Halloween"" with a ""Supernatural"" television show storyline. Alas, that was not to be. Though, you do learn a great deal about the characters in general, you don't care about them. The writers/actors placed more emphasis on being attractive/slutty than establishing storylines/scenes that created empathy. Those wishing for a happy ending or a decent conclusion will be left wanting. To be frank, the ending made me mad. I wanted it to be resolved but it wasn't. Instead, you're left with the feeling that you wasted your time for no reason.

You know the ones, long-haired ghosts and dripping with atmosphere? In pretty much every case I've run across, the main thing I took away from the movie was ""Americans should not attempt to make Japanese-style horror movies."" Well, I am glad to say that's finally changed thanks to a little indie horror flick called Forget Me Not. It actually sat on my Netflix queue for quite a while without me watching it simply because I assumed, given the Netflix description, it actually was a remake of an Asian horror movie. It's not, it's an American original, and thanks to a very clever, well-thought-out script and some surprisingly decent acting from a number of the principals, it's one of the better horror films I've seen this month.Plot: eight friends have just graduated from high school: Class president Sandy and her twin brother Eli (Mean Creek's Carly Schroeder and My Dog Skip's Cody Linley), Sandy's boyfriend Jake (American Pie Presents Band Camp's Micah Alberti) and best friend Hannah (Beautiful Wave's Brie Gabrielle), Jake's sister Lex and her boyfriend TJ (The Graves' Jillian Murray and Ten Inch Hero's Sean Wing), and playboy Chad and his girlfriend-of-the-moment Layla (Night Club's Zachary Abel and The Longshots' Chloe Bridges). After a raucous graduation party at TJ's house, they head for the local graveyard to play a game from their childhood: one player is named the ghost, and must catch the others as they hide. Each caught person becomes another ghost, and the last person left hiding is the winner. Just before the game begins, another girl pops up from behind a tombstone and asks if she can play (Things Behind the Sun's Brittany Renee Finnamore). The gang welcome her in, and the game begins. The new girl, Angela, is the winner, but before everyone else gathers, Angela accosts Sandy, asking her if she remembers. She doesn't--and this begins a string of disasters that take more and more malicious turns...It starts off (and sounds) like a typical supernatural slasher movie, but co-writers Oliver and Jamieson Stern came up with some very interesting twists on the genre. As well, they managed to cobble together a half-decent stable of actors, so while the acting in the movie is no great shakes, it's at least competent. The same can be said for most of the technical details--lighting, sound, direction, etc. Competent, but that's really all that's necessary; the script carries this one, and carries it very well.

Most of us, however, didn't take it as far as the chuckleheads in this movie did.  Shallowness of main characters aside, Forget Me Not is still an interesting take on the traditional ghost game.  It is also a body count and revenge flick all rolled into one narrative.  Without throwing in that annoying spoiler, you will also experience an inversion of the traditional protagonist-antagonist motif, as well as varying degrees of altering reality.  All in all, this is a pretty impressive accomplishment for a supposedly B-grade movie.  And now for a quick word on our scary ghosts who were scary, because they didn't appear on the screen for too long a period of time.  Pale and indistinct from the sheer brevity of sight, they hearken back to the childhood time when boogiemen really did seem to exist out of the corner of your eye and you almost always just-but not quite-caught one moving towards you.  In the spirit of this, the most time your mind will ever have to take in one of movie ghosts is one, maybe two seconds.  Is it a perfect movie?  Oh-ho, no.  The acting is never above quasi-believable and the writers obviously spend about as much time creating these believable characters and the film itself did inside the movie theater, if it ever even got that far to begin with.

By the time the story reveals enough of the plot to know what's going on my mood had changed from anticipation to saying ""WTH"" is going here to deciding whether to stop watching or finishing it .If you include all of the petty infighting that goes on between the gang you end up with a huge Excedrine Headach # 199. The acting is pretty much what you would expect from this genre and by that I mean poor to almost ok. It does have some nice looking young people in it for eye candy to help divert attention away from the story and all it's issues.This story revolves around teens so there is a lot of drug use and sexual overtones without the nudity and it's fair share of foul language.I just have to say that I found this movie to be more of an irritant than entertaining because of the stories structure or lack of and the way it's told. Please take a pass on this one unless you enjoy disjointed and convoluted stories. -3 stars",1,I ALREADY FORGOT YOU!!!,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,2042,"['story', 'place', 'group', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'celebrating', 'graduation', 'usual', 'party', 'max', 'followed', 'trip', 'locale', 'cemetery', 'arrive', 'decide', 'play', 'old', 'game', 'hide', 'seek', 'twist', 'origins', 'one', 'lead', 'characters', 'BFF', 'when', 'met', 'played', 'game', 'kids', '10+', 'years', 'earlier', 'Please', 'remember', 'game', 'relevance', 'story', 'only', 'clue', 'i', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'telling', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'you.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'mislead', 'confuse', 'viewer', 'design', 'there', 'problem', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'little', 'late', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'big', 'problem', 'movies', 'choose', 'tell', 'story', 'reverse', 'order', 'FMN', 'when', 'crafted', 'as', 'poorly', 'FMN', 'is.This', 'was', 'just', 'big', 'project', 'director', 'writer', 'effectively', 'produce', 'structured', 'coherent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'story', 'movie', 'ill', 'preparedness', 'lack', 'experience', 'two', 'craftsmen', 'had', 'going', 'project', 'time', 'story', 'reveals', 'enough', 'plot', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'mood', 'had', 'changed', 'anticipation', 'saying', 'WTH', 'going', 'here', 'deciding', 'stop', 'watching', 'finishing', '.If', 'include', 'petty', 'infighting', 'gang', 'end', 'up', 'huge', 'Excedrine', 'Headach', '199', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'genre', 'mean', 'poor', 'almost', 'ok', 'have', 'nice', 'looking', 'young', 'people', 'eye', 'candy', 'help', 'divert', 'attention', 'away', 'story', 'issues.This', 'story', 'revolves', 'teens', 'so', 'lot', 'drug', 'use', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'nudity', 'fair', 'share', 'foul', 'language.I', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'irritant', 'entertaining', 'stories', 'structure', 'lack', 'way', 'told', 'Please', 'take', 'pass', 'one', 'enjoy', 'disjointed', 'convoluted', 'stories', '-3', 'stars']",N/A

The only thing I really liked about the movie was all the HOT chicks they had in it. Also, the ghosts was really scary looking, but the ghosts looked more like zombies if anything.This movie uses the shock factor a lot. They like to use scary sounds into making you jump up, when you see the ghost(s). You know the ghost(s) is about to come out any second now, but you still freak out when you see it because of the sound effects and the appearances.Another thing I liked about the ghost(s) in this movie, is that they do kill in the daytime. Most of the time, when you see ghosts in movies, you don't see them in the day time and/or killing people too. Usually, you're pretty safe in the day time, but not in this movie! lol The only way, you are safe from the ghost(s) is if you're with another person. Of course, most of the casts don't know this until the very end, and by then it's too late. Also, the ghosts show up and move really fast. They don't slowly come at you, but instead run at you.The director of this movie must have really loved watching the Grudge movies because they have the same similar style of showing the ghost(s). In the Grudge, you will always hear a scary sound from the ghost first before you actually see it. It would sound like it's burping way too much gas. Well, in this movie, you hear a scratching noise or a slight banging noise. Then, you will see it.This B rated movie is one of the better B rated movie out there and I do recommend it.",4,Story sucked but plenty of HOT CHICKS,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,1547,"['Minor', 'spoilers', 'saw', 'movie', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'HOT', 'chicks', 'had', 'Also', 'ghosts', 'was', 'really', 'scary', 'looking', 'ghosts', 'looked', 'more', 'zombies', 'anything.This', 'movie', 'shock', 'factor', 'lot', 'like', 'use', 'scary', 'sounds', 'making', 'jump', 'up', 'when', 'see', 'ghost', 's', 'know', 'ghost', 's', 'come', 'out', 'second', 'now', 'still', 'freak', 'out', 'when', 'see', 'sound', 'effects', 'appearances.Another', 'thing', 'liked', 'ghost', 's', 'movie', 'do', 'kill', 'daytime', 'Most', 'time', 'when', 'see', 'ghosts', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'day', 'time', 'and/or', 'killing', 'people', 'too', 'Usually', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'safe', 'day', 'time', 'not', 'movie', 'lol', 'only', 'way', 'are', 'safe', 'ghost', 's', ""'re"", 'person', 'course', 'most', 'casts', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'end', 'then', 'too', 'late', 'Also', 'ghosts', 'show', 'up', 'move', 'really', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'slowly', 'come', 'instead', 'run', 'you.The', 'director', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'loved', 'watching', 'Grudge', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'similar', 'style', 'showing', 'ghost', 's', 'Grudge', 'will', 'always', 'hear', 'scary', 'sound', 'ghost', 'first', 'actually', 'see', 'would', 'sound', 'burping', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'gas', 'Well', 'movie', 'hear', 'scratching', 'noise', 'slight', 'banging', 'noise', 'Then', 'will', 'see', 'it.This', 'B', 'rated', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'B', 'rated', 'movie', 'there', 'do', 'recommend']",N/A

It was an indie release that took almost 2 years to come out on DVD, but it finally did and I couldn't wait to see it. The reason is simple, the amazing young cast. I knew nothing of the writer, director, or story, but I saw that they got every up and coming young star in Hollywood to star in this thing and that alone should have made it a good film. Unfortunately the story is very very simple. It's not a bad movie per say, but it's just nothing different from a thousand other films in the genre.

After a high-school party, a group of friends decide to go to a local graveyard and play a game that involves chanting and bringing back the dead.  After a ghost from her past appears strange things begin to happen to her and her friends.  After all of the low budget horror movies that have been released lately I had low expectations for this one.  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this one.  A pretty original idea mixed with aspects of ""Final Destination"", ""Butterfly Effect"" and ""Gothika"" make it a very fun movie to watch.  I don't want to give the ending away, but not everything is as it seems, or is it?  This is more psychological then horror, but there are some very scary images in this to satisfy most horror fans.  I am not a big fan of the horror genre, but this is one of the better ones I have seen in a long time.  You won't be dissapointed when watching this one.
