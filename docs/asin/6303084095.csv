I was shocked with the old VHS quality of this, there wasn't much effort to clean it up.The second point I have is that only the first 3 hours based on the first book in the series seems focused and comprehensible to me. After that I found myself seeing too many characters that come and go and it not really continuing the story after that, what happened to the baby or the main heroines Indian lover? I think devoting 14 hours to just the first book would have been a better route.I admit I have only watched the first disk so far but I almost completely have lost interest due to all the many forgettable and numerous characters with no real central story, who are these people and will any of this carry into the next episodes? It seems to be some mishmash about Indian independence in general after the first 3 hours.Again I have not watched the whole series so it could be better and based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews it probably will come back to a coherent narrative, but I think they could have cut a lot of the characters and subplots and made this even better or more clearly delineated which novel each saga is based on.",3,"Old VHS quality, unfocused story w/too many characters",1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,1196,"['Yes', 'agree', 'transfer', 'terrible', 'best', 'was', 'shocked', 'old', 'VHS', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'effort', 'clean', 'up.The', 'second', 'point', 'have', 'only', 'first', '3', 'hours', 'based', 'first', 'book', 'series', 'focused', 'comprehensible', 'found', 'seeing', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'come', 'go', 'not', 'really', 'continuing', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'baby', 'main', 'heroines', 'Indian', 'lover', 'think', 'devoting', '14', 'hours', 'just', 'first', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'route.I', 'admit', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'first', 'disk', 'so', 'far', 'almost', 'completely', 'have', 'lost', 'interest', 'due', 'many', 'forgettable', 'numerous', 'characters', 'real', 'central', 'story', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'will', 'carry', 'next', 'episodes', 'be', 'mishmash', 'Indian', 'independence', 'general', 'first', '3', 'hours.Again', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'based', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'probably', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'coherent', 'narrative', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'lot', 'characters', 'subplots', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'more', 'clearly', 'delineated', 'novel', 'saga', 'based']",The Jewel in the Crown - Complete Set VHS

The Jewel in the Crown was highly recommended, but I honestly wasn't enthused about getting a history lesson of the British occupation in India. I'm happy to report, however, that this series had me hooked. Not only was it brilliantly written and acted, but I came away with such respect for Paul Scott, the author of The Raj Quartet on which this series was based. A virtual lifetime of work went into this project, all gained from his experiences in India. There is so much detail, so many interesting, fully developed characters and intriguing, interwining plots, it's absolutely unbelievable how all of it blended so well. After watching 12 hours of these DVD's I had to read all four novels of The Raj Quartet. The DVDs were wonderfully satisfying, but getting more character background from the books was a treat. Like most A&E; & BBC productions, there's always a wealth of remarkably trained British actors in this series. We get to see a very young Charles Dance-who was recently in ""Bleak House"" as the unmerciful Mr. Tulkinghorn. I do have to say though that I was most impressed with Tim Pigot-Smith as Ronald Merrick and Eric Porter as Count Bronowsky. Smith gives a very layered performance of Merrick who is so intensly disturbing. The payoff is finally understanding what makes him tick. This doesn't happen till the end, but all the pieces fall into place. Count Bronowsky is a very interesting character. He seems to be a delightful man and oddly seems to know everything about anybody. I've watched the series in full a few times and each time I hear or see something new from Bronowsky. Fortunately he's played by an actor who doesn't squander the time he's given. After reading the novels and viewing the DVD's I'm glad I finally have a general understanding of the British and Indian experiences during WWII. It's interesting to watch these cultures interact, their general distrust of one another, and how vastly different they can view a single, shared incident. It's heartbreaking, too, to see the damage that was done to India, not only from the War, but the toll British (and some Indian) extravagance had on the land, it's animals, the subjugation of the Indians and it's lasting effects on their government and justice system.P.S. Try and avoid reading Amazon's product description for this DVD series. It reveals way too much of the plot. Also, there's several complaints about the sound & picture quality. True, it's not the quality that that I'm used to, but it didn't interfere with my enjoyment.

355198,A2FS38D943KX12,6303084095,chefdevergue,"[13, 14]","I find it ironic that the beginning of each episode of ""The Jewel in the Crown"" begins with footage from the 1911 Durbar near Delhi.  The 1911 Durbar symbolizes Britain at its imperial apogee, just begin things began to come apart at the seams.  More importantly, the durbars portrayed the British Empire as the British wanted to see it: a benevolent empire, mighty & indestructable, bringing order and civilization with it wherever it went.The reality, of course was much different.  As the British withdrew from the various imperial possessions, they left behind a mixed legacy, and nowhere was this more evident than in India, where the religious antagonism between Hindu & Muslim continues to be felt today, almost 56 years after independence.""The Jewel in the Crown"" follows the final years of the Raj, 1942 to 1947.  The story unfolds at wonderfully relaxed pace, as principal characters enter & depart, to be replaced with other characters.  Some of the important characters, such as Guy Perron, are ones the viewer will not even meet until the 10th episode.The two characters that are the driving force behind the story are Hari Kumar, an Indian given an upper-class public school education in England, and Ronald Merrick, a lower class police officer.  Both are men who simply do not fit in, and are abundantly aware of it.Kumar is an Indian with English sensibilites; he knows nothing of Indian culture and initially can only speak english, but is regard by the British as simply another damned Indian.  He struggles to find his place in an environment where the British expect that all Indians should know their place.Merrick, on the other hand, is a ""grammar-school boy"" (as he constantly reminds people) who has great talent, ability, and ambition.  He moves up through the ranks due to his talents, but knows that he is regarded as not the ""right sort of people"" by the upper-class officers with whom he serves.  It is difficult to know if Merrick has more contempt for the Indians or for the upper class British.As the story moves along, it becomes apparent that the Raj has brought neither the order nor the high morals that the British would have the world believe they represent.  The private lives of the ruling British prove to be just as messy and compromised as the political legacy of the Raj.This is a beautifully acted, spectacularly staged production.  It helps to have some knowledge of Indian history, but even if you don't know much about the Raj, the stories of the various characters are enough to keep you hooked for the whole 750 minutes.",5,The tawdriness of the British Raj,1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,2571,"['find', 'ironic', 'beginning', 'episode', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'footage', '1911', 'Durbar', 'Delhi', '1911', 'Durbar', 'Britain', 'imperial', 'apogee', 'just', 'begin', 'things', 'began', 'come', 'apart', 'seams', 'More', 'importantly', 'durbars', 'portrayed', 'British', 'Empire', 'British', 'wanted', 'see', 'benevolent', 'empire', 'mighty', 'indestructable', 'bringing', 'order', 'civilization', 'went.The', 'reality', 'course', 'was', 'much', 'different', 'British', 'withdrew', 'various', 'imperial', 'possessions', 'left', 'behind', 'mixed', 'legacy', 'nowhere', 'was', 'more', 'evident', 'India', 'where', 'religious', 'antagonism', 'Hindu', 'Muslim', 'be', 'felt', 'today', 'almost', '56', 'years', 'independence', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'final', 'years', 'Raj', '1942', '1947', 'story', 'unfolds', 'wonderfully', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'principal', 'characters', 'enter', 'depart', 'be', 'replaced', 'other', 'characters', 'important', 'characters', 'such', 'Guy', 'Perron', 'are', 'ones', 'viewer', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'meet', '10th', 'episode.The', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'driving', 'force', 'story', 'are', 'Hari', 'Kumar', 'Indian', 'given', 'upper-class', 'public', 'school', 'education', 'England', 'Ronald', 'Merrick', 'lower', 'class', 'police', 'officer', 'are', 'men', 'who', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'are', 'abundantly', 'aware', 'it.Kumar', 'Indian', 'English', 'sensibilites', 'nothing', 'Indian', 'culture', 'initially', 'can', 'only', 'speak', 'english', 'regard', 'British', 'simply', 'damned', 'Indian', 'find', 'place', 'environment', 'where', 'British', 'expect', 'Indians', 'should', 'know', 'place.Merrick', 'other', 'hand', 'grammar-school', 'boy', 'constantly', 'people', 'who', 'great', 'talent', 'ability', 'ambition', 'up', 'ranks', 'due', 'talents', 'regarded', 'not', 'right', 'sort', 'people', 'upper-class', 'officers', 'whom', 'difficult', 'know', 'Merrick', 'more', 'contempt', 'Indians', 'upper', 'class', 'British.As', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'apparent', 'Raj', 'brought', 'neither', 'order', 'high', 'morals', 'British', 'would', 'have', 'world', 'believe', 'represent', 'private', 'lives', 'ruling', 'British', 'prove', 'be', 'just', 'messy', 'compromised', 'political', 'legacy', 'Raj.This', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'spectacularly', 'staged', 'production', 'have', 'knowledge', 'Indian', 'history', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Raj', 'stories', 'various', 'characters', 'are', 'enough', 'keep', 'hooked', 'whole', '750', 'minutes']",The Jewel in the Crown - Complete Set VHS

355201,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6303084095,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[33, 40]","THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN is probably the most powerful and moving film story I have ever seen. THE ENGLISH PATIENT comes close to being my all time favorite, but JITC wins. I am interested in comtemplative psychological studies and Sarah Layton and several of the other characters are very complex people whom the film portrays rather well.JITC pays attention to detail. It is sumptuous like an early Merchant-Ivory film--ROOM WITH A VIEW. The most minute details are important--the silver &quot;Apostle&quot; spoons, the dressing table loaded with costmetics jars, cherry jelly for the blanc mange, hats and dresses and uniforms based on WWII clothing styles, interiors of Rose cottage, bungalows, palaces, railroad cars, and the slum dwellers of large Indian cities.In spite of what appears to be a direct transfer of the original 20-year old print to DVD, the colors and resolution are pretty good. It's rather like listening to an ADD recording. The original filmography was marvelous (a good part of the film must have been shot in India or southeast Asia) though some of the outdoor scenes waver in places owing to the deterioration caused by the affect of light exposure--but never matter, it's still head and shoulders above more recent works. The folks who produced this film loved India and have probably made it as real as it can be for the armchair/time traveler. All we are missing are the smells and the taste of Tandoorii cooking.I have become so accustomed to stream-lined conversations on screen I had forgotten what I was missing. Imagine a scene in a sitting room involving 4-5 women discussing a baby's feeding schedule. The scene is important for what the characters don't say. That's one effect of this film, you realize what people don't say. It's got to do with manners, and being a brick.I think this film will appeal to many people (has appealed to many) but today it would probably be classified as a &quot;woman's film.&quot; JITC had lots of juicy roles for female actresses. For me Sarah Layton is the key figure and through her the film is held together. The actress who played her is virtually unknown, and not especially pretty, but she is beautiful. I came to care very much for Sarah, although she is mindful of her class which can irritate good democrats.Peggy Ascroft is fabulous as Barbie Bachelor, the aging and unwanted missionary. Other actresses you might recognize include Rosmary Leach as Aunt Fenny (the mother in ROOM WITH A VIEW and in PD James COVER HER FACE. Older Mrs Layton, Colonel Layton's  stepmother had her hair filled with flowers in ROOM WITH A VIEW, and many of the male and female actresses show up today in PBS Mysteries and other current BBC productions. Dalziel and Pascoe fans will recogize Rosie the gay corporal. Art Malik who plays Hari Kumar and the actor who plays Jimmy Walker, the fellow who seduces Sarah, have both made recent appearances in SECOND SIGHT on PBS Mystery. If you're an American fan of BBC productions you will recognize many faces although Charles Dance who plays Guy Perron and Tim Piggot-Smith who plays Ronald Merrick may be the only names you recognize other than Dame Peggy Ashcroft.  The fellows who play Indians have shown up as Pakistanis in MY SON THE FANATIC and EAST IS EAST and Rumpole.The story is told from the perspective of the upper class English serving in India.  Along with Hari Kumar who was raised in England, most are connected via their association with a particular school 'Chillingborough&quot; (sp??). You hear the school name mentioned so often, you almost laugh when Merrick (Tim Piggot-Smith) says &quot;Chillingborogh of course&quot; when the issue of school affiliation is raised (he is from the middle-class and did not go to the upper-crust school).There are some scenes involving only Indians, but I think these are so rare and incomplete with few exceptions that you must see them as necessary to futher the plot. I've watched this film twice now, and I know it is very complex. I'm sure it's an allegory along the lines of the Mahahabrata (sp??) and someday I'll figure it out.

Many weeks before the release of the 25th Anniversary Edition, I contacted A&E three times to find out if this were a digitally remastered version of ""Jewel in the Crown."" I got no response to my two e-mails to A&E, and their customer service rep on the phone didn't even know they had a new edition being released.  A&E's previous DVD release in 2001 received many negative reviews because of the poor technical quality of the transfer (e.g., poor sound, light, filmy picture).  I hoped that A&E would have used this opportunity to provide a high quality technical transfer that such a brilliant series deserves.  In the absence of any information from A&E, I ordered the new edition from amazon, but immediately returned it after seeing it had not been remastered.  A few days after I mailed the 25th Anniversary Edition back to amazon, I finally got a letter from A&E confirming the new edition was just a repackaged version with no technical upgrades.  It is greatly disappointing that A&E seems so unfamiliar with its products, that its customer service is so unresponsive, and -- most importantly -- that A&E does not have enough respect for such a classic series to see it gets the technical makeover it deserves.  It would also have been appropriate to have included extras to this anniversary edition, but none were.

Unfortunately the series feels very much like a long-running soap opera with characters coming and going (although in the case of Harry Kumar, jailed for the rape of a British woman, he is never far from the topic of discussion). The style of the program changed throughout the series... in the first few episodes period newsreels were used to introduce topics and characters but this was not the case throughout the rest of the miniseries, with one exception.The only consistency is the character of Ronald Merrick, who becomes a ricardian villain in the series. Everyone seems to know of him but no one knows what he is up to. Plots he weaves, but it is not clear the purpose until near the end.Although not the best thing I've ever watched it is still better than most.

Potential buyers should consider the technical quality to be virtually the same as the 80s production. In other words, if you have it on videotape, there's no reason to buy it. However, the reverse holds true as well: if you don't have it on videotape, and can get a good price (Amazon fluctuates), you're unlikely to be disappointed.I basically wanted a taste of India and it certainly satisfied me in that regard. Granted, the period in question (ca. 1943) is long gone, but this is an affectionate look at Indian culture. Rather bittersweet, as it views through British eyes the end of the British occupation. And the Brits run the gamut, from racist authoritarians to the genuinely interested who realize that India and Indians have a great deal to offer. While the 14 episodes are spun from a Western point of view, to me the philosophical tone is quite Indian.

355217,A1JKKTL7N9K0QA,6303084095,J. Jeffrey Donahue,"[7, 18]","Before I review the story, a few comments about the product.  The transfer is poor, especially when compared to Granada's Sherlock Holmes series, the first set of which was made at about the same time.  The lack of subtitles or closed captioning also leaves a lot to be desired.  Whether you like the story of ""The Jewel in the Crown"" or not, the physical product is quite a bit less than satisfactory.  For a DVD in 2011, a decent transfer and audio/subtitle options are mandatory.As far as the story goes, I did not like it one bit.  Even though I have not read the books, I am left with the impression that quite a bit of the story in the novels must have been left out to comply with the time requirements for the series.  It comes across as disjointed and difficult to follow.  Possibly inept directing or editing are to blame, but I think it is most likely a poor screenplay.  I am assuming that the quality of the novels is good when I say that; it is unfortunate that there is not more meat in the video series.  The story as presented comes across mostly as discussion of who is having sex with whom, in or out of wedlock and with indiference to the gender of the sex partner.  I strongly suspect that while the novels may have touched on the various aspects of sexuality as it relates to the clash of cultures, it must have done so in a much more sophisticated and less banal manner.  The soundtrack of mostly Indian music is excellent, and the Indian locations are most interesting.  If the story had been even a little better the video series would at least be watchable, but as it is you can skip it as you are not missing anything unless you like soap operas.

355218,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,6303084095,J. Martin,"[14, 15]","I don't understand the reviews that savage the video and sound quality. This is a relatively low-budget 1980s TV series, not a 21st century $200 million blockbuster. It looks and sounds just fine for what it is. I can sympathize slightly with the numerous requests for subtitles, but I'm a relatively provincial American myself, and I was able to understand every word with occasional quick rewinds.I was primarily interested in finding out what the real difference is between the two releases that are available, from2001and2008, since (as of 8/24/2009) one costs more than twice as much as the other, and Amazon gives different run-times for them, by a significant 28 minutes. So before buying either, I borrowed both versions from the library and watched them side-by-side. The answer is that--as others have said--the two versions are identical in every detail, except the artwork on the box and the design of the DVD labels. Nothing else was changed at all.It's not perfect, but I enjoyed The Jewel in the Crown when it was first broadcast, and I enjoyed it again this time. Other people have different reactions to it, and I suppose anything that gets a lot of praise will automatically attract a few harsh critics.

But the story is so compelling, the acting so superb and the entire production so glorious, I managed to suppress my annoyance during passages where it was hard to understand the dialog.  This was particularly the case in the many scenes where the women are having gossipy little chats, mumbling away to the point of almost incoherence.  Other reviewers here have also complained about the quality of the video, and I agree it isn't quite 3-D, but again, even though the picture quality, after 30 years, isn't as good as one would have hoped, the photography is well done and the scenery is still lovely.I found the whole production so engrossing, in fact, that I decided to compensate for the poor quality of the audio (and no closed caption option) by sending off to Amazon for the four books that make up the Raj Quartet which I am in the processing of finishing now.  I'm glad I saw the TV production first (again, actually, having watched it on Masterpiece Theatre in the mid-80s).  The film follows the books exactly, though the books add a little more depth and detail, but having seen the dramatized version of the story made it easy to visualize the characters encountered in the written version.I highly recommend The Jewel in the Crown.

Highly acclaimed, it won numerous awards. Beautifully filmed on location in India, England, and Wales, it is a highly atmospheric and complex drama, redolent of the flavor of the turbulent years just before India gained its independence from British rule.The story begins in 1942, and through its memorable characters, both British and Indian, it masterfully weaves a tapestry of events that explains the state of flux that India was in at the time and the collision between East and West that often occurred, as the old guard made way for the new. Pivotal events become symbolic of India's struggle for independence, and it is those events that impact on those living in India and struggling to survive through those turbulent years. This tumultuous and sumptuous saga ends with India's independence in 1947.Masterfully acted, lushly filmed, and awash with period detail, it is so atmospheric as to make its viewers feel that they themselves are there during the decline and fall of the British Raj. It captures the essence of India and its ramparts of colonialism. Interspersed throughout the episodes are snippets of old newsreels that recount India's involvement in World War II and the threat of Japanese invasion through adjacent Burma. These serve to further move the story along and imbue it with an air of authenticity that stays with the viewer.This multi-faceted series, based upon Paul Scott's literary gem, &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot;, is a fine adaptation that should not be missed. The award calibre performances by the entire cast are stellar and will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. Those interested in period pieces, historical dramas, and epics on Indian colonialism will love this series, as will anyone interested in a superlative drama. Bravo!The quality of this four disc DVD box set is pretty good. The visuals are better than expected for what appears to be a direct transfer from the original print. The colors for the most part are still vivid and the audio is crystal clear. All in all, this transfer to DVD has fared pretty well. It is a DVD set well worth having in one's collection.

Although this series first aired in 1984, this multi-layered story about life in India during the 40's continues to pack a powerful and complex dramatization about inter-racial relationships, social and cultural prejudice, classicism, bigotry, hypocrisy, and the effect of imperialism of the British Raj on India, its princely states, and its people.This ambitious epic tackles intricate details about the lives and customs of the ruling high caste Hindu class, and the British who ultimately control and rule their country.  Yet, accurately interwoven is the story about the political mood of India; clashes between Hindu and Muslim, strife between the militant rebels and the followers of Gandhi at the height of India's struggle for self-rule and independence.Equally compelling, THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN is also a story about the idiosyncrasies and fallibility of human nature; expertly portrayed by a cast of exception actors: lust for power, hedonism/sadism, vanity, narcissism, deception, cruelty and envy, but also honor and loyalty.  The host of characters are unforgettable, and you will long remember the interrelationships of the many individuals who emerge as heroes/heroines, conspirators, villains, martyrs, and the 'righteous'.This DVD mini-series includes four disks, and the quality was very good.If you are a fan of classic PBS mini-series, I urge you to include this DVD box set in your collection.Maizie Lucille JamesJuly 11, 2010",5,India Drama During English Rule,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,1587,"['classic', 'installments', 'aired', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'past', '25', 'years', 'JEWEL', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWN', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'first', 'aired', '1984', 'multi-layered', 'story', 'life', 'India', '40', 'pack', 'powerful', 'complex', 'dramatization', 'inter-racial', 'relationships', 'social', 'cultural', 'prejudice', 'classicism', 'bigotry', 'hypocrisy', 'effect', 'imperialism', 'British', 'Raj', 'India', 'princely', 'states', 'people.This', 'ambitious', 'epic', 'tackles', 'intricate', 'details', 'lives', 'customs', 'ruling', 'high', 'caste', 'Hindu', 'class', 'British', 'who', 'ultimately', 'control', 'rule', 'country', 'accurately', 'interwoven', 'story', 'political', 'mood', 'India', 'clashes', 'Hindu', 'Muslim', 'strife', 'militant', 'rebels', 'followers', 'Gandhi', 'height', 'India', 'struggle', 'self-rule', 'independence.Equally', 'compelling', 'THE', 'JEWEL', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWN', 'also', 'story', 'idiosyncrasies', 'fallibility', 'human', 'nature', 'expertly', 'portrayed', 'cast', 'exception', 'actors', 'lust', 'power', 'hedonism/sadism', 'vanity', 'narcissism', 'deception', 'cruelty', 'envy', 'also', 'honor', 'loyalty', 'host', 'characters', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'will', 'long', 'remember', 'interrelationships', 'many', 'individuals', 'who', 'emerge', 'heroes/heroines', 'conspirators', 'villains', 'martyrs', ""'righteous'.This"", 'DVD', 'mini-series', 'four', 'disks', 'quality', 'was', 'very', 'good.If', 'are', 'fan', 'classic', 'PBS', 'mini-series', 'urge', 'include', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'collection.Maizie', 'Lucille', 'JamesJuly', '11', '2010']",The Jewel in the Crown - Complete Set VHS

355238,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,6303084095,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[7, 7]","Here we have a 1984 Granada [British] mini-series rendered over a span of fourteen episodes on four DVD discs. The set comes packaged in two cases with an outer slipcover to contain them -- the total running time is 12 hours and 40 minutes. The first entry excepted (which is much longer) each episode runs for 51 minutes.Other than brief and intermittent archival footage, all the episodes are presented in color, filmed on location in England, Wales, but chiefly in India. The series directors were Christopher Morahan and Jim O'Brien. Ken Taylor adapted the story from Paul Scott's original novel,Raj Quartet. The filmscore (a terrific one) was composed by George Fenton.This is a dramatic account detailing the lives of Colonial British military officers and the indigenous people of India during the waning years of British rule, (before, during, and following World War II.) The underlying theme of British concern over a prospective Japanese invasion of India blossoms as the tale progresses.More specifically, this production hones in on the lives of a shady British policeman, (who later transfers to the military as an officer); a naive young English lady to whom the policeman is much attracted; a native Indian who was reared and schooled in elite English society, now returned to his homeland where he feels much disenfranchised; a British intelligence officer (artfully played by Charles Dance:Gosford Park), sent in to investigate the nefarious policeman; and many subsidiary characters (including the delightful Peter Jeffrey:Midnight Express), all of whom nicely support the roles of the primary characters.An English gal of twenty-some, a daughter of nobility who wishes to make herself useful in India, begins work as a nurse in an Indian hospital. She soon comes to the notice of two men, each of whom is interested in her attentions, a policeman and a highly-educated Indian who works as a reporter. It's not long before the two men clash and the Indian finds himself in no position to fend off his officious adversary. The fact that the girl soon falls in love with him only escalates his difficulties with the British authorities and with his policeman rival in particular.This introductory tableau which launches the chronicle and tragic events, both personal and national, effectively punctuate this saga, continuing to drive it in a serpentine manner to its historic conclusion. But the transition to the independence of India is definitely the wallpaper to the greater melodrama of the lives of the primary characters, both Indian and British. Additional subplots have been nicely worked into the script such as the running conflict between certain Muslim and Hindu factions.The style of screenwriting and directing is copiously refreshing -- often an event is initially conveyed and the backstory follows, a storytelling technique well known to fans of William Faulkner (Snopes: The Hamlet, The Town, The Mansion (Modern Library)) and a few other authors of note. The cinematography is terrific as are the numerous sets and locations.Still, some will find this mini-series, to be candid, boring. For me, though, the viewing experience was quite the reverse. I don't need fast-paced action scenes, stacked one following another Hollywood-style, in order to digest an enthralling historical yarn. The theme here is generally anti-action, punctuated by a roller-coater approach to injecting events into the tale at unanticipated intervals. Think of this saga chiefly as a pure novel of life rather than as an historical period presentation. My personal experience manifested a nice balance between the romance, the (class, racial, and religious) interactions between the characters, and a fascinating historical setting, all positioned within an exotic eastern realm.As to the specific quality of the DVD presentation, this isn't high-definition by any means but it's infinitely watchable and I am wholly satisfied on that front.Highly recommended for enthusiasts of either British drama or the history of India.",5,Not everyone will love this mini-series... but I certainly did (details),1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,4037,"['Here', 'have', '1984', 'Granada', '[', 'British', ']', 'mini-series', 'rendered', 'span', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'four', 'DVD', 'discs', 'set', 'packaged', 'two', 'cases', 'outer', 'slipcover', 'contain', 'total', 'running', 'time', '12', 'hours', '40', 'minutes', 'first', 'entry', 'excepted', 'much', 'longer', 'episode', '51', 'minutes.Other', 'brief', 'intermittent', 'archival', 'footage', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'color', 'filmed', 'location', 'England', 'Wales', 'chiefly', 'India', 'series', 'directors', 'were', 'Christopher', 'Morahan', 'Jim', ""O'Brien"", 'Ken', 'Taylor', 'adapted', 'story', 'Paul', 'Scott', 'original', 'novel', 'Raj', 'Quartet', 'filmscore', 'terrific', 'one', 'was', 'composed', 'George', 'Fenton.This', 'dramatic', 'account', 'detailing', 'lives', 'Colonial', 'British', 'military', 'officers', 'indigenous', 'people', 'India', 'waning', 'years', 'British', 'rule', 'following', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'underlying', 'theme', 'British', 'concern', 'prospective', 'Japanese', 'invasion', 'India', 'blossoms', 'tale', 'progresses.More', 'specifically', 'production', 'lives', 'shady', 'British', 'policeman', 'who', 'later', 'transfers', 'military', 'officer', 'naive', 'young', 'English', 'lady', 'whom', 'policeman', 'much', 'attracted', 'native', 'Indian', 'who', 'was', 'reared', 'schooled', 'elite', 'English', 'society', 'now', 'returned', 'homeland', 'where', 'much', 'disenfranchised', 'British', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'artfully', 'played', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'sent', 'investigate', 'nefarious', 'policeman', 'many', 'subsidiary', 'characters', 'including', 'delightful', 'Peter', 'Jeffrey', 'Midnight', 'Express', 'whom', 'nicely', 'support', 'roles', 'primary', 'characters.An', 'English', 'gal', 'twenty-some', 'daughter', 'nobility', 'who', 'make', 'useful', 'India', 'work', 'nurse', 'Indian', 'hospital', 'soon', 'notice', 'two', 'men', 'whom', 'interested', 'attentions', 'policeman', 'highly-educated', 'Indian', 'who', 'reporter', 'not', 'long', 'two', 'men', 'clash', 'Indian', 'position', 'fend', 'off', 'officious', 'adversary', 'fact', 'girl', 'soon', 'love', 'only', 'difficulties', 'British', 'authorities', 'policeman', 'rival', 'particular.This', 'introductory', 'tableau', 'chronicle', 'tragic', 'events', 'personal', 'national', 'effectively', 'punctuate', 'saga', 'continuing', 'drive', 'serpentine', 'manner', 'historic', 'conclusion', 'transition', 'independence', 'India', 'definitely', 'wallpaper', 'greater', 'melodrama', 'lives', 'primary', 'characters', 'Indian', 'British', 'Additional', 'subplots', 'have', 'been', 'nicely', 'worked', 'script', 'such', 'running', 'conflict', 'certain', 'Muslim', 'Hindu', 'factions.The', 'style', 'screenwriting', 'directing', 'copiously', 'refreshing', 'often', 'event', 'initially', 'conveyed', 'backstory', 'storytelling', 'technique', 'well', 'known', 'fans', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'Snopes', 'Hamlet', 'Town', 'Mansion', 'Modern', 'Library', 'few', 'other', 'authors', 'note', 'cinematography', 'terrific', 'are', 'numerous', 'sets', 'locations.Still', 'will', 'find', 'mini-series', 'be', 'candid', 'boring', 'though', 'viewing', 'experience', 'was', 'quite', 'reverse', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'scenes', 'stacked', 'one', 'following', 'Hollywood-style', 'order', 'digest', 'enthralling', 'historical', 'yarn', 'theme', 'here', 'generally', 'anti-action', 'punctuated', 'roller-coater', 'approach', 'injecting', 'events', 'tale', 'unanticipated', 'intervals', 'Think', 'saga', 'chiefly', 'pure', 'novel', 'life', 'rather', 'historical', 'period', 'presentation', 'personal', 'experience', 'manifested', 'nice', 'balance', 'romance', 'class', 'racial', 'religious', 'interactions', 'characters', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'setting', 'positioned', 'exotic', 'eastern', 'realm.As', 'specific', 'quality', 'DVD', 'presentation', ""n't"", 'high-definition', 'means', 'infinitely', 'watchable', 'am', 'wholly', 'satisfied', 'front.Highly', 'recommended', 'enthusiasts', 'British', 'drama', 'history', 'India']",The Jewel in the Crown - Complete Set VHS

355240,A2M4SPLZR918MD,6303084095,Renee V. Cox,"[16, 19]","For me, watching an entire series by myself, The Jewel in the Crown,  based on The Raj Quartet by Paul Scott, was  a guilty pleasure.  Pleasure because it was excellent in the tradition of the best of British, and guilty because it filled the greater part of eight videocassettes, for a total of 750 minutes.  I felt slightly less decadent than I might have  because I watched it on library copies.The story invokes the tumultuous last days of the British raj in India.  Although it is perceived from a British point of view, it is sympathetic for the most part to the aspirations of the various sects making up the hodgepodge of peoples populating the Indian nation, and the plot emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.The  white British citizens during the dying days of the British empire hold a love-hate relationship with India.  The English pine for England while being alternately enchanted by the culture or repelled by the teeming squalor of this turbulent emerging nation.The fact that India on its own was a closed society may explain her historical acquiescence to British rule.  There was a rigid caste system in India, and since the highest ranking maharajahs looked up to the paler-skinned colonists, therefore the rest of India must too. Some of the characters on both sides could be considered a bit archetypal were it not for their fleshing out and convincing portrayal by an exceptional cast of actors.  We can only feel sympathy for a handsome, intelligent man like Hari Kumar who is at home neither among the English he was brought up with nor his fellow Indians. At the beginning, he does not even speak Hindi.  His is the heart of a dilemma common to &quot;colonial&quot; countries.And the struggle which pits groups against each other, such as Hindu against Moslem, is a distillation of the diversity of the peoples in India.  Today, the only common language of India is English, and it is therefore its official one, an ironic postscript to the rule of the Raj.Throughout the series, compelling footage of old British newsreels is shown.  It threads the episodes together while highlighting the pomposity (pretensions that are surprisingly poignant)  on both sides of the former regime.",5,A stirring glimpse into the last days of the Raj,1007769600,"12 8, 2001",2001,2226,"['watching', 'entire', 'series', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'based', 'Raj', 'Quartet', 'Paul', 'Scott', 'was', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Pleasure', 'was', 'excellent', 'tradition', 'best', 'British', 'guilty', 'filled', 'greater', 'part', 'eight', 'videocassettes', 'total', '750', 'minutes', 'felt', 'slightly', 'less', 'decadent', 'might', 'have', 'watched', 'library', 'copies.The', 'story', 'tumultuous', 'last', 'days', 'British', 'raj', 'India', 'perceived', 'British', 'point', 'view', 'sympathetic', 'most', 'part', 'aspirations', 'various', 'sects', 'making', 'up', 'hodgepodge', 'peoples', 'populating', 'Indian', 'nation', 'plot', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'sides.The', 'white', 'British', 'citizens', 'dying', 'days', 'British', 'empire', 'hold', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'India', 'English', 'pine', 'England', 'being', 'alternately', 'enchanted', 'culture', 'repelled', 'teeming', 'squalor', 'turbulent', 'emerging', 'nation.The', 'fact', 'India', 'own', 'was', 'closed', 'society', 'may', 'explain', 'historical', 'acquiescence', 'British', 'rule', 'was', 'rigid', 'caste', 'system', 'India', 'highest', 'ranking', 'maharajahs', 'looked', 'up', 'paler-skinned', 'colonists', 'rest', 'India', 'must', 'too', 'characters', 'sides', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'bit', 'archetypal', 'were', 'not', 'fleshing', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'actors', 'can', 'only', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'handsome', 'intelligent', 'man', 'Hari', 'Kumar', 'who', 'home', 'English', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'fellow', 'Indians', 'beginning', 'not', 'even', 'speak', 'Hindi', 'heart', 'dilemma', 'common', 'quot', 'colonial', 'quot', 'struggle', 'groups', 'other', 'such', 'Hindu', 'Moslem', 'distillation', 'diversity', 'peoples', 'India', 'Today', 'only', 'common', 'language', 'India', 'English', 'therefore', 'official', 'one', 'ironic', 'postscript', 'rule', 'Raj.Throughout', 'series', 'compelling', 'footage', 'old', 'British', 'newsreels', 'shown', 'episodes', 'together', 'highlighting', 'pomposity', 'pretensions', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'poignant', 'sides', 'former', 'regime']",The Jewel in the Crown - Complete Set VHS

355246,A912C7977MO6O,6303084095,Smallchief,"[12, 14]","I have read ""The Raj Quartet"" (i.e. ""Jewel in the Crown) twice -- all 2,000 pages of it -- and I love the story.  The novel and this DVD paint a fascinating and exhaustive look of the English in the last days of their rule of India.The story is circular.  It centers around the rape of an English girl in the Biribigar gardens in 1942. Seen through the lens of that event we go on to a picture of the British in India during World War II, the growing movement toward independence, and finally the consequences of Muslim-Hindu animosity aroused by independence.  Most of the cast is superb and the number of characters is enormous: a tortured, lower-class policeman of chilling efficiency, a sensible English girl with a malevolent mother and a madly incompetent sister, several admirable but ineffective missionaries, befuddled soldiers, a Cambridge scholar, a demented but appealing Russian political advisor, Muslim and Indian politicians, and Hari Kumar -- the Indian boy who was English at heart and served as the scapegoat for all the English failings in India.It's long, slow-moving, majestic, educational, sometimes a bit unlikely, inconclusive, but compelling -- a soap opera in the exotic and explosive setting of the British Raj. There are elements of Kipling here, and ""Passage to India"" and Mother Teresa -- a whole melange of not-so-original ideas and scenes.  But nobody has ever taken such a meticulously close look at British India in its death throes as has author Paul Scott in the novel and this DVD.""The Raj Quartet"" in my opinion is one of the very greatest novels of the 20th century and ""Jewel in the Crown"" one of the very greatest of television dramas.  That being said neither the color nor the sound of this DVD is of even average quality.

355248,ARB6LPEBP0VXT,6303084095,Stephen P. Manning,"[0, 3]","Watching yet again one of my favorite film series, The Jewel in the Crown. From my reactionary vantage point, however, I am seeing the Good Guys and the Bad Guys are somewhat different from what I thought from viewings in years past.WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!When I first watched Jewel In The Crown, I thought Daphne Manners noble, if a bit unrealistic. Now I see her, in her righteous and blind naivete, preferring her grand illusions to grubby reality, as the cause of a lot of serious misery for other people.To me, she is another Eve, the true villain of the piece (not Ronald Merrick), a female whose unbridled curiosity, desire and blindness (signified by her physical myopia and thick glasses) lead her to cross a boundary set up for her own good. Disaster ensues because of her moral arrogance.And then she relies on her English feminine privilege to be indulged and cast as the victim, all the while holding poor stupid Hari to his promise of silence. She is, in my current view, completely contemptible: the face of evil staring out from that homely English girl's mug.Her Indian ""auntie"" has it right: ""I used to be afraid for you. Now I am afraid for all of us, because of you. You don't shrink from anything, even your mistakes, your mahh-rvelous mistakes. You're like Pandora, who bashed off to the attic and opened her blasted box.""And Sarah Layton, a much more competent and impressive woman, shares some of her highmindedly foolish ideas, --she blames not Ghandi but the British for the Hindu-Muslim violence and death at independence--without her reckless and selfish imprudence.The obvious villain of the piece, Ronald Merrick, the man we are set up to hate, it now seems to me, despite his flaws of character --and they are not minor ones-- sees reality and acts on it in ways that people like Daphne and Sarah despise, but on which they have actually always depended.And the Barbie Batchelor character, the unstable hapless nosy meddling and feckless spinster missionary played by Peggie Ashcroft, is an excellent argument for Nietzsche being right about Christianity. God, what an annoying and clingy woman.Two newish reflections in response to Paul Scott's anti-colonial project. The film, at least, acts as if the British were the first and only invaders and colonizers of India. As if the Mughals simply arrived by chance, like the Pilgrims...and all those Muslims just sprouted like mushrooms after a rain. Hindus will tell you different.  The Muslim invasions of India were hugely blood, violent and oppressive; the Brits, by comparison, were Quakers. And secondly, if you are going to be a colonial power, do it, but don't fall for your own highminded PR. One thing I have learned from the execrable and ungrateful Reb Saul Alinsky: never embrace a principle that can be used against you.",5,Pandora and Eve in an English face,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,2817,"['Watching', 'yet', 'again', 'one', 'favorite', 'film', 'series', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'reactionary', 'vantage', 'point', 'however', 'am', 'seeing', 'Good', 'Guys', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'are', 'somewhat', 'different', 'what', 'thought', 'viewings', 'years', 'past.WARNING', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'thought', 'Daphne', 'Manners', 'noble', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'Now', 'see', 'righteous', 'blind', 'naivete', 'preferring', 'grand', 'illusions', 'grubby', 'reality', 'cause', 'lot', 'serious', 'misery', 'other', 'people.To', 'Eve', 'true', 'villain', 'piece', 'not', 'Ronald', 'Merrick', 'female', 'unbridled', 'curiosity', 'desire', 'blindness', 'signified', 'physical', 'myopia', 'thick', 'glasses', 'lead', 'cross', 'boundary', 'set', 'up', 'own', 'good', 'Disaster', 'ensues', 'moral', 'arrogance.And', 'then', 'English', 'feminine', 'privilege', 'be', 'indulged', 'cast', 'victim', 'holding', 'poor', 'stupid', 'Hari', 'promise', 'silence', 'current', 'view', 'completely', 'contemptible', 'face', 'evil', 'staring', 'out', 'homely', 'English', 'girl', 'mug.Her', 'Indian', 'auntie', 'right', 'used', 'be', 'afraid', 'Now', 'am', 'afraid', 'do', ""n't"", 'shrink', 'anything', 'even', 'mistakes', 'mahh-rvelous', 'mistakes', ""'re"", 'Pandora', 'who', 'bashed', 'off', 'attic', 'opened', 'blasted', 'box', 'Sarah', 'Layton', 'much', 'more', 'competent', 'impressive', 'woman', 'shares', 'highmindedly', 'foolish', 'ideas', 'not', 'Ghandi', 'British', 'Hindu-Muslim', 'violence', 'death', 'independence', 'reckless', 'selfish', 'imprudence.The', 'obvious', 'villain', 'piece', 'Ronald', 'Merrick', 'man', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'hate', 'now', 'flaws', 'character', 'are', 'not', 'minor', 'ones', 'reality', 'ways', 'people', 'Daphne', 'Sarah', 'despise', 'have', 'actually', 'always', 'depended.And', 'Barbie', 'Batchelor', 'character', 'unstable', 'hapless', 'nosy', 'meddling', 'feckless', 'spinster', 'missionary', 'played', 'Peggie', 'Ashcroft', 'excellent', 'argument', 'Nietzsche', 'being', 'right', 'Christianity', 'God', 'what', 'annoying', 'clingy', 'woman.Two', 'newish', 'reflections', 'response', 'Paul', 'Scott', 'anti-colonial', 'project', 'film', 'least', 'British', 'were', 'first', 'only', 'invaders', 'colonizers', 'India', 'Mughals', 'simply', 'arrived', 'chance', 'Pilgrims', 'Muslims', 'just', 'sprouted', 'mushrooms', 'rain', 'Hindus', 'will', 'tell', 'different', 'Muslim', 'invasions', 'India', 'were', 'hugely', 'blood', 'violent', 'oppressive', 'Brits', 'comparison', 'were', 'Quakers', 'secondly', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'colonial', 'power', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'own', 'highminded', 'PR', 'One', 'thing', 'have', 'learned', 'execrable', 'ungrateful', 'Reb', 'Saul', 'Alinsky', 'never', 'embrace', 'principle', 'can', 'be', 'used']",The Jewel in the Crown - Complete Set VHS
