I liked it so much that when I finished watching it I immediately hit play again and have watched it about 3 more times since!  I like the way they wove a plot around all the songs.  It was much more than just a concert...it was like watching a musical.  From the opening number A New Day Dawning to Mo Ghile Mar and everything in between it was great.  The girl who did The Highwayman and Harry's Game had such a beautiful voice as did the girl who sang and danced to Shadow Dancing.  Loved Ryan's Midnight Well (previously on their Take Me Home CD) and Keith's Stand and Deliver.  Keith and Damian were great together on Look at Me.

I watched this 'new' one last night and quit halfway through.  The songs are 'pedestrian' and mostly unmemorable.  I did finish watching it tonight but had no spark of excitement as with THE SHOW DVD so I am returning the CD unopened.  I did enjoy the female singers and dancing but it was not the reason I bought the DVD.  This show had no closeups of the singers as they sang so I felt no interaction with them.  I did discover there were other DVDs I had not known about so I will see if I can rent them first before I spend any more money on something I will not watch again.

Not so with this DVD...theatrics are NOT their forte and I'm a firm believer in doing what one does best. They don't need the bells and whistles...they need to be themselves and do what they do best...let us escape for an hour looking at their wonderful faces and listening to their incredible voices. I don't know why the females were introduced into the mix to the degree that they were. They are wonderful singers and, needless to say, lovely to look at, but they aren't ""Thunder"". Please, bring these gentlemen back to their roots and their former grandeur and leave the gypsies wandering through their own travels. This is one DVD that I will probably not watch again...although the older ones can frequently be seen on my TV. I would also like to see them come back to their roots a bit more; the Celtic influence was all but lost this time around. They have new singers who don't appear in this DVD (except for a very brief appearance by Neil Byrne, who is an excellent singer and musician), although I guess it will be last DVD with the original performers, whose loss we mourn. I hope the new singers will not be subjected to the humiliation that these gentlemen were in their last performance together. It was a sad farewell.

The sets, the showmanship, the period clothing all were good, and nothing can take away from the pure talent of Celtic Thunder.  However, I agree 100% with the first reviewer that having female vocalists in a Celtic Thunder show takes something away from it.  Dancers are all right.  I thoroughly enjoyed the go-go dancers in Keith's ""Surfing"" number in the Entertainment DVD, and even liked the Just Like Jesse James number.  But I did not enjoy the musical presentations by the women in Storm.As far as the songs are concerned, I did not recognize any of them, and found none of them memorable.  I thought it might be because they are Irish songs and I'm in the U.S., but I have most of C.T.'s DVDs and these songs just were not up to their usual standards.I might add, however, that now and then entertainers do try something different than their signature performances.  I am, and have been for a long time, a Josh Groban fan, but his last CD, ""Illuminations"" is, in my view, a complete disaster.

1455311,A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ,B005DETYW8,Peter Tsang,"[6, 7]","""Celtic Thunder: Storm"" is actually a bit different from other Celtic performances that I have seen.  The whole show on the DVD is presented as a sort of a musical story/drama.  There's no dialogue, only singing and stylized dancing, fighting, romances, and other scenes.  All 16 songs are contained within the framework of this musical story/drama.At first, you may not be used to this style and may not like it.  I personally found the show interesting, sort of like watching a live action musical, with a twist of mixing legend and history.Spoiler Alert: Stop and don't read any further if you don't want know anymore.**********************************************************************************************************************************************************Here's the story.  Invaders attack and rob a village and their treasure chest.  There's tussling and fighting as the villagers repel the group of invaders.The set has domiciles and a large crumbling wall.  There's a bridge and trees.  People, both men and women, wear vaguely native/traditional/historical clothes or costumes which may be loosely identified as Celtic/British/Gypsy.Both the men and the women sing.  In the romance area, there is ""tension"" and certain scenes which most people are comfortable with and some may be less so comfortable.Everyone stays within his or her character.Here is a list of the major characters.George Donaldson:  The Head VillagerRyan Kelly: The Gypsy KingKeith Harkin:  The HighwaymanDamian McGuinty: The Young BuckDeirdre Shannon:  The GentlewomanPaul Byrom: The Landowner's SonRuth O'Leary:  The Chief's DaughterCaroline Torti:  The Gypsy King's SisterThe ninth song, Lagan Love, is done well, with parts contributed by a few of the men.

1455312,A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,B005DETYW8,PhotoGraphics,"[72, 76]","I have more mixed feeling about Storm than any previous CD/DVD from them. If you haven't watched the DVD yet please consider this a spoiler alert.I have to preface this by saying I became a fan of Celtic Thunder in their very first days as a group and have been a fan ever since. I own all of their DVD's, most of their CD's and have been (and will continue going to) their live shows. I embrace the changes they have made as original members of the group have left, others have moved forward as frontmen, and positions have changed. So please don't read between the lines of this review and suspect for even a moment that I do not like them ... before or after their metamorphosis.Storm is different from previous shows in many ways in that it is musical theater with the performers playing costumed roles rather than concert performances. With that in mind, here is my take on what I loved and what left me wanting:PROS:While I really like the way in previous albums how Celtic Thunder takes contemporary classics and covers them, let's face it, a lot of good bands can do that. That plays well in the U.S. where those songs were popular but I and other fans also like when they perform more unique and ""traditional"" Gaelic standards. Isn't the reason we seek world music to expand our horizons, not to listen to an Irish band sing American songs from the 1950's? In Storm there are no contemporary covers, the show is primarily new songs written by Phil Coulter, with a couple of old Irish classics. Of all of the tracks included I only was familiar with two. And that is awesome!!!  This was a big plus for Storm although it may be difficult to accept for fans who expected more covers and Gaelic music.The beautiful set was much more elaborate and story telling than most of their DVD's. It was easy to imagine being in an Irish village of olde and the cast members being part of a living history.I liked that the production seemed to be more seamless than most concerts, with all of the songs interwoven into a grand overall story.CONS:I have four:1. The last PRO I mentioned was offset by the occasional cutaways to the audience during the production.  Yes, we get it that it was taped before a live audience, but there is an old rule in theater that performers shouldn't break character, and by cutting away to a 2009 audience that is exactly what the editors did. It ruined the mood of being in another time / another place. Cutaways work well for shows that are obviously live concerts, but not well at all for shows in which the viewer is asked to follow a theatrical story line.2. I understand that Sharon Browne also produces Celtic Women.  That's fine.  I have no problem with the beautiful women who perform and dance during Celtic Thunder shows.  It is right and it is natural.  But to give them singing roles in a Celtic Thunder show?  Wrong! It is so out of place and it diminishes the band as a whole. I mean, what if one of the guys suddenly walked on stage at a Celtic Women show and took over the stage? This was a bad judgment on the producers' part, plain and simple.3. I know that the talented Neil Byrne was not yet a frontman in 2009 when Storm was taped, BUT the producers of the DVD that was released in September of 2011 took great pains to prominently feature his image on the DVD, yet they included only about 10 seconds of his magnificent voice in the final edit.  This is a major omission. If they feature his photo on the cover as part of the cast he should have more featured time in the show. They must have taped more footage of him in the original concert and now that he is a frontman they should have edited more of him in the Storm DVD. He is 100% part of the show now, and should have been included in a 2011 DVD release.4. The show seems much too short, or maybe a better way of putting it, it seems to end too soon. It built well, with the old man (George) playing against the young buck (Damian) and the sexually active tension of the young men in-between and then we were presented with the glorious moments of internal conflict during the number Mo Ghile Mear""Every day I'm constantly enduring grief, Weeping bitterly and shedding tears, Because my lively lad has left me, And no news is told of him - alas"".And the viewer expects to see where it all leads. And surprisingly it leads to the Storm show ending and the performers taking bows. There is something more to be told, did the production run out of ideas? It left me hanging.Final comment.  Most DVD's include backstage interviews, outtakes, behind the scenes views, etc in the ""bonus"" section.  This DVD had a couple of minutes of still slides from the performance, a 20 second TV commercial and a 30 second TV commercial.  That's all.While I still think Celtic Thunder is one of the best current acts worldwide and nothing in this review takes away from the performers' talents, I can't help but think Sharon Browne went cheap on this production. I am sorry to give Storm only 4 stars. It's little details that indicate the producers cut corners, oh like spelling Damian's name ""Damien"" on the DVD jacket ... really?If you like them as a group please don't let this review discourage you, it's still worth watching.  But bottom line is Storm is not their shining moment. They have better days ahead.[UPDATE 10/28/11]I attended Celtic Thunder's live fall tour show at Humphreys Concerts By The Bay in San Diego on Oct 25.  I had previously seen them only in the large downtown auditorium venues.  What an amazing difference.  Firstly, the lads exuberant personalities are difficult to appreciate when you are sitting in Row 200 in a gilded auditorium filled with red velvet seats.  Seeing them outdoors surrounded by San Diego Bay under the stars was magical.  It is a small venue with folding plastic chairs on the lawn and the furthest seat would be considered Orchestra in many auditoriums.This was their first outdoor show ever.  Why I'm mentioning this is THIS was the kind of venue Storm should have been taped at.  The performers are much more natural than when they are in a luxurious opera house.  The show itself I think indicated that Sharon and Phil read these reviews ... it was a combination of some of the Storm-like elements, more traditional elements, and the fun stuff we all love about CT.  It was fun to see the performers casually playing around outdoors before and after the show, something that is not really possible when they are in a downtown venue.",4,I look for better days for
