Yes, chicks are ugly, stupid and acting accordingly. The producer, accordingly, rolls movie smoothly to nowhere.

So many people set out to make good films that ultimately fail. Why aim so high when you can create a classic like ""Killer Bimbos""?I was actually startled to find this film had been transferred to DVD. It's one of those films that you watch with your friends and end up laughing yourself sick.The basic premise of the film is about a couple of go-go dancers who are mistakenly fingered for offing their sleazy boss. While on the run from the police, they ""rescue"" Darlene, a trackstop waitress and attempt to find Mexico. During this ridiculous escapade, one of the girls feels she isn't very pretty and the ringleader decides that the middle of the desert is a great place for a makeover.There are some amazingly stupid lines that are so funny that you will find yourself quoting them at some point down the road.Do yourselves a favour and pick up this gem. It's only $9.98 and worth every penny. I was well chuffed to find this one. Now, if they could only get the classic ""Nice Girls Don't Explode"" with Barbara Harris, Michelle Meyrink and Wallace Shawn onto DVD, my life would be complete!",5,"""Oh no!
