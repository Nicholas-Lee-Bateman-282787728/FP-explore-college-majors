The movie features themes about love, moving forward after a loss of a loved one and hope for happiness after experiencing tragedy in life. The movie has a mix of drama and comedy. The story is good but far from being a classic.The performance of Gianna Jun in this film is truly exceptional as her portrayal of a sorrowing police officer is marked by sincerity. Viewers will get affected by the emotions she has expressed like her sorrow and anguish. This is definitely a great prequel to the Asian classic,My Sassy Girl.",5,A Great Prequel To My Sassy Girl,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,610,"['Windstruck', 'female', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'mourning', 'death', 'boyfriend', 'movie', 'themes', 'love', 'moving', 'forward', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'hope', 'happiness', 'experiencing', 'tragedy', 'life', 'movie', 'mix', 'drama', 'comedy', 'story', 'good', 'far', 'being', 'classic.The', 'performance', 'Gianna', 'Jun', 'film', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'portrayal', 'sorrowing', 'police', 'officer', 'marked', 'sincerity', 'Viewers', 'will', 'get', 'affected', 'emotions', 'expressed', 'sorrow', 'anguish', 'definitely', 'great', 'prequel', 'Asian', 'classic', 'My', 'Sassy', 'Girl']",Windstruck (ALL Region - Single Disc Edition) DVD

Not only does it feature the same director, writer, lead actress and a cameo by the lead actor, but at moments it even covers some of the same emotional ground. That said it's a really good movie, but it cannot compare to MSG. That is a nearly impossible task.The beautiful Ji-hyun Jun is a cop and one day she arrests the wrong man (twice) for purse snatching. Naturally he takes a liking to her and volunteers for some kind of police helper program and is partnered with her. After one very eventful night on patrol they are bf/gf. This is the best part of the movie. I really, really enjoyed all of their little adventures and games they play together...then things take a serious turn and it's a [...] bummer for the entire last half of the movie. I was getting [...] depressed over the whole thing then comes the final scene and it was great, I couldn't help but smile. It also answered one of the questioned I asked in my MSG review. But it brings up another question, this time a spiritual one: [SPOLIERS!!!] if you're soul mates with somebody and they die and their spirit introduces you to another soul mate then what happens when you die? You live in Heaven with two people?! Sounds kinky. I believe in nothing, so personally I don't have to worry about that, plus I'm all alone (WHY?!!!!!!!??????!! *sobbing sounds*), but I was just curious how somebody who knows more about Korean culture and beliefs would think.Spiritual questions aside this was a really good movie and if it had just kept the happiness of the first half going for the entire movie it would have been a classic. The sad scenes were just too much of a bummer for me.My favorite scenes were the entire handcuffed together part and the scenes where she brings him lunch, I watched that scene a half dozen times. Very funny. I also really like the brief moment when they are walking together and he nervously glances over at her and she smiles, so (relieved) he smiles back, she frowns and he instantly goes back to being nervous again. LOL. I don't know why but I really liked how she was playing/flirting with him in that moment. Very sweet.If you like romantic comedies then it's definitely worth a watch, but only after you've watched MY SASSY GIRL a few times. Trust me. Also make sure you find a better DVD than I did.

1011354,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,B000H9A2XO,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[4, 8]","This begins promisingly -- with a beautiful flyover of nighttime Seoul (I think) to Korean singer Youme's beautiful rendition of Bob Dylan's ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" -- in heavily accented English. The music sound track would often excel over the storyline with effective uses of Satie's ""Gymnopedie No.1"" and Maurice William's ""Stay"" and original compositions by Choi Seung-hyun.There are other take-your-breath-away pictorial moments provided by director Kwak Jae-young and cinematographer Jeong Han-cheol. Unfotunately the mixed bag of a story includes thievery of the terrificMY SASSY GIRL(also with actress Jun Ji Hyun), overcooked comedy, chases and gunfights, teary melodrama and a dollop of GHOST. While some of it is okay, the parts fit together like pieces from different jigsaw puzzles. Then there's the ending relies on being familiar with MY SASSY GIRL to get the full meaning. Couldn't these people write their own movie?!Other than its music, the only justification for this movie is to give Jun Ji Hyun some screen time. And that's justification enuf. This tall, lithe actress has an extremely potent screen presence with her quirky persona, no-nonsense talent and offbeat prettiness -- and is about the only woman I've seen who looks terrific in a police uniform. It's sheer joy to visit with her again.If you absolutely must fill out your collection of Jun Ji Hyun movies, you've already made your decision (and I understand).

I could relate to it because of some personal experiences that were somewhat similar to what is shown in the movie.Yes, it is also a very very sad love story. But it is so beautiful, you cannot forget it. The music is wonderful and so in tune with the scenes it makes you cry, literally.One may say that she, being a policewoman, would  be a lot more detached and behave more ""professionally"". But that would be an American stereotype that does not fit the Asian counterpart. Moreover, God forbid, anyone ever has to experience what and how it feels like holding the one you love in your arms and watching their life slowly fading away... but if you experienced that, you will certainly understand her behavior.Knowing how it feels, I could not hold the tears while watching her desperately crying out loud into her radio handset begging for help... It really hurts to watch all that... And the music... sung in English with a heavy accent makes the scene a lot more haunting...And somehow I sighed with relief when she finally got shot because she had now a chance to meet the one she loved once again.. - ""Dry your tears with love...""",5,I loved this movie.
