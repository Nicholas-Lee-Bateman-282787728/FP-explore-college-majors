999463,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000G8NY1I,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","Shiro is overcome with guilt after committing a hit-and-run accident, but he finds no solace at his parent's country estate, where he is tracked and killed by his victim's family. As punishment for his sins, Shiro is cast into a fiery abyss and forced to suffer the torments of hell for all eternity! Nobuo Nakagawa breaks exciting new ground once more in 1960's JIGOKU, an experimental and Expressionist realization of the ""Handscrolls of Buddhist Hell"" that helped to usher in a new age of Japanese Horror. Unlike other products of the era which focused on psychological terror and the inherent horrors of the human condition, JIGOKU outwardly portrays scenes of intense gore in a shockingly perverse manner that announces the arrival of Ero-Guro-Nansensu in Japanese filmmaking. The sins of those around him begin to unravel after Shiro's arrival at the ""Heavenly Garden"" retirement community, and the entire town of corrupted souls are left to suffer alongside him when a night of drunken debauchery leads to their demise. The first and second acts are devoted to the exploration of sin in each of its many forms, but once the gates of hell have been opened, the linear narrative is discarded for unexplained visions of horror. Giant Oni (Japense demons) rip the flesh off of their victims, while others are beaten, forced to wander blindly through the void, or left to agonize in a boiling pit of pus and human waste. Images of Shiro's unborn baby floating down a river of blood and fields of flailing limbs are jarring to the senses, and still strike a chord with modern audiences. JIGOKU holds a certain significance within the annals of Japanese filmmaking, with an influence that stretches far beyond the Pinku Eiga films in the decades to follow.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,Jigoku,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1787,"['Shiro', 'overcome', 'guilt', 'committing', 'hit-and-run', 'accident', 'solace', 'parent', 'country', 'estate', 'where', 'tracked', 'killed', 'victim', 'family', 'punishment', 'sins', 'Shiro', 'cast', 'fiery', 'abyss', 'forced', 'suffer', 'torments', 'hell', 'eternity', 'Nobuo', 'Nakagawa', 'exciting', 'new', 'ground', 'once', 'more', '1960', 'JIGOKU', 'experimental', 'Expressionist', 'realization', 'Handscrolls', 'Buddhist', 'Hell', 'helped', 'usher', 'new', 'age', 'Japanese', 'Horror', 'other', 'products', 'era', 'focused', 'psychological', 'terror', 'inherent', 'horrors', 'human', 'condition', 'JIGOKU', 'outwardly', 'scenes', 'intense', 'gore', 'shockingly', 'perverse', 'manner', 'arrival', 'Ero-Guro-Nansensu', 'Japanese', 'filmmaking', 'sins', 'begin', 'unravel', 'Shiro', 'arrival', 'Heavenly', 'Garden', 'retirement', 'community', 'entire', 'town', 'corrupted', 'souls', 'are', 'left', 'suffer', 'alongside', 'when', 'night', 'drunken', 'debauchery', 'demise', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'are', 'devoted', 'exploration', 'sin', 'many', 'forms', 'once', 'gates', 'hell', 'have', 'been', 'opened', 'linear', 'narrative', 'discarded', 'unexplained', 'visions', 'horror', 'Giant', 'Oni', 'Japense', 'demons', 'rip', 'flesh', 'victims', 'others', 'are', 'beaten', 'forced', 'wander', 'blindly', 'void', 'left', 'agonize', 'boiling', 'pit', 'pus', 'human', 'waste', 'Images', 'Shiro', 'unborn', 'baby', 'floating', 'down', 'river', 'blood', 'fields', 'flailing', 'limbs', 'are', 'jarring', 'senses', 'still', 'strike', 'chord', 'modern', 'audiences', 'JIGOKU', 'certain', 'significance', 'annals', 'Japanese', 'filmmaking', 'influence', 'far', 'Pinku', 'Eiga', 'films', 'decades', 'follow.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Jigoku

It also seems to simmer around a collective belief system in regards to death and punishment for sins.The beginning of the movie shows the downfall of a young man who becomes trapped by his own guilt.  The last part of Jigoku depicts the torment and suffering of the damned, literally in hell.  The overall look is remarkably shot and completely haunting.  It's incredibly violent, filled with eerie and desperate images of the lost souls.  You've got bodies being sawed in half or being flayed alive down to the bone.  It's a smorgasboard of brutality.

999466,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B000G8NY1I,dooby,"[18, 21]","I found it interesting to watch this. It is being touted as a horror film. Would I recommend it to a horror fan? A qualified maybe. It is an old Japanese film (1960). It will be something very alien to its present target audience. Most viewers will be unfamiliar with the cultural/religious context in which it is set. Although Jigoku is correctly translated as Hell, it is not the Judaeo-Christian Hell that most viewers would have in mind. This is a Buddhist vision of Hell. It may look visually similar to western portraits of Hell but the entire concept is very different. The film presupposes the audience's familiarity with Buddhist beliefs. Firstly there is no God in original Buddhism. No supernatural deity sends Shiro's soul to Hell. In this Buddhist worldview, Shiro is in Hell simply because he believes he deserves to be there for what he perceives as his crimes in his previous life. Viewed at dispassionately, Shiro is blameless in most, if not all of his ""crimes"" and certainly not deserving of damnation to Hell in the western sense. Hell in Buddhism is also not eternal. (In this sense it is almost like the Catholic concept of Purgatory). The Buddhist Hell is simply one stage (the lowest) in the Wheel of Life, from which everyone can leave if they make the effort. So the film is not as pessimistic, arbitrary  and utterly devoid of hope as it would appear to most western audiences. Shiro and all the others will eventually work their way out of Hell to a higher plane of existence. Tamura, described here by the western term ""doppelganger"", is a Hell-being and a soul in his own right. Although Tamura too can work his way out of Hell, he chooses not to, and is condemned to repeat his torment until he learns his lesson and earns progression to the next level. The final scene is a visual metaphor for the Great Mandala, the Wheel of Life. Shiro is vainly trying to reach and rescue his child on the other side of the Wheel as it ceaselessly turns. We see him struggling hopelessly without success right up to the final freeze-frame. Left unsaid is what will happen given time. Shiro will eventually learn that the key to saving his child is to let go and get off the Wheel, allowing the turning Wheel to bring his child to him. That for him will be enlightenment, and with enlightenment he will be ready to leave Hell and progress to the next stage in Life. Viewed in that light, the film has an optimistic, even uplifting ending, very different from what a western audience would infer.The horror effects may have been good in their day but they are very dated now and look decidedly amateurish. Most of the tortures depicted, are traditional tortures featured in Eastern mythological portraits of Hell and you can see them depicted in texts, temples and theme parks across East Asia. If you are seeing it mainly for the shock or horror effects, don't bother. But it is a fascinating look at a wholly different worldview from what most westerners would be exposed to. It remains a fascinating work in its own right and deserves recognition for that alone, rather than for simply being another ""J-horror"" movie.Criterion's DVD is as usual very professionally produced. The print looks its age. But it is clean, undamaged, and aside from a jumping frame here and there, is very good. It is presented in its OAR of 2.35:1 (anamorphic). Colours are very sombre, drab and dark for the most part, occasionally punctuated by hellish crimsons which look impressive when they appear. Sound is in the original Japanese 1.0 Mono and is perfectly serviceable. Optional English subtitltes are provided.",4,Fascinating look at a Buddhist vision of Hell...

999469,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000G8NY1I,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[26, 29]","What can I say about ""Jigoku""?  It was certainly a film I looked forward to seeing, one that I had heard good things about.  Quite frankly, what movie called ""Hell"" wouldn't at least be worth a look.  However, while I admired the movie and would cautiously recommend it, I have to face the facts that I didn't particularly like it.  Yet it's easy for me to see some camps claiming ""masterpiece"" status for this peculiar film--and just as easy to see others deriding it as ""trash"".  As a film, it's really neither--but I don't dismiss it out of hand.  Given the context that it's a Japanese film from 1960--the imagery is quite striking, visually alluring and seems to have had an influence on many other films even to this day.The setup is appealing, and the characters are well presented.  But you know something is off from the beginning.  There are hallucinatory elements wound into our hero's daily life and his best friend appears to be an omnipresent evildoer.  But just as soon as you get used to things, we're whisked off to another city I like to call ""crazytown"".  Most of the characters presented here are petty, mean, corrupt--and worst of all not really developed.  I wondered why we were being introduced to so many one dimensional villains.  Then the answer came to me as people started dropping dead left and right--I realized we would soon be seeing them in ""Hell"".The message I got from ""Jigoku"" is that most of us are sinners and murderers in life, and we will pay for those sins.  Even those characters that are seemingly without sins are punished for loving the sinners.  And ""Hell"" is where everyone pays the price.The finale of the film does take place in ""Hell"".  It is beautifully constructed, and I believe quite well done.  It's very theatrical--if you're looking for gory realism, you're going to need to look elsewhere.  If I was to recommend the film, it would most likely be for these sequences.  But by this time, I had lost all track of any narrative drive in the film--so the images were all I was left with.So--worth seeing?  I believe so.  Enjoyable?  I'll leave that up to you.

That's what you get in Nobuo Nakagawa's stylish, hallucinatory 1960 thriller Jigoku, a cautionary tale/morality play about the decisions ordinary people make, and the extraordinary consequences of those decisions.The first third of this film follow Shiro (Shigeru Amachi), a guy who's just trying to get along in life. While a passenger in a car driven by his classmate Tamura (Yoichi Numata, recently of Ring), the two of them hit, and kill, a man, then leave the scene of the crime. He's not just some guy, though, and his death begins a complex, and quite unbelievable, tale of revenge, destruction, and depravity, both in the world we know (the second third of the film) and in hell itself (the final third). The first portion of the film often seems as if it's going to drag, but don't let that fool you; Nakagawa's just building up steam so that when everything gets going, he can take his foot off the brake and you'll go flying forward (rather like Tamura's driving early in the film, come to think of it).It's an odd little film, but a very pretty (in the strictest sense; the subject matter is anything but) one; if I had more faith in various Western directors, I'd tab Jigoku as a hefty influence on everything from Performance to the Girl in Gold Boots. (I feel a lot more comfortable saying Nakagawa was an influence on the manga of Hideshi Hino, but even there, I can't be completely certain.) Whether it was the progenitor of the psychedelic films of the sixties or evolved independently of what the West was on about at the time, however, is utterly irrelevant to the average viewer's enjoyment of Jigoku as an absurdist classic.

It's not the nastiest movie I've ever seen but considering it was released in the early sixties, I'd have to say I was surprised at how much they got past the censors.If you've ever heard the expression, ""Hell is repetition"", then that's what you're in for. The film is basically a take on the idea of hell and what it's like. Needless to say, it's not a vacation in Busch Gardens. People get torn to pieces, beheaded, flayed and/or thrown in a river of boiling blood in the films last third. A cautionary tale for those of you looking to commit foul deeds is what this ""boils"" down to.Okay, so bad pun aside, Criterion pulls a nice rabbit out of its magic hat with this release. I hadn't heard of the film before I had purchased it but after watching all the material on the disc, I felt like a true blue Jigoku scholar. Picture is very nice and the colors are very vibrant. The sound is in 1.0 mono but works quite well regardless. All I'll say is, it's a Criterion disc; what else can you expect other than first class?I enjoyed the movie quite a bit actually. It's always quite interesting to see films like this, that are highly artistic and stylized while clearly enjoying torturing the viewer with horrific imagery. I recommend this one to fans of Japanese horror, but just don't get this one confused with films like ""Ringu"" or ""Ju-On: The Grudge"", as they are a bit different in their own way.Definitely, at the very least, worth a look for those looking for something different and surreal.",4,Go to Jigoku!,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,1526,"['movie', 'quite', 'sick', 'not', 'nastiest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'considering', 'was', 'released', 'early', 'sixties', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'got', 'censors.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'expression', 'Hell', 'repetition', 'then', 'what', ""'re"", 'film', 'basically', 'take', 'idea', 'hell', 'what', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'vacation', 'Busch', 'Gardens', 'People', 'get', 'torn', 'pieces', 'beheaded', 'flayed', 'and/or', 'thrown', 'river', 'boiling', 'blood', 'films', 'last', 'third', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'looking', 'commit', 'foul', 'deeds', 'what', 'boils', 'down', 'to.Okay', 'so', 'bad', 'pun', 'aside', 'Criterion', 'nice', 'rabbit', 'magic', 'hat', 'release', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'film', 'had', 'purchased', 'watching', 'material', 'disc', 'felt', 'true', 'blue', 'Jigoku', 'scholar', 'Picture', 'very', 'nice', 'colors', 'are', 'very', 'vibrant', 'sound', '1.0', 'mono', 'quite', 'well', 'regardless', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Criterion', 'disc', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'expect', 'other', 'first', 'class', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'actually', 'always', 'quite', 'interesting', 'see', 'films', 'are', 'highly', 'artistic', 'stylized', 'clearly', 'enjoying', 'torturing', 'viewer', 'horrific', 'imagery', 'recommend', 'one', 'fans', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'confused', 'films', 'Ringu', 'Ju-On', 'Grudge', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'own', 'way.Definitely', 'very', 'least', 'look', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'surreal']",Jigoku

Why some seem intent on lavishing praise on this ridiculous feature is beyond me.The title is the Japanese word for Buddhist hell and this film was supposedly an exploration of the concept.  The story follows a student named Shiro as his life inexplicably spins out of control.  Much like the biblical story of Job, Shiro's life is suddenly filled with torments of every type, most of which are presaged by his ""friend"" Tamura.  Tamura is more demon than friend, and he uses his knowledge of everyone's sins to torment them endlessly.  Pretty much everyone eventually dies but, unfortunately, that's not the end of the picture.  There's still another 45 minutes or so of random, film-school imagery of the underworld and the torments inflicted on those characters we sort of got to know during the first part of the film.  What's worse is the fact that much of what we've learned about the characters seen earlier in the film is negated altogether during the final section.There are some interesting images here but they're overwhelmed by haphazard storytelling.  Director Nobuo Nakagawa is often credited with being the father of the Japanese horror film.  Here, the only horror he inflicts is upon the viewer.  To say this is one dimensional would be putting it lightly.  The story heaps problem after problem onto Shiro's shoulders to the point where all the viewer can do is laugh.  I have no idea if the performances are any good or not because the things the actors were asked to do were without nuance.  Shiro spends the whole movie with a stone face, brooding away at the edge of the frame.  We get no insight into his feelings or the feelings of those around him so we never really empathize with him.  We stand far, far outside his situation, watching him as if he were in a petri dish.This was supposed to be a sort of horror fairy tale.  Instead, it's just shallow, cheap, and uninventive filmmaking.  Turning a camera on its side isn't really an innovative choice.  It's more like a desperate plea to be considered weird.  While this is a weird movie, to be sure, it doesn't deserve the attention it's received.  Nakagawa went on to direct the excellent revenge film, Quick-Draw Okatsu, among many others.  I'd check one of those out instead.  Jigoku is not recommended.",2,Weird is easy.

999477,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B000G8NY1I,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[3, 3]","To prelude my review, I should advise that I'm fairly new to Japanese cinema, having only seen about twenty-five movies, and not all of these were horror.  If my attempt to contribute here is frowned upon by the genre's enthusiasts due to a lack of cinematic experience, I apologize profusely.  For those still interested, thank you, and here goes...Briefly, Jigoku tells the story of a young man weighted down by the guilt of his role in a fatal hit-and-run accident.  Consequential manisfestations of said incident saturate this movie's duration until our protagonist's nightmarish descention into Hell.Any admiration I can muster for this movie revolves strictly around its apparent boldness.  Jigoku was filmed in 1960, and from what I've seen of Japanese horror, the surrounding five to ten years produced mostly artistic and angular scary movies that, to me, unfolded with a wonderful grace. (Onibaba, 1964, for example.)  Jigoku, literally, took a giant saw to the backbone of this norm.  Desensitized as I am, it was still a pleasant shock to see some of what Director Nobuo Nakagawa was trying to present.This praise, however, ebbs when I consider what else was happening in horror cinema at the same time elsewhere on the planet.  I hate to push a trite reference, but Alfred Hitchcock's Pyscho also came out in 1960.  It's probably rude to compare the two in this forum, but I'm trying to make the point that Jigoku, to me, doesn't seem to have aged well.I didn't enjoy the movie.  I found the acting to be choppy and even obnoxious at times. (Which, now that I think about it, would be the best way for me to describe the abrubt, even jarring jumps from scene to scene.  Not impressed.) A regular dose of glass-shattering screeches from the female actresses had me reaching uncomfortably for the volume on my remote on more than one occasion, which unfortunately had to happen during some of the film's best offerings.  I'm sure this can be blamed largely on sound quality of that era and on Japanese horror in general.  I've watched enough to know that screaming Asian females can hit notes of a murderous pitch.  It hurts.That being said, I think this is a movie that SHOULD be watched, if only for its importance.  I was glad when it was over, but I knew that I had seen something that broke a fairly thick mold in its day.  It's a trippy movie filmed on one of the most inventive sets I've seen from that time.  This alone, which occupies only the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, has earned my humble recommendation.It's definitely one of those movies that make for great conversation and I'm glad I can now weigh in on it.Thank you for your time.- t -6 June, 2010",2,"Contexually remarkable, but not great.",1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,2681,"['prelude', 'review', 'should', 'advise', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'new', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'having', 'only', 'seen', 'twenty-five', 'movies', 'not', 'were', 'horror', 'attempt', 'contribute', 'here', 'frowned', 'genre', 'enthusiasts', 'due', 'lack', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'apologize', 'profusely', 'still', 'interested', 'thank', 'here', 'Briefly', 'Jigoku', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'weighted', 'down', 'guilt', 'role', 'fatal', 'hit-and-run', 'accident', 'Consequential', 'manisfestations', 'said', 'incident', 'saturate', 'movie', 'duration', 'protagonist', 'nightmarish', 'descention', 'Hell.Any', 'admiration', 'can', 'muster', 'movie', 'strictly', 'apparent', 'boldness', 'Jigoku', 'was', 'filmed', '1960', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'surrounding', 'five', 'ten', 'years', 'produced', 'mostly', 'artistic', 'angular', 'scary', 'movies', 'unfolded', 'wonderful', 'grace', 'Onibaba', '1964', 'example', 'Jigoku', 'literally', 'took', 'giant', 'saw', 'backbone', 'norm', 'Desensitized', 'am', 'was', 'still', 'pleasant', 'shock', 'see', 'what', 'Director', 'Nobuo', 'Nakagawa', 'was', 'trying', 'present.This', 'praise', 'however', 'ebbs', 'when', 'consider', 'what', 'else', 'was', 'happening', 'horror', 'cinema', 'same', 'time', 'elsewhere', 'planet', 'hate', 'push', 'trite', 'reference', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Pyscho', 'also', 'came', 'out', '1960', 'probably', 'rude', 'compare', 'two', 'forum', ""'m"", 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'Jigoku', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'aged', 'well.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'choppy', 'even', 'obnoxious', 'times', 'Which', 'now', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'abrubt', 'even', 'jarring', 'jumps', 'scene', 'scene', 'Not', 'impressed', 'regular', 'dose', 'glass-shattering', 'screeches', 'female', 'actresses', 'had', 'reaching', 'uncomfortably', 'volume', 'remote', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'unfortunately', 'had', 'happen', 'film', 'best', 'offerings', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'largely', 'sound', 'quality', 'era', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'general', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'enough', 'know', 'screaming', 'Asian', 'females', 'can', 'hit', 'notes', 'murderous', 'pitch', 'hurts.That', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'movie', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'watched', 'only', 'importance', 'was', 'glad', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'knew', 'had', 'seen', 'something', 'broke', 'fairly', 'thick', 'mold', 'day', 'trippy', 'movie', 'filmed', 'one', 'most', 'inventive', 'sets', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'alone', 'only', 'last', '20-30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'earned', 'humble', 'recommendation.It', 'definitely', 'one', 'movies', 'make', 'great', 'conversation', ""'m"", 'glad', 'can', 'now', 'weigh', 'it.Thank', 'time.-', 't', '-6', 'June', '2010']",Jigoku

But in the second half, events take a decidedly more Dantean turn.
