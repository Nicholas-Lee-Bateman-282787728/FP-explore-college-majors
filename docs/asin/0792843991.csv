150371,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792843991,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 11/06Rate: 711/06: Back to School starts off very slowly, pulls off weak punchline jokes, and then shoots off in a comedic ride once the great Rodney Dangerfield steps on the campus of Great Lakes University. It is an uproariously funny picture. Upon taking the oral examination to dispel accusations of academic fraud, Rodney Dangerfield is quizzed by a professor. The professor goes, ""I have one question for you..."" Dangerfield lets out a sigh of relief. ""...in 27 parts."" Rodney grimaces and whispered, ""I would love to break you in 27 parts."" What do you do when you assigned a research paper that is supposed to be based on works of Kurt Vonnegut? You hire the actual man himself and have him come over to your dorm to help out with the paper. Rodney gets it done and turns it in. Lo and behold, the professor fails Rodney because his writing shows that he knows nothing about Kurt Vonnegut. That's the great comedy out of a Rodney Dangerfield picture. Stuck in long lines on registration day? Create a rumor that Bruce Springsteen is on campus. They run amok for him. Voila! The lines dramatically reduce. I should have thought of that in my time. Can't get the boy in college? Fine...Rodney will buy a building and have it named after him.

150372,A2582KMXLK2P06,0792843991,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","The only reason I'm not giving Back to School a 5-star rating is because Rodney Dangerfield isn't *quite* as funny as he normally is (or was, rather).  His style of humor is absolutely amazing to me because of his ability to whip out a witty, creative (and usually offensive) joke at the drop of a hat that cover a wide range of subjects, but there's several portions of Back to School that don't quite have me moved to tears of laughter, which is a bit out of the ordinary for a Rodney Dangerfield movie.I believe Rodney Dangerfield is one of the best, if not the VERY funniest, comedians of all-time.  Easily in the top 5.Anyway, Rodney goes back to school as a relatively old man (I guess considering Back to School was made in 1986 he wasn't *that* old yet) and goes through all the college courses only to quickly discover he's not cut out for most of the classes due to the high difficulty in learning the majority of the class work.  He's there with his son, who has problems of his own (such as trying to make it big on the diving team but failing for one reason or another) and of course, he has to deal with troublemakers who feel the need to constantly pick on him and give the poor kid a hard time.Of course you already know Rodney will be there to stick up for his boy during times of great need.  As you can probably tell, this is very typical and predictable storytelling stuff for an 80's comedy movie, but it's not so terrible in this particular case since it stars such a funny comedian.Overall, if only Rodney Dangerfield delivered even MORE jokes this would have definitely been a 5-star movie without hesitation (though one joke about elephants throwing peanuts at people at the zoo STILL has me in tears, at the moment I write this, lol).",4,hilarious for the most part,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,1760,"['only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'Back', 'School', '5-star', 'rating', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', ""n't"", '*quite*', 'as', 'funny', 'normally', 'was', 'rather', 'style', 'humor', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'ability', 'whip', 'out', 'witty', 'creative', 'usually', 'offensive', 'joke', 'drop', 'hat', 'wide', 'range', 'subjects', 'several', 'portions', 'Back', 'School', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'moved', 'tears', 'laughter', 'bit', 'ordinary', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'movie.I', 'believe', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'VERY', 'funniest', 'comedians', 'all-time', 'Easily', 'top', '5.Anyway', 'Rodney', 'back', 'school', 'relatively', 'old', 'man', 'guess', 'considering', 'Back', 'School', 'was', 'made', '1986', 'was', ""n't"", '*that*', 'old', 'yet', 'college', 'only', 'quickly', 'discover', 'not', 'cut', 'out', 'most', 'classes', 'due', 'high', 'difficulty', 'learning', 'majority', 'class', 'work', 'son', 'who', 'problems', 'own', 'such', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'diving', 'team', 'failing', 'one', 'reason', 'course', 'deal', 'troublemakers', 'who', 'feel', 'need', 'constantly', 'pick', 'give', 'poor', 'kid', 'hard', 'time.Of', 'course', 'already', 'know', 'Rodney', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'stick', 'up', 'boy', 'times', 'great', 'need', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', 'very', 'typical', 'predictable', 'storytelling', 'stuff', '80', 'comedy', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'terrible', 'particular', 'case', 'funny', 'comedian.Overall', 'only', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'delivered', 'even', 'MORE', 'jokes', 'would', 'have', 'definitely', 'been', '5-star', 'movie', 'hesitation', 'one', 'joke', 'elephants', 'throwing', 'peanuts', 'people', 'zoo', 'STILL', 'tears', 'moment', 'write', 'lol']",Back To School

But Thornton instead went into business and made a fortune. Today he has a son and told him that he also is a Melon and can do anything. He sends his son to collage to get a formal education. Soon he finds his some can use some help and that tempered with a divorce spears Thornton to finally get the education he missed.Rodney has been in many films. However this is the one I will always relate him to. Aside from his one liners and ""I get no respect"" gags he does a good job of bring out the best (and worst) abut collage. I will admit that he does not look like Bing Crosby in ""High Time"" (1960); however we have just as much fun watching him adjust and then do one better.On of my favorite parts is when he has Kurt Vonnegut Jr. doing his homework; that is called delegation.One annoying part of school is when someone says there is so much ""picture framing material"" and asks how do you make a picture twice as wide as it is high? People usually measure the picture for the frame. So when the professor said let's build a factory and Thorton Melon asks what are you going to make?

150375,A3MQQS40FK2QAQ,0792843991,"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle""","[2, 2]","One of my favorite comedies has always been CADDYSHACK. Many of the best laughs came from that great character actor Bill Murray. But the real high points in that film were from Rodney Dangerfield. Every time he came on screen he made me roar with laughter, then he would disappear only to come out again. With BACK TO SCHOOL, he plays a similar character, although a nicer one. And unlike some other comedies starring a famous funnyman it doesn't depend 100% on that comedian. It contains other actors who also make me laugh.Dangerfield plays Thorton Melon. His birth name was Meloni and was the son of a New York tailor. But at some point in his life he changed his name to Melon. His dad told him that a man is nothing without an education, and he could do anything he wanted in life. Thorton went into the business and became a millionaire by opening a clothing franchise to overweight people. He was also at one time a show diver in New Jersey and had a wonderful first wife who gave birth to his son. After the opening credits we see Dangerfield in an obnoxious TV commercial for his company: Tall and Fat. Right away I was laughing out loud. And that was just for starters.Melon attends a meeting with his company Board of Directors. All of them are overweight and when he walks in the room Dangerfield delivers a funny line. But even though Melon's business is important to him, the one thing he really cares about besides his bodyguard Lou (Burt Young) is his son Jason (Keith Gordon), who is a freshman in college. This isn't surprising, since he is married to a two timing lady (Adrienne Barbou). During a party he delivers a tasteless insult to one of her friends, which made me laugh out loud. Thorton thinks that his son is on the diving team and in a fraternity. It turns out that he is the team's Towel Boy, and is not in a fraternity. The team's star diver is Chas (William Zabka). Although he doesn't like Jason he doesn't cause the kind of problems the same actor did to Ralph Macchio in THE KARATE KID. Jason is in love with Valerie Desmond, but she doesn't notice him. And the only friend he has is Derek Lutz (Robert Downey Jr.), a beatnik-like nutcase. Jason feels he would be better working like his dad then to complete college.When Melon comes to visit the campus and discovers the truth about his son, he decides to enroll in the college himself. He never finished high school, so how is the dean known as Dean Martin (Ned Beatty) supposed to accept him, despite his business status? Melon opens up the Melon School of Business, and we meet what would become his biggest adversary in the school: Philip Barbay (Paxton Whitehead), who is the head of the school's business dept. Barbay is a complete snob who hates Thorton immediately, but he gets his comeuppance in a dedication ceremony to the school. Thorton makes him look like a goon the first day of his class. That's two big laughs after another. Another one comes from a completely psychotic history teacher (Sam Kinison). Kinison was one of those comedy discoveries by Dangerfield and he uses it in his scenes, as a loudmouthed screamer.Thorton believes that every obstacle that gets in his way can be solved by throwing money at it, or by using a romantic charm he uses when he falls in love with his English teacher Dr. Turner (Sally Kellerman). Dr. Barbay loves Dr. Turner as well, but he treats romance like a corporate manager. She prefers to be more free-spirited. He hires Kurt Vonnegut to help him with his work, and other assistants to help out with his homework. At first, this appears to be working out, but it soon turns against him.Jason is a little bit embarrassed with his father, since he knows the man has to work to finish school and that Money and Love don't solve everything. His is even enraged at his dad when the man tries to solve some of Jason's troubles, especially when he's rumored to have paid the coach to get him on the diving team. But Keith Gordon is capable of delivering big laughs himself. In most of the movies he was in he was good for at least one laugh. There is a scene when Thorton's secretary sits in his regular seat during a class lecture. What she is doing is good for a laugh, but watch Keith next to her. The look on his face creates even more laughs with the scene. And he delivers a verbal comeuppance to Chas during a diving meet that gave me another laugh.In the midst of the comedy there is even a music scene. The film's composer is Danny Elfman, and he makes a cameo with his old band Oingo Boingo. They perform a great song at a party Thorton throws to celebrate his son's acceptance into the team. But Jason already learned about what his father did with the coach and isn't enjoying the party. Derek tries to cheer him up, but Melon delivers a perfect rebuttal to his attempt.I hope I haven't given away any of the laughs. I only described them vaguely. In a lesser actor they probably wouldn't be funny. But Dangerfield has such excellent timing in his one-liners and insults that he gets away with them. (For a clearer example of that you should see him in Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS) But his character is pretty much a likeable guy. That is true of the other characters in the film. The film ends at a graduation ceremony that looks like a real one. I had the feeling that Dangerfield improvised his speech to the class, and it's good for more laughs. Of course, I'm sure he improvised all the way through this movie.Rodney Dangerfield never topped this movie in the rest of his career. But as I said about him in the previous paragraph, he had a little bit of a triumph in NATURAL BORN KILLERS. He is even more obnoxious and really cruel in that film, but he gets some laughs because of his perfect timing. He continued to act until his death in 2004 and I do miss him.",5,One of the funniest motion pictures I've seen.,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,5824,"['One', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'always', 'been',

These last few weeks have brought back memories such as standing in long lines, worrying about financial aid, exorbitant book store prices, finding my way around campus, entrance exams (which can be quite challenging if your math is rusty like mine), and trying to find classes that best suit my work schedule.  All of this has to happen before the first minute is actually spent in class.  Being an older than average college student prompted me to write a review on this comedy classic about a college freshman much older than myself.The sorely missed Rodney Dangerfield plays Thornton Melon in perhaps his greatest performance ever.  Melon is a wealthy self-made sixty year-old entreprenuer whose massive retail chain specializes in clothes for large men.  What Melon lacks in formal education, he makes up for by being hard-working and having a solid business know-how that is not taught in the economics classes.  Two things happen that bring his life to a crossroads.  First of all, he catches his no-good wife (played with perfect bitchiness by Adrianne Barbeau) making time and a half with another man.  Secondly, his awkward, unhappy son Jason (played by Keith Gordon) calls him to say he wants to drop out of college.  So, what's a rich over the hill fatcat to do?  Enroll at his son's college, what else?Thornton initially has a good thing going at school with partying, cutting up in class, and lots of beautiful female students.  His wealth and fun-loving personality make him a hit with most of the other students.  He doesn't just throw parties; he IS the party.  His popularity even begins to rub off on Jason - which is a mixed blessing since he wants to succeed at school on his own merits.  But soon his partying and the fact that he has paid consultants to do his homework  illegally begin to catch up with him.As I mentioned earlier in the review, Rodney was at the top of his game here.  He was cleary having a good time making the movie, and that good time works its way to the viewer.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  Paxton Whitehead is perfect as an aloof Economics professor who serves as Thornton's diametrically opposed antagonist.  Robert Downey Jr, an actor who normally annoys me to end, is hilarious as Jason's punked-out diver-heckling best friend.  The late Sam Kinison is especially memorable as a psychotic History professor/Vietnam veteran.  You even have a cameo by Kurt Vonnegut Jr (yes, the same Kurt Vonnegut Jr who wrote _Slaughterhouse Five_).  Back to School is a textbook (bad choice of words) example of how great comedy films used to be before the comedy genre became hijacked by disgustingly unfunny toilet humor mavens like Rob Schneider and bland rom-com chick flicks.Not only is Back to School great for those times when you just need a good belly laugh, it also has a great message about the importance of both having to work hard and also having a good time.  Thornton was having a hard time with college because he partied too much.  Jason, on the other hand, was unhappy because he worked too hard and didn't take time to smell the roses.  Both of them needed to find a balance. Everyone going to school (college, high school, etc.) should take that lesson to heart. I certainly intend to.",5,I hereby dedicate this review to...Myself!!!,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,3314,"['Having', 'recently', 'turned', '34', 'decided', 'go', 'back', 'college', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'have', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'such', 'standing', 'long', 'lines', 'worrying', 'financial', 'aid', 'exorbitant', 'book', 'store', 'prices', 'finding', 'way', 'campus', 'entrance', 'exams', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'challenging', 'math', 'rusty', 'mine', 'trying', 'find', 'classes', 'best', 'suit', 'work', 'schedule', 'happen', 'first', 'minute', 'actually', 'spent', 'class', 'Being', 'older', 'average', 'college', 'student', 'prompted', 'write', 'review', 'comedy', 'classic', 'college', 'freshman', 'much', 'older', 'myself.The', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Thornton', 'Melon', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'performance', 'ever', 'Melon', 'wealthy', 'self-made', 'sixty', 'year-old', 'entreprenuer', 'massive', 'retail', 'chain', 'clothes', 'large', 'men', 'What', 'Melon', 'formal', 'education', 'up', 'being', 'hard-working', 'having', 'solid', 'business', 'know-how', 'not', 'taught', 'economics', 'classes', 'Two', 'things', 'happen', 'bring', 'life', 'crossroads', 'First', 'all', 'no-good', 'wife', 'played', 'perfect', 'bitchiness', 'Adrianne', 'Barbeau', 'making', 'time', 'half', 'man', 'Secondly', 'awkward', 'unhappy', 'son', 'Jason', 'played', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'say', 'drop', 'college', 'So', 'what', 'rich', 'hill', 'fatcat', 'do', 'Enroll', 'son', 'college', 'what', 'else', 'Thornton', 'initially', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'school', 'partying', 'cutting', 'up', 'class', 'lots', 'beautiful', 'female', 'students', 'wealth', 'fun-loving', 'personality', 'make', 'hit', 'most', 'other', 'students', ""n't"", 'just', 'throw', 'parties', 'party', 'popularity', 'even', 'rub', 'off', 'Jason', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'succeed', 'school', 'own', 'merits', 'soon', 'partying', 'fact', 'paid', 'consultants', 'do', 'homework', 'illegally', 'begin', 'catch', 'up', 'him.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'review', 'Rodney', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'was', 'cleary', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'making', 'movie', 'good', 'time', 'way', 'viewer', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'Paxton', 'Whitehead', 'perfect', 'aloof', 'Economics', 'professor', 'who', 'Thornton', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'antagonist', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'actor', 'who', 'normally', 'end', 'hilarious', 'Jason', 'punked-out', 'diver-heckling', 'best', 'friend', 'late', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'especially', 'memorable', 'psychotic', 'History', 'professor/Vietnam', 'veteran', 'even', 'have', 'cameo', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'Jr', 'yes', 'same', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'Jr', 'who', 'wrote', '_Slaughterhouse', 'Five_', 'Back', 'School', 'textbook', 'bad', 'choice', 'words', 'example', 'how', 'great', 'comedy', 'films', 'used', 'be', 'comedy', 'genre', 'became', 'hijacked', 'disgustingly', 'unfunny', 'toilet', 'humor', 'mavens', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'bland', 'rom-com', 'chick', 'flicks.Not', 'only', 'Back', 'School', 'great', 'times', 'when', 'just', 'need', 'good', 'belly', 'also', 'great', 'message', 'importance', 'having', 'work', 'hard', 'also', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'Thornton', 'was', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'college', 'partied', 'too', 'much', 'Jason', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'unhappy', 'worked', 'too', 'hard', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'smell', 'roses', 'needed', 'find', 'balance', 'Everyone', 'going', 'school', 'college', 'high', 'school', 'etc', 'should', 'take', 'lesson', 'heart', 'certainly', 'intend']",Back To School
150382,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0792843991,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 4]","There's wide agreement that the three greatest American film comedies are It Happened One Night from 1934, The Lady Eve from 1941 and 1986's Back to School. Some might quibble that It Happened One Night is no match for Miss Congeniality when it comes to female snorting or that The Lady Eve doesn't have the consistent belly laughs of Turner & Hooch, nor does it have a lovable, slobbering dog unless one counts Henry Fonda. Back to School, however, remains one of a kind.But seriously, folks...I like this movie a lot. It's not just that the film pokes hard at complacent academia, or that there are a string of great comedy moments given to us by several first-rate actors. Mainly, there's Rodney Dangerfield, himself an idiosyncratic comedian who at times can be easy to get tired of. As Thornton Melon, an up-from-his-boot-straps wealthy clothier -- he owns the Tall & Fat stores -- who signs up as a college student determined to help his wimpish son become popular, Dangerfield is something else. He's not just the loud, wisecracking, eye-popping comedian. Dangerfield gives Melon a layer of good-natured intentions, likeability and even a little lost pathos that is eventually quite endearing.Some parts of the movie don't work too well for me, mainly the parts of the storyline that involve Melon's son, played by Keith Gordon, his son's pal, played by Robert Downey, Jr., and his love interest, played by Sally Kellerman. Gordon is wimpish enough but, in my view, not very interesting. Downey is little more than an over-the-top exaggeration, and Kellerman puts me off with her above-the-salt manner and accent. But to compensate there is a great comedy turn by Ned Beatty as the obsequious university dean, Dean Martin, a man who knows endowments are worth more than an unseemly attention to student entry requirements. He'd be right at home in the Ivy League. Sam Kinison is terrific as a crackpot right-wing professor of history. Adrienne Barbeau is amusing and unlikable as Melon's high-spending wife who likes to show off her Klimt. And Paxton Whitehead as an over-civilized, professor of marketing with an aquiline nose can give us all useful lessons in condescension. The set up and follow-through with the Kurt Vonnegut joke is a classic. Part of the joy of the movie is watching how Melon deals with these people.Still, what makes Back to School work is Rodney Dangerfield, his way with comedy, his delivery and his timing. I'll leave the movie where it started, with Thornton Melon's new television ad for Tall & Fat stores. I hope you can hear Dangerfield in your mind...""Hi there. Are you a large person? Pleasantly plump? A little on the hefty side, perhaps? Well, let's face it: Are you FAT? When you go jogging, do you leave potholes? When you make love, do you have to give directions? At the zoo, do the elephants throw YOU peanuts? Do you look at a menu and say 'OK'? Well, now you can eat all you want, because at Thornton Melon's ""Tall & Fat"" stores, we've got you covered. That's right. Fine woolen, and woolen-blend suits and sport coats, in all the larger sizes -- husky, stout, extra-stout, and the new Hindenburg line. And for you ladies we have caftans, muumuus, and our own exclusive A-frame in all colors and patterns. Yes, we have miles and miles of fabric. So take it from me, Thornton Melon, if you want to look thin, you hang out with fat people.""The DVD disc I have has wide screen on one side, pan-and-scan on the other, with no extras.

150385,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,0792843991,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[6, 6]","What would comedy be without Rodney Dangerfield? After decades of trying to make it big, took his self-depreciating stand-up act of one-liners to new heights in the 1980's & paved the way for thousands of a new generation of comics to do the same. Eventually Hollywood called, and after a noticable bit part (Caddyshack) and a middle-of-the-road starring piece (Easy Money), it was time for Rodney to get the respect he always deserved with what now most consider his greatest film, 1986's Back To School.Playing Thornton Melon, a successful clothing chain owner, he decides to join his college-going son by enrolling himself, having a grand ole party and fun every step of the way. This was a role tailor made for Dangerfield, and still after all these years is as funny and fresh as ever. However, MGM first released this film in 2000 with a bare-bones edition that at the most would earn it a D+. So seven years later, it now has been given an ""Extracurricular Edition"" that for the most part makes the grade.First off, the picture has been completely cleaned-up, barely a blemish or speck to be seen all the while with still keeping it's '80's film look. 2000's included a new 5.1 audio mix but now offers the original 2.0 as well for purists. But the main reason to double-dip would be the brand-new-to-DVD extras that fill most of it's second layer. Ranging from 5 to 18 minutes each, there's six new featurettes here discussing the making of the movie, to the styles of the film's signature dive ""The Triple Lindy"", to a very thoughtful looking back of the life of Rodney Dangerfield as told by those who knew him personally (Rodney passed before this version came out in 2004). Each new feature is entertaining, informative and quite a trip to see some of it's actors & crew today, like Harold Ramis, Sally Kellerman, Burt Young (with even a feature about his rise in acting from Rocky to BTS), 80's Blond-Haired Bad Boy William Zabka (yeah, he talks about his career typecasting here...finally!), and as Rodney's son Keith Gordon (wow, he really looks different now!). These are worth the double-dip alone besides the great presentation of the movie it belongs to. Of course it would have been nice to have a commentary track with these people and more stock footage of maybe Rodney himself being interviewed during the time of the film, but MGM did do a pretty good job here and what we got should do quite nicely.Back To School unfortunately did such a good job for Rodney, that he never made another comedy that came close to it in his career again (No, Natural Born Killers doesn't count...put down that Little Nicky case too). But he'll always be remembered in film history as the funniest, oldest college freshman ever.

150392,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,0792843991,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[3, 3]","In the course of cinematic history, many standup comics have crossed over into films, and most of the films have been truly abysmal.  Even a comic like Richard Pryor, who is considered the best standup of all time, made some of the worst films I've ever seen (like The Toy).  Some will argue about Robin Williams and Bill Murray, but Williams's work is uneven (he's been great in some dramatic films like Good Will Hunting and has done some true crap like RV), and Murray is in another league together, as he is doing much more dramatic work, much more introspective than most comedians would ever dare.  Some of John Belushi's work is very good (notably The Blues Brothers), and Eddie Murphy made a few great films (48 Hours is probably the best), but the most notable exceptions to this rule is Rodney Dangerfield.  Rodney didn't make any cinematic masterpieces like Satantango or Berlin Alexanderplatz, but a good number of his films were hilarious, true to life, and they are still good today.  This is his best work, a consistently hilarious film where he plays a successful, street smart businessman who decides to go back to college to help out his son.  It works so well because Rodney himself is so damn engaging and so likeable one forgets the rather predictable (but still funny) plot.  Dangerfield is my favorite standup comic (a part of the entertainment field that I have to admit I don't really like).  His comedy never became dated (like many comedians), it was never topical, it was always universal, it was never cruel, never crass, never smug (a quality I hate about most modern comics), and his films had these qualities too.  He was just a real guy who never got any respect.  He plays a character like that here.  Despite his character's success, the faculty at the school still looks down on him (except for Sally Kellerman, who kind of loves/likes him).  Dangerfield one liners abound, and the rest of the cast is very engaging as well.  It's a very good picture, Rodney's best and one of the few examples out there of a standup making a pretty damn good film.",5,"5 stars for Rodney, my favorite standup comic and one of the few comics to make good films...",1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,2084,"['course', 'cinematic', 'history', 'many', 'standup', 'comics', 'have', 'crossed', 'over', 'films', 'most', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'abysmal', 'Even', 'comic', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'who', 'considered', 'best', 'standup', 'time', 'made', 'worst', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Toy', 'will', 'argue', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Williams', 'work', 'uneven', 'been', 'great', 'dramatic', 'films', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'done', 'true', 'crap', 'RV', 'Murray', 'league', 'together', 'doing', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'work', 'much', 'more', 'introspective', 'most', 'comedians', 'would', 'ever', 'dare', 'John', 'Belushi', 'work', 'very', 'good', 'notably', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'made', 'few', 'great', 'films', '48', 'Hours', 'probably', 'best', 'most', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'rule', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'Rodney', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cinematic', 'masterpieces', 'Satantango', 'Berlin', 'Alexanderplatz', 'good', 'number', 'films', 'were', 'hilarious', 'true', 'life', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'today', 'best', 'work', 'consistently', 'hilarious', 'film', 'where', 'successful', 'street', 'smart', 'businessman', 'who', 'go', 'back', 'college', 'help', 'out', 'son', 'so', 'well', 'Rodney', 'so', 'damn', 'engaging', 'so', 'likeable', 'one', 'rather', 'predictable', 'still', 'funny', 'plot', 'Dangerfield', 'favorite', 'standup', 'comic', 'part', 'entertainment', 'field', 'have', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'comedy', 'never', 'became', 'dated', 'many', 'comedians', 'was', 'never', 'topical', 'was', 'always', 'universal', 'was', 'never', 'cruel', 'never', 'crass', 'never', 'smug', 'quality', 'hate', 'most', 'modern', 'comics', 'films', 'had', 'qualities', 'too', 'was', 'just', 'real', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'respect', 'character', 'here', 'character', 'success', 'faculty', 'school', 'still', 'down', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'who', 'kind', 'loves/likes', 'Dangerfield', 'one', 'liners', 'abound', 'rest', 'cast', 'very', 'engaging', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'good', 'picture', 'Rodney', 'best', 'one', 'few', 'examples', 'there', 'standup', 'making', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'film']",Back To School

150404,A356HRZZFCEGL1,0792843991,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[4, 4]","""Back to School"" is a cherished member of my VHS collection not only because of the late but inimitably immortal Rodney Dangerfield and his outrageous persona, but also because of its laceration of a favorite satiric target - college. ""Back to School"" came out in 1986 -a year after I graduated from Tufts University- and it nearly perfectly encapsulates (if slightly exaggerates) and skewers college life during the heedlessly hedonistic and materialistic '80s.At first Thorton Melon (Rodney's character in the movie) seemingly has two altruistic motives for applying to college: 1) personal improvement, and 2) desire to help his only son Jason (Kevin Gordon) succeed, especially when Thorton discovers that Jason is not exactly the epitome of the BMOC. However, once he essentially bribes his way into college by convincing the venally avaricious Dean Martin (he, he) to let him endow the Thorton Melon School of Business Administration, high school dropout Thorton apparently has it made. One might argue that this scenario is implausible, but given universities' insatiable hunger for more cash, I could believe they would bend the rules to let wealthy Thorton in.Thorton then proceeds to embody every college student's wet dream - to be the perpetually fun-loving slacker who has the dough to show himself and others an endless good time and buy himself out of any trouble! Again, philistine critics may argue that no college would tolerate Thorton's party-boy persona.  Wouldn't the cops arrest him for the voyeuristic female dormitory scene or the out-of-control party scene, instead of merely reprimanding him or bringing Lite beer (remember Rodney was one of the shills for Lite)? However, ""Back to School""'s college satire necessarily must employ a little hyperbole to get its point across.For example, in the classroom scenes with the history professor (the late Sam Kinison) and the business instructor (Paxton Whitehead), the movie also does go a little over the top but also tweaks college for its well-meaning but unrealistically theoretical approach (i.e. head up its a$$ approach) to working and life. Thornton's take on the corruption and shady dealing it would really take to start a business really does have a germ of truth. Also, the way Thorton ""prepares"" for his classes -his secretary takes notes for him in class and his research team does his reports and homework- is off the wall but also possesses scientific truth. I'm sure that at Tufts and other colleges, some students never went to class and got others to take notes and do reports. However, (and this is one of my favorite scenes from the movie) only Thornton would heft a report created by his research team and crack, ""I dunno; it feels like a ""C""; add some more multicolored graphs""."" And of course only Thornton would hire Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. to appraise his own work.Nevertheless, ""Back to School"" lets Rodney collide with harsh, poignant reality without sacrificing laughs. Thornton is failing his classes; even the professor most sympathetic to him (Sally Kellerman) suspects him of plagiarism. His son Jason angrily refuses to let Thornton's think tank do his astronomy work. Thornton will be expelled unless he passes a multi-part oral exam (!) by all of his course professors. After a pep talk from Thornton's chauffeur (Burt Young) about Thornton's ""School of Hard Knocks"" life, Jason realizes that just as his dad came to school to show him how to loosen up and enjoy life, he must show his dad how to handle college responsibilities. And isn't that what college is all about - balancing responsibility and fun to have a meaningfully productive experience?Therefore, ""Back to School"" is more than just an ""Animal House"" retread. It uses Rodney's older, wry perspective (and those priceless one-liners) to point out both the absurdity and importance of college life. Heck, I would even recommend high school seniors applying to colleges to give ""Back to School"" a look if only to show them (with a grain of salt, of course) that while college is a worthwhile experience, it's also a unique, unfamiliar world all its own.",4,Dangerfield University Lampoon Still Contains Truth,1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,4116,"['Back', 'School', 'cherished', 'member', 'VHS', 'collection', 'not', 'only', 'late', 'inimitably', 'immortal', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'outrageous', 'persona', 'also', 'laceration', 'favorite', 'satiric', 'target', 'college', 'Back', 'School', 'came', 'out', '1986', '-a', 'year', 'graduated', 'Tufts', 'University-', 'nearly', 'perfectly', 'slightly', 'skewers', 'college', 'life', 'heedlessly', 'hedonistic', 'materialistic', ""'80s.At"", 'first', 'Thorton', 'Melon', 'Rodney', 'character', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'two', 'altruistic', 'motives', 'applying', 'college', '1', 'personal', 'improvement', '2', 'desire', 'help', 'only', 'son', 'Jason', 'Kevin', 'Gordon', 'succeed', 'especially', 'when', 'Thorton', 'Jason', 'not', 'exactly', 'epitome', 'BMOC', 'However', 'once', 'essentially', 'bribes', 'way', 'college', 'convincing', 'venally', 'avaricious', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'let', 'endow', 'Thorton', 'Melon', 'School', 'Business', 'Administration', 'high', 'school', 'Thorton', 'apparently', 'made', 'One', 'might', 'argue', 'scenario', 'implausible', 'given', 'universities', 'insatiable', 'hunger', 'more', 'cash', 'could', 'believe', 'would', 'bend', 'rules', 'let', 'wealthy', 'Thorton', 'in.Thorton', 'then', 'embody', 'college', 'student', 'wet', 'dream', 'be', 'perpetually', 'fun-loving', 'slacker', 'who', 'dough', 'show', 'others', 'endless', 'good', 'time', 'buy', 'trouble', 'Again', 'philistine', 'critics', 'may', 'argue', 'college', 'would', 'tolerate', 'Thorton', 'party-boy', 'persona', 'Would', ""n't"", 'cops', 'arrest', 'voyeuristic', 'female', 'dormitory', 'scene', 'out-of-control', 'party', 'scene', 'instead', 'merely', 'reprimanding', 'bringing', 'Lite', 'beer', 'remember', 'Rodney', 'was', 'one', 'shills', 'Lite', 'However', 'Back', 'School', 'college', 'satire', 'necessarily', 'must', 'employ', 'little', 'hyperbole', 'get', 'point', 'across.For', 'example', 'classroom', 'scenes', 'history', 'professor', 'late', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'business', 'instructor', 'Paxton', 'Whitehead', 'movie', 'also', 'go', 'little', 'top', 'also', 'college', 'well-meaning', 'unrealistically', 'theoretical', 'approach', 'i.e', 'head', 'up', 'approach', 'working', 'life', 'Thornton', 'take', 'corruption', 'shady', 'dealing', 'would', 'really', 'take', 'start', 'business', 'really', 'have', 'germ', 'truth', 'Also', 'way', 'Thorton', 'prepares', 'classes', '-his', 'secretary', 'notes', 'class', 'research', 'team', 'reports', 'homework-', 'wall', 'also', 'scientific', 'truth', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Tufts', 'other', 'colleges', 'students', 'never', 'went', 'class', 'got', 'others', 'take', 'notes', 'do', 'reports', 'However', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'only', 'Thornton', 'would', 'heft', 'report', 'created', 'research', 'team', 'crack', 'dunno', 'C', 'add', 'more', 'multicolored', 'graphs', 'course', 'only', 'Thornton', 'would', 'hire', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'Jr.', 'appraise', 'own', 'work.Nevertheless', 'Back', 'School', 'Rodney', 'collide', 'harsh', 'poignant', 'reality', 'sacrificing', 'laughs', 'Thornton', 'failing', 'classes', 'even', 'professor', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'plagiarism', 'son', 'Jason', 'angrily', 'let', 'Thornton', 'think', 'tank', 'do', 'astronomy', 'work', 'Thornton', 'will', 'be', 'expelled', 'multi-part', 'oral', 'exam', 'course', 'professors', 'pep', 'talk', 'Thornton', 'chauffeur', 'Burt', 'Young', 'Thornton', 'School', 'Hard', 'Knocks', 'life', 'Jason', 'just', 'dad', 'came', 'school', 'show', 'how', 'loosen', 'up', 'enjoy', 'life', 'must', 'show', 'dad', 'how', 'handle', 'college', 'responsibilities', ""n't"", 'what', 'college', 'balancing', 'responsibility', 'fun', 'have', 'meaningfully', 'productive', 'experience', 'Therefore', 'Back', 'School', 'more', 'just', 'Animal', 'House', 'retread', 'Rodney', 'older', 'wry', 'perspective', 'priceless', 'one-liners', 'point', 'out', 'absurdity', 'importance', 'college', 'life', 'Heck', 'would', 'even', 'recommend', 'high', 'school', 'seniors', 'applying', 'colleges', 'give', 'Back', 'School', 'look', 'only', 'show', 'grain', 'salt', 'course', 'college', 'worthwhile', 'experience', 'also', 'unique', 'unfamiliar', 'world', 'own']",Back To School

That is what makes him so charming. The story here is actually pretty good, when you look past the obvious humor.  You have Rodney trying to get close to his son, which doesn't seem to work well, well because he's obnoxious and too care free. Where his son is focused and serious. I think the chemistry between them is a thing of beauty.  There are moments where you almost believe they are father and son, and moments where you feel the son's embarrassment of his &quot;pops&quot; Lots of slapstick here, there's not really much bad langauge, and only about 1 second of nudity.

Adrienne Barbeau is in it, playing a trophy wife of yesteryear, grasping and unfaithful, she's only in it for the money any more.  Thornton Melon runs a men's store called, ""TALL AND FAT,"" and I would have liked to see a whole sequel to BACK TO SCHOOL that focussed on the day to day life of running this haberdashery.  Anyway he's rich enough to be able to afford to hire Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. to write a term paper for him.  Sam Kinison is in the movie too as the history professor--crazy and out of this world!

150410,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,0792843991,Kevin R. Austra,"[2, 2]","This is a great movie and fairly tame by 1980s standards.  You might look at this film as a more intellectual version of ANIMAL HOUSE.This film is a mix of Dangerfield styles.  Essentially we have the family man from EASY MONEY combined with his rich eccentric character from CADDY SHACK.  The story is simple.  Thornton Melon, a hard working self made multi millionaire, visits his son at (the fictional) Grand Lakes University.  There he discovers his son Jason (Keith Gordan) is struggling with college life as well as life in general.  Melon decides to show his son that he can do anything he sets his mind to do.  As such, Melon makes a generous donation to the university and is rewarded with acceptance as a student in the upcoming semester.Thornton Melon has his own challeges as he is used to having things his own way and eventually realizes that money cannot buy everything. Melon's nemesis is his business science professor Dr. Phillip Barbay.  Melon's real life success and experience in business come into conflict with Barbay's pure academic teachings.  Barbay rejects Melon as a legitimate student while Melon unwisely refuses to at least pretend to respect his professor's teachings.  Adding to the tension is that Melon has eyes for Barbay's girlfriend and peer Dr. Diane Turner (Sally Kellerman). Turner is a woman seeking old fashioned romance and fun, which is something totally alien to Barbay.Meanwhile Melon's son Jason becomes ever more confused about college.  Though he finally makes it onto the school diving team he wrongly assumes his good fortune is solely due to his father's checkbook.  Jason is also vying for the affections of his nemesis' girlfriend.  By the film's conclusion both men win the affections of their respective love interests, have moved closer as father and son, and emerged from the semester a little smarter.BACK TO SCHOOL was a belated follow up to Dangerfield's successful EASY MONEY.  Its premier in 1986, a full three years after EASY MONEY, meant that it could not ride the successful wave of its predecessor.  Basically it was a Rodney Dangerfield movie starting from scratch.  The original script called for Dangerfield to come from a somewhat impoverished background thus explaining his street-wise approach to college.  This would have been a better link to his previous character Monty Capuletti.  The screenplay was later changed to make Thornton Melon wealthy.BACK TO SCHOOL hosts quite a few great performances by actors in minor supporting roles.  Adrienne Barbeau is perfect for her brief but outstanding role as Vanessa Melon.  E. Emmet Walsh (Christmas with the Kranks, Fletch) does a good job as the swim team coach.  Dangerfield protege Sam Kinison has a very memorable role as a history professor.  Let us not forget Ned Beatty as Dean Martin.  Also virtually unrecognizable in the film is actor Robert Picardo (China Beach, Star Trek Voyager) as Gorgio.One of the questions that is never answered in the movie is when this story takes place.  The younger Melon, while talking to his father from a phone in the locker room, says that it is during a break -- and thus his apologies for not visiting home during break. From the colorful changing leaves we see that the story logically begins in the early autumn.  The exterior shots of the University of Wisconsin also support that the film was lensed in the Fall.  One has to question what sort of lengthy college break takes place in autumn?  The never explained break allows Thornton Melon to enroll as a freshman in time to begin one of the semesters.  Later we see the lush green background by the swimming pool for the scenes shot in southern California.  The bottom line is that Melon's visit and subsequent enrollment timeline is of no consequence to the story.BACK TO SCHOOL was the last of the great Rodney Dangerfield films.  Although he appeared in various television series episodes and numerous films, his subsquent ""Dangerfield"" films, such as MY FIVE WIVES, THE FOURTH TENOR, THE GODSON, MEET WALLY SPARKS, and LADYBUGS paled in comparison.  Shortly before his death Dangerfield was reportedly involved in preparing a sequel to BACK TO SCHOOL, but it never came to fruition.  Remember that a similar circumstance occurred when Dangerfield was to originally reprise his role in CADDY SHACK II, but was dropped from the project.The internet abounds with reports about a 21st century remake in the works for BACK TO SCHOOL.  In my opinion they should never tamper with the original.",5,Back to Rodney,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,4516,"['great', 'movie', 'fairly', 'tame', '1980s', 'standards', 'might', 'look', 'film', 'more', 'intellectual', 'version', 'ANIMAL', 'HOUSE.This', 'film', 'mix', 'Dangerfield', 'styles', 'Essentially', 'have', 'family', 'man', 'EASY', 'MONEY', 'combined', 'rich', 'eccentric', 'character', 'CADDY', 'SHACK', 'story', 'simple', 'Thornton', 'Melon', 'hard', 'working', 'self', 'made', 'multi', 'millionaire', 'son', 'fictional', 'Grand', 'Lakes', 'University', 'son', 'Jason', 'Keith', 'Gordan', 'struggling', 'college', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'life', 'general', 'Melon', 'show', 'son', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'mind', 'do', 'such', 'Melon', 'generous', 'donation', 'university', 'rewarded', 'acceptance', 'student', 'upcoming', 'semester.Thornton', 'Melon', 'own', 'challeges', 'used', 'having', 'things', 'own', 'way', 'eventually', 'realizes', 'money', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'everything', 'Melon', 'nemesis', 'business', 'science', 'professor', 'Dr.', 'Phillip', 'Barbay', 'Melon', 'real', 'life', 'success', 'experience', 'business', 'come', 'conflict', 'Barbay', 'pure', 'academic', 'teachings', 'Barbay', 'Melon', 'legitimate', 'student', 'Melon', 'unwisely', 'least', 'pretend', 'respect', 'professor', 'teachings', 'Adding', 'tension', 'Melon', 'eyes', 'Barbay', 'girlfriend', 'peer', 'Dr.', 'Diane', 'Turner', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'Turner', 'woman', 'seeking', 'old', 'fashioned', 'romance', 'fun', 'something', 'totally', 'alien', 'Barbay.Meanwhile', 'Melon', 'son', 'Jason', 'ever', 'more', 'confused', 'college', 'finally', 'school', 'diving', 'team', 'wrongly', 'good', 'fortune', 'solely', 'due', 'father', 'checkbook', 'Jason', 'also', 'vying', 'affections', 'nemesis', 'girlfriend', 'film', 'conclusion', 'men', 'win', 'affections', 'respective', 'love', 'interests', 'have', 'moved', 'closer', 'father', 'son', 'emerged', 'semester', 'little', 'smarter.BACK', 'TO', 'SCHOOL', 'was', 'belated', 'follow', 'up', 'Dangerfield', 'successful', 'EASY', 'MONEY', 'premier', '1986', 'full', 'three', 'years', 'EASY', 'MONEY', 'meant', 'could', 'not', 'ride', 'successful', 'wave', 'predecessor', 'Basically', 'was', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'movie', 'starting', 'scratch', 'original', 'script', 'called', 'Dangerfield', 'come', 'somewhat', 'impoverished', 'background', 'thus', 'explaining', 'street-wise', 'approach', 'college', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'link', 'previous', 'character', 'Monty', 'Capuletti', 'screenplay', 'was', 'later', 'changed', 'make', 'Thornton', 'Melon', 'wealthy.BACK', 'TO', 'SCHOOL', 'quite', 'few', 'great', 'performances', 'actors', 'minor', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'perfect', 'brief', 'outstanding', 'role', 'Vanessa', 'Melon', 'E.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'Christmas', 'Kranks', 'Fletch', 'good', 'job', 'swim', 'team', 'coach', 'Dangerfield', 'protege', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'very', 'memorable', 'role', 'history', 'professor', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Also', 'virtually', 'unrecognizable', 'film', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'China', 'Beach', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'Gorgio.One', 'questions', 'never', 'answered', 'movie', 'when', 'story', 'place', 'younger', 'Melon', 'talking', 'father', 'phone', 'locker', 'room', 'break', 'thus', 'apologies', 'not', 'visiting', 'home', 'break', 'colorful', 'changing', 'see', 'story', 'logically', 'early', 'autumn', 'exterior', 'shots', 'University', 'Wisconsin', 'also', 'support', 'film', 'was', 'lensed', 'Fall', 'One', 'question', 'what', 'sort', 'lengthy', 'college', 'break', 'place', 'autumn', 'never', 'explained', 'break', 'Thornton', 'Melon', 'enroll', 'freshman', 'time', 'begin', 'one', 'semesters', 'Later', 'see', 'lush', 'green', 'background', 'swimming', 'pool', 'scenes', 'shot', 'southern', 'California', 'bottom', 'line', 'Melon', 'visit', 'subsequent', 'enrollment', 'timeline', 'consequence', 'story.BACK', 'TO', 'SCHOOL', 'was', 'last', 'great', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'films', 'appeared', 'various', 'television', 'series', 'episodes', 'numerous', 'films', 'subsquent', 'Dangerfield', 'films', 'such', 'MY', 'FIVE', 'WIVES', 'THE', 'FOURTH', 'TENOR', 'THE', 'GODSON', 'MEET', 'WALLY', 'SPARKS', 'LADYBUGS', 'paled', 'comparison', 'Shortly', 'death', 'Dangerfield', 'was', 'reportedly', 'involved', 'preparing', 'sequel', 'BACK', 'TO', 'SCHOOL', 'never', 'came', 'fruition', 'Remember', 'similar', 'circumstance', 'occurred', 'when', 'Dangerfield', 'was', 'originally', 'reprise', 'role', 'CADDY', 'SHACK', 'II', 'was', 'dropped', 'project.The', 'internet', 'abounds', 'reports', '21st', 'century', 'remake', 'works', 'BACK', 'TO', 'SCHOOL', 'opinion', 'should', 'never', 'tamper', 'original']",Back To School

He is one doggone funny guy.  The one liners here are great and there are plenty of 'em.  Plus you get to see Robert Downey Jr. in an early role as a wigged out college guy (now that he's a, you know, very conservative adult, catch this movie to see how much he's really changed).Yeah, OK, so maybe it's not exactly credible that a gorgeous babe like Sally Kellerman would fall for a goofy overweight guy like Rodney, but then again, he's loaded. And what babe would turn down a loaded guy, even if he's chunky?  But he shows a lot of heart here which is what makes this work.Rodney (Thurman Melon, short for Meloni--I guess he didn't want to reveal his Italian ancestry) never finished college--actually, he never went to college.  So he accepts a challenge from his college-age son to go to the same school his son attends to show how hard it is--or isn't.  We find out that Thruman was a diving champ in high school and he gets to prove it in the story.  Plus he belts out a great rendition of Twist and Shout.You also get to see Oingo Boingo when they were at the top of their game do a few numbers.  (For those of you unfamiliar, they were a great party rock band from the mid-80s to the early 90s.) Thurman is married to catwoman Adrienne Barbeau who, despite her obvious, shall we say, endowments, is mean-spirited (Rodney loves to have a mean-spirited woman in his flicks; check out Geraldine Fitzgerald in Easy Money).  But she fools around once too many times and the marriage is bust.Off to school Rodney (uh, I mean Thurman) goes which is where he meets Sally Kellerman's English professor with whom he's smitten immediately.It's predictable, but a lot of fun.  Rodney is one of the very few guys around who really makes me laugh.  Pretty hard thing to accomplish, but he does the job.  So if you're feeling low, stick this in your DVD player and for at least 90 minutes or so you can relax and laugh a lot.",4,A great temporary cure for the blues,1042243200,"01 11, 2003",2003,2020,"['Rodney', 'goods', 'here', 'mean', 'let', 'face', 'was', 'ONLY', 'reason', 'watch', 'Caddyshack', 'one', 'doggone', 'funny', 'guy', 'one', 'here', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'plenty', ""'em"", 'get', 'see', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'early', 'role', 'wigged', 'out', 'college', 'guy', 'now', 'know', 'very', 'conservative', 'adult', 'catch', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'changed', '.Yeah', 'OK', 'so', 'maybe', 'not', 'exactly', 'credible', 'gorgeous', 'babe', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'would', 'fall', 'goofy', 'overweight', 'guy', 'Rodney', 'then', 'again', 'loaded', 'what', 'babe', 'would', 'turn', 'down', 'loaded', 'guy', 'even', 'chunky', 'lot', 'heart', 'here', 'what', 'work.Rodney', 'Thurman', 'Melon', 'short', 'Meloni', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'Italian', 'ancestry', 'never', 'finished', 'college', 'actually', 'never', 'went', 'college', 'challenge', 'college-age', 'son', 'go', 'same', 'school', 'son', 'show', 'how', 'hard', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'Thruman', 'was', 'diving', 'champ', 'high', 'school', 'prove', 'story', 'out', 'great', 'rendition', 'Twist', 'Shout.You', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Oingo', 'Boingo', 'when', 'were', 'top', 'game', 'do', 'few', 'numbers', 'unfamiliar', 'were', 'great', 'party', 'rock', 'band', 'mid-80s', 'early', '90s', 'Thurman', 'married', 'catwoman', 'Adrienne', 'Barbeau', 'who', 'obvious', 'shall', 'say', 'endowments', 'mean-spirited', 'Rodney', 'have', 'mean-spirited', 'woman', 'flicks', 'check', 'out', 'Geraldine', 'Fitzgerald', 'Easy', 'Money', 'around', 'once', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'marriage', 'bust.Off', 'school', 'Rodney', 'uh', 'mean', 'Thurman', 'where', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'English', 'professor', 'whom', 'smitten', 'immediately.It', 'predictable', 'lot', 'fun', 'Rodney', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'guys', 'who', 'really', 'Pretty', 'hard', 'thing', 'accomplish', 'job', 'So', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'low', 'stick', 'DVD', 'player', 'least', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'can', 'relax', 'lot']",Back To School

As I'm not a big comedy fan, this is a compliment to the filmmakers.The plot is simple but Rodney Dangerfield's acting empowers the film.  He plays the role of an extremely wealthy but uneducated businessman whose son is not doing well in college.  To keep the son from dropping out, he decides to enroll himself.  What follows is a laugh a minute as the father, who is worldly wise and used to running an extremely successful business, has to deal with college classes as well as the snobbery of some of the teachers, especially one who is romancing a female English professor played by Sally Kellerman.Dangerfield throws great parties, embarrasses the professor teaching about business and answers all questions with wisecracks.

150419,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,0792843991,Marty Gillis,"[5, 5]","The great Rodney Dangerfield is a personal favorite of mine and  'Back to School' is his most accessible film vehicle, considered  to be a comedy classic among 80's film aficionados.  I have seen this film more times than I wish to admit (ok, more than 25 times) and always find it both hilarious and entertaining!  With that said, this review will concentrate on the product, the video and audio quality along with any special features rather than the film itself.Is 'Back to School' on Blu Ray worth upgrading to from your VHS or DVD copies?  In two words:  YES!!! YES!!'Back to School' come to Blu Ray presented in the original Aspect Ratio of 1.85:1 (which is always a plus) which means you will get very thin black bars at the top and bottom of the picture.  This is superior to zooming the picture to fill your 16:9 HDTV screen and in the case of 'Back to School' any help with resolution is a plus as this is an uneven and semi troubled video presentation.So how about this picture? It is THAT MUCH better than the DVD? Yes it is. But with that said, it is ALSO quite grainy on many of the indoor shots. This transfer has enough heavy grain to quality as a high fiber diet! Outdoor shots with natural light fare much better and are almost all quite a bit better to look at.  I would rather see the grain than have it forcibly removed with DNR as that would take what detail there is and smear it.  I did notice the problem improves a bit as the film progresses.  Honestly, I think it is more a case of a dirty print and even the smallest amount of actual restoration would make this film really shine on Blu Ray.  Colors are strong and actual print damage is very minimal and I noticed a very small amount of edge enhancement but nothing over the top.OH well, they did this transfer on the cheap and it looks to have been ported directly from an old HD scan.  To give you an idea, it is BETTER looking than the '48 Hours' Blu Ray picture but not as good as 'Caddyshack'.  If you grew up with the endless running of this film on HBO, you will be pleased with the uptick in picture quality overall.  On the other hand, Rodney STILL isn't getting any respect, not with this assembly line transfer.How about the sound? The film gets a NICE uptick with a pretty impressive DTS Master Audio 5.1 mix.  Everything sounds better than I remember. This is not 'Lord of the Rings' and your sub and surrounds won't be overworked, but the music sounds great, there are some ambient effects in the surrounds and the dialogue is clear as a bell.  I thought the 5.1 lossless mix to be a notch better than the picture quality. The horrible censored audio of various TV versions is gone and Robert Downey Jr. now says ""Do Me"" instead of ""Shoe Me"" !  (just needed to clear that up)The special features overall are a nice addition but there is no ""Play All"" button and after every clip you go back to the main feature in progress.  The ""Making Of"" documentary is actually pretty good as is the small tribute to Rodney.  The ""Triple Lindy"" is covered in length in another feature which clears up the age old mystery of whether or not that is REALLY Rodney doing the dive.  (honestly I was shocked to find out it was a stunt man) HA HA For the truly obsessive fans, the films' director has recorded a very comprehensive and amusing commentary track.Bottom Line: If you love 'Back to School' then this purchase is a no brainer. While not being any better than a sloppy cut rate catalog transfer, the film transcends this and offers fans many hours of repeat viewings. It is also likely to be the best we will see 'Back to School' looking for the home video market, at last in the foreseeable future.  A pretty nice package overall and if the video quality was even a bit better, I would give this product 5 stars.  As it stands, I give the movie itself 5 stars (for an 80's comedy) but this transfer between 3 and 3 and 1/2 stars.Recommended for fans who want ANY uptick in quality, maybe not so much for casual viewers who already own the DVD.",4,No Respect on Blu Ray for Rodney!,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,4027,"['great', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', ""'Back"", 'School', 'most', 'accessible', 'film', 'vehicle', 'considered', 'be', 'comedy', 'classic', '80', 'film', 'aficionados', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'more', 'times', 'wish', 'admit', 'ok', 'more', '25', 'times', 'always', 'find', 'hilarious', 'entertaining', 'said', 'review', 'will', 'concentrate', 'product', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'special', 'features', 'rather', 'film', 'itself.Is', ""'Back"", 'School', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'worth', 'upgrading', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'copies', 'two', 'words', 'YES', 'YES', ""'Back"", 'School', 'come', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'presented', 'original', 'Aspect', 'Ratio', '1.85:1', 'always', 'plus', 'will', 'get', 'very', 'thin', 'black', 'bars', 'top', 'bottom', 'picture', 'superior', 'zooming', 'picture', 'fill', '16:9', 'HDTV', 'screen', 'case', ""'Back"", 'School', 'help', 'resolution', 'plus', 'uneven', 'semi', 'troubled', 'video', 'presentation.So', 'how', 'picture', 'MUCH', 'better', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'said', 'ALSO', 'quite', 'grainy', 'many', 'indoor', 'shots', 'transfer', 'enough', 'heavy', 'grain', 'quality', 'high', 'fiber', 'diet', 'Outdoor', 'shots', 'natural', 'light', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'almost', 'quite', 'bit', 'better', 'look', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'grain', 'have', 'forcibly', 'removed', 'DNR', 'would', 'take', 'what', 'detail', 'smear', 'did', 'notice', 'problem', 'bit', 'film', 'Honestly', 'think', 'more', 'case', 'dirty', 'print', 'even', 'smallest', 'amount', 'actual', 'restoration', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'really', 'shine', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Colors', 'are', 'strong', 'actual', 'print', 'damage', 'very', 'minimal', 'noticed', 'very', 'small', 'amount', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'nothing', 'top.OH', 'well', 'did', 'transfer', 'cheap', 'have', 'been', 'ported', 'directly', 'old', 'HD', 'scan', 'give', 'idea', 'BETTER', 'looking', ""'48"", 'Hours', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'picture', 'not', 'as', 'good', ""'Caddyshack"", 'grew', 'up', 'endless', 'running', 'film', 'HBO', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'uptick', 'picture', 'quality', 'overall', 'other', 'hand', 'Rodney', 'STILL', ""n't"", 'getting', 'respect', 'not', 'assembly', 'line', 'transfer.How', 'sound', 'film', 'NICE', 'uptick', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'DTS', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'mix', 'Everything', 'better', 'remember', 'not', ""'Lord"", 'Rings', 'sub', 'surrounds', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'overworked', 'music', 'great', 'are', 'ambient', 'effects', 'surrounds', 'dialogue', 'clear', 'bell', 'thought', '5.1', 'lossless', 'mix', 'be', 'notch', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'horrible', 'censored', 'audio', 'various', 'TV', 'versions', 'gone', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'now', 'Do', 'Me', 'instead', 'Shoe', 'Me', 'just', 'needed', 'clear', 'up', 'special', 'features', 'overall', 'are', 'nice', 'addition', 'Play', 'button', 'clip', 'go', 'back', 'main', 'feature', 'progress', 'Making', 'documentary', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'small', 'tribute', 'Rodney', 'Triple', 'Lindy', 'covered', 'length', 'feature', 'age', 'old', 'mystery', 'not', 'REALLY', 'Rodney', 'doing', 'dive', 'honestly', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'stunt', 'man', 'HA', 'HA', 'truly', 'obsessive', 'fans', 'films', 'director', 'recorded', 'very', 'comprehensive', 'amusing', 'commentary', 'track.Bottom', 'Line', 'love', 'School', 'then', 'purchase', 'brainer', 'not', 'being', 'better', 'sloppy', 'cut', 'rate', 'catalog', 'transfer', 'film', 'fans', 'many', 'hours', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'also', 'likely', 'be', 'best', 'will', 'see', ""'Back"", 'School', 'looking', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'last', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'pretty', 'nice', 'package', 'overall', 'video', 'quality', 'was', 'even', 'bit', 'better', 'would', 'give', 'product', '5', 'stars', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', '80', 'comedy', 'transfer', '3', '3', '1/2', 'stars.Recommended', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'ANY', 'uptick', 'quality', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'casual', 'viewers', 'who', 'already', 'own', 'DVD']",Back To School

Overall, a story about a Tall & Fat business tycoon, Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield, also R.I.P.) going to help his failing son to pass his exams at college. My favorite scenes are: 1) when Dangerfield shows us his Tall & Fat TV ad, 2) when he goes looking for his son, in a female dorm where he 'accidentally' ends up with two peeks at a nude girl taking a shower, 3) where they have Kinison as a disturbed history teacher, making his own comment about the Vietnam war, which was, ""I WISH I COULD BELIEVE IT WAS OVER, BUT I WAS THERE!

A film starring one of the funniest men on the planet (Mr. Rodney Dangerfield) with an ensemble cast of famous names unto themselves, has got to have SMASH MOVIE written all over it, and it does!  A simple premise: Thornton Melon (Dangerfield) has become a wealthy millionaire even though he dropped out of high school, and now his son, Jason (Keith Gordon) wants to drop out of college, so in order to keep him from leaving, Thornton decides to go to college too!  There are so many hysterical moments I just can't print them all.  But some favorites are the big scene with Sam Kinison as the crazed history teacher, Professor Terguson (&quot;Good teacher.  He really seems to care.  About what I have no idea&quot;.), Thornton doing the Triple Lindey swimming dive  (with Derek[Robert Downey Jr.]distracting the rival diving team with loud noise and reflecting light to the face), Thornton's rendition of &quot;Twist And Shout&quot; at a local bar, and of course, the party in Thornton's dorm room, with Danny Elfman's band, Oingo Boingo and a killer hot tub, complete with BUBBLES! (&quot;Now that's what I call marine biology&quot;.)  But a truly winning comedy can't be completely great without heart, which is what this film has.  Keith Gordon (John Carpenter's Christine), who is sorely missed in the acting world since he changed his profession to directing, is great as Thornton's son, Jason, who loves his father a lot but feels like Dad's always trying to do too much to make him happy when all he wants to do is live his own life.  Terry Farrell (TVs Star Trek: DS9 &amp; Becker) makes a good love interest for him too.  I always knew she'd make a name for herself one day.  Of course you can't make this sort of film without the bad guys and both father and son have each of their own: William Zabka (who we all should remember as bad boy Johnnie from The Karate Kid) as Chas, the snotty swim diver, and Paxton Whitehead as Philip Barbay, Thornton's economics professor are both out to give our duo a not so sweet time at college.  But with Sally Kellerman as the funloving literature teacher, Diane, helping Thornton with reading (and biology) just made things a whole lot more fun.  This film has such a great mix of comic chemistry and one-liners that you may miss after the first viewing from laughing so hard.  But it's also a movie that just makes you feel good when it's all over.The DVD isn't much on special features, only a trailer, which has a scene not in the film of Thornton and his bodyguard, Lou (Burt Young of the &quot;Rocky&quot; movies as Paulie) looking at a college sex book (&quot;Well, they left out the most important thing...where to get it&quot;).  But at least they give you a letterboxed version (1.85:1) as well as a full framed version.  But for the asking price, this disc is worth it.  Maybe someday they'll get the gang together and make a documentary and audio commentary.  Until then get this DVD.  I haven't seen the picture look this good in years.  The VHS pales in comparison.So, if you're tired of all the bland humor that seems to be coming out of the Hollywood machine these days, go Back To School with Rodney Dangerfield, who will show you just how funny Comedies should be.  &quot;Ooh, I'd love to tame your shrew!&quot;",5,Rodney's All Time Best Comedy Get's Straight A's!,991699200,"06 5, 2001",2001,3333,"['Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'miss', '80', 'movies', 'Back', 'School', 'A', 'film', 'starring', 'one', 'funniest', 'men', 'planet', 'Mr.', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'famous', 'names', 'unto', 'got', 'have', 'SMASH', 'MOVIE', 'written', 'simple', 'premise', 'Thornton', 'Melon', 'Dangerfield', 'become', 'wealthy', 'millionaire', 'even', 'dropped', 'high', 'school', 'now', 'son', 'Jason', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'drop', 'college', 'so', 'order', 'keep', 'leaving', 'Thornton', 'go', 'college', 'too', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'print', 'favorites', 'are', 'big', 'scene', 'Sam', 'Kinison', 'crazed', 'history', 'teacher', 'Professor', 'Terguson', 'quot', 'Good', 'teacher', 'really', 'care', 'what', 'have', 'idea', 'quot', 'Thornton', 'doing', 'Triple', 'Lindey', 'swimming', 'dive', 'Derek', '[', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', ']', 'distracting', 'rival', 'diving', 'team', 'loud', 'noise', 'reflecting', 'light', 'face', 'Thornton', 'rendition', 'quot', 'Twist', 'Shout', 'quot', 'local', 'bar', 'course', 'party', 'Thornton', 'dorm', 'room', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'band', 'Oingo', 'Boingo', 'killer', 'hot', 'tub', 'complete', 'BUBBLES', 'quot', 'Now', 'what', 'call', 'marine', 'biology', 'quot', 'truly', 'winning', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'great', 'heart', 'what', 'film', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Christine', 'who', 'sorely', 'missed', 'acting', 'world', 'changed', 'profession', 'directing', 'great', 'Thornton', 'son', 'Jason', 'who', 'father', 'lot', 'feels', 'Dad', 'always', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'make', 'happy', 'when', 'do', 'live', 'own', 'life', 'Terry', 'Farrell', 'TVs', 'Star', 'Trek', 'DS9', 'amp', 'Becker', 'good', 'love', 'interest', 'too', 'always', 'knew', ""'d"", 'make', 'name', 'one', 'day', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'sort', 'film', 'bad', 'guys', 'father', 'son', 'have', 'own', 'William', 'Zabka', 'who', 'should', 'remember', 'bad', 'boy', 'Johnnie', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Chas', 'snotty', 'swim', 'diver', 'Paxton', 'Whitehead', 'Philip', 'Barbay', 'Thornton', 'economics', 'professor', 'are', 'give', 'duo', 'not', 'so', 'sweet', 'time', 'college', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'funloving', 'literature', 'teacher', 'Diane', 'helping', 'Thornton', 'reading', 'biology', 'just', 'made', 'things', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'film', 'great', 'mix', 'comic', 'chemistry', 'one-liners', 'may', 'miss', 'first', 'viewing', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'also', 'movie', 'just', 'feel', 'good', 'when', 'over.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'much', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'trailer', 'scene', 'not', 'film', 'Thornton', 'bodyguard', 'Lou', 'Burt', 'Young', 'quot', 'Rocky', 'quot', 'movies', 'Paulie', 'looking', 'college', 'sex', 'book', 'quot', 'Well', 'left', 'out', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'where', 'get', 'quot', 'least', 'give', 'letterboxed', 'version', '1.85:1', 'as', 'well', 'full', 'framed', 'version', 'asking', 'price', 'disc', 'Maybe', 'someday', ""'ll"", 'get', 'gang', 'together', 'make', 'documentary', 'audio', 'commentary', 'then', 'get', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'picture', 'look', 'good', 'years', 'VHS', 'pales', 'comparison.So', ""'re"", 'tired', 'bland', 'humor', 'be', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'days', 'go', 'Back', 'School', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'who', 'will', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'Comedies', 'should', 'be', 'quot', 'Ooh', ""'d"", 'love', 'tame', 'shrew', 'quot']",Back To School

Schneider,"[11, 11]","Coming three years after making a big splash with his first-ever starring role, in the 1983 Horror classic CHRISTINE, Keith Gordon returned in this, the 1986 Comedy classic BACK TO SCHOOL, starring one of the most beloved comedians of all time, Rodney Dangerfield.The story actually begins in 1940, where young Thornton Meloni (Jason Hervey, who would become famous two years later as Fred Savage's older brother on the TV show &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;) is being exhorted by his immigrant father to stay in school and not to take over his tailoring business.  The kid ends up not listening to him and becomes a high school dropout, taking over the business and changing it to a &quot;Tall &amp; Fat Store&quot; while taking the &quot;i&quot; off the end of his last name and making a fortune.  The fifty-something adult Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield) is having an awful second marriage to Vanessa (Adrienne Barbeau in full vamp mode), but is proud of his college freshman son Jason (Keith Gordon), whom he thinks is in a popular fraternity and on the school's diving team.  Soon after arriving for a surprise visit, however, Jason admits the truth that he's not in a frat, is not popular and is, in fact,  the 'towel boy' for the diving team.  Jason wants to leave school because it's not going the way he thought it would.  The tall, beautiful Valerie (Terry Farrell) won't even notice him, and his roommate and only friend Derek (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a complete weirdo with wild hairstyles that appear to change daily.  Rich Dad has an idea: he'll enroll as a freshman himself and that will influence Jason to have a better time and to stay in school!After pulling some strings, including donating a huge sum for a brand-new School of Business (it is, after all, not everyday that a well-respected university will take on a student who never finished high school, even someone as rich as Thornton Melon), fun-loving Thornton proceeds to throw his weight around, changing Jason &amp; Derek's room into a plaza suite (complete with a hot tub), throwing awesome parties and even romancing his English professor (Sally Kellerman), much to the chagrin of her uptight boyfriend, Business professor Phillip Barbay (Paxton Whitehead), who would like nothing better than an excuse to drum the impudent Thornton Melon out of the university!  Meanwhile, Thornton uses his considerable influence on Coach Turnbull (M. Emmett Walsh) to let Jason officially join the squad, which upsets the snobby star diver Chas (William Zabka) who suddenly finds himself competing for his girlfriend Terry, who begins to take a liking to Jason.If this all sounds like too much plot for this 96-minute movie, let me just say that BACK TO SCHOOL makes very efficient use of its time (no slow points here), and equally good use of Mr. Dangerfield's comedic talents, that the plot itself is almost secondary to the one-liners Rodney uses in his usual self-deprecating way.  Plus, the cameos are real fun, especially Kurt Vonnegut Jr. as himself, being hired to write a paper for Jason about--what else?--Kurt Vonnegut Jr.!  The music is very upbeat 80's here (as you would expect for a movie of this type); however, it does mark the film scoring debut for Danny Elfman of Oingo Bongo who appears in the film (as themselves) performing their great classic &quot;Dead Man's Party&quot; (which, incidentally, had been on the soundtrack to WEIRD SCIENCE a year earlier).Even if certain occurrences are patently unbelievable, such as the oral exam scene late in the film, BACK TO SCHOOL is so much fun to watch that it doesn't matter what happens, just as long as Rodney's and Gordon's characters win in the end and make us laugh while doing it.  It is of definite interest to us Star Trek fans that Terry Farrell would eventually go on to play Lt. Dax on TV in &quot;Deep Space Nine.&quot;  Also, watch quickly for a cameo by Robert Picardo (who would join the aforementioned Jason Hervey two years later in &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; playing the dreaded Coach Cutlip, then later on joining Ms. Farrell in the Star Trek series in his wonderful role of the holographic Doctor) as the guy Thornton catches Vanessa fooling around with at a big party.  Oh, and Sam Kinison is hilarious in a small role, playing himself as a shell-shocked History professor who never quite came out of Vietnam.Everybody is great in this mid-80's comedy classic.  Lastly, you have to love a Rodney Dangerfield movie that features a university dean by the name of Dean Martin (the always-wonderful Ned Beatty).  BACK TO SCHOOL really takes us back to school on what a great film comedy should be.  Add this one to your DVD library! Even with the lack of a lot of extras, it's still very much worth it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5,Keith Gordon + College + Rodney Dangerfield = Comedy Classic,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,4774,"['Coming',

150453,ARFCORBCTKX1J,0792843991,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[8, 8]","Before getting to the film itself, I need to say something about the Blu-ray transfer. Though you can find the BD for substantially less than the price shown, you should be aware of the problems.The first is that the transfer is from a theatrical print. There's the occasional white speck -- and a rather big white chunk missing (briefly) during the oral-exam sequence. There are also occasional density fluctuations, not surprising in a DeLuxe print (which uses the same IB process as Technicolor). Second, in scenes with very dark backgrounds, the dark areas break up into squares -- not unlike poking your nose near a window screen. IMPORTANT  It turns out that this is a side-effect of having Sharpness turned up all the way, and is not a flaw in the transfer. See my review of ""Highlander"" for a detailed discussion.)On the other hand, the image is sharp and detailed, with no grain reduction. However, in the scene near the end where Jason is kissing Valerie, the grain on his over-lit forehead ""pops"" in a way that looks like an encoding artifact. In short, the transfer would have been better had the composite negative been used. But it's ""good enough"" that I can reasonably recommend it without feeling you're going to be badly disappointed.The film itself is one of those ""guilty pleasures"" one needn't feel guilty about. It's one of those rare comedies that's actually funny -- and from beginning to end. Dangerfield is funny simply standing there -- his face was its own caricature. The casting is well-nigh perfect, with actors you'd never expect in such a low-budget film. Sally Kellerman and Ned Beatty are standouts, with the latter demonstrating that he can pull off just about any role. (Read the cast list and be prepared to be surprised.)The writers aren't afraid to steal.
