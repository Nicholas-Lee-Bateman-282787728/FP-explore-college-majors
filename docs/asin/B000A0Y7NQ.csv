But I am glad to have gotten to seen it either way(even though I saw them live on this tour). I dont believe for a second though that they lip sync. You would have to pay extra attention to the fact that the audio doesnt quite sync up with the video cause for the most part it is on key.  They are for the most part a very professional, if not theatrical act. The real treat was the footage from the Last Rights, Too Dark Park, and ViViSectIV tours. That was great. Lots of travels and backstage stuff...the boys also knew how to party heh. It was good to see Dwayne Goettel too before his untimley passing. Skinny Puppy was a trio, and it was good to see the original band playing and touring together so this footage was much appreciated...aside from all the camera spinning/time warps, but I attribute that mostly to the fact that they were partying most of the time(I mean come on, they were in Belgium, Amsterdam, and such so they had the opportunity heh). But yeah enough of that. Bottom line, this performance was nowhere near as good as Aint It Dead Yet, so if you dont have any Puppy DVD's yet then start with that cause that show is a gem. That and I really wasnt fond of their latest album and hearing the songs live from The Greater Wrong Of The Right wasnt all too impressive...the rest of the song selection was good though, a lot of songs from ViViSectVI, and even two from The Process. All in all a great performance and a welcome return to the forefathers of electronic/industrial. Buy it if you have their other two DVD's. Skinny Puppy are still a great band even today and I hope to see another album done in their classic sample-ridden distorted glory!",4,The Bonus Features were the best part,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,1782,"['live', 'show', 'last', 'year', 'disc', 'one', 'have', 'editing', 'problems', 'disappointment', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'gotten', 'seen', 'way', 'even', 'saw', 'live', 'tour', 'dont', 'believe', 'second', 'lip', 'sync', 'would', 'have', 'pay', 'extra', 'attention', 'fact', 'audio', 'doesnt', 'quite', 'sync', 'up', 'video', 'cause', 'most', 'part', 'key', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'professional', 'not', 'theatrical', 'act', 'real', 'treat', 'was', 'footage', 'Last', 'Rights', 'Too', 'Dark', 'Park', 'ViViSectIV', 'tours', 'was', 'great', 'Lots', 'travels', 'backstage', 'stuff', 'boys', 'also', 'knew', 'how', 'party', 'heh', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Dwayne', 'Goettel', 'too', 'untimley', 'passing', 'Skinny', 'Puppy', 'was', 'trio', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'original', 'band', 'playing', 'touring', 'together', 'so', 'footage', 'was', 'much', 'appreciated', 'aside', 'camera', 'spinning/time', 'warps', 'attribute', 'mostly', 'fact', 'were', 'partying', 'most', 'time', 'mean', 'come', 'were', 'Belgium', 'Amsterdam', 'such', 'had', 'opportunity', 'heh', 'yeah', 'enough', 'Bottom', 'line', 'performance', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'Aint', 'Dead', 'Yet', 'so', 'dont', 'have', 'Puppy', 'DVD', 'yet', 'then', 'start', 'cause', 'show', 'gem', 'really', 'wasnt', 'fond', 'latest', 'album', 'hearing', 'songs', 'live', 'Greater', 'Wrong', 'Right', 'wasnt', 'all', 'too', 'impressive', 'rest', 'song', 'selection', 'was', 'good', 'lot', 'songs', 'ViViSectVI', 'even', 'two', 'Process', 'great', 'performance', 'welcome', 'return', 'forefathers', 'electronic/industrial', 'Buy', 'have', 'other', 'two', 'DVD', 'Skinny', 'Puppy', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'band', 'even', 'today', 'hope', 'see', 'album', 'done', 'classic', 'sample-ridden', 'distorted', 'glory']",N/A
918351,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B000A0Y7NQ,Matthew King,"[15, 20]","Before their reunion tour last fall of 2004 it had been a while since we heard anything from Canadian industrial legends Skinny Puppy.  Their 1996 release ""The Process"" flopped and was all but forgotten by anyone but the most ardent Puppy fans.  Simply put the band had not released anything worthwhile in 13 years, since 1991's ""Last Rights"".  Then came 2004's ""The greater wrong of the right"".  It was admittedly a different Skinny Puppy, more polished, dancey and catchy this time around but still undeniably the SP sound and a welcome return to form.  On the strength of that album, the band went on their first tour in years and wowed a new generation of Puppy fans who were too young to see them in their halcyon days.Disc one of this package combines the best elements of the tour's Montreal and Toronto shows in a 110 minute DVD.  The show opens up with ""Downsizer"", frontman Nivek Ogre strangely absent from the stage.  Then on track #2 ""L'immortal"" Ogre finally bursts on stage in an absolutely insane-looking costume and the fun begins.  From then on the band rip through classic track after classic track such as ""Warlock"", ""God's Gift Maggot"", ""Tin Omen"" and closing it out with the most classic track of all, ""Smothered Hope"".  Ogre is truly a sight to behold throughout the whole show, drenched in sweat and mud and blood and puss, screaming his head off like a mad banshee and looking no less energetic than he was in the band's prime years.I attended the Toronto show myself and I can honestly say this was one of the best shows I've ever seen.  What really struck me was the band's ability to put the audience in a trance, hypnotizing us with eye-popping images on the projector screen, flashing lights and creative stage theatrics.  I know all of Skinny Puppy's material and was sober (relatively so) that night yet it wasn't even about the music, the whole vibe of the show and the histrionics involved made me feel like I was having some sort of out-of-body experience.  If you were there too, you know what I'm talking about.Disc#2 opens up with a 30-minute documentary entitled ""Information Warfare"" about some of the devastating effects the war on Iraq has had on the Iraqi populace, as well as the American soldiers involved.  It's an interesting and well-made segment supported by eye-popping images and statistics although some of it comes across as Michael Moore-style propaganda.  I also couldn't help but wonder why it's even in there in the first place.  Skinny Puppy has never been an outwardly political type of band so why would they assume that its fans would be interested in watching something like this in the first place?  Plus let's not forget Skinny Puppy are Canadian so their constant Bush-bashing rings a bit hollow.  But then again maybe that's just me, I've never been a fan of musicians, movie actors and other celebrities force-feeding their political opinions on fans.The highlight of the second disc (and perhaps the whole package) is the 15 minutes of rare archival footage of the Too Dark Park and Last Rights tours, filmed by Jim Van Bebber (The Manson Family, Deadbeat at Dawn) and friends.  Although disc#2 is overall a bit of a mixed bag, this set remains absolutely essential for fans of the band.  It's about time we were treated to live Skinny Puppy on DVD, aside from the excellent but unfortunately almost impossible to find ""Ain't it dead yet"" DVD.

918352,ADTUS88NFTW23,B000A0Y7NQ,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[2, 4]","I really enjoy this DVD.  First off, the concert footage is great.  It captures the lights and effects of the live show wonderfully.  The sound is off the wall.  Skinny Puppy has always sounded a little better live.  I remember being a little unsure about ""The Greater Wrong of the Right"" CD until I had heard those songs performed at a concert.  It makes me hope that there will be a live album to accompany this release!A few other reviewers have mentioned problems.  I have to say that my opinion differs.  First, the reason that the band is barely shown for the first two songs is because that is how the live show was.  Ogre didn't even walk out on stage at the show I was at until half way into the second song.  Also, the vocal synchronization problems were not all that pervasive.  I don't think it's from a faulty DVD or mixing either.  Ogre uses copious amounts of vocal processing on his voice in order to get that characteristic demonic alien timbre to his voice.  On top of that, his voice is being fed into cEvin kEy's synthesizers and manipulated and warbled.  Of course it's not going to look right some of the time.  Finally, almost every live album is filmed over the course of several days.  I didn't even notice the difference while watching the DVD (and it's not nearly as bad as Ministry's Sphinctour DVD).I was a little disappointed with the extras.  First off, the ""Skinny Puppy Live in Europe 1986"" track has hardly any stage footage at all.  I watched about 15 minutes of it, and it was mostly footage of the band off stage going from gig to gig around Europe.  It was nice, and interesting, but I think the title of that track was a bit misleading.  There's only one song's worth of footage from Too Dark Park and Last Rites tours, but it's nice footage.  Also, ""Information Warfare"" was a piece about the war in Iraq.  I enjoyed it, but it seemed a little out of place on the DVD.Still, this is a great purchase for the Disc One concert alone.  The bonus stuff didn't completely blow me away, but that's why it's called a ""bonus"".  If you're a Skinny Puppy fan, then I think most people would like this.  It hasn't left my DVD player since I bought it.",5,A Wonderful DVD for any SP fan!,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,2180,"['really', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'First', 'concert', 'footage', 'great', 'lights', 'effects', 'live', 'show', 'wonderfully', 'sound', 'wall', 'Skinny', 'Puppy', 'always', 'sounded', 'little', 'better', 'live', 'remember', 'being', 'little', 'unsure', 'Greater', 'Wrong', 'Right', 'CD', 'had', 'heard', 'songs', 'performed', 'concert', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'live', 'album', 'accompany', 'release', 'few', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'problems', 'have', 'say', 'opinion', 'differs', 'First', 'reason', 'band', 'barely', 'shown', 'first', 'two', 'songs', 'how', 'live', 'show', 'was', 'Ogre', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'walk', 'out', 'stage', 'show', 'was', 'half', 'way', 'second', 'song', 'Also', 'vocal', 'synchronization', 'problems', 'were', 'not', 'pervasive', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'faulty', 'DVD', 'mixing', 'either', 'Ogre', 'copious', 'amounts', 'vocal', 'processing', 'voice', 'order', 'get', 'characteristic', 'demonic', 'alien', 'timbre', 'voice', 'top', 'voice', 'being', 'fed', 'cEvin', 'kEy', 'synthesizers', 'manipulated', 'warbled', 'course', 'not', 'going', 'look', 'right', 'time', 'Finally', 'almost', 'live', 'album', 'filmed', 'course', 'several', 'days', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'difference', 'watching', 'DVD', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'Ministry', 'Sphinctour', 'DVD', '.I', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'extras', 'First', 'Skinny', 'Puppy', 'Live', 'Europe', '1986', 'track', 'hardly', 'stage', 'footage', 'watched', '15', 'minutes', 'was', 'mostly', 'footage', 'band', 'off', 'stage', 'going', 'gig', 'gig', 'Europe', 'was', 'nice', 'interesting', 'think', 'title', 'track', 'was', 'bit', 'misleading', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'worth', 'footage', 'Too', 'Dark', 'Park', 'Last', 'Rites', 'tours', 'nice', 'footage', 'Also', 'Information', 'Warfare', 'was', 'piece', 'war', 'Iraq', 'enjoyed', 'seemed', 'little', 'place', 'DVD.Still', 'great', 'purchase', 'Disc', 'One', 'concert', 'alone', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'completely', 'blow', 'away', 'why', 'called', 'bonus', ""'re"", 'Skinny', 'Puppy', 'fan', 'then', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'like', ""n't"", 'left', 'DVD', 'player', 'bought']",N/A

It's interesting to see that SP didn't shy away from what they did during this show on this DVD release.  The staged decapitation is here as well as the singer pointing that toy gun at the video of the president as he stepped off the plane.  Because of what they did during this tour homeland security started watching them.  In Atlanta someone from the homeland security taskforce left them a card.  When word got about about the boycott group and the e-mails stared being sent out to radio stations several college stations decided to put their catalog in heavy rotation in protest.  It's nice to see that this PABAAH group have the complete opposite effect of what they intended and that free speech is still alive and well here in the good old US of A.

Wait till the end of Eurotrauma, and leave it on and the video will come on. The Pro Test video is the only part of the DVD that I hate. It has a very MTV feel to it. All it is is a bunch of Goths and Jocks break dancing. Skinny Puppy have made so many great music videos in the past. Convulsion, and Warlock are classics. Anyways the actually concert is top notch. It starts off not bad, but it ends up brilliant. Even if I wasn't a fan this would still be a entertaining live show. VX Gas Attack has to be one of my favorite parts. It is really awesome to see a band that focus's on real political issues instead of all the phony left vs right crap. If you read the screen during that song you will learn more about what is really going on than if you were to watch 5 Micheal Moore documentaries. Aside from that every song has a awesome theatrical show going on. I have only been a puppy fan for maybe 6 months, so I had no idea that they were so good live. The whole show reminded me of a Cradle of Filth concert. Only I still think that Cradles ""Heavy Left Handed and Candid"" is a better DVD. The bonus features are also top notch. The documentary is good.  If Skinny Puppy doesn't show it the corporate controlled lap dog mass media wont. The Eurotrauma footage is great. It was shot on a hand held video camera. Aside from that it was my first time to see the late great Goettel before his untimely demise. Pretty much the whole time they are getting stoned at hash bars in Amsterdam. I don't blame them.
