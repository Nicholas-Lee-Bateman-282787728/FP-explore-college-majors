Devon after finally bringing down the SUV with his Quarry discovers that his opponent is more then he appears to be, and that's an understatement. It turns out that he's a demon, and offers Devon a chance to give his sister her life back in exchange for him taking his. Devon cuts his throat, and his sister's life is restored only he discovers that now he's taken the demon's place and for each soul he guides to hell he gains knowledge and strength. Devon asks how long does he do this, and is told that its all up to him and no matter what happens or what situation he's in its all up to him. Devon meets up with different people from a grafitti artist named Poise, who receives voodoo like powers to punish any graffitti artist but abuses that power and is killed. Tex, a racist landlord who committed patricide while driving drunk who uses his black Vietnam vet tenants for labor until they revolt and kill him. And finally a hip hop duo that has a falling out, with the more desirable of the two responsible for killing his partner.All in all, its a good B-movie and worth watching.",4,there goes the neighborhood,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,1292,"['movie', 'place', 'Snopp', 'playing', 'gang', 'member', 'named', 'Devon', 'who', 'gun', 'beleiving', 'shooting', 'rival', 'out', 'be', 'sister', 'said', 'rival', 'running', 'gun', 'battle', 'Devon', 'finally', 'bringing', 'down', 'SUV', 'Quarry', 'discovers', 'opponent', 'more', 'then', 'be', 'understatement', 'out', 'demon', 'Devon', 'chance', 'give', 'sister', 'life', 'back', 'exchange', 'taking', 'Devon', 'throat', 'sister', 'life', 'restored', 'only', 'now', 'taken', 'demon', 'place', 'soul', 'hell', 'gains', 'knowledge', 'strength', 'Devon', 'how', 'long', 'do', 'told', 'up', 'matter', 'what', 'what', 'situation', 'up', 'Devon', 'up', 'different', 'people', 'grafitti', 'artist', 'named', 'Poise', 'who', 'voodoo', 'powers', 'punish', 'graffitti', 'artist', 'power', 'killed', 'Tex', 'racist', 'landlord', 'who', 'committed', 'patricide', 'driving', 'drunk', 'who', 'black', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'tenants', 'labor', 'revolt', 'kill', 'finally', 'hip', 'hop', 'duo', 'falling', 'out', 'more', 'desirable', 'two', 'responsible', 'killing', 'partner.All', 'good', 'B-movie', 'worth', 'watching']",Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror

Although it's not as good or as memorable, Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror reminded me of Tales from the Hood. HoH has over-the-top gore, bizarre characters, and a fast pace throughout all three of the stories found in this anthology. But it also has some bad acting, the stories weren't as effective or scary as they could've been, and it doesn't have a ""wow"" factor, aside from the gore. What I'm trying to say is: this movie is fun and enjoyable if you have an open mind and it's definitely a time-killer.There are better horror anthologies out there (Trick R' Treat, Tales From The Hood), but this one wasn't as bad as people make it out to be.

1093547,A162WHMOFG6H5T,B000U34SS2,Rod Hansen,"[13, 14]","OK, ya gotta keep it in perspective when viewing a movie like this: The creators of a film calling itself SNOOP DOGG'S HOOD OF HORROR probably aren't wondering which outfits they'll wear to the Academy Awards ceremony.Now here's a shock, and for some it might even be a spoiler: As intentionally cheap and tawdry as this film is, it's a good movie overall, and one of its three chapters is flat-out great.Set up as a ""Tales from the Crypt""-style anthology, the movie's prevailing moral theme (and, yes, there is a prevailing moral theme to SNOOP DOGG'S HOOD OF HORROR) is that a person's actions on Earth, in the 'hood, can effect their existence in the afterlife.The first of the episodes is about a female grafitti artist who takes revenge on some neighborhood roughs through supernatural means. Daniella Alonso shines in the leading role. She has confidence and screen presence, and delivers her lines with the clarity of a true pro. However, the segment suffers from shoddy special effects, and could confirm viewers' suspicion that this is a direct-to-video quality release. Still, when one thug impales his own head on a 40-oz. bottle, it's pretty hilarious to hear Alonso intone, ""What a waste...of beer.""The second chapter, titled ""The Scumlord,"" is a first-rate social satire with performances that actually do deserve the Oscar consideration they will never get.The story involves Tex Jr., the spoiled son of a real estate tycoon who inherits (through patricide) his father's property. In this role, Anson Mount is sheer comic genius, delivering polically incorrect lines that will literally make you gasp before laughing your head off.Tex Jr. is now the landlord of a building housing a group of African-American Vietnam War veterans. He brings along his wife Tiffany (Brande Roderick, who also gives an inspired performance), and essentially uses his aging tenants as slave labor to renovate the house. Tex Jr. is unabashedly racist, regularly refering to his black tenants as ""boy."" Ernie Hudson, as the outraged tenant Roscoe, turns in a heartfelt performance that resonates with dignity and class.View HOOD OF HORRORS for no other reason than ""The Scumlord,"" which is a genuine must-see.The third and final chapter concerns a rap duo similar to OutKast, where the tubby yet prodigiously talented half receives far less adoration than his sleeker, sexier partner (aw, jeeze, the scriptwriters might as well have CALLED this band ""OutKast"".) Jason Alexander turns up as a label executive (possibly to prove that not ALL ex-Seinfeld cast members are racist pigs), but the segment as a whole is probably the worst of the bunch.I would recommend HOOD OF HORRORS solely on the strengths of ""The Scumlord,"" though the entire movie is fun to watch and allows those of us in lily-white suburbia a chance to pick up some fly gangsta slang.",4,Don't Believe the Haters - It's All Good in the Hood,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,2844,"['OK', 'ya', 'got', 'ta', 'keep', 'perspective', 'when', 'viewing', 'movie', 'creators', 'film', 'calling', 'SNOOP', 'DOGG', 'HOOD', 'OF', 'HORROR', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'wondering', ""'ll"", 'wear', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'ceremony.Now', 'here', 'shock', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'spoiler', 'intentionally', 'cheap', 'tawdry', 'film', 'good', 'movie', 'overall', 'one', 'three', 'chapters', 'flat-out', 'great.Set', 'up', 'Tales', 'Crypt', '-style', 'anthology', 'movie', 'prevailing', 'moral', 'theme', 'yes', 'prevailing', 'moral', 'theme', 'SNOOP', 'DOGG', 'HOOD', 'OF', 'HORROR', 'person', 'actions', 'Earth', ""'hood"", 'can', 'effect', 'existence', 'afterlife.The', 'first', 'episodes', 'female', 'grafitti', 'artist', 'who', 'revenge', 'neighborhood', 'roughs', 'supernatural', 'means', 'Daniella', 'Alonso', 'shines', 'leading', 'role', 'confidence', 'screen', 'presence', 'lines', 'clarity', 'true', 'pro', 'However', 'segment', 'suffers', 'shoddy', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'confirm', 'viewers', 'suspicion', 'direct-to-video', 'quality', 'release', 'Still', 'when', 'one', 'thug', 'own', 'head', '40-oz', 'bottle', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'hear', 'Alonso', 'intone', 'What', 'waste', 'beer', 'second', 'chapter', 'titled', 'Scumlord', 'first-rate', 'social', 'satire', 'performances', 'actually', 'do', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'will', 'never', 'get.The', 'story', 'Tex', 'Jr.', 'spoiled', 'son', 'real', 'estate', 'tycoon', 'who', 'patricide', 'father', 'property', 'role', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'sheer', 'comic', 'genius', 'delivering', 'polically', 'incorrect', 'lines', 'will', 'literally', 'make', 'gasp', 'laughing', 'head', 'Jr.', 'now', 'landlord', 'building', 'housing', 'group', 'African-American', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'veterans', 'wife', 'Tiffany', 'Brande', 'Roderick', 'who', 'also', 'inspired', 'performance', 'essentially', 'aging', 'tenants', 'slave', 'labor', 'renovate', 'house', 'Tex', 'Jr.', 'unabashedly', 'racist', 'regularly', 'refering', 'black', 'tenants', 'boy', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'outraged', 'tenant', 'Roscoe', 'heartfelt', 'performance', 'dignity', 'class.View', 'HOOD', 'OF', 'HORRORS', 'other', 'reason', 'Scumlord', 'genuine', 'must-see.The', 'third', 'final', 'chapter', 'concerns', 'rap', 'duo', 'similar', 'OutKast', 'where', 'tubby', 'yet', 'prodigiously', 'talented', 'half', 'far', 'less', 'adoration', 'sleeker', 'sexier', 'partner', 'aw', 'jeeze', 'scriptwriters', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'CALLED', 'band', 'OutKast', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'up', 'label', 'executive', 'possibly', 'prove', 'not', 'ex-Seinfeld', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'racist', 'pigs', 'segment', 'whole', 'probably', 'worst', 'bunch.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'HOOD', 'OF', 'HORRORS', 'solely', 'strengths', 'Scumlord', 'entire', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'lily-white', 'suburbia', 'chance', 'pick', 'up', 'fly', 'gangsta', 'slang']",Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror
1093548,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000U34SS2,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 6]","*1/2The ""trilogy of terror"" has been a horror movie staple ever since Vincent Price made a name for himself in the 1960's starring in all those Roger Corman adaptations of Edgar Allen Poe short stories.  Now, 40 years later, director Stacy Title is attempting to carry on that tradition with ""Snoop Dogg`s Hood of Horror,"" as dimwitted and cheapjack a B-movie travesty as we`ve come across in quite some time.Acting as a sort of gangsta' rap version of Elvira, Snoop Dogg serves as the host of the show, introducing us to the three stories, then providing a sermonizing moral as wrap-up when each of them is finished.  The first episode, entitled ""Crossed Out,"" tells of a young woman given the power to supernaturally exterminate all the graffiti artists in her neighborhood simply by spray-painting a giant red x through their work.  The second entry, ""The Scumlord,"" is a parodic tale of a group of grizzled Vietnam vets who turn the tables on their racist landlord.  The third, ""Rapsody Askew,"" is a confused account of a rap star forced to face divine judgment for the error-filled life he's led.Despite the movie's title, there isn't a single suspenseful moment in any of the segments, which, when taken together, feel like a trio of under-conceived and under-nourished rejects from the old ""Twilight Zone"" series.  As the two ""name"" players in the cast, Billy Dee Williams and Jason Alexander are literally the only things separating ""Hood of Horror"" from your average amateur movie shot in someone's backyard on 8-millimeter.

1093549,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B000U34SS2,Stuart Conover,"[0, 1]","I know I generally jump directly into the director and writing information but this one is going to need a small bit of introduction first due to the amount of writers involved. Why are there so many writers? Well this was filmed in the style of Creepshow. If you haven't seen the 2 Creepshow films (you are truly missing out on a couple classic pieces of horror being the case) than think more along the lines of novels. What kind of novels? Anthology novel! The Creepshow series and now the Hood of Horror are anthologies of mini-horror films that are put together and told by a single narrator and in this case it is played by Snoop Dogg himself.The films are directed by Stacy Title who has had a few films previous and a few after but is not a high profile director. After seeing the Hood of Horror you have to hope she gets a shot at a big budget horror film to see what she can put together as each of these shorts had its own piece of charm you couldn't help to enjoy. The first film Crossed out was written by Jacob Hair (whose done a large mixture of smaller horror films and television) and Tim Sullivan (who again worked with quite a few movies.) The second film, The Scumlord, was also written by Tim Sullivan as well as Chris Kobin (who worked on a few projects with Tim.) Finally the third film, Rapsody Askew was written by Jonathan McHugh and while this is his only writing credit he has done music for a lot of movies including Repo! The Genetic Opera and Saw 2. Now while each of these 3 short movies are a fun watch, unlike Creepshow which it's clearly based upon, it's hard to think of any of the three as scary.Crossed Out is the story about a woman whose neighborhood is overrun with gang members and while she attempts to be a tough woman by spray painting over their `tagging' to get back at them all they do is end up trying to kill her. She ends up making a pact to gain satanic powers to be able to end the gang warfare though in the end is guilty of committing the same acts that they do and have to suffer the same fate she had inflicted upon the gang members.The second story The Scumlord is about a redneck who inherits his father's condo that is being rented out on the cheap to veterans he had gone to war with earlier in his life. The redneck and his wife are racist bastards and treat the tenants like second class citizens though both end up getting exactly what is coming to them when they find out what the couple have done to a nurse that has been taking care of them.The third and final story is Rapsody Askew about a rapper who sold his soul to become the best rapper in the world. Along the way he had both friends and enemies taken care of and his best friend who was holding him back has come back to teach him a lesson and let him know the time has come to pay his debt.My suggestion when it comes to this one? Go pickup the original 2 Creepshow films if you want a horror anthology. If you're looking for a way to kill an afternoon you can pick this up but don't expect any real scares. I'd also suggest turning this into a drinking game with friends which would make it doubly enjoyable.",2,"I love anthology movies, when all of the short stories work",1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,3135,"['know', 'generally', 'jump', 'directly', 'director', 'writing', 'information', 'one', 'going', 'need', 'small', 'bit', 'introduction', 'first', 'due', 'amount', 'writers', 'involved', 'Why', 'are', 'there', 'so', 'many', 'writers', 'Well', 'was', 'filmed', 'style', 'Creepshow', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '2', 'Creepshow', 'films', 'are', 'truly', 'missing', 'out', 'couple', 'classic', 'pieces', 'horror', 'being', 'case', 'think', 'more', 'lines', 'novels', 'What', 'kind', 'novels', 'Anthology', 'novel', 'Creepshow', 'series', 'now', 'Hood', 'Horror', 'are', 'anthologies', 'mini-horror', 'films', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'told', 'single', 'narrator', 'case', 'played', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'himself.The', 'films', 'are', 'directed', 'Stacy', 'Title', 'who', 'had', 'few', 'films', 'previous', 'few', 'not', 'high', 'profile', 'director', 'seeing', 'Hood', 'Horror', 'have', 'hope', 'shot', 'big', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'shorts', 'had', 'own', 'piece', 'charm', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'first', 'film', 'Crossed', 'out', 'was', 'written', 'Jacob', 'Hair', 'done', 'large', 'mixture', 'smaller', 'horror', 'films', 'television', 'Tim', 'Sullivan', 'who', 'again', 'worked', 'few', 'movies', 'second', 'film', 'Scumlord', 'was', 'also', 'written', 'Tim', 'Sullivan', 'as', 'well', 'Chris', 'Kobin', 'who', 'worked', 'few', 'projects', 'Tim', 'Finally', 'third', 'film', 'Rapsody', 'Askew', 'was', 'written', 'Jonathan', 'McHugh', 'only', 'writing', 'credit', 'done', 'music', 'lot', 'movies', 'including', 'Repo', 'Genetic', 'Opera', 'Saw', '2', 'Now', '3', 'short', 'movies', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'Creepshow', 'clearly', 'based', 'hard', 'think', 'three', 'scary.Crossed', 'Out', 'story', 'woman', 'neighborhood', 'overrun', 'gang', 'members', 'be', 'tough', 'woman', 'spray', 'painting', 'tagging', 'get', 'back', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'trying', 'kill', 'up', 'making', 'pact', 'gain', 'satanic', 'powers', 'be', 'able', 'end', 'gang', 'warfare', 'end', 'guilty', 'committing', 'same', 'acts', 'do', 'have', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'had', 'inflicted', 'gang', 'members.The', 'second', 'story', 'Scumlord', 'redneck', 'who', 'father', 'condo', 'being', 'rented', 'out', 'cheap', 'veterans', 'had', 'gone', 'war', 'earlier', 'life', 'redneck', 'wife', 'are', 'racist', 'bastards', 'treat', 'tenants', 'second', 'class', 'citizens', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'exactly', 'what', 'coming', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'couple', 'have', 'done', 'nurse', 'been', 'taking', 'care', 'them.The', 'third', 'final', 'story', 'Rapsody', 'Askew', 'rapper', 'who', 'sold', 'soul', 'become', 'best', 'rapper', 'world', 'way', 'had', 'friends', 'enemies', 'taken', 'care', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'holding', 'back', 'come', 'back', 'teach', 'lesson', 'let', 'know', 'time', 'come', 'pay', 'debt.My', 'suggestion', 'when', 'one', 'Go', 'pickup', 'original', '2', 'Creepshow', 'films', 'want', 'horror', 'anthology', ""'re"", 'looking', 'way', 'kill', 'afternoon', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'real', 'scares', ""'d"", 'also', 'suggest', 'turning', 'drinking', 'game', 'friends', 'would', 'make', 'doubly', 'enjoyable']",Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror
