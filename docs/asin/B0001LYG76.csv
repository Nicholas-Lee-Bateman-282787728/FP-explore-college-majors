810352,A3T52F3ZLW1SLZ,B0001LYG76,Dale E. Wynn,"[12, 12]","Andre Rieu is one of the finest entertainers in the world. I have all of his released DVDs and many of his CDs. The CD ""Romantic Moments"" is my very favorite. Unfortunately, the DVD ""Romantic Moments"" leaves out many of the songs on the CD. Spharenkland (Music of the Spheres) my absolute favorite of all the songs Rieu has done, is minimally played in the background at the beginning. It is a quite long tune but it is played only 52 seconds as background music at the beginning of the DVD. Andre talks a lot in this one, but not in the informative way he does in ""Dreaming"". Still, it is a quite worth while DVD and I would recommend it to anyone. Naturally, one must love beautiful music of the Strauss era to enjoy this recording.",5,Another fine Andre Rieu DVD,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,734,"['Andre', 'Rieu', 'one', 'finest', 'entertainers', 'world', 'have', 'released', 'DVDs', 'many', 'CDs', 'CD', 'Romantic', 'Moments', 'very', 'favorite', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'Romantic', 'Moments', 'out', 'many', 'songs', 'CD', 'Spharenkland', 'Music', 'Spheres', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'songs', 'Rieu', 'done', 'minimally', 'played', 'background', 'beginning', 'quite', 'long', 'tune', 'played', 'only', '52', 'seconds', 'background', 'music', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'Andre', 'lot', 'one', 'not', 'informative', 'way', 'Dreaming', 'Still', 'quite', 'worth', 'DVD', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'Naturally', 'must', 'love', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Strauss', 'era', 'enjoy', 'recording']",N/A

You get to see Andre playing up front, and it has more classical selections. In his recent performances, he is sometimes lost among the performers and the orchestra or among mutiple, switching camera angles and shots of the public. While the Johann Strauss Orchestra is wonderful and an integral part of Andre's success, it's nice to have the focus on Andre. I watch this DVD over and over because I enjoy the sound of Andre's violin and his expressions while he plays.",5,A Chance to See Andre as Soloist,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,607,"['footage', '1998', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'buying', 'Romantic', 'Moments', 'enjoy', 'Andre', 'Rieu', 'solo', 'performances', 'get', 'see', 'Andre', 'playing', 'up', 'front', 'more', 'classical', 'selections', 'recent', 'performances', 'sometimes', 'lost', 'performers', 'orchestra', 'mutiple', 'switching', 'camera', 'angles', 'shots', 'public', 'Johann', 'Strauss', 'Orchestra', 'wonderful', 'integral', 'part', 'Andre', 'success', 'nice', 'have', 'focus', 'Andre', 'watch', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'sound', 'Andre', 'violin', 'expressions']",N/A
