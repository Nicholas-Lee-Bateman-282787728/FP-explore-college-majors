579325,A33C5WFMAKRYU9,B00005AW00,M. Bell,"[12, 13]","This movie starring Benjamin Bratt has something for lovers of action, drama, and suspense movies. Based on a short story by Hemingway, the screenplay is written (updated and improved) by one of his main friends and biographers A.E. Hotchner. This is a rare case where the movie is actually much better than the literature it is based on. The basic plot hook is two couples working together to uncover the treasure on a recently sunken ship. Greed and mixed affinities between the couples lead to all kinds of plot twists that make the ending an unpredictable surprise. Of course getting there is all the fun. This film is little known about because it was an independent film released a few years back. Don't be put off though, this movie is definitely worth it!

579327,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B00005AW00,Scott FS,"[8, 10]","There must be something in the languid air of the Caribbean that just brings out the worst in people.Benjamin Bratt stars as Arno, a down-on-his-luck knock-about who runs an errand for a rich woman who lives on a luxury yacht.  He's set up, though, and only help from friends saves him from the crooked authorities.His love interest is Conquina, played by the stunning Mili Avital.  He finds a sunken boat he had a connection with, and, with Conquina, plans to salvage the vessel before it can be found by the authorities.  They're ill-equipped, though, and help (in a way) comes from the shady Jean-Pierre (Armand Assante) with his partner Janine (Simone-Elise Girard).The sultry sun, the warm ocean, sunken treasure (and a hungry shark) makes for some back-and-forth intrigue that keeps you guessing.  There are several twists and turns, including the reappearance of characters we thought were gone.The sexy undertones of the film, combined with the beautiful Caribbean sunsets, islands and lapping waves make this an above-average film.Recommended, especially those susceptable to tales of treasure, the moody life before World War II, and scheming lovers, supposed lovers, and relationships of convenience.Look for Jennifer Beals of ""Flashdance"" fame in a small role of Mrs. GavotteThree-and-one half to four stars.",4,Exciting movie with twists and turns galore,1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,1320,"['must', 'be', 'something', 'languid', 'air', 'Caribbean', 'just', 'out', 'worst', 'people.Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Arno', 'down-on-his-luck', 'knock-about', 'who', 'errand', 'rich', 'woman', 'who', 'luxury', 'yacht', 'set', 'up', 'only', 'help', 'friends', 'saves', 'crooked', 'authorities.His', 'love', 'interest', 'Conquina', 'played', 'stunning', 'Mili', 'Avital', 'sunken', 'boat', 'had', 'connection', 'Conquina', 'salvage', 'vessel', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'authorities', ""'re"", 'ill-equipped', 'help', 'way', 'shady', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'partner', 'Janine', 'Simone-Elise', 'Girard', '.The', 'sultry', 'sun', 'warm', 'ocean', 'sunken', 'treasure', 'hungry', 'shark', 'back-and-forth', 'intrigue', 'guessing', 'are', 'several', 'twists', 'turns', 'including', 'reappearance', 'characters', 'thought', 'were', 'gone.The', 'sexy', 'undertones', 'film', 'combined', 'beautiful', 'Caribbean', 'sunsets', 'islands', 'lapping', 'waves', 'make', 'above-average', 'film.Recommended', 'especially', 'susceptable', 'tales', 'treasure', 'moody', 'life', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'scheming', 'lovers', 'supposed', 'lovers', 'relationships', 'convenience.Look', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'Flashdance', 'fame', 'small', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'GavotteThree-and-one', 'half', 'four', 'stars']",After The Storm
