I own the MTV Power Yoga and that's one of the reasons I was prompted to buy MTV Pilates.  The instructor gets a tad annoying at times when she repeats how many sets to go.

793428,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B00015GA9E,Colleen M. Schneider,"[1, 2]","I am a daily exerciser and do pilates once or twice per week.  I found this work out to be very well done.  The instructor, Kristin McGee had good form, showed variations for beginner, intermediate and advanced exercisers and was not too ""chatty"".  I like that, show me the exercise and let's just get on with it!  She incorporates many of the classic pilates moves, such as the teaser, the mermaid, rolling like a ball, roll-overs and some other moves that are ones I was not familiar with but were good stretches.I enjoyed the workout and felt like as an intermediate exerciser in Pilates I could follow the moves and still felt challenged.  I would caution if you have NEVER done Pilates to try a beginner dvd to start off with or one that illustrates the beginner versions more clearly (Mari Windsor's videos are good in this area as you can see all three exercisers clearly in frame). Also, if you are not so flexible in the morning, be careful with moves such as the roll-over where you are pushing your legs back behind your head.  You may find yourself not as flexible at some points of your day and may need to modify or cut this part out.  As someone already familiar with Pilates I found this to be a good dvd and I also enjoyed the outdoor setting at the Pointe Hilton in Phoenix, AZ.The dvd runs 39 minutes and is a perfect length for a lighter work-out day.",5,A good intermediate pilates workout....,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,1371,"['am', 'daily', 'exerciser', 'do', 'pilates', 'once', 'twice', 'week', 'found', 'work', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'instructor', 'Kristin', 'McGee', 'had', 'good', 'form', 'showed', 'variations', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'chatty', 'show', 'exercise', 'let', 'just', 'get', 'many', 'classic', 'moves', 'such', 'teaser', 'mermaid', 'rolling', 'ball', 'roll-overs', 'other', 'moves', 'are', 'ones', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'were', 'good', 'stretches.I', 'enjoyed', 'workout', 'felt', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'Pilates', 'could', 'follow', 'moves', 'still', 'felt', 'challenged', 'would', 'caution', 'have', 'NEVER', 'done', 'try', 'beginner', 'dvd', 'start', 'off', 'one', 'beginner', 'versions', 'more', 'clearly', 'Mari', 'Windsor', 'videos', 'are', 'good', 'area', 'can', 'see', 'three', 'exercisers', 'clearly', 'frame', 'Also', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'flexible', 'morning', 'be', 'careful', 'moves', 'such', 'roll-over', 'where', 'are', 'pushing', 'legs', 'back', 'head', 'may', 'find', 'not', 'flexible', 'points', 'day', 'may', 'need', 'modify', 'cut', 'part', 'out', 'someone', 'already', 'familiar', 'Pilates', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'dvd', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'outdoor', 'setting', 'Pointe', 'Hilton', 'Phoenix', 'AZ.The', 'dvd', '39', 'minutes', 'perfect', 'length', 'lighter', 'work-out', 'day']",MTV Pilates
793429,A2QY40NORUET1T,B00015GA9E,C. Smoot,"[1, 3]","I really do enjoy the actual workout performed in this DVD.  There were some traditional pilates moves (the hundred, series of five, saw, etc) but she also added variations to other moves.  And three levels of intensity are shown which was really nice.  One draw back was Kristin's continual ""coaching"" thru each move which tended to be a bit distracting.  Through each move she would say ""inhale up, exhale down, inhale up, exhale down"" and so on.  It would have better if she didn't do that each time and threw some other sayings in there instead of inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, etc.",3,Nice change,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,588,"['really', 'do', 'enjoy', 'actual', 'workout', 'performed', 'DVD', 'were', 'traditional', 'pilates', 'moves', 'hundred', 'series', 'five', 'saw', 'etc', 'also', 'added', 'variations', 'other', 'moves', 'three', 'levels', 'intensity', 'are', 'shown', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'One', 'draw', 'back', 'was', 'Kristin', 'continual', 'coaching', 'move', 'tended', 'be', 'bit', 'distracting', 'move', 'would', 'say', 'inhale', 'up', 'exhale', 'down', 'inhale', 'up', 'exhale', 'down', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'time', 'threw', 'other', 'sayings', 'instead', 'inhale', 'exhale', 'inhale', 'exhale', 'etc']",MTV Pilates
793430,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,B00015GA9E,Feles31,"[5, 5]","I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.pros: Overall, I at least worked up a mild sweat.  Instructor counted pretty much the whole way through which was a nice change (vs just relying on following the beat of the music.)  Overall, second routine was better than the first, and bonus routine was better than either real routine with just the instructor doing (what seems to me) more traditional pilates moves.cons: Totally frustrating camera angles were a mess and prevented you from seeing what you needed to see.  At one point, they focused on people's hands(!) --- totally pointless --- or partial shots of people so you couldn't see the full pose.  Instructor facing forward was just not helpful either and the multitude of people in the back were just distracting.  They tell you to watch W for easy and X and Y for intermediate and Z for advanced.  Totally confusing.  Would have been better off color coding their outfits and putting a legend on the screen or something.  The first routine felt like it was all poses facing down which made it pretty impossible to watch the screen (probably why she had to count throughout) but most of the moves were good and after doing the routine a few times it probably wouldn't matter.  There were too many useless moves interspersed in the harder moves like bicep curls or moving your arms overhead or behind.  For myself, unless you are in physical therapy or something, I find those totally pointless, or you would have to pick up some weights to make it worthwhile (this workout does not require any equipment.)So glad I got this from netflix instead of buying.

It is led by Kristin McGee, she has 3 others doing the workout with her, Joy who does the beginner modifications, Jess who does intermediate and Kari, who along with Kristin does the advanced.  It is filmed in a very prettyArizona mountain setting adorned with colorful flowers.This routine has more emphasis on abs than anything, but it has a good variety of pilates moves.  You will see all the basics, the hundred, rollup, leg circles, rolling like a ball, single and double leg stretch, oblique criss-crosses which focus on abs, then there are some leg exercises such as frontal and side kicks, and other leg lifts.  But you will also see more difficult exercises such as the teaser, rollover, neck pull, open leg rocker, side planks and traditional planks. The saw, tick tocks (knee drops), spinal twists are other exercises you will see also. There is not a lot of time between exercises, you move through the routine quickly. Kristin gives great instruction though and lets you know when to inhale and exhale, which is helpful for those fairly new to pilates like myself.There is some background music which you can hear but it is faint. I personally liked the music and thought it fit the workout well. There is an option on the DVD to pick either just the music or the instructor if you choose.  There is also a bonus section where Kristin will breakdown some of the more challenging exercises which is helpful.Kristin McGee is an excellent instructor, she is pleasant, not overly perky but friendly and encouraging.
