860854,A2BC9TW5GO4XJR,B000650M7A,Celia DLF,"[1, 1]",Widescreen B Western with some A-list actors.  A bunch of thieves hole up in an abandoned town threatened by warpathing  Apaches.  Not much action till the very end.  Rather talky but OK.  Beautiful photography and color.  No frills and no extras on the DVD-R.  It would have been nice to have included the trailer.  Otherwise not bad Western and a great DVD-R.  Recommended for Western fans.,4,Quantez (1957),1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,392,"['Widescreen', 'B', 'Western', 'A-list', 'actors', 'bunch', 'thieves', 'hole', 'up', 'abandoned', 'town', 'threatened', 'warpathing', 'Apaches', 'Not', 'much', 'action', 'very', 'end', 'talky', 'OK.', 'Beautiful', 'photography', 'color', 'frills', 'extras', 'DVD-R', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'included', 'trailer', 'Otherwise', 'not', 'bad', 'Western', 'great', 'DVD-R', 'Recommended', 'Western', 'fans']",Quantez

I expected more than long philosophical discussion what is good an evil. Too much talk. One pretty much knows how everything will turn out. The actors do their best, but the story is weak.",2,Something went wrong,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,263,"['was', 'slow', 'tedious', 'western', 'MacMurray', 'not', 'hero', 'taste', 'expected', 'more', 'long', 'philosophical', 'discussion', 'what', 'good', 'evil', 'Too', 'much', 'talk', 'One', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'everything', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'story', 'weak']",Quantez

860857,AQTPOBTZYG28O,B000650M7A,Robin,"[2, 3]","Contrary to what one ""reviewer"" has written, Quantez is a fairly good Western although certainly no great classic. Most major Western enthusiasts will enjoy this movie.The DVD-R is quite good with stable images, good colour and considerable definition. Obviously the price of this DVD-R is quite high for a ""bare-bones"" disc with no ""extras"" but I'm glad I bought it. Fans of Westerns or Fred MacMurray will probably be pleased with this disc.",4,Quantez on DVD-R,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,443,"['Contrary', 'what', 'one', 'reviewer', 'written', 'Quantez', 'fairly', 'good', 'Western', 'certainly', 'great', 'classic', 'Most', 'major', 'Western', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie.The', 'DVD-R', 'quite', 'good', 'stable', 'images', 'good', 'colour', 'considerable', 'definition', 'Obviously', 'price', 'DVD-R', 'quite', 'high', 'bare-bones', 'disc', 'extras', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'Fans', 'Westerns', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'pleased', 'disc']",Quantez
860858,A3BMRSE8N1858V,B000650M7A,Terence Allen,"[11, 11]","Quantez was one of a number of Westerns made by Fred MacMurray during the 1950's. MacMurray had long been a popular star in Hollywood, but his career had begun to decline, and even though he was already one of the wealthiest, if not the wealthiest actor in Hollywood, he continued to soldier on films and television plays until his career was resurrected by his work in the live action Disney films like The Shaggy Dog and The Absent-Minded Professor and the hit television show My Three Sons. And MacMurray later said that he didn't feel comfortable in Westerns, adding that ""I didn't feel one with the horse.""Well, Quantez belies those feelings, and along with movies like Good Day For A Hanging, At Gunpoint, and Day of The Bad Man, prove that Fred MacMurray conquered this genre as he did with every other genre he tried. In Quantez, MacMurray plays one of five desperate people looking for a way out. They are four bandits who just robbed a bank which led to a murder. Fleeing a pursuing posse, they head toward the Mexican town of Quantez, figuring to hide out until the coast is clear. The group consists of the ringleader, played by John Larch, Larch's girlfriend, played by Dorothy Malone, a young and obviously inexperienced would-be desperado, played by John Gavin, a white man raised by Indians, played by Sydney Chaplin, and MacMurray, the cool and steady professional.The group finds Quantez deserted, not knowing that the govenrment has withdrawn their troops and Apaches have taken over the surrounding territory with the intention of killing any whites who stay too long in the area. As the group deals with uneasiness and internecine rivalry, the Indians begin to close in.MacMurray is very believable in his role as he tries to keep the peace and figure out a plan before it's too late. The rest of the cast are good as well, and Quantez ends up being very enjoyable and entertaining. Another great Western candidate for DVD release, as are MacMurray's Westerns At Gunpoint and Day of The Bad Man.",4,Standout Fred MacMurray Western,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,2016,"['Quantez', 'was', 'one', 'number', 'Westerns', 'made', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', '1950', 'MacMurray', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'popular', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'had', 'begun', 'decline', 'even', 'was', 'already', 'one', 'wealthiest', 'not', 'wealthiest', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'continued', 'soldier', 'films', 'television', 'plays', 'career', 'was', 'resurrected', 'work', 'live', 'action', 'Disney', 'films', 'Shaggy', 'Dog', 'Absent-Minded', 'Professor', 'hit', 'television', 'show', 'My', 'Three', 'Sons', 'MacMurray', 'later', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'comfortable', 'Westerns', 'adding', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'one', 'horse', 'Well', 'Quantez', 'feelings', 'movies', 'Good', 'Day', 'A', 'Hanging', 'Gunpoint', 'Day', 'Bad', 'Man', 'prove', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'conquered', 'genre', 'did', 'other', 'genre', 'tried', 'Quantez', 'MacMurray', 'one', 'five', 'desperate', 'people', 'looking', 'way', 'out', 'are', 'four', 'bandits', 'who', 'just', 'robbed', 'bank', 'led', 'murder', 'Fleeing', 'pursuing', 'posse', 'head', 'Mexican', 'town', 'Quantez', 'figuring', 'hide', 'out', 'coast', 'clear', 'group', 'ringleader', 'played', 'John', 'Larch', 'Larch', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'young', 'obviously', 'inexperienced', 'would-be', 'desperado', 'played', 'John', 'Gavin', 'white', 'man', 'raised', 'Indians', 'played', 'Sydney', 'Chaplin', 'MacMurray', 'cool', 'steady', 'professional.The', 'group', 'Quantez', 'deserted', 'not', 'knowing', 'govenrment', 'withdrawn', 'troops', 'Apaches', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'surrounding', 'territory', 'intention', 'killing', 'whites', 'who', 'stay', 'too', 'long', 'area', 'group', 'uneasiness', 'internecine', 'rivalry', 'Indians', 'begin', 'close', 'in.MacMurray', 'very', 'believable', 'role', 'keep', 'peace', 'figure', 'out', 'plan', 'too', 'late', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'Quantez', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'great', 'Western', 'candidate', 'DVD', 'release', 'are', 'MacMurray', 'Westerns', 'Gunpoint', 'Day', 'Bad', 'Man']",Quantez
