1063081,A29WP41KBIS6EE,B000O78KZ6,Brian Taves,"[20, 29]","Why have these films been marketed on DVD?  They attempt to coast on the popularity of the 1990s Stephen Fry / Hugh Laurie series, Jeeves and Wooster, rather than the intrinsic quality of these relics, and anyone buying this DVD will be sorely disappointed by the comparison.At the end of 1935, 20th Century-Fox bought the film rights to Jeeves, looking for potentially prolific--and profitable--properties, and any character who seemed to have the potential to lure filmgoers to film after film.  The series seems to have been launched on what was perceived as a sure bet, casting Arthur Treacher, known for playing butler roles, as the most famous literary gentleman's gentleman.However, the Jeeves films revealed no sense of the situations and character patterns that had made him successful in and books.  There is none of Jeeves's trademark Machiavellian cleverness in the Treacher characterization, simply an annoyingly starched and stuffy, standard-issue English butler.  He is irritable and petulant, appalled by any breach of etiquette or improper behavior, lacking the adaptability of the Wodehouse creation.  Wodehouse himself said that Treacher ""pulled faces all the time.  Awful,"" adding ""That supercilious manner of his is all wrong for Jeeves.""There was scarcely a mistake that was not made in the 56 minute opening movie, THANK YOU, JEEVES.  In dispensing with the plot of the novel, and any other Jeeves story, the screenwriters substituted a bizarre combination of incidents interspersed in an incredibly unlikely account of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves becoming involved with espionage.  The attempts at humor were either forced, or, in the case of a few lines that might have been amusing, were presented in such a way so as to conceal any comedic potential.  Racial comedy with Willie Best, typical of the time, only makes viewers cringe today.David Niven made an acceptable Bertie, effectively capturing his comic perplexity, but he was then under contract to Samuel Goldwyn, who typically loaned Niven out only for a single picture.  Hence, the script of THANK YOU, JEEVES married Bertie at the close, eliminating half of the Wodehouse team in adapting the stories to the screen, judging Bertie to be dispensable.THANK YOU, JEEVES, a 1936 release, was followed the next year by STEP LIVELY, JEEVES, which this time is not ostensibly based on any Wodehouse work, but admits to being an original creation.  The first picture in the series had been so bad that ironically there was nowhere to go but up.  Although STEP LIVELY, JEEVES is a screwball comedy far from the Wodehouse tone, it at least remains predominantly humorous, unlike the mix with spies that had marred THANK YOU, JEEVES.There is no consistency in characterization between the two movies.  The 69 minute STEP LIVELY, JEEVES reflects a new concept of the whole idea of a Jeeves series.  Jeeves now has the Bertie Wooster brain, perpetually befuddled and confused.  Yet the result is a pleasant, if thoroughly undistinguished movie that does contain a few mild, brief laughs--modest achievements, but significant improvements over THANK YOU, JEEVES.  However, STEP LIVELY, JEEVES was still far from the necessary quality to sustain a series, and it was canceled at 20th Century-Fox over the summer of 1937.  (Simultaneously, Wodehouse was scripting his own novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS at RKO, a vastly superior rendering of his comedy to the screen.)American audiences were likely regarded as unlikely to accept a series positing a truly sagacious English butler, as in the Wodehouse stories, instead seeing such a figure purely as a source of comedy, meaning that the rights to Jeeves were bought for the name only, not the narratives.  As it happened however, the Jeeves series became one of the worst executed ideas under Sol Wurtzel's Fox ""B"" unit, one which fully justified the aphorism about Fox ""Bs"", ""from bad to Wurtzel.""  Probably the ultimate epitaph occurred when, in a 1937 radio broadcast, Hedda Hopper interviewed P.G. Wodehouse, and they spoke as if the Fox Jeeves movies had never been made.Ironically, both Treacher and Niven starred separately in later television films of Wodehouse stories, Treacher in The Philco Television Playhouse:  Uncle Dynamite (1950) and Niven in two versions of ""Uncle Fred Flits By"" for Hollywood Opening Night (1953) and Four Star Playhouse (1955).  Of these three, at least the latter survives, and is one of  the most successful transpositions of Wodehouse.  Niven produced this half-hour show that fully captures the zaniness of the original while maintaining fidelity to the source.  This example of one of the same actors in a worthwhile adaptation would have offered an interesting comparison to give real value to this DVD, proving the possibility of bringing Wodehouse successfully to the screen in a manner that put the Fox Jeeves films to shame.The DVD bonuses, two documentaries about Wodehouse, are well-done but not sufficiently memorable for most viewers to justify the purchase.  Some idea of the lack of thought given to the overall production of this package is that the documentaries, and the accompanying DVD brochure, give entirely divergent and contradictory accounts of the making of the movies.The point of buying a video is to enable the purchaser to enjoy a work of quality again and again, like a favorite book.  I doubt few who buy this DVD will ever look at it again, assuming, of course, they manage to watch it all the way through at all.  Instead, the purchaser is better advised to spend on videos of WODEHOUSE PLAYHOUSE, JEEVES AND WOOSTER, or A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.",1,"Arthur Treacher is no Stephen Fry, sorry to say-nor is Treacher

Too bad their saddled with a lame espionage story that leaves you with little interest.  What negates the film completely is it contains a Stepin Fetchit type that would offend any sensibility.

1063084,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B000O78KZ6,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[20, 20]","Twentieth Century Fox has gone all out in presenting these two restored films. Along with the two black and white films are two featurettes on Wodehouse. The slipcased jacket includes notes and four postcards of the theatrical lobby cards, with the films on one double- sided disc. Wodehouse fans will rejoice in this unprecedented opportunity to view these two little- seen movies. But how will they play for everyone else?Quite well, as it turns out. Despite the title, Thank You, Jeeves has almost nothing in common with the 1934 novel, but it introduces David Niven as Bertie Wooster in his first feature film role. Whether or not he's believable as Bertie, he does a very good David Niven. Which was somewhat the problem. Daryl Zanuck borrowed him from Samuel Goldwyn  for the film, which rocketed Niven to stardom, ensuring his nonavailability for future Wooster roles. Which made this film essentially a one- off.Even if you'd scarcely heard of Jeeves, Arthur Treacher was already well- known for playing British butlers, so it was a mere step to a valet. For the same reason, he lacks the nuanced sense that Stephen Fry would later bring to Wooster and Jeeves. Step Lively, Jeeves takes nothing from Wodehouse's books, not even Bertie Wooster. That's of course because of the typically Wodehousian mix-up explained above so that David Niven was not available. However, Jeeves almost plays a Wooster without a Jeeves to extricate him from the soup. Given a free hand, Arthur Treacher shows himself a quite good actor. However, veering from the stereotypical butler is also in keeping with some of Jeeve's many sides as revealed in later novels. So odd as it may seem, Step Lively, Jeeves comes off as the better picture.The two extras, ""Thank You P.G.: The Life of P.G. Wodehouse"", and ""The World of Wodehouse"" are both very recent and seem like two parts of the same documentary (which they probably were). How recent are they? So recent that all the books shown are the Overstreet hardback Collector's Wodehouse editions. That said, the documentaries are extremely good, consisting entirely of interview footage with members of the Wodehouse Society, authors, and actors. Having seen and heard Robert McCrum made me want to read his Wodehouse bio. Someone gives a shocking statistic, that 95 per cent of Woosters were killed in WW I, which throws a whole new light on Wodehouse's attempt to recreate a bygone Britain.One difference between Bertie in the books and on film is that he narrates the books, as it were, while the film is in the standard Hollywood third person. Niven nevertheless has some brilliant Woosterian monologues. Step Lively, however, wins with a Wodehousian plot and, something nearly forgotten in modern day Tinseltown, very strong minor characters. This enables the film to use a very small roster of personnel, which yet seems like a cast of thousands. While the slightly better known 1937 Fred Astaire- Burns and Allen musical of A Damsel in Distress is lively and engaging, mostly due to the stellar cast, both of these films seem closer to the spirit of Wodehouse.",5,Jeeves Sees It Through,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,3101,"['Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'gone', 'out', 'presenting', 'two', 'restored', 'films', 'two', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'are', 'two', 'featurettes', 'Wodehouse', 'slipcased', 'jacket', 'notes', 'four', 'postcards', 'theatrical', 'lobby', 'cards', 'films', 'one', 'double-', 'sided', 'disc', 'Wodehouse', 'fans', 'will', 'rejoice', 'unprecedented', 'opportunity', 'view', 'two', 'little-', 'seen', 'movies', 'how', 'will', 'play', 'everyone', 'else', 'Quite', 'well', 'out', 'title', 'Thank', 'almost', 'nothing', 'common', '1934', 'novel', 'David', 'Niven', 'Bertie', 'Wooster', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'role', 'not', 'believable', 'Bertie', 'very', 'good', 'David', 'Niven', 'Which', 'was', 'somewhat', 'problem', 'Daryl', 'Zanuck', 'borrowed', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', 'film', 'rocketed', 'Niven', 'stardom', 'ensuring', 'nonavailability', 'future', 'Wooster', 'roles', 'Which', 'made', 'film', 'essentially', 'one-', 'off.Even', ""'d"", 'scarcely', 'heard', 'Jeeves', 'Arthur', 'Treacher', 'was', 'already', 'well-', 'known', 'playing', 'British', 'butlers', 'was', 'mere', 'step', 'valet', 'same', 'reason', 'nuanced', 'sense', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'would', 'later', 'bring', 'Wooster', 'Jeeves', 'Step', 'Lively', 'Jeeves', 'nothing', 'Wodehouse', 'books', 'not', 'even', 'Bertie', 'Wooster', 'course', 'typically', 'Wodehousian', 'mix-up', 'explained', 'so', 'David', 'Niven', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'However', 'almost', 'Wooster', 'Jeeves', 'extricate', 'soup', 'Given', 'free', 'hand', 'Arthur', 'Treacher', 'quite', 'good', 'actor', 'However', 'veering', 'stereotypical', 'butler', 'also', 'keeping', 'Jeeve', 'many', 'sides', 'revealed', 'later', 'novels', 'So', 'odd', 'may', 'seem', 'Step', 'Lively', 'Jeeves', 'off', 'better', 'picture.The', 'two', 'extras', 'Thank', 'P.G', 'Life', 'P.G', 'Wodehouse', 'World', 'Wodehouse', 'are', 'very', 'recent', 'seem', 'two', 'parts', 'same', 'documentary', 'probably', 'were', 'How', 'recent', 'are', 'So', 'recent', 'books', 'shown', 'are', 'Overstreet', 'hardback', 'Collector', 'Wodehouse', 'editions', 'said', 'documentaries', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'consisting', 'entirely', 'interview', 'footage', 'members', 'Wodehouse', 'Society', 'authors', 'actors', 'Having', 'seen', 'heard', 'Robert', 'McCrum', 'made', 'want', 'read', 'Wodehouse', 'bio', 'Someone', 'shocking', 'statistic', '95', 'cent', 'Woosters', 'were', 'killed', 'WW', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'Wodehouse', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'bygone', 'Britain.One', 'difference', 'Bertie', 'books', 'film', 'books', 'were', 'film', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'third', 'person', 'Niven', 'nevertheless', 'brilliant', 'Woosterian', 'monologues', 'Step', 'Lively', 'however', 'Wodehousian', 'plot', 'something', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'modern', 'day', 'Tinseltown', 'very', 'strong', 'minor', 'characters', 'film', 'use', 'very', 'small', 'roster', 'personnel', 'yet', 'cast', 'thousands', 'slightly', 'better', 'known', '1937', 'Fred', 'Astaire-', 'Burns', 'Allen', 'musical', 'A', 'Damsel', 'Distress', 'lively', 'engaging', 'mostly', 'due', 'stellar', 'cast', 'films', 'seem', 'closer', 'spirit', 'Wodehouse']","The Jeeves Collection: (Thank You, Jeeves! / Step Lively, Jeeves!)"

That said These are a singularly bad pair movies. The only audience I would condemn to see these  movies are the movie producers who think the way to make money is to seize upon a proven formula and refuse to believe that there's any need to keep any loyalty towards the original formula. Movie producers with no faith in the original story need to find a different story. For what it's worth of the Rotten Tomato ratings for these two movies are 6.3 and 6.1 respectivelyA little background on this two DVD set. When the decision was made to film to movies David Niven who would play Bertie Wooster was under contract to a competing movie company and it was made clear his loaner was for one movie only. Therefore the first side Thank You Jeeves has the two-man comedy team but the second movie Step Lively Jeeves has no Bertie Wooster.Author Treacher was an excellent choice for the character of Jeeves. With the right script in the right direction he could've carried both movies quite well. As it is he is allowed a few bits in the second movie wherein we can see Treatures acting skill in this type of character. I suspect David Niven could have been an excellent Bertie Wooster unfortunately the script gives him very little chance to be the spluttering fool of the books. Instead of we have Niven playing the kind of debonaire womanizer that David Niven is fully capable of performing but bears little resemblance to the confused alternately romantic and semi-misogynistic Bertie Wooster.Meantime the two scripts give us a Jeeves who is not especially bright who does not see through thin plots and unlikely coincidences. Jeeves a gentleman's gentleman in all situations would not find himself laying on the floor leg wrestling or directing a saxophone solo March number. This Jeeves neither shimmers nor thinks up elaborate ways to save his employer while manipulating all else around him. Instead of being the straight man of all straight men this Jeeves is a stiffly comedic figure.The real shame is that the plot throws altogether too many devices: spies, romantic leads social climbing gangsters and even a stereotypical black jazz musician, Willie best in the role of course named Drowsy. Woodhouse was quite capable of having complicated plots while drafting various oddball side issues. But the secret to his comedy was keeping everything tight and everything to the purpose. He was consciously creating a fairy story and keeping the complexities with in the comedic nature of his leading characters. These two movies simply pile up complexities as if the the director had to fold in whatever actors and plot lines happen to be laying around otherwise unattended.I have recently readWodehouse: A Lifeand was warned that these were not considered good movies and that they had failed in the theaters. I now pass that same warning on to you. The transfer is a fairly high quality with decent sounds. If you get stuck with this DVD, skip the movies and watch the extras, there are enough moments in the paired Woodhouse and film histories to justify the one star.",1,I had been warned and now I must warn you,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,3196,"['possible', 'are', 'only', 'talking', 'Bertie', 'Jeeves', 'movies', 'PG', 'Wodehouse', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'direct', 'role', 'said', 'are', 'singularly', 'bad', 'pair', 'movies', 'only', 'audience', 'would', 'condemn', 'see', 'movies', 'are', 'movie', 'producers', 'who', 'think', 'way', 'make', 'money', 'seize', 'proven', 'formula', 'refuse', 'believe', 'need', 'keep', 'loyalty', 'original', 'formula', 'Movie', 'producers', 'faith', 'original', 'story', 'need', 'find', 'different', 'story', 'what', 'worth', 'Rotten', 'Tomato', 'ratings', 'two', 'movies', 'are', '6.3', '6.1', 'respectivelyA', 'little', 'background', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'When', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'film', 'movies', 'David', 'Niven', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'Bertie', 'Wooster', 'was', 'contract', 'competing', 'movie', 'company', 'was', 'made', 'clear', 'loaner', 'was', 'one', 'movie', 'only', 'Therefore', 'first', 'side', 'Thank', 'Jeeves', 'two-man', 'comedy', 'team', 'second', 'movie', 'Step', 'Lively', 'Jeeves', 'Bertie', 'Wooster.Author', 'Treacher', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'character', 'Jeeves', 'right', 'script', 'right', 'direction', 'could', ""'ve"", 'carried', 'movies', 'quite', 'well', 'allowed', 'few', 'bits', 'second', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'Treatures', 'acting', 'skill', 'type', 'character', 'suspect', 'David', 'Niven', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'Bertie', 'Wooster', 'unfortunately', 'script', 'very', 'little', 'chance', 'be', 'spluttering', 'fool', 'books', 'Instead', 'have', 'Niven', 'playing', 'kind', 'debonaire', 'womanizer', 'David', 'Niven', 'fully', 'capable', 'performing', 'bears', 'little', 'resemblance', 'confused', 'alternately', 'romantic', 'semi-misogynistic', 'Bertie', 'Wooster.Meantime', 'two', 'scripts', 'give', 'Jeeves', 'who', 'not', 'especially', 'bright', 'who', 'not', 'see', 'thin', 'plots', 'unlikely', 'coincidences', 'gentleman', 'gentleman', 'situations', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'laying', 'floor', 'leg', 'wrestling', 'directing', 'saxophone', 'solo', 'March', 'number', 'shimmers', 'up', 'elaborate', 'ways', 'save', 'employer', 'manipulating', 'else', 'Instead', 'being', 'straight', 'man', 'straight', 'men', 'Jeeves', 'stiffly', 'comedic', 'figure.The', 'real', 'shame', 'plot', 'altogether', 'too', 'many', 'devices', 'spies', 'romantic', 'social', 'climbing', 'gangsters', 'even', 'stereotypical', 'black', 'jazz', 'musician', 'Willie', 'best', 'role', 'course', 'named', 'Drowsy', 'Woodhouse', 'was', 'quite', 'capable', 'having', 'complicated', 'plots', 'drafting', 'various', 'oddball', 'side', 'issues', 'secret', 'comedy', 'was', 'keeping', 'everything', 'tight', 'everything', 'purpose', 'was', 'consciously', 'creating', 'fairy', 'story', 'keeping', 'complexities', 'comedic', 'nature', 'leading', 'characters', 'two', 'movies', 'simply', 'pile', 'up', 'complexities', 'director', 'had', 'fold', 'actors', 'plot', 'lines', 'happen', 'be', 'laying', 'otherwise', 'unattended.I', 'have', 'recently', 'readWodehouse', 'Lifeand', 'was', 'warned', 'were', 'not', 'considered', 'good', 'movies', 'had', 'failed', 'theaters', 'now', 'pass', 'same', 'warning', 'transfer', 'fairly', 'high', 'quality', 'decent', 'sounds', 'get', 'stuck', 'DVD', 'skip', 'movies', 'watch', 'extras', 'are', 'enough', 'moments', 'paired', 'Woodhouse', 'film', 'histories', 'justify', 'one', 'star']","The Jeeves Collection: (Thank You, Jeeves! / Step Lively, Jeeves!)"

Wodehouse.  At of this minute, these are the only two movies available on DVD.  While it's certainly handy to have them on one DVD, I wish there were more movies available.If you're a fan of the Jeeves and Wooster series by the BBC, Hugh Laurie is the best representation of the Bertie Wooster character.  Both the TV series and the ""Jeeves"" movies have some merits and some demerits.  There isn't yet a complete capture of P.G.
