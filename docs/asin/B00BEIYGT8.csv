1627093,A3KX78AYIWYAO4,B00BEIYGT8,Alexander,"[7, 15]","Ok, my whole view on scary movies is probably different from alot of people's views for them. I really just go for something that's going to be creepy make me jump and in rare cases make me laugh. I don't see why everyone complains when there is no story in a scary movie cause look at real life there isn't a story behind every single killing that goes on. But anyways this movie literally scared the crap out of me through the whole thing; the main reason being the idea of a night free for killing is something that actually seems plausible and realistic in the United States. That's one of my favorite type of scary movies because you can relate unlike the completely random made up ideas that are so farfetched you wonder what on earth they were smoking when they came up with the idea. The Purge starts of setting up for future plots and as it goes farther and farther in it just keeps adding more and more twists to the story. Once you figure something out and you're thinking ok so this is what they're doing, BAM it gives you some big twist. I honestly can say it is one of my favorite scary movies and I would watch it over and over and over again and I would recommend this to literally any person who is looking to watch a scary movie.",5,Literally SO good,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,1247,"['Ok', 'whole', 'view', 'scary', 'movies', 'probably', 'different', 'alot', 'people', 'views', 'really', 'just', 'go', 'something', 'going', 'be', 'creepy', 'make', 'jump', 'rare', 'cases', 'make', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'everyone', 'when', 'story', 'scary', 'movie', 'cause', 'look', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'story', 'single', 'killing', 'movie', 'literally', 'scared', 'crap', 'whole', 'thing', 'main', 'reason', 'being', 'idea', 'night', 'free', 'killing', 'something', 'actually', 'plausible', 'realistic', 'United', 'States', 'one', 'favorite', 'type', 'scary', 'movies', 'can', 'relate', 'completely', 'random', 'made', 'up', 'ideas', 'are', 'so', 'farfetched', 'wonder', 'what', 'earth', 'were', 'smoking', 'when', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'Purge', 'starts', 'setting', 'up', 'future', 'plots', 'farther', 'farther', 'just', 'adding', 'more', 'more', 'twists', 'story', 'figure', 'something', 'out', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'ok', 'so', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'BAM', 'big', 'twist', 'honestly', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'scary', 'movies', 'would', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'recommend', 'literally', 'person', 'who', 'looking', 'watch', 'scary', 'movie']",The Purge

Fortunately it was available here on Amazon. It was definitely worth the extra money to buy it rather than rent it. This movie has you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Some parts are predictable, but some parts have you totally caught off guard. This movie is very violent and even disturbing in some scenes. Definitely not for younger kids. No sex or nudity. Didn't need it. Just a very violent, suspenseful movie with some very creepy people. They reminded me of Charles Manson followers.

This is one of those movies that deserves to be re-made by someone up to the task. The idea, the premise, is just that good.It starts out fantastic and then 20 minutes in you begin to see the shallow nature.. then by the end you just have your head in your hands going 'why, why, why would you go this direction!?'I'm sure most of you know the plot.. one night a year, American's get to completely purge their souls of evil by going on a criminal binge. All things are legal, chaos erupts in the streets, no police, no firemen, no hospitals, all of the systems put in place to protect you on a daily basis are gone. And anyone and everyone who wants to take a shot at you has an opportunity to do so - and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it except fight back.So, with a very horrifying concept in hand, what do we get? We get to see a bunch of rich people fight other rich people inside a house. Yea. A massive, nation-wide concept of horror and chaos... we get to experience it condensed into one house. One family. A wealthy family, who can afford protection, who would have undergone ZERO risk except for their own ignorance, find themselves embroiled in a Keeping up with the Jones' style mess. Basically we get an overly dramatic version of Panic Room... Panic Room may have been better.Now, I know some of your artsy types are going to talk about the expression of morals, or the juxtaposition of classes or the ironic motif etc. Blah, blah. Who cares. The point is this. It was an absolutely fantastic concept, truly one I looked forward to seeing. It was marketed correctly, the opening scenes set it up correctly, and then someone suffered brain damage and ruined the rest.I only gave two stars for the idea behind the movie, but I assure you there is very little worth seeing here.

1627112,AI46E73DWKD2B,B00BEIYGT8,BackToGood,"[0, 1]","THE PURGE (2012) poses an interesting, wild premise: What if, for a 12-hour period, one had the freedom to commit ANY crime?! That is the story in this unique, provocative, yet flawed film. This movie has gotten a lot of negative reviews, but I'm somewhere in the middle. While it has a few annoyances and frustrating moments, it does a good job of showing who your REAL friends are in this world and when the chips are down, who you perhaps can really count on. The &#34;kindness of strangers&#34; takes on a whole new meaning in this one!Set in the supposedly not-too-distant future, Hawke persuasively plays James Sandin, a rich suburbanite whose company sells &#34;foolproof&#34; home security systems designed to protect &#34;the haves&#34; against intruders during the annual purge, where the government allows anarchy to prevail for a period of 12 hours. Rampant crime is allowed and no one will be prosecuted as long as they commit their lawless acts within the acceptable timeframe. Sandin and his wife Mary (superbly played by Lena Headey), along with their 2 kids Charlie (Max Burkholder) and Zoey (Adelaide Kane) stay barricaded in their high-tech home, protected by the security system. But things go awry as Charlie spots a bloodied &#34;Stranger&#34; (excellently played by Edwin Hodge) running for his life, and activate the system to let him in. There is another major development (which kind of took me out of the movie for a while) that coincides with this. Then the group of psychotic purgers arrive to bargain with the Sandins to turn over the Stranger.There are several weak points of the film, most notably the actors playing the Sandin kids. I get that child actors should be allowed some leeway, but they were important to the plot. Also, these 2 characters did extremely frustrating things that caused all the trouble to begin with! Also, that early major development that coincides with the Stranger's arrival was one of the most convoluted things I've ever seen in a movie! I thought it was a cheap way for the director to get across the message, when the latter stages of the film did a more potent job of doing so. Finally, I thought the main purger tormenting the family wasn't very intimidating. A very standard stone-faced, monotone-speaking &#34;movie psycho&#34; character.Strong performances by Hawke, Headey, and Hodge help keep the film afloat, though.

I've nothing sadly not only the Purge but lots of recent movies get too many haters. You get go by the one star reviews. I at first did for a while and then one day I was bored and watched it...turned out to be one of the best horror films of 2013 as far as I see it. Plus personally I love the ending. It isn't an ending you would expect which makes it better and not so predictable. It's a must have for horror fans.The scene where the emergency broadcast system announces the start if the Purge honestly sends chills down my spine.

1627114,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00BEIYGT8,B. E Jackson,"[1, 3]","I do!  I believing in doing good things!  Good things that help people!  The Purge shows viewers the impossible law passing that allows 12 straight hours of committing crimes exactly one day out of the year.  It's legal!  Now at first I wasn't sure what kind of crimes the movie was going for.  I figured it meant petty things such as robbing a cashier man at the downtown convenience store or stealing food in a grocery store.  No!  This is a supposed law being passed that allows murder and rape!  What, really?  COME ON!Now of course, you can imagine due to the many low ratings here on amazon, many people dislike the concept and question its basis on reality.  No, it's not realistic at all.  I personally think the biggest crime this movie committed is calling itself a horror movie.  It's not really horror in the sense that ghosts and aliens torture people out of their homes.  That doesn't happen.  It's definitely more suspenseful than anything.Let me mention the flaws, of which there's many (and you probably knew I was going to mention them since it's unavoidable not to notice, hehe).- Why did it seem like hours before the scheduled purging got underway, the rich suburban neighborhood didn't seem to feel nervous in any way?  Regardless how well protected you are with firearms and regardless how modern and sturdy your installed security system is, wouldn't you at least be *somewhat* nervous?  Wouldn't you show at least a little concern?  We're talking about the strong possibility of death here or at the very least property destruction of some kind, and the family the movie in this movie has a younger son and a teenage daughter.  Isn't it human nature to be scared to death and DREAD this day?  Wouldn't you want to be extra cautious with your kids?  But... these parents didn't seem to care.  It's apparently just another walk down the sidewalk with Beaver and Wally in this neighborhood.- Let's say those willing to commit murder give in to their sadistic ways since they have a 12-hour window to do so.  Without releasing spoilers, what would stop a man from killing someone a few minutes after the 12 hours are up?  Especially if you go through the kind of torment this family does and murder almost seems necessary to survive.  It's not like the FBI and cops would be able to notice that you committed a crime by only a few minutes after the times up!  Then again if such a law is passed that allows murder, the cops and FBI are probably not too concerned about the day after anyway since it's too much law-breaking to handle at once.- Why did the family NOT stay in their protected firearm-loaded room the entire time the purge was occurring?  The daughter gets up and leaves because hanging out with her parents is apparently lame... and the son does too... and the parents do nothing to stop them!  I'd be like ""Where do you think you two are going?  Get back here and sit with your mother and me for 12 hours while we wait and watch the camera filming the outside front yard!""  Hey, they could even make it a family night.  It's not like America has any of those anymore anyway.  :)With all that said, as a movie -a suspense- I'm willing to overlook the obvious flaws and the silly premise and just enjoy it.  While it does bring up a noticeable but never directly stated point that moral issues seem to be tossed aside these days just for the purpose of passing another law, I'd like to think America would *never* go down the path of allowing murders to happen one day out of the year for 12 hours.  This would be the worst possible thing ever, and anybody with a conscience should immediately realize how ridiculous this would be if true.The fictional storyline itself is just outrageous with MANY twists and turns.  In fact I'm only going to reveal one part, and that's when the younger son is watching the camera footage of his front yard on a TV in his backroom showing a man running, screaming and begging for someone to open the doors and let him inside.  He's begging for his life because a gang of highly unusual murder-happy young adults wearing masks and carrying guns are determined to take advantage of the purging (and basically worship this day) so they are going around targeting homeless people, which this man happens to be.The boy (played by Max Burkholder from the awesome drama Parenthood) lets him inside believing the man's really running for his life... and right after this all sorts of chaos ensues when the gang realizes the family is hiding the homeless man inside their tightly locked home, BUT... I consider none of the events that take place from here on out predictable for storyline purposes.  At least two MAJOR twists happen, maybe even three.  People you think are the bad guys suddenly turn good in the heat of the moment and vice versa, and the deaths themselves happen to be incredibly graphic.  The mother reluctantly holding a firearm as she roams the dark hallways assuming that nothing would go wrong is a good moment (or perhaps this is all unintentional and she's actually acting poorly in her role- ha, I hope not- would make me look like a big fool for complimenting her!)The story mostly focuses on the father wanting to protect his family from the gang of misfits that hang around their front yard and threaten to break into their home with back-up vehicles capable of destroying the security around the family's front door if they don't release the homeless man to them (who's now hiding somewhere in this dark, overlarge house and nobody knows where he is).  Here's the real kicker- the main guy from the gang happens to be exceptionally screwy in the head because to prove how serious he is about potentially murdering the family, he turns his gun to the man next to him who he claims is his best friend, and shoots/kills him.  Wow, even if the family WERE able to find and hand over the homeless man, would you seriously be willing to open the front door and take a chance that you won't eat a bullet for your troubles?  I certainly wouldn't trust the guy from that gang.  He just killed his friend!  He proved he's no more than a crazy lunatic himself.This movie is really crazy.  Thankfully we can all sleep easy knowing that such an annual purging ordeal would never really happen... right?  *waves tiny American flag and nervously sings God Bless America more convincingly than ever before* :)I know if I was in this situation I'd create a sturdy, well-protected backroom containing a variety of guns, much like the ones the family has in this movie that they mostly neglected to use, and I'd stay there wide awake the whole night shaking and waiting for anything unusual to come through that door... and then I'd react accordingly.  I'd only shoot if I felt my life was in danger.  Hopefully that's what most people would do because actually taking advantage of such a crime-filled night by going through with the committing of them should make you feel really bad and empty inside.  You're now soulless!I can't help but think there's many different ways to create a storyline out of a 12-hour crime spree.  Instead of creating a suburban rich family hiding and protecting themselves, they could have shown people with less money and resources scared for their lives in the main part of a city, and we could watch THEIR situations develop.  Or perhaps somewhere out in the country such as a farm in Kansas.  Or maybe Florida near Key West.  Or how about the snowy mountains of Alaska?  So many possibilities.At least the movie does several things right.  It's quality entertainment for one thing, and it's a storyline I've never encountered in a movie before so I feel it's somewhat original.  The parents -despite not feeling as much concern as they should concerning the safety of their children and their own safety thanks to the apparent confident belief that they're safe and sound in their suburban rich home- are good enough actors/actresses.  At least they're willing to die for their kids.  It's Max's character I like the most.  Him and his little remote control car with a red-eyed camera hidden inside turns out to be such a nifty, case-cracking tool!The ending has its problems though.  I mean now that it's all out in the open (*ahem!* I'm not spoiling what it is!) why take a chance and let it... fade away like nothing happened?  And return to normal after all that?  You can't.  You'd now be watching your back all day/everyday.  You have to finish it.  Finish it by packing your things, leaving and never coming back again.",5,do you believe in God?,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,8532,"['do', 'believing', 'doing', 'good', 'things', 'Good', 'things',

1627117,AVM0FXTMG07IX,B00BEIYGT8,Bonecrkr,"[3, 9]","The basic premise of this movie could have been interesting....with better acting and a better storyline.  Instead, the movie is a thinly veiled vehicle for anti-white bigotry and propaganda.  You probably have some idea of the plot.  One night a year, law enforcement is suspended and anything goes.  The movie is pretty heavy handed in implying that people are universally evil but, limited to one night a year, they behave themselves the rest of the year.  There is some minor suggestion that this may have worked simply because Americans, enraged at all the crime, simply genocide the criminal element every year while law enforcement looks the other way.  In fact, the title, ""The Purge"" has a double meaning.  It is supposed to mean the cathartic purge of evil through one night of sheer wickedness a year.  But a purge could mean a selecting out and eliminating of a problematic element (and has been used that way multiple times in history).  Here is where the movie screws it up.  Those doing the purging are the very caricature of evil and the movie goes out of its way to portray white people, especially rich white people as either cowards who hide behind fortress walls or unreasonable psychopaths.  The victim is, of course black.  Since that is almost the exact opposite of how things are in real life, only this is like the millionth time today, some media has rammed that lie down my throat, the movie gets an F where its poor acting and tendency to drag would give it a D.  D minus, actually for the random scene where the girls boyfriend hides out in the home and attempts to murder her father for no particular reason whatsoever (because... you know....the way to impress a girl is by killing her family).  The magic black guy is, of course, a war hero.  And never mind the fact that black people refuse combat roles for the most part in every war ever waged.This movie could have not been a total wash if they simply eliminated the black guy as the victim and not went there.  It could, in fact, have been a great movie, if they made him a criminal scumbag, hiding out from the one night a year when law abiding folk are allowed to hunt him down like a dog in revenge.

Naturally, this film would fall into that category.There's no way that this scenario would ever happen, and so that is its biggest problem.  But I still decided to give it a try, mostly because it was on ""free"" TV, but more so because I'm a fan of Ethan Hawke.  In particular, I was a big fan of his work -- and the film itself -- in ""Gattaca,"" one of the best sci-fi films ever made.  That film was surprisingly believable, as it is quite possible that people in the future will be discriminated against due to genetics.  (It's probably happening already, what with sites like 23andMe.)  And I really liked ""Sinister,"" a quite underrated horror film that really gives the audience the chills, even though the plot isn't exactly believable either.And I really hated it here how they overly moralized, what with the homeless black guy that the young-and-stupid-ultra-liberal son lets in.  Yikes.  Without giving too much away, I actually liked Mr. Hawkes original position, how he felt -- rightfully so -- that it was his job to protect his family at all costs; but then he later changes that position to probably appease a stupid American viewing audience.  I suppose the film makers wanted him to be a sympathetic character, and that's just a fail in this case.It is interesting to think about certain concepts:  NIMBY being one, since the protagonists originally didn't care about murders, as long as those murders happened outside the 'burbs.  And the idea that, if there weren't any laws, then there wouldn't be any crime.  (Yes, you don't have to think too long to realize that this is correct.  Ironically, laws create crime and criminals.)

The idea of a Purge day and the process behind it was a twisted idea, but had great potential for movie of this sorts with many &#34;What would you do?&#34; type scenarios. But as the film continued on, it started to lose its thrill. The reasons being:- I couldn't understand the Son's thoughts...during the purge or life in general. He comes off as not understanding the horror/reason behind the purge - which is understandable. Heck, the adults were a little foggy on the concept. But we are left hanging as to whether or not he agrees/disagrees by the end - even though some of the movies major events circled around him. Maybe some people don't care about what he thinks. But seeing how he was the reason the stranger got in the house, he's the reason the stranger was protected, and he's the reason all hell broke loose at their house... I kinda think his &#34;motive&#34; is important!- What the hell happened to the stranger?!?! So in the beginning he is let in the house. Then through 75% of the movie he's in hiding. Okay. Cool, I guess. Whatever. Then out of nowhere at the end he just pops up and is like &#34;Heeeeey - saved your life!&#34; and becomes the hero. Seriously?- What the hell happened to the daughter?!?! Same thing as the stranger, she starts off as a major part in the movie. After her boyfriend goes batshit she just disappears somewhere in the house. Never to be seen until the end again.- Last but certainly not least, was the mother's &#34;hysterics&#34; acting. It drove me nuts. Who looks for a killer(s) in their house with their eyeballs plastered on the ground while holding a gun ready for a shoot out. The entire time she's scared and hunting for killers in her house she is seriously staring at the floor, crying, carrying a gun. Meanwhile killers 1-6 are right in front of her - literally 2 feet away - and she doesn't see them because she's staring at the floor!! Common sense, people!Anyways, that's what I thought.

Isn't that why you want to watch it?  Be honest.In the movie, it is the year 2022.  Unemployment is at an all-time low of 1 percent.  Crime is way down as well - all in thanks to (according to the government) a yearly government sanctioned ritual called The Purge.  During The Purge, citizens are encouraged to ""purge all their hostile and negative feelings"" by committing any crime they want - EVEN MURDER - without ANY consequences.  There are NO POLICE...no fire department or medical services, either.  On March 22 of every year, for twelve hours, everyone is on their own.Enter our main characters, an upscale couple called The Sandins.  They live in a rich gated community with their two children.  The husband, James, sells home security systems for his career, and makes a lot of money doing this - naturally, due to The Purge.  Therefore, even though he's not really a BAD person, he does support The Purge (as all good citizens are encouraged to do) since this yearly bloody ritual makes him a boatload of money in his upscale neighborhood.Unfortunately, all of his neighbors are jealous of how well James is doing financially.After The Purge commences (there is a scary bull-horn sound and an announcement on the news) the Sandins high-tech security system whirs into action, creating a massive ""lock-down.""  The family assumes they are safe.  However, when the son peers outside on their expensive surveillance equipment, he sees that a bloody stranger has stumbled into their yard, crying and in need of help.  The kind-hearted boy lets this stranger into the Sandin's home - and after that, all hell breaks loose.A creepy menacing group soon descends upon the Sandin house, demanding the Sandins send the stranger out to them.  ""He was our purge!"" they claim, and they want him back...or ELSE, they will kill the whole Sandin family!What should the Sandins do?  Should they send this man back out and prove they have lost all humanity, such as others on this horrible night have done?  Or should they risk a deadly home invasion - and the lives of their own family members by not doing what the angry crowd demands?Now let me be perfectly clear:  This movie will never win any awards.  HOWEVER....if you are looking for plain old suspenseful entertainment....along with a desire to feel grateful that you do NOT live in that futuristic depiction of America - then watch the movie!  It will engage you, I promise.  I found myself talking back to the screen, feeling 100 percent THERE.The character development is adequate for this sort of movie, I think.  You do get a sense that this is a real suburban family.  There are characters you can route for - which I think is good - such as the son and the bloody stranger, who turns out to be a homeless man.I realized that The Purge seemed to mostly be about purging society of the poor.  This is indeed a very disturbing aspect of the movie.  Like I said before, though, the movie made me feel grateful for the world I live in now - a world that cares for and helps those in need.  This movie will definitely make you think about things like that!I think they could have done with out the overly sexy teenage daughter dressed in mini skirt, knee socks, and fake ""school girl"" outfit, looking like an anime character.  Or do they need to toss that sort of cliche into every horror movie to get young male viewers?All in all I feel The Purge delivered. Before I watched the movie, I was worried I wouldn't like any of the characters.  This thriller is definitely an action packed, edge of the seat ride.  Obviously, this movie should never be viewed by children!  Hopefully, everyone who watches the movie will be deeply appalled by the very idea of it.  If ever anyone thought The Purge was a GOOD idea, I would be very upset!So watch it - be entertained.

1627132,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00BEIYGT8,Chris Kennison,"[1, 3]","A ridiculous premise may or may not deter people from venturing into ""The Purge"" and that may or may not be justified. A re-born American government has managed to eliminate crime, poverty and unemployment by allowing for one night, one 12-hour period a year, where there are no laws and no emergency services. For one night, murder, theft and whatever people of devious mind can think of, is legal. It is a simple premise and a silly premise. Although the creators of ""The Purge"", the movie, James DeManaco and Michael Bay, aren't necessarily trying to make an accurate statement, but a social one.The movie focuses on one family, the Sandin's; most noteably the father, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke). James is the man who marketed and sold the ultimate security system to all of the rich elite who can afford to be safe on a night like the Purge. Their homes are locked down and impenetrable, or are they? Well, if they were, we wouldn't have a movie now would we?""The Purge"" has its moments of silliness; most of that in the final third of the movie. I have to admit that I was hooked though, for a bit. The tension builds nicely and you get to know the family enough that you care for them and their situation. The movie also tries to make a social statement about the Government and how people all have pent up anger and violent tendencies. Allowed to release that pent up and inevitable tendency for a short period, in theory, opens the door for 364 days of non-violence.The movie focuses its attention narrowly, which damages this attempt to make a wide government statement. The social statement works to an extent, although much of the finality of the film is spoiled by some silly staged moments, like people praying around their innocent and unarmed targets before doing the violent deed. Of course, anytime you see someone explaining what he or she is doing or pausing before doing something, it is almost always a lame setup for someone to interfere or spoil the plan.If you are going into ""The Purge"" expecting to see this premise explain itself or justify itself, save your money.  It isn't going to do it and you will inevitably come out thinking that the movie was as stupid as you assume it is.  The moviemakers aren't trying to justify this premise as something that is feasible; they are making a social comment in a fictional world. If you study the intent behind the characters actions given this one night opportunity, you will enjoy the movie much more.Regardless of which audience member you are though, the ending will inevitably leave you disappointed. The carnage and unpredictability takes a dramatic u-turn in the movies final third, becoming clich&eacute;' and safe. It built and built and then leveled off to a typical Hollywood, test-audience ruined dud.

1627134,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B00BEIYGT8,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 2]","Laughable in excess and poorly executed, the 2013 horror film ""The Purge"" is still an interesting take on the most terrifying of occurrences -- the home invasion crime. Such atrocities have been detailed in far more disturbing works including Michael Haneke'sFunny Games, Stanley Kubrick'sA Clockwork Orange(likely the great inspiration for this film) and Sam Peckinpah'sStraw Dogs (Unrated Version). Writer and director James DeMonaco has a good idea, but his film soars off the rails during the frantic second half. It could have been so much more.In the year 2022, the United States is amazingly crime free thanks to an annual event known as ""The Purge,"" a demented Halloween rendering Shirley Jackson'sThe Lotterya low-key picnic. It is the one night of the year when residents can commit any crime they wish including murder, with the nation's police taking the evening off. Such a holiday allows American residents to vent their rage without fear of incarceration.James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) has made a comfortable living selling home security systems protecting well-to-do families from purge criminals. He pulls up to his beautiful home, the kind of picturesque structure one would see next to the par-5 at a country club, and has dinner with his attractive family, including wife Mary (Lena Headey) and his two truculent teenagers (Adelaide Kane, Max Burkholder).Naturally, the Sandin's home has the state-of-the-art security system. As the purge alarm sounds, a sort of tornado warning siren, James presses a button and huge metal doors slide down to cover the structure. With security cameras surrounding the house, the Sandin family kicks back to watch the ""fun."" At this point, the film loses it.DeMonaco has assembled a terrific cast for the family, and each actor gives an earnest performance. Hawke especially has evolved into one of the best actors working today. Perhaps not destined for superstar status, his fine work raises ""The Purge"" several notches, akin to his great performance in the recent horror classicSinister.I don't have a problem with events ratcheting up the suspense, including an injured African-American man (Edwin Hodge) who runs into the neighborhood begging for help. He's being chased by a fiendish gang of Caucasian college students adorned in costumes, masks and machetes. You see, the dirty secret of the purge is low-income residents cannot afford security systems, and thus are the main targets during the night of murder -- a sort of final solution conveniently cleansing the land of poverty.This thrill-kill cult is led by an unblinking, sadistic ring leader (Rhys Wakefield) with all the subtlety of Charles Manson -- a character so over the top he capsizes the entire film. For multiple reasons, they surround the Sandin's home and prepare to break in, leading to the film's best scene when Hawke's James admits his security system is not foolproof, serving more as a deterrent.The film enters the neighborhood of dull routine as every person with a gun can fire with deadly expertise, and the method the cult breaks in is akin to Tonto pulling down jail bars with nothing more than a horse and rope. For reasons not entirely clear, the family is separated throughout the spatial house with hallways as endless as Kane's Xanadu.Less is more with material like this, but DeMonaco does not trust his audience. If you're going to film an analogy exposing a flawed society consumed with repressed violence, don't embrace the mayhem for box office appeal. He's created some interesting characters.

Except for one night every year where anything goes. Crime is a free for all for 12 hours and police and emergency services are unavailable until 7am the next morning.Ethan Hawke sells security systems, notably, to all of his wealthy neighbors in their gated community. The security systems basically are metal shields that come down over all windows/doors of the homes. On the night of 'The Purge' a man is wounded yelling for help in the middle of the street, of course the young son (maybe 13-14 years old) knows the passcode and unarms the security system and lets him inside. After doing so there's a little scuffle and the man runs off and hides in their large home. And of course they cannot find him until it's too late. Meanwhile, outside a group of young people (in their 20s I'd say) who are participating in 'The Purge' want the man who is inside their home. They give them a deadline to find and release him alive otherwise they will break in and kill that man, along with Ethan Hawke and his family.The film didn't have the scare factor I was expecting, the majority of the film was predictable, and like most movies had that one idiotic character (that being the son) who sets off a domino effect for everything bad to happen. The film was nothing special (84min run time?) and isn't worth a second viewing.

The ""purge"" is the one night a year that EVERYTHING is legal:  murder, mayhem, torture--ANYTHING to let the good citizens of this country vent.  That is the first big problem I had:  the movie alluded that if you were rich, everything would be fine--you can BUY your safety.  Furthermore, it seemed the only people interested in the purge, were affluent snobs who (I guess) were bored and had nothing better to do.  It seems this has taken care of unemployment, capital crimes, and just about everything else.  That sounds interesting.  And then there's the movie.Written by James DeMonaco (who also directed), it seems he had no idea what to do with his movie.  There are many scenes that just make no sense.  I won't give any away; you will be able to spot them a mile away!  In fact, this movie is just all over the place.  Its writer and director never knew what he wanted to do with his characters.  There is little backstory.  The movie opens with Ethan Hawke driving home so he can lock down his house and wait until the purge is over.  He sells security systems for the very affluent and feels untouchable in his mansion.  Trouble is, he is VERY touchable.  Trouble starts when his son sees some helpless person trying to find solace before he is slaughtered, and he lets him into their home.  It's all downhill from there.  The final scene just had me shaking my head in disbelief.The movie is rated R for violence and language.

You are on your own.&#34;You would think that this would unleash the &#34;HAVE NOT HORDES!&#34; to run rampant over all the poor rich people but that is not how it is written.  It is the rich folks who invest in the latest weaponry, sharpen their machete's and go after isolated Have Nots for sport and ultimately, one another.If I were writing the script for the sequel I would write that the wife and kids leave the gated community whose residence almost annihilate them.  The wife becomes politically active and is working to change this law where her kids have gone to live on the streets and are interested in revenge.  The boy was a computer and mechanical genius who learns how to disarm any security system guided by his late father.The kids join up with other have nots and form a war machine that will be directed on the gated community that killed their father in the next Purge.They clean sweep this community including wounding their own mother who comes into harms way trying to stop her kids from going against their pacifist raising.And then comes the hypocrisy...near the end of the 12 hour period, police of all ilks and the military have formed a perimeter around this community trying to catch the Have Nots  who perpetrated this on these &#34;poor, helpless&#34; rich people despite the fact that the law says no crime shall be illegal during this 12 hour period.The mother, possibly mortally wounded is carried away to...who knows, by her kids and the African American man who she and her family saves in the first PURGE.  They all escape the law enforcement and military round up having come in via para-sail or underground through the water drainage system.It could be called The Purge II: NEXT YEAR or The Purge II: Revenge of the Have Nots",5,SAW THIS IN THE THEATER FIRST,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,2265,"['liked', 'so', 'well', 'wanted', 'get', 'dvd', 'watch', 'again', 'again.Unlike', 'Zombies', 'case', 'were', 'unaware', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'REAL', 'could', 'really', 'happen.The', 'Purge', 'ultimate', 'finale', 'craziness', 'seeing', '34', 'government', '34', 'enemy', 'not', 'wanting', 'government', 'involved', 'lives.Government', 'movie', '34', 'Okay', '12', 'hours', 'one', 'day', 'year', 'WE', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'crime', 'illegal.There', 'will', 'be', 'government', 'assistance', 'as', 'far', 'police', 'fire', 'medical', 'are', 'own.', '34', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'unleash', '34', 'HAVE', 'NOT', 'HORDES', '34', 'run', 'rampant', 'poor', 'rich', 'people', 'not', 'how', 'written', 'rich', 'folks', 'who', 'invest', 'latest', 'weaponry', 'sharpen', 'machete', 'go', 'isolated', 'Have', 'Nots', 'sport', 'ultimately', 'one', 'another.If', 'were', 'writing', 'script', 'sequel', 'would', 'write', 'wife', 'kids', 'leave', 'gated', 'community', 'residence', 'almost', 'annihilate', 'wife', 'politically', 'active', 'working', 'change', 'law', 'where', 'kids', 'have', 'gone', 'live', 'streets', 'are', 'interested', 'revenge', 'boy', 'was', 'computer', 'mechanical', 'genius', 'who', 'how', 'disarm', 'security', 'system', 'guided', 'late', 'father.The', 'kids', 'join', 'up', 'other', 'have', 'nots', 'form', 'war', 'machine', 'will', 'be', 'directed', 'gated', 'community', 'killed', 'father', 'next', 'Purge.They', 'clean', 'sweep', 'community', 'including', 'wounding', 'own', 'mother', 'who', 'harms', 'way', 'trying', 'stop', 'kids', 'going', 'pacifist', 'raising.And', 'then', 'hypocrisy', 'end', '12', 'hour', 'period', 'police', 'ilks', 'military', 'have', 'formed', 'perimeter', 'community', 'trying', 'catch', 'Have', 'Nots', 'who', 'perpetrated', '34', 'poor', 'helpless', '34', 'rich', 'people', 'fact', 'law', 'crime', 'shall', 'be', 'illegal', '12', 'hour', 'period.The', 'mother', 'possibly', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'carried', 'away', 'who', 'kids', 'African', 'American', 'man', 'who', 'family', 'first', 'PURGE', 'escape', 'law', 'enforcement', 'military', 'round', 'having', 'come', 'para-sail', 'underground', 'water', 'drainage', 'system.It', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'Purge', 'II', 'NEXT', 'YEAR', 'Purge', 'II', 'Revenge', 'Have', 'Nots']",The Purge

1627164,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00BEIYGT8,Erik North,"[132, 162]","The premise behind writer/director James DeMonaco's film THE PURGE is indeed a fantastic one: set in the year 2022, when unemployment nationwide is down to just one percent, and crimes across the board are at an all-time low.  But what if the manner of getting it that was to allow a one-night ""purge"", in which violent behavior was actually sanctioned by the United States government, and largely to rid America of the poor and the indigent?  It is a premise that may seem outrageous; but so too was the idea of a surveillance state as depicted in George Orwell's classic 1948 novel ""1984""; and what has America become since 9/11 but a real-life surveillance state?  Under the right circumstances, it is completely possible that something like THE PURGE might come to pass.Ethan Hawke portrays a security systems designer whose entire neighborhood, located in the hills above West Los Angeles, owes its very security and safety to his security designs.  It becomes especially important during a twelve-hour time frame from 7 PM to 7 AM on March 21st and 22nd, 2022 known as ""The Purge"", in which violent behavior, including murder, theft, and even rape, will be allowed--and no police or emergency first responders will be on duty.  It is a thing that Hawke and his family, and their neighbors, have gotten used to; and they have also become largely callous when it comes to the potential victims of the Purge, namely the poor who don't have the ability to support themselves with any job or pay approaching anywhere close to what Hawke makes.  But on this particular Purge Night, one of Hawke's children (Max Burkholder), out of the goodness and conscience of his heart, lets a wounded black man (Edwin Hodge) enter the premises, which upsets Hawke tremendously.  To Hawke, Hodge is exactly the kind of target the Purge people want to kill; and when the leader (Rhys Wakefield) of one such Purge group comes to get Hodge, Hawke, his family, and their home come under siege from that group.  Hawke at first advocates handing over Hodge to them (given that the Purge group has already totally crippled what Hawke had once proclaimed a foolproof security system), but his wife (Lena Headey), daughter (Adelaide Kane) and Burkholder, appalled at his descent into cold-blooded ""survival of the fittest"", force the issue.  In the end, they are forced to endure much physical horror and psychological terror until the morning comes.  And does the madness really even end there?DeMonaco wrote and directed THE PURGE on a budget of just slightly more than $3 million; and apart from the sometimes shaky and unsteady camera work (a trait that came from the quasi-documentary style of films like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY), every penny of that $3 million budget shows up here.  There are a number of things that don't quite work the way they should; and some of the acting, especially by Wakefield as the chief Purge instigator, is overly hammy.  In terms of what DeMonaco is basically trying to do with what is certainly a fantastic and crazy premise (one that seems to take a number of shots at right-wing elements of America, up to and including the Tea Party), however, THE PURGE is effective enough.  There is something extraordinarily ironic at rich, upscale people turning on one another, either for harboring a ""filthy swine"" such as Hodge, or for having their supposedly ""foolproof"" security system exposed.  In many ways, it derives its power and plot from many films: the original ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13; A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (the masks worn by Wakefield and his posse); THE BIRDS; NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; STRAW DOGS (the original 1971 Sam Peckinpah classic); and even THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND (Peckinpah's last, released in 1983).  But these are films that have a kinetic and psychological power that very few other ""horror"" or ""thriller"" films of this kind can have without spiraling into hyper-violent absurdity, and they are films that DeMonaco clearly has learned a lot from.Hawke does a fairly good job of being a somewhat callous capitalist who grossly underrates the impact that the violent behavior of the night of the Purge will have on his family.  Headey also does a credible job as his wife, who questions his motivations and his morality when, at first, he decides to hand Hodge over to Wakefield, instead of doing the right thing and fighting for his humanity.  In the final analysis, and in terms of its credibility and plausibility, it has to be said that THE PURGE isn't necessarily the best psychological ""horror"" or ""thriller"" film that has ever been.  But it is effective enough to deliver what it promises for its eighty-five minute running time.",4,"THE PURGE--Not Quite A Masterpiece, But Good Enough For What It Tries To Do",1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,4688,"['premise', 'writer/director', 'James', 'DeMonaco', 'film', 'THE', 'PURGE', 'indeed', 'fantastic', 'one', 'set', 'year', '2022', 'when', 'unemployment', 'nationwide', 'down', 'just', 'one', 'percent', 'crimes', 'board', 'are', 'all-time', 'low', 'what', 'manner', 'getting', 'was', 'allow', 'one-night', 'purge', 'violent', 'behavior', 'was', 'actually', 'sanctioned', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'largely', 'rid', 'America', 'poor', 'indigent', 'premise', 'may', 'seem', 'outrageous', 'so', 'too', 'was', 'idea', 'surveillance', 'state', 'depicted', 'George', 'Orwell', 'classic', '1948', '1984', 'America', 'become', '9/11', 'real-life', 'surveillance', 'state', 'right', 'circumstances', 'completely', 'possible', 'something', 'THE', 'PURGE', 'might', 'come', 'pass.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'security', 'systems', 'designer', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'located', 'hills', 'West', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'very', 'security', 'safety', 'security', 'designs', 'especially', 'important', 'twelve-hour', 'time', 'frame', '7', 'PM', '7', 'AM', 'March', '21st', '22nd', '2022', 'known', 'Purge', 'violent', 'behavior', 'including', 'murder', 'theft', 'even', 'rape', 'will', 'be', 'allowed', 'police', 'emergency', 'first', 'responders', 'will', 'be', 'duty', 'thing', 'Hawke', 'family', 'neighbors', 'have', 'gotten', 'used', 'have', 'also', 'become', 'largely', 'callous', 'when', 'potential', 'victims', 'Purge', 'namely', 'poor', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ability', 'support', 'job', 'pay', 'approaching', 'anywhere', 'close', 'what', 'Hawke', 'particular', 'Purge', 'Night', 'one', 'Hawke', 'children', 'Max', 'Burkholder', 'goodness', 'conscience', 'heart', 'wounded', 'black', 'man', 'Edwin', 'Hodge', 'enter', 'premises', 'Hawke', 'tremendously', 'Hawke', 'Hodge', 'exactly', 'kind', 'target', 'Purge', 'people', 'want', 'kill', 'when', 'leader', 'Rhys', 'Wakefield', 'one', 'such', 'Purge', 'group', 'get', 'Hodge', 'Hawke', 'family', 'home', 'come', 'siege', 'group', 'Hawke', 'first', 'advocates', 'handing', 'Hodge', 'given', 'Purge', 'group', 'already', 'totally', 'crippled', 'what', 'Hawke', 'had', 'once', 'proclaimed', 'foolproof', 'security', 'system', 'wife', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'daughter', 'Adelaide', 'Kane', 'Burkholder', 'appalled', 'descent', 'cold-blooded', 'survival', 'fittest', 'force', 'issue', 'end', 'are', 'forced', 'endure', 'much', 'physical', 'horror', 'psychological', 'terror', 'morning', 'madness', 'really', 'even', 'end', 'there', 'DeMonaco', 'wrote', 'directed', 'THE', 'PURGE', 'budget', 'just', 'slightly', 'more', '3', 'million', 'apart', 'sometimes', 'shaky', 'unsteady', 'camera', 'work', 'trait', 'came', 'quasi-documentary', 'style', 'films', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'penny', '3', 'million', 'budget', 'up', 'here', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'way', 'should', 'acting', 'especially', 'Wakefield', 'chief', 'Purge', 'instigator', 'overly', 'hammy', 'terms', 'what', 'DeMonaco', 'basically', 'trying', 'do', 'what', 'certainly', 'fantastic', 'crazy', 'premise', 'one', 'take', 'number', 'shots', 'right-wing', 'elements', 'America', 'up', 'including', 'Tea', 'Party', 'however', 'THE', 'PURGE', 'effective', 'enough', 'something', 'extraordinarily', 'ironic', 'rich', 'upscale', 'people', 'turning', 'one', 'either', 'harboring', 'filthy', 'swine', 'such', 'Hodge', 'having', 'supposedly', 'foolproof', 'security', 'system', 'exposed', 'many', 'ways', 'power', 'plot', 'many', 'films', 'original', 'ASSAULT', 'ON', 'PRECINCT', '13', 'A', 'CLOCKWORK', 'ORANGE', 'masks', 'worn', 'Wakefield', 'posse', 'BIRDS', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', 'original', '1971', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'classic', 'even', 'THE', 'OSTERMAN', 'WEEKEND', 'Peckinpah', 'last', 'released', '1983', 'are', 'films', 'have', 'kinetic', 'psychological', 'power', 'very', 'few', 'other', 'horror', 'thriller', 'films', 'kind', 'can', 'have', 'spiraling', 'hyper-violent', 'absurdity', 'are', 'films', 'DeMonaco', 'clearly', 'learned', 'lot', 'from.Hawke', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'somewhat', 'callous', 'capitalist', 'who', 'grossly', 'impact', 'violent', 'behavior', 'night', 'Purge', 'will', 'have', 'family', 'Headey', 'also', 'credible', 'job', 'wife', 'who', 'questions', 'motivations', 'morality', 'when', 'first', 'hand', 'Hodge', 'Wakefield', 'instead', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'fighting', 'humanity', 'final', 'analysis', 'terms', 'credibility', 'plausibility', 'be', 'said', 'THE', 'PURGE', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'best', 'psychological', 'horror', 'thriller', 'film', 'ever', 'been', 'effective', 'enough', 'deliver', 'what', 'eighty-five', 'minute', 'running', 'time']",The Purge

Controversy has always been a means for creating revenue, especially in the United States where people tend to flock to scandalous news stories.  But, before you come after me for generalizing, hear me out.  The Purge, which is the subject of controversy due to comments made by James DeMonaco in relation to The Tea Party and NRA, appear to have stirred quite the commotion for a film that would typically never register on the average movie-goer's radar.  But, when roughly one-third of the United States is clearly conservative, attacking their base with a overbearingly apocalyptic film seems like a great way to aggravate that one-third, while still forcing them to go see the film in order to figure out what all the talk is about.  When you take that logic into account, mix it with a liberally-charged subject matter and the unremarkably high interest for blood-spillage from teenagers and young adults, you have quite the cocktail for success.The Purge, directed by James DeMonaco (Staten Island), stars Ethan Hawke as James Sandin, a home security developer that sells security systems to home owners in anticipation of a yearly 12-hour period, called ""The Purge.""  During the 12 hour window, the New Founding Fathers of America (government) allow Americans to ""purge"" themselves of crime, hate, and murder by legalizing these acts (with certain exceptions).  James Sandin and his wife, Mary (Lena Headey), along with their two kids, Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Henry (Tony Oller), decide to stay in for ""the purge,"" believing in its cause, but not partaking in the events.  However, the evening of The Purge takes a turn for the worst when Henry aids a bloody stranger (Edwin Hodge) begging for salvation outside the Sandin's residence.  The man's assailants, including the cryptic polite stranger (Rhys Wakefield), demand his release before they ""purge"" the entire Sandin family, too.  Arija Bareikis and Chris Mulkey also star in supporting roles.It's difficult to watch this film without focusing on the underlying themes that are completely in your face for its entirety.  The idiotic rational featured in this film states that America is better off if its citizens are given a 12 hour window to commit atrocities.  On the flip side, the government believes that if Americans are given this 12-hour window of ""freedom,"" it alleviates crime and promotes job growth, along with economic prosperity for the remaining 364 days of the year.  Still, it's bothersome to think that people can simply go on a 12-hour crime/killing spree, and just go back to their regular lives the following day without any carry over.  They say once you've killed once, it's likely you'll do it again.  However, with that logic in mind, it's difficult to imagine any of these individuals would be able to wait a full year to kill or commit a crime again.  This film obviously gives the mind plenty to contemplate and it certainly creates a different way of thinking about the future direction of civilization.  Regardless, the film's premise is a complete and utter rip-off of the classic 1967 Star Trek episode, The Return of the Archons, in which an evil dictator rewards his minions with a similar 12-hour window to pillage and plunder an entire planet's civilians.Themes aside, there's very little about The Purge that separates itself from the array of unlawful entry films, not to mention the classic slasher films featuring Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees.  The abundance of stupid mistakes and clich&eacute;s (like characters that still hide under the bed) really hurt this film, especially in the later half after the film turns into more a ""so stupid it's funny"" horror flick than a spine-tingling thriller.  For instance, if the son hadn't invited the random stranger into his house, the whole situation could have been avoided.  Of course, that wouldn't make for a very interesting movie - but it always takes something away from the film when the majority of viewers don't believe the situation is visible, especially in the horror genre.  For there, there's a series of irritating questions, like why are a large group of blood-thirsty individuals hell bent on ""purging"" spending so much time on won random bum/war veteran.  It makes the film feel like a whole lot of wasted time with very little reward.To be honest, the lack of star-power hasn't been a very big concern for the horror genre.  However, The Purge's leading man, Ethan Hawke, is far from an unrecognizable face.  Surprisingly, Hawke makes an enjoyable protagonist, but he just lacked the proper antagonist in this film.  His nemesis for the film, credited as the ""polite stranger"" is reminiscent of a watered-down version of Heath Ledger's joker persona.  If the joker were 15 years younger and starring in a CW version of Batman, he may have resembled the performance of the relatively unknown Rhys Wakefield.  And, to be honest, the kid (Henry) is rather creepy in the film, even though he turns out to be utterly harmless.  Tony Oller's portrayal is commendable, and even though he had the look of a future Michael Myers follower, (small spoiler) he turns out to be the voice of reason in the family's darkest hour.Overall, The Purge is a silly movie filled with a ton of potshots at America.  The film is chalk full of liberal bias, but is it anti-American?  Well, that's a matter of personal opinion, but the fact that a film like this can be made (even if the director is using his own personal criticism) means the First Amendment is alive and well.  The premise of this film is intriguing, although the execution is comical.  This is a difficult film to recommend, but it squeaks through mostly due to the high amount of enjoyment it provides should you be lucky enough to see it with a large group of people.  Due to the highly successful opening weekend, The Purge will no doubt have a sequel on the way.  Odds are on summer 2014.Overall Grade:  C-FNDNreview.com",2,'The Purge' a theme-driven attack on America?,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,6075,"['Films', 'make', 'political', 'statements', 'are',

One what if scenario that is an interesting topic of discussion is what if violence was allowed to take place without any repercussions?""The Purge"" takes that topic and we see the consequences. Ethan Hawke plays James Sandin, a man who essentially gets paid for selling security systems. He of course has his own top notch security system in place. Lena Headey plays his peaceful housewife Mary while Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder play the kids.The topic of what would happen if one day a state took the day off from regulating laws, and lets  its people become as violent as they want to be is an interesting topic for sure.  Of course, we know the consequences would be disastrous.  Without laws governing our behavior, a lot of people's fantasies and urges would take a deadly turn.  The movie does a pretty good job of showing that side of the story.In the beginning, Sandin and his family are pretty supportive of the process (as long as long they don't have to get their own hands dirty, and it doesn't affect them who cares right?) Then when they become the victims of the very thing they support they do a complete 360. What a surprise huh? (sarcasm)However, director  James Demonaco doesn't stop the theme of the movie to be just about the consequences of a lawless society, no he throws a lot of other themes in there. For instance, underneath the whole attack on the Sandin family for harboring a homeless man there is a subtext here for class warfare and prejudice.  The ""purgers"" keep referring to the homeless man as a ""homeless pig"" someone whose essentially (in their eyes)an undesirable entity that must be rubbed out just because he is not part of the rich elite class that James Sandin represents.I liked the character development though there could have been a bit more. Sure the Sandins are only concerned for the well being once the violence erupts, but they have their moment of enlightenment, and we all know that things will change from then on.Of course the movie isn't perfect and has a few flaws , but overall it's pretty entertaining.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I remember when the trailer to THE PURGE first came out and the premise was laid out, my good friend Bollywood Bob blurted out: ""You mean I could jaywalk all night long and I WON'T GET A TICKET?!"" Yes, Bollywood Bob, that's exactly right. During the Purge, you can jaywalk with immunity.In the year 2022 it's good to be a merchant of home security systems. In 2022 America is experiencing a remarkable era of peace and prosperity. Unemployment stands at 1%. Crime is at an unprecedented low. There's barely a whiff of Violence... except on one scheduled night, when the hooligans and the freaks and the mass murderers come out like sharks circling the water.March 21, 2022, and sucks for you if you lose track of time. When it strikes 7 o'clock in the evening, you had best be hunkered down in a safe place. Or you'd best be packin'. In this near future, the United States' new founding fathers have instituted the Purge, an annual twelve-hour period in which any crime is legal (and encouraged) and all emergency services are suspended. The working theory is that this state of anarchy serves as a psychological release valve. It's the one night that allows the populace to unleash its pent-up aggression. The movie's premise begs incredulity, but you can't deny its intrigue. And, yeah, it's a fairly novel concept. Note that a STAR TREK episode - ""Return of the Archons"" - did it first and four decades ago.3 out of 5 stars for THE PURGE, a film that is half social allegory, half home-invasion thriller. With its nifty hook and its (mostly) good cast, it should've been better than it was. Instead, there are any number of superior home invasion thrillers out there (THE STRANGERS, FUNNY GAMES, PANIC ROOM, WAIT UNTIL DARK). Mostly, THE PURGE is sabotaged by weak execution and by director James DeMonaco's pulling his punches. The result is a tour de blah down the clich&eacute; factory. Lots of fumbling in the dark. Some anemic scares. Sorry, hopeful gorehound.On the good side, the social satire comes across as sharply here as it does in, say, THE HUNGER GAMES. It's a premise that provokes thought and triggers some interesting discussions. I like that Ethan Hawke's character, James Sandin, who hawks home security systems, comes off as vaguely scumbaggish. Sandin is a man of his time. As such, he reacts with ingrained apathy and with reflex rationalization towards the atrocities committed during the Purge. It's been drummed into him that the Purge is good for the country. It unburdens the economy, never mind that it achieves this by eradicating the poor, the needy, the defenseless, and whoever else that doesn't contribute to society. His wife Mary (Lena Headey) is equally indifferent. It's hard to rage against something that's made you so rich. James Sandin, who is good at his job, has sold his security system to practically everyone in his affluent, gated community. He decorates his home with blue flowers as a show of support for the Purge. Leave it to their kids to conjure up the elephant in the room - Are they doing the right thing? To which one parent remarks: ""Just remember all the good the Purge does, okay? That's all that matters.""Me, I have trouble getting behind horror flicks in which the protagonists usher in their own doom, so there's that. I don't think I'm spoilering things when I say that, yeah, the intruders breach the Sandin household. But did you - as I did - yell at the kid when he did what he did? And did you then check yourself? Because what the kid did was stupid, yes, but he did it from a goodhearted place.Can this family under siege survive the night without forfeiting their humanity? More importantly, can you stomach this family? Will you find them likable enough to have a rooting interest? Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey deliver steady performances. It doesn't mean their characters are ones that you'd invite over. Or do you chafe under the collar because they're direct reflections of yourself if presented with the same harrowing choices? And I have to say it: The children are super annoying. The eccentric son, Charlie (Max Burkholder), is tapped as the one who asks the hard questions, so there's something to that. But, otherwise, he's such a damp, poorly etched character. The other kid, Zoey (Adelaide Kane), wastes copious screen time either being mopey or stupidly running away or in a state of catatonia. Turns out, the most likable person is the homeless guy (Edwin Hodge). The most interesting person would have to be Rhys Wakefield's creepy but very polite leader of a group of entitled psychopaths.Quick aside: Doesn't the boy's tricked-out, remote controlled toy tank with the ruined baby doll on top cry out ""Hey, contrived plot device over here!"" to you?A SPOILERS alert for this paragraph: For all the good acting work Ethan Hawke puts in, my favorite moment is the pool room scene in which he lets loose and unleashes his inner Straw Dog on a bunch of masked intruders. It's probably the film's highlight action sequence. Hawke does one thing here that is really gratifying. He puts down the intruders and then administers the finishing shots. How often does the good guy not finish off his opponent only to have the creep come back as a last-minute scare?THE PURGE raked in around $89 million on a $3 million budget. So of course there'll be a sequel and it's almost here. But will it dive as deeply into morality plays and class divides? Me, I'd be cool with a prequel in which we learn more about those game-changing founding fathers and we see what went down during the inaugural Purge.Just the other day my good friend Bollywood Bob crashed over at my place, and I heard him muttering in his sleep, something about the Purge and the need to ""violate, annihilate, and cleanse our souls.""

Would you participate in the purge? What kind of activities would you or those that you know of engage in during a purge? What would we do for safety if you decided to stay in? Would you band up with your neighbors? Could you even trust your neighbors?The idea that in trying to be above it all, the film's protagonist becomes savages in of themselves by trying to protect their home is intriguing. There's also a surprising plot twist in the film's final act. Critics and audiences alike have debated about whether the film is able to fully take advantage of its ingenious concept. Whether The Purge fully took advantage of this idea isn't my issue with the film.My problem with The Purge is that the film mistakes sudden gun blasts for genuine suspense. My problem with The Purge is that their isn't enough teasing & taunting between the protagonist and the antagonist. If there was a purge occurring, if my home was being invaded, some of the emotions I would feel during that time would be fear, apprehension, tension, unease, confusion, disorientation, claustrophobia, etc. - emotions I never once felt while watching this film. That's definitely a problem. My problem with The Purge is that it lacks an understanding of how to craft suspense, terror and panic. Instead, melodrama involving the main characters takes the forefront distracting from the film's main event- The Purge.Writer / director James DeMonaco knows how to make a good story. He just doesn't know how to tell it, stage it or properly execute it.

There are two surprising twists, but you pretty well knew what was going to happen and who was going to die from the beginning.The annual Purge lasts for 12 hours in which you could commit any crimes you wished without consequences.  It was believed that this was part of the reason crime rates are negligible at this time (year 2022).  The Purge allows people a release for all the hate, anger and aggression bottled up inside them.  James (Ethan Hawke) sells security systems that keep the people safe who do not feel the need to be violent during the Purge.  He is the top seller in his company, and specifically in his own neighborhood.  The night of the Purge, James arms the system.

1627186,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B00BEIYGT8,I'm Right,"[10, 20]","The idea of the Purge is pretty original and neat. While it's not exactly practical it's an interesting idea that can touch upon a lot of different ideas like how far are you willing to go for the greater good and such. And while these questions were raised during the movie, the actual story was dumber than a bag of rocks. With all this potential, in all these different directions the story could've gone, it chooses home invasion. A pretty unremarkable one at that.Ethan Hawke and his family are rich and therefore have a home security system, so they lock themselves in and get ready to enjoy the night in comfy safety. However a bunch of things go wrong, and all of the potential suspense is quickly dissipated due to dumb decisions made by impulsive characters. The first thing that happens is the son sees a guy outside begging for help, so he unlocks the security and le-wait. Wait. How does the young son know the passcode to the security? Why would he know? *Sigh* buckle up because we're taking the Plothole Express to Stupidsville. So the son knows the passcode and lets the stranger into the house. Then a group of vigilantes come by and want the family to release the stranger so they can kill him.This is where it just gets worse. The message of morality is smacked in your face, and it's a flawed message at that. 'Even though this purge is helping America in the long run, how morally bankrupt have we become that we'll send an innocent man to the wolves?' That's what this movie tells you basically. But before we get all misty eyed and start applauding, let's think about a few things first. Would YOU risk your entire family's life for a total stranger? Your parents, your children, your brothers and sisters and husbands and wives, would you endanger them for a total stranger? Didn't think so. This stupid kid let the guy in, as far as I'm concerned the kid gets to be thrown out too for mindlessly risking his entire family's lives.So then they finally find the guy hiding in their house and they subdue him. Before they do however the stranger keeps going ""I'm not gonna die tonight"" and the family (except the stupid son) are like ""get this guy outta here so we don't die"", but after they're tying the guy to a chair to get him out, everyone but the dad gets cold feet and starts going ""what have we become!?"" while the stranger goes ""let me die so your family can live"". Yes, everyone starts flip-flopping their morality for no reason at all. Also when they're trying to present the guy, the dad, who suddenly forgot everything going on, decides to take forever with throwing the stranger out there, then changes his mind (but still leaves the stranger tied up). What's the point here, one family can't stand to watch someone pull the trigger?*Spoilers* So predictable mayhem ensues and the dad dies. Congratulations sonny, hope saving a random guy who you'll never see again was worth growing up a bastard for the rest of your life. I was hoping as the dad was dying he grabbed his son by the collar, got up to his face, and said ""you.. did... this.."" then dies, traumatizing that kid for life. Also the vigilantes outside consider themselves very intelligent people, yet for all their supposed intelligence they all completely spread apart and wander around the house by themselves, not being attracted to gunshots or fighting, or using their overwhelming numbers as an advantage. Same with the family, everyone splits apart, the kid is given a gun and a flashlight, and when dangers nearby, makes sure to shake his flashlight around because he wants everyone to know his location. The mom also wanders around her house the entire time with her arm completely stretched out holding a pistol. Because if someone's hiding in a room ready to attack, it's best to hold the gun as far away from you as possible. Then the neighbors hear the commotion and come to the rescue at the last minute, or so it seems. Instead they want to torture and kill the family, but not before reciting some stupid pointless ritual to drag out the scene, eventually getting saved by the stranger at the last minute(again). So what does the family do? They disarm their blood lusting neighbors and sit around with them awkwardly for the rest of the purge time. It's like all this crazy stuff happened and the only way to conclude it is by a scolding.This movie starts with an interesting concept, shrinks down to a little home invasion story, then starts slapping you with it's heavy handed message. The story is propelled along by stupid, illogical, and impulsive decisions. The only good that can come out of this movie is if they actually expand on the idea and show more society on a bigger scale instead of just one family. Other than that, screw this movie.",1,"Interesting Idea, Really REALLY Dumb Story",1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,4766,"['idea', 'Purge', 'pretty', 'original', 'neat', 'not', 'exactly', 'practical', 'interesting', 'idea', 'can', 'touch', 'lot', 'different', 'ideas', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'greater', 'good', 'such', 'questions', 'were', 'raised', 'movie', 'actual', 'story', 'was', 'dumber', 'bag', 'rocks', 'potential', 'different', 'directions', 'story', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'home', 'invasion', 'pretty', 'unremarkable', 'one', 'that.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'family', 'are', 'rich', 'therefore', 'have', 'home', 'security', 'system', 'lock', 'get', 'ready', 'enjoy', 'night', 'comfy', 'safety', 'However', 'bunch', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'potential', 'suspense', 'quickly', 'dissipated', 'due', 'dumb', 'decisions', 'made', 'impulsive', 'characters', 'first', 'thing', 'son', 'guy', 'begging', 'help', 'security', 'le-wait', 'Wait', 'How', 'young', 'son', 'know', 'passcode', 'security', 'Why', 'would', 'know', '*Sigh*', 'buckle', 'up', ""'re"", 'taking', 'Plothole', 'Express', 'Stupidsville', 'son', 'passcode', 'stranger', 'house', 'Then', 'group', 'vigilantes', 'come', 'want', 'family', 'release', 'stranger', 'can', 'kill', 'him.This', 'where', 'just', 'worse', 'message', 'morality', 'smacked', 'face', 'flawed', 'message', 'purge', 'helping', 'America', 'long', 'run', 'how', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'have', 'become', ""'ll"", 'send', 'innocent', 'man', 'wolves', 'what', 'movie', 'basically', 'get', 'misty', 'eyed', 'start', 'applauding', 'let', 'think', 'few', 'things', 'first', 'Would', 'YOU', 'risk', 'entire', 'family', 'life', 'total', 'stranger', 'parents', 'children', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'husbands', 'wives', 'would', 'endanger', 'total', 'stranger', 'Did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'stupid', 'kid', 'let', 'guy', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'kid', 'be', 'thrown', 'out', 'too', 'mindlessly', 'risking', 'entire', 'family', 'lives.So', 'then', 'finally', 'find', 'guy', 'hiding', 'house', 'subdue', 'do', 'however', 'stranger', 'going', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'die', 'tonight', 'family', 'stupid', 'son', 'are', 'get', 'guy', 'outta', 'here', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', ""'re"", 'tying', 'guy', 'chair', 'get', 'out', 'everyone', 'dad', 'cold', 'feet', 'going', 'what', 'have', 'become', 'stranger', 'let', 'die', 'so', 'family', 'can', 'live', 'Yes', 'everyone', 'flip-flopping', 'morality', 'reason', 'Also', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'present', 'guy', 'dad', 'who', 'suddenly', 'forgot', 'everything', 'going', 'take', 'forever', 'throwing', 'stranger', 'there', 'then', 'mind', 'still', 'stranger', 'tied', 'up', 'What', 'point', 'here', 'one', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watch', 'someone', 'pull', 'trigger', 'So', 'predictable', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'dad', 'Congratulations', 'sonny', 'hope', 'saving', 'random', 'guy', 'who', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'worth', 'growing', 'up', 'bastard', 'rest', 'life', 'was', 'hoping', 'dad', 'was', 'dying', 'grabbed', 'son', 'collar', 'got', 'up', 'face', 'said', 'you..', 'did', 'this..', 'then', 'traumatizing', 'kid', 'life', 'Also', 'vigilantes', 'consider', 'very', 'intelligent', 'people', 'yet', 'supposed', 'intelligence', 'completely', 'spread', 'apart', 'wander', 'house', 'not', 'being', 'attracted', 'gunshots', 'fighting', 'using', 'overwhelming', 'numbers', 'advantage', 'Same', 'family', 'everyone', 'splits', 'apart', 'kid', 'given', 'gun', 'flashlight', 'when', 'dangers', 'nearby', 'sure', 'shake', 'flashlight', 'around', 'everyone', 'know', 'location', 'mom', 'also', 'house', 'entire', 'time', 'arm', 'completely', 'stretched', 'out', 'holding', 'pistol', 'someone', 'hiding', 'room', 'ready', 'attack', 'best', 'hold', 'gun', 'far', 'away', 'possible', 'Then', 'neighbors', 'hear', 'commotion', 'come', 'rescue', 'last', 'minute', 'so', 'Instead', 'want', 'torture', 'kill', 'family', 'not', 'reciting', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'ritual', 'drag', 'out', 'scene', 'eventually', 'getting', 'saved', 'stranger', 'last', 'minute', 'again', 'So', 'what', 'family', 'do', 'disarm', 'blood', 'lusting', 'neighbors', 'sit', 'around', 'awkwardly', 'rest', 'purge', 'time', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'happened', 'only', 'way', 'conclude', 'scolding.This', 'movie', 'interesting', 'concept', 'down', 'little', 'home', 'invasion', 'story', 'then', 'slapping', 'heavy', 'handed', 'message', 'story', 'propelled', 'stupid', 'illogical', 'impulsive', 'decisions', 'only', 'good', 'can', 'come', 'movie', 'actually', 'expand', 'idea', 'show', 'more', 'society', 'bigger', 'scale', 'instead', 'just', 'one', 'family', 'Other', 'screw', 'movie']",The Purge

1627189,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00BEIYGT8,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[4, 6]","When I first saw commercials for THE PURGE, it looked like every other home-invasion survival horror film that's been produced over the last several years; gleeful homicidal maniacs wearing creepy masks break into the home of a wealthy white-bread family, and the family has to fight them off. And with Ethan Hawke, one of the more overrated actors currently working, as the star, it had even less attractive qualities to me. But after reading about the concept behind the film, I decided to give writer/director James DeMonaco's film a try, because from a high-concept standpoint, THE PURGE sounded quite exciting.Well, the concept is still exciting, but the film doesn't get beyond the lowest-common-denominator garbage that it always looked like.In the United States of the not-too-distant future, poverty and crime are at all-time lows thanks to a group known as The New Founding Fathers (which we never see or hear about in specifics) who are now running the country. To offset the crippling economy and extreme criminality that had plagued the country just prior to the Fathers coming into power, they institute ""The Purge"", a 12-hour period of time where all crime, especially violent crime, is not only legal, but encouraged. At the heart of this film is the Sandin family (Hawke and Lena Headey as the parents, Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder as the kids). James (Hawke) is a salesman of home security systems, and thanks to the Purge, he's become very successful. Mary (Headey) seems to be a stay-at-home mom, Zoey (Kane) is the mid-teen daughter seeing the older boy her father forbids her to see, and Charlie (Burkholder) is the tween son with a brain, playing with his remote-controlled tank/creepy doll-head. It's the day of the Purge, and they lock down their home for the night, but a homeless man (Edwin Hodge) outside is allowed in the home by the naive Charlie, and a pack of young preppy killers led by Rhys Wakefield (whose character credit is Polite Leader) demand that the Sandins release the ""filthy homeless man"" to their murderous urges, or they will smash down the barricades their house has and kill everyone. Morality and the protective urges are at conflict, but as you can predict, the preppies with their creepy masks and sing-song lunacy enter and the Sandins have to make a stand.Never mind that the second and third acts of the film play out almost exactly as you would think they would, aside from a moronic and telegraphed 11th-hour ""twist"". Never mind that everything that DeMonaco does with this film, from a visual standpoint, is totally uninspired and uninteresting. Never mind that the performances in the film are of the check-cashing variety, and that the members of the Sandin family are, naturally, morons in this situation. And never mind that James Sandin is a totally moral vacuum of a protagonist; how are we supposed to root for a man whose livelihood has been considerably improved by this event? If that was all the film was going to be, then it could have literally been recycled from dozens if not hundreds of the same type of film over the past several years. What really annoys me is the utter waste of a really powerful social, political and economic commentary that this film all but squanders by focusing on just this one incident with these specific people. If DeMonaco, who also wrote the abysmal remake of John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 as well as the totally unwatchable werewolf horror-romance, SKINWALKERS, decided to focus more on building a world that these characters inhabit rather than just going to the cheap adrenaline rush of the home-invasion thriller, he might have had something really special. For instance, poverty and homelessness are potentially at such a low rate because it's the homeless and poor people that are being murdered on the night of The Purge.

1627193,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B00BEIYGT8,J. B. Hoyos,"[1, 3]","****** No Plot Spoilers *******It is the year 2022.  A law has been passed which implements the Purge.  For one day only, from 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M., all violent crime, including murder, is legal.  (Politicians, of course, are exempt; they always are from radical laws.)  James Sandin (Ethan Hawke, ""Sinister"") has become rich selling high tech home security systems to his neighbors.  He and his wife, Mary (Lena Headey, ""Laid to Rest""), support the Purge; their children, ironically, question its morality, especially the youngest child, their precocious, nerdy son, Charlie [Max Burkholder, ""Children of the Corn"" (2009)].  This year, the Sandins are plunged into a twelve hour nightmare of blood and betrayal when a homeless war vet---pursued by a group of murderous yuppies---seeks refuge inside their mansion.James DeMonaco's ""The Purge"" is a clever morality play that reminded me of an episode of ""The Twilight Zone.""  I had to watch this provocative thriller twice before penning my review.  My girlfriend, Tammy, who gave it to me as an early Halloween present, was pleasantly surprised by my fascination with it.  She and I watched the film together and thoroughly enjoyed it for its gruesome violence, unsuspecting twists, and thought-provoking commentary on our country's violent culture where capital punishment, euthanasia, and abortion are legal.  Many of us, including myself, are not concerned about these highly controversial issues as long as they don't harm us.  However, our moral values quickly change when we are the victims.  The Sandin family rethinks their support of the controversial Purge when they become the targets in lieu of the homeless, the poor, and the unwanted who are the intended targets.At first glance, potential viewers would think that the Purge would never happen in this country.  We are too civilized for that.  Millions thought abortion would never be legalized.  Who would have thought Hitler would sanction the murder of over six million Jews?  What kind of culture brought the Nazi Regime into existence?  In ""The Purge,"" the ""freaks"" who attack the Sandins wear masks.  Many of us wear masks throughout our lives.  We smile on the outside while hate, envy, bitterness and other sins eat away at us from the inside.  There are other methods of purging ourselves of these feeling without committing violent acts.  This is what distinguishes us from the animals--our ability to make choices.  On Purge night, we revert to our basic animal nature.  If given the opportunity, how many of us would participate in the Purge?  Everyone has that neighbor, coworker, or relative they have fantasized about killing.  For one night a year, the Purge allows us to turn our fantasies of killing into horrid reality.The only bonus feature that the Blu-ray has, other than English subtitles and a widescreen presentation, is a ""making of"" featurette titled ""Surviving the Night.""  Approximately eight to nine minutes in length, it provides interesting commentary from various members of the cast and crew.  Basically, the actors describe the film's horrifying content and the director describes his intention of making it provocative.  [There are also movie trailers galore for recently released new and classic thrillers from Universal Studios such as ""Contraband,"" starring Mark Wahlberg, and ""Scarface"" (Al Pacino)].  Overall, ""The Purge"" is a must see for fans of provocative, futuristic horror involving desperate societies whose morals have become twisted such as ""Logan's Run"" (Michael York) and ""Soylent Green"" (Charlton Heston).  Watch it with a group of friends and conduct a roundtable; it makes a great topic for discussion.Joseph B.

1627201,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00BEIYGT8,John's Horror Corner,"[43, 57]","The opening scenes introduce us to a dystopian futuristic America in which we have overcome staggering recessions, unemployment and crime rates.  Everyone seems happy and at peace with the means that provide this thriving economy.So what do they have to thank?  The Purge.  The Purge is a 12-hour period during which all crime is legal and all police, medical and emergency services are suspended.  Radio and news casts bombard viewers with soma-popping Brave New World mantras about ""unleashing the beast within"" to ""cleanse [or purge] our inherently violent nature.""What's most interesting about this society is that The Purge is embraced by most everyone.  Sure, there are media debates on how The Purge ""targets"" the poor who can't afford to defend themselves, but even the wealthy--with their armored home security systems--socialize, talk about what they're doing during The Purge or ""purge"" together in hunting parties.All of the pro-Purge political views are presented through an upper class filter--more specifically, the pro-Purge mindset of James Sandin (Ethan Hawke; Sinister, Daybreakers), a home security system salesman who lives in a ritzy neighborhood full of fake, well-to-do smiling neighbors.  This year, instead of attending a party, James is spending a quiet purge with his wife Mary (Lena Headey; Game of Thrones, Dredd, The Cave, The Brothers Grimm), son Charlie (Max Burkholder) and daughter Zooey (Adelaide Kane).James' family is less embracing of The Purge than the rest of the neighborhood but, for fear of death, they abide by the social standard but do not themselves partake.  Catching more of our attention is James.  His security system sales are booming, he's boat shopping and he talks a big game about supporting The Purge but when he justifies its value or explains to his son why he has never felt the urge to purge there is more than a dash of a hesitation in his tone.Things begin to go wrong for the Sandins when Max sympathizes with an injured man.  He hears his cries for help on the surveillance system and disarms the security for long enough to let the man into the house for safety.  Shortly thereafter, a group of over-educated young adults led by polite stranger with an intensely striking sense of rich kid entitlement demand that the Sandins release the injured victim into their lethal care as a Purge tribute.  If the Sandins don't, the strangers threaten to penetrate the security system and kill everyone.  That's what you get from the preview and I won't give you any more except to say that things get interesting, intense, gory, fun (for violent film fans) and equal parts predictable and unpredictable.I thought all of the actors did a fine job.  Solid performances across the board!  Some may consider the polite stranger (Rhys Wakefield) to be pretty hammed up, but I thought his supervillainous, sociopathic and zealous mentality helped separate this strong film from the likes of The Strangers, which carried no social commentary or message whatsoever.  As extreme as the premise may seem in The Purge, I must admit that it got me thinking.

1627204,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00BEIYGT8,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[124, 168]","By the year 2022 the US government, led by our New Founding Fathers, has managed to crawl its way out of a triple dip recession and record crime rates. Unemployment stands at 1%, and crime is at an all time low. With one exception. Once a year, on a date designated as The Purge, for twelve hours all crime is legal. Rape, murder, theft, the entire US has a free pass to do whatever they wish and suffer no repercussions for it. In a single day thousands are murdered and millions of dollars worth of property destroyed in order to give everyday American's an outlet to vent their rage, anger, and frustrations in the hope that they will ""cleanse their souls"" and not be tempted to commit crimes for the rest of the year.First of all let's put aside the fact that the premise at face value makes absolutely no sense. I'll let that slide, though I do feel it needs to be said. The premise is what it is, and as implausible as it is, I still thought it interesting enough to warrant a look. But even overlooking  this, the movie has some serious flaws that I felt wasted what could have been a very intelligent film. First of all, this film is produced by the same people who brought us great horror movies like the Paranormal Activity movies, Insidious and Sinister, and while I loved those movies this film should have been different. The premise screams suspense thriller, as instead of dealing with supernatural beings like in their previous films, the main baddies in this one are a bunch of teenagers in masks and an old homeless man. To put it simply, there is nothing even remotely scary about this movie, so the fact that they filmed it like a horror movie with the typical horror movie tropes, jump scares, loud music, etc  only served as a distraction both for the director and the audience from what should have been the main focus. These sort of things worked for Sinister and Insidious because of their supernatural elements, because the villains were invisible, evil forces that couldn't be talked to or reasoned with. This film doesn't have that. Instead we have some homeless guy wandering around an inexplicably enormous house for an hour while the idiot family that lives there stumbles around in the dark. Am I honestly supposed to be scared by this? The Purge is a thriller in a horror movies clothing, and ultimately in my opinion fails horribly at being either.But what about The Purge itself? Do we get to see the streets turn into battle grounds? Is there subtle yet engaging social commentary to go along with such an interesting premise? Sadly, no. I don't know what these producers deal is with filming well off families in big houses, but this story should have really been told from the POV of someone who is poor and, thus, unable to afford protection from the roaming bands of psychotic rich kids trying to kill them. This is what should have been the focus of the film, not some boring rich family with first world problems, but the poor and downtrodden who are the real victims of this sick tradition. Imagine a film where a poor, single mother/father flees with their children from bands of killers who are not only allowed to kill at will, but encouraged to do so as well. That would have been a great movie. Instead we get boring suburban dad with boring suburban wife, and boring suburban kids. Nothing gets my heart strings strumming like privileged rich people trying to throw some poor homeless guy to the wolves. Yeah, I feel real sorry for those guys.The Purge is a film that had a great idea but no idea how to see it through. Its boring, badly directed, and commits the cardinal sin of being a horror movie that isn't even remotely scary. If you really want to see it, wait until its on netflix and stream it. Otherwise, my suggestion is to pass. Its really not worth the effort.",2,Great idea with no vision.,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,3822,"['year', '2022', 'US', 'government', 'led', 'New', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'managed', 'crawl', 'way', 'triple', 'dip', 'recession', 'record', 'crime', 'rates', 'Unemployment', 'stands', '1', '%', 'crime', 'time', 'low', 'one', 'exception', 'Once', 'year', 'date', 'designated', 'Purge', 'twelve', 'hours', 'crime', 'legal', 'Rape', 'murder', 'theft', 'entire', 'US', 'free', 'pass', 'do', 'wish', 'suffer', 'repercussions', 'single', 'day', 'thousands', 'are', 'murdered', 'millions', 'dollars', 'property', 'destroyed', 'order', 'give', 'everyday', 'American', 'outlet', 'vent', 'rage', 'anger', 'frustrations', 'hope', 'will', 'cleanse', 'souls', 'not', 'be', 'tempted', 'commit', 'crimes', 'rest', 'year.First', 'let', 'put', 'aside', 'fact', 'premise', 'face', 'value', 'absolutely', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'let', 'slide', 'do', 'feel', 'be', 'said', 'premise', 'what', 'as', 'implausible', 'still', 'thought', 'interesting', 'enough', 'warrant', 'look', 'even', 'overlooking', 'movie', 'serious', 'flaws', 'felt', 'wasted', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'intelligent', 'film', 'First', 'all', 'film', 'produced', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'brought', 'great', 'horror', 'movies', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movies', 'Insidious', 'Sinister', 'loved', 'movies', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'premise', 'screams', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'instead', 'dealing', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'previous', 'films', 'main', 'baddies', 'one', 'are', 'bunch', 'teenagers', 'masks', 'old', 'homeless', 'man', 'put', 'simply', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'scary', 'movie', 'fact', 'filmed', 'horror', 'movie', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'tropes', 'jump', 'scares', 'loud', 'music', 'etc', 'only', 'served', 'distraction', 'director', 'audience', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'main', 'focus', 'sort', 'things', 'worked', 'Sinister', 'Insidious', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'villains', 'were', 'invisible', 'evil', 'forces', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'talked', 'reasoned', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'Instead', 'have', 'homeless', 'guy', 'wandering', 'inexplicably', 'enormous', 'house', 'hour', 'idiot', 'family', 'stumbles', 'dark', 'Am', 'honestly', 'supposed', 'be', 'scared', 'Purge', 'thriller', 'horror', 'movies', 'clothing', 'ultimately', 'opinion', 'horribly', 'being', 'either.But', 'what', 'Purge', 'Do', 'get', 'see', 'streets', 'turn', 'battle', 'grounds', 'there', 'subtle', 'yet', 'engaging', 'social', 'commentary', 'go', 'along', 'such', 'interesting', 'premise', 'Sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'producers', 'deal', 'filming', 'well', 'families', 'big', 'houses', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'told', 'POV', 'someone', 'who', 'poor', 'thus', 'unable', 'afford', 'protection', 'roaming', 'bands', 'psychotic', 'rich', 'kids', 'trying', 'kill', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'focus', 'film', 'not', 'boring', 'rich', 'family', 'first', 'world', 'problems', 'poor', 'downtrodden', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'victims', 'sick', 'tradition', 'Imagine', 'film', 'where', 'poor', 'single', 'mother/father', 'flees', 'children', 'bands', 'killers', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'allowed', 'kill', 'will', 'encouraged', 'do', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'Instead', 'get', 'boring', 'suburban', 'dad', 'boring', 'suburban', 'wife', 'boring', 'suburban', 'kids', 'Nothing', 'heart', 'strumming', 'privileged', 'rich', 'people', 'trying', 'throw', 'poor', 'homeless', 'guy', 'wolves', 'Yeah', 'feel', 'real', 'sorry', 'guys.The', 'Purge', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'idea', 'idea', 'how', 'see', 'boring', 'badly', 'directed', 'cardinal', 'sin', 'being', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'scary', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'netflix', 'stream', 'Otherwise', 'suggestion', 'pass', 'really', 'not', 'effort']",The Purge
1627205,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B00BEIYGT8,Josh,"[4, 7]","Let me start out by being perfectly clear. When I saw the first trailer for The Purge, I thought to myself, that is going to be a great horror movie. Just last year, 2012 to be exact, a movie called The Cabin In The Woods was released. I gotta say, Joss Whedon made two great movies last year: The Avengers, and The Cabin In The Woods. So naturally I read up the premise on The Purge, and almost immediately, Cabin In the Woods was the first movie that I could think of to sort of compare The Purge to. I just got finished watching The Purge. Is it great like I hoped? Sadly no it is not and on any other given Sunday, I would call this movie god awful. But there is something admirable and admittedly a little thought provoking about this movie that made me enjoy it.The Purge stars Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey as James and Mary Sandin. Another thing that sparked my interest with this movie was the two lead actors Ethan Hawke who already starred in another horror film Sinister, and Lena Headey from the brilliant show Game of Thrones and the movie 300. I would say the acting in this movie is not the best, but then again not very many horror movies are known for giving Oscar worthy performances. In the Purge, it is the year 2022 where on one specific night for 12 hours crime is legal. That's right CRIME. 12 hours may not seem like a very long time, but trust me IT IS. I would note that one of the pros this movie has is that the story, while it is predictable at times, does keep you guessing and keeps your attention for the entire movie.Now my problem with The Purge is this: for what the premise suggests and the rating it has, you would initially consider this to be an all out horror film. As a matter of fact, I would consider it more of psychiatric thriller or something of that nature. In my honest opinion, The Purge is not very scary at all. Be mindful, there is a lot of violence and chaos going on, but this is not a film that would scare you sleepless in my opinion. Another problem is that there are some things that don't make a whole lot of sense in the movie, but strangely enough, I was able to overlook it.After watching The Purge, I said to myself "" I am supposed to dislike this movie'' ""why in the world do i like this movie so much?'' To be perfectly honest, some might think I am in need of a brain exam for liking this movie. But I do admire the way The Purge tries to be creative and clever (although its not very clever). And I especially admired the overall tone of the movie.

What I found interesting is that the concept was lifted, almost entirely, from an old Star Trek episode.  Anybody remember it? The moment I began watching this movie, that Star Trek episode sprang to mind.  In the episode, Kirk, Spock and the landing party land on a planet where everyone is peaceful, content and law abiding.  It turns out that the entire populace is being controlled by a master computer that they virtually worship as a god, and call &#34;Landru&#34;.  The computer controls their actions and thoughts, giving them peace and prosperity, except for one day a year---their &#34;festival&#34;.  During this day, all controls are turned off, and the entire population goes wild, rioting, burning, raping, murdering.  As one of the characters in episode said---one day a year of complete cancer. By this method Landru purges the negative emotions of the humans he controls, and incidentally reduces the population.

1627243,A3FMVDJU5TOHOH,B00BEIYGT8,Mike G,"[3, 8]","This movie was one of the dumbest, idiotic, part racial, stereo typical, crap I have ever seen. *SPOILER ALERT*  So let me give you a quick run down, you have 1 day out of the year where all crime is legal and this is helps eliminate crime to 1 %. Ok that sounds like a bunch a bull but I'm a watch it and see where it goes its creative and seems like it can be awesome. As I continue watching the movie it gets to the point to explaining more of the situation and rules of the Purge. Basically if you don't have money then you're dead. If you're poor and homeless on the street you're a main target and I find it funny how they had scenes of African Americans acting like gorillas and most of the violence on the screen focusing on minorities acting crazy on the news. Really it's like that ok so at this point I'm feeling a little bla. As I continually watch this I'm thinking this is really bad acting, but in some movies they actually want it to be like that so I even forgave the partridge rich family generic happy go luck acting.The dad Ethan Hawke creates one of the best security systems every made and is one of the richest guys in the town with a beautiful house and family which is good for a beginning plot you have the conflict which is the system and you have the story building up.Then it starts to get stupid you have a boyfriend that the dad disagrees with and makes him go and locks up the house for the purge. Then every one has to just be calm and chill for one night, and you telling me they couldn't do that. So you have the security systems on and every thing and for some reason a guy is on one of the security cameras running screaming for help. I don't know how, but they family leaves the security system alone with a boy.We know kids do things to opposite to there parents, but if I knew my family was in question of that night there is no way in hell my kid would be messing with my security stuff. Then the kid knows all the codes WTF. What sense does that make that's like putting a code on the TV to block porno, but giving the kid the code it defeats the purpose seriously.So I'm thinking I'm a bite my lip this is going to get better and I started to find my self losing brain cells watching every min of this stupidity. Ok so the kid lets this stranger in which the kid needs a whipping of a life time because he is a spoiled brat. Honestly you don't know what this guy could have did and what he is capable of doing. Okay so you have some coo coo rich spoiled guys come and act a foo. The first thing I notice all rich all white okay so I'm already getting to the point to where I'm like wow seriously. Then let's make matters worst why did they chase this guy down? The Purge is to focus on killing the people we hate and don't like, and that don't have money. Awesome so now I feel like I'm watching an episode of roots where the KKK is chasing a black man and now I'm pissed at the stupidity of the family and the small messages I'm picking up in the movie. At this point I just try to lower my thought and not think too much of it and calm down but every time I calmed down the question stupidity start hyping me back up.How are you going to have a multi million security system and have it get torn down by a truck wow seriously? The boyfriend even stayed in the house and that is sad how the heck did he get passed the dad like that.  I'm just saying if you use to having a secured house hold every year you don't check the whole house before you lock up like regular people tend to do before they go to bed or some one leaves.Let's get even more stupid the group of individuals demand the family to turn in the stranger that they let in. If they do that they will not harm any one in the family, now of course it's not guaranteed which would have been my first thought, but they catch the guy. Then this boyfriend of the girl comes out yelling talking about I love your daughter bla bla your in the way then tries to shoot the father like really. Who does that? Do you honestly think she will want you after that you psycho. I already was thinking the girl was stupid to begin with but then when I seen how dumb the boyfriend was I thought they where great for each other.Well any way dad kills the kid feels a little bad about girl goes run her head in the wall are what ever she is hurt because her boyfriend is dead. Then they start searching for the stranger find him and the movie lags. They decide to help him then decide to throw him into the pit then decide to help him its like make up your dang mind. How are you going to have over 20 min of the movie on a family trying to figure out what to do with a stranger? Any way they don't turn in the guy, the guys that was chasing him pull the door down with a truck and they come in shooting and acting retarded. It was like watching a bunch of clowns from a rodeo shoot each other and do stupid stuff. The villain was a decent villain I mean he made you want to punch the taste out of his mouth at least.Then through all of this circus and comedy act of a movie they kill the star of the movie what kind of crap was that.  I guess they was trying to be different I would understand if he was the last to die but they kill the star then the family relies on the stranger they saved.  So okay good moral to the story all good deeds don't go to waste, but in this case you already messed up the moral by showing stupidity over resolve. Honestly the whole thing wouldn't have happened if the guy wasn't let in now you got a family with out a father.Any way the next door neighbor get involved and help take out the guys that break in, the family think they are safe until the neighbor show envy and jealousy about the family. Just because the family makes the most money out of every one in the town and at this point I'm like wow the neighbor acting is horrible. Some how the family get out of a tight situation and one neighbor is killed the rest the wife makes sit in the room and scolded them to wait until 7am when the purge is over. Now I'm thinking to my self you need to be scolding that boy that let strangers in the house. Then lets them go, what make the family thing they want try to come back? I guess they are going to move or some thing all and all this was some thing I can live with out.Every thing was predictable I think the only time I was surprised is when the father got stabbed. I really didn't like the concept the rich taking out all the poor to make a better world it sounded more like some illuminati type of junk. The acting was pretty bad I mean there is better actors on barney, There was too many questionable things, It's fine for a movie to have some questionable thing but man I should have to question every thing every 10 mins, the things they did was unnatural which I wasn't too surprised at that because most horror movies aren't things we would normally do in the real world, The principals of the movie and plot was bad, It was badly written the language and dialog was horrible that may be why the acting seem so bad, and all and all I can keep going but it was horrible. I bashed and wasted enough time with this movie because if you want to be traumatized with thinking what the heck I was thinking? This is a movie that will haunt your mind. It's a horror movie all on its own from being as bad as it is.",1,Too much lacking and a lot of bad acting,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,7345,"['movie', 'was', 'one', 'dumbest', 'idiotic', 'part',

1627249,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BEIYGT8,M. Oleson,"[1, 3]","For a while, as I was settling in for this movie, I was admittedly intrigued by the idea of a one-night of violence premise of this story.  I quickly realized however that the victims are likely to be the less fortunate, while the 1 percenters are safely holed up in their protected mansions.  Director and writer James DeMonaco would seem to have his primary characters laughing at those who can't afford the latest technology and who go about their business right up to the last second unconcerned they might be victims.Ethan Hawke stars as James Sandin, a security salesman, who has done pretty well for himself and his beautiful wife Mary (Lena Headey) and teenaged children Zoey (Adelaid Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder).  They support the Purge as it has proven to bring down crime and only lasts for 12 hours once a year.  Rather than bring more depth to this idea, DeMonaco dives right into a traditional ""home invasion"" movie.  One we've seen often, usually a handful of times each year it would seem.This one makes little sense either, as Charlie allows a homeless man (Edwin Hodge) into the house as he is being tracked down by a mob of, what appears to be, college students on a scavenger hunt.  The film becomes dumber by the minute as each scene becomes more and more predictable.  And in an effort to throw a twist at the end, throws and even more ridiculous final scene instead.  This film is just plain dumb.As bad as the film is, the Blu ray transfer is very good.  Granted the film is very dark most of the time.  It takes place inside a house at night.  Then the power is cut off so what we get is emergency low light conditions and it works pretty well.  Skin tones look authentic and colors are pretty much limited to black and blue.

(And a nice house it is)*Teenage daughter who is dating a boy her parents can not stand.*Technology geek son.But this one night is not ordinary. It is the one night of the year that all crimes are legal and all emergency services are off limits. Our family settles down for their lock down with their expensive security system. But at the last minute, a stranger gets in the house. The doors and windows are then secured. And then a group of ""PURGERS"" show up on their lawn. And the family is faced with a dilemma: Do they sacrifice the stranger to the Purgers to save themselves or do they try to save a complete stranger from an unknown fate?Although, the movie does have psychological issues like this, it does contain quite a bit of violence like close-ups of people getting stabbed and shot in the face.",5,Purge would make a GREAT Halloween movie.,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,1281,"['personally', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'better', 'reviews', 'ratings', 'released', 'close', 'Halloween', 'day', 'Then', 'least', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'expecting', 'something', 'this.Our', 'movie', 'set', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'future', 'where', 'unemployment', 'crime', 'poverty', 'are', 'time', 'protagonists', 'are', 'ordinary', 'family', '*Hardworking', 'dad', 'bringing', 'home', 'bacon', 'got', 'wealthy', 'home', 'security', 'system', 'salesman', '*Stay', 'home', 'mom', 'who', 'pride', 'housekeeping', 'nice', 'house', '*Teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'dating', 'boy', 'parents', 'can', 'not', 'stand', '*Technology', 'geek', 'son.But', 'one', 'night', 'not', 'ordinary', 'one', 'night', 'year', 'crimes', 'are', 'legal', 'emergency', 'services', 'are', 'limits', 'family', 'down', 'lock', 'expensive', 'security', 'system', 'last', 'minute', 'stranger', 'house', 'doors', 'windows', 'are', 'then', 'secured', 'then', 'group', 'PURGERS', 'show', 'up', 'lawn', 'family', 'faced', 'dilemma', 'Do', 'sacrifice', 'stranger', 'Purgers', 'save', 'do', 'try', 'save', 'complete', 'stranger', 'unknown', 'fate', 'movie', 'have', 'psychological', 'issues', 'contain', 'quite', 'bit', 'violence', 'close-ups', 'people', 'getting', 'stabbed', 'shot', 'face']",The Purge

On the surface it's a decent thriller about a family being attacked by a group of murderers during a night where for 12 hours all crime is legal. Now, this brings up an endless amount of questions and it gets really aggravating when none of those questions are answered. At no point in time does this movie give any real explanation and it never gets very deep even though this is a pretty original and almost revolutionary idea the plot is malnourished from poor writing.The acting is atrocious and none of the characters are likeable and at the end of it the whole thing is pretty forgettable except for the idea itself and your own plans and questions that will linger around. Is it so bad that it's an unwatchable movie? Not by any means, it's still very entertaining but it's not scary, intelligent or anything to hype about.

If you don't like it, come up with a better script and 3 mil, and film it yourself, I say. Fact is, this filmmaker thought it up himself, so he gets to run with it his way.  His way is certainly filled with twists, sometimes seemingly just for twist sake, and I personally would have gone a dozen different directions with it, but that's the thing- I didn't think of any of it until this movie proposed the idea to start with.  It is thought provoking, unpredictable (anyone can die or kill, there are no rules) , a little thin and short (probably thin budget related). I did not expect literal class warfare to be as central a theme as it is.

1627261,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B00BEIYGT8,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[4, 7]","What if, for one night each year, you could commit any crime without fear of reprisal? What would you do? Commit robbery? Extortion? Rape? How about murder?This is America circa 2022---wracked with overpopulation, high unemployment and brutal crime. In an effort to save the country, the U.S. government sanctions ""The Purge,"" an annual 12-hour period where any and all criminal acts become legal, unpunishable by the law. And you know what? It works. As a direct result of this purge, crime rates are down and unemployment falls below 1%. But not everyone chooses to participate in this violent free-for-all. When an unexpected encounter with a stranger threatens the safety of the Sandin family, James (Ethan Hawke) and Mary (Lena Headey) must decide if violence really is the way or be forced to face the deadly consequences.If I had to formulate a list of the most disturbing films ever, The Purge would be near the top. In fact, The Purge is somewhat reminiscant of Stephen King's The Mist in that it explores the darker side of the human condition and poses some seriously disturbing questions. And like The Mist, the answers we find are profoundly unsettling. Surprisingly, it's not the violence that makes this movie an uneasy one to watch. Was it there? Sure. But it's no more violent than other movies I've seen recently. Instead, it's the opportunity for violence and the unpredictability of man that keeps it so uncertain and edgy. You're left looking to your neighbor and wondering, given the same situation, what would they do?Watching The Purge was an experience in and of itself. It's gripping, intense and the second-by-second tension kept me on the edge of my seat (quite literally!). My anxiety levels were through the roof and I'm talking that nails-digging-into-my-palms kind of intense. The action steadily builds into a frighteningly violent crescendo. The movie's pacing is quick and the height of the action is much shorter than one would initially expect, however, it'es nough to get the point across effectively. Any longer and they would've gone overboard. And let me just say, I'm super glad they didn't take that route because, honestly, I'm not sure I could've handled much more. Creepy as it was overall, the film gets somewhat campy towards the finale which left many a viewer displeased. But I thought it was a rather brilliant way to end such an intense movie and was relieved to find those cheesy, albeit brief, moments..As for the characters, some are hollow but I didn't mind because the people who really mattered were top-notch. Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke shone in their respective roles as Mrs. and Mr. Sandin, but Rhys Wakefield as the villainous leader (credited as ""polite stranger"") was the one who really stole the show. Like in most movies, you expect the villain to be psychotic---savage in appearance, crazy in demeanor, poor in intellect and speech. Wakefield was anything but. He's well-groomed, rich and seemingly well-educated making his detached savagery all the more brutal and unexpected. Some of the characters, the children namely, are familiar cliches and a bit of the dialogue borders on silly, but I found them easily overlooked when compared to the bigger picture.Though I thought The Purge was commendable, due to its profoundly disturbing nature, I don't feel right giving it any sort of starred rating. And though it's not particularly scary, it's a gripping and effective thriller. It'll leave you thinking and wondering and fearfully hoping that this isn't what the world is coming to. This movie explores several philosophical musings such as are we a violent species by nature and are humans inherently evil? The answers aren't easy ones to come by and the social commentary is somewhat depressing. It's also one of those rare movies that isn't for the faint of heart. And while I'm really glad I watched it, I'll probably never own or view it again. I'm a huge fan of horror and it takes a lot to leave me reeling, and this movie, it definitely achieved that.",4,A Commendably Profound & Disturbing Film,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,4030,"['What', 'one', 'night', 'year', 'could', 'commit', 'crime', 'fear', 'reprisal', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'Commit', 'robbery', 'Extortion', 'Rape', 'How', 'murder', 'America', 'circa', '2022', '-wracked', 'overpopulation', 'high', 'unemployment', 'brutal', 'crime', 'effort', 'save', 'country', 'U.S.', 'government', 'sanctions', 'Purge', 'annual', '12-hour', 'period', 'where', 'criminal', 'acts', 'become', 'legal', 'unpunishable', 'law', 'know', 'what', 'direct', 'result', 'purge', 'crime', 'rates', 'are', 'down', 'unemployment', 'falls', '1', '%', 'not', 'everyone', 'participate', 'violent', 'free-for-all', 'When', 'unexpected', 'encounter', 'stranger', 'safety', 'Sandin', 'family', 'James', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Mary', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'must', 'decide', 'violence', 'really', 'way', 'be', 'forced', 'face', 'deadly', 'consequences.If', 'had', 'formulate', 'list', 'most', 'disturbing', 'films', 'ever', 'Purge', 'would', 'be', 'top', 'fact', 'Purge', 'somewhat', 'reminiscant', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Mist', 'darker', 'side', 'human', 'condition', 'seriously', 'disturbing', 'questions', 'Mist', 'answers', 'find', 'are', 'profoundly', 'unsettling', 'Surprisingly', 'not', 'violence', 'movie', 'uneasy', 'one', 'watch', 'Was', 'there', 'Sure', 'more', 'violent', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'Instead', 'opportunity', 'violence', 'unpredictability', 'man', 'so', 'uncertain', 'edgy', ""'re"", 'left', 'looking', 'neighbor', 'wondering', 'given', 'same', 'situation', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Watching', 'Purge', 'was', 'experience', 'gripping', 'intense', 'second-by-second', 'tension', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'quite', 'literally', 'anxiety', 'levels', 'were', 'roof', ""'m"", 'talking', 'nails-digging-into-my-palms', 'kind', 'intense', 'action', 'steadily', 'frighteningly', 'violent', 'crescendo', 'movie', 'pacing', 'quick', 'height', 'action', 'much', 'shorter', 'one', 'would', 'initially', 'expect', 'however', ""it'es"", 'nough', 'get', 'point', 'effectively', 'Any', 'longer', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'overboard', 'let', 'just', 'say', ""'m"", 'super', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'route', 'honestly', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', ""'ve"", 'handled', 'much', 'more', 'Creepy', 'was', 'overall', 'film', 'somewhat', 'campy', 'finale', 'left', 'many', 'viewer', 'displeased', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'way', 'end', 'intense', 'movie', 'was', 'relieved', 'find', 'cheesy', 'brief', 'moments..As', 'characters', 'are', 'hollow', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'mattered', 'were', 'top-notch', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'shone', 'respective', 'roles', 'Mrs.', 'Mr.', 'Sandin', 'Rhys', 'Wakefield', 'villainous', 'leader', 'credited', 'polite', 'stranger', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'stole', 'show', 'most', 'movies', 'expect', 'villain', 'be', 'psychotic', '-savage', 'appearance', 'crazy', 'demeanor', 'poor', 'intellect', 'speech', 'Wakefield', 'was', 'anything', 'well-groomed', 'rich', 'seemingly', 'well-educated', 'making', 'detached', 'savagery', 'more', 'brutal', 'unexpected', 'characters', 'children', 'namely', 'are', 'familiar', 'cliches', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'borders', 'silly', 'found', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'when', 'compared', 'bigger', 'thought', 'Purge', 'was', 'commendable', 'due', 'profoundly', 'disturbing', 'nature', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'giving', 'sort', 'starred', 'rating', 'not', 'particularly', 'scary', 'gripping', 'effective', 'thriller', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'thinking', 'wondering', 'fearfully', 'hoping', ""n't"", 'what', 'world', 'coming', 'movie', 'several', 'philosophical', 'musings', 'such', 'are', 'violent', 'species', 'nature', 'are', 'humans', 'inherently', 'evil', 'answers', 'are', ""n't"", 'easy', 'ones', 'come', 'social', 'commentary', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'also', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', ""n't"", 'faint', 'heart', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'watched', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'own', 'view', 'again', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'horror', 'lot', 'leave', 'reeling', 'movie', 'definitely', 'achieved']",The Purge

The sooner you realize this, the better.2. This is a dark, violent, well-acted, and uncomfortable allegory about the American class system.3. The movie takes place over a span of 13 hours. Ethan Hawke plays a well-meaning, but rather rigid, father that lives in a very wealthy gated community with his family. They settle into their home for the evening behind their state-of-the-art security system to keep out of The Purge. The Purge is a night where all crime is legal. This is designed to let Americans vent their frustration, anger, and violent impulses, so that the rest of the year everyone can get along better. Anyway, the two kids end up compromising the security of their house, and the family must defend their lives from psycho college students who want things the family has.3 There are some parts of the movie that, at first, seem dumb or unrealistic. But if you look at those instances as metaphor, the whole movie unlocks and begins to make sense.4. This movie is less concerned with telling an actual story, and more concerned with examining issues of entitlement, envy, the dangers of using God as a foundation of patriotism, and the deep dehumanization of others (as well as the self) that is required to keep those things going.5. The home-invasion thriller part of the movie is well-acted and has some surprises.6. There is a lot of violence in this movie, but not like some people expect. It is not about showing rampant carnage so that the audience can experience their own Purge vicariously. The epic idea of the movie is scaled way down to become an intimate experience. This disappointed a lot of people.7. This movie is not about the Purge, but about the reactions and consequences to living with such a system as The Purge.8. It's about the self-deception that the wealthy engage in when they say &#34;Things like that don't happen in our neighborhood&#34;. It's about the intrinsic instability that roils under the calm surface of the upper class, and how they really are like piranhas, tearing apart anything they see as prey - even if it is each other.9. &#34;The Purge&#34; is a suspenseful and thoughtful morality tale that makes a depressing case about human nature.

The plot (and I hate using that word) is simple. For 12 hours all crime is legal, all of them, nothing is off limits. Due to some things that happened, a gang targets a family. That's all I want to say about it.  I want to say again, what a stupid movie this is.First off, the characters, all of them are annoying. Think of the most stupid thing a character could do in a movie, and they do it.  Let a stranger in a house? Yup. Hide in stupid places? You got it.  Search their house alone looking for someone? Why we have that too.  This was so stupid, I'm surprised that someone didn't take a bath or go investigate a strange noise, or say ""I'll be right back.""  Idiots.****SPOILERS*****The kid was most annoying. To start us off, this lil  twit lets a stranger in the house!  This is the event that starts everything off.  He's such a dingbat. His dad told him to go in in the basement and hide That's all this lil nimrod had to do. If he did that everything would be fine. What does this numb nuts do? He goes in the dark basement to hide....in the dark....and turns on a bright *bleeping* flashlight! I'm sorry, but I was rooting for the killers at this point.  Then the father isn't much better. This genius knows a stranger is in the house, and the daughter's missing in the house, and he goes into a 5 minute speech on how he's going to go look for the stranger. Never mind the speech, just go look for your daughter!  Then the father is a security expert...but doesn't have a Safety Room in the house.  No wonder the kid's a dingbat with a father like that. All of the characters were idiots.  What's with the shaky camera effect and the low camera angles? If you have a good story, you don't need that garbage. That's the sign of a hack movie maker.  Don't even get me started on the stupid walking edits. Then when the bad guys were trashing the house, the director decided to instill  no sound at all.

""Since hollywood wants to do nothin...","[1, 1]","The basic premise of this film is that one day every year America is immersed in what is known as &#34;The Purge,&#34; in the fashion of a holiday. For 12 hours on this day (7PM stretching into the next morning at 7AM), you may commit any crime on the books... but also have said crimes perpetrated on you. For this stretch, there are no police or ambulatory services. A reference to the &#34;New Founding Fathers&#34; is alluded to when this commences in the film. Clearly, there has been some &#34;change&#34; in government.Ethan Hawke is a super-successful home security salesman who has sold an effective system to all of his neighbors. Their envy for Hawke's wealth is displayed in a ridiculously-obvious manner by writer/director James DeMonaco. I'm not sure if DeMonaco intended this, but when the main characters are poorly written and generally unlikable, how is the viewer supposed to feel any suspense when said characters are at a knife point? Lena Heady plays Hawke's wife and her blithe &#34;The purge does a lot of good&#34; attitude is a terrific example of this. The son is a ghoul who ends up irreversibly dooming the once-secure home for the plot climax and the daughter is a stereotype of angsty teens who &#34;like, TOTALLY like, hate, like everything.&#34; The unimaginative, formulaic build-up was bad enough -- then The Purge happens.No spoilers here, but trust me, you'll want to see this for absolutely free. Anyway, I found the snooty undertones of this &#34;film&#34; to be about as nauseating as Tinseltown's typically-hollow, preachy crap. The film begins with a picture of America 20 years in the future: crime and unemployment are both at an all-time low. However, the 12-hour &#34;purge&#34; is soooooo necessary because people generally have no impulse control and they damn-well need this 12 hour period to settle scores and whack any and all enemies. Anyone else see that this was written by some closet sociopath who actually thinks that anyone with an income under $5 mill will kill at will IF given dispensation to do so?DeMonaco even goes as far as to feature some &#34;professional&#34; on the tele spouting-off about how violent society is with wars. Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the political scum the ones to perpetrate wars and then urge working class people to send their kids to fight said war? &#34;The Purge&#34; would have been far more true to human nature if it were applied to the elite corporate psychopaths (especially in hollywood) who would carve their rivals for even a slight bonus in money and/or fame.",1,Hollyweird Is In Desperation Mode -- Set the Controls for Condescension,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,2569,"['basic', 'premise', 'film', 'one', 'day', 'year', 'America', 'immersed', 'what', 'known', '34', 'Purge', '34', 'fashion', 'holiday', '12', 'hours', 'day', '7PM', 'stretching', 'next', 'morning', '7AM', 'may', 'commit', 'crime', 'books', 'also', 'have', 'said', 'crimes', 'perpetrated', 'stretch', 'are', 'police', 'ambulatory', 'services', 'reference', '34', 'New', 'Founding', 'Fathers', '34', 'alluded', 'when', 'film', 'Clearly', 'been', '34', 'change', '34', 'government.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'super-successful', 'home', 'security', 'salesman', 'who', 'sold', 'effective', 'system', 'neighbors', 'envy', 'Hawke', 'wealth', 'displayed', 'ridiculously-obvious', 'manner', 'writer/director', 'James', 'DeMonaco', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'DeMonaco', 'intended', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'poorly', 'written', 'generally', 'unlikable', 'how', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'feel', 'suspense', 'when', 'said', 'characters', 'are', 'knife', 'point', 'Lena', 'Heady', 'Hawke', 'wife', 'blithe', '34', 'purge', 'lot', 'good', '34', 'attitude', 'terrific', 'example', 'son', 'ghoul', 'who', 'up', 'irreversibly', 'dooming', 'once-secure', 'home', 'plot', 'climax', 'daughter', 'stereotype', 'angsty', 'teens', 'who', '34', 'TOTALLY', 'hate', 'everything.', '34', 'unimaginative', 'formulaic', 'build-up', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'then', 'Purge', 'happens.No', 'spoilers', 'here', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'absolutely', 'free', 'Anyway', 'found', 'snooty', 'undertones', '34', 'film', '34', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'nauseating', 'Tinseltown', 'typically-hollow', 'preachy', 'crap', 'film', 'picture', 'America', '20', 'years', 'future', 'crime', 'unemployment', 'are', 'all-time', 'low', 'However', '12-hour', '34', 'purge', '34', 'soooooo', 'necessary', 'people', 'generally', 'have', 'impulse', 'control', 'damn-well', 'need', '12', 'hour', 'period', 'settle', 'scores', 'whack', 'enemies', 'Anyone', 'else', 'see', 'was', 'written', 'closet', 'sociopath', 'who', 'actually', 'anyone', 'income', '5', 'mill', 'will', 'kill', 'will', 'IF', 'given', 'dispensation', 'do', 'so', 'DeMonaco', 'even', 'as', 'far', 'feature', '34', 'professional', '34', 'tele', 'spouting-off', 'how', 'violent', 'society', 'wars', 'Correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'are', ""n't"", 'political', 'scum', 'ones', 'perpetrate', 'wars', 'then', 'urge', 'working', 'class', 'people', 'send', 'kids', 'fight', 'said', 'war', '34', 'Purge', '34', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'true', 'human', 'nature', 'were', 'applied', 'elite', 'corporate', 'psychopaths', 'especially', 'hollywood', 'who', 'would', 'carve', 'rivals', 'even', 'slight', 'bonus', 'money', 'and/or', 'fame']",The Purge

1627312,A2LHMP07OFU6JW,B00BEIYGT8,Texas Reader,"[1, 3]","The Purge could have been a much better film.  I loved what the concept was.  What if murder was legal for one night in America?  Not a bad way to capture attention or to create debate.  What saddens me is that the plot of the film captures you, but, by the end, the writing of the script is so poor that it does not hold you.  When it is all done, you are left unsatisfied.The problem is they focus on one family, when they could have focused on an entire society.  They simplified the film too much.  Was this because of a small budget?  Who knows?Once it's over you don't feel much sympathy for the family's ordeal that night.  It's a family of four with a geeky dad, stupid wife, brain dead daughter and weird son.  You wind up becoming more annoyed with them than anything else.As you are watching the film, some things just don't make any sense whatsoever.  I will only give one scene away in this film just as an example.  The daughter's boyfriend sneaks into the house.  He makes out with the daughter and then states he wants to go talk to the father about the fact that the father does not want him near his daughter.  It is because he feels he is too old for her.  He walks down the stairs, sees the father, and tries to shoot him.  The father shoots him instead.  He is seriously wounded and the DAUGHTER helps the guy back up the stairs and, as he is bleeding to death, she cries for him as she is holding him in her arms.  Does that make any sense to you?The funny part of the film is how they get in trouble during the purge.  In fact, it is just as ludicrous as the scene I described above.  I am not going to give the scene away, but you will want to choke somebody.  It was so dumb what the youngest member of the family does.Then there is a group of people that are going to attack the house.  This gang is going around town killing people.  For some reason, during this night of murder, none of them are wearing bulletproof vests.  In fact, one member of the gang is wearing a bathrobe.  Also, instead of guns, some members are just carrying axes and knives.  HUH?  People are killing people with guns around the country and you bring knives?  What sense does that make?That, in the end, is the problem.  A lot of things in the film just do not make sense.  There is another reviewer who states that people were laughing in the theater.  I know that person is truthful, because the same thing happened in the theater where I saw this film.  You are not supposed to laugh throughout a movie that bills itself as a horror/suspense film.  That is exactly what happened.I dare you to watch this film and try not to laugh.",2,No bulletproof vests???,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,2637,"['Purge', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'loved', 'what', 'concept', 'was', 'What', 'murder', 'was', 'legal', 'one', 'night', 'America', 'Not', 'bad', 'way', 'capture', 'attention', 'create', 'debate', 'What', 'plot', 'film', 'end', 'writing', 'script', 'so', 'poor', 'not', 'hold', 'When', 'done', 'are', 'left', 'unsatisfied.The', 'problem', 'focus', 'one', 'family', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'entire', 'society', 'simplified', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'Was', 'small', 'budget', 'Who', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'sympathy', 'family', 'ordeal', 'night', 'family', 'four', 'geeky', 'dad', 'stupid', 'wife', 'brain', 'dead', 'daughter', 'weird', 'son', 'wind', 'up', 'becoming', 'more', 'annoyed', 'anything', 'else.As', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'will', 'only', 'give', 'one', 'scene', 'away', 'film', 'just', 'example', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'house', 'out', 'daughter', 'then', 'go', 'talk', 'father', 'fact', 'father', 'not', 'want', 'daughter', 'too', 'old', 'walks', 'down', 'stairs', 'father', 'tries', 'shoot', 'father', 'shoots', 'instead', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'DAUGHTER', 'guy', 'back', 'stairs', 'bleeding', 'death', 'holding', 'arms', 'make', 'sense', 'funny', 'part', 'film', 'how', 'get', 'trouble', 'purge', 'fact', 'just', 'as', 'ludicrous', 'scene', 'described', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'scene', 'away', 'will', 'want', 'choke', 'somebody', 'was', 'so', 'dumb', 'what', 'youngest', 'member', 'family', 'does.Then', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'attack', 'house', 'gang', 'going', 'around', 'town', 'killing', 'people', 'reason', 'night', 'murder', 'none', 'are', 'wearing', 'bulletproof', 'vests', 'fact', 'one', 'member', 'gang', 'wearing', 'bathrobe', 'Also', 'instead', 'guns', 'members', 'are', 'just', 'carrying', 'axes', 'knives', 'HUH', 'People', 'are', 'killing', 'people', 'guns', 'country', 'bring', 'knives', 'What', 'sense', 'make', 'end', 'problem', 'lot', 'things', 'film', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'reviewer', 'who', 'people', 'were', 'laughing', 'theater', 'know', 'person', 'truthful', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'theater', 'where', 'saw', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'movie', 'bills', 'horror/suspense', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened.I', 'dare', 'watch', 'film', 'try', 'not', 'laugh']",The Purge

That's 12 hours of complete freedom to rape, murder, steal, etc. The rest of the days of the year, the society is damn near utopic with extremely low crime and unemployment rates. James Sandin devoted to his family and has made a sizable fortune selling security systems specifically to keep families safe from the Purge. He and his family always hole up for the night and wait for it to be over, but this year is different. His son takes pity on a homeless man and allows him into their house. Some random hooligans were hunting him and now demand him back or they will kill the family instead. James has to decide which is more important, the life of a stranger or the lives of his family.I love the concept for The Purge. There are New Founding Fathers who have enacted this policy in order to allow for a practically crime and unemployment free America. I really wanted to know more about these powerful men, how they came to me known as such, and what state of events led to the legalizing of one night of legalized crime. The aim of it seems to be to let people let off steam and to rid the streets of undesirables (the poor, homeless, and nonwhite) at the same time. The quality of life of the people improves without the government having to actually do anything productive like providing more jobs or funding public programs to help the needy. They just get rid of the class of people that actually needs help. Unfortunately, none of these concepts are really explored in depth and, beyond a few small things, the film is largely a typical home invasion film that offers nothing new to the genre.There are a couple things in the film that comment on society and brought some intrigue to the film. James Sandin is a capitalist through and through, the top seller of security at his work  Unfortunately, the security quality is quite low and doesn't actually withstand a lot of abuse despite its high price tag. The libertarian policies of his company bite him in the ass and leads to his own home being vulnerable to attack. He knew the security was crap and that didn't stop him from selling to hundreds of people and installing it in his own home. Who knows how many other people died as a result of the shoddy workmanship and corporate greed. The homeless man is the only person who is poor and not privileged in the film. He is treated as an animal and a possession by those more affluent. It might have been more interesting to have the story center around more than one person who would actually be affected by the Purge rather than a rich white family that acts supremely stupid at every turn.The rest of the the film is your standard home invasion film. The attackers have creepy masks (a la The Strangers) and terrorize the family. They were actually pretty decent at being deranged. The family run around like chickens with their heads cut off and make the dumbest decisions on the face of the planet throughout the film. It would have been nice for them to make a decision about the homeless guy and stick with it instead of flip flopping every two seconds. I didn't really feel any sympathy for the family because they directly benefited from scamming people and the Purge plus they were boring. They were frankly getting what was coming to them.The ending had some humor to it, but the film was overall a disappointment. The backstory was so interesting yet completely ignored after it generally set up the rules of the world.

This Purge is all about the message that is being portrayed, but it has some major holes in the story. If all crime is legal for 12 hours, how come the only thing on peoples mind is murder? There weren't any rapes or bank robberies, nor where there any acts of terrorism or lashing out at authority. It was all about the killing. Most of the Purge is fairly predictable and it is what you would expect it to be. The big surprise comes at the end, which was extremely powerful, and really gives people the opportunity to question the message the writers have portrayed throughout the film. The only notable performance is that of the stars, Ethan Hawke, who was terrific, in a role I really didn't see him fitting into. The Purge is definitely all about the authors agenda and it is somewhat predictable, but what made the film for me, was the terrific ending, which really does give the audience the chance to challenge the cynical nature of the film.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,1477,"['2022', 'just', '8', 'years', 'now', 'U.S.', 'government', 'instituted', 'new', 'holiday', 'One', 'led', 'peace', 'prosperity', 'extreme', 'cost', 'less', 'fortunate', '12', 'hours', 'once', 'year', 'crime', 'legal', 'people', 'are', 'given', 'opportunity', 'release', 'hatred', 'rage', 'anyone', 'can', 'find', 'cast', ""n't"", 'important', 'film', 'writers', 'cynical', 'message', 'smile', 'jealousy', 'hand', 'shake', 'anger', 'trust', 'become', 'luxury', 'one', 'can', 'afford', 'Purge', 'message', 'being', 'portrayed', 'major', 'holes', 'story', 'crime', 'legal', '12', 'hours', 'how', 'come', 'only', 'thing', 'peoples', 'mind', 'murder', 'were', ""n't"", 'rapes', 'bank', 'robberies', 'where', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'lashing', 'out', 'authority', 'was', 'killing', 'Most', 'Purge', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'big', 'surprise', 'end', 'was', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'really', 'people', 'opportunity', 'question', 'message', 'writers', 'have', 'portrayed', 'film', 'only', 'notable', 'performance', 'stars', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'was', 'terrific', 'role', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'fitting', 'Purge', 'definitely', 'authors', 'agenda', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'terrific', 'ending', 'really', 'give', 'audience', 'chance', 'challenge', 'cynical', 'nature', 'film']",The Purge

While this is a horror movie I do have to say that it's more along the lines of The Strangers then a typical horror. The plot of the movie isn't really that far fetched which makes it a little more terrifying. While I wouldn't call the movie scary I do have to say that it made me feel tense and edgy for almost the entire time. This is a movie that kept me interested and intrigued the entire time. The movie seems to only be filmed in extreme close-ups which adds to the horror aspect of it. It also makes you think how you would act if this actually was going on.

1627337,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00BEIYGT8,Visual Bureau,"[23, 38]","""The Purge, for its time, is by far one of the most daring and intriguing thrillers and social conscience dramas released in recent memory. While some people might find the concept bewildering to grasp (a 12-hour period known as The Annual Purge involving free, legalised criminal activity), it is nonetheless stronger for consideration than the average ""horror"" film especially when recent discussions about the Second Amendment, poverty, race/class issues, and mental health all have been in the spotlight.The film, as the trailers might hint, starts off more as a dark and chilling parable and then switch its gears for more conventional thriller devices with the Straw Dogs-like house invasion toward the middle and end of the film. Nonetheless, much of its messages and intrigue are not lost in the mist as many things can be read and interpreted upon (the affluence of preppy university students showcasing their snobbery through racial violence, fear of the very poor and very rich, taking advantage of innocent women).While much of its glory comes from the themes, The Purge also complements its too realistic for science-fiction, claustrophobic narrative well with intense cinematography, graphic violence, paranoia, and slow-burner pace of frequent domestic threat. Performances are rather good too with Ethan Hawke plays a believably stuck-up security systems consultant and Lena Headey as the fearful yet resilient matriarch of the Sandin family. The soundtrack, with its clever yet unsettling use of Debussy's Claire de Lune, sets to complement a tone to the film that hints paranoia and horror with ""violent peace"" (oxymoronic to say the least).From a person who hardly goes to see these so-called ""horror"" films (ParaNorman, The Shining, Cabin in the Woods, An American Werewolf in London, and Splice are just a few recent ones I have seen), this one can be construed as more close to horror because of the feeling that you are not safe in your own home but the thriller aspect plays into it moreover due to its realistic albeit futuristic setting. On merit, the film delivers a stronger argument about the trouble vigilantism may bring or provide good or bad and is a good enough film for older audiences to critique and question about much of the film's meaning. On that note, it is also best if you stay in for the credits too so to get the experience of knowing how many of The Annual Purge participants feel glad or feel sorrow.""",5,"Whoa!

1627344,A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B00BEIYGT8,W. freeman,"[3, 5]","The concept of having one night to purge, or cleanse yourself of your demons is a clever one. But would it really reduce crime, and make the nation a better, safer place. Or boost the economy? Certainly not. Even with or without consequences people would still kill just as they do in real life. This would actually probably make them want to do it even more often. The movie itself was done by the producers of Sinister (which i thought was brilliant), and Paranormal Activity, (which only 2 were good). So i was expecting just a little more in the way of surprises, twists and turns. Unfortunately this movie has none of that. It's really an idea, more so than a movie. There is no ""real"" story.What you see in the previews is what you see in the film, which happens with many films. But more so with this one. It does have some great scares, tense moments and Ethan Hawke is once again at the top of his game. After seeing him in Sinister i really wanted to see him in another horror/murder type flick. Awesome job. As for the rest of the cast they were good as well, the demented people wearing masks is classic of such films as Insidious, Saw, and many other horror/murder films. And it works really well, just not as well as most would like. So the question it, is it worth watching? Yes very much so. As i said it's a concept rather than a deep movie with an actual plot. And afterwards it does make you think what you would do if there were no consequences for your actions. Even if it was just one night. What would you do? Well this movie gives no answers, so it's really up to you. It is good for what it is. But as I said lacks any real meaningful insight for what it's worth. The only thing I didn't really like, was the ending. That can make or break a film.

1627348,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B00BEIYGT8,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[7, 9]","THE PURGE recalls immediately important works, like the classic short shorty by Shirley Jackson THE LOTTERY, and THE HUNGER GAMES as well.  Unlike those works of literature, THE PURGE is all horror movie clich&eacute;, plot holes, and video game killings.  Like THE LOTTERY and HUNGER GAMES, it takes place in a fictional USA that has devised a new way of dealing with hatred, crime, and murder. MURDER becomes legalized by the state for a period of time, in order to weed out the sick, poor or marginalized. (Referring to war perhaps?) However, the Purge is a good premise, with an execution devoid of humanity or artistic subtlety.  Hunger Games' characters have meaning and context; they evolve and develop during the film. THE PURGE might have worked well, as a 15 minute film (Its hardly even 80 minutes long, as it is). If they could have had the family all cozy, interspliced with various &#34;freak out&#34; murders, while condensing all the running around and hiding, I could have liked the film. Or, if the film showed how unjust the PURGE was to elderly, disabled, or the poor, I would have enjoyed that. (Instead of having these ideas narrated by the &#34;nightly news&#34; on their TV sets.) But the film had all the depth and insight of a cheap &#34;shoot 'em up&#34; video game. Unfortunately, I had to fast forward repeatedly during an 80 minute long film, barely watching more than 15-20 minutes of the movie.  Like a video game, much of the film had characters running around with a gun in their hands,  thru long dark hallways and big rooms, looking to shoot someone.  The invaders who were shot, were neither tragic figures, nor arch villains. They were at best ciphers.The major plot hole, was when the 11 year old kid disarmed the security system, in order to be a nice guy for a stranger.  And after he caused all the trouble, the family never said a single word to condemn his behavior. (EXTREMELY unbelievable!) There was absolutely NO REASON for the kid to know the disarm code, especially when the family kept saying he was too young to understand the purge.  The major events in the film occurred, without any context to psychological reality. Its hard to believe, that an entire society could become psychopathic for just 12 hours, and then return to normal. Human behavior doesn't work that way. (which is why the participants in the HUNGER GAMES were so destroyed by the experience.) You either have a conscience or your don't.  The teens who break in, recalled the film FUNNY GAMES, but without any true horror, since you never view the teens in THE PURGE as anything other than evil.  There's no deception, no appearance verses reality.  Imagine a video game, where you just go kill people thruout the game, and nothing else happens. That's EXACTLY what the film reminds me of.IF you want to explore this premise, that society can condone war or capital punishment, in order to weed out the poor or weak, to feed the darkest drives in humanity, then read THE LOTTERY,  or the HUNGER GAMES.  If you want to watch a video game where everybody gets shot, without using a controller, then check out this film.  However, if you find yourself so bored that you just fast forward between killings to see who survives, don't say I didn't warn you.",1,Tired Rehash of Excellent Premise,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,3272,"['PURGE', 'immediately', 'important', 'works', 'classic', 'short', 'shorty', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'THE', 'LOTTERY', 'THE', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'as', 'well', 'works', 'literature', 'THE', 'PURGE', 'horror', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'holes', 'video', 'game', 'killings', 'LOTTERY', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'place', 'fictional', 'USA', 'devised', 'new', 'way', 'dealing', 'hatred', 'crime', 'murder', 'MURDER', 'legalized', 'state', 'period', 'time', 'order', 'weed', 'out', 'sick', 'poor', 'marginalized', 'Referring', 'war', 'perhaps', 'However', 'Purge', 'good', 'premise', 'execution', 'devoid', 'humanity', 'artistic', 'subtlety', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'characters', 'have', 'meaning', 'context', 'evolve', 'develop', 'film', 'PURGE', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'well', '15', 'minute', 'film', 'hardly', 'even', '80', 'minutes', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'family', 'cozy', 'interspliced', 'various', '34', 'freak', 'out', '34', 'murders', 'condensing', 'running', 'around', 'hiding', 'could', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'film', 'showed', 'how', 'unjust', 'PURGE', 'was', 'elderly', 'disabled', 'poor', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Instead', 'having', 'ideas', 'narrated', '34', 'nightly', 'news', '34', 'TV', 'sets', 'film', 'had', 'depth', 'insight', 'cheap', '34', 'shoot', 'up', '34', 'video', 'game', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'repeatedly', '80', 'minute', 'long', 'film', 'barely', 'watching', 'more', '15-20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'video', 'game', 'much', 'film', 'had', 'characters', 'running', 'around', 'gun', 'hands', 'thru', 'long', 'dark', 'hallways', 'big', 'rooms', 'looking', 'shoot', 'someone', 'invaders', 'who', 'were', 'shot', 'were', 'tragic', 'figures', 'arch', 'villains', 'were', 'best', 'ciphers.The', 'major', 'plot', 'hole', 'was', 'when', '11', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'disarmed', 'security', 'system', 'order', 'be', 'nice', 'guy', 'stranger', 'caused', 'trouble', 'family', 'never', 'said', 'single', 'word', 'condemn', 'behavior', 'EXTREMELY', 'unbelievable', 'was', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'REASON', 'kid', 'know', 'disarm', 'code', 'especially', 'when', 'family', 'kept', 'saying', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'purge', 'major', 'events', 'film', 'occurred', 'context', 'psychological', 'reality', 'hard', 'believe', 'entire', 'society', 'could', 'become', 'psychopathic', 'just', '12', 'hours', 'then', 'return', 'normal', 'Human', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'why', 'participants', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'were', 'so', 'destroyed', 'experience', 'either', 'have', 'conscience', 'do', ""n't"", 'teens', 'who', 'break', 'recalled', 'film', 'FUNNY', 'GAMES', 'true', 'horror', 'never', 'view', 'teens', 'THE', 'PURGE', 'anything', 'other', 'evil', 'deception', 'appearance', 'reality', 'Imagine', 'video', 'game', 'where', 'just', 'go', 'kill', 'people', 'game', 'nothing', 'else', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'film', 'want', 'explore', 'premise', 'society', 'can', 'condone', 'war', 'capital', 'punishment', 'order', 'weed', 'out', 'poor', 'weak', 'feed', 'darkest', 'drives', 'humanity', 'then', 'read', 'THE', 'LOTTERY', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'want', 'watch', 'video', 'game', 'where', 'everybody', 'shot', 'using', 'controller', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'However', 'find', 'so', 'bored', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'killings', 'see', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn']",The Purge
1627349,A24JDJQWQDDH14,B00BEIYGT8,Yu Narukami,"[6, 13]","The Purge is an ugly, vile, and miserable film that essentially argues that all humans are evil. It hides behind the guise of social satire, but doesn't have anything insightful to say. Instead, whatever message it has gets bogged down by a ludicrous home invasion story. Writer/director James DeMonaco takes his material and unwisely focuses on the thriller elements instead of the philosophical questions it raises. And even then, the ""thriller"" elements aren't all that ""thrilling"" to begin with. This is a ridiculous plot with idiotic characters that do idiotic things. The levels of stupidity they go through reach frustratingly high peaks. I never walk out of movies, but oh did I have the urge to walk out of this one.The fundamental issue here is with the premise. In the year 2022, the government enacts a radical law legalizing all crime. For one twelve-hour period every year, people are allowed to commit crimes without any ramifications. As the story begins, we see a number of security cameras capturing random acts of violence--beatings, muggings, shootings, etc. Apparently murder is the action most often taken, as we hear nothing about other types of crime. This law was put in place to ""cleanse"" people of their built-up anger and hatred. It claims that when society is loose from social constraints, people let their inner rage out. As a result, the country's crime rate throughout the year dropped to 1%. People are so satisfied shooting their homicidal wads during The Purge that they have no desire to do so the other days of the year.Here's the problem: the insulting thing is how the set-up says all people--deep down--are psychotic. I tend to believe that people on the whole are good, and are capable of doing good things. This film believes we are all horrible, and would kill willingly if not for the chance of being prosecuted. Characters eagerly prepare weapons and ammo to go ""hunting"" during The Purge. Suburban families talk candidly about cleansing themselves of people they hate. Some even dress up in costumes, as if this was some special holiday. Those that do not participate bunker in their homes, equipped with high tech barricades to keep everyone out. Morality is twisted to the point of absurdity. Are we to believe that given the chance, most people would behave as if they were a part of the Manson family? Gimme a break.Regardless of that issue, we still could have seen a dissection of basic human nature. Unfortunately, that opportunity is wasted as we meet the Sandin family. James (Ethan Hawke) is a successful salesman of home security systems. He's so successful, he was able to provide his wife Mary (Lena Headey) and kids Charlie (Max Burkholder) and Zoey (Adelaide Kane) the largest home in their neighborhood. Of course, their home is set with a security system as well. Their plan is to stay inside during The Purge and try to keep their minds away from the horrors happening outside. What they didn't anticipate, however, is how mind-numbingly stupid they all are. All they had to do was sit down and watch TV, and they could have lasted the evening without any problems. But each one of them makes one dumb mistake after another, creating a domino effect. This leads to a stranger breaking into their home and drawing the attention of other bloodthirsty killers.Honestly, how hard is it to stay in one place and be quiet for an evening? To the Sandin family, that's actually quite difficult. It's hard to have sympathy for these characters when their choices beg for them to get killed. When potential intruders (led by Tony Oller) cut the power to their house (what happened to that high-end security system?), James and Mary stumble in the dark, as though they are completely unaware of their surroundings. Their home must be the size of an amusement park, as they lose track of both the stranger that broke in and of their own daughter! Little Charlie desperately needs to be grounded, as he is entirely aloof. He clearly doesn't understand the dangers of The Purge until it's too late, and even then we're not quite sure he learns his lesson.I could go on and on. I could point out that the nighttime cinematography is murky, the dialogue laughably bad, and the numerous twists and turns come about arbitrarily. But what I found most offensive about The Purge is how it pretends to have some larger meaning. It focuses more on the symptoms instead of addressing the causes. Going on a yearly purge doesn't rid people of their emotional hang-ups; it gives them the anticipation of doing it all over again. The real question is: Why do they have the need to do these things? What, people can't take advantage of their feelings in more productive ways? It believes that when people govern themselves, they'll fall into a world of anarchy. Sorry, I'd like to think we're better than that.",1,This film was so bad I purged!,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,4848,"['Purge', 'ugly', 'vile', 'miserable', 'film', 'essentially', 'humans', 'are', 'evil', 'guise', 'social', 'satire', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'insightful', 'say', 'Instead', 'message', 'bogged', 'down', 'ludicrous', 'home', 'invasion', 'story', 'Writer/director', 'James', 'DeMonaco', 'material', 'unwisely', 'focuses', 'thriller', 'elements', 'instead', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'even', 'then', 'thriller', 'elements', 'are', ""n't"", 'thrilling', 'begin', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'idiotic', 'characters', 'do', 'idiotic', 'things', 'levels', 'stupidity', 'go', 'reach', 'frustratingly', 'high', 'peaks', 'never', 'walk', 'movies', 'oh', 'did', 'have', 'urge', 'walk', 'one.The', 'fundamental', 'issue', 'here', 'premise', 'year', '2022', 'government', 'radical', 'law', 'legalizing', 'crime', 'one', 'twelve-hour', 'period', 'year', 'people', 'are', 'allowed', 'commit', 'crimes', 'ramifications', 'story', 'see', 'number', 'security', 'cameras', 'capturing', 'random', 'acts', 'violence', 'beatings', 'muggings', 'shootings', 'etc', 'Apparently', 'murder', 'action', 'most', 'often', 'taken', 'hear', 'nothing', 'other', 'types', 'crime', 'law', 'was', 'put', 'place', 'cleanse', 'people', 'built-up', 'anger', 'hatred', 'when', 'society', 'loose', 'social', 'constraints', 'people', 'let', 'inner', 'rage', 'out', 'result', 'country', 'crime', 'rate', 'year', 'dropped', '1', '%', 'People', 'are', 'so', 'satisfied', 'shooting', 'homicidal', 'wads', 'Purge', 'have', 'desire', 'do', 'so', 'other', 'days', 'year.Here', 'problem', 'insulting', 'thing', 'how', 'set-up', 'people', 'deep', 'down', 'are', 'psychotic', 'tend', 'believe', 'people', 'whole', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'capable', 'doing', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'horrible', 'would', 'kill', 'willingly', 'not', 'chance', 'being', 'prosecuted', 'Characters', 'eagerly', 'prepare', 'weapons', 'ammo', 'go', 'hunting', 'Purge', 'Suburban', 'families', 'talk', 'candidly', 'cleansing', 'people', 'hate', 'even', 'dress', 'up', 'costumes', 'was', 'special', 'holiday', 'do', 'not', 'participate', 'bunker', 'homes', 'equipped', 'high', 'tech', 'barricades', 'keep', 'everyone', 'Morality', 'twisted', 'point', 'absurdity', 'Are', 'believe', 'given', 'chance', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'behave', 'were', 'part', 'Manson', 'family', 'Gim', 'break.Regardless', 'issue', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'dissection', 'basic', 'human', 'nature', 'Unfortunately', 'opportunity', 'wasted', 'meet', 'Sandin', 'family', 'James', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'successful', 'salesman', 'home', 'security', 'systems', 'so', 'successful', 'was', 'able', 'provide', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'kids', 'Charlie', 'Max', 'Burkholder', 'Zoey', 'Adelaide', 'Kane', 'largest', 'home', 'neighborhood', 'course', 'home', 'set', 'security', 'system', 'well', 'plan', 'stay', 'inside', 'Purge', 'try', 'keep', 'minds', 'away', 'horrors', 'happening', 'outside', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'however', 'how', 'mind-numbingly', 'stupid', 'are', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'TV', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', 'evening', 'problems', 'one', 'one', 'dumb', 'mistake', 'creating', 'domino', 'effect', 'stranger', 'breaking', 'home', 'drawing', 'attention', 'other', 'bloodthirsty', 'killers.Honestly', 'how', 'hard', 'stay', 'one', 'place', 'be', 'quiet', 'evening', 'Sandin', 'family', 'actually', 'quite', 'difficult', 'hard', 'have', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'when', 'choices', 'beg', 'get', 'killed', 'When', 'potential', 'intruders', 'led', 'Tony', 'Oller', 'cut', 'power', 'house', 'what', 'happened', 'high-end', 'security', 'system', 'James', 'Mary', 'stumble', 'dark', 'are', 'completely', 'unaware', 'surroundings', 'home', 'must', 'be', 'size', 'amusement', 'park', 'lose', 'track', 'stranger', 'broke', 'own', 'daughter', 'Little', 'Charlie', 'desperately', 'be', 'grounded', 'entirely', 'aloof', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'understand', 'dangers', 'Purge', 'too', 'late', 'even', 'then', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'lesson.I', 'could', 'go', 'could', 'point', 'out', 'nighttime', 'cinematography', 'murky', 'dialogue', 'laughably', 'bad', 'numerous', 'twists', 'come', 'arbitrarily', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'offensive', 'Purge', 'how', 'have', 'larger', 'meaning', 'more', 'symptoms', 'instead', 'addressing', 'causes', 'Going', 'yearly', 'purge', ""n't"", 'rid', 'people', 'emotional', 'hang-ups', 'anticipation', 'doing', 'over', 'again', 'real', 'question', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'need', 'do', 'things', 'What', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'advantage', 'feelings', 'more', 'productive', 'ways', 'when', 'people', 'govern', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'world', 'anarchy', 'Sorry', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', ""'re"", 'better']",The Purge
1627350,AP3B615GM191G,B00BEIYGT8,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","For its first 30 minutes or so, ""The Purge"" is one of the most inventive, fresh movies of the entire year.  At about that point, however, it is as if director James DeMonaco thought ""oh wait...this is supposed to be a horror movie"" and thus the creative juices dwindle down into pretty much stock horror fare.For a basic plot summary, ""The Purge"" sets the stage of America circa. 2022, where on one night each year all crime (even homicide) is legal.  Supposedly, this ""simple"" government action has led to the lowest levels of unemployment and general violence in history the other 364 days.  James Sandin (Ethan Hawke), wife Mary (Lena Headey) and their two children (Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane) plan to ride out the night inside their fortified-shelter home, until a homeless man requesting aid gives their night a completely unexpected twist.The concept behind ""The Purge"" truly is an incredible one, and thus contains the backbone of the entire storyline (or, at least, SHOULD).  Enough dialogue (in various formats) is given about the event that the viewer will actually be intrigued instead of instantly dismissing the concept as a ""gimmick"".  While watching, you'll actually be thinking through some pretty deep societal messages/themes (gasp...at a horror movie!).Sadly, once the ""Purge"" event in the film commences, the movie slowly turns into much more traditional ""jump"" and ""blood"" horror movie fare.  All those great themes established in the opening sequences are thrown away in favor of chases and contrived scares.Thus, there are two ways to look at a movie like this.  On one hand, it accomplishes a great feat by taking some extraordinary themes of humanity and sticking them in a ""scary movie"".  On the other hand, the film still couldn't be genre-diverse enough to resist going back to the ""old standards"" of horror in the end and wasting such great development.",3,Such A Novel Idea Wasted On What Turns Into Stock Horror Fare,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",2013,1886,"['first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'Purge', 'one', 'most', 'inventive', 'fresh', 'movies', 'entire', 'year', 'point', 'however', 'director', 'James', 'DeMonaco', 'thought', 'oh', 'wait', 'supposed', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'thus', 'creative', 'juices', 'dwindle', 'down', 'pretty', 'much', 'stock', 'horror', 'fare.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Purge', 'stage', 'America', 'circa', '2022', 'where', 'one', 'night', 'year', 'crime', 'even', 'homicide', 'legal', 'Supposedly', 'simple', 'government', 'action', 'led', 'lowest', 'levels', 'unemployment', 'general', 'violence', 'history', 'other', '364', 'days', 'James', 'Sandin', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'two', 'children', 'Max', 'Burkholder', 'Adelaide', 'Kane', 'plan', 'ride', 'out', 'night', 'fortified-shelter', 'home', 'homeless', 'man', 'requesting', 'aid', 'night', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'twist.The', 'concept', 'Purge', 'truly', 'incredible', 'one', 'thus', 'backbone', 'entire', 'storyline', 'least', 'SHOULD', 'Enough', 'dialogue', 'various', 'formats', 'given', 'event', 'viewer', 'will', 'actually', 'be', 'intrigued', 'instead', 'instantly', 'dismissing', 'concept', 'gimmick', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'be', 'thinking', 'pretty', 'deep', 'societal', 'messages/themes', 'gasp', 'horror', 'movie', '.Sadly', 'once', 'Purge', 'event', 'film', 'commences', 'movie', 'slowly', 'much', 'more', 'traditional', 'jump', 'blood', 'horror', 'movie', 'fare', 'great', 'themes', 'established', 'opening', 'sequences', 'are', 'thrown', 'away', 'favor', 'chases', 'contrived', 'scares.Thus', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'look', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'great', 'feat', 'taking', 'extraordinary', 'themes', 'humanity', 'sticking', 'scary', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'genre-diverse', 'enough', 'resist', 'going', 'back', 'old', 'standards', 'horror', 'end', 'wasting', 'such', 'great', 'development']",The Purge

I sort of gave up on movies a long time ago, but this looked promising. For once, a movie with an original idea. However it was all ruined in a flash.This movie had so many points in which the characters are dumber than the screenwriter. No person in their right mind would do half the s*** the characters did in this film. Lets not forget to mention the OVERUSED and very abused off camera surprise save of a character by someone shooting the bad guys just in the nic of time with a raid of bullets. It was done over and over to the point it was boring. Almost like a beat and battered housewife that keeps going back to the same shit over and over for NO reason! The payoff in the end was pretty terrible as well. Our lead woman all the sudden becomes a badass AFTER the ""Purge"" is over! WTF? The whole movie she is a whiny baby who cant defend herself or her kids. But then all the sudden she becomes a badass when its NOT needed.Its absolutely mind blowing how insanely bad the characters are written not to mention there are many plot holes too. The concept of the film was brilliant, the movie was NOT. It would have been more fun to watch several different families doing what they do on this night instead of watching one family be harassed over one guy for no reason.Save your money, and save your TIME because you will want it back after watching this.",1,"Ouch, what a complete disaster",1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,1492,"['had', 'balls', 'take', 'chance', 'spend', '10', 'go', 'watch', 'theater', 'seriously', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'done', 'now', 'sort', 'gave', 'up', 'movies', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'looked', 'promising', 'once', 'movie', 'original', 'idea', 'However', 'was', 'ruined', 'flash.This', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'points', 'characters', 'are', 'dumber', 'screenwriter', 'person', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'do', 's***', 'characters', 'did', 'film', 'not', 'forget', 'mention', 'OVERUSED', 'very', 'abused', 'off', 'camera', 'surprise', 'save', 'character', 'someone', 'shooting', 'bad', 'guys', 'just', 'nic', 'time', 'raid', 'bullets', 'was', 'done', 'point', 'was', 'boring', 'Almost', 'beat', 'battered', 'housewife', 'going', 'back', 'same', 'shit', 'NO', 'reason', 'payoff', 'end', 'was', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'as', 'well', 'lead', 'woman', 'sudden', 'badass', 'AFTER', 'Purge', 'WTF', 'whole', 'movie', 'whiny', 'baby', 'who', 'cant', 'defend', 'kids', 'then', 'sudden', 'badass', 'when', 'NOT', 'needed.Its', 'absolutely', 'blowing', 'how', 'insanely', 'bad', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'not', 'mention', 'are', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'too', 'concept', 'film', 'was', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'was', 'NOT', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'several', 'different', 'families', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'night', 'instead', 'watching', 'one', 'family', 'be', 'harassed', 'one', 'guy', 'reason.Save', 'money', 'save', 'TIME', 'will', 'want', 'back', 'watching']",The Purge
1627353,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B00BEIYGT8,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[2, 4]","This movie is based on a lot of stupidity that takes you out of the movie and makes suspension of disbelief pretty hard.  Furthermore, the characters and populace at large act pretty stupidly.  But, I must say, I loved the action within the house.  There are quite a few shotgun blasts that will have you flashing devil horns or waving a fist.The biggest issues:1) One day a year everyone can indulge in murderous, monstrous rage.  That nearly stops violence in America.  LOL.  Yeah, so the drug wars stopped, the gang wars stopped, domestic abuse stopped, rapists and serial killers and mass murderers all respect the Purge?  The movie says that while not all crime stopped, it has been reduced incredibly because all of these losers of our species respect and love the Purge.  What a load of crap.  So there's my first problem with the film.  Very hard to believe.2) We have new &#34;Founders.&#34;  Who are they?  Why are they?  When were they accepted?  Why?  No idea.  The movie does not explain how a nation of gun-toting, freedom-loving people accept overlords.  So there's another problem.3) The father sells security systems that are supposed to stand up to a night murderous rage . . . really?  Anything allowed.  No cops, no fire dept., no ambulances, etc. are operating for 12 hours.  People can ram trucks into houses, build IED's, set fire to homes, gas a family through their HVAC system, and so on.  So not only is a security system of steel walls stupid.  The father does not arm his family.  He does not train his family in gun-handling.  And he has no control over his teen daughter who almost kills the family.  Oh, and his son who also almost kills the family.Needless to say, the movie is frustrating.  It does not think through the concept it proposes.  A night of absolute terror and violence looms EVERY YEAR, sanctioned by the government.  Nobody bands together?  Nobody trains?  Nobody stockpiles weapons?  The family does not even have a dog, for god's sake!  On top of that, murderous neighbors show their faces?  If I survive your attack, I am going to kill you next year, dopey!  In this new world, medieval tactics would come into play again: siege weapons, moats, sapping, etc.  It would be the only way to survive.  Nobody in THE RICHEST OF NEIGHBORHOODS tries anything but a . . . security system?  Cameras and walls that require . . . wait for it . . . electricity that can be CUT.  (And is, by the way)So, NEVER BUY THIS.  It is worth watching only for the action, which is thrilling at times.  Also, the young guy who portrays the leader of a yuppie band of murderers is EXCELLENT.  Very creepy.  Great actor.  Better than all of the experienced cast in this movie.  So, you might want to check his performance out.",3,Stupid Idea.

1627355,A12LKEM543ILBK,B00BEIYGT8,zombie phreak,"[17, 27]","I really wanted to like this movie, I really really did.  Looking at the trailer for this movie, it looks like it's ""The Strangers"" only set on a national level.  The premise is that the US was on verge of collapse so in order to fix this, a new group of government officials decides that on one day for twelve hours that all crime is legal.  I guess that idea is that people won't commit crimes any other time a year or do anything violent, because on that one night they can indulge all they want and get it out of their systems.Going back to the trailer, it looks like we have video coverage from the whole USA that shows people doing violent things all over the country and once in a while we get images from one family's house as they fight off home invaders in creepy masks and outfits.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***Seriously, this movie is not what you think it's going to be.  It's just constant social commentary about class warfare and with a little bit of racism thrown in now and then for good measure.  Not to mention a lot of things happening in this movie just don't make sense and the characters are just idiotic!First of all, the main character played by Ethan Hawke is a security system sales guy.  So he has the top of the line security system in his home so he'll be safe during the Purge.  While driving home his radio is playing and it's people saying the Purge isn't fair because the rich can afford protection and the poor can't.  Then someone calls into the radio station and says they are going to hunt down and kill their boss.  Okay great idea!  Then tomorrow you won't have a job!  If you kill him, your employer is dead, if you fail and he lives then he's going to fire you the next day.  Wouldn't it be easier to just get a new job?  Also it's mentioned that the Purge is used to kill off the lower class of America and the other undesirables of society.  I don't watch movies to hear social commentary and hear people whining about the 1%  I watch movies for escapism and to enjoy myself.Next the family locks down the house, but one of the kids sees someone outside yelling for help, and stupidly the kid lets this total stranger who is covered in blood and holding a knife into his family's home.  Look, I care about my fellow human beings as much as the next guy, but on a night when all crime is legal, and this man is covered in blood, and is holding a knife, and is asking for me to let him into my home?  Sorry, not gonna happen.  My family's safety takes precedence over a total stranger's safety.What's crazier is that the daughter's boyfriend sneaks into the house and tries to kill the father so he and the daughter can be together.  Moron!  Do you REALLY think that this girl is still going to love you after you MURDER her father!?!  On what planet does that make sense?Later the group of psychos that was chasing the bloody stranger shows up and demands that they release the guy outside to them because ""their equipment is arriving,"" and it will allow them to gain entry to their home.  Their ""equipment"" consists of a 4x4 pickup that they hook up to the metal barriers with chains to the doors and just rip them off.  Yeah, that's a great security system.  You spend like $100,000.00 on this thing and it's compromised by a used pick-up truck and some chain from Home Depot.What I also don't get is why do these weirdoes want to kill this guy so bad anyways?  What's so special about him?  Is it because he's African American?  Because he's homeless?  Because he's a veteran?  Did he do something to them?  Just a little clarity would be niceNot to mention that during the Emergency Broadcast System alert that shows that all weapons are legal during the Purge.  Okay fine, I can get behind that.  But what doesn't make sense is that for the rest of the year these weapons are illegal.  So how did they get these weapons then?  It's still illegal to buy and own them for the other 364 days of the year.Plus the idea of the Purge wouldn't work.  The neighbors break in and try to kill the family because they're jealous of the family because they are so rich.  The family fights them off and holds them at gunpoint until the Purge is over at 7am.  Okay good you lived through the night, but they still hate you and they still know that you killed some of them in defense.  Those feelings don't just get swept under the rug.  Seriously, you think you can try to murder someone and the next day they're just gonna wave and smile at you?Okay now that's enough of this idiotic family.  Please explain to me how making all crime legal for one night is going to save America?  Like, ""Hurray!  Tens of thousands of people were just murdered in cold blood!  America is saved!""  How does that make sense?***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This movie was just dumb and it was a waste of time.
