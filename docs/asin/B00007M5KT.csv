732242,A1FH14TQSVDH1X,B00007M5KT,Anthony Sanchez,"[14, 14]","I recently enjoyed seeing the DVD of this documentary reading from the Slave Narratives that is in the Library of Congress.  These are readings from former slaves interviewed as part of a writing project sponsored by the federal government work program in the 1930s.  This is one of those gems that would have been lost if not for the misery of the Great Depression and with the initiate of Roosevelt's employment projects.The readings are by a variety of actors each of whom give dimension to the printed words.  However, much of what is in the texts was so well expressed by the former slaves that even a monotone reading would have been enlightening.  My favorite is of the man who risked his life rowing run away slaves to Ohio.  He began only because his first passenger was so beautiful that he forgot his fear and thought of her the whole way.  From this experience, he regularly took others despite his own enslavement.  Later, his experience allowed him to free himself and his family.The language and atmosphere of the times are fully experienced in this documentary.  I would wish for those with romantic ideas of the ante bellum period to view this film and read from the text instead of encasing themselves in southern sympathy novels and pseudo history books.  However, I would have liked to have seen a copy of the movie minus the actors preparations for their readings.  It's not a serious problem for me, but I am only curious to compare whether the flow of the film would have improved or not.  It was as though the filmmaker didn't trust the audience to know how they should react and used the actors to guide the viewer.  Or perhaps they wanted to show the celebrities so as to better sell the film.",4,A powerful and fulfilling experience.,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,1719,"['recently', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'reading', 'Slave', 'Narratives', 'Library', 'Congress', 'are', 'readings', 'former', 'slaves', 'interviewed', 'part', 'writing', 'project', 'sponsored', 'federal', 'government', 'work', 'program', '1930s', 'one', 'gems', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'not', 'misery', 'Great', 'Depression', 'initiate', 'Roosevelt', 'employment', 'projects.The', 'readings', 'are', 'variety', 'actors', 'whom', 'give', 'dimension', 'printed', 'words', 'However', 'much', 'what', 'texts', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'expressed', 'former', 'slaves', 'even', 'monotone', 'reading', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enlightening', 'favorite', 'man', 'who', 'risked', 'life', 'rowing', 'run', 'away', 'Ohio', 'began', 'only', 'first', 'passenger', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'forgot', 'fear', 'thought', 'whole', 'way', 'experience', 'regularly', 'took', 'others', 'own', 'enslavement', 'Later', 'experience', 'allowed', 'free', 'family.The', 'language', 'atmosphere', 'times', 'are', 'fully', 'experienced', 'documentary', 'would', 'wish', 'romantic', 'ideas', 'ante', 'bellum', 'period', 'view', 'film', 'read', 'text', 'instead', 'encasing', 'southern', 'sympathy', 'novels', 'pseudo', 'history', 'books', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'copy', 'movie', 'actors', 'preparations', 'readings', 'not', 'serious', 'problem', 'am', 'only', 'curious', 'compare', 'flow', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'not', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'audience', 'know', 'how', 'should', 'react', 'used', 'actors', 'guide', 'viewer', 'perhaps', 'wanted', 'show', 'celebrities', 'so', 'better', 'sell', 'film']",N/A

732244,AQ990HW13DP08,B00007M5KT,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[4, 4]","The end of the Civil War in 1865 freed about 4 million slaves in America, a significant number of whom lived into the 1940s. During the Depression, the Federal Writers Project hired people to interview and record first person narratives from these former slaves, the last first-hand resource that could document their experiences. Today the Library of Congress houses 2,000 such interviews, in their original ""dialect"" and broken English, in the simply-titled Slave Narratives. This film uses original still photographs, contemporary re-enactments, slave music, a running commentary by Whoopi Goldberg, and, most notably and thus the film's title, dramatic readings of those original slave narratives by contemporary African-American actors and actresses like Oprah Winfrey. In just over an hour you learn about the daily horrors of slave life from those who lived to tell of it--relentless work, horrendous housing and diet, the denial of education, sexual violence, and how the ""masters"" used Christianity to keep their slaves passive. This is a deeply moving film about our nation's very recent past.

732245,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00007M5KT,Joe Sherry,"[31, 31]","A film by Ed Bell and Thomas LennonThis HBO documentary is a powerful film.  In the 1930&#65533;s the United States government commissioned journalists to conduct interviews with those former slaves who were still living.  The result was a collection of more than 16 volumes of interviews, the words of former slaves about their experiences.  The interviews were transcribed with the way these men and women spoke, in their vernacular.  This film is a documentary made up of actors reading some of these interviews to tell the story of slavery and what it was like for these men and women.  The documentary uses photos and old video footage to augment the slave narratives.  Along with the photos and video footage, we also see the actors reading the narratives, speaking in character.  This film is narrated by Whoopi Goldberg and features readings by: Angela Bassett, Don Cheadle, Samuel L Jackson, Oprah Winfrey, Jasmine Guy, Ossie Davis, Courtney B Vance, Alfe Woodard, and others.The strongest part of this film, as you might expect, is hearing the words of the former slaves and see photographs from that time.  This is powerful, powerful stuff.  What is less effective is seeing the actors read the narratives.  They are perfectly in character, but seeing the actors sitting there delivering the lines is less powerful than just hearing it.  Unfortunately, the film also shows the actors right before and after they read the narratives.  While the actors are very moved by what they have read and they are very respectful towards the material, it takes us out of the moment and pulls back from the power of the words.  This only happens a couple of times, fortunately.I would definitely recommend this film, especially to high school and college students.  This should be part of the curriculum and not be ignored or skipped over, like the subject often is.  These narratives are powerful and moving.

732250,A22RE7V8QZFICW,B00007M5KT,Lizard,"[11, 30]","This disappointed me..., March 21, 2006Reviewer: Thom (Polk County, Florida) - See all my reviewsIf this film centered on the actual slaves, rather than the ACTORS making narration, it would have been a very powerful documentary. While reading it should have focused on the drawings, and dipictions. When I saw a great deal of the YOUNG actors on a chair reciting prose-to me it seemed more to accentuate the actors rather than what the text was saying.Just the fact that slavery existed under the United States Constitution shows how law can be manipulated in any way those in power want it to be and the goverment can do whatever they want and get away with it. Remember it was legal only 200 years ago, and suppression and rediculous repression of human beings based on race existed even in the 1970's. And it was legal back then.Based on the horrible adverse treatment of slaves, it showed the majority of southern businessmen were very POOR businessmen. THink about it--they spent HUGE--and I mean HUGE quantities--of money ($800 or $1000 was a vast fortune back in the 1800's) only to beat and starve and work them to death like, they are not protecting their investments. You would think common sense dictates if one spent vast fortunes, they would want to CARE for their investment (feed them, clothe them adequately, gave them proper shelter, etc). No, these businessmen starved and tortured their investments. I guess they had money to throw away. This lack of business sense probably is a reason why the south lost.The slave trade was a big business back then. Huge quantities of slaves were NOT captured in Africa, but were sold to the white slave traders by their own people. And yes Africans kept slaves too--blacks enslaved blacks.Interesting to note even Abraham Lincoln cared less about the existance of slavery but wrote the Emancipation Proclamation only as a political ploy to not get European nations involved, and that the Civil war was, in reality, only to keep the north and south united and not form a separate government.Back to the documentary-yes it disappointed me. I didn't know what showing the actors sitting and reciting proved. The actor's faces should not have been shown at all. It distracted from the real theme of memories of slavery. These actors should have been faceless and not seen. Unless they wanted to play dipictions rather than just SIT and READ.",2,This disappointed me...,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2394,"['disappointed', 'March', '21', '2006Reviewer', 'Thom', 'Polk', 'County', 'Florida', 'See', 'reviewsIf', 'film', 'centered', 'actual', 'slaves', 'rather', 'ACTORS', 'making', 'narration', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'powerful', 'documentary', 'reading', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'drawings', 'dipictions', 'When', 'saw', 'great', 'deal', 'YOUNG', 'actors', 'chair', 'reciting', 'prose-to', 'seemed', 'more', 'accentuate', 'actors', 'rather', 'what', 'text', 'was', 'saying.Just', 'fact', 'slavery', 'existed', 'United', 'States', 'Constitution', 'how', 'law', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'way', 'power', 'want', 'be', 'goverment', 'can', 'do', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'Remember', 'was', 'legal', 'only', '200', 'years', 'ago', 'suppression', 'rediculous', 'repression', 'human', 'beings', 'based', 'race', 'existed', 'even', '1970', 'was', 'legal', 'back', 'then.Based', 'horrible', 'adverse', 'treatment', 'slaves', 'showed', 'majority', 'southern', 'businessmen', 'were', 'very', 'POOR', 'businessmen', 'THink', 'spent', 'HUGE', 'mean', 'HUGE', 'quantities', 'money', '800', '1000', 'was', 'vast', 'fortune', 'back', '1800', 'only', 'beat', 'starve', 'work', 'death', 'are', 'not', 'protecting', 'investments', 'would', 'think', 'common', 'sense', 'one', 'spent', 'vast', 'fortunes', 'would', 'want', 'CARE', 'investment', 'feed', 'clothe', 'adequately', 'gave', 'proper', 'shelter', 'etc', 'No', 'businessmen', 'starved', 'tortured', 'investments', 'guess', 'had', 'money', 'throw', 'away', 'lack', 'business', 'sense', 'probably', 'reason', 'why', 'south', 'lost.The', 'slave', 'trade', 'was', 'big', 'business', 'back', 'then', 'Huge', 'quantities', 'slaves', 'were', 'NOT', 'captured', 'Africa', 'were', 'sold', 'white', 'slave', 'traders', 'own', 'people', 'yes', 'Africans', 'kept', 'slaves', 'too', 'blacks', 'enslaved', 'blacks.Interesting', 'note', 'even', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'cared', 'less', 'existance', 'slavery', 'wrote', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'only', 'political', 'ploy', 'not', 'get', 'European', 'nations', 'involved', 'Civil', 'war', 'was', 'reality', 'only', 'keep', 'north', 'south', 'united', 'not', 'form', 'separate', 'government.Back', 'documentary-yes', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'showing', 'actors', 'sitting', 'reciting', 'proved', 'actor', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'distracted', 'real', 'theme', 'memories', 'slavery', 'actors', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'faceless', 'not', 'seen', 'wanted', 'play', 'dipictions', 'rather', 'just', 'SIT', 'READ']",N/A

I used that book to provide my students with a deeper understanding of slavery before assigning ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.""  Like Lester's book, ""Unchained Memories"" relies heavily on the Federal Writers Project of the late 1930's when dozens of interviewers sought to collect the stories of thousands of ex-slaves.What this 75-minute documentary does is recreate those interviews with actors reciting word for word from those personal slave narratives. Along with period photos and occasional recreated film footage, what you get is a deeply moving look at the most shameful period in our nation's history.While I agree with some of the detractors that some of the actors get a bit too much screen time, it's still difficult not to be moved by these first-person accounts. The variety of voice actors used really bring these stories to life. [I was especially pleased to see Courtney B Vance--who was Miss Watson's Jim in the most recent film adaptation of ""Huck Finn.""]In addition, there are a couple of fascinating bonus features.
