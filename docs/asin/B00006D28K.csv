The story line is incredibly complex, centering around the destiny of Kamui, who will ultimately decide his destiny and the fate of the world.  Along the way there are hard decisions, heartbreak and tragedy, which all help to develop the plot and the characters more fully.  Obviously since this is a CLAMP series there are some twists and turns along the way that you wouldn't see coming, and keep you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend this to any anime fan, or really anyone for that matter.  While it can be confusing at times with so many characters and so many things going on, this is well worth the effort to sort through some of that and come to the heart of it.",5,Well worth the effort,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,779,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'now', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'time', 'story', 'line', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'centering', 'destiny', 'Kamui', 'who', 'will', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'destiny', 'fate', 'world', 'way', 'are', 'hard', 'decisions', 'heartbreak', 'tragedy', 'help', 'develop', 'plot', 'characters', 'more', 'fully', 'Obviously', 'CLAMP', 'series', 'are', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anime', 'fan', 'really', 'anyone', 'matter', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'times', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'well', 'effort', 'sort', 'come', 'heart']",N/A
712399,A1AR8HYZ17T5H7,B00006D28K,"""arxane""","[0, 0]","Whether you love or hate CLAMP, you can't ignore their impact on the anime and manga industry. While they're known best for their cute shoujo-style works (""Magic Knight Rayearth"", ""Cardcaptor Sakura""), one of their darkest manga series is ""X"", a story which has yet to be finished. Still, because the story was already marvelously laid out, the series was made into an anime movie simply called ""X"". The results created a movie that has a devout cult following yet failed to satisfy the majority of anime fans. The movie's biggest problem was that it attempted to cram so much of the manga into a very limited amount of time, leaving virtually no room for plot logic and character development. The ""X: TV"" series had decided to remedy that, bringing CLAMP's dark tale to life the way it was meant to be told.""X: TV"" tells the story of Kamui, a bitter young man who has returned to Tokyo for reasons that are his own. He also happens to return when the Seven Seals are gathering to the city so that they may get ready for the Day of Judgement, when they are to battle the Seven Angels for the fate of the world. Little does Kamui know that he plays perhaps the biggest role in this drama, and it's not a role he is particularly interested in playing. Add in the possibility that two of his childhood friends, Fuma and Kotori, may also play a part in the upcoming battle and we have one of CLAMP's masterpieces.The first three episodes on this first DVD are very slow paced, introducing many of the main characters more often than anything, but that's perhaps exactly what the series should do. In just one episode, ""X: TV"" gave more character depth to the Seven Seals than the entire movie ever did. And there's no lack of action, either. Kamui has power and he knows how to use it, and he puts that power to some good use even in the first episode. As for the characters themselves, they are surprisingly well developed for the little screen time they're allowed with such a huge character roster. As the series moves along, it'll be interesting to see how some of these characters truly grow.Visually, ""X: TV"" puts the movie to shame, and that's saying a lot. While the ""X"" movie was flimsy on substance, it had undeniable style, showcasing some of the best animation available during that time. ""X: TV"" takes everything one step further, creating a breathtaking showcase for animation. Never before has hair looked so vibrant, have eyes looked so deep, and has movement glided so smoothly. The attention to detail in the series is outstanding, easily on par if not surpassing other great series like the almighty ""Cowboy Bebop"".Soundwise, the score for ""X: TV"" compliments the visuals very well. The soundtrack isn't the most memorable of soundtracks, but what we do hear is very well thoughtout and pleasing. Concerning the dub, Pioneer has managed to create another wonderful dub on par with its magnificent ""Serial Experiments Lain"" dub, if not better. Don't expect the moment-defining performances like in ""Cowboy Bebop"", but do expect an English track where all the voice actors fit their roles and where they bring depth to their characters. Of course, if you prefer subs, the Japanese track is also good.As for extras, Pioneer has given us a very surprising extra: ""Episode 0"". ""Episode 0"" was originally an episode-length promotional piece that had a small prequel story to ""X: TV"" and clips from the actual anime, showcasing scenes with all the major characters. The overall effect is pulled off very nicely, but be warned. Do not watch ""Episode 0"" if you do not wish to spoil some parts of the series, as it does show scenes very deep into the series.Overall, the first DVD to ""X: TV"" is a magnificent title with the beginning to possibly a monumental series. While it's too early to see where the series will really head with only three episodes, ""X: [ONE]"" gives us very good reason to believe we won't be disappointed.",5,"Slow-paced yet enthralling beginning, just as it should be!",1034553600,"10 14, 2002",2002,3933,"['love', 'hate', 'CLAMP', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'impact', 'anime', 'manga', 'industry', ""'re"", 'known', 'best', 'cute', 'shoujo-style', 'works', 'Magic', 'Knight', 'Rayearth', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'one', 'darkest', 'manga', 'series', 'X', 'story', 'yet', 'be', 'finished', 'Still', 'story', 'was', 'already', 'marvelously', 'laid', 'out', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'anime', 'movie', 'simply', 'called', 'X', 'results', 'created', 'movie', 'devout', 'cult', 'following', 'yet', 'failed', 'satisfy', 'majority', 'anime', 'fans', 'movie', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'attempted', 'cram', 'so', 'much', 'manga', 'very', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'leaving', 'virtually', 'room', 'plot', 'logic', 'character', 'development', 'X', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'decided', 'remedy', 'bringing', 'CLAMP', 'dark', 'tale', 'life', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'told', 'X', 'TV', 'story', 'Kamui', 'bitter', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'returned', 'Tokyo', 'reasons', 'are', 'own', 'also', 'return', 'when', 'Seven', 'Seals', 'are', 'gathering', 'city', 'so', 'may', 'get', 'ready', 'Day', 'Judgement', 'when', 'are', 'battle', 'Seven', 'Angels', 'fate', 'world', 'Little', 'Kamui', 'know', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'role', 'drama', 'not', 'role', 'particularly', 'interested', 'playing', 'Add', 'possibility', 'two', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Fuma', 'Kotori', 'may', 'also', 'play', 'part', 'upcoming', 'battle', 'have', 'one', 'CLAMP', 'masterpieces.The', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'first', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'slow', 'paced', 'introducing', 'many', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'often', 'anything', 'perhaps', 'exactly', 'what', 'series', 'should', 'do', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'X', 'TV', 'gave', 'more', 'character', 'depth', 'Seven', 'Seals', 'entire', 'movie', 'ever', 'did', 'lack', 'action', 'either', 'Kamui', 'power', 'how', 'use', 'power', 'good', 'use', 'even', 'first', 'episode', 'characters', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'developed', 'little', 'screen', 'time', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'huge', 'character', 'roster', 'series', 'along', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'truly', 'grow.Visually', 'X', 'TV', 'movie', 'shame', 'saying', 'lot', 'X', 'movie', 'was', 'flimsy', 'substance', 'had', 'undeniable', 'style', 'showcasing', 'best', 'animation', 'available', 'time', 'X', 'TV', 'everything', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'creating', 'breathtaking', 'showcase', 'animation', 'Never', 'hair', 'looked', 'so', 'vibrant', 'have', 'eyes', 'looked', 'so', 'deep', 'movement', 'glided', 'so', 'smoothly', 'attention', 'detail', 'series', 'outstanding', 'easily', 'par', 'not', 'surpassing', 'other', 'great', 'series', 'almighty', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', '.Soundwise', 'score', 'X', 'TV', 'visuals', 'very', 'well', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'most', 'memorable', 'soundtracks', 'what', 'do', 'hear', 'very', 'well', 'pleasing', 'Concerning', 'dub', 'Pioneer', 'managed', 'create', 'wonderful', 'dub', 'par', 'magnificent', 'Serial', 'Experiments', 'Lain', 'dub', 'not', 'better', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'moment-defining', 'performances', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'do', 'expect', 'English', 'track', 'where', 'voice', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles', 'where', 'bring', 'depth', 'characters', 'course', 'prefer', 'subs', 'Japanese', 'track', 'also', 'good.As', 'extras', 'Pioneer', 'given', 'very', 'surprising', 'extra', 'Episode', '0', 'Episode', '0', 'was', 'originally', 'episode-length', 'promotional', 'piece', 'had', 'small', 'prequel', 'story', 'X', 'TV', 'clips', 'actual', 'anime', 'showcasing', 'scenes', 'major', 'characters', 'overall', 'effect', 'pulled', 'off', 'very', 'nicely', 'be', 'warned', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', 'Episode', '0', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'spoil', 'parts', 'series', 'show', 'scenes', 'very', 'deep', 'series.Overall', 'first', 'DVD', 'X', 'TV', 'magnificent', 'title', 'beginning', 'possibly', 'monumental', 'series', 'too', 'early', 'see', 'where', 'series', 'will', 'really', 'head', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'X', '[', 'ONE', ']', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'believe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

712402,A2DK2OY6R3WICK,B00006D28K,C.W. Fitch,"[2, 3]","Arguably the female manga team CLAMP's best creation, &quot;X&quot; was chopped up into a nice salad-sized feature film a few years back.  Though it was very well made, the movie leaves out quite a bit of the excellent original story.This is the &quot;X&quot; TV series...and it's all filler, all killer.  I think it's safe to say that if you're a manga/anime fan, you've probably at least heard of this series.  Basically, the TV series serves as the &quot;official&quot; anime adaptation.  It does a top-notch job of bringing the manga and its characters to life, with splendiferous animation that fiercely rivals that of the movie.  The animation style is strikingly faithful to CLAMP's original design, complete with gorgeous characters (with chins that could possibly put one's eye out if not properly aimed), gloomy cityscapes, and special effects.  The effects are even enhanced with a pinch of that magical computer-generated animation everyone's been talking about.  It adds a whole other dimension.That's all well and good, you say, but what's it ABOUT?  All right, I'll get you started:  the powers of Heaven (the good guys) and the powers of Earth (the bad guys) are about to wage war over the fate of the world, and each faction has sent seven harbingers (also called Seals, Angels, Dragons, etc., etc.) to do battle with each other.  One young man, Kamui Shiro, is being eyed by both sides as the one whose incredible psychic powers will tip the scales and seal the world's fate.  Needless to say, both Heaven and Earth want Kamui to play for their team (that's about as far as this first volume goes), but Kamui could care less.  Nevertheless, he becomes involved whether he likes it or not, and it may put those he cares about in danger as well.  The fate of the world's no joke, you know.  The story's a little bit deeper than that, as you may know, but there's not room here to go into it.  You'll just have to find out for yourself.  I will say this, though; the harbingers' own psychic abilities are a wonder to behold as they fight one another, and there's plenty of  violent action to complement the quickly-building story.The Vol. 1 DVD contains the first three episodes, plus a &quot;bonus&quot; Episode 0 (nice marketing, Pioneer...), which is little more than a sneak peek at the whole series.  As far as extras, just a DVD credits screen, a trailer, and previews of other Pioneer anime titles (there's no &quot;previews menu&quot;, though, like in ADV Films' DVD's; you've gotta just sit through them all).In short, this is just a fantastic, and very dark, fantasy anime series set in modern times, and if you've read the funny books and/or enjoyed the full-length film, you'll simply revel in this stuff.  If you never have, don't worry.  You'll enjoy it just as much.",5,Oooohhhh...pretty...,1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,2796,"['Arguably', 'female', 'manga', 'team', 'CLAMP', 'best', 'creation', 'quot', 'X', 'quot', 'was', 'chopped', 'up', 'nice', 'salad-sized', 'feature', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'excellent', 'original', 'story.This', 'quot', 'X', 'quot', 'TV', 'series', 'filler', 'killer', 'think', 'safe', 'say', ""'re"", 'manga/anime', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'least', 'heard', 'series', 'Basically', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'official', 'quot', 'anime', 'adaptation', 'top-notch', 'job', 'bringing', 'manga', 'characters', 'life', 'splendiferous', 'animation', 'fiercely', 'movie', 'animation', 'style', 'strikingly', 'faithful', 'CLAMP', 'original', 'design', 'complete', 'gorgeous', 'characters', 'chins', 'could', 'possibly', 'put', 'one', 'eye', 'not', 'properly', 'aimed', 'gloomy', 'cityscapes', 'special', 'effects', 'effects', 'are', 'even', 'enhanced', 'pinch', 'magical', 'computer-generated', 'animation', 'everyone', 'been', 'talking', 'whole', 'other', 'dimension.That', 'well', 'good', 'say', 'what', 'ABOUT', 'All', 'right', ""'ll"", 'get', 'started', 'powers', 'Heaven', 'good', 'guys', 'powers', 'Earth', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'wage', 'war', 'fate', 'world', 'faction', 'sent', 'seven', 'harbingers', 'also', 'called', 'Seals', 'Angels', 'Dragons', 'etc.', 'etc', 'do', 'battle', 'other', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'Kamui', 'Shiro', 'being', 'eyed', 'sides', 'one', 'incredible', 'psychic', 'powers', 'will', 'tip', 'scales', 'seal', 'world', 'fate', 'Needless', 'say', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'want', 'Kamui', 'play', 'team', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'first', 'volume', 'Kamui', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Nevertheless', 'involved', 'not', 'may', 'put', 'danger', 'as', 'well', 'fate', 'world', 'joke', 'know', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'deeper', 'may', 'know', 'not', 'room', 'here', 'go', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'harbingers', 'own', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'are', 'wonder', 'behold', 'fight', 'one', 'plenty', 'violent', 'action', 'complement', 'quickly-building', 'story.The', 'Vol', '1', 'DVD', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'quot', 'quot', 'Episode', '0', 'nice', 'marketing', 'Pioneer', 'little', 'more', 'sneak', 'peek', 'whole', 'series', 'As', 'far', 'extras', 'just', 'DVD', 'credits', 'screen', 'trailer', 'previews', 'other', 'Pioneer', 'anime', 'titles', 'quot', 'menu', 'quot', 'ADV', 'Films', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'just', 'sit', '.In', 'short', 'just', 'fantastic', 'very', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'anime', 'series', 'set', 'modern', 'times', ""'ve"", 'read', 'funny', 'books', 'and/or', 'enjoyed', 'full-length', 'film', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'revel', 'stuff', 'never', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'just', 'as', 'much']",N/A

712405,A3PAMMMH9F56K9,B00006D28K,Giacomo C.,"[1, 1]","As has been stated by many, the film which precedes the series and seeks to compress the entire story into its brief time span is painfully inadequate.  Visually it is very interesting, but it is just too much in too little time.The series is obviously a big improvement in this regard - in twenty-five episodes (24 really, the first is an odd introductory melange of scenes from the rest of the series) it is able to present the story and its numerous characters much more clearly.  Even so, there are still flaws.  The emotional tension of the show is quite over the top - and this begins before we have developed any real understanding of the characters.  How is the audience to sympathize with these, as yet, strangers?  Admitedly, the plot does revolve around an impending apocalypse, so the emotional tension should be high - but it all proceeds at such a breathless pace, with, I feel, insufficient development of the characters, and misplaced emphases.  All we really get to know about them is a single supposedly defining experience in each of their pasts which set the course of their lives, and little else after that (not even that for some of the dragons of the earth).  It seems to me that there is still compression at work here - compression which could perhaps have been avoided with a more tightly organized progression.  A frustrating and overused device was the dependence on repeatedly showing the same half dozen clips in nearly every episode (this failing is hardly unique to this series alone, obviously) - this is time that could have been put to much better use.  Also there is another wasted episode halfway through which, like the first, is again made up entirely of clips of what we have already seen and adds nothing.Animes like Berserk or Witch Hunter Robin (two random examples which come to mind) do a better job at handling the continuous development and progression of their plots, and numerous characters (even though the first half of Witch Hunter Robin may not appear to at first).It IS visually striking though (as the film was) - with some very well done blending of 3d and 2d animation.The musical score is also nicely done, though again its emotionally charged main theme is played at some odd junctures conjuring up strange meanings...From all this you may think that I did not like X TV, but that is not the case really - I did.

Seven guardians of Heaven and Seven of Earth are set to square off for the future direction of the planet, each group's most powerful member is an individual of dual existence named Kamui.  If the first Kamui chooses destruction of the earth, the second Kamui is awakened to face him and vice versa.  Most interestingly though is the compelling story lines of the supporting characters, each is given a suitable vignette and even the `villains' are thoughtful and interesting.  I particularly liked the arc of the love story of Sorata and Arashi.  The former a gregarious monk and the latter a quiet introverted dark beauty.  He is fated to die for the woman he loves and when he declares that to her on the `first date' she's suitably taken aback, but watching her slowly come to love him was a nice romantic touch.  Both Kamuis intentionally tend to mirror those around them and fail to provide much individuality until the end game.  Colors on the DVD were somewhat muted, but the art was stylized and very good.  In Clamp style many of the characters are androgynous to the point where you can't tell which lead to some confusing moments.  This was an enjoyable 20+ episode series.

This is something X The Movie didnt get a chance to do at all. I watched the film a few times and still had trouble figuring out who was who aside from a few key characters.You mainly get to touch on the 7 Dragons of Heaven, Kamui, Karen, Seiichiro, Yuziriha, Subara, Lady Arashi, and Soroto who is my personal favorite character. Essentially because he makes me laugh a lot. You do get to meet a few of the Dragons of Earth, but not a whole lot of them. Overall this is really a stepping stone into the real meat of the story. Not that these arent interesting, because they are, but it gets so so much better in the later episodes.I love the storylines in X, even though Kamui is the typical anti hero which is usually an anime staple he is done so wonderfully. The director took great care into making sure he was both fierce and yet there was a reason behind his ferocity. The musical score is also fantastic, during some of the more intense moments the score was flawless in increasing the tension. You can tell that much attention to detail went into this project.

Two groups, the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth are enmeshed in a struggle for ascendancy over Tokyo that would ultimately decide the fate of the world.  Those of earth seek to destroy in order to recreate the world anew, and those of Heaven seek to preserve and revitalize the existing sources of power.  Into this struggle steps Kamui, a young man who has returned to Tokyo to reclaim the Shinken or divine sword.  In doing so, he will make a series of decisions that bring about the final resolution of the struggle.When a feature length film was made from the manga, it became painfully obvious that this is too much story to be communicated in 90 minutes.  Almost twenty major characters are involved and the needs of the limited format ensured that only a few received enough attention to gain definition.  The plot itself is complex, and depends on the characters to progress.  The best the film could do was to be a beautifully crafted and acted but infinitely fragile production.  The result left everyone a bit dissatisfied.  Unwilling to write off Rintaro's efforts completely, director Yoshiaki Kawajiri undertook to remake the story as a full-length television series.  Insisting on a high level of production values, especially for the graphics and musical work, he has managed not only to surpass the film, but also to improve upon the story telling of the manga.This first DVD sets the gothic, art nouveau styling of the story, sketches out the bones of the plot, and begins to bring the characters on stage.  This is no small task, and the viewer is warned to read the accompanying character guide and be willing to tolerate a bit of confusion before everything is sorted out and the characters have developed sufficient personalities so that the plot and the cast begin to mesh.The key characters to come on board in the beginning are the trio of Kamui Shirou, Fuma Monou and his sister Kotori Monou.  Kamui, who knew the Monou's as children, has returned to Tokyo.  Despite his every effort to keep his old friends at a distance, fate takes charge.  Because Kamui's own decision about his role in the coming cataclysm will force a parallel decision from Fuma, and brings Kotori into a tragic conflict between duty and desire.  Two other characters of early interest (both Dragons of Heaven) are Sorata Arisugawa, an unlikely priest from Mt. Kouya, and Hinoto, a dreamseer who keeps the Dragons organized until Kamui can make his decision.At this early stage, this series shows every sign of being a landmark effort.  Whether it will finally succeed will depend on Kawajiri's ability to tame the complex story and large cast.  So far the director has proven up to the challenge.  This series is well worth continued attention.",5,To Preserve or to Destroy,1045440000,"02 17, 2003",2003,2857,"['Clamp', 'Cooperative', 'original', 'manga', 'series', 'X', 'was', 'complex', 'doom-filled', 'apocalyptic', 'vision', 'Two', 'groups', 'Dragons', 'Heaven', 'Dragons', 'Earth', 'are', 'enmeshed', 'struggle', 'ascendancy', 'Tokyo', 'would', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'fate', 'world', 'earth', 'seek', 'destroy', 'order', 'recreate', 'world', 'anew', 'Heaven', 'seek', 'preserve', 'revitalize', 'existing', 'sources', 'power', 'struggle', 'steps', 'Kamui', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'returned', 'Tokyo', 'reclaim', 'Shinken', 'divine', 'sword', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'make', 'series', 'decisions', 'bring', 'final', 'resolution', 'struggle.When', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'manga', 'became', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'be', 'communicated', '90', 'minutes', 'Almost', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'involved', 'needs', 'limited', 'format', 'ensured', 'only', 'few', 'received', 'enough', 'attention', 'gain', 'definition', 'plot', 'complex', 'characters', 'progress', 'best', 'film', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'be', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'acted', 'infinitely', 'fragile', 'production', 'result', 'left', 'everyone', 'bit', 'dissatisfied', 'Unwilling', 'write', 'off', 'Rintaro', 'efforts', 'completely', 'director', 'Yoshiaki', 'Kawajiri', 'undertook', 'remake', 'story', 'full-length', 'television', 'series', 'Insisting', 'high', 'level', 'production', 'values', 'especially', 'graphics', 'musical', 'work', 'managed', 'not', 'only', 'surpass', 'film', 'also', 'improve', 'story', 'telling', 'manga.This', 'first', 'DVD', 'gothic', 'art', 'nouveau', 'styling', 'story', 'out', 'bones', 'plot', 'bring', 'characters', 'stage', 'small', 'task', 'viewer', 'warned', 'read', 'accompanying', 'character', 'guide', 'be', 'willing', 'tolerate', 'bit', 'confusion', 'everything', 'sorted', 'characters', 'have', 'developed', 'sufficient', 'personalities', 'plot', 'cast', 'begin', 'mesh.The', 'key', 'characters', 'come', 'board', 'beginning', 'are', 'trio', 'Kamui', 'Shirou', 'Fuma', 'Monou', 'sister', 'Kotori', 'Monou', 'Kamui', 'who', 'knew', 'Monou', 'children', 'returned', 'Tokyo', 'effort', 'keep', 'old', 'friends', 'distance', 'fate', 'charge', 'Kamui', 'own', 'decision', 'role', 'coming', 'cataclysm', 'will', 'force', 'parallel', 'decision', 'Fuma', 'Kotori', 'tragic', 'conflict', 'duty', 'desire', 'Two', 'other', 'characters', 'early', 'interest', 'Dragons', 'Heaven', 'are', 'Sorata', 'Arisugawa', 'unlikely', 'priest', 'Mt', 'Kouya', 'Hinoto', 'dreamseer', 'who', 'Dragons', 'organized', 'Kamui', 'can', 'make', 'decision.At', 'early', 'stage', 'series', 'sign', 'being', 'landmark', 'effort', 'will', 'finally', 'succeed', 'will', 'depend', 'Kawajiri', 'ability', 'tame', 'complex', 'story', 'large', 'cast', 'So', 'far', 'director', 'proven', 'up', 'challenge', 'series', 'well', 'worth', 'continued', 'attention']",N/A

The series does some justice to the manga, which I have started looking at.I figured out the plot from the X movie, but that hasn't stopped me from being interested in this series. Kamui is portrayed differently from the movie. He is much darker and barely ever shows emotion. It will be interesting to see how he changes throughout the series. Sorata is quite interesting as well. The flashback scenes of him as a young monk are entertaining, and remind me of Evangelion in a way. Each character is extremely important to the series, and more are introduced in the next dvd.The only negative thing about this series so far in my mind is the fact that the dvds only contain 3 episodes each. They did this because they realized they could get more money. They definetly could of fit more episodes on one dvd, like Cowboy Bebop did.

712414,A3FIKATQ286DMV,B00006D28K,Niko,"[7, 8]","The outline that follows is an outline that refers to the entire series and spoilers will be included.To begin with, if you are looking for an anime that is more in the style of Love Hina, than you should skip this one. If on the other hand, you are looking for an anime that is powerful, emotional, has love/romance, great character development and strong story, than you are definitely right here.Outline of the story:The story resolves around the Seven guardians of Heaven and the Seven guardians of Earth. The one group wants to preserve earth as it, believes in humanity no matter what they have done to earth, and hope for a better future. The other group wants to erase humanity from the face of earth so that the planet and its other creatures can life in peace etc.The `problem' is that when watching the show you will - like it or not - agree with both groups (not to mention the fact that there is no `black - white answer' but a grey version (You will have to watch it in order to understand or otherwise I will give the entire show away, sorry guys)). Apart from it, the age of the group members does not matter much; meaning that you will see in both groups' teenagers and adults fighting side-by-side or against each other till death. Others will fight against the other group for their own personal reasons.The biggest problem however is that there can be only one Kamui (chosen one) and the side he decides to follow will win; but, it proofs that the real Kamui has a twin star, meaning that there is another Kamui out there as well. This will lead to an explosive mixture of emotions. Lovers, who will belong to the opposing group, will be forced to fight till death against each other, brother against brother, best friend against best friend and so forth. To be honest, the story will get very emotional indeed. No matter the age, the group members will fight and die.As for the action, you will get more than enough. To begin with, the fights occur in both astral plane and our materialistic world. In order to prevent damages in our world, the group members are able to form a kind of a shield, in which most fights happen, and no matter the destruction our reality remains unaltered. That is, if the fights remain inside the shield, something that will not always be the case. In addition, all group members have their own supernatural `super powers' etc. For instance, some can use the five elements, some others are psychics, some others use magic, some take advantage of technology, some bend reality etc.Who will win in the end and what will be the cost of this destructive victory?The genre of this anime could be categorized under: fantasy, supernatural, action, and love / romance.The music that accompanies the show is very well orchestrated and good. Starts with a rock/pop song and ends up with a melancholic ballad. In-between the music changes in accordance with the shows (very good done).As for the dub, in my humble opinion, it is very good and professional done, in the same level as CB is done.The animation is excellent.As for extras, it has more or less the typical stuff: Textless opening and ending, previews, trailers etc.As for the box-set: The first DVD comes with the box and every DVD you buy it fits in there; imagine it something like a shelf.As for the story: It is very emotional, has great character development, solid storyline (that moves forth and back, with flashbacks etc.), many twists and is very mature and character driven.Tip: The first episode, called X-0, of the first DVD is like a prelude and `summation' of the story. If you don't want anything to be given to you in front but want to be glued to your sits from episode one, that skip this one.Last but not least, is it worth buying or not? In two words: Definitely yes! However, by collecting all 8 volumes the cost may raise around $200. To be honest, it is worth having in your collection but if the cost might seem to you as an obstacle than try to rent it and to watch it.  The show is highly recommended!I hope that I could help you, if so than please click on the yes button below ^_^",5,Incredible and Powerful!!!,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,4110,"['outline', 'outline', 'entire', 'series', 'spoilers', 'will', 'be', 'included.To', 'begin', 'are', 'looking', 'anime', 'more', 'style', 'Love', 'Hina', 'should', 'skip', 'one', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'looking', 'anime', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'love/romance', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'strong', 'story', 'are', 'definitely', 'right', 'here.Outline', 'story', 'story', 'Seven', 'guardians', 'Heaven', 'Seven', 'guardians', 'Earth', 'one', 'group', 'preserve', 'earth', 'humanity', 'matter', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'earth', 'hope', 'better', 'future', 'other', 'group', 'erase', 'humanity', 'face', 'earth', 'planet', 'other', 'creatures', 'can', 'life', 'peace', 'etc.The', 'problem', 'when', 'watching', 'show', 'will', 'like', 'not', 'agree', 'groups', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'black', 'white', 'answer', 'grey', 'version', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'order', 'understand', 'otherwise', 'will', 'give', 'entire', 'show', 'away', 'sorry', 'guys', 'Apart', 'age', 'group', 'members', 'not', 'matter', 'much', 'meaning', 'will', 'see', 'groups', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'fighting', 'side-by-side', 'other', 'till', 'death', 'Others', 'will', 'fight', 'other', 'group', 'own', 'personal', 'reasons.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'however', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'Kamui', 'chosen', 'one', 'side', 'follow', 'will', 'win', 'real', 'Kamui', 'twin', 'star', 'meaning', 'Kamui', 'out', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'lead', 'explosive', 'mixture', 'emotions', 'Lovers', 'who', 'will', 'belong', 'opposing', 'group', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'fight', 'till', 'death', 'other', 'brother', 'brother', 'best', 'friend', 'best', 'friend', 'so', 'forth', 'be', 'honest', 'story', 'will', 'get', 'very', 'emotional', 'indeed', 'matter', 'age', 'group', 'members', 'will', 'fight', 'die.As', 'action', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'enough', 'begin', 'fights', 'occur', 'astral', 'plane', 'materialistic', 'world', 'order', 'prevent', 'damages', 'world', 'group', 'members', 'are', 'able', 'form', 'kind', 'shield', 'most', 'fights', 'happen', 'matter', 'destruction', 'reality', 'unaltered', 'fights', 'remain', 'shield', 'something', 'will', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'case', 'addition', 'group', 'members', 'have', 'own', 'supernatural', 'super', 'powers', 'etc', 'instance', 'can', 'use', 'five', 'elements', 'others', 'are', 'psychics', 'others', 'use', 'magic', 'take', 'advantage', 'technology', 'bend', 'reality', 'etc.Who', 'will', 'win', 'end', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'cost', 'destructive', 'victory', 'genre', 'anime', 'could', 'be', 'categorized', 'fantasy', 'supernatural', 'action', 'love', '/', 'romance.The', 'music', 'show', 'very', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'good', 'rock/pop', 'song', 'up', 'melancholic', 'ballad', 'In-between', 'music', 'changes', 'accordance', 'shows', 'very', 'good', 'done', '.As', 'dub', 'humble', 'opinion', 'very', 'good', 'professional', 'done', 'same', 'level', 'CB', 'done.The', 'animation', 'excellent.As', 'extras', 'more', 'less', 'typical', 'stuff', 'Textless', 'opening', 'ending', 'previews', 'trailers', 'etc.As', 'box-set', 'first', 'DVD', 'box', 'DVD', 'buy', 'imagine', 'something', 'shelf.As', 'story', 'very', 'emotional', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'solid', 'storyline', 'forth', 'back', 'flashbacks', 'etc', 'many', 'twists', 'very', 'mature', 'character', 'driven.Tip', 'first', 'episode', 'called', 'X-0', 'first', 'DVD', 'prelude', 'summation', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'be', 'given', 'front', 'want', 'be', 'glued', 'sits', 'episode', 'one', 'one.Last', 'not', 'least', 'worth', 'buying', 'not', 'two', 'words', 'Definitely', 'yes', 'However', 'collecting', '8', 'volumes', 'cost', 'may', 'raise', '200', 'be', 'honest', 'worth', 'having', 'collection', 'cost', 'might', 'seem', 'obstacle', 'try', 'rent', 'watch', 'show', 'highly', 'recommended', 'hope', 'could', 'help', 'so', 'please', 'click', 'yes', 'button', '^_^']",N/A
