830890,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0002CX21K,calvinnme,"[4, 7]","The only reason to own this season is that it is Jerry Orbach's last as Lenny Briscoe. However, even as his last season of L&O;, it does not have the best Briscoe-centric episodes or the best Briscoe wise-cracks, nor are there extra features dedicated to him in this set. Viewing this season and season four back-to-back, it is sadly obvious how far L&O; has fallen over the years, even before Lenny Briscoe exited stage left. Truly, the last good casting decision on the show was when Jesse L. Martin was picked to play detective Ed Green back in 1999, and I also thought Dianne Wiest did a pretty good job of playing an interim D.A. for the two years after Steven Hill left. However it is implausable that (a) An extremely conservative Southern lawyer would CHOOSE to set up shop in NYC and that (b) the good citizens of NYC would then elect him District Attorney. Jerry Falwell would have a better chance of being elected mayor there than Arthur Branch would have of being elected district attorney. Also, Joss Whedon saw early on that Elizabeth Rohm was attracting sharks to his ""Angel"" series, even in the limited dramatic role she had on that show during its first season. This is something that was lost on NBC when they picked her to play ADA Serena Southerlyn. But as I've said before, don't get me started.The season opener, ""Bodies"", is pretty good, even if there are some odd holes in the logic being used by the police and the D.A. A creepy cab driver turns out to be a serial killer, but after he's caught, he won't reveal where all his victims' bodies are. McCoy must decide how much to give up to find out where they are, and the killer's defense attorney gets too deeply involved in his client's affairs to the point where he knows where the bodies are too, but won't talk unless his client waives privelege - and he won't.One of the better episodes is ""Gaijin"" in which Van Buren has reservations about Branch's tactics of inventing a tale of a suspect in custody to lure a Ginza nightclub owner back to New York after the Japanese government is unwilling to extradite him to face charges of conspiracy and murder in the death of his wife on a New York City vacation.  During jury selection, the defense attorney excludes every black person. This is because the defendant initially blamed an unidentified black man for his wife's murder. McCoy challenges the one Asian juror, but for reasons unrelated to race. At trial, things go pretty well, but it's hard to tell which way the jury is leaning. There's an interesting moment when the defendant says of Chen, a Chinese-American witness, ""She's Chinese...maybe she thinks all Japanese look alike."" This line seems to be a jab at the typical non-Asian-American stereotype of the appearance of Asians. In spite of all the odd tactics, the defendant is found guilty.The season finale, ""C.O.D"", does have a good plot, being ripped from Hitchcock rather than from the headlines. Following closely a formula Hitchcock made successful in his film ""Strangers on a Train,"" two seemingly random murders are connected only through the coffee shop the widows have in common. One husband was a philandering delivery man, the other a financial tycoon putting the squeeze on his wife's spending habits. In attempting to match the slugs from the first crime, Briscoe and Green stumble across a link to the second, and determine that two complete strangers entered into an agreement to kill one another's husbands. However, the entire episode really belongs to Lenny. Early on in the episode he makes clear his intention to retire. His sweet early moments with Anita, entering into gentle banter, and the scene where Ed learns of his intent to leave has the audience swallowing a little lump in their throat. The last glimpse of him packing up his desk, and taking one final look into the precinct before making a sober exit is one that will be imprinted in the minds of fans for years to come. It may be the most significant departure in the history of the series.In summary, there are some pretty good scripts in this season, but there are also some weak and even boring ones, and it doesn't help matters that by the fourteenth season the cast doesn't gel the way it once did. I can see why some fans would be reluctant to buy individual seasons of L&O;, because I can easily see sometime in the future - probably late in the year, just in time for Christmas - there being a DVD boxed collector's set with the first ten ""golden years"" of L&O; included, and the later seasons just continuing to be sold as individual season DVD sets.",3,The last of the Lenny Briscoe years is less than stellar,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,4585,"['only', 'reason', 'own', 'season', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'last', 'Lenny', 'Briscoe', 'However', 'even', 'last', 'season', 'L', 'O', 'not', 'have', 'best', 'Briscoe-centric', 'episodes', 'best', 'Briscoe', 'wise-cracks', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'dedicated', 'set', 'Viewing', 'season', 'season', 'four', 'back-to-back', 'sadly', 'obvious', 'how', 'far', 'L', 'O', 'fallen', 'years', 'even', 'Lenny', 'Briscoe', 'exited', 'stage', 'left', 'Truly', 'last', 'good', 'casting', 'decision', 'show', 'was', 'when', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'was', 'picked', 'play', 'detective', 'Ed', 'Green', 'back', '1999', 'also', 'thought', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'interim', 'D.A', 'two', 'years', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'left', 'However', 'implausable', 'extremely', 'conservative', 'Southern', 'lawyer', 'would', 'CHOOSE', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'NYC', 'b', 'good', 'citizens', 'NYC', 'would', 'then', 'elect', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Jerry', 'Falwell', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'chance', 'being', 'elected', 'mayor', 'there', 'Arthur', 'Branch', 'would', 'have', 'being', 'elected', 'district', 'attorney', 'Also', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'saw', 'early', 'Elizabeth', 'Rohm', 'was', 'attracting', 'sharks', 'Angel', 'series', 'even', 'limited', 'dramatic', 'role', 'had', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'something', 'was', 'lost', 'NBC', 'when', 'picked', 'play', 'ADA', 'Serena', 'Southerlyn', ""'ve"", 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started.The', 'season', 'opener', 'Bodies', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'are', 'odd', 'holes', 'logic', 'being', 'used', 'police', 'D.A', 'A', 'creepy', 'cab', 'driver', 'out', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'caught', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'where', 'victims', 'bodies', 'are', 'McCoy', 'must', 'decide', 'how', 'much', 'give', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'are', 'killer', 'defense', 'attorney', 'too', 'deeply', 'involved', 'client', 'affairs', 'point', 'where', 'where', 'bodies', 'are', 'too', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'client', 'privelege', 'better', 'episodes', 'Gaijin', 'Van', 'Buren', 'reservations', 'Branch', 'tactics', 'inventing', 'tale', 'suspect', 'custody', 'lure', 'Ginza', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'Japanese', 'government', 'unwilling', 'extradite', 'face', 'charges', 'conspiracy', 'murder', 'death', 'wife', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'vacation', 'jury', 'selection', 'defense', 'attorney', 'black', 'person', 'defendant', 'initially', 'blamed', 'unidentified', 'black', 'man', 'wife', 'murder', 'McCoy', 'one', 'Asian', 'juror', 'reasons', 'unrelated', 'race', 'trial', 'things', 'go', 'pretty', 'well', 'hard', 'tell', 'way', 'jury', 'leaning', 'interesting', 'moment', 'when', 'defendant', 'Chen', 'Chinese-American', 'witness', 'Chinese', 'maybe', 'Japanese', 'look', 'alike', 'line', 'be', 'jab', 'typical', 'non-Asian-American', 'stereotype', 'appearance', 'Asians', 'spite', 'odd', 'tactics', 'defendant', 'found', 'guilty.The', 'season', 'finale', 'C.O.D', 'have', 'good', 'plot', 'being', 'ripped', 'Hitchcock', 'rather', 'headlines', 'Following', 'closely', 'formula', 'Hitchcock', 'made', 'successful', 'film', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'two', 'seemingly', 'random', 'murders', 'are', 'connected', 'only', 'coffee', 'shop', 'widows', 'have', 'common', 'One', 'husband', 'was', 'philandering', 'delivery', 'man', 'other', 'financial', 'tycoon', 'putting', 'squeeze', 'wife', 'spending', 'habits', 'attempting', 'match', 'slugs', 'first', 'crime', 'Briscoe', 'Green', 'stumble', 'link', 'second', 'determine', 'two', 'complete', 'strangers', 'entered', 'agreement', 'kill', 'one', 'husbands', 'However', 'entire', 'episode', 'really', 'Lenny', 'Early', 'episode', 'clear', 'intention', 'retire', 'sweet', 'early', 'moments', 'Anita', 'entering', 'gentle', 'banter', 'scene', 'where', 'Ed', 'intent', 'leave', 'audience', 'swallowing', 'little', 'lump', 'throat', 'last', 'glimpse', 'packing', 'up', 'desk', 'taking', 'one', 'final', 'look', 'precinct', 'making', 'sober', 'exit', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'imprinted', 'minds', 'fans', 'years', 'come', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'significant', 'departure', 'history', 'series.In', 'summary', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'scripts', 'season', 'are', 'also', 'weak', 'even', 'boring', 'ones', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'fourteenth', 'season', 'cast', ""n't"", 'gel', 'way', 'once', 'did', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'reluctant', 'buy', 'individual', 'seasons', 'L', 'O', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'sometime', 'future', 'probably', 'late', 'year', 'just', 'time', 'Christmas', 'being', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'collector', 'set', 'first', 'golden', 'years', 'L', 'O', 'included', 'later', 'seasons', 'just', 'continuing', 'be', 'sold', 'individual', 'season', 'DVD', 'sets']",N/A
830891,A1MVLC8E5WJDD3,B0002CX21K,C. Boerger,"[6, 8]","Dick Wolf's Law & Order is one of the miracles of television: a show that is intelligent, informative, thought-provoking, well-written and well-acted, a show that has gone through numerous cast changes over the years, a show that has adhered to a rigid formula for most of its lifespan, a show that has survived numerous lesser spinoffs, and, despite all that, has been the best series on television for the last sixteen years. How does Mr. Wolf pull it off? He surrounds himself with talented people I suppose; other than that, I have no idea. But I'm eternally grateful that he does pull it off.I don't agree with all the naysayers who claim that Law & Order has dropped in quality over the years. Hey, I only started watching four or five years ago, so I didn't even become addicted to the show until after its so-called decline. I have managed to watch the earlier seasons on DVD. They're great. So are the new seasons. Where is the problem? I think most of the complaints stem from a preference for certain cast members, certain characters, but this argument is practically irrelevant since Law & Order is more about the writing, the stories than it is about the individual people, and the stories are as strong as ever. Besides, the most important character is still around; that character is the city of New York, where Law & Order is filmed, and it continues to provide the series' life's blood no matter which detectives are roaming the streets or which prosecutors are stalking the courtroom.I would stack the fourteenth year against almost any other season I have seen. Like all the seasons, it is filled with great episodes that reflect the time period in which they were produced. For instance, Embedded, City Hall and Veteran's Day are quality slices of post-9/11 and Iraq War anxiety. The mob-oriented Payback, Nowhere Man and Everybody Loves Raimondo's are perhaps inspired by the popularity of the Sopranos. Blaze recalls the Rhode Island bar fire. People who complain about the ""ripped from the headlines"" sensationalism need to rewatch the first season, because the series has always been this way. That is one of its strengths, it turns each season of Law & Order into a sort of time capsule, a walk down memory lane. Okay, occasionally the writers throw in gratuitous allusions, such as in the episode Vendetta, which begins with the murder of a man who caught a foul ball and kept his team from winning the Pennant, a circumstance that has little bearing on the rest of the story. But Vendetta, despite its false start,is an intriguing episode anyway. That's the mark of a great show: even when flawed, it still manages to entertain.The best episode from this set is probably City Hall, but season fourteen is full of classics, such as Gaijin, Darwinian, Veteran's Day and Bodies, to name a few. The only dud is Caviar Emptor, that rarest of things, a genuinely boring Law & Order episode.In this age of TV shows chockful of hipper-than-thou smart alecks spouting off dialogue that is more a reflection of the writers trying to prove how clever they are than of realistic patterns of speech, a show such as Law & Order is refreshing. Law & Order doesn't try to be cool, it just tries to be good, and succeeds tremendously.",5,Quality TV is not an oxymoron,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,3244,"['Dick', 'Wolf', 'Law', 'Order', 'one', 'miracles', 'television', 'show', 'intelligent', 'informative', 'thought-provoking', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'show', 'gone', 'numerous', 'cast', 'changes', 'years', 'show', 'adhered', 'rigid', 'formula', 'most', 'lifespan', 'show', 'survived', 'numerous', 'lesser', 'spinoffs', 'been', 'best', 'series', 'television', 'last', 'sixteen', 'years', 'How', 'Mr.', 'Wolf', 'off', 'talented', 'people', 'suppose', 'other', 'have', 'idea', ""'m"", 'eternally', 'grateful', 'pull', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'naysayers', 'who', 'claim', 'Law', 'Order', 'dropped', 'quality', 'years', 'Hey', 'only', 'started', 'watching', 'four', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'become', 'addicted', 'show', 'so-called', 'decline', 'have', 'managed', 'watch', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'great', 'are', 'new', 'seasons', 'Where', 'problem', 'think', 'most', 'complaints', 'stem', 'preference', 'certain', 'cast', 'members', 'certain', 'characters', 'argument', 'practically', 'irrelevant', 'Law', 'Order', 'more', 'writing', 'stories', 'individual', 'people', 'stories', 'are', 'as', 'strong', 'ever', 'Besides', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'still', 'around', 'character', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'Law', 'Order', 'filmed', 'provide', 'series', 'life', 'blood', 'matter', 'detectives', 'are', 'roaming', 'streets', 'prosecutors', 'are', 'stalking', 'courtroom.I', 'would', 'stack', 'fourteenth', 'year', 'almost', 'other', 'season', 'have', 'seen', 'seasons', 'filled', 'great', 'episodes', 'reflect', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'produced', 'instance', 'Embedded', 'City', 'Hall', 'Veteran', 'Day', 'are', 'quality', 'slices', 'post-9/11', 'Iraq', 'War', 'anxiety', 'mob-oriented', 'Payback', 'Nowhere', 'Man', 'Everybody', 'Loves', 'Raimondo', 'are', 'perhaps', 'inspired', 'popularity', 'Sopranos', 'Blaze', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'bar', 'fire', 'People', 'who', 'complain', 'ripped', 'headlines', 'sensationalism', 'need', 'rewatch', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'always', 'been', 'way', 'one', 'strengths', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'sort', 'time', 'capsule', 'walk', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'Okay', 'occasionally', 'writers', 'throw', 'gratuitous', 'allusions', 'such', 'episode', 'Vendetta', 'murder', 'man', 'who', 'caught', 'foul', 'ball', 'kept', 'team', 'winning', 'Pennant', 'circumstance', 'little', 'bearing', 'rest', 'story', 'Vendetta', 'false', 'start', 'intriguing', 'episode', 'anyway', 'mark', 'great', 'show', 'even', 'when', 'flawed', 'still', 'entertain.The', 'best', 'episode', 'set', 'probably', 'City', 'Hall', 'season', 'fourteen', 'full', 'classics', 'such', 'Gaijin', 'Darwinian', 'Veteran', 'Day', 'Bodies', 'name', 'few', 'only', 'dud', 'Caviar', 'Emptor', 'rarest', 'things', 'genuinely', 'boring', 'Law', 'Order', 'age', 'TV', 'shows', 'chockful', 'hipper-than-thou', 'smart', 'alecks', 'spouting', 'off', 'dialogue', 'more', 'reflection', 'writers', 'trying', 'prove', 'how', 'clever', 'are', 'realistic', 'patterns', 'speech', 'show', 'such', 'Law', 'Order', 'refreshing', 'Law', 'Order', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'cool', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'tremendously']",N/A

830901,A3R56AWX8PRQLP,B0002CX21K,Indy Reviewer,"[90, 108]","As a fairly serious Law and Order fan, I do not two star the fourteenth season of Law and Order lightly.  (Read my 5 star reviews of the early seasons if you don't believe me.)  Unfortunately the DVD version of this season is really not worth buying unless you simply can't wait.  At best this would have been 4 stars given the plot writing has gone downhill, but what really irks me are the lack of special features and even lack of certain scenes (costing another star) and the fact that there was no real reason to release this year in anything less than the eye-candy high definition it was broadcast in (costing yet another).  If you aren't planning on upgrading to HD for several years and are a true L&O; junkie, this might still be worth a buy; otherwise, wait.There's been a lot said about how recent seasons of Law and Order have ""jumped the shark"" and to some extent I agree.  It is still better than many shows on television, but in general only a precious few episodes live up to the quality of the glory years from seasons 3 to 9 or so.  Some point to the cast, although in fairness watching the end of season 15 with Annie Parisse flatlining scenes should make most reconsider if Elisabeth Rohm really was that bad of an actress.  (While she wasn't great, in fairness she had a very tough comp following Angie Harmon, who was just as stunningly beautiful but surprised everyone by arching her eyebrows and drawling her lines out in a way that took over scenes from even Sam Waterston.)  To me, its just that the actors don't have a lot to work with as the writing has become incredibly predictable.  (If you don't think Jesse Martin can act, watch him shine in Christmas Carol; he might not be Chris Noth but he doesn't have Noth's lines either.)  After 300 episodes, there are a lot of 'new' episodes that are rehashes of older ones, and the quick turnaround by the writers once they get fresh material from the ripped-from-the-headline stories (in this set, Bounty, Blaze, Darwinian, Hands Free, Evil Breeds among others) means you know you're going to get some stupid error by the cops or the ADA to throw the story off just enough so that NBC doesn't get sued.  That's not to say that there aren't a few well written episodes in season 14.  Gaijin has a very nasty and in charge DA, Embedded has some unusual plot twists, and Identity takes a plausable current crime (identity theft) and turns it into a pretty compelling case.  It's just in general writing in the earlier years was better, so this was 4 stars at best even if the set was perfect.It's not.  I was equally disturbed to discover the New Yorkerish cartoon presented to Briscoe at the end of the series wasn't in the episode.  (I haven't found anything else but I'm looking.)  Moreover, the special features that you'd buy a DVD set for here are again lacking.  Season 3 did a far better job of extras, finally including several deleted scenes.  The combination of lack of extras and the missing scene is unacceptable and costs another star.Finally, this season was broadcast in glorious high definition and DVDs can't hold HD programming - meaning the DVDs will be obsolete in a year at most.  (In fact, as TNTHD mercifully switched over to displaying HD-shot L&O; reruns in true HD last month, it's obsolete now if you have a DVHS recorder and can archive them.)  Once next-generation Blu-Ray and HD-DVDs hit the market in late 2005/early 2006, you should be able to buy a dual format disc that contains both DVD and high-def versions meaning it is a better value even if you haven't yet upgraded.  Law and Order has been shot in 16:9 film since at least 1997 (meaning it can and is being converted to HD-quality for reruns), so there's no reason to buy any L&O; set on DVD past season 8 as the primary reason to buy them - better picture quality than broadcast TV - doesn't apply.  Another star off for the value proposition from this as there's no reason Universal shouldn't have just waited 18 months rather than put out a set with a miniscule shelf life.Still, if you're a L&O; junkie, this will hit your fix, and there are a few good episodes in this season.  You're better off waiting until this season shows up on HD-capable discs, however, or buying this used for cheap once they become available.",2,"Scene cuts unacceptable, and you're better off buying next year in HD",1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,4289,"['fairly', 'serious', 'Law', 'Order', 'fan', 'do', 'not', 'two', 'star', 'fourteenth', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'lightly', 'Read', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'early', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'version', 'season', 'really', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'best', 'would', 'have', 'been', '4', 'stars', 'given', 'plot', 'writing', 'gone', 'downhill', 'what', 'really', 'irks', 'are', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'even', 'lack', 'certain', 'scenes', 'costing', 'star', 'fact', 'was', 'real', 'reason', 'release', 'year', 'anything', 'less', 'eye-candy', 'high', 'definition', 'was', 'broadcast', 'costing', 'yet', 'are', ""n't"", 'planning', 'upgrading', 'HD', 'several', 'years', 'are', 'true', 'L', 'O', 'junkie', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'buy', 'otherwise', 'been', 'lot', 'said', 'how', 'recent', 'seasons', 'Law', 'Order', 'have', 'jumped', 'shark', 'extent', 'agree', 'still', 'better', 'many', 'shows', 'television', 'general', 'only', 'precious', 'few', 'episodes', 'live', 'up', 'quality', 'glory', 'years', 'seasons', '3', '9', 'so', 'point', 'cast', 'fairness', 'watching', 'end', 'season', '15', 'Annie', 'Parisse', 'flatlining', 'scenes', 'should', 'make', 'most', 'reconsider', 'Elisabeth', 'Rohm', 'really', 'was', 'bad', 'actress', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'fairness', 'had', 'very', 'tough', 'comp', 'following', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'surprised', 'everyone', 'arching', 'eyebrows', 'drawling', 'lines', 'out', 'way', 'took', 'over', 'scenes', 'even', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'just', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'work', 'writing', 'become', 'incredibly', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Jesse', 'Martin', 'can', 'act', 'watch', 'shine', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'Chris', 'Noth', ""n't"", 'have', 'Noth', 'lines', '300', 'episodes', 'are', 'lot', ""'new"", 'episodes', 'are', 'rehashes', 'older', 'ones', 'quick', 'turnaround', 'writers', 'once', 'get', 'fresh', 'material', 'ripped-from-the-headline', 'stories', 'set', 'Bounty', 'Blaze', 'Darwinian', 'Hands', 'Free', 'Evil', 'Breeds', 'others', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'stupid', 'error', 'cops', 'ADA', 'throw', 'story', 'off', 'just', 'enough', 'so', 'NBC', ""n't"", 'get', 'sued', 'not', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'few', 'well', 'written', 'episodes', 'season', '14', 'Gaijin', 'very', 'nasty', 'charge', 'DA', 'Embedded', 'unusual', 'plot', 'twists', 'Identity', 'plausable', 'current', 'crime', 'identity', 'theft', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'case', 'just', 'general', 'writing', 'earlier', 'years', 'was', 'better', 'was', '4', 'stars', 'best', 'even', 'set', 'was', 'perfect.It', 'not', 'was', 'equally', 'disturbed', 'discover', 'New', 'Yorkerish', 'cartoon', 'presented', 'Briscoe', 'end', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'episode', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'anything', 'else', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Moreover', 'special', 'features', ""'d"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'here', 'are', 'again', 'lacking', 'Season', '3', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'extras', 'finally', 'including', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'combination', 'lack', 'extras', 'missing', 'scene', 'unacceptable', 'star.Finally', 'season', 'was', 'broadcast', 'glorious', 'high', 'definition', 'DVDs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'HD', 'programming', 'meaning', 'DVDs', 'will', 'be', 'obsolete', 'year', 'most', 'fact', 'TNTHD', 'mercifully', 'switched', 'displaying', 'HD-shot', 'L', 'O', 'reruns', 'true', 'HD', 'last', 'month', 'obsolete', 'now', 'have', 'DVHS', 'recorder', 'can', 'archive', 'Once', 'next-generation', 'Blu-Ray', 'HD-DVDs', 'hit', 'market', 'late', '2005/early', '2006', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'dual', 'format', 'disc', 'DVD', 'high-def', 'versions', 'meaning', 'better', 'value', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'upgraded', 'Law', 'Order', 'been', 'shot', '16:9', 'film', 'least', '1997', 'meaning', 'can', 'being', 'converted', 'HD-quality', 'reruns', 'reason', 'buy', 'L', 'O', 'set', 'DVD', 'season', '8', 'primary', 'reason', 'buy', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'broadcast', 'TV', ""n't"", 'apply', 'star', 'value', 'proposition', 'reason', 'Universal', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'waited', '18', 'months', 'rather', 'put', 'out', 'set', 'miniscule', 'shelf', 'life.Still', ""'re"", 'L', 'O', 'junkie', 'will', 'hit', 'fix', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'waiting', 'season', 'up', 'HD-capable', 'discs', 'however', 'buying', 'used', 'cheap', 'once', 'become', 'available']",N/A

It was really 7 stars talking about the firat three seasons.Then when Special Victims Unit Season One came out on DVD, they showed an episode whose second part was part of Law & Order Season 10.  They should have added it as a bonus to that set instead of making us wait.  Now that they are releasing the series out of order, who knows when that episode will be available?  That's an awfully long time between cliffhangers!I personally believe the early seasons of the series were the best.  Michael Moriarity's character and his sense of fairness have it all over that sleazy Sam Waresron character, who should have left the series ages ago.

I really miss him and his beloved character, Lennie Briscoe (with witty asides such as ""I guess I missed that day on Sesame Street."").  Sam Waterston and Jesse L Martin are excellent actors for their roles. Most everyone bashes Elisabeth Rohm, for her monotone voice among other things, but she didn't seem so bad. Not everyone can talk with the ""right"" amount of feeling, whatever that is.The only fault I find with this show is that it gives false hopes to the viewing public - that 85% of murderers/rapists/etc. will be found guilty and punished accordingly. McCoy seems to win a disproportionate number of cases; if DA's really won so many, the streets would be much safer, especially without repeat offenders roaming around. And I think this is one of the many reasons that people love crime dramas - the bad guys are caught, good triumphs over evil.  We want to see justice, even if it's only on TV (often, TV is the only place where we'll see it, anyway).Real courts are not nearly as tough on criminals, and criminals have far too many rights. Confessions are often suppressed for pathetic reasons: in ""Ghost"" (2005), the episode in which the JonBenet Ramsey case was ripped from the headlines, the prisoner that heard the suspect's confession was protected from testifying because he was a ""Muslim cleric""!  ""Makes me want to accidentally discharge my weapon,"" as Briscoe would say.Watching justice served on L & O is a comfort, even though it's fictional.  At least we can imagine that those sick, evil villains are getting what they deserve in the real world too, that they share the same fate, even though we know that they'll be out in 5 years, ready to kill again.  It makes me depressed and angry.  Why can't our courts be more just?  Why can't rapists be put away for life so they don't get out on parole and rape again (as has recently happened in Philly)?  Why is the death penalty considered cruel and unusual when the actual murders are even more so?  Why do juries often care more about the criminal than the victim?In the case of famous criminals, Briscoe's right on target: ""Juries love ball players. I mean, you saw what happened with O.J.""  [And yet Mel Gibson gets hauled over the burning goals for one racist remark.]Wonderful, wonderful show. I could spend a whole day watching back to back episodes (and I have).

This fourteenth season once again demonstrates the show's timeliness in pulling stories from the headlines to create aborbing tales of crime and punishment.The law isn't always upheld, though, as in several episodes the criminal gets off.  But the stories are gripping, but not as much so as previous seasons.  Orbach is fine, but Jesse L. Martin is a little cliche, and S. Epatha Merkkeson (sp) isn't given a lot to do.  Sam Waterston, Elizabeth Rohm and Fred Dalton Thompson are okay, but they don't have the same effect as Michael Moriarty and the earlier prosecutors.But the show is still on the air and darned good entertainment.",4,GOODBYE TO JERRY,1173398400,"03 9, 2007",2007,739,"['late', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'bid', 'farewell', 'long-running', 'stint', 'phenomenally', 'successful', 'franchise', 'fourteenth', 'season', 'once', 'again', 'show', 'timeliness', 'pulling', 'stories', 'headlines', 'create', 'aborbing', 'tales', 'crime', 'punishment.The', 'law', ""n't"", 'always', 'upheld', 'though', 'several', 'episodes', 'criminal', 'off', 'stories', 'are', 'gripping', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Orbach', 'fine', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'little', 'cliche', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkkeson', 'sp', ""n't"", 'given', 'lot', 'do', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Elizabeth', 'Rohm', 'Fred', 'Dalton', 'Thompson', 'are', 'okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'earlier', 'show', 'still', 'air', 'darned', 'good', 'entertainment']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[20, 32]","The fourteenth season of Law & Order, and final for the late Jerry Orbach, is, as you can probably guess by now, hardly the best the long running series has to offer.  The main highlight of season 14 is that these are Jerry Orbach's final performances.  Since season three onwards, Orbach has been the face of Law & Order, and the show greatly suffers today without him.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, Elisabeth Rohm's acting skills aren't anything to write home about.  She's mouth wateringly gorgeous, but she's not the only one who sounds like she's reading off a teleprompter.  More than half of the guest stars featured in these episodes display horrible acting, but this season isn't as bad as many reviewers are making it out to be.  Jesse L. Martin is no Chris Noth, but he's better than Benjamin Bratt.  And while longtime vet Sam Waterston may not be as good as Michael Moriarty, his performances carry most of the episodes here.  All in all, the fourteenth season of Law & Order may not be anything special, but it's hardly as bad as many are saying it is.  Now maybe Universal will finally get around to releasing season three on DVD.",3,Half decent at best,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,1154,"['fourteenth', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'final', 'late', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'now', 'hardly', 'best', 'long', 'running', 'series', 'offer', 'main', 'highlight', 'season', '14', 'are', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'final', 'performances', 'season', 'three', 'onwards', 'Orbach', 'been', 'face', 'Law', 'Order', 'show', 'greatly', 'today', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Elisabeth', 'Rohm', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'mouth', 'wateringly', 'gorgeous', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'reading', 'off', 'teleprompter', 'More', 'half', 'guest', 'stars', 'featured', 'episodes', 'display', 'horrible', 'acting', 'season', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'making', 'be', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'better', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'longtime', 'vet', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'performances', 'carry', 'most', 'episodes', 'here', 'fourteenth', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'special', 'hardly', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'are', 'saying', 'Now', 'maybe', 'Universal', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'releasing', 'season', 'three', 'DVD']",N/A

Some of the plots are more complex than the usual fare, perhaps better suited to a two-part episode than being crammed into one hour. This season marks the end of Jerry Ohrbach's long run as Det. Lennie Brisco. Perhaps in acknowledgement of that, it seemed to me that he was given far more wisecracks all season than in previous years. Is it worth watching? Yes, I'd recommend it.

Isn't that an oxymoron? i understand their trying to say that no matter the reason crime doesn't pay.thats all well and dandy but i think they over did it.This show is getting ridiculous. Since Fred Thompson joined the cast the writers have taken a conservative view on almost every issue. The juries even deliver conservative verdicts in Liberal Manhattan. There is no way that guy could get away with killing, KILLING, an anti-war protester in Manhattan. And the last line about how liberals hate getting involved with government was absurd. They are in Manhattan! What is going on with this show? I remember when the show convicted Gun Manufacturors but then had the judge overturn the verdict. That made sense, a Manhattan jury finding the Gun industry guilty. You would think that Manhattan was a conservative place. How could someone like Arthur Branch even get elected in Manhattan?also i noticed the reason why it has the scooby doo plot is because they have nothing else to offer in the variety department.because we all know that whom ever they suspect of killing said victim is more than likely gonna be found guilty anyway.so its not really about guilt or innocense,but who is the suspect.somebody tried to make the argument that its not about weather or not the defendant is guilty.but how the prosecution gets him/her.sometime bending the law to get what they want.but the defense attorneys are patrayed as monsters.i would love to see a nuetral court show and i thought trial by jury was that show but MAN WAS I WRONG LOL having said that i do miss the jury now.",2,one sided mellow drama,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,2898,"['know', 'law', 'order', 'reminds', 'cop', 'drama', 'called', 'hunter', 'starring', 'fred', 'dryer.you', 'know', 'how', 'hunter', 'shot', 'killed', 'virtually', 'EVERY', 'criminal', 'duel', 'sorts', 'when', 'camed', 'contact', 'well', 'law', 'order', 'instead', 'ending', 'shoot', 'court', 'room', 'where', 'prosecuters', 'win', '98', '%', 'cases.just', 'hunter', 'prevailed', 'most', 'shoot', 'outs.now', 'having', 'said', 'law', 'order', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'balanced.but', 'oj', 'trial', 'changes.the', 'prosecuters', 'now', 'seem', 'products', 'writers', 'producers', 'whom', 'still', 'havent', 'got', 'oj', 'trai', 'prosecuters', 'are', 'now', 'invincible.thus', 'killing', 'realisim', 'show', 'had.people', 'reason', 'calling', 'show', 'correct.well', 'see', 'problem', 'show', 'treats', 'minorities', 'race/gender', 'card', 'playing', 'oportunist', 'sociopaths.and', 'when', 'do', 'deal', 'racisim', 'more', 'episode', 'where', 'end', 'cab', 'black', 'man', 'business', 'suit', 'pick', 'up', 'McCoy', 'instead.THEN', 'start', 'reflecting', 'time', 'too', 'late', 'cause', 'show', 'with.and', 'course', 'guy', 'prosecuted', 'episode', 'was', 'course', 'angry', 'race', 'card', 'playing', 'Waterson', 'character', 'started', 'out', 'well', 'then', 'turned', 'politically', 'correct', 'proto-fascist', ""n't"", 'oxymoron', 'i', 'understand', 'trying', 'say', 'matter', 'reason', 'crime', ""n't"", 'pay.thats', 'well', 'dandy', 'i', 'think', 'did', 'it.This', 'show', 'getting', 'ridiculous', 'Fred', 'Thompson', 'joined', 'cast', 'writers', 'have', 'taken', 'conservative', 'view', 'almost', 'issue', 'juries', 'even', 'deliver', 'conservative', 'verdicts', 'Liberal', 'Manhattan', 'way', 'guy', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'killing', 'KILLING', 'anti-war', 'protester', 'Manhattan', 'last', 'line', 'how', 'liberals', 'hate', 'getting', 'involved', 'government', 'was', 'absurd', 'are', 'Manhattan', 'What', 'going', 'show', 'remember', 'when', 'show', 'convicted', 'Gun', 'Manufacturors', 'then', 'had', 'judge', 'overturn', 'verdict', 'made', 'sense', 'Manhattan', 'jury', 'finding', 'Gun', 'industry', 'guilty', 'would', 'think', 'Manhattan', 'was', 'conservative', 'place', 'How', 'could', 'someone', 'Arthur', 'Branch', 'even', 'get', 'elected', 'Manhattan', 'also', 'i', 'noticed', 'reason', 'why', 'scooby', 'doo', 'plot', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'offer', 'variety', 'know', 'whom', 'ever', 'suspect', 'killing', 'said', 'victim', 'more', 'likely', 'gon', 'be', 'found', 'guilty', 'anyway.so', 'not', 'really', 'guilt', 'innocense', 'who', 'suspect.somebody', 'tried', 'make', 'argument', 'not', 'weather', 'not', 'defendant', 'guilty.but', 'how', 'prosecution', 'him/her.sometime', 'bending', 'law', 'get', 'what', 'want.but', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'are', 'patrayed', 'monsters.i', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'nuetral', 'court', 'show', 'i', 'thought', 'trial', 'jury', 'was', 'show', 'MAN', 'WAS', 'WRONG', 'LOL', 'having', 'said', 'i', 'do', 'miss', 'jury', 'now']",N/A
