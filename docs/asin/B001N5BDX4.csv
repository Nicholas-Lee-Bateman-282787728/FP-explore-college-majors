I don't remember seeing any trailers for it on tv or in theaters but knew I had to own it after watching it. I looked for it in local stores but never found a copy so I broke down and finally ordered it. The plot is amazing and leaves no questions or loops holes at the end. Also it wasn't easy to see though the plot. Sometimes suspense movies like this don't have a deep enough plot line and the ending is figured out fairly quickly. I really liked this movie and have recommended it to some friends of mine.

How many film makers are so talented they can cover all the main bases in production? That's the case here and it hurt the overall outcome.Here's the scoop. A female Native American lawyer from the Dakotas, now living in Denver, has just prosecuted and won a case where a juvenile was charged and convicted, as an adult, for murder. The young boy was subsequently killed in an escape attempt. She now heads back home to the reservation to see her dad who is on his death bed. An unsolved mystery lingers in regard to the whereabouts and well being of her brother who has had a troubled past. Strange things begin to happen around the house that lead her to question both her place in the Native American community as well as help answer recent and past questions.This has a lot of good things going for it. The viewer gets a good taste of the culture and mysticism in the Native American community. How time doesn't exist. Past present and future flow together and imprints of things and events are left in the earth and sky. It shows the resemblance to the African American community in regard to their current troubles. As our heroine, Shayla, notes: Yes the white man done us wrong but we cannot blame him for the pain we are inflicting on ourselves now. She wants out. She has a white boyfriend with political aspirations and no longer lives with her people on the reservation where she could be doing a lot of good. Now she's back and there are portents. A horse from a neighbor's ranch keeps showing up. A wolf, who may or may not be real, seems to want to show her something. She hears things and has visions. They lead her to answers and a realization of what she should be doing in her life.This is a well intentioned but less than solid effort. As I mentioned in the opening, Mike Linn wore too many hats. Director, writer, producer, music score and editor is too much to expect one person to handle well. He should have delegated some of those tasks to those better suited for them. He did everything Okay, so he ended up with an Okay movie. Some of the writing was too pointed and sincere. It needed more flavor. There was too much focus on the story and not enough on the atmosphere. It was totally devoid of humor so there was nothing to relieve the darkness of it all. And though this is more a mystery thriller than a horror movie there were some cheap horror movie scares. One scene, involving spirit imprints, was almost painful to watch it was so ill conceived. He also needed to coax better performances from the actors. Like everything else, they were just Okay.This is not a bad watch and it gave me much food for thought. It just needed punching up on pretty much evey end. I hope Mike Linn watches this a thousand times so he doesn't make the same mistakes on his next effort.",3,Noble Effort,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,2882,"[""'m"", 'always', 'bit', 'leery', 'when', 'see', 'given', 'name', 'hogging', 'credits', 'film', 'How', 'many', 'film', 'makers', 'are', 'so', 'talented', 'can', 'cover', 'main', 'bases', 'production', 'case', 'here', 'hurt', 'overall', 'scoop', 'female', 'Native', 'American', 'lawyer', 'Dakotas', 'now', 'living', 'Denver', 'just', 'prosecuted', 'won', 'case', 'where', 'juvenile', 'was', 'charged', 'convicted', 'adult', 'murder', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'subsequently', 'killed', 'escape', 'attempt', 'now', 'back', 'home', 'reservation', 'see', 'dad', 'who', 'death', 'bed', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'lingers', 'regard', 'whereabouts', 'well', 'being', 'brother', 'who', 'had', 'troubled', 'past', 'Strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'house', 'lead', 'question', 'place', 'Native', 'American', 'community', 'as', 'well', 'help', 'answer', 'recent', 'past', 'questions.This', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'going', 'viewer', 'good', 'taste', 'culture', 'mysticism', 'Native', 'American', 'community', 'How', 'time', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Past', 'present', 'future', 'flow', 'together', 'imprints', 'things', 'events', 'are', 'left', 'earth', 'sky', 'resemblance', 'African', 'American', 'community', 'regard', 'current', 'troubles', 'heroine', 'Shayla', 'Yes', 'white', 'man', 'done', 'wrong', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'pain', 'are', 'inflicting', 'ourselves', 'now', 'out', 'white', 'boyfriend', 'political', 'aspirations', 'longer', 'people', 'reservation', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'doing', 'lot', 'good', 'Now', 'back', 'are', 'portents', 'horse', 'neighbor', 'ranch', 'keeps', 'showing', 'up', 'wolf', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'real', 'want', 'show', 'something', 'things', 'visions', 'lead', 'answers', 'realization', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'life.This', 'well', 'intentioned', 'less', 'solid', 'effort', 'mentioned', 'opening', 'Mike', 'Linn', 'wore', 'too', 'many', 'hats', 'Director', 'writer', 'producer', 'music', 'score', 'editor', 'too', 'much', 'expect', 'one', 'person', 'handle', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'delegated', 'tasks', 'better', 'suited', 'did', 'everything', 'Okay', 'ended', 'up', 'Okay', 'movie', 'writing', 'was', 'too', 'pointed', 'sincere', 'needed', 'more', 'flavor', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'story', 'not', 'enough', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'totally', 'devoid', 'humor', 'was', 'nothing', 'relieve', 'darkness', 'more', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'horror', 'movie', 'were', 'cheap', 'horror', 'movie', 'scares', 'One', 'scene', 'involving', 'spirit', 'imprints', 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'was', 'so', 'ill', 'conceived', 'also', 'needed', 'coax', 'better', 'performances', 'actors', 'everything', 'else', 'were', 'just', 'Okay.This', 'not', 'bad', 'watch', 'gave', 'much', 'food', 'thought', 'just', 'needed', 'punching', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'evey', 'end', 'hope', 'Mike', 'Linn', 'thousand', 'times', 'so', ""n't"", 'make', 'same', 'mistakes', 'next', 'effort']",Imprint

1219083,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001N5BDX4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Imprint (Michael Linn, 2007)Imprint is one of a handful of movies that have historically made it to my Netflix instant list by mistake--I thought it was another movie of the same name, rated it, couldn't figure out (hey, I was new to Netflix streaming at the time) how to unrate it, and so figured I'd watch it instead. (If you know me, you'll know that the movie I mistook it for was Takashi Miike's infamous Masters of Horror entry of the same name). In other words, I would probably have never found this movie except by accident. I'm glad I did.Plot: Shayla Stonefeather (Unearthed's Tonantizin Carmelo) has worked hard to leave her past on the rez behind, and she's now a successful prosecuting attorney in Colorado. She's got to tread lightly as the movie opens, however; she's prosecuting Robbie Whiteshirt (Joseph Medicine Blanket in his only screen appearance to date), a Lakota Indian from her reservation who has never once wavered in proclaiming his innocence. Rumors and allegations of conflict of interest abound from both sides. In the middle of the trial, Stonefeather gets word that her father is dying, and returns to the reservation to say goodbye. While she's there, Robbie Whiteshirt is murdered, and something seems to be reaching out from the spirit world to let Stonefeather know that she is more involved in this case--and rez life--than she thinks, or than she wants to remember.It's a low-budget indie flick, so if you go into it expecting some sort of Michael Bay cheesefest, you're bound to be disappointed. But take the movie on its own terms and it has some goods to offer, though it's not the best movie you will see in any given month. The plot is well-presented and believable enough if you believe in the spiritual-realm stuff, the acting is about baseline for a movie of this variety (in other words, I'm not going to count points off for, shall we say, some overly-enthusiastic amateurism), and Linn (Into His Arms) has a pretty good idea of what to do with a camera to get the mood and atmosphere he desires. No, the special effects aren't the greatest, but they show an inventiveness with a minuscule budget that has to be respected. This is not a bad little movie at all--give it a look. ***",3,Not a bad little indie effort.,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,2231,"['Imprint', 'Michael', 'Linn', '2007', 'Imprint', 'one', 'handful', 'movies', 'have', 'historically', 'made', 'Netflix', 'instant', 'list', 'mistake', 'thought', 'was', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'rated', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'hey', 'was', 'new', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'time', 'how', 'unrate', 'so', 'figured', ""'d"", 'watch', 'instead', 'know', ""'ll"", 'know', 'movie', 'mistook', 'was', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'infamous', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'entry', 'same', 'name', 'other', 'words', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'movie', 'accident', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.Plot', 'Shayla', 'Stonefeather', 'Unearthed', 'Tonantizin', 'Carmelo', 'worked', 'hard', 'leave', 'past', 'rez', 'now', 'successful', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'Colorado', 'got', 'tread', 'lightly', 'movie', 'however', 'prosecuting', 'Robbie', 'Whiteshirt', 'Joseph', 'Medicine', 'Blanket', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'date', 'Lakota', 'Indian', 'reservation', 'who', 'never', 'once', 'wavered', 'proclaiming', 'innocence', 'Rumors', 'allegations', 'conflict', 'interest', 'abound', 'sides', 'middle', 'trial', 'Stonefeather', 'word', 'father', 'dying', 'returns', 'reservation', 'say', 'goodbye', 'there', 'Robbie', 'Whiteshirt', 'murdered', 'something', 'be', 'reaching', 'spirit', 'world', 'let', 'Stonefeather', 'know', 'more', 'involved', 'case', 'rez', 'life', 'remember.It', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'flick', 'so', 'go', 'expecting', 'sort', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'cheesefest', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed', 'take', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'goods', 'offer', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'given', 'month', 'plot', 'well-presented', 'believable', 'enough', 'believe', 'spiritual-realm', 'stuff', 'acting', 'baseline', 'movie', 'variety', 'other', 'words', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'count', 'points', 'shall', 'say', 'overly-enthusiastic', 'amateurism', 'Linn', 'Into', 'Arms', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'camera', 'get', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'No', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'show', 'inventiveness', 'minuscule', 'budget', 'be', 'respected', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'movie', 'give', 'look', '***']",Imprint
1219084,A2ZGHESQDCI77M,B001N5BDX4,"Shiloh True ""Rabid Reader""","[107, 109]","I have to admit, I picked this movie up as a rental, because of the lovely, mysterious artwork on the cover. There was also reference to the fact that it won 'Best Film,' at the 32nd American Indian Film Festival for 2007. I casually thought I'd give it a try, but my expectations weren't high.  At the time, I didn't know I was holding a little Indie jewel.I'm still struggling with placing this film into a genre. It's not slasher horror, because it's free of blood and guts, but it WILL frighten you, at times.  It's not just a thriller, because of the supernatural aspects.  It is also an atypical ghost story. I think it is a category of its own, encompassing a little of several genres that many of us love.  But, what makes it so interesting is the spiritual aspects, and magical realism of the Lakota, woven throughout, which culminates into a crescendo of an unexpected ending.Shayla Stonefeather (Tonantzin Carmelo) is the chief protagonist, a Native American Attorney, returning home to the reservation to visit her father, who is facing death. She is initially very ambivalent about this visit.  She has allowed herself to be removed from the traditions of her people, preferring to base her beliefs on science, rather than superstition and magic.  In 1 hour, 28 minutes, we witness all of her current and past beliefs challenged, as she begins receiving messages from the spirit world. These messages represent violence and death, but who are they intended for---and who are the intended victims.  The supporting cast, including Michael Spears (a Tribal Officer), her mother(Carla-Rae Holland) and the Medicine Man (Lakota Chief David Bald Eagle) all give top notch performances, as they assist Shayla on her journey of self discovery.I think that viewers need to keep in mind, that this movie was not high on budget and, from the extras, it was shot in just three weeks time. So, you won't get any of the heart-pounding CGI afforded major productions. But, the scenery is beautiful---the countryside, the roaming buffalo, the stalking wolf and the noble pinto horse. You will feel the splendor of S. Dakota.I applaud the producers of this movie, for giving an almost all Native American cast the opportunity to shine, in a contemporary film, minus the stereotypical images.  We could use more like these.  In fact, I can even envision a series---maybe Shayla's character teaming up with Tribal Police in solving crimes---a little romance.

You would have to be a very good clairvoyant to do so.  This story has twists and such reminiscent of the Sixth Sense.  It is worth the money and it was very well acted.  The storyline was incredible!  I would have never guessed it!  This movie is a jewel.  If you like movies such as 'The House that Mary Bought"", ""The Sixth Sense"" and anything of that nature, you will love this...Ignore the negativity put out there.  This film is worth the money spent to get the dvd.",5,This is a truly great movie!,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,551,"['what', 'reviewer', 'said', 'can', 'not', 'guess', 'ending', '10', 'seconds', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'clairvoyant', 'do', 'so', 'story', 'twists', 'such', 'reminiscent', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'money', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'storyline', 'was', 'incredible', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'guessed', 'movie', 'jewel', 'like', 'movies', 'such', ""'The"", 'House', 'Mary', 'Bought', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'anything', 'nature', 'will', 'love', 'negativity', 'put', 'out', 'there', 'film', 'money', 'spent', 'get', 'dvd']",Imprint
