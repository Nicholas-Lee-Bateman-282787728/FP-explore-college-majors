I mean, really, how may nannies fly into London with an umbrella? That doesn't make Mary Poppins a bad movie, does it? That said, this is a pretty much enjoyable movie as long as you take it for what it is, a couple of hours of entertainment and then it's over. No award winners, no big lessons learned but the scenery alone is enough to warrant watching.",3,Unbelievable but fun!,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,482,"['Suspend', 'belief', 'just', 'enjoy', 'scenery', 'animals', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'believable', 'unles', 'are', 'documentaries', 'mean', 'really', 'how', 'may', 'nannies', 'fly', 'London', 'umbrella', ""n't"", 'make', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'bad', 'movie', 'said', 'pretty', 'much', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'take', 'what', 'couple', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'then', 'over', 'award', 'winners', 'big', 'lessons', 'learned', 'scenery', 'alone', 'enough', 'warrant', 'watching']",N/A

77806,A35KD1U1M387I0,0784015007,Todd E. Newman,"[14, 14]",It's a great tale about a young boy who becomes a friendly hostage of a grizzly bear while on a bear hunting expedition with his father in the northwest.  Things go awry and the boy is taken by the bear only to be chased by his father and his team of men.  The rugged adventure is only the beginning of this entertaining and relationship bonding movie between man and animal.  It's perfect for all ages.  Kids can watch it as the movie offers good moral values without hard language or adult situations.,5,A great movie for all ages!,1019001600,"04 17, 2002",2002,503,"['great', 'tale', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'friendly', 'hostage', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'bear', 'hunting', 'expedition', 'father', 'northwest', 'Things', 'go', 'awry', 'boy', 'taken', 'bear', 'only', 'be', 'chased', 'father', 'team', 'men', 'rugged', 'adventure', 'only', 'beginning', 'entertaining', 'relationship', 'bonding', 'movie', 'man', 'animal', 'perfect', 'ages', 'Kids', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'good', 'moral', 'values', 'hard', 'language', 'adult', 'situations']",N/A
