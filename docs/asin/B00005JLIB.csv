Sporting a catchy piano-laden theme song, the series showcased the unique comic talents of co-creator and co-star Paul Reiser, who sought to produce a show telling the true story of married life (he would later publish the bestselling book Couplehood, a compilation of various anecdotes on relationships)...Mad About You follows the lives of newlywed couple Paul (Paul Reiser) and Jamie Buchman (Helen Hunt), two urban professionals sharing an apartment in New York City. Although they are head-over-heals in love, the two appear to be near total opposites. Paul, a documentary filmmaker, is extremely meticulous, cautious, and careful. Jamie, on the other hand, is a public relations expert with more of a free-spirit outlook on life. With a number of friends and family always in the picture - Jamie's sister Lisa (Anne Ramsay), Paul's cousin Ira (John Pankow), and friends Mark (Richard Kind) and Fran (Leila Kenzle) - Paul and Jamie are constantly bombarded with job-related stress, the strange antics of their friends, and the discovery each others' individual quirks and habits. And it's a recipe that translates into great sitcom entertainment...The Mad About You (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Romantic Improvisations"" in which, following a mere five months of marriage, Jamie informs Paul that their sex life in not quite what it used to be. To rectify the situation, Paul comes home early from work intent on planning a romantic evening, but everything unravels when the two discover that both of them thought the other one had cancelled their scheduled dinner plans with friends... Other notable episodes include ""Out of the Past"" in which Paul invites Jamie to a personal reunion with his ex-girlfriend, and ""Token Friend"" in which Paul avoids the subway when he discovers a former friend from film school is now a token clerk at the local station...Below is a list of episodes included on the Mad About You (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Romantic Improvisations)Episode 2 (Sofa's Choice)Episode 3 (Sunday Times)Episode 4 (Out of the Past)Episode 5 (Paul in the Family)Episode 6 (I'm Just So Happy For You)Episode 7 (Token Friend)Episode 8 (The Apartment)Episode 9 (Riding Backwards)Episode 10 (Neighbors from Hell)Episode 11 (Met Someone)Episode 12 (Maid About You)Episode 13 (Togetherness)Episode 14 (Weekend Getaway)Episode 15 (The Wedding Affair)Episode 16 (Love Among the Tiles)Episode 17 (The Billionaire)Episode 18 (The Man Who Said Hello)Episode 19 (Swept Away)Episode 20 (The Spy Who Loved Me)Episode 21 (The Painter)Episode 22 (Happy Anniversary)The DVD Report",4,One hilarious TV show...,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2848,"['Nominated', '45', 'Emmys', 'winner', '16', 'eight-year', 'run', 'NBC', 'Mad', 'became', 'instant', 'smash', 'hit', 'TV', 'viewers', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'Seinfeldian', 'portrayals', 'married', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'Sporting', 'catchy', 'piano-laden', 'theme', 'song', 'series', 'showcased', 'unique', 'comic', 'talents', 'co-creator', 'co-star', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'who', 'sought', 'produce', 'show', 'telling', 'true', 'story', 'married', 'life', 'would', 'later', 'publish', 'bestselling', 'book', 'Couplehood', 'compilation', 'various', 'anecdotes', 'relationships', 'Mad', 'lives', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'Jamie', 'Buchman', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'two', 'urban', 'professionals', 'sharing', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'are', 'head-over-heals', 'love', 'two', 'appear', 'be', 'near', 'total', 'opposites', 'Paul', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'extremely', 'meticulous', 'cautious', 'careful', 'Jamie', 'other', 'hand', 'public', 'relations', 'expert', 'more', 'free-spirit', 'outlook', 'life', 'number', 'friends', 'family', 'always', 'picture', 'Jamie', 'sister', 'Lisa', 'Anne', 'Ramsay', 'Paul', 'cousin', 'Ira', 'John', 'Pankow', 'friends', 'Mark', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'Fran', 'Leila', 'Kenzle', 'Paul', 'Jamie', 'are', 'constantly', 'bombarded', 'job-related', 'stress', 'strange', 'antics', 'friends', 'discovery', 'others', 'individual', 'quirks', 'habits', 'recipe', 'great', 'sitcom', 'entertainment', 'Mad', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Romantic', 'Improvisations', 'following', 'mere', 'five', 'months', 'marriage', 'Jamie', 'Paul', 'sex', 'life', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'rectify', 'situation', 'Paul', 'home', 'early', 'work', 'intent', 'planning', 'romantic', 'evening', 'everything', 'unravels', 'when', 'two', 'discover', 'thought', 'other', 'one', 'had', 'cancelled', 'scheduled', 'dinner', 'plans', 'friends', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'include', 'Out', 'Past', 'Paul', 'Jamie', 'personal', 'reunion', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Token', 'Friend', 'Paul', 'subway', 'when', 'former', 'friend', 'film', 'school', 'now', 'token', 'clerk', 'local', 'station', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Mad', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Romantic', 'Improvisations', 'Episode', '2', 'Sofa', 'Choice', 'Episode', '3', 'Sunday', 'Times', 'Episode', '4', 'Past', 'Episode', '5', 'Paul', 'Family', 'Episode', '6', ""'m"", 'Just', 'So', 'Happy', '7', 'Token', 'Friend', 'Episode', '8', 'Apartment', 'Episode', '9', 'Riding', 'Backwards', 'Episode', '10', 'Neighbors', 'Hell', 'Episode', '11', 'Met', 'Someone', 'Episode', '12', 'Maid', '13', 'Togetherness', 'Episode', '14', 'Weekend', 'Getaway', 'Episode', '15', 'Wedding', 'Affair', 'Episode', '16', 'Love', 'Tiles', 'Episode', '17', 'Billionaire', 'Episode', '18', 'Man', 'Who', 'Said', 'Hello', 'Episode', '19', 'Swept', 'Away', 'Episode', '20', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Loved', 'Me', 'Episode', '21', 'Painter', 'Episode', '22', 'Happy', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'Report']",Mad About You - The Complete First Season
601270,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,B00005JLIB,Carl Malmstrom,"[89, 95]","While ""Mad About You"" would go on to become one of the definitive sitcoms of the 1990s, its first season was a little rocky.  To be certain, much of the later greatness could been seen (especially at the beginning and end of the season), but rotating characters and a few truly awful episodes made for a rocky start for this series.The first season showed that Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt had great chemistry together as newlyweds Paul and Jamie Buchman, but many of their friends had difficult beginnings - especially Paul's friends Selby (who disappears by episode 13) and Ira (who appears, initially, as an even less-likeable version of the eternal bachelor Selby).  The episodes that really stand out from the season are the ones that deal with Paul and Jamie's newlywed issues - how they met, whether Paul should give up his old bachelor pad, their first anniversary - but there are also some truly unfortunate episodes from the season, especially Jerry Lewis' execrable turn as an eccentric billionaire.  Likewise, the first episode featuring Paul's father shows only a little of the depth that his family would later have.  All that aside, though, the first season is definitely strong enough to want to buy - unless, of course, you look at the discs from a technical perspective.While the price for the series is great, I would happily have seen them add another ten or twenty dollars to the price tag to have another disc.  Not only is the set devoid of any extras (save multilingual tracks), but the compression of 11 episodes on to each disc makes each look impressively bad on a laptop or HDTV system.  On a normal TV from six feet or more away, it looks fine, but I pity the person taking this set with them on an airplane flight.All in all, it'd hard not to be disappointed in this release.  I'm always glad to see more TV series released in full-season formats on DVD, but presentations such as this make you very disappointed in the companies that release them.  Maybe Columbia-Tristar will get the hint for Season 2 and put out a much better release.  It would be a shame to see them stop with this season just because they did a bad job with it technically.",3,An Awful Way To Treat a Great Show...,1035590400,"10 26, 2002",2002,2174,"['Mad', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'one', 'definitive', 'sitcoms', '1990s', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'little', 'rocky', 'be', 'certain', 'much', 'later', 'greatness', 'could', 'been', 'seen', 'especially', 'beginning', 'end', 'season', 'rotating', 'characters', 'few', 'truly', 'awful', 'episodes', 'made', 'rocky', 'start', 'series.The', 'first', 'season', 'showed', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'newlyweds', 'Paul', 'Jamie', 'Buchman', 'many', 'friends', 'had', 'difficult', 'beginnings', 'especially', 'Paul', 'friends', 'Selby', 'who', 'episode', '13', 'Ira', 'who', 'initially', 'even', 'less-likeable', 'version', 'eternal', 'bachelor', 'Selby', 'episodes', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'season', 'are', 'ones', 'deal', 'Paul', 'Jamie', 'newlywed', 'issues', 'how', 'met', 'Paul', 'should', 'give', 'up', 'old', 'bachelor', 'pad', 'first', 'anniversary', 'are', 'also', 'truly', 'unfortunate', 'episodes', 'season', 'especially', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'execrable', 'turn', 'eccentric', 'billionaire', 'Likewise', 'first', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Paul', 'father', 'only', 'little', 'depth', 'family', 'would', 'later', 'have', 'aside', 'first', 'season', 'definitely', 'strong', 'enough', 'want', 'buy', 'course', 'look', 'discs', 'technical', 'perspective.While', 'price', 'series', 'great', 'would', 'happily', 'have', 'seen', 'add', 'ten', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'price', 'tag', 'have', 'disc', 'Not', 'only', 'set', 'devoid', 'extras', 'save', 'multilingual', 'tracks', 'compression', '11', 'episodes', 'disc', 'look', 'impressively', 'bad', 'laptop', 'HDTV', 'system', 'normal', 'TV', 'six', 'feet', 'more', 'away', 'fine', 'pity', 'person', 'taking', 'set', 'airplane', 'flight.All', ""'d"", 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'release', ""'m"", 'always', 'glad', 'see', 'more', 'TV', 'series', 'released', 'full-season', 'formats', 'DVD', 'presentations', 'such', 'make', 'very', 'disappointed', 'companies', 'release', 'Maybe', 'Columbia-Tristar', 'will', 'get', 'hint', 'Season', '2', 'put', 'out', 'much', 'better', 'release', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'see', 'stop', 'season', 'just', 'did', 'bad', 'job', 'technically']",Mad About You - The Complete First Season

601291,A2RMH46E7TDI0C,B00005JLIB,"Sean Aune ""Slacker""","[18, 22]","The early years of Mad About You were some of the finest half-hour comedies around in the 1990's.  It was refreshing to see a series about a young couple who were going through the early stages of a marriage, as opposed to so many series about well-established marriages.  Paul (Paul Reiser) and Jamie (Helen Hunt) were two very well fleshed out characters that you could believe in, and more so when they went through all the little ups and downs a real life couple goes through.  (i.e. buying a couch as a couple as opposed to as single people)  And while not everything about the show was their realistic (the size of their apartment), you believed these really could be two real-life people.The fact you were watching a show about newlyweds though was reinforced even more by the other married couple on the show, Mark (Richard Kind) and Fran (Leila Kenzle).  This was your established couple.  The couple who had gotten over the initial romance of the first few years of marriage, had had a child, and were now dealing with how to keep their marriage still interesting.  Without giving away to much about the first season though, their characters probably had the most significant character arc of the first season as they end up in a much different place in their lives at the end of the season.A contrast was also added for Jamie's seeming perfection in the form of her older sister, Lisa (Anne Elizabeth Ramsay).  A serial dater with more perceived psychological problems than you could shake a stick at, she was almost like the Anti-Jamie.  She was a great character, and luckily used in moderation.  If used much more then she was, she could have quite quickly irritated the viewers.The first season was not all smooth waters though.  The character of Paul's best friend, Selby (played by Tommy Hinkley) never seemed to mix correctly with the rest of the cast, or really fulfill any purpose.  For some reason though, when they reinvented the &quot;trouble making&quot; character as Cousin Ira (John Pankow), it worked like a charm.  I hate to blame Mr. Hinkley, but you have to wonder why it didn't work.While the show is top notch, the DVD presentation leaves something to desire.  Non-existent extras is a notable flaw.  At least some commentary tracks would have been nice.  The most notable flaw though is the order of the episodes.  While episode 2 being shown as episode 4 is somewhat forgivable, the reversal of episodes 21 and 22 is not.  If you buy this set, make sure to flip the last two episodes, because as presented, the fake 21 references the fake 22 heavily.  So again, make sure to watch 22 and THEN 21.While I give the show itself 5 stars, I can only give the DVD set three.",3,A true classic of 1990's comedy,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,2702,"['early', 'years', 'Mad', 'were', 'finest', 'half-hour', 'comedies', '1990', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'series', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'were', 'going', 'early', 'stages', 'marriage', 'opposed', 'so', 'many', 'series', 'well-established', 'marriages', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'Jamie', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'were', 'two', 'very', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'could', 'believe', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'went', 'little', 'ups', 'real', 'life', 'couple', 'i.e', 'buying', 'couch', 'couple', 'opposed', 'single', 'people', 'not', 'everything', 'show', 'was', 'realistic', 'size', 'apartment', 'believed', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'two', 'real-life', 'people.The', 'fact', 'were', 'watching', 'show', 'newlyweds', 'was', 'reinforced', 'even', 'more', 'other', 'married', 'couple', 'show', 'Mark', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'Fran', 'Leila', 'Kenzle', 'was', 'established', 'couple', 'couple', 'who', 'had', 'gotten', 'initial', 'romance', 'first', 'few', 'years', 'marriage', 'had', 'had', 'child', 'were', 'now', 'dealing', 'how', 'keep', 'marriage', 'still', 'interesting', 'giving', 'away', 'much', 'first', 'season', 'characters', 'probably', 'had', 'most', 'significant', 'character', 'arc', 'first', 'season', 'end', 'up', 'much', 'different', 'place', 'lives', 'end', 'season.A', 'contrast', 'was', 'also', 'added', 'Jamie', 'seeming', 'perfection', 'form', 'older', 'sister', 'Lisa', 'Anne', 'Elizabeth', 'Ramsay', 'serial', 'dater', 'more', 'perceived', 'psychological', 'problems', 'could', 'shake', 'stick', 'was', 'almost', 'Anti-Jamie', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'luckily', 'used', 'moderation', 'used', 'much', 'more', 'then', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'quite', 'quickly', 'irritated', 'viewers.The', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'smooth', 'waters', 'character', 'Paul', 'best', 'friend', 'Selby', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Hinkley', 'never', 'seemed', 'mix', 'correctly', 'rest', 'cast', 'really', 'fulfill', 'purpose', 'reason', 'when', 'reinvented', 'quot', 'trouble', 'making', 'quot', 'character', 'Cousin', 'Ira', 'John', 'Pankow', 'worked', 'charm', 'hate', 'blame', 'Mr.', 'Hinkley', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.While', 'show', 'top', 'notch', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'something', 'desire', 'Non-existent', 'extras', 'notable', 'flaw', 'least', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'most', 'notable', 'flaw', 'though', 'order', 'episodes', 'episode', '2', 'being', 'shown', 'episode', '4', 'somewhat', 'forgivable', 'reversal', 'episodes', '21', '22', 'not', 'buy', 'set', 'make', 'sure', 'flip', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'presented', 'fake', '21', 'references', 'fake', '22', 'heavily', 'So', 'again', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', '22', 'THEN', '21.While', 'give', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'DVD', 'set', 'three']",Mad About You - The Complete First Season
