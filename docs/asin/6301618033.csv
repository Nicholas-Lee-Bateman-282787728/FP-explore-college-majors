If you enjoy revenge movies and are looking for some brain dead fun, and an excuse to look at Barbara Eden in tight clothes and short skirts, this movie is made for you.The plot is pretty simple, the local PTA decides that Stella Johnson (Barbara Eden) is dressing too sexy and acting to wild for the small town of Harper Valley.  They send home a letter to this effect with her daughter.  Stella responds by going public with the private sins of the hypocritical members of the PTA.  This makes for a cute three minute theme song, but it gets stretched a little thin for a full length movie.To fill out the remaining time, we get to watch Stella get her revenge by pulling increasingly more ridiculous (and criminal) ""practical jokes"".  These include everything from taping the sexual liaisons of an unmarried teacher with the mailman to driving elephants stolen from the local circus (and painted pink) through the home of the town drunk.  When none of that proves to be enough to fill-up the minutes remaining in the movie, we get a new plot involving Stella running for PTA president and the current PTA president having people kidnapped and the school robbed to stop her.Barbara Eden is easy on the eyes.  The rest of the movie ranges from painfully dumb to pretty funny.  If you can suspend your disbelief (and your ability to think critically) you can have some fun watching this movie.",3,Not intellectually stimulating . . .,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,1466,"['are', 'looking', 'intelligent', 'entertainment', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'revenge', 'movies', 'are', 'looking', 'brain', 'dead', 'fun', 'excuse', 'look', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'tight', 'clothes', 'short', 'skirts', 'movie', 'made', 'you.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'simple', 'local', 'PTA', 'Stella', 'Johnson', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'dressing', 'too', 'sexy', 'acting', 'wild', 'small', 'town', 'Harper', 'Valley', 'send', 'home', 'letter', 'effect', 'daughter', 'Stella', 'going', 'public', 'private', 'sins', 'hypocritical', 'members', 'PTA', 'cute', 'three', 'minute', 'theme', 'song', 'stretched', 'little', 'thin', 'full', 'length', 'movie.To', 'fill', 'remaining', 'time', 'get', 'watch', 'Stella', 'get', 'revenge', 'pulling', 'increasingly', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'criminal', 'practical', 'jokes', 'include', 'everything', 'taping', 'sexual', 'liaisons', 'unmarried', 'teacher', 'mailman', 'driving', 'elephants', 'stolen', 'local', 'circus', 'painted', 'pink', 'home', 'town', 'drunk', 'When', 'none', 'be', 'enough', 'fill-up', 'minutes', 'remaining', 'movie', 'get', 'new', 'plot', 'involving', 'Stella', 'running', 'PTA', 'president', 'current', 'PTA', 'president', 'having', 'people', 'kidnapped', 'school', 'robbed', 'stop', 'her.Barbara', 'Eden', 'easy', 'eyes', 'rest', 'movie', 'painfully', 'dumb', 'pretty', 'funny', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'ability', 'think', 'critically', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie']",Harper Valley P.T.A.

One afternoon Stella's daughter Dee (Susan Swift) comes home from school with a letter from the secretary of the P.T.A. which threatens to expell Dee if Stella does not conform.  Stella and her wacky best friend Alice (Nanette Fabray) decide that a little revenge is on the cards...!This film is very much a one-note caper comedy, but the performances of Barbara Eden and Nanette Fabray are so wonderful that they greatly enliven the limitations of the material.

Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[1, 3]","This picture hit the theaters in 1978 starring Barbara Eden as Stella Johnson, Ronny Cox as Willis Newton and Nanette Fabray as Alice Finely. The pictured opens with the song that we come to know and hear along with a view of the school district where the whole thing gets started. As the song continues to play, they keep showing views of the school and the town. After the song is over Stella Johnson is in her house singing and dancing when her daughter Dee, comes home from school and can't even get in the front door. Therefore, Stella opens the door and Dee goes straight to her room without even speaking to her mom. Stella goes and checks on Dee and is given a letter that is address to her from the Harper Valley PTA. The letter states that if Stella doesn't change her ways they will take the proper measures to have her daughter expelled from school. Therefore, Stella and Alice sit down and have a nice long talk with Alice telling Stella every dirty secret that she has on every member of the Harper Valley PTA board. It just so happen that very afternoon the PTA was holding its annual meeting. Therefore, Stella and her daughter go to that PTA meeting and Stella was loaded with dirty secrets that were just waiting to come out. The next day when Dee comes home from school her entire front yard is covered with toilet paper. That's when Will Newton enters! Will is a construction worker who's building the schools new gym. Will helps Stella clean up her front yard and then later that night while Stella and Dee were eating someone throws a rock through the dining room window. Therefore, Stella goes to see Alice and now it's time for war with every member of the PTA. I like this movie because of the comedy and the acting of Barbara Eden. It was nice to see her in another role other then Jeanine.

I watched Jeannie whenever I could (which wasn't easy back in the day of one black and white tv with rabbit ears!).  I still remember my parents turning it off because of bad reception and I was so upset because I'd never seen the episode in question.Anyway, Barbara Eden is charming in this.  I look at the young crop of actresses today and very few of them have the charm of Barbara Eden. I personally think that  Days of Our Lives should have hired her to play ""Jo Johnson"" after Joy Garrett died - the physical resemblence is amazing, and Barbara has the same sweet vulnerability that Joy had.The movie was well acted and at times very funny... but seriously over the top with the massive felonies committed by Stella - harmful dangerous actions that could have resulted in tragedy.

Reilly, about hypocricy in a small town, inspired this film, starring Barbara Eden as the Stella Johnson, the mother who ""socked it to the Harper Valley PTA"". The first few scenes of the film follows the song very closely. After crashing the PTA meeting and exposing the hypocricy of the PTA members, the PTA doesn't exactly get nicer to her, and Stella, with the help of her friend Alice (Nanette Fabray), decide to get revenge, by playing pranks on the various PTA members. She also gets help from Willis Newton (Ronny Cox), a member of the PTA who disapprove of the way the PTA is run. He even talks her into running for president of the PTA.The story is thin but there's quite a lot of fun scenes, although the overall pace of the movie might have been a bit better if it was a little bit shorter. As it is, there are some parts where it gets a bit slow. Acting is good. Eden is a great choice for the lead role and she's also helped by a good supporting cast.

Barbara Eden, from TV's ""I Dream of Jeannie"" fame, stars as Stella, a single woman living in Harper Valley, Ohio with her daughter. The girl comes home from school one day with a letter from the local parent/teacher association stating they do not approve of Stella's lifestyle and dress code. The plot of the film starts off here as Stella seeks revenge on all the PTA members by going into their lives and revealing they are not the prim and proper individuals that they portray. The movie is based on the hit Jeannie C. Reilly song of the same name from 1968, written by ""The Storyteller"" himself, Tom T. Hall. The movie would also spawn a minor successful TV series on NBC in the early eighties that only lasted 30 episodes. ""Harper Valley PTA"" is a simple and funny comedy that everyone will enjoy. If you like seeing snotty people get their comeuppance you will enjoy this film. The best part of the movie is the famous ""hair scene"" where a high-class snob has a dinner party. Earlier in the day she had her hair done without knowing that Stella had the chemicals for the hair color tampered with. You will roar with laughter when you see what happens.The DVD, unfortunately, is barebones, and the trailer isn't even included.
