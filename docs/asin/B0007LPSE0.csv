882259,ADYRUM5DUKP70,B0007LPSE0,David Gordon,"[10, 10]","This was Robert Conrad's last series in a career spanning five decades, from Hawaiian Eye in the fifties through The Wild Wild West in the sixties and Baa Baa Black Sheep in the seventies, to a stream of TV movies and quickly canceled series in the eighties and nineties.Like the even more quickly canceled ""Jesse Hawk,"" High Sierra Search and Rescue was a family affair: Conrad and his wife, LaVelda Fann, played two of the characters, and two of his children from his first marriage produced.  The series was set and shot in their home town of Bear Valley, and included a number of locals in the cast and crew.  Only seven episodes were produced for a summer run in 1995, as a follow-up to a 1994 TV movie of the same name.Although Conrad and Dee Wallace Stone as the local grocery store owner carry the younger actors, the scenery is the real star.  A single DVD contains all seven episodes, but manages to retain a fairly good quality.  The dialog is a bit lame and plot lines insipid, but for what it is - a simple show about ordinary people in a small California town - it's actually quite good.",4,Robert Conrad's Last Hurrah,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,1101,"['was', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'last', 'series', 'career', 'spanning', 'five', 'decades', 'Hawaiian', 'Eye', 'fifties', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'sixties', 'Baa', 'Baa', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'seventies', 'stream', 'TV', 'movies', 'quickly', 'canceled', 'series', 'eighties', 'even', 'more', 'quickly', 'canceled', 'Jesse', 'Hawk', 'High', 'Sierra', 'Search', 'Rescue', 'was', 'family', 'affair', 'Conrad', 'wife', 'LaVelda', 'Fann', 'played', 'two', 'characters', 'two', 'children', 'first', 'marriage', 'produced', 'series', 'was', 'set', 'shot', 'home', 'town', 'Bear', 'Valley', 'included', 'number', 'locals', 'cast', 'crew', 'Only', 'seven', 'episodes', 'were', 'produced', 'summer', 'run', '1995', 'follow-up', '1994', 'TV', 'movie', 'same', 'name.Although', 'Conrad', 'Dee', 'Wallace', 'Stone', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'owner', 'carry', 'younger', 'actors', 'scenery', 'real', 'star', 'single', 'DVD', 'seven', 'episodes', 'retain', 'fairly', 'good', 'quality', 'dialog', 'bit', 'lame', 'plot', 'lines', 'insipid', 'what', 'simple', 'show', 'ordinary', 'people', 'small', 'California', 'town', 'actually', 'quite', 'good']",High Sierra Search and Rescue
