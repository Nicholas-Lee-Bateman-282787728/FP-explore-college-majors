276571,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301966015,Acute Observer,"[4, 16]","This English film was very successful commercially for American audiences given its story about a fashion photographer. We see a truck load of mimes running around, then a young photographer shooting a fashion model. [The pictures will be used in advertising to suggest to customers they will look like a model if they buy and use the product; the belief in magic.] The photographer's drive shows some of the new public housing, three stories high. After visiting an antique store he starts taking snapshots in a nearby park. [These areas are all strangely vacant of people.] He notices a young woman and older man in the park, by a grassy knoll, and follows to shoot them. The young woman does not want to be photographed. The photographer is interested in acquiring real estate that will quickly appreciate.When he arrives home that young woman arrives to ask for the photographs. She persists, but fail. But the photographer gives her another roll, and makes a deal. Later he develops the roll of film and inspects it, then makes a blow-up of the frames. He notices a detail in the background. Two young girls show up uninvited, and this leads to the frolic that made this film popular. Afterwards he notices a detail in one of the prints and makes an enlargement. The picture becomes clearer. He returns to the park and finds the man. [Is this possible in any public park?] When he returns home he finds all his prints have vanished, and the negatives too!On the way back he stops at a club, listens to the music, and takes a souvenir. [More senseless action.] Next he visits a party; one room is for smoking. He asks his friend to return to the park. When the photographer returns the next morning the park has been cleared, nothing remains. The truck of mimes returns to act out a game of tennis. The photographer goes to pick up an imaginary ball and throws it into the court. It seems real now. Or just imagined?Could such an aimless story become a big hit? The story about an assassination that is covered up has obvious references to the 1960s. A later film ""Blow Out"" echoes this story but has a more coherent story.",2,What Were They Thinking?,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,2127,"['English', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'successful', 'commercially', 'American', 'audiences', 'given', 'story', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'see', 'truck', 'load', 'mimes', 'running', 'around', 'then', 'young', 'photographer', 'shooting', 'fashion', 'model', '[', 'pictures', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'advertising', 'suggest', 'customers', 'will', 'look', 'model', 'buy', 'use', 'product', 'belief', 'magic', ']', 'photographer', 'drive', 'new', 'public', 'housing', 'three', 'stories', 'high', 'visiting', 'antique', 'store', 'taking', 'snapshots', 'nearby', 'park', '[', 'areas', 'are', 'strangely', 'vacant', 'people', 'young', 'woman', 'older', 'man', 'park', 'grassy', 'knoll', 'shoot', 'young', 'woman', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'photographed', 'photographer', 'interested', 'acquiring', 'real', 'estate', 'will', 'quickly', 'appreciate.When', 'home', 'young', 'woman', 'ask', 'photographs', 'fail', 'photographer', 'roll', 'deal', 'Later', 'roll', 'film', 'then', 'blow-up', 'frames', 'detail', 'background', 'Two', 'young', 'girls', 'show', 'up', 'uninvited', 'frolic', 'made', 'film', 'popular', 'Afterwards', 'detail', 'one', 'prints', 'enlargement', 'picture', 'clearer', 'park', 'man', '[', 'possible', 'public', 'park', ']', 'When', 'home', 'prints', 'have', 'vanished', 'negatives', 'too', 'way', 'back', 'club', 'music', 'souvenir', '[', 'More', 'senseless', 'action', 'Next', 'party', 'one', 'room', 'smoking', 'friend', 'return', 'park', 'When', 'photographer', 'next', 'morning', 'park', 'been', 'cleared', 'nothing', 'remains', 'truck', 'mimes', 'returns', 'act', 'out', 'game', 'tennis', 'photographer', 'pick', 'up', 'imaginary', 'ball', 'court', 'real', 'now', 'just', 'imagined', 'Could', 'aimless', 'story', 'become', 'big', 'hit', 'story', 'assassination', 'covered', 'up', 'obvious', 'references', '1960s', 'later', 'film', 'Blow', 'Out', 'story', 'more', 'coherent', 'story']",N/A

276573,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301966015,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","Michelangelo Antonioni has proved hit or miss with me.  I've seen a few of his films and have either openly LOVED them or, sadly, openly hated them (I know that hate is a strong word, so maybe I just didn't `get' them).  I am kind of somewhere in the middle when it comes to `Blow Up'.  It is a movie that is rich with meaning, but it has a hard time establishing that `meaning'.I feel that maybe the effort put in was stronger than the result.The film centers around a vain fashion photographer who, while searching to find more meaning in his work, attempts to take some candid photos for a magazine.  The photos are of a couple frolicking in an open field.  When he actually gets the chance to develop the film though, he finds that there is more to these pictures than the sweet innocence of love he initially thought he was capturing.  Instead, he slowly (and methodically) uncovers a gun and what appears to be a corpse.There are moments within `Blow Up' that seem to speak so loudly about the directors point of view and the emotional response we are supposed to carry from this film, but sometimes those moments can find themselves lost in the structure of the film.  For me, the vapid existence of the protagonist, Thomas, is the point of the whole film.  While the poignant scenes such as the zombie-like rock concert, the strangely aggressive three-way or the ambiguous `high' party are all key elements to the films unraveling, they can feel almost too abrasive and too `present'.  There are no subtleties in this film and so it comes across almost a little too blunt, to the point where it's hard to take seriously.I wouldn't be quick to say `style over substance' because there is a lot of substance here, I just feel like the style is so thick it outweighs the substance.Another little quibble I have with this film is that it feels very, very dated.  There are films that, while reflecting an era, are able to transcend all time and feel fresh and poignant even today.  For me, `Blow Up' is so much a 60's film that it lacks any feeling of relevance today.  That isn't to say that it isn't relevant (the overall message presented within Thomas's take on the murder in general is very relevant) but it is presented in a way that feels too `past' to make a real impact today.  I don't know how to really explain what I mean, and I hope that isn't coming across as self indulgent, but it was a real feeling I had while watching the film.  It just feels far too `60's'.This is coming from a guy who considers the 60's to be THE best decade for cinema.As far as performances are concerned, the only real standout is Vanessa Redgrave, who proves to be just as captivating in her early years as she is now.  She's a marvelous actress, and her ambiguous approach to her character's panic stricken conscience is rather refreshing and completely engaging.I wish she had more screen time.In the end I have to say that I appreciate the film, I just don't think it's all there.  I was expecting something totally different, something that really struck me on all levels; but it failed to do so.  I can understand the attraction, for Antonioni is a very visual director (this film is littered with marvelous screenshots) and his contrast between the glossed over fake `real world' and the gritty and almost haunting world presented in the photographs is a stellar and meaningful observation (and, in my humble opinion, that closing `mime' scene was pure genius), but if I'm being honest with myself then I must acknowledge the fact that, while it is all here, it isn't presented in the best way.  It loses a lot of its impact because Antonioni didn't feel the need to pull back the `style' so as to expose the `substance'.",3,It's all here; it's just buried a little too deep...,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,3724,"['Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'proved', 'hit', 'miss', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'openly', 'LOVED', 'sadly', 'openly', 'hated', 'know', 'hate', 'strong', 'word', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'am', 'kind', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'when', 'Blow', 'Up', 'movie', 'rich', 'meaning', 'hard', 'time', 'establishing', ""meaning'.I"", 'feel', 'maybe', 'effort', 'put', 'was', 'stronger', 'result.The', 'film', 'centers', 'vain', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'who', 'searching', 'find', 'more', 'meaning', 'work', 'take', 'candid', 'photos', 'magazine', 'photos', 'are', 'couple', 'frolicking', 'open', 'field', 'When', 'actually', 'chance', 'develop', 'film', 'more', 'pictures', 'sweet', 'innocence', 'love', 'initially', 'thought', 'was', 'capturing', 'Instead', 'slowly', 'methodically', 'gun', 'what', 'be', 'corpse.There', 'are', 'moments', 'Blow', 'Up', 'seem', 'speak', 'so', 'loudly', 'directors', 'point', 'view', 'emotional', 'response', 'are', 'supposed', 'carry', 'film', 'sometimes', 'moments', 'can', 'find', 'lost', 'structure', 'film', 'vapid', 'existence', 'protagonist', 'Thomas', 'point', 'whole', 'film', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'such', 'zombie-like', 'rock', 'concert', 'strangely', 'aggressive', 'three-way', 'ambiguous', 'high', 'party', 'are', 'key', 'elements', 'films', 'unraveling', 'can', 'feel', 'almost', 'too', 'abrasive', 'too', 'present', 'are', 'subtleties', 'film', 'almost', 'little', 'too', 'blunt', 'point', 'where', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'quick', 'say', 'style', 'substance', 'lot', 'substance', 'here', 'just', 'feel', 'style', 'so', 'thick', 'substance.Another', 'little', 'quibble', 'have', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'dated', 'are', 'films', 'reflecting', 'era', 'are', 'able', 'transcend', 'time', 'feel', 'fresh', 'poignant', 'even', 'today', 'Blow', 'Up', 'so', 'much', '60', 'film', 'feeling', 'relevance', 'today', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'relevant', 'overall', 'message', 'presented', 'Thomas', 'take', 'murder', 'general', 'very', 'relevant', 'presented', 'way', 'too', 'past', 'make', 'real', 'impact', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'really', 'explain', 'what', 'mean', 'hope', ""n't"", 'coming', 'self', 'indulgent', 'was', 'real', 'feeling', 'had', 'watching', 'film', 'just', 'feels', 'far', 'too', ""60's'.This"", 'coming', 'guy', 'who', '60', 'be', 'THE', 'best', 'decade', 'cinema.As', 'far', 'performances', 'are', 'concerned', 'only', 'real', 'standout', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'be', 'just', 'captivating', 'early', 'years', 'now', 'marvelous', 'actress', 'ambiguous', 'approach', 'character', 'panic', 'stricken', 'conscience', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'completely', 'engaging.I', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'appreciate', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'there', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'something', 'really', 'struck', 'levels', 'failed', 'do', 'so', 'can', 'understand', 'attraction', 'Antonioni', 'very', 'visual', 'director', 'film', 'littered', 'marvelous', 'screenshots', 'contrast', 'glossed', 'fake', 'real', 'world', 'gritty', 'almost', 'haunting', 'world', 'presented', 'photographs', 'stellar', 'meaningful', 'observation', 'humble', 'opinion', 'closing', 'mime', 'scene', 'was', 'pure', 'genius', ""'m"", 'being', 'honest', 'then', 'must', 'acknowledge', 'fact', 'here', ""n't"", 'presented', 'best', 'way', 'lot', 'impact', 'Antonioni', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'pull', 'back', 'style', 'so', 'expose', 'substance']",N/A

276577,A1SSA0MF161794,6301966015,Ava Barbi,"[7, 8]","The first time I viewed Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup (1966), the movie was halfway through and I was utterly confused. Still, I was intrigued by the contrast between the flat black-and-white of the protagonist's photos and the bold colors of his wage-earning fashionista world.  However, upon a second viewing of Blowup this past weekend -- thanks to the invaluable TCM cable channel -- I discovered something new: a wonderful, cruel irony in the action of the main character blowing up his b&ws.;  Enlarging his prints to the extent of producing disjointed mor&eacute; patterns, he becomes ever more puzzled by a bizarre mystery that disturbs his jaded life.  It's, like, a totally Hitchcockian experience.In Blowup, it's as though the protagonist played by David Hemmings channels Jimmy Stewart's character from Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window:  photojournalist L.B. Jefferies.  He carries out his photographic skills with more pizzazz than Jefferies -- OK, unfair comparison, as the latter was confined to a wheelchair and one window, creating a claustrophobic sensation.  Hemmings' character (unnamed in Blowup) zips around in fresh, open air with and without his Rolls, but his mind is no less captive than Jefferies'.  What the two voyeurs have in common, besides being photographers, is that they're prisoners of their anxiety and boredom.  And their only relief from urban ennui is playing P.I. for the day.Part of the thrill in viewing Blowup, as in Rear Window, is slipping into the uncomfortable position of voyeur and feeling one's accelerating heartbeat provide the score for the suspenseful scenes.  Slightly sadistic, if not masochistic, the viewer partly wishes that these Peeping Toms would trip up and just call the police for goodness sake.  Not only are both L.B. Jefferies and Hemmings' protagonist amateur sleuths with too much time on their hands, but also they have reckless regard for risking their lives.  While Jefferies may receive a pittance of sympathy from those of us who also feel stuck in a room with many views, Blowup's main character engenders despisement because he goes out of his way to look for trouble.In 1954's Rear Window, there's no doubt that Jefferies' predicament -- a risk-taking, world-renowned photographer sidelined by a disability during a hot summer -- ratchets up the suspense to a dizzying dimension.  (In fact, it is only within the realm of romance that ""Jeff"" *doesn't* take risks.  I mean, he has no problem jumping in front of a racecar to shoot a picture but refuses to propose to his beauteous, long-suffering girlfriend.  Socialite Lisa Freemont is portrayed by Grace Kelly with equal parts romantic idealism and urbane sensuality. Could the reason be that Lisa is well-heeled and willing to climb the social ladder but not hike up Mount Kilimanjaro with her adventure traveler beau?)  By his own volition Jefferies is out on a limb, his binoculars and cameras serving as extensions of his extremities -- and his ego.  Blowup's main character discovers a decade later than Jefferies that even a magnifying glass is pointless because he's faced with the unknown -- that which cannot be seen but indeed can be intuited. Think of that classic image of the young/old lady: If you stare long and hard enough, you perceive what you want. Call it a self-fulfilling prophecy.As I watched Hemmings' photographer examining certain elements of his ""blowups,"" immediately my mind turned to certain scenes in Rear Window where Stewart sees what *could be* evidence of a crime already committed. In both films, however, the viewer isn't privy to the facts of the case and, thus, doesn't know *if* a crime was committed. And in both films, the elements of time and lighting are other, uncredited characters.During my recent viewing of Blowup, I relished in the realm of illusion symbolized by the film's vivid colors and by the use of drugs (including nicotine) as props to reinforce the illusion. Not that I have ever taken an illegal drug in my life, but this second time around watching Blowup gave me the feeling that Antonioni was taking me on an acid-laced journey. The beautiful part, baby, is throughout the film I connected with the metaphysical crisis that Hemmings' antihero experiences as an artist in need of a self-assessment of his worth as an adult human being.After vicariously suffering through his mental defrag while he deconstructs each chunk of a photographed mystery, I thirsted for visual relief. I welcomed Antonioni's mini-masterpieces of distraction, especially the well-edited, living-color orgy sequence that put me in a ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" mood (un-huh). My pupils dilated from mobile colors in the forms of female models tumbling with the main character as he removes their costumes within the contours of purple paper.  Then there's the iconic scene of the photographer trapping a writhing model beneath him while he captures her ecstatic expressions seconds of frame at a time.  Progressive jazz courtesy of Herbie Hancock and his ensemble transform a curt and fleeting mystery lady (played by Vanessa Redgrave) into literally a smoking woman. Remarkably, Redgrave pulls off an optical illusion, recalling Anouk Aimee in her role as the widow, Anne, in another iconic film of 1966:  Un Homme et Une Femme (A Man and A Woman).  Of course, Redgrave's dramatic virtuosity is responsible for evoking the sultry, pouty mod-girl mannerisms that Mme. Aimee displayed so exquisitely in the aforementioned French New Wave film by Claude Lelouch.The most delicious distraction for this voyeur, er, viewer, was one that provided insight into the Blowup protagonist's solitude. It's a moment that magnifies his alienation, his existence that's more stripped-down than mere loneliness.  For him, it occurs outside of his fashion photography sphere. I'm referring, here, to the scene in which he encounters his painter friend, Ron (portrayed by John Castle), copulating with his girlfriend, Patricia (portrayed by Sarah Miles). The photographer's intense gaze locks onto Patricia's rapturous one while she squirms beneath a bright duvet. In a risqu&eacute; scene -- by 1966 standards -- she moans through a climax that could be authentic or fake in keeping with the film's shifting, deceptive sensibilities. It's the one moment in the film where I come close to sympathizing with Hemmings' character because his puppy dog countenance captures the dumbfounded expression of unrequited love.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the absurd subtext of Ron's invisibility within the emotional space created by the photographer and Patricia's adulterous illusion.Blowup is an addictive flick located at the intersection of minimalist thriller and surreal character study. That's this layperson's compliment to the late great Italian filmmaker Michaelangelo Antonioni. In future viewings I'll delight in the film's visual diversions from everyday, black-and-white existential angst. The virtual walk-through in the photographer's duplex alone is a hippie trip from a safe distance.  After nearly a half-century since Blowup's release, it's still not every artist who can afford an interior designer to infuse his or her vain existence with a groovy dose of mad, mod colors.Should Blowup not appear on your cable lineup for months or years to come, you might want to satisfy your desire for a vicarious metaphysical trip -- one with a psychedelic detour -- and get the DVD here on Amazon.com.  Advice from the cool at heart:  Don't dwell on whether there's a theme.  Just dig it, man.",4,Hitchcockian Visions on Acid,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,7551,"['first', 'time', 'viewed', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'Blowup', '1966', 'movie', 'was', 'halfway', 'was',

276580,A88IZVHRTA0BV,6301966015,Brandon DiSabatino,"[8, 11]","The word art is sullied with numerous derogatory connotations by the vox populi.  It has become habitual for people (callow reviewers who sputter inane opinions through an internet-based retailer) to deride any work they do not fully comprehend.  Without question, some work is not intended for some people.  Narrow thinking requires equally narrow answers, therefore those of us who raven for substance have to search elsewhere to sate our appetites.  Often a work comes along that precipitates a great diverse outpouring of thought.  The reception for said works is usually demarcated into either of the following camps: those who persistently laud the effort, showering it with the kind of encomium usually found in the gnarled tongues of pamphleteering zealots, or those who contemptuously debase the film - their efforts being only to tear down the exceptional work that they have not the temerity nor the initiative to create (see the rebuke of blue velvet as supplied by that stammering lout roger ebert - ugh, my spine shakes in contempt for him...ugh).Blow-up is a shining example of this.  It repulsed as many critics as it attracted.  Even the curmudgeonly sour-crotched crone Pauline Kael took time out of her busy schedule of ridiculing Woody Allen to praise the film.  Mostly, i think, this is due to the singular nature of the film.  There is a very isolating aspect to it, where the viewer has to be appeased slowly, nourished sporadically by only meager bits of action, and have faith vested in the competence of the director.  Nothing really happens in the film until the final scene, where the main character dissolves in a verdurous field.  It's akin to Videodrome in a way, where the ideas that the film presents are infinitely more potent than what is shown on the screen (though the vagina on james woods' chest tends to linger).Ostensibly, this film concerns a murder mystery.  A virile, young photographer in mod london is taking pictures in a small secluded park.  In the middle of photographing an embracing couple, he is pursued by the female party.  She implores him to hand over the film, vaguely ranting about all of the complications in her life, how she doesn't desire anymore.  He stubbornly refuses to acquiesce to her demands, responding that it is his obligation to take such photos.Certainly, this would appear suspicious in the minds of an audience and its implications are numerous.  However, this element of the story is barely utilized.  It is touched upon briefly, as we see the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) only once more.  Instead the film follows the photographer through his hedonistic trysts with lascivious young would-be models.  It is only later in the film that he develops the pictures which seem to suggest malice.  Yet even upon contemplating such foul goings-on he seems unperturbed, not in the least deterred from his usual behavior.  He doesn't think for a second of the victim or the perpetrator, his thoughts are solely centered on what these photos could do for his career.Blow-Up is exceptionally well made.  There are certain moments when the camera flits with the kind of terpsichorean grace of a ballet dancer, moments where the viewer is given an exhilerating sensation throughout their body (especially the scenes of the main character driving around in his car), moments that are so exquisitely shot it's difficult to imagine anyone having such a perverse distaste for the film.At the conclusion of Blow-Up i was effected in a way few films have ever effected me.  It belongs to an exclusive dearth of films that have sent my thoughts soaring and given me a renascent vigor for the artistic efforts of others, a film that further braced my intractable faith in cinema.  It is indeed an arduous film to sit through for the casual viewer, as it doesn't offer much in external action.  However, the way it questions our perceptions of reality (which i wouldn't dream of spoiling) with that one scene at the end completely (to me) vindicates its place in the venerable pantheon of great films.  The fact that a film can so succinctly but precisely capture the nature of existence on celluloid is as good a reason as any to seek out this film, given that you are the kind of person to do so.  I think people have a genuine aversion to that which they are incapable of processing.  Instead of meditating on what aspects of the film they don't comprehend, they are wont instead to throw nothing but slander and scurrilous accusations its way, moaning about pretention and pseudo-intellectualism.  Those people obviously don't understand Antonioni's work, nor will they ever if they remain so obstinate in their narrow mindedness.",5,"Be Advised ""Pretentious"" Shall Not Be Found Here",1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,4686,"['word', 'art', 'sullied', 'numerous', 'derogatory', 'connotations', 'vox', 'populi', 'become', 'habitual', 'people', 'callow', 'reviewers', 'who', 'sputter', 'inane', 'opinions', 'internet-based', 'retailer', 'deride', 'work', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'question', 'work', 'not', 'intended', 'people', 'Narrow', 'thinking', 'equally', 'narrow', 'answers', 'therefore', 'who', 'raven', 'substance', 'have', 'search', 'elsewhere', 'sate', 'appetites', 'Often', 'work', 'great', 'diverse', 'outpouring', 'thought', 'reception', 'said', 'works', 'usually', 'demarcated', 'following', 'camps', 'who', 'persistently', 'laud', 'effort', 'showering', 'kind', 'encomium', 'usually', 'found', 'gnarled', 'tongues', 'pamphleteering', 'zealots', 'who', 'contemptuously', 'film', 'efforts', 'being', 'only', 'tear', 'down', 'exceptional', 'work', 'have', 'not', 'temerity', 'initiative', 'create', 'see', 'rebuke', 'blue', 'velvet', 'supplied', 'stammering', 'lout', 'roger', 'ebert', 'ugh', 'spine', 'shakes', 'contempt', 'ugh', '.Blow-up', 'shining', 'example', 'repulsed', 'many', 'critics', 'attracted', 'Even', 'curmudgeonly', 'sour-crotched', 'crone', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'took', 'time', 'busy', 'schedule', 'ridiculing', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'praise', 'film', 'Mostly', 'i', 'think', 'due', 'singular', 'nature', 'film', 'very', 'isolating', 'aspect', 'where', 'viewer', 'be', 'appeased', 'slowly', 'nourished', 'sporadically', 'only', 'meager', 'bits', 'action', 'have', 'faith', 'vested', 'competence', 'director', 'Nothing', 'really', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'dissolves', 'verdurous', 'field', 'akin', 'Videodrome', 'way', 'where', 'ideas', 'film', 'presents', 'are', 'infinitely', 'more', 'potent', 'what', 'shown', 'screen', 'vagina', 'james', 'woods', 'chest', 'linger', '.Ostensibly', 'film', 'murder', 'mystery', 'virile', 'young', 'photographer', 'mod', 'london', 'taking', 'pictures', 'small', 'secluded', 'park', 'middle', 'photographing', 'embracing', 'couple', 'pursued', 'female', 'party', 'hand', 'film', 'vaguely', 'ranting', 'complications', 'life', 'how', ""n't"", 'desire', 'anymore', 'stubbornly', 'acquiesce', 'demands', 'responding', 'obligation', 'take', 'such', 'photos.Certainly', 'would', 'appear', 'suspicious', 'minds', 'audience', 'implications', 'are', 'numerous', 'However', 'element', 'story', 'barely', 'utilized', 'touched', 'briefly', 'see', 'woman', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'only', 'once', 'more', 'Instead', 'film', 'photographer', 'hedonistic', 'trysts', 'lascivious', 'young', 'would-be', 'models', 'only', 'later', 'film', 'pictures', 'seem', 'suggest', 'malice', 'even', 'contemplating', 'such', 'foul', 'goings-on', 'unperturbed', 'not', 'least', 'deterred', 'usual', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'think', 'second', 'victim', 'perpetrator', 'thoughts', 'are', 'solely', 'centered', 'what', 'photos', 'could', 'do', 'career.Blow-Up', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'made', 'are', 'certain', 'moments', 'when', 'camera', 'kind', 'terpsichorean', 'grace', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'moments', 'where', 'viewer', 'given', 'exhilerating', 'sensation', 'body', 'especially', 'scenes', 'main', 'character', 'driving', 'around', 'car', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'exquisitely', 'shot', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'having', 'such', 'perverse', 'distaste', 'film.At', 'conclusion', 'Blow-Up', 'i', 'was', 'effected', 'way', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'effected', 'exclusive', 'dearth', 'films', 'have', 'sent', 'thoughts', 'soaring', 'given', 'renascent', 'vigor', 'artistic', 'efforts', 'others', 'film', 'further', 'braced', 'intractable', 'faith', 'cinema', 'indeed', 'arduous', 'film', 'sit', 'casual', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'external', 'action', 'However', 'way', 'questions', 'perceptions', 'reality', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'dream', 'spoiling', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'completely', 'place', 'venerable', 'pantheon', 'great', 'films', 'fact', 'film', 'can', 'so', 'succinctly', 'precisely', 'capture', 'nature', 'existence', 'celluloid', 'as', 'good', 'reason', 'seek', 'out', 'film', 'given', 'are', 'kind', 'person', 'do', 'so', 'think', 'people', 'have', 'genuine', 'aversion', 'are', 'incapable', 'processing', 'Instead', 'meditating', 'aspects', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'are', 'wont', 'instead', 'throw', 'nothing', 'slander', 'scurrilous', 'accusations', 'way', 'moaning', 'pretention', 'pseudo-intellectualism', 'people', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Antonioni', 'work', 'will', 'ever', 'remain', 'so', 'obstinate', 'narrow', 'mindedness']",N/A

David Hemmings is very hip and charming, smokes weed, and makes out with young models (hmmm does this film objectify women?) and seems very happy with his self absorbed life. He drives around in a convertible and buys a WWII propeller for unclear reasons.  I think that Hemmings is the ultimate hedonist,  rather than search for the truth, he would rather pursue the physical pleasures he can extort from Vanessa Redgrave. This film shows us his moment to change, The universe is extending to him, the opportunity to &quot;do the right thing&quot; to be benevolent, to take action.  But ultimately, it is simply too much work and what is morally right cannot compete with the pleasures of drugs and sex.

It questions the nature of reality and critiques decadent lifestyles and, when approached with the right amount of curiosity and patience, becomes a steadily engrossing cinematic puzzle. Over the years, I've wound up seeing &quot;Blow Up&quot; about four or five times and it's only now, after many viewings and a dozen or so years beyond academia, that I'm able to appreciate the movie's puzzles.David Hemmings plays a callous fashion photographer in swinging London who believes he may have snapped a picture of an unlikely murder in progress. The film follows him through one long Saturday as he enlarges the negatives looking for clues, and is diverted by all kinds of distractions - groupies, doobies, models, mimes, a mysterious femme fatale and even The Yardbirds. Has he uncovered a conspiracy? Or is he losing his mind? The movie, which plays fast and loose with the concepts of perception and time, offers no easy answers when it supplies answers at all -- which is part of its appeal and controversy.It also directly inspired at least two classic thrillers (Brian DePalma's &quot;Blow-Out&quot; and Francis Coppola's &quot;The Conversation&quot;), not to mention quite a few of the gags in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series.&quot;Blowup&quot; was finally released on DVD with great restored picture quality but a curiously hard-to-hear 1 Channel audio track.  I had to crank the volume to be able to hear the dialogue.  Even the commentary track -- an off-the-cuff analysis by Peter Brunette, Antonioni-biographer and English professor at George Mason University -- is in 2 Channel and, when he's not talking, you can hear a good sample of how this movie should've sounded.There's also a &quot;music only&quot; track (which allows viewers to focus on Herbie Hancock's jazzy score) and, given that Hancock is still around and active, it's a shame he wasn't brought in to talk about the score during the gaps between cuts (much like Danny Elfman does on the excellent music-only track on &quot;Pee-wee's Big Adventure.&quot;",4,An intriguing mirage - too bad the sound is so poor,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,2445,"['Watch', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', '1966', 'classic', 'quot', 'Blowup', 'quot', 'wrong', 'mood', 'could', 'be', 'long', '111', 'minutes.The', 'pace', 'glacial', 'main', 'character', 'rude', 'cryptic', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'college', 'audience', 'talkative', 'frustrated', 'students', 'included', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'ready', 'riot', 'time', 'final', 'credits', 'rolled.But', 'quot', 'Blowup', 'quot', 'was', 'designed', 'spark', 'debate', 'questions', 'nature', 'reality', 'critiques', 'decadent', 'lifestyles', 'when', 'approached', 'right', 'amount', 'curiosity', 'patience', 'steadily', 'engrossing', 'cinematic', 'puzzle', 'years', ""'ve"", 'wound', 'up', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Blow', 'Up', 'quot', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'only', 'now', 'many', 'viewings', 'dozen', 'so', 'years', 'academia', ""'m"", 'able', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'puzzles.David', 'Hemmings', 'callous', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'swinging', 'London', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'snapped', 'picture', 'unlikely', 'murder', 'progress', 'film', 'one', 'long', 'Saturday', 'negatives', 'looking', 'clues', 'diverted', 'kinds', 'distractions', 'groupies', 'doobies', 'models', 'mimes', 'mysterious', 'femme', 'fatale', 'even', 'Yardbirds', 'uncovered', 'conspiracy', 'losing', 'mind', 'movie', 'fast', 'loose', 'concepts', 'perception', 'time', 'easy', 'answers', 'when', 'answers', 'part', 'appeal', 'controversy.It', 'also', 'directly', 'inspired', 'least', 'two', 'classic', 'thrillers', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'quot', 'Blow-Out', 'quot', 'Francis', 'Coppola', 'quot', 'Conversation', 'quot', 'not', 'mention', 'quite', 'few', 'gags', 'quot', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'quot', 'quot', 'Blowup', 'quot', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD', 'great', 'restored', 'picture', 'quality', 'curiously', 'hard-to-hear', '1', 'Channel', 'audio', 'track', 'had', 'crank', 'volume', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'Even', 'commentary', 'track', 'off-the-cuff', 'analysis', 'Peter', 'Brunette', 'Antonioni-biographer', 'English', 'professor', 'George', 'Mason', 'University', '2', 'Channel', 'when', 'not', 'talking', 'can', 'hear', 'good', 'sample', 'how', 'movie', 'should', ""'ve"", 'also', 'quot', 'music', 'only', 'quot', 'track', 'viewers', 'focus', 'Herbie', 'Hancock', 'jazzy', 'score', 'given', 'Hancock', 'still', 'around', 'active', 'shame', 'was', ""n't"", 'brought', 'talk', 'score', 'gaps', 'cuts', 'much', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'excellent', 'music-only', 'track', 'quot', 'Pee-wee', 'Big', 'Adventure.', 'quot']",N/A

But Blow Up is a bore. Nothing happens. You wait patiently. The film moves at snail's pace. Blow Up represents the most aimless tendencies of foreign film. It has a French-like tendency (desire?) to meander. Blow Up has at best thirty minutes of content stretched to nearly two hours.Characters act cold and distant and more than a bit cruel. The movie ends with mimes (never a good sign) pretending to play tennis in the park. Fin. Credits roll. What does it all mean? And why should I care? Films do not have to have a point. A character up to his neck in ennui who is on an existential quest to nowhere (as in Eyes Wide Shut) is okay. But if your film has nothing to say, make it interesting--either visually or in its dialogue. But Blow Up takes a mimimalistic approach. Long silences. Little action. No emotion. It is about an hour into the movie that something finally ""happens""--a seeming murder. I thought the film might take a Hitchcockian turn. But it doesn't. Was the man in the park murdered? Did the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) have him killed? Why was the body left there? Was he cheating with her, or was she cheating with him? We never get the answer to such questions, because no one in the movie cares enough to find out. Is this a statement about the vacuousness of 60s culture? I guess. A postmodern statement about man's indifference to man? Maybe. But I didn't care enough about the characters to care about the movie's message (if there is one). Blow Up represents a view so world weary that naked romping (scandalous then, tame by today's standards) by supermodels and a cameo by the Yardbirds (yes, that's Jimmy Page) can't lighten the mood. Is Blow Up an embrace of ""cool"" or a rejection of it? Who knows? I can only be sure that this movie was deserved grist for the Austin Powers parody mill. Mike Myers movies are fun.

While it hasn't exactly aged very well, its sheer dated-ness is part of its charm.The late David Hemmings portrays a young, jaded, wealthy, misogynist fashion photographer who's life of nonstop sex, drugs, parties and beautiful women bores him to tears.  While snapping photographs of a couple locked in an embrace, he inadvertantly discovers that he may--or may not--have photographed a murder, and is pestered for the negatives by a mysterious woman (Vanessa Redgrave) who may know more than she lets on.The film is set in the ""Swinging"" London of the 1960s, which comes off as surprisingly dull.  The buildings and the weather are grey and depressing, the drug parties are boring, and the audience at a Yardbirds concert (featuring Jeff Beck and a pre-Led Zep Jimmy Page) is practically catatonic.  I couldn't help but think of the ""Austin Powers"" movies while watching ""Blow-Up"", and how Hemmings seems like a sullen version of MI5's groovy special agent.What titillated audiences in 1966 no doubt was the smoking of marijuana and the threesome featuring Hemmings and two young girls, complete with a brief shot of pubic hair.  That's probably why the film was such a hit back then.  The sex and drugs by today's standards are pretty tame, to be honest.  What shines through today is the storytelling, particularly the story of the alleged murder, told silently through a series of Hemmings' blow-up photographs.""Blow-Up"" also has a metaphysical aspect to it, namely ""What is reality?""  That subject is simply TOO complicated for one humble, unpaid Amazon reviewer.

Slipman,"[4, 6]","Director Michelangelo Antonioni leads us on a bizarre and artsy journey between the real and the imagined through the psychedelic scene of 1960's London.  David Hemmings who nicely plays disillusioned photographer Thomas, is taking a break from his hectic schedule.  Strolling through a local park with camera in hand he is casually taking pictures of sights and scenes.  He espies a couple in amorous embrace and innocently takes a series of photographs of them.  The woman, Jane played by Vanessa Redgrave is visibly upset and demands that Hemmings give her the photos.  He blows her off and leaves the park.Hemmings returns to his flat and studio and who should turn up but Redgrave.  She tries to seduce him in an attempt to procure the film but Hemmings gives her a different roll of film instead.After Redgrave departs Hemmings heads to his darkroom to develope the film of the couple in the park.  One photograph in particular interests him and he begins blowing up different segments of the photo to discover a figure with a pistol hidden in the bushes.  A subsequent photo blown up shows an apparent body lying on the ground.  Has a murder been committed?Hemmings rushes back to the park where he discovers the corpse of the gent that he saw with Regrave.  Hemmings is at a loss as to what to do and meanders through a wild rock concert featuring music legends Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck of the Yardbirds and a subsequent pot party at his friends house, while attempting to reason things out.Hemmings awakens the next morning and rushes back to the park.

276588,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6301966015,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","Blowup was Michelangelo Antonioni's first English language film, made in Great Britain, in 1966, and it's a flat-out great film, at a crisp 111 minutes. It was nominated for two Academy Awards; Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay- by Antonioni, Tonino Guerra, and Edward Bond- adapted from the short story Las Babas Del Diablo, by Argentine writer Julio Cortazar, and won the National Society Of Film Critics title as best film of 1967. Having first seen the two Hollywood films most influenced by it- Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, in 1974, and Brian De Palma's Blowout, in 1981, I did not know quite what to expect, since the former is also a great film- arguably Coppola's best, and the latter is a merely solid Hollywood thriller. Blowup is not only a great work of art, but a great work of philosophy. It is arguably as great as Antonioni's earlier Italian language masterpiece, La Notte, and the film caused a bit of a scandal upon its release, both for its showing casual sex and drug usage, and for its female nudity. Of course, forty years later, this all seems a bit silly, as tame as the scenes really are to the modern eye.The story follows an unnamed photographer (David Hemmings) who may or may not have inadvertently captured a murder on film, which may or may not involve a mysterious young woman (Vanessa Redgrave) who later visits the photographer in his studio, ready to have sex with him to retrieve the photos before he develops them. Both of the main characters are never named in the film, despite numerous reviews that call the two main characters Thomas and Jane. In watching the film twice- with and without commentary, I found zero in the way of evidence to support this claim of their being named, so I take it as one of those bits of information that gets repeated ad nauseam by bad critics until accepted, despite its being untrue. Possibly there were press kits that named the two characters, but they are not named within, nor in the credits. Yet, this very lack of names only makes the film all the more interesting, for not knowing the truth of these two characters only heightens their mysteriousness, and the events that ensnare the both of them. The photographer even sardonically comments in the film, when he's about to lay two girls- or `birds', `What's the use of a name?'Hemmings is a famed photographer whom we first see emerging from a London flophouse, just one of a crowd- not unlike the Carlo Battisti character in Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D., where he's gotten some great and intimate photos of the poor, which he plans on using in a book. He posed as a poor guy to get them, yet hops into his convertible wood paneled Rolls Royce. We then see him rather misogynistically mistreat a high fashion and clearly pre-anorexia nervosa anorexic supermodel (Verushka) in the grotesque Twiggy vein- whom, in a famed scene, he erotically `mounts', as he photographs her from above as she lies on the floor, five models who pose behind dark glass screens, and the two `birds' in pink and green pantyhose. We also find out he lives next door to an Abstract Expressionist painter, Bill (John Castle), and his girlfriend, Patricia (Sarah Miles), whom he has an unspoken attraction to, and who seems to return his feelings. In describing his paintings, Bill says he has no intent when he starts a painting, and that meaning only comes later. This is a key to the film, or at least the viewer's warning on how to take what they see....Others have laid bare the plot.Like Akira Kurosawa's classic film Rashomon, Blowup works on many levels, yet allows us to participate in the interpretation to an even greater extent than Rashomon. Photographs can lie- just ask AP photographer Eddie Adams, who, a few years later took the infamous photograph of a Vietnamese police commander shooting a Vietcong prisoner in the head. What was not shown was that the prisoner had killed many innocent people. By going beyond being a mere whodunit, and engaging the very the meaning of meaning, itself, Blowup (and it is Blowup, not Blow-Up, as on the DVD cover) illustrates the differences between the writer and the visual artist. The former elicits significance from things that need to be seen, while the latter does so from that already seen. In truth, there could be plausible and non-criminal reasons for all that happens in the film, and only the dull life of Hemmings spurs him on to imbue significance. That we can never know the real truth within the film is the real truth as to why this film never loses its hold in repeated viewings. On that score, no comment is needed.",5,Antonioni rocks,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,4618,"['Blowup', 'was', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'first', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'made', 'Great', 'Britain', '1966', 'flat-out', 'great', 'film', 'crisp', '111', 'minutes', 'was', 'nominated', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay-', 'Antonioni', 'Tonino', 'Guerra', 'Edward', 'Bond-', 'adapted', 'short', 'story', 'Las', 'Babas', 'Del', 'Diablo', 'Argentine', 'writer', 'Julio', 'Cortazar', 'won', 'National', 'Society', 'Film', 'Critics', 'title', 'best', 'film', '1967', 'Having', 'first', 'seen', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'most', 'influenced', 'it-', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Conversation', '1974', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'Blowout', '1981', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'expect', 'former', 'also', 'great', 'film-', 'arguably', 'Coppola', 'best', 'latter', 'merely', 'solid', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'Blowup', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'work', 'art', 'great', 'work', 'philosophy', 'arguably', 'as', 'great', 'Antonioni', 'earlier', 'Italian', 'language', 'masterpiece', 'La', 'Notte', 'film', 'caused', 'bit', 'scandal', 'release', 'showing', 'casual', 'sex', 'drug', 'usage', 'female', 'nudity', 'course', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'bit', 'silly', 'as', 'tame', 'scenes', 'really', 'are', 'modern', 'eye.The', 'story', 'unnamed', 'photographer', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'inadvertently', 'captured', 'murder', 'film', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'involve', 'mysterious', 'young', 'woman', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'who', 'later', 'photographer', 'studio', 'ready', 'have', 'sex', 'retrieve', 'photos', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'named', 'film', 'numerous', 'reviews', 'call', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'watching', 'film', 'twice-', 'commentary', 'found', 'zero', 'way', 'evidence', 'support', 'claim', 'being', 'named', 'take', 'one', 'bits', 'information', 'repeated', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'bad', 'critics', 'accepted', 'being', 'untrue', 'Possibly', 'were', 'press', 'kits', 'named', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'named', 'credits', 'Yet', 'very', 'lack', 'names', 'only', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'not', 'knowing', 'truth', 'two', 'characters', 'only', 'mysteriousness', 'events', 'ensnare', 'photographer', 'even', 'sardonically', 'comments', 'film', 'when', 'lay', 'two', 'girls-', 'birds', 'What', 'use', 'name', ""'Hemmings"", 'famed', 'photographer', 'whom', 'first', 'see', 'emerging', 'London', 'flophouse', 'just', 'one', 'crowd-', 'not', 'Carlo', 'Battisti', 'character', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'Umberto', 'D.', 'where', 'gotten', 'great', 'intimate', 'photos', 'poor', 'using', 'book', 'posed', 'poor', 'guy', 'get', 'yet', 'hops', 'convertible', 'wood', 'paneled', 'Rolls', 'Royce', 'then', 'see', 'rather', 'misogynistically', 'mistreat', 'high', 'fashion', 'clearly', 'pre-anorexia', 'nervosa', 'anorexic', 'supermodel', 'Verushka', 'grotesque', 'Twiggy', 'vein-', 'whom', 'famed', 'scene', 'erotically', 'mounts', 'floor', 'five', 'models', 'who', 'pose', 'dark', 'glass', 'screens', 'two', 'birds', 'pink', 'green', 'pantyhose', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'next', 'door', 'Abstract', 'Expressionist', 'painter', 'Bill', 'John', 'Castle', 'girlfriend', 'Patricia', 'Sarah', 'Miles', 'whom', 'unspoken', 'attraction', 'who', 'return', 'feelings', 'describing', 'paintings', 'Bill', 'intent', 'when', 'painting', 'meaning', 'only', 'later', 'key', 'film', 'least', 'viewer', 'warning', 'how', 'take', 'what', 'see', '.Others', 'have', 'laid', 'plot.Like', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'classic', 'film', 'Rashomon', 'Blowup', 'many', 'levels', 'yet', 'participate', 'interpretation', 'even', 'greater', 'extent', 'Rashomon', 'Photographs', 'can', 'lie-', 'just', 'ask', 'AP', 'photographer', 'Eddie', 'Adams', 'who', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'took', 'infamous', 'photograph', 'Vietnamese', 'police', 'commander', 'shooting', 'Vietcong', 'prisoner', 'head', 'What', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'was', 'prisoner', 'had', 'killed', 'many', 'innocent', 'people', 'going', 'being', 'mere', 'whodunit', 'engaging', 'very', 'meaning', 'meaning', 'Blowup', 'Blowup', 'not', 'Blow-Up', 'DVD', 'cover', 'differences', 'writer', 'visual', 'artist', 'former', 'elicits', 'significance', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'latter', 'so', 'already', 'seen', 'truth', 'could', 'be', 'plausible', 'non-criminal', 'reasons', 'film', 'only', 'dull', 'life', 'Hemmings', 'spurs', 'imbue', 'significance', 'can', 'never', 'know', 'real', 'truth', 'film', 'real', 'truth', 'why', 'film', 'never', 'hold', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'score', 'comment', 'needed']",N/A
276589,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6301966015,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 9]","Are we sure of what we see?  Or is what we see actually what we THINK we see?  Can we distort our perceptions in blowing up a photograph to expose a not-so-defined area and see something we think is something else?  The moral seems to be that like the game of tennis played with an imaginary ball by the rag week students in clown/mime makeup, is that we believe what we see, and we see what our perceptions tell us.Michelangelo Antonioni's first English-language film follows Thomas (David Hemmings), a jaded and bored fashion photographer who depending on his mood, is brusque with his models, though he is civil with his Girl Friday, with whom he communicates on a two-way.Things get exciting after he shoots a couple in the park and the woman demands the photos he snapped.  The scene where the woman enters his studio trying to get the photos he snapped of her is an interesting look at Antonioni's technique.  No, it's not the scene of her shedding her blouse, but the way Antonioni photographs the woman among the clutter in Thomas's apartment, signifying a claustrophobic and tense atmosphere played out in their cat-and-mouse game.  Clearly, the 60's was a time where established stars baring themselves was taboo.  Hence Vanessa Redgrave's placement of her arms over her breasts and her bare back shown in rear shots establishing that she is indeed topless.The moments of near silence become more effective as the viewer is drawn into Thomas's developing the photos.  As he develops two photos in particular, he notices something in the way and direction the woman is looking as she embraces her lover.  The trips to the darkroom to blow up certain portions draws the viewer in, which mirrors Thomas's excitement.  For him, an artist, this is the moment, the present, the work in process.  The montage of photos, originals and blowups, is a highlight in this scene, as the photos tell a story.  And the things with blowups is a reminder of what Kennedy conspiracy theorists did with blowups of the Zapruder film frames, where they claimed a gunman's head and rifle could be seen in as in Zapruder Frame 413.One interesting comment that arises is Thomas's visit to an artist friend's place.  The artist Bill remarks on a piece of Pollock-like abstract art that it's like a detective story.  Later, when Thomas shows one of his blown up photos of whom he thinks is a murdered man, Patricia, a woman whom he yearns for, says that it looks like one of Bill's paintings, completing the symmetry full circle.  So art, like truth, is totally dependent on our interpretation.This film also benefits from Herbie Hancock's hip score, clearly very 60's, and the appearance of the Yardbirds, where they perform ""Stroll In.""  There are a few closeup shots of Jimmy Page and where Jeff Beck smashes his guitar at the end of the performance.  The fashions of the time, such as the colourful Mary Quant minis and hairdos worn by Gillian Hills (the blonde) and Jane Birkin (the brunette), the latter who gained notice after the playful romp with Thomas.

Normally I would never write a negative review, but considering the amount of verbiage this 'classic' has inspired, I fel an almost civic duty to try and re-dress the balance. If it was still showing at a local theatre I would be compelled to go along and form a human barricade to stop unwitting would-be viewers. That's how strongly I feel about this tawdry, empty piece of pseudo-art. The plot is thin, the acting (with the exception of the luminous Vanessa Redgrave) barely rises above the level of a 60's UK soap opera, and possibly worst of all the script is so vacuous that the overwhelming feeling is one of crunching boredom. Ironic considering the setting, one of the more 'happening' of recent history. The main character, played by David Hemmings, is the only fully-realised part in the film, a shame considering his is one of the most repellent roles since cinema began -vain, self-regarding, misogynistic, shallow, greedy and omnipotently self-unaware. He's not the kind of character you love to hate, a la Ian McShane in Deadwood or Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, he's just a black hole of a person, and it's Antonioni's decision to make him the focal point of the film that grates the most when enduring this nonsense-kind of like staring intently at one of those Magic Eye posters for 2 hours, only for the artist to tell you that it's just a bunch of dots after all. It's just that enervating. Hemmings was much better in a similarly-themed film by another Italian director, Argento's Profundo Rosso. It's not the length of this film that bothers me, nor even the silences -so lengthy they conjure Tarkovsky directing Brando doing Pinter (in a sound-proofed room!), it's the insulting heartlessness at its centre, personified by Hemmings's wide-boy photographer. In fact I would happily sit through the world's longest silent movie -weeks long and with no audio track -as long as it consisted solely of this character being lovingly and inventively tortured. Just as Roger Ebert said that his colonoscopy footage was more enjoyable than The Brown Bunny, that epic piece of snuff would beat the hell out of Blow-up. About the audio: it's not enough that Antonioni should dispense with any kind of sound for long tracts of this guff, he has also chosen to ignore one of the best soundtracks of the '60s, by 'Herbert' Hancock. Some brief footage of the Yardbirds is not enough to make up for this. Also worth pointing out is that this film contains the least sexy threesome ever commited to the screen. Quite a feat! Unless this is all some sort of early post-modern prank on the hapless viewer, I think it's safe to say that Blow-up is entirely without any kind of merit.

His fashion photography is done in color, his artistic work in black-and-white.  One of Antonioni's key themesis the contrast of the stark, unforgiving play of light and shadow in black and white film with the vivid garishness of color.  One day, while shooting off a roll of film in Greene Park, Thomas, our photographer, follows the path of two lovers,seemingly engaged in an illicit affair.  When he develops the pictures and blows them up, he discovers what looks suspiciously like a murder.  These suspicions are only exagerrated when the girl in the pictures (Vanessa Redgrave) shows up at his door and tries to seduce him out of the roll of film.  Needless to say,nothing proves to be exactly as it seems.  The continuous frustration of expectations, the denial of human responsibility and compassion were, unfortunately, what the 60's came to be all about.From the rollicking, partying mimes who open and close the picture, to the snake-like seductiveness of Verushka in her photoshoot, to Yardbirds' guitarist Jeff Beck destroying his guitar in an angry fit near the picture's end, there's a surrealism to everything that's vertiginous.  This movie just continually makes your head spin!My one complaint is that no transfer I have yet seen has managed to restore the lushness and vividness of the original color print.

Antonioni, the great Italian filmmaker, turns his x-ray lens on a British photographer (played with cranky verne by the late David Hemmings) who is so self-obsessed that he has disconnected himself from reality. Blithely moving from situation to situation without focus until he comes across what appears to be a murder in a series of random photos taken in the park one day, Hemmings faces a moral and mental crisis he cannot turn away from. One of the people he intrudes upon is Vanessa Redgrave, who will stop at nothing to obtain the photos. The meaning of the photographs is not as important as Hemmings's reaction to them. If he has uncoverd a murder, will he get involved? The haunting ending with the invisible tennis game surely had audiences shaking their heads. Examined within the context of the film itself, it makes perfect sense. This film also contains a rare concert performance by the Yardbirds featuring both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck.

Not many directors can carve out a lasting career on films with no substantial plots, but Antonioni has done it with style. Blow-Up has an intersting premise that never finds a solid conclusion, which is it's real appeal. The film's meandering style is at times interesting, and other times tedious. Antonioni is famous for having changed normal film grammar with L'Avventura (1960), but in Blow-Up the style wears a little thin by the end. Swinging London is nicely photographed, the colors and fashion are bold, and David Hemmings is perfect as the disenchanted photographer.

276598,A1LF84ED2L4MXB,6301966015,Doreen Appleton,"[7, 7]","Someone changed the title music, to begin with. If you leave the menu on your screen and listen, you will hear the original title music, a brief rock interlude followed by a wistful jazz piano. The strident, cacaphonous trumpet you hear under the titles is the wrong music.If Blowup looks and feels different from the four Antonioni films that preceded it, one reason may be that Antonioni used an English editor, Frank Clarke (uncredited). The pace of the movie is far faster than what a viewer of L'Eclisse or La Notte would expect.In many scenes there are sudden, apparently pointless cuts. These are inserted to give the movie a more nervous look than we expect from Antonioni. Perhaps, knowing he was making his first mystery, Antonioni planned this new style with his editor.There are other mannerisms, not unique to this film, that are always interesting. The camera follows a receding car for some distance, then slows down and lets the car get further away.A burst of music will suddenly be heard, and just as suddenly fade away. In the studio this seems to signify the photographer's preoccupation with the photos, causing him to forget the music.-- Critics and the public are correct in viewing Antonioni as a dark pessimist about human nature. He sees us as sadly unequipped for the challenges of reality, relationships, moral judgment, etc. The theme of the movie is how easily the photographer is distracted from the serious business at hand, i.e. the apparent murder captured by his camera. He is no match for the reality before him, and drifts from one diversion to the next. The wonderful scene of the Yardbirds playing to a catatonic audience, and our hero coming away with the worthless trophy, sums up the director's view of him.But the key scene of the movie is when the photographer, suspecting the murder, leaves his studio without his camera, finds the body in the park, can't photograph it, and returns to the studio to find that all the prints and negatives of the event have been stolen in his absence. One false step and everything is lost. The record of the reality, and perhaps the reality itself.Antonioni invited the debate about whether anything at all happened -- the murder, the photographs, the scene in the park, etc. -- by having the imaginary tennis ball at the end of the film begin to make plocking noises, and by having the photographer disappear. Why Antonioni called this moment his ""signature"" is a mystery to me. Possibly to bring more people into the theaters.The scene in the park is a classic of form and color and movement. Nothing like it has been done before or since. If you turn the volume up on your TV during this scene, you will realize that the trees and bushes, being blown by the wind, are definite conspirators in what is happening to the man and woman. Similarly, in the final scene, the sky has turned grey and the trees and bushes seem to mock the photographer who has returned to the scene of his greatest failure.I had to watch the movie 50 times before I realized that the killer behind the fence is the grassy knoll assassin in Dallas. The movie was made three years after the Kennedy assassination.The scenes in the studio, discovering the truth hidden in the photos, have been much imitated. They are wonderful, breathless, dramatic.Today the question of reality seems far less pertinent than the shallowness of the photographer [who may also be the artist, according to some] and his inability to confront the real in an adult, responsible way. But it can be argued that if human perception is so skewed by selfish concerns and shallow desires, the human race never really perceives a real world at all. Only the next pleasure, the next gratification, the next need or project. The human world we see around us, colored by war, famine, violence, and the colossal indifference of man to his fellow man, may be a world built by creatures who do not have a reality.

276599,A280GY5UVUS2QH,6301966015,Doug Anderson,"[4, 6]","David Hemmings plays a bored fashion photographer. Bored because everything he deals with is fleeting and essentially meaningless. He is surrounded by art and artists and lives only through the lens of his camera. People are not important to him, only how they photograph. A book of pictures is his project. That is his contact point with &quot;reality&quot;. He earns his living with the fashion photographs but the superfluity of that world leaves him with a wanting for a deeper confrontation with reality. And he gets that one day while taking random photos in a park.  Only in the darkroom does he discover what he has found, a corpse. But now that he is confronted with something truly substantial he is uncertain how to act. The body lies in the park but he contacts no one but his agent. He is helpless to exist but as an observer. With the camera he is free to manipulate reality but without the camera(or some other art form serving as interpreter) reality is impenetrable, indefineable, unsolvable. Antonioni uses very little dialogue rather he paints his mysterious picture of the world with sound (while in the art saturated atmosphere of the studio we hear a great Herbie Hancock Jazz Soundtrack) and the abscence of sound (when in the park we hear only the unordered sounds of nature which makes those scenes all the more mysterious). Hemmings lives in the noise and eye pollution of the sixties but seeks his peace and stillness in the quiet park. During the Yardbyrds rock performance the crowd is stone silent giving the film viewer the feeling that the crowd like Hemmings is searching among all the noise for something too. Finally the ultimate creatures of silence, the mime troupe, sum up all human activity as they quietly parody the human comedy. Hemmings lead has gone cold, the corpse has dissappeared. Walking through the park he watches the mimes play a pretend game of tennis and slowly he catches on. The game is allegory for all lifes quests, and the trick is to keep the imaginary ball in the air. Hemmings urge to discover something substantial has led him right back to the surface of things. With the mimes there is a sort of shared recognition of futility but a connection has been made with his fellow artists on some level. In Antonioni's version of the pop world we are all artists chasing a mystery doing our own kind of imaginary dance with &quot;reality&quot;. A great and satisfying movie inspired by a great short story writer, Julio Cortazar. The faces in the movie are unforgettable: a young Jane Birken as a want to be model, a young Vanessa Redgrave, Verushka....Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck....And that great Hancock soundtrack, coolest jazz soundtrack I've ever heard. Great London sixties atmospheres from swinging studio to street life to lordly mansion parties.

276600,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6301966015,Douglas Doepke,"[14, 32]","Riding the crest of an art house wave, Antonioni made an English language splash with this his first  commercial movie. It rolled into neighborhoods on the tides of slick photography, trendy themes, and last but not least, the first glimpse of pubic hair on the mom and pop screen (unfortunately deleted in my copy). He had a smash. So why hasn't the movie worn well, as I believe it hasn't. Well, fashions come and go, while the swinging London styles have long since passed into the rag bin. Then too, there's the plot, or what there is of it. That old conundrum about now you see it , now you don't -- is it really real or just make-believe -- is too tired and pretentious to compensate for the other meagre goings-on.  Moreover, the Hemmings character is simply too vapid for the audience to care what happens. A few enlivening traits would not have been out of place. But then, Blow-up is more a cynical dissertation than a movie, so Hemmings had to be a cypher to fit into the relentless monologue of superficial people in a superficial world. My point is not that Blow-up is without virtues. The revealing symbolism of a disconnected propeller hauled around by a disconnected personality, or the sometimes spooky atmosphere, are good examples. Rather, it's that the film is ultimately too arid and time-bound to get beyond the faddish stage in which it was created. A fruitful comparison is with Hitchcock's (1954) Rear Window, two films surprisingly alike in plot and theme. Where Hitchcock  humanizes people into a developing story such that the audience cares when the photographer (James Stewart) overcomes his obsessions, does anyone care that Hemmings can't get beyond his. Ninety minutes of preceding screen time have given us little reason to care, or even support for believing he could. Where Hitchcock creates depth in the commonplace, Antonioni creates only an intellectual exercise, which is why Hitchcock still dwells in the news stands, while Antonioni has been elevated to the archives.",3,Adrift in the Archives,1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,2009,"['Riding', 'crest', 'art', 'house', 'wave', 'Antonioni', 'made', 'English', 'language', 'splash', 'first', 'commercial', 'movie', 'rolled', 'neighborhoods', 'tides', 'slick', 'photography', 'trendy', 'themes', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'first', 'glimpse', 'pubic', 'hair', 'mom', 'pop', 'screen', 'unfortunately', 'deleted', 'copy', 'had', 'smash', 'So', 'why', ""n't"", 'movie', 'worn', 'well', 'believe', ""n't"", 'Well', 'fashions', 'come', 'go', 'swinging', 'London', 'styles', 'have', 'long', 'passed', 'rag', 'bin', 'Then', 'too', 'plot', 'what', 'old', 'conundrum', 'now', 'see', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'real', 'just', 'make-believe', 'too', 'tired', 'pretentious', 'compensate', 'other', 'meagre', 'goings-on', 'Moreover', 'Hemmings', 'character', 'simply', 'too', 'vapid', 'audience', 'care', 'what', 'few', 'enlivening', 'traits', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'place', 'then', 'Blow-up', 'more', 'cynical', 'dissertation', 'movie', 'Hemmings', 'had', 'be', 'cypher', 'fit', 'relentless', 'monologue', 'superficial', 'people', 'superficial', 'world', 'point', 'not', 'Blow-up', 'virtues', 'revealing', 'symbolism', 'disconnected', 'propeller', 'hauled', 'around', 'disconnected', 'personality', 'sometimes', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'good', 'examples', 'Rather', 'film', 'ultimately', 'too', 'arid', 'time-bound', 'get', 'faddish', 'stage', 'was', 'created', 'fruitful', 'comparison', 'Hitchcock', '1954', 'Rear', 'Window', 'two', 'films', 'surprisingly', 'alike', 'plot', 'theme', 'Where', 'Hitchcock', 'people', 'developing', 'story', 'such', 'audience', 'cares', 'when', 'photographer', 'James', 'Stewart', 'obsessions', 'anyone', 'care', 'Hemmings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Ninety', 'minutes', 'preceding', 'screen', 'time', 'have', 'given', 'little', 'reason', 'care', 'even', 'support', 'believing', 'could', 'Where', 'Hitchcock', 'depth', 'commonplace', 'Antonioni', 'only', 'intellectual', 'exercise', 'why', 'Hitchcock', 'still', 'news', 'Antonioni', 'been', 'elevated', 'archives']",N/A
276601,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,6301966015,Edmonson,"[3, 3]","Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Blow-Up"" features David Hemmings as the photographer. This film follows the photographer into a park where he takes photos of a couple embracing and playing. It is later when he develops the photos that he finds out that he has evidence of a murder in the backgrounds of the photos.The movie is as much about the photgrapher in the film as it is about Antonioni, who is also the photographer of the movie. In the movie when Hemmings develops the photos he is trying to put together the reality of the scene, and he is trying to impose a narrative on the scene he has viewed just as the director himself through a sequence of scenes is creating a narrative. Can reality ever really make sense though? Here, the photographer is going over photo after photo in order to try and recreate the past moment that he witnessed. Interestingly enough while we are watching the scenes there is no sound or music except the haunting sounds we heard in the park of the leaves of the trees rustling in the wind. Through these sequences of shots a marvelous build up of drama is created as we speculate about what he is going to find. Eventually he does find a man in the woods holding a gun, and believes that he has prevented a murder. It is through a series of shots like these that Antonioni's genius for film making is conveyed. After blowing up a few more photos he finds a body and realizes that someone was killed after all.There is a scene that is important in the film that shows an artist in his studio who makes a comment that he often doesn't know what he has made until after the fact. And it is only after he has had some time to view the painting that some aspect of it begins to have meaning for him. It is at this point that he has then imposed meaning on the image. This could be said to be the way Antonioni works through his own work as a director. When the photographer goes back to the park to see if the body is there it is to verify the reality of what he has seen in the photos. After he sees the body in the park he then must find someone else in order to verify his view because reality only has meaning in a social context. But then when he goes back to his studio he finds that someone has stolen the photos, and so the evidence of the murder is gone. When he returns to the body in order to photograph the body it also is gone. Now he can't prove that there was a murder. The blown up photos look like one of Bill's abstract paintings where there was no meaning until the artist imposed one on the image, just as Hemming's character too has imposed meaning on the photos he has taken. By blowing up the photos it is as if he has revealed layers under layers to find meaning, but has he found any meaning if he can't now prove it to anyone else? Vanessa Redgrave's character appears again and then disappears. Constantly we are led through this labyrinth where the truth remains elusive. Meaning is shown as only having meaning if it is in a social context as meaning is a social construction. Hemming is never able to verify his reality since he can never get anyone to see the corpse.In the last scene, with the mimes, we have a group of people participating in the illusion of a tennis game which the photographer witnesses. We are shown that the imaginary tennis game has meaning because this group of mimes buy into this reality. Eventually Hemming's character also buys into this reality as he goes to retrieve the imaginary ball that was hit over the fence. Even the camera buys into this reality as it too follows the flight of the imaginary ball which flies over the fence and rolls over the grass. Ultimately Hemming's character disappears which seems to reaffirm that this is the director's reality that he has created.Blow-Up is about these layers of meaning that are constantly being pealed away as if there is no true reality that can be seen since reality is constantly shifting depending on the context or point of view.",5,The labyrinth of realities ....,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,3976,"['Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'Blow-Up', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'photographer', 'film', 'photographer', 'park', 'where', 'photos', 'couple', 'embracing', 'playing', 'later', 'when', 'photos', 'out', 'evidence', 'murder', 'backgrounds', 'photos.The', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'photgrapher', 'film', 'Antonioni', 'who', 'also', 'photographer', 'movie', 'movie', 'when', 'Hemmings', 'photos', 'trying', 'put', 'together', 'reality', 'scene', 'trying', 'impose', 'narrative', 'scene', 'viewed', 'just', 'director', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'creating', 'narrative', 'Can', 'reality', 'ever', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'Here', 'photographer', 'going', 'photo', 'photo', 'order', 'try', 'recreate', 'past', 'moment', 'witnessed', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'are', 'watching', 'scenes', 'sound', 'music', 'haunting', 'heard', 'park', 'leaves', 'trees', 'rustling', 'wind', 'sequences', 'shots', 'marvelous', 'build', 'drama', 'created', 'speculate', 'what', 'going', 'find', 'Eventually', 'find', 'man', 'woods', 'holding', 'gun', 'prevented', 'murder', 'series', 'shots', 'Antonioni', 'genius', 'film', 'making', 'conveyed', 'blowing', 'up', 'few', 'more', 'photos', 'body', 'someone', 'was', 'killed', 'all.There', 'scene', 'important', 'film', 'artist', 'studio', 'who', 'comment', 'often', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'made', 'fact', 'only', 'had', 'time', 'view', 'painting', 'aspect', 'have', 'meaning', 'point', 'then', 'imposed', 'meaning', 'image', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'way', 'Antonioni', 'own', 'work', 'director', 'When', 'photographer', 'back', 'park', 'see', 'body', 'verify', 'reality', 'what', 'seen', 'photos', 'body', 'park', 'then', 'must', 'find', 'someone', 'else', 'order', 'verify', 'view', 'reality', 'only', 'meaning', 'social', 'context', 'then', 'when', 'back', 'studio', 'someone', 'stolen', 'photos', 'so', 'evidence', 'murder', 'gone', 'When', 'body', 'order', 'photograph', 'body', 'also', 'gone', 'Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prove', 'was', 'murder', 'blown', 'up', 'photos', 'look', 'one', 'Bill', 'abstract', 'paintings', 'where', 'was', 'meaning', 'artist', 'imposed', 'one', 'image', 'just', 'Hemming', 'character', 'too', 'imposed', 'meaning', 'photos', 'taken', 'blowing', 'up', 'photos', 'revealed', 'layers', 'layers', 'find', 'meaning', 'found', 'meaning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'now', 'prove', 'anyone', 'else', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'character', 'again', 'then', 'disappears', 'Constantly', 'are', 'led', 'labyrinth', 'where', 'truth', 'elusive', 'Meaning', 'shown', 'only', 'having', 'meaning', 'social', 'context', 'meaning', 'social', 'construction', 'Hemming', 'never', 'able', 'verify', 'reality', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'anyone', 'see', 'corpse.In', 'last', 'scene', 'mimes', 'have', 'group', 'people', 'participating', 'illusion', 'tennis', 'game', 'photographer', 'witnesses', 'are', 'shown', 'imaginary', 'tennis', 'game', 'meaning', 'group', 'mimes', 'buy', 'reality', 'Eventually', 'Hemming', 'character', 'also', 'reality', 'retrieve', 'imaginary', 'ball', 'was', 'hit', 'fence', 'Even', 'camera', 'reality', 'too', 'flight', 'imaginary', 'ball', 'fence', 'rolls', 'grass', 'Ultimately', 'Hemming', 'character', 'reaffirm', 'director', 'reality', 'created.Blow-Up', 'layers', 'meaning', 'are', 'constantly', 'being', 'pealed', 'away', 'true', 'reality', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'reality', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'depending', 'context', 'point', 'view']",N/A

The one thing that is really confusing the hell into me is how is Redgrave casted first? I may know the answer because I remember what Roger Ebert said in his review of ""The New World"" and that is the movie may be about the leading man but it's about the woman. Same thing here-""Blow-Up"" may be about Hemmings' Thomas discovering a murder in his photos but the film is about Redgrave's Jane and that is: What happens when you are an innocent bystander and suddenly you're thrown into the crossfire and how many extreme measures will it take, including sex (which is what Jane does to Thomas) to get back your dignity? The movie was nominated for Best Director and for its screenplay but was not nominated for Best Picture. Imagine that: ""Blow-Up"" being nominated along with the other controversial taboo-breaking film ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (the award went to ""A Man For All Seasons"" which oddly enough, has Vanessa Redgrave in a small role and it also had her brother Corin!) Above all, this movie has to be the next subject for AMC's brilliant show ""Movies That Shook the World."" ""Blow-Up"" and ""Movies That Shook the World"": Sounds like a perfect fit.I just finished up this movie today. That was downright bizarre. There were two things that made my spin: One, the women in this film (Vanessa Redgrave, Jane Birkin, Gillian Hills) don't wear a bra or lingerie when they strip and Two, the last shot in which Thomas (David Hemmings) suddently disappears. That made me wonder: Was this story a dream and a nightmare or was he dead the whole time? (a la Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense"" and when we see Thomas the first time he's coming out of a homeless shelter-a clue that he maybe an angel sent from heaven to find redemption or tour guide to London in the mid-60's). With these two moments it almost gave me bad British teeth just as what Richard Roper said recently on ""Ebert & Roper"" in his review of the British comedy ""Keeping Mum"" with Maggie Smith. Does anyone think Vanessa Redgrave (as Jane) looked like French actress Anouk Aimee with that brown bob wig? As for the murder scene and the dead body, can it be possible that the man is actually Thomas as an old man?

With her special sort of secrecy she built up a profumo-christine-keeler-affair-impression. If one examines Redgraves developing image profile more exactly - alike photographer Thomas (played by David Hemmings) in Michelangelo Antonionis movie is working in the darkroom making blown up photos, then one discovers, that nothing remains as it is in the beginning (and that is the message of ""Blow Up"" too). In the year 1968 she played among other things the legendary dancer Isadora or the sexually tractable Mrs Codrington (in ""The Charge of the Light Brigade""), however 1980 (Playing For Time) she picked out a completely oppositely role: a Jewish survivor of a concentration camp (Julia). The power of pictures is a rapidly changing matter also in the case of Redgrave. This sort of trend-progress encircles the entire identity of an actress, but as a reacting subject with quite strong radiant emittance strength in addition, an actress again can arrange retroacts on the medium profile. It nevertheless surely does not remain without reaction-strength that Vanessa Redgrave strove for roles in films, which were occupied with the cultural heroes of British history so for example with Lord Byron or Churchill. As the sex-crazed, Christ-obsessed Mother Superior fantasising about Oliver Reed in Ken Russell's ""The Devils"" she won her longstanding disapproval of The Vatican. Visiting Fidel Castro (1962) or Yasser Arafat (1972) made two more different sorts of contracting parties. Finally in the film ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" she played a lesbian woman (in the atmosphere around 1961 without any social acceptance), in ""Howard's End"" (and also in ""Little Odessa"") we experience Vanessa as a critically ill, death-nearing person (they didn't need to paint the face largely for this role). A way back to the ""Blow-up""-striptease-performance surely would not be applicable for her today (image reasons), particularly because she briefly had been busy with lesbian ambitions. Nevertheless she is a mother of two daughters (Natasha and Joely Richardson) and one son (Carlo Nero, from a second partnership). In 1990 she argued around for the Marxist British labour party; she appeared in Sarajevo or donated 2002 a large benefaction, in order to support a Czech, anticommunist person, 2004 she agitated like a British counterpart of the US Heroe Jane Fonda against the Iraq war of the Bush administration.

The theme that first Antonioni's English-language film examines is reality vs. perception. We know that seeing is believing but can we always trust ourselves with what we see? Can we explain what we see? The film is as multi-layered as it is puzzling. It is very easy to admire this film and it is difficult to love it - it stimulates the mind but it does not do much for the feelings. The characters appear and disappear mysteriously, sometimes, literally in the thin air - after a while you don't care much what happens to them.Antonioni was able to do what his hero could not - he captured the moment in time. His evidence of the most happening place in the world of the 1960s, the ""Swinging London"" with its cool music, a lot of beautiful girls exquisite like rare exotic flowers, parties, night clubs, Yardbirds performance, David Hemming in his white jeans looking like blond Paul McCartney, will not be destroyed and won't disappear like the pictures of the possible murder in the film did.",4,Dangerous Power of Images in 'Swinging London',1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,1118,"['Blow', 'Up', '1966', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'artful', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'meditation', 'manipulation', 'images', 'theme', 'first', 'Antonioni', 'English-language', 'film', 'examines', 'reality', 'vs.', 'perception', 'know', 'seeing', 'believing', 'can', 'always', 'trust', 'what', 'see', 'Can', 'explain', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'as', 'multi-layered', 'puzzling', 'very', 'easy', 'admire', 'film', 'difficult', 'love', 'mind', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'feelings', 'characters', 'appear', 'disappear', 'mysteriously', 'sometimes', 'literally', 'thin', 'air', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'what', 'them.Antonioni', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'hero', 'could', 'not', 'captured', 'moment', 'time', 'evidence', 'most', 'happening', 'place', 'world', '1960s', 'Swinging', 'London', 'cool', 'music', 'lot', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'exquisite', 'rare', 'exotic', 'flowers', 'parties', 'night', 'clubs', 'Yardbirds', 'performance', 'David', 'Hemming', 'white', 'jeans', 'looking', 'blond', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'destroyed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappear', 'pictures', 'possible', 'murder', 'film', 'did']",N/A
276610,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301966015,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 7]","Few directors are as divisive as Michelangelo Antonioni, best known as creator of the 1961 L'AVVENTURA and the 1966 BLOW UP, both of which present largely unresolved mysteries in order to make thematic statements.  In the case of BLOW UP, which is easily Antonioni's best English-language film, the unresolved story is one of a possible murder captured by accident on film; the themes involved are those of reality, illusion, and the distractions that prevent us from seeing the difference between the two.Thomas (David Hemmings) is an obnoxious, self-centered London photographer who alternates between fashion and art photography.  In search of a tranquil subject to counterpoint an otherwise dark collection of photographs, he takes several photographs of a couple in an otherwise empty park---and is unconcerned when the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) pursues him to his to studio to demand the negatives.  Thomas agrees to give them to her, but secretly switches rolls of film; later, when he develops the photographs, he is startled to find he may have photographed a murder.The film is perhaps most memorable for its disturbing sense of irony.  Near the beginning of the film Thomas is plagued by two would-be models; he escapes them by visiting an antique shop and then wanders into the nearby park.  As the film progresses, he finds his meeting with the unwillingly-photographed woman interrupted by the delivery of a purchase he made at that antique shop; still later, and now aroused by the mysterious woman, he is once more visited by the would-be models and has sex with them---an incident that delays his inspection of the photographs and effectively derails him from receiving assistance from various friends who are now themselves distracted by sex and drugs.  Each detail coils back upon itself in a series of frustrating interruptions, driving Thomas in directions that repeatedly delay any action he might take that could answer his questions, much less solve the riddle.The greatest irony is that we are watching pictures of a photographer taking pictures, and indeed much of the film involves looking at pictures of pictures of pictures without any clear indication of whether or not anything we see is actually real---which is, of course, exactly the nature of the illusion a movie creates.  That said, if you come to film expecting a murder mystery with a neatly explained solution, you are in for a rude shock: BLOW UP is not ""about"" plot; it is about how difficult it is to know anything factual from a medium that is intrinsically illusionary in the first place.  Not only is the nature of film as a medium the movie's greatest irony, it is also probably it's ultimate statement.BLOW UP really is a film that tends to jack people's jaws all over the place, partly because it defeats their expectations in terms of character and plot, but more specifically because it is so open-ended that you can pretty much impose any meaning upon it that you like.  Was there a man with a gun---or was it just a trick of the light?  Was there a murder---or was it something else?  And if so, what?  And what does it all mean at the end?  But there are no fixed ""meanings"" in the film at all, and if you want a strong storyline with clear-cut ideas, well, you're out of luck here.  So no, BLOW UP isn't a film for every one.  It will most greatly appeal to people with a fondness for European cinema and art movies.The DVD presently available is at best acceptable; it would be really nice to see this film given the royal treatement by a company such as Criterion.  In any case, recommended to as a masterpiece of the ""art house"" kind.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,You Can't Photograph People Like That: The Controversial Art House Masterpiece,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,3661,"['Few', 'directors', 'are', 'as', 'divisive', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'best', 'known', 'creator', '1961', ""L'AVVENTURA"", '1966', 'BLOW', 'UP', 'present', 'largely', 'unresolved', 'mysteries', 'order', 'make', 'thematic', 'statements', 'case', 'BLOW', 'UP', 'easily', 'Antonioni', 'best', 'English-language', 'film', 'unresolved', 'story', 'one', 'possible', 'murder', 'captured', 'accident', 'film', 'themes', 'involved', 'are', 'reality', 'illusion', 'distractions', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'difference', 'two.Thomas', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'obnoxious', 'self-centered', 'London', 'photographer', 'who', 'fashion', 'art', 'photography', 'search', 'tranquil', 'subject', 'counterpoint', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'collection', 'photographs', 'several', 'photographs', 'couple', 'otherwise', 'empty', 'park', '-and', 'unconcerned', 'when', 'woman', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'studio', 'demand', 'negatives', 'Thomas', 'give', 'secretly', 'rolls', 'film', 'later', 'when', 'photographs', 'startled', 'find', 'may', 'have', 'photographed', 'murder.The', 'film', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'disturbing', 'sense', 'irony', 'beginning', 'film', 'Thomas', 'plagued', 'two', 'would-be', 'models', 'visiting', 'antique', 'shop', 'then', 'wanders', 'nearby', 'park', 'film', 'meeting', 'unwillingly-photographed', 'woman', 'interrupted', 'delivery', 'purchase', 'made', 'antique', 'shop', 'still', 'later', 'now', 'aroused', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'once', 'more', 'visited', 'would-be', 'models', 'sex', '-an', 'incident', 'inspection', 'photographs', 'effectively', 'receiving', 'assistance', 'various', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'distracted', 'sex', 'drugs', 'detail', 'back', 'upon', 'series', 'frustrating', 'interruptions', 'driving', 'Thomas', 'directions', 'repeatedly', 'delay', 'action', 'might', 'take', 'could', 'answer', 'questions', 'much', 'less', 'solve', 'riddle.The', 'greatest', 'irony', 'are', 'watching', 'pictures', 'photographer', 'taking', 'pictures', 'indeed', 'much', 'film', 'looking', 'pictures', 'pictures', 'pictures', 'clear', 'indication', 'not', 'anything', 'see', 'actually', 'real', '-which', 'course', 'exactly', 'nature', 'illusion', 'movie', 'said', 'come', 'film', 'expecting', 'murder', 'mystery', 'neatly', 'explained', 'solution', 'are', 'rude', 'shock', 'BLOW', 'UP', 'not', 'plot', 'how', 'difficult', 'know', 'anything', 'factual', 'medium', 'intrinsically', 'illusionary', 'first', 'place', 'Not', 'only', 'nature', 'film', 'medium', 'movie', 'greatest', 'irony', 'also', 'probably', 'ultimate', 'statement.BLOW', 'UP', 'really', 'film', 'jack', 'people', 'jaws', 'place', 'partly', 'expectations', 'terms', 'character', 'plot', 'more', 'specifically', 'so', 'open-ended', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'impose', 'meaning', 'like', 'Was', 'man', 'gun', '-or', 'was', 'just', 'trick', 'light', 'Was', 'murder', '-or', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'so', 'what', 'what', 'mean', 'end', 'are', 'fixed', 'meanings', 'film', 'want', 'strong', 'storyline', 'clear-cut', 'ideas', 'well', ""'re"", 'luck', 'here', 'So', 'no', 'BLOW', 'UP', ""n't"", 'film', 'one', 'will', 'most', 'greatly', 'appeal', 'people', 'fondness', 'European', 'cinema', 'art', 'movies.The', 'DVD', 'presently', 'available', 'best', 'acceptable', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'given', 'royal', 'treatement', 'company', 'such', 'Criterion', 'case', 'recommended', 'masterpiece', 'art', 'house', 'kind.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A
276611,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,6301966015,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[3, 4]","BLOW UP (1966) was Michelangelo Antonioni's second color film, and his first in English. Interestingly it was his first film that had a male protagonist. He is considered the master of abstract cinema, and this film continues in that vein. The cinematography was presented in very abstract ways, with most shots framed oddly, blocked by beams, banisters, photographic equipment, windows, and furniture. The camera made no effort to clear these objects in order for us to see the actors. Primary reds were the dominant colors, and in London that seemed easy, passing the double-decker buses and phone booths and pubs, all painted blood red. He painted one apartment building bright blue just for the contrast.Swinging London of the Mods in the mid-60's seemed so wonderfully dated, captured in  its spectacle. Those beehive hair-dos and mini-skirts, smoking that demon joint, the beginnings of the British invasion, that hard rock sound presented in the film by the Yardbirds, the first stages of long hair on men, and the casual way nudity and promiscuity is handled; all old hat to us now, but very brazen then.I loved the way Antonioni gave us the skewed perspective of an unnamed photographer snapping candid shots of a young couple in the park, while the director shot him doing so; an overlapping sense of three perspectives. What the movie camera saw was not exactly what was snapped by the photographer. I loved the parallel of the photographer hopping over the low fence to hide in the bushes to shoot some shots, and then later discovering in exactly the same pose and framed shot, the sniper, the killer, behind the fence in the bushes. And of course the obvious parallels of the artist's abstract paintings, just so many random dots of color, until he capped the painting with some point of view, some detail that drew it all together -and the blow ups themselves, those photos of photos, with pixels blown up so large that they too look like abstract paintings to be interpreted.Some have argued that the park represented Nature versus the pandemonium of the city, and yet what is a park? It is just an artificial large garden planted in the middle, or on the edge of a city, and it ""represents"" nature. We go there and have picnics or our lattes and imagine that we are off in the forest or field. This illusionary concept is important to Antonioni. Add to this the sense of each of us remaining strangers midst the teeming masses. The photographer and the mystery lady (David Hemmings and Vanessa Redgrave) both remain nameless. People seem to know them, but never refer to them by their name; very existential. It has been suggested that the director gave us several plot lines that were never meant to make sense, like the antique store scenes; and yet that would be a place that a photographer might haunt. His suggestions that his agent would bid on the store, that he might be a real estate speculator is never explored. Unlike a real photographer who asks permission to shoot a subject, Hemmings always shot secretly; even in the opening scenes, where he pretended to be homeless to shoot those old men in the shelter. Then there is the issue as to what was reality. Hemmings thinks he saw a corpse in the park when he visited it again, and yet he was not carrying his ever present camera. Why not? It seems to suggest that any of us alone witnessing something has no validity. We must find another human being to collaborate our find, to verify our conclusions.Then the director gave us the ""Merry Makers"", the 8-10 Mimes that traveled around in an open jalopy, panhandling and performing, providing a prologue and epilogue. Their wordless game of tennis became the most ""real"" thing the photographer encountered, as he accepted their non-reality.

I took some film classes years ago, and all the ""professors"" were raving about Antonioni, and this film in particular.  They talked about what everything means, the ""symbolism"", the deeper meanings.  They were determined to take out all the joy of the film before I even saw it.Now that I've been out of school, I've forgotten all the BS they spewed, and I like Antonioni's work.  This is a great film, as great as its reputation suggests.  Antonioni is one of a small number of filmmakers who immersed himself entirely in a different culture (in this case, Swinging London), and made a film worthy of it (some examples of this phenomenon are Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice, and recently, Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima).  If you didn't know that Antonioni was Italian, you would have sworn the film was directed by an Englishman.  It's a unique, fascinating piece of cinema.  There isn't much dialogue, but most of it is pretty good.  It has some great setpieces, including The Yardbirds' concert at the end, the tennis game, the walk in the park, the ""wrestling"" scene, and the ""blow up"" scene.  At the end of the film, you're not sure what happened, but you know something did.  It's really an exceptional, thought provoking film, one of the best films of the 1960's and one of the most successful art films ever made.

276614,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6301966015,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[5, 6]","A strange film by Michelangelo Antonioni. It is a whole period of our life that is coming back. 1966. They dressed bizarre in those days. They behave slightly crazy too. The world was entering the new phase or virtuality. The cold war was a virtual war secreting a virtual peace. The long dreamed for well-off comfort was coming up for the few, the happy few who could follow a track that took them away from the factories. Cars were introducing virtual independence. The new generation of records and turntables and record players was bringing some quite acceptable sound home: virtual music. And real music was not better with all the amplifiers and the loudspeakers: virtual music again. Even life itself was becoming virtual due to the new cameras and the new photography, so fine that even the smallest detail became visible in this virtual life of the photograph. And when the camera caught a body, a crime, a murder, it was only virtual and the body only existed as long as the pictures existed. When the pictures were stolen and destroyed, then the body disappeared. It had only been a virtual body. And even tennis became virtual, with no balls, with no rackets, just the movements and the setting and you could have a tennis game even with no partner at all: virtual tennis. Just like a plane became virtual by being reduced to one propeller, the promise of movement, of flying. Before 1968 and after the real nightmare of the second world war everything turned virtual, the way it had never been before and the best symbol of that virtuality was the camera and its pictures that were so true and yet so virtual. You will enter this film just the way you enter a dream: convinced it is true and yet knowing it is an illusion and when you come out of it your head will still be full with the noise and the fury of that dream where everything true is lived again and yet it is distorted in such a way that it is no longer anything at all.

The film, in any case, focuses on a single day's adventure in the life a photographer named Thomas whom we first meet exiting a shelter for homeless men in London. He has just spent the night and early morning there--in cognito--taking pictures for a book of black and white photography. Leaving the shelter, he quickly returns to his studio where he has a morning and afternoon of fashion photography to do. But bored, he sneaks from the studio to visit an antique shop. He wants to buy it but when he can't find the owner, he steps outside and--ostensibly to kill time--begins to shoot a roll of film. He eventually wanders up a path and into a park where he spies a young woman and an older man, whom he begins to photograph from behind a fence. As he moves from the fence to one tree and another, the young woman eventually spots him and, in a panic, comes running to ask that he hand over the film. He refuses. And later, when he returns to the studio, she's mysteriously there to greet him. His curiosity piqued, he decides to develop the film. At first glance, there doesn't appear to be anything unusual or remarkable about the photos or the lovers. But, upon blowing up the pictures, he suddenly sees something odd in their embrace. The woman appears to be staring--purposely--to the side. She is staring at the bushes which, in the black and white grain of the enlargement, seem to hide something just a little more solid than the blur of the surrounding foliage. Is it a person? A voyeur, perhaps? A conspirator? Thomas blows up the photos again and again--and then again--and as they grow grainier, less definite, they also grow more suggestive. Finally, in the last series of enlargements--pushed to an informational extreme--a horizontal flare appears against so many dark islands that once read as grass and leaves. It may be the older man lying beneath a bush--dead. Stunned by the seeming revelation, Thomas will spend the rest of the film trying to make sense of what he has or hasn't witnessed (through an eye that is not his own) and trying to get someone--anyone--to listen and believe. But he will only find the impossibility of doing so in a world that seems more and more and more a loose string of unrelated events, a succession of verbal and visual non-sequitors that lead him to doubt--not so much what he has seen--but what it might possibly have meant.Antonioni is a great formalist. He is renowned for the graphic beauty of his images, the collision of planes, aesthetically wrecked around the random advances of aimless, lonesome characters. In fact, the visual composition almost always overwhelms the character or characters figuring in the shot. It is impossible to enter into their thought because everything, including the characters, is pushed flat. There is only surface--no third dimension where some revealing instant might await discovery. But it is this very strangeness, the muted metallic colors, the broken narrative, the wonder-inviting quiet and,finally, the vagueness that evoke mystery. The technique stands in for the statement; we are offered only a succession of impressions, like so many subtly graded glazes over the surface of an otherwise finished painting. And the serried wash of sensations underscores the way we attempt to give meaning to random elements that eventually dissolve into their original meaning-indifferent configurations.",5,Blow-up: meaning-indifferent configurations,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,3571,"['Blow-Up', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Argentine', 'writer', 'Julio', 'Cortazar', 'work', 'was', 'once', 'one', 'staples', 'modern', 'literature', 'courses', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'film', 'case', 'single', 'day', 'adventure', 'life', 'photographer', 'named', 'Thomas', 'whom', 'first', 'meet', 'exiting', 'shelter', 'homeless', 'men', 'London', 'just', 'spent', 'night', 'early', 'morning', 'there', 'cognito', 'taking', 'pictures', 'book', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'Leaving', 'shelter', 'quickly', 'studio', 'where', 'morning', 'afternoon', 'fashion', 'photography', 'do', 'bored', 'studio', 'visit', 'antique', 'shop', 'buy', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'owner', 'outside', 'ostensibly', 'kill', 'time', 'shoot', 'roll', 'film', 'eventually', 'up', 'path', 'park', 'where', 'young', 'woman', 'older', 'man', 'whom', 'photograph', 'fence', 'fence', 'one', 'tree', 'young', 'woman', 'eventually', 'spots', 'panic', 'running', 'ask', 'hand', 'film', 'later', 'when', 'studio', 'mysteriously', 'there', 'greet', 'curiosity', 'piqued', 'develop', 'film', 'first', 'glance', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'anything', 'unusual', 'remarkable', 'photos', 'lovers', 'blowing', 'up', 'pictures', 'suddenly', 'something', 'odd', 'embrace', 'woman', 'be', 'staring', 'purposely', 'side', 'staring', 'bushes', 'black', 'white', 'grain', 'enlargement', 'seem', 'hide', 'something', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'solid', 'blur', 'surrounding', 'foliage', 'person', 'voyeur', 'perhaps', 'conspirator', 'Thomas', 'up', 'photos', 'again', 'again', 'then', 'again', 'grow', 'grainier', 'less', 'definite', 'also', 'grow', 'more', 'suggestive', 'Finally', 'last', 'series', 'enlargements', 'pushed', 'informational', 'extreme', 'horizontal', 'flare', 'so', 'many', 'dark', 'islands', 'once', 'read', 'grass', 'may', 'be', 'older', 'man', 'lying', 'bush', 'dead', 'Stunned', 'seeming', 'revelation', 'Thomas', 'will', 'spend', 'rest', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'what', ""n't"", 'witnessed', 'eye', 'not', 'own', 'trying', 'get', 'someone', 'anyone', 'listen', 'believe', 'will', 'only', 'find', 'impossibility', 'doing', 'so', 'world', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'loose', 'string', 'unrelated', 'events', 'succession', 'verbal', 'visual', 'non-sequitors', 'lead', 'doubt', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'seen', 'what', 'might', 'possibly', 'have', 'meant.Antonioni', 'great', 'formalist', 'renowned', 'graphic', 'beauty', 'images', 'collision', 'planes', 'aesthetically', 'wrecked', 'random', 'advances', 'aimless', 'lonesome', 'characters', 'fact', 'visual', 'composition', 'almost', 'always', 'overwhelms', 'character', 'characters', 'figuring', 'shot', 'impossible', 'enter', 'thought', 'everything', 'including', 'characters', 'pushed', 'flat', 'only', 'surface', 'third', 'dimension', 'where', 'revealing', 'instant', 'might', 'await', 'discovery', 'very', 'strangeness', 'muted', 'metallic', 'colors', 'broken', 'narrative', 'wonder-inviting', 'quiet', 'finally', 'vagueness', 'evoke', 'mystery', 'technique', 'statement', 'are', 'offered', 'only', 'succession', 'impressions', 'so', 'many', 'subtly', 'graded', 'glazes', 'surface', 'otherwise', 'finished', 'painting', 'serried', 'wash', 'sensations', 'underscores', 'way', 'attempt', 'give', 'meaning', 'random', 'elements', 'eventually', 'dissolve', 'original', 'meaning-indifferent', 'configurations']",N/A

276625,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6301966015,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 4]","""Blowup"" was the English-language debut of already famous Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni, was a massive success upon it's release, still ends up on lists of Great movies, but is rarely seen by today's audiences. Sad, since this is a great movie. It's great because it leads us into a plot where we think we know what's going to happen, then it doesn't. Not only does IT not happen. Nothing really happens. It deserves comparison to Antonioni's ""L'Aventurra"" a movie in which a character disappears, setting up a mystery about what happened to her. Instead, that's it right there. She disappears and is never heard from again. In this movie, a photographer believes he has witnessed a murder and, at one point, even sees the corpse. But did he really witness a murder? Did he even really see a corpse? Is it a dream? This movie actually (something I've never heard anyone mention) seems to be an inspiration to filmmakers like David Lynch; We're presented with images that don't really make sense, but intrigue us nonetheless and don't take away from the story. David Hemmings plays Thomas, a popular London photographer, who spends his days taking photographs of ""birds"" who crowd outside wanting to get their pictures taken and, possibly, seduce him. Thomas isn't a particularly likeable guy; He holds an unexplained contempt for women and is rude to people around him. One day, while walking through a park, he spots a woman (Vanessa Redgrave) and a man and begins lurking around taking pictures of them. This scene gives us no hint of what he's going to encounter later. As he takes pictures of this woman and man, the woman spots him and chases after him. She asks Thomas to give her the film, but he declines and leaves. When he gets back to his apartment/studio, she appears. She takes off her shirt, tries to seduce him, he succumbs and gives her the film, and, finally, she leaves...She leaves, of course, with the wrong film and as soon as she's gone...Thomas develops the pictures. After a quick interlude, in which he has a sexual romp with two women who want their pictures take, he returns to the photographs and notices something odd. He blows the photos up, does it again, and then begins to believe he has witnessed a murder. There appears to be a gunman hiding in some bushes, the woman appears to be looking towards him, and finally he appears to have photographed a corpse. The pictures are abstract, but seem clear enough. He returns to the park later that night and sees a corpse...This scene is completely misleading. This isn't a shot where he appears to see a corpse in the distance, to make the audience ask themselves""Does he really see it?"" There's a close-up of the corpse that seems to leave no other conclusion except that there is one. Then we get a haunting scene where he stops his car in front of a club and sees the woman standing there. She turns, takes a couple steps, and is gone. She literally disappears into thin air. By the end of the film, we realize that the murder isn't even the point of the film. Odd since that's exactly what the movie leads us to believe almost to the final shot. And the final shot is a great one. If you've seen a movie by Antonioni (I've seen L'Aventurra and The Passenger), then you know that he's not a director that cuts to the chase. He paces his film very slowly. So slow, some people have called his films dull. This movie is not dull; it's fascinating...Whether you have any idea what's going on or not. It's not an extremely entertaining movie, but I didn't find it dull or boring and I frequently found myself glued to the screen. I'd have to watch the other two again to be sure, but as of now I'd say this is my favorite Antonioni film.GRADE: A-",5,"All Buildup, No Pay Off...Still a Masterpiece",1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,3735,"['Blowup', 'was', 'English-language', 'debut', 'already', 'famous', 'Italian', 'filmmaker', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'was', 'massive', 'success', 'release', 'still', 'up', 'lists', 'Great', 'movies', 'rarely', 'seen', 'today', 'audiences', 'Sad', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'plot', 'where', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'then', ""n't"", 'Not', 'only', 'IT', 'not', 'happen', 'Nothing', 'really', 'comparison', 'Antonioni', ""L'Aventurra"", 'movie', 'character', 'setting', 'up', 'mystery', 'what', 'happened', 'Instead', 'right', 'there', 'never', 'heard', 'again', 'movie', 'photographer', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'corpse', 'did', 'really', 'witness', 'murder', 'Did', 'even', 'really', 'see', 'corpse', 'dream', 'movie', 'actually', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'anyone', 'mention', 'be', 'inspiration', 'filmmakers', 'David', 'Lynch', ""'re"", 'presented', 'images', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'intrigue', 'nonetheless', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'story', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'Thomas', 'popular', 'London', 'photographer', 'who', 'days', 'taking', 'photographs', 'birds', 'who', 'crowd', 'wanting', 'get', 'pictures', 'taken', 'possibly', 'seduce', 'Thomas', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'likeable', 'guy', 'unexplained', 'contempt', 'women', 'rude', 'people', 'One', 'day', 'walking', 'park', 'spots', 'woman', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'man', 'lurking', 'taking', 'pictures', 'scene', 'hint', 'what', 'going', 'encounter', 'later', 'pictures', 'woman', 'man', 'woman', 'spots', 'chases', 'Thomas', 'give', 'film', 'leaves', 'When', 'back', 'apartment/studio', 'shirt', 'tries', 'seduce', 'film', 'finally', 'course', 'wrong', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'gone', 'Thomas', 'pictures', 'quick', 'interlude', 'sexual', 'romp', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'want', 'pictures', 'take', 'photographs', 'notices', 'something', 'odd', 'photos', 'up', 'again', 'then', 'believe', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'be', 'gunman', 'hiding', 'bushes', 'woman', 'be', 'looking', 'finally', 'have', 'photographed', 'corpse', 'pictures', 'are', 'abstract', 'seem', 'clear', 'enough', 'park', 'later', 'night', 'corpse', 'scene', 'completely', 'misleading', ""n't"", 'shot', 'where', 'see', 'corpse', 'distance', 'make', 'audience', 'ask', 'really', 'see', 'close-up', 'corpse', 'leave', 'other', 'conclusion', 'one', 'Then', 'get', 'haunting', 'scene', 'where', 'car', 'front', 'club', 'woman', 'standing', 'there', 'couple', 'steps', 'gone', 'literally', 'thin', 'air', 'end', 'film', 'realize', 'murder', ""n't"", 'even', 'point', 'film', 'Odd', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'believe', 'almost', 'final', 'shot', 'final', 'shot', 'great', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Antonioni', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""L'Aventurra"", 'Passenger', 'then', 'know', 'not', 'director', 'chase', 'film', 'very', 'slowly', 'So', 'slow', 'people', 'have', 'called', 'films', 'dull', 'movie', 'not', 'dull', 'fascinating', 'Whether', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'not', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'dull', 'boring', 'frequently', 'found', 'glued', 'screen', ""'d"", 'have', 'watch', 'other', 'two', 'again', 'be', 'sure', 'now', ""'d"", 'say', 'favorite', 'Antonioni', 'film.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Oh, the actual blowing up of the photographs is still neat and creepy, for sure, but the rest is just laughable.The nameless photographer is such a jerk (I'm being delicate) that no one would want to work with him. There are other photographers with talent - why do business with a total jerk that yells at you to try to get you to smile?Also the funny thing is, even when he is supposedly taking these great photos in his jerky way, he is so close to his subject that 90% of the pix would be out of focus, compounded by not using flash, so he must shoot wide open even with Tri-X film, thereby adding to his out-of-focus problem. Further, he handles his Hasselblad clumsily, and during a shoot with several models at various distances from the camera, again he does not use flash - again, laughable photographic technique. Enough about photo non-technique.Another scene has the photographer entering a nightclub where Jimmy Page and the Yardbirds are playing - and the entire audience is motionless - as in zombies - except one couple who dance (badly).

But, while it's clear how influential it was on other film-makers, for me it feels more dated and awkward than Antonioni's earlier films. I know, I'm probably in the minority on this one.Antonioni switches back and forth between 'plot' and abandoning it to shoot a now tame and silly three-way sex sequence, or a rock group stiffly performing. (Yes, that arbitrariness is part of the point, but its a simple point we get pretty quickly). There is that great sequence in the middle, when Hemmings starts to 'discover' the hidden images in the photos he took, but other than that sequence, this didn't have the visual brilliance of other Antonioni films that offset the sometimes simplistic characters and ideas.That's a running feeling I have about Antononi - he's often simply judging the 'shallowness' of society and his characters instead of getting inside it, And he repeats himself on that theme obsessively. It's also sort of hypocritical. Clearly, Antonioni is judging his character's obsession with sex and material things, yet just as clearly Antonioni panders to those instincts with the endless sex and modeling, and 'cool. mod London' scenes. I'm sure he'd say that's the whole point; we're all that shallow underneath, but...To be fair, many (most?) still think it's a masterpiece.

Pleasure seemed to be sought in every corner, as Puritanical values once had held down the societal freedom to express self, while a new bohemian period was emerging.  Philosophy in regards to everything was pondered as nudity emerged as an art form as well as an exploitation.  French New Wave had already influenced the world as had the dreamy visions of Fellini, psychosocial introspection of Bergman, and philosophy behind human choices in Antonioni's films such as L' Avventura (1960).  The world was about to explode into a colorful spectacle as artistic freedom and expression were pushing the boundaries of censorship and moral value.  In the middle of the cultural anarchy, a story about a photographer helped pushing the boundaries, which was one of the milestones that was needed for artists and alike as they sought true freedom.Blow-Up focuses on what is within each frame of each scene, which is also how the film's hero, Thomas (David Hemmings), sees the world.  Thomas is a successful photographer, in a monetary way, as he drives a Rolls Royce convertible, donates money, has a big studio, and has several photo shoots with beautiful models.  Yet, Thomas does not like the job as a model photographer, as many of his models seem to be oblivious to what he is trying to accomplish while capturing the aesthetics of the moment.  The photographic moment must be caught as if the camera was not there, however, it seems as if many models lack this knowledge or understanding.  This ignorance comes across as an insult to Thomas whenever someone stands in front of his camera, which seems to put him in a severely bad mood.  Nonetheless, he lives to see what he captures through the lens as he brings the camera wherever he travels.There are a selected few models that know how to pose properly for Thomas in order to create an aesthetically emotional moment that enhances the texture of the image, which Thomas attempts to capture.  In the beginning of the film Thomas returns to his studio dressed in rags while a stunning model is waiting for the photo shoot with him.  The model is barely dressed--just enough to cover up her personal parts.  Thomas begins the shoot as the model moves seductively and he is slowly drawn to her, as seaman would to the singing of a siren.  Closer and closer Thomas gets until they seem to merge into one.  The scene is very suggestive in a sexual manner, which seems to please both.  The model effortlessly repositions herself in enticing manners as Thomas provides her with admiring comments that urges her to continue with her visual seduction through the lens.Thomas' true passion for his profession is to capture the present time where the truth is revealed, which is done in all places of life.  The truth seems to be the way a person genuinely appears in solitude.  Thus, a voyeuristic portion of Thomas appears as he seeks to see the world the way it is without him being present.  An early morning Thomas ventures to see his agent, but stops by an antique store.  Nearby the small antique store there is a small path that leads to a park where he discovers a couple, a woman and an older man.  The couple appears to be of some sort of relation to one another, yet it is difficult to see exactly what the couple is doing.  They could be hugging and kissing, yet they could be arguing.  Thomas takes cover by trees and bush while he captures the ambiguous moment with his camera.  The true nature of the couple will be revealed later through the photos that Thomas develops in his darkroom.Symbiosis seems to exist between Thomas and the camera as Thomas seems to need the camera as the camera needs him in order to be used.  There is an emotional distance between Thomas and reality as the camera seems to be the boundary of moral judgment.  The camera offers him an opportunity to observe the world at a safe distance, yet he can partake in what he sees.  The safety truly appears when the audience notices the difference between when the picture was taken and when the picture is viewed, as time and place change and leave him at a safe distance from the truth.  Time and place appear to be the divider that is provided to Thomas through the camera, which offers him a safe role in his photographic society without responsibilities, or guilt.  It also offers him the opportunity to relive a moment, or an experience.  Similar notion could be drawn to the experiences that the audience can revive in many museums throughout the world where emotions such as desire, fear, sadness, happiness, joy, and more seem to be trapped in time and place.Michelangelo Antonioni does a marvelous job directing as each scene offers something for the audience to ponder.  Compared to L' Avventura (1960) Blow-Up provides a similar drifty theme, which at times seems to wander aimlessly.  Nonetheless, the context in which Blow-Up takes place is unique and despite its directionless touch most scenes seem to be perfectly choreographed together with the outwardly meticulous mise-en-scene.  This provides a sense of natural beauty that Antonioni captures through the camera.  In addition, the natural beauty offers the concept that there is beauty everywhere, and it most certainly surrounds all viewers too, which should be captured and revived when needed.  Blow-Up offers a truly artistic perspective, which could be found tedious for many, however, it is what encourages the processes of contemplation as Thomas is devoured by his passion.  Thus, let the artists have their freedom as the audience longs to experience the stored sentiments, which offers morals and enlightening lessons.",5,Artistic Perspective on Cameras Distortion of Time

I also think the teeny philosophical thread of perception and reality in the film is just that;  barely tenable.  I guess what I am trying to say is that the film is more hype and not even that fun.

Interwoven into this quagmire of sleeping souls is a  non-plot about perception and the &quot;nothing is what it seems&quot;  theory that ranks up there with Roeg in content if not pizzazz, and that  went on to have its bones picked by Coppola and DePalma in &quot;The  Conversation&quot; and &quot;Blow Out&quot; respectively.BLOW UP is a  curious time capsule: we see the incursion of the middle East into London,  fashions so old they look new; Herbie Hancock's still-hip organ-based jazz  themes which have already been redone by acid jazz groups and sampled by  Dee-Lite; Veruschka looking very svelte and sexy; and David Hemmings as  handsome as he would ever be.

276634,A270XXONKJ2BAU,6301966015,mackjay,"[9, 10]","There is at least one big misconception about BLOW-UP: it's not a film 'about' swinging 60s London, as it is usually characterized. It's not a critique or condemnation of that 'scene'. Antonioni--although his roots are in documentary--tends to use locations for their visual impact and whatever moods they may invoke and not, at least in his films of the 60s, to make political statements. He chooses the fashion scene of London because of its preoccupation with surface (literal surface, appearance) and with a primary-color palette. Thomas the photographer, (David Hemmings) seems to function as an 'artist' in this scene--recording the surface effect of what he sees--but he is very clearly not engaged with it artistically. It's something he does by rote, offhandedly and very importantly, without PASSION (as a number of famous scenes show. Ironically, these brief scenes of sexual titillation were exploited to sell the film as 'erotic', the very opposite of their intention within the context of the film).The director had much of Thomas's neighborhood in the film repainted to intensify the bright, primary color scheme. A scheme in which red seems to dominate, but not symbolically. Red (as well as blue) just identifies Thomas's milieu. When the photographer goes into the park, he enters a world of green. Beautiful, almost intoxicating green (a real feature of the DVD transfer, by the way, is the brilliance of the color in this film). Green connects obviously to nature, even in a park landscaped by city planners. But, again, it's not really symbolic (Antonioni does not tend to use symbolism in any conventional sense, if at all, until perhaps the end of this film). Rather, green establishes this alternate environment where Thomas will make a significant discovery.Earlier in the film, we meet Thomas's neighbor, a painter named Bill (John Castle) who introduces the notion of looking at a work of art and seeing something in it after it's complete (he demonstrates this in his own painting). When Thomas develops his photos of Redgrave and her presumed lover in the park, he begins to notice other details that are far more interesting. This leads to an investigation that sort of encapsulates, or stands in for the long wandering segments of Antonioni's previous films: a gradual uncovering of some kind of knowledge or truth. What does Thomas discover? Perhaps that there's something under the surface of life that we don't want to think about, rushing around in our driven lives; perhaps it's mortality, or just something that SEEMS to be serious and important. When he pursues the investigation by going to see the actual body, the film takes on an almost sinister aspect. There is something primitive and slightly disturbing about the nearly silent scene of Thomas finding the body, accompanied only by the soft rustling of wind through the trees. He's shaken by it. But importantly, the whole experience has awakened a passion in him, not so much as an artist but as a human being. When the body has disappeared on his second visit, Thomas seems deeply disillusioned. Was any of this real? Does it matter if it was or not? But for a brief moment this jaded young man cared about something that did appear to be serious and important. The encounter with the mimes at film's end actually does seem symbolic, and it's a fairly obvious move on this director's part. Here's where it all gets so subjective. It's deliberately up for grabs: what, if anything , do the mimes stand for? Why does Thomas join their game and then disappear? To some, it's a surrender to the illusory nature of being, so complete that he no longer needs to even exist himself.The DVD issue of BLOW-UP looks extremely good. The sheer visual beauty of the colors and images really gets its due. There is a critical commentary that leaves more questions than it answers and is among the least useful recorded for a challenging film of this kind.",5,What May Lie Beneath the Surface of Life,1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,3938,"['least', 'one', 'big', 'misconception', 'BLOW-UP', 'not', 'film', 'swinging', '60s', 'London', 'usually', 'characterized', 'not', 'critique', 'condemnation', ""'scene"", 'Antonioni', 'roots', 'are', 'documentary', 'tends', 'use', 'locations', 'visual', 'impact', 'moods', 'may', 'invoke', 'not', 'least', 'films', '60s', 'make', 'political', 'statements', 'fashion', 'scene', 'London', 'preoccupation', 'surface', 'literal', 'surface', 'appearance', 'primary-color', 'palette', 'Thomas', 'photographer', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'function', ""'artist"", 'scene', 'recording', 'surface', 'effect', 'what', 'very', 'clearly', 'not', 'engaged', 'artistically', 'something', 'rote', 'offhandedly', 'very', 'importantly', 'PASSION', 'number', 'famous', 'scenes', 'show', 'Ironically', 'brief', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'titillation', 'were', 'exploited', 'sell', 'film', ""'erotic"", 'very', 'opposite', 'intention', 'context', 'film', '.The', 'director', 'had', 'much', 'Thomas', 'neighborhood', 'film', 'repainted', 'intensify', 'bright', 'primary', 'color', 'scheme', 'scheme', 'red', 'dominate', 'not', 'symbolically', 'Red', 'as', 'well', 'blue', 'just', 'Thomas', 'milieu', 'When', 'photographer', 'park', 'world', 'green', 'Beautiful', 'almost', 'intoxicating', 'green', 'real', 'feature', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'way', 'brilliance', 'color', 'film', 'Green', 'connects', 'obviously', 'nature', 'even', 'park', 'landscaped', 'city', 'planners', 'again', 'not', 'really', 'symbolic', 'Antonioni', 'not', 'tend', 'use', 'symbolism', 'conventional', 'sense', 'perhaps', 'end', 'film', 'Rather', 'green', 'establishes', 'alternate', 'environment', 'where', 'Thomas', 'will', 'make', 'significant', 'discovery.Earlier', 'film', 'meet', 'Thomas', 'neighbor', 'painter', 'named', 'Bill', 'John', 'Castle', 'who', 'notion', 'looking', 'work', 'art', 'seeing', 'something', 'complete', 'own', 'painting', 'When', 'Thomas', 'photos', 'Redgrave', 'presumed', 'lover', 'park', 'notice', 'other', 'details', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'investigation', 'sort', 'encapsulates', 'long', 'wandering', 'segments', 'Antonioni', 'previous', 'films', 'gradual', 'uncovering', 'kind', 'knowledge', 'truth', 'What', 'Thomas', 'discover', 'Perhaps', 'something', 'surface', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'rushing', 'around', 'driven', 'lives', 'perhaps', 'mortality', 'just', 'something', 'SEEMS', 'be', 'serious', 'important', 'When', 'investigation', 'going', 'see', 'actual', 'body', 'film', 'almost', 'sinister', 'aspect', 'something', 'primitive', 'slightly', 'disturbing', 'nearly', 'silent', 'scene', 'Thomas', 'finding', 'body', 'accompanied', 'only', 'soft', 'rustling', 'wind', 'trees', 'shaken', 'importantly', 'whole', 'experience', 'awakened', 'passion', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'artist', 'human', 'being', 'When', 'body', 'disappeared', 'second', 'visit', 'Thomas', 'deeply', 'disillusioned', 'Was', 'real', 'matter', 'was', 'not', 'brief', 'moment', 'jaded', 'young', 'man', 'cared', 'something', 'did', 'appear', 'be', 'serious', 'important', 'encounter', 'mimes', 'film', 'end', 'actually', 'seem', 'symbolic', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'move', 'director', 'part', 'Here', 'where', 'so', 'subjective', 'deliberately', 'up', 'grabs', 'what', 'anything', 'do', 'mimes', 'stand', 'Why', 'Thomas', 'join', 'game', 'then', 'disappear', 'surrender', 'illusory', 'nature', 'being', 'so', 'complete', 'no', 'longer', 'even', 'exist', 'himself.The', 'DVD', 'issue', 'BLOW-UP', 'extremely', 'good', 'sheer', 'visual', 'beauty', 'colors', 'images', 'really', 'due', 'critical', 'commentary', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'least', 'useful', 'recorded', 'challenging', 'film', 'kind']",N/A
276635,A7NRL3R5C0AL4,6301966015,"Maeri ""Marysz""","[12, 14]","Thomas is a vain and self-centered fashion photographer in London during the swinging sixties. But he obviously wants a life with deeper meaning--he poses as a factory worker to take gritty black and white photos. And one day he gets out of his Rolls-Royce (or is it a Bentley?) and wanders aimlessly through a park snapping photos.Thomas' desolate photos of the empty park show his loneliness and ennui. But as he develops the photos, he discovers that he may have photographed a man's murder. The dead man whose photograph Thomas takes in the park represents the deadness of Thomas' own emotional life. As he compulsively enlarges the photographs in search of the ""truth"" of what happened, a beautiful, mysterious woman, Jane shows up and demands the negatives. Jane also seduces him; this is a reversal of Thomas' usual exploitative relationships with women--she's turned the tables on him. Thomas, perhaps for the first time in his life, is truly emotionally engaged. But Jane takes off with the negatives and his prints and Thomas is left alone again, but now with a new capacity to feel. Where he goes with it is up to him. Of course, since this film is by Antonioni, it's visually mesmerizing and what ""happens"" is beside the point--Antonioni's films are always about a process of becoming. His characters have a way of never reaching their destinations. In Antonioni's films, the journey is the destination.Blow-Up is also about the sense of time passing--Thomas and Jane are young and beautiful, but their youth is as elusive and fleeting as the mysterious images Thomas takes in the park.

276637,A152C8GYY25HAH,6301966015,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","""Blow Up"" was a sensation when it was released in 1966. Critics and moviegoers hotly debated its enigmatic story. Three and a half decades later, its meaning is no clearer. I have seen it several times, and I remain clueless. The movie has fallen into relative obscurity, and, so, the few people I've met who have seen it have been unable to offer any satisfactory insights. If you are looking for pop entertainment, you certainly want to avoid this one because the plot is so puzzling.Why, you may ask, do I rank it so highly? It's because it is one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen. Every single shot is composed with the utmost care. The framing is amazing. The colors are beautiful. The sound, too, is meticulously constructed. Although the sound technology back then was primitive compared to today's, the movie manages to make background noises very much a part of the whole.The story revolves around a bored but brilliant London photographer, played by David Hemmings. He is a genius at his craft, but his life is an empty place. One day he wanders into a lovely park, where he spies two lovers. He follows them and photographs them. The girl [Vanessa Redgrave] sees him and demands he give her the film. He refuses. When he develops the photos, he sees a blurred image, which, when blown up, looks like it might be a body. He also blows up an images that looks like a hand holding a gun. He has accidentally photographed a murder. Or has he? The girl finds his studio. She seduces him. He pretends to give her the negatives, but later finds his studio has been vandalized. By the girl? By an accomplice? And for what reason? Who will believe him? Or is there anything to believe? It's left to the viewer to supply the answers.The lively and unusual music tracks are by jazz great Herbie Hancock. The movie was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, an Italian. To the best of my knowledge, his only other English language film is ""Zabriskie Point"" [1970]. His Italian films include ""La Notte"" [1960], ""The Eclipse"" [1962] and ""Red Desert"" [1964].

These type of movies are a aquired taste for sure.  Personally I like a straight narrative in a movie but that's not what this is about. It is about pictures and a young man's search for the answer to a mystery which becomes not important to the director in the end. However it was 1966 when this movie came out and it was different so it does still stand up as great movie of it's type. And it does have excellent actors in it; the late david hemmings and a young sexy  vanessa redgrave put in strong performances here,  and it includes a great cameo from the great rock band the yardbirds in which Jeff Beck blows up and smashes his guitar in anger.  So if you are looking for a straight storyline don't look here but if you are into arty image driven movies in which characters search for things then this one may be to your liking.

It is also his most successful film and the only one made in English (maybe his first).  In any case, I have a new appreciation for the film and at the same time reject the ""masterpiece"" tag.  I will admit, my memories were focused on the constant parading of boney British models in various stages of undress.David Hemmings is a successful fashion photographer who is fed up ,or at least bored, with his career.  We see throughout the film, sex, drugs, wealth and all the trappings of the ""Mod"" era of London in the 60's.  Thomas (Hemmings) goes on a search for items he thinks he needs for his next shoot.  While shooting in a park, he photographs a couple engaging in playful romance.The woman (a young Venessa Redgrave) tracks him down and insists she needs the pictures that he had taken.  When Thomas develops the film he believes he has witnessed a murder and does what he can to prove it...except of course, call the police.  This is a clue to why this may all be a fantasy.  There are others.  When Thomas asks one of his models why she isn't in Paris as he thought, she says ""I am"".  When he says to the girl in the park, ""we only just met"", she replies ""no we haven't"".The concluding sequence involves a mime troupe - also featured at the beginning of the film - watching 2 of them play tennis, without balls or racquets.  After Thomas tosses an errant phantom ball back over the fence and walks away, we hear actual balls bouncing for the first time.  Alas, perhaps it's all in his mind, and a hoax on us.  Now I love twisty-turny plots.  The problem for me with this film is that it isn't particularly entertaining.  Much time is given just setting up the atmosphere.  At times the movie is as boring as Thomas' life.Here are a few bits of trivia however that makes the movie re-watchable.  Thomas' primary camera is a Nikon F; a precursor of the FE which I bought in the early 70's and still have.  During a club scene, we see a band belting out ""Train Kept a Rollin'"" (here called ""Stroll On"").  It's the Yardbirds during the brief period when Jeff Beck (busting up a guitar, ala Pete Townshend) and Jimmie Page were both in the band.  This is the first British film where full frontal female nudity is shown.  Herbert (aka Herbie) Hancock did the musical score.  Oh hell, now I have to watch it again.Note: When playing the DVD, a stereo soundtrack plays over the opening credits, but then the sound mutes.  I had to stop the DVD and select Dolby Digital Mono to continue the sound. The same thing happened on other players.  I don't know if this was just a fluke with this disc, but I've never had this happen before or since with any other DVD or Blu ray.",3,3 1/2 stars for a groundbreaking  look at London in the '60's,1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,2814,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'been', 'many', 'years', 'saw', 'what', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'masterpieces', 'first', 'time', 'also', 'most', 'successful', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'made', 'English', 'maybe', 'first', 'case', 'have', 'new', 'appreciation', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'reject', 'masterpiece', 'tag', 'will', 'admit', 'memories', 'were', 'focused', 'constant', 'parading', 'boney', 'British', 'models', 'various', 'stages', 'undress.David', 'Hemmings', 'successful', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'least', 'bored', 'career', 'see', 'film', 'sex', 'drugs', 'wealth', 'trappings', 'Mod', 'era', 'London', '60', 'Thomas', 'Hemmings', 'search', 'items', 'next', 'shoot', 'shooting', 'park', 'couple', 'engaging', 'playful', 'romance.The', 'woman', 'young', 'Venessa', 'Redgrave', 'down', 'pictures', 'had', 'taken', 'When', 'Thomas', 'film', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'what', 'can', 'prove', 'course', 'call', 'police', 'clue', 'why', 'may', 'be', 'fantasy', 'are', 'others', 'When', 'Thomas', 'one', 'models', 'why', ""n't"", 'Paris', 'thought', 'am', 'When', 'girl', 'park', 'only', 'just', 'met', 'have', ""n't"", '.The', 'concluding', 'sequence', 'mime', 'troupe', 'also', 'featured', 'beginning', 'film', 'watching', '2', 'play', 'tennis', 'balls', 'racquets', 'Thomas', 'errant', 'phantom', 'ball', 'back', 'fence', 'walks', 'away', 'hear', 'actual', 'balls', 'bouncing', 'first', 'time', 'Alas', 'perhaps', 'mind', 'hoax', 'Now', 'love', 'twisty-turny', 'plots', 'problem', 'film', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'Much', 'time', 'given', 'just', 'setting', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'times', 'movie', 'as', 'boring', 'Thomas', 'are', 'few', 'bits', 'trivia', 'however', 'movie', 're-watchable', 'Thomas', 'primary', 'camera', 'Nikon', 'F', 'precursor', 'FE', 'bought', 'early', '70', 'still', 'have', 'club', 'scene', 'see', 'band', 'belting', 'out', 'Train', 'Kept', 'Rollin', 'here', 'called', 'Stroll', 'Yardbirds', 'brief', 'period', 'when', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'busting', 'up', 'guitar', 'ala', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'Jimmie', 'Page', 'were', 'band', 'first', 'British', 'film', 'where', 'full', 'frontal', 'female', 'nudity', 'shown', 'Herbert', 'Herbie', 'Hancock', 'did', 'musical', 'score', 'Oh', 'hell', 'now', 'have', 'watch', 'again.Note', 'When', 'playing', 'DVD', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'opening', 'credits', 'then', 'sound', 'had', 'stop', 'DVD', 'select', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Mono', 'continue', 'sound', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'other', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'just', 'fluke', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'happen', 'before', 'other', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'ray']",N/A

Notable is how rapidly the culture was changing and how its attitudes still reverberate today.Aesthetically, I find it interesting that many films of the sixties look cleaner and crisper than many from the seventies decade.. they even feel relatively more modern in comparison.  I don't think anyone has ever satisfactorily explained this phenomenon to me, other than something happened to film stocks in the 70s that didn't preserve well.Blow Up is a hybrid art-meets-commercial endeavor.  But it cannot be both things at once and not do a bit to undermine itself.  Aesthetically, It is very well composed but I found its pacing and mannered acting very frustrating.  Characters move  as if in a slow-motion funk and then they randomly jerk about.  It's like they attended the school of Ritalin-method acting.  In one scene, David Hemming goes skipping up the path on the way to the park, clicking his heels together midflight --made me laugh and cringe!

It's a masterpiece... it's rubbish... it's tantalisingly complex... it's hedonistically superficial... what happens in the film is ""real""... nothing that happens in the film is ""real""... and so it goes. Watch the film and take your choice, but the fact that it still generates such reactions is a testament to its enduring impact. So what does it have?Well, on the down side, a lot of the acting is weak, the musical soundtrack is too self-consciously ""hip"", and several of the scenes appear to have been inserted purely for effect - ""we do nudity, drugs and rock &amp; roll as well as making films"". And on the plus side? David Hemmings acting is superb, the cinema-photography is brilliant, and the use of sound (and silence) to create atmosphere is stunningly effective. But beneath all that's superficially good &amp; bad there's something much, much deeper. Firstly, a riddle that drives it and to which there's no answer - in simple terms, what's real and what's not? Antonioni poses this question throughout the film, from the heavily handed obvious (the play acting of the mime troupe), the subtle (the fact that Hemmings' character is never referred to by name), to the brilliantly tense darkroom scenes where his photos are ""blown up"" to levels that make interpretation of what he and we are ""seeing"" impossible.

276647,A32RX109J2TRYG,6301966015,"Paco Rivero ""Henry""","[4, 7]","BLOW UP is often listed as one of the best movies ever made (including by film critic Roger Ebert). My opinion as a lay person is that there are about 40 minutes in this film that ARE just about as good as anything put on film but after which the movie goes horribly wrong. The sequence from when David Hemmings goes to the antique store and strolls into the park with his camera (where he first spots Vanessa Redgrave and takes the pictures) all the way to when he blows up the photographs at his studio and realizes that there was a murder--this whole sequence is pure genius. It keeps me absolutely spellbound. But the spell is broken when the two tarts return. Here the film sinks to the level of mud wrestling (just substitute blue paper for mud), and only keeps getting worse (with the exception of when he spots Redgrave on the street and she disappears into the crowd, which is splendidly done). After the mud wrestling scene (or paper wrestling, as it were), there's a very badly staged scene at a rock concert. Then Hemmings goes to a party where Antonioni makes much of pot smoking--as if it were some strange ritual from outer space or something he'd never seen before. Neither scene is necessary to the plot and drags the movie down to a level of pure titillation. (But who's shocked by that sort of thing in movies any more?) The movie seems to be saying, look how cool I am--I have naked women wrestlers, threesomes, pot smoking--all of which might've been groundbreaking back in the 60s but today looks terribly juvenile and dated and passe. Then there's a very ambiguous ending in the park with a bunch of mimes playing tennis. All in all, this is a good--but flawed--movie. Whenever it deals seriously with photography and art or with Redgrave and the murder in the park, the film's right on track; but when it tries to be ""cool,"" it falls flat on its face because it breaks the suspense for the sake of looking slick and trendy. On the plus side, BLOW UP looks great. Practically every frame is stunning (superb composition). Every line--every angle--seems to have been put there by an artist with a fine eye/aesthetic sense. BLOW UP is worth seeing--even worth seeing more than once--but it does have its flaws, its silly side.

I was drawn into its pace, its quiet, its wandering.  Now, the DVD - not a perfect package, certainly, but well worth the price.  Cheap-o case, slim ""extras"" - what the hell is with that ""music-only"" soundtrack, anyway?  It really is just the visual of the film playing with the added music (what little there is), no dialog or other sounds, not even the Yardbirds stuff!While the audio commentary is potentially off-putting (be prepared for obligatory academic fussing about male dominance, ""male gaze"" etc), the guy manages to stay focussed on what's on screen at the moment, and even comes through with a few worthwhile observations - particularly the film's motif of things losing their meaning when placed out of context (the one photo left behind after the burglary, the broken guitar fretboard taken from the club).  While a regular viewer might observe the photographer being kind of snippy (and - gasp! - rude) toward his models, the critic complains of his ""brutal"" treatment of women; when Hemmings is taking pictures of Veruschka, and then stops when he feels he's done taking pictures, our audio professor sniffs at the photographer/male oppressor using and discarding the poor, sensitive, victimized model.  Sheeesh!  What was he supposed to do, cuddle her?I suppose it is a relevant topic in the context of Antonioni's other work, but the guy takes too much delight in skewering the main character, who we are supposed to like, after all.  (Pretty much the same thing happens with the critc's commentary on the Criterion DVD of ""Straw Dogs"").Overall though, the commentary is not too intrusive, and the more relevant insights, and the power of the film itself, offset any rhetorical groaners one might hear.  I'm not sure if I ever noticed the apparent glimpse of the Vanessa Redgrave character on the street at night, quickly vanishing in the crowd.  The use of the director's camera-eye to separate itself from the main character's point of view is another element to the sense of mystery.  About the only moment in the film that doesn't ring true for me is the catatonic audience at Ricky Tick's - one cannot listen to the Yardbirds (live, no less) in such a state.",5,Never ceases to fascinate!,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,2376,"['used', 'check', 'out', 'video', 'local', 'public', 'library', 'not', 'kind', 'thing', 'one', 'shelf', 'Blockbuster', 'found', 'going', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'time', 'was', 'drawn', 'pace', 'quiet', 'wandering', 'Now', 'DVD', 'not', 'perfect', 'package', 'certainly', 'well', 'price', 'Cheap-o', 'case', 'slim', 'extras', 'what', 'hell', 'music-only', 'soundtrack', 'anyway', 'really', 'just', 'visual', 'film', 'playing', 'added', 'music', 'what', 'little', 'dialog', 'other', 'sounds', 'not', 'even', 'Yardbirds', 'stuff', 'audio', 'commentary', 'potentially', 'off-putting', 'be', 'prepared', 'obligatory', 'academic', 'fussing', 'male', 'dominance', 'male', 'gaze', 'etc', 'guy', 'stay', 'focussed', 'what', 'screen', 'moment', 'even', 'few', 'worthwhile', 'observations', 'particularly', 'film', 'motif', 'things', 'losing', 'meaning', 'when', 'placed', 'context', 'one', 'photo', 'left', 'behind', 'burglary', 'broken', 'guitar', 'fretboard', 'taken', 'club', 'regular', 'viewer', 'might', 'observe', 'photographer', 'being', 'kind', 'snippy', 'gasp', 'rude', 'models', 'critic', 'complains', 'brutal', 'treatment', 'women', 'when', 'Hemmings', 'taking', 'pictures', 'Veruschka', 'then', 'stops', 'when', 'done', 'taking', 'pictures', 'audio', 'professor', 'sniffs', 'photographer/male', 'oppressor', 'using', 'discarding', 'poor', 'sensitive', 'victimized', 'model', 'Sheeesh', 'What', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', 'cuddle', 'suppose', 'relevant', 'topic', 'context', 'Antonioni', 'other', 'work', 'guy', 'too', 'much', 'delight', 'skewering', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'like', 'Pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'critc', 'commentary', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'Straw', 'Dogs', '.Overall', 'commentary', 'not', 'too', 'intrusive', 'more', 'relevant', 'insights', 'power', 'film', 'offset', 'rhetorical', 'groaners', 'one', 'might', 'hear', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'noticed', 'apparent', 'glimpse', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'character', 'street', 'night', 'quickly', 'vanishing', 'crowd', 'use', 'director', 'camera-eye', 'separate', 'main', 'character', 'point', 'view', 'element', 'sense', 'mystery', 'only', 'moment', 'film', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'catatonic', 'audience', 'Ricky', 'Tick', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'listen', 'Yardbirds', 'live', 'less', 'such', 'state']",N/A

I loved his Italian trilogy in black and white (La Notte, L'Aventurra and L'Eclisse ) (excuse probable faulty spelling)and stood in line to see Blow Up when it hit New York in the 60's.  Wow...Antonioni in English and in color!  I loved it but I hadn't a clue about what it meant.  To me it was surface, color, style and glamour.  I was young and arty and impressionable.Now I'm seeing it again and, of course, the stuff that made it so cool back then--sex, drugs and rock and roll--are funny and quaint.  But the film is still so good.  I still don't worry my head about what it means--like a Matisse--I personally just enjoy it.  I take it in and it feels good and it affects me.  Later, I may have some insight about its meaning.  It is so good that it has to have something besides surface beauty.Antonioni had his finger on the happening scene at the time.  It was a time of huge cultural change and one can read lots of books about what that meant.  He just went there and shot this.  It's a snap shot, maybe, of a moment in time--a very nice snap shot.  People can look at it, at their leisure, maybe and figure out what it means to them.I think A. is an artist who escapes being overly arty.  Yes, the mimes were annoying but that's because we've seen them copied over and over since then--at the time they were fresh and had some sort of meaning--oops--there's that word again--meaning.I didn't like it as much as the 3 Italian black and whites but I think I liked it better than Zabriskie Point.  Maybe he knew his own culture best.I do remember that, after this film hit, you couldn't walk around New York without some young guy photographing you.

I decided to give it another try and I'm glad I did.  This movie has its' faults which include the dated surroundings.  One gets the feeling that it starts out as another Austin Powers movie.  It's too 60's not to be at least somewhat distracting.  The movie is disjointed, the interpersonal interactions seem so phony, and the plot is too haphazard.  The problem in assessing these later points is in determining whether it is the fault of or the purpose of the director that they end up this way.  The point of the movie (that was lost on me the first time I saw it) is the emptiness of our lives and their purpose.  We certainly get this impression (at least if we watch the movie a second time) but could the movie have been more fluid in presenting its' message.  I believe it could but I'm not sure that Antonioni was the director who could achieve that.This is a colorful movie that appeals to the eyes.  I was focussed on a particular scene where all building were a bright shade of red for blocks and blocks.  I think that this was another message from the director that the facade may be appealing but that doesn't mean that there's anything of substance within.  There are a lot of hipsters (ala 1960's style) who also demonstrate this point quite effectively.  Their mindless pursuit of the moment ultimately conveys a sense of pointless boredom.  My favorite scene was the one in which the Yardbirds were playing.  One of the band members (if I were really hip I would have recognized him by name) got fed up with some equiptment problems and busted his guitar.  He then threw the neck of the guitar out to the audience who tussled over it until our ""hero"" got is and dashed off pursued by other who desperately wanted that souvenir.  After he made his escape, he tossed it aside as though it were trash.  A bystander picked it up and, after looking it over, tossed it away as well.  What a comment that was about our fleeting sense of values!  One moment an icon, the next moment junk.There actually is a sort of plot but, although it creates additional messages, is the sort of thing that leaves us (intentially?) unfulfilled.  The ending gives us a view of the phoniness of our lives.  Given the opportunity to be merely an observer or a participant is the choice that we seem to be left with.I think that all of this could have been done in a different format.

276656,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301966015,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 11]","Blow-Up (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1966)Antonioni's film career, these days, is little more than a footnote in the textbooks of aspiring filmmakers and  critics. Most of his movies have already been forgotten less than a half-century after they were made. One of the exceptions is Blow-Up, which was nominated for almost as many awards  as O. J. Simpson. Watching it thirty-five years after its release, one wonders why.Much of the film's power probably had to do with its cultural context. Blow-Up, which is ostensibly about a  photographer (a very young David Hemming, later to not achieve the great fame he should have for his role in Profondo Rosso, one of the finest films ever made) who may or may not  have captured a murder on film without meaning to, was actually full of subtext about the meaning of photography in the modern world. When you realize the infamous Zapruder film was released at around the same time andviewable by those in the know, the questions get a lot more compelling. At least they did to those who theorized  endlessly about a grassy knoll in Dallas in 1963. Removed from that context now, Antonioni's crowning achievement looks a bit more like Thomas' Harris novel The Silence of  the Lambs. As the book, which is mediocre at best, was carried to stardom within the context of Jonathan Demme's excellent film, Blow-Up took its cue from Zapruder.  However, while Harris' next novel showed the rest of the world that Harris was, in fact, not a writer up to par with Demme's filmmaking, Antonioni's followup (the gloriously  vapid, now largely-forgotten Zabriskie Point, a film of interest only to hardcore Pink Floyd fans-and even most of THEM find it insufferable) had no effect on the filmmaker's stature  whatsoever. Even time seems to have left Antonioni relatively unscathed, and many still see Blow-Up as a classic. I will continue to wonder what they're thinking. Both Hemming  and co-star Vanessa Redgrave seem somewhat lost in their parts, various gratuitous nude scenes are thrown in for what seems to be shock value more than anything, the  Yardbirds make a pointless cameo, and what is actually on the roll of film that everyone's so concerned about never captures the viewer's attention nearly as much as it captures  the attentions of everyone else.

276658,AY3AVLL5IWW9,6301966015,Russell Fanelli,"[10, 10]","Blow-Up, as the title suggests, is about the pictures.  David Hemmings is the photographer putting together a book about the down-and-out in London.  He decides to provide contrast for the end of his book by taking some shots in an idylic London park.  He sees in the distance Vanessa Redgrave holding an older man in what appears to be an embrace.  Hemmings begins photographing them and then is spotted by Redgrave who demands the negatives.  Hemmings refuses.Redgrave shows up later at Hemmings' studio.  He gives her what he says are the negatives, but we find out moments later he has kept them and proceeds to develop his pictures.The closer he looks at the blow-ups of his shots, the more intrigued he becomes with what he sees, which is a gun pointed at Redgraves' lover and then later a grainy shot of what may be a body.  Hemmings goes back to the park, finds the body, and then returns home.  Later his studio is vandalized and all his pictures are stolen.This plot line appears thin for a two hour film and many Amazon.com reviewers are bored to death with what they think is a pretentious movie about people impossible to like and a story bereft of action and dialogue.The Hemmings' character is impossible to like and that is just the point.  Director Michelangelo Antonioni is more interested in what Hemmings' camera sees, and that is a world invisible to the naked eye.  Hemmings' camera gives us frozen moments in time that are decisive moments in the lives of his characters.  Only by looking closely with great patience can we unravel the mystery of life and death played out in a park on a sunny afternoon.Blow-Up is a great mystery story and the mystery goes deeper than the murder in the park.  Can we trust what we think we see? Clearly not.  For those who would like to further their understanding of this question, I recommend Akira Kurosawa's great film Rashomon.  Can we trust what the camera sees?  Perhaps, but not from the long distance lense of Hemming's camera.  He needed to go back to the park to confirm what he thought he saw.Antonioni is a skillful director; he shows much and tells little, and he is careful to give us everything we need to make up our own mind.

276660,A6FIAB28IS79,6301966015,Samuel Chell,"[87, 104]","More than any other film that comes to mind, ""Blow Up"" illustrates the adage distinguishing the novelist from the filmmaker: the former's concern is to make the significant visible whereas the latter's passion is to bring significance to the visible.  Little does it matter that the film's protagonist fails in that quest.  Antonioni manages to make the search itself so absorbing that the ""whodunnit"" motif of the narrative is incidental to the  journey itself.  ""Pictures don't lie"" is another old bromide being put to the test by this film's unique thematizing of the photographic process itself, and Antonioni's accomplishment is to preserve the spirit if not the letter of the statement.  We leave the film believing in the power of the photographed image even if both its meaning and content remain inconclusive.Watching the film in the theater was a spellbinding and unforgettable experience. Anyone who has seen the director's out-of-control if not disastrous ""Zabriskie Point"" and subsequently decided to pass up ""Blow Up"" should definitely reconsider.  Just a couple of caveats: the film does, in fact, transfer quite poorly to a small video monitor, bringing excessive attention to dated features of the pop cultural landscape of the late '60's London scene.  Moreover, because video cameras are now the everyman's commodity, while cropping, editing, and enlargening images are common practice in modern-day consumer culture, some of the undeniable excitement experienced by David Hemmings with each of his successive blow-ups is bound to seem much more mundane.  And perhaps by now we fancy we know more about photography than either Antonioni or Hemmings, especially after the failure of even instant replay to be definitive about whether a touchdown was scored.Nevertheless, if you have a large screen, some patience and a memory of the promise and challenges of an earlier technology, ""Blow Up"" still is capable of working at several important levels--as existential philosophy, as postmodern text, as compelling narrative (Hemmings is wonderful), and as a respite from many current overly loud, fractically edited blockbusters that, despite the sound and fury, signify nothing whatsoever.",5,The Significance of the Visible,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,2204,"['More', 'other', 'film', 'mind', 'Blow', 'Up', 'adage', 'distinguishing', 'novelist', 'filmmaker', 'former', 'concern', 'make', 'significant', 'visible', 'latter', 'passion', 'bring', 'significance', 'visible', 'Little', 'matter', 'film', 'protagonist', 'quest', 'Antonioni', 'make', 'search', 'so', 'absorbing', 'whodunnit', 'motif', 'narrative', 'incidental', 'journey', 'Pictures', 'do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'old', 'bromide', 'being', 'put', 'test', 'film', 'unique', 'thematizing', 'photographic', 'process', 'Antonioni', 'accomplishment', 'preserve', 'spirit', 'not', 'letter', 'statement', 'leave', 'film', 'believing', 'power', 'photographed', 'image', 'even', 'meaning', 'content', 'remain', 'inconclusive.Watching', 'film', 'theater', 'was', 'spellbinding', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'director', 'out-of-control', 'not', 'disastrous', 'Zabriskie', 'Point', 'subsequently', 'decided', 'pass', 'up', 'Blow', 'Up', 'should', 'definitely', 'reconsider', 'Just', 'couple', 'caveats', 'film', 'fact', 'transfer', 'quite', 'poorly', 'small', 'video', 'monitor', 'bringing', 'excessive', 'attention', 'dated', 'features', 'pop', 'cultural', 'landscape', 'late', ""'60"", 'London', 'scene', 'Moreover', 'video', 'cameras', 'are', 'now', 'everyman', 'commodity', 'cropping', 'editing', 'enlargening', 'images', 'are', 'common', 'practice', 'modern-day', 'consumer', 'culture', 'undeniable', 'excitement', 'experienced', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'successive', 'blow-ups', 'bound', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'mundane', 'perhaps', 'now', 'fancy', 'know', 'more', 'photography', 'Antonioni', 'Hemmings', 'especially', 'failure', 'even', 'instant', 'replay', 'be', 'definitive', 'touchdown', 'was', 'scored.Nevertheless', 'have', 'large', 'screen', 'patience', 'memory', 'promise', 'challenges', 'earlier', 'technology', 'Blow', 'Up', 'still', 'capable', 'working', 'several', 'important', 'levels', 'existential', 'philosophy', 'postmodern', 'text', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'Hemmings', 'wonderful', 'respite', 'many', 'current', 'overly', 'loud', 'fractically', 'edited', 'blockbusters', 'sound', 'fury', 'signify', 'nothing', 'whatsoever']",N/A

By chance he follows a couple in a park, taking pictures of them as they wander and display their affections. Of course, nothing is as it seems and soon that girl will arrive on his doorstep willing to do anything to get the negatives. Has his camera captured an illicit affair?  Thomas intentionally gives her the wrong negatives and immediately developes the right ones. Curiosity? Once developed, he thinks he sees something in one of the photos and proceeds to blowup the questionable image. He studies the results, and the more he searches through the pixels the more he begins to see. A dead body? A crime?  He asks the girlfriend of an artist who who works adjacent to his studio, ""That's the body? It looks like one of Bill's paintings."" Earlier in the film we actually see Bill's work and he explains that trying to make sense of the components of art is like ""trying to find a clue in a detective story."" Thomas has indeed become a detective, suddenly aware of an existence that lurks under the surface of things. An illusive existence . . . imaginary? Everything about this picture questions structure and the idea of reality. Begining with a great Jazz score (the most improvisational of music), we see Thomas indistinquishable from a mass of downtrodden homeless men only to turn the corner and step into a Rolls Royce convertable. Things are not what they seem.  A troup of mimes cruises through London pretending to see and interact with things that are not real and when they make a reappearence at the end of the film, playing tennis with imaginary rackets, we can almost see the ball bouncing from one side of the court to the other.  In the end one might ask if Thomas really did uncover a murder or was it only imagined? Perhaps this is a question we might just as well ask ourselves concerning our own realities, but once you start questioning things, the answers will inevitably lead to more questions.

Right off this is arguably a pretentious filmmakers dream come true. The level of style over substance in this film borders on comical yet somehow it all works well. It is true that a person could make the argument that this film is a major in depth critique on the roots of imagination. On the other hand you could also make the argument that this film is merely a romp that mixes attractive female models with illegal substances.  The hero in this film is a glamorous photographer Thomas (David Hemmings). He is really a pompous jerk but the kind people can relate to. Thomas exudes relatability because he is alone. This is a story about alienation. In that sense the film is timeless. Blow Up takes place in London in the mid 60s. It is a time capsule of style. The photographer is cruising around the city and stops to take a few pictures of a random couple in the park. It turns out that the pictures he took miraculously reveal that there was a murder in progress. This leads to him having a suggestive and revealing attractive woman in his apartment. One thing leads to another. If you want to be happy then be happy. If you want to be sad so be it. The real beauty of this interesting film is that it really leaves it up to you. You might even dislike Blowup but good luck looking away or turning it off. You never truly know what will happen next. The soundtrack was scored by Herbie Hancock. There is also a particularly unique performance by the Yardbirds where everyone in the audience is really just to cool to care. Sound familiar? Borrow this one from the library.

276670,A1VLWFAGM11XZ0,6301966015,The Sentinel,"[5, 8]","Michelangelo Antonioni's BLOW-UP offers us a subtle and disturbing reading of the modern world.  The film follows a day in the life of Thomas, a young hotshot fashion photographer (based on the notorious David Bailey), played with puckish insolence by David Hemmings.  Antonioni's particular brand of phenomenological Neorealism is based on the idea of the camera lens as a way of exposing the ultimate truth, or lack thereof, that underlies the surface of the world.  We watch as Thomas investigates his photographs, scrutinizing them obsessively and blowing them up larger and larger so that eventually they become nothing more than an abstract collection of dots - a kind of Rorschach test in which almost anything can be read.  The received cultural baggage of the image is eliminated until all that remains is purest subjectivity of the spectator.  Once this threshold of semiotic referentiality has been crossed, the suspicion of a murder in the park gleaned from a series of augmented photographs would seem to say more about Thomas' own paranoid state of mind than what his camera may or may not have recorded.This subtextual aspect of the film has been compared to the controversy surrounding the various interpretations of the Abraham Zapruder film as a definitive and reliable record of the Kennedy assassination, and in particular, the mystery of the notorious `grassy knoll.'  The possible incidence of adultery and The Girl's desperate efforts to retrieve the negatives seem an oblique reference to the scandalous fallout of the Profumo affair.  Vanessa Redgrave, with her thick, dark brown hair and affected temptress-naf manner (hinted at by a schoolgirl outfit and arms folded seductively over her breasts) seems meant to evoke, for a British audience at least, then-recent memories of Christine Keeler.  Thomas himself resembles Odysseus in the way he is continually thwarted by chance meetings that cause him to lose sight of his mission, and the film's meandering, episodic structure does indeed seem to contain elements of classical epic.  His shirtless tryst with The Girl, for example, recalls Odysseus' first encounter on the beach with Naus&iacute;kaa, and the rock concert and marijuana party he attends afterward suggests a journey through the Land of the Lotus-Eaters.Like Antonioni's earlier LA NOTTE, the action of BLOW-UP takes place entirely within the span of twenty-four hours.  It follows the travails of a solitary person in a highly subjective manner, with the unmediated banality of his experience conveyed through relentless longueurs and temps morts - roughly approximating, in stripped down cinematic language, the narrative design of James Joyce's ULYSSES.  But just like Godard in LE M&Eacute;PRIS, Antonioni inverts the themes of Joyce's novel by revealing the search for human contact in sex as a spiritual dead end and showing man as ultimately bewildered, uncomprehending, and impotent before the demands of the modern world.As a self-referential odyssey through the heart of a modern city, BLOW-UP seems a trenchant comment on the nature of success and what it does to people.  It certainly was Antonioni's greatest commercial success (as a struggling film student in Bologna during the Fascist era, the director was also a champion tennis player who had to sell his trophies to buy food and pay the rent).  New wealth and creature comforts can often bring us a false sense of power and security, which eventually turns to disillusionment, and even a desperate feeling of helplessness, when we come to learn of mysterious (and perhaps malign) forces existing outside the scope of our control and understanding.  Here, the Marxist Antonioni demonstrates once again that this malaise of modern life is not caused by technology and consumer culture but rather by man's failure to adapt to the conditions of the new environment he has created for himself.",5,A disturbing parable...,972000000,"10 20, 2000",2000,3899,"['Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'BLOW-UP', 'offers', 'subtle', 'disturbing', 'reading', 'modern', 'world', 'film', 'day', 'life', 'Thomas', 'young', 'hotshot', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'based', 'notorious', 'David', 'Bailey', 'played', 'puckish', 'insolence', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'Antonioni', 'particular', 'brand', 'phenomenological', 'Neorealism', 'based', 'idea', 'camera', 'way', 'exposing', 'ultimate', 'truth', 'lack', 'thereof', 'surface', 'world', 'watch', 'Thomas', 'photographs', 'scrutinizing', 'obsessively', 'blowing', 'up', 'larger', 'larger', 'so', 'eventually', 'become', 'nothing', 'more', 'abstract', 'collection', 'dots', 'kind', 'Rorschach', 'test', 'almost', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'received', 'cultural', 'baggage', 'image', 'eliminated', 'purest', 'subjectivity', 'spectator', 'Once', 'threshold', 'semiotic', 'referentiality', 'been', 'crossed', 'suspicion', 'murder', 'park', 'gleaned', 'series', 'augmented', 'photographs', 'would', 'seem', 'say', 'more', 'Thomas', 'own', 'paranoid', 'state', 'mind', 'what', 'camera', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'recorded.This', 'subtextual', 'aspect', 'film', 'been', 'compared', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'various', 'interpretations', 'Abraham', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'definitive', 'reliable', 'record', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'particular', 'mystery', 'notorious', 'grassy', 'knoll', 'possible', 'incidence', 'adultery', 'Girl', 'desperate', 'efforts', 'retrieve', 'negatives', 'seem', 'oblique', 'reference', 'scandalous', 'fallout', 'Profumo', 'affair', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'thick', 'dark', 'brown', 'hair', 'affected', 'temptress-naf', 'manner', 'hinted', 'schoolgirl', 'outfit', 'arms', 'folded', 'seductively', 'breasts', 'meant', 'evoke', 'British', 'audience', 'least', 'then-recent', 'memories', 'Christine', 'Keeler', 'Thomas', 'Odysseus', 'way', 'continually', 'thwarted', 'chance', 'meetings', 'cause', 'lose', 'sight', 'mission', 'film', 'meandering', 'episodic', 'structure', 'indeed', 'seem', 'contain', 'elements', 'classical', 'epic', 'shirtless', 'tryst', 'Girl', 'example', 'Odysseus', 'first', 'encounter', 'beach', 'Naus', 'iacute', 'rock', 'concert', 'marijuana', 'party', 'afterward', 'journey', 'Land', 'Lotus-Eaters.Like', 'Antonioni', 'earlier', 'LA', 'NOTTE', 'action', 'BLOW-UP', 'place', 'entirely', 'span', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'travails', 'solitary', 'person', 'highly', 'subjective', 'manner', 'unmediated', 'banality', 'experience', 'conveyed', 'relentless', 'longueurs', 'temps', 'morts', 'roughly', 'approximating', 'stripped', 'down', 'cinematic', 'language', 'narrative', 'design', 'James', 'Joyce', 'ULYSSES', 'just', 'Godard', 'LE', 'M', 'Eacute', 'PRIS', 'Antonioni', 'themes', 'Joyce', 'novel', 'revealing', 'search', 'human', 'contact', 'sex', 'spiritual', 'dead', 'end', 'showing', 'man', 'ultimately', 'bewildered', 'uncomprehending', 'impotent', 'demands', 'modern', 'world.As', 'self-referential', 'odyssey', 'heart', 'modern', 'city', 'BLOW-UP', 'trenchant', 'comment', 'nature', 'success', 'what', 'people', 'certainly', 'was', 'Antonioni', 'greatest', 'commercial', 'success', 'struggling', 'film', 'student', 'Bologna', 'Fascist', 'era', 'director', 'was', 'also', 'champion', 'tennis', 'player', 'who', 'had', 'sell', 'trophies', 'buy', 'food', 'pay', 'rent', 'New', 'wealth', 'creature', 'comforts', 'can', 'often', 'bring', 'false', 'sense', 'power', 'security', 'eventually', 'disillusionment', 'even', 'desperate', 'feeling', 'helplessness', 'when', 'come', 'learn', 'mysterious', 'perhaps', 'malign', 'existing', 'scope', 'control', 'understanding', 'Here', 'Marxist', 'Antonioni', 'once', 'again', 'malaise', 'modern', 'life', 'not', 'caused', 'technology', 'consumer', 'culture', 'rather', 'man', 'failure', 'adapt', 'conditions', 'new', 'environment', 'created']",N/A

They  seem to miss the overall - which is that it's a movie with a beginiing, an end, and something strange in the middle. These poor souls need to remember why they watch movies in the first place. Some works of art withstand repeated assaults - but very very few are invincible fortresses, and a bit of restraint and finesse is required or you're libel to ruin your enjoyment of a perfectly fine movie simply by throwing rocks at it. Why apply super assaultative techniques on the initial viewing? The amazing thing about great art is that it does seem to withstand initial analysis. I'm not saying Blow up is great art - only that the analysis part comes afterward, not as the frames are rolling out of the projector for your first viewing. How can you possibly enjoy watching a movie if you are intensely weighing it against 30+ years of hype, reviews, and memory?  And Resnais? And instead of guessing that a movie has a certain look because of budget why don't you give the director the benefit and ask if the movie looks a certain way BECAUSE HE WANTED IT TO LOOK THAT WAY? Blow up is hugely entertaining, and a fascinating examination of perception and reality - which may point to some of the other reviewer's questions. The painter's work looks strikingly like the blown up photos - which is obvious since this fact is delivered on a platter by one of the character's lines. You don't ask a painter what his work means; I learned this in art history. You ask a painter what he likes for dinner, what movies he enjoys. As soon as you ask him what his painting means, he's going to take you on a ride. So anyway, the point is, Blow up is well worth watching. It is beautifully shot, rewards with repeated viewings, and in that naive 60s way it rewards a gracious analysis with concepts and ideas that are neither pretentious nor flawed.

Film was seen a popular entertainment.Antonioni was an Italian film maker who grappled with the problem of making film interlectually respectable. Others tried to do it by making neo realist dramas or by making films with a political message.Antonioni was a stylist who made long basically plotless films without much dialogue. The lack of plot and dialogue allowed audiences to focus on facial expressions and various other minimlist things to come to a symbolic meaning or understanding of the films.The plot of this film is simple. A photographer takes some photos in a park. He sees something and enlarges the prints. (Yes the title) As the prints are enlarged he notices a body under some shrubs. Yes he might have got some evidence of a murder. (Or if someone has had a heart attack, some slow response times from the local ambulence service) An attractive woman comes and takes her top off revealing her naked breasts to get him to hand over the film. The last scence involves him joining in some mime artists. They fake a tenis match and he joins in. Symbolic of the unreality of the world or some such thing.The key to the film of course is that in itself it is so slow moving it is tedious. They key to any enjoyment is to have endless discussions about the meaning of various bits of it to establish its meaning.

How else did MGM get in on the backing of 'Blow Up?'

Antonioni's mistake was that we could never pin down his attitude toward such subject matter.  Surely the man who created 'L'avventura' was only interested in the surfaces of his subject (it had no depths to speak of)?  Surely he was cleverly disparaging the lifestyle of this idiot photographer?  Fact is, Antonioni was secretly in love with it.  Just as he would be duped by the stupidities enacted in 'Zabriskie Point.'  He wasn't as objective as his better admirers believed.  He was middle-aged.  He was Italian.

They were part of what created in my memory such a haunting aspect to the entire movie.  I would like for them to be &#34;put back in,&#34; if at all possible.  (The same with other certain critical parts that, missing, create gaps in the movie's critical sequence of events.)  I'm amazed, amused and mystified at how much of the &#34;fluff&#34; of this movie I had long since forgotten, and I think I understand just why I did forget it: it's irrelevant, at least today.  The corny romance, the sex romp, the attempts to illustrate a jaded ennui, the pace and, perhaps most intrusive of all, a terribly UN-contributive musical scoring (unfortunately common to movies of even serious intent back in this period) all point to issues that were, in fact, on the minds of the boomer generation back then, but serve little purpose stuck in a movie like this, attempting as it is to deal with the esoteric topic of trying to understand the nature of reality.  There might have been some usefulness to deploying such devices back then, since they were, after all, part of the &#34;real&#34; consciousness of that age, but today they seem limp, lame and definitely out of place and in urgent need of updating, expungement or suitable replacement.  I say this as if I didn't like the move after seeing it again after so many years.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I LOVE this movie!  But the plot, in terms of the cinematography's mostly healthy evolution, suffers from excess baggage.  This evaluation of yesterday's film values in terms of today's is probably unfair, especially considering that certain aspects of the movie, like beautifully composed photography, could be difficult to re-create under someone other than Antonioni, but I do believe this movie could be a compelling re-make with the right actors, director, cinematographer and script writer-- some pretty big &#34;ifs,&#34; but well-worth contemplating&#8230;.",4,"Great movie, but dated&#8230;.",1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,2263,"['saw', 'movie', 'back', 'sixties', 'not', 'long', 'was', 'released', 'amazed', 'due', 'uniqueness', 'plot', '34', 'intent.', '34', 'viewing', 'somewhat', 'hurtfully', 'edited', 'version', 'original', 'certainly', 'agree', 'viewers', 'who', 'insist', 'something', 'been', '34', 'lost', '34', 'not', 'showing', 'original', 'opening', 'images', 'were', 'part', 'what', 'created', 'memory', 'haunting', 'aspect', 'entire', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'be', '34', 'put', 'back', '34', 'possible', 'same', 'other', 'certain', 'critical', 'parts', 'missing', 'create', 'gaps', 'movie', 'critical', 'sequence', 'events', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'amused', 'mystified', 'how', 'much', '34', 'fluff', '34', 'movie', 'had', 'long', 'forgotten', 'think', 'understand', 'just', 'why', 'did', 'forget', 'irrelevant', 'least', 'today', 'corny', 'romance', 'sex', 'romp', 'attempts', 'illustrate', 'jaded', 'ennui', 'pace', 'perhaps', 'most', 'intrusive', 'terribly', 'UN-contributive', 'musical', 'scoring', 'unfortunately', 'common', 'movies', 'even', 'serious', 'intent', 'back', 'period', 'point', 'issues', 'were', 'fact', 'minds', 'boomer', 'generation', 'back', 'then', 'serve', 'little', 'purpose', 'stuck', 'movie', 'attempting', 'deal', 'esoteric', 'topic', 'trying', 'understand', 'nature', 'reality', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'usefulness', 'deploying', 'such', 'devices', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'part', '34', 'real', '34', 'consciousness', 'age', 'today', 'seem', 'limp', 'lame', 'definitely', 'place', 'urgent', 'need', 'updating', 'expungement', 'suitable', 'replacement', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'seeing', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'plot', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'mostly', 'healthy', 'evolution', 'suffers', 'excess', 'baggage', 'evaluation', 'yesterday', 'film', 'values', 'terms', 'today', 'probably', 'unfair', 'especially', 'considering', 'certain', 'aspects', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'photography', 'could', 'be', 'difficult', 're-create', 'someone', 'other', 'Antonioni', 'do', 'believe', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'compelling', 're-make', 'right', 'actors', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'script', 'writer', 'pretty', 'big', '34', 'ifs', '34', 'well-worth', 'contemplating', '8230']",N/A

I hadn't seen this film for many years but upon review I find it dated for today's audiences, yet for me it still holds up as an icon of the 1960s.David Hemmings plays a photographer, a dreamer, a curious individual who lives the busy life of a high-flier, photographic artist, much like the popular London photographers of the time; David Hamilton and David Bailey. He treats his work as a part of everyday life, as with most artists, but he also has the arrogance of someone who is good at what he does, and knows it. The film is very European in many ways yet it became popular cultural in the London of the sixties.The art of photography is about imagination and make-beleive, and so is the world of Blow Up where nothing is exactly as it seems. It is all manufactured, including the truth. Is it there? Yes. No it isn't, so lets make-believe it is, or lets make it happen. In this uncertain world the photographer suddenly stumbles on a mystery where he tries to uncover the elusive truth, but he then becomes unraveled by the enigma of what truth is. Is it there or not?People have been trying to find meaning in this film for years but Blow Up is an ethereal romp where nothing is as it seems. So if in the end the meaning is meaningless, just enjoy the ride.Sorry, but the commentary track is senseless. Don't know who did it but it comes from someone trying to find meaning. And that's his problem. Turn it off and enjoy the film.Blow Up is a ""FAB"" film, definitely high on my list.",5,"A great film from another era, an icon of the 1960s",1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,1751,"['teenager', 'sixties', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'mind', 'up', 'be', 'photographer', 'film', 'influenced', 'being', 'comfortable', 'profession', 'photographic', 'artist', 'turn', 'given', 'wonderful', 'life', 'adventure', 'creative', 'rollercoaster', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'review', 'find', 'dated', 'today', 'audiences', 'yet', 'still', 'up', 'icon', '1960s.David', 'Hemmings', 'photographer', 'dreamer', 'curious', 'individual', 'who', 'busy', 'life', 'high-flier', 'photographic', 'artist', 'much', 'popular', 'London', 'photographers', 'time', 'David', 'Hamilton', 'David', 'Bailey', 'work', 'part', 'everyday', 'life', 'most', 'artists', 'also', 'arrogance', 'someone', 'who', 'good', 'what', 'film', 'very', 'European', 'many', 'ways', 'yet', 'became', 'popular', 'cultural', 'London', 'sixties.The', 'art', 'photography', 'imagination', 'make-beleive', 'so', 'world', 'Blow', 'Up', 'where', 'nothing', 'exactly', 'manufactured', 'including', 'truth', 'there', 'Yes', ""n't"", 'so', 'make-believe', 'lets', 'make', 'happen', 'uncertain', 'world', 'photographer', 'suddenly', 'mystery', 'where', 'uncover', 'elusive', 'truth', 'then', 'unraveled', 'enigma', 'what', 'truth', 'not', 'People', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'meaning', 'film', 'years', 'Blow', 'Up', 'ethereal', 'romp', 'where', 'nothing', 'So', 'end', 'meaning', 'meaningless', 'just', 'enjoy', 'ride.Sorry', 'commentary', 'track', 'senseless', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'did', 'someone', 'trying', 'find', 'meaning', 'problem', 'Turn', 'off', 'enjoy', 'film.Blow', 'Up', 'FAB', 'film', 'definitely', 'high', 'list']",N/A
276679,A2Q31IVRP9MYQX,6301966015,"William L. Isley, Jr.","[2, 2]","As the kids say, I got punked, but I&#8217;m glad I did.  My wife and I sat down to watch a suspense film about a photographer who inadvertently photographs a murder.  What we got was a brilliant cinematic presentation of the problem of knowledge and reality.  The film: Michelangelo Antonioni&#8217;s Blowup (1966). SPOILER ALERT.A prominent fashion photographer in 1960&#8217;s swinging London takes photos from a distance of a young woman and an older man kissing in the park.  The woman tries to get the film from him, but he tricks her by giving her a different roll.  As he develops the film, he thinks he sees something.  He blows them up, hence the movie title, and believes he sees a man lurking in the trees with a gun.  Another shot appears to show the corpse of the older man.  At night he goes to the park without his camera and sees the body.  After failing to get his agent to go to the park with him to see the body, he goes by himself.  There is no body.  Bewildered, he watches a group miming a tennis match without ball or racquets and joins in the pretense when he goes to fetch the nonexistent ball.  He watches from a distance and begins to hear the sound of the ball being batted back and forth.  The movie ends with the camera panning to show the photographer standing alone in the grass, and then he disappears.My wife and I felt cheated.  What happened to the body?  Who committed the murder?  As I thought about the movie, the suspicion grew that something else was going on; so I watched it again.  Blowup is dealing with the issue of epistemology, the theory of knowledge.  In particular, it explores the question of the relationship between perspective and reality.  Is the world we perceive our own creation or is it really there as we see it?Here&#8217;s my interpretation.  The photographer controls others and creates reality by means of his camera, an instrument that is navely understood as objectively capturing reality.  The models that he poses and photographs have a lifeless mannequin-like appearance, and the photographer himself seems to be bored and drifting.  His ennui is only overcome when he photographs the couple in the park and then becomes convinced with each enlargement of the photos that he has evidence of a murder.  A crucial turning point is when the photographer asks the wife of Bill, his abstract artist friend, about the only remaining photo, which has become quite grainy after being blown up.  She comments that it looks like her husband&#8217;s paintings.  Significantly, Bill had said that he only finds meaning in his paintings after he has finished them.Could it be that the murder was just a creation of the photographer&#8217;s imagination?  There are hints that this may be the case.  First, the body is not there when he returns without his camera, which may signify that the whole scene only existed through the lens of the image-producing artist&#8217;s tool.  Second, no one sees the body or even the woman in the park except the photographer.  In addition, later in the film when he thinks that he sees her again, she vanishes and he cannot find her.Existential meaninglessness is also a thematic element of Antonioni&#8217;s film.  The photographer is clearly bored, cynical and self-centered.  The only escape from his ennui is what possibly turns out to be a self-created reality of a murder.  Significantly, the photographer and the woman in the park are nameless in the movie.  Are they even real?  When the photographer for once allows himself to be caught up in somebody else&#8217;s world and joins in with the pretended world of the mimes, he too disappears like the woman and the corpse that only he has seen.Antonioni plays with us viewers.  We think that we are seeing the reality that the photographer sees or creates.  However, just before the tennis scene, the photographer is standing under a tree.  We see a branch with leaves slightly moving from a light breeze.  Next we see that the photographer was not even looking at the branch.  Given the movie camera&#8217;s pan at the end of the film in which the photographer disappears, we are reminded that we have not been seeing things, whether real or not, from the photographer&#8217;s viewpoint.  We have only been seeing what Antonioni has chosen to show us.I do not know what Antonioni intended, but the conclusion I draw is that once we abandon the conviction that there is an objective reality which we perceive rather than create, we spiral inexorably downward into a world of illusion that empties life of joy and is ultimately destructive of others and ourselves.  Of course, the existence of an objective reality outside of our mind does not mean that our perceptions of that reality are not limited.  They are limited and that is not necessarily bad, but that is the subject for another essay.You should be aware that the film contains nudity and drug use, but I highly recommend watching Antonioni&#8217;s film.
