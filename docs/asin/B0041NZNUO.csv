1381965,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0041NZNUO,Compay,"[0, 0]","Across the Line (also known as The Exodus of Charlie Wright) isn't quite movie-theater quality, but stands out as one of the better straight to video flicks I've seen in a long time.The film tells the story of Charlie Wright, a California businessman that has defrauded others out of billions of dollars. Wright takes flight to Mexico where he's pursued by the FBI, Tijuana gangsters, and Russian mafia mercenaries.For being straight to DVD, the film is shot extremely well. Great visuals of Mexico, plus a solid movie score. Director R. Ellis Frazier, who himself lived in Mexico for a number of years, takes a page from Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" with interesting color correction styles. Frazier's talent shows in this film, and could be the next Antoine Fuqua if given a better budget to work with.The film also features an interesting cast of actors. Aidan Quinn appropriately comes off as a shell of a man, as the lead character Charlie Wright. But it's Andy Garcia who steals the show, in an excellent performance as aging Mexican crime lord Jorge Garza. His role is complemented by Danny Pino, who I became a fan of from his days as Armadillo Quintero in The Shield. For being almost 50, Gina Gershon as Garza's wife looks just as hot as she did in Showgirls, though she doesn't get much screen time. The rest of the cast is rounded out by experienced actors such as Corbin Bernsen, Raymond J. Barry, Luke Goss and Bokeem Woodbine.The plot itself is fairly simple, but it ultimately works thanks to a few quality performances and its theme of redemption. Don't expect too much if you're an action junkie, as shootout scenes are limited. Across the Line is a step up from La Linea, the last Frazier-directed movie I watched. But due to a low budget, it's definitely not on the level with Traffic or Man on Fire.If you like crime dramas with a bit of meaning behind them, you should absolutely check this film out.",4,Surprisingly Good for Straight-to-Blu-Ray,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,1916,"['Line', 'also', 'known', 'Exodus', 'Charlie', 'Wright', ""n't"", 'quite', 'movie-theater', 'quality', 'out', 'one', 'better', 'straight', 'video', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.The', 'film', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Wright', 'California', 'businessman', 'defrauded', 'others', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Wright', 'flight', 'Mexico', 'where', 'pursued', 'FBI', 'Tijuana', 'gangsters', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'mercenaries.For', 'being', 'straight', 'DVD', 'film', 'shot', 'extremely', 'well', 'Great', 'visuals', 'Mexico', 'solid', 'movie', 'score', 'Director', 'R.', 'Ellis', 'Frazier', 'who', 'lived', 'Mexico', 'number', 'years', 'page', 'Soderbergh', 'Traffic', 'interesting', 'color', 'correction', 'styles', 'Frazier', 'talent', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'next', 'Antoine', 'Fuqua', 'given', 'better', 'budget', 'work', 'with.The', 'film', 'also', 'interesting', 'cast', 'actors', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'appropriately', 'off', 'shell', 'man', 'lead', 'character', 'Charlie', 'Wright', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'who', 'show', 'excellent', 'performance', 'aging', 'Mexican', 'crime', 'lord', 'Jorge', 'Garza', 'role', 'complemented', 'Danny', 'Pino', 'who', 'became', 'fan', 'days', 'Armadillo', 'Quintero', 'Shield', 'being', 'almost', '50', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'Garza', 'wife', 'just', 'as', 'hot', 'did', 'Showgirls', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'rest', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'experienced', 'actors', 'such', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'Raymond', 'J.', 'Barry', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'ultimately', 'thanks', 'few', 'quality', 'performances', 'theme', 'redemption', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', ""'re"", 'action', 'junkie', 'shootout', 'scenes', 'are', 'limited', 'Line', 'step', 'up', 'La', 'Linea', 'last', 'Frazier-directed', 'movie', 'watched', 'due', 'low', 'budget', 'definitely', 'not', 'level', 'Traffic', 'Man', 'Fire.If', 'crime', 'dramas', 'bit', 'meaning', 'should', 'absolutely', 'check', 'film', 'out']",N/A
1381966,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B0041NZNUO,Doctor.Generosity,"[0, 0]","I really liked this movie and recommend it. The filmaking, acting and cinematography are skilled.However, it received some negative reviews here and I can see why. The writer / director Ellis Frazier has mixed up two genres in a way that confuses viewers. The movie starts out as a straight police / action flick with escaped criminals, angry FBI beaurocrats, car chases, gun play, etc. But midway through it morphs into something else - an introspective study of how men evaluate their lives in relation to their obligations to family. The contrast is jarring. Perhaps Frazier changed his own idea of the movie at the half way point, or maybe he thought he was adding class to the car chase scenario. Doesn't work. The tender relationship of Charlie Wilson to an ageing prostitute, his search for his daughter, Andy Garcia's character as a gangster attempting to protect his family legacy - OK but doesn't go along with car chases.Frazier is early in his career as a director and talented. Hope we will see more from him.(Odd note; there are elements of the movie that seemed to parallel the Townes Van Zandt song Pancho and Lefty - ""We coulda had him any day, just let him go - out of kindness I suppose.""

1381967,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0041NZNUO,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 1]","""Across the Line"" is a straight to video 2010 crime drama ostensibly about a crooked financier's attempt to escape from the FBI, the Tijuana mafia, and the Russian mob. But beyond the obvious, the film is really about coming to terms with the consequences of your choices, as the financier (Aidan Quinn), the boss of the Russian mob (Ray Barry), the boss of the Tijuana mafia (Andy Garcia), and the head of the FBI (Mario Van Peebles) each reach inside themselves to deal with the problems that the financier's flight have created.There are many excellent performances in this film. Andy Garcia is the obvious standout, but one comes to expect this high level from a man who has given us dozens of fine performances (""The Godfather, Part 3"", ""Things to do in Denver When you're dead"", ""Internal Affairs"", ""Black Rain""). The big surprise is Mario Van Peebles who has specialized in films like ""Baadassss"" and ""New Jack City"" but who gives in this film a subtle and layered performance that is probably a career highlight.But the real surprise is the marvelous work on Claudia Ferri as an aging working girl who helps Quinn locate his missing daughter. Ferri is best known for her work on TV (""The Killing"", ""The Last Templar""). FWIW -Ferri played Quinn's wife in ""The Assignment"" (1997).The film is written, produced, and directed by R. Ellis Frazier. Frazier made his bones working for Ronald Shusett who is well known for films like ""Alien"" (1979), ""Above the Law"" (1988), and ""Total Recall"" (1990)There's not a lot of action in this film, and it consists mainly of the principals contemplating their futures in the light of their past. Quinn must decide between escaping or searching for his missing daughter at his own peril. Van Peebles must decide between the demands of his job and his humanity. Garcia must weigh his own life against the well being of his family. Barry has to consider the desire to recover his stolen millions against the need to remain under the radar. It's very interesting to see these dramas work themselves out.Bottom line - if you're looking for an action crime Mexican drama (like ""Man on Fire"") this isn't the film for you, but if you want to see a well acted film about life's choices, played against a crime background, this is a good film.",4,Good performances,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,2275,"['Line', 'straight', 'video', '2010', 'crime', 'drama', 'ostensibly', 'crooked', 'financier', 'attempt', 'escape', 'FBI', 'Tijuana', 'mafia', 'Russian', 'mob', 'obvious', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'coming', 'terms', 'consequences', 'choices', 'financier', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'boss', 'Russian', 'mob', 'Ray', 'Barry', 'boss', 'Tijuana', 'mafia', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'head', 'FBI', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'reach', 'inside', 'deal', 'problems', 'financier', 'flight', 'have', 'created.There', 'are', 'many', 'excellent', 'performances', 'film', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'obvious', 'standout', 'one', 'expect', 'high', 'level', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'dozens', 'fine', 'performances', 'Godfather', 'Part', '3', 'Things', 'do', 'Denver', 'When', ""'re"", 'dead', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'Black', 'Rain', 'big', 'surprise', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'who', 'specialized', 'films', 'Baadassss', 'New', 'Jack', 'City', 'who', 'film', 'subtle', 'layered', 'performance', 'probably', 'career', 'real', 'surprise', 'marvelous', 'work', 'Claudia', 'Ferri', 'aging', 'working', 'girl', 'who', 'Quinn', 'locate', 'missing', 'daughter', 'Ferri', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'TV', 'Killing', 'Last', 'Templar', 'FWIW', '-Ferri', 'played', 'Quinn', 'wife', 'Assignment', '1997', '.The', 'film', 'written', 'produced', 'directed', 'R.', 'Ellis', 'Frazier', 'Frazier', 'made', 'bones', 'working', 'Ronald', 'Shusett', 'who', 'well', 'known', 'films', 'Alien', '1979', 'Law', '1988', 'Total', 'Recall', '1990', 'not', 'lot', 'action', 'film', 'mainly', 'principals', 'contemplating', 'futures', 'light', 'past', 'Quinn', 'must', 'decide', 'escaping', 'searching', 'missing', 'daughter', 'own', 'peril', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'must', 'decide', 'demands', 'job', 'humanity', 'Garcia', 'must', 'weigh', 'own', 'life', 'well', 'being', 'family', 'Barry', 'consider', 'desire', 'recover', 'stolen', 'millions', 'need', 'remain', 'radar', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'dramas', 'work', 'out.Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'looking', 'action', 'crime', 'Mexican', 'drama', 'Man', 'Fire', ""n't"", 'film', 'want', 'see', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'life', 'choices', 'played', 'crime', 'background', 'good', 'film']",N/A

1381971,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0041NZNUO,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[3, 3]","This is one of those films that is hard to review; I actually enjoyed it but was left sort of unfulfilled. It is based on the true story of Charlie Wright. His investment company carried out a Ponzi scam investment and by the time the balloon went up, he had managed to get at least a couple of billion dollars into offshore bank accounts. There was over ten million gone in the first place so this made this Americas biggest ever investment fraud.Charlie (Aiden Quinn) realises the game is up and decides, not unreasonably some might say, to do a runner with the cash; we must not judge he has been brought up in the world of investment bankers after all.The problem is one of his unfortunate clients is a boss in the Russian mob. They decide to hire a specialist gun who will get him and bring the money back. Enter Damon (a lean looking Luke Goss of eighties cr@p band `Bros' or `Toss' as I used to call them). He gets together a crew and starts looking for their man, and they are seriously tooled up. Meanwhile Charlie has turned up in Tijuana, Mexico to search out the one woman who truly loved him. That love was however twenty years ago and of course he used her and then abandoned her to become a real banker.I am forgetting `the feds', yeah they are always involved and this lot are headed up by a statesman like Mario Van Peebles as Agent Hobbs. His boss is the usual ball breaker who wants Wright to come back and face the music no matter what. Third problem for the unassuming thief (sorry I mean banker) Mr Wright is that he is in Tijuana which belongs to Jorge Garza, sort of small time crime lord of the border crossing and played by a bearded Andy Garcia who has some debts and knows he can shake down Charlie if he gets there first.So the scene is set and there are some very good moments and some solid performances especially so given the sparse script, a fact which is only apparent on reflection. Quinn puts in an excellent performance as does Van Peebles, I thought Goss was being a bit Jason Statham at one point, but that was me being a biatch, he is actually quite good and I hope he gets more roles as he does have something to bring to the party. The real problem is the outcomes which just lack a bit they are either pandering to the real outcome, in which case it did not happen like this or it is al made up, either way this is one for the journey and not the destination. It has had mixed reviews, but it is above average and not 3 stars or really 4, but I have rounded up and not down hence the rating. I must finish by saying despite the moral decrepitude of everything Charlie Wright did, Quinn brings such humanity to the role that you can't help ending up liking him, now that is some feat.",4,"A Corrupt Banker, A Lady of the Night and the singer from Bros!",1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,2727,"['one', 'films', 'hard', 'review', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'left', 'sort', 'unfulfilled', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Wright', 'investment', 'company', 'carried', 'out', 'Ponzi', 'scam', 'investment', 'time', 'balloon', 'went', 'up', 'had', 'managed', 'get', 'least', 'couple', 'billion', 'dollars', 'offshore', 'bank', 'accounts', 'was', 'ten', 'million', 'gone', 'first', 'place', 'so', 'made', 'Americas', 'biggest', 'ever', 'investment', 'fraud.Charlie', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'game', 'up', 'decides', 'not', 'unreasonably', 'might', 'say', 'do', 'runner', 'cash', 'must', 'not', 'judge', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'world', 'investment', 'bankers', 'all.The', 'problem', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'clients', 'boss', 'Russian', 'mob', 'decide', 'hire', 'specialist', 'gun', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'bring', 'money', 'back', 'Enter', 'Damon', 'lean', 'looking', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'eighties', 'cr', '@', 'p', 'band', 'Bros', 'Toss', 'used', 'call', 'together', 'crew', 'looking', 'man', 'are', 'seriously', 'tooled', 'up', 'Meanwhile', 'Charlie', 'turned', 'up', 'Tijuana', 'Mexico', 'search', 'out', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'loved', 'love', 'was', 'however', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'course', 'used', 'then', 'abandoned', 'become', 'real', 'banker.I', 'am', 'forgetting', 'feds', 'are', 'always', 'involved', 'lot', 'are', 'headed', 'up', 'statesman', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'Agent', 'Hobbs', 'boss', 'usual', 'ball', 'breaker', 'who', 'Wright', 'come', 'back', 'face', 'music', 'matter', 'what', 'Third', 'problem', 'unassuming', 'thief', 'sorry', 'mean', 'banker', 'Mr', 'Wright', 'Tijuana', 'Jorge', 'Garza', 'sort', 'small', 'time', 'crime', 'lord', 'border', 'crossing', 'played', 'bearded', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'who', 'debts', 'can', 'shake', 'down', 'Charlie', 'there', 'scene', 'set', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'moments', 'solid', 'performances', 'especially', 'so', 'given', 'sparse', 'script', 'fact', 'only', 'apparent', 'reflection', 'Quinn', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'thought', 'Goss', 'was', 'being', 'bit', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'being', 'biatch', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'hope', 'more', 'roles', 'have', 'something', 'bring', 'party', 'real', 'problem', 'outcomes', 'just', 'lack', 'bit', 'are', 'pandering', 'real', 'outcome', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'al', 'made', 'up', 'way', 'one', 'journey', 'not', 'destination', 'had', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'above', 'average', 'not', '3', 'stars', 'really', '4', 'have', 'rounded', 'up', 'not', 'down', 'hence', 'rating', 'must', 'finish', 'saying', 'moral', 'decrepitude', 'everything', 'Charlie', 'Wright', 'did', 'Quinn', 'such', 'humanity', 'role', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'ending', 'up', 'liking', 'now', 'feat']",N/A
