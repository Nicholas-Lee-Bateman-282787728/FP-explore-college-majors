1667314,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00EIEPJUK,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[8, 11]","The film is also titled ""Zero in the System."" This is not its own sequel. Earl Coleman (Mike Simmons) has spent 5 years in prison. While in prison his sister dies from crack cocaine. Earl gets a regular job, but then goes ""Charles Bronson"" all over the dealers in his neighborhood. He also attempts to be a big brother while roughing up litterbugs.Much of the film is spent developing the relationship between Earl and single mom Keisha (Tabitha Holbert). There are a few bad guy scenes, but this film doesn't cater to action/horror/ or blood fans. Much of the punching is done with a fist going at the camera.I thought Simmons did an excellent job in his acting debut while the supporting cast needed help. The plot was slow developing and wasn't worth the wait.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",3,IT'S MY NATURE.
