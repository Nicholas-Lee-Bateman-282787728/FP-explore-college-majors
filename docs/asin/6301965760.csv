The film captures and struggle with all the competing interests inside a corporate entity of the 50's where the board members are passionate about their company (maybe something that is lost today) but each have a different way that they think is the best way and hence come into conflict.  This film doesn't get distracted with side stories or romances or earth shattering repercussions, it's about &#34;real&#34; people who have different visions and faults trying to overcome a not unwelcome but still uncertain change. There is passion, and the feet of clay of some of the board members come into play, but it is one of those stories that makes sense and you are uncertain of the outcome which is what makes it interesting.",4,"A Decent, Serious Film about the Struggles of a mid 20th Century Corporate Board",1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1077,"['am', 'Bill', 'Holden', 'fan', 'simple', 'film', 'works', 'very', 'rare', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'inner', 'workings', 'Corporate', 'Board', 'Directors', 'struggle', 'capture', 'top', 'leadership', 'business', 'passing', 'guiding', 'light', 'leader', 'unexpected', 'void', 'first', 'time', 'repressed', 'frustrations', 'come', 'surface', 'film', 'captures', 'struggle', 'competing', 'interests', 'corporate', 'entity', '50', 'where', 'board', 'members', 'are', 'passionate', 'company', 'maybe', 'something', 'lost', 'today', 'have', 'different', 'way', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'hence', 'come', 'conflict', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'distracted', 'side', 'stories', 'romances', 'earth', 'shattering', 'repercussions', '34', 'real', '34', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'visions', 'faults', 'trying', 'overcome', 'not', 'unwelcome', 'still', 'uncertain', 'change', 'passion', 'feet', 'clay', 'board', 'members', 'come', 'play', 'one', 'stories', 'sense', 'are', 'uncertain', 'outcome', 'what', 'interesting']",N/A

276175,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301965760,Ed Uyeshima,"[10, 10]","Finally on DVD, this forgotten 1954 drama would certainly be ripe for a remake in the age of Enron, Halliburton and Tyco. As it stands, it's a slick MGM package directed by Robert Wise with an all-star cast but also a surprisingly incisive film about a corporate power struggle within a leading furniture company. Even though there is an air of soap opera naivet&eacute; about it, the movie benefits significantly from an economical, provocative script by Ernest Lehman, his first for the big screen, and a powerful cast of star actors performing like a well-oiled machine. An intriguing subtlety of the story is that the company is publicly held and consequently questions regarding stockholder value and dividend payouts take on a surprising dramatic resonance.The linear plot focuses on the sudden death of Tredway Corporation president Avery Bullard on a Friday afternoon. With no succession plan in place - a gap felt by many companies today - six VPs are all possible candidates to take over - perennial also-ran Alderson, oily Caswell, weak-willed Dudley, retirement-ready Grimm, power-hungry Shaw and up-and-comer Walling. Each has his own advantages and obvious shortcomings, with the additional complication of Julia Tredway, the chief stockholder, who is also the daughter of the company founder and as it turns out, Bullard's frustrated mistress. What follows are the weekend machinations of the men, culminating in a Monday morning showdown in the corporate boardroom where the successor is named. What I like most about the film is Wise's no-frills approach toward what could have been a rather by-the-numbers story about company politics. He takes the predictably episodic aspect of following the five men and integrates the threads tightly and seamlessly. Wise uses no music to highlight the drama, which ironically allows the histrionics to work on their own, and a neat first-person POV to open the film dramatically.The heavy-duty cast does well in economic turns that epitomize the concept of ensemble. As Walling, William Holden was at the height of his film career in 1954 (he was also inSabrina,The Country GirlandThe Bridges at Toko-Rithat year), and he provides the comparatively youthful charisma to get away with the high-minded speech at the end. With her trademark frog-throated sincerity, June Allyson plays Walling's dutiful wife with efficiency. Walter Pidgeon also makes his moments count as Alderson, especially in the cathartic scene when he comes to accept his own limitations. As Dudley, Paul Douglas plays another variation of the bearish, brash role he played in Joseph Mankiewicz'sA Letter to Three Wives, while a young Shelley Winters is surprisingly low-key as his secretary/mistress.Louis Calhern turns his dignified persona inside out as Caswell, and Nina Foch brings a palpable sense of desperate grief to the role of Bullard's executive assistant. Dean Jagger has precious few moments as Grimm, while Barbara Stanwyck moves securely into Joan Crawford-at-Pepsi territory and gets to have a major meltdown as Julia. The final scene she has with Allyson speaking about the role of the tolerant wife is a dated piece of pre-feminist whimsy. Yet, out of this impressive gallery of scenery chewers, the best performance comes from Fredric March, who brings uncompromising, Machiavellian malevolence to a simmering boil as Shaw. The last scenes move so quickly that the ending feels a bit pat, but no matter, this movie still makes the backroom world of corporate politics utterly fascinating.The 2007 DVD, released as a single disc or as part of the five-disc, six-filmBarbara Stanwyck - The Signature Collection, boasts an enthusiastic commentary track from maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone, who views the film as a cultural milestone as well as a cinematic one (his ownWall Streetis obviously inspired by it). As was typical with theatrical screenings back in the 1950's, there are a couple of vintage 1954 MGM shorts included - one an 11-minute live-action Pete Smith featurette, ""Out for Fun"", and the other is a Tex Avery cartoon, ""Billy Boy"".

A good cast for one, with a passable script-- resulting in good acting all around without having to dance with terrible dialog.  The plot does, however, seem a little thin, which is why I refer to the script as only &#34;passable&#34;.And two, Holden's soliloquy at the end underscores the importance of everyone who makes up a company, not just a lone whiz-kid or those at the top-- a nice contrast to the ideas to the contrary as found in another but rather silly business-world film made about 5 years earlier, The Fountainhead.  Perhaps Apple Computer couldn't have done it without Steve Jobs, but Steve couldn't have done it without thousands of others on the team.

FUSCO ""yawnmower""","[4, 4]","There are so many amazing aspects to this overlooked film -- cast, design, concept, philosophy, lighting, direction, sound.There is no sound-track first of all, which was highly unusual in 1953 (not to say at any time).  Only the tolling of a bell in 'the tower' which houses the executive suite of a large furniture corporation.  More amazing is the fact that one does not notice, or even miss, the lack of musical accompaniment to this script- and character-driven drama.The cast is stunning.  Have there ever been more great actors gathered together than in this talented ensemble?  William Holden is perfect as the youngest member of the board of directors, and a designer with his heart in the company.  Barbara Stanwick was never better or more powerful.  Mr. Wise seems to have brought out the best in everyone, and each actor is a stand-out.  The man was, of course, no slouch when it came to big production numbers.  After all, he gave us West Side Story and The Sound of Music, too.With the exception of a few exteriors, the entire film was shot in the studio.  Sets that look right out of an executive office in the Woolworth Building create an atmosphere of quiet luxury against which the personal dramas and criminal activity take place.  Mood and ambiance are enhanced by the wonderfully effective lighting.The film has proved incredibly prescient in describing the take-over of good old American manufacturing by corporate lawyers and accountants.  It was in the 50's that the Enron philosophy got started, and manufacturing jobs began to be fazed out and shipped out.  Not helpful to the bottom line, I'm afraid.  For this reason alone, the film is as fresh and pertinent now as it was almost 60 years ago.There is another big fan of this film:  Oliver Stone.  He provides a laudatory, humorous, and informative commentary track about the film, the director, the cast, the design -- all of which he loves.  His enthusiasm is wonderfully infectious and adds another dimension to the enjoyment of Executive Suite.

Forget ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" and the other seriously over the top spoofs of business. ""Executive Suite"" is the real thing.Fifty years old, scenes ring true. William Holden's closing, impassioned speech, about the need to invest in the future instead of dividend maximization, is a classic treatment, useful for a business school class. What is perhaps most remarkable is the timeless nature of his points, about customers, quality, pride, and growth. Sure, the technology is dated. Telegrams. Dial phones. The board room looks like the reception area to Fred Munster's house. People step on and off planes without security, parking problems, or laptops in hand. But that only makes the story all the more credible. The important things haven't changed. And it shows that some things we think are new problems in business -- insider trading, board manipulation, sexual harrassment -- are at least as old as this fine film, certainly older.Here's the basic story line: The president of Treadway furniture firm dies in the street en route to a train and a meeting in Philadelphia. An opportunistic Treadway executive of sees the crowd in the street and -- shades of today -- shorts the company's stock. The president's death is not immediately known to all, leaving some intrigue and lots of ambiguity. And, oh yes, there's the top salesman having an affair with a nubile Shelley Winters, and a frozen-appearing Barbara Stanwyck -- a Treadway -- also apparently on the verge of suicide from the cold shoulder she has received from the overworked, now-dead president.Counting votes, twisting arms, and playing politics, Holden and Pidgeon contrive a plan to move the election of the president in their direction. The last twelve minutes of the film, including an apology from Holden's jealous-of-how-the-work-consumes-her-husband wife -- a glowing June Allyson -- allows hopes and schemes to unravel and others to gel.If it is still out of stock, don't be shy about perusing the used VHS offerings.

This is an excellent film about the corporate greed which reveals how executives manipulate things to drive the corporation in the direction they choose so that their personal interest are protected while ignoring the welfare of the employees' who do the hard work. Hollywood has made some great films about this subject especially in 1930s after the Great Depression and many of them takes a penetrating look at the shallowness and unhappiness in the personal lives of corporate executives. Those days, dysfunctional families were identified with rich and wealthy than the middle class. In this1954 movie, director Robert Wise shows the intensity of the boardroom melodrama by eliminating the background musical soundtrack. He has cleverly set the stage for this story with some of the Hollywood's best, which includes Barbara Stanwyck, Fredric March, William Holden, June Allyson, Shelly Winters, and Walter Pidgeon. Wise is not a novice for making classic films, his accomplishments includes; West Side Story, The Sound of Music, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Somebody up There Likes Me (starring Paul Newman), and Star!This is a remarkably fascinating power struggle by a brilliant ensemble. Wise allows that none of these characters is perfect, but that makes them all the more watchable. I was most impressed by the performance of Nina Foch who is not only beautiful but also brainy. She knows who the best person to lead the company is, and she is steadfast in standing by the right man. Her brilliant performance as Erica Martin, the senior administrator of the company earned her nomination in the 1955 Academy Awards in the best supporting actress category. William Holden once stated that Spencer Tracy and Fredric March were his acting heroes, and he was fortunate enough to work with Fredric March in this film, but he never worked with Tracy.

The decisive meeting will take place in the ""Executive Suite""... This is an outstanding ensemble film in which about ten persons each have an important part (e.g. William Holden, June Allyson, Barbara Stanwyck, Nina Foch, Water Pidgeon, Dean Jagger, Shelley Winters, Fredric March). They all give excellent performances. Especially the women are great in showing how emotional feelings have to be hidden in the world of top management. Stanwyck, Foch and Winters each have a significant scene with a ""silent scream"" which is more touching than any overacting. Furthermore, the picture is perfectly constructed with all its linked subplots culminating in the final meeting, using no musical soundtrack at all, but the dramatic sound of a nearby huge bell. And the plot is more up-to-date than ever: Holden is the only engineer in the board of directors, mainly composed by mere accountants. Should one stick to the product to be sold or should one only stick to profit? ""Wall Street""-director Oliver Stone explains in the audio commentary that in the fifties, the great US enterprises were taken over by a second generation of managers who had not built them up and who had no knowledge about the fabrication of their products.

276197,A2NK7K9DLLSBMC,6301965760,T.R. Hammer,"[0, 19]","The death of the president of a large furniture company... there's the premise of a riveting drama. This was one of the most tedious old movies I've ever seen. I was bitterly disappointed because the cast is an all-star cast. Many old movies are slower than movies today at getting going with the drama, but this one was the worst of them all. There was absolutely nothing about the man who died for the audience to care. He wasn't a famous person. His character hadn't been developed before he died. Nothing. Even the people who have to deal with his death are dull as dishwater.The actual ""drama"" is so light. The tension isn't thick. The 'plot' is dragged out with no end in sight. There are no interesting characters. Emotions are toned down. The script isn't clever or interesting. Everybody is in a bad mood. It's all somber and sober. It's like watching a funeral in slow motion. I couldn't watch even half of it.You won't be surprised to learn that a TV show spin-off of this dull flick died quickly. Note that nobody else has ever since Executive Suite tried to make a similar movie--certainly no remake. There are dramatic business films out there like Wall Street. They have so many qualities that are absent from Executive Suite.Who might like this? Business school students.

276198,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6301965760,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","As previous viewers have noted, this neglected film deserves to be ranked among the best of American films -- not just of the 1950s, but overall. A sharp, multi-faceted exploration of American business at the crossroads in the early 1950s, it examines the two paths American business could have taken -- first, the old-fashioned path of quality goods & respect for the public, with plenty of room for a reasonable profit; second, the path we did take, where metrics & bean-counters rule everything, and nothing matters except squeezing out a few more pennies of profit for those at the top, and everyone else be damned.Based upon a best-selling novel (well worth reading, by the way), the story begins simply & starkly: the head of a major company (whom we never see face to face) drops dead in the street without leaving a chosen successor. The board of directors must then choose one from among themselves, with the prototypical 1-percenter (Frederic March) positioning himself to claim the throne. If this means insider trading, blackmail, or whatever else is necessary, he'll do it to get what he wants. Yet he's not just a paper-thin villain twirling his black moustache -- clearly this is how he sees the world, as an accountant's ledger -- and he obviously believes that what he's doing is best for the company & the stockholders, the only ones who really matter to him.Reluctantly opposing him is the younger research & development man (William Holden), someone who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty in the manufacturing plants & who knows the workers as actual human beings. At first he only wants to support another board member, someone to oppose Frederic March; but as the story progresses, he sees that none of the men he thought might fill the bill can actually do the job. At last he's driven to seek it for himself, even as events move more & more against him.But that's just the barest outline of the plot. The all-star cast isn't just there for name value -- every character has a part to play, a personality to reveal, a sub-plot of his or her own to resolve. And while the 1950s business world was very much a man's world, we're given several supposedly subsidiary female characters who turn out to possess a lot of will, drive, and integrity -- often more than the men they work for & sometimes love. Even the slinky mistress/arm candy who might easily be dismissed as a blonde bimbo turns out to have a sardonic wit, acting almost as a Greek chorus to her hedonistic executive lover.Which brings up the script, written by Ernest Lehman. It's a marvel of precision & insight, deftly letting us know everything we need to know about the characters & the story with a minimum of exposition. A single line of dialogue often reveals the true nature of its speaker, so much so that we know more about him than he does himself. Often a minor character who appears for just one brief scene & gets just 2 or 3 lines of dialogue serves to highlight an entire aspect of the film's world, as when the employees who fear losing their jobs momentarily talk with William Holden. There are no faceless ciphers here; everyone is a human being, with a life & a struggle to make something of it.I have the earlier studio edition of the DVD, which features an informative & thoughtful commentary track by Oliver Stone -- I'm not sure if the Warner Archive re-release features it as well. But if you can find a copy with the commentary, you won't be disappointed. Stone talks in depth about the film, both as cinema & as social portrait, pointing out how American business took the predatory approach that dominates & destroys the country now.In many ways, the film strikes me as similar to the scathing TV dramas Rod Serling wrote, with his harried, ulcer-eaten, conscience-stricken mid-level businessmen -- his film ""Patterns"" would make a good double feature with this film, in fact. It's not an attack on business per se -- if anything, it's a plea for an honest, human business model -- and as such, it's all the more timely today.
