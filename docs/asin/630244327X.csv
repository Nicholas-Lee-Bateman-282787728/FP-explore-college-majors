Ernest Dickerson's gritty street drama about four friends who grew up together in Harlem is emotional, convincing, yet not complete. Epps is great and the highlight of the film as `Q' the man in the crew which is skeptical about robbing a grocery store. Shakur gives a convincing over-the-top performance as `Bishop' the instigator and heart of the group, although Shakur has done better in films such as `Gridlock'd' and `Above the Rim'. Jermaine Hopkins and Khalil Kain were also good as the other two members of the crew. Samuel L. Jackson also gives a very cool performance as trip a local bar owner. Overall a good film, with some not so realistic plot turns, but still great message and characters.",4,Good debut from Shakur,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,767,"['Made', '1992', 'clothes', 'hair', 'music', 'cry', 'early', '1990s', 'Ernest', 'Dickerson', 'gritty', 'street', 'drama', 'four', 'friends', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'Harlem', 'emotional', 'convincing', 'yet', 'not', 'complete', 'Epps', 'great', 'highlight', 'film', 'Q', 'man', 'crew', 'skeptical', 'robbing', 'grocery', 'store', 'Shakur', 'convincing', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'Bishop', 'instigator', 'heart', 'group', 'Shakur', 'done', 'better', 'films', 'such', 'Gridlock', ""'d"", 'Rim', 'Jermaine', 'Hopkins', 'Khalil', 'Kain', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'other', 'two', 'members', 'crew', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'also', 'very', 'cool', 'performance', 'trip', 'local', 'bar', 'owner', 'Overall', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'realistic', 'plot', 'turns', 'still', 'great', 'message', 'characters']",Juice VHS

312711,A1R9U4RJ5V4A8T,630244327X,"A viewer ""A viewer""","[1, 5]","By far this is 2pac's best movie. He auditioned for the role of 'Bishop' as well as his buddy Treach. Treach admitted in The 2pac Thug Angel special that after seeing 2pac's audition, he knew right then and there that no way he would beat out 2pac for that role. And 2pac further validated that point with his powerful performance. Everytime I think of Juice, I think of 2pac's character. Treach actually got a different role as a homeboy of 'Radames'. It wasn't a big role but it's always good to see Treach in a movie. As for 'Radames', the first few times I saw him in the movie, I really didn't like him but when I found out he was in Empire, I started to respect this actor more. The actor's name is Vincent Laresca and I found out on his IMdB page that he was only a teenager in this movie. To me, that is real impressive how he played that part at such a young age. Another actor who also as a teenager did great was Omar Epps. He was great playing 'Q', a kid who wants to get respect by being a DJ. Epps was born to play that part. Khalil Kain did a great job as 'Raheem' and Jermaine Hopkins did a great job as 'Steel'. And you also notice a very reconizable face in a very small role by our standards. I'm talking about the legendary Samuel L. Jackson as 'Trip'. It wasn't a big role for him but his performance was just an added bonus to this powerful piece of work directed by Ernest Dickerson. Dickerson as you know worked with Spike Lee on 'Malcolm X' so it's no surprise that he did a fantastic job directing this movie. Who's a better director to learn from than Spike Lee? It just shows you how successful someone can be working with Spike Lee. This is one of the best urban-youth gangster films of all-time.

The two main characters Q(Omar Epps) and Bishop(the late 2Pac) put on great performances in this movie.  The story goes like this.  There was a four man group.  There was bishop, Q, steel, and Rahim.  Q has the dream of becoming a big time DJ, Bishop wants respect, steel wants to have fun, and Rahim is the leader and tries to deal with the issues of losing his girlfriend who is the mother of his child.Bishop was alaways the trouble-maker of the group as he gets into fights with a puerto rican group and is constantly running from the law.  Everything is cool within the group until a friend that they knew got killed in his attempted robbery.  Bishop really starts to go crazy as he make the plan to rob this store of the guy he hates.  Q didn't want anything to do with it because of the fact that he entered into a DJ contest and was out to prove that he is the cream of the crop.  Bishop gets a gun and appears to be memerized with it and ends up ruining his life more than he ever imagined. They agree to do the robbery in the part where Q didn't have to perform.  The event ended up making changes for the whole group and Bishop loses control and ends up killing the owner of the store and then starts a shooting spree. One by one he mows down his group.  First, he kills Rahim, shoots Steel but never dies (or so we believe) and is out to get Q.  Q tries to snap some sense into Bishop but in the end Bishop finds out the hard way that the path he choose was the wrong one.  In the end Q is the last man standing of the group and does eventually go on to pursuit his DJ career.  The movie is not oscar material, but it was a good written script.

He turns an otherwise dismal film into a very entertaining one.His performance is so dynamic, in fact, that I often find myself fast-forwarding through scenes that don't involve him.

Quincy now as ""Q"" (Omar Epps) was a true character earned respect as a scratch-and-mix DJ. But Bishop (played by Shakur), hands down! Bishop was a deep brother with a deadly plan as armed robbery. So, it took a turn when Bishop shot the Latin convenient-store owner, All things of hell broke loose. Bishop rises up as a madman to shot Radames, Quiles, and also Steel and last, Raheem!

Tupac provided the best role although i'm not fond of watching him act, and Omar Epps, one of the most underrated actors made his role belivable and felt.The film was basic, four friends living in Harlem going to the everyday life struggles of living there, then one day finnally come to an agreement of robing a store. This led to the killing of the clerk, of which Tupac's character was responsible of.

Guns and respect go hand-in-hand in the ghetto, and ""Juice"" dares to tell this to a mainstream audience. Although the story is told in a Hollywood manner you never doubt the events that take place haven't happened in reality at some point (except maybe the end).  We meet our main characters through a montage which establishes the basic setting of the film. They are four black teenagers who live in Harlem, yet the way in which Dickerson depicts the atmosphere is not Gothic and pessimistic, just realistic.First there's Q (Epps), a relatively quiet kid who aims to be a professional rap deejay someday, but he seems to be the only one who believes in himself. Then there's Bishop (Shakur), who's short-tempered, hyperactive, and apparently fearless. He always seems to be harassed by a Puerto Rican street gang, but he welcomes their violent challenges. It's hard to tell if he's doing it to keep his rep, or if he's got a death wish. There's also Steel (Hopkins), the generic funny-but-fat kid of the group whom the others constantly pick on. Finally, there's Raheem (Kain), the mediator of the group who seems the most responsible, although he does have an illegitimate child.For the first 45 minutes there is almost no plot, just sheer character development and it's interesting to watch because it's a nice change of pace and the acting is superb. These four young men are an interesting group of characters as the script and their improvisation makes for great camaraderie. Few films are as driven by the acting as this film is. The heist scene is pulled off beautifully, and we realize how much of a talent we lost through Tupac's death. This is one of the best movies that Paramount gave us during the 1990s. The directing and script is also brilliant. In fact Tupac did one of the best acting jobs I've seen any musician do. I mean that guy did the best crazy-villain role I've ever seen..... well probably along side Wesley Snipe in New Jack City.From the first shot to the last, JUICE is a heist flick set in a time where TRUE Hip-Hop was king. It makes me long for the days. I believe this movie was definitely a chilling reality about the ghetto's pride in respect and power. When your living in the ghetto, society automatically paints you out to be a low class individual, but this film brought to life the quest of 4 young men who wanted a name for themselves and did not just want to be another statistic or face in the crowd. Unfortunately the end of their journey left them just that.

Capogrossi,"[2, 3]","You can read other folks reviews to get the gist of the plot, so I'll skip it...Main thing I can say about this movie is that it's a morality tale, but with a lot of action and suspense.The music, the lighting, the camera shots, the cuts, they all add to the suspense that takes off in one crucial scene and then builds. The bedroom DJ scene with ""Q"" cutting up records is one highlight, but as things move forward Tupac's acting really starts to run the film. No matter what you feel about the current cashing on Pac as the James Dean of Hip Hop, he did a dang good job of acting in this film. The creepy detachment, snake like smoothness, and cold calculatedness of Bishop is pretty creepy & memorable. If you want to see one movie that shows the late Tupac's acting skills, this would be it.However, equally as good in my opinion is the acting of Omar Epps. The looks of fear, caution, and trepidation Epps gives are a great contrast to Tupac's eerie ghetto smoothness. Just with his facial expressions, Epps's character is a symbol of the lost innocence and fear experienced by ghetto youth. No matter how much Q just wants to DJ, like many urban youth, through allegience to the wrong friends, he suddenly gets caught up in a tragic, dangerous, and tension filled situation. The danger keeps escalating,  no matter how hard he tries to avoid it, until he decides to confront his nemesis. Epps character shows the mounting suspense in as understated a way as a real urban teenager might have in a similar situation.  In my opinion, really good acting from Epps.The  other important point I will make is that ultimately ""Juice"" is an anti-violence film. When a character is shot, the movie STOPS...the characters are shellshocked...the movie makes sure to highlight the emotional effects of what has just taken place. THAT is the reaction to violence that Hollywood SHOULD display in more films. Violence is still a terrible, shocking thing, and Juice (unlike MANY other films) makes sure THAT message gets across loud and clear, without the characters having to make excessive speeches about it. As we all know, this is a lesson the hip hop generation had to learn through the actual loss of Tupac not too many years after.This is an action packed, suspenseful hip hop movie with very good acting from Epps and the late Pac- a 90's classic",5,90's urban morality tale with suspsene and great acting,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,2343,"['can', 'read', 'other', 'folks', 'reviews', 'get', 'gist', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'Main', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'morality', 'tale', 'lot', 'action', 'suspense.The', 'music', 'lighting', 'camera', 'shots', 'cuts', 'add', 'suspense', 'one', 'crucial', 'scene', 'then', 'builds', 'bedroom', 'DJ', 'scene', 'Q', 'cutting', 'up', 'records', 'one', 'highlight', 'things', 'move', 'forward', 'Tupac', 'acting', 'really', 'run', 'film', 'matter', 'what', 'feel', 'current', 'cashing', 'Pac', 'James', 'Dean', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'did', 'dang', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'film', 'creepy', 'detachment', 'snake', 'smoothness', 'cold', 'calculatedness', 'Bishop', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'memorable', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'movie', 'late', 'Tupac', 'acting', 'skills', 'would', 'be', 'it.However', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'opinion', 'acting', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'looks', 'fear', 'caution', 'trepidation', 'Epps', 'are', 'great', 'contrast', 'Tupac', 'eerie', 'ghetto', 'smoothness', 'Just', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Epps', 'character', 'symbol', 'lost', 'innocence', 'fear', 'experienced', 'ghetto', 'youth', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'Q', 'just', 'DJ', 'many', 'urban', 'youth', 'allegience', 'wrong', 'friends', 'suddenly', 'caught', 'up', 'tragic', 'dangerous', 'tension', 'filled', 'situation', 'danger', 'escalating', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'avoid', 'confront', 'nemesis', 'Epps', 'character', 'mounting', 'suspense', 'as', 'understated', 'way', 'real', 'urban', 'teenager', 'might', 'have', 'similar', 'situation', 'opinion', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'Epps.The', 'other', 'important', 'point', 'will', 'make', 'ultimately', 'Juice', 'anti-violence', 'film', 'When', 'character', 'shot', 'movie', 'STOPS', 'characters', 'are', 'shellshocked', 'movie', 'sure', 'highlight', 'emotional', 'effects', 'what', 'just', 'taken', 'place', 'reaction', 'violence', 'Hollywood', 'SHOULD', 'display', 'more', 'films', 'Violence', 'still', 'terrible', 'shocking', 'thing', 'Juice', 'MANY', 'other', 'films', 'sure', 'THAT', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'characters', 'having', 'make', 'excessive', 'speeches', 'know', 'lesson', 'hip', 'hop', 'generation', 'had', 'learn', 'actual', 'loss', 'Tupac', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'after.This', 'action', 'packed', 'suspenseful', 'hip', 'hop', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'Epps', 'late', 'Pac-', '90', 'classic']",Juice VHS

312735,A1UUVQS8X31RH1,630244327X,Kalie A. Gipson,"[4, 6]","The 1992 timeless 'hood movie ""Juice"" is a great drama movie which sort of turns into a thriller more towards the end. Directed by Ernest R. Dickerson, this movie just goes to show you what the longing for respect can do to a man and his friends. It has an excellent cast, with Omar Epps, Tupac Shakur, Khalil Kain, and Jermaine Hopkins playing the main gang. A few guest hip-hop stars appear as well. Juice also has an excellent soundtrack to go along with it. However, there are a few flaws in the movie, which I will point out later.""Q"", (Omar Epps) is an up and coming local DJ hoping to find a major breakthrough with a DJ competition taking place at a local party. He is part of the Wrecking Crew, which also consists of the unstable Bishop (Tupac), Rahim (Khalil Kain), and Steel (Jermaine Hopkins). After roaming the streets one afternoon, Q runs into a friend of his named Blizzard in a local bar, who decides to stick the place up, and asks Q if he wants some. Q says no, and he and his friends leave. Later, at Steel's house, they see a news story on the TV about Blizzard being killed by policeman after he wounded a few of them. Well, this story pisses Bishop off, badly. He wants the juice. He convinces his friends to rob a convenience store; however, it's on the same night as Q's tournament. The Wrecking Crew rob the store, but while they are in it, everything goes wrong when Bishop shoots the store clerk, when he did nothing. It all goes downhill from here. Now Q is the only one that can stop Bishop from the madness that has taken over him since the store shooting, while at the same time trying to protect himself from him.The only problem I have with the movie, really, is the climax and the ending. When the action is supposed to pick up, it really slows down. It's not dramatized or anything. I guess you can say that's a good thing but with movies it really ain't. The movie also ended weird. At the end it leaves you thinking ""is that it?"" It sure did that to me. Sometimes it seems like the movie was pointless, but the actors did a wonderful job at their roles, especially Tupac, that it picked up the slack.So, I'd say pick this up if you're interested in African American cinema or hood/gangster movies, like me.

Directed by Ernest Dickerson who did 'BulletProof' and a few episodes of 'The Wire', it is his gritty direction AND the unspoken tension and chemistry between the two leads, Omar Epps and 2pac, that puts this above average. It's nicely laced with an early 90s rap beat soundtrack that will make you nostalgic if you grew up in that era like I did.

So I always just tried to act like I know other black people the more I was around them.  But then I figured out that they would accept me just like I was trying to let me accept them.  But before that I always had GREAT respect for black people because of movies like this.  I just figured, I don't know any black people, but they sure do know how to make movies.So anyway this movie is set in a highschool for part of the movie, but most of the time it is this group of kids hanging out and making food for themselves, getting into trouble, helping there friend become a popular dj and so on.  What I didn't mention is that tupac is in this and is really believeable as a guy who is cool and is everybodies friend, but the wrong things happen with him and he just becomes a psycho.

312749,A1X910WAOVYV8M,630244327X,"Nathan ""Cawntry-fried Calypso Beach Bum""","[1, 2]","Man, oh, man. I can't believe is' been 10 years since this movie's initial release.  My uncle worked as the projectionist at a run-down movie theater on the southside of my town when this came out, and he snuck me in to see this film at the tender age'a 12.  It was one of the first real, unflinching glimpses I got of black youth in the early '90s, the peer pressure thas' felt, as well as the mistakes that can lead to often severe consequences.  It was at the time, and remains today, an incredibly effective movie.Anyways, enough'a the set-up, 'Juice' tells the story of four young hood cats, who spend they days ditching school, walkin' the streets of New York, goin' to the pool hall, hustlin' mixtapes for dough an' jus' laughing it up together the way friends do (this movie truly smacks'a the early '90s, but in the best possible way). They joke about girls with each other, who slept with who, get each other's back when someone has beef, and NEVER lose their trust in one another.  However it becomes apparent that the code of the neighborhood is that the person with the gun commands the most respect, and that mentality at too young an age is what turns everything wrong.  One of 'em gets their hands on a piece and decides the four of them should stick up the corner store, an' although there is some fear and doubt among them, ultimately they agree to go through with it.  There is sumpin' genuinely terrifying about watching these four kids, whom the film has allowed us to like and relate to like our closest homeboys, become armed robbers holding a gun to a poor, whimpering store clerk's head and demanding that he empty the cash register.  Without going into specifics, the robbery goes horribly wrong, and after a few days as the tension from local police looking for leads seems to die down, the friends quickly grow distant and, eventually, begin to suspect each other.  It's a pretty involving story as it unfolds, an' there are a few shocking scenes (though they aren't nearly as violent as I remember them being).  Omar Epps is pretty good in the lead role, the sensible and ambitious Q.  But, c'mon now.  It's obvious this is Tupac's movie.  I mean, face it, without him it would be nothing. Watching it now, it is even more interesting to see him so young and turning in such a powerful an' alarming debut. In the role of Bishop, the one who got the gun and who planned and initiated the robbery, he's riveting, delivering his lines with such guts and emotion, the most interesting character in the movie by far.  In the now-CLASSIC scene by the lockers in the school hallway, when he stares at Q with those intense eyes, and utters the now-famous line ""You're right. I am crazy. But you know what else? I don't give a f---"", you believe every word and the tension and terror in the air feels so real, it's chilling. As everything begins to unfold around him, his character Bishop becomes more and more merciless in his actions.If you're a die-hard fan of Tupac, then you prob'ly are already up on this.

312760,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,630244327X,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[3, 5]","Ernest Dickerson's Juice is a tragic tale of young black teenagers on a misguided quest for power and respect. In directing his fist full film after years of being Spike Lee's Cinematographer, Dickerson's camera tells a story very well. However the underdeveloped screenplay is missing small details. These small story points keep Juice from being the chilling human drama about the psychology of violence it wants to be and renders it into just another violent ""hood"" movie.Juice follows four African-American teenagers Q (Omar Epps) Steel (Jermaine Hopkins) Bishop (Tupac Shakur) and Raheim on a misguided quest for ""juice"" the respect and approval of their peers. All the kids come from working class homes in Harlem with the exception of Bishop who lives with his grandmother and mentally ill father. All of them have an opportunity to go to school, however they'd rather spend their days hanging out in the street fooling around playing video games at a neighborhood arcade. All three boys have no direction or goal to be anything with the exception of Q who wants to be a hip-hop DJ. Fooling around in the street leads to a beef with some Hispanic kids, a run in with a Korean store owner and running away from the White cops. All except for Steel get away from the police on the hooky patrol.Later in the day after Steel gets out of school, the boys do some shoplifting at a record store before Q walks into a stick-up in a local bar. The stick up man cuts Q in the action but he declines and leaves. Upon hearing about the offer Bishop eagerly rushes to join the stick up man. However, Raheim stops him. The boys instead go to Steel's house to hang out and watch gangster movies. After watching the 5:00 news and seeing the stick up guy's tragic death, Bishop starts showing signs of mental illness. Fed up with being run by cops, the Hispanic gang, and the Korean store owner he comes up with the idea to rob the Korean store. Bishop thinks the boys will get respect or ""juice"" in the neighborhood. Even though the others see flaws in Bishop's twisted plan they reluctantly they go along with the criminal scheme.Days go by. Q goes to an audition for a DJ battle. Raheim gets a revolver that Bishop eagerly takes possession of. The plans is to use the Q's DJ battle as an alibi then go rob the Korean grocer later in the evening. Things go all to plan until power mad Bishop starts to lose it, murdering the grocer after getting the money. While the other boys are terrified, Bishop is drunk from power. He betrays his friends and kills Raheim. Afraid of what Bishop will do to them, Steel and Q return to the DJ battle as if nothing has happened. After a police interrogation the boys go on with their lives. Bishop continues on in his homicidal spree looking for respect gunning down the Latin gang leader and later Steel. He's gunning for Q who buys his own gun. Almost killing a stranger, Q tosses it in the river. Bishop manipulates people into believing Q has killed everyone. With the police looking for him, Q has a showdown with the sociopath Bishop on a Harlem rooftop ends in Bishop's death. The movie ends with the Ironic revelation of Q getting the ""juice"" Bishop wanted. Q realizes that the cost of this ""juice"" is too high.As I stated earlier, Juice has all the elements of a great movie except the screenplay. The uneven uninspired script makes this flavorless Juice hard to swallow at times. The bland stock characters are all underdeveloped and the theme of the movie is unclear. Was this cautionary tale to prevent young black men from going down the path of crime? Was it a story about four kids on a tragic downward spiral in a misguided quest for respect? From what I watched it looked like these four young black males actually had an opportunity to get ""juice"" by going to school, the place they desperately wanted to avoid.Juice overcomes its weak screenplay with solid direction and cinematography from Ernest Dickerson and strong performances from its actors. Omar Epps gives a solid performance as Q. The late Tupac Shakur is chilling to watch as Bishop. Shakur adds dimension and depth to the one-dimensional Bishop showing us a young man descending further and further into mental illness. Samuel L. Jackson is solid in his small role as an arcade owner. In his few frames onscreen he feels just like a neighborhood guy who would own a rundown store like that back in the day. Look for FLEX (Flex Alexander) and Queen Latifah in cameo roles.Dickerson's camera captures the grittiness of early 1990's pre-gentrified Harlem very realistically. His visuals are great, filming on rooftops, inside abandoned buildings and in those nooks and crannies show us all those secret places teenagers without direction go to hang out when they cut hooky. Growing up in the city at that time I can tell you that the streets were as rough as depicted on film and the mood of the city was just as bleak. Back then New York was a place where over 2,100 murders happened, (many still unsolved until this day) schools failed students regularly and criminals made the law instead of politicians.Ernest Dickerson's Juice is tasteful, but it doesn't have enough flava to get on the Shawn James Five Star essential list. It's worth a rental at best. Pick it up along with New Jack City and Jason's Lyric.",3,Flat and flavaless Juice gets little props from me Good performance from Tupac.,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,5319,"['Ernest', 'Dickerson',

312761,ABE14SVILZLNY,630244327X,"SID ""Punk""","[15, 16]","Spike Lee cinematographer Ernest Dickerson (he shot Spike's first 6 films) makes a stylish, dark debut with the 1992 teen drama ""Juice"". Set in Harlem, the story chronicles the lives of 4 friends (including Tupac Shakur in a strong debut) trying to stay out of trouble. 'Q' is an aspiring DJ who holds fierce all his intentions to stay clean and away from danger. Steel is a chubby homeboy who wishes for nothing other than to have fun. Raheem, a teenage father, serves as the level-headed leader and peace keeper, and Bishop is a hot-headed firecracker eager to start war with the neighborhood gang (although these 4 don't behave like or consider themselves any sort of gang). Soon enough, trouble erupts when they rob the local liquor store in search of ""juice"" (power, respect) and a war erupts between Q and Bishop. Expectedly, Q would rather focus on an upcoming DJ contest but trash-talking Bishop has other plans.Dickerson's directorial manner is sleek and balanced, his camera and editing preferences are not as out there and in-your-face as Spike Lee, yet he knows exactly where to put the camera for each scene (the cross-cutting police interrogation sequence is most dynamic, better than that of ""The Usual Suspects"" and it pre-dates that film by 3 years as well). Dickerson also chooses to avoid the obvious route expected in these kinds of films and delivers a sad, somber ending. The film is stamped hard with the look, sound and feel of the early 90's (an excellent era of those ""urban"" films if you ask me), colorful clothing, an excellent hip-hop soundtrack and murky neon lighting. If this is up your alley, I also suggest Bill Duke's equally powerful ""Deep Cover"" (also from 1992). It's too bad that Dickerson's further efforts have not topped this engaging premiere.",4,Juice,1033603200,"10 3, 2002",2002,1786,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'cinematographer', 'Ernest', 'Dickerson', 'Spike', 'first', '6', 'films', 'stylish', 'dark', 'debut', '1992', 'teen', 'drama', 'Juice', 'Set', 'Harlem', 'story', 'lives', '4', 'friends', 'including', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'strong', 'debut', 'trying', 'stay', 'trouble', 'Q', 'aspiring', 'DJ', 'who', 'fierce', 'intentions', 'stay', 'clean', 'away', 'danger', 'Steel', 'chubby', 'homeboy', 'who', 'nothing', 'other', 'have', 'fun', 'Raheem', 'teenage', 'father', 'level-headed', 'leader', 'peace', 'keeper', 'Bishop', 'hot-headed', 'firecracker', 'eager', 'start', 'war', 'neighborhood', 'gang', '4', 'do', ""n't"", 'behave', 'consider', 'sort', 'gang', 'Soon', 'enough', 'trouble', 'erupts', 'when', 'rob', 'local', 'liquor', 'store', 'search', 'juice', 'power', 'respect', 'war', 'erupts', 'Q', 'Bishop', 'Expectedly', 'Q', 'would', 'rather', 'focus', 'upcoming', 'DJ', 'contest', 'trash-talking', 'Bishop', 'other', 'plans.Dickerson', 'directorial', 'manner', 'sleek', 'balanced', 'camera', 'editing', 'preferences', 'are', 'not', 'in-your-face', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'yet', 'exactly', 'where', 'put', 'camera', 'scene', 'cross-cutting', 'police', 'interrogation', 'sequence', 'most', 'dynamic', 'better', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'film', '3', 'years', 'as', 'well', 'Dickerson', 'also', 'avoid', 'obvious', 'route', 'expected', 'kinds', 'films', 'delivers', 'sad', 'somber', 'ending', 'film', 'stamped', 'hard', 'look', 'sound', 'feel', 'early', '90', 'excellent', 'era', 'urban', 'films', 'ask', 'colorful', 'clothing', 'excellent', 'hip-hop', 'soundtrack', 'murky', 'neon', 'lighting', 'up', 'alley', 'also', 'suggest', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'equally', 'powerful', 'Deep', 'Cover', 'also', '1992', 'too', 'bad', 'Dickerson', 'further', 'efforts', 'have', 'not', 'topped', 'engaging', 'premiere']",Juice VHS

Pac's performance is truly amazing, let's not forget, he was a  trained actor before he even got into hip hop, so this maybe shouldn't be  SO surprising, but for the fact that he hits it so well because, well, it's  him.  This is Omar Epps first movie (I think) as well, and he was  excellent, as was the guys who played Rahim and Steel.  The movie is great  and well shot, with excellent music throughout.  It's primarily the story  of a dj (Epps), really, just trying to get on, and his friends, and the  possibilities that can erupt in every man's struggle for respect.  Never  mind the critics, they seem to critique all black movies the same.  This  film is unique.  It's NOT that violent, especially in the day of Quentin  Tarantino or even Menace II Society. There's cameos by tons of rappers,  including Special Ed, EPMD, Latifah, Naughty by Nature, and others.  But  they're small and inconsequential roles for the most part (as they should  be). Don't watch this movie as any commentary on Harlem or on black youths  or any of that trash. Only racists try to generalize and make every movie  that a black person makes into an all-encompassing Statement of Reality.  It's overall a somewhat fun movie with a strong bite to it.  And it's got a  classic soundtrack, the first of the many rap soundtracks that would come  out with every movie after this. It's perfect, not too ambitious, doesn't  try too hard, isn't a real &quot;tear jerker&quot; though it can be  touching.  Overall, I'd say its a classic and ten years later, its still as  enjoyable.",5,Don't Go Bishop on Me!,960336000,"06 7, 2000",2000,1714,"['other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'getting', 'ridiculous', 'going', 'crazy', 'Tupac', 'best', 'character', 'ever', 'one', 'came', 'maybe', 'live', 'out', 'would', 'say', 'Pac', 'performance', 'truly', 'amazing', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'was', 'trained', 'actor', 'even', 'got', 'hip', 'hop', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'SO', 'surprising', 'fact', 'so', 'well', 'well', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'first', 'movie', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'guys', 'who', 'played', 'Rahim', 'Steel', 'movie', 'great', 'well', 'shot', 'excellent', 'music', 'primarily', 'story', 'dj', 'Epps', 'really', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'friends', 'possibilities', 'can', 'erupt', 'man', 'struggle', 'respect', 'mind', 'critics', 'seem', 'critique', 'black', 'movies', 'same', 'film', 'unique', 'NOT', 'violent', 'especially', 'day', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'even', 'Menace', 'II', 'Society', 'cameos', 'tons', 'rappers', 'including', 'Special', 'Ed', 'EPMD', 'Latifah', 'Naughty', 'Nature', 'others', ""'re"", 'small', 'inconsequential', 'roles', 'most', 'part', 'should', 'be', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'commentary', 'Harlem', 'black', 'youths', 'trash', 'Only', 'try', 'generalize', 'make', 'movie', 'black', 'person', 'all-encompassing', 'Statement', 'Reality', 'overall', 'somewhat', 'fun', 'movie', 'strong', 'bite', 'got', 'classic', 'soundtrack', 'first', 'many', 'rap', 'soundtracks', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'movie', 'perfect', 'not', 'too', 'ambitious', ""n't"", 'try', 'too', 'hard', ""n't"", 'real', 'quot', 'jerker', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'touching', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'classic', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'enjoyable']",Juice VHS

The star is Q(Omar Epps) who is a DJ and kicks it with his click called the Wreckin Crew.  His buddies are Raheem(Khalil Kain),Steele(Jermaine ""Big Hugg"" Hopkins), and Bishop(the late great 2pac Shakur).  The wreckin crew have fun and roam the streets looking for trouble and doing what most teenagers do.  Thry are surrounded by violence and chaotic occurences.  Q sees a friend Blizzard rob a diner(with EPMD in it)and later reveals he was shot by police, and the Wreckin Crew is harassed by a rival gang led by Radimez, a Latin thug who at one point threatens Bishop.  Q tries to get a spot on a DJ tournament unaware that his crew is planning to rob a convenience store.  As soon as they get the money, Bishop deliberately kills the clerk.  Two minutes later, Bishop kills Raheem.  Obviously, Bishop has LOST HIS MIND and it is up to Q, who is the only person who knows the truth, to defend himself against one of the most psychotic and brilliantly menacing villains in the entire history of cinema!  The most amazing scene is a part where 2pac is playing a video game in a bar and somehow breaks the arcade game.  The close-up of his eyes shows what kind person Bishop has turned into.

312765,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,630244327X,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[10, 13]","This is a engaging film about getting respect or ""juice"", albeit being the wrong way. ""Juice"" is about four buddies (Omar Epps, Tupac Shakur, Khalil Kain, Jermaine Hopkins) whose lives are torn apart when one of them get ahold of a gun, convinces his friends to join him in robbing a local bodega, and accidently kills the proprietor. That starts a horrific chain of events when certain people end up getting shot, including two of the four friends, all at the hand of Bishop (Tupac Shakur). Although I was not much of a fan of Tupac Shakur's music, I really loved him as an actor. His intensity in the role of Bishop in ""Juice"" was powerful. He was truly chilling, especially when he theatens Quincy aka ""Q"" (Omar Epps) in a school hallway and tells him, ""I AM crazy, but you know what? I don't give a $#@*!"" Then he proceeds to tell Q that he doesn't care about anyone, not even himself because he knows that he's no good. Whoa!!! In his mind, being a thug was his way of getting respect. Tupac, no doubt, would have gone on to become one of the greatest young dramatic actors of our time. It's such a tragedy that he was taken from us, but thank God we still have Pac to watch on video.Omar Epps, aside from being nice eye candy, gives a great performance as well as ""Q"", the kid who loves music and has big dreams of becoming a professional DJ. This is the way he wants to obtain respect, and rightfully so. ""Q"" is torn between being loyal to his friends and going to the police when Bishop's homicidial behavior gets dangerously out of control. Ultimately he decides that he has to be the one to stop Bishop, but at the same time he fears for his own life. Look for En Vogue member Cindy Herron in a role as Omar's older girlfriend. I really enjoyed this movie and after owning it for years on VHS, I'm finally getting the DVD. An excellent film to watch that teaches hard lessons about following along with a crowd.
