1123976,A75KD0YWU2AK7,B00104AYOC,Galen Halimar,"[10, 10]","Bob Cummings plays a lady's man photographer of beautiful women.  It is funny to see his male chauvinism 1950s' style and charm turned on for every model who comes into his studio -- all quite politically incorrect by today's standards.  But that is part of the humor.  Not for femininazis, liberals, and other stodgy types.  His grandpa, also played by Cummings, is a ""dirty ol' man"" who outdoes his son in womanizing, athletics, and endurance, even to swiping one of his son's own dates, a model who is done with starving herself and eager to eat anything fattening.  Nancy Kulp plays her usual role as a man-loving plain jane, who wants to be one of Bob's lovely beauties.  Secretary Shultzy, played by Ann Davis, tolerates Bob's numerous escapades with a degree of her own humor.Rosemary DeCamp plays Cumming's sister who lives with him and her grown son, who admires his uncle's success with beauty queens.

What was cutting edge comedy to us then (my wife and I watched it every week without fail) is just rather sad now and seldom elicits even a chuckle. Bob's over-the-top &#34;wolflike behavior&#34; isn't funny anymore. I'm unsure if this was a live audience show or dubbed laughter - sounds like the latter. Maybe it's just knowing the story of Bob Cummings life that dulls the comedy. I know it's not the comedy of the 50s that's no longer humorous because we still laugh every time we watch &#34;I Love Lucy&#34;.
