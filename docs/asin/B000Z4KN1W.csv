1121224,A3W3XY5HDT10AS,B000Z4KN1W,AH,"[8, 9]",I really like Sara Ivanhoe as a yoga instructor.  But these 20 minute routines are perfect for anybody that needs a quick yoga workout.  There are just enough routines to do a different one each day of the week (Mon-Fri that is) and get something different out of each one.,4,Love this DVD,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,273,"['really', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'yoga', 'instructor', '20', 'minute', 'routines', 'are', 'perfect', 'anybody', 'quick', 'yoga', 'workout', 'are', 'just', 'enough', 'routines', 'do', 'different', 'one', 'day', 'week', 'Mon-Fri', 'get', 'something', 'different', 'one']",N/A
1121225,A1DU8G4KYPXP09,B000Z4KN1W,Anne Omniuss,"[1, 1]","I've tried quite a few yoga videos including the Gaiam fitness DVDs.  I ran across Sara Ivanhoe on the series All Star Workouts on FitTV.  I immediately liked her because she uses normal language (saying things like ""give your leg a klunk forwards"") and her workouts are challenging enough for an intermediate (which is what I consider myself) but not too hard or complicated for a beginner.  I also have the Crunch yoga video she has out but I like this one because sometimes I am pressed for time and don't have a lot of time to work out but still want to do something.  They're not so challenging that I can't do the poses but not so easy that I don't feel like I've done nothing.  The On the Ball routine at the end is nice too because I had a fitness ball I wasn't using and it's a little longer workout for when I do have more tine.  It seemed easy enough while I was doing it but when I got done I felt it.  Personally I prefer Hatha/Vinyasa yoga to Kundalini yoga.  I've tried other videos and they're either too weird (chanting and other things I'm not comfortable with) or too challenging.  By far Sara Ivanhoe is my favorite yoga instructor.  Her videos are reasonbly priced too, which is nice.",5,Great beginners series.,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,1205,"[""'ve"", 'tried', 'quite', 'few', 'yoga', 'videos', 'including', 'Gaiam', 'fitness', 'DVDs', 'ran', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'series', 'All', 'Star', 'Workouts', 'FitTV', 'immediately', 'liked', 'normal', 'language', 'saying', 'things', 'give', 'leg', 'klunk', 'forwards', 'workouts', 'are', 'challenging', 'enough', 'intermediate', 'what', 'consider', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'complicated', 'beginner', 'also', 'have', 'Crunch', 'yoga', 'video', 'out', 'like', 'one', 'am', 'pressed', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'work', 'out', 'still', 'want', 'do', 'something', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'challenging', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'poses', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'done', 'nothing', 'Ball', 'routine', 'end', 'nice', 'too', 'had', 'fitness', 'ball', 'was', ""n't"", 'using', 'little', 'longer', 'workout', 'when', 'do', 'have', 'more', 'tine', 'seemed', 'easy', 'enough', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'got', 'done', 'felt', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'Hatha/Vinyasa', 'yoga', 'Kundalini', 'yoga', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'other', 'videos', ""'re"", 'too', 'weird', 'chanting', 'other', 'things', ""'m"", 'not', 'comfortable', 'too', 'challenging', 'far', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'videos', 'are', 'reasonbly', 'priced', 'too', 'nice']",N/A
1121226,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000Z4KN1W,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[2, 2]","This DVD set includes a total of six previously released yoga practices:  five 20-minute routines that formed instructor Sara Ivanhoe's ""Yoga Makeover"" series, originally released in 2004, and a bonus workout which is a bit longer,Yoga on the Ball.  I had previously reviewed all of the practices in the Yoga Makeover series, and so I have described each of them below.Weight LossThis practice is well-suited to those who prefer greater movement in postures rather than holding static poses for a longer length of time.  Sara begins with a chair pose vinyasa, adding arm movement and a forward bend and linking the series with breath; this is followed by a standing backbend combined with forward bend series. Next comes a vinyasa that is repeated throughout the workout: you move from plank to cobra to down dog, again combining the series with breath. From a 3-legged down dog position, Sara leads you into several series of standing poses: she begins with triangle/revolved triangle, moves on to warrior/side angle pose/revolved side angle in the next series, and finishes with crescent lunge/revolved crescent lunge. She completes the plank-cobra-down dog vinyasa between each series, eventually substituting upward dog for cobra. Finally, the practice ends in a seated position with head-to-knee pose and a brief hand mudra.Flat AbsHere Sara leads a challenging yoga practice aimed at strengthening your core abdominal muscles. She begins with standing side bends, adding a twist with a knee lift. Next comes some additional seated stretches with forward bends, twists, and spine rolls. Sara then moves to an all-fours position and leads some particularly challenging work moving from down dog to plank pose with one leg pulled in towards your chest. This is followed by some additional seated twists, including a twisting boat pose. Lying on your back, you'll then perform Pilates-like abs moves such as criss-cross, bicycle, and stretches with both bent and straight legs. You'll also perform a half sit up with the legs both bent and straight as well as side knee drops with the legs both bent and straight.  This is a tough, challenging practice which is likely to feel overwhelming for beginners.Sculpted Buns & ThighsThis nice lower body practice does a good job of thoroughly stretching the legs and opening the hips. Sara begins the practice in a standing position with several variations of chair pose; each variation is held for a few breaths. She then moves on to a triangle-warrior series for strengthening the leg muscles followed by a temple pose (a plie squat)-fan pose (wide-legged standing forward bend) combo which really stretches the legs, especially the hamstrings. The practice then moves on to the floor for camel pose, first performed with one hand only on each side then both hands. Finally, there is a lunge-lunge twist-pigeon-cobbler series that is perfect for opening the hips, and Sara finishes the practice with a simple seated yoga mudra.Power Beauty SweatHere, Sara does not rely on a traditional series of sun salutations to build heat in the body; rather, she adds movement to standing postures to intensify. She begins in a seated position with a simple side stretch and twist, then moves to kneeling for a kneeling side stretch (gate pose) and side plank. From here, the practice evolves to standing postures, including fan pose, a standing twist, and chair--each pose is repeated with movement and then a twist to both sides. Balance work comes in the form of eagle pose, and then there is a series consisting of dog pose, lunge, runner's stretch, and cow (or bull) performed to both sides. Dolphin pose further strengthens the arm muscles, and finally, there is a lying hamstring stretch. As with all the practices in this series, Ivanhoe ends with a mudra for detoxification here.  Overall, this is a nice, short yoga routine for focusing on standing postures and stretching the spine and hips.Total Body Tone with WeightsThis feels like a yoga practice with some toning work thrown in. Sara begins the practice with a few brief stretches in a standing position then picks up the weights (she is using 2-lbs.). She leads you through some standing shoulder work in mountain, tree, and chair poses and ends the segment in eagle pose, which I found a bit awkward with the weights. Next comes a warrior series where you hold your legs in the warrior position while working your arms with bicep curls and flies. Sara also does side angle pose, using the weights in sort of a one-arm row to an overhead lift, which I felt was a nice shoulder opener.  Sara then moves to the floor with triceps/core balance work performed from a hands and knees position. Next comes bridge pose while ""bench pressing"" the weights; the second set is performed on one leg, which was particularly challenging. A few additional stretches bring the practice to an end right at 20 minutes.Because Sara does not provide detailed instruction, I would not recommend any of these routines for those with no prior exposure to yoga.  However, many experienced beginners are likely to enjoy her calm, down-to-earth manner.",4,Compilation of previously released 20 Minute Yoga Makeover Series,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,5129,"['DVD',

1121227,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B000Z4KN1W,Colleen M. Schneider,"[16, 17]","My husband has seen me reap the benefits of practicing yoga over the years and though he is in fantastic shape he wanted to become more flexible and gain some of the relaxation and stretching benefits that yoga provides.Together we tried the core yoga and the power weight loss segments and I tried the balance of the dvds alone.  Each segment, with the exception of the stability ball work out is 20 minutes.  The ball workout is about 45 minutes long.  The dvd is geared to beginner/intermediate, but I felt that it was much more heavily balanced toward the beginner end, so for my husband this was perfect.  Not a lot of time commitment, good instruction and good stretching with prayer twists, down-dogs, etc.  I found that a few of the workouts just didn't give me enough though, as I was used to doing more, so if you are above a beginner level you may find yourself a little bored. The core workout was nice with controlled movements that are much like pilates, which would be excellent for those trying to work with a minimum of time and want maximum benefits in toning their abs.I enjoyed the 2nd disk the most, which covered power sweat, lower body power and on the ball yoga.  Power sweat was not as intense as it sounds though. The ball workout was an interesting twist and was a longer workout so I felt like that one was the one that I would do most often. I also liked the extra added core work you got as you had to keep yourself stable on the ball throughout the poses.Sara's instruction is excellent and the settings are beautiful and calming.  I also like how at the end of each workout she includes a mudra, which is a hand gesture used in yoga and meditation as a way to ""seal your practice"".Now that I have done this one, I would definitely like to try one of her intermediate workouts such as Yoga on the Edge.  She is a good instructor, with good form and cueing and keeps the workout positive and upbeat without being too chatty or over the top.If you would like a little taste of yoga in short segments (nice if you are short on time or want to supplement your regular workout) this would be a good beginner series.  You can also do like I did and add several segments together to make a longer workout covering several of the workouts.  That's the best part-putting together what works for you!Enjoy and be healthy!",4,a good sampler for the beginner....,1250294400,"08 15, 2009",2009,2342,"['husband', 'seen', 'reap', 'benefits', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'years', 'fantastic', 'shape', 'wanted', 'become', 'more', 'flexible', 'gain', 'relaxation', 'stretching', 'benefits', 'yoga', 'tried', 'core', 'yoga', 'power', 'weight', 'loss', 'segments', 'tried', 'balance', 'dvds', 'alone', 'segment', 'exception', 'stability', 'ball', 'work', 'out', '20', 'minutes', 'ball', 'workout', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'dvd', 'geared', 'beginner/intermediate', 'felt', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'heavily', 'balanced', 'beginner', 'end', 'husband', 'was', 'perfect', 'Not', 'lot', 'time', 'commitment', 'good', 'instruction', 'good', 'stretching', 'prayer', 'twists', 'down-dogs', 'etc', 'found', 'few', 'workouts', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'though', 'was', 'used', 'doing', 'more', 'are', 'beginner', 'level', 'may', 'find', 'little', 'bored', 'core', 'workout', 'was', 'nice', 'controlled', 'movements', 'are', 'much', 'pilates', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'trying', 'work', 'minimum', 'time', 'want', 'maximum', 'benefits', 'toning', 'abs.I', 'enjoyed', '2nd', 'disk', 'most', 'covered', 'power', 'sweat', 'lower', 'body', 'power', 'ball', 'yoga', 'Power', 'sweat', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'intense', 'ball', 'workout', 'was', 'interesting', 'twist', 'was', 'longer', 'so', 'felt', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'most', 'often', 'also', 'liked', 'extra', 'added', 'core', 'work', 'got', 'had', 'keep', 'stable', 'ball', 'poses.Sara', 'instruction', 'excellent', 'settings', 'are', 'beautiful', 'calming', 'also', 'how', 'end', 'workout', 'mudra', 'hand', 'gesture', 'used', 'yoga', 'meditation', 'way', 'seal', 'practice', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'would', 'definitely', 'try', 'one', 'intermediate', 'workouts', 'such', 'Yoga', 'Edge', 'good', 'instructor', 'good', 'form', 'cueing', 'workout', 'positive', 'upbeat', 'being', 'too', 'chatty', 'top.If', 'would', 'like', 'little', 'taste', 'yoga', 'short', 'segments', 'nice', 'are', 'short', 'time', 'want', 'supplement', 'regular', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'beginner', 'series', 'can', 'also', 'do', 'did', 'add', 'several', 'segments', 'together', 'make', 'longer', 'covering', 'several', 'workouts', 'best', 'part-putting', 'together', 'what', 'Enjoy', 'be', 'healthy']",N/A

But I don't always want a heart-pounding, hour-long routine.  How I use them is this.  Every morning, before going to work, I get up 20 minutes early and do one of these workouts.  They feel sooooo good to do.  They relax and stretch the body, while also working and toning the muscles.  Afterwards, I feel refreshed, alert, and ready to face the day.  And sometimes, if I've had a long day and want to stretch and relax a little, I'll do one of the workouts about an hour before going to sleep.  They are perfect for that.  And Sara is a sweetheart.

The whole series has been combined onto 2 discs, as opposed to 6, and is a real deal for the price can't be beat.Filmed on a gorgeous location in Hawaii, Sara takes you through a series of five different programmes that focus on different elements of fitness and target specific body parts: buns and thighs; flat abs; weight loss; toning with light weights; and power yoga.  Sara doesn't waste a minute of time in each compact but complete 20-minute practice.If you already own the previous gift set, as I do, I would recommend passing on this set.  If you are unfamiliar with Sara, or are looking for a nice way to begin a yoga practice without having to commit too much time in a day, this is a great place to start.  She has a pleasant and friendly personality but she's not a cheer leader.  She does, however, know her stuff and is as encouraging as a video yoga instructor can be.
