There have been very few of her works that my wife has been disappointed (such as Family Album).  As for the movies, Now and Forever is the one movie she absolutely does not want (along with Family Album).  I have watched it with her and have to agree with her.  The movie is way too intense for one of Danielle Steel's typical movies.  I am not sure if it is rated 'R', but it definitely should be.  The sex scene may not have any nudity, but the intenseness of the intercourse deserves the 'R' rating.  The acting throughout the movie is subpar at best.  Cheryl Ladd could not rescue this movie and should have never agreed to do it in the first place.  Collect the other Danielle Steel movies, but I would recommend passing on this one.",1,"Not sure if it is, but it should be rated R",1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,790,"['wife', 'very', 'devoted', 'fan', 'Danielle', 'Steele', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'few', 'works', 'wife', 'been', 'disappointed', 'such', 'Family', 'Album', 'movies', 'Now', 'Forever', 'one', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'not', 'want', 'Family', 'Album', 'have', 'watched', 'have', 'agree', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'intense', 'one', 'Danielle', 'Steel', 'typical', 'movies', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'rated', 'R', 'definitely', 'should', 'be', 'sex', 'scene', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'nudity', 'intenseness', 'intercourse', 'R', 'rating', 'acting', 'movie', 'subpar', 'best', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'could', 'not', 'rescue', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'agreed', 'do', 'first', 'place', 'Collect', 'other', 'Danielle', 'Steel', 'movies', 'would', 'recommend', 'passing', 'one']",N/A

I have nearly every book in her collection to date & nearly every film on DVD and/or VHS tape. And, I have to say this is the WORST in the film series.

Released in 1983, this film is rated PG-13 due to the subject matter (rape). I originally read the book when it first came out years ago and loved it! The film is very faithful to the novel. Cheryl Ladd is beautiful as ever and does a fantastic job portraying the 'wronged wife'- This is one of the darker stories by Danielle Steel, but does have the romantic story line that she is famous for.
