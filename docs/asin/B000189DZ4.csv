794682,A8LT66GHJAOQY,B000189DZ4,"destiny morna ""destiny21""","[9, 10]","This is the 3rd installment in the Skulls series- the skulls is an ultra-secret/prestigious and powerful college society.  They mold and support its male members, turning them into the most powerful leaders.  In this 3rd series Clare Kramer plays Taylor, an accomplished young woman whose father is a Skull and her brother committed suicide when he couldn't become a skull.Taylor sues the Skulls under gender discrimination and she is reluctantly accepted as its first female inductee.  Taylor wants her Dad's acceptance and she thinks entry into the Skulls is one way.  But not everyone, not even her Dad, wants Taylor in the Skulls.  The story is told in flashbacks...Clare Kramer is great in the lead role and reminds me of a young Ashley Judd.The movie's murder and mysteries are intruging, the viewers don't even find out who the victim is until well into the movie.  The identity of the final hero, betrayer and murderer came as a genuine surprise to me.  The Skulls III is actually, IMHO, the best of the series.The DVD offers the basic scene selection, plus bonus features-the trailer and an inside look at the making of the Skulls III with commentarys from the director and actors.",5,A skull movie above any other.....,1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,1190,"['3rd', 'installment', 'Skulls', 'series-', 'skulls', 'ultra-secret/prestigious', 'powerful', 'college', 'society', 'mold', 'support', 'male', 'members', 'turning', 'most', 'powerful', 'leaders', '3rd', 'series', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'Taylor', 'accomplished', 'young', 'woman', 'father', 'Skull', 'brother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'become', 'skull.Taylor', 'Skulls', 'gender', 'discrimination', 'reluctantly', 'accepted', 'first', 'female', 'inductee', 'Taylor', 'Dad', 'acceptance', 'entry', 'Skulls', 'one', 'way', 'not', 'everyone', 'not', 'even', 'Dad', 'Taylor', 'Skulls', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'great', 'lead', 'role', 'young', 'Ashley', 'Judd.The', 'movie', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'are', 'intruging', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'victim', 'well', 'movie', 'identity', 'final', 'hero', 'betrayer', 'murderer', 'came', 'genuine', 'surprise', 'Skulls', 'III', 'actually', 'IMHO', 'best', 'series.The', 'DVD', 'basic', 'scene', 'selection', 'bonus', 'features-the', 'trailer', 'inside', 'look', 'making', 'Skulls', 'III', 'commentarys', 'director', 'actors']",The Skulls III

That's modern feminism for you, I guess.Story wise, this movie isn't all that thrilling, and to say that it isn't predictable would would be rather deceptive.  There's just nothing about this movie--aside from Claire Kramer--really worth talking about, and there is no way that I'd ever recommend it.",2,Don't waste your time...,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,734,"[""'re"", 'guy', 'only', 'real', 'highpoint', 'movie', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'character', 'rather', 'self-righteous', 'annoying.The', 'thing', 'movie', 'fact', 'character', 'really', 'indignent', 'such', 'sexist', 'group', 'Skulls', 'allowed', 'opperate', 'campus', 'when', 'relent', 'allow', 'joing', 'problem', 'becoming', 'member', 'elitist', 'secret', 'society', 'modern', 'feminism', 'guess.Story', 'wise', 'movie', ""n't"", 'thrilling', 'say', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'would', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'deceptive', 'just', 'nothing', 'movie', 'aside', 'Claire', 'Kramer', 'really', 'worth', 'talking', 'way', ""'d"", 'ever', 'recommend']",The Skulls III
794684,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000189DZ4,Michael Butts,"[3, 3]","Clare Kramer's passionate and controlled performance elevates this SKULLS entry, possibly the most effective of the trilogy.  She plays the daughter of a former Skulls member who challenges their ""no female"" rule and manages to get herself inducted into the secret covert society.  As in the other two SKULLS, a murder occurs with the requisite coverup and it's up to Kramer to expose the organization.  The movie has some tense moments and avoids some tired cliches of the other two.  Bryce Johnson is the sleazy Roger, and his involvement in the scam is surprisingly resolved.  Vets Barry Bostwick and Len Cariou round out the cast and while everything's fairly predictable, a few twists at the end are refreshing.",3,NUMB SKULLS,1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,716,"['Clare', 'Kramer', 'passionate', 'controlled', 'performance', 'elevates', 'SKULLS', 'entry', 'possibly', 'most', 'effective', 'trilogy', 'daughter', 'former', 'Skulls', 'member', 'who', 'female', 'rule', 'manages', 'get', 'inducted', 'secret', 'covert', 'society', 'other', 'two', 'SKULLS', 'murder', 'requisite', 'coverup', 'up', 'Kramer', 'expose', 'organization', 'movie', 'tense', 'moments', 'avoids', 'tired', 'cliches', 'other', 'two', 'Bryce', 'Johnson', 'sleazy', 'Roger', 'involvement', 'scam', 'surprisingly', 'resolved', 'Vets', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'Len', 'Cariou', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'everything', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'few', 'twists', 'end', 'are', 'refreshing']",The Skulls III
794685,A1Q1V4F9610DB5,B000189DZ4,Music Lover in Omaha,"[0, 0]","I bought this one only because I saw gravedancers and I thought Clare Kramer was good in that.  I did not see the second Skulls movie, but I thought the first one was okay. (not great - just okay).  This was a decent movie if you want to kill a couple hours.  It is pretty predictable and the resolution is obvious early on, but it is fairly entertaining.  Clare (who is in virtually the entire movie) does a good job carrying the film, although for all her character's struggles with conscience and the tragedies that have led her to this point, I thought she was kind of shallow when she got what she wanted.  She was also a bit unbelievable as the most competent of the pledges trying to make it into the Skulls. She was the best man in the group.  I don't see those guys as the future movers and shakers of America.  Barry Bostwick was solid and the rest of the cast did a decent job.  I would recommend this movie based on an interesting (if not completely original) concept, sincere acting, and a lack of bad language.  I've never been one who thought that foul language just for the sake of foul language added anything to a film.  It's nice when you find a film that doesn't abuse it.",3,Clare Kramer lifts this one,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,1192,"['bought', 'one', 'only', 'saw', 'gravedancers', 'thought', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'was', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'second', 'Skulls', 'movie', 'thought', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'just', 'okay', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'want', 'kill', 'couple', 'hours', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'resolution', 'obvious', 'early', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'Clare', 'who', 'virtually', 'entire', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'carrying', 'film', 'character', 'struggles', 'conscience', 'tragedies', 'have', 'led', 'point', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'shallow', 'when', 'got', 'what', 'wanted', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'most', 'competent', 'pledges', 'trying', 'make', 'Skulls', 'was', 'best', 'man', 'group', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'guys', 'future', 'movers', 'shakers', 'America', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'was', 'solid', 'rest', 'cast', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'based', 'interesting', 'not', 'completely', 'original', 'concept', 'sincere', 'acting', 'lack', 'bad', 'language', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'one', 'who', 'thought', 'foul', 'language', 'just', 'sake', 'foul', 'language', 'added', 'anything', 'film', 'nice', 'when', 'find', 'film', ""n't"", 'abuse']",The Skulls III

794687,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000189DZ4,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","Claire Kramer (TV's 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and one of the cheerleaders in 'Bring it On') takes the lead of this new sequel to 'The Skulls.'  The story about the secret society is not much different this time though, except one thing; instead of a male, a female student delves into the underground world ruled by Barry Bostwick (TV's 'Spin City').In fact, little difference can be found, compared with the first Skull film featuring Joshua Jackson, so it's more like a retread of the original rather than a sequel.  You get a curious, and very ambitious female student in college, who because of her personal reasons is willing to be a member of the secret society.  She takes no for answer, as you see, and uses her knowledge about laws to have the authority bend the rules.And ... if you think there's more to it, you're utterly mistaken.  The rest of the film goes on the beaten road, with the 'trails,' 'branding' etc., and finally you see a bloody crime committed.  Though Claire Kramer is surprisingly good, the film remains so predictable and unexciting.The first film had a curiosity value, when you see the thinly-disguised references to Yale, and the real-life Skull and Bones society, even though the film seems to have taken much liberty with the facts (whatever they may be).  Now it's just another tired thriller with cliched items.  If you have seen the first one, just skip this.",2,"Oh, Don't Bother ...
