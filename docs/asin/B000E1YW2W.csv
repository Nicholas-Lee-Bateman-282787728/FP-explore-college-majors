966626,A33GNK2H4F1EC0,B000E1YW2W,City Of Rocks,"[2, 3]","Pros: Creative storyline with great themes; generally clean entertainmentCons: Script and score didn't add to the credibilityThe Bottom Line: It's a clean drama with enjoyable themes, but suffers in the credibility department.Note: There is more than one movie with this title. This refers to the one by Echo Bridge Entertainment, starring Melissa Gilbert, Lindsay Wagner, and Brian Wimmer. Hallmark Entertainment.Price: Five dollars or lessFamily Approval Certifications: Dove Seal87 minutes; not ratedThis is a story about an attorney who finds an old picture of her recently deceased father-with a bride who isn't her mother. The attorney never knew about this previous wife, and so she heads out to find out about what could be the other half of her family. As far as the plot goes, I won't spoil it for you beyond this.The themes are healthy and the content is generally clean; one reference to going on vacation with an opposite-sex partner to whom the character is not married. So if you're looking for a family movie, this is certainly one of the better ones out there from that standpoint. Besides, who doesn't enjoy a story about people crossing into a very different lifestyle to save the dream of a family they didn't know they had?The only things I struggled with are:1. The script. At first I thought some of the acting wasn't up to par, but then I paid careful attention to the lines and realized it's probably hard to act unnatural conversation. It seemed too forced; too much like the dialogue was meant to demonstrate the story instead of just letting the characters say what they would under the given circumstances. It would have been far more credible of they had simply let the plot demonstrate the story and let the characters be themselves in those incidents. Although, I must say that Brian Wimmer did an amazing job of swimming through the rather unnatural dialogue and somehow managing to make it look good. And some parts were better than others, too.An example of unnatural dialogue: the previous bride had a daughter, who keeps referring to her own mother as ""Maggie May."" I don't know many people who call their mothers by their first names. We know her as Maggie May, of course, but her daughter would probably say, ""My mother.""2. The score. The style of the score just didn't seem to match the style of the film, and I found it distracting. The menu theme is fine, and the moods were accurate, but the dissonant tones and heavy reliance on wind instruments sounded (rather ironically) somewhat lighthearted for a drama. We're talking about a woman who just lost her father. She just found out a little fact he failed to mention: he had a wife not her mother. This is a heavy situation and the music failed to reflect that. Probably because it was for the most part a family film, but necessary levity breaks can come through sprinklings of humor in the plot, not a mismatched score. And you would never think this woman was grieving, either. It just didn't come into the story at all, which robbed the whole thing of credibility.This is not to say the film as a whole wasn't enjoyable. It's nice to see a woman discovering likenesses between her father and herself as she crosses into a lifestyle so alien to her own for the sake of kin. And the scenery was nice. A few cat-in-the-window shots would have been nice-maybe use the horses. Let us see them run; see their majestic beauty-something that would make us understand why the first wife made it her dream to save these wild, DNA-skewing horses, and why the next generation felt this was a dream worth saving. I needed to relate to the characters more.But it is enjoyable to watch for an evening, and you generally don't have to worry about who is watching. It isn't for children because they wouldn't be able to relate without a certain amount of life experience, but it's an entertainment factor, not a suitability issue. Except, now that I think about it, one issue: a coworker of the attorney comments he is spending the weekend out of town with a woman he just met. I wasn't fond of that part but it was a passing comment. I remember nothing else, and it's great to see Lindsay Wagner and Melissa Gilbert back in action.I would recommend this to a friend.Viewing Format: DVDSuitability For Children: Suitable for Children Age 13 and Older",4,"Clean, great themes, script issues",1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,4331,"['Pros', 'Creative', 'storyline', 'great', 'themes', 'generally', 'clean', 'entertainmentCons', 'Script', 'score', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'credibilityThe', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'clean', 'drama', 'enjoyable', 'themes', 'suffers', 'credibility', 'department.Note', 'more', 'one', 'movie', 'title', 'one', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'Entertainment', 'starring', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'Brian', 'Wimmer', 'Hallmark', 'Entertainment.Price', 'Five', 'dollars', 'lessFamily', 'Approval', 'Certifications', 'Dove', 'Seal87', 'minutes', 'not', 'ratedThis', 'story', 'attorney', 'who', 'old', 'picture', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father-with', 'bride', 'who', ""n't"", 'mother', 'attorney', 'never', 'knew', 'previous', 'wife', 'so', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'other', 'half', 'family', 'As', 'far', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'this.The', 'themes', 'are', 'healthy', 'content', 'generally', 'clean', 'one', 'reference', 'going', 'vacation', 'opposite-sex', 'partner', 'whom', 'character', 'not', 'married', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'family', 'movie', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'there', 'standpoint', 'Besides', 'who', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'story', 'people', 'crossing', 'very', 'different', 'lifestyle', 'save', 'dream', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'only', 'things', 'struggled', 'are:1', 'script', 'first', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'then', 'paid', 'careful', 'attention', 'lines', 'realized', 'probably', 'hard', 'act', 'unnatural', 'conversation', 'seemed', 'too', 'forced', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'was', 'meant', 'demonstrate', 'story', 'instead', 'just', 'letting', 'characters', 'say', 'what', 'would', 'given', 'circumstances', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'credible', 'had', 'simply', 'let', 'plot', 'demonstrate', 'story', 'let', 'characters', 'be', 'incidents', 'must', 'say', 'Brian', 'Wimmer', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'swimming', 'rather', 'unnatural', 'dialogue', 'somehow', 'managing', 'make', 'look', 'good', 'parts', 'were', 'better', 'others', 'too.An', 'example', 'unnatural', 'dialogue', 'previous', 'bride', 'had', 'daughter', 'who', 'referring', 'own', 'mother', 'Maggie', 'May', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'call', 'mothers', 'first', 'names', 'know', 'Maggie', 'May', 'course', 'daughter', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'mother.', '2', 'score', 'style', 'score', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'match', 'style', 'film', 'found', 'distracting', 'menu', 'theme', 'fine', 'moods', 'were', 'accurate', 'dissonant', 'tones', 'heavy', 'reliance', 'wind', 'instruments', 'sounded', 'rather', 'ironically', 'somewhat', 'lighthearted', 'drama', ""'re"", 'talking', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'father', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'little', 'fact', 'failed', 'mention', 'had', 'wife', 'not', 'mother', 'heavy', 'situation', 'music', 'failed', 'reflect', 'Probably', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'family', 'film', 'necessary', 'levity', 'breaks', 'can', 'come', 'sprinklings', 'humor', 'plot', 'not', 'mismatched', 'score', 'would', 'never', 'think', 'woman', 'was', 'grieving', 'either', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'story', 'robbed', 'whole', 'thing', 'credibility.This', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'whole', 'was', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'nice', 'see', 'woman', 'discovering', 'likenesses', 'father', 'lifestyle', 'so', 'alien', 'own', 'sake', 'kin', 'scenery', 'was', 'nice', 'few', 'cat-in-the-window', 'shots', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice-maybe', 'horses', 'Let', 'see', 'run', 'see', 'majestic', 'beauty-something', 'would', 'make', 'understand', 'why', 'first', 'wife', 'made', 'dream', 'save', 'wild', 'DNA-skewing', 'horses', 'why', 'next', 'generation', 'felt', 'was', 'dream', 'worth', 'saving', 'needed', 'relate', 'characters', 'more.But', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'evening', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'who', 'watching', ""n't"", 'children', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'certain', 'amount', 'life', 'experience', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'not', 'suitability', 'issue', 'now', 'think', 'one', 'issue', 'coworker', 'attorney', 'comments', 'spending', 'weekend', 'town', 'woman', 'just', 'met', 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'part', 'was', 'passing', 'comment', 'remember', 'nothing', 'else', 'great', 'see', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'back', 'action.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'friend.Viewing', 'Format', 'DVDSuitability', 'Children', 'Suitable', 'Children', 'Age', '13', 'Older']",N/A

966631,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B000E1YW2W,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[2, 2]","I purchased this film on a whim, having enjoyed other Hallmark movies and of course Melissa Gilbert and Lindsay Wagner; and since this item included the bonus CD, ""Gentle Country Moments,"" I went with it instead of the regular DVD; although if I had not assumed that ""Thicker Than Water""/ ""Ordinary Miracles"" was a double sided disc like most double features, I probably would have gone with that version.  (I do wish that Hallmark would provide ""director's cut"" versions on their DVDs, to help flush out their films edited for comercials).The story is fairly straight forward, although I would have liked to have seen some added depth to some of the issues/plot lines.  For example, the film never explains why re-establishing a wild horse herd was so important to Maggie Mae Jarret, the mother of Jess Jarrett (played by Lindsay Wagner), and who was married to Charles Everett Trevors before he married the mother of Natalie Jones (played by Melissa Gilbert).  Nor does the film address the implications of such a herd in the state of California.  Furthermore, I don't understand how Maggie Mae, who ""divorced"" Charles and then moved to California (from New Mexico where the couple were married) to be close to him, could have leased a ranch in California.  While ""Thicker Than Water"" seems to evoke the importance of ""blood,"" or biological, relationships there are three seemingly very important relationships that are non-familial and not well examined: 1) Jess's relationship with the young girl living with her, Lulu Nichols (nicely played by relative new comer, Lindy Newton); 2) Jesse's relationship with the veterinarian Sam Nelson (weakly portrayed by Brian Wimmer), who is referred to as Jesse's ""brother"" and someone Maggie Mae helped; and 3) Natalie Jones' relationship with Larry Gorman (played by Robert Mailhouse), her attorney associate and friend.  Another ""sticky"" issue that is left undeveloped, for me, is that Natalie Jones' father's last name is Travers, not ""Jones;"" although she ""reverts"" to ""Travers"" when she introduces herself, to Jesse and others, as Natalie Travers.  Why?  But then, this failure to fully develop the charters is a shortness of the film, which is only 87 minutes.  Less problematic for me, is the poor editing of the film: scenes do not connect well for me, and the beginning is totally out of place (not to mention poorly shot--you can see a major city in the background at one point).The story is about Natalie finding out that her father had been married before--something the ""house keeper"" (?), Abygail Jordan (played by actress Nan Martin) seems to already know.  Natalie, a big time attorney, uses her resources to locate where Maggie Mae Jarrett may be located, and heads off to find her.  She ends up at the cemetery where Jesse Jarrett--who it turns out to be Maggie's daughter--happens to be as well.  Natalie claims to be doing a story about Maggie, but is found out by Lulu.  Then Jesse, for some reason takes Natalie to see the wild horses that are Maggie's ""legacy.""  Natalie then attempts to become involved with Jesse, in an attempt ""prove"" that Jesse is her ""half-sister.""  Her reasoning is that Jesse is entitled to a share of what Natalie has just inherited from her father's estate.  In the process, Natalie ""develops"" relationships with Sam, Lulu, and Jesse, whom Natalie comes to see as a sister, regardless of the ""legal"" or genetic connection.  Relationships become more important--""thicker than water.""  Almost as a coda, Natalie and Sam ""end up together.""All in all, ""Thicker Than Water"" is a lot of fun to watch, despite the above mentioned misgivings about the film, and would highly recommend it as a fun evening of entertainment.  The musical CD has some very nice guitar music, although I don't know that I'd call it ""gentle.""
