Then you realize that you, being a kid at the time could enjoy them as they were.Then there is ""Topper"" the TV show. It was one big smoking commercial.Well I sort of counted on this happening with ""My Little Margie"" (Gale Storm.) Boy was I surprised. The plots are complex for the small period of time they have to execute in. Hokey or not they had me laughing. And Price per pound, you get so many episodes. I am working my way through them all and find some how they are comforting like an old friend. It is fun t spot the different actors in movies and say ""I saw that person on""`My Little Margie.'""After viewing, I will put them on the shelf and they look good as a collection.",5,If you are reading this you are already hooked,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,771,"['Usually', 'look', 'back', 'old', 'programs', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'think', 'how', 'hokey', 'were', 'Then', 'realize', 'being', 'kid', 'time', 'could', 'enjoy', 'were.Then', 'Topper', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'big', 'smoking', 'commercial.Well', 'sort', 'counted', 'happening', 'Little', 'Margie', 'Gale', 'Storm', 'Boy', 'was', 'surprised', 'plots', 'are', 'complex', 'small', 'period', 'time', 'have', 'execute', 'Hokey', 'not', 'had', 'laughing', 'Price', 'pound', 'get', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'am', 'working', 'way', 'find', 'how', 'are', 'comforting', 'old', 'friend', 'fun', 't', 'spot', 'different', 'actors', 'movies', 'say', 'saw', 'person', 'Little', 'Margie', 'viewing', 'will', 'put', 'shelf', 'look', 'good', 'collection']",N/A

There are two 12-episode collections available from VCI here, and this review will be offered to cover both. Gale Storm delivers a sparkling performance as Margie Albright, a twentyish single gal sharing posh NY digs with her attractive widower father, Vern, played nicely by former silent-screen idol Charles Farrell. Hillary Brooke, a talented actress who dressed up many a B film in the 1940s has an occaisional role as Vern's sometime girl friend, Roberta Townsend. Willie Best plays the elevator operator in the Albright's apartment building, and he is a somewhat reluctant co-conspiritor in some of Margie's ""schemes"". Gertrude Hoffman as ditzy old Mrs. Odetts nearly steals every show she is featured in. If you enjoy nostalgic comedy shows which are well produced, check this out.

563269,A10RGJ0NVVGODV,B000051S3E,Ron Wise,"[38, 38]","""I Love Lucy"" is probably THE greatest of the 1950's TV sitcoms, but ""My Little Margie"" runs a very close second. Gale Storm as Margie Albright and her father Vern played by Charles Farrell and Mr. Honeywell played by the Clarence Kolb are all superb. These are seasoned actors who take their roles seriously. In other words, they are there to make you laugh and they do an excellent job of doing it.This collection of 12 episodes is well worth the price. The print and sound quality are wonderful for the most part. I just hope this company comes out with future collections.

I picked up on this when the series was being shown first run.  (I am a real antique.)  Lucy in Peanuts once asked Linus if he was ever aware of his tongue.

Once aware of it, you can never listen to her talk again without being driven to distraction.Having established that, where the hell is Topper (the series) in which we learn that Alexander Waverly was a banker before becomming head of U.N.C.L.E.?  Also, is anybody else cognizant of the fact that Stephen Sondheim wrote some of Topper's scripts?  And where is The Man from U.N.C.L.E.???
