1513213,A2XKQHB8VCUCJK,B00687XNVM,B. Adducchio,"[0, 0]","""Tiny Furniture"" is an independent film, starring Lena Dunham of ""Girls"" fame, before her time on Girls. It's about a young New York woman returning home from college to try and start her new life. She struggles to make friends, meet quality men, and keep the peace with her younger sister and successful artist mother. Dunham's real-life sister and mother play those roles in the film, and I have to say, for a group of amateur actors, everyone does a really great job.The film is slow-paced but there are some genuinely funny moments, particularly scenes with Dunham's male friend who stays at the apartment for an extended period of time.I've always been a fan of Lena Dunham. This movie works on some levels, particularly as a showcase for her dry humor, but the plot and storyline in general don't work as a whole that well. Still, it's an impressive debut for her and it's easy to see why HBO wanted to work with her.",3,Lena Dunham offbeat comedy,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,923,"['Tiny', 'Furniture', 'independent', 'film', 'starring', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'Girls', 'fame', 'time', 'Girls', 'young', 'New', 'York', 'woman', 'returning', 'home', 'college', 'try', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'make', 'friends', 'meet', 'quality', 'men', 'keep', 'peace', 'younger', 'sister', 'successful', 'artist', 'mother', 'Dunham', 'real-life', 'sister', 'mother', 'play', 'roles', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'group', 'amateur', 'actors', 'everyone', 'really', 'great', 'job.The', 'film', 'slow-paced', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'Dunham', 'male', 'friend', 'who', 'apartment', 'extended', 'period', 'time.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'movie', 'levels', 'particularly', 'showcase', 'dry', 'humor', 'plot', 'storyline', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'whole', 'well', 'Still', 'impressive', 'debut', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'HBO', 'wanted', 'work']",Tiny Furniture
1513214,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00687XNVM,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Tiny Furniture is probably intended for any young early 20-year old woman that returns home from college and struggles to figure out exactly what to do their lives, so people of this age group tend to become friends with people they have very little in common with just to fit in and experiment (with significantly different personalities in this case), they argue with their mother and sister over meaningless things only to end up realizing that they're too old to fall victim to immaturity since they have loved ones to fall back on, they hook up with guys that are drastically different (and perhaps more sexually active) and well, returning home from college for a young woman and having to live with their family involves a period of getting reacquainted with things.Lena Dunham is the actress that stars in this indie drama, but the truth is the comedy is either really subtle or only appears briefly before switching into a more serious tone.  So overall it's definitely more of a drama.  The several arguments Lena's character gets into with her family definitely aren't intended to be hilarious.While the first 20 minutes are really dry and almost boring enough to consider switching it over, Tiny Furniture ends up being not that bad of a film in the long run.  Once Lena gets out and experiences friendships and relationships with women and men and learns what kind of people they are, the storyline improves.  However I never felt Lena's job as a waitress (if I remember) was given enough time.  In fact make that very little time overall.  Obviously she's unhappy working there and I felt the story should have focused more on her unhappiness of having to be there.I feel the final 15 minutes -though nothing extraordinary and perhaps disappointing for those expecting a more fitting conclusion- are the best segments.  A little graphic with the sexual content perhaps (both the act itself and the conversation that comes afterwards- most of us aren't *that* comfortable!)

None of the characters are very sympathetic, a few of them are repulsive. I started it in the spirit of ""seeing what the kids are up to these days"" - I read Slate, and have noticed how enraptured the editorial staff over there is with Dunham's t.v. series Girls, how they seem to think it characterizes the up and coming generation - and shut it off in a mix of corrupt sympathy, shadenfreude and mild distaste.I think Lena Dunham's character (both in the sense of her role in this film, as her personality in life) may be revealed in a line she has her alter ego here ""Aura"" write in her journal: ""Here's a list of things I want: a violin bow, a lover - and please make it work to make me happy, my luck in love is always so poor - to start getting my art together, to weigh 128 to 125 and be happy, a toe operation, a dulcimer, a black beret, sunglasses, a new journal, floor sanded, to learn to use a dark room, and to make little movies - ones that have me in them..""  This solipsism may come as close to prayer as Lena Dunham gets, on the evidence of this film..Jane Austen she is not. It's still in parts somehow amusing, but in a vulgar exhibitionistic, occasionally sneering way that lightly clouds the conscience after sitting through an hour and a half of it.I stopped watching after ""Aura/Lena"" gets awkwardly ""f*'d in a (construction) pipe"" by the druggy creep misogynist chef that she is crushing on from the job she quit as a ""day hostess"" at a Manhattan bar-restaurant after only one week. Hmm. Really, now. Is this actually what hip urbanite 20 somethings are up to these days?

1513216,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,B00687XNVM,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[0, 0]","Tiny Furniture is a difficult film to rate. It follows the life of a fairly uninteresting and unattractive girl after she graduates from college. She is a bit of an entitled brat, yet she is mostly just a sweet, totally un-intimidating young lady struggling to find out who she is. Most of the characters, if not all of them, are on the unlikeable side, and there is no real character development at all from Aura. So what keeps Tiny Furniture from being an intolerable piece of self-indulgent garbage? It's Lena Dunham's excellent sense of realism that makes these character's and their actions fascinating. The performances and flawed nature of all of the actors are so believable, and the fact that Tiny Furniture is essentially a staged and scripted Lena Dunham documentary allows the audience a kind of voyeuristic satisfaction in watching this mixed-up girl so intimately and awkwardly. This could be seen as a lack of creativity on Lena's behalf, but it's engaging and that's all that really matters. That being said, it is very easy to understand those who condemn the film as being 100 minutes of boring first-world problems. It really boils down to whether or not the viewer makes a connection with the material. If there's a spark, it could turn into a fire, but if the first 20 minutes are unrewarding, the last 80 are likely not to be either. On the technical side, the film is flawless. Characterized by a stationary, wide-lensed camera, it is shot with the kind of precision that Wes Anderson displayed in his debut, Bottle Rocket. The photography is beautiful, however, it would be nice for at least a little variation, maybe a tracking shot here or there. The production design is nice (although the majority of the film was shot in her mother's pre-designed loft), and the music is suitably 'indie', not too exciting. Following in the college-educated, OCD-ridden footsteps of Woody Allen and his disciples, Lena Dunham isn't very original, and on the surface, she doesn't seem to have much going for her, but her charm lies in both the down-to-earth, not too quirky writing and the work of her talented cast.",4,You Get It Or You Don't,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,2127,"['Tiny', 'Furniture', 'difficult', 'film', 'rate', 'life', 'fairly', 'uninteresting', 'unattractive', 'girl', 'college', 'bit', 'entitled', 'brat', 'mostly', 'just', 'sweet', 'totally', 'un-intimidating', 'young', 'lady', 'struggling', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Most', 'characters', 'not', 'are', 'unlikeable', 'side', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'Aura', 'what', 'Tiny', 'Furniture', 'being', 'intolerable', 'piece', 'self-indulgent', 'garbage', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'excellent', 'sense', 'realism', 'character', 'actions', 'fascinating', 'performances', 'flawed', 'nature', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'believable', 'fact', 'Tiny', 'Furniture', 'essentially', 'staged', 'scripted', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'documentary', 'audience', 'kind', 'voyeuristic', 'satisfaction', 'watching', 'mixed-up', 'girl', 'so', 'intimately', 'awkwardly', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'lack', 'creativity', 'Lena', 'behalf', 'engaging', 'really', 'matters', 'being', 'said', 'very', 'easy', 'understand', 'who', 'condemn', 'film', 'being', '100', 'minutes', 'boring', 'first-world', 'problems', 'really', 'down', 'not', 'viewer', 'connection', 'material', 'spark', 'could', 'turn', 'fire', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'unrewarding', 'last', '80', 'are', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'either', 'technical', 'side', 'film', 'flawless', 'Characterized', 'stationary', 'wide-lensed', 'camera', 'shot', 'kind', 'precision', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'displayed', 'debut', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'however', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'least', 'little', 'variation', 'maybe', 'tracking', 'shot', 'here', 'there', 'production', 'design', 'nice', 'majority', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mother', 'pre-designed', 'loft', 'music', 'suitably', ""'indie"", 'not', 'too', 'exciting', 'Following', 'college-educated', 'OCD-ridden', 'footsteps', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'disciples', 'Lena', 'Dunham', ""n't"", 'very', 'original', 'surface', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'going', 'charm', 'down-to-earth', 'not', 'too', 'quirky', 'writing', 'work', 'talented', 'cast']",Tiny Furniture

The director and lead actress is a young woman who just got out of film school and on the merit of this film she got wide release by a successful director and also a deal with hbo to produce a series. I am sad to say that either there must be a generation gap because I found this comedy to be extremely boring and not to my taste. The movie is in the category of mumblecore and if you&#8217;re not familiar with the term its because it is a fairly new invention that was coined in 2003 for a category of films that are hard to describe but is in the vain of seinfeldesque comedy placed in odd situations but for those that are in it seem quite the norm. They are usually low budget and mostly based on dialogue but contains either very little plot or simple plot. They seem to speak more about the current generation: their aimlessness and futility , like 90s films with parker posey or wynona rider did for me. Anyway the humor in this movie is to be found in the main characer who moves home from college, mom is famous photographer of tiny furniture, falls for a guy who is you tube famous for spouting nietche philosophy while riding a toy pony, she does you tube video of her fat self in college fountain, invites guy to live in moms house who overstays welcome, hangs out with high school friend who has a fake british accent from being in england for one year.

Things have never been like that, except for few people/times/places, and the protagonist here is finding it out as the film progresses.  In fact, she does it so fast that you'd think people like her come into the 'real' world as 2-dimensional entities, only latter to add depth as experience carves them with no curriculum, to no end other than some old cliche about life.  For some reason, you may find yourself rooting for Aura/Lena, and this comes to also show her skill at progressively embodying a character.Indeed, she gets in some dead-end, otherwise predictable from the perspective of the viewer, then she comes out as if nothing happened, in a series, until the final two big scenes in the film when she comes full circle, or does she?As already noted by others, this is a hattrick of sorts, for Lena is the protagonist, scriptwriter, and director of this film.  This is no small thing, for the story flows after the first minutes, filming has even some gems, and the honesty with which she treats her character is exemplar.  I know, in the Facebook/YouTube/MySpace generation Lena's achievement may not count for much, but I think there is much more here, something that coexists alright even with all the frivolity/entitlement/honesty of the above mentioned generation, and that's the drive to know and connect.____________________An extra-word about the type of honesty on display here.  Often, it's just a verbose game the children of earlier generations used to do it when playing unsupervised, except that this time is about getting laid.

The film generated some good buzz at Sundance (or SXSW), and Lena Dunham has a show on HBO now.  After seeing this film, Criterion should rethink their criteria after this film because this film doesn't belong in the same catalog as masterworks of Fellini, Kurosawa, Antonioni, Visconti, Ford, etc., etc..  It doesn't even come close, and it's an insult to every serious film goer on the planet.I don't think this film is the worst thing I've ever seen, but it is not a very good film, either.  It's barely a mediocre one.  It becomes more and more boring as it progresses, and aside from a few funny lines and good widescreen framing, it's an immensely dull exercise.  Most of the acting borders on grating, and many of the characters are just dull and very uninteresting.  The characters may be aimless, but the filmmaking is also aimless as well.  It's shapeless and formless, and feels like a student film more than anything.  Some people have called it a glorified home movie, and in some ways, they're right.  Lena Dunham's cast consist of her sister and mother (her mother is a famous photographer in NYC, which may explain why Lena is getting a lot of breaks in her career after one mediocre film).Trendy critics who are praising this film to the hilt should really reconsider their opinions next time.  It is more important to look at a film objectively and criticise it on its merits than being part of the next hip, trendy thing.  While Tiny Furniture is not as amateurish as other films of its type (Tiny Furniture in in some ways a ""mumblecore"" genre, and it's more professionally polished than most of those films are), it is by no means a great film, and should not be praised as one.  Always remember.  Just because a film is an indie film doesn't automatically make it a work of genius or even a decent film.There are some shorts on the DVD as well, and one of them, Pressure, has to be one of the worst shorts I've ever seen.  Criterion received a lot of criticism for including this film in their collection, and they deserved it in my opinion.

1513224,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B00687XNVM,Gryphonisle,"[4, 5]","The picture on the cover, of Aura laying on the floor says it all;  that IS Aura, throughout the film, a dour plain-jane, with a whiney voice, moping about.  Her style ranges from unkempt to frumpy;  her attitude somewhere between depression and stressed.  It's listed as a Drama/Comedy, but I fail to see what's funny, unless we're supposed to laugh AT Aura and Co;  but the characters aren't like that.  They're dysfunctional, but not portrayed in a manner that would make them subjects of our laughter, as say those in &#34;Portlandia&#34;, where characters based on similar people are exaggerated, and in the exaggeration lies the humor.According to the blurb for this film, Aura has just graduated college and returned home confronted by several issues (confronted by, because she won't confront anything) including her boyfriend having left her for Burning Man (Colorado, actually, don't know where the BM comes in) and having a useless film degree.Useless?  The film never explains why it's useless.  I guess the film makers presume we, the working stiffs in the audience, consider film degrees a good way to spend a lot of money to no practical end, but Aura is the daughter of a very successful artist mother;  She has come back to New York---which is displacing California as the studio production center of American film and TV; and Astoria, the hub of much of that activity is close by.  So does she put out applications there?No.She gets a hostess job, on the recommendation of her childhood friend, because---so very Aura---it's there, doesn't require any effort, and it's basically hers to take.  You'd expect this from a high school student, or a young person without a degree, but she's barely home and she's already settling, not reaching, not putting out any effort.And whining, moaning, moping about.  Constantly.In short, Aura, and most of her circle, are the sort of kids you read about, children who grew up in busy homes where the parent(s) often found it faster to do the chore themselves, than to assign it to the child and see they get it done.  We've seen the outcome, and it isn't pretty:  The sad gay guy who jumped off a bridge after his roommate maliciously posted pictures of him kissing another man;  the young talented hacker arrested on archaic Federal laws, who killed himself in prison.  What on earth would have become of the Gay Rights movement if it's leaders had killed themselves at the first of many humiliations they faced?  What would have become of the anti-Apartheid struggle, if Nelson Mandela had killed himself when first arrested?  Aura is one of these tragic children who've fallen into adulthood unprepared; a person with no sense of perspective, for whom the slightest of life's many pricks becomes a festering wound.And oh the tantrums!  She breaks her mother's rules, and when questioned, first runs to denial, then turns the questions into accusations against her mother; and finally, like a two year old, starts screaming and throwing stuff on the floor.I like little films where conversation is all that happens. I loved the &#34;Before Midnight&#34; movies and &#34;A Christmas Tale&#34;.  But those had adults, engaging in adult conversations.  This is not one of those films.  This is a film about a woman-child who eventually decides to come back home and resume her childhood, and even finishes the film by climbing into bed with her mother to seal the deal, just like the little girl she refuses to accept has grown up.You may like this.

1513226,A3Q33Y0V8M1GNL,B00687XNVM,Jeff the Zombie,"[11, 14]","'m in a very weird place when it comes to how I feel about Lena Dunham's debut film, Tiny Furniture. On the one hand, I respect here accomplishment -- taking the standard coming of age film and subverting our expectations, de-romanticizing youth and offering an unsentimental look at a young woman's immediate post-college days at her mother's loft in Manhattan. On the other hand, I find myself disliking much of the cast, wallowing as they do in self-obsessed passive agressive narcissism. But I suspect that's the point.Dunham's characters exist in a bubble of Tribeca privilege -- they don't have problems with money, there are no social issues to speak of, and the greatest tragedy is the death of a pet hamster. They are quite literally the ""Urban Liberal Elites"" that the Republicans rail against. But beneath the veneer of privilege you find sad, miserable people who are very dissatisfied with their lives -- as if the lack of conflict and the very low stakes in which they exist leave them unmoored from life itself.Aura, the film's protagonist, finds herself adrift in Manhattan -- college is over, and yet she doesn't know what to do next. She spends the summer pining for two men -- one, a ""YouTube star"" who has taken residence in her mother's loft but shows no romantic interest in Aura, and the second, Keith, a chef in the hip restaurant where Aura takes a job as a hostess. Both men abuse and take advantage of Aura in different ways, but the end result of both relationships is Aura blaming herself for their selfishness.Meanwhile, Aura deals with the dysfunctional relationships she has with her mother, a famous artist, and her genius sister, who wins a major poetry award without trying. An old friend from high school, Charlotte (who may or may not be British, but has a British accent), provides Aura with companionship and bad advice, and another friend, Frankie, a new friend from college, is seen mostly from afar via telephone calls. But the two operate as counterpoints to one another -- one, an affluent young woman who lives a life of leisure and wants for nothing, and the other, a driven middle class girl with career ambitions -- and represent the two choices Aura has. The friend she sides with isn't particularly surprising, but it does help underscore the point of Tiny Furniture.That ultimately, life is ugly and unsentimental -- that people make bad decisions and live to regret them. And despite their desire to fix things, they keep making the wrong choices. I may not have enjoyed Tiny Furniture as much as the marketing suggested I would, but I did appreciate its honesty and integrity -- both in its unflinching portrayal of the life of a young woman and its refusal to bow to Hollywood standards for coming of age stories. In Tiny Furniture, people don't come of age, they just get older. And the ticking clock of time provides no pat closure or life lessons, only the knowledge that old age is coming, and even if you manage to get things together, you may still fail to find happiness and understanding. But you may learn to live with it.Although the film was meant to evoke Woody Allen or the early work of Nora Ephron, I'm also reminded of similar films of unsentimental youth, including an obscure indie film featuring Lauren Ambrose called Swimming, the claustrophobic personal films of John Cassavetes, and the starkly cynical 1970's BBS films, especially Five Easy Pieces.The film was shot on HD originally, and Criterion provides a flawless transfer. Despite the pristine, yet cold cinematography, I found the film to lack the artificiality of other films shot straight to a digital format. Mostly this is due to unvarnished bodies of the actors, who look and act like real people, zits and all.The extras include four of Dunham's short films, her first full-length feature, Creative Nonfiction (which is only an hour), an interview with Dunham conducted by Nora Ephron, and a rousing defense of Tiny Furniture by legendary writer and filmmaker Paul Schrader, who quite surprisingly is well-versed in the mumblecore genre where Tiny Furniture ultimately has its roots, as well as the criticisms leveled against both Dunham and the film. This edition continues Criterion's excellent documentation of the work of young independent female directors that began with the excellent British film, The Fish Tank.",4,A Stark and Unsentimental Portrait of a Young Woman in New York,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,4358,"[""'m"", 'very', 'weird', 'place', 'when', 'how', 'feel', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'debut', 'film', 'Tiny', 'Furniture', 'one', 'hand', 'respect', 'here', 'accomplishment', 'taking', 'standard', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'subverting', 'expectations', 'de-romanticizing', 'youth', 'offering', 'unsentimental', 'look', 'young', 'woman', 'immediate', 'post-college', 'days', 'mother', 'loft', 'Manhattan', 'other', 'hand', 'find', 'disliking', 'much', 'cast', 'wallowing', 'do', 'self-obsessed', 'passive', 'agressive', 'narcissism', 'suspect', 'point.Dunham', 'characters', 'exist', 'bubble', 'Tribeca', 'privilege', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'money', 'are', 'social', 'issues', 'speak', 'greatest', 'tragedy', 'death', 'pet', 'hamster', 'are', 'quite', 'literally', 'Urban', 'Liberal', 'Elites', 'Republicans', 'rail', 'veneer', 'privilege', 'find', 'sad', 'miserable', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'dissatisfied', 'lives', 'lack', 'conflict', 'very', 'low', 'stakes', 'exist', 'leave', 'unmoored', 'life', 'itself.Aura', 'film', 'protagonist', 'adrift', 'Manhattan', 'college', 'yet', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'summer', 'pining', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'YouTube', 'star', 'who', 'taken', 'residence', 'mother', 'loft', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Aura', 'second', 'Keith', 'chef', 'hip', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Aura', 'job', 'hostess', 'men', 'abuse', 'take', 'advantage', 'Aura', 'different', 'ways', 'end', 'result', 'relationships', 'Aura', 'blaming', 'selfishness.Meanwhile', 'Aura', 'dysfunctional', 'relationships', 'mother', 'famous', 'artist', 'genius', 'sister', 'who', 'major', 'poetry', 'award', 'trying', 'old', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'Charlotte', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'British', 'British', 'accent', 'Aura', 'companionship', 'bad', 'advice', 'friend', 'Frankie', 'new', 'friend', 'college', 'seen', 'mostly', 'afar', 'telephone', 'calls', 'two', 'operate', 'counterpoints', 'one', 'one', 'affluent', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'life', 'leisure', 'nothing', 'other', 'driven', 'middle', 'class', 'girl', 'career', 'ambitions', 'represent', 'two', 'choices', 'Aura', 'friend', 'sides', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'surprising', 'help', 'underscore', 'point', 'Tiny', 'Furniture.That', 'ultimately', 'life', 'ugly', 'unsentimental', 'people', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions', 'live', 'regret', 'desire', 'fix', 'things', 'keep', 'making', 'wrong', 'choices', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Tiny', 'Furniture', 'as', 'much', 'marketing', 'suggested', 'would', 'did', 'appreciate', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'unflinching', 'portrayal', 'life', 'young', 'woman', 'refusal', 'bow', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'coming', 'age', 'stories', 'Tiny', 'Furniture', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'age', 'just', 'get', 'older', 'ticking', 'clock', 'time', 'pat', 'closure', 'life', 'lessons', 'only', 'knowledge', 'old', 'age', 'coming', 'even', 'manage', 'get', 'things', 'together', 'may', 'still', 'fail', 'find', 'happiness', 'understanding', 'may', 'learn', 'live', 'it.Although', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'evoke', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'early', 'work', 'Nora', 'Ephron', ""'m"", 'also', 'reminded', 'similar', 'films', 'unsentimental', 'youth', 'including', 'obscure', 'indie', 'film', 'featuring', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'called', 'Swimming', 'claustrophobic', 'personal', 'films', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'starkly', 'cynical', '1970', 'BBS', 'films', 'especially', 'Five', 'Easy', 'Pieces.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'HD', 'originally', 'Criterion', 'flawless', 'transfer', 'pristine', 'yet', 'cold', 'cinematography', 'found', 'film', 'lack', 'artificiality', 'other', 'films', 'shot', 'straight', 'digital', 'format', 'Mostly', 'due', 'unvarnished', 'bodies', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'act', 'real', 'people', 'zits', 'all.The', 'extras', 'include', 'four', 'Dunham', 'short', 'films', 'first', 'full-length', 'feature', 'Creative', 'Nonfiction', 'only', 'hour', 'interview', 'Dunham', 'conducted', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'rousing', 'defense', 'Tiny', 'Furniture', 'legendary', 'writer', 'filmmaker', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'who', 'quite', 'surprisingly', 'well-versed', 'mumblecore', 'genre', 'where', 'Tiny', 'Furniture', 'ultimately', 'roots', 'as', 'well', 'criticisms', 'leveled', 'Dunham', 'film', 'edition', 'Criterion', 'excellent', 'documentation', 'work', 'young', 'independent', 'female', 'directors', 'began', 'excellent', 'British', 'film', 'Fish', 'Tank']",Tiny Furniture

It's a comedy People, not a trial to determine if Lena Dunham is a witch (if she floats, she is, if she drowns, she's not).I found it consistently funny throughout; leaving the general good feeling that comedy brings.

It's not terribly well-acted, and like its young protagonist it struggles in earnest for plot and direction.  But it can be at times subtle, nuanced, witty, and endearing.Leah Dunham plays Aura, a recent liberal arts graduate who has come home to live with her successful artist mother and even more successful high school student sister.

1513233,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00687XNVM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[32, 40]","When Lena Dunham's ""Tiny Furniture"" debuted in 2010, it became somewhat of a critical darling with near unanimous praise from mainstream outlets.  Heck, Dunham even won an Independent Spirit Award for its screenplay.  While the film is an interesting, if somewhat slight, indie--it probably plays to a more niche market than the critics would have you suspect.  In that way, it seems an ideal choice for a boutique Criterion presentation.  Dunham's work (she is its writer, director, and star) and characters ably showcase a combination of post-collegiate ennui and over-educated (and pseudo-intellectual) entitlement.  Set in a fashionable New York City young, artistic and urban environment--the film's sardonic tone and cultural critique was sometimes reminiscent (to me) of the works of Whit Stillman (Metropolitan) but with an edgier and more modernized vibe.  But the quirky story, which can be quite funny, also achieves a quiet poignancy when you least expect it.  I suspect that, in many ways, ""Tiny Furniture"" will be fairly divisive when discovered by a wider audience.  While I do think many will embrace its plentiful charms, I think it will have just as many detractors who might not connect with its core characters.Dunham plays a recent film school graduate who returns home to live with her mother and sister in New York.  Reeling with uncertainty, she has no idea what to do with her life.  She reconnects with old friends, take a entry level job, spars with her sister and generally just goes with the flow with a rather apathetic view toward the future.  Some of the film's funniest moments are provided by the almost elitist and superior set of friends that Dunham weaves throughout the picture.  Kids who have more confidence and entitlement than ambition or talent.  This is a world where YouTube has become a proving ground of celebrity, where reading a book is the height of intellectual status.  It is a subtle skewering of a generation yet to find a purpose.  But although I really enjoyed some of the offbeat humor in these sequences, it is rather stylized and probably not for every taste.  The segments of home life are just as interesting, and the final quiet moment between daughter and mother is, perhaps, the film's strongest and most memorable scene.""Tiny Furniture"" is, in no way, a plot-driven piece.  If you need a big story, this won't please you.  This is a character driven indie that creates a mood and allows its characters to grow and shift in slight, but significant, ways.  Dunham, as a writer, has a very specific voice.  As an actress, she is unafraid to showcase (and expose) a very personal, and oftentimes unpleasant, side to her persona.  And yet, she remains eminently identifiable.  I also really liked Laurie Simmons, as her mother, who provides quite a few laughs throughout but whose complexities provide a lot of the film's shadings.  While ""Tiny Furniture"" is not perfect, I really liked its sensibilities which were simultaneously absurd AND real providing for a winning combination.The Criterion release is a real showcase for Dunham.  Her 2009 hour-long feature ""Creative Nonfiction"" is included in its entirety.  Sharing some of the same themes as ""Tiny Furniture,"" the film looks and feels a bit more amateurish but highlights Dunham's deadpan comedic timing and is surprisingly funny and engaging.  The presentation also includes four short films by Dunham, an interview with writer/director Paul Schrader, and Nora Ephron's interview with Dunham.  Even though ""Tiny Furniture"" is a micro-budget indie, Dunham already has Hollywood heavyweights Schrader and Ephron acknowledging her work.  I say that bodes well for this promising filmmaker, and I look forward to what others stories she has to tell.

Having gone to college in Ohio, Aura moves back home to New York City where her mother is a successful photographer. She must share a loft style bedroom with her 17 year old sister Nadine (Grace Dunham, a real sister I'll bet). Her mother Siri (Laurie Simmons) urges Aura to find work and get a place (or a man) of her own. Aura takes a meaningless job as a reservationist at a local restaurant but it doesn't last long.She meets some goofball at a party who is a minor league You-Tube contributor. He mooches upon Aura when her mother and sister go away for a week exploring college campuses. Aura, a tad horny, is thinking that this might lead somewhere, but it doesn't. The unlikeable Jed (Alex Karpovsky) isn't interested in romance or even sex, at least with Aura. She also has a very uncomfortable quickie with a chef at the restaurant where she works.This drama really doesn't have much to say. All of the characters are unappealing and unlikeable, so what does it have going for it. Well, Lena Dunham. She shows an almost unheard of willingness to put herself out there where few dare to venture. She isn't beautiful. You can count the pimples on the Blu Ray disc. And her figure will not win many modeling auditions, but there she is, with little or nothing on and willing to get it on. You can think of plenty of guys who play this role (think Zach Galifianakis or Seth Rogen or Jonah Hill) but rarely a woman. I've seen the first episode of Dunham's new weekly cable series ""Girls"" and you can use this film as a ""pilot"" from what I've seen so far.While I have some reservations about the movie there should be none with regard to this Criterion Blu ray transfer.

Anyone who disagrees with her is subject to a torrent of abuse so outrageous that I wonder why someone didn't just smack her.The only extra on the DVD I watched was an interview with the fine Paul Schrader, who was convinced that this was a work of brilliance, and many of his points were valid, but not enough to erase the cluelessness of its central character. One thing Schrader pointed out was how perfectly every shot was centered, and he couldn't be more correct. I thought the subject matter could've been more enervating. Even ""Wristcutters: A Love Story"" showed unpleasant people who were at least interesting.Sorry, fans, it just didn't work for me, and I'm a HUGE fan of independent film.",3,Interesting character study...,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,1091,"['guess', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'impressed', 'Lisa', 'Dunham', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'annoyed', 'me.It', 'lot', 'guts', 'filmmaker', 'show', 'how', 'whiny', 'unmotivated', 'generally', 'unpleasant', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'leave', 'college', 'Indeed', 'Ms', 'Dunham', 'autobiographical', 'film', 'confrontational', 'turn', 'not', 'someone', 'really', 'care', 'Anyone', 'who', 'subject', 'torrent', 'abuse', 'so', 'outrageous', 'wonder', 'why', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'smack', 'her.The', 'only', 'DVD', 'watched', 'was', 'interview', 'fine', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'who', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'work', 'brilliance', 'many', 'points', 'were', 'valid', 'not', 'enough', 'erase', 'cluelessness', 'central', 'character', 'One', 'thing', 'Schrader', 'pointed', 'out', 'was', 'how', 'perfectly', 'shot', 'was', 'centered', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'correct', 'thought', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'enervating', 'Even', 'Wristcutters', 'Love', 'Story', 'showed', 'unpleasant', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'least', 'interesting.Sorry', 'fans', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'fan', 'independent', 'film']",Tiny Furniture
1513242,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00687XNVM,RMurray847,"[41, 48]","I FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN THE CRITERION BLU RAY.  THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE ITSELF.  I PUT IT OUT HERE, BECAUSE I THINK SO FEW PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF IT OR KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  TO THOSE WHO THINK WRITING A REVIEW FOR A PRODUCT THAT ISN'T OUT YET IS ""BAD""...I APOLOGIZE.Aura has just finished college in Ohio.  Her major is Film Theory.  Her boyfriend of 3 years has broken up with her, however.  With no job prospects and no love life, she returns to the NYC home of her mother and her gifted younger sister Nadine.  She spends a lot of time moping and she half-heartedly restarts a friendship with the far perkier, but clearly spoiled and selfish Charlotte.  She takes a low paying job as a day hostess.  She half-heartedly dates a Youtube star she meets at a party and she half-heartedly flirts with a good-looking but attached chef at her restaurant.Aura is utterly aimless...and it is her aimlessness that is the focus of director/writer/star Lena Dunham's TINY FURNITURE.  It's a very low-budget film that depicts lots of listless young people doing a lot of whining, navel-gazing and engaging in sharp-edged banter.  The movie shows us a very tiny little particular sub-culture of humanity (bored, over-educated, under-employed New York City residents with artistic pretensions).  It feels very real and specific...yet the people we meet are extremely aggravating.  Some will find them actively upsetting. I found most of them to be beneath getting worked up about...but just low-grade annoyances.  And absolutely NOT people I'd want to spend time with.Aura makes mistakes with both men...but neither of them was right for her anyway.  She irritates the heck out of her successful artist mother and has a volatile relationship with her high achieving and oh-so superior teenage sister, who seems to have the drive her intelligent but aimless older sister lacks.  She drives away one ""good"" friend and spends too much time with a ""bad"" friend.As I write all this, I realize it makes the movie sound darn near unwatchable.  This is not true.  Dunham has crafted some very funny dialogue for her characters...and to her credit, the witty remarks actually sound like something these people might say.  They are so full of disdain for the world around them, but clearly feel the lack of belonging to that world.  The Youtube artist that Aura spends some time with has become ""famous"" because he's made a series of videos depicting himself riding on a rocking horse while reciting Nietzsche.  This has gotten him an agent and some appointments with producers in NYC.  Yet it's also earned him no money, and he's essentially homeless in the city while making his rounds.  Aura has a degree in film theory, a very passive degree indeed.  Not in film production...theory.  God forbid she should actually MAKE something.  These modest plot turns and observations make TINY FURNITURE some fun to watch.Dunham does an amusing job playing a character that I sincerely hope is not much like her.  She has no shame as an actress...she spends much of the movie lying around her house in a shirt and panties, with her hair unkempt.  She just can't make an effort to be presentable...even when she goes out, she appears to deliberately wear unflattering clothing.  She has cast her real-life mother as her movie mother and her real life sister as her movie sister.  Both performers are okay, but nothing great.  But it's amusing see the physical similarities and differences.TINY FURNITURE is a tiny film (reported budget is $45,000).  While only 98 minutes long, it drags in places.  Nothing much happens, and next to nothing is resolved.  But it's got some wit and a good control of tone.  I'm certainly impressed enough to at least be interested in seeing what Dunham does next.  This is not a movie for everyone.  If you shy away from ""indie"" or ""quirky""...stay far away.  But if you're always looking for something new(ish) and offbeat, I think you'll find at least a few satisfying nuggets here.",3,An amusing movie about ANNOYING people.,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,4010,"['FULLY', 'ACKNOWLEDGE', 'HAVE', 'NOT', 'SEEN', 'THE', 'CRITERION', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'ITSELF', 'PUT', 'IT', 'OUT', 'HERE', 'BECAUSE', 'THINK', 'SO', 'FEW', 'PEOPLE', 'HAVE', 'HEARD', 'IT', 'OR', 'KNOW', 'ANYTHING', 'IT', 'TO', 'THOSE', 'WHO', 'THINK', 'WRITING', 'A', 'REVIEW', 'A', 'PRODUCT', 'THAT', ""N'T"", 'OUT', 'YET', 'IS', 'BAD', 'APOLOGIZE.Aura', 'just', 'finished', 'college', 'Ohio', 'major', 'Film', 'Theory', 'boyfriend', '3', 'years', 'broken', 'up', 'however', 'job', 'prospects', 'love', 'life', 'NYC', 'home', 'mother', 'gifted', 'younger', 'sister', 'Nadine', 'lot', 'time', 'moping', 'half-heartedly', 'friendship', 'far', 'perkier', 'clearly', 'spoiled', 'selfish', 'Charlotte', 'low', 'paying', 'job', 'day', 'hostess', 'half-heartedly', 'Youtube', 'star', 'party', 'half-heartedly', 'flirts', 'good-looking', 'attached', 'chef', 'restaurant.Aura', 'utterly', 'aimless', 'aimlessness', 'focus', 'director/writer/star', 'Lena', 'Dunham', 'TINY', 'FURNITURE', 'very', 'low-budget', 'film', 'lots', 'listless', 'young', 'people', 'doing', 'lot', 'whining', 'navel-gazing', 'engaging', 'sharp-edged', 'banter', 'movie', 'very', 'tiny', 'little', 'particular', 'sub-culture', 'humanity', 'bored', 'over-educated', 'under-employed', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'residents', 'artistic', 'pretensions', 'very', 'real', 'specific', 'yet', 'people', 'meet', 'are', 'extremely', 'aggravating', 'will', 'find', 'actively', 'upsetting', 'found', 'most', 'be', 'beneath', 'getting', 'worked', 'up', 'just', 'low-grade', 'annoyances', 'absolutely', 'NOT', 'people', ""'d"", 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'with.Aura', 'mistakes', 'men', 'was', 'right', 'anyway', 'heck', 'successful', 'artist', 'mother', 'volatile', 'relationship', 'high', 'achieving', 'oh-so', 'superior', 'teenage', 'sister', 'who', 'have', 'drive', 'intelligent', 'aimless', 'older', 'sister', 'lacks', 'away', 'one', 'good', 'friend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'bad', 'friend.As', 'write', 'realize', 'movie', 'sound', 'darn', 'unwatchable', 'not', 'true', 'Dunham', 'crafted', 'very', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'credit', 'witty', 'remarks', 'actually', 'sound', 'something', 'people', 'might', 'say', 'are', 'so', 'full', 'disdain', 'world', 'clearly', 'feel', 'lack', 'belonging', 'world', 'Youtube', 'artist', 'Aura', 'time', 'become', 'famous', 'made', 'series', 'videos', 'depicting', 'riding', 'rocking', 'horse', 'reciting', 'Nietzsche', 'gotten', 'agent', 'appointments', 'producers', 'NYC', 'also', 'earned', 'money', 'essentially', 'homeless', 'city', 'making', 'rounds', 'Aura', 'degree', 'film', 'theory', 'very', 'passive', 'degree', 'indeed', 'Not', 'film', 'production', 'theory', 'God', 'forbid', 'should', 'actually', 'MAKE', 'something', 'modest', 'plot', 'turns', 'observations', 'make', 'TINY', 'FURNITURE', 'fun', 'watch.Dunham', 'amusing', 'job', 'playing', 'character', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'not', 'much', 'shame', 'actress', 'much', 'movie', 'lying', 'house', 'shirt', 'panties', 'hair', 'unkempt', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'effort', 'be', 'presentable', 'even', 'when', 'out', 'deliberately', 'wear', 'unflattering', 'clothing', 'cast', 'real-life', 'mother', 'movie', 'mother', 'real', 'life', 'sister', 'movie', 'sister', 'performers', 'are', 'okay', 'nothing', 'great', 'amusing', 'see', 'physical', 'similarities', 'differences.TINY', 'FURNITURE', 'tiny', 'film', 'reported', 'budget', '45,000', 'only', '98', 'minutes', 'long', 'places', 'Nothing', 'much', 'happens', 'next', 'nothing', 'resolved', 'got', 'wit', 'good', 'control', 'tone', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'impressed', 'enough', 'least', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'Dunham', 'next', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'shy', 'away', 'indie', 'quirky', 'stay', 'far', 'away', ""'re"", 'always', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'ish', 'offbeat', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'least', 'few', 'satisfying', 'nuggets', 'here']",Tiny Furniture
1513243,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B00687XNVM,Robin Simmons,"[4, 6]","Named Best Narrative Feature at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival and now given the prestigious Criterion Blu-ray treatment, Lena Dunham's strangely engaging feature film stars herself, her real life sister and mother.  Also, it was mostly shot in her mom's home.  Lena plays Aura, a recent Film Theory graduate from a Midwestern university who realizes her degree is worthless.  The real life Lena - also a film school graduate -- makes a movie that is in some ways about her - but not really.  Her unusual, plainly plump persona is not unlike Woody Allen's on-screen self-deprecating self in his earlier - funny - films.  Aura's life is a series of put-upon incidents that includes a guy who made a popular Youtube video and is ""taking meetings"" in New York City who, while Aura's mom's away, invites himself into her bedroom as a permanent guest even though he has no interest in her.  With nothing much else going on in her life, Aura takes a job as hostess for a restaurant where she becomes enamored with an insensitive, married chef.  All these threads play out in a way that seems real and uncontrived.  I was kind of mesmerized by this unexpectedly witty film about how one can make art from ennui and dejection.
