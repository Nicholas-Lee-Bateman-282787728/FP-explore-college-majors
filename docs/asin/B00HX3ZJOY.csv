1692951,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B00HX3ZJOY,Alan Ramirez,"[16, 17]","When I heard about ""Looking"" I wasn't excited at all. It sounded like a bad copy of ""Queer as Folk"" but I decided to give it a chance anyway. And I'm glad I did! ""Looking"" follows the lives of three gay friends in San Francisco, but what makes this show so unique is that they don't have to try too hard, I even forgot at times that it was a ""gay show"" because you find a little bit of yourself in every character, and you get to love them by the second or third episode and you get addicted instantly, that's how I know a show is good! The cast works really great together, the series doesn't follow the typical stereotypes, they are just guys with issues that anyone would have, which I find very refreshing, and lately, media is all about gay teens, but what about gay adults?The shoots from locations of San Francisco are just beautiful, and the writing is superb, but I'm sad that the season only has 8 episodes because I want more! At least it was renewed for a second season earlier this week, and hopefully season 2 will have 10 or 13 episodes.This show may not be for everyone, some scenes are explicit (not graphic, but you quickly understand what's going on without seeing anything graphical), and it gets a little clich&eacute; sometimes, but it's a good show overall. Every episode is a great episode.It's really worth the pre-order and I can't wait to see the last two episodes! (by the time i'm writing this, only 6 of the 8 episodes have aired so far).

1692952,A189VV6P4IZJXI,B00HX3ZJOY,Anthony McGill,"[21, 21]","Sadly season one has concluded and like all grand ""soap operas"" the ending left relationships topsy turvy so now we keenly wait for season two to see what those crafty writers will come up with.  I have really enjoyed and heartily recommend LOOKING, an excellent new series with realistic, well-defined characters and situations that we can all identify with.  It mainly revolves around three quite different friends and their complex relationships and work day activities.  You're going to adore the just turned 40 Dom who is battling to set up his dream restaurant and though at first I wasn't too keen on nerdy Patrick, I now love this character. And who can resist Patrick's boss Trev with his anglo twang, cute stick out ears and delectable fleshy rump as displayed in episode eight.  Think it's well worth purchasing this series when it is released.  I have it on pre-order and can't wait to relive all the episodes in their entirety and savor the moments you often miss in a fast moving brief chapter.  Not unlike QUEER AS FOLK  but a lot more gritty and contemporary (and a hell lot more real!) as you would expect from Andrew Haigh of WEEKEND fame who is co-executive producer and director of the early episodes.  And being set and filmed in San Francisco (the location shooting is great and avoids the traditional picture postcard look of the city) is an obvious plus.  Unfortunately there are only eight episodes in season one but the great news is, LOOKING has been renewed for a second season!  And hopefully with more episodes.  Come on HBO, eight half-hour episodes, just whetting the appetite!!  From what I have seen from the first season, this series is one of the best, most entertaining and thoughtful gay-themed programs to hit our screens.",5,SEASON ONE WORTH REMEMBERING,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,1761,"['Sadly', 'season', 'one', 'concluded', 'grand', 'soap', 'operas', 'ending', 'left', 'relationships', 'topsy', 'turvy', 'so', 'now', 'keenly', 'wait', 'season', 'two', 'see', 'what', 'crafty', 'writers', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'LOOKING', 'excellent', 'new', 'series', 'realistic', 'well-defined', 'characters', 'situations', 'can', 'identify', 'mainly', 'around', 'three', 'quite', 'different', 'friends', 'complex', 'relationships', 'work', 'day', 'activities', ""'re"", 'going', 'adore', 'just', 'turned', '40', 'Dom', 'who', 'battling', 'set', 'up', 'dream', 'restaurant', 'though', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'nerdy', 'Patrick', 'now', 'love', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'resist', 'Patrick', 'boss', 'Trev', 'anglo', 'twang', 'cute', 'stick', 'ears', 'delectable', 'fleshy', 'rump', 'displayed', 'episode', 'eight', 'Think', 'well', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'series', 'when', 'released', 'have', 'pre-order', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'relive', 'episodes', 'entirety', 'savor', 'moments', 'often', 'miss', 'fast', 'moving', 'brief', 'chapter', 'Not', 'QUEER', 'AS', 'FOLK', 'lot', 'more', 'gritty', 'contemporary', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'real', 'would', 'expect', 'Andrew', 'Haigh', 'WEEKEND', 'fame', 'who', 'co-executive', 'producer', 'director', 'early', 'episodes', 'being', 'set', 'filmed', 'San', 'Francisco', 'location', 'shooting', 'great', 'traditional', 'picture', 'postcard', 'look', 'city', 'obvious', 'plus', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'only', 'eight', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'great', 'news', 'LOOKING', 'been', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', 'hopefully', 'more', 'episodes', 'Come', 'HBO', 'eight', 'half-hour', 'episodes', 'just', 'whetting', 'appetite', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'gay-themed', 'programs', 'hit', 'screens']",N/A

1692956,A3BXOADDSC4BJU,B00HX3ZJOY,Glovely,"[4, 31]","A show about three friends living and, as the title suggests (and the episodes so far seem to indicate), looking for (I suppose) love in San Francisco.  It's a concept that deserves the disaster its headed for.  For one thing, the 'looking' is confined to a very particular lifestyle which has yet to venture beyond clubs, bars, public baths and state-of-the-art hooking-up (via devices like iPhone, etc.): locations and methods which are hardly conducive to fidelity or monogamy. So when the main characters fail to find what they were 'looking' for, it quite frankly serves them right.As for the main characters:- one is unemployed, vaguely artistic, and in an open relationship with his boyfriend (an arrangement which he finds increasingly dissatisfying)- one is an aging waiter with a vague ambition of opening a restaurant who has anonymous sex with men considerably younger than himself (although an older man, a florist, who might help him realize his ambition has caught his eye)- one is a video game designer who is rather whinily (and somewhat half-heartedly) courting a hair-dresser/stylist/whatever whom he met on a bus, while alternately lusting after the boss at his video game-designing job.All three are insecure and neurotic.  And talentless.  Painfully talentless.  Particularly the vaguely artistic one.  The florist only slightly redeems himself by becoming impatient with the aging waiter's nonsense.  The video game designer's boss seemed at first a promising counterpoint to his idiotic and doting employee, but now he is displaying insecurities of his own.  Otherwise the characters are aimless, ugly, not terribly literate, and seemingly lacking in any worthwhile touchstones.  And against the background of a washed out San Francisco (is this simply the color-grading?) it's even more despicable.With any luck HBO won't renew this insipid series.",1,Lacking,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,1873,"['show', 'three', 'friends', 'living', 'title', 'episodes', 'so', 'far', 'seem', 'indicate', 'looking', 'suppose', 'love', 'San', 'Francisco', 'concept', 'disaster', 'headed', 'one', 'thing', ""'looking"", 'confined', 'very', 'particular', 'lifestyle', 'yet', 'venture', 'clubs', 'bars', 'public', 'baths', 'state-of-the-art', 'hooking-up', 'devices', 'iPhone', 'etc', 'locations', 'methods', 'are', 'hardly', 'conducive', 'fidelity', 'monogamy', 'So', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'fail', 'find', 'what', 'were', ""'looking"", 'quite', 'frankly', 'serves', 'right.As', 'main', 'characters', 'one', 'unemployed', 'vaguely', 'artistic', 'open', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'arrangement', 'increasingly', 'dissatisfying', 'one', 'aging', 'waiter', 'vague', 'ambition', 'opening', 'restaurant', 'who', 'anonymous', 'sex', 'men', 'considerably', 'younger', 'older', 'man', 'florist', 'who', 'might', 'help', 'realize', 'ambition', 'caught', 'eye', 'one', 'video', 'game', 'designer', 'who', 'rather', 'whinily', 'somewhat', 'half-heartedly', 'courting', 'hair-dresser/stylist/whatever', 'whom', 'met', 'bus', 'alternately', 'lusting', 'boss', 'video', 'game-designing', 'job.All', 'three', 'are', 'insecure', 'neurotic', 'talentless', 'Painfully', 'talentless', 'Particularly', 'vaguely', 'artistic', 'one', 'florist', 'only', 'slightly', 'becoming', 'impatient', 'aging', 'waiter', 'nonsense', 'video', 'game', 'designer', 'boss', 'seemed', 'first', 'promising', 'counterpoint', 'idiotic', 'doting', 'employee', 'now', 'displaying', 'insecurities', 'own', 'characters', 'are', 'aimless', 'ugly', 'not', 'terribly', 'literate', 'seemingly', 'lacking', 'worthwhile', 'touchstones', 'background', 'washed', 'out', 'San', 'Francisco', 'simply', 'color-grading', 'even', 'more', 'despicable.With', 'luck', 'HBO', 'wo', ""n't"", 'renew', 'insipid', 'series']",N/A

Both the heterosexual stereotypes and our own don't apply here. This piece is about gay men single or not,who while they are fit and attractive, are not relentless body nazis. And (gasp) some of them are getting older in a youth obsessed culture. While it is topical and current many of the scenarios that play out her are timeless. The main character, subtlety played by Groth, often makes missteps in finding Mr. Right or even just Mr. Right now (he seems to be on Both sides of the fence). There is a couple who surprises themselves by bringing a third party in for a threesome. The best character for me, as a man of a certain age, is played by Bartlett. He can't seem to let go of how he was acting as a twenty five year old. All of these characters and situations ring true.

1692962,A224BKBLXVA859,B00HX3ZJOY,Rocky Sunico,"[1, 1]","What first surprised me about the show is its relative brevity - especially for a US TV series. It only consists of 8 half-hour episodes, which makes it more akin to a British television series. And I think this did the show a lot of good since it made sure that the writing was a lot more focused and thus the character plots also more at the forefront. And given the relative limited cast involved, it meant that most characters had their fair share of time in focus.Patrick is a hard character to love. At times he's adorable and endearing. Other times, he's a little pathetic and tiring. But that all works for him and keeps him very human, and very real. And that sets the tone for most of the show - the simple elegance in its often austere and very true-to-life presentation of things. It's not flashy like QAF was. Instead it's a show that remains firmly rooted in reality, something significantly aided to make sure the time-place setting of contemporary San Francisco is pretty strong.Patrick is obviously the story of focus, but that is not to say that the other threads weren't interesting. I think the story involving Dom was a pretty intriguing one as he tries to find a new path for himself and how tries to resolve his friendship with Lynn. But Agustin's story was pretty messed up and could have used a bit more on-screen development, I think. One could already see where the story was bound to go given the first episode along, but how we get from the beginning to the season ender could have been elaborated upon a bit more.The inclusion of Russell Tovey as Kevin, Patrick's new boss, was naturally a major squee moment for my partner and myself. He's certainly one of the more interesting openly gay actors in the industry and his television work with shows like the original Being Human already had him blip on our radar. Plus he's pretty adorable in a dorky kind of way and the complexities of his character made for a nice enough mix. Yay for more Russell Tovey!On the whole, I enjoyed Looking, but I know the show has a bit of a ways to go before it becomes truly significant versus other TV shows. There were a number of complaints about how the show may have traded old stereotypes for new ones, but seriously, what TV show is totally free of stereotypes? A lot of entertainment holds a mirror up to our lives and Looking didn't go too deeply some of the more classic stuff from LGBT shows like a strong AIDS-related sub-plot or a ridiculous amount of substance abuse on a regular basis as part of the circuit scene. This is not QAF - but I think it's addressing a new niche in terms of what LGBT stories can be told.Looking is a show with a lot of potential and I do plan on sticking around until the second season to see how things go.
