1436504,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B0051GLDQS,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 3]","While many people threw their usual ""remakes are bad!"" fit when the first Quarantine came out, I thought it was good. I liked [REC] better, but when it came down to it, Quarantine was nearly the exact same movie, shot for shot, and if I hadn't seen [REC] first, I might have liked it more instead. [REC]'s sequel didn't do anything for me and ended up disappointing me more than anything else. Quarantine 2, oddly enough, did the same thing. I had to watch this movie over the course of a week, watching about 15 minutes here and there, watching other movies instead, and coming back to it, only forcing myself to see how it ends in the off chance that something cool happened. Look, I'm not the kind of guy who oogles over actresses in a movie, saying that they make it worth watching, but this is one of those few times where I'll say that the best thing about the movie is the leading lady. Quarantine 2 tones down everything that made the first one worth watching. Unless you have a fear of flying, and maybe airports too, there's nothing here that'll scare anyone who's seen a horror movie before.Rather than picking up where the last one left off, we meet a new group of characters as they board a plane. Everything starts out as normal, until a man brings on his kindergarten class' hamsters. No one checks to see what's in the cage, and he's allowed to put them in the overhead storage with other luggage. The plane's full of a bunch of clich&eacute;s: a couple that can't keep their hands off eachother, the seemingly nice guy who flirts with one of the stewardesses, an arrogant jerk (for lack of better word), quiet computer guy, the obligatory overweight guy, an elderly couple, an elderly woman with a cat, and the lone angsty pre-teen boy who chooses to keep his hood on for 95% of the movie, no matter how bad things get. The flight goes on as usual until a man is bitten by one of the 'hamsters' when he helps move the cage. Soon after, he goes nuts. His eyes change, he makes weird sounds, and he tries to kill everyone in sight. After biting a woman, he's restrained and locked in the plane's bathroom until they can make an emergency landing. Once they land, no one's there to greet them or go about the usual protocol. Instead, everyone's locked in the terminal with armed guards outside the building. They've been quarantined.The name of the movie might be Quarantine 2: Terminal, and give away where most of the movie will take place, though I think it would've worked better if more time had been spent on the plane. Not a lot of time, but enough to really get things rolling. The first third of the movie was doing just fine. It wasn't anything special but I was curious to see where they were going with it. As soon as they arrive though, everything became stale. The terminal is nowhere near as scary as the huge apartment from the original, partially because not enough time is spent with the location. The massive apartment building was thoroughly explored, and it seemed like a maze with very few chances for escape if you got cornered. Here, everyone seems pretty capable in the terminal, finding little passages easily in the dark. What got me the most however, was how tame the kills are. More gore doesn't make a good horror movie, I know, but the director chose to go with less is more, with a couple of the victims getting bitten off-camera. There's no memorable kill to be found in this movie, and that's part of what got me so bored. Most of the characters aren't likable either, which I guess isn't anything new since your average horror movie doesn't get you too involved with them. Quarantine 2 isn't a disaster, it just could've been a little bit better with enough effort.As far as the good goes, Mercedes Mas&ouml;hn as stewardess Jenny, is gorgeous. Does that make me sound like the average guy? Probably. Did she make the movie a little easier to get through? Absolutely. She's also one of the only characters that has a little bit of personality and does her best to take charge of a situation where there's no leader. The only other pro I can think of is that they chose to not remake the second [REC], scene for scene. This is an entirely different movie, and I'm glad I wasn't watching what would've essentially been a translated version of the sequel. Even better- it's not a found footage movie! Oh, and I suppose it was nice to see them continue with the first Quarantine's plot of how the disease came to be. It's kind of shoehorned in, but it's there.Quarantine 2: Terminal is most likely only going to win over teenagers who haven't seen many horror movies. It's a big step down from the original, and while [REC]2 wasn't that great either, it was better than this. Skip it unless you're really, really bored.",2,As boring and tame as you can get for a horror movie.,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,4764,"['many', 'people', 'threw', 'usual', 'remakes', 'are', 'bad',

1436505,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0051GLDQS,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","A deadly virus overtakes the passengers of a small aircraft, forcing the plane to the ground as the infected begin to lash out in violent rage. Once docked, the crew realize that the terminal has been sealed up to prevent the spread of the disease, and those left standing must struggle to find a way out! QUARANTINE 2 is a pathetic excuse for a film that manages to avoid every single quality that made [REC] and the first QUARANTINE so utterly terrifying. The preposterous characters and events make it impossible to take the film seriously at any point, which is made worse by the careless lapses in logic and poor film making techniques. All of the claustrophobic intensity of the cramped aircraft setting is released along with the passengers when they are allowed to exit the plane and go running around the empty terminal. There is absolutely no consistency in the rate at which the infected turn violent, which makes for a further lack of suspense as the characters rush around attempting to save those who have been bitten. In a moment of laugh-out-loud absurdity, the lead actress and her young ward fumble around blindly for a gun that they dropped in a plainly-lit set which was supposed to be pitch black. John Pogue gives us nothing more than a series of cheap shocks in a film that shows all of the skill and intelligence of a poorly-drawn made-for-TV movie. This is a prime example to demonstrate just how effective the Spanish [REC} truly was, and for what reasons.

I usually don't like the first person viewpoint movies, but for this genre, it was pretty nice to see a change up. I think this sequel ruined some of the charm from the first one. The infected people were slightly different in the sequel, which was naturally for the worse, and the characters seemed to be dumber than the average horror movie victim. We've seen enough TV and movies to know when a person gets bit by somebody who is foaming from the mouth, you should probably steer clear of that person. and when the recently bit, starts biting others, you should see a pattern developing and do something about it. You aren't supposed to play dumb until you're dead, mainly because it aggravates the audience.

Right off the bat though, it's very obvious that they shot this on a MUCH lower budget than the first film. Once the action kicks in & people start getting infected with the same virus that infected people in the first film, I was confused as to whether I was watching Quarantine or some kind of Hulk movie. The special effects are horrible. In the first film, the infected had dilated pupils which was more effective. In this one, their eyes are just blood shot. If it's one thing I hate, it's a sequel that doesn't show continuity in every possible way. Some of the cast is believable while others aren't.

The sequel drops all pretenses & jumps right into horror fantasy. The end result is that you remember what type of movie the first one was & it kills your suspension of disbelief for the followup.Pros: Dropping the found-footage formula does make the movie less annoying than it could have been. The only other good things I can say about it is that it has a pretty realistic airplane flight that doesn't feel overly-scripted & it refrains from showing any violence towards animals. If I'm not mistaken, the movie seems to be a bit of an homage to Steven King's Langoleers, or at least kept reminding me of it.Cons: Given that the previous movie wanted us to believe it could be real, I have a hard time believing the following can happen in the real world: A blatantly sick pilot being permitted to fly without being sent home on mandatory sick leave, a stewardess flirting with a passenger while on duty, the inhuman noises the Infected make (Cougar screams, pig squeals, & dog barks), the airport fails to knowledge the emergency landing & actually asks them to reboard & leave, pets are allowed in the passenger compartment, an off-duty physician carrying around medical equipment & medicine with no red tape & paperwork involved in freelancing with them, none of the characters believe that humans can get rabies, human teeth biting through a hasmat suit & face mask hard enough to tear flesh, 99.9% of the people in this movie are white & thin, the Infected move beyond what human testosterone & physics would allow, & can smell like animals despite the fact that the virus couldn't have possibly have tripled the amount of receptors in their olfactory epithelium, & they also pack instead of attacking eachother like they can somehow tell from a distance that another infected isn't a normal person.Other cons: Predictable cliches; Best friend dies, an enemy is kidnapped for exposition before dying.

It was redone for English Audiences almost shot for shot in Quarantine. Which is just as good as rec basically. Rec then had two sequels. Rec 2 and rec 3.  Rec 2 was very good and rec 3 was ok but it had demons in it! Anyways over here they made this  straight to dvd movie sequel ""quarantine 2'; rec 2 and 3 were shown at theatres like rec and quarantine were. Anyways that is the history of the rec franchise to date. Now this sequel does not have the hand held camera approach of ""rec"" or quarantine"" , but it ties in directly to the first movie. As a plane takes off we see them watching the news on the planes seat viewing screens. It's the same night as the first movie and the apartment complex is being quarantined. One of the people from that building escaped earlier and is on the plane with infected rats. Well the virus gets out as you expect and from there it's a movie about people quarantined in a terminal. It's what I expected and it does have some good gore shots. Although not on the level of 'rec 2 or rec 3 mind you.  It's a average b movie from then on. But it's not bad at all. It had a decent budget and was released by Sony. So it's not a super low budgeter. this was done by seasoned professionals. That is saying something in the world of b and c movies etc.  It's worth watching if you like these type of movies and it has no surprises because lets face it you have seen it before.

""Quarantine"" was a nearly shot-for-shot remake of the Spanish horror film ""REC"" with an important exception: the zombie virus was changed from a mystical contagion to a more mundane form of ""human rabies."" This change left more questions than answers: Why were there religious articles taped to the wall of the lab? What's with the freaky little kid at the end? What did the audio tape really say? ""Quarantine 2"" has all the answers.""Quarantine 2"" begins on an airplane but it doesn't stay there for long. The flight from Los Angeles is disrupted when big Ralph (George Back) becomes infected and spreads the infection to stewardess Paula (Bre Blair). The pilots make an emergency landing in a Las Vegas airport only to discover that the entire terminal has been quarantined. Get it? Terminal? Quarantine? Ahem.Captain Forrest (John Curran) and his co-pilot Wilson (Andrew Benator) agree to keep Ralph penned up in the plane's bathroom while the few redeye passengers try to get help. It's not that simple of course. With the exception of baggage handler Ed (Ignacio Serricchio), the survivors soon discover that they're locked inside the terminal. This won't end well for heroine Jenny (Mercedes Masohn), spunky military medic Shilah (Noree Victoria), crazy cat lady, pregnant lady and her angry boyfriend, business guy more concerned about his laptop that other people's lives, and the couple that doesn't speak English but does naughty things on airplanes.

The acting is good, but not great.  Some of the dialog is a bit stilted, but it is a horror movie and not a high drama.  It is a parallel story with a slight continuation of the first Quarantine movie with a bit more of an explanation of what is happening and why.  This is not a rip off of Flight of the Living Dead as someone pointed out.  Also the first Quarantine was not a rip off of Rec, it was the English version of a Spanish language movie.  They didn't steal the idea, they purchased the right to make an English version.

What kept me watching it when I realized it wasn't going to be a remake of Paco Plaza's sequel to the original film, &lt;em>[REC] 2&lt;/em>? (Which is actually pretty good--certainly better than this.) Let's see: you have a first-time director who is best-known for writing the screenplay of the forgettable teen thriller &lt;em>The Skulls&lt;/em> over a decade ago, none of the original cast returning (though to be fair, that would have been kind of difficult--Plaza pulled it off, however), and a script that... okay, yes, it really &lt;em>is&lt;/em> &lt;em>Outbreak on a Plane&lt;/em>. That a movie already exists with that subtitle does not seem to have fazed anyone involved with this production one bit. Oh, and did I mention Marcus Koch (responsible for the execrable &lt;em>100 Tears&lt;/em>) was involved with the effects crew? By the time I got to the end of the credits, I was stunned--stunned, I tell you--not to see Brain Damage Films listed with a production credit. This monstrosity is right up their alley.Plot: the virus from the original &lt;em>Quarantine&lt;/em> finds its way onto a plane, which makes an emergency landing, after which some of the survivors and a helpful airport employee find themselves quarantined in an abandoned airport terminal. I'd tell you more about said survivors, but does it really matter? They're either entirely interchangeable or thin stereotypes you know are destined to get killed by the ever-increasing number of the infected.Yep, that's it. There's no attempt to do anything to extend the idea in any way. For that matter, there's not even an attempt to make a movie that might stand up to the original (which, while completely unnecessary, was at least one of the more watchable Hollywood remakes of foreign horror films in recent memory); there are no characters in this script who even manage two-dimensionality, much less three. There is little attempt to build suspense (I get the feeling Pogue's idea of building suspense is the flinging of red herrings at you in the beginning as you try to figure out, if you actually care, which of the sick people boarding the plane has the virus and which just have colds), and once all hell breaks loose, the script doesn't even really try to make the infected into jump-enablers. And, of course, every major ""twist"" during the last half-hour is predictable pretty much from the beginning of the film.On second thought, you can use this (just as in the literary world you can use Jodi Picoult's awful novel &lt;em>My Sister's Keeper&lt;/em>) as an acid test for movie compatibility with acquaintances: if anyone didn't see the identity of the final girl, the identity of the virus carrier, etc. coming before its revelation, this is not someone you have movie acumen in common with. **",2,Cold-eyed money grab that offers nothing new.,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,2986,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Quarantine', '2', 'Terminal', 'lt', '>', 'John', 'Pogue', '2011', 'What', 'was', 'exactly', 'told', 'watching', 'lt', '>', 'Quarantine', '2', 'Terminal', 'lt', '>', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'possible', 'way', 'What', 'kept', 'watching', 'when', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'remake', 'Paco', 'Plaza', 'sequel', 'original', 'film', 'lt', '>', '[', 'REC', ']', '2', 'lt', '>', 'Which', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'certainly', 'better', 'Let', 'see', 'have', 'first-time', 'director', 'who', 'best-known', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'forgettable', 'teen', 'thriller', 'lt', '>', 'Skulls', 'lt', '>', 'decade', 'ago', 'none', 'original', 'cast', 'returning', 'be', 'fair', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'kind', 'difficult', 'Plaza', 'pulled', 'off', 'however', 'script', 'okay', 'yes', 'really', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'lt', '>', 'Outbreak', 'Plane', 'lt', '>', 'movie', 'already', 'subtitle', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'fazed', 'anyone', 'involved', 'production', 'one', 'bit', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'Marcus', 'Koch', 'responsible', 'execrable', 'lt', '100', 'Tears', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'was', 'involved', 'effects', 'crew', 'time', 'got', 'end', 'credits', 'was', 'stunned', 'stunned', 'tell', 'not', 'see', 'Brain', 'Damage', 'Films', 'listed', 'production', 'credit', 'monstrosity', 'right', 'up', 'alley.Plot', 'virus', 'original', 'lt', '>', 'Quarantine', 'lt', '>', 'way', 'plane', 'emergency', 'landing', 'survivors', 'helpful', 'airport', 'employee', 'find', 'quarantined', 'abandoned', 'airport', 'terminal', ""'d"", 'tell', 'more', 'said', 'survivors', 'really', 'matter', ""'re"", 'entirely', 'interchangeable', 'thin', 'stereotypes', 'know', 'are', 'destined', 'get', 'killed', 'ever-increasing', 'number', 'infected.Yep', 'attempt', 'do', 'anything', 'extend', 'idea', 'way', 'matter', 'not', 'even', 'attempt', 'make', 'movie', 'might', 'stand', 'up', 'original', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'watchable', 'Hollywood', 'remakes', 'foreign', 'horror', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'are', 'characters', 'script', 'who', 'even', 'manage', 'two-dimensionality', 'much', 'less', 'three', 'little', 'attempt', 'build', 'suspense', 'get', 'feeling', 'Pogue', 'idea', 'building', 'suspense', 'flinging', 'red', 'herrings', 'beginning', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'actually', 'care', 'sick', 'people', 'boarding', 'plane', 'virus', 'just', 'have', 'colds', 'once', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'script', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'try', 'make', 'infected', 'jump-enablers', 'course', 'major', 'twist', 'last', 'half-hour', 'predictable', 'pretty', 'much', 'beginning', 'film.On', 'second', 'thought', 'can', 'use', 'just', 'literary', 'world', 'can', 'use', 'Jodi', 'Picoult', 'awful', 'novel', 'lt', '>', 'My', 'Sister', 'Keeper', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'acid', 'test', 'movie', 'compatibility', 'acquaintances', 'anyone', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'identity', 'final', 'girl', 'identity', 'virus', 'carrier', 'etc', 'coming', 'revelation', 'not', 'someone', 'have', 'movie', 'acumen', 'common', '**']",Quarantine 2: Terminal

And surprise surprise, the sequel is very, very good!  The movie does away with the hand-held camp POV of the first film, and I'm not sorry to see that go. The urgency of the hand-held video is replaced in the sequel with the dread and apprehension all travelers have of airports, airplane emegencies and Homeland Security.The plot: One of the passengers on a red-eye flight from L.A. to Kansas City is bitten by an infected hamster/rat and he goes berserk. The plane is ordered to land in Vegas, and it docks at a terminal where the passengers and crew are isolated. They ae not allowed to leave, and the power is cut off. That's when the terror cranks up. The zombies of the Quarantine series are infected live humans -- fast-moving rabid lunatics who want to bite a chunk out of your flesh, similar to the zombies of 28 Days Later or Zombietown.  They're the most logical zombies of all, and my personal favorite.One quibble:  The movie falls into Hollywood's easy racism.  A black guy is bitten early on.  The other passengers find him face down in a causeway and don't even turn him over before pronouncing ""he's dead"" and running away.  Needless to say, more care is taken with the white characters who get bitten.  It's like the producers included the black guy because they felt they had to have a black character, but wanted nothing to do with him. I actually empathized with the guy because he ws so focused on saving his computer presentation -- I've been there.  Dude needs to learn to carry his Powerpoint on a thumb drive.My favorite part: One actor injects himself in his eye. EEKS! It actually looked real, though I assume there's some Hollywood magic involved.Anyway, I give Quarantine 2 a big thumbs up and 4 1/2 stars.

The movie starts building the characters of 2 stewardesses. Then as they help and greet passengers we get a glimpse of the passenger backgrounds.

The cat had left the building which she claims is very unusual. There is a man with some hamsters. Another man helps him with the hamsters and gets bit. There is an elderly man who is sick along with his wife, and a woman who has just returned from overseas, and a few others. A man is watching the events unfold from outside the apartment building from the first picture on his laptop. This one picks up where the other leaves off except the action is in an airplane.Once a passenger gets infected and isolated in the restroom, the plane is told to land. It hooks up to a terminal where they are quarantined. Now it is just a matter of who lives and who dies.The first thing I noticed is they got rid of the hand held camera nonsense and had enough money to make this into a regular movie.

1436536,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0051GLDQS,trebe,"[1, 1]","In Quarantine 2: Terminal (2011), a passenger on a flight from Los Angeles becomes sick and turns violent, forcing the plane to land in Las Vegas, where a disease that turns people into flesh eaters, soon begins to spread.  Unfortunately, while the movie gets off to a decent start, it then takes some whacky turns, and by the end becomes pretty much a mess.  Some spoilers follow.In the filmQuarantine(2008), the authorities locked down an apartment building, in an attempt to contain a viral outbreak with rabies like symptoms, that turns people into bloodthirsty freaks.  In the sequel Quarantine 2: Terminal, someone from that same building is on the flight, carrying a source of the disease, which quickly spreads from one passenger to others once the plane lands.  Already briefed about the danger, the authorities in Vegas lock down the neatly deserted terminal.With most of the crew either dead or incapacitated, Jenny (Mercedes Masohn) a flight attendant, attempts to take charge of the group, which includes baggage handler Ed Ramirez (Ignacio Serricchio), and passengers Shilah (Noree Victoria), Henry (Josh Cooke), and George (Mattie Liptak) a young boy.  Men dressed in biosuits enter the hangar, and inject something into some of the survivors, but the ""cure"" fails, and the team and some of the survivors are killed.  Ramirez conveniently remembers about an abandoned tunnel, and what's left of the group attempts to evade the infected and find a way out.Writer/director John Pogue (U.S. Marshals,Ghost Ship) has done some decent work in the past, but after a nice start, Quarantine 2 becomes formulaic and just not very good.  The group are mostly stock characters, annoying and not particularly intelligent.  It's clear that many of them will not last long, and by the time the group finally has a plan of action, most of them have already become infected.There are several attack scenes, but few are executed very well, as there seems to be a lot of grappling, and quick cutting to speed things up.  The group does manage a few good kills, including a creative chase on a baggage conveyor, and a group strangulation using a cable.The film has a deadly serious tone, but the ridiculous plot and brain dead characters, makes it hard to take seriously, once things start to get nasty.  The story also contains mad scientist and conspiracy elements, as the character responsible for the outbreak, is also involved in developing the virus, and testing it on humans.  In a horror movie with mostly adults, it's usually not a good sign when a smartass kid is the most intelligent character.  Things really get stupid when thermal vision goggles are used to provide advance warning of the presence of the infected.  It's completely ridiculous, when characters are apparently unable to see, yet are clearly visible on the screen.  And the movie's final scenes in a tunnel, are pathetically bad.Taken by itself, Quarantine 2 is subpar unoriginal outbreak flick, that is much less entertaining than the filmFlight of the Living Dead(2007), which granted has a different approach.  Compared to Quarantine, which featured a live video approach, Quarantine 2 is an inferior disappointment, which is almost humorously bad at times.Quarantine was a virtual remake of the Spanish horror film[Rec](2007), a movie with genuinely creative writers who expanded their ideas in their sequel[Rec] 2(2009).  A comparison between Quarantine 2 and [REC] 2 isn't fair or perhaps relevant, but it is interesting to note that while [REC] 2 explores new ground, and again is creatively shot in the live video style, the lower budget Quarantine 2 recycles the same old zombie movie clich&eacute;s, offering nothing new, and featuring a kid a major player.  While below average, if you just can't get your fill of zombie types, you might give Q2 a watch.
