454268,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6305198861,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","The sequel to ""Air Bud"", ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver"", the family film that won hearts in 1998 and was released on DVD back in 2000 makes its return to DVD with a special edition release in 2010.With the success of the first film in the box office (making $24 million), ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver"" was the second of five ""Air Bud"" films which would then spin-off to the current ""Buddies"" films (four total as of now) featuring the children of the original Air Bud.The film continues where the last film left off.  In the last film, Josh discovers his golden retriever, Bud has the talent of playing basketball and eventually helps him Josh and his team win a championship.  This time around,  Josh Framm (played by Kevin Zegers, ""Gossip Girl"", ""Transamerica"") and his friend Tom (played by Shayn Solberg, ""Eureka"", ""Agent Cody Banks"") talk about football and how Tom wants both of them to play for the team in order to catch the interest of the girls in school.  But Josh is not too sure he wants to play because his sport is basketball.When he takes Bud for his yearly exam at the vet, they discover that their vet is out on sabbatical and taking his place is Patrick Sulllivan (played by Gregory Harrison, ""North Shore"", ""Falcon Crest"", ""Reunion"") and everything seems to check out fine. Meanwhile, two animal thieves from Russia - Natalya (played by Nora Dunn, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Entourage"") and Popov (played by Perry Anzilotti, ""ER"") see a video of Bud playing basketball and now have their eyes set on stealing him.Meanwhile, when Josh returns home one day, he notices guys are calling home and learns that his mother Jackie (played by Cynthia Stevenson, ""Surviving, Suburbia"", ""Men in Trees"", ""According to Jim"") is being asked out to go on dates.  He pretends he doesn't care but deep inside it bothers him.  Each time a guy comes to the house to date his mother, Josh ends up scaring them.  One day, while Josh's mother is rollerblading with Buddy, Buddy pulls her towards the wharf and she accidentally falls on top of the new vet, Patrick.  And not long after, the two start dating and get closer with one another.With Josh still hurting since his father's death and not sure if he's ready for his mother to date, let alone seeing Patrick at their house constantly, Josh decides to join the Timberwolves Jr. high football team.  Hoping to not see Patrick and avoid getting caught up with his mother's relationship. Josh knows nothing about football but after showing Coach Fanelli (played by Robert Costanzo, ""Hill Street Blues"", ""The White Shadow"", ""Joe & Valerie"") his throw, Fanelli makes him the backup quarterback.While practicing his throws at the park, Josh notices that his dog Bud has an interest with the football.  When he throws it, Bud catches it and realizes that Bud has the talent to catch footballs.  Long passes, short passes...he can do it.As Josh goes to meet with his coach, he hears the principal and coach talk about the future of the team.  Because the team has had a decade of losing seasons, the board wants to see an improvement of the team and if it doesn't happen, the coach will lose his job.  While at his first game, the star quarterback for the Timberwolves goes down with an injury and now Josh must become the team's quarterback.With him worry about his mother dating a new man, his coach's future depends on the team winning and now having to be the quarterback of the football team, it may be a bit too much for Josh.  But when Bud joins the football team and leads them to a win, perhaps Josh and Bud can inspire the team to play better football and become champions.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Air Bud: Golden Receiver - Special Edition"" is featured in widescreen (1:85:1) - enhanced for 169 televisions.  For a 1998 film, the picture quality is pretty good. I don't recall seeing any aging, excessive grain or any video fragmenting. Overall, for a film that is 12-years-old, picture quality still remains pretty good for DVD.As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound with a Spanish language track.  For the most part, ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver"" is a center and front channel driven film.  Dialogue is clear and understandable as well as the film's music soundtrack.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:The main special feature on the DVD is ""The Buddie's Sports Channel"" (6:05) featuring the puppies in the recent Buddies films featuring Bud-dha B-Dawg, Mudbud, Budderball and Rosebud as they give a play-by-play commentary of their father, Bud's football scenes.Also, included with this DVD is an ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver"" whistle and necklace.  The whistle is pretty cool looking as the metal cylindrical whistle matches the metallic bronze slipcase that the DVD comes with.JUDGMENT CALL:With the popularity of the buddies films and the ten year anniversary of ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver"", it's great to see a special edition of the DVD come out especially before the upcoming Super Bowl.  Where the first film focuses on a child who lost his father and bonds with his new dog, this second film focuses on Josh getting used to his mother who has now moved forward in dating other people and Josh having to get used to it.  So, you still have the emotional bond between mother and son and most importantly, Josh and his dog Buddy.If you watched ""Air Bud"", you know what to expect from ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver"" but this time the sport is football.  The DVD comes with the buddies special feature which is nothing much but just an added feature for your children who love the buddies.  And as mentioned, the special edition comes with a whistle, which is very loud.  So, parents...a little precaution if your child plans to go crazy with it.Overall, ""AIR BUD"" is a fun film for the whole family. Parents do not have to worry about their children being scared.  This sequel focuses more on Josh and his relationship with his family and playing football and less on the thieves going after Bud (unlike the first film which featured the original owner wanting his dog back).  I watched ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver"" along with my six-year-old and he enjoyed it.So, if your child/children has enjoyed the last ""Air Bud"" film or enjoys any of the ""Buddies"" films, definitely pick up ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver - Special Edition"".",4,"The ""Air Bud"" sequel receives its ten year re-release!

His mom and the new vet hit it off and he gives Josh a football.  Josh seems insulted but Buddy wants to play.Things change when Josh discovers Buddy can catch footballs.  Then he decides to go out for football as revenge against his mom's new guy.  But it would not be an Air Bud movie is someone wasn't trying to get a hold of Buddy.  This time it is a comic pair of Russians (looking like Boris and Natasha) who are stealing animals to put together a circus.In the end this one works better than the other sequels.  Unlike World Pup or Seventh Inning Fetch, we don't have the parents attending a game while being unconcerned about their missing children.  This time the game goes on and only Buddy is missing.  Also unlike the other movies, the rescue is not made by one of the kids.All in all this is a fun movie, which like the first, actually deals with some touching issues as Josh has to come to terms with his mother's decisions.

His mom, named Jackie (Cynthia Stevenson) is taking him and his kid sister to the basketball finals.Buddy wants to come too. But Josh doesn't let him. So Buddy sneaks into the family van. He's just a dog, he doesn't understand people.And Buddy shows up on the basketball court and makes a basket. What I didn't mention in the review of Air Bud, is that Josh's father, a test pilot was killed in a plane crash.School is starting soon for Josh. And I think he is entering high school. Josh's mother starts dating again. And soon her new love is the local veterinarian, named Patrick Sullivan (Gregory Harrison). Josh doesn't like this. So he tries out of the school's football team.And makes the team. On the day of the first game, the coach named Fanelli (Robert Costanzo) is told that either the football team will be dropped, or he will be fired if the team doesn't have a winning season.Fanelli was the school's coach for 14 years. And hasn't had a winning season in 10 years. Buddy the dog who made lots of baskets in the first movie, died after the movie wrapped up. And so the studio got another dog that looks like the first dog.
