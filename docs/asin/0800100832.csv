This movie shows a clear depiction of the soldiers at Pearl Harbor before it was bombed.  The book is a totally long, obnoxious book, towards the end I only read the quotations.

160218,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,0800100832,A Customer,"[7, 15]","Undoubtedly considered a classic, this movie won 8 Oscars in 1953, including best film.  I enjoyed it, but it isn't a movie that I think I would want to own.Summary:This movie is actually a little difficult to summarize because it follows two stories.  Though the focus is on Private Prewitt (Montgomery Clift), it also follows stories in the lives of his friend Maggio (Frank Sinatra) and Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster), one of his commanding officers.The movie takes place in Hawaii just prior to and including the attack at Pearl Harbor.  The basic idea is that Private Prewitt has an iron will and refuses to be broken by his captain, Captain Holmes (Philip Ober), who wants him to box for his company even though Prewitt has given it up after having blinded a sparring partner.  I never really understood why Prewitt switched into G Company from the bugle corps, but he does and that is where the movie starts.  Prewitt makes friends with Maggio, another private, but is constantly ridden by the other boxers in the company who are all sergeants because they box and want him to help their team win a tournament.  Though he never really cracks from their 'Treatment', he does break down at one point and box with one of the other boxers in the company, showing that he can hold his own.Prewitt's contribution to the movie is his love affair with an escort, Lorene (Donna Reed).  Being the hard-nosed soldier he is, we explore his relationship as he falls in love but eventually leaves Lorene - against her wishes - to return to his company on the night of December 7, 1941.  On his way he is mistaken for an intruder and shot (he had been AWOL for several days after being wounded in a knife fight in which one of the movie's antagonists was killed to avenge the death of his friend Maggio).The other love story plays out between Sergeant Warden and Karen Holmes (Deborah Kerr) who is the wife of Sergeant Warden's company commander, Captain Holmes.  Captain Holmes has been cheating on his wife since almost the beginning of their marriage and his cheating and drunkenness eventually led her to lose her child and her ability to have more children.  She never forgave him (not that I blame her) and has since had numerous affairs with other men.  Sergeant Warden falls for her and they have an affair, but in the end he is unwilling to try for a promotion to an officer which is what she wants (symbolic of his love for the military I guess), so their love affair ends.  Also, Captain Holmes is eventually forced to resign for his poor command of his company and it seems implied that Captain Holmes and Karen get a divorce, but we are unsure.The final scene is Karen Holmes and Lorene sailing away from Hawaii.  They just happen to be next to each other on the boat and the strike up a conversation.  But of them are leaving their loves in Hawaii, likely never to return.My Comments:I'm not sure I like the format of the movie in that it doesn't really follow one character but instead follows two love stories.  But, that is kind of a minor point.  I did like the fact that the 'good guys', Maggio and Prewitt, both end up dying and the love affairs don't work out.  You don't usually find that in movies.  It is an interesting twist to a love story that makes the story more believable because it isn't a fairy tale.The storyline isn't entirely perfect.  Maggio's drunken rage seems to come from nowhere and, at best, is poorly set up.  Then, when he escapes and dies afterward you are left thinking how bizarre the whole situation is.  Sinatra was good in the role, he just didn't have much help from the story line.Also, Burt Lancaster seemed like a carryover from an earlier era when men were supposed to be 'men'.  Everything he did he did as though he were a hero poised to fight or come save the day (this is especially apparent in the 'famous' beach love scene).  I liked that we explored his relationship and that he didn't always have the answers, but there is just something about his portrayal of the role that makes you think he is an actor trying to act rather than a soldier.And then there's Donna Reed.  I wasn't convinced by her role.  Maybe the intent was to show that she was kind of a good girl that just wanted money, but when she breaks out into her spiel about being 'proper', I can't help but think that someone was trying to make a point.  She was my least favorite of all of the characters.Overall, the movie was entertaining, though slow at times.  The story didn't make perfect sense, but life rarely does, so why should the story be any different.  Some of the acting was forced, but overall it was pretty good.  Montgomery Clift was particularly good in his role.  If you enjoy classic films, you would probably enjoy this one.",3,"A classic, yes, but with holes and a bit slow",1043452800,"01 25, 2003",2003,4767,"['Undoubtedly', 'considered', 'classic', 'movie', 'won', '8', 'Oscars', '1953', 'including', 'best', 'film', 'enjoyed', ""n't"", 'movie', 'think', 'would', 'want', 'own.Summary', 'movie', 'actually', 'little', 'difficult', 'summarize', 'two', 'stories', 'focus', 'Private', 'Prewitt', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'also', 'stories', 'lives', 'friend', 'Maggio', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Sergeant', 'Warden', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'one', 'commanding', 'officers.The', 'movie', 'place', 'Hawaii', 'just', 'prior', 'including', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'basic', 'idea', 'Private', 'Prewitt', 'iron', 'will', 'refuses', 'be', 'broken', 'captain', 'Captain', 'Holmes', 'Philip', 'Ober', 'who', 'box', 'company', 'even', 'Prewitt', 'given', 'up', 'having', 'blinded', 'sparring', 'partner', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'why', 'Prewitt', 'switched', 'G', 'Company', 'bugle', 'corps', 'where', 'movie', 'Prewitt', 'friends', 'Maggio', 'private', 'constantly', 'ridden', 'other', 'boxers', 'company', 'who', 'are', 'sergeants', 'box', 'want', 'help', 'team', 'win', 'tournament', 'never', 'really', 'cracks', ""'Treatment"", 'break', 'down', 'one', 'point', 'box', 'one', 'other', 'boxers', 'company', 'showing', 'can', 'hold', 'own.Prewitt', 'contribution', 'movie', 'love', 'affair', 'escort', 'Lorene', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Being', 'hard-nosed', 'soldier', 'explore', 'relationship', 'love', 'eventually', 'Lorene', 'wishes', 'return', 'company', 'night', 'December', '7', '1941', 'way', 'mistaken', 'intruder', 'shot', 'had', 'been', 'AWOL', 'several', 'days', 'being', 'wounded', 'knife', 'fight', 'one', 'movie', 'antagonists', 'was', 'killed', 'avenge', 'death', 'friend', 'Maggio', 'other', 'story', 'out', 'Sergeant', 'Warden', 'Karen', 'Holmes', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'who', 'wife', 'Sergeant', 'Warden', 'company', 'commander', 'Captain', 'Holmes', 'Captain', 'Holmes', 'been', 'cheating', 'wife', 'almost', 'beginning', 'marriage', 'cheating', 'drunkenness', 'eventually', 'led', 'lose', 'child', 'ability', 'have', 'more', 'children', 'never', 'forgave', 'not', 'blame', 'had', 'numerous', 'affairs', 'other', 'men', 'Sergeant', 'Warden', 'have', 'affair', 'end', 'unwilling', 'try', 'promotion', 'officer', 'what', 'symbolic', 'love', 'military', 'guess', 'so', 'love', 'affair', 'Also', 'Captain', 'Holmes', 'eventually', 'forced', 'resign', 'poor', 'command', 'company', 'implied', 'Captain', 'Holmes', 'Karen', 'get', 'divorce', 'are', 'unsure.The', 'final', 'scene', 'Karen', 'Holmes', 'Lorene', 'sailing', 'away', 'Hawaii', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'next', 'other', 'boat', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'are', 'leaving', 'loves', 'Hawaii', 'likely', 'never', 'return.My', 'Comments', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'like', 'format', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'one', 'character', 'instead', 'two', 'love', 'stories', 'kind', 'minor', 'point', 'did', 'fact', ""'good"", 'guys', 'Maggio', 'Prewitt', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'love', 'affairs', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'find', 'movies', 'interesting', 'twist', 'love', 'story', 'story', 'more', 'believable', ""n't"", 'fairy', 'tale.The', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'perfect', 'Maggio', 'drunken', 'rage', 'come', 'nowhere', 'best', 'poorly', 'set', 'up', 'Then', 'when', 'are', 'left', 'thinking', 'how', 'bizarre', 'whole', 'situation', 'Sinatra', 'was', 'good', 'role', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'help', 'story', 'line.Also', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'seemed', 'carryover', 'earlier', 'era', 'when', 'men', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', ""'men"", 'Everything', 'did', 'did', 'were', 'hero', 'poised', 'fight', 'come', 'save', 'day', 'especially', 'apparent', ""'famous"", 'beach', 'scene', 'liked', 'explored', 'relationship', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'answers', 'just', 'something', 'portrayal', 'role', 'think', 'actor', 'trying', 'act', 'rather', 'soldier.And', 'then', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'role', 'Maybe', 'intent', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'kind', 'good', 'girl', 'just', 'wanted', 'money', 'when', 'out', 'spiel', 'being', ""'proper"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'someone', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'characters.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'though', 'slow', 'times', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'life', 'rarely', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'story', 'be', 'different', 'acting', 'was', 'forced', 'overall', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'was', 'particularly', 'good', 'role', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'films', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one']",N/A
160219,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0800100832,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","The film opens at the Schofield Barracks in 1941 Hawaii. Prewitt transferred from Fort Shafter to this rifle company; why? We learn about his past, the new outfit, and what is expected. The captain has a domestic problem, and awaits a promotion. The boxers in this outfit are all non-coms. Prewitt is given extra drill to change his mind about boxing. Sgt. Warden is advised to have some fun by his captain, and this leads to an adventure. On payday the soldiers engage in gambling; easy come, easy go. The film shows pre-war Hawaii. There is a private club with hostesses who dance with gentlemen. Some of the hostesses can take a gentleman into the parlor - to talk. [The scene at the beach seems false, as if the censors were active.]Prewitt's lack of co-operation leads to added punishment. But he shows he can blow a bugle. Sgt. Jordan picks a fight with Maggio, Sgt. Warden stops it. Maggio makes a big mistake in walking away from guard duty. He is court-martialed and sent to the stockade. Sgt. Warden meets with Captain Holmes' wife in secret. They make plans for the future. So does Prewitt and Alma. Prewitt is pushed once too far, and a fight occurs. We see more about the personalities of the people. Prewitt sadly gets to play 'Taps'. Later Prewitt meets with Sgt. Jordan for a final goodbye. Captain Holmes' conduct is recognized. A new Captain Ross makes changes. Sgt. Warden's affair with Karen ends after these changes.Then December 7 arrives on a Sunday morning. There is a surprise and things change. America will never be the same again. Sgt. Warden takes command and orders a defense of the barracks. Prewitt ties to return to the Army, but is mistaken for a saboteur. This is a tragic ending, a warning about anyone who bucks the system. This is a good story but it was simplified from the novel. They toned down the raw language and situations. Wasn't Hawaii regarded as a great posting? There is a warning at the end. If a person ever tells you a sad story to gain your sympathy it is very likely to be a confidence trick.",3,A View of the Peacetime Army,1193875200,"11 1, 2007",2007,2047,"['film', 'Schofield', 'Barracks', '1941', 'Hawaii', 'Prewitt', 'transferred', 'Fort', 'Shafter', 'rifle', 'company', 'why', 'learn', 'past', 'new', 'outfit', 'what', 'expected', 'captain', 'domestic', 'problem', 'promotion', 'boxers', 'outfit', 'are', 'non-coms', 'Prewitt', 'given', 'extra', 'drill', 'change', 'mind', 'boxing', 'Sgt', 'Warden', 'advised', 'have', 'fun', 'captain', 'adventure', 'soldiers', 'engage', 'gambling', 'easy', 'come', 'easy', 'go', 'film', 'pre-war', 'Hawaii', 'private', 'club', 'hostesses', 'who', 'dance', 'gentlemen', 'hostesses', 'can', 'take', 'gentleman', 'parlor', 'talk', '[', 'scene', 'beach', 'false', 'censors', 'were', 'active', ']', 'Prewitt', 'lack', 'co-operation', 'leads', 'added', 'punishment', 'can', 'blow', 'bugle', 'Sgt', 'Jordan', 'fight', 'Maggio', 'Sgt', 'Warden', 'Maggio', 'big', 'mistake', 'walking', 'away', 'guard', 'duty', 'court-martialed', 'sent', 'stockade', 'Sgt', 'Warden', 'meets', 'Captain', 'Holmes', 'wife', 'secret', 'make', 'plans', 'future', 'So', 'Prewitt', 'Alma', 'Prewitt', 'pushed', 'once', 'too', 'far', 'fight', 'see', 'more', 'personalities', 'people', 'Prewitt', 'sadly', 'play', ""'Taps"", 'Later', 'Prewitt', 'meets', 'Sgt', 'Jordan', 'final', 'goodbye', 'Captain', 'Holmes', 'conduct', 'recognized', 'new', 'Captain', 'Ross', 'changes', 'Sgt', 'Warden', 'affair', 'Karen', 'changes.Then', 'December', '7', 'arrives', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'surprise', 'things', 'change', 'America', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again', 'Sgt', 'Warden', 'command', 'orders', 'defense', 'barracks', 'Prewitt', 'return', 'Army', 'mistaken', 'saboteur', 'tragic', 'ending', 'warning', 'anyone', 'who', 'system', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'simplified', 'novel', 'toned', 'down', 'raw', 'language', 'situations', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Hawaii', 'regarded', 'great', 'posting', 'warning', 'end', 'person', 'ever', 'sad', 'story', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'very', 'likely', 'be', 'confidence', 'trick']",N/A

160221,AGEIT17HENDIS,0800100832,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","It is easy, easy as hell, to produce, and have commercial success, at a war epic based on shoot `em up, kill every enemy of the moment in sight, level every possible standing target, human or man-made, and still have time for lunch, romance and a couple of hands of gin rummy.  The Hollywood box office has thrived on such epic since from about day one. The hard part, the very hard part, is to show soldiers at peace, or at least the old-fashion peace before the world, and the American imperium above all, put us all on edge with the permanent war-footing. But that is what we get here just soldiers being dog soldiers in the barracks, and barrooms in the rightly-deserved classic film of the genre, From Here To Eternity.Oh sure, like any Hollywood picture (or now from other milieus) this one is filled with plenty of romance to keep up the romantic interests of the viewers (and that famous steamy ""sex"" scene before they had steamy sex scenes in Hollywood film, as least that I knew about, with Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr going through their paces on the foam-flecked Hawaiian beach above all. Some women of my mother's generation, the ones who mainly stayed at home and hoped their Johnnies and Jimmies would come can back in one piece during World War II, were, secretly, blushing at the thoughts evoked on that one.).But at its heart this film is really about the mundane, fearful, fearsome sometimes brutal, sometimes screwy life in the barracks. For guys, not me, but like my old time best friend, Peter Paul Markin, who I watched this one with, and who went into the ""service"" some of the scenes rang very true about the everyday side of Army life before the shooting starts.And, in the end, this is the beauty of the film adaptation of Jones' war saga, the vast bulk of the film is caught up with the savage rivalries, the petty routines, and the madnesses of the dog soldier, a man (mainly then) whose who life was set up in stone to be a soldier, a soldier waiting to fight. That is where the setting in idyllic Hawaii just before December 7, 1941 (Pearl Harbor, for the forgetful later generations) is pure inspiration. Hell, before that date this was gravy duty, as long as you kept your nose clean. There is the rub though. One Private Robert E. Prewitt (played by Montgomery Clift), a lifer-in-the making by choice, just doesn't know how to roll with the punches (no pun intended) when he refuses (with cause) not to be a part of the good old boy network of boxers who have life easy in the company he is newly assigned to. His struggles, including his romantic struggles (naturally) with one very fetching club ""hostess"", Lorene (played by Academy Award winner Donna Reed), his sense of honor, his sense of duty, his sense of taking care of his buddy (especially one Maggio, played by Academy Award Frank Sinatra), and his sense of revenge for an injustice are what drive the film. And all to the tune of the bluesy ""Reenlistment Blues"" as background music.Of course an army is not made up of a single soldier, or his righteous struggles, so when we are not riveted to Clift and Reed our eyes are fixed on old dog soldier ""Top,"" Sergeant Waldron (played by rugged Burt Lancaster) and his very efficient operation keeping his unit in good running order despite his commanding officer (a common plight of senior NCOs, according to old time stories that I have heard). Oh yes, just as a refresher, and trying keep his hands off (or is it on) that same commanding officer's wife (Ms. Kerr). So if you want blood and guts war go see a film like D-Day, Platoon, or Private Ryan.

160223,A2EL3990HXOMZB,0800100832,Antonio Robert,"[0, 0]","Sweeping Oscars in 1953, this war drama becomes truly war at the very end, when the two main characters - brave soldiers played by Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift - are along with their female darlings caught in the fire of 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first US movies to deal with this blow dealt by Japan, ""From Here to Eternity"" nevertheless pushed forward the boundaries for various topics in film, having come not ahead of its time, but right at the nick of it. Frankness in intimate relationships, violence and army abuse are tackled with realism unheard-of before. The film has somehow got dated with time, but it still is carried on broad shoulders of Burt Lancaster, whose steaming beach encounter with Deborah Kerr (wife of his superior) remains among the most memorable love scenes ever put on the screen. Another main character, Robert E.Lee Prewitt (then bright young star Clift), is the centerpiece of the story. The talented boxer and bugle-man, who nevertheless has his own code of conduct, becomes an outcast of the army machinery despite his very desirable soldier qualities. The role of his friend Maggio brought a Best Supporting Oscar to Frank Sinatra, who allegedly got the role thanks to his underworld connections. Donna Reed (It's A Wonderful Life) won her Oscar for supporting actress as Prewitt's flame Alma, a luxurious prostitute whose only dream is to return home with the money and live a ""decent"" life. The film also got six more Academy Awards (total eight of 13 noms), including Best Picture and Best Director for Fred Zinnemann (High Noon, A Man for All Seasons).",4,Pearl Harbor Background for Human Destinies,1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,1613,"['Sweeping', 'Oscars', '1953', 'war', 'drama', 'truly', 'war', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'brave', 'soldiers', 'played', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'are', 'female', 'darlings', 'caught', 'fire', '1941', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'One', 'first', 'US', 'movies', 'deal', 'blow', 'dealt', 'Japan', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'nevertheless', 'pushed', 'forward', 'boundaries', 'various', 'topics', 'film', 'having', 'come', 'not', 'ahead', 'time', 'right', 'nick', 'Frankness', 'intimate', 'relationships', 'violence', 'army', 'abuse', 'are', 'tackled', 'realism', 'unheard-of', 'before', 'film', 'somehow', 'got', 'dated', 'time', 'still', 'carried', 'broad', 'shoulders', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'steaming', 'beach', 'encounter', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'wife', 'superior', 'most', 'memorable', 'love', 'scenes', 'ever', 'put', 'screen', 'main', 'character', 'Robert', 'E.Lee', 'Prewitt', 'then', 'bright', 'young', 'star', 'Clift', 'centerpiece', 'story', 'talented', 'boxer', 'bugle-man', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'own', 'code', 'conduct', 'outcast', 'army', 'machinery', 'very', 'desirable', 'soldier', 'qualities', 'role', 'friend', 'Maggio', 'brought', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Oscar', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'who', 'allegedly', 'got', 'role', 'thanks', 'underworld', 'connections', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'won', 'Oscar', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Prewitt', 'flame', 'Alma', 'luxurious', 'prostitute', 'only', 'dream', 'return', 'home', 'money', 'live', 'decent', 'life', 'film', 'also', 'got', 'six', 'more', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'total', 'eight', '13', 'noms', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'High', 'Noon', 'A', 'Man', 'All', 'Seasons']",N/A

I call From Here to Eternity a film from pre-Marlon Brando era. The outstanding performances by Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift are witnessed in From Here to Eternity, but Frank Sinatra doesn't merit any worthy commendation as he is much better in The Manchurian Candidate. There are too many shortcomings in the subplots and not enough development in the affair between the characters of Burt Lancaster and Donna Reed. I find Montgomery Clift's character a sucker of too much screen time while Frank Sinatra's dilemma is rather primitive in terms of understanding him. The famous scene where Burt Lancaster and Donna Reed embrace themselves on the beach with the waves engulfing upon them is a memorable one. Another thing that I like about the film is while the conflicts are ongoing, a bigger conflict, namely the Japanese's surprise attack, overshadows all the trivial matters, stopping the pulse of the normal daily lives. I can see largely that Pearl Harbor stole everything that embodies what From Here to Eternity is all about. Again, From Here to Eternity is a disappointing picture with two fine performances from Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift.2/14: The spume...Burt Lancaster...Deborah Kerr...on the beach...from here to eternity is their immortality. It's among the fewest greatest scenes of all films that will forever stand the test of time. Also, it's the main reason why From Here to Eternity is revisited a countless of times. Included are the wonderful performances by Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, and Donna Reed. My opinion of Sinatra's performance has been greatly improved now. He is pretty good as the affable Maggio with remarkable acting skills. Honestly, for the award, he deserves it more for what he did in The Man With the Golden Arm and The Manchurian Candidate. However, Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift give him a run for his money. Of the two, I am undecided of who is actually the better performer. It's so close. What I love is the ominous placement of the pullout of day-today calendar after the announcement of Galovitch's demotion with another one a bit latter signaling Pearl Harbor being seven miles away. Obviously, I don't have to tell you what that means because that's the basis of the film's ending, to wash away everything that has occurred up to that point. Now, I am not so sure if From Here to Eternity is really a `10'. There is something about Fred Zinnemann's direction that isn't quite there much like what I see in High Noon. Don't get me wrong, both are great films, but neither has that certain specialness to get over the hump. At least, my rating of the film is improved from `6' to `9'. So, that being said, I don't mind seeing it again and again in the future. All in all, From Here to Eternity has great acting performances and, more importantly, the famous beach scene that will forever remain timeless.",5,Burt Lancaster...Deborah Kerr...From Here to Eternity.,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,3021,"['Viewed', '2/06', '2/14Rate', '92/06', 'am', 'just', 'disappointed', 'because', 'prior', 'seeing', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'call', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'film', 'pre-Marlon', 'Brando', 'era', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'are', 'witnessed', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', ""n't"", 'merit', 'worthy', 'commendation', 'much', 'better', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'subplots', 'not', 'enough', 'development', 'affair', 'characters', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'find', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'character', 'sucker', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'dilemma', 'rather', 'primitive', 'terms', 'understanding', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'embrace', 'beach', 'waves', 'engulfing', 'memorable', 'one', 'thing', 'like', 'film', 'conflicts', 'are', 'ongoing', 'bigger', 'conflict', 'namely', 'Japanese', 'surprise', 'attack', 'trivial', 'matters', 'stopping', 'pulse', 'normal', 'daily', 'lives', 'can', 'see', 'largely', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'stole', 'everything', 'what', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'about', 'Again', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'disappointing', 'picture', 'two', 'fine', 'performances', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Montgomery', 'Clift.2/14', 'spume', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'beach', 'here', 'eternity', 'immortality', 'fewest', 'greatest', 'scenes', 'films', 'will', 'forever', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'Also', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'revisited', 'countless', 'times', 'Included', 'are', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'opinion', 'Sinatra', 'performance', 'been', 'greatly', 'improved', 'now', 'pretty', 'good', 'affable', 'Maggio', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'skills', 'Honestly', 'award', 'more', 'what', 'did', 'Man', 'Golden', 'Arm', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'However', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'give', 'run', 'money', 'two', 'am', 'undecided', 'who', 'actually', 'better', 'performer', 'so', 'close', 'What', 'love', 'ominous', 'placement', 'pullout', 'day-today', 'calendar', 'announcement', 'Galovitch', 'demotion', 'one', 'bit', 'latter', 'signaling', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'being', 'seven', 'miles', 'away', 'Obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'tell', 'what', 'basis', 'film', 'ending', 'wash', 'away', 'everything', 'occurred', 'up', 'point', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'really', '10', 'something', 'about', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'direction', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'High', 'Noon', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'great', 'films', 'certain', 'specialness', 'get', 'hump', 'least', 'rating', 'film', 'improved', '6', '9', 'So', 'being', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'again', 'again', 'future', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'great', 'acting', 'performances', 'more', 'importantly', 'famous', 'beach', 'scene', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'timeless']",N/A

You know, the ones that boiled four or five books down into one cheap binding you can find for next to nothing at the thrift stores. One of them was this book, and I read it because I read just about everything. The romance part came through, but not much of the military part. Except that it was lousy being a soldier and having power-happy officers over you.Not much more comes through in this movie, but it does it with an all-star cast. The scene is Pearl Harbor in the fall of 1941.Montgomery Clift plays Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt, who was transferred to this base because he won fights in the boxing matches, and Captain Holmes wants to win this year. But Prewitt doesn't want to fight. He accidentally blinded a sparring partner and refused to fight again. As a result, he is hounded and harassed by the boxing team.Burt Lancaster plays Sgt. Milton Warden, who takes care of everything for the Captain including, eventually, the captain's wife.Deborah Kerr is Karen Holmes, the captain's wife. She's the one in the famous scene about rolling around on the beach at Pearl Harbor shortly before it was bombed. [The cover of the DVD employs poetic license: they were not rolling around on the beach when the planes came over.]Frank Sinatra is Pvt. Angelo Maggio, Prewitt's best buddy.Donna Reed is Alma ""Lorene"" Burke, who works at a club that in this day and age would be understood to be a whorehouse, but which avoids the suggestion pretty successfully in this film. She dances with the soldiers, talks with them, flirts with them and the club somehow makes money. They don't even serve drinks. She falls in love with Prewitt.Ernest Borgnine is Sgt. Fatso Judson, who is in charge of the brig (? the lock-up), and is cruel, arrogant and stupid.So I guess you'd call it an all-star movie, but the plot does not have much depth. After all, we all know what's going to happen in December, even if the soldiers don't.

Chandler ""baseball doctor""","[2, 2]",".....I know my review will be in the minority but I think this is an overrated movie more famous as the ""movie"" that saved Frank Sinatra's career than for it's dramatic content......The only acting performances that deserved to be praised were turned in by Burt Lancaster and Debra Kerr but in typical perverse Hollywood tradition Sinatra and Reed walked away with Oscars......This was Sinatra's first big dramatic part and it showed.  Although, in time, he learned to act and to develop an on-screen personna, in this movie he was just plain awful, as bad as another non-actor, Elvis Presely was in his first movie Love Me Tender.  Sinatra got the part due to the clout of his paramour Ava Gardner and was, at that time, at the nadir of his career, deserted by his fans for divorcing his childhood sweetheart for Gardner. Fans were still sensitive to such things in those days.  Hollywood, anxious to restore Sinatra to box office dynamite rewarded him with an Oscar for his deer-in-the-headlights on screen mugging......Donna Reed (Mary Bailey in Wonderful Life and star of the Donna Reed Show) sacrificed her good girl image to play a cynical hard bitten prostitute and was totally unbelievable in the part.  But Hollywod has a habit of giving Oscars to actresses who are willing to debase themselves with unsavory parts (Shirley Jones in Elmer Gantry) and so Reed joined the club......Montgomery Cliff, who always seemed to be a watered down version of Marlon Brando in his mumbling performances was suited for this role but was hard to believe as a boxing champion in the worn out theme of a boxer who quits the ring because he killed an opponent with his fists.  Cliff looked much too slight, more like a lightweight than a middleweight to have such a lethal punch.  John Wayne was much more believable in ""The Quiet Man"". Montgomery Cliffs popularity was hard to fathom because with the exception of this movie and his role with Elizabeth Taylor in ""A Place in the Sun"", he seemed miscast in most of his roles, especially with John Wayne in ""Red River"", a part that much more suited for Jack Beutel of ""Outlaw"" fame......Ernest Borgnine turned in a fine performance as the sadistic Stockade guard......This movie was not shown on Military Bases when it was released because the Military did not like to show how its disciplined structure could be corrupted and used to persecute men by their superior officers.  The theme was too close to the reality for the Brass......This is a good movie but not as great as its hype.

This is probably a shame, since it shows that we've been saturated with these things in the movies for most of our lives, but it is a fact nonetheless. ""From Here to Eternity"" is this type of film. The story is good, but it's just not that hard-hitting when the film is largely about vice and it's almost all inferred instead of shown. When someone is beaten or stabbed to death, they bleed. When someone is a prostitute they don't look like Donna Reed does in this film. When someone commits adultery, they don't smooch on the beach. It's another example of a film that was hard-hitting in its day, but for good or ill (probably for ill) has not stood the test of time. One interesting lesson that the film does teach that I have not seen elsewhere is the diffculty in assembling an army, which by definition is meant to kill people and break things, and then expecting the troops to play well together and get along until the fighting starts. The movie illustrates that well.

160236,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,0800100832,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[3, 5]","From Here to Eternity is the highly regarded and awarded film from 1953, that explores the lives of hard drinking Army men stationed at Pearl Harbor, who don't always play by the rules.  It's a film that is much more frank than most films of its era in its depictions of male camaraderie as well as romantic entanglements.  It's the film that features that passionate embrace of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr on the beach as the waves roll in.  It's the film that featured the Oscar winning dramatic performance of Frank Sinatra and it's the film that concluded with a dramatic recreation of the bombing of Peal Harbor, December 7th.When viewed today the film is dated in several ways.  Sinatra's performance seems somewhat forced (he was better in Man with A Golden Arm and Suddenly, for instance).  Some of the dialogue and situations drip with too much melodrama.  Over-all however the film works beautifully and remains a powerful and memorable film very much worth seeing.  It's also a very mature and adult film that features some still quite torrid romances involving an Army officer and a married woman.From Here to Eternity however is far less corny and a much better film than 2001's over-produced Pearl Harbor.  The special effects may not be nearly as impressive but the screenplay, acting and impact of the 1953 film is far greater than the recent one.Montgomery Clift plays Private Pruitt, a bugle player and boxer who has been transferred to the base because Captain Holmes expects Pruitt to be the star of his base boxing team.  Pruitt however doesn't want to box anymore because he blinded a friend during a sparring match and is wrestling with his guilt over it. His refusal to box means he is given the worst details and is subject to cruel treatment from many of the enlisted men.  The Army however is Pruitt's home and he loves it.  Pruitt eventually falls for a club hostess played by Donna Reed (she won a Supporting Actress Oscar).  Frank Sinatra plays Pruitt's best friend in the platoon and has several border-line comic run ins with Ernest Borgnine.  Burt Lancaster delivers an almost understated performance as Sergeant Warden.  He almost runs Captain Holmes' platoon. He is also involved in a  passionate and very dangerous affair with Captain Holmes' wife, Karen who is well played by Deborah Kerr.  This remains the most interesting  story and one can imagine how controversial and shockingly adult it played to audiences in 1953, because it still holds up even today.You won't confuse From Here to Eternity with a film that was made in the last 20 years, but it's a powerful and surprisingly adult film  very much worth seeing.  It's also an Oscar winning film that won't make you scratch your head trying to figure out why it won its Oscars.The DVD's image and sound is above average but not pristine. From Here To Eternity is presented in the original 1.37:1 full frame aspect ratio.  It's a black and white film and the overall quality is very good, but the outdoor scenes look darker and lack the kind of crispness that some black and white films on DVD have.  I don't know if the fault is with how the black levels are set or with how the film was originally shot.  I do know there is quite a bit of film grain visible but it is not distracting unless you've recently watched something utterly pristine like say the Citizen Kane on DVD.The audio is present in the Dolby 2.0 mono mix format.  The Dolby mix adds a little bit of depth to the sound effects but the dialogue sounds a bit disembodied.  It's over-all a decent but not spectacular audio for a film nearly 50 years old.Extra Features on the DVDOften when a classic film is released you're lucky if you you get some decent production notes, filmographies and an original trailer as part of the DVD.  Thankfully, Columbia Tri-Star has added several extras to the DVD.  There aren't an over-abundance of extras as the hype might lead you to expect, but there are several worthwhile extras and they are greatly appreciated and will be enjoyed by film buffs.There are three theatrical trailers included on the disc from : From Here to Eternity, The Guns of Navarone, And Bridge on the River Kwai.The Making of From Here to Eternity is an interesting two minute puff piece that was produced to further publicize the film in 1953.  It's way too short of course, but of interest.There is a brief ten minute featurette:  Fred Zinnemann: As I See It  which gives us interview footage with the film's director.  You'll wish there was more here than there is.Filmographies are provided for the writer,  director, and most of the cast.I could not find the production notes that are listed on the cover as one of the DVD extras.COMMENT ON THE COMMENTARY TRACK:The feature length audio commentary is done by the director's son, Tim Zinnemann and one of the film's co-stars Alvin Sargent.  It's a pretty laid-back dry commentary mixing tales from behind the scenes with some details on the film's production.  Some interesting stories are remembered and repeated.Christopher Jarmick, is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

He is therefore put through all sorts of hell to get him to reconsider.  He takes it with quiet grace and confidence, sure that he can take anything other than getting back into the ring.  Clift's best friend Maggio (Frank Sinatra) is always taking up for him and definitely pays the price later on.  Sinatra is wonderful in this Oscar-winning performance.Clift's sergeant, Burt Lancaster, is meanwhile having an affair with his commanding officer's wife, Deborah Kerr, playing bad girl against type.  I didn't really care much about their relationship because the commanding officer was such a jackass.The romantic angle that matters here is the one between Clift and Donna Reed (who also won an Oscar) as a dance hall girl (yes, that Donna Reed!).  Theirs is a truly sweet love, more so because they are both so damaged and vulnerable.The Pearl Harbor scenes, once they happen after all this quiet time, are truly shocking (especially when a soldier is gunned down by a plane while running to warn others), although you do get subtle hints at what is coming.  In one scene, where Lancaster is on the phone planning to do something the next day, a calendar behind him clearly reads ""December 6.""Through all this, I was never bored.

160242,A1HYGEDA3GUQX,0800100832,Desiree Koh,"[1, 4]","My favorite scene in this movie isn't the famous Burt Lancaster (Sgt. Warden) - Deborah Kerr (Karen Holmes) beach romp, but that of Montgomery Clift's Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt silhouette walking alone across the barracks, sticking out sorely among the unity of soldiers marching by. I sometimes wonder, if Clift had died suddenly as his peer James Dean had, would he have achieved similar heights of pop culture iconoclasm? Clift once again plays the tortured young man with an honor system established by his own rules, a melancholy misfit who shuffles through the movie a little hunched, one hand in pocket as if to hide something of himself from the world. Although Prew won't box on the company team because he swore he won't get back in the ring, after accidentally blinding a sparring partner, he will seek revenge tragically for his &quot;buddy boy&quot; Private Maggio (Frank Sinatra).In the &quot;ah-cen-chu-ate the positive&quot; post-World War II era in which the movie was filmed, it is the soldiers who takes his orders and does his job well, and by the book, that remains standing tall.

Finally, there's Frank Sinatra's Maggio, who at least doesn't beat up hulking men twice his size, but does get an award and an afterlife as Las Vegas's shady ambassador to Hollywood, a not uncalculated consequence.

160251,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0800100832,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","In hindsight, this 1953 classic doesn't seem as much a military drama as it does a highly charged soap opera, which shouldn't come as a surprise given that master filmmaker Fred Zinnemann (The Nun's Story) was at the helm. The veteran director upended the western genre just a year earlier with the Gary Cooper classicHigh Noon, and he places the same incendiary focus of character over action here, that is, until the inevitable climax which uses the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as a catharsis for the characters' dilemmas now dwarfed by the coming world war.Based on James Jones' epicnovel, screenwriter Daniel Taradash manages to reduce the complexity of the book's themes without trivializing them, and then-offbeat casting enhances the movie immeasurably. Set on a U.S. Army base in Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack, the focus is on two men, both dedicated to the military with no aspirations to become the officers they have grown to detest. One is Private Robert E. Prewitt, a talented boxer (and bugler) who refuses to fight on his regiment's team since blinding a sparring partner. The other is First Sergeant Milton Warden, a take-charge, professional soldier who earns the trust of his men even as he kowtows to his weak-willed commanding officer.Life in the barracks is fraught with adversarial personalities, chief among them Private Angelo Maggio, Prewitt's loudmouthed best friend, and Staff Sergeant ""Fatso"" Judson, the sadistic stockade warden. Both Prewitt and Warden meet women who seek to change their lives. Prewitt finds cynical nightclub ""hostess"" Lorene at a brothel masquerading as a social club, while Warden embarks on a passionate affair with his commanding officer's wayward wife Karen. Burt Lancaster is well cast as Warden, and he brings surprising nuance to his character's clandestine encounters with Karen. However, it's Montgomery Clift - despite looking too slight to be genuinely believable as a boxer - who transcends his loner role by playing off his innately sensitive nature to portray a man who will never sacrifice his honor despite how dire the consequences. Well within his comfort zone, Frank Sinatra's turn as Maggio is small but impactful.Still two years away fromMarty, Ernest Borgnine makes Judson's malevolence palpable in just a few scenes. Deborah Kerr submerges her Scottish accent and previous lady-like demeanor to reveal the embittered, sexually assertive side of Karen without sacrificing any of the character's vulnerability. The legendary, much-parodied beach scene with Lancaster still sizzles after all these years. Similarly, Donna Reed foregoes her good-girl image (epitomized by her memorable turn as Mary Bailey inIt's a Wonderful Life) to play the sultry, delusional Lorene. The 2003 DVD comes with a small set of extras - a three-minute making-of retrospective short, a nine-minute collection of on-set footage and interviews from a documentary entitled ""Fred Zinnemann: As I See It"", and the original theatrical trailer. The best extra is the commentary track from Tim Zinnemann (the director's son) and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (Spider-Man 2), who had a small role in the movie.",5,Involving Military Soap Opera Elevated by Sturdy Performances from an Offbeat Cast,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,3167,"['hindsight', '1953', 'classic', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'much', 'military', 'drama', 'highly', 'charged', 'soap', 'opera', 'should', ""n't"", 'come', 'surprise', 'given', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'Nun', 'Story', 'was', 'helm', 'veteran', 'director', 'upended', 'western', 'genre', 'just', 'year', 'earlier', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'classicHigh', 'Noon', 'same', 'incendiary', 'focus', 'character', 'action', 'here', 'inevitable', 'climax', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'catharsis', 'characters', 'dilemmas', 'now', 'dwarfed', 'coming', 'world', 'war.Based', 'James', 'Jones', 'epicnovel', 'screenwriter', 'Daniel', 'Taradash', 'reduce', 'complexity', 'book', 'themes', 'trivializing', 'then-offbeat', 'casting', 'movie', 'immeasurably', 'Set', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'base', 'Hawaii', 'months', 'leading', 'up', 'attack', 'focus', 'two', 'men', 'dedicated', 'military', 'aspirations', 'become', 'officers', 'have', 'grown', 'detest', 'One', 'Private', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Prewitt', 'talented', 'boxer', 'bugler', 'who', 'fight', 'regiment', 'team', 'blinding', 'sparring', 'partner', 'other', 'First', 'Sergeant', 'Milton', 'Warden', 'take-charge', 'professional', 'soldier', 'who', 'trust', 'men', 'even', 'weak-willed', 'commanding', 'officer.Life', 'barracks', 'fraught', 'adversarial', 'personalities', 'chief', 'Private', 'Angelo', 'Maggio', 'Prewitt', 'loudmouthed', 'best', 'friend', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Fatso', 'Judson', 'sadistic', 'stockade', 'warden', 'Prewitt', 'Warden', 'meet', 'women', 'who', 'seek', 'change', 'lives', 'Prewitt', 'cynical', 'hostess', 'Lorene', 'brothel', 'masquerading', 'social', 'club', 'Warden', 'embarks', 'passionate', 'affair', 'commanding', 'officer', 'wayward', 'wife', 'Karen', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'well', 'cast', 'Warden', 'surprising', 'nuance', 'character', 'clandestine', 'encounters', 'Karen', 'However', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'looking', 'too', 'slight', 'be', 'genuinely', 'believable', 'boxer', 'who', 'loner', 'role', 'playing', 'off', 'innately', 'sensitive', 'nature', 'portray', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'sacrifice', 'honor', 'how', 'dire', 'consequences', 'Well', 'comfort', 'zone', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'turn', 'Maggio', 'small', 'impactful.Still', 'two', 'years', 'away', 'fromMarty', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Judson', 'malevolence', 'palpable', 'just', 'few', 'scenes', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'previous', 'lady-like', 'demeanor', 'reveal', 'embittered', 'sexually', 'assertive', 'side', 'Karen', 'sacrificing', 'character', 'vulnerability', 'legendary', 'much-parodied', 'beach', 'scene', 'Lancaster', 'still', 'years', 'Similarly', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'good-girl', 'image', 'epitomized', 'memorable', 'turn', 'Mary', 'Bailey', 'inIt', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'play', 'sultry', 'delusional', 'Lorene', '2003', 'DVD', 'small', 'set', 'extras', 'three-minute', 'making-of', 'retrospective', 'short', 'nine-minute', 'collection', 'on-set', 'footage', 'interviews', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'See', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'best', 'extra', 'commentary', 'track', 'Tim', 'Zinnemann', 'director', 'son', 'screenwriter', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'who', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'movie']",N/A

It has characters and it has action; what make the film really work is that so much time is spent on the characters that by the time we get to the action we really care about the outcome. We know who these guys are, what they are fighting for and how much the have to loose. This is what Pearl Harbor tried to do but failed to achieve.This film isn't a feel-good picture. Apparently at the time it was released it was very groundbreaking in terms of showing the darker side of the army. The characters in this film all have problems. They aren't perfect. They have flaws, they make mistakes, and they suffer for them. It makes the film very real. It isn't the storybook love story with all the loose ends tied up nicely at the end of two hours.The story revolves around Robert E. Lee Pruitt who joins the army to be a bugler but they just want him to be a boxer. Pruitt won't box because he put his best friend in a coma a while back and he is still haunted. The army is not taking no for an answer. They are determined to get him to compete in the boxing championships at all costs. Then there is Sgt. Warden who is having an affair with the commanding officers wife (this leads to one of the most famous scenes ever of the couple kissing on the beach as the waves wash over them). There are also a couple subplots in this movie involving actors Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed.The writing in this film is just great. All the characters have backstories. There are no cardboard characters in this movie; they all have strengths and weaknesses, wants and needs.

160253,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,0800100832,F. Gentile,"[3, 3]","I love this classic film. The enormity of the attack on Pearl Harbor tends to obscure the fact that there were human beings involved. This film, taken from the James Jones novel, not only tells an interesting story about some not so everyday lives prior to the attack, but its effect on those lives, during and after. All the actors are great.  I greatly admire Montgomery Clift, and he is wonderful here. Apparently, he punched like a girl, and had to be trained to effectively portray his role as a boxer. But to me, it was Burt Lancaster, as the drill sergeant,  who is the most interesting character in this film. Deborah Kerr, as his commanders wife, with whom he's having an illicit affair, was cast against type, and convincingly portrays that ""come here-go away"" pent-up sexual frustration. Yes, this  was the film that most famously sublimated crashing waves as sexual passion, the 1950's version of raw sex. Oh, the good old days!! Donna Reed won best supporting actress for her sensitive and underplayed role as a prostitute who falls in love with Clift. And Frank Sinatra, who apparently was unemployable at this time, and unwanted for this role, was finally, after much pressure and influence, cast as ""Maggio"", and he is great in his portrayal, for which he won best supporting actor. I must admit to not having seen the recent Pearl Harbor story with Ben Affleck, I find all those computerized special effects redundent. To me, the attack in ""Eternity"", while relatively simple in comparison, is much more effective, realistic, and terrifying. I must admit to not liking most modern movies, I don't like todays acting style, for the most part, and they always look like glossy music videos to me. So this film may seem dated to some (and, after reading some of the other reviews, apparently does.) But if you appreciate great storytelling and craftsmanship, rather than being assaulted  by relentless special effects and blasting music, then you'll probably like this classic film. I have not seen the dvd version, which many are criticizing, but have owned a vhs version for years, and the quality has always been very good.

Now digitally re-mastered both in video and sound provides us with this classic on DVD with background extras.  The cast (Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, Montgomery Cliff, Donna Reed and Frank Sinatra)was perfectly chosen and proved by the 13 Oscar nominations and winner of 8 including &quot;Best Picture and Director - Fred Zinneman&quot;.  Frank Sinatras &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; come back role is just the beginning.In Summary: a few days prior to Pearl Harbor we find ourselves involved with these military characters and women struggling to find better lives in the volatile world of 1941.  Knowing war is coming they try desparately to make their lives more meanigfully. The main focus is around the Army life style and how their lives were effected by events they had no real control over.  Lancaster played a top sergeant having an affair with his Company Commanders wife (Kerr), Cliff and Sinatra were 2 soldiers in the same company who befriend each other and end up both being killed by circumstances in this troubled time of December 7, 1941.This Black &amp; White classic film broke all kinds of barriers for subject matter and character/star representation.

160256,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,0800100832,Frederick Baptist,"[3, 4]","This is an all-time great film for many reasons and should be in any film buff's dvd library.  The screenplay is excellent and in a rarity for the time, there is really no happy ending at all and what I really liked about the film is that it came across as sincere and true to life; it hit home that in life, we don't always get the happy ending that we want at least not in the short term.  The acting is also very, very good even for the often underrated Montgomery Clift who never got his due as a great actor not only for this brilliant role but also for his work in ""The Misfits"" and ""A Place In the Sun"".  I thought Donna Reed was even better here than in ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  Frank Sinatra thoroughly deserved his Oscar too.One thing that is regrettable though is that this film wasn't made in colour which is a real waste of a wonderful setting.  Having lived in Honolulu for a few years I can tell you that black and white doesn't do justice to what must be among the most beautiful settings that you can find in the world for any film let alone this masterpiece.  In fact, among the special features is a clip of director Fred Zinnemann's home movies from the set and even that was in colour!  The featurette ""The Making of From Here To Eternity"" was very good as well as the excerpt from ""Fred Zinnemann: As I See It"" which is where we get to see his home movies.Too bad the dvd hasn't been restored well and so the picture and sound quality is poor.  The good news is that with the advent of Blu-ray, the powers that be have the opportunity to do a much better restoration job on this great classic.

160261,ANNQ5O2341T1R,0800100832,George,"[173, 197]","Now pay attention, widescreen DVD fans (I am among them)...!Do not go looking for widescreen format before 1954, because with a couple of exceptions (see &quot;sir-critic&quot; below), they don't exist.  One must be a student of history to some extent as a classic movie fan:  when collecting a video library, know your format history; the key year is 1954.  (Interestingly, it is the same key year for stereo music recordings, at least in the Classical world.)  Also remember that a post-1954 movie is not necessarily a widescreen film, either, especially in the first few years.  (See my review of &quot;Moonstruck&quot; for more aspect ratio commentary that you'll find very interesting, if this one is interesting to you.  I ranted about its full-frame release and found out that I didn't know what I was talking about, more or less.)&quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; is a great classic film that was shot and originally released in 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  Like many, many other pre-1954 movies, this film was probably re-released several times in theaters with a &quot;widescreen&quot; format, but they just lopped off the top and bottom of the picture for the release.  This was a grotesque practice, butchering many fine films and ruining the painstaking framing of shots by the cinematographer.  You don't want a widescreen version of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, because it's butchered, I mean, ALTERED.The important thing for DVD collectors / film buffs is ORIGINAL Theatrical Release Format, i.e., what the director and cinematographer intended you to see.  The video release companies should be heavily encouraged by us to provide this information on the DVD and VHS boxes, so that we know a film's true original aspect ratio, and whether the particular edition is or is not altered, I mean, BUTCHERED.Why is the television screen a 1.33:1 aspect ratio?  Because movies' ratios were 1.33:1.  TV programs and movies were filmed with the same cameras and film.  By the early '50s, TV was becoming so important that film studios needed a new hook to keep people coming to the theaters, so Cinemascope and others were born to amaze audiences.  Try to imagine seeing a 2.55:1 Cinemascope picture in the theater when all you've ever seen up to then was 1.33:1 films and TV.  WOW!!  THAT would keep you coming back to the cinema!  Later cinematic hooks would be in sound, still more or less unachievable at home -- remember Surround Sound's forerunner, &quot;Sensurround&quot; (used for &quot;Midway&quot; and &quot;Earthquake&quot;)?Remember film fans, you might have to do a little research on a given movie before assuming that a video release is not the true format.",4,Original Theatrical Release Format is 1.33:1,1003622400,"10 21, 2001",2001,2679,"['Now', 'pay', 'attention', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'fans', 'am', 'Do', 'not', 'go', 'looking', 'widescreen', 'format', '1954', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'see', 'quot', 'sir-critic', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'One', 'must', 'be', 'student', 'history', 'extent', 'classic', 'movie', 'fan', 'when', 'collecting', 'video', 'library', 'know', 'format', 'history', 'key', 'year', '1954', 'Interestingly', 'same', 'key', 'year', 'stereo', 'music', 'recordings', 'least', 'Classical', 'world', 'Also', 'remember', 'post-1954', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'widescreen', 'film', 'either', 'especially', 'first', 'few', 'years', 'See', 'review', 'quot', 'Moonstruck', 'quot', 'more', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'commentary', ""'ll"", 'find', 'very', 'interesting', 'one', 'interesting', 'ranted', 'full-frame', 'release', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'more', 'less', 'quot', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'quot', 'great', 'classic', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'originally', 'released', '1.33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'pre-1954', 'movies', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 're-released', 'several', 'times', 'theaters', 'quot', 'quot', 'format', 'just', 'lopped', 'off', 'top', 'bottom', 'picture', 'release', 'was', 'grotesque', 'practice', 'butchering', 'many', 'fine', 'films', 'ruining', 'painstaking', 'framing', 'shots', 'cinematographer', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'widescreen', 'version', 'quot', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'quot', 'butchered', 'mean', 'ALTERED.The', 'important', 'thing', 'DVD', 'collectors', '/', 'film', 'buffs', 'ORIGINAL', 'Theatrical', 'Release', 'Format', 'i.e.', 'what', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'intended', 'see', 'video', 'release', 'companies', 'should', 'be', 'heavily', 'encouraged', 'provide', 'information', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'boxes', 'know', 'film', 'true', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'particular', 'edition', 'not', 'altered', 'mean', 'BUTCHERED.Why', 'television', 'screen', '1.33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'movies', 'ratios', 'were', '1.33:1', 'TV', 'programs', 'movies', 'were', 'filmed', 'same', 'cameras', 'film', 'early', ""'50s"", 'TV', 'was', 'becoming', 'so', 'important', 'film', 'studios', 'needed', 'new', 'hook', 'keep', 'people', 'coming', 'theaters', 'Cinemascope', 'others', 'were', 'born', 'amaze', 'audiences', 'Try', 'imagine', 'seeing', '2.55:1', 'Cinemascope', 'picture', 'theater', 'when', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'up', 'then', 'was', '1.33:1', 'films', 'TV', 'WOW', 'would', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'cinema', 'Later', 'cinematic', 'hooks', 'would', 'be', 'sound', 'still', 'more', 'less', 'unachievable', 'home', 'remember', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'forerunner', 'quot', 'Sensurround', 'quot', 'used', 'quot', 'Midway', 'quot', 'quot', 'Earthquake', 'quot', 'Remember', 'film', 'fans', 'might', 'have', 'do', 'little', 'research', 'given', 'movie', 'assuming', 'video', 'release', 'not', 'true', 'format']",N/A

Unfortunately the soap opera aspects of this film somewhat minimize the import of the main event itself.  Still, it beats the recent 'Pearl Harbor' hands-down in every department except for the grimy horror of the attack's special effects, and makes a much more endurable flick.  Don't expect much accuracy in depicting the very different ambience of the early 1940's; this is early 50's revisionist history from the first reel (even Donna Reed's hairdo is wrong), and the big attack is merely a backdrop for the melodrama rather than a driving force.

I really wish I'd taken the time to see this movie earlier.  This film is so much more than the classic beach scene they play constantly on greatest movie moments clip shows.  Burt Lancaster gives a strong performance as Sgt. Warden, the first sergeant to an incompetent, philandering captain.  Warden begins an affair with the captain's wife, Karen, played with aplomb by Deborah Kerr.  The romantic beach scene is nice, but the real fireworks come right after, when Warden demands to know how many men she's been with.  Deborah Kerr's performance when she answers makes watching the film worthwhile and it's barely begun!The other main plot follows Montgomery Clift as Pruitt, a private and his buddy, Maggio, played by a charismatic Frank Sinatra, who almost steals the whole film.  He's a confident, funny drunkard of a solider, an absolute delight to watch.  Pruitt has his own problems, in that Captain Holmes wants him to box, which he cannot do after an incident from his past.  Consequently, (with the exception of Maggio), he is made a pariah within the unit.  Soon, his work ethic and love for the Army forge a bond between him and Warden.  Pruitt also is in love, with Lorene, played by Donna Reed, a social club girl.  Meanwhile, Maggio runs afoul of the stockade sergeant, a brilliantly nasty Ernest Borgdine.The depiction of military life and the bond between the men in this movie  was really well done.  All three of the main male characters face conflict, but they never buckle, sticking to their convictions, no matter the cost.  The relationships between the men and women were never facile, but multi-layered, as complex as any in real life.  The actors all give amazing performances in this movie, never falling to soap opera hysterics.  The ending came as a complete shock to me.  I never expected the film to end as it did, and it was a nice change from most of the current Hollywood schlock that's out there.  It's been quite some time since a movie surprised me.  Little wonder that it took a film from 1953 to do so.I have to say, there are so many fine moments in this film, it really surprises me that the kiss in the water is the one most deeply associated with this movie.  In my opinion, the scene in which Montgomery Clift plays ""Taps"" is a much more striking scene, much more symbolic of the film as a whole.  I had goosebumps during that whole segment, and at the end, where Lorene/Alma meets Karen on the ship.  This is a romantic film, but it is so much more than that.

It tells the story of the lives and relationships of  several characters in the time leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl  Harbour.  The film is well cast.  Lancaster gives a strong performance as  the tough sergeant in love with his superior's wife, and Kerr is equally  fine as the frustrated wife who has become famous for her dalliances.  Frank Sinatra gives a charismatic performance as Maggio, the soldier with a  love of drinking who gets himself into trouble.  Donna Reed convincingly  plays a &quot;toned-down&quot; prostitute who doesn't want to fall in love  with a soldier, but does.  The best performance is given by Montgomery  Clift as the soldier Reed loves, a bugler and former boxer who critically  injured a man in a fight and doesn't want to step back in the ring.  Clift  was an actor capable of digging deep into his characters, and  unfortunately, he seems not to be as well known today as others from his  time. The dialogue is sharp and mature, the attack scenes are excellent,  and there are a number of dramatic, memorable moments in this film.

For instance, the captain wants a championship boxing team, but the best boxer in the company doesn't want to fight.

Granted, it's considered the 52nd best film of all time by The American Film Institute and won 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture...But it didn't seem like a movie I would like. I was wrong. ""From Here to Eternity"" truly deserves to be in the top 100. The film stars Montgomery Clift as Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a solider and former boxer who is tranferred to a different military base so he doesn't have to box anymore. Problem is that Captain Holmes, his superior, wants him to box and is willing to do anything to Prewitt to make him box. Meanwhile, Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster) watches this from afar and begins having an affair with Holmes' wife Karen (Deborah Kerr)...After watching him his friend Prewitt endure the abuse he endures, Maggio (Frank Sinatra) tries to step in but winds up in a lot more trouble then Prewitt. The movie takes place entirely in the days leading up to Pearl Harbor and ends right about the time that happens. Even though it takes place almost entirely on a military base, it's almost blasphemy to classify it as a war movie; It's got a lot more depth than that. The film won two Oscars for acting in supporting roles and the Oscars went to Sinatra and Donna Reed as Lorene, the woman Prewitt falls for. I've never previously seen Sinatra act, but I got a little question...Why did he win the Oscar? The answer? Because he deserved it. His performance is probably the best in the film, he adds a lot of emotional depth and humor to the character that was on the page. Lancaster is also fantastic in this powerful, beautiful motion picture.

160290,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0800100832,Linda Linguvic,"[17, 29]","This classic film still has a lot going for it although it seems somewhat dated by today's standards.  It won the academy award in 1953 for Best picture, and most of the cast either won or were nominated for Oscars. Having read the book way back then and also seeing the picture, I think that some of my memories are from the book, not the movie, because as far as I can see, the movie didn't quite get the richness of the novel.The story is about the peace time army in 1941, in Hawaii, in the few months before the historic Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.The star is Montgomery Clift as Private Pruitt, a solder who refuses to conform because of his personal moral principles.  He is every man's hero and, watching the video, I was impressed with the quality of his acting, and the complexities he adds to the character.Burt Lancaster is his sergeant  who is having an affair with the captain's wife (Deborah Kerr).  They have a famous beach scene where they are lying in the waves as they kiss.  However, neither Lancaster or Kerr ever really come across well. Lancaster's performance is wooden, and Deborah Kerr seems to be an unhappy complainer.  Their dialog is almost silly and sounds like a soap opera. They also smoke cigarettes constantly and this seems dated now.Donna Reed plays a dance hall girl. In the book there was a detailed account of her prostitution, but the movie glosses over that and makes it seem that all she does is dance with the soldiers.  The part is a good one, however, and one that won her an academy award.Frank Sinatra is Montgomery Clift's pal, Angelo Maggio.  I understand that this was a turning point in his career.  The part is small but essential to the plot. Sinatra's performance shines with authenticity and really showed he could act.The audience is aware, of course, that all this is taking place in December of 1941, and there is a feeling of knowing something the characters don't -- that this is the end of an era.  When the attack on Pearl Harbor comes, the climax reinforces this concept and everything changes.The movie has its faults.  A little too much reflection of 1953 moral values.  Offscreen violence in places that could have used more action. Shot in black and white which dilutes the natural beauty of Hawaii.However, It is a movie worth seeing.

But even before the surprise attack finale, there's quite a lot of personal unhappiness in Hawaii. Take Deborah Kerr, for instance. She's trapped in a loveless marriage to the commanding officer, so she's gotten herself a reputation as a nymphomaniac to dull the pain. Now she's taking up with Top Kick Burt Lancaster. His cruddy superior didn't seem to bother him much before, but the course of the movie depicts his growing disgust with that individual, because of how he treats his wife, yes, but also because of how he treats the new bugler, Montgomery Clift. Clift has a reputation of his own as an excellent boxer, but the trouble is, he won't fight on the base's boxing team. Seems he killed someone in the ring accidentally and is bothered by that. The CO degrades him constantly so the only solace he gets is with a sad sack good-time girl, Donna Reed. And Clift's best friend Frank Sinatra really gets on Ernest Borgnine's nerves, so much so that he beats the living daylights out of him. Not a very pretty place, is it, this Pearl Harbor before the attack?Yet it is a very well-done movie, with many memorable scenes between Burt and Deborah, Burt and Ernie, and Frank Sinatra making the comeback of the century, crowned by an  Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

From Here to Eternity is set in Hawaii in the time leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. We, the watchers, know it is coming, looming like a gigantic thunderstorm on the horizon. But for the characters involved, they are wrapped up in their traumas of their daily life, blisfully unaware that what they currently think is vitally important will soon not matter at all.Clift is a soldier-musician who gave up boxing following a tragic incident - but his commander tries to break him and force him back in the ring. Kerr is a wife traumatized by her husband's repeated cheating and the destruction of her dreams of a family. Reed lost the man she loved due to being poor, and she's determined to earn cash and status to prove him wrong. Finally, Clift struggles to hold everything together and do what's right.Life is twisted and tormented, and each character pushes along towards what they want in life. But as much as they feel frustrated in their own lives, they also end up trying to shape and mold those around them at the same time, not realizing it's exactly what they don't want to happen to themselves. Kerr is upset by her lot in life - and yet she tries to force Clift to change HIS dreams to match what she wants.The clock keeps ticking, the calendar pages keep turning, and the audience is expected to know that at 7:48am on December 7th it would all begin.It's fascinating to look at this snapshot in time. The soldiers on their off-days wear ""Hawaiian shirts"" - but they look quite different than what we often consider to be that style today. The women all expect their aim to be to get the richest guy they can, and that's that. It doesn't occur to them to think of other options. It simply wasn't what was done. Kerr doesn't ever talk with other officers' wives - it's just her and the men around her. Reed barely talks to her female boss - her world is the mob of soldiers who vie for her attention.I do have a question, though. Why didn't Clift identify himself as he runs to join his fellow soldiers? Surely that's a key part of training, and doing so would logically leap to mind to anyone in that situation. Clearly it had to happen for plot reasons, but with it being so important, I think it would have helped if they made the character-driven reason more clear.Well recommended.",5,Great characters and plots,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,2435,"['so', 'many', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'focusing', 'traumas', 'war', 'fascinating', 'see', 'one', 'barely', 'even', 'war', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'set', 'Hawaii', 'time', 'leading', 'up', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'watchers', 'know', 'coming', 'looming', 'gigantic', 'thunderstorm', 'horizon', 'characters', 'involved', 'are', 'wrapped', 'up', 'traumas', 'daily', 'life', 'blisfully', 'unaware', 'what', 'currently', 'think', 'vitally', 'important', 'will', 'soon', 'not', 'matter', 'all.Clift', 'soldier-musician', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'boxing', 'following', 'tragic', 'incident', 'commander', 'tries', 'break', 'force', 'back', 'ring', 'Kerr', 'wife', 'traumatized', 'husband', 'repeated', 'cheating', 'destruction', 'dreams', 'family', 'Reed', 'lost', 'man', 'loved', 'due', 'being', 'poor', 'determined', 'earn', 'cash', 'status', 'prove', 'wrong', 'Finally', 'Clift', 'hold', 'everything', 'together', 'do', 'what', 'right.Life', 'twisted', 'tormented', 'character', 'towards', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'as', 'much', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'own', 'lives', 'also', 'end', 'up', 'trying', 'shape', 'mold', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'realizing', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'happen', 'Kerr', 'upset', 'lot', 'life', 'yet', 'force', 'Clift', 'change', 'HIS', 'dreams', 'match', 'what', 'wants.The', 'clock', 'keeps', 'ticking', 'calendar', 'pages', 'keep', 'turning', 'audience', 'expected', 'know', '7:48am', 'December', '7th', 'would', 'begin.It', 'fascinating', 'look', 'snapshot', 'time', 'soldiers', 'off-days', 'Hawaiian', 'shirts', 'look', 'quite', 'different', 'what', 'often', 'consider', 'be', 'style', 'today', 'women', 'expect', 'aim', 'be', 'get', 'richest', 'guy', 'can', ""n't"", 'occur', 'think', 'other', 'options', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'done', 'Kerr', ""n't"", 'ever', 'talk', 'other', 'officers', 'wives', 'just', 'men', 'Reed', 'barely', 'talks', 'female', 'boss', 'world', 'mob', 'soldiers', 'who', 'vie', 'attention.I', 'do', 'have', 'question', 'though', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Clift', 'identify', 'join', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'Surely', 'key', 'part', 'training', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'logically', 'leap', 'mind', 'anyone', 'situation', 'Clearly', 'had', 'happen', 'plot', 'reasons', 'being', 'so', 'important', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'made', 'character-driven', 'reason', 'more', 'clear.Well', 'recommended']",N/A

Clift (Prew) shows that he is more than a pretty boy clothing model with his subtle facial expressions--like the ticked off expression when the boxer continually spills paint on purpose for him to clean up and the tears in his eyes when he's blowing the horn in honor of his departed best friend. Deborah Kerr (Karen) sheds her 'saintly Virgin Mary' image (Black Narcissus, Quo Vadis and The King and I) showing that she can play the unholy as well as the holy and does a very good job putting on an American accent. Burt Lancaster (Milton) has the right persona for a rough and tough soldier. Best of all is Frank Sinatra as the eccentric Maggio--his comic relief ""I love women tall as trees."" and the drunk scenes are hilarious. The only weak link I can think of is Donna Reed (Lorene) as Montgomery Clift's girlfriend as she doesn't have much else to do than stand around looking prettily made up (I would rather she had won an oscar for It's a Wonderful Life) but even she is good.Fred Zinneman's direction is absolutely flawless and the editing is superb, especially the up and down shots during the invasion when you see the airplane view of the soldiers running this way and that on the lawn like ants.So why do I give this movie two stars when it deserves five from a technical standpoint? Why is it that I don't buy into this movie the way so many professional cineastes do? It all boils down to the enjoyment value of the story. I couldn't really care for or sympathize with any of the characters because they all seemed (with the possible exception of Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed as Maggio and Lorene) as shallow, self-centered and wimpy as you can get. For instance, Milton spends most of his time commiting adultery with his boss' wife and we never get the impression that either he or she ever have ANY feelings of GUILT or REMORSE over it. The blond bimbo, Karen is so paper thin and incedental and doesn't have a really compelling personality. Why did the screenwriters put her in the script? Just to have another babe aboard? So her husband walks out on her. Why doesn't she just get a divorce instead of jumping from bedroom to bedroom looking for just the right man? How hard could it be for a single woman in the 1940's America to get a job and support herself?This isn't the Middle Ages or 18th century England. The ending made me sick. Big whoop. She leaves the island with her husband--she's not going to divorce him so she can marry her true love. Nothing too dramatic about that.In real life Prew would be seen for what he was--a whinny, simpering insubordinate who didn't want to follow orders--they would tell him to shape up or ship out. Yeah I know you feel like crap for blinding a guy during a boxing match. But that guy WANTED to box with you. He KNEW what he was getting into so buck up. This is the army! If your superiors want you to box, get over it. You never disobey your superiors especially in training. Oh sure, he finally boxed--that is after they had to step on his hands (figuretively and literally) to do it. The final scene where he staggers out to the battlefield in civilian clothes holding his wounds and not having a single gun is so idiotic and contrived. Any wounded man is his right mind would be glad to have a girlfriend through thick and thin to patch him up and wait until he was all healed up. That scene just made no sense. It felt like it had to happen simply for the grand tragic final like the screenwriters were trying too hard to avoid a classic happy Hollywood ending.There were four soldiers around when Maggio died as he told them how the evil nightclub pianist/army taskmaster hit him in the stomach multiple times. Why didn't they call the police? Were there no police in 1940's Hawaii? Why couldn't they have the murder put on army trial--a jury of his peers? You got me.Thumbs down. I don't care how well acted, directed, edited, photographed, etc.) a film is if I can't stand the plot. Regardless of it's techinical brilliance, if you can't care for the main characters or if there's no moral lesson to be learned then the film is a waste of time.",2,Five Stars for the technical aspects.

160298,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,0800100832,Mcgivern Owen L,"[7, 9]","""From Here to Eternity"" is a Hollywood classic.  It may be the finest film ever about the military in peacetime. The background is Schofield Barracks, Hawaii in the Fall of 1941. That was the old ""brown boot"" Army! This reviewer is a Vietnam era vet, so I can't address the realism of the setting. Judging by the crisp dialog and snappy khaki uniforms, I'm giving the director the benefit of any doubt.  I always thought it fascinating that an Austrian born Director could be at the helm of such classics as ""High Noon"" and FHTE -in consecutive years no less. What did Mr. Zinnemann know of the Old West or the American Army? The male lead is Burt Lancaster as First Sergeant Warden, a tough but fair NCO that any enlisted man would want for his ""top"".  The second male lead is Private Prewitt, played by Montgomery Clift. Prewitt is a top bugler who isn't allowed to bugle and a top boxer who reuses to box for the company team! How that automatic conflict plays out is the heart of the movie. Another conflict is between Frank Sinatra, a happy go lucky but harmless enlisted man who trouble seems to follow and an evil Ernest Borgnine, the top MP at the Schofield stockade. Their ""dispute"" plays out too, with Clift a surprise key figure in its' ""resolution"". This reviewer believes that far too much attention has been lavished on the affair between Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, the wife of the Company Commander.  I found it hard to swallow that any serious career man would run around openly with an officer's wife. Lancaster was one step away from a bust down to the lowest private and a trip to the stockade. The real female star here was Donna Reed, a bar ""hostess' who would be a prostitute in real life. Her sensitivity toward Clift produces some of the best scenes in FHTE. Someone must have agreed because Donna walked off with the Best Supporting Actress Oscar- and promptly fainted after receiving it.  The interplay between Lancaster/Kerr and Clift/Reed caused some huge challenges for the Director in making the bawdy best selling novel ""clean"" for the silver screen in the still conservative, prudish America of 1953. FHTE also contains some of the sharpest dialog and one liners this reviewer can remember. Two favorites: ""Never disturb a man when he's drinking"" (Lancaster) and ""No one lies about being lonely""(Clift). In addition to Reed, Oscars were awarded for Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, Film Editing, Cinematography and Supporting Actor, (Sinatra). The last two are important: FHTE revived Frank's career. Many believe that ""pressure"" was applied to Harry Cohn and Columbia Pictures to hire Sinatra. Do we remember the ""horses head in the bed"" scene from Godfather I? Others claim that his then wife, Ava Gardner, supplied the ""influence"". Finally FHTE is yet another example of why black and white classics should not be colorized.

One soldier has an affair with the Captain's wife, another soldier becomes romantically involved with a...um...""dance hall hostess"" while at the same time resisting being forced to join his company's boxing team, and another soldier pits himself against a formidable foe.  If you are thinking that the attack will be the main focus of the film, you are wrong and will have to wait until the end for that to happen.  This is a tour-de-force movie about relationships.Montgomery Clift beats expectations as the soldier who doesn't want to box.  Burt Lancaster is tough to the soldiers but in offguard moments shows he has a strong, caring side.  Frank Sinatra pulls off the little tough guy, Maggio, superbly.  Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed, both cast against type, turn in very admirable performances.The video is superb, lots of grain, good solid blacks.  (For those who don't know the movie, it is in superb black and white.  Dont be misled by the color cover photo, and, LOL, don't also think that Japanese planes are flying overhead during the famous beach scene.Audio: excellent.  Always clear, and when the bombs do finally fall, you feel them.  (A sidenote: this is another release that shows off the ability of Blu-ray.  There are multiple foreign-language selections, plus 25 subtitle language possibilities.)The extras are surprisingly slim for a fim like this, but a few of them are excellent.

There are also a few captions that appear that are scene specific.  That last is one of the problems with the P-i-P...the captions are the only thing scene-specific...the people talking were all filmed separately, none of them are talking about the film while watching it.  They are edited in and do have a reference point, sometimes, but it is not like watching the film and being specific.  At first, I thought these would be clips brought over from the featurette, ""The Making of From Here to Eternity, but it turns out that isn't the case at all.  That ""making of"" extra is over almost the moment you read the title, running just over 2 minutes long.  There is an excellent 9-minute excerpt from ""Fred Zinnemann: As I see It"", and there are some nice color home-movie clips that were taken on the set.  It will have you wanting more.

Even my ""melodrama queen"" partner fell asleep. Trust me, even die-hard fans of ""old Hollywood"" are bound to be disappointed-------yet, curiously I just took a peek at the votes and they are overwhelmingly 4 and 5 stars!!!! Who are these people???? (I make it a rule NOT to read any of the reviews before writing my own in fear of being swayed by one side or the other------and how I pay for it when I MUST be RUTHLESS!!! (look at those negative votes!!)--------yet I TRULY LOVE negative votes--------I am clearly not running for office or coveting that STUPID ""prize"" of ""Hall of Fame"" or whatever......(well, it would be nice------ha!)The only reason I decided to watch this movie (again, after perhaps 30 years, which meant I remembered nothing except for the iconic scene at the beach reproduced ad nauseum forever and ever as if it was the most revelatory thing ever filmed) was for my ""idol"", sad, beautiful, painfully closeted MONTGOMERY CLIFT. And even then I was disappointed since many of his takes were not at all impressive.......Forget about acting........even though MONTY was a GREAT character actor---------and what quiet masculinity! (destroying all those stupid discriminatory ideas that every homosexual has to be a SISSY)..........yet I guess NO ONE can do much with the lines and moves they are given in this shadow of a ""film"".FEMINISTS must detest this film (pre women's lib) since all it does is reinforce every idiotic stereotype about women as weak, confused, horribly vulnerable human beings crying for their love interest who clearly is more than a bit of a cad.The movie is a mess. It's as if they had only been able, when editing, to patch up the best they could the DULLNESS, the shallowness of this crap.But........there are (almost) always a few ""delights"" to offer us some respite from the suffocating mediocrity:1-Monty, for some reason, shaved his whole chest for the filming (now THAT was ""fem"" in 1953!!!)........it appears that he may have been asked to since he had an ugly rug that, being rid of shows a beautifully buff body......2-No match, however, for Burt Lancaster, who must have lifted weights for months to look as good as he does for that ridiculous scene at the beach with Deborah Kerr--------and how he wore that uniform!!!! and that TOUGH masculinity! So, at least, since it is so lowly a film you might use it as ""soft porn"" (even better if you are a closeted male, since you don't have to face your conflict by having to gather all your strength and finally look at gay porn------well, I forgot about the 'net nowadays---------I halfway joke since I have the greatest compassion for men in the closet-----I myself having suffered through such hell for decades.)3- Frank Sinatra! This SKELETON is Sinatra???? He is almost unrecognizable! That this man would balloon to the shape he got to in the (what? 70's?) or even at his best looking, perhaps ten years after the movie, is hard, hard, to believe.......4- Perhaps Ernest Borgnine played it best, since I got so involved with his repulsive behavior that I could forget he was acting.5- Deborah Kerr I barely knew anything about, but she was no great beauty (Joan Crawford was a goddess next to her), and again, she's playing a sad, in-love, ""victimized"" dreary cartoon of a woman bent out of shape by ""love"", basically used by Lancaster's character.This is B-grade CHEAP ""entertainment"" that amazes when you are told that the movie won X-amount of Oscars----------trust me, when even Jean Louis' costumes make the women look plain, you've got a DUD all the way................",2,This CHEAP SOAP OPERA......,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,3943,"['so', 'SHAMELESS', 'use', 'tragedy', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'little', 'more', 'excuse', 'TWO', 'DREARY', 'PHONY', 'love', 'stories', 'are', 'entirely', 'UNRELATED', 'anything', 'do', 'massive', 'catastrophe.The', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'screenplay', 'dialogue', 'are', 'so', 'cliched', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'so', 'artificial', 'make', 'Days', 'Lives', 'great', 'competitor', 'Even', 'melodrama', 'queen', 'partner', 'fell', 'asleep', 'Trust', 'even', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed', '-yet', 'curiously', 'just', 'took', 'peek', 'votes', 'are', 'overwhelmingly', '4', '5', 'stars', 'Who', 'are', 'people', 'make', 'rule', 'NOT', 'read', 'reviews', 'writing', 'own', 'fear', 'being', 'swayed', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'how', 'pay', 'when', 'MUST', 'be', 'RUTHLESS', 'look', 'negative', 'votes', 'yet', 'TRULY', 'LOVE', 'negative', 'votes', 'am', 'clearly', 'not', 'running', 'office', 'coveting', 'STUPID', 'prize', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'ha', 'only', 'reason', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'perhaps', '30', 'years', 'meant', 'remembered', 'nothing', 'iconic', 'scene', 'beach', 'reproduced', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'forever', 'ever', 'was', 'most', 'revelatory', 'thing', 'ever', 'filmed', 'was', 'idol', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'painfully', 'closeted', 'MONTGOMERY', 'CLIFT', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'disappointed', 'many', 'were', 'not', 'impressive', '.Forget', 'acting', '..even', 'MONTY', 'was', 'GREAT', 'character', 'actor', '-and', 'what', 'quiet', 'masculinity', 'destroying', 'stupid', 'discriminatory', 'ideas', 'homosexual', 'be', 'SISSY', '.yet', 'guess', 'ONE', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'lines', 'moves', 'are', 'given', 'shadow', 'film', '.FEMINISTS', 'must', 'detest', 'film', 'pre', 'women', 'lib', 'reinforce', 'idiotic', 'stereotype', 'about', 'women', 'weak', 'confused', 'horribly', 'vulnerable', 'human', 'beings', 'crying', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'clearly', 'more', 'bit', 'cad.The', 'movie', 'mess', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'able', 'when', 'editing', 'patch', 'up', 'best', 'could', 'DULLNESS', 'shallowness', 'crap.But', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'few', 'delights', 'offer', 'respite', 'suffocating', 'mediocrity:1-Monty', 'reason', 'shaved', 'whole', 'chest', 'filming', 'now', 'THAT', 'was', 'fem', '1953', '..it', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'asked', 'had', 'ugly', 'rug', 'being', 'rid', 'shows', 'beautifully', 'buff', 'body', '2-No', 'match', 'however', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'lifted', 'weights', 'months', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'beach', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'how', 'wore', 'uniform', 'TOUGH', 'masculinity', 'So', 'least', 'so', 'lowly', 'film', 'might', 'use', 'soft', 'porn', 'even', 'better', 'are', 'closeted', 'male', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'face', 'conflict', 'having', 'gather', 'strength', 'finally', 'look', 'gay', 'porn', 'well', 'forgot', ""'net"", 'nowadays', '-I', 'halfway', 'joke', 'have', 'greatest', 'compassion', 'men', 'closet', '-I', 'having', 'suffered', 'such', 'hell', 'decades', '3-', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'SKELETON', 'Sinatra', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'man', 'would', 'balloon', 'shape', 'got', 'what', '70', 'even', 'best', 'looking', 'perhaps', 'ten', 'years', 'movie', 'hard', 'hard', 'believe', '.4-', 'Perhaps', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'played', 'best', 'got', 'so', 'involved', 'repulsive', 'behavior', 'could', 'forget', 'was', 'acting.5-', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'barely', 'knew', 'anything', 'about', 'was', 'great', 'beauty', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'goddess', 'next', 'again', 'playing', 'sad', 'in-love', 'victimized', 'dreary', 'cartoon', 'woman', 'bent', 'shape', 'love', 'basically', 'used', 'Lancaster', 'character.This', 'B-grade', 'CHEAP', 'entertainment', 'when', 'are', 'told', 'movie', 'won', 'X-amount', 'Oscars', 'when', 'even', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'costumes', 'make', 'women', 'look', 'plain', ""'ve"", 'got', 'DUD', 'way']",N/A

Set on pre-war O'ahu and only a dozen years after the famous historical event that serves as its backdrop, this film avoids an easy reliance on the attack on Pearl Harbor to capture its audience. Indeed, we are given only occasional reminders of this imminent military disaster, which contributes to the tone of dramatic irony in this film. For despite the very real anguish in the lives of these characters, and the trials of military treatment, we as the audience know it pales by comparison to what will soon ensue. Paradise, too, is mostly a backdrop as the action fixates on a small group of soldiers and their personal lives. Herein is the strength of the film: its round characterization, which is convincing and therefore engaging. Sinatra gives his role more zeal than it deserves and Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed are (dare I say it?) too old for their roles, but other than that the acting is superb. If you've ever visited Hawaii, you'll enjoy the vistas, although they're actually few and far between. If you've lived in Hawaii, or been stationed on one of the bases there, you'll quickly be scratching your head at the lack of local flavor. That is, this is nearly an all-haole (re: white) production in place where whites even then were not the majority. You do see the occasional Chinese, although those walking Chinatown near Nuuanu Street look like they walked out of a Qing Dynasty mural. Still, the conflicts are genuinely configured and the resulting tension is thick and suspenseful. For this reason, more than any other, this film deserves a place on your home video shelf.

But war is very important to this motion picture... The December 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is its definite point, its explosive end, the ruthless attack on U.S. military mind...The attack is one of the great sequences in War Films... The sound of the Japanese planes is heard, then there are explosions, and confused soldiers rising from their early breakfast... The Japanese Bombers dive and sweep firing with machine-guns the courtyard and its large buildings, while men run in every direction...When a non-fighting companion refuses to pass out arms to his pals, the soldiers break down the door of the ammunition room, take the machine guns to the roof and fire to the flying planes...When they succeed in hitting one plane they are delighted by the flavor of war...With this powerful scene all the connecting parts that hold together the characters of the story are permanently altered...

He guides and supports his 'philander' pretentious Captain... He proves himself as an inspiring leader of men when the barracks were under attack...Montgomery Clift gives, perhaps, the best performance of his career as the bugler-boxer soldier, whose convictions are stronger than 'The Treatment.'Deborah Kerr plays the cool and reserved young lady stimulating her feelings of love in different ways...Frank Sinatra is terrific in his rebellious role of Angelo Maggio... He gives a deep and intense characterization, winning an Academy Award...Donna Reed is excellent as the charming social woman of the evening...Winner of eight Academy Awards, ""From Here to Eternity"" is a clear indicative of how war comes into collision with the destinies of people, throwing them violently into a turbulent and dangerous situation...",5,"War, in this film, is bigger than people...",1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,2686,"['Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'David', 'Lean', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'good', 'war', 'story', 'people', 'whom', 'are', 'extremely', 'identified', 'concerned', 'may', 'seem', 'strange', 'consider', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'war', 'film', 'great', 'part', 'military', 'life', 'peacetime', 'army', 'war', 'very', 'important', 'motion', 'picture', 'December', '7', '1941', 'Japanese', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'definite', 'point', 'explosive', 'end', 'ruthless', 'attack', 'U.S.', 'military', 'mind', 'attack', 'one', 'great', 'sequences', 'War', 'Films', 'sound', 'Japanese', 'planes', 'heard', 'then', 'are', 'explosions', 'confused', 'soldiers', 'rising', 'early', 'breakfast', 'Japanese', 'Bombers', 'dive', 'sweep', 'firing', 'machine-guns', 'courtyard', 'large', 'buildings', 'men', 'run', 'direction', 'When', 'non-fighting', 'companion', 'pass', 'out', 'arms', 'pals', 'soldiers', 'break', 'down', 'door', 'ammunition', 'room', 'take', 'machine', 'roof', 'fire', 'flying', 'planes', 'When', 'succeed', 'hitting', 'one', 'plane', 'are', 'delighted', 'flavor', 'war', 'powerful', 'scene', 'connecting', 'parts', 'hold', 'together', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'permanently', 'altered', 'great', 'event', 'characters', 'pains', 'passions', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'force', 'modified', 'everything', 'War', 'film', 'bigger', 'people', 'highlights', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'let', 'mention', 'best', 'Clift', 'playing', 'flamboyant', 'blues', 'local', 'beer', 'joint', 'blues', 'came', 'rushing', 'out', 'expelled', 'body', 'strength', 'feelings', 'romantic-erotic', 'scene', 'Lancaster', 'Kerr', 'deserted', 'beach', 'Clift', 'playing', 'Taps', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'face', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'tough', ""'efficient"", 'sergeant', 'who', 'how', 'bend', 'rules', 'breaking', ""'philander"", 'pretentious', 'Captain', 'inspiring', 'leader', 'men', 'when', 'barracks', 'were', 'attack', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'bugler-boxer', 'soldier', 'convictions', 'are', 'stronger', ""'The"", 'Treatment', 'Kerr', 'cool', 'reserved', 'young', 'lady', 'stimulating', 'feelings', 'love', 'different', 'ways', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'terrific', 'rebellious', 'role', 'Angelo', 'Maggio', 'deep', 'intense', 'characterization', 'winning', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'excellent', 'charming', 'social', 'woman', 'evening', 'Winner', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'clear', 'indicative', 'how', 'war', 'collision', 'destinies', 'people', 'throwing', 'violently', 'turbulent', 'dangerous', 'situation']",N/A

There were just too many difficulties to overcome when this was made, all owing to the strict censorship of the time.(1) The realistic, if very profane, language spoken by soldiers could not be used in the 1950s.  The language of the novel was a big departure in popular American fiction, and the movies had not caught up with readers.(2) The extra-marital affairs were treated somewhat mysteriously.  Sex scenes are either eliminated or indicated by crashing waves.  If the movie goer didn't know the ""code,"" some scenes were lost.(3) The Donna Reed character was a prostitute in the book, but in the movie she was like a USO hostess who never ever went upstairs with the boys.  This takes away from the angst Prewitt feels about her.(4) The violence was substantially downplayed, especially in the alley knife fight and in the long fistfight, where the men land haymakers and no one has so much as a bloody nose or a fat lip.  Hollywood has never staged a realistic fight.(5) The captain is forced to resign for his evil doing, but in the book he is praised by his superiors.  The Army wouldn't allow the use of their facilities without this ""correction.""This is a brief overview of the problems.

Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) is fighting for his life in a boxing match with another officer who started the fight.  His commanding officer, Captain Holmes, had been pressuring him to fight with the company's boxing team, but he had refused.  Holmes' commanding officers observing this from above make the above comment.In the movie, the year is 1941, the place is Schofield barracks, where some of the shooting for the film actually took place, just 8 miles from Pearl Harbor.  The movie was based on a book of the same name, a bit controversial in that its depiction of Army life was graphic and not commending.  The fate of the really harmless, Maggio (Frank Sinatra), another private first class who half the time is near dead drunk, is one of the many tragedies of the story.  The men in the barracks are merely biding their time, training, boozing, chasing skirts while their officers, during their breaks, read the newspaper on events of the war in europe.  Pearl Harbor is just 8 miles down the road...Two separate love stories develop between Seargent Warden (Burt Lancaster) and Mrs. Holmes (Deborah Kerr), the wife of the Commanding Officer of the barracks, and Prewitt and a call girl, Lorene (Donna Reed).This movie is not over-rated; it's still a classic in my book.  I was moved the first time I saw this years ago as much as I am now.  Although, the second time around, I'm more enamored with Clift's acting, the other hero in the story.  Interestingly his birthday was yesterday, and he died young at 46 of a heart attack.  He started out on Broadway, was reluctant to try Hollywood, was very selective about the parts he'd choose to be in.  He was unique, untraditional in many ways.  It was rumored that he was a homosexual, though I'm not so sure, neither do I care; he was just a d--n good actor who prepared the way for Brando and Dean.  There are so many other great actors in this film too, and the footage of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, from newsreels of other naval battles, is so realistic, so effectively woven into the story.  Well worth watching several times over, and never mind the famous, steamy smooching scene on a beach of Honolulu; there's much more to the story than that.

160323,A97THPN6OPN9U,0800100832,"Scott Emery ""Striving to Understand""","[1, 8]","From Here to Eternity is a promising film that has occasional moments of excellent acting - primarily from the enigmatically charming everyman Montgomery Clift - but fails to deliver on its reputation because of script that has a quirky plot catalyst, lacks sufficient integrity in the motivation of its characters,and does not seem to fit the historic moment. It also lacks credibility in its depiction of actual actions, a failing that it unfortunately shares with many Hollywood films of the era.The story of Army personnel in Hawaii in the months prior to Pearl Harbor centers around the decision of the talented boxer and bugler Robert E. Lee Prewitt, portrayed by Clift, not to box for the company team.  Since the captain of the company is sponsor of the team and pins much of his fragile ego, apparently, on its success, he and his thuggish boxers and other confidants proceed to make life hell for the stubborn Prewitt.  This struggle involves many an insulting scene to the stoic Prewitt, who, we learn later in a throwaway line, is an orphan and thus sees the Army as something of a family.  Since this thin reed cannot support the plot of an entire movie, the affair of the capable Lancaster, trying to provide a bit of dimension to his rather stock character Sergeant Warden, and the pouty Kerr, married to the incompetent company captain, the buddy relationship between the Clift character, and the mouthy, drunken, and apparently masochistic Maggio, played by Sinatra (if this portrayal is worthy of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, I do not want to see the work of the other nominees) and the quixotic relationship between the flawed duo of Alma, played by Donna Reed, and Prewitt, provide dramatic distractions.  This is the stuff of Peyton Place, and both the novelist, James Jones, and the screenwriter, Daniel Taradash, realize this, so shocking - if predictable - deaths and tragedy, along with the attack on Pearl Harbor, provide the contrived denouement.One struggles to understand the motivations of the characters in this film even as we can accept the morally strong case that Prewitt has for refusing to box on the company team.  We are given no particular reasons for Lancaster falling for Kerr, in fact we are provided nothing redeeming about the Kerr character whatsoever, besides her bad marriage and inability, now, to have children.  The Lancaster character is not seen to be one who is sympathetic to weak and foundering people, but he somehow cannot resist Kerr.  Until, that is, she asks him to become an officer, a career stretch of which he is obviously capable.  Similarly, the attraction of Alma, played by Reed for Prewitt, is apparently based on her sympathy for his hangdog tenderness and his good looks, since he is clinging and drunken in their first few encounters.  Here we have an example of my third point, in that Alma's willingness to live for today even as she plans her eventual return to a &#34;proper&#34; life, is a postwar sentiment, not that of someone who has not yet seen WWII.  Finally, are we really to believe that bad piano playing and an insult to his sister prompts  the diminutive Maggio, played by Sinatra, to risk his life in defiance of bullying stockade Captain Judson, played by without nuance by Ernest Borgnine?  What else is bothering Maggio, we are left to ask?  Or are we being manipulated to believe that Judson is just a very bad man, one of many who may be part of the Army officer ranks?The war raging in Europe in 1940, a cataclysm that certainly would have been on the minds of any person in uniform at the time, is mentioned only in one passing remark by Sergeant Warden as he tries to sort out his next plans with the Kerr character.  The prospect of combat against the Nazi war machine, or even the possibility of engaging the Imperial Japanese - not farfetched for people serving in Hawaii - would have provided a taut backdrop for the drama, and would have been a more realistic touchpoint for the actions of the characters.  Alas, we hear no fear of war, or worry for the fate of western civilization from this crew, content, in the writer's eyes to fret over those who will not support boxing contests or won't pursue love because of hatred of the officer class.This is a mediocre film populated by some of the better talent in Hollywood at the time, and it is indeed the spectre of Hollywood stock expectations that cloud the entire endeavor.  It is melodrama, not reality, and it deserves few of the raves that have been heaped upon it for over 60 years.",3,Unfocused Script Fails a Strong Ensemble,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,4544,"['Here', 'Eternity', 'promising', 'film', 'occasional', 'moments', 'excellent', 'acting', 'primarily', 'enigmatically', 'charming', 'everyman', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'deliver', 'reputation', 'script', 'quirky', 'plot', 'catalyst', 'sufficient', 'integrity', 'motivation', 'characters', 'not', 'seem', 'fit', 'historic', 'moment', 'also', 'credibility', 'depiction', 'actual', 'actions', 'failing', 'unfortunately', 'shares', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'era.The', 'story', 'Army', 'personnel', 'Hawaii', 'months', 'prior', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'centers', 'decision', 'talented', 'boxer', 'bugler', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Prewitt', 'portrayed', 'Clift', 'not', 'box', 'company', 'team', 'captain', 'company', 'sponsor', 'team', 'much', 'fragile', 'ego', 'apparently', 'success', 'thuggish', 'boxers', 'other', 'confidants', 'proceed', 'make', 'life', 'hell', 'stubborn', 'Prewitt', 'struggle', 'many', 'insulting', 'scene', 'stoic', 'Prewitt', 'who', 'learn', 'later', 'throwaway', 'line', 'orphan', 'thus', 'Army', 'something', 'family', 'thin', 'reed', 'can', 'not', 'support', 'plot', 'entire', 'movie', 'affair', 'capable', 'Lancaster', 'trying', 'provide', 'bit', 'dimension', 'rather', 'stock', 'character', 'Sergeant', 'Warden', 'pouty', 'Kerr', 'married', 'incompetent', 'company', 'captain', 'buddy', 'relationship', 'Clift', 'character', 'mouthy', 'drunken', 'apparently', 'masochistic', 'Maggio', 'played', 'Sinatra', 'portrayal', 'worthy', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'work', 'other', 'nominees', 'quixotic', 'relationship', 'flawed', 'duo', 'Alma', 'played', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Prewitt', 'provide', 'dramatic', 'distractions', 'stuff', 'Peyton', 'Place', 'novelist', 'James', 'Jones', 'screenwriter', 'Daniel', 'Taradash', 'realize', 'so', 'shocking', 'predictable', 'deaths', 'tragedy', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'provide', 'contrived', 'denouement.One', 'understand', 'motivations', 'characters', 'film', 'even', 'can', 'accept', 'morally', 'strong', 'case', 'Prewitt', 'refusing', 'box', 'company', 'team', 'are', 'given', 'particular', 'reasons', 'Lancaster', 'falling', 'Kerr', 'fact', 'are', 'provided', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'Kerr', 'character', 'whatsoever', 'bad', 'marriage', 'inability', 'now', 'have', 'children', 'Lancaster', 'character', 'not', 'seen', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'sympathetic', 'weak', 'foundering', 'people', 'somehow', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'Kerr', 'become', 'officer', 'career', 'stretch', 'obviously', 'capable', 'Similarly', 'attraction', 'Alma', 'played', 'Reed', 'Prewitt', 'apparently', 'based', 'sympathy', 'hangdog', 'tenderness', 'good', 'looks', 'clinging', 'drunken', 'first', 'few', 'encounters', 'Here', 'have', 'example', 'third', 'point', 'Alma', 'willingness', 'live', 'today', 'even', 'eventual', 'return', '34', 'proper', '34', 'life', 'postwar', 'sentiment', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'WWII', 'Finally', 'are', 'really', 'believe', 'bad', 'piano', 'playing', 'insult', 'sister', 'diminutive', 'Maggio', 'played', 'Sinatra', 'risk', 'life', 'defiance', 'bullying', 'stockade', 'Captain', 'Judson', 'played', 'nuance', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'What', 'else', 'bothering', 'Maggio', 'are', 'left', 'ask', 'are', 'being', 'manipulated', 'believe', 'Judson', 'just', 'very', 'bad', 'man', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'Army', 'officer', 'ranks', 'war', 'raging', 'Europe', '1940', 'cataclysm', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'minds', 'person', 'uniform', 'time', 'mentioned', 'only', 'one', 'passing', 'remark', 'Sergeant', 'Warden', 'sort', 'out', 'next', 'plans', 'Kerr', 'character', 'prospect', 'combat', 'Nazi', 'war', 'machine', 'even', 'possibility', 'engaging', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'not', 'farfetched', 'people', 'serving', 'Hawaii', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'taut', 'backdrop', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'realistic', 'touchpoint', 'actions', 'characters', 'Alas', 'hear', 'fear', 'war', 'worry', 'fate', 'western', 'civilization', 'crew', 'content', 'writer', 'eyes', 'fret', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'support', 'boxing', 'contests', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pursue', 'love', 'hatred', 'officer', 'class.This', 'mediocre', 'film', 'populated', 'better', 'talent', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'indeed', 'spectre', 'Hollywood', 'stock', 'expectations', 'cloud', 'entire', 'endeavor', 'melodrama', 'not', 'reality', 'few', 'raves', 'have', 'been', 'heaped', '60', 'years']",N/A

The DVD was awful looking, a blury image and a lot of specks and scratches in the image. The B-Ray edition takes care of this with a cleaner image, sharper than the DVD and also a 5.1 DTS audio that is way better than the old soundtrack which was probably mono (it wasn't mentionned on the old DVD). Is this the best image I've seen on B-Ray? no, but then again you have to consider the source print and in this case if I compare the old DVD and this new print, there's a big improvement. Like On the waterfront for example, the DVD was so bad that the Criterion B-Ray release is incredible when you compare with the garbage looking DVD released in the 90's. I remember buying From here to eternity and On the waterfront on DVD about the same time in the 90's and saying to myself, I just hope that someday those great movies will come back again with better results. Not bad, time as passed, Blu-Ray technology arrived and now I've got 2 very good prints of these great classics. It's not the best b/w transfer of all time but it's very good compare to the DVD and I recommand it for the low price. There's also a very good extra on B-Ray that wasn't on the DVD, it's an audio commentary that's called Graphics-in-picture track, it's very informative and interesting and it brings interactive information during the commentary with images and graphics, it's more visual than a regular audio commentary, I liked it.

The bits I'd seen over the years showed great acting, certainly, but the story seemed too soap opera.  I was wrong.  It's less soap opera and more tragedy, and in this, fleshed out characters who are nuanced and sympathetic dominate.  Though most people think of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr as the stars, their famous beach scene notwithstanding, Montgomery Clift is the true headliner, whose nobly off-kilter Private Prewitt charts a doomed course toward redemption, with borderline prostitute Donna Reed and scrappy friend Frank Sinatra in tow.  To discuss it further is to give too much away, but if there's a theme that dominates the film, it's ""too little, too late,"" as characters embroiled in a hot bed of human relationships miss opportunities because they hesitate.  The cast is impeccable, from the steely but humane Lancaster to the gleefully sadistic Ernest Borgnine to the lovely and affecting Kerr and Reed.  If there is a weakness to ""From Here to Eternity,"" it lies in the inability to blend the cultures that make Hawaii such a beautiful place -- the story is so mono-cultural, it might as well have been set in Kansas and doesn't resemble the Hawaii that I know.

It's place in cinematic history remains secure: Frank Sinatra's Oscar, Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr embracing in the surf, and the Oscar for Best Picture.  Yet, what was considered an adult film back in 1953 plays like a run-of-the-mill soap opera in the present day.As Sergeant Warden (Lancaster) and Karen Holmes (Kerr), the wife of his superior, start to fall in love, Private Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) is trying to find a way to avoid participating in his unit's boxing championship.  Prewitt finds support from his friend Maggio (Sinatra) who tries to protect him from the pressures around him and finds love with Lorene (Donna Reed), a &quot;working girl&quot; who has temporarily relocated to Hawaii.  Into the mix is thrown a sadistic warden played by Ernest Borgnine and the bombing of Pearl Harbor which plunges all involved straight into World War II.""From Here to Eternity"" is filled with one character after another who is desperate.  All of them are either desperate for power, desperate for love, desperate for acceptance, or desperate to escape their past.  Yet, the plotlines in the film do not produce the same emotional jolt it did five decades ago.  Extramarital affairs, bullying authority figures, and fallen women are all topics on trivial daytime television shows today.  These mature themes just do not hold your interest anymore when looked at through the veil of time.  When this aspect of the film is removed, what is left is just a routine &quot;day-in-the-lives&quot; story.Yet the film still has many things going for it.  All of the performances are fine:  Sinatra reminds viewers just how talented an actor he was in years past, the chemistry between Lancaster and Kerr is still electric, and Clift turns in another low-key but effective performance.  And even though it's legacy may be slightly diminished, ""From Here to Eternity"" will always be fondly remembered as the film that more than any other made making out at the beach fashionable.",2,"&quot;A man don't go his own way, he's nothing.&quot;",1047081600,"03 8, 2003",2003,2048,"['Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'simply', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'place', 'cinematic', 'history', 'secure', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Oscar', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'embracing', 'surf', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'what', 'was', 'considered', 'adult', 'film', 'back', '1953', 'plays', 'run-of-the-mill', 'soap', 'opera', 'present', 'day.As', 'Sergeant', 'Warden', 'Lancaster', 'Karen', 'Holmes', 'Kerr', 'wife', 'superior', 'start', 'fall', 'love', 'Private', 'Prewitt', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'avoid', 'participating', 'unit', 'boxing', 'championship', 'Prewitt', 'support', 'friend', 'Maggio', 'Sinatra', 'who', 'protect', 'pressures', 'finds', 'love', 'Lorene', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'quot', 'working', 'girl', 'quot', 'who', 'temporarily', 'relocated', 'Hawaii', 'Into', 'mix', 'thrown', 'sadistic', 'warden', 'played', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'bombing', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'involved', 'straight', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'filled', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'desperate', 'are', 'desperate', 'power', 'desperate', 'love', 'desperate', 'acceptance', 'desperate', 'escape', 'past', 'plotlines', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'produce', 'same', 'emotional', 'jolt', 'did', 'five', 'decades', 'ago', 'Extramarital', 'affairs', 'bullying', 'authority', 'figures', 'fallen', 'women', 'are', 'topics', 'trivial', 'daytime', 'television', 'shows', 'today', 'mature', 'themes', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'hold', 'interest', 'anymore', 'when', 'looked', 'veil', 'time', 'When', 'aspect', 'film', 'removed', 'what', 'left', 'just', 'routine', 'quot', 'day-in-the-lives', 'quot', 'film', 'still', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'Sinatra', 'viewers', 'just', 'how', 'talented', 'actor', 'was', 'years', 'past', 'chemistry', 'Lancaster', 'Kerr', 'still', 'electric', 'Clift', 'low-key', 'effective', 'performance', 'even', 'legacy', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'diminished', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'film', 'more', 'other', 'made', 'making', 'out', 'beach', 'fashionable']",N/A

And what a cast: Lancaster a convincing mixture of toughness and emotional vulnerability, a surprisingly sexy Kerr, Donna Reed playing tough against type, Borgnine at his meanest and a wonderful array of character actors. Clift may make an unlikely boxer, but his performance is one of his best, as is that of Sinatra, always under-rated as an actor on those occasions when he made an effort, as his doomed best friend Maggio.With a good DVD transfer, this is let down by the extras - only a teaser trailer, a making-of featurette that runs a full two minutes (!!!), a brief extract from a documentary about the director and an audio commentary by Tim Zinnemann and Alvin Sargent.

The movie is able to stand well enough on it's own without really needing these &quot;features&quot; to back it up and I recommend this DVD version only for that reason.However those who love collectors edition DVD's, especially ones on Oscar flicks may feel slighted. There are two lackluster featurettes. One being a &quot;Making Of&quot; that is more or less a rehash of the production notes found inside of the case. The other focusing on Fred Zinneman, the movie's director, is slighlty more interesting. But both have more footage of the film itself than behind the scenes and both run under ten minutes. What they should have done was combine the two. The Commentary by the son of the director also leaves much to be desired. The only reason why I harp on these is that I know what Columbia is capable of doing better.

Well, being about 13 years old, what did I have to measure it by? At that age, I hadn't been allowed to go to movies, even with my girlfriends.  We sneaked off to see ""From Here To Eternity"". We probably told our parents that we were going to see Bob Hope/Bing Crosby or Gene Autry. (Just a few that I can remember from back then.) Oh, but I remember From Here To Eternity very well. The only other thing was that I fell instantly in love with Montgomery Clift.  But, as all young lovers do, I dropped him a year or so later for James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause.  Turns out, I wouldn't have stood a chance with either one of them since they had those sexual hangups. Oh well. Shortly after that my future and still husband dropped in. I wouldn't have traded him for either one of them.  Oh, I'm suppose to be reviewing the movie.  All of those stars, producers, writers, everyone involved, from the movie made it a great movie. I've seen it many times over the years on TV and still loved it and so I'm positive that I will enjoy having this DVD just as soon as I can get it ordered.  And then I can watch it over and over and reminisce",5,The best movie I ever saw,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,1235,"['can', 'remember', 'movie', '1954/1955', 'was', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'Well', 'being', '13', 'years', 'old', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'measure', 'age', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'allowed', 'go', 'movies', 'even', 'girlfriends', 'sneaked', 'off', 'see', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'probably', 'told', 'parents', 'were', 'going', 'see', 'Bob', 'Hope/Bing', 'Crosby', 'Gene', 'Autry', 'Just', 'few', 'can', 'remember', 'back', 'then', 'Oh', 'remember', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'was', 'fell', 'instantly', 'love', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'young', 'lovers', 'do', 'dropped', 'year', 'so', 'later', 'James', 'Dean', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'stood', 'chance', 'one', 'had', 'sexual', 'hangups', 'Oh', 'well', 'Shortly', 'future', 'still', 'husband', 'dropped', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'traded', 'one', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'suppose', 'be', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'stars', 'producers', 'writers', 'everyone', 'involved', 'movie', 'made', 'great', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'TV', 'still', 'loved', 'so', ""'m"", 'positive', 'will', 'enjoy', 'having', 'DVD', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'get', 'ordered', 'then', 'can', 'watch', 'reminisce']",N/A
