1476528,A1A1WCAIEOBZCR,B005LAIHYU,&#34;DoctorObvious&#34;,"[0, 0]","I'm just going to talk about the digital download for this film, since that was a little tricky.  I actually had to call and talk to a live person at Fox, so hopefully this will help.  If you want to download to iTunes, the steps remind me of a computer equivalent to the multiple doors at the Get Smart headquarters from the old TV show.  First, insert the digital copy disc into your disc drive on your computer.  Second, go to your Computer program and select the DVD and right click and Open. Third, double click on DVDROM.  Fourth, double click to opent Media Manager.  Fifth, at the bottom of the list is MediaManagerII.exe.  Sixth, double click on that and it will open a box for fox digital copy.  There you will have three more steps to follow!  Sixth, enter the code from the DVD insert and then at step 2 pick iTunes for the platform.  Step 3 will give you the actual code you need to enter in iTunes, so copy and paste it into the redemption code box in the iTunes store.  Then, click your heels three times and say ""There's no place like iTunes"" three times.  By then, it should start downloading.I feel like I just completed a successful brain surgery on someone after getting this accomplished.  I'm going to copy and past this review, because the same thing is needed for Prometheus.  Thanks Fox for the telephone support or I would still be getting more grey hair on my head with this.

This may be the case but seeing as how the film's screenplay was written by the author of the book, Seth Grahame-Smith. As a matter of fact he is featured throughout the special features and has the only commentary on the movie. So fans of the book that are upset with the film can go take it up with the author who changed everything.Now that I've said that let me get on to the movie. It was a lot of fun. We so often get watered down, PG-13 bloodless horro flicks. Here we get a full on R rated, violent vampire action flick in the same tone as Blade, but as a period piece. And I must say Benjamin Walker swings a mean axe! I really enjoyed the cast, including Anthony Mackie and Rufus Sewel. The action is visceral and filmed in a way where it's not all about the crazy editing though that's there. I never expected a hsitory lesson from this but I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.Also as a quick note, on Blu-Ray there is a motion comic called the Encounter that is awesome. it's the story of Elizabeth Batheroy as told by one Edgar Allen Poe to his good friend Abe Lincoln.If you like action movies, or vampires, or all of the above you should enjoy this flick.

I think the most offensive thing about the film is that it actually tries to tell a story about our realistic US president Abraham Lincoln actually growing up to become physically powerful and vengeful as a result of his mother being killed, but... it tastelessly centers around vampires.  To me this is incredibly stupid.  It also shows a clear lack of creative ideas on the part of Hollywood.  What's next, RoboCop"" Vampire Hunter?  How about Albert Einstein vs. zombies?  If THIS is what movies have now resorted to, count me out.Anyway it's a major flaw in my opinion to try and write a storyline around the actual real life of Abraham Lincoln but deliberately sabotage it by turning it into a generic vampire-slicing film.  Why bother writing a script when nobody's going to believe it?  Unless you live under a rock and have zero idea who Honest Abe is.  C'mon.  It's not even a horror, and not just because vampires aren't really scary and don't appeal to me it the least.  It's because instead of seeing bucket loads of blood or a pleasant build up of suspense and atmosphere, you're forced to witness intolerable and overused Matrix-style far-fetched killings that just go on and on.

1476586,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B005LAIHYU,Brian Driver,"[0, 0]","If you think movies are made to be enjoyed as action festivals, and thinking is not overly necessary, then this is a film for you. If you have any desires in the way of cerebral movie making, go elsewhere...this is a silly movie that counts on the fact that you'll go for its funny premise, and then it pretty much depends upon stunts and slight historical tie-ins to provide the remaining humor (Alan Tudyk ofDodgeball: A True Underdog Storyas Stephen A. Douglas, for instance).We meet Honest Abe when he witnesses the death of his mother -- of course at the hands of vampire Jack Barts, portrayed by Marton Csokas (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]). This brings about one of the film's conceits: that slave owners are actually vampires, spawned by a vampire named, of course, Adam, played by Rufus Sewell (Dark City,A Knight's Tale) an evil slave owner whom Abe stopped from whipping up on a slave named William Johnson. From then on he battles them, though for the large part of the early film he is the only one who sees them. His tutor in this endeavor is a man named Henry Sturges, played by Dominic Cooper (Captain America: The First Avenger). Naturally, Abe's weapon of choice is -- of course -- an ax? And one with a rifle inside of it.To relate more of the plot is to endeavor in foolish details, but suffice it to say that Abe not only goes on to be POTUS, bu he also leads the Civil War campaign against the South in order to ride the country of vampires...AKA slave owners. Here's where I found the premise to be a little wonky and maybe just a tad offensive; to me, it signified that America's slave owners can be excused from their actions by telling us they were inhabited by demons. Yes, it's just a comedy, but I found this to be pretty rank.What takes place throughout this movie is all cinematic play: stop-action violence where axes and bullets and teeth are all bared in their glory for the sake of the audience. Lest you find yourself taking this too seriously, Abe not only chases the bad guys by literally running along the backs of stampeding horses, but our vampire actually grabs one of the horses by its hoof and swings the horse itself at Abe's head.The vampires have impossibly wide mouths and teeth like stalactites, and they move with a visual flurry that begs even the most forgiving minds. Leaps are not enough: the vampire springs off, grabs a chair, flips it mid-leap, then lands upon its attacker with the legs of the chair pinning their limbs. Such rampant visual imagery is meant to fill the screen with action, but it tends to numb the viewer, as do the constant ""deaths-that-aren't-deaths"" as the profligate vampires go on and on in their almost endless fights.That notwithstanding, ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER is a silly movie that at times tries to dress up in serious clothes, and while it is never outside being tongue-in-cheek, I found it too silly to be serious, and too serious to be funny.It's like going to a Chuck E.

For one reason or another it just doesn't meet expectations. Things get dropped and the can make the movie just plain not as good. What strikes me funny about how bad this movie was is the fact that the author of the novel wrote the screenplay for this. Despite this fact the movie seemed like a loosely based version of the novel. I suppose the movie was more entertaining, the book would probably be more closely similar to a documentary than a blockbuster. It seemed like too many things were changed and dropped though.Another point that bugged me was Abe's superhuman strength and the disregard for the laws of physics. So many scenes in this movies suspended belief. Why did Abe have to have superpowers in the movie? He didn't in the novel and it was perfect, it made sense. Then to watch the movie it just seemed crazy. Why couldn't Abe have just built up his strength? Why the magical?I was very disappointed in this movie.

But they never said anything about vampires... Years before he set off to become one of our nation's greatest leaders, Abraham Lincoln stalked the night in search of the bloodthirsty vampire that took his mother's life. After discovering the dark secret that connects the slave trade to the vampires' food source, Lincoln trades in his axe for a prominent position in politics, where his words serve as a far greater weapon against his undead adversaries. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER brings Seth Grahame-Smith's historic monster mash-up to the screen in a big way, with all of the overblown action sequences and wild special effects that make for fun, over-the-top summer blockbuster. While the deadpan humor may turn off many audience members that were expecting a parody or spoof, what makes it so oddly entertaining is that it isn't a comedy. It is played perfectly straight to the point of absurdity, earning big laughs along the way as Abe twirls his axe with deadly proficiency and carries himself like the Civil War's ""Rambo."" A finer actor couldn't have been chosen over Benjamin Walker, who puts in an excellent performance as the President. The vicious vampires are just as dark as the humor as well, although Rufus Sewell does not present a memorable villain as their leader, Adam. The main issue with the film lies in the aforementioned action sequences, which become far too grandiose for a period piece of this kind. What worked perfectly well in Timur Bekmambetov's earlier films, NIGHT WATCH and DAY WATCH, reduces the imagery on screen to an over-stylized sense of cartoon violence, where a subtler approach would have benefited the character greatly.

The very idea of Queen Victoria slaying werewolves or Abraham Lincoln taking after vampires offends my very historical-based sensibilities. Imagine my surprise therefore to take a chance on this big-screen adaptation of the novel and actually enjoy it.What unfolds over two hours is a movie of more charm than I anticipated, particularly in its delightful depiction of the introduction and courtship of Abe and Mary. Immense changes were made from the novel, which disappoints book fans, but as someone who hasn't read the book, didn't prove problematic. Some of the action scenes are truly jaw-dropping, even if they go in for a touch of the macabre and absurd (one vampire hurtles a horse at Abe, who then promptly rides it in pursuit). The costuming is beautiful, as is the terrific cast, made up of little-known (and some, not so little known) actors. It's an interesting take on ""alternative history,"" with style.Reading reviews, particularly from more conservative sources, I anticipated the film to be bloodier than it really was... either the black blood of vampires doesn't seem as gruesome as most R-rated action films or the stylized manner of shooting the piece diminishes it, because it didn't turn my stomach. It's true that there isn't much characterization, and it almost seems clich&eacute;d to turn a champion of the enslaved into a vampire hunter (the metaphor is evident) but it's something different from what we've seen before, and it may (however indirectly) encourage audiences to read up on the real man, who was far more magnificent than this one, if not as downright cool.",4,I Loved It,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,1766,"['first', 'encounter', 'one', 'new', 'paranormal', 'speculative', 'fiction', 'historical', 'novels', 'was', 'screech', 'halt', 'bookstore', 'threaten', 'shout', 'bloody', 'murder', 'very', 'idea', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'slaying', 'werewolves', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'taking', 'vampires', 'offends', 'very', 'historical-based', 'sensibilities', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'therefore', 'take', 'chance', 'big-screen', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'it.What', 'unfolds', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'more', 'charm', 'anticipated', 'particularly', 'delightful', 'depiction', 'introduction', 'courtship', 'Abe', 'Mary', 'Immense', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'novel', 'book', 'fans', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'prove', 'problematic', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'truly', 'jaw-dropping', 'even', 'go', 'touch', 'macabre', 'absurd', 'one', 'vampire', 'horse', 'Abe', 'who', 'then', 'promptly', 'pursuit', 'costuming', 'beautiful', 'terrific', 'cast', 'made', 'little-known', 'not', 'so', 'little', 'known', 'actors', 'interesting', 'take', 'alternative', 'history', 'style.Reading', 'reviews', 'particularly', 'more', 'conservative', 'sources', 'anticipated', 'film', 'be', 'bloodier', 'really', 'was', 'black', 'blood', 'vampires', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'gruesome', 'most', 'R-rated', 'action', 'films', 'stylized', 'manner', 'shooting', 'piece', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'stomach', 'true', ""n't"", 'much', 'characterization', 'almost', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'turn', 'champion', 'enslaved', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'metaphor', 'evident', 'something', 'different', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'may', 'however', 'indirectly', 'encourage', 'audiences', 'read', 'up', 'real', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'magnificent', 'one', 'not', 'downright', 'cool']",N/A

I'm fully aware that movies of this nature are not meant to be taken seriously and as such, I went into this film purely for the entertainment value. It's just unfortunate that this movie was just middle of the road mediocre.There's some good to this film, mostly in the form of the underused secondary characters and the underdeveloped world of the vampires. I couldn't help but love some of the familiar faces I saw in this, such as Alan Tudyk (Alpha from Dollhouse), and I really wanted to see more of them. I also liked the character of Speed, who was woefully underused. Rufus Sewell does his best to appear somewhat menacing, and is generally the most interesting of the more main characters. I admit, at times I was rooting for him just because he actually had more of a personality than Lincoln did. (And Dominic Cooper well... he made for some awesome eye candy.)The bad is that this film is overly long. It's barely two hours long, but felt like three. There's just long periods of time where the plot just sags and is bogged down by its own weight. The cinematography was nice enough and the 3D was well shot, but if you're looking to see this in 3D, save your money. It's not worth the extra dollars. Other than the occasional fight or special effects-laden scene, most of the film really didn't require 3D and made it more of a gimmick than an asset. I don't mind 3D gimmicks, but considering how expensive 3D can be it's not really worth it.I can't say that this is the worst film ever made. It has parts that redeem it and if it was bad then that would have actually made it that much more entertaining. I think that the filmmakers intended this to have an Ed Wood meets Rocky Horror meets schlockly vampire cinema feel to it, but this just comes across as solidly bland fare. It's not something that I'd tell people never to see, but it is something I'd recommend waiting for the DVD to hit shelves before seeing.Seriously, wait for the DVD and the inevitable RiffTrax soundtrack to synch up with it. I'm pretty sure that this the DVD/Blu-Ray will have some nice features on it and a RedBox rental would be far cheaper.

So, the fictional concept of Lincoln being a vampire hunter in his secret life wasn't first realized in film form, but it is the first time many who aren't familiar with the book became privy to the extreme concept. Some rolled their eyes at the concept, some chuckled and some were intrigued to see how the creators of the book and film could make the fictional secret life of Lincoln feasible.Benjamin Walker, a virtual unknown, is an uncanny likeness to Lincoln and that is definitely one of the great values to the film. The moviemakers couldn't have found a better actor to play the part and as much as he is an unknown, he won't be for long. He definitely held his own. His ability to fight vampires with passion and then become the distinguished gentlemen and amazing public speaker that we are all aware of made believing the secret life that much easier.That being said, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" suffers from the summer blockbuster expectations. Summer blockbusters are usually crammed full with movies with so much cheese and over-the-topness you just want to roll your eyes, and I didn't want to roll my eyes. I wanted the creators of the movies to convince me, as much as I know vampires are as real as fairies and dragons, that this secret life was possible. Most of the movie did a good job of blending known facts with fictional elaboration, but then the creators knew they had to please those that have made guys like Bay, Emmerich & Wiseman filthy rich every summer.Had ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" had a release date outside of the summer blockbuster season, maybe the lowered expectations would have kept them from going off the deep end just to give everybody a slam bam `watch this' finale. After successfully building a reality threshold throughout the film, keeping a nice blend of history and fiction, they destroyed that illusion.I had hoped that ""AL: Vampire Hunter"" would have had more tact than it did. I had hoped that there would have been more intelligence and more history, but there wasn't. Instead, the movie dragged through out, only brush stroking over the things we know as fact about Abraham Lincoln and never delving below the surface. The movie has some merit. As I stated before, Walker is a great Lincoln and the effects were amazing, but the makers should have spent more time maintaining the illusion to the audience that maybe, possibly Lincoln was a vampire slayer. Instead, they left us realizing that it was just another empty summer effects showcase.",2,"Instead of trying to blend with historical reality, they distanced themselves from it",1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,2622,"['Seth', 'Grahame-Smith', 'wrote', 'fictional', 'novel', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'was', 'published', '2010', 'So', 'fictional', 'concept', 'Lincoln', 'being', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'secret', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'realized', 'film', 'form', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'book', 'became', 'privy', 'extreme', 'concept', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'concept', 'chuckled', 'were', 'intrigued', 'see', 'how', 'creators', 'book', 'film', 'could', 'make', 'fictional', 'secret', 'life', 'Lincoln', 'feasible.Benjamin', 'Walker', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'uncanny', 'likeness', 'Lincoln', 'definitely', 'one', 'great', 'values', 'film', 'moviemakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'better', 'actor', 'play', 'part', 'as', 'much', 'unknown', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'long', 'definitely', 'held', 'own', 'ability', 'fight', 'vampires', 'passion', 'then', 'become', 'distinguished', 'gentlemen', 'amazing', 'public', 'speaker', 'are', 'aware', 'made', 'believing', 'secret', 'life', 'much', 'being', 'said', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'suffers', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'expectations', 'Summer', 'blockbusters', 'are', 'usually', 'crammed', 'full', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'cheese', 'over-the-topness', 'just', 'want', 'roll', 'eyes', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'roll', 'eyes', 'wanted', 'creators', 'movies', 'convince', 'as', 'much', 'know', 'vampires', 'are', 'as', 'real', 'fairies', 'dragons', 'secret', 'life', 'was', 'possible', 'Most', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'blending', 'known', 'facts', 'fictional', 'elaboration', 'then', 'creators', 'knew', 'had', 'please', 'have', 'made', 'guys', 'Bay', 'Emmerich', 'Wiseman', 'filthy', 'rich', 'summer.Had', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'had', 'release', 'date', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'season', 'maybe', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'going', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'just', 'give', 'everybody', 'slam', 'bam', 'watch', 'finale', 'successfully', 'building', 'reality', 'threshold', 'film', 'keeping', 'nice', 'blend', 'history', 'fiction', 'destroyed', 'illusion.I', 'had', 'hoped', 'AL', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'tact', 'did', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'intelligence', 'more', 'history', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'movie', 'dragged', 'out', 'only', 'brush', 'stroking', 'things', 'know', 'fact', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'never', 'delving', 'surface', 'movie', 'merit', 'stated', 'Walker', 'great', 'Lincoln', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing', 'makers', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'maintaining', 'illusion', 'audience', 'maybe', 'possibly', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'Instead', 'left', 'realizing', 'was', 'just', 'empty', 'summer', 'effects', 'showcase']",N/A

It seems there is no shortage of vampire movies these days.  The public just cannot get enough of them.  Perhaps there is something about the vampire that is very attractive to people.  I have to admit that this is a most original vampire tale.  The story is wildly imaginative.  I mean, really.  President Abraham Lincoln as a hunter of vampires!  The plot is so outlandish that it actually does work.  But you do have to allow yourself to be won over by the story.  You have to buy into it and allow yourself to get immersed into that world.  It may be easier to think of it as an alternate reality.Young Abraham's mother was killed by a man, who turns out to be a vampire.  Abe grows up, finds the man, and tries to kill him.  Were it not for the intervention of Henry, a seasoned vampire hunter, young Abe would not have survived that first encounter.  Henry, in Obi-Wan Kenobi fashion, proceeds to teach the young Lincoln all he will need to become a vampire killer.  Abe works a normal job during the day, studies for law school, and moonlights as a hunter at night.  Eventually, he enters the political arena and becomes president.  And it just so happens that the South is heavily populated by vampires, who take advantage of slavery to provide them with their meals.  Using slaves like livestock for slaughter allows them to survive without attracting too much attention.  Naturally, they would support Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy during the Civil War.The special effects are terrific.  Production quality is very high.  This is a first-rate, high budget movie.  I highly recommend that you give this movie a chance.  Granted, it will not appeal to everyone.  Like I said, you have to be willing to be won over by the outlandish plot.Watching the Raven and seeing John Cusack play Edgar Allan Poe made it a little easier to accept this film.  I guess it's fashionable to take actual historical figures, and put them in a fictional story like this.  Poe tracking down a serial killer in 19th century Baltimore.  Abe Lincoln hunting down vampires in the South during the years leading up to the Civil War!  Ok, what can we expect to see in the future?  Obama as a Klingon commander?  Bill Clinton as a Jedi master?  George W. Bush as a Time Lord?  I suppose this is all for the good, as long as it's done in good fun.  It can be fun to watch someone like Abe Lincoln as an action hero.  Just watch it for entertainment, get swept into the story, and you will enjoy the movie.  Take the plot too seriously and you will not enjoy it at all.",3,Watch Abe Lincoln kick some . . . . .,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2629,"['Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'one', 'tough', 'dude', 'according', 'premise', 'story', 'shortage', 'vampire', 'movies', 'days', 'public', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'Perhaps', 'something', 'vampire', 'very', 'attractive', 'people', 'have', 'admit', 'most', 'original', 'vampire', 'tale', 'story', 'wildly', 'imaginative', 'mean', 'really', 'President', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'hunter', 'vampires', 'plot', 'so', 'outlandish', 'actually', 'work', 'do', 'have', 'allow', 'be', 'won', 'story', 'have', 'buy', 'allow', 'get', 'immersed', 'world', 'may', 'be', 'easier', 'think', 'alternate', 'reality.Young', 'Abraham', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'vampire', 'Abe', 'up', 'man', 'tries', 'kill', 'Were', 'not', 'intervention', 'Henry', 'seasoned', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'young', 'Abe', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'survived', 'first', 'encounter', 'Henry', 'Obi-Wan', 'Kenobi', 'fashion', 'proceeds', 'teach', 'young', 'Lincoln', 'will', 'need', 'become', 'vampire', 'killer', 'Abe', 'normal', 'job', 'day', 'studies', 'law', 'school', 'moonlights', 'hunter', 'night', 'Eventually', 'political', 'arena', 'president', 'just', 'so', 'South', 'heavily', 'populated', 'vampires', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'slavery', 'provide', 'meals', 'Using', 'slaves', 'livestock', 'slaughter', 'survive', 'attracting', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'Naturally', 'would', 'support', 'Jefferson', 'Davis', 'Confederacy', 'Civil', 'War.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'terrific', 'Production', 'quality', 'very', 'high', 'first-rate', 'high', 'budget', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'Granted', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'said', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'be', 'won', 'outlandish', 'plot.Watching', 'Raven', 'seeing', 'John', 'Cusack', 'play', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'made', 'little', 'easier', 'accept', 'film', 'guess', 'fashionable', 'take', 'actual', 'historical', 'figures', 'put', 'fictional', 'story', 'Poe', 'tracking', 'down', 'serial', 'killer', '19th', 'century', 'Baltimore', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'hunting', 'down', 'vampires', 'South', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'Civil', 'War', 'Ok', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'see', 'future', 'Obama', 'Klingon', 'commander', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Jedi', 'master', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'Time', 'Lord', 'suppose', 'good', 'as', 'long', 'done', 'good', 'fun', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'someone', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'action', 'hero', 'Just', 'watch', 'entertainment', 'get', 'swept', 'story', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Take', 'plot', 'too', 'seriously', 'will', 'not', 'enjoy']",N/A

1476627,A27F1WYCM6IEYH,B005LAIHYU,Colten,"[0, 0]","In a year that also brought filmgoers another serious, high-minded Lincoln film full of award-ready performances and lofty ideas, the notion of Abe slaying vampires is a perfectly fun and welcome basis for big, summer-blockbuster silliness.However, screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith, producer Tim Burton, and most of all director Timur Bekmambetov take their Van Helsing version of Lincoln far too seriously, treating the vamp-dusting proceedings not like a cheesy, campy flick, but an essay prompt on a social studies exam. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter opens with a solemn quote from the Book of Genesis when it would have been better off taking a page from Roger Corman. Cleaved of a sense of tongue-in-cheek camp or humor, the film that follows is smothered in faux nobility as the Great Emancipator mows down bloodsuckers with grim determination.Bekmambetov's never been a model of stylistic restraint. First with the spastic Russian fantasy-action epics Night Watch and Day Watch and then in Hollywood's Wanted, the director explored new ways of making his ADD-edited action films feel ponderous despite his trademark visual seizures and penchant for slo-mo, sped-up, slow-again action shots. That leaves Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, a film full of restless kinetic energy but no juice. There is an intentional artifice to Bekmambetov's cinema that gives it a faded one-dimensionality, as if his films are grim lithographs. They are full of spraying blood, but no beating heart, with no room for humanity amid the arch monochromatic tableaux.The director's much-ballyhooed fight visuals are impressive in small doses, and he can execute a dazzling batch of shots, but there is no grasp of scene, and the CGI-staged stunts have no emotional heft - they are just eye-popping tricks lacking a gut-punch. All is constant titillation with no giggling exploitation flavor - it is spectacle and sensation, epic chintz and chutzpah, none of it making much sense. Bekmambetov loves to pan over iconography, from stovepipe hats to the Washington Monument, but his characters feel as though they are also carved in the sides of granite tombs, frozen forever astride destiny but not really going anywhere. It is not the best approach for a film that must already carefully straddle and draw cinematic friction from two very different genres.As Abe, Benjamin Walker keeps striving for charisma beneath the top hat, but is continually interrupted by training montages in which he leans to twirl his silver-edged ax. And Mary Elizabeth Winstead also does her best as a coquettish Mary Todd, but the moment she and Walker start to fan flames of courtship chemistry, Bekmambetov yanks Abe back to work at the frenzied, nonsensical vampire slaying. The cast is rounded out by Rufus Sewell easily tossing off snooty, aristocratic villainy without spilling his brandy. But as Abe's mysterious mentor in the vamp-combat arts, the very talented Dominic Cooper seems further doomed to play supporting characters in Hollywood fantasies. Anthony Mackie and Jimmi Simpson are also on hand as a couple of Lincoln's long-time compatriots.As with so much Hollywood escapism these days, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter mistakes premise for plot - disjointed and scattershot, the film feels fuller of ideas than sense. About two-thirds of the way through, having run out of things to do, Abraham Lincoln gives up on having the Young Man with an Ax routine and rushes through Lincoln's political rise - the narrative economy no doubt encouraged by a disappointing lack of beheading during the Lincoln-Douglas debates.Suddenly, the film arrives at the Civil War and Gettysburg where Bekmambetov plays at historical melodrama, slapping awkward faux glory on civil war scenes. There are also attempts throughout to blame the Southern slavery culture on vampires, which might be offensive if the filmmakers cared about what they were saying. Offensive or not, played the right way, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter could have been howling, eye-rolling fun. But Bekmambetov cannot figure out how to wink at his audience through the deadpan, and so the film feels so much duller than its catchy title promises.",1,Among Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's problems - and they are legion - is not its inherently goofy hook: The 16th president sp,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,4181,"['year', 'also', 'brought', 'filmgoers', 'serious', 'high-minded', 'Lincoln', 'film', 'full', 'award-ready', 'performances', 'lofty', 'ideas', 'notion', 'Abe', 'slaying', 'vampires', 'perfectly', 'fun', 'welcome', 'basis', 'big', 'summer-blockbuster', 'silliness.However', 'screenwriter', 'Seth', 'Grahame-Smith', 'producer', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'most', 'director', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', 'take', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'version', 'Lincoln', 'far', 'too', 'seriously', 'treating', 'vamp-dusting', 'proceedings', 'not', 'cheesy', 'campy', 'flick', 'essay', 'prompt', 'social', 'studies', 'exam', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'solemn', 'quote', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'taking', 'page', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'Cleaved', 'sense', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'camp', 'humor', 'film', 'smothered', 'faux', 'nobility', 'Great', 'Emancipator', 'down', 'bloodsuckers', 'grim', 'determination.Bekmambetov', 'never', 'been', 'model', 'stylistic', 'restraint', 'First', 'spastic', 'Russian', 'fantasy-action', 'epics', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Day', 'Watch', 'then', 'Hollywood', 'Wanted', 'director', 'explored', 'new', 'ways', 'making', 'ADD-edited', 'action', 'films', 'feel', 'ponderous', 'trademark', 'visual', 'seizures', 'penchant', 'slo-mo', 'sped-up', 'slow-again', 'action', 'shots', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'film', 'full', 'restless', 'kinetic', 'energy', 'juice', 'intentional', 'artifice', 'Bekmambetov', 'cinema', 'faded', 'one-dimensionality', 'films', 'are', 'grim', 'lithographs', 'are', 'full', 'spraying', 'blood', 'beating', 'heart', 'room', 'humanity', 'arch', 'monochromatic', 'tableaux.The', 'director', 'much-ballyhooed', 'fight', 'visuals', 'are', 'impressive', 'small', 'doses', 'can', 'execute', 'dazzling', 'batch', 'shots', 'grasp', 'scene', 'CGI-staged', 'stunts', 'have', 'emotional', 'heft', 'are', 'just', 'eye-popping', 'tricks', 'lacking', 'gut-punch', 'constant', 'titillation', 'giggling', 'exploitation', 'flavor', 'spectacle', 'sensation', 'chintz', 'chutzpah', 'none', 'making', 'much', 'sense', 'Bekmambetov', 'pan', 'iconography', 'stovepipe', 'hats', 'Washington', 'Monument', 'characters', 'feel', 'are', 'also', 'carved', 'sides', 'granite', 'tombs', 'frozen', 'forever', 'astride', 'destiny', 'not', 'really', 'going', 'anywhere', 'not', 'best', 'approach', 'film', 'must', 'already', 'carefully', 'straddle', 'draw', 'cinematic', 'friction', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'genres.As', 'Abe', 'Benjamin', 'Walker', 'striving', 'charisma', 'top', 'hat', 'continually', 'interrupted', 'training', 'montages', 'twirl', 'silver-edged', 'ax', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'also', 'best', 'coquettish', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'moment', 'Walker', 'start', 'fan', 'flames', 'courtship', 'chemistry', 'Bekmambetov', 'Abe', 'back', 'work', 'frenzied', 'nonsensical', 'vampire', 'slaying', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'easily', 'tossing', 'off', 'snooty', 'aristocratic', 'villainy', 'spilling', 'brandy', 'Abe', 'mysterious', 'mentor', 'vamp-combat', 'arts', 'very', 'talented', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'further', 'doomed', 'play', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Hollywood', 'fantasies', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Jimmi', 'Simpson', 'are', 'also', 'hand', 'couple', 'Lincoln', 'long-time', 'compatriots.As', 'so', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'escapism', 'days', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'mistakes', 'premise', 'plot', 'disjointed', 'scattershot', 'film', 'feels', 'fuller', 'ideas', 'sense', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'having', 'run', 'things', 'do', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'up', 'having', 'Young', 'Man', 'Ax', 'routine', 'rushes', 'Lincoln', 'political', 'rise', 'narrative', 'economy', 'doubt', 'encouraged', 'disappointing', 'lack', 'beheading', 'Lincoln-Douglas', 'debates.Suddenly', 'film', 'Civil', 'War', 'Gettysburg', 'where', 'Bekmambetov', 'historical', 'melodrama', 'slapping', 'awkward', 'faux', 'glory', 'civil', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'attempts', 'blame', 'Southern', 'slavery', 'culture', 'vampires', 'might', 'be', 'offensive', 'filmmakers', 'cared', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'Offensive', 'not', 'played', 'right', 'way', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'howling', 'eye-rolling', 'fun', 'Bekmambetov', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'wink', 'audience', 'deadpan', 'so', 'film', 'feels', 'so', 'much', 'duller', 'catchy', 'title', 'promises']",N/A

1476633,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIHYU,C. Sawin,"[2, 5]","Timur Bekmambetov, a screenwriter, producer, and director, was born in Kazakhstan and is perhaps known best for the Russian action films ""Nightwatch"" and ""Daywatch"" and the bullet-bending spectacular ""Wanted."" Bekmambetov is notorious for taking what is usually a really farfetched concept and making it way more enjoyable than it probably should be. So it was no surprise when it was announced he'd be the one tackling ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" because the absurdity of that story is directly in the title. But what makes even less sense is how good ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" turned out to actually be.Being unfamiliar with Benjamin Walker made any sort of expectations for his performance tilt like a faulty pinball machine. However his supporting cast would prove to be extraordinary. With the likes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Scott Pilgrim Vs the World,"" ""The Thing""), Dominic Cooper (""The Devil's Double,"" ""Captain America: The First Avenger""), Rufus Sewell (""Dark City,"" ""The Illusionist""), Marton Csokas (""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" ""xXx""), and a brief appearance by Alan Tudyk (""Serenity,"" ""3:10 to Yuma"") this movie was in extremely good hands when it came to actors. Within moments, Walker is able to pull you into his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln as well. It's mostly driven by his thirst for vengeance and him being torn between telling the truth to his soon to be wife Mary Todd (Winstead) and hiding it all from her in an attempt to keep her safe.The movie thrives on unbelievable action sequences. Abe chops down a tree with a single blow early on. He then goes on to catch a blade in his mouth while hanging upside down and slits a vampires throat before bending himself in half and cutting the rope from his feet. There's always this sense of impossibility to nearly every big action sequence in the movie and yet it somehow makes it all a little more entertaining. One of the greatest sequences in the film is this montage of Abe fighting several vampires that heightens with him shoving the face of one into a fire pit and holding it there while Abe uses one of those old fashioned air pumps to make the fire grow. Then the movie switches gears suddenly and Abe is shown nodding off at a picnic with Mary Todd who's a tad upset he's fallen asleep in the first place.Bekmambetov seems to muck up action sequences more often than not. What your brain is able to process is outstanding and is pretty much exactly what your inner action junkie so desperately craves. There were times during things like the horse stampede action sequence and several of the gory vampire slayings where legitimate goosebumps were present. But the rest of the time, you can't really tell just what in the world is going on.

I suspended disbelief and mentally prepared myself that I was about to watch a movie featuring such an outrageous, fantastical story that was going to be anathema to the actual historical Abe Lincoln--that I was about to be presented with utter nonsense.  And to be fair, ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER is well-made, from its in-depth cinematography to impressive sets and costumes to spare-no-expense special effects; the filmmakers definitely cut no corners.  But still. . .in spite of all my efforts not to smirk, roll my eyes, or just burst into hysterical laughter, this clucker is so inane and brain-dead stupid I found myself rapidly doing all of the above.Who knew the Civil War was fought so vampires could have their own country?  To Hades with slavery; slaves were mere food for the evil Southern vampires.  And since his mother was killed by a bloodsucker when Honest Abe (who, it turns out, is not so honest) was a boy, the rail-splitting soon-to-be politician has been hacking vamps to smithereens with his silver-plated ax (which also doubles as a shotgun for those most opportune times).  And what's the lone weapon that can kill an army of Southern vampires?  Silver bullets!  So President Abe has every piece of silver in Washington melted down and molded into bullets, hauling the payload himself via rail to Gettysburg--and fighting four score of vampires en route.  There.  Just had a good belly laugh as I wrote this.  And naturally, as it's only fitting for a movie so outrageously over the top, once the vamps decide it's feeding time their mouths and fangs grow to piranha proportions.  Those changes created the most laughs for me.  Funny stuff.  The cast, except for a bored looking Rufus Sewell, is totally forgettable; there are even attempts to present Lincoln the speechmaker in a serious tone that backfire profusely.  If you like good horror ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER falls short; if you like a riveting story ABRAHAM LINCOLN:  VAMPIRE HUNTER falls even shorter.

A friend and I went to see this last evening; the picture played to an almost packed house.  We did not stay for the ending; I had already read about that somewhere else.It's one thing to construct any movie and take liberties with it.  ""Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" did that--and then some.  It was certainly a new idea to add that the South was winning the Civil War because they had vampires fighting in their armies.  These vampires could also become invisible and were ""day walkers,"" something that wasn't thought possible until the ""Blade"" series.  The movie opens with young Abe watching his mother die at the hands of a wretched vampire, his pursuit of said vampire, which almost costs him his life, his education by another person in the fine art of hunting and killing vampires, his pursuing both Mary Todd and aspirations of a political career, right on through his presidency.  In the movie, Mary Todd was a real looker--and almost as tall as Lincoln.  Talk about blurring the line between real and unreal...ALVH lacked soul; the actors went through the motions, but because the writers wanted to weigh down EVERY scene with needless drama, what could have been played (well) as camp, was played way too seriously.  Even the final battle between the bad boy vampire (played by Rufus Sewell) was like, ho-hum.  All the kills were CGI, which I also didn't care for.  And the drama...OH, the DRAMA.

Actually it is a good ""companion"" movie to academy award nominated ""Lincoln"" in that ""Lincoln"" provides a history-refresher that will prep the viewer for this movie. It's interesting to see that the two follow roughly the same period and events. A couple of differences with ALVH is that it starts when Lincoln was a boy and, of course, unlike in Lincoln, in ALVH the troubles he faces in terms of his personal woes and political challenges are largely due to a small but vibrant and quite nasty vampire population.As in any good vampire movie there is the morally conflicted vampire (I won't say who that is) who the rest on the eternal-beings despise. Sure he has to live off human blood, but he is at least more discriminate in his choice of victims, picking low-life scums the type that cruelly prey on defenseless women.This movie is extremely clever in weaving the historic story and vampire legend into one film. There is a ton of violence, guts, gore and black and red blood in this movie. The fight scenes are elaborate, well choreographed, and rather artistic. The actors are fully committed to their roles, the friend and romance chemistry between them is wonderful, and you do ache in this movie for the down trodden to succeed.As a lover of smart, original, off-beat, well-acted films with excellent cinematography this easily could have been a five star film for me. The one area where if falls short, in my opinion, is squandering the opportunity to weave one key historical event into the fabric of the vampire story.

The murder of his mother leads Abraham to seek revenge, only to discover the slave trader is much more of a monster than he had imagined.  Lincoln survives the encounter and is taken under the wing of a mysterious stranger, who trains him in the art of killing vampires.Lincoln's hatred of vampires follows him deep into the Civil War.  The crisis of the Battle of Gettysburg prompts the President and a small circle of friends to mount a special operation to win the battle and defeat the vampires, who, naturally, are Confederate slaveholders...""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" features some gorgeous special effects, which in turn enable some mind-blowing martial arts action, along with a truly spectacular concluding dramatic sequence aboard a train.

Tim Burton, 2012, 105 minutes) was the typical vampire actioner that I more than half expected it to be - and very little else.Abraham Lincoln (a curiously hunky Benjamin Walker, I say, because Lincoln was by no means handsome) is revealed to have a most surprising history: his family has tangled with vampires since his boyhood. Seeking to kill the vampire who murdered his mother, Lincoln attracts the attention of a renegade vampire (Dominic Cooper, looking a lot less hunky than usual but then he is 'undead'). This vampire trains Lincoln to tap into some weird and mysterious superhuman strength that I still cannot fathom - the film says the source of the strength is ""truth"".That drew an immediate laugh from me, and laughing is not something a film like this should bring to an audience at that point in the story. Then again, this film is far inferior to the enjoyable and almost believableAbraham Lincoln vs. Zombies(see my review), which the sneaky Asylum Productions managed to release before this movie got out - and I am the happier for it. Moreover, I recommend the zombie film over this. What weird things Hollyweird does to us: I, a lifelong and devout vampire film fan and hater of zombie anything, steering you away from this to the zombie version of the story 'borrowed' by Asylum. Yet it is far better than this.It isn't clear what a goodly part of this country will feel about the Confederacy being made up of many, many vampires. While Bill Oberst portrayed a stunning, realistic Lincoln inAbraham Lincoln vs. Zombies, Walker is hardly credible and often approaches being a joke. Playing Lincoln as a clumsy halfwit doesn't help, and the history is atrocious. In other words, good cinematic money down the toilet in this case - though the effects are eye-popping, I do not watch even this caliber film only to have my eyes popped. The usually impressive Rufus Sewell had what amounts to a ""repeated cameo"" as I call this - he's a cardboard cutout. When his character spoke of watching the Hebrews build Egypt with his own eyes, I couldn't even believe he's seen what Sewell has seen, let alone all of recorded history!What I loved most about the entire concept, found in abundance with skill and wit inAbraham Lincoln vs. Zombies, is the way this could have been skillfully intertwined with history. Lincoln could have been ""explained"" the way they did it in the zombie film - which I have to say actually drew tears from my eyes because of the way Lincoln and the zombies are explained.As I said, VAMPIRE HUNTER only made me laugh - and this from a totally humorless film to boot. My recommendation is to see this film first, then seeAbraham Lincoln vs. Zombies. That way you won't be let down quite so much - but you will be let down by this no matter what.",3,People remember the bad and forget the lousy ... a 3rd star for fx,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,2872,"['ABRAHAM', 'LINCOLN', 'VAMPIRE', 'HUNTER', 'Writ', 'Seth', 'Grahame-Smith', 'Dir', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', 'Prod', 'Tim', 'Burton', '2012', '105', 'minutes', 'was', 'typical', 'vampire', 'actioner', 'more', 'half', 'expected', 'be', 'very', 'little', 'else.Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'curiously', 'hunky', 'Benjamin', 'Walker', 'say', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'means', 'handsome', 'revealed', 'have', 'most', 'surprising', 'history', 'family', 'tangled', 'vampires', 'boyhood', 'Seeking', 'kill', 'vampire', 'who', 'murdered', 'mother', 'Lincoln', 'attention', 'renegade', 'vampire', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'looking', 'lot', 'less', 'hunky', 'usual', 'then', ""'undead"", 'vampire', 'Lincoln', 'tap', 'weird', 'mysterious', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'film', 'source', 'strength', 'truth', 'drew', 'immediate', 'laugh', 'laughing', 'not', 'something', 'film', 'should', 'bring', 'audience', 'point', 'story', 'Then', 'again', 'film', 'far', 'inferior', 'enjoyable', 'almost', 'believableAbraham', 'Lincoln', 'vs.', 'Zombies', 'see', 'review', 'sneaky', 'Asylum', 'Productions', 'managed', 'release', 'movie', 'got', 'out', 'am', 'happier', 'Moreover', 'recommend', 'zombie', 'film', 'What', 'weird', 'things', 'Hollyweird', 'lifelong', 'devout', 'vampire', 'film', 'fan', 'hater', 'zombie', 'anything', 'steering', 'away', 'zombie', 'version', 'story', ""'borrowed"", 'Asylum', 'far', 'better', 'this.It', ""n't"", 'clear', 'what', 'goodly', 'part', 'country', 'will', 'feel', 'Confederacy', 'being', 'made', 'many', 'many', 'vampires', 'Bill', 'Oberst', 'portrayed', 'stunning', 'realistic', 'Lincoln', 'inAbraham', 'Lincoln', 'vs.', 'Zombies', 'Walker', 'hardly', 'credible', 'often', 'being', 'joke', 'Playing', 'Lincoln', 'clumsy', 'halfwit', ""n't"", 'help', 'history', 'atrocious', 'other', 'words', 'good', 'cinematic', 'money', 'down', 'toilet', 'case', 'effects', 'are', 'eye-popping', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'even', 'caliber', 'film', 'only', 'have', 'eyes', 'popped', 'usually', 'impressive', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'had', 'what', 'amounts', 'repeated', 'cameo', 'call', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'When', 'character', 'spoke', 'watching', 'Hebrews', 'build', 'Egypt', 'own', 'eyes', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'seen', 'what', 'Sewell', 'seen', 'let', 'alone', 'recorded', 'history', 'What', 'loved', 'most', 'entire', 'concept', 'found', 'abundance', 'skill', 'wit', 'inAbraham', 'Lincoln', 'vs.', 'Zombies', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'skillfully', 'intertwined', 'history', 'Lincoln', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'way', 'did', 'zombie', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'actually', 'drew', 'tears', 'eyes', 'way', 'Lincoln', 'zombies', 'are', 'explained.As', 'said', 'VAMPIRE', 'HUNTER', 'only', 'made', 'totally', 'humorless', 'film', 'boot', 'recommendation', 'see', 'film', 'first', 'then', 'seeAbraham', 'Lincoln', 'vs.', 'Zombies', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'let', 'down', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'matter', 'what']",N/A

Worth noting for people who are bothered by that sort of thing.The core conceit of this move is patently absurd. One either accepts that going in or just doesn't go to see it. If I was to aim a single criticism at the movie though it would be that it doesn't fully embrace that absurdity.Sometimes it does. There are some epic moments involving silver forks being shot from a canon and young Lincoln leaping from horseback to horseback. But then it goes and gets serious and wants to talk slavery.Still there is a lot of fun to be had. Who doesn't want to see Abraham Lincoln decapitating and maiming the undead in as many different ways as the director can conceive?My second criticism is that the director gets a little too full of his artistic prowess and it's distracting. Animation is thrust into the middle of the film when it's utterly unnecessary, we get endless slow-mo segments and some scenes (particularly the horse stampede scene) where it's really hard to tell what is going on.

Too many critics are complaining that they did not stick with history or are ignoring history. Really? The film is called Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter...Did you expect anything else.The story is the basic story of revenge. At a young age, Abe makes his first contact with vampires witnessing the death of a loved one. For years revenge stirs in his heart until finally he decides to do something about it. He confronts the vampire but quickly starts losing the fight until a vampire hunter saves him and sets his life path towards hunting vampires.The story is a simple tale of revenge with a heavy dose of blood and dead vampires. A little of history is sprinkled in with an original retelling of some of the great events in Lincoln's life and history in general.The actors/actresses in the film held their own. There aren't any academy awards in this movie but that isn't to say the acting was poor. It was sufficient for a dark vampire hunting movie.The special affects were enjoyable and well done.In the end this is a great summer movie that will entertain you. Those of you that are not obsessed with history and MUST have all historical portrayals be 100% accurate will indeed enjoy how history was re-imagined in the scope of Lincoln being a vampire hunter.

Wait I know, he has battled Vampires and Zombies for most of his life, its fact. I guess you dear reader had no idea about that did you? No you didn't, because it is one of the many government cover ups that are out there. Why did they never tell you about this? Well almost all of you would most certainly panic. Alas, now you know, but for today we will only discuss his many vampire escapades.You see when Abe was but a boy he witnessed his mother killed by a man who his father had worked for. History, or is that secret history has gone on to document that a young Abe would years later attempt to kill the very man who murdered his mother. As it turns out this man was indeed a creature of the night, a vampire. Naturally Abe had no chance against such a beast and was on his way to certain death. But as luck would have it a man named Henry Sturges was on hand to aid young Abe. They were not able to kill the vamp but they did come to an agreement. Henry would train Abe to hunt and kill vampires if Abe did exactly what he would say.So time would go on, how much time we are not sure but enough went by to make Abe a vampire killing machine. He hunted them down one at a time looking to finally one day find you know who. I am sure you all know about his wife and how they met, his years working towards politics and of course becoming the President. Well during that time he went in and out of vampire slaying including at terrifying night spent on a train. Now I could go on and on with this historically accurate report, or I could say watch this Biopic.Based on Honest Abe's honest biography by Seth Grahame-Smith who also wrote the script this Tim Burton produced flick is very fun. The look of the film and over all B movie feel only adds to the appeal of the flick. Director Timur Bekmambetov really knows how to shoot action as I am sure anyone who has seen his other films knows. It is these scenes that really drive the movie and push the pace. In fact it makes it feel like the movie could have been longer or at least moved slower at times. Also the final battle between Abe and lead vamp could have been a bit longer for entertainment value, but I am sure this version was the accurate account. Regardless I did like this movie and found it to be very entertaining and historically accurate.Still I have to say the movie was fun and the performances were just as good. Also I must admit that I really liked the end of the film and I really mean the end as in last scene. It involves Henry and well you will see what I am talking about. I was always a sucker for those types of scenes, once again after viewing you will see what I mean. The Blu-Ray is excellent coming with all kinds of special features. My favorite being the making of which goes into great detail about everything involving the film. Then of course the commentary by the writer is very interesting. There is much more that only make this release a must have for film buffs who enjoy the behind the scenes stuff.

Have a serious subject overlaid by a monster mash! To say this film is total crap is being way too kind! Few Americans study American history, yet alone world history, being too busy watching football and sing-alongs on TV. Since this is the only war ever fought on American soil, you owe it to yourself to study it, visit some of the actual battlefields and realize what actually happened. 620,000 American boys (both Blue and Gray) died in the Civil War, basically for no reason whatsoever. The war had absolutely nothing to do with freeing the Black Man from slavery. Ninety-five percent of Northern and Southern troops had no idea why they were fighting each other (and dying) and were only following orders of the officers of the New W*rld Ord*r (both sides graduated from the same class at West Point) who were directing them to die. The war was actually about exterminating as many White Christians as possible (on both sides). The northern manufacturers were of course pissed that the southern plantation owners were making money off a primarily labor-intensive agricultural base (slaves), but it was about the money...not humanity. Blacks today in the South make minimum wage, but there is little to thank the Civil War for (remembering that the great majority of the boys who died in it were White Christians!). Blacks who moved in exodus to the North were not wanted, were channeled either into the Army (to fight the Indians) or into putrid lives within the manufacturing sector. So the war just murdered almost a million innocent boys for the Power Elite to make more profit, remembering that wars are VERY profitable for the select few.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VAMPIRE HUNTER, I think, would've hugely benefited from a more tongue-in-cheek approach. I mean, there's already a built-in sense of the ridiculous just from the notion of our illustrious 16th President chopping down entire bevies of vampires with his trusty axe. But, for whatever reason, this film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's hit mash-up novel opts for a more somber presentation. Grahame-Smith himself wrote the screenplay so you can't even rant that this isn't the author's vision. This was one of the summer flicks I was looking forward to. Yikes.Honest Abe? No, not quite. There were dark secrets Abraham Lincoln firmly kept under his signature stove top hat. In this wild alternate biography, the narrative posits that not only was Abraham Lincoln the Great Emancipator, he also saved humanity from a relentless vampire incursion. To quote Lincoln's voiceover narration: ""History prefers legends to men... However history remembers me before I was a President, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth..."" The film opens in Pigeon Creek, Indiana, in the year 1818, when Abraham was a young lad, as we learn the horrifying origins of his lifelong obsession with hunting and destroying vampires. From there the film skips ahead to Abe as a young man (now played by Benjamin Walker) as he miserably fails in his first stab at vampire slaying. Enter Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), enigmatic vampire expert who takes the inexperienced Abe under his wing and trains him in the art of tracking and snuffing out them malevolent creatures of the night. Cue the ridiculous(ly fun) training montage and the edge of Abe's favorite axe getting treated with silver, never mind that silver is notoriously the werewolf's bane, not the vampire's.Abe should've known better than to mix his politics with his vampire slaying. But fate has tapped Abe for bigger and better things. I know we stepped into the theater mostly to eyeball Abe taking out vampires, but, for the sake of some verisimilitude and as grounding support, I wish that the film had been more eloquent in depicting this most iconic of figures. I wish it had gone more into exhibiting Lincoln's statesmanship, that his orations were delivered with more conviction, that Benjamin Walker had fleshed out his role more convincingly and with more weight and charisma. The film pays lip service to the historical moments in Lincoln's life. Really, these moments only serve as framing points for the CG-heavy action sequences and to occasionally remind the audience that, hey, in case you forgot, this is the freakin' 16th President. Look, there's the Gettysburg address.I love, love, love those sequences in which Abe was dropping the mighty axe on the bloodsuckers. There is some amazing stunt work being done with the axe (lots of fancy axe twirling). The CG is very prominent, and I don't know that that horse stampede sequence is at all believable. Going in, I was keenly anticipating this film. The premise just made me happy. So I'm not sure what happened. Maybe Russian director Timur Bekmambetov is too mired in grand and heavy-handed mythology-building to make time and space for a wink of the eye, a nudge in the ribs. But this film could've done with a bright sense of fun. All that dramatic brooding eventually wears you down. Just as bad, the acting performances generally don't rise above the cripplingly solemn script, although I do think that Dominic Cooper turns in some pretty terrific scenes (I like his flashback story). There's also a reverse twist near the end which I didn't see coming, that I enjoyed.I do like the film's interpretation of the vampires. It's interesting that no vampire can kill another, that they vanish and then resurface in a terrifying blink. And with judicious dabs of sun balm, they even participate in the Civil War.Abe Lincoln as vampire slayer is just badasss. His action hero creds kept elevating as he relentlessly mowed down four score and seven (and more) of the undead. In fact, he comes off as so indomitable that, after a while, you stop treating him like a real character. You stop worrying about him. Ultimately, he's just one in a number of paper-thin characters inhabiting this movie. Benjamin Walker, unknown actor, has great physical presence but no gravitas. He fails to deliver on those emotional beats. He has zero chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays his love interest, Mary Todd. Walker doesn't really look like the Lincoln we're familiar with until around the third act. As revisionist histories go, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, VAMPIRE HUNTER falls victim to clunky storytelling and one-dimensional characterization but is buoyed by the well-executed action flourishes. There is a fun element of camp, yes, but an even stronger dose of cheekiness could've gone a long way. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",3,"stove top hat and silver-tipped axe - it must be Abe Lincoln, covert

A little hope was restored when I saw that Timur Bekmambetov was directing and that Tim Burton was producing...I am a long time fan of Tim Burton, and I very much enjoyed Timur's movies Wanted and 9.  There were other bigger movies around that time that I was wanting to see in the theater, so I decided I'd compromise anad wait & see this at a local dollar theater instead, which I finally got around to doing.Though I think a couple of things were over done and there were a couple of kinda cheesy parts, I must admit that this movie was actually better than I had expected it to be...a great blending of history and fantasy/horror!  The characters were, for the most part, pretty believable.  The special effects were overall pretty well done, spare maybe a couple of parts, and the concept was actually pretty neat.  I do understand that this movie was based off the book of the same name by Seth Grahamme-Smith, and it makes me hopeful that maybe they'll actually make a movie based off his other popular book Pride Prejudice and Zombies...and I'm not even a Pride and Prejudice kind of person, though I do love zombie films.In any case, if you've enjoyed any of Timur Bekmambetov & Tim Burton's movies in the past, I would highly suggest checking this movie out, because it was honestly pretty good...not, I would say, my absolute favorite movie of the summer, but still pretty dang entertaining.

Barts prepares to beat a young African American boy William Johnson. Young Abe jumps to his defense and in the course, gets his family fired.That night, Barts, who is a vampire, comes into the Lincoln home and poisons Abe's sleeping mother.Lincoln grows older with one thought on his mind to kills Barts. He attacks him one night only to discover his enemy has superior power. Abe is saved by Henry Sturges.Sturges tells the young vengeful man about Barts being a vampire and volunteers to teach Abe how to become a vampire hunter. He explains all vampires descended from Adam, a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans.

When I grew up we were taught about Abraham Lincoln in such a way as to believe he was the epitome of the most honest and strong leader we ever had in some of the most difficult times our country has ever endured.  The twist in this movie still portrays Abe in a similar light but also one in which he is one of the few humans who knows about vampires and one of the even fewer who is a vampire hunter/slayer.The twist in the civil war is that it is not just a battle to free the slaves but to free them from the vampires who rule the south.  If the South wins we become a nation ruled by vampires and if the North wins we become a nation ruled by humans.  The special effects are good and the acting is not bad.

1476805,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B005LAIHYU,John's Horror Corner,"[77, 95]","Director Timur Bekmambetov is a veteran of exaggerated action and genre-splitting fang flicks, having directed Night Watch (2004), Day Watch (2006) and Wanted (2008).  In addition to some of those he has produced The Darkest Hour (2011), Apollo 18 (2011) and the possible Wanted 2 (????).  He picks weird projects and visually supplements them in unexpected and often impressive (though also often ridiculous) ways.  He's a creative guy and, in general, I'm pleased with his work--including his latest: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.Our story begins by weaving motive.  Young Abraham witnesses the death of his mother at the hand of a vampire.  From that day into adulthood, Abraham (Benjamin Walker in his first major role and looking like a young Liam Neeson) seeks revenge against that vampire, but hates them all.Honest Abe is trained by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who is as un-Yoda-like as it gets complete with rigid rules, a temper and a penchant for exterminating all vampires.  One must wonder why.  Of course, there's a story there, the explanation of which would spoil the movie.  He is backed by his best friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie), a freeborn black man who has some unexplained skill for martial arts (in a time when it was generally unknown to the West) and axe-spinning (even though he lacked Sturgess' Jedi tutelage).Abe marries Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), with whom he shares a life veiled from the truth behind his night life and political ambitions.  In fact, this is where knowing some simple history gets fun.  You'll grin as you see political campaigns and war tactics steered by anti-vampire stratagem.Our vampiric antagonist is effectively portrayed by professional villain Rufus Sewell.  As Adam, the 5000-year old maker of all vampires, Sewell is cold and enjoyably hatable.  He leads the Confederate vampires of the South in their invasion of the North in the Civil War.  His personal cadre enjoys the bedazzling company of Vadoma (played by newcomer/model Erin Wasson, who already looked rather vampy before doing this movie).  She plays her simple part well and I hope to see more of her in more challenging roles.The movie ends with a brief present day scene which smacks of Interview with a Vampire's ""I'm going to give you the choice that I never had.""  An endearing nod, but not without a little eye-rolling to accompany my acknowledgement--not that this was the only time in the movie when that happened.THE SETS:  Now, I only noticed this because I always ask myself ""now how do I feel about the cinematography and set design""--but I was largely unimpressed with both (excluding some action sequence work, though).  Had I not been looking for it, I might not have noticed most of the time.  The scenes were still effective and I don't think too many people will wish they got more from this department unless, again like me, they specifically look for it.To be, or not to be, in 3D:  I saw this in 3D, and it wasn't until the second act action scenes that I sensed that this might have been filmed in 3D.  There was just something about the first act's movement, zooming and background that felt a bit untidily modified-from-2D-to-3D.  As it turns out, I saw the HBO making of special and noticed the same stale, artificial focus and contrast during zooming in 2D.  However, once the second act action begins, you see that the action was clearly made (and well made) for 3D.  It's just that the 3D felt like a natural improvement for some scenes, but actually obscured trademark scenes like the one-swing-tree-splitting when compared to HBO's (and the TV trailer's) much crisper 2D presentation.  One scene really didn't fit in 2D or 3D, and that's the ""stampede fight.""  When you see this, everything is so obscured by choppy focus and lazy-hazy blurred CGI that you wonder if they ran out of budget and then realized ""Hey guys, we still need to do the Stampede Fight.""My final decision: I'd vote to see this in 3D.THE ACTION:  After witnessing his tree-splitting training and some impressive axe-spinning flair I'm reminded of Ray Parks' work as the headless horseman (Sleepy Hollow) and Darth Maul (The Phantom Menace).  The action starts somewhere in the middle; it's very blood-letty, fast-paced and entertaining, but also filmed very close up such that you see very little.  So I was quite entertained while also wishing it was done differently.  But during this first act of the movie the events, build-up and consequence were more important than the fights themselves.  Whereas in the second act elaborately choreographed and CGI-enhanced scenes spew gore, sever limbs, and add complex acrobatics from a wide angle allowing full realization of intricate marriages between combat choreographers and CGI engineers.  The sets were more open, much as were for many of Neo's fights in the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies, which allowed more freedom in planning grandiose maneuvers with more combatants.  There's even a healthy dash of post-impact slo-mo (a la 300 or The Immortals) as caped bodies and weapons corkscrew through the air about trailing cascades of black blood.  Very well done indeed.  The action shifts gears yet again for the third act (with a more aged Lincoln) and include a Western-style train action sequence and Civil War battle scenes.  There's a good deal of unrealistic skill and precision which hemorrhages absurdity this flick, but I found myself not minding a bit despite some playful Oh-come-ons.THE STORY:  This movie succeeded where many failed in utilizing a multi-story-style 3-act model.  What do I mean?  I mean The Brotherhood of the Wolf model.  Each act of The Brotherhood of the Wolf felt like a different movie--it began with a period piece mystery, shifted to a large-scale action-driven phase, and then finished as a somewhat supernatural revenge flick, any one of which could have been its own stand-alone film.  Movies that try to do too much (like this) often fail.  In Abraham Lincoln we have a plotty origin story, followed by a more typical vampire hunter choreography-driven flick, and ended with an aged Abe and a politico-military historical piece where period mattered and fights took place in less martial arts-friendly venues.  Again, any one of these parts could have been the vampire-gnawed blood and guts of a whole separate movie.While on paper, the concept must sound like it skirts lunacy, this exercise in absurd fantasy-horror-war-history hybridization comes off as a great summer action flick.  You'll be surprised at how seriously you'll take it--as if hypnotized by some True Blood glamour.  So I say see it.  Be glamoured and dazzled.  Enjoy.",4,I never thought I'd appreciate my 5th grade Civil War history lessons.

This was a piece of history I know and the rework was just as interesting for entertainment as what actually happened was for knowledge. A good solid piece that I enjoyed watching multiple times.

In fact, it's one of the better movies I've seen in a while.  Now, I have not read the book and I saw a couple of reviews on here that 1 starred it for not following the book word for word.  Not sure I agree with that, but to each his own.About the movie:The action sequences were amazing; the sets & costumes were excellent; the special effects were top notch; the story was quite good with great acting.  What more do you want in a movie?  The people who are going to like this movie are going to be those who enjoy action/graphic horror movies with great special effects.  If you are a 'Bridges Over Madison County' or 'Sex in the City' kind of person then this probably isn't for you!  In fact, if you are a man and can say you enjoy the 2 movies I just mentioned, you might want to think about having that surgical procedure to have your nads removed....  but I digress....Oh yeah...you want to spend the extra $ and rent it on blu-ray if you have a nicer tv and sound system.

I am not familiar with the source material, other than knowing this film is based on a book, so I won't and can't compare them. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an ultra-stylish, action-packed adventure.The story is unique and innovative, packed with thrilling, edge-of-your-seat action sequences and a great yet bizarre ""what-if"" twist on history. (If you're not a fan of bizarre creativity, then this film is probably not for you.) There are a lot of slow-motion action which I thought was choreographed perfectly; I personally loved the final action sequence on top of the train where Abe and his childhood friend, William, fight an onslaught of vampires while sharing an axe. Also, this film has a couple of great jump-scares that I didn't expect, since I thought it was a pure action film. I enjoyed Benjamin Walker as young Abe Lincoln, but not so much as the older President Abraham Lincoln due to make-up/effects; the rest of the acting was great. This film oozes style, from the dark, beautifully shot scenery to the breathtaking, blood-splattering slow-motion action pieces; this is one of the film's that you should own on Blu-ray as the picture quality is amazing. Also, the music effectively complimented the film.Overall, I really enjoyed Abraham Lincoln; it's an amazing action film that effectively uses its fantasy concept and settings to its advantage.

Plus if it were to get made that it would be anything but be-headings, blood and generally cheesy and historically inaccurate throughout the whole running time. Well the filmmakers behind this movie wanted to go a different direction and try to make this film as historically accurate as possible (which like anything that has to do with history is up for debate), while having the violence and vampire attacks that make the second part of the title mean something.The story is remarkably well told, as we see Abe (played as an adult by Benjamin Walker, ""The War Boys"") grow from a young boy where he sees his mother killed by a vampire, to a young man where thanks to a vampire named Henry (Dominic Cooper, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") has turned good and trains Abe to kill vampires but only those Henry tells him about. Later after opening a shop where he studies law and kills vampires at night he discovers one in particular, his name is Adam (Rufus Sewell, ""Dark City"", ""A Knight's Tale"") and Adam wants to take over America (really what other kind of villain would he be if he didn't want to). During the vampire killings Abe meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"") and after some time they get married, settle down and have a child.The film really picks up in the third act when Abe is a little older, is the President of the U.S. and is in the midst of the civil war where vampires are fighting for the Confederacy. The historical stuff and the vampire killings mix well and shockingly it ends up being a great story despite the incredibly goofy premise. The filmmakers did at least take time to study history and provide a good telling of Abe Lincoln's life (whether totally accurate or not is again up for debate). I really did enjoy this as at the end of the day it's meant to be taken as just fun since the idea of a president killing vampires just grabs your attention (whether it be for the right or wrong reasons).It's a fun movie, fun to watch and a blast to watch some good old fashioned bloody killings mixed in with some history, just to keep it leveled out. *** out of 4 stars",4,"Entertainment, that's the focus here",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,2364,"['When', 'first', 'see', 'movie', 'titled', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'may', 'like', 'many', 'shake', 'head', 'laugh', 'just', 'be', 'shock', 'ludicrous', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'greenlit', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'mind', 'ever', 'getting', 'made', 'were', 'get', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'anything', 'be-headings', 'blood', 'generally', 'cheesy', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'whole', 'running', 'time', 'Well', 'filmmakers', 'movie', 'wanted', 'go', 'different', 'direction', 'try', 'make', 'film', 'historically', 'accurate', 'possible', 'anything', 'do', 'history', 'up', 'debate', 'having', 'violence', 'vampire', 'attacks', 'make', 'second', 'part', 'title', 'mean', 'something.The', 'story', 'remarkably', 'well', 'told', 'see', 'Abe', 'played', 'adult', 'Benjamin', 'Walker', 'War', 'Boys', 'grow', 'young', 'boy', 'where', 'mother', 'killed', 'vampire', 'young', 'man', 'where', 'thanks', 'vampire', 'named', 'Henry', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'turned', 'good', 'trains', 'Abe', 'kill', 'vampires', 'only', 'Henry', 'about', 'Later', 'opening', 'shop', 'where', 'studies', 'law', 'vampires', 'night', 'one', 'particular', 'name', 'Adam', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Dark', 'City', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'Adam', 'take', 'over', 'America', 'really', 'what', 'other', 'kind', 'villain', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'vampire', 'killings', 'Abe', 'meets', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'vs', 'World', 'time', 'get', 'married', 'settle', 'down', 'have', 'child.The', 'film', 'really', 'up', 'third', 'act', 'when', 'Abe', 'little', 'older', 'President', 'U.S.', 'midst', 'civil', 'war', 'where', 'vampires', 'are', 'fighting', 'Confederacy', 'historical', 'stuff', 'vampire', 'killings', 'mix', 'well', 'shockingly', 'up', 'being', 'great', 'story', 'incredibly', 'goofy', 'premise', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'least', 'take', 'time', 'study', 'history', 'provide', 'good', 'telling', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'totally', 'accurate', 'not', 'again', 'up', 'debate', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'end', 'day', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'as', 'just', 'fun', 'idea', 'president', 'killing', 'vampires', 'just', 'grabs', 'attention', 'be', 'right', 'wrong', 'reasons', '.It', 'fun', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'blast', 'watch', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'bloody', 'killings', 'mixed', 'history', 'just', 'keep', 'leveled', 'out', '***', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Here they lobotomized it and put in a bunch of ridiculous CGI and action shots. I think that using him for AL:VH was a huge mistake. As I watched the film for the second time I became more and more angry at the director. I don't think he read the book at all, just took the title and made up his own garbage. He should have used some of the budget for colon cleansing, to clear his mind of feces. Actually, maybe he did spend the money on enemas and such. It is not evident in the shabby CGI that would have looked bad in the 1990's, or the practical makeup, which is SO BAD I actually thought Abe's fake beard was going to peel off.

1476819,AF2HW9GNN8GN8,B005LAIHYU,J. Rivera,"[10, 12]","Excellent. When the book swept me off my feet with its gripping tale of alternate history and ""is it real?"" fiction, I had high hopes for the movie.I did not get the chance to see it in theaters, regrettably. Needless to say, I was eagerly anticipating it to be released on video, especially since I have a 3D HDTV. As with all 3D movies, I'm always skeptical if the 3D will be believable or just a cheap ""add-on."" Also, I'm always weary of purchasing a movie without watching it first, for fear of disappointment. So, I was going out on a wide limb to buy this one.Being only a fan of the book, I set the bar very high, and the producers took that bar and slammed it through the ceiling with style. Was it ""exactly"" like the book? No. Was that disappointing? No. Frankly, I was not sure how the makers would be able to fit all of the content into a movie that was shy of the 120 minute mark.The result was an outstanding success. The reviews of this movie are up and down, for both fans of the book and non-readers alike. This made me uneasy to ""waste my time"" with it. Bottom line, be your own critic. If you read the book, and loved it as I did, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching the movie adaptation.The actors were excellent. The plot was true to the book. The locales and costumes were superb. The action was spot-on. The visual effects were just right. The 3D was amazing: the movie is meant to be enjoyed in 3D. Dust particles float before your eyes. Splinters fly past the screen. Depth adds so much to the scenery and backdrops. The story is great. The use of 3D splendid. Do yourself a favor and at least rent this one.

After a while, though, I found myself able to suspend disbelief and enjoy it. Why not a superhero President, after all? Especially the greatest of all our Presidents?Young Abraham Lincoln, rail-splitter, flatboatman, lawyer, and political aspirant, has a deep dark secret: He's a Fearless Vampire Hunter armed with a silver bladed axe which he handles like a nunchuk, and when he's not splitting rails he's splitting vampires, who seem to be a plague on the frontier.Actually, they're a plague everywhere, especially in the South, where they've set up their own secret Vampire Empire (Vempire?), feeding off the slave population for generations. Tired of living in the shadows, the vampire hordes decide to set up their own country, and Abe Lincoln must lead an army to conquer them before they destroy every mortal below the Mason-Dixon Line, ultimately moving North in search of victims. And mortals call it ""the Civil War.""So, in sum, the film's message is that the Confederacy is a nation full of murderous bloodsuckers. It's an interesting twist on history (and the history in ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER is pretty twisted, so kids, don't do a book report on it), and, oddly enough for a film of this type, a direct political statement on human rights.It's very clear that this movie wouldn't do well on Stone Mountain, Georgia, but if you just like fast-moving action and good special effects, and excellent cinematography (the film has a definite tintype feel to it), then sit back and go for a wild ride.

The American civil war context fits well with the parameters of the Bram Stoker fantasy. A degenerate aristocracy who are ""dead"" maintain themselves off the living and create a system that cannot co-exist with a different one. There is alot in that idea that a good writer could mine out. But this isn't that kind of film. This film strictly plays it for exploitation value. Its a fairly stupid by the numbers action film that doesn't think much about anything.The acting isn't bad. The sets and the period settings are better than I had any right to expect. But the writing is third-rate and the action scenes seem to be channeling ""the matrix"". Everyone is super-powered because apparently people become super-powered just through will. They also introduce silver metal (ala werewolves) as the kryptonite of the vampire set which is also kind of different. The only interesting thing from an action point of view is that this is the ultimate film about axe fighting.For all its flaws, the film somewhat ends up better than it has any right to be. Its watchable. Beyond that, as absurd as everything is, everyone involved still seems to treat the material seriously (which is good). Its not a conventional horror film by any means.

It was a history lesson with a twist. Watching ""Abraham Hunter: Vampire Hunter"" was like seeing ""The Matrix"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" for the first time......a fascinating movie that was totally unexpected but greatly appreciated. I loved the way the writers wove bits of history (i.e., slavery, the death of his son, and the Civil War) with a possible premise that included slavery being beneficial for not only Southerners, but for vampires, seeing that they were using them for food. The movie literally shows the evolution of Abraham Lincoln from a young boy bent on revenge (vampires killed his mother) to a young man with political aspirations, into a man fighting to end slavery for several reasons, but none more important than preventing vampires for taking over the world. (Apparently slavery allows the vamps to feed without regard for the consequences). Regardless, as Lincoln's political career culminates in a presidency, we see Lincoln facing everything from the death of his son (again history with a twist) to betrayal by a friend.

In the movie you have the one villain, who is bland and not at all interesting.The person who played Lincoln, did a good job. In fact between him and the one who played Lincoln in Lincoln, while both good, I think that the one who played Lincoln hear was better. Though the character of Lincoln I thought was very bland here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a good job as Lincoln's wife, Mary. I think Winstead did a better job, than the person who played Mary in Lincoln. Dominic Cooper plays the typical mentor character, but I liked him. The rest of the cast is forgettable.The production values and effects are good, but not great. The production values in Lincoln are better. The fights are okay, but get hammered by constant slow motion.

El-Hewie""","[4, 7]","In the beginning, it was hard to imagine that an American movie could rise to such level of sophistication in integrating philosophy into history and art. My first impression after watching the dark blood and vampire attacks was a mix of shock and curiosity. The purpose of injecting such bloody scenes of biting and terrorizing became clearer after watching the movie few times. I admit that the inclusion of vampire hunting is still troubling me in the view that the movie comprises a landmark of art, history, and education.Abraham Lincoln returns live, spoke with recognizable voice, moved with familiar gait, gestures, and style as if he was a familiar contemporary person. Lincoln's oratorical performance was no less glorious than his physical resemblance to the real man.The movie plot alleviated my shock of watching vampires tainting such glorious integration of film making. At the end of the movie, Lincoln's latest friend appeared in a wagon with a ruthless agent of the south and was accused by Henry as a traitor. Shortly after, Speed's plot appeared to have distracted the southern vampires by chasing the silver train rather than taking over Washington DC.Henry's role as a trustworthy vampire was also impressive from the start to end.The impressive trend in this movie was the rational explanation of how Lincoln advanced from a common person to a leader of a great nation. Lincoln's mother was constantly credited for inspiring Abraham that we are all slaves as long as there is one slave among us. Willi Johnson reminded Lincoln with his mother's belief during his recitation of the federal statues on slavery.Apparently, Henry was also credited for hinting to Lincoln with the role of silver in Christianity, which Lincoln used during his lowest moments to win the war against the south. As the southern vampires chased the silver train, Lincoln's wife was orchestrating the conversion of silver into war ammunition during her husband's voyage to Gettysburg.Every scene in the movie was a masterpiece of art, philosophy, and history. Henry ended at twisted rails, on top of blazing fires, when Lincoln extended his hand to rescue him as a trustworthy vampire. Speed performed outstanding rescue missions among which was penetrating a concrete building was a horse drawn wagon, getting away on one wheel with his rescued hostages.Whether Lincoln's story was a gift to art that inspired its professionals to rise to such level of mastery or was it the coincidental advanced in technology that made possible such legendary movie production, one must credit the author of the story and moviemaker for carving such thoughtful masterpiece of educational work.Mohamed F.

Oleson,"[1, 4]","May contain spoilers.I like to think I can appreciate a premise so far removed from reality as this, and certainly the filmmaker's and writers had a choice.  Do we play this up with a bit of campy humor or go with the serious-play-it-straight direction.  They chose the latter.  As a boy, young Abe sees his mother slain by a vampire and vows revenge.  Years later as a young man (Benjamin Walker), he is schooled by  a mysterious stranger (Dominic Cooper) in the art of killing vampires.  Abe's weapon of choice is a silver laden ax, because he has some experience splitting rails.  Abe becomes quite adept to the point of spinning that ax like a cheerleader's baton.Interwoven during his vampire removal time in Springfield, Illinois he meets his wife Mary (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), gets elected to Congress and eventually the presidency.  In a career defining period of the Civil War, Lincoln learns that the vampires are siding with the Confederates because the slaves are nourishment for the vampires.  In a terrific scene he confounds the vampire leader, Adam (Rufus Sewell) boarding a train full of silver that will be used to arm the Union soldiers.  It's all misdirection, easily spotted but the confrontation on the train is well done.

Upon the trailers and name I could understand how some would easily dismiss this film, but fans of quality fantasy, action, horror and history should take note. I will add that I went with my Mom who is not a fan of gore and horror and she thought the film was great as well and not what she had expected from the trailers. She is also an elementary school teacher and found the retelling of historical events of Lincoln done in a very entertaining light.The title character is played to perfection by Mettle Streep's son-in-law who is an extremely well trained actor. I look forward to seeing him in another film. The acting all around is quite good and has a touch of tongue in cheek and slight camp. Yet the actors do such a stellar job and the films production values is also top notch that I was cheering along through this film and was sad to see it end.As for the premise of the story (without too much spoilers) is the young childhood of Abe Lincoln to young man, to falling in love, to becoming President and father, to his tragic death. It shows of Lincoln's battle to end slavery in our nation which is being orchestrated by vampires in the South to keep in bondage and as a source of blood supply. A nice an interesting symbol as monsters who oppressed the Black nation. But as in all things not everything that may appear as evil is not always completely true. Especially when Lincoln is being trained for combat by a renegade vampire who wants to abolish vampires and help Lincoln avenge the murder of his mother that occurred when Lincoln was a boy.Truly this film is a great history teaching tool in some ways. And really is appropriate for 13 years old and up. It has mild language with one or two uses of the f bomb. So not too bad. Violent yes, but not extreme but in a more over the top camp way which in essence feels like comic book violence. The film is engaging, funny on purpose, entertaining and truly comments on what a great man our 16th President was...and makes him an action hero for the new age.

Geez, I even have to put in a ""warning label"" for a movie review since the world has gone completely off its rocker with all this PC crap and all the other stupidity encompassing what passes for entertaiment these days on TV or at the movies.  Also the ridiculous over-sensitivity about everything that never even entered anyone's mind during the majority of my 50+ years of being alive)***  With that out of the way...Slap the person(s) who wrote this story, slap the person(s) who thought this was a good idea, slap the person(s) who liked it at the production level before it was even started to be filmed, slap the person(s) who paid for the production, slap the person who chose to direct this, slap all the actors who got paid to be in it (and many of the actors are actors I really like and respect), Give a pat on the back to all the persons involved in the production design and special FX, slap every single person who paid the movie theater price to see this film. I've already smacked myself in the head several times while watching a rental of this movie for paying $3.99 to rent it out of sheer morbid curiosity.While this movie is certainly a well budgeted production - I rank it up (or should that be down) there with movies like Bad Taste (and look who directed that turd of a film from New Zealand and how far he -and the whole country- has come in the movie business since 1988) as a movie that serves no purpose other than to disgrace the name of a president who was very WORTHWHILE and SIGNIFICANT.Why couldn't they have switched presidents to Barrack Obama as the vampire slayer.  He's been scaring the crap out of me since his first election to this countris highest office.  I'd have an easier time believing that killing vampires is what he's really doing than believe he has anything to do with running this country other than into the ground even further than the other presidents before him.  I even figure he wouldn't need any weapon to kill vampires, he'd just speak and they'd either die of laughter because they've been around for centuries and have known US real leaders, or they would could also die of boredom.  Perhaps his vampire killing power could be just the sound of his voice causing vampires to explode upon hearing it in person within a certain physical distance??And these other former presidents just popped into my head as possible movie choices...George W.

The book succeeds because there is enough fact to make the fiction seem somewhat plausible. In the film, however, there is no entertaining way to be faithful to facts; who's going to want to read several paragraphs of information before every scene just to get context? The movie is tasked with keeping the general blueprint of the book, but finding ways to express the same things without the benefit of elaborate backstory. What the film does well is condense the backstory in a way that it gives enough information to make you understand Lincoln's motivations, but it holds enough back to keep up pretty good pacing.

But what most of us don't know is that Mr. President was also fighting another war--one against vampires. Little do any of us realize just how much of a role the undead played in the outcome of the American Civil War. It all started at the tender age of nine when Abe witnessed his mother's murder at the hands of a vampire. Soon thereafter, revenge became his new mission. With the help of an undead ally, Henry, Honest Abe mounted his own campaign to exterminate the worst of the vampires and free America from their evil clutches.After a very painful attempt to get through the audiobook, I decided to give Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (the movie) a chance. Have you seen the trailer? Doesn't it look awesome?! Sadly, we've been misled. This movie isn't awesome. It isn't even awesomely bad. It's just plain bad. Initially, I attributed my dislike of the novel to the fact that I'm not one for American or presidential history. I find the subject matter to be quite dull. It's just not my bag, baby, and that's okay. I guess I was disappointed because I thought there would be more vampy action in it. So naturally after seeing the trailer, I was led to believe they'd given the movie incarnation the Michael Bay treatment. Oh there was action alright, but not enough of the good kind to save it from being a total disaster.I think the movies failure comes in that it's just too much, too over the top. Had they attempted to do campy, I could've dealt with that, but they didn't. They took it way too seriously and relied solely on cartoonish CGI effects to achieve the high intensity for which they were aiming. And I know I said I didn't like the book, but the movie deviated so far away from the original source material that it was barely even recognizable. At least Benjamin Walker nailed it in the looks department though his performance was somewhat wooden and shaky at best. There were, however, a few very cool montage-worthy training scenes which kept me somewhat placated. And I also have to give a big nod to my favourite typecasted bad guy, Dominic Cooper. He's just the bestest of the bad. All I can really say isFood for Thought: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter somehow managed to be both of poor quality and ridiculously over-the-top at the same time. There is no shortage action but it's a shoddy, unsatisfying type of action that left a very disagreeable taste in my mouth. I cannot in good conscience recommend the movie, however, if American/presidential history is your thing, give the book a whirl.Rating: 1 1/2 Stars",1,"Not the vampire flick I waited for, it was the I didn't need.",1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,2705,"['Most', 'know', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', '-the', '16th', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'writer', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'preserver', 'Union', 'ender', 'slavery', 'what', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Mr.', 'President', 'was', 'also', 'fighting', 'war', 'one', 'vampires', 'Little', 'do', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'role', 'undead', 'played', 'outcome', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'started', 'tender', 'age', 'nine', 'when', 'Abe', 'witnessed', 'mother', 'murder', 'hands', 'vampire', 'Soon', 'thereafter', 'revenge', 'became', 'new', 'mission', 'help', 'undead', 'ally', 'Henry', 'Honest', 'Abe', 'mounted', 'own', 'campaign', 'exterminate', 'worst', 'vampires', 'free', 'America', 'evil', 'clutches.After', 'very', 'painful', 'attempt', 'get', 'audiobook', 'decided', 'give', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'movie', 'chance', 'Have', 'seen', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'look', 'awesome', 'Sadly', ""'ve"", 'been', 'misled', 'movie', ""n't"", 'awesome', ""n't"", 'even', 'awesomely', 'bad', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Initially', 'attributed', 'dislike', 'novel', 'fact', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'American', 'presidential', 'history', 'find', 'subject', 'matter', 'be', 'quite', 'dull', 'just', 'not', 'bag', 'baby', 'okay', 'guess', 'was', 'disappointed', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'vampy', 'action', 'So', 'naturally', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'was', 'led', 'believe', ""'d"", 'given', 'movie', 'incarnation', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'treatment', 'Oh', 'was', 'action', 'alright', 'not', 'enough', 'good', 'kind', 'save', 'being', 'total', 'disaster.I', 'think', 'movies', 'failure', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'top', 'Had', 'attempted', 'do', 'campy', 'could', ""'ve"", 'dealt', 'did', ""n't"", 'took', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'relied', 'solely', 'cartoonish', 'CGI', 'effects', 'achieve', 'high', 'intensity', 'were', 'aiming', 'know', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'book', 'movie', 'deviated', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'barely', 'even', 'recognizable', 'least', 'Benjamin', 'Walker', 'nailed', 'looks', 'department', 'performance', 'was', 'somewhat', 'wooden', 'shaky', 'best', 'were', 'however', 'few', 'very', 'cool', 'montage-worthy', 'training', 'scenes', 'kept', 'somewhat', 'placated', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'big', 'nod', 'favourite', 'typecasted', 'bad', 'guy', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'just', 'bestest', 'bad', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'isFood', 'Thought', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'somehow', 'managed', 'be', 'poor', 'quality', 'ridiculously', 'over-the-top', 'same', 'time', 'shortage', 'action', 'shoddy', 'unsatisfying', 'type', 'action', 'left', 'very', 'disagreeable', 'taste', 'mouth', 'can', 'not', 'good', 'conscience', 'recommend', 'movie', 'however', 'American/presidential', 'history', 'thing', 'give', 'book', 'whirl.Rating', '1', '1/2', 'Stars']",N/A

And I know very little about Lincoln. But that hardly matters.I have a Home Theater. That means I get to see new movies only after they have been released to streaming or Blu-ray. Typically that's about three months. I saw all the Oscar publicity around the Daniel Day Lewis version, so I decided to watch this version while I waited.But before I explain why this version is the superior one, let me draw attention to the star of this film - the previously none too famous Benjamin Walker. Walker is the right height. Lincoln towered over his contemporaries. Daniel Day Lewis does not. So Walker carries along with him some instant verisimilitude. He also looks remarkably like a young Liam Neeson. I looked him up in IMDB and was delighted to learn that he got his big break in ""Kinsey"" playing a teenage Liam Neeson (Kinsey). The resemblance is startling. This has happened ocassionally before as when the aging Robert Redford cast the younger look-alike Brad Pitt to in effect play him in ""A River Runs Through It"".First you must understand that this movie with the silly horror movie plot and title, is indeed a big budget feature film. On Blu-ray this is a very pretty movie. The photography is great and includes expensive helicopter shots and CGI graphics. This makes for a satisfying viewing experience.There are also a lot of plot details that have been crafted to make the everything seem real. That of course is impossible because Abe Lincoln did not save the union from the undead blood suckers with a silver coated ax. There were no vampires who were responsible for the institution of slavery. This discordance makes the viewer think. Not many movies make you think.Like so many other historical movies I expect the Daniel Day Lewis version to preach to me. I expect it to come down hard with it's anti-slavery message. I expect it to try to bludgeon my brain into compliance like the all the early fifties biblical spectaculars.After watching this film it's impossible to view historical movies in quite the same way again. If Hoillywood can make such a good case for this preposterous premise, they can obviously make a case for anything. Ridley Scott makes historical films that always look good too. George Clooney (known in Hollywood as Red George) makes plausible looking political films. In both cases they use the modern miracles of film and digital technology to create a convincing looking visions of the world as they imagined it to be. They have axes to grind.

Ben Walker as Abraham Lincoln is just great.  Unlike some other actors of his generation, Walker never seems aware that he's in a giant movie playing a part.  He just is Honest Abe - he plays the part simply and without trying ""act"" like he's the Railsplitter.  A very fine performance.  His vampire hunter trainer, played by Dominic Cooper (prolly best know as playing Tony Stark's Dad in CAPTAIN AMERICA) is also excellent... as is Rufus Sewell and the 'Head vampire"" and pretty much everyone else in the cast.  Very good acting all around.Ditto that the photography and costumes and SFX.  In fact, there is a simply fantastic scene where Lincoln must fight a vampire in a stampede of horses - amazing SFX.  The music is good, not great, but certainly serviceable.  The movie looks and feels like a big budget film (which of course it is), and it looks like the money is put up on the screen.As for the vampires themselves, for the most part they don't seem all that vampire-ish - they can move freely during the day, turn invisible, and other rarely seen tricks - but they are consistent within their own mythos, and make a very nice set of villains.And as much as this movie is about steampunk kung fu scenes against vampires, it really is about Lincoln himself.  There's one shot of him walking in silhouette down a hallway that sent chills up my spine.  In the end, it is a story about Lincoln, arguably the best President this great country has ever produced - plus some vampires.  And that's pretty dang sweet.  The story does a nice job of intertwining the real man with the fantastical story (basically keeping the facts of Lincoln's life accurate), making for one of the more original movies you're likely to see this year.  There are some elements of tale that perhaps could have been told better - it tends to minimize slavery and paint white Southerners with large evil brush - but it is after all a story about Abe Lincoln killing vampires.In the end, it's a neat version of the story of a great man plus an army of vampires - what's not to like?BOTTOM LINE: 3.5 4 score and 40 dead vampires out of 5",3,Lincoln whoops up on steampunk vampires,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,2391,"['what', 'kinda', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Civil', 'War', 'meets', 'INTERVIEW', 'WITH', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'MATRIX', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'Russian', 'director', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', 'ABRAHAM', 'LINCOLN', 'VAMPIRE', 'HUNTER', 'just', 'plain', 'fun.Everything', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'starting', 'cast', 'Ben', 'Walker', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'just', 'great', 'other', 'actors', 'generation', 'Walker', 'never', 'aware', 'giant', 'movie', 'playing', 'part', 'just', 'Honest', 'Abe', 'part', 'simply', 'trying', 'act', 'Railsplitter', 'very', 'fine', 'performance', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'trainer', 'played', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'prolly', 'best', 'know', 'playing', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Dad', 'CAPTAIN', 'AMERICA', 'also', 'excellent', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', ""'Head"", 'vampire', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'Very', 'good', 'acting', 'around.Ditto', 'photography', 'costumes', 'SFX', 'fact', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'scene', 'where', 'Lincoln', 'must', 'fight', 'vampire', 'stampede', 'horses', 'amazing', 'SFX', 'music', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'certainly', 'serviceable', 'movie', 'feels', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'course', 'money', 'put', 'up', 'screen.As', 'vampires', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'vampire-ish', 'can', 'move', 'freely', 'day', 'turn', 'invisible', 'other', 'rarely', 'seen', 'tricks', 'are', 'consistent', 'own', 'mythos', 'make', 'very', 'nice', 'set', 'villains.And', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'steampunk', 'kung', 'fu', 'scenes', 'vampires', 'really', 'Lincoln', 'one', 'shot', 'walking', 'silhouette', 'down', 'hallway', 'sent', 'up', 'spine', 'end', 'story', 'Lincoln', 'arguably', 'best', 'President', 'great', 'country', 'ever', 'produced', 'vampires', 'pretty', 'dang', 'sweet', 'story', 'nice', 'job', 'intertwining', 'real', 'man', 'fantastical', 'story', 'basically', 'keeping', 'facts', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'accurate', 'making', 'one', 'more', 'original', 'movies', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'year', 'are', 'elements', 'tale', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'better', 'minimize', 'slavery', 'paint', 'white', 'Southerners', 'large', 'evil', 'brush', 'story', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'killing', 'end', 'neat', 'version', 'story', 'great', 'man', 'army', 'vampires', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'BOTTOM', 'LINE', '3.5', '4', 'score', '40', 'dead', 'vampires', '5']",N/A

Beyond that, it's just a fun movie with a completely likable protagonist and very likable side characters.  I like the fact too that Mary Todd was a unique and likable as Abe himself.

1476979,AUDW8J8GH0IDO,B005LAIHYU,"ReAgent 6 ""Mixed media: movies, music and wha...","[2, 2]","Movie Review Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012)A movie that is great beyond its promise and premise.The trailer for this movie left me stuck in the middle. We have an insane premise- that the 16th President of the United States did double duty as a monster killer and some wicked and slickly filmed chop chop action thrown in. Director Timur Bekmambetov, from the Night Watch and Day Watch movies, is no stranger to fangs in film. He channels his passion for all things dark and scary and then adds a pinch of Matrix (no surprise) and Brotherhood of the Wolf. The Brotherhood nod is for seeing early Americana mixed with Martial Arts.It works. The movie succeeds- a huge credit goes to the serious handling of the iconic Abraham Lincoln character [played by Benjamin Walker] and the great lengths taken to capture the mid 1800s spirit. Writer Seth Grahame-Smith has layered a dark tale of vengeance around the most important issues of the time- slavery and the Civil War.Vampire movies have always preyed and played with the idea of man verse monster. It's always been the choice between gaining enormous power and holding on to our fragile humanity. We parallel the struggle between the monstrous idea of slavery verse the inalienable rights of every man to be equal. Who would have guessed we'd tap such weighty subjects in a film about honest Abe obliterating bloodsuckers with an axe.The fight scenes are a sight to behold and every element of film is used to enhance the action. We have great use of sound (albeit loud and obvious sometimes), slow motion and fast motion and even color takes an active role. We can see the obvious cooling and warming of shots, the isolation of colors, but the symbolism of color draining (like blood) is a marvelous touch. The visual respect for film matches the respect for the subject matter.Throughout the movie, I kept thinking `They didn't have to go that far', but really- that pursuit of quality is what saves Vampire Killer from being a quickly forgotten b-movie. I believe they purposely walked the line of historical fiction and period piece drama as events in the movie closely follow history and Lincoln's personal story.I liked it, I liked it, I liked it.

1476992,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B005LAIHYU,Richard Masloski,"[12, 30]","There are many instances in literature and film where a famous person is placed into a fictitious setting and one of the key componants to the entertainment value of such a proceeding is the audience's anticipated ability to imagine alternative or hidden histories related to whatever historical characters are being utilized.  A recent cinematic example is THE RAVEN where the historically mysterious last weeks in Poe's life are the springboard for the speculative.  Many years ago there was a very fine film called TIME AFTER TIME that raised the question ""What if H.G. Wells had not only written of the Time Machine, but had invented one as well?"" The film then built upon this notion and the resultant movie - which also included Jack the Ripper being transported to the future, our present - was extremely well done, exciting, entertaining and even thought-provoking. There was also a Sherlock Holmes movie - THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION - wherein Sigmund Freud is called in by Dr. Watson to help with Holmes' cocaine addiction.  There are many, many examples wherein historical figures are intertwined and interjected into fictional settings - and very often the results are fun, exciting, interesting, thought-provoking.  The truly crucial element in all cases where this artistic hybrid proves successful to one degree or another is winning the audience's ability to at least be able to say ""It could have happened.""  So, in the examples above, had Holmes been a historical figure, Freud could have crossed paths with him.  Poe, in his last unknown weeks, could have - no matter how absurd and unlikely - been involved in a serial murder case as shown in THE RAVEN.  And even though it is logically absurd, imaginatively the thought of H.G. Wells and a real Time Machine is truly delightful to contemplate.But with ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER, what would have worked better as a five minute Saturday Night Live sketch, comes at us like this same flick's Lincoln's silver-tipped axe - cutting, chopping, killing everything in its path.  For starters, it cuts and chops and kills any entertainment value it ever might have had by sheer and simple overkill. And not just the overkill of the vampires and their victims: I mean yawn-inducing horse stampedes and ridiculous runaway trains that just never know when to quit!  And isn't it enough to take arguably the most famous figure in American history and make him into a vampire hunter?  Do the makers of this undisciplined train-wreck of a movie have to make him into a cartoon superhero too?  No man on the planet ever did or ever could leap and fly around in the silly horse stampede sequence or survive one one-hundreth of the physical extremes of the never ending train-wreck episode.  Only cartoon super heroes are capable of such gravity-defying, injury-immune acrobatics. Or should be. Superman or Spiderman - but not Honest Abe! (If Lincoln is able to leap tall buildings with a single bound, what is left for the Man from Krypton?) To watch and endure such sequences as mentioned above does a vast injustice to the heroic abilities of the truly human - and are an insult to the intelligence unless one is immune to or addicted to or financially enslaved to the Monster that is undisciplined, indiscreet, infantile CGI. This true Movie Monster has been stomping around for a long time now, crushing otherwise great and good actors in its path, stealing most things subtle and replacing it with the senseless spectacular - and the sounds and musical soundtracks that accompany these domineering digital depravities have mostly obliterated script literacy entirely.  Where is a silver axe to destroy this true Monster of the Movies?But there is a larger issue at work here other than the misuse of CGI.  Does this allegedly ""fun"" film give early hint of a dangerous proclivity?  History is or should be important.  In a country where very few school kids (or even college kids!)(or even anybody!) even know who Abraham Lincoln is or, worse, even cares about why he is so historically great and enduring, along comes a movie that with its pandering to the current spike in the never-ending fascination with the undead and its catering to every conceivable cliche in the book when it comes to CGI-driven  and bloated actioneers, along comes a movie that takes the most painful pages from American history and spatters them not with the blood of men but with the blood of vampires.  So we see on screen an Abraham Lincoln who becomes President - not to keep the States United or end the much more insidious evil of slavery - no, this Lincoln's agenda is to defeat the vampire hordes who come to populate much of the South and by proxy the Confederate Army.  And the tide is turned at Gettysburg not by the sheer belief and bravery of the Union Army, but by plundered Southern silver being fired by rifle and cannon into the undead Rebels peopling Robert E. Lee's army.  And Lincoln's son Willie dies not of the truly tragic Potomac fever, but from a vampire's bite.  The point is that history is overwhelmingly trivialized in this silly, simplistic film.  It is one thing to speculate about hidden histories or might-have-beens in an artisic undertaking.  But when the history - as with Lincoln and the Civil War and Slavery - is virtually impossible to ever have been hidden and the might-have-beens have not the slightest semblance of sanity to back them, then the speculative work will suffer from a severe and deadly artistic anemia that has naught to do with the attack of a vampire.  The true vampires in this entire instance are the makers of this movie who suck blood and brain and bucks from the unsuspecting masses glutting on bread and circuses as Rome burns and Nero fiddles.I can envision an ever darker, bleaker, scarier by-far future in film when some irresponsible and twisted film makers who just so happen to have an unlearned, unread, uncaring fan-based mandate might cook up a film wherein Hitler is also a vampire hunter and the Holocaust is nothing less than a purging of Europe's living dead hordes.In short, to trivialize history is to trivialize humanity - and once that is acceptable by mass consensus...then anything, anything at all, could happen.  And usually does.",1,WHO ARE THE REAL VAMPIRES?,1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,6257,"['are', 'many', 'instances', 'literature', 'film', 'where', 'famous', 'person', 'placed', 'fictitious', 'setting',

1476998,ALLRNCQ2L8V9Z,B005LAIHYU,R. L. Matsui,"[222, 251]","Hovering half-way between being serious and being funny--and enjoying every minute of its crazy balancing act--this is a great movie.  A real movie.Given the rarity of good films made in Hollywood these days, I had no reasonable expectations, statistically, for a good film here. So I went into the cinema and hoped for the best, but expected nothing.Imagine my surprise when I found that ""Abe Lincoln"" is 1. a well-acted period film with great sets and costumes, 2. a wildly paced action special effects feast, 3. an effectively witty self-satirical historical rewrite and 4. a gruesomely graphic horror flick!  I don't see this as a perfect film--it's got flaws.  But the handful of flaws that bother me, I can ignore, because this is a film made with a joyous spirit, and the overall structure works well.  I've seen this five times in the theatre at this point. I haven't seen a film that many times theatrically in over twenty years!  I had read the book and enjoyed it, but had no idea what the film version might be like.  As has been noted elsewhere, the book and the movie are two completely different things: The book delivers a more intellectual experience, and the film delivers a more emotional experience.  Writer Seth Grahame-Smith has tailored his book into something simpler and less grim for the screen.  I think the decision to make the film a fun action movie was a smart one.  It's a wild ride.History is transformed into mythic fantasy in this yarn detailing the never-before-told story of Lincoln's lifelong battles with supernatural evil. Indeed, the opening words of narration, ""History prefers legends to men,"" express the awareness that events are altered in retrospection, to suit our thirst for myth, for purity of rights and wrongs. But the ""rewrite"" that ensues shows us the maddest symbolic extremes.  Is this a commentary about America's changing self-image? An indictment of our entertainment culture's increasing obsession with simplistic heroes, loud noises and glorified bloodshed? A condemnation that is strangely exemplary of the problem?  Without winking, this film makes many sly jabs at the ""typical,"" common-denominator, American action film.It's simultaneously silly and profoundly moving--a film so strange that many scratch their heads, but in time, I think, it will come to be regarded as a classic of genre cinema.  In this searing mixture of the real and the unreal, we witness scenes of outlandish fantasy as well as scenes of a young nation being shaped through moral and political conflict. A wide spectrum of emotions is expressed. Sweeping vistas, vital romance, epic battles: It might reasonably be said that this is the ""Gone with the Wind"" of vampire films.  There is an ecstasy of absurdity.  It's fun because it's just plain crazy, but in an expensive, lavish, eloquent, opulent way.Yes, like ""Sleepy Hollow"" before it, this one brings back memories of the Hammer classic horror films, which, though violent, were elegant and refined, with beautifully written dialogue.  It's a really refreshing change from the crudity and brutal excesses seen in horror films of recent years.  This one goes down smooth.The humor here is pretty subtle, most of the time. This film suggests to the viewer that one of America's greatest Presidents was actually also a fearsome, axe-swinging, monster-slaughtering badass. The story of how all this came to be is lovingly presented as the most serious thing in the world, despite its patent ridiculousness. This ""straight-faced"" approach is really the key to the humor, and achieves a smart, sophisticated effect.The Civil War-era story links the intended secession of the Southern states with the rise to power of vampires in those states; so vampirism becomes a metaphor for slavery and man's general inhumanity to himself. The typical horror film focuses on primal fears, and never on issues of morality; so while largely a horror film, this seeks to turn some basic principles of the horror film sideways. The meddling does not stop there. It is true that the story treats its history elements as ""flexible material"" to be modified as necessary for storytelling purposes (is this unexpected for a film with a title like ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter""?). But it is also true that the audience needs to be familiar with the American Civil War, Lincoln, Harriet Tubman, and various other historical personages, in order to comprehend the story and get the jokes. Perhaps it's a sad thing, but whimsical fantasies featuring historical figures (like this film, and the first ""Bill and Ted"" film) are most useful in this day and age for acquainting audiences with these figures in the first place.  Inaccurate?  Sure.  But it's still comprehensible only to literate audiences.The film is a creative entity--and, like some of my favorite satire-comedies, seeks to go vigorously against the grain of convention, so audience members expecting the normal ""action film product"" are likely to be confused (and when I watched it in theatres, a good many viewers were certainly confused!). ""Abe Lincoln"" thinks outside the box and then axe-murders the box.  If you happen to be inside the box, well, you are in trouble.  But sharp viewers who get the joke are rewarded with a stimulating experience.While serving up gaggles of vicious monsters, it unfolds an old-school ""birth of the hero"" story that recalls the tone of earlier Technicolor Hollywood epics and historical biopics. ""Abe Lincoln"" delivers much, much more than the basic requirements. This is a popcorn film of a higher order.Many laughs, scares, and thrilling moments. Yeah. I loved it.--Rodd Matsui",5,A Modern Classic Fantasy/Horror Adventure.,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,5647,"['Hovering', 'half-way', 'being', 'serious', 'being', 'funny', 'enjoying', 'minute', 'crazy',

Most of the negatives are from people who read the book and presumed it would be magically transformed into a movie on a one-to-one basis. The British have a word for such notions: Poppycock!  I am a big fan of co-star Dominic Cooper, who plays the son of Saddam Hussein in the movie THE DEVIL'S OWN (also highly recommended by yours truly!). He is a great actor and lends much to this movie as you will no doubt see. If you are a fan of HORROR and a fan of vampire movies, you will like this. If you have read the book and are able to divest yourself from loyalty to that work and view this as a stand-alone piece, you will admit that it is a roller-coaster ride of a great movie. It is, in the end, also a great BUDDY movie and love story. It is a patriotic story of a man who became a hero, who championed the cause of freedom and liberty.The concept of a martial arts trained Lincoln, wielding his axe against blood-sucking monsters from hell is pretty unique. (Side note: I see there is already an Abe Lincoln Vs. Zombies movie out! Let's not get carried away! What's next: Washington Against Werewolves???)There are some extremely intense moments. Some horrifying moments. Some great fight sequences and a lot of gore (though nothing too harsh or just plain disgusting).Now, some belittle the movie as being historically inaccurate. I am no history major, but I am a student of both politics and war, and I did not see any glaring inaccuracies. Considering that this is not a History Channel documentary, I cannot fault the director for making ""adjustments"" to suit this work of fantasy/fiction. Good lord people. It's a vampire movie. It CANNOT, by that definition, be historically accurate. Clue: Vampires are not real. Sorry. I hope that didn't make people not want to see the movie. LOL!  Professional wrestling is not real either. 8-) FYI.Abraham Lincoln was all about freedom, liberty and the ability of men to think for themselves.

1477002,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B005LAIHYU,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter(released June/12) stars Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln,Dominic Cooper as Henry Sturges, Lincoln's mentor,Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd Lincoln,Anthony Mackie as William Johnson,Jimmi Simpson as Joshua Speed,Rufus Sewell as Adam,Marton Csokas(Borias in Xena)as Jack Barts,and others.I found the film to be a seamless blend of both the historical and fantasy genres of film.It takes a look at the life of Abraham Lincoln,from boyhood to his ascendancy to the Presidential office.It takes some of the more well known moments of his life and blends the raison d'etre of those moments with the fanatsy genre,in this case,vampirism.Walker does a wonderful job as Lincoln, as does the make up team as he ages.Now the whole premise of Vampires and Lincoln of course hinges on the ability of the film's makers to make you believe that there could have been an actual connection.If it doesn't the film fails.I found it succeeded brilliantly and therefore had me right from the start.The story starts with Lincoln as a young boy.His father works for a harsh plantation owner(Jack Barts)who is whipping a black man(one of his slaves),then turns on the slaves son.Young Abe,much to his fathers chagrin,intervenes to help his friend Willi Johnson,then so does his father,who halts the lashing.The owner is none too pleased,but gets his revenge.One night the owner sneaks into the Lincoln homestead,and as young Abe watches,he bites his mothers arm.It seems Barts was a vampire.The mother gets terminally sick and passes away.Nine years later so does Abe's father,and Abe is now on a mission to get revenge.He is in a bar,drinking up enough courage to finally confront Barts.He doesn't do well and has to be rescued by one Henry Sturges.Sturges himself was bitten years before by the progenitor of the vampires,called Adam,and follows them to work against them.Sturges vows to help Lincoln in his quest for revenge and trains him for many years,with Lincoln's choice of weaponry;an axe.Lincoln eventually leaves his home and travels to Illinois where he gets a job in a store run by a Joshua Speed.It is also here he meets up with the future Mrs.Lincoln,Mary Todd and his old friend Willi Johnson,who will become Abe's most valuable and steadfast assistant.Abe,after so many years,finally gets his chance at taking out Barts,and finally succeeds.Learning of Abe's activities,Adam kidnaps Willi and brings him to his plantation in New Orleans.This of course lures Abe to come to the rescue.This he does,but with the help of Mr.Speed.Time moves forward and Lincoln has successfully become a lawyer and starts running for political office.Eventually his ideas for the abolition of slavery takes him all the way to the White House.His mentor warns that if he continues his quest regarding slavery,which is the vampires greatest source of food,that he will be in deep trouble.The Fort Sumter incident comes and the Civil War is on.Adam has thrown his entire contingent of vampires into the fight against the North.The War is not going well for Lincoln and come Gettysburg,the entire outcome hangs in the balance.Lincoln instigates a drive in Washington to confiscate everything made of silver,so that it can be melted down into bullets,bayonets and cannon balls.A train speeds south from Washington and Lincoln and Willi are aboard.Adam himself,along with a contingent of many other vampires,raids the train in an effort to stop it.It is all for naught,as the train is just a decoy and Adam himself is killed by Abe.The silver laden weapons arrive for the Northern troops(on another train),and,as history would have it,they defeat the South.The film comes to its close as Abe and Mary are taking a carriage ride to the Ford Theatre.The film has some spectacular moments and two that stand out are the climactic confrontation on the train,and the other,the horse stampede scene culminating in Barts death.Tremendously done.Once the film pulls you into its core premise,the actual historical moments do blend terrifically well with the vampire dynamic.Attention to historical detail is paramount in a film like this,and the makers deliver it in spades.From the period clothing to the look of Washington/the White House in the 1800s,it has it all.The inclusion of the Black plot line,also gives the film that much more credibility,from the inclusion of his lifelong friend Willi to the mention of slaves as food and its sparking of the war.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1.The only extra is a featurette on the films making.All in all a solidly acted and skilfully blended mixture of the historical and the fatastical;a famous president's unknown but plausible connection to vampires.Well done.4 solid stars..",4,A seemless blending of two genres!,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,4778,"['Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'released',

Clearly a lot of money went into the numerous set-piece battle scenes, with growling vampires springing from the shadows everywhere, snarling and savaging mortals, and Abe Lincoln whirling kung fu-like and flailing and chopping away at them with his trusty axe.  Indeed, the entire shebang culminates in wave upon wave of vampires assaulting a Union train carrying the silver bullets and munitions necessary to defeat the vampires, who have thrown in with the Confederacy to battle Abe and the North. Blood splatters everywhere, heads literally roll, as the train barrels toward apparent doom.  But we get ahead of ourselves.  Suffice to say that the script is truly awful -- beyond awful.  Yeah, they made the mistake of letting the novelist write the screenplay, although with a story this ridiculous it would probably be hard to do it with a straight face.  Here are some dialogue samples: ""Vampires are real, Mr. Lincoln.  They exist.  In every state, in every union."" Spoken to Abe, who is being trained in killing vampires with his trusty axe: ""Do you promise to commit to the life of the hunter, and put aside feelings of vengeance?"" (I kid you not.)  And when Lincoln is a little too wimpy with his axe, although he is being urged to hate, hate hate: ""What do you hate, Mr. Lincoln?  Real power doesn't come from hate, but from truth."" And later: ""Your enemies have the power to render themselves invisible.""  Yes, this awful, overly dramatic, wooden, stilted dialogue plods on and on, at times silly and embarrassing.  ""Vampires have been in the New World for centuries.  They built an empire in the South.  But in recent years they have been moving north.""  Abe to Mary Todd, his bride-to-be: ""You want to know the truth, Mary? Every night I go out and kill vampires."" Later, Abe turns more noble: ""I would fight not with an axe, but with words and ideals.""  Mary to Abe: ""You've gotta eat, Abe.  You're only human.""  And on the eve of the Civil War, the head vampire tells President Jefferson Davis: ""Rest assured, Mr. Davis, you'll have as many of my kind as you need.""  And poor Abe, fraught with remorse, troubled by the fact that vampires have infiltrated his playroom and bitten his son, taking the poor lad's life: ""How can I win a war if I can't even protect my own family?""  It's not only Abe who is troubled.  On the eve of Gettysburg, the vampires lament: ""It's time we had a nation of our own.  Come on, we've got a train to catch.""  No, I am not making this up.  All of this is too bad, because the battle scenes are quite elaborate and clearly a great deal of money was spent on this.

I grew up believing that a stake through the heart was the only way to kill vampires and that silver was for werewolves.While recognizing that ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" is fiction, the courageous depiction of Mary Lincoln was completely unrealistic.Finally, while understanding that sex sells, the brief sexuality was totally unnecessary and added nothing to the movie.

At his mother&#8217;s grave, he resolves to kill the guy, not knowing that he is part of the undead.Lincoln meets a man who claims to know how to get revenge, teaches him in the ways of whipping around an axe until it goes faster than the eye can follow. Lincoln also learns martial arts moves and runs up walls so he can jump down and swing faster.Obviously one rolls one&#8217;s eyes, since martial arts was basically unknown in American society in the mid-19th century.Still, it&#8217;s fun seeing the vampires get together to create a nation of their own, complete with a 5000 year old vampire who supports the South, so the slaves can be a constant source of blood for them.  Yikes!An ocean of horses, as a vampire runs and jumps from horse to horse, and breaks a few of the animals&#8217; necks as he is chased by Honest Abe.  No animals were hurt, since the CGI horses cannot be killed.  But wow, so realistic!The story is even better when we get to Abe stumping for president.  When we see the guy before a mighty (CGI) crowd, giving his Emancipation Proclamation (look it up!) it is an amazing thing.Tim Burton helped produce this one and it shows with the crazy imagery and the horrific attacks by the vampires.Historic Perspective:Yes, little Willie Lincoln did die at 11 years, though I&#8217;m doubtful it was by a vengeful vampire back from Abe&#8217;s youth to wreak havoc on his family.Yes, the Union had a hard time at Gettysburg, though I doubt it was because of vampires being indestructible to lead bullets, nor that getting silver bullets and silver cannonballs turned the tide of war.If there was a 5,000 year old vampire who witnessed the Jews being slaves to Egypt, why did it take Adam so dang long to get a following and a nation?  You&#8217;d think after the first 2000 years he might get bored or something.  Oh well.Bottom Line:The film is gory, horrific and a lot of fun.  If you&#8217;re a Civil War enthusiast, you&#8217;ll have a lot more fun pointing out inaccuracies and such or even understanding the puns and humor of the tale.I enjoyed the special features too, though the meeting of Lincoln and Poe and such were stretching it a bit.",4,Civil War Horror -- Lincoln Swings a Mean Axe!,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,2570,"['Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'HunterGreat', 'story', 'would', 'think', 'viewer', 'must', 'have', 'understanding', 'Civil', 'War', 'history', 'understand', 'goings-on', 'film.If', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'who', 'Harriet', 'Tubman', 'Underground', 'Railroad', 'Jefferson', 'Davis', 'Stephen', 'Douglas', 'might', 'struggle', 'story.We', 'meet', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'boy', 'mother', 'killed', 'vampire', 'mother', '8217', 's', 'grave', 'kill', 'guy', 'not', 'knowing', 'part', 'undead.Lincoln', 'man', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'revenge', 'ways', 'whipping', 'axe', 'faster', 'eye', 'can', 'follow', 'Lincoln', 'also', 'martial', 'arts', 'moves', 'up', 'walls', 'can', 'jump', 'down', 'swing', 'faster.Obviously', 'one', 'one', '8217', 's', 'eyes', 'martial', 'arts', 'was', 'basically', 'unknown', 'American', 'society', 'mid-19th', 'century.Still', '8217', 'fun', 'seeing', 'vampires', 'get', 'together', 'create', 'nation', 'own', 'complete', '5000', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'who', 'South', 'slaves', 'can', 'be', 'constant', 'source', 'blood', 'Yikes', 'ocean', 'horses', 'vampire', 'jumps', 'horse', 'horse', 'few', 'animals', '8217', 'necks', 'chased', 'Honest', 'Abe', 'animals', 'were', 'hurt', 'CGI', 'horses', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'killed', 'wow', 'so', 'realistic', 'story', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'get', 'Abe', 'stumping', 'president', 'When', 'see', 'guy', 'mighty', 'CGI', 'crowd', 'giving', 'Emancipation', 'Proclamation', 'look', 'up', 'amazing', 'thing.Tim', 'Burton', 'helped', 'produce', 'one', 'crazy', 'imagery', 'horrific', 'attacks', 'vampires.Historic', 'Perspective', 'Yes', 'little', 'Willie', 'Lincoln', 'did', 'die', '11', 'years', '8217', 'doubtful', 'was', 'vengeful', 'vampire', 'back', 'Abe', '8217', 'youth', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'family.Yes', 'Union', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'Gettysburg', 'doubt', 'was', 'vampires', 'being', 'indestructible', 'lead', 'bullets', 'getting', 'silver', 'bullets', 'silver', 'cannonballs', 'turned', 'tide', 'war.If', 'was', '5,000', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'who', 'witnessed', 'Jews', 'being', 'slaves', 'Egypt', 'why', 'did', 'take', 'Adam', 'so', 'dang', 'long', 'get', 'following', 'nation', '8217', 'think', 'first', '2000', 'years', 'might', 'get', 'bored', 'something', 'Oh', 'well.Bottom', 'Line', 'film', 'gory', 'horrific', 'lot', 'fun', '8217', 're', 'Civil', 'War', 'enthusiast', '8217', 'll', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'pointing', 'out', 'inaccuracies', 'such', 'even', 'understanding', 'puns', 'humor', 'tale.I', 'enjoyed', 'special', 'features', 'too', 'meeting', 'Lincoln', 'Poe', 'such', 'were', 'stretching', 'bit']",N/A

In 1900, a complete reconstruction of Lincoln's tomb was undertaken, and the Lincolns' remains were exhumed, before Lincoln was finally placed back in the white marble sarcophagus that Mullen and Hughes had opened so easily in 1876.[8] In April 25, 1901, upon completion of the reconstruction, Robert Todd Lincoln visited the tomb. He was unhappy with the disposition of his father's remains and decided that it was necessary to build a permanent crypt for his father. Lincoln's coffin would be placed in a steel cage 10 feet (3.0 m) deep and encased in concrete in the floor of the tomb. On September 26, 1901, Lincoln's body was exhumed so that it could be re-interred in the newly built crypt. However, those present (a total of 23 people) feared that his body might have been stolen in the intervening years, so they decided to open the coffin and check.[10][edit] Last viewingIt was said that a harsh choking smell arose when the casket was opened. Lincoln was perfectly recognizable, even more than thirty years after his death. His face was a bronze color from the gunshot wound that shattered the bones in his face and damaged the tissue. The color was unhealed bruises. His hair, beard and mole were all perfectly preserved although his eyebrows were gone. His suit was covered with a yellow mold and his gloves had rotted on his hands. On his chest, they could see some bits of red fabric -- remnants of the American flag with which he was buried, which had by then disintegrated.

I'm not even talking about slaying vampires, though good work on that ol' Abe, keeping America safe for democracy from vamps and all. But how about chopping down a tree with one sing of an axe, defying gravity while ridding piggyback on an old stead, okay a magnificent stallion. I guess what I'm saying is, this movie requires a whole four scores and then some suspension of disbelief. If you can do such, it's a not too bad, but hardly memorable addition to the over crowded sub-genre of vampire flicks.Coming from Russian born director Timur Bekmauketov, who has directed the equally facile, but stylish Wanted and the Night/Day Watch movies. His stuff looks good, no question, he keeps the camera moving and the action always on the go, but it never adds up to anything of substance. Based on a graphic novel of the same name by Seth Grahame-Smith, who also wrote the muddled script. Everything has a cartoonish look and feel, the CGI vamps most of all, so there are no scares and little atmosphere. Highlighted by so astonishing action set pieces in the third act, especially the showdown upon a fast moving train.Benjamin Walker makes a passable Lincoln, though one would suspect the real honest Abe had to have been charismatic to reach the political heights that he did. Given a truly superb make-up job, there are forty-five people credit with the various make-up and hair styles, etc used to successfully turn Walker into an unmistakable Abraham Lincoln. The supporting cast is especially strong with good work coming from Rufus Sewell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the picture's main villian and Mary Todd, respectably, but the real scene stealer is Dominic Cooper, the English actor so good last year in the criminally underrated the Devil's Double, here playing Abe's partner in vampire staking with a secret agenda all his own.In all, I can be said that Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, is nothing special and hardly a must see. However, there is an audience prime and waiting for this kind of movie. And as it is, it is a pretty fun mindless, but utterly forgettable film. At least on DVD/blu-ray you can avoid the awful 3-D that I saw it in when I went to the multiplex.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",3,Lacks bite,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2379,"['are', 'believe', 'half', 'things', 'learn', 'Abe', 'Lincoln', 'new', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'greater', 'man', 'give', 'credit', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'talking', 'slaying', 'vampires', 'though', 'good', 'work', 'ol', 'Abe', 'keeping', 'America', 'safe', 'democracy', 'vamps', 'how', 'chopping', 'down', 'tree', 'one', 'sing', 'axe', 'defying', 'gravity', 'ridding', 'piggyback', 'old', 'stead', 'magnificent', 'stallion', 'guess', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'movie', 'whole', 'four', 'scores', 'then', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'can', 'do', 'such', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'hardly', 'memorable', 'addition', 'over', 'crowded', 'sub-genre', 'vampire', 'flicks.Coming', 'Russian', 'born', 'director', 'Timur', 'Bekmauketov', 'who', 'directed', 'equally', 'facile', 'stylish', 'Wanted', 'Night/Day', 'Watch', 'movies', 'stuff', 'good', 'question', 'camera', 'moving', 'action', 'always', 'go', 'never', 'up', 'anything', 'substance', 'Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Seth', 'Grahame-Smith', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'muddled', 'script', 'Everything', 'cartoonish', 'look', 'feel', 'CGI', 'most', 'are', 'scares', 'little', 'atmosphere', 'Highlighted', 'so', 'astonishing', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'third', 'act', 'especially', 'showdown', 'fast', 'moving', 'train.Benjamin', 'Walker', 'passable', 'Lincoln', 'one', 'would', 'suspect', 'real', 'honest', 'Abe', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'charismatic', 'reach', 'political', 'heights', 'did', 'Given', 'truly', 'superb', 'make-up', 'job', 'are', 'forty-five', 'people', 'credit', 'various', 'make-up', 'hair', 'styles', 'etc', 'used', 'successfully', 'turn', 'Walker', 'unmistakable', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'strong', 'good', 'work', 'coming', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'picture', 'main', 'villian', 'Mary', 'Todd', 'respectably', 'real', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'English', 'actor', 'so', 'good', 'last', 'year', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'Devil', 'Double', 'here', 'playing', 'Abe', 'partner', 'vampire', 'staking', 'secret', 'agenda', 'own.In', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'nothing', 'special', 'hardly', 'must', 'see', 'However', 'audience', 'prime', 'waiting', 'kind', 'movie', 'pretty', 'fun', 'mindless', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'film', 'least', 'DVD/blu-ray', 'can', 'avoid', 'awful', '3-D', 'saw', 'when', 'went', 'multiplex.Check', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",N/A
1477043,A246YIFE5M6M2C,B005LAIHYU,"Shawn Kovacich ""Shawn Kovacich""","[23, 34]","Well I just got back from the midnight showing of this film and I have to admit that I think they did a pretty good adaptation from the novel,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunterby Seth Grahame-Smith, although admittedly there was quite a bit left out and a few minor changes were quite apparent. The primary reason why you should never read the book before seeing the movie, you will almost always end up being disappointed in the big screen adaption. However, I must admit that this may very well not be the case in this particular instance. Your main cast of characters include Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln, whom you may recall seeing in the movie,Flags of Our Fathersdirected by Clint Eastwood. I kept watching his character and trying to place him but just couldn't until I realized that the reason he looks so familiar is that he could pass for a young Liam Neeson or perhaps even an older son. Rufus Sewell plays the vampire villain, Adam with a fiendishly clever and quite believable style that makes him a very despicable villain, one of his many roles that you might recall was the pompous knight in,A Knight's Talealong side the late Heath Ledger, or perhaps as the evil crown prince in the very well done and quite intriguing movie,The Illusionist, which also starred Edward Norton in perhaps one of his best performances to date. Rounding out the cast is Dominic Cooper as Abraham's confidant and vampire hunter/killer trainer; Henry, Anthony Mackie as Abraham's boyhood friend Will, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Abraham's love interest and eventual wife, Mary Todd.The movie starts out with Abraham as a young boy and tells the story of his upbringing and rise to prominence as perhaps the most beloved of all our Presidents, while also being the one man who not only brought this great nation together as one after being divided for so long with brother fighting against brother during the Civil War, but also as our savior as a nation of free living men instead of a nation of vampires. Which as you will come to find out in the movie, actually fought against the Union by taking sides with the Confederacy.I was particularly impressed with the way the movie, for the most part, tried to blend historical fact with vampirical fantasy to make for a very entertaining movie. It almost, and I do mean almost, makes you wonder if perhaps just maybe it might have been possible. Okay, nobody really believes that, but suspend believe for awhile and simply enjoy the telling of an alternate reality. I really didn't have any complaints with the movie because we are working from a fantastical point of reference and not one based entirely on historical accuracy. I did however really enjoy the fact that in the movie Abraham chooses to dispatch his undead foes with the blade of a very well balanced axe instead of a variety of firearms that he had been offered. When Abraham starts swinging that axe around in a quite unique and very precise manner, you will really become quite anxious waiting for him to start hacking his way through the undead hordes. And you won't have to wait for very long before he does.The ending of the movie was also very well done and without spoiling it for anyone, I was left feeling just a bit unfulfilled as I had envisioned a bit different or perhaps I should say a more final, yet unique ending to go with the existing story. But having said that, you will not be disappointed in this movie at all.Shawn Kovacich100% Movie AficionadoAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.",5,Fascinating Blending of Historical Fact and Vampirical Fantasy,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,3528,"['Well', 'just', 'got', 'back', 'midnight', 'showing', 'film', 'have', 'admit', 'think', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunterby', 'Seth', 'Grahame-Smith', 'admittedly', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'left', 'out', 'few', 'minor', 'changes', 'were', 'quite', 'apparent', 'primary', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'will', 'almost', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'disappointed', 'big', 'screen', 'adaption', 'However', 'must', 'admit', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'particular', 'instance', 'main', 'cast', 'characters', 'include', 'Benjamin', 'Walker', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'whom', 'may', 'recall', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Flags', 'Fathersdirected', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'kept', 'watching', 'character', 'trying', 'place', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'realized', 'reason', 'so', 'familiar', 'could', 'pass', 'young', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'perhaps', 'even', 'older', 'son', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'vampire', 'villain', 'Adam', 'fiendishly', 'clever', 'quite', 'believable', 'style', 'very', 'despicable', 'villain', 'one', 'many', 'roles', 'might', 'recall', 'was', 'pompous', 'knight', 'Knight', 'Talealong', 'side', 'late', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'perhaps', 'evil', 'crown', 'prince', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'Illusionist', 'also', 'starred', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'date', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Abraham', 'confidant', 'vampire', 'hunter/killer', 'trainer', 'Henry', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Abraham', 'boyhood', 'friend', 'Will', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Abraham', 'love', 'interest', 'eventual', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Todd.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Abraham', 'young', 'boy', 'story', 'upbringing', 'rise', 'prominence', 'perhaps', 'most', 'beloved', 'Presidents', 'also', 'being', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'brought', 'great', 'nation', 'together', 'one', 'being', 'divided', 'so', 'long', 'brother', 'fighting', 'brother', 'Civil', 'War', 'also', 'savior', 'nation', 'free', 'living', 'men', 'instead', 'nation', 'vampires', 'Which', 'will', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'movie', 'actually', 'fought', 'Union', 'taking', 'sides', 'Confederacy.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'way', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'tried', 'blend', 'historical', 'fact', 'vampirical', 'fantasy', 'make', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'almost', 'do', 'mean', 'almost', 'wonder', 'perhaps', 'just', 'maybe', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'Okay', 'nobody', 'really', 'suspend', 'believe', 'awhile', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'telling', 'alternate', 'reality', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'complaints', 'movie', 'are', 'working', 'fantastical', 'point', 'reference', 'not', 'one', 'based', 'entirely', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'did', 'however', 'really', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'movie', 'Abraham', 'dispatch', 'undead', 'foes', 'blade', 'very', 'well', 'balanced', 'axe', 'instead', 'variety', 'firearms', 'had', 'been', 'offered', 'When', 'Abraham', 'swinging', 'axe', 'around', 'quite', 'unique', 'very', 'precise', 'manner', 'will', 'really', 'become', 'quite', 'anxious', 'waiting', 'start', 'hacking', 'way', 'undead', 'hordes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'very', 'long', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'spoiling', 'anyone', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'just', 'bit', 'unfulfilled', 'had', 'envisioned', 'bit', 'different', 'perhaps', 'should', 'say', 'more', 'final', 'yet', 'unique', 'ending', 'go', 'existing', 'story', 'having', 'said', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'all.Shawn', 'Kovacich100', '%', 'Movie', 'AficionadoAuthor', 'Creator', 'numerous', 'books', 'DVD']",N/A

1477072,A2UTKYA2U8542F,B005LAIHYU,Steve Reina,"[0, 0]","As readers of alternative history are all too aware, the suspension of disbelief is critical to enjoying novels like this one which tell the story of Abraham Lincoln and his life long war against vampires.To my eye, the art is probably at its highest form with writers like Professor Harry Turtledove, whose extended education in the area(s) they embellish can't help but make their stories all the more believeable. A great case in point of this type of writing at its high point is probably his In the Balance four part series where Turtledove revisits World War II, albeit in an altered form where space aliens invade Earth midway, much the chargin of existing the then existing Earth combatants.On the other side, the art has its low points.  To my eye many examples of these can be seen in the cheapie What If books you can find on sale in many bookstore bins that are marked with the words CLEARANCE SPECIAL.Happily this book is closer to the high point than the low point.  And throughout the story the author reveals not only a good working knowledge of Abraham Lincoln's true biography but also an even better knowledge of the way people wrote and expressed themselves back then.  To my reading, there's probably no better writing in this book than when the author is writing and using Abraham Lincoln's 19th century voice to express himself.That having been said, this book is still not on par with the highest of the high and that's because for knowledgeable Lincoln readers there were several factual mistatements that were made thoughout the text.  The most obvious one was when Edwin M. Stanton was described as being part of Abraham Lincoln's cabinet in 1861 (before even Ft. Sumter as a matter of fact) when in fact Stanton didn't join the cabinet until the next year.On the one hand readers could say who cares about a factual mistatement in a book which discusses Lincoln's career as a vampire hunter.  However I think the better argument is still that when you're trying to tell a really outlandish story about a history character, it's probably best to keep your verifiable historical mis statements to a minimum.Because the artistry and creativity of this story was as otherwise good as it was though, this book still deserves five stars.  It's a fun ride and new readers of this book should be advised to come ready to suspend disbelief and have a good time.",5,On the suspension of disbelief,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,2380,"['readers', 'alternative', 'history', 'are', 'too', 'aware', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'critical', 'enjoying', 'novels', 'one', 'tell', 'story', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'long', 'war', 'vampires.To', 'eye', 'art', 'probably', 'highest', 'form', 'writers', 'Professor', 'Harry', 'Turtledove', 'extended', 'education', 'area', 'embellish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'stories', 'more', 'believeable', 'great', 'case', 'point', 'type', 'writing', 'high', 'point', 'probably', 'Balance', 'four', 'part', 'series', 'where', 'Turtledove', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'albeit', 'altered', 'form', 'where', 'space', 'invade', 'Earth', 'midway', 'much', 'chargin', 'existing', 'then', 'existing', 'Earth', 'combatants.On', 'other', 'side', 'art', 'low', 'points', 'eye', 'many', 'examples', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'cheapie', 'What', 'books', 'can', 'find', 'sale', 'many', 'bookstore', 'bins', 'are', 'marked', 'words', 'CLEARANCE', 'SPECIAL.Happily', 'book', 'closer', 'high', 'point', 'low', 'point', 'story', 'author', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'working', 'knowledge', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'true', 'biography', 'also', 'even', 'better', 'knowledge', 'way', 'people', 'wrote', 'expressed', 'back', 'then', 'reading', 'probably', 'better', 'writing', 'book', 'when', 'author', 'writing', 'using', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', '19th', 'century', 'voice', 'express', 'himself.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'book', 'still', 'not', 'par', 'highest', 'high', 'knowledgeable', 'Lincoln', 'readers', 'were', 'several', 'factual', 'mistatements', 'were', 'made', 'text', 'most', 'obvious', 'one', 'was', 'when', 'Edwin', 'M.', 'Stanton', 'was', 'described', 'being', 'part', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'cabinet', '1861', 'even', 'Ft.', 'Sumter', 'matter', 'fact', 'when', 'fact', 'Stanton', 'did', ""n't"", 'join', 'cabinet', 'next', 'year.On', 'one', 'hand', 'readers', 'could', 'say', 'who', 'factual', 'mistatement', 'book', 'Lincoln', 'career', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'However', 'think', 'better', 'argument', 'still', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'tell', 'really', 'outlandish', 'story', 'history', 'character', 'probably', 'best', 'keep', 'verifiable', 'historical', 'mis', 'statements', 'minimum.Because', 'artistry', 'creativity', 'story', 'was', 'otherwise', 'good', 'was', 'though', 'book', 'still', 'five', 'stars', 'fun', 'ride', 'new', 'readers', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'advised', 'come', 'ready', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'have', 'good', 'time']",N/A

Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) vows revenge and is taken under the tutoring of Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) a backwoods Van Helsing. In spite of the vampire's brute strength, our rail splitter is able to keep pace. These are not real vampires, but those new Hollywood ""Twilight"" vampires that can go out into the sunlight.The events of Lincoln's life is at times out of sequence and incorrect. They put a disclaimer at the beginning of the film saying history isn't always recorded correctly. That is all fine and well, but they should have made it a little closer to demonstrate the writer took some time to do some research. As a vampire film, this has a few good special effects, but nothing we haven't seen before. There are plenty of vampire films out there I thought were vastly superior to this one.

I thought Asylum (Lincoln vs Zombies)did a better job at integrating history. They spent a lot of money for special effects and a substandard script.

Historically, Lincoln has little resemblance to this infantile character (e.g. Lincoln did not support emancipation until the very end and only as a means to finally end the war.  Slavery was not an issue that was ""dear to his heart."" In fact, he punished the ""anti-slavery crowd"" severely when they broke the law and was in favor of runaway slaves being returned to their owners).  This vampire hunter spends most of the screen time ranting anti-slavery slogans as if he were John Brown while whipping an ax around like a bad kung fu movie hero and all the while questioning whether or not he should hold hands with Mary Todd.  There is no suspense in this lifeless, dull, and wandering piece of drivel.  There is nothing remotely scary about the movie.  The vampires are dull and stereotypical.  They have huge teeth and the effect has been seen previously in numerous films. They seem impotent for the most part and are too easily killed (Lincoln single handily dispatches with about 8 of the them at once!) The BIG SCENE in which Lincoln jumps from horse to horse during a stampede while he attempts to chop up a really bad vampire is silly.  It gives a bad name to CGI.  Save your time and money.  If you want a good vampire movie try 30 Days of Night.

This is a fine piece of entertainment though. A rather silly movie that proves to just be a fun watch. It's far from perfect and I certainly do have complaints. I think the movie takes itself too seriously. It could have probably used a bit more comedy as I found it impossible to take the plot as serious as the filmmakers seemed to.  I have not read the book on which this is based, so I do not know if there was a similar tone there, but I just felt that it could use a little more of a satirical touch. That said, it's still an entertaining if uneven movie.The fight scenes in the movie range from somewhat ridiculous (the horseback fight) to extremely entertaining (the train). Some of the ideas seem pretty clever, and I particularly liked Abe's first fight with a vampire. All of the cast members do a decent to good job, with some performances actually being fairly effective.Technical aspects: The blu-ray looks okay. Maybe I've been spoiled by really good looking movies recently (such as Brave) but this one seemed to be an average Blu-ray release. Better than DVD but not the film to show off your home theater system with. The 3D is acceptable, again not the best but there's nothing particularly wrong with it.Special features are rather basic with a trailer, music video and documentary. The most interesting feature is probably the commentary with writer Grahame-Smith, who ranges from very interesting (discussing Lincoln's actual life as a sort of superhero origin story) to rather dull (just describing the events you see on screen). Rather a mixed bag there.Would I recommend this movie? That would really depend. I found it entertaining, I had fun with it, but those looking for a movie with more comedy may be disappointed, as would film goers looking for an actually scary movie.

Oh right: Snakes on a Plane.You think that producers would have realized after Snakes on a Plane that just because you have a goofy, over the top premise with a silly title that catches the attention of the internet does not mean you have a successful movie on your hands.  Just like Snakes on a Plane, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter will be referenced in movie-related jokes for years to come, but that's about it.  It exists in pop culture as a title; not a movie.  If everyone who referenced, or joked about Snakes on a Plane had actually seen it the film would have been a megahit.  The same holds true for Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.People will undoubtedly say ""But it's supposed to be funny!""  No.  The only thing you can call an intentional joke is ""Abraham Lincoln fighting vampires.""  That's it!  You see it in the title, the trailer, you laugh at those, and then the joke wears off.  After you get past the trailer there is no legitimate joke in this movie.What had me laughing out loud during this movie was how serious it took itself and how cartoonish the action sequences became.  This movie does not play itself for laughs.  These action scenes are played straight (or at least as straight as Matrix inspired action scenes can be played), and then halfway through the movie they decide Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is an appropriate film to give a lecture on why slavery is bad.  At least Snakes on a Plane never made any attempts to lecture an audience on the matter of racism.One action sequence in particular I would like to highlight as arguably the most sloppily choreographed, outlandish action sequence of 2012:  A young Abraham Lincoln pursues a vampire and through a series of events gets caught in a horse stampede.  All the horses are computer generated (and 90% of the scene so are Abe and the vampire) and both the characters are jumping onto horses, getting dragged, knocked around, and at one point the vampire spins a horse like Super Mario before hurling it at Lincoln.  That sounds fun, right?  On paper it does, but on screen I had no idea what was going on!  Everything was CGI: the horses, the actors, and they had warped into the blue screen backgrounds of 300.  Then when it ends the characters randomly fall back into a real set.  This scene is just a mess on every technical level imaginable.I laughed at scenes like this because of how sloppily they were handled, and how incomprehensible the jumble of special effects on screen was.  Not because the actions depicted were goofy (and they certainly were).  I ended up laughing at the film; not with it.The movie should have ended with young Lincoln before he went into politics.  Just call it a day on ""And that was the secret young days of Abraham Lincoln.""  But it doesn't.  No, instead the movie decides to insultingly dumb down American history while playing it completely straight.  Playing a joke straight is something that usually gets a laugh out of me, but when you simplify the Civil War ""Vampires run the South and want slaves to help feed them"" without ever winking at the camera I find myself frustrated rather than amused.When this movie tries tying actual history into its campy story it just feels wrong, and out of place.  Having Abraham Lincoln's youngest son be killed by a vampire just made me feel unclean.  If the movie was going to be a campy action story featuring Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter they should have gone all the way into the realm of camp, but instead they try making it tie into real life tragedies, and issues relating to slavery.  I don't know, you could easily enjoy this, but it just rubbed me the wrong way.  It needed to go all the way into the realm of camp or not bother making the film at all.I did watch it with friends and we had a blast riffing the film, and honestly, if you're just looking for a goofy film to watch with some friends Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter isn't too bad a pick.  I can't imagine you enjoying this movie much without some friends chuckling along and adding commentary.  Just know there are better, goofier movies out there that don't have any pretenses to attempt lecturing you on racism and history.",3,Just watch the trailer,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,4477,"['know', 'where', 'makers', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'were', 'coming', 'wanted', 'goofy', 'top', 'action', 'movie', 'title', 'would', 'instantly', 'catch', 'person', 'attention', 'something', 'would', 'surely', 'get', 'folk', 'internet', 'talking', 'Where', 'did', 'hear', 'marketing', 'gimmick', 'Oh', 'right', 'Snakes', 'Plane.You', 'think', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'realized', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'just', 'have', 'goofy', 'top', 'premise', 'silly', 'title', 'attention', 'internet', 'not', 'mean', 'have', 'successful', 'movie', 'hands', 'Just', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'will', 'be', 'referenced', 'movie-related', 'jokes', 'years', 'come', 'pop', 'culture', 'title', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'who', 'referenced', 'joked', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'had', 'actually', 'seen', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'megahit', 'same', 'true', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter.People', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'say', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'No', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'call', 'intentional', 'joke', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'fighting', 'vampires', 'see', 'title', 'trailer', 'laugh', 'then', 'joke', 'get', 'trailer', 'legitimate', 'joke', 'movie.What', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'serious', 'took', 'how', 'cartoonish', 'action', 'sequences', 'became', 'movie', 'not', 'play', 'laughs', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'straight', 'least', 'as', 'straight', 'Matrix', 'inspired', 'action', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'then', 'halfway', 'movie', 'decide', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'appropriate', 'film', 'give', 'lecture', 'why', 'slavery', 'bad', 'least', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'never', 'made', 'attempts', 'lecture', 'audience', 'matter', 'racism.One', 'action', 'sequence', 'particular', 'would', 'like', 'highlight', 'arguably', 'most', 'sloppily', 'choreographed', 'outlandish', 'action', 'sequence', '2012', 'young', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'vampire', 'series', 'events', 'caught', 'horse', 'stampede', 'horses', 'are', 'computer', 'generated', '90', '%', 'scene', 'so', 'are', 'Abe', 'vampire', 'characters', 'are', 'jumping', 'horses', 'getting', 'dragged', 'knocked', 'one', 'point', 'vampire', 'horse', 'Super', 'Mario', 'hurling', 'Lincoln', 'fun', 'right', 'paper', 'screen', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Everything', 'was', 'CGI', 'horses', 'actors', 'had', 'warped', 'blue', 'screen', 'backgrounds', '300', 'Then', 'when', 'characters', 'randomly', 'fall', 'back', 'real', 'set', 'scene', 'just', 'mess', 'technical', 'level', 'imaginable.I', 'laughed', 'scenes', 'how', 'sloppily', 'were', 'handled', 'how', 'incomprehensible', 'jumble', 'special', 'effects', 'screen', 'was', 'Not', 'actions', 'depicted', 'were', 'goofy', 'certainly', 'were', 'ended', 'up', 'laughing', 'film', 'not', 'it.The', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'young', 'Lincoln', 'went', 'politics', 'Just', 'call', 'day', 'was', 'secret', 'young', 'days', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', ""n't"", 'No', 'instead', 'movie', 'insultingly', 'dumb', 'down', 'American', 'history', 'playing', 'completely', 'straight', 'Playing', 'joke', 'straight', 'something', 'usually', 'laugh', 'when', 'simplify', 'Civil', 'War', 'Vampires', 'run', 'South', 'want', 'slaves', 'help', 'feed', 'ever', 'winking', 'camera', 'find', 'frustrated', 'rather', 'amused.When', 'movie', 'tying', 'actual', 'history', 'campy', 'story', 'just', 'feels', 'wrong', 'place', 'Having', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'youngest', 'son', 'be', 'killed', 'vampire', 'just', 'made', 'feel', 'unclean', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'campy', 'action', 'story', 'featuring', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'realm', 'camp', 'instead', 'try', 'making', 'tie', 'real', 'life', 'tragedies', 'issues', 'relating', 'slavery', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'easily', 'enjoy', 'just', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'needed', 'go', 'way', 'realm', 'camp', 'not', 'making', 'film', 'all.I', 'did', 'watch', 'friends', 'had', 'blast', 'riffing', 'film', 'honestly', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'goofy', 'film', 'watch', 'friends', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'pick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'much', 'friends', 'chuckling', 'along', 'adding', 'commentary', 'Just', 'know', 'are', 'better', 'goofier', 'movies', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pretenses', 'attempt', 'lecturing', 'racism', 'history']",N/A
