The series has a message about life and in some episodes is comical about what is going on. I grew up watching it on tv. He tries not to kill if possible and tries to avoid fights if possible.

1605905,A3DQBSA9YPD8GZ,B00A4Y614G,Doug,"[1, 4]","This is a very good show excepting that John Payne plays a fast gun who everyone knows is a fast gun.  He plays a good gunfighter and generally shoots a lot of bad guys.  He doesn't seem to fit the role as a tough nice guy gunfighter even though he was a boxer before he became an actor.  He just does not seem to have the look of a tough guy.He is the same actor who played the boyfriend in the original ""Miracle on 34th Street"".  Imagine making that movie in today's world!I don't know how many tough nice guy gunfighters there were in real life.  Maybe, that is why show didn't last too long.  Zero supporting cast or character development.  However, it is a good western for a weekend or a slow day.

Wymore ""Golden Age of Hollywood fan""","[2, 2]","I was only a baby when this series was on the air so I don't remember it.In my adult years, I've become a big fan of John Payne and I enjoy almost all of the films he's been in (one by one, they are slowly being released on DVD - although ""Sun Valley Serenade"" is still only available on VHS).I had purchased 2 of the other Restless Gun boxed sets a few years ago but I was disappointed that they only contained a small portion of the series.Well, I spent the money all over again to get the complete series and I can say that I'm only disappointed that this wasn't released first! I guess Timeless Video had to see if there was a market for it first prior to releasing the entire series.It's kind of fun watching the episodes back to back. The same actors appear in different roles (something you wouldn't notice if you watched on a weekly basis) and the same scenery is used for a variety of towns and trails. I guess those same actors were under contract to Universal at the time so they just used them multiple times. Many of them went on to be famous later on: Michael Landon, James Coburn, Jack Elam, Dan Blocker. Some of them were co-workers from John Payne's days at Fox like James Gleason.",5,Spent the money all over again - and worth it!,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1198,"['was', 'only', 'baby', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'air', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'it.In', 'adult', 'years', ""'ve"", 'become', 'big', 'fan', 'John', 'Payne', 'enjoy', 'almost', 'films', 'been', 'one', 'one', 'are', 'slowly', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'Sun', 'Valley', 'Serenade', 'still', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', '.I', 'had', 'purchased', '2', 'other', 'Restless', 'Gun', 'boxed', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'disappointed', 'only', 'contained', 'small', 'portion', 'series.Well', 'spent', 'money', 'over', 'again', 'get', 'complete', 'series', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'only', 'disappointed', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'first', 'guess', 'Timeless', 'Video', 'had', 'see', 'was', 'market', 'first', 'prior', 'releasing', 'entire', 'series.It', 'kind', 'fun', 'watching', 'episodes', 'back', 'back', 'same', 'actors', 'appear', 'different', 'roles', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'watched', 'weekly', 'basis', 'same', 'scenery', 'used', 'variety', 'towns', 'trails', 'guess', 'same', 'actors', 'were', 'contract', 'Universal', 'time', 'just', 'used', 'multiple', 'times', 'Many', 'went', 'be', 'famous', 'later', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Jack', 'Elam', 'Dan', 'Blocker', 'were', 'co-workers', 'John', 'Payne', 'days', 'Fox', 'James', 'Gleason']",N/A

Gunsmoke, Wyatt Earp and Wagon Train were the cr&egrave;me-de-la cr&egrave;me. The Restless Gun was not. It is great to have all the episodes in one set, presented by Timeless Media, but the story lines and acting relegate this series to 2nd tier status.
