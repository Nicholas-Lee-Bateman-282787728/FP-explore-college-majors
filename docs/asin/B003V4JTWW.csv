Low budget, not especially original, but with a few redeeming qualities.Bear is the story of two young couples stranded in a minivan in the California wilderness.  They are attacked by a vicious grizzly bear with a motive to kill.  But as night creeps on, the victims begin to deal with another problem: their own dark secrets.The good news is that the scenery makes for some decent visuals.  The film was shot in a California forest, and first time director John Rebel has a decent eye for nature scenes.  And kudos to the crew for helping to rebuild that forest when it was destroyed in an unrelated wildfire after filming.The bad news is that the film is extremely low budget.  It's plagued with bad lighting and lots of weak dialogue.  A real grizzly is used for most shots not involving people, but a laughably bad costume is used for closeups.  While I did find the movie's ""personal secrets"" angle to be actually interesting, it still doesn't change the fact that Bear is basically a ""Cujo"" ripoff.John Rebel is a first-time director, working with a shoestring budget.  That being said, you have to cut Bear some slack, don't expect a natural horror flick like Jaws.  I would definitely say that you shouldn't buy the DVD until you get a chance to rent it through Redbox first.",2,Not Really Horror - More About Revenge & Redemption,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,1345,"['Bear', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'most', 'Redbox', 'flicks', 'Low', 'budget', 'not', 'especially', 'original', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities.Bear', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'couples', 'stranded', 'minivan', 'California', 'wilderness', 'are', 'attacked', 'vicious', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'motive', 'kill', 'night', 'creeps', 'victims', 'begin', 'deal', 'problem', 'own', 'dark', 'secrets.The', 'good', 'news', 'scenery', 'decent', 'visuals', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'California', 'forest', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'John', 'Rebel', 'decent', 'eye', 'nature', 'scenes', 'kudos', 'crew', 'helping', 'rebuild', 'forest', 'when', 'was', 'destroyed', 'unrelated', 'wildfire', 'filming.The', 'bad', 'news', 'film', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'plagued', 'bad', 'lighting', 'lots', 'weak', 'dialogue', 'real', 'grizzly', 'used', 'most', 'shots', 'not', 'involving', 'people', 'laughably', 'bad', 'costume', 'used', 'closeups', 'did', 'find', 'movie', 'personal', 'secrets', 'angle', 'be', 'actually', 'interesting', 'still', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'Bear', 'basically', 'Cujo', 'ripoff.John', 'Rebel', 'first-time', 'director', 'working', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'being', 'said', 'have', 'cut', 'Bear', 'slack', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'natural', 'horror', 'flick', 'Jaws', 'would', 'definitely', 'say', 'should', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'get', 'chance', 'rent', 'Redbox', 'first']",N/A

1366697,A1WJZABTJOW65B,B003V4JTWW,"Michael A. Mccullough ""Argento Fan""","[4, 5]","Two couples jockeying for the cover of ""Too Stupid to Live"" Magazine decide to take a detour through a remote stretch of California forest. In no time their mini-van gets a flat. A grizzly bear wanders nearby. One of them panics, whips out a handgun, and unloads an entire clip into it. Mama bear arrives to find her cub dead. Now these four have to contend with a bigger, meaner, angrier bear with divine retribution on her mind, and they have no means to defend themselves since numbnuts already pumped all his bullets into the younger bear.Bear is rather bare bones plot-wise and almost as simplistic as its title. There is only so much you can do with a cast of four, a wrecked mini-van, and a live bear in a small section of woodland.The crux of the non-bear related drama centers around a successful stockbroker older brother constantly belittling his partying kid brother to give up his pipe dream of becoming a famous rock musician in favor of getting a real job, and while he's at it, he might want to consider getting a girlfriend that's more marriage material (that last part won't be an issue for very long). For a while there it seemed like these two brothers were in a race to see who could be the bigger jerk.Bear wastes almost no time getting right to these four broken down and trapped in their mini-van under siege by a pissed off bear. Entertaining enough; yet, the dilemma I found myself facing was whether or not I was supposed to be rooting for the people or the bear. Mama bear is right to be enraged, and all four initially came across as obnoxious yokels for whom grisly death would be doing the world a favor.Let's sample some of the actual dialogue during the first half of their bear attack ordeal.""Go! Go! Go! Go!""""Come on!""""Move! Move! Move!""""That's a big bear!""""Shhhhhhhhh!""""Did you hear that?""""What are you doing?""There were moments where I realized what a remake of William Girdler's Grizzly would sound like if written by Rob Zombie.This quartet's poor decision-making skills also left me wanting to slap my forehead. They had an opportunity to ram the bear to death with their vehicle as it was pressed against a tree, swiping at one of them that had climbed up to get away, but instead they just back the car up to the tree close enough for the person to jump down onto the roof to safety. Minutes later, now inside the wrecked mini-van the bear just toppled over before heading off to take a smoke break or something, the chance to flag down a passing truck is missed because these dolts try to get the driver's attention by staying inside the trashed car yelling and beating on the insides making muffled noises rather than actually getting out to flag the motorist down. After all of this has occurred, they're remarkably casual about their predicament until 'Smokey the Death Wish Bear' comes back to get the job done.",1,Worst. Movie.

1366700,A297HOYHX10FOD,B003V4JTWW,"S. Harris ""Steve Harris""","[1, 2]","Upon seeing this movie at the local Family Video, I thought that this movie would be similar to that of 1976's movie `Grizzly' in some way.  After putting in to watch the movie, the start of it seemed to have some kind of promise to it at the start of it.  Once it got to a point in the movie it seemed like that the bear was introduced a little too early possibly in this movie and wasn't expecting it to be around another 10 minutes later for it to make its appearance.  There is one thing that seems to be a little out of place though with this movie that I have noticed while watching the movie.  That was after the bear started attacking it seems like that the people trapped in the van were able to push it back on the tires with just four ordinary people, even when there was only two people left as well.Another thing that seemed to bug me was that this movie while it seemed like it had the premise of `Grizzly' (1976), but watching it, it seemed to be like that of Cujo but with a bear instead of a rabid St. Bernard.  Though I don't expect much from a `B' movie or even if this was a lower class movie, it seemed like that it didn't take much to make this movie let alone making it seem a little more realistic in some way.  While it's only 82 minutes long, don't seem like a long time for a movie like this but maybe it's best that it isn't that long.  Overall I think that this movie could've been better and I give it 1.5 stars out of 5.",1,A movie that seems to be like a mix between Grizzly and Cujo,1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,1451,"['seeing', 'movie', 'local', 'Family', 'Video', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'similar', '1976', 'movie', 'Grizzly', 'way', 'putting', 'watch', 'movie', 'start', 'seemed', 'have', 'kind', 'promise', 'start', 'got', 'point', 'movie', 'seemed', 'bear', 'was', 'introduced', 'little', 'too', 'early', 'possibly', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'be', '10', 'minutes', 'later', 'make', 'appearance', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'little', 'place', 'movie', 'have', 'noticed', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'bear', 'started', 'attacking', 'people', 'trapped', 'van', 'were', 'able', 'push', 'back', 'tires', 'just', 'four', 'ordinary', 'people', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'left', 'well.Another', 'thing', 'seemed', 'bug', 'was', 'movie', 'seemed', 'had', 'premise', 'Grizzly', '1976', 'watching', 'seemed', 'be', 'Cujo', 'bear', 'instead', 'rabid', 'St.', 'Bernard', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'B', 'movie', 'even', 'was', 'lower', 'class', 'movie', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'make', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'making', 'seem', 'little', 'more', 'realistic', 'way', 'only', '82', 'minutes', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'best', ""n't"", 'that', 'long', 'Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'give', '1.5', '5']",N/A

1366703,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B003V4JTWW,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","""Bear"" (2010) is a low-budget nature-runs-amok flick in the manner of ""Prey"" and ""Black Water."" Like those films, the plot is simple and the location confined. The plot consists of four people, a mini-van and an attacking bear, that's it. The location is the mini-van and the surrounding desert-like forest, that's it. A third shortcoming is that -- except for the first eight minutes -- the entire film takes place at night! (Thankfully, you can clearly see what's going on throughout).On the positive side, the story does stress characterization. In fact, the film gets increasingly more soap operatic as it moves along. On top of this is a very dramatic score along the lines of, say, ""The Passion of the Christ (Widescreen Edition)"" and all the actors give it their best shot.The film was shot in Angeles National Forest near Acton, CA, about an hour drive from Topanga State Park near Malibu, where ""Sasquatch Hunters"" was filmed. As such, there are some similarities: Both films involve a group of people being attacked by a large forest creature (or creatures), both take place in the same general vicinity, both have long stretches of night sequences, and both feature very dramatic scores. Regardless, ""Sasquatch Hunters"" is the better film, by far, because the plot and locations aren't one-dimensional. Another similar film is ""Night Skies (Widescreen Edition)"" because it also has a thin plot and the same general location (Santa Clarita), but like ""Sasquatch Hunters"" ""Night Skies"" is the better film simply because it's not as limited in scope (take, for instance, the excellent ending to ""Night Skies"").At 82 minutes this is a short film, but like ""Prey"" and ""Black Water"" it's sometimes hard to sit through just because it's so one-dimensional. Fortunately, the character dramatics, the score and the REAL bear tend to hold your attention, but just barely.Despite its shortcomings, you have to respect director John Rebel because in many ways this is a respectable film made on a very small budget with a real bear and worthy actors. He did the best he could with what he had and it's a well-made movie, albeit one-dimensional and micro-budget.Some might understandably complain that some parts of the story are highly unrealistic. For instance, one of the members of the party leaves the rest at the mini-van to get help. He hikes for at least a couple of miles where he encounters civilization and also the bear, which drags him all the way back to the mini-van! How did the bear drag him back to the vehicle? Did he have his leg in his maw or what? How come the guy showed no signs of serious injury from being dragged in such a manner for a couple of miles through hilly, forested terrain?Because of this, I don't think the film's really about the bear attack; it's only this on the surface. So what's it really about? This is a story about the serious conflict of two brothers and their babes. One appears to be successful and happily married while the other is a struggling rock musician hoping to make it big. Appearances aren't always reality and many truths surface during the engagement with the bear. Will these awful truths further separate them or ultimately bring them together? Will they even survive?FINAL WORD: The thin plot and confined-location of ""Bear"" are a huge detriment, but it has some positive qualities that make it worthwhile, like the emphasis on characterization and the dramatic score. If you have a taste for films like ""Prey,"" Black Water"" and ""Open Water"" then you'll probably appreciate it, although it's the least of these.GRADE: C-",3,Bearly bearable bear movie,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,3585,"['Bear', '2010', 'low-budget', 'nature-runs-amok', 'flick', 'manner', 'Prey', 'Black', 'Water', 'films', 'plot', 'simple', 'location', 'confined', 'plot', 'four', 'people', 'mini-van', 'attacking', 'bear', 'location', 'mini-van', 'surrounding', 'desert-like', 'forest', 'third', 'shortcoming', 'first', 'eight', 'minutes', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'night', 'Thankfully', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'what', 'going', '.On', 'positive', 'side', 'story', 'stress', 'characterization', 'fact', 'film', 'increasingly', 'more', 'soap', 'operatic', 'along', 'top', 'very', 'dramatic', 'score', 'lines', 'say', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'actors', 'give', 'best', 'shot.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Angeles', 'National', 'Forest', 'Acton', 'CA', 'hour', 'drive', 'Topanga', 'State', 'Park', 'Malibu', 'where', 'Sasquatch', 'Hunters', 'was', 'filmed', 'such', 'are', 'similarities', 'films', 'involve', 'group', 'people', 'being', 'attacked', 'large', 'forest', 'creature', 'creatures', 'take', 'place', 'same', 'general', 'vicinity', 'have', 'long', 'stretches', 'night', 'sequences', 'feature', 'very', 'dramatic', 'scores', 'Regardless', 'Sasquatch', 'Hunters', 'better', 'film', 'far', 'plot', 'locations', 'are', ""n't"", 'one-dimensional', 'similar', 'film', 'Night', 'Skies', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'also', 'thin', 'plot', 'same', 'general', 'location', 'Santa', 'Clarita', 'Sasquatch', 'Hunters', 'Night', 'Skies', 'better', 'film', 'simply', 'not', 'as', 'limited', 'scope', 'take', 'instance', 'excellent', 'ending', 'Night', 'Skies', '.At', '82', 'minutes', 'short', 'film', 'Prey', 'Black', 'Water', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'sit', 'just', 'so', 'one-dimensional', 'Fortunately', 'character', 'dramatics', 'score', 'REAL', 'bear', 'tend', 'hold', 'attention', 'just', 'barely.Despite', 'shortcomings', 'have', 'respect', 'director', 'John', 'Rebel', 'many', 'ways', 'respectable', 'film', 'made', 'very', 'small', 'budget', 'real', 'bear', 'worthy', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'had', 'well-made', 'movie', 'one-dimensional', 'micro-budget.Some', 'might', 'understandably', 'complain', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'highly', 'unrealistic', 'instance', 'one', 'members', 'party', 'rest', 'mini-van', 'get', 'help', 'least', 'couple', 'miles', 'where', 'civilization', 'also', 'bear', 'way', 'back', 'mini-van', 'How', 'did', 'bear', 'drag', 'back', 'vehicle', 'Did', 'have', 'leg', 'maw', 'what', 'How', 'come', 'guy', 'showed', 'signs', 'serious', 'injury', 'being', 'dragged', 'such', 'manner', 'couple', 'miles', 'hilly', 'forested', 'terrain', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'really', 'bear', 'attack', 'only', 'surface', 'what', 'really', 'story', 'serious', 'conflict', 'two', 'brothers', 'babes', 'One', 'be', 'successful', 'happily', 'married', 'other', 'struggling', 'rock', 'musician', 'hoping', 'make', 'big', 'Appearances', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'reality', 'many', 'truths', 'surface', 'engagement', 'bear', 'Will', 'awful', 'truths', 'further', 'separate', 'ultimately', 'bring', 'together', 'Will', 'even', 'survive', 'FINAL', 'WORD', 'thin', 'plot', 'confined-location', 'Bear', 'are', 'huge', 'detriment', 'positive', 'qualities', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'emphasis', 'characterization', 'dramatic', 'score', 'have', 'taste', 'films', 'Prey', 'Black', 'Water', 'Open', 'Water', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'appreciate', 'least', 'these.GRADE', 'C-']",N/A
