689389,A294DWRBQUOIK4,B00005Y71J,"Aaron Newlands ""Sithgod""","[1, 1]",I fell in love with Batman with the first movie by Tim Burton. Its dark brooding and gothic feel was very interesting. The music by Danny Elfman gave the movie a special quality. After they left the series it just feel off and everything that was good about it was gone.Then out of nowhere came the Batman animated. A mean nasty looking dark knight in a dark Gotham city. No more neon lights. This was the Gotham city of the first film. Danny Elfman returned to do a version of the Batman theme.The characters are done so well. The artwork and designs are simply incredible and character voices so fit the players that it is hard to think of anyone else playing them.There is more deapth in the animated series than in any of the films. We get to watch Harvey Dents fall from grace. If you like Batman then it is hard to walk by this DVD. It is well worth the money.

They must have never seen 'Batman: The Animated Series.' Bruce Timm's emmy-award winning art design and production, creates a sleek, timeless retro-modern look for Gotham City and it's inhabitants. A century from now, this will still look as classy and modern as it does now. This, matched with an incredible writing team headed by Paul Dini and spot-on voice talent including Mark Hamill as the Joker, secures this as the best animated series ever. Yes, even better than 'The Simpsons.'Warner Bros. has had a poor commitment to TV on DVD. Up until now, everything they've released has been ""Best of"" compilations.

689392,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,B00005Y71J,Bruce Rux,"[6, 6]","The only thing not to love about the animated Batman series is the choppy animation, itself.  Everything else is stellar.  Bruce Timm's artwork deliberately hearkens back to the 1940's Max Fleischer Superman shorts, and the clever stories appeal to the kids but are sophisticated enough to hold the attention of adults.The best thing about the entire series is the ""kinder, gentler"" approach to the caped superhero.  As opposed to Tim Burton's dark just-this-side-of-a-psycho interpretation, the animated Batman develops something of a rapport with his adversaries.  He comes to understand them before even attempting to bring them in, and he tries the easy approach first  -  granted, it generally fails, but at least he tries.  His defeat of Gotham's various criminals is invariably brought about by Batman's psychological understanding of them.The next best thing is the new interpretation of old villains, and the introduction of several Bob Kane originals who never saw screen time anywhere.  In the latter category, the Scarecrow and Poison Ivy are magnificent.  The Scarecrow story on this DVD introduced Scarecrow as Kane did  -  as an inadequate little man who uses his advanced knowledge of chemistry to incapacitate his opponents with fear, making himself feel bigger by comparison.  Beginning as a mere bankrobber, later stories saw him evolve into a more psychotic extortionist.  Poison Ivy, who Kane introduced but rarely used (if I'm not mistaken, he actually only had her in a single story)  -  and who didn't appear often in post-Kane comics, either  -  is given a complete makeover and a credible psychosis of her own.  Her introductory story is one of the best in the animated series, and is present in this collection.  Similarly, ""Manbat,"" a potentially silly figure, is given adult character and motivation in this series, even if he is largely a Dr. Jekyll knockoff.The greatest  -  and most pleasant  -  surprise is Mark Hamill's Joker, which is as perfect a vocal interpretation as anyone could ask for.  The Joker of the animated series is the closest anyone has come to the original Kane version, the best and the most satisfying.  ""Christmas With the Joker"" is an episode made mostly for the kids, though adults will probably enjoy it too  -  it's one of the few that goes really over the top and indulges itself a bit in juvenile comic-strip-ism.  Joker's other story, his introductory piece, is much better, both more frightening and more humorous  -  which is the way the Joker really should be.Don't worry about buying this one, if you don't have kids as an excuse.  Adults will enjoy these great Batman stories probably even more than the kids.  Trust me, if you love Batman, the animated series was the best he ever got, outside of the comic book itself.Indulge yourself!",5,Bigger and Batter Than Ever!,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,2805,"['only', 'thing', 'not', 'love', 'animated', 'Batman', 'series', 'choppy', 'animation', 'Everything', 'else', 'stellar', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'artwork', 'deliberately', 'back', '1940', 'Max', 'Fleischer', 'Superman', 'clever', 'stories', 'appeal', 'kids', 'are', 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'adults.The', 'best', 'thing', 'entire', 'series', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'approach', 'caped', 'superhero', 'opposed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'dark', 'just-this-side-of-a-psycho', 'interpretation', 'animated', 'Batman', 'something', 'rapport', 'adversaries', 'understand', 'even', 'attempting', 'bring', 'easy', 'approach', 'first', 'granted', 'generally', 'least', 'defeat', 'Gotham', 'various', 'criminals', 'invariably', 'brought', 'about', 'Batman', 'psychological', 'understanding', 'them.The', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'new', 'interpretation', 'old', 'villains', 'introduction', 'several', 'Bob', 'Kane', 'originals', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'screen', 'time', 'anywhere', 'latter', 'category', 'Scarecrow', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'are', 'magnificent', 'Scarecrow', 'story', 'DVD', 'introduced', 'Scarecrow', 'Kane', 'did', 'inadequate', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'advanced', 'knowledge', 'chemistry', 'incapacitate', 'opponents', 'fear', 'making', 'feel', 'bigger', 'comparison', 'Beginning', 'mere', 'bankrobber', 'later', 'stories', 'saw', 'evolve', 'more', 'psychotic', 'extortionist', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'who', 'Kane', 'introduced', 'rarely', 'used', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'actually', 'only', 'had', 'single', 'story', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'often', 'post-Kane', 'comics', 'given', 'complete', 'makeover', 'credible', 'psychosis', 'own', 'introductory', 'story', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'series', 'present', 'collection', 'Similarly', 'Manbat', 'potentially', 'silly', 'figure', 'given', 'adult', 'character', 'motivation', 'series', 'even', 'largely', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'knockoff.The', 'greatest', 'most', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Joker', 'perfect', 'vocal', 'interpretation', 'anyone', 'could', 'ask', 'Joker', 'animated', 'series', 'closest', 'anyone', 'come', 'original', 'Kane', 'version', 'best', 'most', 'satisfying', 'Christmas', 'Joker', 'episode', 'made', 'mostly', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'too', 'one', 'few', 'really', 'top', 'bit', 'juvenile', 'comic-strip-ism', 'Joker', 'other', 'story', 'introductory', 'piece', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'frightening', 'more', 'humorous', 'way', 'Joker', 'really', 'should', 'be.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'about', 'buying', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'excuse', 'Adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'great', 'Batman', 'probably', 'even', 'more', 'kids', 'Trust', 'love', 'Batman', 'animated', 'series', 'was', 'best', 'ever', 'got', 'comic', 'book', 'itself.Indulge']",N/A

Surely the network thought that it was a little too dark and decided to show cat and claw like past reviewer said.  Their is a funny scene where a security guard and a nurse go to the back romm to get it on and when they start kissing in comes the man bat to save this from becoming a porno.  I always found little touches like this perfect for a kids-teenagers show.  Little did I realize that I would still love this show hust as much 10 years later.  The man bat is not one of my favorite episoed but would have been a nice premiere.CHRISTMAS WITH THE JOKER- A very dark episode to start out with where the Joker escapes form arkum and kidnaps the commish, his daughter, and bullock just for laughs.  AND SOME VERY GOOD LAUGHS THEY WERE.  The joker episodes were always the strongest, and they were certainly the best at the start of the series when the creators were still getting there feet wet.  So the joker has a great line in this movie where he says if the bat doesn't come and save the commish and company, and then he does like a throat slash.  Maybe he didn't or couldn't say kill but the gesture was even stronger.  So everything wraps up real nicely in this one with some nice batman electrifying torture and a classic joker falls into the lava pit or something and batman saves him at the last second.NOTHING TO FEAR- The origin of the scarecrow is shown in this episode and is done so VERY slick.  They easily could have done a 2-part series buy very nicely made it into a single complete episode.THE LAST LAUGH-this was a very inventive one and has one of my favorite character.""You've killed Captain Clown"".PRETTY POISON-I believe this is the first episode that has harvey dent(later two-face).  It is also the first appearence of Poison Ivy.It's too bad that this disc only has 5 episodes but when these first came out this was the best cause all the rest had  mother effing 4, only 4 episodes on it.  They certainly came out with the new batman series pretty quick, didn't they.Also if you are a real collector of this series, then this is worth 2-5 dollars for you also.  It has essential interviews with bruce timm talking about each episode and his thoughts on them individually.  This was THE only thing that was good about these scrawny little dvd releases.

689403,A3VHUQ85RH0BC3,B00005Y71J,"Raj ""rajivsreviews""","[12, 12]","Batman - The Animated Series is one of the best animation shows that aired during the 90s. This DVD provides the first 5 episodes of the First Season.  I have listed my reviews for the episodes separately, followed by my review of the DVD.Review of the Episodes:1. On Leather Wings: A winged bat-like creature is spotted flying above Gotham, stealing chemicals from various pharmaceuticals (recently from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, where it also injured a night watchman). The Police suspect that it is Batman. To clear his name, Batman goes to the scene of the crime and finds a tape along with a strand of the creature's hair. Having his suspicions, he goes to Dr. March and Dr. Langstrom to ask their opinion on the evidence. However, since the Doctors give him a faulty explanation, Batman is convinced that one of them is the cause for the crimes. Can Batman find out who Man-Bat is and get him in time?A good start to the series, we get to see how Batman clears his name by going after the Man-Bat. (4/5).2. Christmas with the Joker - The Joker has escaped from Gotham Asylum during Christmas time. Meanwhile, Dick convinces Bruce to watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" to let Bruce get into the holiday spirit. However, the Joker makes all the channels broadcast to his show called ""Christmas with the Joker"", where he intends to share his Christmas `joy' with the citizens of Gotham. It is up to Batman and Robin to save the people of Gotham while Joker holds Commissioner Gordon, Detective Bullock, and reporter Summer Gleeson hostage.This is a little different, but still a good episode where we get to see Batman and Robin in action. The highlights of this show are the scenes where Batman and Robin save the people on the train and when they go to the Laffco Toy Factory to defeat Joker. (4/5).3. Nothing to Fear - A new villain called the `Scarecrow' is stealing and vandalizing the University. However, the Scarecrow's intention of robbing the University is not for the money, but for revenge (especially on Dr. Long, the head of the University). It is up to Batman to catch the crook, but will he be able to succeed, knowing that the Scarecrow is making Batman live his darkest fears?This was another great episode where we get to see Batman confront his darkest fears while trying to catch the Scarecrow, who is putting fear on the citizens of Gotham. (5/5).4. The Last Laugh - It's April Fools Day and the Joker is back to spread havoc on Gotham. He spreads a laughing gas through the city, and people who inhale it start laughing until they become insane. Once again, Batman has to stop the Joker, but as usual the Joker has new tricks up his sleeve.I loved this episode because it was purely action-based, and kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. The scenes where Batman is trapped underwater, or where he is trying to defeat ""Captain Clown"" is terrific! (5/5).5. Pretty Poison - An area of exotic wildflowers is being removed to build the Gotham Penitentiary. There is a woman who is against the destruction of these flowers, and wants to make sure that Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent pay for their crime, as it was them who initiated the project.The first episode with Poison Ivy in it, this was a good episode, but was a little slow and predictable. It was nevertheless fun to watch Batman fight a female villain for a change. (3.5/5).Review of the DVD:Since the official Season Boxed Sets of ""Batman - The Animated Series"" is now available, it is rather pointless to buy this DVD when you can buy the complete sets with more extras included in them. However, it you are a fan of the show, you can still purchase this DVD, as it contains wonderful episodes containing The Joker, Poison Ivy, and The Scarecrow, to add to your collection. Otherwise, it is better to buy all the 3 Volumes of Batman which contain all the episodes of the entire series, instead of this.",5,"5 stars for the show, not the DVD.",1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,3882,"['Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'one', 'best', 'animation', 'aired', '90s', 'DVD', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'First', 'Season', 'have', 'listed', 'reviews', 'episodes', 'separately', 'followed', 'review', 'DVD.Review', 'Episodes:1', 'Leather', 'Wings', 'winged', 'bat-like', 'creature', 'spotted', 'flying', 'Gotham', 'stealing', 'chemicals', 'various', 'pharmaceuticals', 'recently', 'Phoenix', 'Pharmaceuticals', 'where', 'also', 'injured', 'night', 'watchman', 'Police', 'suspect', 'Batman', 'clear', 'name', 'Batman', 'scene', 'crime', 'tape', 'strand', 'creature', 'hair', 'Having', 'suspicions', 'Dr.', 'March', 'Dr.', 'Langstrom', 'ask', 'opinion', 'evidence', 'However', 'Doctors', 'give', 'faulty', 'explanation', 'Batman', 'convinced', 'one', 'cause', 'crimes', 'Can', 'Batman', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Man-Bat', 'get', 'time', 'good', 'start', 'series', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Batman', 'name', 'going', 'Man-Bat', '4/5', '.2', 'Christmas', 'Joker', 'Joker', 'escaped', 'Gotham', 'Asylum', 'Christmas', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'Dick', 'Bruce', 'watch', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'let', 'Bruce', 'get', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'However', 'Joker', 'channels', 'broadcast', 'show', 'called', 'Christmas', 'Joker', 'where', 'share', 'Christmas', 'joy', 'citizens', 'Gotham', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'save', 'people', 'Gotham', 'Joker', 'Commissioner', 'Gordon', 'Detective', 'Bullock', 'reporter', 'Summer', 'Gleeson', 'hostage.This', 'little', 'different', 'still', 'good', 'episode', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'action', 'highlights', 'show', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'save', 'people', 'train', 'when', 'go', 'Laffco', 'Toy', 'Factory', 'defeat', 'Joker', '4/5', '.3', 'Nothing', 'Fear', 'new', 'villain', 'called', 'Scarecrow', 'stealing', 'vandalizing', 'University', 'However', 'Scarecrow', 'intention', 'robbing', 'University', 'not', 'money', 'revenge', 'especially', 'Dr.', 'Long', 'head', 'University', 'Batman', 'catch', 'crook', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'succeed', 'knowing', 'Scarecrow', 'making', 'Batman', 'live', 'darkest', 'fears', 'was', 'great', 'episode', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'Batman', 'confront', 'darkest', 'fears', 'trying', 'catch', 'Scarecrow', 'who', 'putting', 'fear', 'citizens', 'Gotham', '5/5', '.4', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'April', 'Fools', 'Day', 'Joker', 'back', 'spread', 'havoc', 'Gotham', 'laughing', 'gas', 'city', 'people', 'who', 'inhale', 'laughing', 'become', 'insane', 'Once', 'again', 'Batman', 'stop', 'Joker', 'usual', 'Joker', 'new', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve.I', 'loved', 'episode', 'was', 'purely', 'action-based', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'scenes', 'where', 'Batman', 'trapped', 'underwater', 'where', 'trying', 'defeat', 'Captain', 'Clown', 'terrific', '5/5', '.5', 'Pretty', 'Poison', 'area', 'exotic', 'wildflowers', 'being', 'removed', 'build', 'Gotham', 'Penitentiary', 'woman', 'who', 'destruction', 'flowers', 'make', 'sure', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Harvey', 'Dent', 'pay', 'crime', 'was', 'who', 'initiated', 'project.The', 'first', 'episode', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'was', 'good', 'episode', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'predictable', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'fun', 'watch', 'Batman', 'fight', 'female', 'villain', 'change', '3.5/5', '.Review', 'DVD', 'official', 'Season', 'Boxed', 'Sets', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'now', 'available', 'rather', 'pointless', 'buy', 'DVD', 'when', 'can', 'buy', 'complete', 'sets', 'more', 'extras', 'included', 'However', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'can', 'still', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'episodes', 'containing', 'Joker', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'Scarecrow', 'add', 'collection', 'Otherwise', 'better', 'buy', '3', 'Volumes', 'Batman', 'contain', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'instead']",N/A
689404,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B00005Y71J,Simon,"[1, 1]","After months of anticipation, I finally bused to my local comic book shop yesterday on my lunch hour and grabbed this DVD along with the other new Batman titles. All I could think about all day was getting home and popping this disc into my DVD player. Batman: The Animated Series was one of the great shows of my early childhood (next to Ninja Turtles and Ghostbusters) and having the first five episodes on disc is amazing. There are noticible differences between these early episodes and the ones that followed: the animation is slightly more detailed and darker, Alfred's voice actor is different, Mark Hamil still hadn't quite nailed his famous Joker voice, and the interaction between Batman and Robin has a tinge of campiness. Yet, this is still the definitive Dark Knight.However, I'm rather sad to say this disc disappointed me. While the episodes are still great, their presentation is completely lacking. There are no chapter stops for individual episodes, like on the Batman Beyond DVD. One would think the perfect place to introduce chapter stops would be where the segements fade to black for the commerical breaks, but there are none. There are no audio commentaries on the disc; Producer Bruce Timm appears at the start of each episode with a brief (less than 2.5 min) bit, but he could have easily done two or three terrific commentary tracks for EACH episode. There are only two extras, and neither of them are any good. There is a ""game"" that basically pieces together segments from the cartoons, and a featurette on how to draw Batman that lasts less than a minute. The two-minute pilot that Timm used to sell the show to Warner Bros. was supposed to be included, but it's nowhere to be found (unless it's an easter egg). Overall, the disc is as bare-bones as the early DVD releases, and WB's poor extras can't hide that fact.Still, this is a no-brainer purchase for fans. The disc is affordable, and the quality of the show guarantees repeated viewings. Hopefully good sales of this disc will pursuade Warner Bros. to load up the next few installments.",4,"Try again, Warner Bros.",1019606400,"04 24, 2002",2002,2073,"['months', 'anticipation', 'finally', 'bused', 'local', 'comic', 'book', 'shop', 'yesterday', 'lunch', 'hour', 'grabbed', 'DVD', 'other', 'new', 'Batman', 'titles', 'could', 'think', 'day', 'was', 'getting', 'home', 'popping', 'disc', 'DVD', 'player', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'shows', 'early', 'childhood', 'next', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'Ghostbusters', 'having', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'disc', 'amazing', 'are', 'noticible', 'differences', 'early', 'episodes', 'ones', 'followed', 'animation', 'slightly', 'more', 'detailed', 'darker', 'Alfred', 'voice', 'actor', 'different', 'Mark', 'Hamil', 'still', 'had', ""n't"", 'quite', 'nailed', 'famous', 'Joker', 'voice', 'interaction', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'tinge', 'campiness', 'still', 'definitive', 'Dark', 'Knight.However', ""'m"", 'rather', 'sad', 'say', 'disc', 'disappointed', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'presentation', 'completely', 'lacking', 'are', 'chapter', 'individual', 'episodes', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'DVD', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'perfect', 'place', 'introduce', 'chapter', 'stops', 'would', 'be', 'where', 'segements', 'fade', 'black', 'commerical', 'breaks', 'are', 'none', 'are', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'disc', 'Producer', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'start', 'episode', 'brief', 'less', '2.5', 'min', 'bit', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'done', 'two', 'three', 'terrific', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'EACH', 'episode', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'game', 'basically', 'together', 'segments', 'cartoons', 'featurette', 'how', 'draw', 'Batman', 'less', 'minute', 'two-minute', 'pilot', 'Timm', 'used', 'sell', 'show', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'included', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'easter', 'egg', 'Overall', 'disc', 'as', 'bare-bones', 'early', 'DVD', 'releases', 'WB', 'poor', 'extras', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact.Still', 'no-brainer', 'purchase', 'fans', 'disc', 'affordable', 'quality', 'show', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Hopefully', 'good', 'sales', 'disc', 'will', 'pursuade', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'load', 'up', 'next', 'few', 'installments']",N/A
