AN OCCURENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE is best-known of the latter. This French-made short film (28 mins.) of that tale was required viewing in high schools back in the 1960s.The story opens with Confederate sympathizer Peyton Farquhar being executed by hanging from the titled river span. He's pushed, falls, the rope snaps and Peyton lands in the water, unharmed. He manages to free his hands, untie his bound feet and safely escape from a barrage of rifle fire.For a day and night Farquhar flees through an endless forest in the general direction of home-- some 30 miles distant. All through this taxing journey he thinks about wife and kids. Peyton begins to imagine strange sights and noises, and is convinced that he dozes even while walking. After coming to full consciousness near his home, Farquhar runs (in stunning slow motion) with arms outstretched toward his wife. He suddenly feels a blinding pain in the back of his neck...The literary device central to ""Owl Creek Bridge"" has been reused in many films.JACOB'S LADDER(1990) andCARNIVAL OF SOULS(1962) are just two of these.Licensee of this indie transfer, VIDEO YESTERYEAR (along with RADIO YESTERYEAR) is a specialty company located in Sandy Hook, CT.

With very little dialogue, this film, while discarding Bierce's explanation of how Peyton Farquhar was captured and sentenced to hang as a spy (and which actually is not necessary, in my opinion), depends on the visual rather than the spoken and succeeds admirably! The film may last less than half an hour, but in that time the viewer is rivetted not only by Roger Jacquet's performance as the condemned man but also by the beautiful scenery, the tight editing and just the right pacing of the action (the music, especially the slow lovely ballad ""A Livin' Man"", sung in the style of the Old Southern spirituals, also sticks with the viewer). The twist ending (which is worthy of the best TWILIGHT ZONE episodes [which, by the way, this film was used for in the fifth and final season of that wonderful series]), made me actually catch my breath, more than when I actually read ths original story.

All three are by the same director, and these form the trilogy from which The Twilight Zone derived a slightly edited version of ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" for American television audiences. Thanks to Warner Home Video, you can now watch the entire trilogy.The good news: the audio is in English (the inner voices of characters are in French, but in Occurrence these are very brief and unobtrusive), the French subtitles are removable. The sound and picture have been digitally restored, the sound quality is very good, the picture quality is excellent, stunning in places. ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" is presented in it's original full length, with the original French title sequence. You have never seen this film look this good.The bad news, you'll need a multiregion player to watch it on, it's a Region 2 PAL disk.

In this piece, the punishment of death by hanging is being carried out in formal, methodical fashion by a group of Union soldiers. The sentenced man dressed in civilian clothes is led to the center of a bridge, placed upon a wooden plank that hangs out over the river, his body thoroughly tied and then a noose is put round his neck. It's early morning and the sun is beginning to rise. The birds are chirping loudly as nature goes about its business. As the final moment approaches the man is becoming visibly agitated and starts to cry. Past thoughts of a wife or lover flash through his mind but the reality of the moment is unrelenting. The order is given, a soldier steps off the plank and down falls the man . . . down into the river? Underwater we can see that the rope has snapped and the man is deep within the river desperately, but successfully removing the noose and the ties that had him bound. Off go the boots and he's swimming for the surface. He's free! At the surface the joy of living hits him with full force. The miracle of a spider web, the song of the birds, the feel of the wind across his face . . . joy!! But the soldiers on the bridge have spotted him and he must swim down the raging river of life to avoid the stillness and empty solitude of death.
