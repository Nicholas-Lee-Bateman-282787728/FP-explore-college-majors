1611909,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B00AIBZMD6,Andres C. Salama,"[8, 15]","The reboot of the Jack Ryan franchise (not based on any particular book, but starring the character invented by the recently deceased Tom Clancy) is utterly disappointing. As the movie starts, we are in 2001 and Jack Ryan (a wooden Chris Pine) is studying economics in the London School of Economics. News of the terrorist attack of 9/11 prompts him to enlist as a marine. Next we see him, he is fighting in Afghanistan, where his helicopter is blown off, surviving miraculously. The CIA becomes aware of both his academic smarts and his courage in the military field, so they bring Kevin Costner to enlist him for the agency in a unit fighting financial terrorism. To do that, he is asked to work undercover in a Wall Street firm. There, he learns, perhaps a few years later, that one Russian oligarch named Victor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh who also directed the film) is involved in some shady dealings, so he has to go to Moscow to investigate. As it turns out (warning: spoilers ahead), Cherevin fought in the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan during the 1980s and is still resentful that at that time the US supported the Afghan Mujahedin, which eventually defeated the Soviets. His plan for payback to the US: buy really huge sums of dollars in the market, and sell them when a terrorist attack hits the US. This would cause, according to Ryan, a collapse of the dollar and &#34;the second great depression&#34;. Russia, however, will be fine, since it has &#34;all the oil&#34; (Ryan has apparently never heard of the shale oil revolution that has enormously boosted US oil production). You don't have to be a Ph.d. in Economics to realize that such scenario is utterly ridiculous: the US economy is six times larger than that of Russia, and the notion that a Russian oligarch has so much money he can corner all the dollars in the world is beyond laughable.Branagh is fine as the villain and shows some flair directing action sequences, but there is only so much he can do with such an execrable script. By the way, this is probably the first Hollywood movie to show the Russians as villains since Rambo III from 1988. Keira Knightley is pretty as Ryan's witless wife. Mikhail Baryshnikov has an uncredited cameo as a sort of Russian bureaucrat in cahoots with Cherevin (for those with memories, during the 1980s he starred in a Cold War drama called White Nights, that was about as awful as this movie).",1,awful movie with some decent performances in it,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,2411,"['reboot', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'franchise', 'not', 'based', 'particular', 'book', 'starring', 'character', 'invented', 'recently', 'deceased', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'utterly', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'are', '2001', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'wooden', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'studying', 'economics', 'London', 'School', 'Economics', 'News', 'terrorist', 'attack', '9/11', 'prompts', 'enlist', 'marine', 'see', 'fighting', 'Afghanistan', 'where', 'helicopter', 'blown', 'off', 'surviving', 'miraculously', 'CIA', 'aware', 'academic', 'smarts', 'courage', 'military', 'field', 'bring', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'enlist', 'agency', 'unit', 'fighting', 'financial', 'terrorism', 'do', 'asked', 'work', 'undercover', 'Wall', 'Street', 'firm', 'perhaps', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'Russian', 'oligarch', 'named', 'Victor', 'Cherevin', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'film', 'involved', 'shady', 'dealings', 'go', 'Moscow', 'investigate', 'out', 'warning', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'Cherevin', 'fought', 'Soviet', 'occupation', 'Afghanistan', '1980s', 'still', 'resentful', 'time', 'US', 'supported', 'Afghan', 'Mujahedin', 'eventually', 'defeated', 'Soviets', 'plan', 'payback', 'US', 'buy', 'really', 'huge', 'sums', 'dollars', 'market', 'sell', 'when', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'US', 'would', 'cause', 'according', 'Ryan', 'collapse', 'dollar', '34', 'second', 'great', 'depression', '34', 'Russia', 'however', 'will', 'be', 'fine', '34', 'oil', '34', 'Ryan', 'apparently', 'never', 'heard', 'shale', 'oil', 'revolution', 'enormously', 'boosted', 'US', 'oil', 'production', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Ph.d.', 'Economics', 'realize', 'such', 'scenario', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'US', 'economy', 'six', 'times', 'larger', 'Russia', 'notion', 'Russian', 'oligarch', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'can', 'corner', 'dollars', 'world', 'laughable.Branagh', 'fine', 'villain', 'flair', 'directing', 'action', 'sequences', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'execrable', 'script', 'way', 'probably', 'first', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'show', 'Russians', 'villains', 'Rambo', 'III', '1988', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'pretty', 'Ryan', 'witless', 'wife', 'Mikhail', 'Baryshnikov', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'sort', 'Russian', 'bureaucrat', 'cahoots', 'Cherevin', 'memories', '1980s', 'starred', 'Cold', 'War', 'drama', 'called', 'White', 'Nights', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'awful', 'movie']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit
1611910,A3J1L5HC0RMCDX,B00AIBZMD6,"Anonymous45 ""michael cifelli""","[1, 2]","I have changed the way I write my reviews now. I just base it on how I was entertained and why.  I am not looking for a masterpiece, or a classic such as a gone with the wind. This movie had me with the actors alone. To start with we have Chris Pine (Star Trek, Unstoppable with Denzel Washington), Keira Knightley who plays Cathy, Jack Ryan's fiance, Kevin Costner (Three Days To Kill), Kenneth Branagh who is the brains behind all the mayhem you will witness in the action thriller, and I also think he is a brilliant actor.  This cast all works fantastic together and you move scene to scene but it is never rushed, but the movie does pick up speed but only as you would expect it to. Nothing is forced, Costner plays Jack Ryan's mentor and it works wonderfully.  Jack Ryan starts off to finish his Phd as an analyst in finance, he sees a scene on the tv which makes him join the service, and this all happens in about two minutes, he gets hurt, then is recruited into the CIA.  This is where the movie starts. They don't waste any time in the beginning getting Jack into his new role. I wont ruin the story, or the ending here.  You have good action scenes, but not these silly five minute, eight minute car chases which kind of drives me nuts.  Good fight scenes, the movie makes you think, and when you think you have it, it switches directions.  There is one part I thought it was cool, it was a James Bond reference, it had to be.  Jack, the main character, has to introduce himself, and he says ""Ryan, Jack Ryan"".  Maybe it will be installments.I would love to see another one of these films but only with the same actors. I read one review where all the person talked about for two lines, which was his whole review, was how ugly the character Cathy was so it made it hard for him to watch. I don't know who he is with, but my god this woman is stunning!!!  I would crawl through a mile of glass just to kiss her hand and introduce myself!!!  lol  So if you want to be entertained, if you like action films, great writing, something different, and certainly A list actors, this is for you.  I would not really compare it to other films. I think if you just watch it for what it is, you will really love this movie. I like the film most of all, because there is talking, there is several plot changes it seems, and it makes you think a little along with all the danger, and gun fights, and fight scenes.  And some humor as well.  You cant go wrong giving it a try. But If you don't like action films, this is not for you. But I loved it because they did not go over the top with explosions just to have them.  It was just a great movie.  I was entertained.

His character, Jack Ryan, should live on long after his passing. Clancy&#8217;s most famous protagonist, Jack Ryan was the subject of 5 movies dating back to 1990&#8217;s &#34;Hunt for Red October&#34;. This release, &#34;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&#34; is a reboot of sorts; similar to what they did with James Bond when Daniel Craig took over the series. It&#8217;s post 9.11 and Ryan is fresh out of college and fresh off of injuries sustained in Afghanistan. He is, in essence, a Jack Ryan for the 21st Century.The movie is effective but slow going at first. We are muddling through a lot of back-story, information and character setup for most of the first part of the film. Fortunately though, Chris Pine; or the new Jack Ryan, is a gifted actor with lots of charisma and he makes the fish out of water story work. Just when you start to wonder when the espionage stuff is going to turn into what you paid the ticket price for, it does.Once the spy world fully engulfs Jack Ryan, the movie becomes edge of the seat exciting with effective and realistic action. That&#8217;s the thing about Tom Clancy material; realism is the game and you won&#8217;t see things like James Bond diving off a cliff to get into a falling plane or John McClane clinging to an F35 like Spiderman. This is real world action and this is the sort of stuff that the &#34;Die Hard&#34; movie creators seem to have forgotten to their own peril.Kevin Costner, Kiera Knightley and Kenneth Branagh all add to the quality of the film. Branagh even did double-duty as director. Knightley was a standout to me though. While Branagh delivered the more excellent acting performance as the Russian terrorist Victor Cherevin, Knightley delivered the heart and soul of the film. It is the relationship between her character, Cathy Muller, and Ryan that delivers the reason to care.Without emotional involvement, movies are pointless and that is what most action movies forget. &#34;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&#34; did not forget this. When Muller tells Ryan that they will go out to eat and split the check tonight; you care and you actually want to see it happen. It is this that makes the action scenes more perilous, vital and important. It is this that makes &#34;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&#34; a worthwhile contribution to Tom Clancy&#8217;s legacy; that and an inherit realism where most action movies go overboard.",4,MAYBE ABOUT A 3.7,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,2474,"['Tom', 'Clancy', 'passed', 'away', 'October', '2013', 'could', 'see', 'final', 'movie', 'release', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'should', 'live', 'long', 'passing', 'Clancy', '8217', 'most', 'famous', 'protagonist', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'was', 'subject', '5', 'movies', 'dating', 'back', '1990', '8217', '34', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', '34', 'release', '34', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Shadow', 'Recruit', '34', 'reboot', 'sorts', 'similar', 'what', 'did', 'James', 'Bond', 'when', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'took', 'over', 'series', '8217', 'post', '9.11', 'Ryan', 'fresh', 'college', 'fresh', 'off', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'Afghanistan', 'essence', 'Jack', 'Ryan', '21st', 'Century.The', 'movie', 'effective', 'slow', 'going', 'first', 'are', 'muddling', 'lot', 'back-story', 'information', 'character', 'setup', 'most', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'new', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'gifted', 'actor', 'lots', 'charisma', 'fish', 'water', 'story', 'work', 'Just', 'when', 'start', 'wonder', 'when', 'espionage', 'stuff', 'going', 'turn', 'what', 'paid', 'ticket', 'price', 'spy', 'world', 'fully', 'engulfs', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'edge', 'seat', 'exciting', 'effective', 'realistic', 'action', '8217', 'thing', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'material', 'realism', 'game', 'won', '8217', 'see', 'things', 'James', 'Bond', 'diving', 'off', 'cliff', 'get', 'falling', 'plane', 'John', 'McClane', 'clinging', 'F35', 'Spiderman', 'real', 'world', 'action', 'sort', 'stuff', '34', 'Die', 'Hard', '34', 'movie', 'creators', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'own', 'peril.Kevin', 'Costner', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'add', 'quality', 'film', 'Branagh', 'even', 'did', 'double-duty', 'director', 'Knightley', 'was', 'standout', 'Branagh', 'delivered', 'more', 'excellent', 'acting', 'performance', 'Russian', 'terrorist', 'Victor', 'Cherevin', 'Knightley', 'delivered', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'relationship', 'character', 'Cathy', 'Muller', 'Ryan', 'reason', 'care.Without', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'movies', 'are', 'pointless', 'what', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'forget', '34', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Shadow', 'Recruit', '34', 'did', 'not', 'forget', 'When', 'Muller', 'Ryan', 'will', 'go', 'out', 'eat', 'split', 'check', 'tonight', 'care', 'actually', 'want', 'see', 'happen', 'action', 'more', 'perilous', 'vital', 'important', '34', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Shadow', 'Recruit', '34', 'worthwhile', 'contribution', 'Tom', 'Clancy', '8217', 'legacy', 'inherit', 'realism', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'go', 'overboard']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit

This film seems more targeted to the action crowd than the audience who wants to see an intricate plot and a compelling storyline. While there are a few good things in this film, such as Branagh as the baddie and an interesting seduction scene between him and Keira Knightley as Jack Ryan's heartthrob, the film never quite pulled me in. At one point, the plot takes a pretty good turn where the baddie seemed to have the upper hand but that was all too brief. Thereafter, I guessed where the film was going.The plot is rather complex but underdeveloped, which is part of the problem with this latest installment in the Jack Ryan Canon. The story begins with Ryan (now played by Chris Pine, the most recent Captain Kirk in the latest Star Trek films) during his salad days as an economics PhD student at a university in London during the 9/11 attacks. After serving his country and being injured for his troubles, he is then recruited by the CIA via Thomas Harper, played by Kevin Costner. Ryan is to pretend he's a typical trader on Wall Street, but in secret he's investigating off-shore investments which might be funding terrorists group. Through an analysis that takes only minutes on-screen, Ryan discovers trillions of dollars in secret accounts which he traces to some kind of business magnate, Viktor Cherevin, played with nice understatement by Kenneth Branagh.Unfortunately, for my taste, we really don't see how Ryan was able to penetrate the accounts so fast. He just flips on his laptop and finds a whole bunch of inaccessible accounts and immediately knows what they are. I really wanted to have a much more developed sequence where he looks for clues and follows leads. After about 5 minutes of screen time, he's flying to Moscow to confront Branaugh. At the same time, he is living with the woman who was helping him in the hospital. However, she doesn't know he's secretly working for the CIA. And then Costner ends up in Moscow to help Ryan, and then lo and behold, the girlfriend ends up there too and the race is on with lots of car chases through Moscow and then in New York.Overall, a modestly entertaining but for some reason not entirely satisfying action film. At no point in the story does the baddie ever get his way or achieve any of his goals, except for one action sequence about 75% of the way into the film that is way too short. And I liked Branaugh as the vain and soft-spoken baddie, the way he should be. At a certain moment, one of the people in his organization scolds him because of his weakness for booze and broads, which was one of my two favorite scenes in the film but like most of &#34;Shadow Recruit&#34;, the good scenes were all too brief. There is also a young baddie of Russian extraction now living in America as a double-agent, but very little about him is developed except a biography which is recapped for about 30 seconds. The script needed about 2-3 more rewrites before it would have been there. Essentially about 80% action and only 20% story development. I wanted more interesting scenes, not just piles and piles of car chases.

The movie opens and he is in Afghanistan? Is this about Jack Ryan Jr? No - a few minutes later my fears are confirmed when we are introduced to Cathy Muller.  (If you have watched any of the Tom Clancy starring Harrison Ford, or read the books, you will know what I mean by all this)Okay - sigh - lets see what they do with this remake... yup, helicopter crash, explaining his fear of flying. But then he fearlessly hops into a helicopter near the end of the movie - what?I am really getting mad at Chris Pine for remaking all of these existing movie series and putting a spin on the characters. He somehow manages to suck the life out of the characters.So in the end I was left with a mediocre action movie that tries to explain the early days of Jack Ryan by time-shifting him forward 20-30 years to the past decade.I really hope someone re-makes the remakes one day and stays more true to the books; I would love to see a complete series some day - covering everything from the Cardinal in the Kremlin/Red Rabbit days up to the Threat Vector/Command Authority finish, with maybe a side track of the John Clark character as well (Rainbow Six et al).",3,"Dang, not another Chris Pine movie...

This inevitable fact is evidenced by the existence of this film, a reboot intended to introduce a new generation to Jack Ryan, the clever CIA analyst often forced to transform into an improbable, world saving action hero who is surely Clancy's most popular character.Ryan, previously played by actors such as Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford in, among other films, The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games (my personal favorite), is portrayed here by Chris Pine, the blonde-haired-and-blue-eyed A-list hopeful, a stud in whom Paramount has invested a great deal.  The film opens on September 11, 2001 with Pine's Ryan as a student at the London School of Economics seeing the destruction on a television and then cuts to him as a soldier in a helicopter in Afghanistan, a patriotic enlistment implied and later briefly detailed.  A midair disaster injures him.  While recovering, he encounters Thomas Harper, a regal CIA veteran played by a well-cast Kevin Costner, an actor who could have played the title role once upon a time.  Recognizing his courage and also his sharp mind for finance, Harper sends Ryan to be the CIA's inside man on Wall Street and later to Moscow to investigate a potential plot to undermine the United States' economy.  This is where much of the action unfolds.The film is directed by Kenneth Branagh.  This is his second gun-for-hire directorial gig at the inception of an intended series (he also, of course, launched Thor).  He also co-stars in this one as the main antagonist, a tattooed post-Soviet magnate who lords over his ultramodern spaces with the macabre intensity of a vampire.  He delivers a fine performance.  There are shades of ham, of course, but also moments of genuine menace:  a vicious stare which lingers a second too long, for instance.  Behind the camera, he brings a definite competency to the table.  There are moments of elegant or interesting photography, and he knows how to use the talented ensemble, including the wonderful Keira Knightley in the non-challenging role of Ryan's frustrated-by-his-secrecy-but-still-devoted girlfriend.  No one is squandered or demeaned.  The first major action sequence, a fistfight which leaves a five-star hotel room largely destroyed, is also a potent adrenaline rush, its physicality clearly influenced by similar scenes in The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum.  In general, though, there is a lethargic quality to this project.  It is unoriginal to the point of being rote, its every idea and gesture lifted from elsewhere.  The plot, particularly the far-fetched incidents which comprise the second and third acts, has a rushed quality and never even flirts with reaching the intended fever pitch of our-way-of-life-is-on-the-line suspense.  It is not an unpleasant sit, but it calls out for viewing on TNT on an uneventful Tuesday afternoon, perhaps after The Peacemaker and before Firewall.  It is hard to imagine, in my opinion, anyone viewing this film and leaving with a burning desire for a second and third adventure with Chris Pine's Ryan, which could be troubling news for the studio.",3,"Competent, but unspectacular reboot",1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,3491,"['Tom', 'Clancy', 'died', 'last', 'fall', 'prolific', 'author', 'beloved', 'brand', 'destined', 'live', 'Novelists', 'will', 'am', 'sure', 'continue', 'write', 'political', 'suspense', 'stories', 'release', 'Clancy', 'name', 'large', 'bold', 'type', 'title', 'same', 'vein', 'films', 'video', 'games', 'drawing', 'vast', 'universe', 'American', 'spies', 'high-tech', 'ideologue', 'archenemies', 'will', 'continue', 'come', 'waves', 'inevitable', 'fact', 'evidenced', 'existence', 'film', 'reboot', 'intended', 'introduce', 'new', 'generation', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'clever', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'often', 'forced', 'transform', 'improbable', 'world', 'saving', 'action', 'hero', 'who', 'surely', 'Clancy', 'most', 'popular', 'character.Ryan', 'previously', 'played', 'actors', 'such', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'other', 'films', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'personal', 'favorite', 'portrayed', 'here', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'blonde-haired-and-blue-eyed', 'A-list', 'hopeful', 'stud', 'whom', 'Paramount', 'invested', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'September', '11', '2001', 'Pine', 'Ryan', 'student', 'London', 'School', 'Economics', 'seeing', 'destruction', 'television', 'then', 'cuts', 'soldier', 'helicopter', 'Afghanistan', 'patriotic', 'enlistment', 'implied', 'later', 'briefly', 'detailed', 'midair', 'disaster', 'recovering', 'Thomas', 'Harper', 'regal', 'CIA', 'veteran', 'played', 'well-cast', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'title', 'role', 'once', 'time', 'Recognizing', 'courage', 'also', 'sharp', 'mind', 'finance', 'Harper', 'Ryan', 'be', 'CIA', 'inside', 'man', 'Wall', 'Street', 'later', 'Moscow', 'investigate', 'potential', 'plot', 'undermine', 'United', 'States', 'economy', 'where', 'much', 'action', 'unfolds.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'second', 'gun-for-hire', 'directorial', 'gig', 'inception', 'intended', 'series', 'also', 'course', 'launched', 'Thor', 'also', 'one', 'main', 'antagonist', 'tattooed', 'post-Soviet', 'magnate', 'who', 'ultramodern', 'spaces', 'macabre', 'intensity', 'vampire', 'fine', 'performance', 'are', 'shades', 'ham', 'course', 'also', 'moments', 'genuine', 'menace', 'vicious', 'stare', 'second', 'too', 'long', 'instance', 'camera', 'definite', 'competency', 'table', 'are', 'moments', 'elegant', 'interesting', 'photography', 'how', 'use', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'including', 'wonderful', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'non-challenging', 'role', 'Ryan', 'frustrated-by-his-secrecy-but-still-devoted', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'squandered', 'demeaned', 'first', 'major', 'action', 'sequence', 'fistfight', 'five-star', 'hotel', 'room', 'largely', 'destroyed', 'also', 'potent', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'physicality', 'clearly', 'influenced', 'similar', 'scenes', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'Ultimatum', 'general', 'though', 'lethargic', 'quality', 'project', 'unoriginal', 'point', 'being', 'rote', 'idea', 'gesture', 'lifted', 'elsewhere', 'plot', 'particularly', 'far-fetched', 'incidents', 'comprise', 'second', 'third', 'acts', 'rushed', 'quality', 'never', 'even', 'reaching', 'intended', 'fever', 'pitch', 'our-way-of-life-is-on-the-line', 'suspense', 'not', 'unpleasant', 'sit', 'out', 'viewing', 'TNT', 'uneventful', 'Tuesday', 'afternoon', 'perhaps', 'Peacemaker', 'Firewall', 'hard', 'imagine', 'opinion', 'anyone', 'viewing', 'film', 'leaving', 'burning', 'desire', 'second', 'third', 'adventure', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Ryan', 'could', 'be', 'troubling', 'news', 'studio']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit

You could complain that some scenes have a question answered only to never question the answer but hey, we don't have all day, we need to move on with the movie.In closing, if your an action movie fan you will probably like this film.

Thurlow,"[0, 0]","Tom Clancy's spy hero Jack Ryan franchise gets a good reboot in &#34;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.&#34; For fans of the Tom Clancy novels and/or the four previous movies featuring three different actors, this really is different. The Cold War is over; Chris Pine plays Jack Ryan as a young doctoral candidate in economics who joins the Marine Corps after 9/11. A couple of well-written field intelligence reports from Afghanistan bring Ryan to the attention of the CIA in the form of agent recruiter and handler Tom Harper (a nicely grizzled Kevin Costner). Rehabbing from an injury suffered in Afghanistan, Ryan also comes to the attention of an attractive doctor (Kiera Knightley as Ryan's fianc&eacute; Cathy).Undercover as a financial analyst on Wall Street, Ryan discovers some shady dealings by a Russian partner firm. He gets permission from his firm and from his agent handler to go to Moscow. After a slow start setting up Ryan's character, the movie dramatically picks up speed, as Ryan walks into an ambush in a Moscow hotel. The action never really lets up afterwards, as the analyst turned field agent races the clock to save his country, his fianc&eacute;, and himself from an insidious Russian plot.If the original storyline has a few weak spots, the non-stop action and a good pulse-pounding musical score make up for it. Kenneth Branagh does double duty as director and as a menancing Russian heavy. On location shooting in Moscow and New York is excellent. The actors all take hold of their roles and go for it.

There is no shortage of espionage based action/thrillers and the Borne films really raised the bar. So these types of films have to be really good to compare. This doesn't make the grade.Here's the scoop. Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) is going through physical rehab from a war wound when a CIA operative (Kevin Costner) recruits him as an economic analyst working for a large firm. He uncovers a plot the Russians are concocting to devalue the American Dollar and plunge the U.S. into a huge depression. He flies to Russia and moves from analyst to operative while trying to hide all this from his girlfriend (Keira Knightley).This was directed by (and also stars) Kenneth Branagh. It's all really done well but it just doesn't offer much new. The plot to be uncovered is pretty clever and the viewer gets a glimpse at some nifty techie stuff but, when all was said and done, I couldn't do more than shrug my shoulders. This must have looked great on paper and were it released a decade ago it probably would have viewed better. But too much of it was cliched. The clever break-in to get the data. The 'to the last second' downloading of said data before the bad guys arrive. The race against time to find out who the Russian operative is, what he's going to do and where he's going to do it. This merely underlines the fact that these types of movies will need to go down some new and different path if they are to remain viable.This is not a bad watch. It's all very slick and professional.

1611972,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00AIBZMD6,FNDNreview,"[1, 3]","The last time we saw Jack Ryan on the big screen, he was tackling terrorists in the 2002 flick, The Sum of All Fears, starring Ben Affleck. Prior to that film, Ryan had been played by two other well-known actors, Alec Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) and Harrison Ford (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger). The majority of these films were well-received, at least as individual tales, but for a character that progresses steadily over several Tom Clancy novels, the films really lacked proper continuity - not to mention the fact that the films didn&#8217;t necessarily always resemble the characters within the books. In any event, it has been nearly 12 years since we last saw Ryan, and the character is long overdue for a revamp, which he receives in the film franchise&#8216;s reboot, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.Directed by Kenneth Branagh (Thor, Mary Shelley&#8217;s Frankenstein), Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit stars Chris Pine as Jack Ryan, a young college student studying abroad that decides to join the Marines after witnessing the events of 9/11 on television. On a mission, he and his unit are shot down while traveling in a helicopter - but they manage to live through the event. However, Ryan is badly hurt with a broken spine and is forced to learn how to walk all over again. His nurse, Cathy (Keira Knightley), peeks his romantic interest and after his recovery they begin dating one another.While still in rehab for his injuries, Ryan is approached by Thomas Harper (Kevin Coster), a member of the CIA that recruits Ryan to become an undercover agent in the financial sector - looking for money that could be connected to terrorists. Unsurprisingly, he take notice of a substantial amount of money being moved around and jumps a plan to Russia to audit the corporation controlling the money - headed by Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). Once face-to-face with Cherevin, it doesn&#8217;t take long for Ryan to realize he&#8217;s stumbled on something huge - only to have matters complicated when his bride-to-be, Cathy, follows him overseas.Prior to his role as Captain James T. Kirk in the J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot, Chris Pine was a completely unknown actor. However, Star Trek was a hit and suddenly Pine&#8217;s career was off and running - landing a handful of roles in films like Unstoppable and This Means War. Now, Pine is cast in another franchise reboot as the American version of James Bond, Jack Ryan - thus thrusting his career ever higher. Not to pass judgment on Pine&#8217;s role as Jack Ryan, but this hardly feels like a monumental role for him (even though it is).The role of Jack Ryan is a huge catch and Chris Pine is very likeable in this role, but he&#8217;s certainly not the best man to play the character - and might just be the low man on the totem poll. That&#8217;s not necessarily a knock on him because let&#8217;s face it, Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin, and Ben Affleck are pretty tough acts to follow. Still, Pine successfully passes the test as a spy and delves right into another role that will define his young career - assuming the film is a success. He has the look, build, and charisma to be one of Hollywood&#8217;s next big action stars, in the event that he wants to keep making roles of this nature.While Pine is average enough in the role of Jack Ryan, the supporting cast is much more of an eyebrow raiser. Keira Knightley, who portrays the generic love interest, takes a role that is very unusual. She&#8217;s typically all about the historical-themed roles, which she&#8217;s excelled at in certain films, particularly Atonement, Anna Karenina, and even the first three films of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. But, in her relatively bland role of Cathy, Knightley seems very out of place and she gives off the impression that she&#8217;s taken on a character that doesn&#8217;t deserve her attention. In all honesty, any up-and-coming actress looking to break out could have benefited more from the part that Knightley, who is unmistakably well-established as one of the finer actresses in film.Next up is Hollywood legend, Kevin Costner. Most of us know Costner for his great films, like Dances with Wolves and Field of Dreams, while we try to forget the bad, like The Postman and Waterworld. As a focused CIA agent in this film, he also leaves quite a bit to be desired - mostly because of his character&#8217;s lack of personality. He comes off as serious, relentless, and by the book. And, he seems so devoted to the cause that you almost can&#8217;t help but wonder if he&#8217;s the real bad guy in the film, just waiting for a time to make the turn - thus leading to a climactic toe-to-toe contest with Chris Pine&#8217;s younger, less skeptical character. However, if you - like me - were hoping for it to go down like that, allow me to squash your hopes right now.  Instead, directorKenneth Branagh stars in the film, playing an extremely forgettable antagonist.Overall, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is about what you&#8217;d expect from a film with that title. The plot is as predictable as other similar films, like Die Hard, Mission Impossible, or the Bourne Identity films. For a spy film, Jack Ryan is entertaining enough to make you forget about the world for its duration, but at the same time, there&#8217;s nothing special to make this stand out above any other Jack Ryan film. I&#8217;m sorry to say Jack Ryan is definitely no James Bond. Most notable though is the new-age threat the world is facing: economical terrorism. If you want to cripple a country, attack that economy - a theme we will no doubt see more and more of as the world moves away from a nuclear threat and more towards something much more realistic. But, don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s hard to imagine filmmakers and movie studios will give up on movie plots that aim to destroy the world fifteen times over.

First, the currency war between Russia and the US hedges in favor of the US.  The rouble is near collapse, the yuan lacks momentum, and US hegemony defeated Russia in Libya, Ukraine, Egypt, Syria, and Iran.In the movie, the Russian foreign policy uses force to gain advantage.  The prize is energy exports to Eastern Europe.  The Russian corporations have positioned themselves in Moscow as both financial entities and energy entities to control Europe purchases of energy.Jack Ryan discovers the Russian corporation is withdrawing large amounts of money from accounts.  The files are deleted.  He has been studying the data and raise alerts that customer may have ill design planned.In the movie, shadow accounts filled with Russian oil money are used to buy over $2 trillion dollars in US bonds. The buying has caused the dollar to gain in strength against the rouble.  The Russian and Chinese are planning to replace the dollar with a new currency.  China allows the Russian corporation to proceed with its plot.  The private corporation gets the approval from the prime minister to proceed in the plot to cause a global currency reset.  The Russians like the idea because they want to become a super power by bankrupting America.  The geopolitical goal is increase influence in Europe by causing US military force to withdraw.  Russia verses the US in the currency war.A waterloo event is planned by a private Russian corporation, to save Russia from US foreign policy.  The planning of Nato missile bases in Europe by geopolitical measures caused a shadow accounting system to go rogue.  The plot begins with a massive trillion dollar sell off the US treasuries from shadow accounts all over the world destroying the dollar causing hyperinflation.  Next, the plot thickens as the terrorist destroy Wall Street causing the financial trading to relocate to London or Los Angels.  The scheme hinges on the fact, this centers do not have the computer system required to complete the trade volumes possible on Wall Street.Russia is a corporation.  The corporation is going broke.  Foreign investment fears emerging market have caused capital flight.  The Russian central bank raises interest rates to keep foreign investors from flight.  Tens of billion of dollar are being spent by the central bank to buy gold and stocks.  Foreign policy causes social unrest and military tensions preventing Russia from acquiring more gold, as inflation rises.  The rising inflation is making Russian more poor.The Russians turn their attention to energy believing that a sell of US treasuries will damage China financially, short term. The Russia know China will allow a trillion dollars in write-offs, to complete their plot.  Russia is confident its energy export agreements in the Black Sea and Khuristan will compensate for the loss with China, long term.  Russia believe it can survive the bond sell off as the world falls into a Great Depression.Jack Ryan completes his Phd and becomes an analyst for the CIA.  He discovers the plot to destroy Wall Street and saves the lives of 100,000 people.  The US oil and gas corporations move into coveted territories by the Russians and produce energy sold in dollars to the Europeans.  Russia experiences a setup while the US prospers.  The villain is executed as a traitor by the prime minister of Russia.",5,"futuristic, futurecast, 2014",1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,3407,"['jack', 'ryanShadow', 'Recruits', 'highlights', 'many', 'insights', 'future', 'First', 'currency', 'war', 'Russia', 'US', 'hedges', 'favor', 'US', 'rouble', 'collapse', 'yuan', 'momentum', 'US', 'hegemony', 'defeated', 'Russia', 'Libya', 'Ukraine', 'Egypt', 'Syria', 'Iran.In', 'movie', 'Russian', 'foreign', 'policy', 'force', 'gain', 'advantage', 'prize', 'energy', 'exports', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Russian', 'corporations', 'have', 'positioned', 'Moscow', 'financial', 'entities', 'energy', 'entities', 'control', 'Europe', 'purchases', 'energy.Jack', 'Ryan', 'Russian', 'corporation', 'withdrawing', 'large', 'amounts', 'money', 'accounts', 'files', 'are', 'deleted', 'been', 'studying', 'data', 'raise', 'alerts', 'customer', 'may', 'have', 'ill', 'design', 'planned.In', 'movie', 'shadow', 'accounts', 'filled', 'Russian', 'oil', 'money', 'are', 'used', 'buy', '2', 'trillion', 'dollars', 'US', 'bonds', 'buying', 'caused', 'dollar', 'gain', 'strength', 'rouble', 'Russian', 'Chinese', 'are', 'planning', 'replace', 'dollar', 'new', 'currency', 'China', 'Russian', 'corporation', 'proceed', 'plot', 'private', 'corporation', 'approval', 'prime', 'minister', 'proceed', 'plot', 'cause', 'global', 'currency', 'reset', 'Russians', 'idea', 'want', 'become', 'super', 'power', 'bankrupting', 'America', 'geopolitical', 'goal', 'increase', 'influence', 'Europe', 'causing', 'US', 'military', 'force', 'withdraw', 'Russia', 'US', 'currency', 'war.A', 'waterloo', 'event', 'planned', 'private', 'Russian', 'corporation', 'save', 'Russia', 'US', 'foreign', 'policy', 'planning', 'Nato', 'missile', 'bases', 'Europe', 'geopolitical', 'measures', 'caused', 'shadow', 'accounting', 'system', 'go', 'rogue', 'plot', 'massive', 'trillion', 'dollar', 'sell', 'US', 'treasuries', 'shadow', 'accounts', 'world', 'destroying', 'dollar', 'causing', 'hyperinflation', 'Next', 'plot', 'terrorist', 'destroy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'causing', 'financial', 'trading', 'relocate', 'London', 'Los', 'Angels', 'scheme', 'fact', 'centers', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'computer', 'system', 'required', 'complete', 'trade', 'volumes', 'possible', 'Wall', 'Street.Russia', 'corporation', 'corporation', 'going', 'broke', 'Foreign', 'investment', 'fears', 'emerging', 'market', 'have', 'caused', 'capital', 'flight', 'Russian', 'central', 'bank', 'interest', 'rates', 'keep', 'foreign', 'investors', 'flight', 'Tens', 'billion', 'dollar', 'are', 'being', 'spent', 'central', 'bank', 'buy', 'gold', 'stocks', 'Foreign', 'policy', 'social', 'unrest', 'military', 'tensions', 'preventing', 'Russia', 'acquiring', 'more', 'gold', 'inflation', 'rising', 'inflation', 'making', 'Russian', 'more', 'poor.The', 'Russians', 'turn', 'attention', 'energy', 'believing', 'sell', 'US', 'treasuries', 'will', 'damage', 'China', 'financially', 'short', 'term', 'Russia', 'know', 'China', 'will', 'allow', 'trillion', 'dollars', 'write-offs', 'complete', 'plot', 'Russia', 'confident', 'energy', 'export', 'agreements', 'Black', 'Sea', 'Khuristan', 'will', 'compensate', 'loss', 'China', 'long', 'term', 'Russia', 'believe', 'can', 'survive', 'bond', 'sell', 'off', 'world', 'Great', 'Depression.Jack', 'Ryan', 'Phd', 'analyst', 'CIA', 'plot', 'destroy', 'Wall', 'Street', 'lives', '100,000', 'people', 'US', 'oil', 'gas', 'corporations', 'move', 'coveted', 'territories', 'Russians', 'produce', 'energy', 'sold', 'dollars', 'Europeans', 'Russia', 'setup', 'US', 'prospers', 'villain', 'executed', 'traitor', 'prime', 'minister', 'Russia']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit

1611979,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00AIBZMD6,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","Tom Clancy's durable creation Jack Ryan rides again in this well written (Adam Cozad and David Koepp) and well directed (Kenneth Branagh) new version - JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT. Previous actors Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck all contributed their own versions of this bright and clever and strong willed intrigue hero, but Chris Pine steps in now and may be the best choice for future incarnations of the character. He is a solid actor, maintains a boyish innocence beneath his bifurcated roles as a near PhD in Economics and as a CIA analyst. His supporting cast is essentially on target and together they make this one of the better Jack Ryan adventures to date. This is Tom Clancy's last film as a writer before his death on October 1, 2013.The film begins when Ryan (Chris Pine) was attending the London School of Economics and 9/11 happened. He enlisted in the USMC and was assigned to Afghanistan. His helicopter was shot down and Ryan saved his comrades but suffered severe spinal injuries that would require intense rehab: in rehab he is guided by 3rd year med student Cathy (Keira Knightley) and there is a definite chemistry. While there, he is noted by a man named Harper (Kevin Costner), who works for the CIA and would like him to finish his studies and get a job on Wall Street so he can find out of any terrorist plot through their finances. A few years later, Ryan finds anomalies in the accounts of a Russian named Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). Jack knows he should go to Russia to investigate his findings and Harper instructs him to tell no one, including his now live-in girlfriend Cathy. Cathy observes situations which make her doubt Jack's fidelity. Jack goes to Russia and Cherevin assigns him a Bodyguard (Nonso Anozie) but upon escorting Jack to his lush hotel room the bodyguard attempts of murder Jack and jack drowns him in the bathtub.  Obvious Cherevin is hiding something so Jack goes to meet him, and he says he will bring his fianc&eacute; along. But Cathy shows up and Jack has to tell her the truth. Harper says Cathy has to go with Jack when she meets Cherevin. Jack doesn't want her to but Cathy says she's going. So the action begins that leads to the climax - a very fast paced, excellent chase and resolution.Other fine actors add to the story  - Colm Feore, Alec Utgoff, Lenn Kudrjawizki, Mikhail Baryshnikov among many others. The urgent musical score is the work of Patrick Doyle and the cinematography is by Haris Zambarloukos. It is interesting to see how people are mentioning subjects like Keira Knightley's teeth and Chris Pine's complexion. Both are unrelated `flaws' in this fine little film.

1612014,A369KP0JV77JYT,B00AIBZMD6,Jon,"[1, 2]","I will try to keep vague so nothing gets spoiled.  I saw this movie in theaters.  I am a huge Tom Clancy fan and enjoyed each of the previous four movies in their own ways (personally preferring the two Harrison Ford ones the best).I was a bit wary going into this because I am not a big fan of Chris Pine - with respect to him, he has seemed kind of one-note in the past movies I have seen him in.  Overall I think he was quite a decent Jack Ryan in this reboot, better than Affleck was - he played the character Clancy created quite well.**Begin brief editorializing**That said, with the movie itself, I was disappointed Jack Ryan had these hand-to-hand combat skills immediately, randomly - in the past novels and movies Ryan really is not that much of an actual fighter - you get to see my personal favorite Clancy character, John Clark, doing that stuff more.  The Jack Ryan character has never been particularly a fast-paced beat-em-up Jason Bourne, Ethan Hunt or certainly not James Bond-style action character, and that is part of what has made him great and special in the past.  If I want action like that from the lead character, I will watch those movies.While Jack Ryan has certainly been in many a firefight and killed many terrorists in the past, he also has been more of a leader through his courage, honor & morals and brilliant analytic, diplomatic, and sociological skills.  So it is a bit disappointing to me they took Ryan's character in the generic, fast-moving camera action direction more.People can say, ""who cares, it's a reboot!"" but keeping the core character of Jack Ryan AS who Jack Ryan has always been (not some random generic action character), is what will keep this reboot attempt from becoming generic and imitations of other series and characters.  Again, if I want to see Jason Bourne I will watch the Bourne movies.**End editorializing**As I said, I did like Pine in this role, though I would've liked to have seen Jack Ryan in a more cerebral/analyst manner for longer, as others have mentioned on here, and for reasons stated above.  I did like Kevin Costner's role.  His role as the handler/mentor type was very cool.  And I liked Branagh's role generally.  The Russians basically being the enemy was kind of cool.  It was perhaps the most ""Clancyesque"" aspect of the movie.  It may be more realistic to have terrorists, or secret attack groups from North Korea or China as the enemy, but this was kind of interesting, particularly as The Bear is seemingly starting to begin to awake from its slumber again with Putin.What I think I liked most about this movie personally, was that with so many movies these days trying to be too clever you were almost waiting for someone like Costner's character to be ""The Mole"" who betrays everyone, but that did not happen in this movie.  You did not have the ""conspiracy"" aspect that is SO ubiquitous in political action thriller movies these days to the point of being let down when the big reveal of the traitor is done.  The whole movie leads up to that so often these days, that the plot becomes more about the mole than about the hero or the straightforward threat, often times.  And you did not have the ""evil-secret-unit-within-the-government"" coming after our hero that is also ubiquitous to the point of being eye-rolling at how predictable it is.  So, these days when a movie does NOT contain some ""shock value"" or crazy twist or scene, it is actually nice!  This movie does contain elements that have been used before, but it does so in a refreshingly straightforward way.  I liked that a lot.There were some somewhat irritating/silly plot parts, like Knightley's character randomly showing up in Russia and then, well, everything she does from that point forward; the ""tricky"" dinner scene with Branagh's character (really? he has no idea something is off?); and the aforementioned Chris Pine being Bourne-esque or Ethan Hunt-esque at times.  But I do feel like the rest of the plot and different aspects were pretty decent and exciting.Bottom-line: Preordering at $12.99 plus tax currently is a GREAT deal for this movie, considering a lot of other newer movies are debuting at over $20 (which I feel is too much for a movie to debut, particularly if you've already rented it or seen it in theaters - on a random side note, a cool technology for the future would be if you could create a studio account, and it would register if you rented at home or stores, or watched a movie in theaters then subtract that amount from if you wanted to buy that movie at a later date).  In fact I bought 3 copies at that price, since both of my parents love Tom Clancy and the movies as well, and I wanted a copy to go with the previous 4-movie collection I also ordered.  I do think anything over $15 would be getting to be too much though.  If I could, I would give this movie 3.5 stars, but I did leave the theater overall happy with the film.  It was a decent, straightforward, entertaining spy flick.To end with a little more editorializing, I am glad this movie series was rebooted, but I hope they stay away from trying to turn it into another Bourne series.  And they had PLENTY of REALLY good, original material in just about all of Clancy's books they could continue to pull from like with the first four movies, so I am a little disappointed they are doing the ""based on"" and not direct adaptations.There were rumors of a Without Remorse movie being in the works, so I hope they pursue that.  A Rainbow Six movie would be awesome too!",4,"Decent, straightforward spy flick",1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,5524,"['will', 'try', 'keep', 'vague', 'nothing', 'spoiled', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters',

I once had this pre ordered, but decided to cancel.  After seeing it, I am so glad that I did not buy it.The movie is about a terror plot and how a man must stop it.  The man is in the military.  He gets hurt and goes to rehab.  Gets asked to work for the C.I.A. watching for terrorist accounts at banks.  That is it.  At red box, it said something like gripping, exciting, suspenseful.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.This movie has nothing going on, while at the same time having to many things happening.  They have so many things happening, that they never get to spend enough time on any one thing.  You see bits and pieces of things.  You left wondering when the movie will start.None of the characters connect at all.  It is like they are meeting for the first time.  No chemistry what so ever.I was thinking.  Could any of this happen?  What are the chances that a terrorist could set up an attack, then, when the stock market crashed, buy all the stock to own the companies?  Seems so ridiculous.  Could the government not, once they found out what happened, just take the stock back?  It seems, to have enough stock to actually own the company, almost everyone would have to sell their stock.  Say a company has a million people that own stock.  Well, there are a few key people or groups that own a majority.  Is that correct?  That would mean that on top of the public selling their shares, those who actually had the majority would have to sell.  It just continued to get more and more ridiculous.  Now, I know nothing about stocks.  It just seems logical to me.Then, they pick one man, one man to monitor and stop all of these attacks.  Seems almost like a cartoon.  Would they not have an entire team working on stopping this?  Once they found out, could they not somehow stop it?The guy's girlfriend is an annoying addition to the movie.  She looks very thin and unhealthy.  She wines and cry's the entire movie.  One scene she asks ""are you cheating on me.""  The man replies ""no, is that what you think?  I work for the C.I.A."" She replies ""oh, is that all?""  She cries and they hug.  I mean, if that does not tell you all you need to know, I do not know what will.  Then, his girlfriend is there with him, in this secrete place with the C.I.A.  Like that would ever happen.  If that is not bad enough, later on she just leaves to go help people.  She is a doctor.  I mean, they would not let her walk out of that place until they took time to talk to her.  But, she just leaves.In the first 15 or 20 minutes, the man joins the military, gets injured, wakes up in a hospital, goes to rehab and recovers.  I was like, what in the hell just happened?  Did we miss like an hour?  Just tries to go to fast.  Then when they talk.  My god, they just babble on and on and on.  I actually started to fall asleep.After a while when the man was going around trying to stop the people, I started to enjoy it, mostly because there was finally something happening.  But, they it cluttered itself with a bunch or boring, pointless chat and bad acting.  My god, it was awful.  After a bit, it actually became a comedy to me.  I was just waiting to see how stupid it could get.  So, if you want to laugh, rent it.  But, I would never recommend this to any other person.  This is a movie that I can never see any point in watching again.

Ryan (Christopher Pine) is a hands-on CIA Agent and analyst who gets right in the line of fire.  He is super energy and super smart in figuring out everything that's going on with the bad guys and is always physically involved.This flick is the beginning of Jack Ryan, briefly taking you from his college days, to his Marine Corps tour of duty, to his meeting with Kevin Costner, to his recruitement into the CIA.  After going back to college to complete his PhD, he begins covert work as a financial analyst on Wall Street, while searching the financial sector for money filtering ties to terrorist networks,As luck would have it, and working closely with Costner, Ryan sniffs out something going on with the Russian accounts and maneuvers his Wall Street boss to send him to Moscow to perform an audit.  (Remember, no one knows Ryan is a CIA agent except Costner.)  So. . .Moscow is where the action begins and where the majority of the movie takes place.Wonderful non-stop action, as Ryan discovers HE is the one who has to do this stuff, and is no longer afforded the luxury of sitting behind a desk.  From his first kill, to quickly becoming a seasoned agent, Pine does a wonderful job in this high-action movie.Great entertainment on the big screen and a DVD-Keeper when it becomes available for purchase!",5,Where the Jack Ryan Began,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,1416,"['case', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'previously', 'played', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'series', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'Ryan', 'Christopher', 'Pine', 'hands-on', 'CIA', 'Agent', 'analyst', 'who', 'right', 'line', 'fire', 'super', 'energy', 'super', 'smart', 'figuring', 'out', 'everything', 'going', 'bad', 'guys', 'always', 'physically', 'involved.This', 'flick', 'beginning', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'briefly', 'taking', 'college', 'days', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'tour', 'duty', 'meeting', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'recruitement', 'CIA', 'going', 'back', 'college', 'complete', 'PhD', 'covert', 'work', 'financial', 'analyst', 'Wall', 'Street', 'searching', 'financial', 'sector', 'money', 'filtering', 'ties', 'terrorist', 'networks', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'working', 'closely', 'Costner', 'Ryan', 'out', 'something', 'going', 'Russian', 'accounts', 'maneuvers', 'Wall', 'Street', 'send', 'Moscow', 'perform', 'audit', 'Remember', 'one', 'Ryan', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Costner', 'So', '.Moscow', 'where', 'action', 'where', 'majority', 'movie', 'place.Wonderful', 'non-stop', 'action', 'Ryan', 'discovers', 'HE', 'one', 'who', 'do', 'stuff', 'longer', 'afforded', 'luxury', 'sitting', 'desk', 'first', 'kill', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'seasoned', 'agent', 'Pine', 'wonderful', 'job', 'high-action', 'movie.Great', 'entertainment', 'big', 'screen', 'DVD-Keeper', 'when', 'available', 'purchase']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit

1612046,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00AIBZMD6,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","You can't be a fan of movies or the modern thriller novel without knowing who Tom Clancy is. While working as an insurance salesman he wrote novels in his spare time, eventually creating a genre all to himself, the technological thriller. The best known character among those created by Clancy was Jack Ryan, a hero for our time.Ryan has been played by several great actors over the years starting with Alec Baldwin in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. Harrison Ford took over the role in both PATRIOT GAMES and A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. The last person to play Ryan was Ben Affleck in SUM OF ALL FEARS after which Ryan disappeared for a while. That's all changed with Chris Pine taking on the part in JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT.Rather than carry on with an incredibly younger Ryan the producers decided to take us back to how Ryan came to be where he was at in the earlier films, a prequel. We open with Ryan attending college only to hear of the bombings of the twin towers which results in his joining the Marines. When his helicopter is shot down in Afghanistan Ryan is taken off the battlefield. The heroic rescue of his fellow Marines from that crash as well as a dissertation he was writing prior to leaving college catches the eye of Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) who recruits Jack into the CIA.Working as an analyst with little to know training as a field agent, Jack is placed undercover in a banking institute with the intent of finding hidden assets that terrorists might be using. In so doing he discovers a discrepancy in a joint investment with a Soviet group led by Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). The only way to find out if this is a problem or not is for him to go to Russia and investigate there. Needless to say this is not the safest venture for an analyst.At the same time Ryan is trying to carry on his romance with Cathy Muller (Keira Knightly), the nurse from his time in rehab and now a doctor. While he wants to marry her, she holds off. His mysterious ways have her wondering if he's hiding something from her but working for the CIA is not at the top of her list. With the promise of meeting her in Paris in a few days, Ryan sets out for Russia.His arrival results in an attack by his escort that leaves the assassin dead in Ryan's hotel room. Calling for help, he meets up with Thomas in a park and goes from analyst to field op. The arrival of Cathy back at his hotel results in her discovering his secret. After a few twists and turns she then becomes involved in the operation against Cherevin. As the story unfolds the plot turns out to be a plan to collapse the American dollar and send the U.S. into a new depression surpassing any that have occurred before. Now it's up to Ryan to end the plot.The updating of the character works well here, setting up a possible series of films for Pine in the lead that would be worth carrying on. The movie moves along at break neck speed and yet offers a fantastic combination of story and action that most films fail to achieve. They usually go for one or the other. Here, they meld well in an action hero that uses his brain as well as his fists.The acting is above what we usually expect in a spy film. Costner does a great job as Jack's mentor. Branagh (who also directed) is a slimy villain with a certain amount of charm. Knightly does a great job as Ryan's love interest who finds herself in the midst of things and stands by her man. Pine shows his acting chops here offering a performance that shows he's not a one note character by the name of Captain Kirk. No where does a sense of that character blend into this one.As I said the film offers plenty of action and a plot that you have to pay attention to in order to understand. It's a treat to see a movie that actually doesn't dumb down for an audience. With any luck this movie will not be the only time we see Pine as Ryan and many more movies will follow. With the amount of books Clancy wrote there is plenty of source material to work from, even if this film bypassed those. In the end this movie is not just one to watch but one you'll come back to now and again. That makes it one worth adding to the collection.

1612047,A2MHDZXWWF0VIN,B00AIBZMD6,Matthew Kresal,"[0, 0]","More than a decade after The Sum Of All Fears marked the apparent stillbirth of a new film series based on the novels of Tom Clancy, another attempt has been made to breathe life into the series. The result is Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit which, in something of a departure from previous films, isn't  based on any one of the Clancy novels at all. So how does this latest film stand up and is it any more successful as a reboot than its predecessor a decade ago was?Certainly this film has done a better job of casting its lead character. Chris Pine's Jack Ryan is everything that the Ben Affleck version tried to be but failed: the young analyst used to sitting behind a desk who finds himself caught up in extraordinary events. Pine does a fine job of portraying that, be it behind the desk as a Wall Street stockbroker or in some of the film's action sequences. Not only is he believable in those roles, he also makes the transition between the two believable as well during scenes in the middle of the film. As a result, not only is Pine fine in the role but also helps to sell the reality of the events in the film.There's also a good supporting cast as well. Kevin Costner (who incidentally was the original choice to play Jack Ryan more than twenty years ago) is well cast in the role of Ryan's CIA mentor Thomas Harper, bringing with him the presence of a man passing the torch to a new generation while not yet coming in from the cold. Keira Knightley gives a good performance as Cathy with a good American accent and while her and Pine have good chemistry, the character is undermined somewhat by some inconsistent characterization by the scriptwriters. The real star of the supporting cast though, and perhaps not surprisingly, is Kenneth Branagh as the Russian businessman Viktor Cherevin. Branagh takes a potentially cliched role and brings not just a presence to it but a sense of intelligence and menace right from Cherevin's first appearance. The results, when combined with appearances in small roles by actors like David Paymer and Colm Feore, are strong all around.The film's production values are quite strong as well. Though better known for his Shakespeare adaptations such as Henry V and Hamlet, Branagh proves himself more than capable of directing a fast paced and stylish thriller with his handling not only of character moments and dialogue sequences but the film's varied action sequences (the latter seeing him backed up by veteran second unit director Vic Armstrong). The film, largely shot in the UK, does a good job of capturing the feel of its Russian locations thanks to the talents of production designer, Andrew Laws, the cinematography of Haris Zambarloukos and the costumes of Jill Taylor. Frequent Branagh collaborator Patrick Doyle once again provides the film's score and the result is one of the better action film scores of recent memory.So how much resemblance does the film bare to any of the Clancy novels? Perhaps more than one would expect. It does a fine job of taking Clancy's background for Jack Ryan and updating it for the present day (given that Clancy made Jack Ryan Jr the focus of the novels published during the last decade of his life, it's easy to imagine Pine playing Ryan Jr to Costner playing Jack Ryan Senior). The film's plot and the threat against the US, while not being adapted from a Clancy novel, brings to mind moments and elements from more than a few of Clancy's novels. That said, the way the film unfolds is far more in keeping with more straightforward thrillers than the way Clancy's novels tended to but given the difficulties in trying to do that on film (as seen with the attempt made to make the nearly thousand page Sum Of All Fears into a two hour film) that might not be a bad thing. Overall then, the film more than adequately makes use of at least part of its original source material while also forging ahead with something new.In the final analysis, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit does what it sets out to do. It presents an entertaining and stylish action/thriller that reboots a dead franchise while also not ignoring the basics of its original source material. What more can one really ask of it than that?",4,Welcome Back Jack,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,4189,"['More', 'decade', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'marked', 'apparent', 'stillbirth', 'new', 'film', 'series', 'based', 'novels', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'attempt', 'been', 'made', 'breathe', 'life', 'series', 'result', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Shadow', 'Recruit', 'something', 'departure', 'previous', 'films', ""n't"", 'based', 'one', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'how', 'latest', 'film', 'stand', 'up', 'more', 'successful', 'reboot', 'predecessor', 'decade', 'ago', 'was', 'Certainly', 'film', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'casting', 'lead', 'character', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'everything', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'version', 'tried', 'be', 'failed', 'young', 'analyst', 'used', 'sitting', 'desk', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'extraordinary', 'events', 'Pine', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'be', 'desk', 'Wall', 'Street', 'stockbroker', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'Not', 'only', 'believable', 'roles', 'also', 'transition', 'two', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'middle', 'film', 'result', 'not', 'only', 'Pine', 'fine', 'role', 'also', 'sell', 'reality', 'events', 'film.There', 'also', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'well', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'who', 'incidentally', 'was', 'original', 'choice', 'play', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'well', 'cast', 'role', 'Ryan', 'CIA', 'mentor', 'Thomas', 'Harper', 'bringing', 'presence', 'man', 'passing', 'torch', 'new', 'generation', 'not', 'yet', 'coming', 'cold', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'good', 'performance', 'Cathy', 'good', 'American', 'accent', 'Pine', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'character', 'undermined', 'somewhat', 'inconsistent', 'characterization', 'scriptwriters', 'real', 'star', 'supporting', 'cast', 'perhaps', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Russian', 'businessman', 'Viktor', 'Cherevin', 'Branagh', 'potentially', 'cliched', 'role', 'not', 'just', 'presence', 'sense', 'intelligence', 'menace', 'right', 'Cherevin', 'first', 'appearance', 'results', 'when', 'combined', 'appearances', 'small', 'roles', 'actors', 'David', 'Paymer', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'are', 'strong', 'around.The', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'quite', 'strong', 'as', 'well', 'better', 'known', 'Shakespeare', 'adaptations', 'such', 'Henry', 'V', 'Hamlet', 'Branagh', 'more', 'capable', 'directing', 'fast', 'paced', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'handling', 'not', 'only', 'character', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'sequences', 'film', 'varied', 'action', 'sequences', 'latter', 'seeing', 'backed', 'up', 'veteran', 'second', 'unit', 'director', 'Vic', 'Armstrong', 'film', 'largely', 'shot', 'UK', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'feel', 'Russian', 'locations', 'thanks', 'talents', 'production', 'designer', 'Andrew', 'Laws', 'cinematography', 'Haris', 'Zambarloukos', 'costumes', 'Jill', 'Taylor', 'Frequent', 'Branagh', 'collaborator', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'once', 'again', 'film', 'score', 'result', 'one', 'better', 'action', 'film', 'scores', 'recent', 'memory.So', 'how', 'much', 'resemblance', 'film', 'bare', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'fine', 'job', 'taking', 'Clancy', 'background', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'updating', 'present', 'day', 'given', 'Clancy', 'made', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Jr', 'focus', 'novels', 'published', 'last', 'decade', 'life', 'easy', 'imagine', 'Pine', 'playing', 'Ryan', 'Jr', 'Costner', 'playing', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Senior', 'film', 'plot', 'threat', 'US', 'not', 'being', 'adapted', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'mind', 'moments', 'elements', 'more', 'few', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'said', 'way', 'film', 'unfolds', 'far', 'more', 'keeping', 'more', 'straightforward', 'thrillers', 'way', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'tended', 'given', 'difficulties', 'trying', 'do', 'film', 'seen', 'attempt', 'made', 'make', 'nearly', 'thousand', 'page', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'Overall', 'then', 'film', 'more', 'adequately', 'use', 'least', 'part', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'also', 'forging', 'ahead', 'something', 'final', 'analysis', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Shadow', 'Recruit', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'entertaining', 'stylish', 'action/thriller', 'dead', 'franchise', 'also', 'not', 'ignoring', 'basics', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'one', 'really', 'ask']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit
1612048,A18XKEUEXECLRI,B00AIBZMD6,"mcerner ""mcerner""","[0, 0]","For me The Hunt For Red October is still the best of the Jack Ryan films.  It is the original entry and it captured the intent of Clancy's books -- that this is both an intellectual thriller and a brawny action story.  The Ford films seemed to lack that good balance, and were too involved in the private soap opera type story rather than focusing on the action.  I tend to believe that Hollywood thinks it will bring in the female audience if there is a lot about romance or kiddies -- but I'll admit to a preference for action films that focus on just that, the action.  So for me though this was a good film -- intellectual build up to action in the last half hour -- the interruption of the relationship between Ryan and his girlfriend was a detriment.  Kiera Knightly was a miscast, and she was awkward through the whole film.  She also was not believable as a doctor.  Pine did a good job with the character tho seemed too intense at times, like he was trying to squeeze more acting out of himself when maybe low key is better.  Costner was smooth as the mentor plus gave a very competent performance.  I thought Branagh was superb as a calm, driven and charming adversary.  The plot to ruin the US was a little silly tho since it sometimes seems like we Americans are doing that fine on our own.  I am looking forward to a sequel but hope that a different actress is cast as the GF or better yet if Jack's private life is left out in favor of intrigue and action.  All in all, considering the actor performances and the somewhat weak script Branagh did his usual excellent job of directing.",4,Tries too hard but still a very good film,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,1597,"['Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'still', 'best', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'films', 'original', 'entry', 'captured', 'intent', 'Clancy', 'books', 'intellectual', 'thriller', 'brawny', 'action', 'story', 'Ford', 'films', 'seemed', 'lack', 'good', 'balance', 'were', 'too', 'involved', 'private', 'soap', 'opera', 'type', 'story', 'rather', 'focusing', 'action', 'tend', 'believe', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'bring', 'female', 'audience', 'lot', 'romance', 'kiddies', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'preference', 'action', 'films', 'focus', 'just', 'action', 'So', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'intellectual', 'build', 'up', 'action', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'interruption', 'relationship', 'Ryan', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'detriment', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'was', 'miscast', 'was', 'awkward', 'whole', 'film', 'also', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'doctor', 'Pine', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'character', 'tho', 'seemed', 'too', 'intense', 'times', 'was', 'trying', 'squeeze', 'more', 'acting', 'when', 'maybe', 'low', 'key', 'better', 'Costner', 'was', 'smooth', 'mentor', 'gave', 'very', 'competent', 'performance', 'thought', 'Branagh', 'was', 'superb', 'calm', 'driven', 'charming', 'adversary', 'plot', 'ruin', 'US', 'was', 'little', 'silly', 'tho', 'sometimes', 'Americans', 'are', 'doing', 'fine', 'own', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'sequel', 'hope', 'different', 'actress', 'cast', 'GF', 'better', 'yet', 'Jack', 'private', 'life', 'left', 'out', 'favor', 'intrigue', 'action', 'considering', 'actor', 'performances', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'script', 'Branagh', 'did', 'usual', 'excellent', 'job', 'directing']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit

There may be spoilers.For many of us who attempt to catch all the end-of-year Oscar candidates, January and February become a time to cleanse the palate so to speak.  The more serious films about slavery, AIDS and dysfunctional families are certainly noteworthy and important, but sometimes you just want to sit back and let the film come to you.  Fortunately we get this film which, much like Tom Clancy's novels on which the character Jack Ryan is based, is fun, thoughtful and action packed.There have been 4 previous films based on Ryan and have been played by 3 different actors.  Chris Pine is the new Jack Ryan, but this film isn't a sequel or a prequel, but a reboot much like Batman, The Dark Knight.  This film isn't based on a previous Clancy novel either but on his characters and style.Ryan is a young Marine officer who joined after 9-11.  After being wounded in Afghanistan, his military career is over.  But his computer skills, background in economics and attention to detail makes him a target for CIA operative Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner).  Ryan is implanted in an American international bank and discovers some shenanigans in the Moscow branch.  He is sent there to conduct an audit and meets the local manager and Russian loyalist Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branaugh, who also directed).Cherevin, working with one of the national ministers has plans to ruin the U. S. economy by devaluing the dollar to the extent it would no longer be the world's currency.  At the same time this market hijacking is to occur, there is a planned terrorist attack in America.  Branagh is no stranger to action based movies (""Thor"") and does a good job maintaining a tension based second and third act.  I was also impressed with the visuals of Moscow.  Everything from the modern exclusive hotels to the city skyline.Keira Knightley brightens things up as Ryan's wife Cathy who shows up in Moscow as a surprise but causes some additional angst as things progress.  There is a nice scene between Knightley and Branagh at dinner as Cathy flirts with Cherevin in order to buy time for Jack to get information inside the bank.  Chris Pine is very good as the somewhat nave Ryan, a geek with great survival skills.Is the film plausible?  Well, things happen pretty fast.  Breaking codes and security seems to be pretty easy and huge files seemed to download at warp speed.  With Edward Snowden prominent in the news these days and now potentially linked to Russian spying, even the premise may not be so far-fetched.  As it is, this new ""Ryan"" film is good enough for January and has the promise of more to come.",4,3 1/2 stars for a fine Jack Ryan reboot,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,2631,"['Theatrical', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'spoilers.For', 'many', 'who', 'attempt', 'catch', 'end-of-year', 'Oscar', 'candidates', 'January', 'February', 'become', 'time', 'cleanse', 'palate', 'so', 'speak', 'more', 'serious', 'films', 'slavery', 'AIDS', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'are', 'certainly', 'noteworthy', 'important', 'sometimes', 'just', 'want', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'film', 'come', 'Fortunately', 'get', 'film', 'much', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'based', 'fun', 'thoughtful', 'action', 'packed.There', 'have', 'been', '4', 'previous', 'films', 'based', 'Ryan', 'have', 'been', 'played', '3', 'different', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'new', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'film', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'prequel', 'reboot', 'much', 'Batman', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'film', ""n't"", 'based', 'previous', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'either', 'characters', 'style.Ryan', 'young', 'Marine', 'officer', 'who', 'joined', '9-11', 'being', 'wounded', 'Afghanistan', 'military', 'career', 'computer', 'skills', 'background', 'economics', 'attention', 'detail', 'target', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Thomas', 'Harper', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Ryan', 'implanted', 'American', 'international', 'bank', 'shenanigans', 'Moscow', 'branch', 'sent', 'there', 'conduct', 'audit', 'local', 'manager', 'Russian', 'loyalist', 'Viktor', 'Cherevin', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'who', 'also', 'directed', '.Cherevin', 'working', 'one', 'national', 'ministers', 'plans', 'ruin', 'U.', 'S.', 'economy', 'devaluing', 'dollar', 'extent', 'would', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'world', 'currency', 'same', 'time', 'market', 'hijacking', 'occur', 'planned', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'America', 'Branagh', 'stranger', 'action', 'based', 'movies', 'Thor', 'good', 'job', 'maintaining', 'tension', 'based', 'second', 'third', 'act', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'visuals', 'Moscow', 'Everything', 'modern', 'exclusive', 'hotels', 'city', 'skyline.Keira', 'Knightley', 'brightens', 'things', 'up', 'Ryan', 'wife', 'Cathy', 'who', 'up', 'Moscow', 'surprise', 'additional', 'angst', 'things', 'progress', 'nice', 'scene', 'Knightley', 'Branagh', 'dinner', 'Cathy', 'Cherevin', 'order', 'buy', 'time', 'Jack', 'get', 'information', 'bank', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'very', 'good', 'somewhat', 'nave', 'Ryan', 'geek', 'great', 'survival', 'skills.Is', 'film', 'plausible', 'Well', 'things', 'happen', 'pretty', 'fast', 'Breaking', 'codes', 'security', 'be', 'pretty', 'easy', 'huge', 'files', 'seemed', 'download', 'warp', 'speed', 'Edward', 'Snowden', 'prominent', 'news', 'days', 'now', 'potentially', 'linked', 'Russian', 'spying', 'even', 'premise', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'far-fetched', 'new', 'Ryan', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'January', 'promise', 'more', 'come']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit

I did not like the way that Cathy was pulled in to the action. Cathy has been involved in the action before, but always she has been kept away from what Jack does at the CIA. This film put her right in the middle of it.As much as I like James Earl Jones, and his portrayal of Admiral Greer, I am glad that they did not bring him or the character in to this film. Unfortunately Mr. Jones now is enough older than he was when portraying the admiral, that it would have looked strange on the screen. Kevin Costner did an excellent job in this film. He captured the same essence In Commander Harper that was brought to Admiral Greer. He was both a father figure, and a hard ass at the same time.This brings me to the cast. This is the second time that Chris Pine has taken the mantle of an iconic role played by another actor. He must be a glutton for punishment. I think that he did a fine job in the role of Jack Ryan. He was believable, he did a good job of portraying the emotional side of the character. The resolve and desperation he conveyed during the film was believable. Keira Knightly as Cathy Ryan did not have small shoes to fill either. Anne Archer as Cathy Ryan was able to convey an understanding without approval (of her husband's work) combined with a love for her family. She portrayed Cathy as a strong willed woman. As I said not easy shoes to fill. I think that Keira Knightly did an excellent job. Being that Keira's role is playing Cathy before marriage, the approach had to be different. She definitely displayed the elements of the character that shine in the earlier films.I enjoyed this film. It did make me think. I enjoyed the intrigue I enjoyed the range of emotions that Jack Ryan goes through while navigating through the events unfolding around him. I liked the interaction of the characters. I liked the story line itself. Most importantly, I did not have to use the dreaded SPOILER ALERT.",4,Well Done,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,2511,"['have', 'always', 'liked', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'novels', 'think', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'great', 'character', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie.I', 'liked', 'told', 'back', 'story', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'joining', 'CIA.I', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'portrayed', 'coming', 'attack', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'have', 'always', 'looked', 'character', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'one', 'acted', 'deep', 'seated', 'patriotism', 'think', 'tying', 'patriotism', 'national', 'tragedy', 'detracts', 'it.I', 'liked', 'way', 'Cathy', 'Muller', 'Future', 'Mrs.', 'Ryan', 'was', 'introduced', 'liked', 'way', 'personality', 'was', 'portrayed', 'did', 'not', 'way', 'Cathy', 'was', 'pulled', 'action', 'Cathy', 'been', 'involved', 'action', 'always', 'been', 'kept', 'away', 'what', 'Jack', 'CIA', 'film', 'put', 'right', 'middle', 'it.As', 'much', 'like', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'portrayal', 'Admiral', 'Greer', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'bring', 'character', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'now', 'enough', 'older', 'was', 'when', 'portraying', 'admiral', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'strange', 'screen', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'captured', 'same', 'essence', 'Commander', 'Harper', 'was', 'brought', 'Admiral', 'Greer', 'was', 'father', 'figure', 'hard', 'ass', 'same', 'time.This', 'cast', 'second', 'time', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'taken', 'mantle', 'iconic', 'role', 'played', 'actor', 'must', 'be', 'glutton', 'punishment', 'think', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'role', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'was', 'believable', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'emotional', 'side', 'character', 'resolve', 'desperation', 'conveyed', 'film', 'was', 'believable', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Cathy', 'Ryan', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'small', 'shoes', 'fill', 'either', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Cathy', 'Ryan', 'was', 'able', 'convey', 'understanding', 'approval', 'husband', 'work', 'combined', 'love', 'family', 'portrayed', 'Cathy', 'strong', 'willed', 'woman', 'said', 'not', 'easy', 'shoes', 'fill', 'think', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'Being', 'Keira', 'role', 'playing', 'Cathy', 'marriage', 'approach', 'had', 'be', 'different', 'definitely', 'displayed', 'elements', 'character', 'shine', 'earlier', 'films.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'did', 'make', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'intrigue', 'enjoyed', 'range', 'emotions', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'navigating', 'events', 'unfolding', 'liked', 'interaction', 'characters', 'liked', 'story', 'line', 'Most', 'importantly', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'use', 'dreaded', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit

When I first heard of this casting, I really didn't think too much of it, as it had been several years since I had first seen The Sum of All Fears and I completely erased any traces of Affleck's awful (my opinion) portrayal from my mind. I was pleasantly surprised by Pine. He reminded me a bit of Harrison Ford (Who is my favorite incarnation of Ryan) in Clear and Present Danger. Kevin Costner is pretty good as Tom Harper as well. I didn't really care for Keira Knightley as Cathy. but she was OK.The script itself is pretty much standard action/suspense/thriller type material; so not fantastic and definitely better acted than it is written, but it entertains.In all, I'd recommend Shadow Recruit to new Jack Ryan fans as well as longtime fans who are willing to keep an open mind and let the movie entertain.",4,"Worthy entry into the Ryan series, but more of a reboot than a prequel",1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,1212,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'series', 'Both', 'film', 'print', 'several', 'years', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'turn', 'Jack', 'Shadow', 'Recruit', 'felt', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'me.Sure', 'not', '34', 'Greatest', 'Movie', 'Ever', 'Made', '34', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun.Chris', 'Pine', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'Jack..', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'casting', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'much', 'had', 'been', 'several', 'years', 'had', 'first', 'seen', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'completely', 'erased', 'traces', 'Affleck', 'awful', 'opinion', 'portrayal', 'mind', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Pine', 'reminded', 'bit', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Who', 'favorite', 'incarnation', 'Ryan', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'pretty', 'good', 'Tom', 'Harper', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Cathy', 'was', 'OK.The', 'script', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'action/suspense/thriller', 'type', 'material', 'not', 'fantastic', 'definitely', 'better', 'acted', 'written', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Shadow', 'Recruit', 'new', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'longtime', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'let', 'movie', 'entertain']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit

1612068,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00AIBZMD6,Paul Allaer,"[2, 3]","""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" (2014 release; 105 min.) brings a reinvented Jack Ryan to the screen, this time as played by Chris Pine, he of the ""Star Trek"" reboot franchise (as Capt. Kirk). AS the movie opens, we see Ryan on the campus of the London School of Economics when 9/11 happens. Ryan volunteers for the Marine Corps and is deployed in Afghanistan, where he gets severely injured during a helicopter attack (check out the Bengals/Ravens jokes before the attack!). During rehab, he gets to know Cathy Muller (played by Keira Knightley), who is about to graduate from med school. Flash forward 10 years: Ryan is now working for the CIA as a financial analyst at a Wall Street investment bank, and he notices weird financial transactions going on in Russia. He reports it to his CIA boss Tom Harper (played by Kevin Costner), and off goes Ryan to Moscow to investigate further. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this movie is directed by none other than Kenneth Branagh (who also plays ""the bad guy""). When I see his name, I usually think of William Shakespeare and theater, not action movies. Not that he doesn't do a pretty good job at it. Second, it really takes a jump of faith to see Chris Pine as Jack Ryan, for one thing, he just looks too young! Third, Keira Knightley oozes charm (and beauty) as Ryan's girlfriend/fiancee. Fourth, as to the action itself, something seemed a little off once in a while. For example, the crucial break-in sequence (where Ryan penetrates the office of the bad guy) goes off way too easily. Last but not least, there are some great one-liners in the movie which bring some much needed light touches. At one point Ryan convinces his Wall Street banker boss that he isn't going to rock the boat, to which his boss replies: ""it's not a boat, it's a luxury yacht, and we're all on it together"", ha! Later on, when Ryan meets up with Harper in Moscow, Ryan complains that he was promised an office job, to which Harper relies ""You're not just a financial analyst anymore, you're operational"", and hands him a gun, ha!Bottom line: while this is certainly not a bad movie per se, and the time flew by quickly, I was nevertheless slightly let down as something is not quite right with this Jack Ryan reboot. The screening I saw this at was surprisingly well attended for a weekday evening show, so it must be that there is a demand for this movie. If you like Jack Ryan, I suggest you check this out for yourself, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions about this reboot.",4,"3.5 stars...

1612070,A1S2M6SA4OAUNK,B00AIBZMD6,Perry,"[144, 156]","First, let me note that there are some spoilers in this review and let me state that it is a very good movie.  However, when you see this movie, you will quickly note that the time here doesn't add up and this is more like a reboot of the series than a prequel and as soon as you see the movie, you will likely agree.Again, I had the pleasure of being invited to this screening and I wasn't going to pass it up being one of the few movies that interests me at the present time.ACTINGThis is really a strong point for the movie!Chris Pine (Star Trek Reboot) does a great job in the role of Jack Ryan and I'm glad the forgettable Ben Affleck only got one shot at the role (Only thing ladies, Chris Pine's less than perfect complexion shows up big time under these cameras).Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Carribean) as Cathy was the most memorable iteration of the character in the series and they made a really good choice here.Kevin Costner (JFK) plays the part of Thomas, the preceptor to Jack Ryan and in typical fashion, Kevin's cool, calm, and collected character works well as the seasoned vet for the CIA who never seems to panic in any situation.Kenneth Branagh (Thor) plays the Russian Financier who appears to be the leader of a movement in the Russian underworld struggling to help bring Russia back to the center of the world at the expense of the United States, it becomes clear that he is only a piece of the puzzle as the movie progresses but, he does a convincing job as the main villain in the film.STORYAgain, stop reading if you don't want details...The movie is set in a post 9/11 world (This is a big reason why this is absolutely not a prequel) and Jack Ryan is pursuiting his doctored at Oxford University in England (Isn't this where all super spy's go?) and we're shown the events of 9/11 unfolding as the crowds flock to the Television sets on the Campus.  After 9/11 Jack Ryan enlists in the Marines where he gets deployed to Afghanistan.Predictable Events unfold that lead to Jack's Helicopter being shot out of the sky and his role in the war is over.  In a military hospital, his spine is stabilized and and he begins therapy where he meets Med Student Cathy (His future wife) and she agrees to have dinner with him, ""the day he runs completely out of the hospital"".While in the hospital, Thomas is introduced and we see him watching a very promising analytical mind in the form of Jack Ryan.  He later offers Jack a job in the CIA working for Wall street where they will analyze financial data to prevent another 9/11 from ever happening again and Jack accepts.In the midst of all this, the Russians protest a Turkish Pipeline and force a vote at the UN Summit but, the USA refuses to let Russia have a monopoly on Natural Gas in the far east and votes to approve the pipeline (Conspiracy theorists have long said such pipelines are why we are in the middle east).  Russia considers the vote for the pipeline as an act of economic War and sets in motion a plan to destroy the US Economy.While working for a financial company, Jack notices transactions where details aren't fully available, he's sent to Moscow to audit the firm responsible for these billion dollar trades as he suspects they're propping up the US economy to short another market.One thing leads to another and Jack is made an active agent while on duty in Russia and that's all I'm going to say about the story as there's still a lot left to see and I don't want to ruin it for you.CINEMATOGRAPHYWhile sharp at times, blurry at others, there were times when the cameras appeared to have a hard time focusing and it was slightly disorienting to me for all of 5 minutes or so but, overall they did a good job with everything else.The scenery, on the other hand chosen was gorgeous and if this was truly Russia then it shows the more beautiful locations and it was overall very nice to look at.CONTENTRated PG-13Nudity = None I recallGun Fire = a handful of scenes coming later in the movie not a ton.Car Chases = 1 Pseudo chaseFights = 3 or 4 topsCursing = very littleCONCLUSIONAt times, Jack Ryan seems a little too unrealistically smart with a knack for being in the right place at the right time but, the Movie itself was very good.

Here, Jack Ryan is played by Chris Pine and the story is about how he uncovers a plot to crash the US economy. Sure, that might not have the same edge as good, old-fashioned terrorism but for what it is, the film delivers a tense and thrilling experience. Other cast members included Keira Knightley as Cathy Muller, Ryan's girlfriend/fianc&eacute;e and Kevin Costner as Harper, Ryan's CIA handler. All of them give good performances, even if their characters don't have too much depth. The lone misstep in casting was Kenneth Branagh, who cast himself as the villain, Viktor Cherevin. While he did put forth a good performance, his accent was kind of hammy and he didn't really add anything new to the stereotypical Russian villain we've seen dozens of times before. As far as action is concerned, it was ok. There wasn't a whole lot of it, but it was mostly shot well. The only scene I didn't particularly care for was a fight towards the end which had a lot of shaky-cam.

Zwick,"[4, 7]","Chris Pine (&#34;Star Trek&#34;) is the latest actor to portray the late Tom Clancy's signature hero, Jack Ryan, an honor that has gone to Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck in previous movie incarnations.In the latest, &#34;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,&#34; which is an original story designed to reboot the series, our hero is an ex-marine turned undercover financial analyst for the CIA who discovers that the dastardly Russians are plotting to crash the dollar while simultaneously launching a terrorist attack on American soil.To no one's real surprise, perhaps, the skilled hand of the original author is sorely lacking in the Adam Kozad/David Koepp screenplay, which seems intent on resurrecting the old Cold War thriller genre in a post-Cold War world.

If you're new to the world of Jack Ryan, then Shadow Recruit may be a halfway decent spy thriller.  However, my first exposure to Jack Ryan was the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October (with Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin), and in comparison Shadow Recruit feels like a made-for-TV movie.The film starts off strong, giving you a glimpse of past events that shape Ryan's life (which the older films don't do).  From there, the story gets fast-paced and is full of intrigue, gun fights and car chases.  Chris Pine does a good job playing the CIA analyst who's out of his element.  The rest of the cast is stellar - Kevin Costner, Keira Knightley, Kenneth Branagh (who also directs).  Costner is good as the grizzled CIA veteran. Branagh makes a compelling villain.  While Knightley features prominently in this film, I thought her role was a step down for her considering all her previous roles.  But ultimately, the film falls short.  The actors' fine performances can't compensate for the run-of-the-mill story.I assume this film just serves to build up the character of Jack Ryan for the inevitable sequels where bigger, better adventures await our hero.  It's not a bad movie, but not great either.  Watch it if you're a Chris Pine fan.

In the novels he goes on to become an investment banker and eventually marries a medical student; here, while struggling to learn to walk again, he meets medical student Cathy Muller (Keira Knightly) and is approached by shadowy CIA figure Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) to work for him, by infiltrating Wall Street to find out where terrorists are getting their funding from.If that sounds like a lot to wade through, you&#8217;re right. While director Kenneth Branagh does a decent enough job of keeping things moving, none of this stuff has anything to do with the actual story. Ryan is a slightly geeky guy with a bad back due to a war wound. He secretly works for the CIA and can&#8217;t tell his girlfriend: that is literally all you need to know to make this movie go.

Chris Pine is the fourth &#8212; and youngest &#8212; actor to play the title character in film, following Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck. Ryan&#8217;s adventures and misadventures are shown early on. They range from serving as an officer in Afghanistan, piloting a helicopter that is blown out of the sky, and recuperating from his injuries in a Washington hospital. Keira Knightley plays Cathy Muller, the woman in his life. Russian super-spy Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh), channeling every colorful James Bond villain, is determined to get the attention of the world through a financial and terrorist attack on the United States. Ryan has to stop him.The movie draws on the 007 movies, &#8220;Mission: Impossible,&#8221; and the Bourne series, but fails to carve out its own identity. Pine is fine, given the uninspired material, and the action scenes are staged elaborately. But the movie feels as if we&#8217;ve seen it all before.Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include deleted and expanded scenes, commentary by director Kenneth Branagh, a profile of Jack Ryan, several making-of featurettes, and a Digital HD copy.",3,"To quote Yogi Berra...""Deja vu all over again.""",1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,1254,"['8220', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Shadow', 'Recruit', '8221', 'based', 'character', 'created', 'late', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'fourth', '8212', 'youngest', '8212', 'actor', 'play', 'title', 'character', 'film', 'following', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Ryan', '8217', 'adventures', 'misadventures', 'are', 'shown', 'early', 'range', 'serving', 'officer', 'Afghanistan', 'piloting', 'helicopter', 'blown', 'sky', 'recuperating', 'injuries', 'Washington', 'hospital', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Cathy', 'Muller', 'woman', 'life', 'Russian', 'super-spy', 'Viktor', 'Cherevin', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'channeling', 'colorful', 'James', 'Bond', 'villain', 'determined', 'get', 'attention', 'world', 'financial', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'United', 'States', 'Ryan', 'stop', 'him.The', 'movie', 'draws', '007', 'movies', '8220', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '8221', 'Bourne', 'series', 'carve', 'out', 'own', 'identity', 'Pine', 'fine', 'given', 'uninspired', 'material', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'staged', 'elaborately', 'movie', 'feels', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'before.Bonus', 'extras', '2-disc', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'include', 'deleted', 'expanded', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'director', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'profile', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'several', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'Digital', 'HD', 'copy']",Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit

It&#8217;s been about ten years since we met him on screen last time. Is the new film worth that wait? Well, it depends.In the first twenty minutes of &#8220;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&#8221; we see how young Jack Ryan went to Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attack, how he met his girlfriend Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley), and how was recruited by a CIA superior Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner). The pace is too fast, with no memorable episode about who Jack Ryan is, or what he is capable of.Things get more interesting when he travels from Wall Street to Moscow to uncover the mystery surrounding the accounts of Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh).
