1193409,AS9O64VWVZNXV,B001G619C0,Crazy Canuck,"[4, 7]","When I bought Van Helsing which had the monstrous trio of Dracula, Frankenstein and the Werewolf, I realized the Mummy was missing from the monster squad.  So when I had the opportunity, I bought the Mummy trilogy blu-ray boxset.  I wasn't disappointed as the 3 films provided thrilling entertainment with the highest audio-visual quality.  The 1080p high definition graphics brought out the sharpest and minutest details.  For example, you can see the fine sand particles blowing as the Mummy transforms himself into sand and then disperses at will.  Each film also comes with plenty of extra features, showcasing the movie-making processes, special effects secrets and deleted scenes etc.  All 3 films are encoded with DTS-HD audio which brings the action sequences to life with booming bass.Amongst the 3 films, my favourite is Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.  Probably because it was the latest in the franchise, the visuals and audio are the most pristine.  This movie also transplants the Mummy mythology into other civilizations (in this case, terracotta warriors) and takes the audience out of Egypt for a refreshing change.  The Yeti monsters were very well done and animated; the avalanche scenes were breathtaking; the Dragon Emperor was probably more fearsome than Imhotep had ever been.I highly recommend this blu-ray boxset to HD movie buffs.  Although the franchise is very heavy on CGI (not surprising, being Stephen Sommers films), each film offers 2 hours' money worth of entertainment for the action-adventure fan.  Until Universal Pictures makes the 4th film, this boxset offers the best collection of Mummy adventures money can buy,",5,The Mummy Trilogy Blu-Ray Review,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,1649,"['When', 'bought', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'had', 'monstrous', 'trio', 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'Werewolf', 'realized', 'Mummy', 'was', 'missing', 'monster', 'squad', 'when', 'had', 'opportunity', 'bought', 'Mummy', 'trilogy', 'blu-ray', 'boxset', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', '3', 'films', 'provided', 'thrilling', 'entertainment', 'highest', 'audio-visual', 'quality', '1080p', 'high', 'definition', 'graphics', 'brought', 'out', 'sharpest', 'minutest', 'details', 'example', 'can', 'see', 'fine', 'sand', 'particles', 'blowing', 'Mummy', 'sand', 'then', 'will', 'film', 'also', 'plenty', 'extra', 'features', 'showcasing', 'movie-making', 'processes', 'special', 'effects', 'secrets', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'etc', '3', 'films', 'are', 'encoded', 'DTS-HD', 'audio', 'action', 'sequences', 'life', 'booming', 'bass.Amongst', '3', 'films', 'favourite', 'Tomb', 'Dragon', 'Emperor', 'Probably', 'was', 'latest', 'franchise', 'visuals', 'audio', 'are', 'most', 'pristine', 'movie', 'also', 'Mummy', 'mythology', 'other', 'civilizations', 'case', 'terracotta', 'warriors', 'audience', 'Egypt', 'refreshing', 'change', 'Yeti', 'monsters', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'animated', 'avalanche', 'scenes', 'were', 'breathtaking', 'Dragon', 'Emperor', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'fearsome', 'Imhotep', 'had', 'ever', 'been.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'blu-ray', 'boxset', 'HD', 'movie', 'buffs', 'franchise', 'very', 'heavy', 'CGI', 'not', 'surprising', 'being', 'Stephen', 'Sommers', 'films', 'film', '2', 'hours', 'money', 'worth', 'entertainment', 'action-adventure', 'fan', 'Universal', 'Pictures', '4th', 'film', 'boxset', 'best', 'collection', 'Mummy', 'money', 'can', 'buy']",The Mummy Trilogy

Universal successfully resuscitated it's venerable monster genre and transformed it into bigtime Tentpole event movies and produced two very good action adventure rides to take with the kids. III - Phoned in.  Brendan collects huge paycheck and goes home. Rachel wisely stays away in the first place.  Kid being groomed to carry on - the poor man's Shia (and I didn't think much of him either).  Jet Li - stony and morose.  Story is flat.  Use of China as a backdrop - secondary and poorly executed (nothing new or breathtaking here). This truly is the sin - we're actually IN China for heaven's sake and there is no grand vista, no expansive shots to dazzle us with the landscape.  In watching the nightclub scenes I kept expecting Kate Capshaw to step out and start singing - it's that derivative. Everything else is CGI.  No overall quality to raise it to the level of the other two.  But the kids will like the ride none-the-less...and yet...Worth the upgrade?

It was excellent, I was wrong about Brendon Fraser, he was actually good in the leading role. The action was amazing, at the time it was cutting edge graphics. The story was typical bad guys chasing the good guys over lost fortune. However, it was well written & quite enjoyable. The second movie was also good & was one of the first movies that the ROCK was in. He pulled it off as the Scorpion King. Brendon Fraser returned and also was excellent yet again in the sequel. The last movie had Jet Li as the Emperor who had a curse put on him & again Brendon Fraser goes head to head against the evil bad guy.
