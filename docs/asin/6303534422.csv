He performs a concert at the morning assembly as teenage rock sensation, Powerline.Everything works out fine...until the principal finds out.The principal calls Goofy at work and tells him Max is headed for the electric chair.A horrified Goofy takes Max on a road trip.

379071,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303534422,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","I wrote an entire review for this film and then realize that I was over thinking everything and that it was probably the most unhelpful review of a children's film ever written for this site.  It was starting to go over my own head.HA.So, I trashed it and started over.`A Goofy Movie' is Disney's attempt at a father/son film.  It stars the likable goof, Goofy and his son Max.  Max is getting in trouble for normal teenage boy pranks pulled to impress a girl, but obviously his dad wouldn't understand.  Goofy decides to take his son on a trip in order to `help him' but that is not the help he wants.`A Goofy Movie' has a message, a typical Disney schmaltzy message about family togetherness, but it's cute and effective to be wholly honest.  While it is far from the best animated film out there (and it pales in comparison to that other 95 mega-hit `Toy Story') it is sweet and has some charm to it.  From a technical aspect this film is mediocre.  The music isn't all that wonderful, although it has some catchy qualities to it.  It can at times seem lazy.  The humor is hot and miss, sometimes overly generic.  I mean, this cartoon has been done before MANY times with different characters.  There are not a whole lot of father/son type films out there, especially animated films, so this has that going for it, but I can't say that it really broaches the subject with much depth.This film is targeted at the funny bone of a child, and that works, but it doesn't really do much outside of that small box.I enjoyed this as a kid.  I'll admit that.  I was ten with this was released and I liked it.  I never flocked to it and I never owned it, but my friends did and I had no qualms with watching it at their house.That said; it's forgettable.",3,Likable yet forgettable...,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,1747,"['wrote', 'entire', 'review', 'film', 'then', 'realize', 'was', 'thinking', 'everything', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'unhelpful', 'review', 'children', 'film', 'ever', 'written', 'site', 'was', 'starting', 'go', 'over', 'own', 'head.HA.So', 'trashed', 'started', 'over.', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'Disney', 'attempt', 'father/son', 'film', 'likable', 'goof', 'Goofy', 'son', 'Max', 'Max', 'getting', 'trouble', 'normal', 'teenage', 'boy', 'pranks', 'pulled', 'impress', 'girl', 'obviously', 'dad', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Goofy', 'take', 'son', 'trip', 'order', 'help', 'not', 'help', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'message', 'typical', 'Disney', 'schmaltzy', 'message', 'family', 'togetherness', 'cute', 'effective', 'be', 'wholly', 'honest', 'far', 'best', 'animated', 'film', 'there', 'comparison', 'other', '95', 'mega-hit', 'Toy', 'Story', 'sweet', 'charm', 'technical', 'aspect', 'film', 'mediocre', 'music', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'catchy', 'qualities', 'can', 'times', 'seem', 'lazy', 'humor', 'hot', 'miss', 'sometimes', 'overly', 'generic', 'mean', 'cartoon', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'MANY', 'times', 'different', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'father/son', 'type', 'films', 'there', 'especially', 'animated', 'films', 'so', 'going', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'really', 'subject', 'much', 'depth.This', 'film', 'targeted', 'funny', 'bone', 'child', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'small', 'box.I', 'enjoyed', 'kid', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'ten', 'was', 'released', 'liked', 'never', 'flocked', 'never', 'owned', 'friends', 'did', 'had', 'qualms', 'watching', 'house.That', 'said', 'forgettable']",A Goofy Movie Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS

Words can't describe the nostalgia I get just looking at this movie on this site&lt;3 Its been years since I've seen this movie and a huge part of my childhood. The last time I saw it I was about 9 or 10 years old before my VHSes stopped working. When I was little this movie was one of my favorite Disney movies ever. One of my fondest memories of this movie was its soundtrack. Its definately one of the most underrated movie soundtracks. I didn't know it then, but Tevin Cambell (an R&B singer) did the music for, the Goofy universes version of Michael jackson, Powerline. OMG! I have Eye To Eye and Stand Out on my MP3 player now. I even have the clips from the songs in my favorites on Youtube! The animation is definately top notch. It takes me back to the time when Disney, Don Bluth (when they were awesome) and other companies made handdrawn cartoon movies instead of just CGI. At least Princess and The Frog is an attempt at bringing back that magic, but whens the next one coming. Theres alot I can say about this movie, but it'll be pages long. Think god for the internet because now I can find this movie again after all these years&lt;3 I'm definately gonna buy off Amazon and if you haven't seen it before, then you should too.

379073,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,6303534422,Armando N. Roman,"[9, 9]","A Goofy Movie is my favorite Disney animated movie of all time. Hands down. It's almost never mentioned by uppity film critics, a lot of Disney fans usually forget it, and it isn't exactly a 'masterpiece' like Snow White with stunning animation, but it definitely holds its own. I watched it back when it came out, and I loved it. Remembering this, I saw it sitting on a shelf at the store and decided to give it another shot to see if it stood the test of time and my being 25 now. It did. If anything, it only got better. Before The Incredibles, there was another Disney film that brought families close together. And that, was A Goofy Movie, believe it or not. Go ahead and laugh, because I wouldn't believe it if someone told me that too. Goofy, bringing families closer together? Insane! But it's not. Goofy is a great character for this kind of movie about a teenager growing distant from his dad. While it's a good one for families, it's even better if you're a single dad with a son. While I'm a few months late in saying this, it's also a very good Father's Day movie if you two can sit back and enjoy ""just"" a cartoon.We start out with Max, Goofy's son. He's dreaming about a girl he has a crush on, Roxanne. It's ruined before they kiss, when he starts to turn into his dad. Huge teeth, feet, hands, ears, everything. He wakes up, and panics once more- he's overslept and he's almost late for a little surprise at school. His dad busts in and embarrasses him already, showing up with a towel wrapped around his body and one on his head too while Max is getting dressed. Not a good start for the last day of school. Max makes it and gets together with PJ and Bobby (a new character voiced by Pauly Shore. He acts just like him too). They throw together a huge stage performance where Max imitates Powerline, a pop star in the Goof world, and everyone in the school goes nuts. It comes to a halt when the principal interrupts, and the three friends get into big trouble. Unfortunately, he calls each of their parents at a bad time- Pete (PJ's dad) is giving Goofy a speech about how Max could join a gang or get into even worse trouble if Goofy doesn't start being a little harder on him. Goofy takes the call from the principal as a little wake up call, and makes plans to go on a trip to a fishing spot he and his dad went on ages ago. Well, Max had impressed Roxanne with that onstage risk, and they were going to go to an after-grad party together. The trip gets in the way, and he lies to her, saying he's going to see Powerline live since he knows him. Goofy and Max hit the road to what Goofy thinks is a fun fishing trip and time to bond with his son, but it's anything but. The two argue, stop talking to eachother for a period of time, get into huge danger in the woods and in a river, and more. I'm sure every parent with a teenager can relate to most of what goes on here.Now, even just barely out of my teenage years, this movie really hits me. How Max treats his dad from time to time made me resent him, but also made me realize that we've all done something like that. Leaving in the middle of what's supposed to be a fun place because you think it's dumb...you can see the pain on Goofy's face when Max does this. And what makes it hurt the viewer is that it's Goofy- a character who's always upbeat and happy. Watching him get sad actually made me tear up. What's worse is when he and Max run into a mishap involving a waterfall. Eventhough I know how it's going to end, I wanted Goofy to be alright. See? This is just an animated character. But you get attached to him after all he goes through. But now I'm making the movie sound depressing. Aside from a few moments like the ones I've mentioned, the movie's funny overall, and kids age 11+ will be sure to get a few laughs out of it. Bigfoot discovering disco music has to be one of these things.The visual quality didn't get the best treatment here, but I'm hoping a Platinum Edition is in the works somewhere down the line. There's notable grain and smudges one the print, and it looks like a slightly cleaned up vhs version. But the movie was made in the mid-late 90's, so it still looks pretty good animation-wise. No jagged lines here. And the audio's nice and loud. The Powerline songs at the beginning and end are booming all over the place. Some sound effects are a tad quiet, like Goofy and Max stay at the underwater-themed hotel, but it's nothing you'll mind unless you're listening for things like this.Here's the reason it gets four stars instead of five. While I was surprised when I went to the special features menu, and discovered some that were actually good, there weren't enough. I remember seeing some concept designs for Big Foot and a few other characters way back when, and it would've been nice to have had them here in some sort of gallery. Also, it would've been nice if Disney had given it as equally great extras as some other Gold Classic Classic discs. But what's here's still good. The first one I have to mention is an entire episode of the classic Disney Afternoon cartoon: Goof Troop. It's the ""Calling All Goofs"" episode in which a few of Goofy's relatives are having a reunion. Because Pete screws up Goofy's car, he can't go. So instead, Peg (Pete's sultry wife) has the reunion at their house. Of course, we all know how Pete is around Goofy. How will he handle more than one at the same time? It's pure chaos. Unfortunately, the transfer to dvd wasn't kind to the episode, and there are a lot of visual problems here and there (some images jump around instead of smoothly moving. Keep focused on a character when they're doing something, and you'll notice it). It's a funny episode still, and I was surprised to be laughing at it well over ten years after it first aired. It was nice seeing the whole crew, sans Chainsaw. Next, is the biggest extra of the batch- A Goofy Success Story, running over 40 minutes. It covers how Goofy became a household name. It goes well into his past, and is a must-see for classic Disney fans and animation fans in general. After this is the embarrassing A Goofy Movie dvd Storybook. If you remember those books on tape...with books included of Disney movies from the 90's, that's what this is...only you watch it. There's the option of having it read to you, in which the narrator sounds like he's talking to kids with ADD. This is actually worth a laugh, if only for what pictures they chose for each page. The first 3 had me holding my sides (go ahead an' say I'm immature. I don't care). What's almost as bad is the Disney Mambo No. 5 by Lou Bega. It's Mambo No. 5...but with some changes for a family audience and a Disney theme. What's somewhat sick is that he goes over pairings for characters. Like Mickey = Minnie, Donald = Daisy. But then he gets to Pluto, who in turn gets Huey, Louie and Dewy. Horrid. There's also a lame trivia game and the usual trailer to round things out.That's all there is to it. Get A Goofy Movie. Don't even rent it, just buy it. We're never going to get another one like this.",4,Disney's most underrated animated feature.,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,7067,"['Goofy', 'Movie', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movie', 'time',

Max, Goofy's son, has a crush on a girl but a recent event at school leads Goofy to believe that he hasn't been paying much attention to his son. So Goofy plans a road trip for the summer, much to Max's dismay. But before they leave, Max lies to his friends by saying that he is going to L.A to a concert of a popular singer. When Goofy puts Max in charge of the map, he deceives his father by re-routing their trip through L.A., so he can be popular in the eys of his girlThe movie is well done, no contrived story or anything like that. Had it been inducted into the &quot;Disney Classic&quot; library, a lot more work would have needed to be done as far as quality goes.The DVD unfortunately, does not present the film in it's original aspect ratio, but does make up for it by including two Goofy Cartoons, each about 20 mins.

(STOP reading if don't want to know the story!!!)It begins when Max is having a dream about his ""crush,"" Roxanne.  His dream turns out to be a nightmare because he turns into his father, Goofy.  After he wakes up, he rushes to school for ""The Big Day.""  This was the last and only day he had the chance to finally impress her.  It turns out that she actually does like him and their first date is set for the end of the school party.  Max is at the top of the world until he gets home.Worried that his son would ""end up in the electric chair,"" Goofy takes Max on an unexpected fishing trip to LAKE DESTINY, IDAHO.  Before they left, Max had to tell Roxanne why he couldn't make it to the party.  Not thinking, he tells her that he was going to see a concert.  On this fishing trip, he and Goofy amazingly learn a lot about each other.  To make Max happy, his dad does take him to the POWERLINE concert in LA.  When they get back home...I won't spoil the ending:)This was entertaining and was one of the best Disney movies ever since The Lion King or Aladdin.

If Disney can put in time for silly films such as The Little Mermaid and Bambi (to be released in the future), then they can surely make a collectors edition of this movie too.

The cross-country road trip is rather enjoyable, the romance between Max and Roxanne is cute, and the movie's soundtrack is pretty good too. Some of the songs are kind of cheesy, but I thought the last song ""Eye to Eye"" and the background music was great.I think this movie teaches a lot of life lessons as well. A vacation can be a great bonding experience for people with a rocky relationship. Parents need to accept at some point that their children are growing up, and children need to understand that often, parents are looking out for the children's best interests.

That said, A GOOFY MOVIE feels somewhat disconnected from the show, as indicated by the style of the animation and the lack of certain characters around (Pete's wife and daughter Peg and Pistol, respectively). Not that it is a detriment at all, however; in fact, A GOOFY MOVIE is all the better for it. While there are laughs to be had, what really makes this movie is the fully-realized characterizations, particularly in the development of the relationship between Goofy and his teenage son Max, which serves as the central focus for the story.Goofy (Bill Farmer, who has never been better) is cast as a suburban '90s father who bumbles his way through everything, including almost vacuuming up a prized cardboard statue and smashing a fence when driving his car out of the driveway. An admirer of old-fashioned things like Xavier Cougat, ""High Hopes"", and fishing, he is a frequent source of embarrassment to Max (Jason Marsden), who is going through that typical adolescent stage where girls, rock 'n roll, and social acceptance are more important to him. Smitten with one particularly pretty classmate, Roxanne (Kellie Martin), he plucks up the courage to ask her out on a date... but not before hijacking the last school assembly to put on an impromptu rock concert as his idol, a rock superstar named Powerline (Tevin Campbell, who gets to sing two of the movie's liveliest and memorable tunes, ""Stand Out"" and ""I 2 I""). Max does this to both impress the girl and win admiration from his classmates (who think he's, well, a goofball), but the exasperated principal (Wallace Shawn) misinterprets his actions as a case of being on a road to crime, a point that he overexaggerates in the extreme on a phonecall to Goofy. Needless to say, Goofy is horrified by the news and forces Max to go on a cross-country vacation with him to Lake Destiny to reestablish their bond. Of course, what Goofy doesn't realize is that Max, who has no choice but to cancel his date, boasts that he will be onstage at Powerline's newest concert in L.A. instead. This sets up a source of tension that escalates between Goofy and Max as they stop at rundown, cringeworthy ""resorts"" such as the shady-looking Lester's Possum Park (a very loose parody of Disney's ""Country Bear Jamboree"") and even get into an encounter with Bigfoot. (The latter experience culminates with the beast dancing to the Bee Gee's ""Staying Alive"" on Max's headphones.) Amazingly, though, Goofy and Max begin to bond as their trip progresses; but Max is still troubled by his predicament, and, thinking his father won't understand, he decides to alter the map so that they can go to the concert instead... ultimately realizing that telling the truth is the better thing to do.Even with the presence of a iconic loveable bumbler like Goofy as the star, A GOOFY MOVIE is primarily targeted at teenagers, who will undoubtedly relate to Max and his adolescent struggles. On the other side of the fence, parents will also be able to identify with Goofy as he deals with his son's resentment about the vacation while trying to prove that all he really wants is for his son to be happy. It's not often to see such a complex development in a project which is disconnected from Disney's canonical features, much less one from a character best known for tripping on his heels or bungling simple tasks (ala the ""How to"" Goofy shorts). Ultimately, though, that's what gives A GOOFY MOVIE its heart. No character is portrayed as a purely perfect ""hero"" or a downright evil ""villain""; they are surprisingly more multi-layered than what you'd come to expect. Critics have often dismissed this film as a lesser effort from Disney, but A GOOFY MOVIE has achieved a loyal following, purely because of the surprisingly realistic, honest depiction of ""teenager"" relationships with their parents.  (It also marks the first time we've ever seen Goofy look genuinely crushed and betrayed, particularly when he discovers his son is manipulating him into going to some place other than their fishing destination, as well as having a heated argument with the boy immediately afterward.)One issue that I do have with A GOOFY MOVIE, however, may be that some of the newer characters introduced, from cheese-guzzling Bobby (an uncredited Pauly Shore), to nerdy class president Stacey (Jenna Von Oy) to Roxanne herself all don't have much screentime. Since all three come across as very appealing newcomers, it would have been interesting to flesh out their relationships with Max and Goofy. Particularly Roxanne, who, although sweet and insecure, leaves one wanting to see her on that special date with Max. This ""tease"" somewhat grates on me, although not enough to bring down the film.Technically, the animation in A GOOFY MOVIE (produced primarily at Disney's animation studios in Paris, Sydney, and Toronto) isn't as richly detailed as most of the studio's other films; frankly, though, it is both above-average and very well-suited to this kind of ""cartoon"". This is a major difference from the TV show, which mostly had pencil-drawn backgrounds that gave the show a bit of a sketchbook style. The more softer colors used in the film (and occasionally dramatic close-ups) lend themselves well to the more emotional parts of the story (notably when mean-spirited Pete tells Goofy about his son changing the map). The soundtrack is also a lot of fun; aside from the aforementioned rock songs, other catchy memorable numbers include the exuberant ""After Today"", the bouncy ""On the Open Road"", and the heartfelt ""Nobody Else but You"", all written by Tom Snow and Jack Feldman, respectively. Probably the only false note is the ""Lester's Possum Park"" singalong, but then again, that may be intentional, since the camp is supposed to be, as Max best describes it, ""pathetic"". Carter Burwell's musical score is also quite good, and arguably better than some of Alan Menken's instrumental scores for other Disney movies.All in all, A GOOFY MOVIE may not rank as one of Disney's greatest animated films, but it certainly deserves better recognition. It works very well as entertainment and as a character study, yet as a starring vehicle for Goofy it's something quite different from what one would be used to seeing. That it holds up well even after being released in 1995 (even more so than most of the studio's post-LION KING films, excluding THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, MULAN, TARZAN, FANTASIA 2000, LILO AND STITCH, and the recently released THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, all of which I loved) is also remarkable.",4,"Funny as you'd expect, with a surprisingly strong amount of realistic

Emulating his pop-star hero, Powerline, Max pulls off the stunt long enough to gain major popularity points with his peers and get the date he was hoping for, but not without landing himself in the principal's office to boot. A phone call to his dad instantly foils Max's plans for a summer of love, as Goofy becomes convinced that he needs to spend some quality time with his son. Before he can escape, Max is whisked away on a cross-country road trip to Goofy's favorite fishing spot, but he manages to squeeze in one last talk with Roxanne on the way. Unfortunately, in a final effort to keep Roxanne from finding another date to her friend Stacey's concert watching party, Max promises to wave to her from the stage when he and his dad join Powerline in the final number! Suddenly, he's told the biggest lie of his life and has no idea how to get out of it. When Max decides to alter Goofy's treasured family map halfway through the trip and head them towards the concert in L.A., he finally starts to have a good time, but at what price?""A Goofy Movie"" was a surprise gem from Disney in 1995 that surely would have made Walt proud! The writing and animation are top notch, with a completely original, believable, hilarious and charming father/son story expanding on the popular ""Goof Troop"" TV series from 1992. In this bigscreen feature, Max and his friend P.J. have moved on to high school, and Pete is still around to cause trouble for Goofy with his nasty demeanor and awful advice. Absent with no explanation, however, are Pete's wife Peg and small daughter, Pistol, and both Goofy and Pete now work as baby photographers in a retail store. The characters are just as we remember them though, and looking better than ever, only the older Max is now voiced by James Marsden. But don't worry if you never watched ""Goof Troop"" back in the day. This movie completely stands on its own feet as a solid and highly entertaining story of its own, and Goofy (Bill Farmer) and Pete (Jim Cummings) are not much different than they were in their classic Disney shorts. Some major new characters are created for the film too, like Pauly Shore's Bobby, a high school friend of Max and P.J.'s, and the adorable Roxanne, voiced by the equally adorable Kellie Martin. The film boasts some excellent original songs too, and just about all the goofy fun you can handle!The Gold Collection DVD of ""A Goofy Movie"" is so close to being outstanding that it's a real shame they missed the mark by making it fullscreen only! Other than that, it is surprisingly generous with extras (for a Disney release), especially considering the quality of those extras. The two most notable are ""Calling All Goofs"", an episode of the TV series ""Goof Troop"" billed on this DVD as a ""Max and Goofy Cartoon"" and omitting the opening song, and ""A Goofy Success Story"", which is a wonderful episode of the old Disney anthology series in full color and introduced by Walt that tells the tale of how Goofy was discovered in Hollywood by talent scouts and became the award winning star he is today! That second program includes four classic Disney shorts edited to fit the context of the story, but more importantly, it includes a large amount of charming new (at the time) animation to tell the behind the scenes story of Goofy's success. In addition to those two excellent extras, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, a trivia game, and a read-along story of the movie that may seem pointless to us but would be great if you have young children. Though, an original story might have been better than just a read-along version of the film. Truthfully, I suppose it would also have been nice to have some more extras relating to the film itself, like character design art (especially for Roxanne) and a behind the scenes featurette, but with ""A Goofy Success Story"" and an entire episode of Goof Troop, it's pretty tough to complain about anything other than that fullscreen presentation. Fullscreen or not though, this film is a must own! If you don't have it, I highly recommend it! For the Goofy fan, the extras alone make it a worthy purchase! I also highly recommend the direct-to-video sequel, ""An Extremely Goofy Movie."" Yeah, it's lower budget, but it is far better than your average Disney direct-to-video sequel. And, seek out Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Goofy if you don't have it already. I just wish they would hurry-up and release Sport Goofy in ""Soccermania"" to DVD already, not to mention ""Goof Troop"" in volume sets like they have for Duck Tales, Tale Spin, Gummi Bears, and Rescue Rangers. I suppose The Wuzzles should come first though.

379115,A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z,6303534422,"Santeria ""Son of Tazz""","[18, 22]","The trick in most Goofy titles, is that the schtick needs to be paced. The cartoons allowed for a frenetic pace which was often offset by another characters style. Well, this movie  succeeds in sustaining the style of Goofy, with a story that has a cast of many other funny  characters.For a Franco-American co-production, it does ( for me ) come as a surprise that this has been achieved. However, the answer lies in the traditional animation style, and a strong script.Bill Farmer's voice work is totally  awesome in this film, as in the Casper series, and he captures the reinvented Goofy that came to screens with the series developed around or after the success  of DUCK TALES.Stylistically, the Characters were re-done for the ""modern"" audience, and unfortunately were part of the Disney downgrade of the style of drawing that has led to the cessation of traditional animation methods. The problem I have with this is not the shift to a totally  computer generated  form, but that the style as evinced by people like the Masterful Carl Barks, but that for all the high tech  gadgets that Disney has its command, it cannot do the simple thing of copy the classic style.Fortunately, A GOOFY MOVIE maintains the high visual standards, but is one of a limited number of films that led up to dross like TWICE UPON A CHRISTMAS.The gags in this film are brilliant; case in point, Big Foots Dance sequence as the backdrop to a moving scene with Max and Goofy... its clearly a reference for Adults, since the music and the Dance sequence is so 70's. And the entire movie combines classic Goofy  material together with contemporary  references, in such  a manner that the style of the Saturday Cartoon  series that featured Goofy, Max , Pete, and etc, is emulated  very well.Totally worth it for the fan of Goofy and the cartoon series of the 90s.",5,A Sustained Work of Goofy-Dom ...,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,1843,"['trick', 'most', 'Goofy', 'titles', 'schtick', 'be', 'paced', 'cartoons', 'allowed', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'was', 'often', 'offset', 'characters', 'style', 'Well', 'movie', 'sustaining', 'style', 'Goofy', 'story', 'cast', 'many', 'other', 'funny', 'characters.For', 'Franco-American', 'co-production', 'come', 'surprise', 'been', 'achieved', 'However', 'answer', 'traditional', 'animation', 'style', 'strong', 'script.Bill', 'Farmer', 'voice', 'work', 'totally', 'awesome', 'film', 'Casper', 'series', 'reinvented', 'Goofy', 'came', 'screens', 'series', 'developed', 'success', 'DUCK', 'TALES.Stylistically', 'Characters', 'were', 're-done', 'modern', 'audience', 'unfortunately', 'were', 'part', 'Disney', 'downgrade', 'style', 'drawing', 'led', 'cessation', 'traditional', 'animation', 'methods', 'problem', 'have', 'not', 'shift', 'totally', 'computer', 'generated', 'form', 'style', 'evinced', 'people', 'Masterful', 'Carl', 'Barks', 'high', 'tech', 'gadgets', 'Disney', 'command', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'simple', 'thing', 'copy', 'classic', 'style.Fortunately', 'A', 'GOOFY', 'MOVIE', 'high', 'visual', 'standards', 'one', 'limited', 'number', 'films', 'led', 'up', 'dross', 'TWICE', 'UPON', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS.The', 'gags', 'film', 'are', 'brilliant', 'case', 'point', 'Big', 'Foots', 'Dance', 'sequence', 'backdrop', 'moving', 'scene', 'Max', 'Goofy', 'clearly', 'reference', 'Adults', 'music', 'Dance', 'sequence', 'so', '70', 'entire', 'movie', 'combines', 'classic', 'Goofy', 'material', 'together', 'contemporary', 'references', 'manner', 'style', 'Saturday', 'Cartoon', 'series', 'featured', 'Goofy', 'Max', 'Pete', 'etc', 'emulated', 'very', 'well.Totally', 'worth', 'fan', 'Goofy', 'cartoon', 'series', '90s']",A Goofy Movie Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS
