260821,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301661893,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 0]","""Posse"" is basically a manhunt film with political overtones. It came out in 1975 on the heels of ""Watergate"" and underscores the idea that apparently good actions have underlying self-serving motivations. In this case, a manhunt serves as a chance for an ambitious Marshall to get elected to the Senate.This type of revisionist western was popular in the late 60s and 70s. Prime examples include ""Little Big Man"" (1970), ""Soldier Blue"" (1970), ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" (1971), ""Dirty Little Billy"" (1972), ""Chato's Land"" (1972), and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976).Kirk Douglas (1916 - ) plays the Marshall. He was a big star at the time. He had been Oscar nominated 3 times (""Champion"" in 1949, ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" in 1952, and ""Lust for Life"" in 1957) and had won the Golden Glove for ""Lust for Life"". His memorable roles include ""Young Man with a Horn"" (1950), ""Paths of Glory"" (1957),  ""The Vikings"" (1958), ""Spartacus"" (1960) and ""Seven Days in May"" (1964) He appears as #17 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.FWIW - Douglas appeared in one of the earliest revisionist westerns, ""Lonely are the Brave"" (1962) which was written by Dalton Trumball.Crooked faced Bruce Dern (1936) is the psycho you love to hate. He's one of the few men who ever killed John Wayne on screen (""The Cowboys"") or who tried to blow up a MLB team from a Goodyear blimp (""Super Bowl""). Yet he's also given us very nuanced performances (""The Great Gatsby"", ""The King of Marvin Gardens"") and was nominated for an Oscar for ""Coming Home"" (1978). Dern plays the notorious bank robber who is the subject of Douglas' manhunt.The posse contains Bo Hopkins and Luke Askew.Bo Hopkins (1942 - ) was a favorite of Sam Peckinpah in films like ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), ""The Killer Elite"" and ""The Getaway"" where he played psychopathic killers. In 1995 he won a Golden Boot for his contributions to western films.Luke Askew (1937) usually appears in westerns (""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"", ""Will Penny"", ""The Magnificent Seven Ride""), although he has made good contributions in films like ""Easy Rider"" as a stranger on the highway and ""Cool Hand Luke"" as Boss Paul.James Stacy (1936) returned to the movie screen for the first time following his motorcycle accident which left him without a left arm and leg. Stacy had been a busy actor on TV (""Ozzie and Harriet"", ""Gunsmoke"", ""Lancer""). Kirk Douglas designed this role specifically for Stacy to get him back to work. He continued working after this, most notably in the TV series ""Wiseguy"" (1990).In addition to starring, Douglas was the director. This was his second (and last) outing as a Director, having made ""Scalawag"" in 1973. This was also his last outing as a producer, having made 7 previous films including ""Paths of Glory"" (1957), ""Spartacus"" (1960), and ""Grand Prix"" (1966).FWIW - It was Douglas's insistence as a producer of ""Spartacus"" to use Dalton Trumball which is credited with breaking the notorious ""blacklist"" in Hollywood.Fred Koenekamp (1922) handles the camera. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times and won for ""The Towering Inferno"" (1975). Among his notable films are ""Pattom"" (1970) and ""Papillon"" (1973). He also worked on various TV series - ""Kung Fu"" (1972-3) and ""The Man from UNCLE"" (1964-7).Maurice Jarre (1924-2009) provides the musical score. Jarre was nominated for an Oscar 9 times and won 3 times (""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""A Passage to India""). Among his westerns were ""The Professionals"" (1966), ""Red Sun"" (1971), and ""The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean"" (1972).The top grossing films in 1975 were ""Jaws"", ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", and ""Shampoo""  The big Oscar winner was ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (Picture, Director. Actor, Actress, Screenplay). Other notable films that year were ""Nashville"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Barry Lyndon"" ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", and ""Seven Beauties"".It wasn't a strong year for westerns - ""Breakheart Pass"" and ""Rooster Cogburn"" were the only other westerns that year.The NY Times' Vincent Canby called it a ""genial, sometimes witty Western"" and ""Saturday afternoon entertainment that needn't be ignored at night.""Good performances, excellent photography and sound, and a good subversive script make this one to see if you like revisionist westerns.",4,Good revisionist western,1310428800,"07

Seems Nightingale's boys aren't too shy.Things come to a head when the tables are turned, and the ending is a total shock for those expecting things to turn out the way they ""should"" in a Western which, let's face it, is supposed to typify the core of what's good and true in American civilization.  The editor of the local newspaper, a former soldier now missing an arm and a leg, is intriguingly similar in his perspective to Strawhorn; this comes out in some subtle and not so subtle ways.Douglas himself directed this piercing look at American greed and lust and acquitted himself admirably.

260830,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6301661893,William Timothy Lukeman,"[13, 16]","Here's a perfect example of a small, quietly subversive film, obviously created in a specific time, whose message hasn't dated in the least. It's  produced, directed by & stars Kirk Douglas as a Texas lawman with his sights on the Senate, perhaps even the Presidency. He travels in a special train provided by the railroads, whom he'll represent once in office; he has a handpicked posse to help him in his pursuit of train robber Bruce Dern, whose capture will assure a successful election. Douglas' lawman also travels with a photographer, who makes the most of every photo op, such as his early capture of outlaw Dern.As this was made in 1975, it's very much a post-Watergate film. And as such, it's still quite relevant today. For example, when Douglas makes his big speech to the town after capturing Dern, invoking God & goodness & appealing to the pre-programmed traditional beliefs of the townspeople, you realize that by changing just one word in that speech -- by substituting ""terrorists"" for ""criminals"" -- it's the same empty rah-rah speech we hear so often today.However, Dern doesn't want to hang, and he definitely doesn't want to be used as an election prop. I won't give away what happens next, but it's quite satisfying. The film also stars James Stacy, who had recently lost an arm & a leg in a horrendous motorcycle accident, as the town's newspaper man, wary of Douglas & of any ambitious politico. He obviously represented Vietnam vets at the time; now he'd just as easily represent maimed veterans returning from Iraq, or any war, sacrificed for the personal ambitions of a smarmy would-be leader.The performances are excellent, and even the minor background characters are given fine moments of characterization. The dawning realization of some of the townspeople that they are being used is played for sadness rather than easy mockery, as they understand that they've agreed to their use (and abuse).
