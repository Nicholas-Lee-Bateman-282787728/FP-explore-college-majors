This tape combines the best of both! I really like how there is another view shown during some of the positions so you have a better idea if you are doing it correctly.,5,The perfect blend of Yoga and Pilates!,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,284,"['have', 'few', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'alternate', 'using', 'love', 'always', 'feel', 'need', 'more', 'Ab', 'workout', 'tape', 'best', 'really', 'how', 'view', 'shown', 'positions', 'have', 'better', 'idea', 'are', 'doing', 'correctly']",Yogilates Intermediate Workout: Level Two
704951,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000068MOR,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[0, 0]","Yogilates is a blend of yoga and Pilates, and in Workout 2, instructor Jonathon Urla leads an intermediate-level class. The practice is broken into three sections, thus allowing you to customize your workout. The first 12-minute segment focuses mainly on stretches from a seated position to warm up the body. In the second segment, you'll start immediate with a shoulderstand/plow series and then move right into the Pilates rollover, which was a nice flow. You'll continue with additional Pilates-inspired abs work and then do some additional core work from an all-fours position; this entire segment lasted about 17 minutes. The third segment was the longest at 29 minutes. After some opening stretches, you'll move into a sun salutation series from yoga, gradually adding in additional poses such as lunges and the warrior series. The total time for the workout is 54 minutes.Overall, I \enjoyed this hybrid practice, although I found it to be more yoga-focused than Pilates (I would have liked a bit more Pilates matwork). Jonathon Urla cues well and offers very good form pointers throughout the workout; he has a very encouraging, calming, and relaxing manner. This practice is probably most appropriate for those with some prior exposure to both yoga and Pilates (i.e., advanced beginners or lower intermediates) and who are interested in combining the two disciplines in a seamless flow.",4,Very good blend of yoga and Pilates at an intermediate level,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,1395,"['Yogilates', 'blend', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'Workout', '2', 'instructor', 'Jonathon', 'Urla', 'intermediate-level', 'class', 'practice', 'broken', 'three', 'sections', 'thus', 'allowing', 'customize', 'workout', 'first', '12-minute', 'segment', 'mainly', 'stretches', 'seated', 'position', 'warm', 'up', 'body', 'second', 'segment', ""'ll"", 'start', 'immediate', 'shoulderstand/plow', 'series', 'then', 'move', 'right', 'Pilates', 'rollover', 'was', 'nice', 'flow', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'additional', 'Pilates-inspired', 'abs', 'work', 'then', 'do', 'additional', 'core', 'work', 'all-fours', 'position', 'entire', 'segment', 'lasted', '17', 'minutes', 'third', 'segment', 'was', 'longest', '29', 'minutes', 'opening', 'stretches', ""'ll"", 'move', 'sun', 'salutation', 'series', 'yoga', 'gradually', 'adding', 'additional', 'poses', 'such', 'lunges', 'warrior', 'series', 'total', 'time', 'workout', '54', 'minutes.Overall', '\\enjoyed', 'hybrid', 'practice', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'yoga-focused', 'Pilates', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'bit', 'more', 'Pilates', 'matwork', 'Jonathon', 'Urla', 'cues', 'well', 'very', 'good', 'form', 'pointers', 'workout', 'very', 'encouraging', 'calming', 'relaxing', 'manner', 'practice', 'probably', 'most', 'appropriate', 'prior', 'exposure', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'i.e.', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'lower', 'intermediates', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'combining', 'two', 'disciplines', 'seamless', 'flow']",Yogilates Intermediate Workout: Level Two

With over 95 Yoga programs (and a growing number of  Pilates programs) I have a good feel for what is available in terms of this genre of media.I just did this program this morning and it is a definite keeper!Though it's the intermediate Yogilates program I found it to be very doable, just challenging enough without being a struggle. I felt great afterwards, very open but not at all depleted, in fact I felt quite energized!Like Yogilates 1 there are three sections to it which breaks the workup into logical sections. This makes it very managible and gives you an opportunity to pause the program if you need a little extra time between sections.This program is unique in it's sequence compared to most other Yoga based programs, especially with the Sun Salutes coming in the third section. You are gently yet thoroughly warmed up by the previous sections so it makes the Sun Salutes (which are usually treated as warm up) a very different experience. After the Sun Salutes you continue with a more intense Yoga section of Standing poses and the like which eventually winds down and ends in Savasana (relaxation pose)I also (as mentioned by another reviewer) like the extra view that is shown for the poses throughout the program. It definitely  makes it much easier to be sure you are doing things correctly.For someone looking for a nice and flowing integration of Pilates and Yoga I would highly recommend this program!Namaste",5,Yogilates 2  w/ Jonathan Urla : A Definite Keeper!,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,1551,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Yoga', 'daily', '9', 'years', 'have', 'added', 'Pilates', 'daily', 'practice', 'last', 'several', 'months', 'now', '95', 'Yoga', 'programs', 'growing', 'number', 'Pilates', 'programs', 'have', 'good', 'feel', 'what', 'available', 'terms', 'genre', 'media.I', 'just', 'did', 'program', 'morning', 'definite', 'keeper', 'intermediate', 'program', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'doable', 'just', 'challenging', 'enough', 'being', 'struggle', 'felt', 'great', 'afterwards', 'very', 'open', 'not', 'depleted', 'fact', 'felt', 'quite', 'energized', '1', 'are', 'three', 'sections', 'workup', 'logical', 'sections', 'very', 'managible', 'opportunity', 'pause', 'program', 'need', 'little', 'extra', 'time', 'sections.This', 'program', 'unique', 'sequence', 'compared', 'most', 'other', 'Yoga', 'based', 'programs', 'especially', 'Sun', 'Salutes', 'coming', 'third', 'section', 'are', 'gently', 'yet', 'thoroughly', 'warmed', 'up', 'previous', 'sections', 'Sun', 'Salutes', 'are', 'usually', 'treated', 'warm', 'up', 'very', 'different', 'experience', 'Sun', 'Salutes', 'continue', 'more', 'intense', 'Yoga', 'section', 'Standing', 'poses', 'like', 'eventually', 'down', 'Savasana', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'also', 'mentioned', 'reviewer', 'extra', 'view', 'shown', 'poses', 'program', 'definitely', 'much', 'easier', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'doing', 'things', 'correctly.For', 'someone', 'looking', 'nice', 'flowing', 'integration', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'program', 'Namaste']",Yogilates Intermediate Workout: Level Two

I just wish it was a little longer, to make it a 60 minute workout. My dvd, too, has a few seconds of voice distortion, like echoing; but it's not so bad that I can't work through it. When my lower back is hurting, this is the dvd I use to ease the pain/stiffness and it works.

704954,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000068MOR,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[0, 0]","Yogilates is a combination of Hatha Yoga and Pilates. Jonathan Urla created this workout for intermediate students. Five minutes into the exercises and you can feel your core working. The picture-in-picture feature is helpful so you can see the view from the front and side simultaneously. The Pilates exercises strengthen and tone the entire body while the Yoga postures also clear the mind.The exercises are divided into three sections. In the first segment you start in a seated position and then go right into spinal twists and a moving Boat pose. Roll Ups and Leg Circles are followed by Half Lotus posture.The second segment begins with a fairly difficult Straddle Stretch and Shoulder Stand. This is followed by Bridge (with leg extensions), Cobbler's Pose and Cat/Cow.By the time you get to the third section you may feel invigorated and up for more challenges. Torso Swings get the body moving faster and this wakes the body up for the sun salutations (Plank, Cobra, Downward Facing Dog). This is followed by Chair (with a twist), Warrior 1 and 2, Camel, Pigeon and Fish. The exercises end with a Final Relaxation Pose.Overall I felt like I had a good full-body workout with enough challenges to keep me focuses and alert. I can recommend this to anyone who feels they are at the intermediate level, although two of the exercises in the second segment seemed more advanced.~The Rebecca Review",4,Invigorating and Healing,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,1401,"['Yogilates', 'combination', 'Hatha', 'Yoga', 'Pilates', 'Jonathan', 'Urla', 'created', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'students', 'Five', 'minutes', 'exercises', 'can', 'feel', 'core', 'working', 'picture-in-picture', 'feature', 'helpful', 'can', 'see', 'view', 'front', 'side', 'simultaneously', 'Pilates', 'exercises', 'strengthen', 'tone', 'entire', 'body', 'Yoga', 'postures', 'also', 'clear', 'mind.The', 'exercises', 'are', 'divided', 'three', 'sections', 'first', 'segment', 'start', 'seated', 'position', 'then', 'go', 'right', 'spinal', 'twists', 'moving', 'Boat', 'pose', 'Roll', 'Ups', 'Leg', 'Circles', 'are', 'followed', 'Half', 'Lotus', 'posture.The', 'second', 'segment', 'fairly', 'difficult', 'Straddle', 'Stretch', 'Shoulder', 'Stand', 'followed', 'Bridge', 'leg', 'extensions', 'Cobbler', 'Pose', 'Cat/Cow.By', 'time', 'get', 'third', 'section', 'may', 'feel', 'invigorated', 'up', 'more', 'challenges', 'Torso', 'Swings', 'get', 'body', 'moving', 'faster', 'body', 'up', 'sun', 'salutations', 'Plank', 'Cobra', 'Downward', 'Facing', 'Dog', 'followed', 'Chair', 'twist', 'Warrior', '1', '2', 'Camel', 'Pigeon', 'Fish', 'exercises', 'end', 'Final', 'Relaxation', 'Pose.Overall', 'felt', 'had', 'good', 'full-body', 'workout', 'enough', 'challenges', 'keep', 'focuses', 'alert', 'can', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'are', 'intermediate', 'level', 'two', 'exercises', 'second', 'segment', 'seemed', 'more', 'advanced.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Yogilates Intermediate Workout: Level Two
