964113,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000E0LLKO,Clare Quilty,"[21, 34]","The central plot of ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" is an age-old scenario: A talented kid with a dream tries to break into show business.Will novice rapper Marcus (portrayed by seasoned rapper Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) eventually get to stand in the lights, bust his rhymes and bask in the reply of applause?Maybe. And if you can completely ignore the fact that, for much of the movie, we mostly see him earn his fortune by flooding his city with crack cocaine, and dispatching his enemies with close-range gunfire, then you might actually enjoy watching his climb up the entertainment ladder.But if you can't get around those troubling character flaws . . . you're in for a long movie.Imagine ""Scarface,"" for example, if Tony Montana occasionally locked himself away to tap out pages of his autobiography; or ""Superfly"" if Ron O'Neal took singing lessons on the side in preparation for an audition at Carnegie Hall.At the story's start, orphan Marcus rejects his grandparents' guidance, hits the streets and prospers in the drug trade in the late '80s.He earns stacks of cash, finds a good woman (Joy Bryant), dabbles in armed robbery and broods about the man he believes killed his mother.The suspected killer, as it happens, is a dead ringer for the ""Superfreak""-era Rick James. The resemblance is so close, in fact, that Marcus bitterly takes to carrying around a photograph of the real Rick James, to stoke the fires of his anger.The Rick James photo is a plot point that might fit nicely into an episode of ""Arrested Development,"" but here, in the context of a drama, it feels hilariously silly.""Do you like Rick James?"" Marcus' girlfriend asks after spotting the photo on a dartboard; ""No,"" he replies.Eventually, stints in prison persuade Marcus to try his hand at rapping, and his ambition is reinforced when he is shot nine times by a rival, but survives (that he sees the MTV logo as his life passes before his eyes would seem like a snide touch... if this film weren't an MTV Production).In real life Jackson, too, took nine bullets and lived to tell about it. Surprisingly, though, this version of the events isn't very interesting or coherent: Character introductions are vague; the gangster politics are hazily sketched and the story is rambling and, at two-and-a-quarter hours, overlong.As a musician-turned-actor, Jackson has some charisma but is a little stiff and awfully mumbly (which is kind of understandable since, in real life, one of those nine bullets did go into his mouth).Fortunately, the cast includes Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (the gifted British actor who played Adebisi on ""Oz"" and now plays Mr. Eko on ""Lost"") as a steely-eyed, sword-cane swinging gang leader and also Terrence Howard, who's great as Marcus' hot-headed manager.Good as he is, though, Howard's presence here kind of works against the movie. He was the star of July's ""Hustle and Flow,"" an infinitely better film with a similar plot. In ""Hustle,"" Howard's wannabe rapper wasn't a privileged thug trying to get rich or die trying; he was just a hard luck guy trying to make some good music before he ran out of time. ""Get Rich"" could've benefited by considering such a constructive urge.",2,"""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" isn't just the terrible title of a bad movie, it's also a perfect moron motto for 2005",1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,3178,"['central', 'plot', 'Get', 'Rich', 'Die', 'Tryin', 'age-old', 'scenario', 'talented', 'kid', 'dream', 'break', 'show', 'business.Will', 'novice', 'rapper', 'Marcus', 'portrayed', 'seasoned', 'rapper', 'Curtis', '50', 'Cent', 'Jackson', 'eventually', 'get', 'stand', 'lights', 'bust', 'rhymes', 'bask', 'reply', 'applause', 'Maybe', 'can', 'completely', 'ignore', 'fact', 'much', 'movie', 'mostly', 'see', 'earn', 'fortune', 'flooding', 'city', 'crack', 'cocaine', 'dispatching', 'enemies', 'close-range', 'gunfire', 'then', 'might', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'climb', 'up', 'entertainment', 'ladder.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'troubling', 'character', 'flaws', ""'re"", 'long', 'movie.Imagine', 'Scarface', 'example', 'Tony', 'Montana', 'occasionally', 'locked', 'away', 'tap', 'out', 'pages', 'autobiography', 'Superfly', 'Ron', ""O'Neal"", 'took', 'singing', 'lessons', 'side', 'preparation', 'audition', 'Carnegie', 'Hall.At', 'story', 'start', 'orphan', 'Marcus', 'grandparents', 'guidance', 'streets', 'prospers', 'drug', 'trade', 'late', ""'80s.He"", 'stacks', 'cash', 'good', 'woman', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'armed', 'robbery', 'broods', 'man', 'killed', 'mother.The', 'suspected', 'killer', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Superfreak', '-era', 'Rick', 'James', 'resemblance', 'so', 'close', 'fact', 'Marcus', 'bitterly', 'carrying', 'around', 'photograph', 'real', 'Rick', 'James', 'stoke', 'fires', 'anger.The', 'Rick', 'James', 'photo', 'plot', 'point', 'might', 'fit', 'nicely', 'episode', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'here', 'context', 'drama', 'hilariously', 'silly', 'Do', 'Rick', 'James', 'Marcus', 'girlfriend', 'asks', 'spotting', 'photo', 'dartboard', 'No', 'replies.Eventually', 'stints', 'prison', 'persuade', 'Marcus', 'try', 'hand', 'rapping', 'ambition', 'reinforced', 'when', 'shot', 'nine', 'times', 'rival', 'MTV', 'logo', 'life', 'passes', 'eyes', 'would', 'seem', 'snide', 'touch', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'MTV', 'Production', '.In', 'real', 'life', 'Jackson', 'too', 'took', 'nine', 'bullets', 'lived', 'tell', 'Surprisingly', 'though', 'version', 'events', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'coherent', 'Character', 'introductions', 'are', 'vague', 'gangster', 'politics', 'are', 'hazily', 'sketched', 'story', 'rambling', 'two-and-a-quarter', 'hours', 'musician-turned-actor', 'Jackson', 'charisma', 'little', 'stiff', 'awfully', 'mumbly', 'kind', 'understandable', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'nine', 'bullets', 'did', 'go', 'mouth', '.Fortunately', 'cast', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'gifted', 'British', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Adebisi', 'Oz', 'now', 'Mr.', 'Eko', 'Lost', 'steely-eyed', 'sword-cane', 'swinging', 'gang', 'leader', 'also', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'who', 'great', 'Marcus', 'hot-headed', 'manager.Good', 'though', 'Howard', 'presence', 'here', 'kind', 'works', 'movie', 'was', 'star', 'July', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'infinitely', 'better', 'film', 'similar', 'plot', 'Hustle', 'Howard', 'wannabe', 'rapper', 'was', ""n't"", 'privileged', 'thug', 'trying', 'get', 'rich', 'die', 'trying', 'was', 'just', 'hard', 'luck', 'guy', 'trying', 'make', 'good', 'music', 'ran', 'time', 'Get', 'Rich', 'could', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'considering', 'such', 'constructive', 'urge']",N/A

964115,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000E0LLKO,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[3, 7]","Thanks to his colossal debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin' and commercial omnipresence, everyone knows the saga of 50 Cent. The real challenge of his Get Rich or Die Tryin' (MTV Films/Paramount) film is to weave humanity into ""Fiddy's"" mythical journey from small time hustler to bullet-riddled superstar. Despite the assistance of celebrated director Jim Sheridan, a winner of two Academy Awards, and a talented supporting cast, Curtis Jackson the man fails to come through on screen, leaving the audience with what amounts to a feature length music video.Marcus, 50's film alter ego, is left orphaned after his drug dealing but glamorously feminine mother is brutally murdered in their small apartment (there are no traces of the hardcore lesbian mom that the rapper candidly portrayed to the media.) Forced to move in with his grandparents, the youngster's rebellion and anger is palpable. Actor Marcus John Jeffries's portrayal of young Marcus renders the character real in a way that 50 never does.As Marcus, the only emotion that 50 can convincingly convey is anger, anger at his grandparents, at his crew and at the world. When Marcus's brash street antics land him in jail and eventually in solitary confinement after a brutal shower fight scene, a guard tosses him a razor blade, delivering the implicit message that Marcus should kill himself. Never does 50's performance ever illuminate the tumultuous emotions that his character should be feeling in the hole, even with him narrating. There is no moment of heart racing fear that Marcus might actually be contemplating suicide-only the certainty that his character has the brute strength necessary to overcome anything.Everything comes easy to Marcus, even in the midst of his struggle to change his life from gangster to rapper. He easily wins his girl Charlene, played by Joy Bryant, who seems too good for Marcus despite his street success and their childhood friendship. Charlene's unquestionable loyalty and almost conflict free acceptance of his lifestyle isn't realistic, particularly because she's managed to escape the hood's desperation. Bryant's Charlene is way too smart to remain with such a thug-even if the sexual chemistry is crazy.Marcus is virtually untouchable as the film's hustling hero. He robs a high level rival drug organization with no repercussions and is basically left to his own devices after an attempt by his former affiliates to kill him goes awry. Though he relied on drug money as his sole source of income, after he goes straight, we never see him struggle to pay for anything from studio time to pamper money. Even his post-shoot out blacklisting at record companies seems inconsequential; 50 and his crew simply decide to start dropping mixtapes. Young Caesar (Marcus's rap moniker) is then immediately embraced by the streets. When the film draws to a close and Young Caesar/50 Cent the legend is born, nothing seems extraordinary about his rise to fame except its predictability.",2,50 Cent ----- Get Rich or Die Tryin' (DVD),1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,2980,"['Thanks', 'colossal', 'debut', 'Get', 'Rich', 'Die', 'Tryin', 'commercial', 'omnipresence', 'everyone', 'saga', '50', 'Cent', 'real', 'challenge', 'Get', 'Rich', 'Die', 'Tryin', 'MTV', 'Films/Paramount', 'film', 'weave', 'humanity', 'Fiddy', 'mythical', 'journey', 'small', 'time', 'hustler', 'bullet-riddled', 'superstar', 'assistance', 'celebrated', 'director', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'winner', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'talented', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Curtis', 'Jackson', 'man', 'come', 'screen', 'leaving', 'audience', 'what', 'amounts', 'feature', 'length', 'music', 'video.Marcus', '50', 'film', 'alter', 'ego', 'left', 'orphaned', 'drug', 'dealing', 'glamorously', 'feminine', 'mother', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'small', 'apartment', 'are', 'traces', 'hardcore', 'lesbian', 'mom', 'rapper', 'candidly', 'portrayed', 'media', 'Forced', 'move', 'grandparents', 'youngster', 'rebellion', 'anger', 'palpable', 'Actor', 'Marcus', 'John', 'Jeffries', 'portrayal', 'young', 'Marcus', 'character', 'real', 'way', '50', 'never', 'does.As', 'Marcus', 'only', 'emotion', '50', 'can', 'convincingly', 'convey', 'anger', 'anger', 'grandparents', 'crew', 'world', 'When', 'Marcus', 'brash', 'street', 'antics', 'land', 'jail', 'eventually', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'brutal', 'shower', 'fight', 'scene', 'guard', 'razor', 'blade', 'delivering', 'implicit', 'message', 'Marcus', 'should', 'kill', 'Never', '50', 'performance', 'ever', 'illuminate', 'tumultuous', 'emotions', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'hole', 'even', 'narrating', 'moment', 'heart', 'racing', 'fear', 'Marcus', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'contemplating', 'suicide-only', 'certainty', 'character', 'brute', 'strength', 'necessary', 'overcome', 'anything.Everything', 'easy', 'Marcus', 'even', 'midst', 'struggle', 'change', 'life', 'gangster', 'rapper', 'easily', 'girl', 'Charlene', 'played', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'who', 'too', 'good', 'Marcus', 'street', 'success', 'childhood', 'friendship', 'Charlene', 'unquestionable', 'loyalty', 'almost', 'conflict', 'free', 'acceptance', 'lifestyle', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'particularly', 'managed', 'escape', 'hood', 'desperation', 'Bryant', 'Charlene', 'way', 'too', 'smart', 'remain', 'such', 'thug-even', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'crazy.Marcus', 'virtually', 'untouchable', 'film', 'hustling', 'hero', 'high', 'level', 'rival', 'drug', 'organization', 'repercussions', 'basically', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'attempt', 'former', 'affiliates', 'kill', 'awry', 'relied', 'drug', 'money', 'sole', 'source', 'income', 'straight', 'never', 'see', 'struggle', 'pay', 'anything', 'studio', 'time', 'pamper', 'money', 'Even', 'post-shoot', 'blacklisting', 'record', 'companies', 'inconsequential', '50', 'crew', 'simply', 'decide', 'start', 'dropping', 'mixtapes', 'Young', 'Caesar', 'Marcus', 'rap', 'moniker', 'then', 'immediately', 'embraced', 'streets', 'When', 'film', 'close', 'Young', 'Caesar/50', 'Cent', 'legend', 'born', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'rise', 'fame', 'predictability']",N/A

Other than that it was up to the Mr. Sheridan to make a useable script. Growing up in the harsh lifestyle of inner city drugs and gang violence gives you more credibility with the hip hop rap music genre. The rags-to-riches story gives situational relationships hope.Terrence Howard (Bama), Joy Bryant (Charlene) and Adewale Akinnuoye-Aqbaje (Majestic) are the most notable experienced actors that give this film some spark.This film is an okay rental.

Considering he is not an actor I think he did well in this film, and before giving ratings on this film, you need to remember he isn't an actor and some of the events in this film is based on his life. It's not as bad as people say it is, don't get me wrong it isn't amazing it could be better but it absolutely does not deserve one star. The rest of the supporting cast did a pretty good job. Terrence Howard (""Hustle & Flow"",) had supplied the comic relief and obviously out shined 50 due to the fact Terrence is a true actor.The film starts of with what seems to be a nice young lad enjoying his life with his mother until its turned up side down and he follows the same route that he has unfortunately been subjected to in his life, the fact that he turns that life around to make something of himself is what makes the film and has made his the big success he is today.50 cent has done a lot in this film that most Rap Actors wouldn't do for example: like crying, a sex scene and a shower scene. You can tell he really tried his best on this film and I feel that he has managed to pull it off. I think the reason most people who say they don't like this film just say it because they don't like 50, as a person most people are jealous because he came up so fast but you can like it or hate and the fact 50 has shone some talent on the big screen. There are a few bits through out this film that could of been better.If you are considering on purchasing this film you don't have to be a huge ""rap fanatic"" to watch and understand this it without hating it, again it's not the best film I've ever seen but it's certainly worth watching.",3,You can tell he tried his best on this film.,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,1741,"['watched', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'open', 'mind', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'reasonable', 'film', 'Considering', 'not', 'actor', 'think', 'did', 'well', 'film', 'giving', 'ratings', 'film', 'need', 'remember', ""n't"", 'actor', 'events', 'film', 'based', 'life', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'absolutely', 'not', 'deserve', 'one', 'star', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'had', 'supplied', 'comic', 'relief', 'obviously', 'out', 'shined', '50', 'due', 'fact', 'Terrence', 'true', 'actor.The', 'film', 'starts', 'what', 'be', 'nice', 'young', 'lad', 'enjoying', 'life', 'mother', 'turned', 'up', 'side', 'down', 'same', 'route', 'unfortunately', 'been', 'subjected', 'life', 'fact', 'life', 'make', 'something', 'what', 'film', 'made', 'big', 'success', 'today.50', 'cent', 'done', 'lot', 'film', 'most', 'Rap', 'Actors', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'example', 'crying', 'sex', 'scene', 'shower', 'scene', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'tried', 'best', 'film', 'feel', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'think', 'reason', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'just', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', '50', 'person', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'jealous', 'came', 'up', 'so', 'fast', 'can', 'like', 'hate', 'fact', '50', 'shone', 'talent', 'big', 'screen', 'are', 'few', 'bits', 'film', 'could', 'been', 'are', 'considering', 'purchasing', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'huge', 'rap', 'fanatic', 'watch', 'understand', 'hating', 'again', 'not', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

But, I did like Eminem's ""8 Mile"" so I gave this movie a chance. It's got the same formula basically...Multi-platinum rap star stars in a fictionalized version of his life story, with an uplifting message, and an odd director. ""8 Mile"" was directed by Curtis Hanson (who has directed L.A. Confidential and In Her Shoes), this film is directed by Jim Sheridan who (in the past) has is Irish and white. You may remember Sheridan as the director of ""In America."" Anyway, it's hard to say what movie is better; ""8 Mile"" or this, both films are very different...Both films feature surprisingly superb performances. Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent plays Marcus. We meet Marcus as he and his crew rob a small store; They all escape, but Marcus is subsequently shot on his way back home. The film jumps backwards as we see Marcus grow up with his loving mother, who happens to be a drug dealer, who ends up being killed. Marcus is sent to live with his grandmother, but ends up dealing drugs under the watchful eye of Majestic (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaie). But Majestic is just small time compared to Levar (Bill Duke, who looks like a black mobster), who apparently runs everything. Anyway as Marcus grows up he forms his crew, consisting of Karyl (Omar Benson Miller, who was part of Eminem's crew in 8 Mile), Justice (Tory Kittles), and Antwan (Ashley Walters). But, putting aside the drug dealing and everything; there's gotta be a love interest which comes in the form of a childhood girlfriend named Charlene (Joy Bryant, ""London""). When Marcus ends up getting arrested, his life is saved in jail by Bama (Oscar nominee Terrence Howard, Best Actor ""Hustle & Flow"") who becomes a friend of his and ends up joining the crew.Roger Ebert said this film was ""A film with rich and convincing texture, a drama with power & anger."" That pretty much sums it up, but it's not cheap movie anger. 50 Cent is a gifted actor, you can see the pain in his face and in his eyes. Terrence Howard, as Bama, proves he's one of the finest actors around yet again. This guy holds your attention to the screen. Even if you don't like rap or you do like rap and don't like 50 Cent; This is a powerful, honest, and very entertaining movie.GRADE: A",5,Entertaining,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,2302,"[""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', '50', 'Cent', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'particularly', 'big', 'fan', 'rap', 'did', 'Eminem', '8', 'Mile', 'gave', 'movie', 'chance', 'got', 'same', 'formula', 'basically', 'Multi-platinum', 'rap', 'star', 'stars', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'life', 'story', 'uplifting', 'message', 'odd', 'director', '8', 'Mile', 'was', 'directed', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'who', 'directed', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'film', 'directed', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'who', 'past', 'Irish', 'white', 'may', 'remember', 'Sheridan', 'director', 'America', 'Anyway', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'movie', 'better', '8', 'Mile', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'feature', 'surprisingly', 'superb', 'performances', 'Curtis', 'Jackson', 'better', 'known', '50', 'Cent', 'plays', 'Marcus', 'meet', 'Marcus', 'crew', 'small', 'store', 'escape', 'Marcus', 'subsequently', 'shot', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'film', 'backwards', 'see', 'Marcus', 'grow', 'up', 'loving', 'mother', 'who', 'be', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'killed', 'Marcus', 'sent', 'live', 'grandmother', 'up', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'watchful', 'eye', 'Majestic', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaie', 'Majestic', 'just', 'small', 'time', 'compared', 'Levar', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'who', 'black', 'mobster', 'who', 'apparently', 'everything', 'Anyway', 'Marcus', 'up', 'crew', 'consisting', 'Karyl', 'Omar', 'Benson', 'Miller', 'who', 'was', 'part', 'Eminem', 'crew', '8', 'Mile', 'Justice', 'Tory', 'Kittles', 'Antwan', 'Ashley', 'Walters', 'putting', 'aside', 'drug', 'dealing', 'everything', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'love', 'interest', 'form', 'childhood', 'girlfriend', 'named', 'Charlene', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'London', 'When', 'Marcus', 'up', 'getting', 'arrested', 'life', 'saved', 'jail', 'Bama', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'who', 'friend', 'up', 'joining', 'crew.Roger', 'Ebert', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'A', 'film', 'rich', 'convincing', 'texture', 'drama', 'power', 'anger', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'not', 'cheap', 'movie', 'anger', '50', 'Cent', 'gifted', 'actor', 'can', 'see', 'pain', 'face', 'eyes', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Bama', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'around', 'yet', 'again', 'guy', 'attention', 'screen', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'rap', 'do', 'rap', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', '50', 'Cent', 'powerful', 'honest', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie.GRADE']",N/A

It started out cool with a good scene in the begining which lead to him being shot. I thought that they set up the story very well starting when he was a child. I could not imagin how it would be to not have a father and than have your mother raped and killed when you were only 12 years old. He did do alot of bad stuff in his life but for me i cant blam him i have never been in that situation and it is inspirational the way he oevrcame all those things and still was succesful. There were some spots with some action were someone got shot and you would root for them to get shot back. The thing is he got shot 9 times and still lived. Most people after getting shot 9 times would have given up on life but he fought through it and decided to turn his life around and work on his music. Prison it looked like helped him alot. Just being able to think that he is the most succesfull rap artist selling records wise weather you hate him or love him he is good at selling cd's.

Everybody is bashing 50 Cent but very little of these rants posing as reviews actually speak about the actual movie. Let's get one thing straight. If you hate 50 so much that you cant even write a partial review on this movie don't review it. Im not fond of 50 as a rapper and as a person but that is a lousy reason to give this movie bad reviews.Get Rich Or Die Trying is loosely based on the life of Curtis Jackson and based on that reason its pretty good. 50 plays himself and there are good performances from Terrance Howard as well as Joy Bryant who plays Charlene, Marcus's girlfriend in the movie. Bill Duke is pretty good as Levar the boss of the organization Marcus links up with. Adewale Akinnouye Agbaje is excellent as the ruthless Majestic. The movie covers Marcus childhood as well is how he became to be a rapper. One might question the authenticity of the story being told in this movie(this being the movie's real flaw) but as far as entertainment goes I enjoyed myself.Its a shame when people allow the hapless trendies that run amok on Amazon, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes dictate to you what qualifies as quality movies. These weirdos think that defending awful movies that were rightfully panned like Freddy Got Fingered, Nothing But Trouble, Batman and Robin, The Musketeer and The Black Dahlia makes them hip and cool and not pathetic posers in dire need of a life. And as far as acting goes the last time I checked  Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Leonardo Dicaprio, Brad ""Musty Arm"" Pitt(overrated beyond belief), Casper Van Diem,  Chuck Norris were not real actors! To all of you reasonable people out there do not allow the circus freaks on Amazon, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes to tell you what counts for good cinema because you will be disappointed every time. There are a lot of great movies that never made the Top 250 or gotten Fresh Tomatoes. Just goes to show you the bandwagon mentality of these pseudo intellectual rodents.

So a lot of questions come about when considering whether to even give this movie the time of day.Is this some movie about some fake thug dude trying to look cool and glorify himself? or is about more than all that stuff, stuff we see common place with the likes of ""rappers"" like lil wayne and other b.s.Well, i watched all of it, and it actually was a well done, likable, honest, heart felt movie. Its like the guys behind making this really took this project seriously, and delivered a movie you'd wanna own and watch again.50's story, if you dont know it totally, is worth learning about, it will open your eyes a bit to who he is and where he came from. From a little boy, to rising rap star. A lot goes on in the movie. And though it wasnt as long as i would of liked, it went a long at a decent pace, though some events didnt take long to show the viewer, it didnt seemed rushed or anything.50's acting gets the job done. I didnt think he was trying to act too hard or anything and the supporting cast really did a decent job, like Terrence Howard, who plays a friend of 50.Its not a great great film. But for a movie like this about a 'thug', a rapper, it really did a good job. Probubly one of the best in this genre ive seen. And it has some memorable qualities about it aswell. Which i really didnt expect.There is an emotional aspect in this film too, that really makes you care about the character, and that i didnt expect above all. So i think this movie is worth watching.

964142,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000E0LLKO,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[6, 11]","I read the 7 reviews posted and what these 7 failed to understand is that #1  50 isn't bragging about being shot nine times--he's telling the truth, #2  You don't have to be a 50 Cent fan to appreciate a man telling his biographical story (Note: I'm not a 50 Cent fan), #3 The movie doesn't concentrate on hip-hop music in the same way that Eight Mile did.I'm not a fan of 50 Cent because of the whole childish pranks with ""If I don't like him, you can't either"" and the Game scenario, his snide remarks about R. Kelly/Kanye West/The Game, and his constant need for negative attention.  I had no intentions of going to see this movie, but I got it as a birthday gift so I figured I might as well watch it.  I actually spent a lot of time rewinding parts because they were so interesting.  I liked Terrance Howards ""I'm right"" logic, watching 50 Cent being sensitive/caring towards a woman was awkwardly comforting, and watching his relationship with his mother was intriguing.The movie is nothing like Eight Mile because although there are a few references to his rapping dreams, it relies on the backstory of his life (before he became a rap star.)  There are no freestyle battles, no challenges at the mike, and no rapping during lunch breaks.  There is a woman of interest, and surprisingly, the woman is so absolutely respectful I'm confused as to why they're not together today.  I love to watch a man and his son--so I thought it was cute to see him play with a child several times in the movie.  I don't quite understand how this works considering he got on MTV and said he doesn't spend any time with his son--or maybe that was just during that time.Contrary to popular belief, the movie does not glorify gang/drug life.  There was a part in the movie when 50 Cent actually argued with a team member on killing people, he made a decision for music over drugs, and actually used his time constructively in jail.  From the previews, it looks like a gang movie filled with sex, guns, and violence, but there's actually a useful theme involved.  There are quite a few scenes that explain to me why he is so angry/paranoid today.Regardless of whether you like him or not, I still believe it's a really good movie.  I attended a writer's conference where Rita Whack, apparently a pretty good journalist from what I heard, downed 50 Cent a couple times during her presentation.  I was first thrown off that she had such distaste for the man and then annoyed that she kept bringing it up when we were supposed to be talking about writing for the African-American audience. The more she downed him, the more heated I got.  Her logic was that she can't respect someone who sold crack and ""portrays women negatively""--but I feel that you can not judge someone solely on their past.  To not like him for that reason is to not like Jay-Z, who was also a crack dealer, but gave half a million dollars to the Hurricane Katrina fund.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[3, 6]","In recent years, Hollywood saw an emerging generation of actors particularly from the hip-hop world.Eminem made a lasting impression with 8 Mile, Dr. Dre made a flashing appearance in Training Day, and Snoop Dogg has made several movies including Bones and Soul Plane (both flopped). With the rise of a star in the hip-hop world these days, there seems to be a trend of have-to-make-a-movie-next. 50 Cent, who I honestly and without bias don't understand the hype that surrounds him, fails to leave any sort of impression in this film about his life in the streets, near death incident, and rise to fame. Where Eminem succeeded in engaging the audience with his life in the down under and how he crossed the line to public adoration and respect after a climactic rap battle, Fiddy just doesn't reach a climax nor attract cheers.The movie starts by showing 50 getting shot about 10 times leaving him for dead, but only to be saved at the last minute by paramedics. Travel back in time, 50 is raised by a drug dealing mother who gets killed in front of his eyes. He's brought up by his relatives. Slowly, the little boy becomes a drug dealer, looking for a way out through rap. Earlier this year, John Singleton explored this issue with the incredible Hustle And Flow starring Terrence Howard who appears in Get Rich as Marcus's, 50's character in the film, eccentric partner in crime. However, Howard's turn in and the movie Hustle And Flow outweighs this by way more than 50 million cents!All in all, Get Rich Or Die Trying, is not a great movie. It's not even a good movie. It's a movie I would classify as a special interest film. The only people I recommend this movie to are hip-hop lovers or 50 Cent fans.

Pete Postlethwaite, Emma Thompson, Djimon Hounsou, and Samantha Morton? Pretty impressive, isn't it? These actors, all undoubtedly talented, have received Oscar nomination for their roles in the films directed by Jim Sheridan, the guy who did 'My Left Foot,' and 'In the Name of the Father.'Now Jim Sheridan, for the reasons I don't know, decided to shoot a film based on the real-life tale of a rapper named 50 Cent. And instead of using the first-rate cast like Denzel Washington or Samuel L. Jackson, Sheridan decided on casting 50 Cent, or Curtis Jackson himself as the title role of Marcus, a drug dealer who later becomes a rapper. Perhaps Sheridan thought he could at least draw out the best thing that is in this rapper, or could show some unique perspective on the life of inner city by using him. And you know, sometimes rappers turn out very good actors like Ice Cube or Andre Benjamin.Whatever his motive might be, the result 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'' became a terrible film that would be easily a career killer for lesser known directors. Probably Sheridan will survive this mess that looks multiple car-pileups, but not 50 Cent who has no charisma, let alone the acting skill that is needed to make the character more interesting enough not to let us sleep in the theater. His rendition of the hero remains flat, lacking any emotional expression while he most needs it.But more irritating is the cliched script full of stereotyped characters and all-too-familiar plot devices. I am not talking about the material itself, which is worth telling here, but the way the insipid film is presented. As to the descriptions of the street-life, they did it better in the early 90s, for example, in the works such as 'Juice' (1992) 'Menace II Society' (93) and 'Fresh' (94), all gritty dramas. For all its biographical elements, 'Get Rich or Die Tryin' has nothing to add except for the good supporting acting from Terrence Howard ('Crash') and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (TV's 'Lost').I was very disappointed with the film, which illustrates one again that casting the right actor is always the key to a successful film.",2,Jim Sheridan's Least Successful Film with Dull Acting and Cliched Script,1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,2228,"['What', 'do', 'think', 'look', 'following', 'names', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Djimon', 'Hounsou', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Pretty', 'impressive', ""n't"", 'actors', 'undoubtedly', 'talented', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'roles', 'films', 'directed', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'guy', 'who', 'did', ""'My"", 'Left', 'Foot', 'Name', 'Father', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'decided', 'shoot', 'film', 'based', 'real-life', 'tale', 'rapper', 'named', '50', 'Cent', 'instead', 'using', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Sheridan', 'decided', 'casting', '50', 'Cent', 'Curtis', 'Jackson', 'title', 'role', 'Marcus', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'later', 'rapper', 'Perhaps', 'Sheridan', 'thought', 'could', 'least', 'draw', 'out', 'best', 'thing', 'rapper', 'could', 'show', 'unique', 'perspective', 'life', 'inner', 'city', 'using', 'know', 'rappers', 'turn', 'out', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'Andre', 'Benjamin.Whatever', 'motive', 'might', 'be', 'result', 'Rich', 'Die', 'Tryin', 'became', 'terrible', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'easily', 'career', 'killer', 'lesser', 'known', 'directors', 'Probably', 'Sheridan', 'will', 'survive', 'mess', 'multiple', 'car-pileups', 'not', '50', 'Cent', 'who', 'charisma', 'let', 'alone', 'acting', 'skill', 'needed', 'make', 'character', 'more', 'interesting', 'enough', 'not', 'let', 'sleep', 'theater', 'rendition', 'hero', 'flat', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'expression', 'most', 'needs', 'it.But', 'more', 'irritating', 'cliched', 'script', 'full', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'all-too-familiar', 'plot', 'devices', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'material', 'telling', 'here', 'way', 'insipid', 'film', 'presented', 'descriptions', 'street-life', 'did', 'better', 'early', '90s', 'example', 'works', 'such', ""'Juice"", '1992', 'II', 'Society', '93', '94', 'gritty', 'dramas', 'biographical', 'elements', 'Rich', 'Die', 'Tryin', 'nothing', 'add', 'good', 'supporting', 'acting', 'Terrence', 'Howard', ""'Crash"", 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'TV', ""'Lost"", '.I', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'film', 'one', 'again', 'casting', 'right', 'actor', 'always', 'key', 'successful', 'film']",N/A

The movie certainly looks very cheap, nothing spectacular, not even in the shootings.The story is predictable 50 cents' mother is killed when he is young, he gets tough, kind of wanting to avenge his mom, becomes a gangster, then a better gangster because his mentor gangster is good at this gangster-job.Predictably, 50 goes to jail, remembers his lost dream of being a rapper, though it was never clear that he wanted to be a rapper. of course he must fight his former crime buddies because no one can ""retire"" from crime, as we know from countless mafia movies.In the movie as in real life, 50 cent IS a speech impaired rapper, he just mumbles through his songs. This is addressed in the movie, and for fans this brings value to the film, we see 50 struggling with his own lack of clarity.There is a strange side-story in the movie that is not persued and does not add anything, which is sad, because it had real potential. In the movie, 50s mom is killed and until the end we don't know who did it, but it turns out that the two main suspects might also be 50s dad, and in the end it looks like his dad killed his mom, and there could have been some nice struggle in the possible dads over all this. In fact in connection with this side plot we have the movie's one ray of light: Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaie, who plays Majestic, the afformentioned good at gangsterism gangster. He is a superb actor, outclassing anything in the movie (including ""Bana"" played by the excellent actor from Hustle and Flow). If he was white he would be hailed as the next young Brando, he's that good. Sadly, trapped in this aweful movie he has to give terrible lines. His subtle struggle, not knowing if he is 50s dad, is drowned out, because one does not look for good acting a movie like this. I first noticed this actor in The Bourne Identity (the matt damon one), where he has a small role, but steals every scene he is in.I found the ending the worst part, because as 50 finally makes it onto stage, the winner, the hero, stepping into the limelight, he falls totally flat. just a muscle bound guy with no expression, and oddly no pressence, inspite of his bulked up, schwarzenegger body. Perhaps this total lack of pressence is part of his appeal.
