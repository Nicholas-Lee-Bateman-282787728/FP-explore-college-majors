From start to finish you get a stream of sexual innuendo, implied sex, the word f--k used more often than in most R movies, not very much good about it.Smallville's Kristin Kreuk has a short segment in the beginning- don't expect Lana Lang here- if this is the best movie role she can get her career is already over, Lucy Lawless is the Dutch operator of a sex shop- another career killer, Michelle Tractenberg had the best female role- I'll take Dawn Summers any day.This little gem managed to insult everything from British Soccer Hooligans (& that would take some doing although Vinnie Jones did a mostly reasonable job in his role), to nude beaches and gay men ( fat older nude men, the nude women were only topless but younger & in better shape), eastern Europe (the exchange rate is not THAT good, and the people are smarter than shown). I wouldn't have had the nerve to take on the Vatican & the Pope the way this movie did (not very funny). Did they actually get permission to use Frommer's travel guide by name?

At about 85 minutes, Eurotrip moves along quickly using the typical tag lines for maximum laughs, though I didn't laugh much in throughout this film. The things the filmmakers obviously wanted to be funny just didn't work out, some of the crude jokes reminded me of those really bad teen TV shows that use laugh tracks to compensate for an actual audience not laughing at all.The movie is about a recent high school graduate named Scott (his look and voice bear striking resemblance to Brad Pitt), whose girlfriend dumps him in the beginning because he's too predictable. At an after-grad party, he sees his girlfriend making out with the lead singer of a band played by Matt Damon, which is actually pretty funny especially since Damon has a spike in his chin and attempts to look hardcore. Scott has an internet penpal named Mike, and after a hard night drinking, Scott basically tells Mike to buzz off and never come to America. The next day Scott finds out that Mike is actually pronounced Mee-Ka, a popular German GIRLS name. So he decides he loves her and goes to Europe to apologize and profess his love.The movie is so hair-brained I could hardly stand it. About twenty minutes in, I wanted it to be over. I did enjoy the appearance of Fred Armison (of Saturday Night Live) who plays a goofy, raunchy Italian guy. A couple things were funny, most were not. I'm sure kids still in high school would enjoy this film, but my advice is to instead check out other teen comedies like Sixteen Candles or American Pie or even Road Trip.",3,So-So Teen Comedy,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,1676,"['Teen', 'films', 'are', 'realm', 'very', 'own', 'one', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'compared', 'other', 'teen', 'comedies', 'just', 'comedies', 'general', '85', 'minutes', 'Eurotrip', 'along', 'quickly', 'using', 'typical', 'tag', 'lines', 'maximum', 'laughs', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'much', 'film', 'things', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'crude', 'jokes', 'reminded', 'really', 'bad', 'teen', 'TV', 'shows', 'use', 'laugh', 'tracks', 'compensate', 'actual', 'audience', 'not', 'laughing', 'all.The', 'movie', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'named', 'Scott', 'look', 'voice', 'bear', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'girlfriend', 'beginning', 'too', 'predictable', 'after-grad', 'party', 'girlfriend', 'making', 'out', 'lead', 'singer', 'band', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'especially', 'Damon', 'spike', 'chin', 'attempts', 'look', 'hardcore', 'Scott', 'internet', 'penpal', 'named', 'Mike', 'hard', 'night', 'drinking', 'Scott', 'basically', 'Mike', 'buzz', 'off', 'never', 'come', 'America', 'next', 'day', 'Scott', 'out', 'Mike', 'actually', 'pronounced', 'Mee-Ka', 'popular', 'German', 'GIRLS', 'name', 'Europe', 'apologize', 'profess', 'love.The', 'movie', 'so', 'hair-brained', 'could', 'hardly', 'stand', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'wanted', 'be', 'did', 'enjoy', 'appearance', 'Fred', 'Armison', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'who', 'goofy', 'raunchy', 'Italian', 'guy', 'couple', 'things', 'were', 'funny', 'most', 'were', 'not', ""'m"", 'sure', 'kids', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'enjoy', 'film', 'advice', 'instead', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'teen', 'comedies', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'American', 'Pie', 'even', 'Road', 'Trip']",EuroTrip Unrated

Of course I'm 30 years old now so it's much easier for me to realize the style of laughter is more appropriate for the younger crowd.  The teenage jokes just don't appeal to me the same way nowadays.  However I can overlook much of the sillier and pointless stuff and focus on the well put together storyline.  As soon as the teens make their way to Europe, this is when the laughs REALLY begin.  Before this it's just a typical teenage environment that can be seen in plenty of other teen films.The story is about the one teenager on a quest to search for a German girl he desperately wants to be in a relationship with.  He doesn't travel alone of course- he brings his dim-witted friend and incredibly hot female friend who goes by the name Michelle Trachtenberg (a highly original last name if I do say so myself!  One I can't pronounce either, haha!)Well since it's a comedy, the gang of course find themselves in a few unusual and unpleasant situations.  The most memorable is the naked beach scene.  They think they're going on a nude beach to spot naked women but... they discover something very different and VERY wrong, haha.  The torture device segment involving the one friend is another notable highlight.  Oh, and the train ride with the extra friendly passenger is worth noting.  It's a little gross though!  Perhaps the jokes related to the Pope are a little TOO offensive.  I can't say I found any of this very funny at all.  They went too far here.Overall, a wonderful storyline that increases in the laughs steadily which is actually what a good comedy should always strive to accomplish.

Fitch,"[2, 4]","Another in a long line of ""American Pie""-type high school/college ""party movies"", Eurotrip takes the basic plot of its predecessor, Road Trip, and places it in a European setting.  While this offering is funny in its own right, it's not as memorable as Road Trip, although it is a bit raunchier.Fresh from graduating high school, Scotty is dumped by his girlfriend.  Soon after, he discovers (albeit in weird fashion) that his German penpal is his true love, and in a moment of spontenaiety, decides to travel to Berlin to meet her.  He tows his sex-starved best friend Cooper along, and they meet up with other friends, fraternal twins Jenny and Jamie (note: the ""worst twins ever"").  Every stereotypical thing about each place they visit along the way (of note, Amsterdam, London, Paris, and Bratislava(!)) is shined upon, and attempted hilarious mayhem ensues in each locale as Scotty tries to hook up with the girl of his dreams while avoiding international incidents.  Cameos abound in this flick, from Matt Damon (see if you can recognize him) to Lucy Lawless to Diedrich Bader (The Drew Carey Show), which adds to the fun.Eurotrip has a couple of drop-dead funny moments, but for the most part this film tries to capitalize on the frat-house demographic success of Road Trip, and falls just short.  Jacob Pitts (Cooper) tries to recreate one of the roles that made Seann William Scott famous, and though he brings a sort of uniqueness to his character, he's just not as good at the sidekick role as Scott.  There is a good Scott in this one, though; Scott Mechlowicz plays the hopeless romantic pretty well, and I actually felt like cheering him on in some parts.  There are really no standout characters in Eurotrip (except maybe the creepy Italian tourist the group runs into in each city), and the whole thing just seems like a rehash.  Not that it's a completely bad thing; it is a funny movie, and if you liked Road Trip, you'll get a kick out of this one too.",3,"Good, but ""Road Trip"" was funnier...",1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,1972,"['long', 'line', 'American', 'Pie', '-type', 'high', 'school/college', 'party', 'movies', 'Eurotrip', 'basic', 'plot', 'predecessor', 'Road', 'Trip', 'places', 'European', 'setting', 'offering', 'funny', 'own', 'right', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', 'Road', 'Trip', 'bit', 'raunchier.Fresh', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'Scotty', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'Soon', 'weird', 'fashion', 'German', 'penpal', 'true', 'love', 'moment', 'spontenaiety', 'travel', 'Berlin', 'meet', 'sex-starved', 'best', 'friend', 'Cooper', 'meet', 'up', 'other', 'friends', 'fraternal', 'twins', 'Jenny', 'Jamie', 'note', 'worst', 'twins', 'ever', 'stereotypical', 'thing', 'place', 'visit', 'way', 'note', 'Amsterdam', 'London', 'Paris', 'Bratislava', 'shined', 'attempted', 'hilarious', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'locale', 'Scotty', 'hook', 'up', 'girl', 'dreams', 'avoiding', 'international', 'incidents', 'Cameos', 'abound', 'flick', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'see', 'can', 'recognize', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'Show', 'fun.Eurotrip', 'couple', 'drop-dead', 'funny', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'capitalize', 'frat-house', 'demographic', 'success', 'Road', 'Trip', 'just', 'short', 'Jacob', 'Pitts', 'Cooper', 'recreate', 'one', 'roles', 'made', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'famous', 'sort', 'uniqueness', 'character', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'sidekick', 'role', 'Scott', 'good', 'Scott', 'one', 'though', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'pretty', 'well', 'actually', 'felt', 'cheering', 'parts', 'are', 'really', 'standout', 'characters', 'Eurotrip', 'maybe', 'creepy', 'Italian', 'tourist', 'group', 'city', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'rehash', 'Not', 'completely', 'bad', 'thing', 'funny', 'movie', 'liked', 'Road', 'Trip', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'one', 'too']",EuroTrip Unrated

But there he is getting dumped by said girlfriend on the day of graduation and (adding insult to injury) finding out through the lyrics of a rock song (shades of BOYS AND GIRLS here) that she has been cheating on him.Retreating home bruised from this encounter with reality Scott relates his woes to his German penpal - a guy we are told is named Mike.The response comes back flirtatious and spurred on by his best friends homophobic comments Scott insults his transatlantic friend. Its only when he realizes (thanks to his younger brother who seems to know better German than he does) that Mike is actually Mieke and a girl (and girl in the hot shape of Jessica Boehrs at that) that Scott resolves that he must win her at all costs.So there he goes with friend in tow to Europe. Stopping first in London they come into contact and in an unlikely turn of events befriend a group of English soccer hooligans (led by the always fun to watch Vince Vaughn). Making their way across the continent (in a manner which would have made the Griswolds proud) they team up with their vacationing High School friends (which include BUFFY's Michelle Trachtenberg) before Scott can finally confess his true feelings to Mieke.If comedies are rated by how much you actually laugh then EUROTRIP certainly scored with me. Perhaps I was in just a funny mood, but I found moments of the movie to be side splittingly funny. The movie takes some getting started, but once it hits Europe and we are into definite culture clash territory (ala CROCODILE DUNDEE and WHAT A GIRL WANTS) then the laughs come thick and fast.",4,"A comedy with laughs - wow, what a concept :)",1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2004,"['anyone', 'who', 'loved', 'inane', 'teen', 'comedies', 'ROAD', 'TRIP', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'here', 'EUROTRIP', 'movie', 'actually', 'insulting', 'large', 'portion', 'Europe', 'so', 'lost', 'sense', 'fun', 'can', 'overlook', 'lack', 'diplomatic', 'tact.Graduating', 'high', 'school', 'Scott', 'have', 'least', 'incredible', 'looking', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'cameo', 'SMALLVILLE', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'getting', 'dumped', 'said', 'girlfriend', 'day', 'graduation', 'adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'finding', 'out', 'lyrics', 'rock', 'song', 'shades', 'BOYS', 'AND', 'GIRLS', 'here', 'been', 'cheating', 'him.Retreating', 'home', 'bruised', 'encounter', 'reality', 'Scott', 'woes', 'German', 'penpal', 'guy', 'are', 'told', 'named', 'Mike.The', 'response', 'back', 'flirtatious', 'spurred', 'best', 'friends', 'homophobic', 'comments', 'Scott', 'insults', 'transatlantic', 'friend', 'only', 'when', 'thanks', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'know', 'better', 'German', 'Mike', 'actually', 'Mieke', 'girl', 'girl', 'hot', 'shape', 'Jessica', 'Boehrs', 'Scott', 'must', 'win', 'costs.So', 'there', 'friend', 'tow', 'Europe', 'Stopping', 'first', 'London', 'come', 'contact', 'unlikely', 'turn', 'events', 'befriend', 'group', 'English', 'soccer', 'hooligans', 'led', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Making', 'way', 'continent', 'manner', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Griswolds', 'proud', 'team', 'up', 'vacationing', 'High', 'School', 'friends', 'include', 'BUFFY', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Scott', 'can', 'finally', 'confess', 'true', 'feelings', 'Mieke.If', 'comedies', 'are', 'rated', 'how', 'much', 'actually', 'then', 'EUROTRIP', 'certainly', 'scored', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'funny', 'mood', 'found', 'moments', 'movie', 'be', 'side', 'splittingly', 'funny', 'movie', 'getting', 'started', 'Europe', 'are', 'definite', 'culture', 'clash', 'territory', 'ala', 'CROCODILE', 'DUNDEE', 'WHAT', 'A', 'GIRL', 'WANTS', 'then', 'laughs', 'come', 'thick', 'fast']",EuroTrip Unrated

It's funnier than European Vacation and American Pie, and about on par with Road Trip. Do you care?Hey, how about the plot: Scott (Scott (!) Mechlowicz) has just been dumped by his girlfriend Fiona, who publicly humiliates him at the graduation party with her boyfriend (a freakin' sweet cameo by Matt Damon) with the song Scotty Doesn't Know. Meanwhile, Scott has been communicating with pen pal Mieke (Jessica Boehrs), who he calls Mike and believes is a guy. When Mieke comes on to him online and Scott turns her down with disgust, though, he realizes his mistake and travels with buddy Cooper (Jacob Pitts) to Germany with ""the twins"" (Michelle Trachtenberg, Travis Wester), stopping in Amsterdam for hash brownies (or are they?) and a freaky visit to Club Vandersexxx; going to a nude beach with all guys; taking a train ride with a creepy Italian (SNL member Fred Armisen); drinking with a group of drunken Brits (led by Vinnie Jones); and destroying the Vatican with the fake death of the Pope and a fire. Does Scott end up with Mieke? The makers changed the ending so they do (wow, a big surprise!)Anyway, this movie is no classic, but it's a lot funnier than the previous effort of writers Alec Berg & David Mandel and writer/director Jeff Schaffer, a little movie called the Cat in the Hat.

625190,A2TD13LRUGU46X,B00005JN0A,Grant McKee,"[2, 4]","*urotrip is just a flat-out hilarious movie.  In the realm of ""teen sex comedies"" it's got a lot of competition to face, but I think it holds its own just fine.  The four main characters are excellent, each living up to the stereotypes dictated by earlier forays into the teen sex comedy realm, but adding something new as well.  Supporting characters are generally pretty entertaining, especially the soccer hooligans (I always get that Business song stuck in my head when I think of that scene), Matt Damon's cameo as the lead singer in a pop punk band (easily the funniest part of the whole flick), and the regrettably cut scene with Joanna Lumley as the owner of a youth hostel.The exclusion of Lumley's scene (you can see it during the credits, though, so it's not completely abandoned) is one of a few complaints I have with this movie.  I found the actress that played Mieke to be extremely boring and rigid, but she made good eye candy, which is really what they were going for in this movie.  Where the film fails the most, though, is that it starts off strong, then somewhere around the time that they end up in eastern Europe, it takes a turn for the worst, as the characters wake up out of their lives of reckless abandon and act more *gasp* mature.  Fortunately, there are enough laughs toward the end to make it completely worth your time to finish off the movie, and the beginning has some absolutely priceless moments.The DVD package is great, too, with plenty of deleted scenes, some interesting commentary by the director and the writers, as well as the ""party along"" commentary where you basically get to listen to the writers get completely bombed while playing the Eurotrip drinking game.Overall, Eurotrip makes a great addition to anyone's collection of teen comedies, and will find a space in your collection among American Pie, Can't Hardly Wait, and Road Trip.",4,Hilarious!!,1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,1885,"['*urotrip', 'just', 'flat-out', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'realm', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedies', 'got', 'lot', 'competition', 'face', 'think', 'own', 'just', 'fine', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'excellent', 'living', 'up', 'stereotypes', 'dictated', 'earlier', 'forays', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedy', 'realm', 'adding', 'something', 'new', 'as', 'well', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'soccer', 'hooligans', 'always', 'get', 'Business', 'song', 'stuck', 'head', 'when', 'think', 'scene', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'cameo', 'lead', 'singer', 'pop', 'punk', 'band', 'easily', 'funniest', 'part', 'whole', 'flick', 'regrettably', 'cut', 'scene', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'owner', 'youth', 'hostel.The', 'exclusion', 'Lumley', 'scene', 'can', 'see', 'credits', 'though', 'not', 'completely', 'abandoned', 'one', 'few', 'complaints', 'have', 'movie', 'found', 'actress', 'played', 'Mieke', 'be', 'extremely', 'boring', 'rigid', 'made', 'good', 'eye', 'candy', 'really', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'movie', 'Where', 'film', 'most', 'though', 'strong', 'then', 'somewhere', 'time', 'end', 'up', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'turn', 'worst', 'characters', 'wake', 'up', 'lives', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'act', 'more', '*gasp*', 'mature', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'enough', 'laughs', 'end', 'make', 'completely', 'time', 'finish', 'off', 'movie', 'beginning', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'moments.The', 'DVD', 'package', 'great', 'too', 'plenty', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'director', 'writers', 'as', 'well', 'party', 'commentary', 'where', 'basically', 'get', 'listen', 'writers', 'get', 'completely', 'bombed', 'playing', 'Eurotrip', 'drinking', 'game.Overall', 'Eurotrip', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection', 'teen', 'comedies', 'will', 'find', 'space', 'collection', 'American', 'Pie', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'Road', 'Trip']",EuroTrip Unrated

I have never laughed so hard in the movies my entire life, and I'm not just saying that.  The humor in Eurotrip is funny, clever and yes, exaggerated but its still a good time.  I've seen a lot of reviews who have bashed it because they didn't film on location.  Who cares?  It bugs me when they do something like that with Cold Mountain, a film about the American civil war filmed in Austria (I think), but Eurotrip is a comedy, I'm not going to be looking for every tiny detail.  Let's save that for the historical films.  Eurotrip in short is a very funny film to watch especially with friends.The extras here are great too, but the unrated title throws you off a bit.  First off, none of the unrated stuff is included within the film itself, its all about the actual extras and menus and stuff.  There is a Nude Scene index just for kicks.  But my favorite extra would have to be the Chinese Bootleg, which they threw on for a variety of reasons, the directors talk about it, but the main reason its there is because its just so dam funny to watch, it's absolutely terrible.My Name is Scott and judging from the title of my review, the only thing that I do not like about this movie is the whole Scotty Doesn't Know song.  After this came out nobody, made a big deal about it, but a few months afterwards, everybody started singing it as soon as I walked into the room.  One could imagine it can be very annoying, especially when someone does it and they think they are the first to do it.  Yes it's quite original.  *sarcasm*Despite the song being annoying, the fad of singing it has seemed to have died out, so I have nothing against this film any more.  It's odd because most of the teenage sex films like American Pie just annoyed me, but this one had something to it.  The characters, or at least most of them were believable.  And it is a bit of reflection of the world's society as how one interprets another.  Heck the creepy Italian guy thought there was nothing wrong with what he did, he was just behaving as he always does, but then again his character is highly exaggerated.  I'll cut to the point; my review is as long enough as it is.  Buy or rent today, and get a crowd of friends together as you watch it, you will not be disappointed in the slightest.P.S.

Mike invites himself over to the States to ""go out to dinner "" with Scott and Scott then blows him off thinking that Mike is some sort of pervert. What he doesn't realize until  the next morning that Mike is actually a Girl ( pronounced Mi-Ka In German!!!). Then Scott and his buddies head off to Europe to try to make amends.

So all through the movie we get to hear the ""Scotty doesn't know"" song. He is email penpals with a German girl named Mike, but he doesn't know it's a girl. Which is stupid from the get go, how could you not tell the sex of someone after lots of writing? It takes his little brother to tell him.So to make a long story short, he and his friends end up in Europe to find his Mike. They have a run-in with the Manc soccer team in England, a dominatrix nightmare in Amsterdam, an all-male nude beach, a French Robot mime, and end up burning the pope's hat. Of course we have the lovey dovey happy ending where Mike decides to go to school in America to be with Scott. She is placed in his room because the school thought she was a guy.

His girl friend, Fiona (Kristin Kreuk) dumps him and shows up at a party with her boyfriend, Donny (Matt Damon), whose not only in the band but has written a infectious new song called ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" that explains how in the dark our hero has been (there is both a sing along and a music video for this song by Lustra in the special features).  Then, to add insult to injury, he breaks off his e-mail relationship with Mieke, because he is convinced by his friend Cooper Harris (Jacob Pitts) that Mieke is a gay German guy who is just trying to hit on him.  Then his little brother Bert (Nial Iskhakov) explains that ""Mieke"" is not the German short version of Michael but rather of Michelle.  So Mieke is a hot young German blond woman who thinks that Scotty could be ""the one,"" and Scotty has just blown her off.  Apparently there is a lot that Scott doesn't know, including basic German.This turn of events explains why Mieke has blocked Scotty's e-mail and why he decides that the most important thing in the world is getting to Berlin to meet Mieke in the flesh, so to speak.  Cooper finds a way to get Scotty to England and comes along for the trip.  Since Europe is a fairly small ""country,"" they manage to hook up with their friends, the twins, brother Jamie (Travis Wester), who carries around the Frommer travel guide even though he has committed it to memory, and sister Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg), who is considered one of the guys for some long that we are supposed to believe nobody (i.e., Cooper) has noticed she is a girl.At this point it becomes clear that the idea of this movie is to send the quartet to a recognizable European city and have them get a taste of the local culture and still get out of town alive.  But the big problem with this movie is that most of their problems have to do with sexual deviance.  That means the creepy Italian guy (Fred Armisen) who likes to wait for the train to go through a tunnel so he can sexually assault strangers and Madame Vandersexx (Lucy Lawless) at a S&M; club (bring a flyer, get a free t-shirt).  Apparently the idea is that if people go to Europe to have sex rather than see museums, then they deserve to be punished by having horrible things happen to them, and while that sounds like a worthwhile position to take in these troubled times, it is not really that funny.  Neither is the idea that being homophobic is a necessary survival skill for daily living.Unfortunately ""Eurotrip"" saves the draw-droppingly bad part of the film for the climax, which I am sure seemed like a good idea at the time.  It takes place at the Vatican, which is a strange enough location to pick for our hero to finally catch up with the woman he loves, but as soon as a tour guide points out that the fancy rope behind the glass door is attached to bell that is only rung to announce the death of the Pope, you know things are not going to go well.  The fact that the chimney in the Sistine Chapel is not connected to a fireplace in St. Peter's Basilica certainly bothered me and while there may well be confessionals in the Vatican I have a hard time believing they would be used for such secular purposes.Another problem is that teenage girls have been played by young women in their 20s for so long that when you have an actual 18-year-old actress playing an 18-year-old character like Michelle Trachtenberg does in this movie, she still seems like a kid sister.  Besides, she also seems too smart to end up making the choice she ends up making just to have a European sexual experience (By the end of the film the lesson seems to be that those who cannot have sex in Europe only deserve to have sex with others who could not have sex in Europe, like it was an attempt to weed out a regressive gene or something).  After ""Just Married"" it was obvious that the only way for comedies about Americans traveling through Europe to go would have to be up, but who expected such a small incremental step like this movie?  But then 2004 was a really wretched year for comedies, especially at those aimed at the pocketbooks of the youth of America.There are some decent extras on this one, and not just because it takes a while to get to the point where you have heard ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" too much.  However, I have to admit I was disappointed that they only had a few scenes from the bootlegged version of ""Eurotrip"" that the writers found in New York City three months before the official DVD release (I have found memories of the bootlegged version of ""Return of the Jedi,"" with the camera trying to keep up with the talking heads being on the left and then the right in the final scene between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker).  In addition to being able to go directly to the nude scenes you can do the same for the unrated scenes (yes, there actually is a difference with regards to one or two of those).",3,Young Ugly

625226,AZI0O32W4ZYGH,B00005JN0A,"Michael Gordon ""Michael Gordon""","[4, 14]","Eurotrip is a highly unrealistic movie that should be categorized as ""pure rubbish.""  The movie's premise:  that a wimper-snapper high school grad mistakenly thinks his German internet pen paler is a male and therefore decides that contact should be written off.  Well, turns out he was wrong: his pen pal is a gorgeous German blonde female.The entire basis for the movie is attempting to rectify that error.  Apparently his pen paler decides to block him.  The primitive email screen tells him that his email is blocked and he cannot communicate with her further.  In real life, that calls for creating a new email address so that one can retain contact with the blocker.  In any case, in the movie, that calls for going to Europe.Most of the European clips are quite lousy and sporadic.  There's not much of a point to being in Europe other than the German girl he seeks.  A high degree of anti-intellectualism pervades the movie.  I can understand the interest in sex, but it tends to be of the base sort rather than the romantic.  It does not seem plausible that a high school graduate can say ""I love you"" to a German girl he thought (until recently) was a male.  The only reason he came to love her was because he learned her name was female?  If the relationship between them was that superficial, it is hard to believe that his interest transcended looks much at all.  Overall, a fairly lame and quickly created movie with no substance whatsoever.Michael",2,The movie is highly unrealistic.,1088294400,"06 27, 2004",2004,1462,"['Eurotrip', 'highly', 'unrealistic', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'categorized', 'pure', 'rubbish', 'movie', 'premise', 'wimper-snapper', 'high', 'school', 'grad', 'mistakenly', 'German', 'internet', 'pen', 'paler', 'male', 'therefore', 'decides', 'contact', 'should', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'Well', 'out', 'was', 'wrong', 'pen', 'pal', 'gorgeous', 'German', 'blonde', 'female.The', 'entire', 'basis', 'movie', 'attempting', 'rectify', 'error', 'Apparently', 'pen', 'paler', 'decides', 'block', 'primitive', 'email', 'screen', 'email', 'blocked', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'further', 'real', 'life', 'creating', 'new', 'email', 'address', 'one', 'can', 'retain', 'contact', 'blocker', 'case', 'movie', 'going', 'Europe.Most', 'European', 'clips', 'are', 'quite', 'lousy', 'sporadic', 'not', 'much', 'point', 'being', 'Europe', 'other', 'German', 'girl', 'high', 'degree', 'anti-intellectualism', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'interest', 'sex', 'be', 'base', 'sort', 'rather', 'romantic', 'not', 'seem', 'plausible', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'German', 'girl', 'thought', 'recently', 'was', 'male', 'only', 'reason', 'came', 'love', 'was', 'learned', 'name', 'was', 'female', 'relationship', 'was', 'superficial', 'hard', 'believe', 'interest', 'transcended', 'looks', 'much', 'Overall', 'fairly', 'lame', 'quickly', 'created', 'movie', 'substance', 'whatsoever.Michael']",EuroTrip Unrated

I literally was rolling on the floor, laughing at some parts (especially ""scotty doesnt know"", and ""escuse""). But I'm getting ahead of myself. the movie is about a guy named Scotty who has this German friend on the internet named Mikea. Mikea helps Scotty with his German homework by translating things for him in German. He thinks this person is a male and wants to have ""sexual relations"" with him when Mikea is actually a she. When Scotty finds this out him and his friend Cooper decide to go to Europe and make sure that Scotty can make up with his German friend and possibly make a relationship (a la boyfriend/girlfriend). Scotty and Cooper then meet up with these twins who are also in vacation in Europe, and together the four head to Berlin, Germany.The movie isn't very believeable at some points. For example - every single person that they meet somehow comes back and helps Scotty and CO. However in my oppinion this is the only thing that holds the movie back. The movie has alot of great things in it, although I'd hate to give them away.This movie may not be believeable but it's a hella fun ride while it last and you will laugh your pants off til your in tears - Fact.

As far as I can see, about the only difference is an early scene where the girl's top is removed before the horny male character enters the hot tub.  That's fine, but it just doesn't work as well as the scene in the theatrical version.

I love the little old lady giving advice to Scotty and Miki while they are making love in the confessional!Now being over 30 yrs of age I would have to agree with some of the reviewers here and say that this movie is the Porky's of THIS generation. The comparisons with both the american pie series and girl next door is really stupid. This movie is a stand alone movie and should be view as such and with a open mind.The story has been told over and over again in the reviews so IF you want or are looking for a rehash about it, read the reviews. Also Freddie Prince Jr and David Spade are too old to play in this movie but the producers did pick two new up and coming actors that will probably be the next generation Freddie Prince Jr and David Spade.As for the reviews who think this is a career killer for Lucy Lawless, She is enjoying playing bit parts in movies like Spiderman and EuroTrip and making guest appearances on TV besides she is married to a movie director and will probably appear in minor roles in all his movies that he directs, that plus all the money she made playing Xena Warrior Princess. Lucy can afford to relax and take care of her two kids if she chooses.I enjoyed this movie with the running joke in it about the song ""Scotty doesnt know"" and other running gags like the Pope watching his replacement on TV after being 'elected' within 10~20 minutes of his 'alleged' death and the little salutes to other movies and tv shows:I.E. Cooper's white suit in that european night club paying homage to James Bond or Miki's step brother doing a hitler impersonation in the background while the father and Scotty talk in the foreground is like watching early episodes of Family Guy with Stewie doing something the the background while the adults talk in the foreground.I wonder IF this movie was to be made now if the FIGHTING MANCHESTER UNITED would appear in the movie knowing what Malcom Glazer did to the team.

625251,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JN0A,Roland E. Zwick,"[99, 106]","""Eurotrip"" is a cheeky little sex farce that is far more endearing and amusing than it has any real right to be.  Think of this as basically ""International Pie,"" with four high school grads spending their final summer before college on a wild sex-capade through Europe.Writers Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer have penned a surprisingly clever screenplay, filled with ribald humor and irreverent, keen-eyed satire.  As director, Shaffer keeps the energy level high and the tone so innocently upbeat that material that could easily have become sleazy and smarmy in less gifted hands becomes genuinely hilarious and utterly good-natured in his.  Even when a particular scene or joke falls flat, there is always a clever zinger or ingenious comic concept coming right along behind it to keep the film moving steadily along on the right track.  And some of the scenes are very funny indeed, with the film, as a whole, providing more hearty belly laughs than almost any comedy in recent memory.  Those easily offended by nudity and a casual attitude towards sex may want to take a pass on this film, but the rest of us will find much to laugh at in this broad little romp.As the New World quartet suddenly let loose on the unsuspecting Old World, Scott Mechlowicz, Jacob Pitts, Michelle Trachtenberg and Travis Wester deliver performances filled with unflagging energy and youthful high spirits.

There is no new ground covered, some jokes are retreads, but darn it, it works.  Although I will say the only joke that appeared somewhat new, and is just darn funny as a recurring joke is the ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" song.....oh my that was good for a laugh.I normally like my movies a little more high brow, a little more fresh, but everyone involved with this film should be congratulated for making a truly fun little movie.  The love the makers of this film had for the project is extremely obvious in just about every scene, and it is contagious.As for the DVD itself, the extras are well laid out and also fun filled.  This disc has not only one commentary track by the film makers, but two.  The first one is your normal track about filmmaking.  The second track though strikes me as something I haven't seen before, in that the film makers tear apart their own film while drinking and playing a drinking game based on their own film.Do NOT go into this DVD expecting a high brow film, expect a cheesy teen film that is actually just fun.

""Unrated Version"" contains both male and female nudity (includes some hot women and large number of men (men at nude beach)).DVD Features: The DVD contains an unrated version of the movie and some Special Features.  The Special Features include: Commentaries (two versions: Filmmakers' Commentary and Party Along Commentary); a gag reel; deleted scenes (with or without commentary and includes 13 deleted scenes); Alternate Ending (with or without Commentary); a helpful Nude Scene Index (apparently 10 scenes (the index involves a picture and an down arrow)); Unrated Scene Index (8 scenes; if this index is correct, then the R rated theater version must not have had much if any nudity); Nude Beach Exposed (something of a ""documentary"" of the scene); a featurette called ""How to Pick a Director"" (apparently all three writers worked together and they had to chose one to be credited as the director); ""Eurotrip Bootleg"" (writers commentary for a Chinese bootleg copy of the movie); ""The Music of Eurotrip"" (an ad for the soundtrack; a music video; and a ""Sing-A-Long""); Photo Gallery; Script; Production Notes; Cast bios; and the filmmakers biography.Plot: The movie opens with some students graduating from high school and a one of the student's (Scott) getting dumped by his girlfriend, Fiona (""Smallville's"" Kristin Kreuk).  After this dumping sequence, Scott and friends go to a graduation party, where Fiona's music boyfriend plays a song about Fiona (Scott is boring and Fiona is a tramp).  While Scott's friends (the twins; Cooper plans on working at a law firm) plan on backpacking in Europe, Scott plans on staying home and working.  This changes when his German ""pen pal"" invites ""himself"" to America.  Scott freaks out that the ""man"" wants to ""sleep"" with him.  This German, ""Mike,"" helped Scott in German class.  And Scott had been confused, it wasn't Mike but Mieke (a female; it is momentarily funny when Scott realizes that Mieke is female, and he had sent an e-mail basically blowing her off).  Scott decides to head off to Europe with his friend Cooper as couriers to try to meet Mieke after she blocks his e-mail (she lives in Germany; they are sent to London and assume they can ""walk"" to Berlin, and Cooper hasn't told his law firm that he is off to Europe).  Remember, the rest of the gang, the twins, are also heading to Europe on a backpacking trip (though they don't head over together, they join each other's groups in Paris).  The gang has a lot of adventures in Europe, including scenes in night clubs, trains and nude beaches, and then the movie ends.Credits: The movie stars Scott Mechlowisz (Scott Thomas), Michelle Trachtenberg (Jenny; from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV show), Jacob Pitts (Cooper Harris; ""K-19""), Jessica Boehrs (Mieke; musical artist in Germany); Travis Wester (Jamie; ""Beverly Hills 90210""), Lucy Lawless (Madame Vandersexxx; ""Xena""), Vinnie Jones (Head Hooligan; ""Snatch""), and Fred Armisen (Creepy Italian Guy; ""Anchorman"").  Jenny and Jamie are supposed to be twins.  The credited director is Jeff Schaffer.Review: Interesting opening credit sequence, displaying the credits against an animated airline safety pamphlet, though the music is a little annoying.  Somewhat annoyingly, the ""fourth wall"" is broken and one of the kids (Cooper, the ""hard"" or ""bad"" member of the group) notes ""there's your R rating right there"" when he spots some nude women in a hot top at the graduation party (though Cooper certainly knows how to talk a topless woman, who doesn't particularly like him, to fondle herself in front of him).The film is a comedy and there are some amusing moments, some of which are down right funny (especially the scene where Jamie is robbed in Amsterdam; and the scene where Scott attempts to speak German with a truck driver).  There are actually some more funny moments than I expected, but most of the moments just cause a brief laugh.  Some of the scenes, though some scenes have a tendency to go on too long.The acting is good enough for this type of movie, though not the best in the world.  The music includes some of the same music also appeared in National Lampoon's European Vacation.

Everything seems to be going great for high school senior, Scotty, as he graduates and prepares for his last summer before college.  Things change when his girlfriend, Fiona, dumps him.  In the breakup aftermath, Scotty tells off his German pen pal in a drunken stupor in an email only to discover that the pen pal is a hot German girl.  Along with three friends, Scotty heads to Europe to win back his lost love.  This is by no means a great movie, but still it has its moments.  Lots of raunchy comedy as the quartet travels to London, Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin, and several other places.  They run into soccer hooligans, violent robot mimes, French street thieves, and so much more.  Don't take this movie seriously and you will probably enjoy it.Scott Mechlowicz plays high school senior Scott Thomas who travels to Europe with three friends to find the German girl he unknowingly told off.  Jacob Pitts is very funny as Scott's horny friend, Cooper Harris, who looks at the trip to Europe as a grand sexual oddysey.  Michele Trachtenberg and Travis Wester play Jenny and Jamie, a pair of brother and sister twins.  Jenny is the quiet, unassuming friend and Jamie has memorized a guidebook so he will not miss anything during the trip.  Eurotrip has plenty of great cameos including Matt Damon as a punk rocker, Lucy Lawless as a sexual dominatrix Cooper meets in Amsterdam, Vinnie Jones as a Manchester United soccer hooligan, Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Hytner, Diedrich Bader, and Fred Armisen.  Also starring are Kristen Kruek and Jessica Bohrs.  The Unrated DVD offers widescreen presentation, audio commentary, a gag reel, and deleted scenes.

625271,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JN0A,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","`Eurotrip' is a farce, something you look at and just enjoy. That's it. You may hate the stereotyped images of Europe - soccer hooligans in England or sexy ladies in Amsterdam, well, that is understandable. And people in Italy would most naturally dislike some part of the film, and so are those in Germany, where, according to the film, boys strut at their home like Adolf. I don't say I like everything in the film, but I admit that it has some hilarious moments thanks to the surprisingly good four leading actors.The four leads are Scott Mechlowicz as nice but ""predictable"" guy Scott, Jacob Pitts as perpetually horny guy Cooper, Travis Wester as geeky guy Jamie (with an expensive camera and a travel guidebook), and Michelle Trachtenburg as Jenny, sister of Jamie (and for Cooper she is not a girl). Scott finds that his on-line pen pal was actually a woman, not a male, and decides to fly to Germany. But naturally he cannot go there without lots of misadventures involving his friends.As you know, `Eurotrip' is like a string of goofy sketches written by three writers Alec Berg, David Mandel, and Jeff Schaffer - all behind `Cat in the Hat.' Oh, but wait, please don't run away. Surely all the ideas are based on silly ideas and the gags themselves are sometimes hit and sometimes miss. The script is untidy but largely enjoyable because of the charms of the likable main characters. These characters are not particularly original, but no one hates the idea of watching Michelle Trachtenbur in bikini, right?It is easy to ridicule the film, and call it a Dreamwork's belated attempt to do something like `American Pie' (probably it is), but the cheer and fun are undeniable. And it must be pointed out that before the recent trend of Hollywood's goofy comedies begin, Europe also did many sex comedies that are equally goofy during the 60s and 70s. No matter what we say, the tradition of silly farces would continue, and we keep watching them. It is what we call guilty pleasure, and I enjoyed it.My favorite sketch is `The Robot-fighting in Paris.'

If you're just up for some laughter and don't care about intelligence or are just looking for a getaway moment, ""Eurotrip"" may be a possible choice for ya.Basically the movie centers around four hormone-driven teens out looking to get laid and party... but it also has a minor plotline interjected into their lil' post-high school graduation vacation. Our ""hero"" Scotty (Scott Mechlowicz) had a rough high school graduation day since his girlfriend dumped him just after he graduated. But Scotty isn't alone for long. He's got a German Internet ""pen-pal"" that he writes to constantly. Scotty's buddy Cooper (Jacob Pitts) thinks that this German dude is just trying to ""hook-up"" with Scotty, who is convinced later on and sends a nasty e-mail to his German friend. Unfortunately, the German friend isn't a dude at all, but rather a ""hot-looking"" German ""babe."" Now Scotty wants to go overseas to find his ""true love.""Two other buddies join Scotty and Cooper's getaway (eventually... by accident), one a guy named Jamie (Travis Wester) and his sister Jenny (Michelle Trachtenburg), both that're called the ""worst twins"" and Scotty and Jacob think Jenny isn't a girl.Our characters run into trouble and the s**t hits the fan plenty of times. Of course, sometimes the laughs don't come out at all when jokes fall flat on their face or something is just God-awfully stupid it's just not funny... but somehow, you may still manage to chuckle out a laugh or smile.Perhaps I had an enjoyable day when I watched this movie, but it's the kind of movie that has so many mistakes and stereotypical remarks with some lame jokes that makes it so bad that it's actually worth watching. The actors and actresses pull off their parts well (particularly Jacob Pitts, who's character is obviously the best in the movie) and features numerous cameos from Matt Damon to Lucy Lawless.So if you're up for a getaway movie, maybe ""Eurotrip"" could be a consideration.Oh well... at least there was a naked chick in it.",3,Hmm.... dunno what to type here,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,2107,"['Ahh', 'R-rated', 'teen', 'comedy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'while.This', 'just', 'stupid', 'silly', 'often', 'funny', 'movie', ""'re"", 'just', 'up', 'laughter', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'intelligence', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'getaway', 'moment', 'Eurotrip', 'may', 'be', 'possible', 'choice', 'ya.Basically', 'movie', 'centers', 'four', 'hormone-driven', 'teens', 'out', 'looking', 'get', 'laid', 'party', 'also', 'minor', 'plotline', 'interjected', 'lil', 'post-high', 'school', 'graduation', 'vacation', 'hero', 'Scotty', 'Scott', 'Mechlowicz', 'had', 'rough', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'day', 'girlfriend', 'dumped', 'just', 'graduated', 'Scotty', ""n't"", 'alone', 'long', 'got', 'German', 'Internet', 'pen-pal', 'constantly', 'Scotty', 'buddy', 'Cooper', 'Jacob', 'Pitts', 'German', 'dude', 'just', 'trying', 'hook-up', 'Scotty', 'who', 'convinced', 'later', 'nasty', 'e-mail', 'German', 'friend', 'Unfortunately', 'German', 'friend', ""n't"", 'dude', 'rather', 'hot-looking', 'German', 'babe', 'Now', 'Scotty', 'go', 'overseas', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'Two', 'other', 'buddies', 'join', 'Scotty', 'Cooper', 'getaway', 'eventually', 'accident', 'one', 'guy', 'named', 'Jamie', 'Travis', 'Wester', 'sister', 'Jenny', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenburg', ""'re"", 'called', 'worst', 'twins', 'Scotty', 'Jacob', 'think', 'Jenny', ""n't"", 'girl.Our', 'characters', 'run', 'trouble', 's**t', 'fan', 'plenty', 'times', 'course', 'sometimes', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'when', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'something', 'just', 'God-awfully', 'stupid', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'somehow', 'may', 'still', 'manage', 'chuckle', 'out', 'laugh', 'smile.Perhaps', 'had', 'enjoyable', 'day', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'kind', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'mistakes', 'stereotypical', 'remarks', 'lame', 'jokes', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'worth', 'watching', 'actors', 'actresses', 'pull', 'off', 'parts', 'well', 'particularly', 'Jacob', 'Pitts', 'who', 'character', 'obviously', 'best', 'movie', 'numerous', 'cameos', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Lucy', 'Lawless.So', ""'re"", 'up', 'getaway', 'movie', 'maybe', 'Eurotrip', 'could', 'be', 'consideration.Oh', 'well', 'least', 'was', 'naked', 'chick']",EuroTrip Unrated

Unfortunately, Road Trip and Old School, used in all the ads, beat it to the punch, and while neither of those are particularly intelligent movies either, they're much better than the nearly laughless hell that is Eurotrip.The movie is overbearingly annoying to start with, using pointlessly loud and cluttered credit sequences that intend to be but are remarkably unfunny. From there, it segues into a concert that has a few amusing moments, but nothing of takeoff velocity. After that, the few high point include a couple of Snatch cast members (Rade Serbedgia and Vinnie Jones), and a song that actually manages to become a little more funny with each successive appearance.Don't watch this dreck. Not only are Old School and Road Trip smarter and funnier, but this year's The Girl Next Door trumps all of them with more charming, witty and funny material. (And as an added black mark, the use of Old School and Road Trip's logos in the previews have resulted in the permanent cancellation of Old School 2...what a waste).",1,"Dumb, dull, directed badly and worst of all, too late",1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,1079,"['Eurotrip', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'kinda', 'funny', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Unfortunately', 'Road', 'Trip', 'Old', 'School', 'used', 'ads', 'beat', 'punch', 'are', 'particularly', 'intelligent', 'movies', ""'re"", 'much', 'better', 'nearly', 'laughless', 'hell', 'Eurotrip.The', 'movie', 'overbearingly', 'annoying', 'start', 'using', 'pointlessly', 'loud', 'cluttered', 'credit', 'sequences', 'intend', 'be', 'are', 'remarkably', 'unfunny', 'there', 'concert', 'few', 'amusing', 'moments', 'nothing', 'takeoff', 'velocity', 'few', 'high', 'point', 'include', 'couple', 'Snatch', 'cast', 'members', 'Rade', 'Serbedgia', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'song', 'actually', 'become', 'little', 'more', 'funny', 'successive', 'appearance.Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'dreck', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'Old', 'School', 'Road', 'Trip', 'smarter', 'funnier', 'year', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'more', 'charming', 'witty', 'funny', 'material', 'added', 'black', 'mark', 'use', 'Old', 'School', 'Road', 'Trip', 'logos', 'previews', 'have', 'resulted', 'permanent', 'cancellation', 'Old', 'School', '2', 'what', 'waste']",EuroTrip Unrated

Yes, it is VERY high in sexual content, but you understand, it's done to attract attention.Eurotrip is full of hilarious moments, even aside from the sex. ""Scotty doesn't know"" was stuck in my head for days, and I'm singing it as I'm writing this review! =D And I gotta say, Lucy Lawless was totally awesome in her role as madame Vandersex!!Don't let little kids, nor older people watch it.

The extras you get on the DVD push it over the edge. There are over a dozen deleted scenes, most are really funny (probably should have been included in the film). God, how I wish they included the European O.J. commercial. Just thinking about it makes me laugh.Besides the deleted scenes, there are just so many extras with this DVD; I'm shocked to get so much for twenty-bucks. I counted fifteen special feature menus and most of them are actually entertaining (rare in my opinion). The best extra is probably the bootleg copy of &quot;Eurotrip&quot; they put on the disk: &quot;we just bootleged the bootleger, so -you pirate&quot;.If you liked &quot;Eurotrip&quot; you'll enjoy this DVD. Even if you didn't care for it, or were on the borderline, you should consider picking it up. All the extras make this a whole new experience.
