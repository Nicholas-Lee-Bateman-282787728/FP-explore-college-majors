621806,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B00005JMSD,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[8, 11]","I was young and footloose when China Beach was originally aired, so I was introduced to the series in syndication and on grainy VHS copies in the mid-nineties and became a huge fan despite these impediments of chronology and quality.  These glimpses into characters and situations as well written as many novels led me to seek out discarded copies of recorded shows, occasionally  buying on ebay at usurious prices.This speaks to the power of China Beach as classic television and timeless storytelling.  The depth and realism of the characters is the strongest element of the series.  As Socrates said and few of us remember, great virtue and miserable flaws exist side by side in the same person.  McMurphy, the protagonist and heroine contrasts the predictable characteristics of the ministering angel as a nurse in a field hospital during the VietNam war with the corresponding flaws of a self-righteous, hypocritical, sometimes misogynistic good girl.  The prostitute, K.C.,  has not only that well trammeled  heart of gold and a heart of greed, but both turn out to be armour for a strong woman avoiding as best she can the pain she knows life will inevitably dish out.  The setting of Vietnam's infamous China Beach is peripheral, this is really a character study of people playng the cards of character and circumstance they are dealt by fate.Warner's Please release the entire series on DVD.",5,Classic Dramatic Series - Please Release Series on DVD,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,1400,"['was', 'young', 'footloose', 'when', 'China', 'Beach', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'was', 'introduced', 'series', 'syndication', 'grainy', 'VHS', 'copies', 'mid-nineties', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'impediments', 'chronology', 'quality', 'glimpses', 'characters', 'situations', 'as', 'well', 'written', 'many', 'novels', 'led', 'seek', 'out', 'discarded', 'copies', 'recorded', 'shows', 'occasionally', 'buying', 'ebay', 'usurious', 'prices.This', 'power', 'China', 'Beach', 'classic', 'television', 'timeless', 'storytelling', 'depth', 'realism', 'characters', 'strongest', 'element', 'series', 'Socrates', 'said', 'few', 'remember', 'great', 'virtue', 'miserable', 'flaws', 'exist', 'side', 'side', 'same', 'person', 'McMurphy', 'protagonist', 'heroine', 'predictable', 'characteristics', 'ministering', 'angel', 'nurse', 'field', 'hospital', 'VietNam', 'war', 'corresponding', 'flaws', 'self-righteous', 'hypocritical', 'sometimes', 'misogynistic', 'good', 'girl', 'prostitute', 'K.C.', 'not', 'only', 'that', 'well', 'trammeled', 'heart', 'gold', 'heart', 'greed', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'armour', 'strong', 'woman', 'avoiding', 'best', 'can', 'pain', 'life', 'will', 'inevitably', 'dish', 'out', 'setting', 'Vietnam', 'infamous', 'China', 'Beach', 'peripheral', 'really', 'character', 'study', 'people', 'playng', 'cards', 'character', 'circumstance', 'are', 'dealt', 'fate.Warner', 'Please', 'release', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD']",China Beach

Finally after a 25 years wait and hundreds of requests from fans, it's available on DVD in 2013!China Beach was one of my most favorite shows back in the day. It has been so long that I didn't realize that Marg Helgenberger, who plays Catherine Willows in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, was the same actress as the very Hot Redhead, Karen Charlene &#34;K.C.&#34; Koloski, a heroin-addicted prostitute and later black-marketeer that I had a crush on as a teen. Also didn't realize that Dana Delany who played Katherine Mayfair on the Desperate Housewives and played Megan Hunt on the ABC drama series Body of Proof was the same actress as China Beach's Nurse Colleen McMurphy. They both looked different with red hair in China Beach (Nowadays Blond). Also surprised to see Robert Picardo,  the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH), &#34;The Doctor&#34;, on Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and some Star Trek movies and played Richard Woolsey in the Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe was the same actor as Dr. Dick Richards on China Beach (who had hair back than).Only 2 complaints, as someone mentioned earlier, is the Price, $200- $325 for Seasons 1-4, which is totally not worth it for only 62 episodes with No Sub-Titles nor Closed-Captions which my wife needs (she's not deaf) just unable to comprehend actors talking in an accent whether it's a Texas, Southern, Mid-Western, Bronx, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Boston, Scottish, Cockney, Irish, Aussie, Hispanic, Hip-Hop/Ghetto Talk, Cajun nor French-Canadian.

621818,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B00005JMSD,Edward Aycock,"[7, 11]","To start off, this would not be a show on network TV today.  The confines of television have loosened up a bit in the past 15 years and to have a show on a network is  to have your show neutered.  ""China Beach"" may have survived for more than 62 episodes had it been on a network like HBO or AMC today.  But then again, those 62 episodes span the years from 1966 to 1988 and bring the entire story full circle.Having not really seen this show in over twenty years, I approached this release with a lot of happiness and just a *little* trepidation. Would it hold up?  Would it seem horribly dated?  Would it seem hokey?  And when it arrived, I tore it open and started watching.Season One could have been a self-contained miniseries as it has a beginning, a middle and an end.  The pilot is well done but seems a little unsure of itself as do the first few episodes.  While the Vietnam war was often a backdrop for the show rather than being front and center, the USO plotlines, one character's search for a missing family member and the character's love lives often take center stage.  It's an uneven season that finds it's footing about four episodes in.  And from there we go onto Season Two which redefines the characters( Lila suddenly becomes a Major even though if you watch carefully in Season One, there is never any indication that she is military), disposes of characters, brings new blood in and takes the bold step of killing off one of the major players.  It was at this point a lot of people started saying the show was ""too depressing"" but I loved it.  And then we got to Season Four which changed all the rules and showed us the ""ever after"" which, for too many, wasn't ""happily.""I am glad we finally have a chance to see the show again.  I love having the entire set so we don't have to wait forever for another season which may not show up due to ""poor sales"" (ahem, ""Knots Landing."")

621828,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JMSD,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[162, 169]","NOTE:  Don't Overpay Through Second Hand Sellers, Go Right To The Source: ChinaBeachonDVD.Most people who have patiently awaited the DVD release of ""China Beach"" probably don't have to be told what a fantastic show it was. Debuting in 1988 and running for four seasons, the show constantly challenged its viewers and thwarted conventional expectations. In my opinion, it was one of the three defining shows of its era in terms of sheer ambition, gritty realism, and emotional impact. I remember episodes from the initial run as if I had seen them yesterday, and that says a lot for a program celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary! ""China Beach"" became one of the most requested unreleased programs on the popular website TVShowsOnDVD and so it's fair to say that expectations were high for this DVD debut. Part of the delay, I'm sure, was negotiating the rights to the many songs that were featured during its broadcast run. And unlike some other popular shows of the era (Northern Exposure, for example), they didn't want to make arbitrary substitutions for the DVD release. If you remember the show, the music was absolutely integral to its storytelling.Availability/Pricing: Although some secondary sellers may be offering ""China Beach"" here, be careful of the price point. This is a Time Life exclusive through Star Vista (at least initially) so you might find a better price from the source if you do a quick Internet search on Time Life and China Beach. Suggested selling price for the Complete Series is 199.95 with a Collector's Edition available at 274.95. Sadly, I went only with the Complete Series, but I would have LOVED the Collector's Edition! Secondary sellers might be offering it at higher price points, I just wanted you to be aware of what it should cost!Packaging: The DVD case is really neat. It has a helicopter hovering over a calm sea at twilight and everything is bathed in orange. The cover has a silhouette of a female body with two China Beach dog tags in the third dimension. This flap is magnetized and snaps shut very nicely. Inside are five individually packaged and wrapped DVD cases. One is for each Season and One for Bonus Material. Also included is a 36 page booklet that introduces major characters, contains insightful remembrances and even has a section for fan feedback.Versions:(1) The Complete Series: As described above under packaging.(2) The Collector's Edition: This has the show, of course, just as described above but also includes some really nice memorabilia as well. There are three complete commemorative scripts from the pilot ""China Beach,"" the episode ""Vets,"" and the finale ""Hello, Goodbye."" They have reproduced signatures from the entire cast. And there are also five eight by ten cast photos, both in the day and at a recent reunion.DVD Content: 21 discs representing all 62 episodes of the ""China Beach"" run plus over 10 hours of Bonus Features. 268 songs were cleared for use with this release from the original broadcasts!Bonus Features: In the fifth DVD case with 2 DVDs, there is a lot of extra material filled with interviews and featurettes. Included: (1) Five audio commentaries (Pilot Episode, Vets, Souvenirs, F.N.G., and Hello/Goodbye), (2) Season Three Gag Reel, (3) Deleted scenes for two episodes (Souvenirs, Big Bang), (4) 3 Roundtable Discussions with cast and crew, (5) Featurettes and reunion footage from the recent 25th Anniversary celebration, (6) New Interviews with cast and crew, (7) Additional featurettes about both the real China Beach and the one represented, (8) Behind-the-scenes footage of the final China Beach episode. This is just a summary of the material to give you an idea of what to expect and is not meant to be all-inclusive.Personal Reflections: ""China Beach"" was pretty remarkable for a show before the Cable dominated era of TV. Season One looks at things from the perspective of Cherry, a new Donut Dolly. Initially, this character quite irritated me! By the end of Season One, though, the character arc as it was developed (in retrospect) became one of the most powerful things I'd seen. Season Two and Three capitalized on the war experiences of the impeccable Dana Delaney and Marg Helgenberger and were consistently mesmerizing. And the difficult Season Four started to look at the transition home. While sometimes uneven, Delaney was remarkable. Delaney picked up two Emmys and Helgenberger one.Hopefully, some of this information has been instructional in letting you know what was included in the set. I could wax on about the brilliance of ""China Beach"" forever. Even today, the episodes hold up and are very powerful. My highest recommendation, obviously, just watch out where you buy this! There is NO reason to pay above market value for a set that is still readily available!

One major way that shows help enhance the feel and set the tone for an era is with the music.  Herein lies the rub.  For Warner Bros to release the show on DVD as it was originally aired they would have to reacquire the licensing rights to ALL of the music from each individual owner of each songs copyrights.  Every artist or company for each and every song played would have to be paid and contracted to individually.  They (WB) see this as too much of a hassle or cost prohibitive.  The only solution apparently is to replace all the copyrighted music with ""original"" music.  This may not seem like a big deal at first but this idea has RUINED several DVD releases already, Quantum Leap being the most obvious.  This same issue has kept 'The Wonder Years' from DVD for decades.  No solution is in sight.  It always is and always will be all about the money. The only solution is to make it clear to WB that we, the fans, are willing to pay a little extra for the DVDs and make it worth their while.

It has also taken me a while to ""forgive"" that war, separate the men from the politicians/generals making that war, etc.  I am of an age to have contemporaries who fought in VN--who never wanted to talk about it to anyone who didn't go.  I have done a bit of reading first-hand accounts of both the soldiers doing the actual fighting and witnessing, and the women who volunteered to go (nurses, USO, radio jocks, etc.).  Since there seems to be some sort of copyright/legal problem holding up the release of these DVDs, I decided to take a chance with DVDs made in China (sic) which claimed to be playable on US players.  They did, except about half of them were damaged and stopped playing, and at least one was a duplicate (so I'm not sure paying $100 for $50 worth is worth is?).  I found that many of the stories were translated from the varous VN accounts I'd read, making the tv shows more authentic.  Including the after-being-there struggles many vets have gone through.  It was interesting to see how at the beginning when the US first got involved, the soldiers going over were all ""America right or wrong, mom apple pie"" but as the war progressed and got dirtier (can't tell your allies from your enemies), the attitude of the soldiers also changed, as well as the drug use.  So many of the stories were true--including the discussion between the black soldiers about how they were being sent out to die more frequently then any others (which was true), the drinking and bedding that went on, the fatalism.  I hope that someday all the legal stuff gets straightened out because this is an important series the younger generations need to see and now about.  (And as shallow as it may seem, I still think there was some good music back then, also reflective of the feelings about that war.)

621847,A18C1PCR8WUAST,B00005JMSD,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[220, 232]","China Beach set new standards for television realism and quality, illuminating the daily life of the many women in-country whose stories had never been told. Created by William Broyles, Jr. and Charles Sacret Young (Broyles is a Vietnam Vet who has written many things, including the film ""Apollo 13th"" and the recent ""Jarhead""), ""China Beach"" gave us the beautiful but forever damaged nurse Colleen McMurphy (an extraordinarily luminous Dana Delany), K.C. (Marg Helgenberger) a prostitute/businesswoman with a past that has compressed her into a hard, stunning diamond, female soldiers, Red Cross workers, civilians, journalists--all trying to make their mark and do what had never been permitted to them before, and of course lots of men in various states of daily understated acts of bravery (generally called ""heroism"" by non-soldiers), profound friendship, love, and terrible physical and psychic anguish, all desperately trying to deal with who they were in that place at that time. For those who have only seen Robert Picardo on ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" he was exceptional in ""China Beach"" as both a doctor struggling to accept the draft (many doctors were drafted after few volunteered) that traded his quiet life as gynecologist and family man in Boston, to on-the-edge evac hospital surgeon facing wounds no one had ever seen before (much of our current trauma surgery's technique was learnt on the fly in Vietnam), and McMurphy's truest, deepest friend there. The holographic doctor he played never got close to the intensity of this role, and I hope people who missed China Beach someday soon get to see how good he could be. Also great were Jeff Kober (recently seen as the evil magic dealer who hooked Willow on mad mojo on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), as the silent, sensitive uber-grunt, Dodger; Concetta Tomei as Lila Garreau, the career army Major who has left nursing behind in order to try to join the ranks but never makes it to the top; young Nan Woods who, as the ""donut dollie"" who went to Vietnam to find her MIA brother, shone as she was transformed from girl to woman, but who never acted again. I should name them all, and will if this review gets a DVD to go with it. Suffice to say that few of the actors on this show ever got to work at such a level again (including Helgenberger, who may be on the #1- watched show, but whose show isn't even in the same league).China Beach was so vivid and compelling that it was actually taken off the air during Desert Storm out of, apparently, governmental fear that it would generate anti-war feelings here at home (as though those feelings didn't already exist). I don't believe any other show has been taken so seriously. It was cancelled (that it had been on the air was a miracle in the first place), but with plenty of notice in its third season, allowing its creators to go into the future of its main characaters to see how, 25 yrs. later, they were coping (or failing to cope) with their experiences; it also allowed them to place their characters in important moments in history that especially affected vets (such as the Florida Republican Convention where Ron Kovic made his stand). Its final 2-hr. episode ends, appropriately enough, with a reunion that goes beyond the reception hall all the way through a long night drive to the Wall in Washington; we get the pain of Vietnam brought full circle for us, from McMurphy's first fumbling day in-country to a day a lifetime later, with all her former comrades-in-arms with her, weeping in the dawn light at the most astonishing War Memorial ever built. On the drive, we both see and she tells the grown daughter of K.C. about her last day at China Beach: ""I stood there watching before I left--and it was exactly the same as the day I got there,"" along with the moving story of her last patient on what is sadly his final day. During her years there we see her go from genuine optimism about life to paying for that optimism and compassion almost with her life, then, as with the others, unable to stop paying and find some capacity for joy again. McMurphy stands in for all those men and women we lost in one way or another so long ago, so far away, yet still live among us in varying states of wellness.Having chosen to begin the show during the months before the war turned from American hope to American nightmare on 31st Jan 1968(after Tet and its devestation is over, Major Lila Garreau who is ""regular, career Army"" says mournfully, ""We've lost our wonderful, wonderful war.""), the creators were able to show how the morale of the soldiers eroded, how optimism became despair, how an emergency trip home exposes McMurphy to what's happened back in the World, where everything's both changed and just the same--she realizes that what's changed is her: she cannot bear that people are playing tennis as though nothing's wrong; America's willful myopia has become untenable). This myopia is revealed in many ways; even Lila's comment illustrates one of the problems of Vietnam--the generational perception gap that existed on the ground between the ""grunts"" in the field and their clueless superior officers who were still fighting a la WW II. For the grunts, it was never a ""wonderful"" war, but a muddy mess of blood and fear and courage despite it. For the officers, for Washington, it was a mystery that it couldn't be ""won."" Any of those so-called grunts could have told them why it would never be won, but no one asked them, so they slogged on and through it's intimate style, we're with them, with the nurses and doctors who have to try to put them back together when an anti-personnel device made by the VC of nails and screws and sharp bits of metal from a fallen chopper has torn their bodies apart, or after napalm has burnt all their flesh off. It's not always comfortable to watch, but doing so reminds one that this is still what it's like in much of the world (I always watch the ""X-mas, '67, VN"" ep on the 25th of December to remind me of just that), and reminds us that we can't forget. Ever.CB was a gorgeous show that missed nothing, was completely fearless (dealing even with the issue of men who by '69 were shooting themselves in order to get home), and so solidly built on truth and exceptional performances that it has never been forgotten, either. And the stories were told with grace, humor, wit, allowing us to experience the joy of small moments of quiet or wild moments of desperation-tinged fun suddenly interrupted by incoming mortars. Nor were the Vietnamese marginalized or made into caricatures. One of the mysteries of this war is how many of the men fell in love with the people, the country, the culture (see Robert Olen Butler's books) and how many chose to desert the army to join it. Their stories are told, as are those of many Vietnamese. Broyles and Young make sure we don't fool ourselves into easy thinking, but rather examine the whole story. I doubt they'd be allowed such freedom in the current political climate. That they were at all is an exceptional thing. So good was it that many people showed up to participate: Diane Keaton directed the excellent ep ""Fever""; Gary Sinise directed, Kathy Bates played a key role in one of the ""home"" episodes; Chloe Webb, fresh from ""Sid and Nancy"" was a guest star in the pilot and 1st 6 eps; and it was here that Mimi Leder became a director--one whose ER episodes were instantly noticable and who went on to become the first woman action-film director (though I'd have wanted her to make different films).In terms of production values, they were so high that the episode where a main character, Booney, ends up having to go home was perhaps the most difficult, challenging, cinematic television episode ever filmed by that point (1989-90). Its realism is beyond harrowing--one forgets this is ""fiction."" Maybe because it really isn't...I, like another reviewer, still watch all 56 episodes on my tapes, but would really, really like to see it on DVD, with commentary, footage from the war perhaps, and more nurses and female soldiers telling their stories (they did some of this on the show).It feels nearly criminal to have ""Bewitched, season 56"" on DVD, but not this show. Please, please get on it! Thank you!![For Dana Delany fans, might I recommend ""True Women,"" in which she plays the real woman who bravely led the women away from Santa Ana's army in Texas on what was called the Runaway Scrape; ""Light Sleeper,"" where her part is small but her performance excellent, and where she acts again for Paul Schrader, who gave her her first real role in ""Patty Hearst""; ""Wild Palms""; and ""Choices of the Heart: The Margaret Sanger Story"" (M.S. founded Planned Parenthod and suffered for it). Search on her name to get a full list, and watch your Premium Channels for lesser-known movies. She also starred as a Healer in a remake of the film ""Ressurection,"" which I have on tape from TV, but seems never to have been sold. Sadly, she never really has gotten the chance to shine again as she did here. She also writes notes to her fans on the official Dana Delany fan site, for those who care about such things. It's a site worth at least a look, as it's warm and caring and a bit  unusual.]",5,Perhaps the most important show ever on TV,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,9210,"['China', 'Beach', 'set', 'new',
