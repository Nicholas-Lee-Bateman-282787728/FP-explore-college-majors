The plot keeps twisting and turning to keep you guessing and you never know where or when you're going to end up.  Keeps you on your toes, hooked into the drama and laughing at the antics of the characters.  Although this is certainly for the adult world (language and partial nudity) I still really enjoyed it.

1411168,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004IK8F7I,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I'll be honest, I fell in love with ""The Misfits"" on first sight. I like TV that thwarts my expectations. Reading the description of this unabashed British mash-up, one might completely write it off. It sounds as if it could be complete rubbish on paper. But it takes its outlandish premise and runs with it! If you had told me that a show about juvenile delinquents with superpowers would turn into one of my contemporary favorites, I'd have thought you were crazy. Expertly blending ribald comedy with a science fiction theme, ""Misfits"" is easily one of the funniest and most wildly entertaining shows that I've seen in a while. Seriously. And if I were to describe it further, it would sound even sillier. The five central characters in ""Misfits"" meet in a community service group, get caught in a freak electrical storm that juices them with lightning, and awake to realize that their world has changed forever. Actually, not just their world but the world around them as the strange storm has affected others in macabre and hysterical ways. Season One effectively introduced the cast and its episodes centered around the quintet as they started to understand the new world around them.Season Two, like Season One, is comprised of only six episodes. However, a Christmas one-off is also included that will completely redefine things for Season Three. That's a total of seven episodes for this release.In this season, snarky Nathan (the endlessly entertaining Robert Sheehan) finally realizes his super power and it expertly resolves the cliffhanger from the preceding year. Everything that worked so well in Season one is magnified with more intricate story lines. There are a couple of terrific independent episodes featuring Nathan's long lost brother and a villain that seems to have stepped out of a violent video game. But the continuing plot threads are getting more complex. A mysterious masked stranger watches the group and impacts things in a tremendous way. The revelation of his identity and his fate is a series high point that changes the game irrevocably. But this season also marks the public acceptance of super powers with harrowing and unpredictable results. And, as I mentioned, the Christmas Special is a doozy that virtually reboots the entire show in a brilliant fashion!With a cast of talented young actors, it might be tempting to dismiss this as a show exclusively for a younger demographic. And perhaps it is. But as an adult, I think it is an absolute laugh riot. If you like edgier fare (this is rich with colorful language, brief nudity, and wildly inappropriate behavior), I strongly encourage you to give this a look. Remember, though, this is a British production. Some of the references might elude you if you are completely unfamiliar with the pop culture scene across the pond and many of the accents are quite extreme. Although I didn't struggle too much, I have friends that watched the show with subtitles. One of the actresses, in particular, poses quite a challenge. Deciphering her lines is worth it, though, because they are so consistently sharp. (In a later season, the actress Lauren Socha even won a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress). The primary strength of ""Misfits"" is its dialogue. Appearing lowbrow while being incredibly smart is hard to pull off. But there is nothing dumbed down about the show's scripts which are incredibly sophisticated AND utterly profane.Having mentioned Socha and Sheehan, I should also give recognition to Iwan Rheon (sensitive Simon) and Antonia Thomas (Alisha) for getting to display a more heartfelt side this year. A truly great show for adventurous and open-minded viewers.
