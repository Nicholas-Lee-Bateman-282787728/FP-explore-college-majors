I'm a big fan of eric bana, and of certain parts of australian film, but this came out on the average continuum for me.  Several aspects brought it down.  First, a lot of the film was shot through blue or similar filters; that created an overly depressed feeling for me throughout. I get it that its part of a purposeful characterization of chopper, but it was a bit much.  Most, though, was the story and character development.  On one hand, i found myself saying through most of the movie ""so what."" it wasnt' compelling for me, and didn't really drive any emotional connection that connected with me.  we're sort of presented with this chopper guy out of nowhere who at face value, appears to be somewhat timid and given to indecision, but yet is also given to random bouts of indiscriminate and unjustified violence. its a character who lacked believability, and i understand that that might be part of the story anyway, but still weird.  so irrespective of the disconnect between chopper's character and my expectations of real human stories, the story lacked a compelling catch to bring this into the 4/5 star level.  certainly worth a rental, but don't expect huge drama.",3,"Enjoyable, but a solid 3 star",1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,1234,"['Unfortunately', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'average', 'review', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'eric', 'bana', 'certain', 'parts', 'australian', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'average', 'continuum', 'Several', 'aspects', 'brought', 'down', 'First', 'lot', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'blue', 'similar', 'filters', 'created', 'overly', 'depressed', 'feeling', 'get', 'part', 'purposeful', 'characterization', 'chopper', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'Most', 'though', 'was', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'hand', 'i', 'found', 'saying', 'most', 'movie', 'so', 'what', 'wasnt', 'compelling', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'drive', 'emotional', 'connection', 'connected', ""'re"", 'sort', 'presented', 'chopper', 'nowhere', 'who', 'face', 'value', 'be', 'somewhat', 'timid', 'given', 'indecision', 'yet', 'also', 'given', 'random', 'bouts', 'indiscriminate', 'unjustified', 'violence', 'character', 'who', 'lacked', 'believability', 'i', 'understand', 'might', 'be', 'part', 'story', 'anyway', 'still', 'weird', 'so', 'irrespective', 'disconnect', 'chopper', 'character', 'expectations', 'real', 'human', 'stories', 'story', 'lacked', 'compelling', 'catch', 'bring', '4/5', 'star', 'level', 'certainly', 'rental', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'huge', 'drama']",N/A

Anybody who can title his book ""How to Shoot Friends and Influence People"" is operating with wry humor and self-awareness at the least.Mark ""Chopper"" Read is a sluggo and a violent-tempered petty criminal.  That his violence is carried out on other brutal criminals, junkies & dope dealers, somewhat mitigates our initial shock (the opening of the film gets right to it).  These are a bunch of louts doing unto each other.  So, in the long run, who really gives a damn.  But, there is the wry humor and that saves the day.The DVD has some scenes with the real Chopper Read, older and living on a farm gotten, no doubt, from the phenomenal sales of his books.

I Held my head high and Recited Half the films dialogue in the Thickest Australian Accent I could do. (A Steady diet of American films since birth has virtually given me an American Accent)Mark &quot;Chopper&quot; Reed is to Australians what Martin &quot;The General&quot; Cahill is to the Irish.

Just how much is True or False has never been reveiled, but The Production of the film is, At All Times, Cleverly Grounded in Reality.While being Frighteningly Realistic and Graphically Violent, &quot;Chopper&quot; is also Unbelieveably Funny. Listening to a Theatre Audience, you'd Swear they were watching a Farrely Brothers film starring Jim Carrey and Eddie Murphy, (man, I'd like that) sure, it's Jet Black Comedy, but it's Laugh-Out-Loud, Hold your Sides comedy.Performance wise, &quot;Chopper&quot; is Oscar Calibre. In a Perfect world, Bana would walk off with the Best Actor Award with Ease. (but in a perfect world, &quot;Best Actor awards would have gone to Christian Bale for &quot;American Psycho&quot; and Edward Nortin for &quot;Fight Club&quot;, Brad Pitt will have to settle for the Supporting Actor award, which he deserved) Bana's performance is Award Winning, Star Making, and Legacy Leaving. Every Performance is Perfectly Fitting, they are all Natural Born Talents.Writing, Directing, Production.. All Expertly Polished. It has the Look and the Feel of a Martin Scorcese Saga. But Unlike alot of those sort of films, it isn't a Tough Watch, you Never feel like your being put through an Ordeal. It Too Much Fun..

Reilly,"[6, 7]","That's usually the first thing a genuinely contrite Mark Brandon Read says to his victim after whatever horrific act of violence he's just perpetrated on them, such as stabbing them repeatedly in the face.....Chopper tells Read's story, as he goes from jailhouse loser to Aussie celebrity and best-selling author. Along the way we get to see the aforementioned face stabbing, a face-shotgunning, ears being cut/torn/pulled off, genital exposing, girlfriend beating, and other charming behavior from the genial killer, called Chopper (I presume) because of his propensity for chopping off people's toes with bolt-cutters.I consider myself pretty strong-stomached, but there were a few scenes in Chopper that made me cringe, especially the ear scene. (In his audio commentary, the real-life Chopper hilariously tells where Quentin Tarantino went wrong with his legendary ear scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"".) The title character is vividly brought to life by Eric Bana, who will probably become well-known for his upcoming role in Ang Lee's Hulk movie, but deserves recognition for his absolutely stunning performance here. Bana gained over thirty pounds over the course of filming, and the transformation he undergoes is stunning, and rates alongside Robert De Niro's celebrated turn in ""Raging Bull"". Bana is THAT good....The film is WAY too short, and glosses over a lot of details that the filmmakers probably assumed the audience would already know. The box says Chopper's Mom was devoutly religious, but it's never mentioned in the film, and the way the Cops let this mad-dog roam free just defies belief; Bana brings such barely controlled rage and violence to the part that it's hard to believe anyone would go within 100 feet of this guy! But as the ""Weekend with Chopper"" featurette shows, the real Read is a pretty charming guy when he wants to be. (Check out his reaction to the film's projected 2000 release date, though- If I were Bana, I would have got up and run for the hills!) I don't know how much of Read's recollections are really true, but I'll tell you what: True or not, he scares the hell out of me.The DVD features seperate audio commentaries by the Director & Read, deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, and the ""Weekend with Chopper"" featurette.

I could only laugh at a review that dismissed it as sophomoric tripe and attempts supporting his argument citing the film's lack of realism in violence.Although based on a real man this is storytelling cinema not documentary. There is an obvious element of gross exaggeration in most of the scenes of violence in Chopper, which serve a purpose (or, more specifically, several purposes). The title character is obviously incapable of telling the truth - perhaps of even hearing the truth.It is, at first, difficult to figure out why so many are drawn to Chopper (and not at all difficult to see why so many wish him dead). Within the first few moments Eric Bana establishes Chopper's character in a way that reveals the off kilter charisma that some simply cannot resist. Those Chopper seems to get along with best are those on the periphery, those who don't invest too much whom he nonetheless seems intent on impressing. Those too involved with him likewise are locked into his doom as no one is able to keep up with the mythological figure Chopper has invented himself into.Darkly humorous, brutal, yet not without pathos the film rightly focuses on its central character and lives up to the unlikely hero's motto: never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn. &quot;Chopper&quot; is a fascinating film filled several amazing performances even in smaller roles. Likewise is it filled with wonderful moments that pop right off the screen, as when Chopper's friend, Jimmy's chain smoking, junkie, white trash, pregnant fianc&eacute;e stumbles to the floor to pick up a sawed off shot gun in the hallway.

673057,A37DLVPKJZGSQF,B00005OSMX,Hannibal,"[2, 3]","Based on the shockingly true story of Australian killer Mark ""Chopper"" Read, Chopper the movie had a lot of controversy around the world. Being given R18 ratings and NC-17's as well as leaving audiences jaws dropped, surprisingly, people still liked it. I was one of those people, Chopper left me stunned, informed and sick - in a good way. It's a great achievement for Australian cinema, but not for filmmaking in general. The flaw I found in this film that is major enough to put in this review with probably be the fact that the audience doesn't at all times get the interpretation of what just happened.

Never mind the chaotic, choppy (no pun intended) plot and the abrupt, anti-climactic ending.  The bottom line: &quot;Chopper&quot; is a fascinating and immensely entertaining film.The best thing about this film, without a doubt, is Eric Bana in the titular role.

It is a bit difficult to understand in some parts, I know I had to watch it twice to fully understand the movie. It is a frightening but funny look into the life of Mark ""Chopper"" Read. Eric Bana is magnificant as Chopper Read. If you do not like the story line of the film you will at least love Bana's performance. I was amazed by the way Bana was able to change from a madman to being almost child-like. You will see this in one of the first scenes when Chopper repeatedly stabbes an inmate, Keithy George, in the face and neck, then walks off and turns back to see him bleeding to death and asks in a heartbroken voice ""You alright Keithy?"" The sudden concern in Chopper's voice is sad but funny at the same time. I was not sure if I should laugh or cry. Watching this movie will really make you wonder what goes on in the Mind of Chopper Read. I really enjoyed this movie and recommened it to my stepdad because it seemed like his kind of movie, but neither he nor my mom enjoyed it as I did.

673062,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005OSMX,Jeffrey Leach,"[19, 20]","""Chopper"" is one of the more interesting films I have seen in the last year or two. An Australian picture, the movie purports to tell the story of one of that country's most notorious criminals. Films dealing with criminals or the crime underworld are far from rare, of course, as one need only to look to ""The Godfather,"" ""Goodfellas,"" or practically anything made by Quentin Tarentino for proof of this assertion. ""Chopper"" differs from these films in several significant ways. Arguably the most important distinction involves how we should perceive criminals. American films, perhaps tapping our age-old love of the outlaw, tend to glamorize the ugly brutality of criminal pathology. The Godfather films don't do this as much as Tarentino's pictures do, to be sure, but it's always there in some form or another. ""Chopper"" can't help but deal with the very public side of Mark Brandon ""Chopper"" Read, considering he published a series of smash bestsellers detailing his sordid adventures, but a close examination of the film reveals a very subtle portrait decrying a thug and the society that idolizes them.When we first meet Chopper Read (Eric Bana), he's serving a sentence in prison. Just as in American penitentiaries, Australian lock-ups have gangs, and Chopper is on the bad side of a particularly loathsome brute. What to do in such a situation? Why, walk up to the chap in the commons and stab him repeatedly in the throat with a sharp object! Moreover, when the guy thrashes on the floor in a spreading pool of blood, look concerned, ask if he's o.k., and offer him a cigarette. Obviously, the authorities don't take kindly to inmates carving up other inmates, so they haul Chopper and a couple of his pals in for questioning. Someone must take the fall for the crime, which gives Chopper's pal Jimmy Loughnan (Simon Lyndon) an absolute fit. This guy comes up with a brilliant plan: lure Read into a personal ""conference"" and murder him with a knife. By doing this dastardly deed, Jimmy can pin the rap on Chopper and skate out from under a conspiracy charge. And he tries to do just that in one of the film's most chilling scenes. Jimmy stabs Chopper repeatedly to no avail. Instead of screaming, clutching his gut, or going after his friend Chopper merely looks at Jimmy with a hurt expression on his face. The betrayal of a pal doing such a nasty bit of work hurts Read more than the knife wounds.Or does it? We can never be absolutely sure what Chopper thinks because he's an incurable psychopath. After taking the fall for the prison killing, Read serves more time but eventually gets a coveted transfer to a less harsh facility when he has a fellow inmate hack his ears off. Exactly. He hacks his ears off. If that won't get you out of the stir, I don't know what will. Anyway, Chopper eventually returns to his life on the streets. By this time, he has his teeth capped with metal and looks even more frightening. He promptly strikes up a relationship with Tanya (Kate Beahan), a harridan of some repute, and just as promptly beats her and her mother senseless after she rebuffs him. He even pays a visit to his old pal Jimmy who, it should go without saying, is less than enthusiastic about a reunion. Read doesn't seem to do much except visit with his father, terrorize people, and look for a way to put some money in his pocket. He's obviously not the type to work a normal job, not with his explosively violent temperament. Here's a guy who goes to a dealer's house, shoots the guy in the legs, and then drives him to a hospital. Not your average corporate type.At the same time, Mark ""Chopper"" Read is a charming rogue, a doughty yet loveable goon covered in tattoos and scars sporting a smile sure to win over the hardest hearts. You can't help but like the guy considering his sense of humor, his aw shucks attitude, and his concern for friends and foes alike. What other criminal would drive one of their victims to the hospital? Or express such remorse over the harm he causes his girlfriend? What a guy! Isn't Chopper a great chap! Sure, he kills, robs, maims, and brutalizes people, but his winning personality makes everything acceptable in the end. That would be the Quentin Tarentino take on Mark Read. Fortunately, director Andrew Dominik doesn't take that position. He does play up a sort of running black humor about the proceedings, but we never come to feel anything but revulsion for this character. A wistful grin and a sudden remorse over a violent crime never fully absolve Read of our scorn. The final shot of the film, where we see Chopper once again in a prison cell yakking it up with a few guards about his latest television interview, underscores our initial impressions of the big fellah. He's exactly where he needs to be no matter how charismatic and charming his personality. Thank goodness for prisons!Eric Bana should have won some awards for his portrayal of this depraved goon. He disappears into the character, a fact confirmed after watching the brief interviews with the real Chopper included on the DVD. Also included in the extras are deleted scenes and an audio commentary with director Dominik and Chopper himself. A violent film not suitable for the squeamish or small children, ""Chopper"" nonetheless is an intriguing effort that acknowledges the tendency of society to idolize criminals while ultimately consigning that foolish notion to the ash heap.",5,Intense,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,5416,"['Chopper', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'last', 'year', 'two', 'Australian',

Chopper is dimentionally entertaining and opened me up to this whole new world of the once psycho Mark Chopper Reid.Andrew Dominik tells the story in a very new and interesting way, the film is very conversational and seems to highlight only the most substantial moments in Reids life. Through many outstanding performances the film is made very realistic and is as if your standing right there watching it.Now i've got to add credit to Eric Bana for his performance in the film, It is absolutely incredible in my opinion, one of the best performances to date. When you watch it its as if he has just shapeshifted himself magically to mould another person, he is nothing alike to the person that he is in real life its awesome. Its a no wonder after him doing this film he has never had to do another audition for other films. BRILLIANT!This film along with comedy, drama and the true story telling side of it, is accually realistically bloody so it aint for the faint hearted but nether the less the movie is great and most will enjoy it.

I never thought he'd pull it off. You see Eric was a very well known stand up comic in Australia and had appeared in many television sketch shows before breaking into his first film role in 'the castle'. It wasn't until I actually saw the movie chopper you get an appreciation of what a great actor Eric really is.Being a comic actor also enables Eric to mimic characters, and he has copied Chopper Read very well, right down to every fine detail. His look, walk, speech and even his laugh. You can see in the special features when Eric meets the real Chopper Read, the way he soaks up everything Mark has to say, his look of intent in his eyes learning everything about his character. There was also the 4 hours of make-up each morning before shoot getting all his skin tattooed for the camera. And the 3 months binge eating of junk food to gain the extra 30 kgs needed to play the older chopper in the movie.I would have to say this is the best acting by an Australian in a long time and Im so glad he is getting the the recognition he deserves.As far as the movie goes itself, I would say it is a dark comedy, often violent at times and contrary to belief it is actaully about 80% true. It is a good insight into the mind of psychotic social misfit.The special features are excellent with two audio commentaries. One by the director and another by chopper himself, which itself is very entertaining to listen to. A great insight.There is also a trailer, deleted scenes and A weekend with Chopper - when the director and star Eric Bana interviewed chopper on his farm in Tasmania.A great movie, also look out for Vince Colosimo who plays Neville Bartos.

Here you get to do just that as first time independent director Andrew Dominik takes us into the quite twisted world of a guy who really has fallen on the wrong side of the tracks.This is a good character study of a man who has deep-seeded psychological problems of the psychopathic paranoid personality disorder kind and who does not shy away from getting hold of a screwdriver to make himself feel better, only to end up feeling worse by end of his latest homicide.Chopper is set in the more backward areas of Australia and is loosely based on the best-selling autobiography of the same name. This is a mash of fiction and reality and at times it is hard to see which is which as Chopper tells his stories from several different angles and several different versions result. The film starts in a prison and has some very horrific violent scenes. Chopper does some nasty mutilations to himself and gets paroled. When out he just can not control his anger and paranoia and ends up doing nasty things to people who he... well... loves... in a sort of strange way because all of his ""friends"" are either skanks, hookers, drug dealers or cops.The film sort of plays itself out ""Pulp Fiction"" style and for a first timer this Indy film has lots of great camera work and lighting. Chopper looks great and the atmosphere is all there. Chopper does not really have a story per se. It is just about Chopper and Bana is almost in every frame and steals every frame too. By the closing credits you come away quite attached to this character. He is like you gone wrong. You feel sorry for the guy.This is what got Bana noticed and it is not hard to see why. Chopper is a great piece of character driven Indy cinema and Bana does the psycho in aces. He also goes from thin to fat like De Niro.

673075,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005OSMX,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Chopper (Andrew Dominik, 2000)Andrew Dominik makes his writing and directing debut with the fictionalized biography of Mark &quot;Chopper&quot; Read, well-known Australian criminal and bestselling novelist. Eric Bana, soon to be seen in a theater near you in Ang Lee's version of The Hulk, stars as Chopper, a man who dreams of being the world's best-known (and loved) criminal. Problem is, he just can't seem to get anyone to take him seriously. The astute viewer will spend much of the film wondering why, and then realized that the &quot;fictionalized&quot; part of the biography is Chopper himself; it would be hard to argue with the hypothesis that, if Chopper were really as witty and intelligent as the film makes him out to be, he probably WOULD be the world's best-known and best-loved criminal. Bana throws one-liners even faster than Red Skelton did, and he rarely misses a good shot (verbally, anyway). Through the eyes of Dominik, Mark Read really is the &quot;good bloke down on his luck&quot; in which he's portrayed in interviews.Then the astute viewer starts thinking. Is this really the case of hero worhsip that it seems to be? The script says yes; the direction, on the other hand, says Dominik is just as astute a filmmaker as he expects his viewers to be. Between the lines of the script are beautiful nonverbal depitcions of the hopelessness and frustration that dog Chopper's every footstep, from the look on Bana's face during the initial confrontation to the film's last shot, of Read sitting alone in a cell, backlit and looking as forlorn as the day is long. Dominik is obviously very familiar with the conventions of noir, and he uses them here effectively, giving the movie a depth and flavor that turns it from an enjoyable romp through one man's megalomania into a more balanced portrait. Very nicely done, and hopefully (assuming Read isn't as astute as the rest of the viewers, natch) we'll be hearing more from Dominik in the future. *** 1/2",4,Surprisingly subtle filmmaking,1008115200,"12 12, 2001",2001,1976,"['Chopper', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', '2000', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'writing', 'directing', 'debut', 'fictionalized', 'biography', 'Mark', 'quot', 'Chopper', 'quot', 'Read', 'well-known', 'Australian', 'criminal', 'bestselling', 'novelist', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'soon', 'be', 'seen', 'theater', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'version', 'Hulk', 'Chopper', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'world', 'best-known', 'loved', 'criminal', 'Problem', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'anyone', 'take', 'seriously', 'astute', 'viewer', 'will', 'spend', 'much', 'film', 'wondering', 'why', 'then', 'realized', 'quot', 'fictionalized', 'quot', 'part', 'biography', 'Chopper', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'argue', 'hypothesis', 'Chopper', 'were', 'really', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'probably', 'WOULD', 'be', 'world', 'best-known', 'best-loved', 'criminal', 'Bana', 'one-liners', 'even', 'faster', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'did', 'rarely', 'good', 'shot', 'verbally', 'anyway', 'eyes', 'Dominik', 'Mark', 'Read', 'really', 'quot', 'good', 'bloke', 'down', 'luck', 'quot', 'portrayed', 'interviews.Then', 'astute', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'really', 'case', 'hero', 'worhsip', 'be', 'script', 'yes', 'direction', 'other', 'hand', 'Dominik', 'just', 'astute', 'filmmaker', 'viewers', 'be', 'lines', 'script', 'are', 'beautiful', 'nonverbal', 'depitcions', 'hopelessness', 'frustration', 'Chopper', 'footstep', 'look', 'Bana', 'face', 'initial', 'confrontation', 'film', 'last', 'shot', 'Read', 'sitting', 'alone', 'cell', 'backlit', 'looking', 'as', 'forlorn', 'day', 'long', 'Dominik', 'obviously', 'very', 'familiar', 'conventions', 'noir', 'here', 'effectively', 'giving', 'movie', 'depth', 'flavor', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'one', 'man', 'megalomania', 'more', 'balanced', 'portrait', 'Very', 'nicely', 'done', 'hopefully', 'assuming', 'Read', ""n't"", 'as', 'astute', 'rest', 'viewers', 'natch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hearing', 'more', 'Dominik', 'future', '1/2']",N/A

""Lantana"" was a magnificent foray into human relationships, ""Muriel's Wedding"" was a hilarious romp through marital ones, and ""The Castle"" was a hilarious predicament of a by-the-airport family.Chopper on the other hand starts out without much point, and has most of it left until the end. There's little really to say about a movie where you find your attention held more by the ""Uncle chop-chop"" commentary included on the DVD than the movie itself.The script is very, very flat in its perspective, giving you only a small glimpse of Chopper's life, trying to potray him as a knuckleheaded tough guy.The director's stylistic tricks, like the painfully blue jail in the beginning or the dim-lit red or green effect for pretty much most of the rest of the movie, reek of B-Class cinematography usually seen in Jon Clod Van Dumb movies than the oh-so-cool look that the directors here were obviously going for.Not to mention that this offers next to no insight into the character of Chopper. He comes across as a press-hungry guy out to make a name for himself,  who bumbles along avenging himself for his days in the prison. That's basically 2 guys, and that's it, that's the plot.As if that were not enough, a bit of pizzazz are attempted when this hick dangles his uncle pork chop in a bar sequence. A pretty good motif for the classiness of the movie overall.I guess the only claim to fame that this film could have gone after would be its gory simplicity -- the kind of Terentino-esque raw that made Reservoir Dogs the cult it is. Yet, frankly, Uncle Chop to me comes across as just another idiot who committed crimes that any other petty criminal commits (except for cutting off his own ears, a sign of idiocy to begin with), got caught, wrote a book about it, and lived behind bars anyway.I regreted the 1.5 hours of my life I squandered on this gibberish.",2,WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT,1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,1916,"['love', 'films', 'coming', 'Australia', 'recent', 'years', 'Lantana', 'was', 'magnificent', 'foray', 'human', 'relationships', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'was', 'hilarious', 'romp', 'marital', 'ones', 'Castle', 'was', 'hilarious', 'predicament', 'by-the-airport', 'family.Chopper', 'other', 'hand', 'out', 'much', 'point', 'most', 'left', 'end', 'little', 'really', 'say', 'movie', 'where', 'find', 'attention', 'held', 'more', 'Uncle', 'chop-chop', 'commentary', 'included', 'DVD', 'movie', 'itself.The', 'script', 'very', 'very', 'flat', 'perspective', 'giving', 'only', 'small', 'glimpse', 'Chopper', 'life', 'trying', 'potray', 'knuckleheaded', 'tough', 'guy.The', 'director', 'stylistic', 'tricks', 'painfully', 'blue', 'jail', 'beginning', 'dim-lit', 'red', 'green', 'effect', 'pretty', 'much', 'most', 'rest', 'movie', 'reek', 'B-Class', 'cinematography', 'usually', 'seen', 'Jon', 'Clod', 'Van', 'Dumb', 'movies', 'oh-so-cool', 'look', 'directors', 'here', 'were', 'obviously', 'going', 'for.Not', 'mention', 'next', 'insight', 'character', 'Chopper', 'across', 'press-hungry', 'guy', 'make', 'name', 'who', 'avenging', 'days', 'prison', 'basically', '2', 'guys', 'plot.As', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'bit', 'pizzazz', 'are', 'attempted', 'when', 'hick', 'uncle', 'pork', 'chop', 'bar', 'sequence', 'A', 'pretty', 'good', 'motif', 'classiness', 'movie', 'overall.I', 'guess', 'only', 'claim', 'fame', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'would', 'be', 'gory', 'simplicity', 'kind', 'Terentino-esque', 'raw', 'made', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'cult', 'frankly', 'Uncle', 'Chop', 'as', 'just', 'idiot', 'who', 'committed', 'crimes', 'other', 'petty', 'criminal', 'commits', 'cutting', 'off', 'own', 'ears', 'sign', 'idiocy', 'begin', 'got', 'caught', 'wrote', 'book', 'lived', 'bars', 'anyway.I', 'regreted', '1.5', 'hours', 'life', 'squandered', 'gibberish']",N/A

The story, although based on 'Choppers' own books has been spiced up for the film, so some of the events depicted may never have happened. That said its an adrenalin filled film which never lets up in its intensity, which is mostly down to a superb performance by Eric Bana. His portrayal captures the schzoid nature of 'Chopper' who after shooting you, was just as likely to take you to a hospital.With its relentless nature and short running time of only 90 minutes you'll find that the film is over very quickly. I felt the film could have continued a little longer (very unusual for me) so for me the ending was a bit of dissappointment.

Some attempt has been made to stick to the verifiable facts, but the film is aware that Read is one who never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn and instead the film focuses on his genuinely mercurial personality: this is the kind of man who'll come round for a friendly drink, shoot you, rob you and then drive you to hospital. Eric Bana is truly amazing in the lead, showing a range and power and sheer star quality that serves the part rather than submerges it that Hollywood has yet to properly tap into. You only have to check out the interview with the real 'Chopper' included on the DVD to see just how on the money his performance (not just an impersonation) is. Andrew Dominik's impressive direction is stylish and adventurous without ever losing grip of his material, whether shooting coke-fuelled dialog scenes at high speed in a brilliant rendition of a cocaine rush or playing Chopper's account of a murder as a nursery rhyme.
