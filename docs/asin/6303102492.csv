356515,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6303102492,Byron Kolln,"[10, 11]","PINKY was Jeanne Crain's greatest movie role, the story of a young African American woman whose light complexion causes friction in her small Southern community.  Patricia Johnson, nicknamed `Pinky' for obvious reasons, returns home after several years of studying nursing up north, where she was able to pass and live as white without the day-to-day prejudices.  Pinky's return is bittersweet when her mixed race is continually pointed out and used against her.  After nursing the dying Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore), she inherits her stateley mansion, but the will is contested forcing Pinky to endure a humiliating trial, where she is effectively fighting for her rights as a human being.  PINKY is a powerful study of human prejudice and greed, a remarkable film for it's time, and still stands up well today.Jeanne Crain finally got the respect she deserved in Hollywood, with her portrayal of Pinky. One of Twentieth Century-Fox's main contract players, Crain had previously been cast in uncomplicated, one-note ingenue roles in films like ""State Fair"", ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" and ""Leave Her to Heaven"".  Crain was helped no end by talented director Elia Kazan in shaping and developing the demanding and, at times, gritty role of Pinky.  Playing Pinky's loving grandmother Dicey, Ethel Waters brings a quiet dignity and strength to every scene; and Ethel Barrymore adds a great deal of humour and heart to the misunderstood Em.  All three ladies were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances, but this is much much more than a ""women's picture"".  Nina Mae McKinney and William Lundigan (playing Pinky's white boyfriend) offer top supporting turns.The new DVD from the Fox `Cinema Classics Collection' handsomely packages the film in a cardboard slipcase (featuring the original poster art), audio commentary with historian Kenneth Geist and an envelope containing 4 postcard-sized lobby card reproductions.",4,landmark Hollywood drama,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,1920,"['PINKY', 'was', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'greatest', 'movie', 'role', 'story', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'woman', 'light', 'complexion', 'friction', 'small', 'Southern', 'community', 'Patricia', 'Johnson', 'nicknamed', 'Pinky', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'returns', 'home', 'several', 'years', 'studying', 'nursing', 'up', 'north', 'where', 'was', 'able', 'pass', 'live', 'white', 'day-to-day', 'prejudices', 'Pinky', 'return', 'bittersweet', 'when', 'mixed', 'race', 'continually', 'pointed', 'out', 'used', 'nursing', 'dying', 'Miss', 'Em', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'stateley', 'mansion', 'will', 'contested', 'forcing', 'Pinky', 'endure', 'humiliating', 'trial', 'where', 'effectively', 'fighting', 'rights', 'human', 'being', 'PINKY', 'powerful', 'study', 'human', 'prejudice', 'greed', 'remarkable', 'film', 'time', 'still', 'up', 'well', 'today.Jeanne', 'Crain', 'finally', 'got', 'respect', 'deserved', 'Hollywood', 'portrayal', 'Pinky', 'One', 'Twentieth', 'Century-Fox', 'main', 'contract', 'players', 'Crain', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'cast', 'uncomplicated', 'one-note', 'ingenue', 'roles', 'films', 'State', 'Fair', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'Leave', 'Her', 'Heaven', 'Crain', 'was', 'helped', 'end', 'talented', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'shaping', 'developing', 'demanding', 'times', 'gritty', 'role', 'Pinky', 'Playing', 'Pinky', 'loving', 'grandmother', 'Dicey', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'strength', 'scene', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'great', 'deal', 'humour', 'heart', 'misunderstood', 'Em', 'three', 'ladies', 'were', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'performances', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'women', 'picture', 'Nina', 'Mae', 'McKinney', 'William', 'Lundigan', 'playing', 'Pinky', 'white', 'boyfriend', 'offer', 'top', 'supporting', 'turns.The', 'new', 'DVD', 'Fox', 'Cinema', 'Classics', 'Collection', 'handsomely', 'film', 'cardboard', 'slipcase', 'featuring', 'original', 'poster', 'art', 'audio', 'commentary', 'historian', 'Kenneth', 'Geist', 'envelope', 'containing', '4', 'postcard-sized', 'lobby', 'card', 'reproductions']",Pinky VHS

356526,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,6303102492,Jeff  Farrow,"[2, 2]","PINKY has already been covered by great reviews here, so I'll try to be brief. Made in 1949 (black & white), this film was about 12 years before the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement in the South. For younger people today who don't know what it was like to be black in the South--it was HELL. The level of white ignorance & sheer hatred (in many instances) was terrible, and could be downright horrific. Fortunately, we've all come a LONG way from those days. However, in 1949 this film is of great documentary value; but don't let that scare you off, it's a great movie too. Top notch actors, script & direction. It's even got a great court  scene near the end.OK. So all else I have to say is this: I read a review where a black reviewer expressed dissatisfaction that a black woman wasn't cast in the lead role (""Pinky"" is a black woman who easily ""passes"" as white & has a blond hunk, Northern boy friend.) I won't comment on that--but what did impress me about the movie was how successfully Jeanne Crain's acting, subtle make-up & hair, Elia Kazan's skilled direction & production lighting created an authenticity of the racial theme. There were times, particularly in profile, when it really looked like an African American was acting the role.That's it. Considering the people who were involved in the production--and its' theme, of course--PINKY is a video document reflecting American cultural history.PS.The romantic interest with the hunk doctor doesn't quite pan out, but the movie's got a upbeat ending anyway.Imitation Of Life (Two-Movie Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)Lady in White (Director's Cut)RAINTREE COUNTYRoots (Four-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)",5,"Great Movie Now, Astonishing Film Then",1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,1730,"['PINKY', 'already', 'been', 'covered', 'great', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ll"", 'try', 'be', 'brief', 'Made', '1949', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'was', '12', 'years', 'beginning', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'South', 'younger', 'people', 'today', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'black', 'South', 'was', 'HELL', 'level', 'white', 'ignorance', 'sheer', 'hatred', 'many', 'instances', 'was', 'terrible', 'could', 'be', 'downright', 'horrific', 'Fortunately', ""'ve"", 'come', 'LONG', 'way', 'days', 'However', '1949', 'film', 'great', 'documentary', 'value', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'scare', 'off', 'great', 'movie', 'too', 'Top', 'notch', 'actors', 'script', 'direction', 'even', 'got', 'great', 'court', 'scene', 'end.OK', 'else', 'have', 'say', 'read', 'review', 'where', 'black', 'reviewer', 'expressed', 'dissatisfaction', 'black', 'woman', 'was', ""n't"", 'cast', 'lead', 'role', 'Pinky', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'easily', 'passes', 'white', 'blond', 'hunk', 'Northern', 'friend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'what', 'did', 'impress', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'successfully', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'acting', 'subtle', 'make-up', 'hair', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'skilled', 'direction', 'production', 'lighting', 'created', 'authenticity', 'racial', 'theme', 'were', 'times', 'particularly', 'profile', 'when', 'really', 'looked', 'African', 'American', 'was', 'acting', 'role.That', 'Considering', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'production', 'theme', 'course', 'PINKY', 'video', 'document', 'reflecting', 'American', 'cultural', 'history.PS.The', 'romantic', 'interest', 'hunk', 'doctor', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pan', 'out', 'movie', 'got', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'anyway.Imitation', 'Life', 'Two-Movie', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Universal', 'Legacy', 'Series', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Lady', 'White', 'Director', 'Cut', 'RAINTREE', 'COUNTYRoots', 'Four-Disc', '30th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition']",Pinky VHS
356527,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6303102492,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[11, 13]","When you first look at the cover and the name of the main character you can already tell she is miscast for this role. Then again black people ""passing for white"" was not a new topic for Hollywood in 1949. It was part of the plot of ""Imitation of Life"" in 1934, but in that film, an actual black actress, Fredi Washington, played the role of the young woman who ""passes"" in the white world. In 1949, there were two films dealing with this issue: ""Pinky"" and ""Lost Boundaries,"" and in both cases, the black person was played by a white actor.""Pinky"" stars Jeanne Crain as Pinky Johnson, a black woman who looks white, so much so that she when she studies nursing in New York, she easily enters the white world and becomes involved with a white doctor who wants to marry her. Needing time to think over her situation, she returns home, which is a shack where her grandmother (Ethel Waters) lives in a black section of their southern town. There she is reminded of the prejudice and cruelty she left. When her grandmother asks her to care for an elderly white woman (Ethel Barrymore), hostility between patient and nurse leads to an uneasy bond.This is a great film all the way, magnificently directed by Elia Kazan and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, who loved taking on these controversial social issues. The acting is superb: Jeanne Crain gives the best performance of her career as a woman who comes to grips with her true identity. She is as dignified as she walks through the town, soft-spoken yet strong, refusing to come down to the level of those around her. Ethel Barrymore is the elderly terminally ill woman Pinky reluctantly agrees to care for, and she nearly steals the movie with a no-nonsense performance. She's a woman set in her ways and opinions, but she's fair person who can see the human soul. It's probably the best drawn character in the film.I read that Lena Horne was deemed not white-looking enough. I suggest that the same is true for the beautiful Dorothy Dandridge. There may have been black actresses who looked white enough to play this role, but would anyone have answered such a casting call? Most importantly, ""Pinky"" would not have been made without Jeanne Crain, because Zanuck wanted her to do it, and it's a film that deserved making. The other sticking point in the film is Pinky's fianc&eacute;e, a white doctor. His easy acceptance of her as black - and the fact that she kept it from him - is a weakness in the script. This was done perhaps to highlight that he wanted to her to continue to pass for white, therefore making it clear that Pinky has to the make the decision, but the scenario does not seem believable.You can predict the ending of ""Pinky,"" and despite complaints that it's a typically neat Hollywood one; I found it vastly satisfying as I found the entire experience of watching this truly classic film, ""Pinky.""",4,"""Pinky"" would not have been made without Jeanne Crain.",1158537600,"09 18, 2006",2006,2865,"['When', 'first', 'look', 'cover', 'name', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'already', 'tell', 'miscast', 'role', 'Then', 'again', 'black', 'people', 'passing', 'white', 'was', 'not', 'new', 'topic', 'Hollywood', '1949', 'was', 'part', 'plot', 'Imitation', 'Life', '1934', 'film', 'actual', 'black', 'actress', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'played', 'role', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'passes', 'white', 'world', '1949', 'were', 'two', 'films', 'dealing', 'issue', 'Pinky', 'Lost', 'Boundaries', 'cases', 'black', 'person', 'was', 'played', 'white', 'actor', 'Pinky', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Pinky', 'Johnson', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'white', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'studies', 'nursing', 'New', 'York', 'easily', 'white', 'world', 'involved', 'white', 'doctor', 'who', 'marry', 'Needing', 'time', 'think', 'situation', 'home', 'shack', 'where', 'grandmother', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'black', 'section', 'southern', 'town', 'reminded', 'prejudice', 'cruelty', 'left', 'When', 'grandmother', 'care', 'elderly', 'white', 'woman', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'hostility', 'patient', 'nurse', 'leads', 'uneasy', 'bond.This', 'great', 'film', 'way', 'magnificently', 'directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'produced', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'who', 'loved', 'taking', 'controversial', 'social', 'issues', 'acting', 'superb', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'woman', 'who', 'grips', 'true', 'identity', 'as', 'dignified', 'town', 'soft-spoken', 'yet', 'strong', 'refusing', 'come', 'down', 'level', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'elderly', 'terminally', 'ill', 'woman', 'Pinky', 'reluctantly', 'care', 'nearly', 'steals', 'movie', 'no-nonsense', 'performance', 'woman', 'set', 'ways', 'opinions', 'fair', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'human', 'soul', 'probably', 'best', 'drawn', 'character', 'film.I', 'read', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'was', 'deemed', 'not', 'white-looking', 'enough', 'suggest', 'same', 'true', 'beautiful', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'black', 'actresses', 'who', 'looked', 'white', 'enough', 'play', 'role', 'would', 'anyone', 'have', 'answered', 'casting', 'call', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Pinky', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Zanuck', 'wanted', 'do', 'film', 'deserved', 'making', 'other', 'sticking', 'point', 'film', 'Pinky', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'white', 'doctor', 'easy', 'acceptance', 'black', 'fact', 'kept', 'weakness', 'script', 'was', 'done', 'perhaps', 'highlight', 'wanted', 'continue', 'pass', 'white', 'therefore', 'making', 'clear', 'Pinky', 'make', 'decision', 'scenario', 'not', 'seem', 'believable.You', 'can', 'predict', 'ending', 'Pinky', 'complaints', 'typically', 'neat', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'found', 'vastly', 'satisfying', 'found', 'entire', 'experience', 'watching', 'truly', 'classic', 'film', 'Pinky']",Pinky VHS
356528,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,6303102492,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[9, 10]","Let's start with the casting of Jeanne Crain.  There ARE mixed race women who are as light as Jeanne Crain, but because of the ""one drop rule,"" they were in 1949, and often still today are considered black.  In today's multi-cultural society these women often embrace their heritage, but the issues they face remain sadly the same today in many facets.  African Americans today who are educated are often told they are ""talking white.""There is a reason that ""she's passing"" became an understood term.  Very light skinned women & men DID try to do what Pinky here does.I find this film completely, sadly relevant.  These conversations of segregation and intermarriage are STILL going strong.  There are African Americans who talk about ""white women taking our men"" or ""stay with your own race."" This is segregationist, this is racist, and it still exists very strongly in all racial communities.Dorothy Dandridge and Lena Horne - great talented beauties, are often mentioned as possible contenders for this role.  They were NOT light enough to pass for white, it hampered their careers, and they have both acknowledged that.Hollywood in general likes their races obvious, casting is still largely done by type and stereotype, no matter what race - even today it would be hard to find an actress of stature who identifies herself as black, but who can totally pass as white; the market doesn't hire these women.  Even today my dark skinned actress friends have been told they don't ""talk black enough"" in auditions.  Ethel Waters & Ethel Barrymore are cases in point here.  Both fine actresses are playing the same roles they have played in other movies.  Both are wonderful, both were completely type cast.The greatness is in little things like the scene with Nina Mae McKinney next to Frederick O'Neal, next to Jeanne Crain, all 3 differnet skin tones, all playing black folks.  THAT is the reality of mysogenation in the South, and that is what people still have trouble with:  sometimes race is not just black and white. (McKinney is fantastic, and fills every single second of her screen time to the brim, from the pebble in her shoe to coyly playing piano on the top of a fence.)Jeanne Crain had enormous courage to portray this role.  Not only is she perpetually faulted for being a white woman playing this role, but it was a career risk, some people questioned her heritage in a racist age.  That is a tribute to the reality and sensitivity she brought to the role, and her acting, which is often maligned because she had reserve.  Her ""under"" acting is actually the preferred style today in tv and film.  She was ahead of her time.  Even Kazan eventually credited her work.This movie is sensitively done in all respects with really great performances top to bottom.  It is not glossy or simple, neither race is soley good or soley bad.  It is a disservice to have the only commentary done by someone who clearly still does not like the film and doesn't appreciate the complexity of Crain's work here.  That a New Yorker thought the court trial didn't look real because people were all fanning themselves shows he has never spent time in the south in a public gathering place.This film is gauling and aggrivating, and unfortunately still very real.  While some call it old-fashioned, it is still much too true.  This is not a fun film, it is a great film, that speaks just as much to attitudes held today as it did then.",5,"When this film is not Controversial, we'll know we've arrived.",1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,3427,"['Let', 'start', 'casting', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'ARE', 'mixed', 'race', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'light', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'one', 'drop', 'rule', 'were', '1949', 'often', 'still', 'today', 'are', 'considered', 'black', 'today', 'multi-cultural', 'society', 'women', 'often', 'embrace', 'heritage', 'issues', 'face', 'remain', 'sadly', 'same', 'today', 'many', 'facets', 'African', 'Americans', 'today', 'who', 'are', 'educated', 'are', 'often', 'told', 'are', 'talking', 'white', 'reason', 'passing', 'became', 'understood', 'term', 'Very', 'light', 'skinned', 'women', 'men', 'DID', 'try', 'do', 'what', 'Pinky', 'here', 'find', 'film', 'completely', 'sadly', 'relevant', 'conversations', 'segregation', 'intermarriage', 'are', 'STILL', 'going', 'strong', 'are', 'African', 'Americans', 'who', 'talk', 'white', 'women', 'taking', 'men', 'stay', 'own', 'race', 'segregationist', 'racist', 'still', 'very', 'strongly', 'racial', 'communities.Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'great', 'talented', 'beauties', 'are', 'often', 'mentioned', 'possible', 'contenders', 'role', 'were', 'NOT', 'light', 'enough', 'pass', 'white', 'hampered', 'careers', 'have', 'acknowledged', 'that.Hollywood', 'general', 'likes', 'races', 'obvious', 'casting', 'still', 'largely', 'done', 'type', 'stereotype', 'matter', 'what', 'race', 'even', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'actress', 'stature', 'who', 'black', 'who', 'can', 'totally', 'pass', 'white', 'market', ""n't"", 'hire', 'women', 'Even', 'today', 'dark', 'skinned', 'actress', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'black', 'enough', 'auditions', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'are', 'cases', 'point', 'here', 'fine', 'actresses', 'are', 'playing', 'same', 'roles', 'have', 'played', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'wonderful', 'were', 'completely', 'type', 'cast.The', 'greatness', 'little', 'things', 'scene', 'Nina', 'Mae', 'McKinney', 'next', 'Frederick', ""O'Neal"", 'next', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', '3', 'differnet', 'skin', 'tones', 'playing', 'black', 'folks', 'reality', 'mysogenation', 'South', 'what', 'people', 'still', 'have', 'trouble', 'sometimes', 'race', 'not', 'just', 'black', 'white', 'McKinney', 'fantastic', 'fills', 'single', 'second', 'screen', 'time', 'brim', 'pebble', 'shoe', 'coyly', 'playing', 'piano', 'top', 'fence', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'had', 'enormous', 'courage', 'portray', 'role', 'Not', 'only', 'perpetually', 'faulted', 'being', 'white', 'woman', 'playing', 'role', 'was', 'career', 'risk', 'people', 'questioned', 'heritage', 'racist', 'age', 'tribute', 'reality', 'sensitivity', 'brought', 'role', 'acting', 'often', 'maligned', 'had', 'reserve', 'acting', 'actually', 'preferred', 'style', 'today', 'tv', 'film', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'Even', 'Kazan', 'eventually', 'credited', 'work.This', 'movie', 'sensitively', 'done', 'respects', 'really', 'great', 'performances', 'top', 'bottom', 'not', 'glossy', 'simple', 'race', 'soley', 'good', 'soley', 'bad', 'disservice', 'have', 'only', 'commentary', 'done', 'someone', 'who', 'clearly', 'still', 'not', 'film', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'complexity', 'Crain', 'work', 'here', 'New', 'Yorker', 'thought', 'court', 'trial', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'people', 'were', 'fanning', 'never', 'spent', 'time', 'south', 'public', 'gathering', 'place.This', 'film', 'gauling', 'aggrivating', 'unfortunately', 'still', 'very', 'real', 'call', 'old-fashioned', 'still', 'much', 'too', 'true', 'not', 'fun', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'attitudes', 'held', 'today', 'did', 'then']",Pinky VHS

356535,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6303102492,Lawyeraau,"[161, 164]","This is a landmark film, as it tackled issues that were considered to be taboo at the time. Race hate, miscegenation, and passing for white are some of its themes. Unlike &quot;Imitation of Life (1934), which in its own fashion dealt with the themes of passing for white and the unequal opportunities afforded blacks, this is not a sentimental tearjerker of a movie. Rather, there is an undercurrent of anger and righteousness that permeates it, and rightly so. It is a hard edged, no holds barred type of film. There is nothing sentimental about it.Controversial in its time, the film is about a young bi-racial woman known as &quot;Pinky&quot; (Jeanne Crain), sent up north by her southern granny (Ethel Waters), so that she could receive an education. While up North, she begins passing for white inadvertently, as that is how she is apparently perceived, and makes no move to correct that perception. She studies and works hard, becoming a nurse. She then meets white Dr. Thomas Adams (William Lundigan), and they fall head over heels in love. He has no idea, however, of her background and knows her as &quot;Patricia&quot; not &quot;Pinky&quot;.Pinky, leaving him behind, returns home to the South one last time to confront her past and her personal demons. She ends up meeting bigotry head on, as down South where Pinky is known she is treated as blacks are treated, and does not like it one bit. It hardens her resolve all the more to return North and continue passing for white. She would like nothing better than to put as much distance as is possible between herself and her racial heritage. Helping out her grandmother, however, she ends up playing nurse to Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore), a crotchety, crusty, and ill eighty year old former plantation owner who has come down on hard times.When Miss Em dies, she wills her estate to Pinky, creating a controversy that rocks the town when the will is challenged by distant relatives, the Wooleys. They are outraged and claim that the &quot;colored girl&quot; used undue influence over the elderly Miss Em. This galvanizes Pinky to stand up for her rights, enduring a mockery of a trial. Moreover, when Dr. Adams comes looking for her, Pinky finds herself taking a position with respect to their relationship that is a revelation to herself.This is a film that at the time was highly controversial, due to its themes. It was a film that was certainly daring for its times. Why they cast a white woman for the part of a biracial character may seem puzzling to those of us in the twenty first century. I presume that this casting was mandated because there were love scenes between Pinky and her fiance, Dr. Adams, and this type of scene would have been forbidden in those days, if the actress cast for the part of Pinky were other than white. While a bi-racial woman was cast for the role of Peola, the woman who passed for white, in &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; in 1934, it was a safe bet to do so, as she had no love scenes with which to contend. Notwithstanding the casting of Jeanne Crain in the role of Pinky, this film was cutting edge stuff in 1949.Wonderful performances are given by the entire cast. Ethel Waters, Jeanne Crain, and Ethel Barrymore all received Academy Award nominations for their roles in this film, though none of them won. While Jeanne Crain's casting was a stretch for her as an actress, she did give it her all, letting the viewer sense Pinky's discomfort and angst over the racial divide. Ethel Waters is superb as the hard working, humble soul who did the best that she could for her beloved Pinky. As the imperious Miss Em, Ethel Barrymore was perfectly cast and gives a superlative performance, imbuing the character with a humanity that a lesser actress may not have. All in all, this is a movie that lovers of classic films should enjoy and one that should be in any serious movie lover's collection.",4,TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE...,1017532800,"03 31, 2002",2002,3892,"['landmark', 'film', 'tackled', 'issues', 'were', 'considered', 'be', 'taboo', 'time', 'Race', 'hate', 'miscegenation', 'passing', 'white', 'are', 'themes', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Imitation', 'Life', '1934', 'own', 'fashion', 'dealt', 'themes', 'passing', 'white', 'unequal', 'opportunities', 'afforded', 'blacks', 'not', 'sentimental', 'tearjerker', 'movie', 'Rather', 'undercurrent', 'anger', 'righteousness', 'rightly', 'so', 'hard', 'edged', 'barred', 'type', 'film', 'nothing', 'sentimental', 'it.Controversial', 'time', 'film', 'young', 'bi-racial', 'woman', 'known', 'quot', 'Pinky', 'quot', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'sent', 'up', 'north', 'southern', 'granny', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'could', 'receive', 'education', 'North', 'passing', 'white', 'inadvertently', 'how', 'apparently', 'perceived', 'move', 'correct', 'perception', 'studies', 'hard', 'becoming', 'nurse', 'then', 'white', 'Dr.', 'Thomas', 'Adams', 'William', 'Lundigan', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'idea', 'however', 'background', 'quot', 'Patricia', 'quot', 'not', 'quot', 'Pinky', 'quot', 'leaving', 'home', 'South', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'confront', 'past', 'personal', 'demons', 'up', 'meeting', 'bigotry', 'head', 'down', 'South', 'where', 'Pinky', 'known', 'treated', 'blacks', 'are', 'treated', 'not', 'one', 'bit', 'resolve', 'more', 'return', 'North', 'continue', 'passing', 'white', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'better', 'put', 'as', 'much', 'distance', 'possible', 'herself', 'racial', 'heritage', 'Helping', 'out', 'grandmother', 'however', 'up', 'playing', 'nurse', 'Miss', 'Em', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'crotchety', 'crusty', 'ill', 'eighty', 'year', 'old', 'former', 'plantation', 'owner', 'who', 'come', 'down', 'hard', 'times.When', 'Miss', 'Em', 'estate', 'Pinky', 'creating', 'controversy', 'town', 'when', 'will', 'challenged', 'distant', 'relatives', 'Wooleys', 'are', 'outraged', 'claim', 'quot', 'colored', 'girl', 'quot', 'used', 'undue', 'influence', 'elderly', 'Miss', 'Em', 'Pinky', 'stand', 'up', 'rights', 'enduring', 'mockery', 'trial', 'Moreover', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Adams', 'looking', 'Pinky', 'taking', 'position', 'respect', 'relationship', 'revelation', 'herself.This', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'highly', 'controversial', 'due', 'themes', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'daring', 'times', 'Why', 'cast', 'white', 'woman', 'part', 'biracial', 'character', 'may', 'seem', 'puzzling', 'twenty', 'first', 'century', 'presume', 'casting', 'was', 'mandated', 'were', 'love', 'scenes', 'Pinky', 'fiance', 'Dr.', 'Adams', 'type', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'forbidden', 'days', 'actress', 'cast', 'part', 'Pinky', 'were', 'other', 'white', 'bi-racial', 'woman', 'was', 'cast', 'role', 'Peola', 'woman', 'who', 'passed', 'white', 'quot', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'quot', '1934', 'was', 'safe', 'bet', 'do', 'so', 'had', 'love', 'scenes', 'contend', 'Notwithstanding', 'casting', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'role', 'Pinky', 'film', 'was', 'cutting', 'edge', 'stuff', '1949.Wonderful', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'entire', 'cast', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'roles', 'film', 'none', 'won', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'casting', 'was', 'stretch', 'actress', 'did', 'give', 'all', 'letting', 'viewer', 'sense', 'Pinky', 'discomfort', 'angst', 'racial', 'divide', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'superb', 'hard', 'working', 'humble', 'soul', 'who', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'beloved', 'Pinky', 'imperious', 'Miss', 'Em', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'superlative', 'performance', 'imbuing', 'character', 'humanity', 'lesser', 'actress', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'movie', 'lovers', 'classic', 'films', 'should', 'enjoy', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'serious', 'movie', 'lover', 'collection']",Pinky VHS

The lead role is played to perfection by Jeanne Crain with almost total credibility.  JC returns home for a visit, which becomes somewhat ""extended"". That stay is the basis of the plot. That's all this review will reveal, in the interest of not divulging the resolution.Crain is by far the central character here, ably supported by a fine cast including Ethel Waters as her grandmother and Ethel Barrymore as the dying old woman she is pressed into caring for. ""Pinky"" is well-directed by Elia Kazan.  Continuity from scene to scene is excellent.  Viewer interest is maintained throughout. This is a fast moving movie.  It must have taken courage for Ms. Crain to play such a role back in 1949. I have always liked her pictures and wondered why she never became a major star. JC certainly was a mysteriously attractive woman. One wonders what would have resulted if John Ford remained as the original director. The record will show that the Academy recognized ""Pinky"". Crain was nominated for Best Actress; Waters and Barrymore for Best Supporting Actress.  Statues went instead to Olivia de Haviland for ""The Heiress"" and Mercedes McCambridge for ""All the Kings Men"".The only negative comment this reviewer can muster deals with that strange house review by amazon. What was the writer thinking?  Also, previous reviewer ""Larry C"" (a major Crain devotee) should know that another JC gem, ""Dangerous Crossing"" is indeed available for purchase on amazon.

356547,A3RRMZO2V4G0PE,6303102492,No Name Texan,"[3, 3]","I just watched this movie, and despite inconsistencies that seem to draw criticism from a modern 60 years later perspective, this is a great movie. I am not going to summarize the plot in detail. That is ably done in many reviews, and I don't want to be a major spoiler for someone who just wants a worthiness opinion to consider watching this, and more importantly a perspective to appeciate it.In order to fully appreciate this movie, I think one has to partly watch this movie as if you were in 1949 when it came out. A detachment from the modern makes this movie understandable and believable. Jeanne Crain's portrayal of a black woman is the focus of the central criticism of this movie, but that is easily explained if one considers the scene where she is nearly raped. In fact, there is some subtlety missed by many other reviewers in some of the character portrayals in this move. Does Miss Em know who Pinky's father and grandfather are? Watch the Judge Walker character carefully, brilliantly played by Basil Ruysdael? He seems to know something about Pinky. Kazan was a genius in how he directed this apparent subtlety into the movie, clearly something the producers could never have risked in the script, not in 1949. One couldn't boldly suggest  the rape of successive generations of black women by white men, possibly the same white man, not in 1949. It had to be extremely subtlety played for its time without inciting even more wrath than the film likely did from the bigots of the era. Also revealing too much would have changed the entire message of the movie.Again, Crain is criticized for taking on or being chosen for this role, but she played it beautifully considering the complexities being asked of her. One can again see the hand of Kazan's direction. Also keep in mind the tremendous career risk she took at the time. Many have commented on the inconsistency of a white woman playing a black woman, but would it have worked if an obvious black woman were playing the role and were pretending no one suspected she was black? I don't think so, because we have to believe that Pinky can unambiguously pass for being white as the main premise of the story. What could have greatly reinforced the verisimilitude and character development would have been an earlier scene that might have shown her in the role of faking being white in her job in the north. This could also have made the romantic element more believable.There are weaknesses in this movie. These have been pointed out by others. The love story chemistry is hard to believe between Pinky and her doctor beau. They don't look involved, or look like they have an intimate history they've shared. Also, I agree the scene of their embrace in court is unrealistic in not eliciting violence from the spectators. The seething hate and bigotry are clearly too muted at times.Besides Crain, there are other great performances. Ethel Barrymore has some wonderfully deleivered lines. For those who first see her in this movie, her performance is a real treat. Ethel Waters is great also, but constrained to play her role stereotypically for the time. There is some weakness in the Pinky - grandmother realtionship on screen, but I can't tell whether this is due to Crain, Waters or possibly some conflict with Kazan's direction. Reportedly, Waters was difficult to direct, or at least had a strained realtionship with Kazan, and I sense that Kazan let some scenes slip by unperfected out of exasperation.I strongly recommend this movie. However, one has to think from the perspective of a 1949 viewer who doesn't know the greater truth telling of the civil rights movement or the even greater To Kill A Mocking Bird are in the future. From that perspective, this movie is reality of what risks could be taken in 1949 movie making and fill a theatre. And,  when having difficulty with Crain's casting as Pinky, look for subtlety in how some other characters treat her, and wonder what they might have been able to suggest less subtlety about her father/grandfather if the time was not 1949 America.",5,A great movie if you look for some deeper subtleties,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,4072,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'inconsistencies', 'seem', 'draw', 'criticism', 'modern', '60', 'years', 'later', 'perspective', 'great', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'summarize', 'plot', 'detail', 'ably', 'done', 'many', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'major', 'spoiler', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'worthiness', 'opinion', 'consider', 'watching', 'more', 'importantly', 'perspective', 'appeciate', 'it.In', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'think', 'one', 'partly', 'watch', 'movie', 'were', '1949', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'detachment', 'modern', 'movie', 'understandable', 'believable', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'portrayal', 'black', 'woman', 'focus', 'central', 'criticism', 'movie', 'easily', 'explained', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'nearly', 'raped', 'fact', 'subtlety', 'missed', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'character', 'portrayals', 'move', 'Does', 'Miss', 'Em', 'know', 'who', 'Pinky', 'father', 'grandfather', 'are', 'Judge', 'Walker', 'character', 'carefully', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Basil', 'Ruysdael', 'know', 'something', 'Pinky', 'Kazan', 'was', 'genius', 'how', 'directed', 'apparent', 'subtlety', 'movie', 'clearly', 'something', 'producers', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'risked', 'script', 'not', '1949', 'One', 'could', ""n't"", 'boldly', 'suggest', 'rape', 'successive', 'generations', 'black', 'women', 'white', 'men', 'possibly', 'same', 'white', 'man', 'not', '1949', 'had', 'be', 'extremely', 'subtlety', 'played', 'time', 'inciting', 'even', 'more', 'wrath', 'film', 'likely', 'did', 'bigots', 'era', 'Also', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'entire', 'message', 'movie.Again', 'Crain', 'criticized', 'taking', 'being', 'chosen', 'role', 'played', 'beautifully', 'considering', 'complexities', 'being', 'asked', 'One', 'can', 'again', 'see', 'hand', 'Kazan', 'direction', 'Also', 'keep', 'mind', 'tremendous', 'career', 'risk', 'took', 'time', 'Many', 'have', 'commented', 'inconsistency', 'white', 'woman', 'playing', 'black', 'woman', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'obvious', 'black', 'woman', 'were', 'playing', 'role', 'were', 'pretending', 'one', 'suspected', 'was', 'black', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'have', 'believe', 'Pinky', 'can', 'unambiguously', 'pass', 'being', 'white', 'main', 'premise', 'story', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'greatly', 'reinforced', 'verisimilitude', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'earlier', 'scene', 'might', 'have', 'shown', 'role', 'faking', 'being', 'white', 'job', 'north', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'made', 'romantic', 'element', 'more', 'believable.There', 'are', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'others', 'love', 'story', 'chemistry', 'hard', 'believe', 'Pinky', 'doctor', 'beau', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'involved', 'look', 'have', 'intimate', 'history', ""'ve"", 'shared', 'Also', 'agree', 'scene', 'embrace', 'court', 'unrealistic', 'not', 'eliciting', 'violence', 'spectators', 'seething', 'hate', 'bigotry', 'are', 'clearly', 'too', 'muted', 'times.Besides', 'Crain', 'are', 'other', 'great', 'performances', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'wonderfully', 'deleivered', 'lines', 'who', 'first', 'see', 'movie', 'performance', 'real', 'treat', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'great', 'also', 'constrained', 'play', 'role', 'stereotypically', 'time', 'weakness', 'Pinky', 'grandmother', 'realtionship', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'due', 'Crain', 'Waters', 'possibly', 'conflict', 'Kazan', 'direction', 'Reportedly', 'Waters', 'was', 'difficult', 'direct', 'least', 'had', 'strained', 'realtionship', 'Kazan', 'sense', 'Kazan', 'let', 'scenes', 'slip', 'unperfected', 'exasperation.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'However', 'think', 'perspective', '1949', 'viewer', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'greater', 'truth', 'telling', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'even', 'greater', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mocking', 'Bird', 'are', 'future', 'perspective', 'movie', 'reality', 'what', 'risks', 'could', 'be', 'taken', '1949', 'movie', 'making', 'fill', 'theatre', 'when', 'having', 'difficulty', 'Crain', 'casting', 'Pinky', 'look', 'subtlety', 'how', 'other', 'characters', 'treat', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'suggest', 'less', 'subtlety', 'father/grandfather', 'time', 'was', 'not', '1949', 'America']",Pinky VHS

Pinky has past bitterness towards Miss Em dating back to her childhood yet with reasonable convincing she goes ahead and help nurse Miss Em.  Later you will see the meat and potatoes of the movie start to unfold as you will be introduced to Melba Wooley (Em's gossipy, chatty cousin) and Dr. Thomas Adams (the handsome boyfriend of Pinky).  Both characters play impactful roles into the rising action and climax of the story.  For anyone who finds this picture to be unrealistic or can't see Jeanne Crain being a black woman shouldn't be so far-fetched.  If you look at alot The Fords (US political black family from the south), Quincy Jones children, and director Darnell Martin are quite fair-skinned, almost passing for white.

Walking about her Southern hometown, people on the street and in shops are heard to comment that she can almost pass for white. Of course the actress playing Pinky, Jeanne Crane, IS white! But since she's not supposed to be, the racism and prejudice she is confronted with seem more absurd than ever. One is reminded of the Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson from 1896 where Plessy, who appeared as white as ""Pinky"" but was classified as ""colored"" under the Louisiana code because he was one-eighth black, rode in the ""white"" rail car after making his mixed race known to the conductor. When he refused to move to the ""colored"" car, he was arrested, tried unsuccessfully to overturn the statute in Louisiana, ultimately taking his case to the Supreme Court of the United States. One-eighth black? What does that mean? What percentage of ""African"" blood is required to send a man to the back of a bus or get him arrested for sitting in a ""white only"" railcar? Of course this begs the even greater question - why should any human being be subjected to a different status solely based upon a distinction as insignificant as skin color? Jeanne Crane's performance, almost completely unblemished by emotion and depth of character, seems almost as out of place in this film as believability is in the convoluted script. Still, this film does have a lot to merit a watch, albeit a Timex and not a Rolex! The obvious problems with the film notwithstanding, they do add an interesting degree of relevance, intentional or not, to the subject.

356556,ACM90BRKX73OG,6303102492,Tom,"[3, 4]","Pinky (20th Century Fox, 1949) was director Elia Kazan's fifth film.Always on the lookout for a ""message"" script, 20th Century Fox mogul, Darryl F. Zanuck, followed the success of ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" (Best Picture, 1947), which tackled the issue of anti-Semitism, with ""Pinky"" (1949) a film dealing with racial prejudice against African-Americans.Patricia ""Pinky"" Johnson (Jeanne Crain) returns home to Alabama after graduating from nursing school in Boston. She is mixed race but has absolutely no physical characteristics typical of Blacks and easily passed herself off as White in the North. When her Black Granny, Dicey (Ethel Waters), asks Pinky to nurse her dying friend, Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore), matron of the crumbling former plantation, Pinky acquiesces after some serious misgivings and eventually befriends the old dame. All the while Pinky encounters blatant racism whenever the White townsfolk discover she's actually of mixed race. When her boyfriend from up North tracks her down he is quite surprised to learn from Pinky that she is a mulatto but continues the relationship. After Miss Em's death, the entire town is shocked to learn she willed her estate to Pinky. A judge remarkably (and unbelievably) upholds the will. Rejecting her suitor's invitation to leave the town and her true racial identity behind, Pinky turns the old plantation into ""Miss Em's Clinic and Nursery School"" for Black children.Kazan took over the project as a favor to Zanuck after director John Ford quit over confrontations with Ethel Waters. Pinky would be the last film Kazan would make in a traditional studio setting. All subsequent Kazan movies were shot on location. Kazan mentioned quite often that he disliked Pinky intensely. It was an emasculated morality play. The casting of white-as-the-driven-snow Jeanne Crain ensured there would be few problems showing the film in the South, but it took the teeth out of the picture. Beautiful Jeanne Crain in the arms of William Lundigan was fine but a light-skinned, beautiful African-American such as Lena Horne or Dorothy Dandridge in the arms of Ludigan at that time would have been outrageous. It is certainly difficult for the viewer to suspend belief and accept Crain as dark-skinned Water's granddaughter. But Pinky does portray racism in a convincing manner in several scenes.Controversy aside, the cast is fantastic and I've come to appreciate Pinky a bit more with each viewing. Both Waters and Barrymore, the First Lady of the Theater, were nominated for Oscars for their potrayals. Most memorable in minor roles are Frederick O'Neal as Jake Walters, Evelyn Varden as Melba Wooley, Nina Mae McKinney as the foxy Rozelia, and Basil Ruysdael as Judge Walker. Dan Riss as Wooley's stereotypical Southern lawyer is absolutely delightful. Surprisingly, Crain was nominated for Best Actress for her performance. Kazan disparaged Crain in several of his later writings and interviews. I don't believe he criticized any of his other actors so fiercely. There's no doubt that Crain had an extremely limited emotional scale but one must wonder if there was also something personal behind Kazan's assessment. The closing scene with Crain looking up to Heaven and thanking Miss Em is actually quite touching. Pinky was no minor liberal experiment for Zanuck; it was the second-highest grossing film for Fox in 1949.Kazan was still searching for his signature style when he directed Pinky. He would find it while making his next film, the remarkable film noir thriller, Panic in the Streets.Film historian Kenneth Geist provides an unremarkable commentary for this DVD. His remarks have much more to do with the careers of Waters and Barrymore than with the film itself.

356558,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6303102492,Westley,"[43, 53]","""Pinky"" is one of those old-fashioned ""issues"" movies popular in the 1940s, such as ""Gentlemen's Agreement,"" which tackled anti-semitism (of note, both of these films were directed by the great Elia Kazan).  Unfortunately, these movies don't tend to age particularly well, and even the sympathetic characters often end up looking quite intolerant.  However, we shouldn't dismiss these films summarily, as they obviously had an impact on their audience.Jeanne Crain stars as the title character, a young black woman raised by her grandmother.  Granny (Ethel Waters) is a poor, uneducated Southern washer-woman - the kind of good-hearted woman who cares for sick neighbors without compensation.  When Pinky was a child, Granny saved every penny she could and sent Pinky up north to go to school and escape the harsh life of segregated Alabama.  Pinky is so light-skinned, though, that she begins to ""pass"" as white; when she returns to Alabama, she has a white fianc&eacute; and has been living as a white nurse.Pinky is shocked by her return to the South and suddenly being treated as a second-class citizen again.  Further conflict occurs when Granny asks Pinky to tend to a sick white neighbor - Miss Em (Ethel Barrymore) who lives in a giant, slave-era colonial mansion.  Pinky has memories of Miss Em treating her and the other black children poorly.  Not surprisingly, Pinky refuses to tend to the racist Miss Em, but when Granny insists, an unlikely bond forms between Miss Em and Pinky.  Unfortunately, the plot is awkwardly handled, and the final conflicts are resolved unrealistically.To a modern audience, this movie certainly doesn't offer any answers regarding racial relations; however, the historical perspective is of interest and the acting is fairly good.  A behind-the-scenes drama helps illustrate the status of blacks in 1949 Hollywood - Lena Horne, who was a major star, wanted to play ""Pinky,"" but the producers were not willing to incur the controversy of having a love scene between a black actress and a white actor.  Thus, the white actress Jeanne Crain received the role, as well as a later Oscar nomination.  Overall, ""Pinky"" is a decent 1940s drama of added interest for its history.  I enjoyed the film, despite its being outdated and somewhat creaky.",3,"Old-Fashioned ""Issues"" Movie",1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2280,"['Pinky', 'one', 'old-fashioned', 'issues', 'movies', 'popular', '1940s', 'such', 'Gentlemen', 'Agreement', 'tackled', 'anti-semitism', 'note', 'films', 'were', 'directed', 'great', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Unfortunately', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'tend', 'age', 'particularly', 'well', 'even', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'often', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'quite', 'intolerant', 'However', 'should', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'films', 'summarily', 'obviously', 'had', 'impact', 'audience.Jeanne', 'Crain', 'title', 'character', 'young', 'black', 'woman', 'raised', 'grandmother', 'Granny', 'Ethel', 'Waters', 'poor', 'uneducated', 'Southern', 'washer-woman', 'kind', 'good-hearted', 'woman', 'who', 'sick', 'neighbors', 'compensation', 'When', 'Pinky', 'was', 'child', 'Granny', 'saved', 'penny', 'could', 'sent', 'Pinky', 'up', 'north', 'go', 'school', 'escape', 'harsh', 'life', 'segregated', 'Alabama', 'Pinky', 'so', 'light-skinned', 'though', 'pass', 'white', 'when', 'Alabama', 'white', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'been', 'living', 'white', 'nurse.Pinky', 'shocked', 'return', 'South', 'suddenly', 'being', 'treated', 'second-class', 'citizen', 'again', 'Further', 'conflict', 'when', 'Granny', 'Pinky', 'tend', 'sick', 'white', 'neighbor', 'Miss', 'Em', 'Ethel', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'giant', 'slave-era', 'colonial', 'mansion', 'Pinky', 'memories', 'Miss', 'Em', 'treating', 'other', 'black', 'children', 'poorly', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Pinky', 'tend', 'racist', 'Miss', 'Em', 'when', 'Granny', 'unlikely', 'bond', 'forms', 'Miss', 'Em', 'Pinky', 'Unfortunately', 'plot', 'awkwardly', 'handled', 'final', 'conflicts', 'are', 'resolved', 'modern', 'audience', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'offer', 'answers', 'regarding', 'racial', 'relations', 'however', 'historical', 'perspective', 'interest', 'acting', 'fairly', 'good', 'behind-the-scenes', 'drama', 'illustrate', 'status', 'blacks', '1949', 'Hollywood', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'who', 'was', 'major', 'star', 'wanted', 'play', 'Pinky', 'producers', 'were', 'not', 'willing', 'incur', 'controversy', 'having', 'love', 'scene', 'black', 'actress', 'white', 'actor', 'Thus', 'white', 'actress', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'received', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'later', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Overall', 'Pinky', 'decent', '1940s', 'drama', 'added', 'interest', 'history', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'being', 'outdated', 'somewhat', 'creaky']",Pinky VHS
