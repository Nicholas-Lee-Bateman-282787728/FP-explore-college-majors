269309,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301801938,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Blue Bird, 1940 filmThe sign bans trespassing in the forest. Can a young girl and boy capture a bird there? They run from a forester. Will they trade the bird for a doll? Myltyl wisely refuses a cake from a stranger. She is angry because she is not rich. [""Be happy with your lot .."" goes the expression.] Her father hears the orders to mobilize the men, Napoleon's army is on the march. Is the war caused by greed? [Yes, and other evils too.] There is a knock on the door in the morning. They are being sent to find ""the Blue Bird of Happiness"". Where do they search? Their dog and cat are personified! [Will any material possession bring happiness or is that a state of mind?] They travel to a cemetery at night. Will thinking of Grandma and Grandpa bring them back? ""The dead are alive as long as you remember them.""They continue their search. Their dog and cat worry about them. Whey they return they talk about the ""Land of Luxury"". ""Its not wise to spend too much time there."" [Still true today?] They meet Mr. & Mrs. Luxury and learn about their lives. Conflict arises over limited resources. Mr. Luxury has a bum leg and is angry. She wants to return home. Her parents aren't poor, they just don't have much money. The cat upsets an urn. The children run away. There are comic scenes. The Fairy returns to greet them. They enter a magical forest when a storm comes up. They flee the fires but their cat is caught. Will it be better in the Land of the Future? There are many children there. One has invented anaesthesia (to eliminate pain). One child worries about the injustice, pain, and greed on earth. Those who protest can be killed. But they have no choice over their birth.Myltyl wonders if there really is a Blue Bird? The Fairy says yes, but its in disguise. They awake at home. Their father won't be taken for war, a truce was signed. [""Peace in our time?""] Myltyl talks about her dream. She finds a blue bird in a cage at home. Her neighbor's daughter is up and walking around. Can they find the Blue Bird again? Yes, they know where to look for it.Many of those Fairy Tales have been banned from the schoolbooks of today. Read the uncensored ""Hansel and Gretel"" for an example. They often have a moral, but their language is often too ""insensitive"" for modern times. The concerns of that era (wealth and poverty, peace and war) are still valid today. The intellectual level of this movie may have led to its failure for the audiences of that time (or even today).",2,A Philosophical Story,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,2486,"['Blue', 'Bird', '1940', 'filmThe', 'sign', 'trespassing', 'forest', 'Can', 'young', 'girl', 'boy', 'capture', 'bird', 'there', 'run', 'forester', 'Will', 'trade', 'bird', 'doll', 'Myltyl', 'wisely', 'cake', 'stranger', 'angry', 'not', 'rich', '[', 'Be', 'happy', 'lot', '..', 'expression', ']', 'father', 'orders', 'mobilize', 'men', 'Napoleon', 'army', 'march', 'war', 'caused', 'greed', '[', 'Yes', 'other', 'evils', 'too', ']', 'knock', 'door', 'morning', 'are', 'being', 'sent', 'find', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'Happiness', 'Where', 'do', 'search', 'dog', 'cat', 'are', 'personified', '[', 'Will', 'material', 'possession', 'bring', 'happiness', 'state', 'mind', 'travel', 'cemetery', 'night', 'Will', 'thinking', 'Grandma', 'Grandpa', 'bring', 'back', 'dead', 'are', 'alive', 'as', 'long', 'remember', 'continue', 'search', 'dog', 'cat', 'worry', 'return', 'talk', 'Land', 'Luxury', 'not', 'wise', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'there', '[', 'Still', 'true', 'today', 'meet', 'Mr.', 'Mrs', 'Luxury', 'learn', 'lives', 'Conflict', 'over', 'limited', 'resources', 'Mr', 'Luxury', 'bum', 'leg', 'angry', 'return', 'home', 'parents', 'are', ""n't"", 'poor', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'money', 'cat', 'urn', 'children', 'run', 'away', 'are', 'comic', 'scenes', 'Fairy', 'returns', 'greet', 'enter', 'magical', 'forest', 'when', 'storm', 'up', 'flee', 'fires', 'cat', 'caught', 'Will', 'be', 'better', 'Land', 'Future', 'are', 'many', 'children', 'there', 'One', 'invented', 'anaesthesia', 'eliminate', 'pain', 'One', 'child', 'worries', 'injustice', 'pain', 'greed', 'earth', 'who', 'protest', 'can', 'be', 'killed', 'have', 'choice', 'birth.Myltyl', 'wonders', 'really', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'Fairy', 'yes', 'disguise', 'awake', 'home', 'father', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'war', 'truce', 'was', 'signed', '[', 'Peace', 'time', 'Myltyl', 'talks', 'dream', 'blue', 'bird', 'cage', 'home', 'neighbor', 'daughter', 'up', 'walking', 'around', 'Can', 'find', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'again', 'Yes', 'know', 'where', 'look', 'it.Many', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'have', 'been', 'banned', 'schoolbooks', 'today', 'Read', 'uncensored', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'example', 'often', 'have', 'moral', 'language', 'often', 'too', 'insensitive', 'modern', 'times', 'concerns', 'era', 'wealth', 'poverty', 'peace', 'war', 'are', 'still', 'valid', 'today', 'intellectual', 'level', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'failure', 'audiences', 'time', 'even', 'today']",N/A
269310,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6301801938,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 1]","You may not have heard of ""The Blue Bird"". It's not your typical Shirley Temple movie by any means. In fact, it was specifically made in reaction to Judy Garland's ""Wizard of Oz."" It's more allegorical and, frankly, more magical than the Wiz. In some ways, I like it better. The Wiz is way more familiar, and as a movie, I suppose it is better. But as a STORY, The Blue Bird is superior in several ways.Shirley plays Mytyl, a little German girl who is a bit of a brat. She's selfish and whiney and not at all like Shirley Temple. As she and her little brother Tyltyl go to sleep, they are aware that their father (a woodcutter) is expected to go off to war tomorrow. Napoleon is at the border. (History buffs tell me what year this is.) As with the Wiz, the beginning is in black and white, and then as they children go to the dream world it is in color.The children a awakened by a witch at the door, although they say fairy. She tells them they must go look for the bluebird of happiness, and transforms their dog and their cat into humans to go with them. The dog becomes a comical little fat man who does an excellent job of being a loyal dog, complete with instincts for protecting the children. The cat becomes a very tall, slim and slinky woman who is convincingly cat-like. She is also rather wicked.One more ""person"" comes to their aid: a beautiful young woman dressed all in filmy white, with gold trim and long blond hair. Her name is Light. She explains they must look everywhere for the bluebird, including the past. She stays outside while they go through the graveyard to the past, where they find their grandparents. It seems the grandparents wake up whenever someone thinks about them. The children are delighted to see their grandparents again, and the grandparents want them to stay, but there's no bluebird. And Light told them they must not spend more than an hour in the past, or they will have to stay there.Next they go to the Land of Luxury, a huge ornate palace with Mr. and Mrs. Luxury, who give them everything they want. But their dog/man has to go to the kennels, where even the other dogs won't play with him because he has no pedigree. After Myltyl and Tyltyl get to fighting over their pony, they end up crying and unable to sleep in their luxurious bedrooms. Myltyl goes wandering around in her satin dressing gown, and encounters Mr. Luxury having a drink and trying to read while his gouty foot is propped up on a cushion. He's crabby and Myltyl can't really talk to him. She wants to give him a kiss goodnight, and ends up hurting his leg. So she wanders out to the kennels, and she and the dog/man decide to go get Tyltyl and leave the Luxuries.Next they go through the forest, where the cat/woman rouses the tree spirits to stop the children. After she goes back to the children, the trees agree that the children must die. (Remember, they are the children of a woodcutter.) The trees call on wind and lightening to help them, and the entire forest is set on fire. The children and the dog/man escape, but the cat/woman is burned up.Finally, they go to the Land of the Future, up a stone stairway into the clouds. There they find all the boys and girls (boys wear blue togas; girls wear pink ones) who are waiting to be born. They learn that it's not always a good thing: one boy knows he's going to be martyred, and a couple who are in love find that the boy is due to be born, but the girl won't be born until after he's gone. They will never see each other on earth. A swan ship with silver sails takes the children who are to be born into the sunrise, singing.Light comes and brings Myltyl and Tyltyl away, back to their home. They wake up when their mother (Spring Byington) comes in to wake them, but they know it ""really"" happened because they both had the same dream. A neighbor comes and tells their father that a peace treaty has been signed, and he does not have to go to war after all. And the brown bird they had captured in the woods yesterday has turned bright blue.It's a charming story, and the scene in the Land of the Future is especially thought-provoking.",4,Shirley Temple's Forgotten Fantasy,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,4115,"['may', 'not', 'have', 'heard', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'not', 'typical', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'movie', 'means', 'fact', 'was', 'specifically', 'made', 'reaction', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'more', 'allegorical', 'frankly', 'more', 'magical', 'Wiz', 'ways', 'like', 'better', 'Wiz', 'way', 'more', 'familiar', 'movie', 'suppose', 'better', 'STORY', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'superior', 'several', 'ways.Shirley', 'plays', 'Mytyl', 'little', 'German', 'girl', 'who', 'bit', 'brat', 'selfish', 'whiney', 'not', 'like', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'little', 'brother', 'Tyltyl', 'go', 'sleep', 'are', 'aware', 'father', 'woodcutter', 'expected', 'go', 'off', 'war', 'tomorrow', 'Napoleon', 'border', 'History', 'buffs', 'tell', 'what', 'year', 'Wiz', 'beginning', 'black', 'white', 'then', 'children', 'go', 'dream', 'world', 'color.The', 'children', 'awakened', 'witch', 'door', 'say', 'fairy', 'must', 'go', 'look', 'bluebird', 'happiness', 'transforms', 'dog', 'cat', 'humans', 'go', 'dog', 'comical', 'little', 'fat', 'man', 'who', 'excellent', 'job', 'being', 'loyal', 'dog', 'complete', 'instincts', 'protecting', 'children', 'cat', 'very', 'tall', 'slim', 'slinky', 'woman', 'who', 'convincingly', 'cat-like', 'also', 'rather', 'more', 'person', 'aid', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'dressed', 'filmy', 'white', 'gold', 'trim', 'long', 'blond', 'hair', 'name', 'Light', 'must', 'look', 'everywhere', 'bluebird', 'including', 'past', 'stays', 'outside', 'go', 'graveyard', 'past', 'where', 'find', 'grandparents', 'grandparents', 'wake', 'up', 'whenever', 'someone', 'children', 'are', 'delighted', 'see', 'grandparents', 'again', 'grandparents', 'want', 'stay', 'bluebird', 'Light', 'told', 'must', 'not', 'spend', 'more', 'hour', 'past', 'will', 'have', 'stay', 'go', 'Land', 'Luxury', 'huge', 'ornate', 'palace', 'Mr.', 'Mrs', 'Luxury', 'who', 'give', 'everything', 'want', 'dog/man', 'go', 'kennels', 'where', 'even', 'other', 'dogs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'pedigree', 'Myltyl', 'Tyltyl', 'get', 'fighting', 'over', 'pony', 'end', 'up', 'crying', 'unable', 'sleep', 'luxurious', 'bedrooms', 'Myltyl', 'wandering', 'around', 'satin', 'dressing', 'gown', 'encounters', 'Mr', 'Luxury', 'having', 'drink', 'trying', 'read', 'gouty', 'foot', 'propped', 'up', 'cushion', 'crabby', 'Myltyl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'talk', 'give', 'kiss', 'goodnight', 'up', 'hurting', 'leg', 'kennels', 'dog/man', 'decide', 'go', 'get', 'Tyltyl', 'leave', 'Luxuries.Next', 'go', 'forest', 'where', 'cat/woman', 'tree', 'spirits', 'stop', 'children', 'back', 'children', 'trees', 'agree', 'children', 'must', 'die', 'Remember', 'are', 'children', 'woodcutter', 'trees', 'call', 'wind', 'lightening', 'help', 'entire', 'forest', 'set', 'fire', 'children', 'dog/man', 'escape', 'cat/woman', 'burned', 'up.Finally', 'go', 'Land', 'Future', 'up', 'stone', 'stairway', 'clouds', 'find', 'boys', 'girls', 'boys', 'wear', 'blue', 'togas', 'girls', 'wear', 'pink', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'waiting', 'be', 'born', 'learn', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'one', 'boy', 'going', 'be', 'martyred', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'love', 'find', 'boy', 'due', 'be', 'born', 'girl', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'born', 'gone', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'other', 'earth', 'swan', 'ship', 'silver', 'sails', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'be', 'born', 'sunrise', 'singing.Light', 'Myltyl', 'Tyltyl', 'away', 'back', 'home', 'wake', 'up', 'when', 'mother', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'wake', 'know', 'really', 'happened', 'had', 'same', 'dream', 'neighbor', 'father', 'peace', 'treaty', 'been', 'signed', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'war', 'brown', 'bird', 'had', 'captured', 'woods', 'yesterday', 'turned', 'bright', 'blue.It', 'charming', 'story', 'scene', 'Land', 'Future', 'especially', 'thought-provoking']",N/A

Shirley Temple was originally mentioned for the role of Dorothy in OZ, though Fox was leary about releasing her from her contract.Based on the play by Maurice Maeterlinck, the story recounts one sad and angry little girl, Mytyl (Shirley Temple) who journeys with her brother Tyltyl (Johnny Russell) to find the 'bluebird of happiness'.  Joining the children on the quest are the children's pets - cat Tylette (Gale Sondergaard) and dog Tylo (Eddie Collins) who have been magically changed to human-form.Just like in OZ, the film changes from drab black-and-white to glowing and rich Technicolor, though OZ is of course the superior of the two.  Shirley Temple is given more of a dramatic range to work with here, playing a little girl with rougher edges and thus more 'real' than her previous film roles.Gale Sondergaard is deliciously-devious as the children's cat, and Spring Byington is perfect as Mummy Tyl.

269312,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,6301801938,Chip Kaufmann,"[1, 1]","THE BLUE BIRD is based on an allegorical fantasy by the Belgian poet & playwright Maurice Maeterlinck (PELLEAS & MELISANDE), a leading member of the Symbolist movement. This story of two children searching for the Blue Bird of Happiness made its debut on stage in 1908 to great success. It was a made into a famous silent film by Maurice Tourneur in 1918 before this 1940 version. It was disastrously remade as a Russian-American co-production in 1976 despite having Jane Fonda, Elizabeth Taylor & Cicely Tyson in the cast and being directed by George Cukor.It's generally well known that Shirley Temple was originally supposed to be Dorothy in THE WIZARD OF OZ. Despite the fact that OZ was not a success at the box office (its iconic status would come later on TV), Fox decided to pull out all the stops on this fantasy. What they didn't do was make a typical Shirley Temple vehicle. There are no big musical numbers, she plays a selfish, unhappy little girl (much to her delight), and true to Maeterlinck, the story is deliberately abstract. What WAS changed is that in the original the roles are reversed. The brother is the leader, not the sister.The principal roles are well cast with Gale Sondergaard an elegantly malevolent cat, Eddie Collins a remarkably faithful dog, and Nigel Bruce doing a variation on Dr Watson as Mr. Luxury. It was also nice to see Al Shean (of GALLAGHER & SHEAN fame and the Marx Brothers' uncle) as the Grandfather. However, the film is not devoid of shortcomings. Cuts made after the original release have made some scenes uneven, the dialogue is sometimes trite & saccharine, and the sequence in the Kingdom of the Future (where all the children are white) reflect the Hollywood of 1940.This new DVD version is certainly a nice improvement over the old VHS version. The color sequences are lovingly restored with an especially intense forest fire and a wonderful midnight sequence in the graveyard. Unfortunately it doesn't restore footage that was cut after the initial release. English subtitles are always welcome but more special features would have been nice. While Shirley is fine, she's not the reason I like THE BLUE BIRD. I like it for its atmospheric lighting, the messages it conveys, Alfred Newman's music score and the way it captures a child's sense of wonder.",4,Fond Memories Despite Its Shortcomings.,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,2310,"['BLUE', 'BIRD', 'based', 'allegorical', 'fantasy', 'Belgian', 'poet', 'playwright', 'Maurice', 'Maeterlinck', 'PELLEAS', 'MELISANDE', 'leading', 'member', 'Symbolist', 'movement', 'story', 'two', 'children', 'searching', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'Happiness', 'made', 'debut', 'stage', '1908', 'great', 'success', 'was', 'made', 'famous', 'silent', 'film', 'Maurice', 'Tourneur', '1918', '1940', 'version', 'was', 'disastrously', 'remade', 'Russian-American', 'co-production', '1976', 'having', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'cast', 'being', 'directed', 'George', 'Cukor.It', 'generally', 'well', 'known', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'Dorothy', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'fact', 'OZ', 'was', 'not', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'iconic', 'status', 'would', 'come', 'later', 'TV', 'Fox', 'decided', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'fantasy', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'was', 'make', 'typical', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'vehicle', 'are', 'big', 'musical', 'numbers', 'selfish', 'unhappy', 'little', 'girl', 'much', 'delight', 'true', 'Maeterlinck', 'story', 'deliberately', 'abstract', 'What', 'WAS', 'changed', 'original', 'roles', 'are', 'reversed', 'brother', 'leader', 'not', 'sister.The', 'principal', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'elegantly', 'malevolent', 'cat', 'Eddie', 'Collins', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'dog', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'doing', 'variation', 'Dr', 'Watson', 'Mr', 'Luxury', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Al', 'Shean', 'GALLAGHER', 'SHEAN', 'fame', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'uncle', 'Grandfather', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'devoid', 'shortcomings', 'Cuts', 'made', 'original', 'release', 'have', 'made', 'scenes', 'uneven', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'trite', 'saccharine', 'sequence', 'Kingdom', 'Future', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'white', 'reflect', 'Hollywood', '1940.This', 'new', 'DVD', 'version', 'certainly', 'nice', 'improvement', 'old', 'VHS', 'version', 'color', 'sequences', 'are', 'lovingly', 'restored', 'especially', 'intense', 'forest', 'fire', 'wonderful', 'midnight', 'sequence', 'graveyard', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'restore', 'footage', 'was', 'cut', 'initial', 'release', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'always', 'welcome', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Shirley', 'fine', 'not', 'reason', 'THE', 'BLUE', 'BIRD', 'like', 'atmospheric', 'lighting', 'messages', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'music', 'score', 'way', 'child', 'sense', 'wonder']",N/A

This one has so much more depth and reality - it's not just some light repetitive annoying vehicle for Technicolour. Here I feel the colour is very wisely used - there are no garish slippers or yellow brick roads, just a lot of understated hues and excellent lighting.The cast is superb though. The people who play Tylo and Tylette (the dog and cat, respectively, in human form) are perfect. I couldn't get over how very catty Gale Sondergaard was. The way she walked, talked, glanced about, touched her hair, lounged around... She had some pretty incredible talent. I did feel some sympathy for her (or was it myself?) when she got trapped in the forest... because she was so much fun to watch! I don't like dogs, so Tylo didn't make such an impression on me, but he did do a very good job.Shirley as Mytil and the little boy as Tyltyl were also well done and I thought their acting was very good, personally. The Luxuries were very strange.And I can't help but put in a word for the Light-Lady, who was very gentle and beautiful and had a lovely voice to guide the children with, as well as her luminous gown.The costumes were astounding, the sets very elaborate and well-done. I guess I can't say enough good things about this movie. I just really liked it.Oh, I should say though that the forest fire sequence is pretty frightening and that it might be a good idea to watch this before letting children see it... feel it out for yourself, of course, but I just thought that it was pretty intense and a bit much for young children.Well, I think that is all I should say.

I am also surprised that they didn't even bother to tint it to its original sepia color.

It would open them up to a much wider market and boost sales. This series is a vast improvement over the first DVD releases Fox did a few years back, but there is still ample room for improvement for the girl who saved the studio 70 years ago.

She apologizes to her mother at bedtime, but her mother finds little contentment in Mytyl's empty apology. After she falls asleep, Mytyl and her brother, Tyltyl, are summoned by the Fairy Berylune to find the Blue Bird of Happiness (this is where the film changes from black & white to glorious technicolor). Mytyl & Tyltyl visit the land of the dead, the land of luxury, and the land of the future, in addition to encountering a scary forest fire.The film was Shirley's first big flop (her previous film, ""Susannah of the Mounties"" already showed a slip in attendance), which was made worse by the fact that ""The Blue Bird"" had a larger than normal budget for a Temple film. It failed for many reasons; Shirley's faithful audience did not want to see her as a brat, and this film was unfairly compared to ""The Wizard of Oz."" ""The Blue Bird"" was much heavier in tone and even a little creepy at times--especially the visit to the land of the dead/past. However, when watched today, it can be appreciated on its own. It does seem a little sluggish at times, which can be blamed on the director, Walter Lang, who should have used a tighter pacing. Often it seems like a filmed stage play, rather than a motion picture. The special effects are fantastic, Shirley's performance is wonderful, and the sets are nothing less than lavish and arty--a true feast for the eyes. It is a little too mature for children, and a little too simple for adults; it falls somewhere in between. Ironically, Gale Sondergaard, who plays the evil villainess of the piece, was offered the role of the Wicked Witch in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but turned it down when she discovered that she would have to play it as an ugly hag, and not a glamorous witch (like the Queen from ""Snow White"").",3,Still Looking For Extras,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,2640,"['have', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Technicolor', 'portions', 'transfer', 'look', 'great', 'BW', 'opening', 'fairly', 'poor', 'am', 'also', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'tint', 'original', 'sepia', 'color', 'lastly', 'am', 'glad', 'Fox', 'releasing', 'movies', 'DVD', 'would', 'really', 'cost', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'put', 'REAL', 'extras', 'would', 'open', 'up', 'much', 'wider', 'market', 'boost', 'sales', 'series', 'vast', 'improvement', 'first', 'DVD', 'Fox', 'did', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'still', 'ample', 'room', 'improvement', 'girl', 'who', 'saved', 'studio', '70', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'familiar', 'story', 'Shirley', 'type', 'bratty', 'Mytyl', 'daughter', 'poor', 'hardworking', 'woodcutter', 'one', 'outbursts', 'not', 'having', 'enough', 'luxuries', 'father', 'unexpectedly', 'called', 'war', 'must', 'leave', 'morning', 'mother', 'bedtime', 'mother', 'little', 'contentment', 'Mytyl', 'empty', 'apology', 'asleep', 'Mytyl', 'brother', 'Tyltyl', 'are', 'summoned', 'Fairy', 'Berylune', 'find', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'Happiness', 'where', 'film', 'changes', 'black', 'white', 'glorious', 'technicolor', 'Mytyl', 'Tyltyl', 'visit', 'land', 'dead', 'land', 'luxury', 'land', 'future', 'addition', 'encountering', 'scary', 'forest', 'fire.The', 'film', 'was', 'Shirley', 'first', 'big', 'flop', 'previous', 'film', 'Susannah', 'Mounties', 'already', 'showed', 'slip', 'attendance', 'was', 'made', 'worse', 'fact', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'had', 'larger', 'normal', 'budget', 'Temple', 'film', 'failed', 'many', 'reasons', 'Shirley', 'faithful', 'audience', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'brat', 'film', 'was', 'unfairly', 'compared', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'was', 'much', 'heavier', 'tone', 'even', 'little', 'creepy', 'times', 'especially', 'visit', 'land', 'dead/past', 'However', 'when', 'watched', 'today', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'own', 'seem', 'little', 'sluggish', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'director', 'Walter', 'Lang', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'tighter', 'pacing', 'Often', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'rather', 'motion', 'picture', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Shirley', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'sets', 'are', 'nothing', 'less', 'lavish', 'arty', 'true', 'feast', 'eyes', 'little', 'too', 'mature', 'children', 'little', 'too', 'simple', 'adults', 'somewhere', 'Ironically', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'who', 'evil', 'villainess', 'piece', 'was', 'offered', 'role', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'turned', 'down', 'when', 'discovered', 'would', 'have', 'play', 'ugly', 'hag', 'not', 'glamorous', 'witch', 'Queen', 'Snow', 'White']",N/A
269316,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6301801938,Deborah Earle,"[10, 11]","Curly Shirley Temple lends her dimpled, pouty-mouthed winsomeness to the tale of a young girl and her brother(Johnny Russell)who live in Austria/Bavaria during the Napoleanic Wars.It is Christmastime of 1808, and young Mytyl is a selfish and unhappy woodsman's daughter whom we first encounter illegally trapping a bird in the King's forest. An opportunity to show kindness to an ailing neighbor (Sybil Jason), is discarded, as is an opportunity to accept kindness from a doorman outside the home of a wealthy family who offers cookies to the youngsters.The family's problems stem largely from Mytyl's ingratitude for what she has. Her mother(Spring Byington) expresses her frustration with Mytyl's attitude. But family problems reach a critical point when the children's father(Russell Hicks) is called to arms to help hold Napolean's forces at bay.At this low but critical ebb, the children are awakened in the middle of the night by a knock on their front door; it is the Fairy, Berylune (Jessie Ralph) who tells them that they must find the Blue Bird, the symbol of true happiness. She zaps them into their clothes, and then changes their faithful dog, Tylo (Eddie Collins, who lived just long enough to see the film's release) and conniving cat Tylette (Gale Sondergaard) into humans to provide them with escorts for their journey, and then presents them with light (Helen Ericson, who is as bright as she is benevolent).The intial part of their journey is to the Past, represented in the form of a graveyard, where soon enough, their deceased paternal grandparents(Celia Loftus, and Al Shean) are revived,  and the children recall joyous times at their home with a little song and dance along the way.After their brief visit back in time, they rest by the roadside, and the cunning Tylette suggests the children search for the Blue Bird in the land of Luxury-a visit she will enjoy more than they will. They are greeted by the fashionable Mr. and Mrs. Luxury (Nigel Bruce and Laura Hope Crews) who comically slide down the balcony to greet them. There, they get a valuable lesson in what the lives of the rich children towards whom Mytyl had earlier expressed envy are really like. Materialism, class- consciousness, and the emotionally distant relationship with their elders make them yearn for the warmth and comfort provided by their parents. Despite Tylette's efforts to sabotage them, they escape. Mr. Luxury is sympathetic to their need to do so.As Tylo and the children rest, Tylette goes to the woods to summon the trees of the forest to settle scores with their father, the woodcutter, who has chopped down so many of them, by summoning the natural disasters of the woods to destroy the children. I found the most memorable part of that episode to be the tragi-comic performance of Alice Armand's Weeping Willow. The costumes of the actors representing the various types of trees were brilliantly created.After Tylette is justly condemned by her own treachery, Tylo and the children escape disaster and travel safely to shore, where Light guides them to the Kingdom of the Future. History students will recognize this as a foray into February of 1809, where among others, they meet the unborn Queen Victoria and  soon-to-be-born Abraham Lincoln,whose onscreen time is accompanied by noble-sounding chords featured at other such moments of stateliness or anticipation of greatness in other movies produced by Fox. A bouncy, sweet little Ann E. Todd informs the brother and sister of a future joy for their family, and a future sorrow... Her greeting of her future siblings is expressed in a slow, sweet waltz that is both happy and wistful-sounding. Mytyl and Tyltyl witness impish little ones trying to be born before their time as well as the impending tragedy of soulmates who will not find each other during their time on Earth.Soon, the children are home again, ready to make this Christmas Day, a happier one, to right a few wrongs of the previous day, and to be blessed with some important good news of their own.At the end of this tale-which is every bit as lovely as its MGM counterpart, ""The Wizard of Oz"" , but which in some ways has more depth--we find Mytyl content to make the most of her circumstances, and through her new attiude towards life, to be more of a blessing to others rather than a burden.",5,Lovely Adaptation of Maeterlinck's Classic Play,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,4330,"['Curly', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'dimpled',

From a child's viewpoint, everything looked magical. I especially loved the fairy, Light, and the Land of the Unborn Children. As a grownup, I can appreciate the slightly tacky, not to mention low-budget, nature of the costumes and settings, but I don't care. I still love it!!!For one thing, the color has been restored beautifully; for another, Shirley Temple's terminal cuteness was finally curbed by a competent director, Walter Lang. Every curl still remains in place, but she puts in a more than creditable performance as the spoiled brat, Mytyl. The little boy playing her brother Tyltyl is also engaging, as are Sibyl Jason, and Juanita Quigley as children in supporting roles. And Gale Sondergaard is brilliant as Tylette the sneaky cat. Her exchanges with the growling dog Tylo are highly amusing.If children have not become too jaded by their exposure to computers, and can still believe in magic and fairies, they will love this allegorical fable based upon the novel by Maurice Maeterlinck.",5,A Child's Bluebird of Happiness,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,1100,"[""'m"", 'prejudiced', 'film', 'saw', 'small', 'child', 'was', 'absolutely', 'enchanted', 'child', 'viewpoint', 'everything', 'looked', 'magical', 'especially', 'loved', 'fairy', 'Light', 'Land', 'Unborn', 'Children', 'grownup', 'can', 'appreciate', 'slightly', 'tacky', 'not', 'mention', 'low-budget', 'nature', 'costumes', 'settings', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'still', 'love', 'one', 'thing', 'color', 'been', 'restored', 'beautifully', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'terminal', 'cuteness', 'was', 'finally', 'curbed', 'competent', 'director', 'Walter', 'Lang', 'Every', 'curl', 'still', 'place', 'more', 'creditable', 'performance', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'Mytyl', 'little', 'boy', 'playing', 'brother', 'Tyltyl', 'also', 'engaging', 'are', 'Sibyl', 'Jason', 'Juanita', 'Quigley', 'children', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'brilliant', 'Tylette', 'sneaky', 'cat', 'exchanges', 'growling', 'dog', 'Tylo', 'are', 'highly', 'amusing.If', 'children', 'have', 'not', 'become', 'too', 'jaded', 'exposure', 'computers', 'can', 'still', 'believe', 'magic', 'fairies', 'will', 'love', 'allegorical', 'fable', 'based', 'novel', 'Maurice', 'Maeterlinck']",N/A
269318,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301801938,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[7, 11]","It is not surprising that MGM briefly considered borrowing Shirley Temple (b. 1928) from 20th Century Fox for the role of Dorothy Gale in THE WIZARD OF OZ: she was easily the single greatest child star to emerge from Golden Age Hollywood.  After consideration, MGM decided against serious negotiation.  Whatever her gifts, Temple was not a notable singer, and 20th Century Fox would charge a truly staggering sum for her services.  On such points are careers made and broken: OZ is a legendary film and it vaulted Judy Garland to a legendary career.  It also gave 20th Century Fox the notion to star Temple in its own Technicolor fantasy, and with disastrous consequences.As originally created for the stage in 1909 by playwright Maurice Maeterlinck, THE BLUE BIRD was a poetic allegory concerning a child's search for happiness.  As created on the 20th Century Fox soundstage, it was very much a Shirley Temple vehicle and very similar to MGM's OZ, beginning in black and white, shifting suddenly into Technicolor, and sending its heroine off on a dreamed journey to teach her that happiness had been within her grasp at home all the while.  The cast was memorable: Temple, of course, was a great star, and she was supported by a host of noted character actors, including Spring Byington, Nigel Bruce, Gale Sondergaard, Jessie Ralph, and Laura Hope Crews.  The director was Walter Lang, who already had a solid career behind him and who would eventually receive a nomination as Best Director for THE KING AND I, and the designs, decorations, and costumes created for the film were very ""high art"" in concept.  And it was probably the worst flop of 1940.Audiences of the day were used to seeing Shirley Temple play the role of a happy, brave little girl who faced adversity with a smile.  The role of Mytyl, however, was bratty.  Seen today, the brattiness is quite mild, but audiences didn't like and didn't believe Temple in the role.  But the film has much deeper problems than this: it is choppy, lifeless, unattractive, hokey, poorly designed and scripted and directed and performed, and repulsively, repulsively saccharine.  In spite of the effort and expense and money poured into it, the film looks cheap, the special effects aren't, the musical number is vile--and it ends very abruptly with Temple doing her best to carry off a straight-to-the-camera line that seems to sum up everything that is wrong with the project.Although Temple gives it her usual one hundred percent, the rest of the cast seems acutely aware that they are trapped in a cinematic disaster; some play it throw-away, some play it with a wink and a nod, but the result is the same.  And although it has a short running time of eighty-eight minutes, the film seems slow.  When set alongside OZ, THE BLUE BIRD doesn't seem so much seriously lacking as it seems flatly inept, the sort of thing Ed Wood would have done had he been a director at 20th Century Fox in 1940.  The thing is a flat out embarassment--and such a big one that it effectively ended Shirley Temple's status as the studio's most bankable star.  The studio would try to revive her career, but to no avail.  Temple gradually moved into supporting roles, many of which would bring her great acclaim, but her glory days were done, and many feel THE BLUE BIRD was responsible.The DVD offers nothing in the way of bonuses, but the print and sound of the film are quite good.  Even so, the film itself isn't worth the money required to purchase or rent it, and it certainly isn't worth the eighty-eight minutes required to watch it.  Even hardcore Temple fans should give this one a miss.

269325,AWPODHOB4GFWL,6301801938,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[0, 0]","MGM originally wanted Shirley Temple to play Dorothy in the classic, ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), but Twentieth Century Fox wouldn't let her out of her contract (rumor was also that Ms. Temple could not sing like Judy Garland). Instead, in a blatant copycat fashion, Ms. Temple's studio released ""The Bluebird"" (1940); her own version of ""The Wizard of Oz"". In this version, however, Shirley Temple plays Mytyl, a bratty, selfish German girl who is the blackest contradiction of a `good little girl'. To compliment the story, Mytyl has a younger brother named Tyltyl, adding an unnecessary 'Hansel and Gretel' touch.With their father about to go to war on Christmas, the family becomes despondent. Mytyl reluctantly goes to bed only to wake up in a world of color (sorry, no tornadoes here). A magical fairy with a technicolor drape tells Mytyl and Tyltyl that they must seek out the `bluebird of happiness'. An amazing `Glenda, Good Witch' look-alike named ""Light"" (I'm not kidding) guides them on their journey. Their now humanized faithful dog and sneaky cat accompany the silly trio.The group visits scary graveyards and the `past' to see the ever-so-grateful dead grandparents, which starts the whole ""It's a Wonderful Life"" clich&eacute;. After appreciating how much they miss their overwhelmingly saccharin dead grandparents, the young children experience Mr. and Mrs. Luxury, only to discover that these pompous fat oafs don't represent happiness after all. In a trek through a forest (another `Wizard of Oz' parallel) trees talk and conspire against humans who only want to cut and destroy them. The children find themselves witness to a lightning storm that forces them on a run through a gigantic forest with lightning scorched burning trees falling all around them. This particluar scene is quite a visual achievement considering the period in history. Escaping by boat over a pond, they find themselves in the world of the future, where they find young toddlers and other children waiting to be born in a cloud filled world of bliss. It is there that they meet the future scientists, teachers and lovers of the world. It's an unearthly world of souls as anxious to be born as orphans wanting to be adopted. There is one nice touch of despondent young soul mates that know they will never be together again as they are destined to be born at different generations.""Light"" tells them she must go and they will find the bluebird of happiness on their own. Suddenly, waking up in their beds again, Mytyl and Tyltyl greet their mother with uncharacteristic gratitude and find that their father won't be going to war after all. The following is the actual dialogue at the end of this film.Mummy Tyl: Your daddy got up at daybreak and made a cage for yourbird. Do you like it?Mytyl: Oh, Tyltyl, look! My bird, look whats happened to it! Itsblue! Its the blue bird!Daddy Tyl: The blue bird?Mytyl turns and looks DIRECTLY into the camera and says to the audience: ""We looked everywhere for it, and all the time it was right here!""Right here in your own backyard? Now where was Auntie Em???The film is very pretty to look at, but the characters are one-dimensional and the scenes seem to be written overnight, clumped together in a linear manner to justify Shirley Temple and the special effects. There is one song and dance number that is completely out of place. It's shamelessly stunning to see the similarities between ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Bluebird"". There's no wonder this film flopped despite the Oscar nominated special effects. It almost, almost makes you wish that the ferocious forest fire had engulfed and destroyed Mytyl, Tyltyl and the entire film.",4,Classic Story!,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,3669,"['MGM', 'originally', 'wanted', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'play', 'Dorothy', 'classic', 'Wizard', 'Oz', '1939', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'contract', 'rumor', 'was', 'also', 'Ms.', 'Temple', 'could', 'not', 'sing', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Instead', 'blatant', 'copycat', 'fashion', 'Ms.', 'Temple', 'studio', 'released', 'Bluebird', '1940', 'own', 'version', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'version', 'however', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Mytyl', 'bratty', 'selfish', 'German', 'girl', 'who', 'blackest', 'contradiction', 'good', 'little', 'girl', 'compliment', 'story', 'Mytyl', 'younger', 'brother', 'named', 'Tyltyl', 'adding', 'unnecessary', ""'Hansel"", 'Gretel', 'touch.With', 'father', 'go', 'war', 'Christmas', 'family', 'despondent', 'Mytyl', 'reluctantly', 'bed', 'only', 'wake', 'up', 'world', 'color', 'sorry', 'tornadoes', 'here', 'magical', 'fairy', 'technicolor', 'drape', 'Mytyl', 'Tyltyl', 'must', 'seek', 'out', 'bluebird', 'happiness', 'amazing', 'Glenda', 'Good', 'Witch', 'look-alike', 'named', 'Light', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'journey', 'now', 'humanized', 'faithful', 'dog', 'sneaky', 'cat', 'silly', 'trio.The', 'group', 'scary', 'graveyards', 'past', 'see', 'ever-so-grateful', 'dead', 'grandparents', 'whole', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'clich', 'eacute', 'appreciating', 'how', 'much', 'miss', 'overwhelmingly', 'saccharin', 'dead', 'grandparents', 'young', 'children', 'Mr.', 'Mrs', 'Luxury', 'only', 'discover', 'pompous', 'fat', 'oafs', 'do', ""n't"", 'represent', 'happiness', 'trek', 'forest', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'parallel', 'talk', 'conspire', 'humans', 'who', 'only', 'want', 'cut', 'destroy', 'children', 'find', 'witness', 'lightning', 'storm', 'run', 'gigantic', 'forest', 'lightning', 'scorched', 'burning', 'trees', 'falling', 'particluar', 'scene', 'quite', 'visual', 'achievement', 'considering', 'period', 'history', 'Escaping', 'boat', 'pond', 'find', 'world', 'future', 'where', 'find', 'young', 'toddlers', 'other', 'children', 'waiting', 'be', 'born', 'cloud', 'filled', 'world', 'bliss', 'there', 'meet', 'future', 'scientists', 'teachers', 'lovers', 'world', 'unearthly', 'world', 'souls', 'anxious', 'be', 'born', 'orphans', 'wanting', 'be', 'adopted', 'one', 'nice', 'touch', 'despondent', 'young', 'soul', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'together', 'again', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'born', 'different', 'generations', 'Light', 'must', 'go', 'will', 'find', 'bluebird', 'happiness', 'own', 'Suddenly', 'waking', 'up', 'beds', 'again', 'Mytyl', 'Tyltyl', 'greet', 'mother', 'uncharacteristic', 'gratitude', 'find', 'father', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'going', 'war', 'following', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'end', 'film.Mummy', 'Tyl', 'daddy', 'got', 'up', 'daybreak', 'made', 'cage', 'yourbird', 'Do', 'Mytyl', 'Oh', 'Tyltyl', 'look', 'My', 'bird', 'look', 'whats', 'happened', 'Itsblue', 'blue', 'bird', 'Daddy', 'Tyl', 'blue', 'bird', 'Mytyl', 'DIRECTLY', 'camera', 'audience', 'looked', 'everywhere', 'time', 'was', 'right', 'here', 'Right', 'here', 'own', 'backyard', 'Now', 'where', 'was', 'Auntie', 'Em', 'film', 'very', 'pretty', 'look', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'written', 'overnight', 'clumped', 'together', 'linear', 'manner', 'justify', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'song', 'dance', 'number', 'completely', 'place', 'shamelessly', 'stunning', 'see', 'similarities', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Bluebird', 'wonder', 'film', 'flopped', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'special', 'effects', 'almost', 'almost', 'wish', 'ferocious', 'forest', 'fire', 'had', 'engulfed', 'destroyed', 'Mytyl', 'Tyltyl', 'entire', 'film']",N/A

269331,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301801938,Simon Davis,"[57, 59]","Attacked by critics and a failure at the Box Office at the time of it's release in 1940 ""The Blue Bird"" has with time been redeemed and is now quite rightly viewed as a classic film of it's time containing one of Shirley Temple's most interesting performances. The public and critical indifference to the film at the time of its release had alot to do with the fact that Hollywood's formerly adorable moppet and sweetheart of the depression years was now playing a selfish young girl who is only reformed near the conclusion of the story and also because film's less upbeat story suffered when inevitably compared with ""The Wizard of Oz"" released just the year before. I truly love this film with its strong message of appreciating what we actually have in our lives as opposed to always thinking other things are better. Shirley Temple I believe, has never been better than in this slightly older more serious role made just as she was unfortunately slipping from being Hollywood's number one attraction at the Box Office. This film's failure, combined with Shirley's declining popularity finally broke the long string of successes Twentieth Century Fox had enjoyed through the 1930's with Shirley Temple films and after one more unsuccesful release with ""Young People"", also in 1940 the reign of Shirley Temple as the Box Office Queen of Hollywood was definately over forever.Certainly the ""The Blue Bird"" lacks the great songs and show bizzy appeal ...but its theme is a much more serious one with indeed many morbid qualities to it. I believe the two should be viewed as totally separate. ...The whole production is a ravishing feast for the eyes. The sumptous sets, gorgeous color and the costumnes make this film a sight for the eyes. Never has there been a more lavish Shirley Temple film. The graveyard scenes are very eerie and very well done and when Temple along with her younger brother played by child actor Johnny Russell visit the land of luxury the sets are unbelievably beautiful . Nigel Bruce and Laure Hope Crews lend their considerable talents to the scenes in the land of luzury and Gale Sondergaard makes a deliciously wicked Cat.The film , despite the two young children starting off as  selfish individuals, has many touching moments in particular when they visit their long dead grand parents. It is a very beautiful scene which stresses the importance of family ties even after death and it never fails to move me.The special effects in the film of the great forest fire, people being turned into animals etc are top notch and give ""The Blue Bird"" a magical quality that can be enjoyed by all.I think it is a film that should be in all lovers of family films collections. ...I think you will love ""The Blue Bird"" even if you aren't a fan of Shirley Temple but just love lavish well made classics from Hollwood's golden age when such things were done so well and with so much care.",5,Totally Charming Classic With Shirley Temple Excellent In A Very Different Kind Of Role,1019347200,"04 21, 2002",2002,2906,"['Attacked', 'critics', 'failure', 'Box', 'Office', 'time', 'release', '1940', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'time', 'been', 'redeemed', 'now', 'quite', 'rightly', 'viewed', 'classic', 'film', 'time', 'containing', 'one', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'most', 'interesting', 'performances', 'public', 'critical', 'indifference', 'film', 'time', 'release', 'had', 'alot', 'do', 'fact', 'Hollywood', 'formerly', 'adorable', 'moppet', 'sweetheart', 'depression', 'years', 'was', 'now', 'playing', 'selfish', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'only', 'reformed', 'conclusion', 'story', 'also', 'film', 'less', 'upbeat', 'story', 'suffered', 'when', 'inevitably', 'compared', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'released', 'just', 'year', 'truly', 'love', 'film', 'strong', 'message', 'appreciating', 'what', 'actually', 'have', 'lives', 'opposed', 'always', 'thinking', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'believe', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'slightly', 'older', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'made', 'just', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'slipping', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'number', 'one', 'attraction', 'Box', 'Office', 'film', 'failure', 'combined', 'Shirley', 'declining', 'popularity', 'finally', 'broke', 'long', 'string', 'successes', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'had', 'enjoyed', '1930', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'films', 'one', 'more', 'unsuccesful', 'release', 'Young', 'People', 'also', '1940', 'reign', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Box', 'Office', 'Queen', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'definately', 'forever.Certainly', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'great', 'songs', 'show', 'bizzy', 'appeal', 'theme', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'one', 'indeed', 'many', 'morbid', 'qualities', 'believe', 'two', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'totally', 'separate', 'whole', 'production', 'ravishing', 'feast', 'eyes', 'sumptous', 'sets', 'gorgeous', 'color', 'costumnes', 'make', 'film', 'sight', 'eyes', 'Never', 'there', 'been', 'more', 'lavish', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'film', 'graveyard', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'eerie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'when', 'Temple', 'younger', 'brother', 'played', 'child', 'actor', 'Johnny', 'Russell', 'land', 'luxury', 'sets', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'beautiful', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'Laure', 'Hope', 'Crews', 'lend', 'considerable', 'talents', 'scenes', 'land', 'luzury', 'Gale', 'Sondergaard', 'deliciously', 'wicked', 'Cat.The', 'film', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'starting', 'off', 'selfish', 'individuals', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'particular', 'when', 'visit', 'long', 'dead', 'grand', 'parents', 'very', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'importance', 'family', 'ties', 'even', 'death', 'never', 'move', 'me.The', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'great', 'forest', 'fire', 'people', 'being', 'turned', 'animals', 'etc', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'give', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'magical', 'quality', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'all.I', 'think', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'lovers', 'family', 'films', 'collections', 'think', 'will', 'love', 'Blue', 'Bird', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'just', 'love', 'lavish', 'well', 'made', 'classics', 'Hollwood', 'golden', 'age', 'when', 'such', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'care']",N/A
