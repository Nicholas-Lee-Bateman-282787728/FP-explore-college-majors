245666,A3W3PK9TVKEH7Q,6301140869,Allen Jackson,"[0, 0]","This is one of my favorite movies of all time, a wonderful, indeed timeless, ""message"" film, typical of the better 1970s movies of this genre that were social commentaries.  Nothing in this film is dated except for the hairstyles (before the Marine haircuts early in the film!) and some of the hippie language.  Otherwise, this phenomenal film, that came out at/near the height of the Vietnam War, stands the test of time, in a big way.Darrin McGavin as the hard-as-nails Marine drill instructor (""DI""), Jan-Michael Vincent as the non-violent hippie drafted into his platoon, and Earl Holloman as the Senior DI who has even less sympathy for the hippie than McGavin's character does, all turn in among their best-ever performances, in this award-winning, 1970 made-for-TV movie.As it did for some other reviewers here, this movie contributed to shaping my life, not in the sense that I adopted a hippie lifestyle, but in seeing both points of view presented in this film.  McGavin and Vincent's characters are BOTH ""good guys""--but one is more traditional, regimented, and old-fashioned--also responsible for the other Marines and to the US gov't-- whereas the other is a naive, well-intentioned flower child, wanting to only (slightly self-centeredly) enjoy the pleasures of the world-- but also not wanting to harm anyone, even in war.The evolution of both characters in this film is wonderful, and quite interesting.  The dialog is superb, as is the acting.  I simply cannot stop watching it when it's on.The commercial VHS tape pictured above, recorded in SP mode of course, is an excellent color print-- sharp, vivid, and clean-looking (not old-looking), and the same goes for the sound quality--it's excellent.HIGHLY recommended to people of all ages.",5,"Absolutely all-time GREAT TV-movie!

245668,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6301140869,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 1]","When viewing ""Tribes,"" the surprisingly good 1970 made-for-TV film, you recall what a rewarding medium television could be during this era. This is not to say great drama is not churned out today, with scores of cable series leaving millions mesmerized. But the made-for-TV film was once a great haven for writers tackling issues within the confines of conservative network codes. The master of this art form was Rod Serling, penning multiple classics includingPatterns (1956)andPlayhouse 90 - Requiem for a Heavyweight [VHS] en route to a record six Emmys.""Tribes"" follows this classical tradition and was awarded several Emmys of its own including Best Screenplay (Tracy Keenan Wynn, Marvin Schwartz). It is perhaps best known as the film that made Jan-Michael Vincent a star. He's seen in the opening shot, adorned in long hair and hippie regalia, riding a bus. Contemporary folk music plays as he flashes the peace sign to other hippies walking down the street. The bus pulls through a military gate and we realize passengers are Vietnam draftees of every creed. The green recruits exit the bus and are immediately barked at by Drake, the camp drill instructor played by the incomparable Darren McGavin.The military boot-camp film is a genre unto itself, beginning in 1957 withThe D.I.starring Jack Webb. Through the years it evolved withAn Officer and A Gentlemanwith Louis Gossett, Jr. (in an Oscar-winning performance), ""Stripes"" with the perfectly cast Warren Oates,G.I. Janewith a similar storyline to ""Tribes,"" and Stanley Kubrick's explosively darkFull Metal Jacket. These films have an identical scene where greenhorns step off the bus to be faced by the blistering roar of a drill instructor. McGavin's Drake eyes Vincent for the first time, shocked by his long hair and sandals and screams, ""This must be a practical joke!"" It's not.Vincent's Adrian has lived an alternative life for several years, including a stint at a commune. When he's drafted, he chooses not to flee to Canada or burn his draft card. He receives his obligatory buzz cut, and we watch that long blond hair fall to the floor. To the great frustration of Drake, Adrian scores well on tests and appears physically superior to everyone in his unit. He refuses to fire a rifle however, finding it distasteful to shoot at a target representing a human being. Such pacifist leanings infuriate the drill instructors, including DePayster (Earl Holliman), who is convinced hippies are Communist infiltrations of American society.McGavin's Drake, exposed to the hippie lifestyle for the first time, can see the leadership potential in Adrian and quietly questions the morality of forcing a peaceful man to become a killer. Holliman's DePayster wants to flunk Adrian and essentially torture the pacifist out of him through intimidating physical drills. Of course, there's several soldiers who initially resent Adrian's habits, including meditation during the exhausting drills allowing him to achieve superior performances.There's an equal parts comedic and incredible scene as Drake walks into the soldiers' bunk room to discover every man meditating, loudly humming in unison. They've adopted Adrian's exercises to overcome the difficult Marine drills. Amazingly, Adrian has become the natural leader and men are following him as a united team, which is essentially the goal of all drill instructors. Drake is faced with a unique dilemma, and it troubles him.Vincent would achieve great stardom after ""Tribes,"" playing the title role in Disney'sThe World's Greatest Athleteand starring with Charles Bronson inThe Mechanicand Gene Hackman inBite The Bullet. By the 1990s, drug and alcohol issues derailed his career and he famously became a recluse, refusing interviews and disappearing on a ranch where he lives today. A story unique in Hollywood history, rarely has an actor achieved such heights only to walk away. ""Tribes"" is a good example of Vincent's appeal, with baby-faced looks and cool charisma.McGavin gives the performance of his career. He would go on to his own stardom with the cult-classic TV seriesKolchak - The Night Stalker. A brilliant character actor, he worked sporadically through the years content with making a living. ""Tribes"" allows him to flex his wonderful talents, perhaps fully realized for one of the few times.""Tribes,"" an unforgettable production of its era, reminded me of my own childhood in the early 1970s when teenagers on my block wore long hair and bell-bottoms. They drove a dented El Camino with the scent of pot billowing from the windows. My friends and I would sit on our banana-seat bikes and fantasize about the romantic life of these rebellious souls listening to Blind Faith 8-tracks as they burned rubber down the street. More often than not, my dad would then drag me to the barbershop and give me a buzz cut.",4,Obligatory buzz cut...,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,4837,"['When', 'viewing', 'Tribes', 'surprisingly',

245669,A23QJ631IG54ZM,6301140869,David A. Stanley,"[4, 5]","Tribes is certainly a period piece of 1970 with a strong liberal anti-establishment point of view.  Today it seems dated and blase`, yet it still has a magnetic attraction to viewers whether veterans, active duty military, or civilians.From a technical standpoint, there were some flaws (which seems inevitable in any hollywood production dealing with the military) and many ommissions about USMC boot camp (what happened to the long humps with helmet, flak jacket and packs, field exercises, bivuacking, etc?), but overall they got the flavor of boot camp correct.  As a former US Marine Commissioned Officer, I never attended MCRD San Diego (I attended OCS Quantico, VA), but as an airline pilot I have flown into Lindbergh Field, San Diego, CA on many occasions and have seen the grinder, PT fields, obstacle course, buildings etc. from the airport terminal.  Not much has changed in appearance since 1970.Gunnery Sgt Drake, the platoon DI, was not really all that tough, and as a matter of fact, was IMO a little too lenient with Pvt Adrian.  In real life, not many DIs would have taken the time and trouble to accomodate a trouble maker, malcontent, or non-conformist.  Pvt Adrian would have been either recycled, sent to motivational platoon, and/or processed out.  Remember the DI has to screen and train 60 plus recruits in every platoon over a set syllabus and time schedule, so they just don't have the time to concentrate too long on one problem child.  First Sgt DeFreys, the Company Chief DI, may have been an annoying jerk but he was right in suggesting to Drake that Adrian needed to be either recycled or sent to motivational platoon.But this is the land of TV and movies, and audience sympathy in 1970 was not with the USMC but with Pvt Adrian and other platoon members.I would like to see Tribes put on DVD, but I was only able to find a used and inflated VHS tape produced in the 1980s.  There are some never opened ""new"" VHS copies floating around from time to time, but they are too expensive in my opinion.  [...]One last commentary on life in 2008 vs. 1970.  I realize that most movies are filmed out of sequence and are not authentic and that more people smoked then, but look how skinny and in shape most of the recruits in Tribes were vs. the average 18 year old today.

Watching it after growing more mature, and having my own military experience behind me, it wasn't quite so horrifying.

One volunteers for the Marines, rather than being drafted.

This is how the armed forces function, folks -- particularly in the infantry.Third, Adrian really did have more self-control than the other guys, with his relaxation techniques.  He wasn't needlessly tense or worried over a day's events, and he obviously had the physical make-up for doing well as a Marine.Fourth, that nonsense with the rifle -- Adrian crying and shivering when handed a rifle -- was utterly absurd.  Adrian had sufficient self-control to perform all sorts of difficult physical tasks -- yet he cracks up completely, whines and moans and cries when handed a rifle to fire?  He can't simply take a deep breath and operate a small mechanical device, launching a projectile at a completely inanimate target?  Give me a break.Fifth, the film did include positive comments about military service, specifically the reference to the mix of people and skin colors in the training platoon, and the benefits of such close interaction by such differing sorts of folks.Finally, I bet all of the surviving ""Adrians"" of the Hippie Movement are kicking themselves now, to some extent, for not bucking up, shutting up and simply enduring that eight weeks of basic training back then -- less than an eyeblink in the whole time of their lives.  They know, deep inside, they would have emerged better for doing so, and would not look back upon those failings with contempt that is actually shame in disguise.",3,Interesting In Retrospect,1036454400,"11 5, 2002",2002,2587,"['saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'found', 'horrifying', 'Oh', 'gosh', 'shaved', 'off', 'hair', 'Oh', 'goodness', 'abuse', 'forced', 'endure', 'Oh', 'lands', 'are', 'so', 'cruel', 'gentle', 'young', 'flower', 'Well', 'more', 'two', 'decades', 'passed', 'even', 'thought', 'movie', 'again', 'viewed', 'Watching', 'growing', 'more', 'mature', 'having', 'own', 'military', 'experience', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'horrifying', 'Then', 'again', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'yet', '20', 'future', 'infinite', 'eight', 'weeks', 'boot', 'camp', 'eternity', 'First', 'what', 'was', 'hippie', 'kid', 'doing', 'there', 'One', 'volunteers', 'Marines', 'rather', 'being', 'drafted', 'guy', 'had', 'sign', 'name', 'somewhere', 'must', 'have', 'read', 'document', 'really', 'explanation', 'beeing', 'so', 'apparently', 'clueless', 'process.Second', 'drill', 'instructor', 'was', 'perfectly', 'fair', 'was', 'following', 'program', 'doing', 'job', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'particularly', 'horrifying', 'mean', 'one', 'hippie', 'recruit', 'McGavin', 'made', 'clear', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'Adrian', 'asked', 'purpose', 'particular', 'exercise', 'replying', 'must', 'do', 'told', 'do', 'only', 'reason', 'need', 'have', 'how', 'armed', 'forces', 'function', 'folks', 'particularly', 'infantry.Third', 'Adrian', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'more', 'self-control', 'other', 'guys', 'relaxation', 'techniques', 'was', ""n't"", 'needlessly', 'tense', 'worried', 'day', 'events', 'obviously', 'had', 'physical', 'make-up', 'doing', 'well', 'Marine.Fourth', 'nonsense', 'rifle', 'Adrian', 'crying', 'shivering', 'when', 'handed', 'rifle', 'was', 'utterly', 'absurd', 'Adrian', 'had', 'sufficient', 'self-control', 'perform', 'sorts', 'difficult', 'physical', 'tasks', 'yet', 'up', 'completely', 'whines', 'moans', 'cries', 'when', 'handed', 'rifle', 'fire', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'take', 'deep', 'breath', 'operate', 'small', 'mechanical', 'device', 'launching', 'projectile', 'completely', 'inanimate', 'target', 'Give', 'break.Fifth', 'film', 'did', 'include', 'positive', 'comments', 'military', 'service', 'specifically', 'reference', 'mix', 'people', 'skin', 'colors', 'training', 'platoon', 'benefits', 'such', 'close', 'interaction', 'such', 'differing', 'sorts', 'folks.Finally', 'bet', 'surviving', 'Adrians', 'Hippie', 'Movement', 'are', 'kicking', 'now', 'extent', 'not', 'bucking', 'up', 'shutting', 'up', 'simply', 'enduring', 'eight', 'weeks', 'basic', 'training', 'back', 'then', 'less', 'eyeblink', 'whole', 'time', 'lives', 'know', 'deep', 'inside', 'would', 'have', 'emerged', 'better', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'not', 'look', 'back', 'failings', 'contempt', 'actually', 'shame', 'disguise']",Vuelven los Siete Magníficos
245675,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6301140869,Martin Asiner,"[40, 42]","TRIBES belongs to a little-known sub-genre of 'The young man goes off to war' movie, best exemplified by Jack Webb in THE DI. Unlike THE DI, which has stood the test of time as the prototype of all such movies, TRIBES now is seen as a curious period piece in which a hippie is drafted into the US Marines and finds himself squarely opposed by the short-haired establishment symbolized by a marine drill instructor, superbly played by Darren McGavin. Jan-Michael Vincent plays Adrian, the hippie.  Much of this movie plays like a rerun of THE DI.  There is the hard-as-nails DI breaking down the recruits only to rebuild them into the sanctioned image of gung-ho marines.  Early in the film, the DI soon realizes that Adrian is a square peg who has been ordered to fit into a round hole.  Adrian shows up at boot camp wearing long hair and sandals, causing a predictably angry response from the DI.  At this point the movie becomes a test of culture-vs-culture, with each side refusing to blink.  Adrian is seen as some sort of mythic superman who is able to draw from his inner chi the strength and stamina to outperform all his fellow recruits.  The battle from the DI's point of view is external: the drill field, the shooting range, the obstacle course.  From Adrian's perspective, it is internal. Whenever he is called upon to perform heroic feats of exercise, the scene shifts from Adrian's 'now' to Adrian's 'then.' This 'then' is punctuated by hippie music and a pretty girl with flowers in her hair.  The DI does not know how Adrian manages to excel but he is pretty sure that he is up against a force of internalized nature that soon threatens to spread to the other recruits who see Adrian's daily exploits and beg him to reveal his Mahesh Yogi secrets.  Adrian explains in pseudo-hippie jargon of the late 1960's that ""Man, you have to move yourself from the present world of hurt to a past world of good.""It is not difficult to see that in any confrontation between DI and recruit, any victory by the recruit can only be temporary.  Surprisingly enough, Adrian's DI blinks first. He passes Adrian only to learn that the senior DI, who sees the hippie philosophy of Adrian as a menace greater than the communist dialectic of Marx and Engels, has failed Adrian on a technicality and orders him recycled to repeat the entire twelve week course of basic training.  Adrian goes AWOL, thereby affirming the power of the state over the individual.  Yet, the victory of the state may be as hollow and as ephemeral as was the early victory of the recruit over the system. As a new group of recruits enters the very grounds where Adrian trained just recently, the DI stands ready to receive them, but this time he carries with him a flower of Adrian to remind him that though tribes may differ dramatically if only externally, there is some core resemblance that connects hippie to DI and the state to the individual.  Perhaps it is this knowledge that we are more alike than commonly perceived which makes this movie eminently watchable--even if Jack Webb would not understand.",4,Tribes: The Walls Don't Come Tumbling Down,1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,3080,"['TRIBES', 'little-known', 'sub-genre', ""'The"", 'young', 'man', 'war', 'movie', 'best', 'exemplified', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'THE', 'DI', 'DI', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'prototype', 'such', 'movies', 'TRIBES', 'now', 'seen', 'curious', 'period', 'piece', 'hippie', 'drafted', 'US', 'Marines', 'squarely', 'opposed', 'short-haired', 'establishment', 'symbolized', 'marine', 'drill', 'instructor', 'superbly', 'played', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'Adrian', 'hippie', 'Much', 'movie', 'rerun', 'THE', 'DI', 'hard-as-nails', 'DI', 'breaking', 'down', 'recruits', 'only', 'rebuild', 'sanctioned', 'image', 'gung-ho', 'marines', 'Early', 'film', 'DI', 'soon', 'Adrian', 'square', 'peg', 'who', 'been', 'ordered', 'fit', 'round', 'hole', 'Adrian', 'up', 'boot', 'camp', 'wearing', 'long', 'hair', 'sandals', 'causing', 'predictably', 'angry', 'response', 'DI', 'point', 'movie', 'test', 'culture-vs-culture', 'side', 'refusing', 'blink', 'Adrian', 'seen', 'sort', 'mythic', 'superman', 'who', 'able', 'draw', 'inner', 'chi', 'strength', 'stamina', 'outperform', 'fellow', 'recruits', 'battle', 'DI', 'point', 'view', 'external', 'drill', 'field', 'shooting', 'range', 'obstacle', 'course', 'Adrian', 'perspective', 'internal', 'called', 'perform', 'heroic', 'feats', 'exercise', 'scene', 'shifts', 'Adrian', ""'now"", 'Adrian', ""'then"", ""'then"", 'punctuated', 'hippie', 'music', 'pretty', 'girl', 'flowers', 'hair', 'DI', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'Adrian', 'excel', 'pretty', 'sure', 'up', 'force', 'internalized', 'nature', 'soon', 'spread', 'other', 'recruits', 'who', 'see', 'Adrian', 'daily', 'exploits', 'beg', 'reveal', 'Mahesh', 'Yogi', 'secrets', 'Adrian', 'explains', 'pseudo-hippie', 'jargon', 'late', '1960', 'Man', 'have', 'move', 'present', 'world', 'hurt', 'past', 'world', 'good', 'not', 'difficult', 'see', 'confrontation', 'DI', 'recruit', 'victory', 'recruit', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'temporary', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'Adrian', 'DI', 'blinks', 'first', 'Adrian', 'only', 'learn', 'senior', 'DI', 'who', 'hippie', 'philosophy', 'Adrian', 'menace', 'greater', 'communist', 'dialectic', 'Marx', 'Engels', 'failed', 'Adrian', 'technicality', 'orders', 'recycled', 'repeat', 'entire', 'twelve', 'week', 'course', 'basic', 'training', 'Adrian', 'AWOL', 'thereby', 'affirming', 'power', 'state', 'individual', 'victory', 'state', 'may', 'be', 'hollow', 'as', 'ephemeral', 'was', 'early', 'victory', 'recruit', 'system', 'new', 'group', 'recruits', 'enters', 'very', 'where', 'Adrian', 'trained', 'just', 'recently', 'DI', 'ready', 'receive', 'time', 'flower', 'Adrian', 'remind', 'tribes', 'may', 'differ', 'dramatically', 'only', 'externally', 'core', 'resemblance', 'hippie', 'DI', 'state', 'individual', 'Perhaps', 'knowledge', 'are', 'more', 'alike', 'commonly', 'perceived', 'movie', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'even', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'would', 'not', 'understand']",Vuelven los Siete Magníficos

245677,ALD1CRUBY1365,6301140869,R. L. MILLER,"[12, 32]","Or was it conceived out of a laughable naiivete? During my own citizenship in the Woodstock Nation, I saw it as a depiction of my ""brotherhood"" scoring a minor but significant victory over the Establishment and its War Pigs. Jan Michael Vincent's ""hunky iconoclast"" roles have always had a cooler-than-thou aspect to them--in this film he plays a hippie drafted into the Marines and confronted by a drill sergeant played by Darren McGavin. The concept of hippie-dippy hero versus the Semper Fi villain approaches cliche, however. Perhaps Adrian (Vincent) has a wider worldview than the Sarge, but what people like Adrian (and myself as well at the time) refused to understand was that if you're in the military, you're in a profession where people are by definition unusually focused on the ideals of that profession, and that's bound to be seen as narrow-minded by outsiders. The irony is that this ""narrow-mindedness"" is necessary in a person whose job is protecting his country. You find that quality to a significant extent in police officers as well for the same reason--their job is domestic defense. So the clash of cultures in this film might make for a good story, were it not for the fact that there's an obvious partisan slant here. The problem is that in this story, the good guys and bad guys get mixed up. These two guys are not supposed to be enemies--they're both Marines. Isn't it Adrian's job to face the fact that he's temporarily lost his civilian status and is supposed to act like a soldier for awhile? Isn't it the sergeant's job to turn him into that soldier? And isn't it ridiculous to portray the sergeant as being out to destroy Adrian--a citizen of his own country? Most of the blurbs about the 1950s film ""Reefer Madness"" describe it as ""campy"" for its inaccurate depiction of the effects of marijuana, but no one knew back in those days that the real menace of that drug is more subtle. Three decades after first seeing this film, I get the impression that it's roughly the same kind of camp. I was just too much of a peace zealot at the time to see it as such. Belief in peace does not mean you demonize your country's soldiery--they're just people who were once civilians like you and hope to go back to that status some day.",2,Was this movie intentionally campy?,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,2257,"['was', 'conceived', 'laughable', 'naiivete', 'own', 'citizenship', 'Woodstock', 'Nation', 'saw', 'depiction', 'brotherhood', 'scoring', 'minor', 'significant', 'victory', 'Establishment', 'War', 'Pigs', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'hunky', 'iconoclast', 'roles', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'cooler-than-thou', 'aspect', 'film', 'hippie', 'drafted', 'Marines', 'confronted', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'played', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'concept', 'hippie-dippy', 'hero', 'Semper', 'Fi', 'villain', 'approaches', 'cliche', 'however', 'Perhaps', 'Adrian', 'Vincent', 'wider', 'worldview', 'Sarge', 'what', 'people', 'Adrian', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'refused', 'understand', 'was', ""'re"", 'military', ""'re"", 'profession', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'definition', 'unusually', 'focused', 'ideals', 'profession', 'bound', 'be', 'seen', 'narrow-minded', 'outsiders', 'irony', 'narrow-mindedness', 'necessary', 'person', 'job', 'protecting', 'country', 'find', 'quality', 'significant', 'extent', 'police', 'officers', 'as', 'well', 'same', 'reason', 'job', 'domestic', 'defense', 'clash', 'cultures', 'film', 'might', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'obvious', 'partisan', 'slant', 'here', 'problem', 'story', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'enemies', ""'re"", 'Marines', ""n't"", 'Adrian', 'job', 'face', 'fact', 'temporarily', 'lost', 'civilian', 'status', 'supposed', 'act', 'soldier', 'awhile', ""n't"", 'sergeant', 'job', 'turn', 'soldier', ""n't"", 'ridiculous', 'portray', 'sergeant', 'being', 'out', 'destroy', 'Adrian', 'citizen', 'own', 'country', 'Most', 'blurbs', '1950s', 'film', 'Reefer', 'Madness', 'describe', 'campy', 'inaccurate', 'depiction', 'effects', 'marijuana', 'one', 'knew', 'back', 'days', 'real', 'menace', 'drug', 'more', 'subtle', 'Three', 'decades', 'first', 'seeing', 'film', 'get', 'impression', 'roughly', 'same', 'kind', 'camp', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'peace', 'zealot', 'time', 'see', 'such', 'Belief', 'peace', 'not', 'mean', 'demonize', 'country', 'soldiery', ""'re"", 'just', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'once', 'civilians', 'hope', 'go', 'back', 'status', 'day']",Vuelven los Siete Magníficos

245679,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6301140869,Wuchak,"[2, 2]","""Tribes"" came out in 1970, months after the Kent State shootings at the height of the protest against the Vietnam war. It was released on TV in America but theatrically overseas as ""The Soldier Who Declared Peace."" The film features an interesting culture clash between two Marine drill instructors and a hippie draftee. One drill instructor, Drake (Darren McGavin), starts to see the merits of the hippie, Adrian (Jan-Michael Vincent), but the senior drill instructor refuses to budge an inch and completely rejects Adrian.Adrian basically opens up a whole new world for Drake, one that he never really considered. What turns Drake's head and makes him take notice is that Adrian isn't some stereotypical drugged-out hippie; he's the most intelligent and physically fit recruit in his platoon, but how can this be since he dropped out of school and is a hippie? Through a learning attitude and meditational practices Adrian has tapped into a power source that gives him the mental and physical edge over the rest of the recruits. Drake SEES it and can't deny it, especially since Adrian's techniques start working with the other recruits as well, and ultimately the whole platoon!This shakens Drake because he had pegged all hippies as drug-addled, lazy vagabonds. But the evidence is undeniable and he can't help but develop respect for the hippie. It also rattles him because he comes to realize that Adrian, despite being only 19 years-old or so, is superior to him in some ways. In other words, the mentor could learn a thing or two from the mentee, which isn't the way it's supposed to be in boot camp. The good thing is that Drake is humble enough -- teachable enough -- to receive from Adrian whereas the senior drill instructor (Earl Holliman) is too arrogant and ape-ish to do anything but spurn him.The film is smart in that it doesn't paint Adrian as omnipotent or wholly wise, nor is Drake the opposite. They both have valuable perspectives, intelligence & developed skills and can learn from each other, if they're open. For instance, Adrian is extraordinary when it comes to mental discipline and the power to overcome the physical and mental challenges of boot camp, but he fails miserable on the rifle range because his indoctrination cripples him from merely shooting a rifle, let alone shooting a human being. Adrian obviously adheres to absolute pacifism, which refuses to ever turn to violence in response to opposition or evil. Clearly Adrian could learn a thing or two about the necessity of self-defense and opposing people who reject the grace of peace and are bent on destruction or evil. It's called limited pacifism, which is what Jesus Christ advocated -- a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when necessary. See my review of ""Billy Jack"" for more details, if interested.The film was shot at the Marine Corps Recruiting Depot in San Diego; I went to boot camp at the one in Parris Island, SC. The depiction of Marine boot camp is pretty accurate, although ""Full Metal Jacket"" is the best cinematic depiction. I bring up my experience at boot camp because of some parallels with the movie. For instance, a spiritual leader rose up in my platoon, much as Adrian does in ""Tribes,"" although he was older than Adrain, about 30, and he adhered to a different spiritual discipline, Christianity. As the weeks wore on he proved himself over and over -- his mental/spiritual stamina -- and he attracted a formidable following, who hanged around him during free time, much like the recruits do with Adrian. One similarity of these two is that they both led through humble, gentle wisdom rather than a domineering, bloviating spirit, like the drill instructors. In other words, they led without putting on the puke-inducing airs of conventional ""leadership."" They led simply by influencing people positively by their undeniable wisdom and the power they've obviously tapped into. This is true leadership.I mention this because there are other ways to tap into extraordinary power than Transcedental Meditation, like Adrian, even superior ways. The Christian recruit I mentioned did it too, although it wasn't as unrealistically overdone as it was in the film with Adrian. Of course I realize it's a film and the filmmakers had to exaggerate some things to keep it interesting for its 90-minute runtime. What was unrealistic? Well, for one, the idea that Adrian was able to win over the ENTIRE platoon and, secondly, that every recruit was able to enter into such a deep state of meditation that Drake had a hard time waking them out of their inner bliss one morning, including Quentin who's taking drugs and is clearly unstable -- unstable enough to attempt suicide. This is an obvious plot hole: If Quentin was able to enter into such a focused meditation that he couldn't hear the DI trying to wake him up, how was he as unstable and suicidal as he was?I bring the above up because ""Tribes"" shouldn't be pigeonholed as TM propaganda (although it may have that effect on some) anymore than the Christian's actions in my platoon could be construed as Christian propaganda. (By the way, I didn't hang around this guy, the things I mentioned above were just things I noticed and it somewhat influenced me years later. So I guess he did positively influence me, huh?). The film simply shows that there's more for you -- more power, knowledge, wisdom -- if you seek it, but this treasure exists outside conventional training and educational structures.What's interesting is that both the drill instructors in the film are probably Christian, at least nominally. And it shows how sterile and powerless Christianity has become in the West, at least in some ways. Believe it or not, the Bible actually supports meditation, as Psalm 119:15-16 shows, not to mention the incredible power available through spiritual rebirth and the baptism of the Spirit. These dynamic aspects of Christianity are generally written off, ignored or mocked by most denominations and blockheaded pastors, which is shameful. Is it any wonder that people -- even professing believers -- can be intrigued by TM and other such disciplines to the point that they think Christianity is somehow a lesser belief system? Actually, it's far more than a mere belief system or spiritual discipline; I'd elaborate but I don't want this review to turn into Christian propaganda, lol.FINAL WORD: ""Tribes"" is an amazing film, but it's not for people who need constant action, explosions and CGI to be entertained. It's a boot camp drama about the clash of two cultures and the possibility of the them receiving from each other.GRADE: A-",5,There's power if you seek it,1390780800,"01 27,

Well these days most TV-movies are cable based, but whatever the case, most of it's thrown together trash. The early 70s were a great time for TV movies (""Tribes, ""Duel,"" ""Brian's Song,"" etc). Little did I know as a young kid these prime-time specials would become ageless classics.Everyone in this film does a top-notch job of acting, no matter how small the part. I don't care a whole lot for the melody ""Tribes Are a Gathering"" played thoughout the film, but it still does a pretty good job of setting the tone.Too bad  ""Tribes"" isn't available on DVD.
