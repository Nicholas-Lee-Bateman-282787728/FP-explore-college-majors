Richard Chamberlain was and will forever be my favorite Casanova. I liked how the two hour movie breaks Casanova's life into three parts with a young actor playing him in his teens and twenties and Chamberlain taking over the last two-thirds his life.Chamberlain's portrayal of Casanova was leaps and bounds ahead of Heath Ledger's portrayal. That is not a knock on the brilliant Ledger. The script Ledger had was nothing to write home about. Nevertheless, the movie was a delight to watch. The VHS I have does contain some brief nudity, but according to some other reviewers even the 122 minute version I have is a censored version. Perhaps, but I also remember seeing the movie when it was originaly aired in 1987 and there was nothing even remotely close to nudity broadcast on that prime time ABC show. So I'm content with what I have. But if in a few years someone comes out with an unedited DVD version I will be the first in line to buy it!This is a Five-Star production because the writing, directing and acting are all A+. The female co-stars are absolutely beautiful! The emotion Chamberlain shows after being duped by the woman he loves was believable and hits any man hard. We've all been there, guys! Yes, overall I can think of no other Casanova production in the last 25-30 years that can compare to this one.A.

In fact, I think (though Amazon doesn't give running times) that the VHS version is considerably shorter than the broadcast version, which clocked in at 143 minutes; the European VHS release was 168 minutes long and there's a Japanese laserdisc version which is a whopping 174 minutes.  Also, if you go by Playboy magazine's 1988 pictorial on the movie, there was a considerable amount of nudity which didn't make it (of course) into the original U.S. broadcast version, or (less explicably) into the VHS release.  It seems that the bare female flesh was reserved for the European version.  If and when this movie is put on DVD, I hope we'll get the full, uncut version.
