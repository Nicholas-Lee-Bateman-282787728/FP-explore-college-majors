1347943,A91WK0GREKLN9,B003K1NGXE,"Bradford M. Smith ""smithb""","[14, 14]","After just receiving the new complete set, I decided to do some comparisons with the previous ""Best Of..."" sets (also from TMG) that I still own. Here are my findings:1. All 24 of the episodes previously released on the ""Best Of..."" collections are on average 37 seconds longer then the matching episodes on the new set. With differences as little as a few seconds to the worst offender being about 80 seconds shorter. The ""Best Of..."" collection averaging around 49 minutes per episode while the complete collection around 48 minutes and 20 seconds per episode. Therefore, both are from syndicated prints since originally they would have expected to run somewhere between 50 and 52 minutes an episode. Without comparing the differences across each episode, it would be hard to qualify the importance of the additional cuts to the storyline.2. To fit 5 episodes per disk on the complete collection required an average size of 1480 mb (or a bitrate of 4050 Kb/s) per episode compared to the 1850 mb (or a bitrate of 4850 Kb/s) per episode on the ""Best Of..."" sets. Now this would seem to be an issue but I don't believe there is any real negative impact in this particular case. The remastered Star Trek TOS episodes are around 1850 mb per episode as well but they are very clean images with a fair amount of detail. The prints for Checkmate are already soft and show wear and damage. Having played around with TV captures and various bitrates myself, I think 4050 Kb/s is more then enough for the quality of these prints and don't feel any discernable differences would be accomplished by increasing it any more. TMG appears to prefer 3 disk sets and so I wouldn't be surprised if they just encoded to fill the disks for the ""Best Of..."" sets.3. I did make a comparison of one episode across sets based on some comments from a previous poster. In this case, the complete collection print actually had better video quality then the ""Best Of..."" print. It had less damage in the opening and better contrast. However, without extensive previewing I can't say that this is always the case between sets.Interestingly, my conclusion based on the limited analysis I did is that they probably came across another source for syndicated prints that included all episodes with either similar or a bit better quality (although slightly shorter running times) and just went with them for the new set. This would potentially explain the differences I noted. However, without TMG input it is hard to know for sure.",4,Different prints then previously released,1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,2499,"['just', 'receiving', 'new', 'complete', 'set', 'decided', 'do', 'comparisons', 'previous', 'Best', 'sets', 'also', 'TMG', 'still', 'own', 'Here', 'are', 'findings:1', '24', 'episodes', 'previously', 'released', 'Best', 'collections', 'are', 'average', '37', 'seconds', 'longer', 'then', 'matching', 'episodes', 'new', 'set', 'differences', 'as', 'little', 'few', 'seconds', 'worst', 'offender', 'being', '80', 'seconds', 'shorter', 'Best', 'collection', 'averaging', 'around', '49', 'minutes', 'episode', 'complete', 'collection', '48', 'minutes', '20', 'seconds', 'episode', 'Therefore', 'are', 'syndicated', 'prints', 'originally', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'run', 'somewhere', '50', '52', 'minutes', 'episode', 'comparing', 'differences', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'qualify', 'importance', 'additional', 'cuts', 'storyline.2', 'fit', '5', 'episodes', 'disk', 'complete', 'collection', 'required', 'average', 'size', '1480', 'mb', 'bitrate', '4050', 'Kb/s', 'episode', 'compared', '1850', 'mb', 'bitrate', '4850', 'Kb/s', 'episode', 'Best', 'sets', 'Now', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'issue', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'real', 'negative', 'impact', 'particular', 'case', 'remastered', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TOS', 'episodes', 'are', '1850', 'mb', 'per', 'episode', 'well', 'are', 'very', 'clean', 'images', 'fair', 'amount', 'detail', 'prints', 'Checkmate', 'are', 'already', 'soft', 'show', 'wear', 'damage', 'Having', 'played', 'TV', 'captures', 'various', 'bitrates', 'think', '4050', 'Kb/s', 'more', 'then', 'enough', 'quality', 'prints', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'discernable', 'differences', 'would', 'be', 'accomplished', 'increasing', 'more', 'TMG', 'prefer', '3', 'disk', 'sets', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'just', 'encoded', 'fill', 'disks', 'Best', 'sets.3', 'did', 'make', 'comparison', 'one', 'episode', 'sets', 'based', 'comments', 'previous', 'poster', 'case', 'complete', 'collection', 'print', 'actually', 'had', 'better', 'video', 'quality', 'then', 'Best', 'print', 'had', 'less', 'damage', 'opening', 'better', 'contrast', 'However', 'extensive', 'previewing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'always', 'case', 'sets.Interestingly', 'conclusion', 'based', 'limited', 'analysis', 'did', 'probably', 'came', 'source', 'syndicated', 'prints', 'included', 'episodes', 'similar', 'bit', 'better', 'quality', 'slightly', 'shorter', 'running', 'times', 'just', 'went', 'new', 'set', 'would', 'potentially', 'explain', 'differences', 'noted', 'However', 'TMG', 'input', 'hard', 'know', 'sure']",Checkmate - The Complete Series Set!

1347944,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B003K1NGXE,Brent Butler,"[6, 6]","Checkmate was a detective series with a very original premise: a detective agency using the latest investigative techniques that endeavored to solve/stop crimes BEFORE they happened. You might imagine that this was a very difficult premise for the writers to stay true to, and you'd be right. They didn't always manage to match the premise, but the stories were in any case inventive enough to offer some surprises when compared to standard detective fare. When the stories did live up to the premise, they were clever and entertaining indeed.The show provided early looks to TV viewers at Doug McClure and Sebastian Cabot. Both played their roles to perfection ... McClure as the brash and personable young partner, and Cabot as the learned, brilliant investigative perfectionist. Anthony George, the leader of the trio, was solid as the concerned professional and clever tactician. Unfortunately, much like Anthony Eisley in ""Hawaiian Eye"", Checkmate was the high point of George's TV career. After Checkmate he had a couple of stints in soap operas, and otherwise guest starring roles.Like other series of that day (Maverick and 77 Sunset Strip, for example), I remembered liking Checkmate as a kid, but at this point couldn't remember any details about it. I'm finding it very entertaining to rediscover a show I liked as a kid, but from an adult perspective where I obviously understand much more about the stories than I did then. For a fan of nostalgic TV shows, this is a good choice, and the price is a bargain.The DVD presentation is far from pristine, but picture quality is a major cut above what would have been seen in syndicated re-runs over the years. I've found that in most older movies and TV shows, if the story is compelling, you soon lose track of the flaws in the picture, and that is certainly the case here.As other reviewers have noted, Checkmate was chock full of big name guest stars, as well as early looks at stars who would shine in major ways a few years hence. For example, one early show has Mary Tyler Moore in a minor role, a couple of years before she would become a household name in ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"".I give this one a strong recommendation.",4,Inventive and ambitious detective series,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,2187,"['Checkmate', 'was', 'detective', 'series', 'very', 'original', 'premise', 'detective', 'agency', 'using', 'latest', 'investigative', 'techniques', 'endeavored', 'solve/stop', 'crimes', 'happened', 'might', 'imagine', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'premise', 'writers', 'stay', 'true', ""'d"", 'be', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'manage', 'match', 'premise', 'stories', 'were', 'case', 'inventive', 'enough', 'offer', 'surprises', 'when', 'compared', 'standard', 'detective', 'fare', 'When', 'stories', 'did', 'live', 'up', 'premise', 'were', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'indeed.The', 'show', 'provided', 'early', 'looks', 'TV', 'viewers', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', 'played', 'roles', 'perfection', 'McClure', 'brash', 'personable', 'young', 'partner', 'Cabot', 'learned', 'brilliant', 'investigative', 'perfectionist', 'Anthony', 'George', 'leader', 'trio', 'was', 'solid', 'concerned', 'professional', 'clever', 'tactician', 'Unfortunately', 'much', 'Anthony', 'Eisley', 'Hawaiian', 'Eye', 'Checkmate', 'was', 'high', 'point', 'George', 'TV', 'career', 'Checkmate', 'had', 'couple', 'stints', 'soap', 'operas', 'otherwise', 'guest', 'starring', 'roles.Like', 'other', 'series', 'day', 'Maverick', '77', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'example', 'remembered', 'liking', 'Checkmate', 'kid', 'point', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'details', ""'m"", 'finding', 'very', 'entertaining', 'rediscover', 'show', 'liked', 'kid', 'adult', 'perspective', 'where', 'obviously', 'understand', 'much', 'more', 'stories', 'did', 'then', 'fan', 'nostalgic', 'TV', 'shows', 'good', 'choice', 'price', 'bargain.The', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'far', 'pristine', 'picture', 'quality', 'major', 'cut', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'syndicated', 're-runs', 'years', ""'ve"", 'found', 'most', 'older', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'story', 'compelling', 'soon', 'lose', 'track', 'flaws', 'picture', 'certainly', 'case', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Checkmate', 'was', 'chock', 'full', 'big', 'name', 'guest', 'stars', 'as', 'well', 'early', 'looks', 'stars', 'who', 'would', 'shine', 'major', 'ways', 'few', 'years', 'hence', 'example', 'one', 'early', 'show', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'minor', 'role', 'couple', 'years', 'would', 'become', 'household', 'name', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', '.I', 'give', 'one', 'strong', 'recommendation']",Checkmate - The Complete Series Set!

1347946,A1P7S9FE1QPK31,B003K1NGXE,"Collectorman606 ""Collectorman606""","[0, 0]","""Checkmate"" is a vintage crime show from the early 1960's (1960 - 1962) and is rather obscure. I was fortunate to grow-up in a city where it popped-up as reruns on a station or two for quite a time after its initial run.  However, I have not seen this show in decades and was thrilled to see it released on DVD.  The premise of the show has been described in other reviews so I will share some gripes for prospective buyers to consider:  First, the initial release of the two ""Best of Checkmate"" DVD sets (which I bought) forced me to ""double-dip"" on episodes included in the complete set.  Second, the quality of the DVD images is ""nostalgic""....Watching these episodes reminded me of watching the reruns on old independent UHF stations tettering on bankruptcy way back in the 1960's/1970's.  In other words, the image and sound quality were less than par but fortunately still watchable.  Third, the DVDs themselves had nicks and scratches for no apparent reason.  It took me three attempts to get a ""scratch free"" set.  Obviously, teh manufacturer, Timeless Video, has quality control issues.  Finally, Amazon.Com delivered two of the three sets in cardboard wraparound packages where the DVD sets arrived slightly crushed....  When will Amazon.Com ever learn?

1347951,AZB4CQ9JZSUQB,B003K1NGXE,Eric Pregosin,"[39, 46]","For years my dad told me about this great series, and now I can enjoy it myself any time I want.  This team of 3 private detectives are not like any you will see again, and they do their job well (as many of you know my role model is a pretty good one at that).  There mission was to prevent major crimes BEFORE they happen.  That is not something you see today.  But from 1960 to 1962, it did happen for 70 hour long episodes.  Hence the name of their organization, Checkmate.  The stars:  Anthony George as Don Corey, well experienced private detective, Doug McClure as Jed Sills, his junior partner who has a weak spot for the girls but still gets the job done to everyone's satisfaction.  Along for the ride is Sebastian Cabot as Carl Hyatt, a former Oxford professor of criminology who now teaches at the local university (the series takes place in San Francisco I believe).  I would not be surprised if the good doctor obtained some of his methods from Sherlock Holmes himself.  The series as I said ran 2 seasons, and 70 episodes (not much time for reruns well considering it was the early 60s, reruns were still a new concept or maybe even non existing one at the time) with a guest star list that could fill their own personalized volume of Who's Who.  Joining the team in Season 2 sporadically was Jack Betts as Chris Devlin, a ""new recruit"".  This series has been previously video released in 2 12 episode, 3 disc spurts (1 from each season) in 2007 and 2008 (the latter containing at least 1 Devlin episode).  The manufacturer also released a hard to find 2 disc 4 episode third set later on that year (2008) as well which did not duplicate the episodes in the above mentioned ""Best of"" sets (remember those words don't always mean the best episodes, but is advertising ploy to get you to buy) so if you could find it, at the time it was worth the purchase.  Several episodes have also been released by the ""el cheapos"" who offer compilations of old cop/detective shows like Dragnet 50s, Ellery Queen 50s and others in a variety pack.  Most likely, the episodes in these sets are now duplicates of Timeless Video's 3 previously mentioned sets.  When I found the 3rd set, and I emailed the manufacturer about it's availability and they told me how selective it was, they also offered to put me on a waiting list as they working on this mega set for hopefully a soon release at the time.  Now just in time for the show's 50th anniversary (although it took an extra month from the street date to get copies to other retailers including Amazon), HERE IT IS, all 70 shows, 5 each on 14 discs, uncut and uninterrupted which of course makes the other 3 sets worthless.  This set is definitely a keeper, if nothing else for the array of guest stars.  For those of you who only remember watching Tony George for the short time he was on Dark Shadows, Doug McClure for his westerns, the late 80s sci fi sit com, Out Of The World, and other stuff, and Sebastian Cabot for Family Affair and his work for Disney (and for whatever else is on Jack Betts' resume for that matter), you are in for a treat.

1347952,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B003K1NGXE,Gary P. Cohen,"[119, 123]","From 1960 to 1962, Checkmate was my favorite television show.  During much of the 1980s and '90s, I collected as many episodes as I could on videotape.  So I was quite excited when the dvd sets of Checkmate, the best of seasons 1 and 2 were released.  However, as I said in my review of the season one set, the episodes on that set were far from the best of Checkmate.  That has now been remedied with the upcoming release of Checkmate-The Complete Series.  There were so many great episodes from season one that will now be released: the great pilot ""Death Runs Wild"" with Anne Baxter, ""The Human Touch"" with Peter Lorre and ""The Murder Game,"" a greatly atmospheric episode featuring an old house, a stormy night and murder. (I love those type of plots.)  As I stated previously, for some reason, the scripts for Checkmate's first season were far superior to Checkmate's second season.  I noticed it when I originally watched and I can still easily tell a first season show from a second.While Checkmate got good ratings its first season, CBS still wanted to cancel it.  However the show was produced by Jack Benny's production company and Benny used his clout with CBS to renew it for a second season.  (Benny even guest starred on an episode of Checkmate.  How many other dramatic series did you ever see Jack Benny guest on?  I can't think of any.)  However CBS changed its timeslot the second season and wound up cancelling it after that season.  I guess not even the great Jack Benny could get them to renew it for a third.However, as I previously stated in my review of season one, Checkmate had some of the greatest guest stars I can ever remember appearing on a dramatic series.  On top of the ones I just mentioned, there was Charles Laughton, Lee Marvin, Joseph Cotton, Joan Fontaine, Dana Andrews, David Janssen, Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Montgomery, Jack Lord, Patricia Neal, James Coburn, Nick Adams, Claire Bloom, Dorothy Malone, Dick Shawn, etc. etc.I look forward to purchasing the entire series.

Two points of interest on the show is on one episode early on in the series,an actress named Barbara Luna appears.She was once married to Doug McClure and the building used as police HQ was also used in another San Francisco based series.It was the office of Ironside, which starred Raymond Burr, seven years later.I think the actual building was raised to the ground in 1966 or ' 67.There were only two seasons made of this series and they are all here.Enjoy.",5,TV show that checks all the boxes,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,1470,"['Checkmate', 'crime', 'show', 'difference.It', 'preventing', 'crime', 'happens.Two', 'private', 'investigators', 'one', 'professor', 'criminology', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'show', 'who', 'task', 'prevent', 'crime', 'happening.It', 'stars', 'Anthony', 'George', 'who', 'must', 'admit', 'not', 'hearing', 'before', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'private', 'investigators', 'Sabastian', 'Cabot', 'Professor.He', 'big', 'uncle', 'other', 'two.Anthony', 'George', 'more', 'business-like', 'investigator', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'happy-go-lucky', 'sidekick.Similar', 'performance', 'Trampas', 'Virginian', 'great', 'crime', 'drama', 'intriguing', 'plot-lines.The', 'guest', 'list', 'reads', 'who', 'who', 'TV', 'movies.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before.It', 'set', 'San', 'Francisco', 'location', 'shooting', 'great', 'city.The', 'only', 'minus', 'point', 'here', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'catch', 'splendour', 'locale.It', 'great', 'theme', 'score', 'John', 'Willliams', 'Two', 'points', 'interest', 'show', 'one', 'episode', 'early', 'series', 'actress', 'named', 'Barbara', 'Luna', 'appears.She', 'was', 'once', 'married', 'Doug', 'McClure', 'building', 'used', 'police', 'HQ', 'was', 'also', 'used', 'San', 'Francisco', 'based', 'series.It', 'was', 'office', 'Ironside', 'starred', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'seven', 'years', 'later.I', 'think', 'actual', 'building', 'was', 'raised', 'ground', '1966', '67.There', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'made', 'series', 'are', 'here.Enjoy']",Checkmate - The Complete Series Set!

1347962,A13GBOIS77Z59A,B003K1NGXE,"R. Smith ""smithscf""","[28, 29]","I'll try to add what other reviewers have not mentioned:* QUALITY OF TRANFERS: Images are soft and appear as dubbed VHS video cassette images although they are probably secondary (video) copies of older film transfers.  Nevertheless, the episodes are highly watchable and appear as 40-50s type of material.  Persons over 40 years old will probably be satisfied since they grew up in this era.  There does not appear to be ANY type of remastering and this is clear in the first episode that shows splotches, scratches, and other old film type of defects.  Sound is acceptable mono.  No subtitles (English, etc.)* DISKS AND PACKAGING: Excellent.  Disks are single-sided, labeled, and in polypropylene (soft plastic) cases packaged 2 per case.  There is a strong odor of printer's ink on the disk that may go away with time.  I hope that the Studio will use more environmentally friendly inks in the future... they should demand it from their source of manufacturers.* SHOW IN GENERAL: 5-star show--suitable for all ages that like to see crime drama that is not gory as in ""classic television""-- BLACK & WHITE television.  Photography tends to be on the dark side, but plots and acting are excellent and believable with even some humor interlaced with the action and suspense.  The audience is generally given the viewpoint of the 3 detectives, but also knows many of the overall crime elements.* PRICE: I had never seen this series and bought it on the basis of the reviews and price.  For $32.99 (USD) or roughly 59% off the list price, the show represents good value, although similar sets (Wanted Dead or Alive) with similar production (minimal) are in the $13-$20 USD range.  The price may go lower than this and if so, it is series worth having unless remastered versions become available.* CONCLUSION: a little more effort could have been made by Timeless Media Group Studio to make a better compilation.
