It provides a fresh look at the superheroes from serious teen perspectives, unlike previous attempts like Teen Titans and other 90s young heroes short takes.  The drama is quite suspenseful and the storyline arcs across many episodes, much like the Justice League, but with much less death and impossible violence.  Sure, the teen heroes are capable of taking down whole buildings, but not the entire city blocks like those final epic battle between Superman and Darkseid in Justice League.

1649809,A205BECZCE6DAU,B00CPEK3NI,"Dennis M. Roy ""animation addict""","[0, 0]","I love the show. The Young Justice episodes themselves average a 5-star rating. See my review ofYoung Justice: Invasion Destiny Calling - Season Two, Part 1for an overview of the Second Season YJ episodes. So why only 4 stars? Basically, WB blew it big time when choosing their ""bonus episodes"". The Season One Part 1 DVDs selected 3 episodes of BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD, each of which gives us some good background on the character of Jaime Reyes, the Blue Beetle. Those were excellent choices to help spotlight that particular character, who plays a big part in the Second Season of Young Justice.The YJ S2 Part 2 collection would seem to attempt to spotlight Virgil Hawkins, aka Static Shock in the same fashion, with 3 bonus episodes. However, here's where it's an epic fail. All of the Batman The Brave And The Bold episodes guest-starring Blue Beetle had been previously released on DVD, but many of the purchasers of this series on DVD may not have bought that show, due to its overall difference in approach to YJ. That's OK; they cherry picked just the ones that were relevant to Blue Beetle. If you didn't own BTBATB on DVD, the Season 2 Part 1 collection gave you just the BB-related episodes. Maybe you might decide you like BTBATB after watching them, and you can go out and purchase those shows on DVD.With STATIC SHOCK being used for the bonus cartoons on the Season 2 part 2 collection, that complete series (4 seasons/52 episodes) has never been released by WB in its entirety on DVD. They did release a single-disc DVD that has the first 6 episodes from the first season. The first 2 of those same 6 episodes have again been chosen to be included on this collection as bonus episodes. The first deals with Static's origin, so perhaps that needed to be included for those not familar with Static's own series. A third bonus cartoon is Episode 12 (""Replay""), which has been seemingly chosen at random, since it has no particular significance relative to the DC Universe.However, and here's where it's frustrating, there were 7 episodes of the STATIC SHOCK series that had guest appearances by other characters from the DC Universe:""The Big Leagues"" - Dakota gets a real jolt when the Joker hits town, recruiting a band of Meta-Humans to wreak his own special brand of havoc. Batman and Robin appear, pursuing the Joker. Static must put his hero worship in check as he teams up with the Dynamic Duo to put a shock to Joker's system.""Hard as Nails"" - Static travels to Gotham City to rescue Nails, a school girl friend of his who has fallen in with Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, who are promising to cure her of her Bang Baby affliction.""A League of Their Own"", Parts 1 and 2 - When the Watchtower has a sudden power drain, the Justice League are forced to recruit Static to ""jump-start"" their station before it re-enters the atmosphere. Unbeknownst to either Static or Gear, the power drain also releases Brainiac from confinement.""Toys in the Hood"" - Static teams up with Superman when the Man of Steel's old nemesis, Toyman, appears in Dakota.""Future Shock"" - After helping Batman with a case, Static finds himself accidentally sent 40 years into the future, where he has to help the Batman of that era, Terry McGinnis, save a captured superhero: Static's future self. (Static Shock later appears in the JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED series as a adult member of Batman Beyond's Justice League, in sort of a sequel to this episode.)""Fallen Hero"" - Static faces off against his idol, Green Lantern (John Stewart) when he causes chaos all over town. This is an instance of a voice actor ""talking to himself"", as Phil LaMarr voices both Static and Green Lantern.NONE of those episodes listed above has EVER been released on DVD, so what does WB give us as their choices for bonus cartoons? - 2 episodes that were already included in the 6 out of 52 episodes of the show that HAVE been released, and one other random episode. If they absolutely had to limit themselves to only 3 bonus episodes, I would have picked ""A League of Their Own"", Parts 1 and 2 and ""Future Shock"". They could have just included a commercial forStatic Shock: The New Kidto refer people to the first 6 episodes if they had further interest in watching the show. They should at least put out a DVD collecting all the STATIC SHOCK episodes with DC guest stars as a standalone single-disc DVD collection.

1649815,A1JAPCM4CA50GO,B00CPEK3NI,Fantasy Fan,"[0, 0]","I decided to review Young Justice as a whole rather than each volume separately. My only real complaint about this series was a lack of connection to the DCAU. Much as I tried, there were too many inconsistencies (spoiler alert: Wally West dies at the end of season 2) to even pretend there might be some continuity with the previous series'. I suppose if I had a second complaint, it would be the way Wonder Woman was drawn (watch Young Justice & Justice League side by side & you will see what I mean).Now on to the good comments. The story arcs for each season are compelling and intricate. The characters (of which there are many) are deep. And there isn't really one character that makes you say ""I wonder why they included them?"" Everyone has a purpose. Each season is full of so many twists and turns, it makes you want to go back and watch it again to make sure you didn't miss anything important.I was extremely disappointed when I found out the show was being cancelled. With the introduction of Darksied, it felt like we were being teased with a cliffhanger to be continued, but no. I was even more disappointed when I saw what was replacing it. For two years, I had something to look forward to every Saturday morning. Now, I sit quietly eating my cereal, sipping my coffee and hoping Cartoon Network will come to their senses & realize cartoons can be more than fodder for toddlers who have short attention spans and only watch for the bright colors and silly sound effects.As for the packaging, I can't fathom why they felt the need to split season 1 into 4 separate packages other than to get fans to spend more money. Four episodes per disc to me seems like a waste of plastic. The cover art on each case is unremarkable. As for special features, there are none.

1649830,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B00CPEK3NI,NF,"[1, 2]","The Young Justice is what the Teen Titans television series should have been. Even though it's about some of the same heroes, the difference between these two series is night and day. The Teen Titans is clearly aimed at children, whereas this can be enjoyed by anyone who's a fan of comic books and super heroes, adult and child alike. This DVD contains ten episodes on two DVDs which, quite frankly, is something of a ripoff. I recommend waiting for Warner Brothers to release the full season on DVD, which will end up costing you one-half or even one-third of the price of purchasing the season in separate parts, as well as giving you the entire season in one collection.Some noteworthy longer story arcs in these episodes:1. Miss Martian is deathly afraid of using her psychic powers because of the way she abused them in Season 2, Part 1. This has ramifications in some early episodes and comes to a head halfway through the season.2. The Reach and the Light both have their own plans, some of which develop slowly over the full ten episodes. As you might expect, neither side is fully truthful and there are some surprises in store, particularly in the final episode.3. The Blue Beetle also develops in some interesting ways throughout these episodes and not always in ways that our heroes would prefer.4. As was the case in Part 1 of Season 2, not everything is what it seems, as there are spies, counter-spies, and betrayals galore, along with some unlikely allies (under the theory that &#34;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&#34;).5. This is one of those &#34;darkest before the dawn&#34; series, with setback after setback inflicting our young heroes, to the point where I was wondering if the writers were ever going to let them win one! Personally, I think the season could have used more balance.On Disc 1:Cornered - The old Justice League foe, Despero, is re-imagined as a super-strong Galactic hunter, eager for personal combat, for a challenge, for trophies to mount on his wall. He surrounds the Hall of Justice with an impenetrable force field, then attacks the heroes within, mostly members of the Young Justice team, aided by Captain Marvel. Despero has a moderately annoying robotic aide, Elron, pretty clearly modeled on Booster Gold's Skeets. This was mostly a filler episode and it showed.True Colors - The Reach partner with Lexcorp to increase food production. The Young Justice team is sure that something is going on beneath the surface so they go undercover to find out more. This episode introduces a new Beetle warrior, a Green Beetle from Mars. Is he an ally? A foe? Only time will tell. A subplot shows an angry Sportsmaster demanding &#34;an eye for an eye&#34; in return for the death of his daughter, Artemis. The other members of the Light refuse to let him take out Aqualad in revenge and they have in mind a replacement for the disgruntled Sportsmaster...The Fix - The team has asked Miss Martian to psychically read the Green Beetle, to confirm whether he is on the up-and-up. Can Miss Martian bring herself to use her psychic powers again? She may have no choice, since Black Manta has decided that there is only one person who can heal his son and he's determined to bring her in, sending Tigress (a disguised Artemis) and Deathstroke to capture her. Can M'gann repair the damage she caused, repairing a shattered mind? In the meantime, the Green Beetle has agreed to help the Blue Beetle bring his scarab under control.Runaways - In Part 1, we were introduced to some young people who were captured and experimented on by the Light and the Reach. In this episode, we're reintroduced to them as they are being investigated by the scientists of Star Labs in order to determine the effects of the Reach's manipulations. The kids are not particularly happy with their status and so they break out. In a sub-plot, some of the Amazo body parts were sent to Star Labs for safekeeping, since the Hall of Justice was destroyed in an earlier episode. One of Red Tornado's brothers, the Red Volcano, has decided he wants those parts. The kids, along with the Blue Beetle, decide to engage but is there something wrong with the Beetle? And what will happen to the kids when all is said and done?War - In this episode, we find out just a bit more about the past history of the Reach and we find that they are not the only would-be conquerors in the galaxy. A somewhat reimagined Mongul decides that what is happening on Earth is a threat to his own plans for galactic domination, so he takes his War World, a mobile doomsday vessel slightly smaller than Earth's moon, developed millenia ago by an extinct alien race and now under Mongul's control, to Earth. If he can't dislodge the Reach from Earth, he'll destroy the planet. Can the Reach, the Justice League, and the Young Justice team cooperate to save the planet? And what secrets will be revealed in the process?There really were some stunning graphics in this episode and the key to the ultimate success was interesting. Plus, there is one final surprise...On Disc 2:Complications - Something has happened to the Young Justice team on the War World. But what? Can Nightwing put the pieces together and figure it out? And Manta gives Miss Martian an ultimatum: fix Aqualad in 24 hours or die. Two other people have a different idea, though, as Sportsmaster and Cheshire infiltrate Manta's sub to avenge the supposed death of Artemis.The Hunt - We find out what happened to the Young Justice team, including one member who is still at large and fighting against the forces of the Reach; Arsenal. But can he singlehandedly free his comrades and take on the Black Beetle? He needs help and he gets it, from two unlikely sources, including the one individual who has the power to go toe-to-toe with the Black Beetle. We also start to see the plans of the Light developing, as it becomes clear that they have some ideas of their own.Intervention - Can the Young Justice team solve the problem of Blue Beetle, once and for all? An intervention is in order. But an intervention in the heart of enemy territory? And which will be more effective: the science of the Reach or the magic of Earth? And is all what it seems or is the team dancing to someone else's tune?Summit - The Reach and the Light have much to talk about, as both of them have grievances against the other. A summit is held, staged in a cavern deep under the earth. The summit does not go well, erupting in conflict, but cooler heads prevail. Unfortunately, in the process, Artemis, still under cover with Black Manta, is revealed which, in turn discloses Aqualad as a double agent. Fortunately, the Young Justice team has a few surprises up their sleeves. Unfortunately, so does the Light.Endgame - The Reach have been driven off the planet but they have one final ace to play, an ace that threatens to destroy the planet. Can Lex Luthor, the Justice League, and the Young Justice team unite to defeat that threat? And who will pay the ultimate price in the process?Peeves:- Impulse's use of the word &#34;crash&#34; just gets annoying. I felt like saying, a la &#34;Mean Girls,&#34; &#34;Stop trying to make 'crash' happen!&#34;- The character of G. Gordon Godfrey, annoying talk-show host, really didn't work for me. I assume that the character is intended to be a cross between Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh but, as voiced by Tim Curry, all it did was irritate me. I was expecting that there would be some payoff for this, some comeuppance as had happened in a prior Justice League episode, but it never happened.- Use of &#34;the Light&#34; again as the primary villain. It was good in the first season, since it was kept hidden for much of the season and since the mystery built to good effect throughout the season, but now that we know the truth in the second season, this basically became just another attack by the Injustice Society. I can't help wishing they had gone in a different direction.- The cliffhanger postscript ending, frankly, didn't make much sense. I can't say more without giving away too much, but the alliance suggested in that postscript just didn't work for me.Despite the peeves, there is a lot to like in this series, which is why I'm giving it four stars. There are decent individual storylines and story arcs throughout the season, very good animation for a television series, and, of course, a lot of action. It's still a worthwhile addition to the Warner Brothers DC Universe canon and I can recommend it (although I still recommend waiting for the full season to be released).",4,Not quite up to Season 1;

1649831,A2CGEI95LY2R4G,B00CPEK3NI,Nicole,"[0, 0]","My collection of Young Justice is finally complete from Season 1 to 2.This continues Season Two of Young Justice. The disks are two. The first one is dark blue and the second one is red. Both consist of five episodes each. Compared to the previous disks of Young Justice, the menu is different and simple. The main menu is the cover of the DVD disk. The rest of the screens once you go through them are just red. There are subtitles, and audio changes. There are three special episodes available and they are from Static Shock. It makes sense to add these episodes since Static Shock is a character introduced to the Young Justice world. His biography of his powers have changed. There wasn't enough time to really see Static Shock in Young Justice. From the episodes seen, Virgil is characterized as someone in my opinion: loyal, brave, and a teen who is okay with his powers and idolizes the heros at some moments. Besides Virgil, I really enjoyed seeing new characters such as Asami, Tye, and Ed. Then I saw the original Roy Harper become Arsenal. Everything came together. I saw a lot of characters in the spotlight and I wanted to see more moments from certain characters. I saw Zatanna and Rocket be totally awesome. I saw relationships develop. There was sisterly love between Jade and Artemis. There was a problem with Mal and Karen that started from the begining to the end. It showed the issue of growth. I didn't really understand Wonder Girl and Robin because it was so sudden. It was like whoa. Compared to the first season where all the relationships developed had a few hints here and there. That one was surprising. I really wanted to see Jaime reunite with Tye as himself.The season wrapped up pretty nicely done since there were only ten episodes. We learn more about Blue Beetle, the scarabs, the Reach, the War world and the characterization with a lot of characters. We see it all wrap up and show the madness to going undercover and solving the Blue Beetle. I really didn't expect the last episode since it closed the door and opened up a few more doors. I've seen a possible season three plot occur if the show does pick up again.It has been said that there is a possible resurrection of Young Justice if more products are bought concerning Young Justice such as the upcoming video game. No season three was ordered due to the lack of sales from action figures. Yes, action figures. It takes more to run the show with all the money it takes. if you have questions, you can look it up and see all the possible reasons why there is no season three.I bought the series since I buying it to view just online or on Itunes is more expensive and useless since I prefer using my DVD player or computer to view it. Overall i enjoyed the series and I would recommend anyone who just wants to watch it. If you prefer it itunes or amazon then go for it.Disk One: Cornered, True Colors, The Fix, Runaways, WarDisk Two: Complications, The Hunt, Intervention, Summit, EndgameStatic Shock Episodes: Shock to the System, Aftershock, Replay",5,Young Justice Game of Illusions: Season 2-Part 2,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,3045,"['collection', 'Young', 'Justice', 'finally', 'complete', 'Season', '1', '2.This', 'Season', 'Two', 'Young', 'Justice', 'disks', 'are', 'two', 'first', 'one', 'dark', 'blue', 'second', 'one', 'red', 'consist', 'five', 'episodes', 'Compared', 'previous', 'disks', 'Young', 'Justice', 'menu', 'different', 'simple', 'main', 'menu', 'cover', 'DVD', 'disk', 'rest', 'screens', 'once', 'go', 'are', 'just', 'red', 'are', 'subtitles', 'audio', 'changes', 'are', 'three', 'special', 'episodes', 'available', 'are', 'Static', 'Shock', 'sense', 'add', 'episodes', 'Static', 'Shock', 'character', 'introduced', 'Young', 'Justice', 'world', 'biography', 'powers', 'have', 'changed', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'really', 'see', 'Static', 'Shock', 'Young', 'Justice', 'episodes', 'seen', 'Virgil', 'characterized', 'someone', 'opinion', 'loyal', 'brave', 'teen', 'who', 'okay', 'powers', 'heros', 'moments', 'Virgil', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'new', 'characters', 'such', 'Asami', 'Tye', 'Ed', 'Then', 'saw', 'original', 'Roy', 'Harper', 'become', 'Arsenal', 'Everything', 'came', 'together', 'saw', 'lot', 'characters', 'spotlight', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'moments', 'certain', 'characters', 'saw', 'Zatanna', 'Rocket', 'be', 'totally', 'awesome', 'saw', 'relationships', 'develop', 'was', 'sisterly', 'love', 'Jade', 'Artemis', 'was', 'problem', 'Mal', 'Karen', 'started', 'begining', 'end', 'showed', 'issue', 'growth', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'Wonder', 'Girl', 'Robin', 'was', 'so', 'sudden', 'was', 'whoa', 'Compared', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'relationships', 'developed', 'had', 'few', 'hints', 'here', 'there', 'one', 'was', 'surprising', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'Jaime', 'reunite', 'Tye', 'himself.The', 'season', 'wrapped', 'up', 'pretty', 'nicely', 'done', 'were', 'only', 'ten', 'episodes', 'learn', 'more', 'Blue', 'Beetle', 'scarabs', 'Reach', 'War', 'world', 'characterization', 'lot', 'characters', 'see', 'wrap', 'up', 'show', 'madness', 'going', 'undercover', 'solving', 'Blue', 'Beetle', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'last', 'episode', 'closed', 'door', 'opened', 'up', 'few', 'more', 'doors', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'possible', 'season', 'three', 'plot', 'show', 'pick', 'up', 'again.It', 'been', 'said', 'possible', 'resurrection', 'Young', 'Justice', 'more', 'products', 'are', 'bought', 'concerning', 'Young', 'Justice', 'such', 'upcoming', 'video', 'game', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'ordered', 'due', 'lack', 'sales', 'action', 'figures', 'Yes', 'action', 'figures', 'more', 'run', 'show', 'money', 'have', 'questions', 'can', 'look', 'up', 'see', 'possible', 'reasons', 'why', 'season', 'three.I', 'bought', 'series', 'buying', 'view', 'just', 'online', 'Itunes', 'more', 'expensive', 'useless', 'prefer', 'using', 'DVD', 'player', 'computer', 'view', 'Overall', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'watch', 'prefer', 'amazon', 'then', 'go', 'it.Disk', 'One', 'Cornered', 'True', 'Colors', 'Fix', 'Runaways', 'WarDisk', 'Two', 'Complications', 'Hunt', 'Intervention', 'Summit', 'EndgameStatic', 'Shock', 'Episodes', 'Shock', 'System', 'Aftershock', 'Replay']",Young Justice Invasion: Season 2 Part 2 - Game of Illusions
