133013,AYGHUCNGQ0HMF,0792299922,aaron wittenberg,"[63, 63]","I'm sure most people know that this is strictly a documentary on the discovery Dr. Robert Ballard did on the Titanic. I haven't watched my copy in over a year, but from what I do remember, it was very, very good. They start out before they actually find the Titanic with some of the explorations they did during the summer of 1985. Then on September 1, 1985, they discovered it. It's not the typical finding of the bow and such, they scan the ocean floor and pieces of the wreckage start showing up.There is much detail about the discovery, a lot of background about their equipment, how they went looking for it, TONS of footage, and so much more. If you liked the movie and want to see what the Titanic looked like in 1985, 73 years after it fell into darkness, this is it.Kids probably wouldn't like this too much as its not really a fun movie, but it is very educational and very interesting. If you were a big fan of the Titanic, you should get this.It is actually interesting to see them building the robots and testing them before going into the ocean. The video is jam packed with background, pictures (color/B&amp;W), footage, and a lot of historical information.One of the final scenes shows a someones shoe (crew member?) where it had sat for 73 years until the 1985 discovery. There are no bodies in this (do you really think a body would last 3/4 of a century at the bottom of the ocean? nada), but they show you PLENTY of the remains from the Titanic. I believe they also show some of the Titanic survivors and the gravesites.Excellent educational film. I took my copy to work after I first got it over a year ago and almost everybody in the office was watching it. It definitely holds your attention.",5,Excellent documentary on the 1985 discovery,980640000,"01 28, 2001",2001,1715,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'strictly', 'documentary', 'discovery', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Ballard', 'did', 'Titanic', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'copy', 'year', 'what', 'do', 'remember', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'start', 'out', 'actually', 'find', 'Titanic', 'explorations', 'did', 'summer', '1985', 'Then', 'September', '1', '1985', 'discovered', 'not', 'typical', 'finding', 'bow', 'such', 'scan', 'ocean', 'floor', 'pieces', 'wreckage', 'start', 'showing', 'up.There', 'much', 'detail', 'discovery', 'lot', 'background', 'equipment', 'how', 'went', 'looking', 'TONS', 'footage', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'liked', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'Titanic', 'looked', '1985', '73', 'years', 'fell', 'darkness', 'it.Kids', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'really', 'fun', 'movie', 'very', 'educational', 'very', 'interesting', 'were', 'big', 'fan', 'Titanic', 'should', 'get', 'this.It', 'actually', 'interesting', 'see', 'building', 'robots', 'testing', 'going', 'ocean', 'video', 'jam', 'packed', 'background', 'pictures', 'color/B', 'amp', 'W', 'footage', 'lot', 'historical', 'information.One', 'final', 'scenes', 'someones', 'shoe', 'crew', 'member', 'where', 'had', 'sat', '73', 'years', '1985', 'discovery', 'are', 'bodies', 'do', 'really', 'think', 'body', 'would', 'last', '3/4', 'century', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'nada', 'show', 'PLENTY', 'remains', 'Titanic', 'believe', 'also', 'show', 'Titanic', 'survivors', 'gravesites.Excellent', 'educational', 'film', 'took', 'copy', 'work', 'first', 'got', 'over', 'year', 'ago', 'almost', 'everybody', 'office', 'was', 'watching', 'definitely', 'attention']",N/A

A valid concern, but not what I was hoping for. I did learn that the iceberg's cut was estimated to be only .75 inch wide, but 300 feet long. The rationale for restricting the number of lifeboats was that the White Star Line wanted as much of an open deck as possible. First-class passage cost about $50,000 in today's money, per Ballard.

Why?  Until September 1, 1985, people who were interested in the disaster had no solid forensic evidence upon which to base their ideas or theories - only survivor recollections (highly inconsistent) and the flawed official transcripts left by the American/British Inquiries (each with its own particular agenda).  The discovery of the wreck marked the beginning of a complete reappraisal of that information based upon what the French/American team found on the bottom and its physical implications.  That reappraisal, still ongoing, is touched on in this DVD's narration, but at that point it was just getting under way.  Some follow-up coverage is provided by a later, added section that wasn't part of the original home video release.Nevertheless, this documentary will always retain great interest for the Titanic community in that it contains some of the earliest video taken of the wreck; and underwater video at that depth was itself an emerging ""artform.""

However, the ship hit the berg at 11:40 PM and many people would rather say one date than April 14-15).This story is the ultimate tragedy and could have been avoided. Since the sinking, historians have been asking various what ifs: What if the ship had enough lifeboats? What if Captain Smith and the wireless operators had obeyed iceberg warnings? What if the ship had not tried to steer away from the ice (Ramming the berg head on would have only folded one or two compartments)? And what if other ships had gotten there in time to rescue passengers (The Californian was only about ten or twenty miles away)? The sinking of the Titanic also brought an end to what Mark Twain called ""The Gilded Age"". Before the Titanic's voyage, the focus was on larger, faster and higher. Man believed that it could do anything, including conquering the sea with an unsinkable ship. This disaster, however, was a reality check. People were never again as confident in technology and began focusing more on safety than speed, size and luxury.This video documentary was made in 1986, a year after Dr. Robert Ballard and his Woods Hole Institute found the ship, and follows their subsequent expedition of the wreck. The footage is not as spectacular as say the IMAX-quality footage found in ""Titanica"" or on some Discovery and History Channel specials, but this was back when the wreck was first being explored. The major goal was to examine and map out the site. Then, after the footage and results were examined, they would come back to get some pretty pictures. This also shows how far we have advanced in the field of underwater research. And that shot of the ship's bow coming out of the darkness still gets me every time.Ballard hopes at the end of the video that the world would treat the site with respect. Sadly, the events that have occurred since the discovery of this wreck have been far different. Instead of respecting the wreck and increasing our knowledge of the tragedy and of the people aboard, savalgers have scavenged it. Thousands of items have been raised and placed on exhibit at museums. The people who do this claim that it is to protect these items from decaying, but this is unnecessary. It is very much like going to a graveyard, prying open the coffins and stealing the clothing and other possessions of the dead. We already know about the time period and about life back then. Raising artifacts won't help archeologically and they won't add to the context. If anything, every artifact recovered takes away from the context.I am also glad that many more people are now aware of the Titanic's story and the tragedy. But when did many learn this? After seeing the 1997 movie, of course. While I admit that James Cameron's film is very accurate to the history and events of that night (At least according to historians) and is very entertaining at the same time, whenever someone watches a special like this documentary now, they relate it to the movie. They say things such as ""Oh that's where Jack and Rose were when they met"" or ""That's where this person got killed"" or where ""That person met that person"". I also dislike those people who claim to know everything about the Titanic because they saw the movie five times. I saw this documentary many times long before I saw the feature length film. And I will tell you that nothing beats the factual history. In here, you get the straight facts, not mixed in with a romance.My opinions, however, should stick to the documentary. This documentary, though its hopes for the wreck site have been somewhat dated by time, is still incredible and is one of National Geographic's top specials on shipwrecks and oceanography.",5,Did you expect less from National Geographic?,1018742400,"04 14, 2002",2002,3892,"['start', 'review', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'today', 'ninetieth', 'anniversary', 'Titanic', 'disaster', 'sank', 'morning', 'April', '15th', 'real', 'anniversary', 'sinking', 'tomorrow', 'However', 'ship', 'hit', 'berg', '11:40', 'PM', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'rather', 'say', 'one', 'date', 'April', '14-15', '.This', 'story', 'ultimate', 'tragedy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'sinking', 'historians', 'have', 'been', 'asking', 'various', 'what', 'ifs', 'What', 'ship', 'had', 'enough', 'lifeboats', 'What', 'Captain', 'Smith', 'wireless', 'operators', 'had', 'obeyed', 'iceberg', 'warnings', 'What', 'ship', 'had', 'not', 'tried', 'steer', 'away', 'ice', 'Ramming', 'berg', 'head', 'would', 'have', 'only', 'folded', 'one', 'two', 'compartments', 'what', 'other', 'ships', 'had', 'gotten', 'there', 'time', 'rescue', 'passengers', 'Californian', 'was', 'only', 'about', 'ten', 'twenty', 'miles', 'away', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'also', 'brought', 'end', 'what', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'called', 'Gilded', 'Age', 'Titanic', 'voyage', 'focus', 'was', 'larger', 'faster', 'higher', 'Man', 'believed', 'could', 'do', 'anything', 'including', 'conquering', 'sea', 'unsinkable', 'ship', 'disaster', 'however', 'was', 'reality', 'check', 'People', 'were', 'never', 'again', 'confident', 'technology', 'began', 'focusing', 'more', 'safety', 'speed', 'size', 'luxury.This', 'video', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', '1986', 'year', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Ballard', 'Woods', 'Hole', 'Institute', 'found', 'ship', 'subsequent', 'expedition', 'wreck', 'footage', 'not', 'as', 'spectacular', 'say', 'IMAX-quality', 'footage', 'found', 'Titanica', 'Discovery', 'History', 'Channel', 'specials', 'was', 'back', 'when', 'wreck', 'was', 'first', 'being', 'explored', 'major', 'goal', 'was', 'examine', 'map', 'out', 'site', 'Then', 'footage', 'results', 'were', 'examined', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'get', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'also', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'advanced', 'field', 'underwater', 'research', 'shot', 'ship', 'bow', 'coming', 'darkness', 'still', 'time.Ballard', 'end', 'video', 'world', 'would', 'treat', 'site', 'respect', 'Sadly', 'events', 'have', 'occurred', 'discovery', 'wreck', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'different', 'Instead', 'respecting', 'wreck', 'increasing', 'knowledge', 'tragedy', 'people', 'savalgers', 'have', 'scavenged', 'Thousands', 'items', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'placed', 'exhibit', 'museums', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'claim', 'protect', 'items', 'decaying', 'unnecessary', 'very', 'much', 'going', 'graveyard', 'prying', 'open', 'coffins', 'stealing', 'clothing', 'other', 'possessions', 'dead', 'already', 'know', 'time', 'period', 'life', 'back', 'then', 'Raising', 'artifacts', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'archeologically', 'wo', ""n't"", 'add', 'context', 'anything', 'artifact', 'recovered', 'away', 'context.I', 'am', 'also', 'glad', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'now', 'aware', 'Titanic', 'story', 'tragedy', 'when', 'did', 'many', 'learn', 'seeing', '1997', 'movie', 'course', 'admit', 'James', 'Cameron', 'film', 'very', 'accurate', 'history', 'events', 'night', 'least', 'according', 'historians', 'very', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time', 'whenever', 'someone', 'special', 'documentary', 'now', 'relate', 'movie', 'say', 'things', 'such', 'Oh', 'where', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'were', 'when', 'met', 'where', 'person', 'got', 'killed', 'where', 'person', 'met', 'person', 'also', 'dislike', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'know', 'everything', 'Titanic', 'saw', 'movie', 'five', 'times', 'saw', 'documentary', 'many', 'times', 'long', 'saw', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'will', 'tell', 'nothing', 'factual', 'history', 'here', 'get', 'straight', 'facts', 'not', 'mixed', 'romance.My', 'opinions', 'however', 'should', 'stick', 'documentary', 'documentary', 'hopes', 'wreck', 'site', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'time', 'still', 'incredible', 'one', 'National', 'Geographic', 'top', 'specials', 'shipwrecks', 'oceanography']",N/A
