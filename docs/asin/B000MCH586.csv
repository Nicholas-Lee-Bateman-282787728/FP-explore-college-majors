1044424,A2JE3ED40C5Q68,B000MCH586,fluffysquirrel,"[10, 13]","I've been doing this Quick Fit System for about 6 years now and I love it; it really does work as long as it's followed properly. That said, after having done this for said number of years, you get to notice stuff while working out and some things are quite distracting. I am referring to Brenda Dykgraff's hair in a couple of the toning tapes. Her hair resembles a huge bird's nest on the top of her head, and add to that, her over-dramatization of the moves. In the Chest and Back video, it is clear that she has eyes for Gil.  What lady wouldn't? The man is eye candy.  Other than Brenda's kissyuppy ways and goofy hair, this series is perfect, right on the money.  People have complimented my arms and I've noticed that my jeans look better on, everything basically fits better. The first time I attempted the Hips, Thighs and Buns tape, I was in such pain that I wanted to toss a pineapple at Gilad's head. But, no pain, no gain. I'm referring to the exercise, not the pineapple over the head;-) So, if anyone out there is wanting to try something new in the world of exercise and diet, this is a must. Gilad includes a booklet of his Eat Right Now plan which gives you a list of good foods, okay foods and foods to avoid. Get this; you will find it is so worth it.",5,Gilad is terriffic!,1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,1270,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Quick', 'Fit', 'System', 'about', '6', 'years', 'now', 'love', 'really', 'work', 'as', 'long', 'followed', 'properly', 'said', 'having', 'done', 'said', 'number', 'years', 'get', 'notice', 'stuff', 'working', 'out', 'things', 'are', 'quite', 'distracting', 'am', 'referring', 'Brenda', 'Dykgraff', 'hair', 'couple', 'toning', 'tapes', 'hair', 'huge', 'bird', 'nest', 'top', 'head', 'add', 'over-dramatization', 'moves', 'Chest', 'Back', 'video', 'clear', 'eyes', 'Gil', 'What', 'lady', 'would', ""n't"", 'man', 'eye', 'candy', 'Other', 'Brenda', 'kissyuppy', 'ways', 'goofy', 'hair', 'series', 'perfect', 'right', 'money', 'People', 'have', 'complimented', 'arms', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'jeans', 'look', 'better', 'everything', 'basically', 'better', 'first', 'time', 'attempted', 'Hips', 'Thighs', 'Buns', 'tape', 'was', 'such', 'pain', 'wanted', 'toss', 'pineapple', 'Gilad', 'head', 'pain', 'gain', ""'m"", 'referring', 'exercise', 'not', 'pineapple', 'head', 'So', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'world', 'exercise', 'diet', 'must', 'Gilad', 'booklet', 'Eat', 'Right', 'Now', 'plan', 'list', 'good', 'foods', 'okay', 'foods', 'foods', 'avoid', 'Get', 'will', 'find', 'so', 'worth']",Gilad: Quick Fit System Fat Burning Body Sculpting Cardio Workout Set

I had seen one of his shows on tv recently early in the morning and remembered how much I loved to do his workouts he had back in the 90's.  I ordered this set in hopes it was something like what I remembered.  It was not.  It started out the same and then during the aerobic segment, the cardio, it would start going into the punching and kicking.  I wasn't interested in that part of the aerobics.  I was disappointed to find out that all the dvd's for the cardio all ended up doing the same punching and kickboxing moves.  The only dvd I use of this series is the dvd that has the different toning segments; hips,butt,thighs,arms.I now record his shows on the fit channel and do those aerobic segments.",3,not what i expected,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,771,"['had', 'been', 'huge', 'Gilad', 'fan', 'back', 'early', '90', '90', 'had', 'seen', 'one', 'shows', 'tv', 'recently', 'early', 'morning', 'remembered', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'do', 'workouts', 'had', 'back', '90', 'ordered', 'set', 'hopes', 'was', 'something', 'what', 'remembered', 'was', 'not', 'started', 'out', 'same', 'then', 'aerobic', 'segment', 'cardio', 'would', 'start', 'going', 'punching', 'kicking', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'part', 'aerobics', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'out', 'dvd', 'cardio', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'same', 'punching', 'kickboxing', 'moves', 'only', 'dvd', 'use', 'series', 'dvd', 'different', 'toning', 'segments', 'hips', 'butt', 'thighs', 'arms.I', 'now', 'record', 'shows', 'fit', 'channel', 'do', 'aerobic', 'segments']",Gilad: Quick Fit System Fat Burning Body Sculpting Cardio Workout Set

1044427,A1XF4WHTMLRNQA,B000MCH586,Steve,"[17, 18]","If you're looking to get your picture on the cover of a muscle & fitness magazine, this is *not* the product for you.  However if you're like me and wanted a methodical system of losing extra pounds and putting some tone back into those muscles, I highly recommend the Quick Fit Workout DVDs.  By following the suggested schedule, you get get a thorough workout that will definitely help get you into shape.  It requires no more than an hour a day (less than that when you're first starting out), and it is easy to split that hour up into two sessions if needed.  Following the initial 12-week program, I lost 20 pounds and felt like I had taken a decade off of my age!The only reason I did not give this program 5 stars is I felt the cardio workouts - particularly ""Cardio Classic"" - got a little monotonous for my tastes.  I still use them, but often substitute another cardio activity such as jogging or even some of Gilad's other DVDs in place of the QFW cardio routines (my favorite is the cardio portion of the ""45/45 Split Routine"" but be warned that it has a lot of high-impact aerobics).One day off a week is provided for in the suggested schedule, but after the first six weeks on the program, I found my 45-year old body really feeling exhausted.  I decided from that point on I'll take every seventh week off as well.  That's not suggested in the program, but my body appreciates the extra rest and it helps keep me motivated for sticking with the system.So if you find yourself out of shape, I highly recommend this product!",4,It really works!,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,1537,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'get', 'picture', 'cover', 'muscle', 'fitness', 'magazine', '*not*', 'product', 'However', ""'re"", 'wanted', 'methodical', 'system', 'losing', 'extra', 'pounds', 'putting', 'tone', 'back', 'muscles', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Quick', 'Fit', 'Workout', 'DVDs', 'following', 'suggested', 'schedule', 'get', 'get', 'thorough', 'workout', 'will', 'definitely', 'help', 'get', 'shape', 'more', 'hour', 'day', 'less', 'when', ""'re"", 'first', 'starting', 'out', 'easy', 'split', 'hour', 'up', 'two', 'sessions', 'needed', 'Following', 'initial', '12-week', 'program', 'lost', '20', 'pounds', 'felt', 'had', 'taken', 'decade', 'age', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'program', '5', 'stars', 'felt', 'cardio', 'particularly', 'Cardio', 'Classic', 'got', 'little', 'monotonous', 'tastes', 'still', 'use', 'often', 'cardio', 'activity', 'such', 'jogging', 'even', 'Gilad', 'other', 'DVDs', 'place', 'QFW', 'cardio', 'routines', 'favorite', 'cardio', 'portion', '45/45', 'Split', 'Routine', 'be', 'warned', 'lot', 'high-impact', 'aerobics', '.One', 'day', 'week', 'provided', 'suggested', 'schedule', 'first', 'six', 'weeks', 'program', 'found', '45-year', 'old', 'body', 'really', 'feeling', 'exhausted', 'decided', 'point', ""'ll"", 'take', 'seventh', 'week', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'suggested', 'program', 'body', 'extra', 'rest', 'keep', 'motivated', 'sticking', 'system.So', 'find', 'shape', 'highly', 'recommend', 'product']",Gilad: Quick Fit System Fat Burning Body Sculpting Cardio Workout Set
