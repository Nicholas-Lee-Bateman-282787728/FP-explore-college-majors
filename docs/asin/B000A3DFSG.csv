Granted, they have grown as a band since this was released, have a few different members, and two new albums, you still cannot go wrong with this raw and energetic concert DVD. It brings you into Shinedowns live world which is one where all they aim to do is put on the best possible show they can for their fans. They sound great. So energetic. Definitely a must buy for any SD or rock fan. I certainly hope they come out with a newer one soon that includes their newer concerts and material because I've seen them 6 times since this show and they just somehow get better each time!",5,Best performing band of our time,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,628,"['Honestly', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'Granted', 'have', 'grown', 'band', 'was', 'released', 'have', 'few', 'different', 'members', 'two', 'new', 'albums', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'raw', 'energetic', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Shinedowns', 'live', 'world', 'one', 'where', 'aim', 'do', 'put', 'best', 'possible', 'show', 'can', 'fans', 'sound', 'great', 'So', 'energetic', 'Definitely', 'must', 'buy', 'SD', 'rock', 'fan', 'certainly', 'hope', 'come', 'out', 'newer', 'one', 'soon', 'newer', 'concerts', 'material', ""'ve"", 'seen', '6', 'times', 'show', 'just', 'somehow', 'get', 'better', 'time']",N/A

I love their other more recent DVD/CD set, 'Somewhere in the Stratosphere' - I wrote a glowing review for it and easily rated it 5 stars.  Compared to that, I was disappointed by this 'Live from the Inside' DVD, I just didn't enjoy it much.  For me, as a middle-aged guy and a lifetime fan of rock and other kinds of music (and a musician myself), I simply found this performance too raw, too unpolished, too immature, capturing a band still in the process of finding themselves and their voice.  Yes, there's energy and intensity here, but it's unfocused and uncontrolled (drugs might be a factor).  Maybe you'll like this 'older' version of Shinedown just as much as (or more than) the newer one, but I personally prefer the newer one by a wide margin.  Just my opinion ...",2,I like the 'newer' Shinedown a lot more ...,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,891,"['might', 'get', 'negative', 'votes', 'review', 'Shinedown', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'honest', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'love', 'other', 'more', 'recent', 'DVD/CD', 'set', 'Stratosphere', 'wrote', 'glowing', 'review', 'easily', 'rated', '5', 'stars', 'Compared', 'was', 'disappointed', ""'Live"", 'Inside', 'DVD', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'much', 'middle-aged', 'guy', 'lifetime', 'fan', 'rock', 'other', 'kinds', 'music', 'musician', 'myself', 'simply', 'found', 'performance', 'too', 'raw', 'too', 'unpolished', 'too', 'immature', 'capturing', 'band', 'still', 'process', 'finding', 'voice', 'Yes', 'energy', 'intensity', 'here', 'unfocused', 'uncontrolled', 'drugs', 'might', 'be', 'factor', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'like', ""'older"", 'version', 'Shinedown', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'newer', 'one', 'personally', 'prefer', 'newer', 'one', 'wide', 'margin', 'Just', 'opinion']",N/A

This DVD was recorded from the final stop on their 2-year long tour that supported their first album. I have a hard time getting into new bands, my musical tastes are firmly cemented between the 1960s-1990s. Shinedown, however, has struck a chord with me because of a few reasons. Every member of the band is very talented, but singer Brent Smith is most impressive. The guy can belt it out and could (eventually) end up in the realm of Geoff Tate, Rob Halford, and Bruce Dickinson. The guy's a true vocalist...Their lyrics are thought-provoking and their songs are catchy...Oh and judging by this DVD they're a great Live act. This is far from the best concert DVD I've seen; After all, this DVD features only songs from the first album. But the guys have a polished live act and the camera work isn't bad. It's clear the crowd there was really digging the show. I'm not going to bother including the set list, because it's probably on here somewhere. The bonus features are interesting (two music videos; Simple Man & .45) and a Bonus Documentary, which takes a look at the band...Surprisingly, they all seem like nice genuine dudes who really love their fans. I don't know if I'd buy this DVD (I got lucky and found a place that had it to rent), but I will definitely buy the next DVD they put out (if they ever do). Hardcore fans of Shinedown will like it a lot more than just casual fans and if you're looking for material from the 2nd CD, you'll be very disappointed.GRADE: B+",4,"Good, But They Need to Release a New One",1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,1558,"['got', 'Shinedown', 'release', 'second', 'album', 'Us', 'Them', 'DVD', 'was', 'recorded', 'final', 'stop', '2-year', 'long', 'tour', 'supported', 'first', 'album', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'new', 'bands', 'musical', 'tastes', 'are', 'firmly', 'cemented', '1960s-1990s', 'Shinedown', 'however', 'struck', 'chord', 'few', 'reasons', 'member', 'band', 'very', 'talented', 'singer', 'Brent', 'Smith', 'most', 'impressive', 'guy', 'can', 'belt', 'out', 'could', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'realm', 'Geoff', 'Tate', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'Bruce', 'Dickinson', 'guy', 'true', 'vocalist', 'lyrics', 'are', 'thought-provoking', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'Oh', 'judging', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'great', 'Live', 'act', 'far', 'best', 'concert', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'only', 'songs', 'first', 'album', 'guys', 'have', 'polished', 'live', 'act', 'camera', 'work', ""n't"", 'bad', 'clear', 'crowd', 'was', 'really', 'digging', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'bother', 'including', 'set', 'list', 'probably', 'here', 'somewhere', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'interesting', 'two', 'music', 'videos', 'Simple', 'Man', '.45', 'Bonus', 'Documentary', 'look', 'band', 'Surprisingly', 'seem', 'nice', 'genuine', 'dudes', 'who', 'really', 'love', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'got', 'lucky', 'found', 'place', 'had', 'rent', 'will', 'definitely', 'buy', 'next', 'DVD', 'put', 'out', 'ever', 'do', 'fans', 'Shinedown', 'will', 'like', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'casual', 'fans', ""'re"", 'looking', 'material', '2nd', 'CD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'disappointed.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
