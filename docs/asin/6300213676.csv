207964,AK6UVFSU07NXH,6300213676,Anthony Hinde,"[23, 24]","Do you ever feel guilty for enjoying a film? Perhaps you're just a little reluctant to admit you like it... Okay, I admit it I like &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;. And this, despite the fact that it stars Warren Beatty who's  performances usually make me want to weep, even in comedies. All I can say  is that he  really shines in this film. Mind you, he is helped tremendously  by the supporting cast.I was particularly taken with Julie  Christie in the role of Betty Logan, a passionate environmentalist who has  taken on a mission to stop industrialist Leo Farnsworth, (Beatty), from  destroying a small community in England. Little does she know that  Farnsworth died a short time before she met him. Leo's earthly role had  been assumed by an unlucky footballer by the name of Joe Pendleton,  snatched from life by an overzealous angel during a road accident.If any of this sounds familiar, you may be remembering the original  use of the story in the 1941 film, &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot;,  starring Robert Montgomery. Short of Farnsworth being named Bruce instead  of Leo, there is little to distinguish these two versions from one another.  Even so, I prefer the 1978 version. It just seems to have more charm, more  innocence.It also has a touch of class, mainly due to the  presence of James Mason, in  the role of Mr Jordan, who has to step in and  try to make thinks right with the prematurely breathless Joe. Joe is  understandably miffed at his mistreatment since he and his team were due to  play in the superbowl, Joe's one dream. Mr Jordan offers Joe a number of  alternative routes back into the mortal realm. Each path involves taking on  the life of a soon to be dead person. Sadly, nothing short of a star  quarterback seems to satisfy Joe who eventually settles for a test-drive on  the Farnsworth model; rich, powerful but not particularly athletic.From that point on we are taken on a twin journey. On the one hand  Joe, despite his new-found wealth, still has super-bowl ambitions. The  first step in his plan is to buy his old team. The other path is prompted  by the passions of Betty Logan. Farnsworth has to straighten up his  corporate image to impress his new lady-love. This is not an easy task  given the long list  of atrocities his board is quite happy to see  continue.I suppose some of the attraction in the story comes from  its reversal of our common dreams. Usually we dream of leaving our  lacklustre existence and jumping into the swimming pool of the rich and  famous. In this case, Joe does get the pool but he just wants to get his  old life back. He is too good-natured to be trapped by the false idolatry  offered by money.We have the fun of watching him struggle back  into his old shoes and take his disbelieving associates with him. In fact,  his old coach Max Corkle, (Jack Warden), is one of the hardest to convince  but eventually becomes one of Leo's/Joe's biggest supporters. Which is  typical of the film. The story is fun but it's the character's friendships  that keep us watching.",4,Second chances can be dangerous.,957657600,"05 7, 2000",2000,3043,"['Do', 'ever', 'feel', 'guilty', 'enjoying', 'film', 'Perhaps', ""'re"", 'just', 'little', 'reluctant', 'admit', 'Okay', 'admit', 'quot', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'quot', 'fact', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'who', 'performances', 'usually', 'make', 'want', 'weep', 'even', 'comedies', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'film', 'Mind', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'supporting', 'cast.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'taken', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'role', 'Betty', 'Logan', 'passionate', 'environmentalist', 'who', 'taken', 'mission', 'stop', 'industrialist', 'Leo', 'Farnsworth', 'Beatty', 'destroying', 'small', 'community', 'England', 'Little', 'know', 'Farnsworth', 'died', 'short', 'time', 'met', 'Leo', 'earthly', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'assumed', 'unlucky', 'footballer', 'name', 'Joe', 'Pendleton', 'snatched', 'life', 'overzealous', 'angel', 'road', 'familiar', 'may', 'be', 'remembering', 'original', 'use', 'story', '1941', 'film', 'quot', 'Here', 'Mr.', 'Jordan', 'quot', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'Short', 'Farnsworth', 'being', 'named', 'Bruce', 'instead', 'Leo', 'little', 'distinguish', 'two', 'versions', 'one', 'Even', 'so', 'prefer', '1978', 'version', 'just', 'have', 'more', 'charm', 'more', 'innocence.It', 'also', 'touch', 'class', 'mainly', 'due', 'presence', 'James', 'Mason', 'role', 'Mr', 'Jordan', 'who', 'step', 'try', 'make', 'thinks', 'right', 'prematurely', 'breathless', 'Joe', 'Joe', 'understandably', 'miffed', 'mistreatment', 'team', 'were', 'due', 'play', 'superbowl', 'Joe', 'one', 'dream', 'Mr', 'Jordan', 'Joe', 'number', 'alternative', 'routes', 'back', 'mortal', 'realm', 'path', 'taking', 'life', 'soon', 'be', 'dead', 'person', 'Sadly', 'nothing', 'short', 'star', 'quarterback', 'satisfy', 'Joe', 'who', 'eventually', 'test-drive', 'Farnsworth', 'model', 'rich', 'powerful', 'not', 'particularly', 'point', 'are', 'taken', 'twin', 'journey', 'one', 'hand', 'Joe', 'new-found', 'wealth', 'still', 'super-bowl', 'ambitions', 'first', 'step', 'plan', 'buy', 'old', 'team', 'other', 'path', 'prompted', 'passions', 'Betty', 'Logan', 'Farnsworth', 'straighten', 'up', 'corporate', 'image', 'impress', 'new', 'lady-love', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'given', 'long', 'list', 'atrocities', 'board', 'quite', 'happy', 'see', 'continue.I', 'suppose', 'attraction', 'story', 'reversal', 'common', 'dreams', 'Usually', 'dream', 'leaving', 'lacklustre', 'existence', 'jumping', 'swimming', 'pool', 'rich', 'famous', 'case', 'Joe', 'get', 'pool', 'just', 'get', 'old', 'life', 'back', 'too', 'good-natured', 'be', 'trapped', 'false', 'idolatry', 'offered', 'money.We', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'struggle', 'back', 'old', 'shoes', 'take', 'disbelieving', 'associates', 'fact', 'old', 'coach', 'Max', 'Corkle', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'one', 'hardest', 'convince', 'eventually', 'one', ""Leo's/Joe"", 'biggest', 'supporters', 'Which', 'typical', 'film', 'story', 'fun', 'character', 'friendships', 'keep', 'watching']",N/A

The combo of Warren Beatty and Julie Christie has always pleased me (my absolute favorite of theirs--and one of my favorite films, period, is ""McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller"").  What I think is  special about ""Heaven Can Wait"" is the great supporting cast.  All are  wonderful and wonderfully funny.  Some of the dialogue between Diane Cannon  and Charles Grodin is side-splitting.  James Mason plays the sophisticated  guide, Mr. Jordan, to a tee, while Buck Henry's dry wit hits with pin-point  accuracy.  Jack Warden is always solid and this film was certainly no  exception.The only thing negative I can comment on is Julie Christie's  role.  Many parts of the screenplay failed her miserably, especially the  scene where she was confronting Beatty (when he became Farnsworth) for the  first time.  As the scene played out, it felt like someone was running a  fingernail across a chalkboard.  Actually, Christie's role turned out to be  minor compared to the others, and this is a shame.  She is one of the most  beautiful and talented actresses ever to grace the screen, and I felt her  talents were wasted for much of the film.  I also agree with the reviewer  who didn't like her hair.

We soon find out that he was destined to survive the accident, but was ""taken out"" by practicing angelic entity played by Buck Henry before the laws of probability and outcome could determine Joe's fate. An appeal is issued to management in the form of the magnificent James Mason as Mr.Jordon, who is left with the task of finding Joe a suitable body to make his return to earth in after we find that Joe's body was cremated before we could work out all the red tape at Heaven's departure terminal.In the very small ""What If You Died and Came Back"" genre this is hands-down the best of the bunch. Beatty gets credit for bulking up for the role and amazingly has no credibility issues with the casual audience as an aspiring pro QB with eyes on a shot at the Super Bowl. His natural comic timing and comfort zone chemistry with Julie Christy make this film a real keeper. The contributions by deadpan Charles Grodin and the freneticly delicious Dyan Cannon wiil have you howling in laughter.Now the bad news. Paramount gets no props for this DVD release.

And they're right.  This is a sweet-natured movie, perhaps the lightest fare that Warren Beatty ever produced.  And of course, GOD doesn't make mistakes, but bumbling newly promoted angels do, at least in fantasy land.  In that, this movie pays homage to earlier classics like &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;  as well as its source film, &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan.&quot;Speaking of &quot;Mr. Jordan,&quot;  while many of the reviewers here duly praise Beatty, Julie Christie and comic villains, Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin (perfect pairing), it also bears mentioning that James Mason is perfectly cast in what would have been the title role if they hadn't gone and changed the title.  It's hardly a stretch for him, but like the rest of the cast he seems to be having a great time.  In fact, that's one of the secondary pleasures of HEAVEN CAN WAIT.

Jack Warden is superb as the coach who has to be persuaded that it is, indeed, Warren Beatty, and he goes a long way ""in faith"" to accept it as true, especially in light of the fact that Beatty has entered into the body of a very wealthy man, and the team doesn't want to have some ""rich guy"" owning the team.Then there are the ""angels,"" James Mason and Buck Henry, and they are equally good as well, although I can't say I'd buy into seeing real angels look like them.

Sonuvab!tch got my team.""- His crony: ""What kind of pressure did he use, Milt?""- Bitter ex-owner: ""Well, I asked for sixty-seven million, and he said 'Okay.'""- His crony: ""Ruthless bastard.""Oh, if only Buck Henry's celestial guide hadn't farted around with the dynamics of probability and outcome. If only he hadn't yanked a soul out prematurely. But then we might not have gotten 1978's HEAVEN CAN WAIT. This is my favorite Warren Beatty movie, and it's not even close. It's marvelous entertainment that blends in an afterlife snafu, populist politics, slapstick comedy, a really sweet romance, and no less than three garish murder attempts.Our guy is Joe Pendleton (Beatty), a back-up quarterback in an era in which Los Angeles still fielded a professional football team. A fatal road wreck dumps Joe in the billowy fields of the afterlife. There, he's guided to the celestial way station by an officious escort (Buck Henry). When Joe balks and his strange obstinacy compels the celestial administrator to consult the heavenly records, it's learned that Joe isn't scheduled to die for fifty more years. The administrator, Mr. Jordan (James Mason), offers to remedy the goof-up, except that Joe's mortal body has just been cremated. But Joe is adamant about returning to human form. He's got a Superbowl to play in.The film doesn't keep track of how many dying candidates Joe and Mr. Jordan visit - Joe can occupy a body once its original soul has left - but they finally arrive at the opulent home of the shady millionaire industrialist, Leo Farnsworth. Farnsworth is in his room currently engaged in gasping his last breath, seeing as how his wife and her lover had just fatally dosed him. Joe is about to pass on Farnsworth when schoolteacher, Miss Betty Logan (Julie Christie), storms into the household. She's come to protest the construction of a Farnsworth refinery in her tiny English village of Pagglesham of which 1673 citizens are about to be evicted. But her activism is a sidenote here. What's important is that Joe Pendleton is instantly, irrevocably smitten. He decides to inhabit Farnsworth's body after all.I'll try to refrain from the gush, but I freaking love this movie. It's one of the few remakes that improves on the original film (but you should see 1941's HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, too, because it's really good). Warren Beatty is solid and wonderfully deadpan here. I like the energy he exudes, how he maintains an irrespressible sense of physicality. His character's preferred method of locomotion seems to be either running or striding with purpose. His supporting cast is brilliant, from James Mason and his Old World elegance to the fussy Buck Henry to the wickedly funny Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin (who plays Farnsworth's ""personal private executive secretary"" and also Farnsworth's wife's lover). Cannon ended up getting nominated for an Oscar, as was Jack Warden, who plays Max Corkle, Joe's down-to-earth pal and L.A. Rams trainer. Maybe I'll mention that a key plotline revolves around Joe, in his Farnworth guise, hiring Max to get him in good enough shape to try out as quarterback for the Rams. Max takes a heck of a convincing. But a chiropractic neck maneuver and a really awful session on the soprano saxophone do the trick.There are so many clever bits and gags, one comic set piece after another, and, no, I won't ruin them by mentioning them. I'll just reiterate that Dyan Cannon and Grodin are outstanding. By this time, Beatty and Julie Christie's fling had cooled off, but the chemistry is still palpable onscreen. They're dynamite together. Former Rams Deacon Jones, Jack T. Snow, and Les Josephson and sportscaster Bryant Gumbel drop in for cameos to lend that ounce of verisimilitude.

And through our unfortunately cynical, two-faced, world, we come to understand that perhaps not many people will truly stand for us, and in this film only one man did stand for the star, played by Warren Beatty, this being the humble coach, Jack Warden.  And the movie actually answers as many questions, as it leaves unanswered!  With an entertaining music score, ""Heaven Can Wait"" is very well representative of the late 1970's romantic comedies.  I cannot explain why the movie is not better known, other than it being the case the many of the most beautiful objects are often forgotten, or not recognized.

In the original Joe Pendleton is a boxer but in this film Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty) is a quarterback for the LA Rams.  While riding on his bike he is hit by a truck.  He awakens at a weigh station but refuses to board the jet to heaven.  His escort (Buck Henry) refuses to believe that Joe is right and calls his supervisor Mr. Jordan (James Mason).  They find out that Joe is right and the escort is ordered to return him to his body.  But the body is cremated.  Mr. Jordan and Joe start looking for a substitute body. (This is a hilarious sequence.)They settle on Leo Farnsworth, a world famous industrialist, who is being murdered by his wife, Julia (Dyan Cannon) and secretary, Tony Abbott (Charles Gordin).  As Leo, Joe is a total disaster.  He has no idea of what Farnsworth's company does or how to run it.  But in the clutch he comes up with some very interesting ideas.During the process he meets Betty Logan (Julie Christie) whose village in England is going to be razed to build a refinery. He decides to save her village and marry her. (Despite his current marriage.)Next he decides to get in shape and become quarterback for the Rams.  He contacts his old pal the team trainer Max Corkle (Jack Weston).  He tries to explain to Max what happened.  (This is a totally manic scene.)  Max is finally convinced and they start to work to get him in shape.  But using the staff to scrimmage is not working so Joe buys the Rams.As everything starts to come together for Joe, he is told that his temporary arrangement has come to an end and must give up Leo's body.  Joe refuses but Julia and Tony's latest attempt succeeds.A new body is found, Tom Jarrett, the Rams starting quarterback.  Joe as Tom wins the Super Bowl.  Everything is now fine so Mr. Jordan returns to the weigh station and Joe's memories go with him - well almost all do.This is a fantasy film (Rams winning a Super Bowl while in LA!) and it works very well on this level.  Warren Beatty has chosen two co creators to facilitate this.  Co writer Elaine May is known as a great comedy writer and she worked perfectly with Beatty.  Co director Buck Henry is known for his farcical touch - he created the smash it Get Smart.  Having these two collaborate with Beatty was a great stroke of genius.Dyan Cannon steals the show as the unfaithful wife.  She hits every comic note perfectly.  When she needs to go over the top, she does.  When she needs to be subtle, she is.  The rest of the cast is also perfection.This is a great comic farce that you'll enjoy from many vantage points.DVD EXTRAS: None",5,Beatty Takes Control,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,2628,"['Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'remake', 'Here', 'Comes', 'Mr.', 'Jordan', 'original', 'Joe', 'Pendleton', 'boxer', 'film', 'Joe', 'Pendleton', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'quarterback', 'LA', 'Rams', 'riding', 'bike', 'hit', 'truck', 'weigh', 'station', 'board', 'jet', 'heaven', 'escort', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'believe', 'Joe', 'right', 'supervisor', 'Mr.', 'Jordan', 'James', 'Mason', 'find', 'out', 'Joe', 'right', 'escort', 'ordered', 'return', 'body', 'body', 'cremated', 'Mr.', 'Jordan', 'Joe', 'start', 'looking', 'substitute', 'body', 'hilarious', 'sequence', 'settle', 'Leo', 'Farnsworth', 'world', 'famous', 'industrialist', 'who', 'being', 'murdered', 'wife', 'Julia', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'secretary', 'Tony', 'Abbott', 'Charles', 'Gordin', 'Leo', 'Joe', 'total', 'disaster', 'idea', 'what', 'Farnsworth', 'company', 'how', 'run', 'clutch', 'up', 'very', 'interesting', 'ideas.During', 'process', 'Betty', 'Logan', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'village', 'England', 'going', 'be', 'razed', 'build', 'refinery', 'save', 'village', 'marry', 'current', 'marriage', 'get', 'shape', 'become', 'quarterback', 'Rams', 'old', 'pal', 'team', 'trainer', 'Max', 'Corkle', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'explain', 'Max', 'what', 'happened', 'totally', 'manic', 'scene', 'Max', 'finally', 'convinced', 'start', 'work', 'get', 'shape', 'using', 'staff', 'scrimmage', 'not', 'working', 'so', 'Joe', 'Rams.As', 'everything', 'come', 'together', 'Joe', 'told', 'temporary', 'arrangement', 'come', 'end', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'Leo', 'body', 'Joe', 'Julia', 'Tony', 'latest', 'attempt', 'succeeds.A', 'new', 'body', 'found', 'Tom', 'Jarrett', 'Rams', 'starting', 'quarterback', 'Joe', 'Tom', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'Everything', 'now', 'fine', 'Mr.', 'Jordan', 'weigh', 'station', 'Joe', 'memories', 'go', 'well', 'almost', 'do.This', 'fantasy', 'film', 'Rams', 'winning', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'LA', 'very', 'well', 'level', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'chosen', 'two', 'co', 'creators', 'facilitate', 'Co', 'writer', 'Elaine', 'May', 'known', 'great', 'comedy', 'writer', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'Beatty', 'Co', 'director', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'known', 'farcical', 'touch', 'created', 'smash', 'Get', 'Smart', 'Having', 'two', 'collaborate', 'Beatty', 'was', 'great', 'stroke', 'genius.Dyan', 'Cannon', 'show', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'comic', 'note', 'perfectly', 'When', 'go', 'top', 'When', 'be', 'subtle', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'perfection.This', 'great', 'comic', 'farce', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'many', 'vantage', 'points.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A

I have good memories of the movie, the friend I saw it with, and our discussion after the film ended.I rediscovered it a couple of years ago on Amazon Prime, and have watched it two or three times.  It's been fun to revisit it. I was particularly impressed the most recent time I watched it by Warren Beatty's performance, his development of the character of Joe Pendleton, an earnest and straightforward football player whose basic honesty and innocence contrasts nicely with the comically ridiculous avarice of the characters he finds himself surrounded by, when his spirit takes possession the body of a wealthy man who was murdered by his wife and &#34;personal private executive secretary.&#34;  The casting is great, the characters very funny. Beatty's performance is low-key, like Pendleton's character.  Beatty isn't always appreciated or noticed for his comic timing, but it's precise and spot-on in this movie.I agree with the reviewers who say that the strength of the story is in the characters and their relationships.Some reviewers apparently bought it on DVD, and complained about quality issues such as the dialogue being out of synch. I haven't seen those problems in the streaming version.

208037,A3SMT15X2QVUR8,6300213676,"Victoria Tarrani ""writer, editor, artist, des...","[44, 49]","Recently I watched the new DVD release of a classic favorite Heaven Can Wait.  Twenty-three years after it's screen release, the delightful Warren Beatty film still has the power to enchant and make me smile.Beatty is superb.  Julie Christie is wonderful. Dyan Cannon hasn't changed at all through the years and is as beautiful now as she was then.  The entire cast brings the story of a brand new angel who wanted to &quot;save&quot; Joe from so much pain at his death that he brought him out of his body early.  Yes, the angel killed him.  This angel's first assignment shows the mistakes any beginner can make, of course the ramifications are larger.  Joe would not have been between the crashing cars.Joe refuses to go to heaven; he wants to be returned to his body -- but it has been cremated. Reviewing many body-replacement opportunities (of those who died, but the death was undiscovered) he ultimately sees Farnsworth. He wasn't that interested in being an out-of shape murder victim, until Julie Christie, who has come to demand that her small town be spared a refining plant that would destroy them, comes to the Farnsworth estate in her regal fury that Joe says, &quot;Yes! I'll be Farnsworth. Temporarily.&quot;  The screen sizzles with romance (rather than today's explicit scenes) as angel Joe is smitten.To the delight of audiences, Beatty tries valiantly to be Farnsworth, but finds it impossible because he has a basic good-hearted nature while Farnsworth was more interested in making money. Follies and surprises follow Joe in his new life, but it was temporary and the murderers are still lurking.I do believe a scene was cut, and perhaps several.  There was a scene where's Joe's new idea to advertise his tuna canning never kills &quot;thinking fish&quot; or porpoises and charged one or two cents more per can.  In the original movie I believe they showed the amazing results as grocery stores everywhere sold more of his tuna than any other brand.Still, it is a feel-good five star movie, whether a scene was cut or not.",5,Heaven does wait...,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,2045,"['Recently', 'watched', 'new', 'DVD', 'release', 'classic', 'favorite', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'Twenty-three', 'years', 'screen', 'release', 'delightful', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'film', 'still', 'power', 'enchant', 'make', 'smile.Beatty', 'superb', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'wonderful', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', ""n't"", 'changed', 'years', 'beautiful', 'now', 'was', 'then', 'entire', 'cast', 'story', 'brand', 'new', 'angel', 'who', 'wanted', 'quot', 'save', 'quot', 'Joe', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'death', 'brought', 'body', 'early', 'Yes', 'angel', 'killed', 'angel', 'first', 'assignment', 'mistakes', 'beginner', 'can', 'make', 'course', 'ramifications', 'are', 'larger', 'Joe', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'crashing', 'cars.Joe', 'refuses', 'go', 'heaven', 'be', 'returned', 'body', 'been', 'cremated', 'Reviewing', 'many', 'body-replacement', 'opportunities', 'who', 'died', 'death', 'was', 'undiscovered', 'ultimately', 'Farnsworth', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'interested', 'being', 'out-of', 'shape', 'murder', 'victim', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'who', 'come', 'demand', 'small', 'town', 'be', 'spared', 'refining', 'plant', 'would', 'destroy', 'Farnsworth', 'estate', 'regal', 'fury', 'Joe', 'quot', 'Yes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Farnsworth', 'Temporarily.', 'quot', 'screen', 'romance', 'rather', 'today', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'angel', 'Joe', 'smitten.To', 'delight', 'audiences', 'Beatty', 'valiantly', 'be', 'Farnsworth', 'impossible', 'basic', 'good-hearted', 'nature', 'Farnsworth', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'making', 'money', 'Follies', 'surprises', 'follow', 'Joe', 'new', 'life', 'was', 'temporary', 'murderers', 'are', 'still', 'lurking.I', 'do', 'believe', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'perhaps', 'several', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Joe', 'new', 'idea', 'advertise', 'tuna', 'canning', 'never', 'quot', 'thinking', 'fish', 'quot', 'porpoises', 'charged', 'one', 'two', 'cents', 'more', 'can', 'original', 'movie', 'believe', 'showed', 'amazing', 'results', 'grocery', 'stores', 'everywhere', 'sold', 'more', 'tuna', 'other', 'brand.Still', 'feel-good', 'five', 'star', 'movie', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'not']",N/A

This is in my top 10 movies and definately number 1 or 2 in romantic comedies.I must mention the musical score by Dave Grusin.  Although Grusin has done tons of great stuff, for some reason the haunting melodies of Heaven Can Wait have always stuck with me through the years.  Absolute perfection!  I don't believe a soundtrack CD is available, but Grusin has revisited the themes from Heaven Can Wait on his ""Cinemagic"" (full orchestra) and ""Now Playing"" (solo piano) CD's.

208041,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6300213676,William Hare,"[3, 5]","This 1978 film qualifies as a Warren Beatty tour de force in that he starred, directed, and co-wrote the screenplay with Buck Henry, who also had a key supporting role in the film.  Beatty picked a sound project, a remake of the popular Robert Montgomery film, &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan.&quot;&quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; is a movie about a man who makes the most of a second chance after a mistake.  The film reveals that anybody can make mistakes, even emissaries from on high.  Just when Beatty had soared on planet earth to the level of receiving a start for the Los Angeles Rams at quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys he decides to go for a ride on his bicycle.  He becomes an accident fatality and is then directed by Buck Henry to the airplane that will take him to the next level.  When supervisor James Mason arrives it is learned that a mistake has been made and Beatty was not slated to arrive until well into the second decade of the twenty-first century.  Instead of boarding, as planned, Henry instead escorts Beatty back down to earth to reassume his former role as a Ram quarterback. They arrive too late as graveside rites are being delivered.Eventually Beatty is given a new life, that of a wealthy industrialist with an international reputation of polluting the environment and doing whatever else it takes to win.  Charles Grodin, the industrialist's executive secretary, along with disloyal wife Dyan Cannon believe they have killed him, only to have Beatty emerge in the other man's persona.  An immediate change is observed after Julie Christie arrives as a spokesperson from a small British town whose people stand to suffer from a factory the industrialist wishes to build.  Rather than spurning her protest, Beatty shocks Grodin, Cannon, and the conglomerate's board of directors by siding with Christie.Eventually Grodin kills off Beatty's second persona, after which he receives yet a third.  The same Ram quarterback with whom Beatty competed goes down at a crucial moment in the Super Bowl  at the Coliseum.  Beatty assumes his persona and directs the Rams to a winning touchdown in overtime.  In the meantime, while the game was being played, Ram trainer and Beatty friend Jack Warden help police to solve the murder of the industrialist, with Grodin and Christie being implicated.  The film ends with a meeting between Christie and Beatty, after which they go out for coffee, appearing to have much in common.Warren Beatty was on familiar ground playing quarterback in the film.  He had been a good enough running back at his Virginia high school to merit scholarship offers from universities, which he spurned to seek a career in acting.  Beatty handled his quarterback chores well enough in the film to prompt a quip from Pat Haden, an actual Ram quarterback of the period: &quot;The Rams oughta give Warren a tryout.&quot;",5,Beatty Tour de Force,1010707200,"01 11, 2002",2002,2861,"['1978', 'film', 'qualifies', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'starred', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'key', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'Beatty', 'picked', 'sound', 'project', 'remake', 'popular', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'film', 'quot', 'Here', 'Mr.', 'Jordan.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Heaven', 'Can', 'Wait', 'quot', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'most', 'second', 'chance', 'mistake', 'film', 'reveals', 'anybody', 'can', 'make', 'mistakes', 'even', 'emissaries', 'high', 'Just', 'when', 'Beatty', 'had', 'soared', 'planet', 'earth', 'level', 'receiving', 'start', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Rams', 'quarterback', 'Dallas', 'Cowboys', 'go', 'ride', 'bicycle', 'accident', 'fatality', 'then', 'directed', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'airplane', 'will', 'take', 'next', 'level', 'When', 'supervisor', 'James', 'Mason', 'learned', 'mistake', 'been', 'made', 'Beatty', 'was', 'not', 'slated', 'arrive', 'well', 'second', 'decade', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'Instead', 'boarding', 'planned', 'Henry', 'instead', 'Beatty', 'back', 'down', 'earth', 'reassume', 'former', 'role', 'Ram', 'quarterback', 'arrive', 'too', 'late', 'graveside', 'rites', 'are', 'being', 'delivered.Eventually', 'Beatty', 'given', 'new', 'life', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'international', 'reputation', 'polluting', 'environment', 'doing', 'else', 'win', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'industrialist', 'executive', 'secretary', 'disloyal', 'wife', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'believe', 'have', 'killed', 'only', 'have', 'Beatty', 'emerge', 'other', 'man', 'persona', 'immediate', 'change', 'observed', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'spokesperson', 'small', 'British', 'town', 'people', 'stand', 'suffer', 'factory', 'industrialist', 'build', 'Rather', 'spurning', 'protest', 'Beatty', 'Grodin', 'Cannon', 'conglomerate', 'board', 'directors', 'siding', 'Christie.Eventually', 'Grodin', 'Beatty', 'second', 'persona', 'yet', 'third', 'same', 'Ram', 'quarterback', 'whom', 'Beatty', 'competed', 'down', 'crucial', 'moment', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'Coliseum', 'Beatty', 'persona', 'Rams', 'winning', 'touchdown', 'overtime', 'meantime', 'game', 'was', 'being', 'played', 'Ram', 'trainer', 'Beatty', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'help', 'police', 'solve', 'murder', 'industrialist', 'Grodin', 'Christie', 'being', 'implicated', 'film', 'meeting', 'Christie', 'Beatty', 'go', 'out', 'coffee', 'appearing', 'have', 'much', 'common.Warren', 'Beatty', 'was', 'familiar', 'ground', 'playing', 'quarterback', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'good', 'enough', 'running', 'back', 'Virginia', 'high', 'school', 'merit', 'scholarship', 'offers', 'universities', 'spurned', 'seek', 'career', 'acting', 'Beatty', 'handled', 'quarterback', 'well', 'enough', 'film', 'prompt', 'quip', 'Pat', 'Haden', 'actual', 'Ram', 'quarterback', 'period', 'quot', 'Rams', 'oughta', 'give', 'Warren', 'tryout.', 'quot']",N/A
