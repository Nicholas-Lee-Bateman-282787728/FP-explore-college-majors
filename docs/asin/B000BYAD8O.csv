953078,A3LGFYDVKLICY8,B000BYAD8O,John Morgan,"[5, 6]","""Bill Hicks Live"" (the first Hicks DVD) is a terrific disc,  but ""Sane Man"" was clearly designed with the hardcore Hicks fans in mind. I've seen the VHS version of ""Sane Man,"" and while it is the same performance that is on this DVD, material has definitely been put back in that was missing from the video version. As a result, what we have is the closest thing to a genuinely complete, unedited Hicks performance that is commercially available - if there still is anything that has been edited out, it's very difficult to tell as the flow is completely uninterrupted (unlike the performances on ""Bill Hicks Live,"" which contain obvious cuts). This is also Hicks at his most raw - he's in top form in this show - angry about the the state of things in America (and his observations have only grown in relevance with time), sexually perverse and yet full of compassion for all of humanity all at the same time in that unique Hicks fashion. Plus he's in his natural environment - a comedy club on his home turf of Austin, Texas, as opposed to the performances on ""Bill Hicks Live"" which were filmed at concert halls in Canada and the UK. As a result, I imagine that this film is the closest thing to what it was like to experience Hicks live. I also really like the graininess of the video material at the beginning and end of the show, which gives it an underground vibe that is lacking from his later, more slick-looking productions. You can tell that the show was produced by his friend Kevin Booth, as Booth, being intimately familiar with Hicks' style, knows how to use the camera to enhance the power of the performance. The extras on the disc are essential viewing for any Hicks fan, as we finally get to see video from his legendary Outlaw Comics days of the 1980s, including a complete, unedited set. If you're a Hicks fan, you already know you have to have this. If you're not, you either don't like comedy or you haven't seen it yet - there's no other possibility.",5,THIS is the DVD for Hicks fans.,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,1974,"['Bill', 'Hicks', 'Live', 'first', 'Hicks', 'DVD', 'terrific', 'disc', 'Sane', 'Man', 'was', 'clearly', 'designed', 'hardcore', 'Hicks', 'fans', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'VHS', 'version', 'Sane', 'Man', 'same', 'performance', 'DVD', 'material', 'definitely', 'been', 'put', 'back', 'was', 'missing', 'video', 'version', 'result', 'what', 'have', 'closest', 'thing', 'genuinely', 'complete', 'unedited', 'Hicks', 'performance', 'commercially', 'available', 'still', 'anything', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'very', 'difficult', 'tell', 'flow', 'completely', 'uninterrupted', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'Live', 'contain', 'obvious', 'cuts', 'also', 'Hicks', 'most', 'raw', 'top', 'form', 'show', 'angry', 'state', 'things', 'America', 'observations', 'have', 'only', 'grown', 'relevance', 'time', 'sexually', 'perverse', 'yet', 'full', 'compassion', 'humanity', 'same', 'time', 'unique', 'Hicks', 'fashion', 'natural', 'environment', 'comedy', 'club', 'home', 'turf', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'opposed', 'performances', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'Live', 'were', 'filmed', 'concert', 'halls', 'Canada', 'UK', 'result', 'imagine', 'film', 'closest', 'thing', 'what', 'was', 'experience', 'Hicks', 'live', 'also', 'really', 'graininess', 'video', 'material', 'beginning', 'end', 'show', 'underground', 'vibe', 'lacking', 'later', 'more', 'slick-looking', 'productions', 'can', 'tell', 'show', 'was', 'produced', 'friend', 'Kevin', 'Booth', 'Booth', 'being', 'intimately', 'familiar', 'Hicks', 'style', 'how', 'use', 'camera', 'enhance', 'power', 'performance', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'essential', 'viewing', 'Hicks', 'fan', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'video', 'legendary', 'Outlaw', 'Comics', 'days', '1980s', 'including', 'complete', 'unedited', 'set', ""'re"", 'Hicks', 'fan', 'already', 'know', 'have', 'have', ""'re"", 'not', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'comedy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'other', 'possibility']",Bill Hicks - Sane Man

953080,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000BYAD8O,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[3, 6]","Filmed the year before his star-making album ""Dangerous,"" this performance features Bill Hicks' fundamental themes, but unlike his more famous work, this one leaves me cold.  I like Hicks, I support his message, but I find this specific film disappointing.  I'm glad I discovered his other work before I discovered this one, because if I'd started here, I probably would never have given him a second look.As you'd expect with Hicks, he uses dirty jokes and his in-yer-face stage persona to preach against mediocrity, political conformity, and banality.  Hicks fans will not be surprised by his themes, since this is essentially a younger version of the content that made him famous in the early 1990s.  Though he offers few surprises, he does offer the occasional gut laugh.But he falls short in how he handles some themes.  His use of the microphone to make cinematic sound effects, used more moderately in his albums, is so intense here that you have to watch with your hand on the volume control lest you burst your eardrums.  And while I agree with Hicks that 1980s pop was hackneyed, the punishments he puts on pop stars leave me feeling assaulted.  George Carlin notwithstanding, rape is not funny.Then I can't figure out the visual design.  Cross-fading the performance with b-roll of Hicks acting silly in the parking lot makes parts of the film hard to watch.  This stuff may fetch a laugh if you're watching while drunk or high, but for me, it made the image so herky-jerky that I had to avert my eyes, and occasionally cover my ears when the sound does similar monkey business.And what's with the shouting?  Constant, relentless shouting?  Does he hope to cow the audience into agreement?  The pop stars, politicians, and stuffy moralists he rails against are unlikely to watch this film, so he can't be shouting at them.  I agree with most of his points, but I'm already watching.  Holy cow, he's shouting at me!  Who does that help?I get the feeling, watching this, that Hicks hadn't found his own mold yet.  He sounds like the Southern Baptist Andrew Dice Clay, and not yet like Bill Hicks.  This piece of juvenilia, though probably interesting to fans, feels unfinished.

953082,A3AN0NXHARI55Q,B000BYAD8O,Magic Lemur,"[0, 0]","Have you ever had that experience where you're watching a DVD of something you're a fan of when suddenly your girlfriend/ housemate walks in and wants to watch it with you? All of a sudden you realise that what you're watching is an acquired taste, and is not necessarily for general consumption.I would love to say that this DVD is for all tastes and is full of undiscovered gems. Unfortunately (if you've seen most of Bill's other stuff) it is not, although you will discover some interesting material which is not on the other DVD's (e.g. the George Michael routines and Bill's Elvis impersonation).Even thoughThe Essential Collectioncovers a lot of similar material to this, this DVD still has some worthwhile material for us fans, including a performance from the underground show 'Outlaws Get Religion'. The routines seem to plug the gap left between his early performances (1982-1984) and his post-Relentless stuff.Two things to bear in mind though.First 80% of the material he performs is similar to his later stuff and even the DVD admits it is Bill's later work 'in embryonic form' (e.g. the vulgar 'Dick Clark' routine became the 'Rush Limbaugh' routine onRant in E-Minor).Second is that this DVD is easily the sickest of them all, with the aforementioned routine colliding with the 'Debbie Gibson lesbian-paedophilia' skit. Many people like his more vulgar routines but, as with the girlfriend/housemate scenario, it is not the type of thing you want to be seen watching. It is also notable that Hicks himself ditched such 'Nasty Comic' routines in his later shows.Anyhow, if you want to see some of Bill's material from after (and even during) his alcohol phase, then this DVD is a real treat and the first 2/3's of the routine comes over slightly dated but still as sharp as ever.However, if you've stumbled across this while exploring Bill's work, then do listen to his other albums and DVD's first.Either way it is worth remembering that, although he was a genius with bountiful insights, he also had equally gifted contemporaries (e.g.Sam Kinison), who are worth checking out too...",4,Basically just for fans,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,2099,"['Have', 'ever', 'had', 'experience', 'where', ""'re"", 'watching', 'DVD', 'something', ""'re"", 'fan', 'when', 'suddenly', 'girlfriend/', 'housemate', 'walks', 'watch', 'sudden', 'realise', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'acquired', 'taste', 'not', 'necessarily', 'general', 'consumption.I', 'would', 'love', 'say', 'DVD', 'tastes', 'full', 'undiscovered', 'gems', 'Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'Bill', 'other', 'stuff', 'not', 'will', 'discover', 'interesting', 'material', 'not', 'other', 'DVD', 'e.g', 'George', 'Michael', 'routines', 'Bill', 'Elvis', 'impersonation', 'thoughThe', 'Essential', 'Collectioncovers', 'lot', 'similar', 'material', 'DVD', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'material', 'fans', 'including', 'performance', 'underground', 'show', 'Get', 'Religion', 'routines', 'seem', 'plug', 'gap', 'left', 'early', 'performances', '1982-1984', 'post-Relentless', 'stuff.Two', 'things', 'bear', 'mind', 'though.First', '80', '%', 'material', 'similar', 'later', 'stuff', 'even', 'DVD', 'Bill', 'later', 'work', 'embryonic', 'form', 'e.g', 'vulgar', 'Clark', 'routine', 'became', ""'Rush"", 'Limbaugh', 'routine', 'onRant', 'E-Minor', '.Second', 'DVD', 'easily', 'sickest', 'aforementioned', 'routine', 'colliding', ""'Debbie"", 'Gibson', 'lesbian-paedophilia', 'skit', 'Many', 'people', 'more', 'vulgar', 'routines', 'girlfriend/housemate', 'scenario', 'not', 'type', 'thing', 'want', 'be', 'seen', 'watching', 'also', 'notable', 'ditched', 'such', ""'Nasty"", 'Comic', 'routines', 'later', 'shows.Anyhow', 'want', 'see', 'Bill', 'material', 'even', 'alcohol', 'phase', 'then', 'DVD', 'real', 'treat', 'first', '2/3', 'routine', 'over', 'slightly', 'dated', 'still', 'as', 'sharp', 'ever.However', ""'ve"", 'stumbled', 'while', 'exploring', 'Bill', 'work', 'then', 'do', 'listen', 'other', 'albums', 'DVD', 'first.Either', 'way', 'worth', 'remembering', 'was', 'genius', 'bountiful', 'insights', 'also', 'had', 'equally', 'gifted', 'contemporaries', 'e.g.Sam', 'Kinison', 'who', 'are', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'too']",Bill Hicks - Sane Man

First of all, Hicks was brilliant and this performance lives up to that very discription.

The problem is sometimes getting people to get access to stand up, not everyone watches stand up. For those that enjoyed his style, this is a must own. His act is on the edgy side & he goes places few dare to go, butt if you like that style, you are in for a royal treat!",5,bill hicks is so funny,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,358,"['bill', 'hicks', 'was', 'not', 'loved', 'everybody', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'funny', 'problem', 'sometimes', 'getting', 'people', 'get', 'access', 'stand', 'up', 'not', 'everyone', 'watches', 'stand', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'style', 'must', 'own', 'act', 'edgy', 'side', 'places', 'few', 'dare', 'go', 'butt', 'like', 'style', 'are', 'royal', 'treat']",Bill Hicks - Sane Man

Humanity does so desperately need more who will fearlessly come right out and say what so many are thinking yet are afraid to express. In this early routine from 1989, you'll find ample amounts of familiar Hicks views, ideas and gags - trying to get the same message across tends to make one repetitive - and he's much more lewd in his approach to rattle people compared to the more spiritual overtones of his subsequent material. But it's especially the latter half or so of this set that soars well above range as you realize the crowd had largely decided [although not all of them!] to strap on their existential crash helmets, let out a primal howl to the moon, and follow Hicks past the point of no return as they're ""lectured by a pale demon.""Hicks repeatedly jabs the phobic pressure points of his audience with his scathing critque of the culturally fascist, ""anti-intellectual"" ethic that noticeably began permeating the country in the early 80s like a bad rash. It is nothing short of searing, damning, and high on fire. America had become a ""Reagan Wet Dream"" version of itself, indoctrinating most into a 24/7/365 shopping mall mindset within a perpetually soothing 72 degree environment: what more could humanity hope for?""Sane Man"" has plenty of extras, additional clips and footage, and is highly recommended for old or new fans alike. Worth pointing out too is that with Bill Hicks, much like dissident/anarchist Noam Chomsky [who Bill would liken his views with], part of the public's fundamental attraction to such ""fringe"" types doesn't have as much to do with an interest in the usual cult of celebrity persona worship as much as it does the important, relevant social issues which are addressed by only a daring few while strategically ignored within the mainstream which seeks to control the public mind, to continually reinforce a limited view of reality that supports the social and economic power structure by disguising and downplaying the grim, daily realities within the staus quo. The personal psychological impetus driving such social outlaws is obvious, if not irrelevant, for every life embodies contradictory elements: Bill's passion was to raise awareness and wake people up. We miss ya man, and thanks to those who continually work to help keep Bill's voice alive, passing the torch further still.""The record of anarchist ideas, and even more, of the inspiring struggles of people who have sought to liberate themselves from oppression and domination, must be treasured and preserved, not as a means of freezing thought and conception in some new mold but as a basis for understanding of the social reality and committed work to change it. There is no reason to suppose that history is at an end, that the current structures of authority and domination are graven in stone. It would also be a great error to underestimate the power of social forces that will fight to maintain power and privledge."" ~ Chomsky",5,Solace For The Ignorance of Man,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2981,"['What', 'insightful', 'riot', 'guy', 'was', 'Humanity', 'so', 'desperately', 'need', 'more', 'who', 'will', 'fearlessly', 'come', 'right', 'say', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'thinking', 'yet', 'are', 'afraid', 'express', 'early', 'routine', '1989', ""'ll"", 'find', 'ample', 'amounts', 'familiar', 'Hicks', 'views', 'ideas', 'gags', 'trying', 'get', 'same', 'message', 'tends', 'make', 'one', 'repetitive', 'much', 'more', 'lewd', 'approach', 'rattle', 'people', 'compared', 'more', 'spiritual', 'overtones', 'subsequent', 'material', 'especially', 'latter', 'half', 'so', 'set', 'well', 'above', 'range', 'realize', 'crowd', 'had', 'largely', 'decided', '[', 'not', ']', 'strap', 'existential', 'crash', 'helmets', 'let', 'out', 'primal', 'howl', 'moon', 'follow', 'Hicks', 'point', 'return', ""'re"", 'lectured', 'pale', 'demon', 'Hicks', 'repeatedly', 'jabs', 'phobic', 'pressure', 'points', 'audience', 'scathing', 'critque', 'culturally', 'fascist', 'anti-intellectual', 'noticeably', 'began', 'permeating', 'country', 'early', '80s', 'bad', 'rash', 'nothing', 'short', 'searing', 'damning', 'high', 'fire', 'America', 'had', 'become', 'Reagan', 'Wet', 'Dream', 'version', 'indoctrinating', 'most', '24/7/365', 'shopping', 'mall', 'mindset', 'perpetually', 'soothing', '72', 'degree', 'environment', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'humanity', 'hope', 'Sane', 'Man', 'plenty', 'extras', 'additional', 'clips', 'footage', 'highly', 'recommended', 'old', 'new', 'fans', 'alike', 'pointing', 'out', 'too', 'Bill', 'Hicks', 'much', 'dissident/anarchist', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', '[', 'who', 'Bill', 'would', 'liken', 'views', ']', 'part', 'public', 'fundamental', 'attraction', 'such', 'fringe', 'types', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'interest', 'usual', 'cult', 'celebrity', 'persona', 'worship', 'as', 'much', 'important', 'relevant', 'social', 'issues', 'are', 'addressed', 'only', 'daring', 'few', 'strategically', 'ignored', 'mainstream', 'control', 'public', 'mind', 'continually', 'reinforce', 'limited', 'view', 'reality', 'social', 'economic', 'power', 'structure', 'disguising', 'downplaying', 'grim', 'daily', 'realities', 'staus', 'quo', 'personal', 'psychological', 'impetus', 'driving', 'such', 'social', 'outlaws', 'obvious', 'not', 'irrelevant', 'life', 'contradictory', 'elements', 'Bill', 'passion', 'was', 'raise', 'awareness', 'wake', 'people', 'up', 'miss', 'ya', 'man', 'thanks', 'who', 'continually', 'work', 'help', 'keep', 'Bill', 'voice', 'alive', 'passing', 'torch', 'further', 'still', 'record', 'anarchist', 'ideas', 'even', 'more', 'inspiring', 'struggles', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'sought', 'liberate', 'oppression', 'domination', 'must', 'be', 'treasured', 'preserved', 'not', 'means', 'freezing', 'thought', 'conception', 'new', 'mold', 'basis', 'understanding', 'social', 'reality', 'committed', 'work', 'change', 'reason', 'suppose', 'history', 'end', 'current', 'structures', 'authority', 'domination', 'are', 'graven', 'stone', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'great', 'error', 'underestimate', 'power', 'social', 'forces', 'will', 'fight', 'maintain', 'power', 'privledge', 'Chomsky']",Bill Hicks - Sane Man
