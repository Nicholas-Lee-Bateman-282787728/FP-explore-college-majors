930725,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AQ68W8,Grady Harp,"[49, 52]","S&eacute;bastien Lifshitz ('Come Undone', 'The Crossing') is one of the more sensitive directors to arrive on the scene in some time. He molds stories about the periphery of mankind and creates deeply human dramas without the clutter and noise that often dampen the effect of intense emotional experiences. He is intelligent, a fine writer and observer and a man unafraid to take chances: all but two of the actors in WILD SIDE are amateurs with no experience in front of the camera and from these neophytes he extracts brilliant performances. He is an artist to watch.St&eacute;phanie (St&eacute;phanie Michelini) is a transsexual who makes her living through prostitution on the streets of Paris. She is a gentle, soft-spoken, tender person who is making her way in life as the being she has selected to present. She meets Djamel (Yasmine Belmadi) a handsome bisexual North African young man who likewise makes his living turning tricks in the subways and streets of Paris, another person estranged from his family as is St&eacute;phanie. Yet another young man Mikhail (Edouard Nikitine) estranged from his family in Russia meets St&eacute;phanie and falls in love with her. The three outsiders from a true m&eacute;nage a trois, all three genetically males, all three in need of love and belonging and capable of sharing love equally within the trio. When St&eacute;phanie learns her estranged mother (Josiane Stol&eacute;ru) is critically ill, she travels to her rural French neighborhood of her youth together with Mikhail and Djamel and it is this confrontation with her past and the way she pieces her life together with the love of Mikhail and Djamel that creates the beauty of this film.Though there are innumerable reasons for recommending this film the main one remains the manner in which Lifshitz has taken a script written with his long-term associate and fellow professor at La F&eacute;mis (Paris) St&eacute;phane Bouquet about a marginalized portion of society and crafted one of the more touching love stories that needs and receives no apologies. St&eacute;phanie (the actress is a transsexual in real life and has never acted before) is presented not as an oddity but as just a human being for whom life has dealt some challenges. We see her in the opening scenes fully nude with the lovely body of a female that happens to also have male genitalia. The isolation of St&eacute;phanie's life is shown from the beginning in a scene where a group of transsexuals listen tearfully as a singer (Antony Hegarty) sings a tender ballad 'I fell in love with a beautiful dead boy...but was he a girl or a boy?'. This quiet manner pervades the film.Mikhail is likewise played by an unknown inexperienced actor and plumbs the depths of his lonely Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; with gently nuanced humility. Djamel and Stephanie's mother are played by actors with whom Lifshitz has worked before and their superlative work helps coax the best performances from the neophytes. The breathtaking cinematography is by Agn&egrave;s Godard, a genius for creating atmosphere and mood, equally successful in the cramped environs where the sex for money acts are performed as well as in the beauty of the Parisian streets and the French rural countryside. The subtle music score by Jocelyn Pook is variations by a string quartet and harp and very well composed.  The DVD gratefully includes and interview with Lifshitz and for once the information shared is extremely beneficial to the enjoyment of the film.Because audiences in general have difficulty with trans/homosexual love scenes this film will probably never receive the recognition it deserves. But for those who long for the power of truly fine independent films, this film is as fine as they come - in story, in direction, in acting, in cinematography and, most important, in honesty. It is a jewel of a movie. Highly Recommended.

930726,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000AQ68W8,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","I recently found this film on the shelves of my local public library.  It immediately attracted my attention because it was prominantly displayed.  Not so long ago, some library patrons openly protested that library kept copies of the much talked about book ""50 Shades of Gray"".  Librarians stood their ground and kept the book on shelves and apparently were bold to take it to another level and add real works of art, like this film, on the public display.This is French film about three men: Mikhail, Russian immigrant who works as a dishwasher in a restaurant after abandoning his career as a soldier in Russia; Arab French bisexual man Jamal, who makes his living  providing sexual favors to transients at the airports and train stations and Stephanie, transexual prositute working the streets and bars in Paris, constantly seeking clients.  Three of them live together in a small apartment, until one day Stephanie receives a phone call that her mother is gravely ill.  Before long, all three go to the remote village that Stephanie left 15 years ago.  During time that Stephanie tends to her dying mother, we learn about these three remarkable men and who they really are.It is really a tale of three strong individuals who make their own way in the world and pay the price for it.  What happens when one does not meet approval of one's parents - by not pursuing expected career (of a soldier) because one finds moral conflict in it; when one does not apologize for one's sexuality (bisexuality) in the world that favors heterosexuality as the ""proper"" way of meeting human sexual needs, or when the need for sexual expression does not meet parental acceptance?  All three characters choose to follow their personal need at the terrible price of estranging themselves from their families that are unwilling to accept them for who they really are.  It is heart wrenching choice that leads all three of them to loneliness that very few can understand.Stephanie is the main character of this film.  She is beautiful transexual with body and looks of a woman and sexual organ of a man.  Stephanie is sensitive woman, deeply affected about the world around her, not quite happy that her only choice is to make her living as a prostitute on the streets of Paris.  But lucky for her, she finds love not in one, but two men.  Together, they make emotional bond that nothing and no one can break.  At times of impending (parental) death and reflections on the past, years of growing up knowing that one is different from all other children, it is remarkable how their bond grows stronger.This is compassionate story about human beings who treasure their soul mates no matter how unconventional love it may seem to the outsiders. Neither one of them takes an easy way out and live conventional lives due to someone else's expectations.  They fight for their happiness, no matter the price.  It is great movie that is pure piece of art.  From the storytelling to the music and deep emotional message director has for the viewers.  I admire this director for being able to take on topic of the homosexuality and make no apologies for it.  It is a bold and emotionally charged message.  Surely, this kind of film is not for everyone's taste and as such will have smaller audience.  But its message is as humaine as it can be and as beautiful as any other love story.",5,True meaning of love,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,3359,"['recently', 'found', 'film', 'shelves', 'local', 'public', 'library', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'attention', 'was', 'prominantly', 'displayed', 'Not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'library', 'patrons', 'openly', 'protested', 'library', 'kept', 'copies', 'much', 'talked', 'book', '50', 'Shades', 'Gray', 'Librarians', 'stood', 'ground', 'kept', 'book', 'shelves', 'apparently', 'were', 'bold', 'take', 'level', 'add', 'real', 'works', 'art', 'film', 'public', 'display.This', 'French', 'film', 'three', 'men', 'Mikhail', 'Russian', 'immigrant', 'who', 'dishwasher', 'restaurant', 'abandoning', 'career', 'soldier', 'Russia', 'Arab', 'French', 'bisexual', 'man', 'Jamal', 'who', 'living', 'providing', 'sexual', 'favors', 'transients', 'airports', 'train', 'stations', 'Stephanie', 'transexual', 'prositute', 'working', 'streets', 'bars', 'Paris', 'constantly', 'seeking', 'clients', 'Three', 'live', 'together', 'small', 'apartment', 'one', 'day', 'Stephanie', 'phone', 'call', 'mother', 'gravely', 'ill.', 'long', 'three', 'go', 'remote', 'village', 'Stephanie', 'left', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'time', 'Stephanie', 'dying', 'mother', 'learn', 'three', 'remarkable', 'men', 'who', 'really', 'are.It', 'really', 'tale', 'three', 'strong', 'individuals', 'who', 'make', 'own', 'way', 'world', 'pay', 'price', 'What', 'when', 'one', 'not', 'meet', 'approval', 'one', 'parents', 'not', 'pursuing', 'expected', 'career', 'soldier', 'one', 'moral', 'conflict', 'when', 'one', 'not', 'apologize', 'one', 'sexuality', 'bisexuality', 'world', 'heterosexuality', 'proper', 'way', 'meeting', 'human', 'sexual', 'needs', 'when', 'need', 'sexual', 'expression', 'not', 'meet', 'parental', 'acceptance', 'three', 'characters', 'choose', 'follow', 'personal', 'need', 'terrible', 'price', 'estranging', 'families', 'are', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'choice', 'three', 'loneliness', 'very', 'few', 'can', 'understand.Stephanie', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'beautiful', 'transexual', 'body', 'woman', 'sexual', 'organ', 'man', 'Stephanie', 'sensitive', 'woman', 'deeply', 'affected', 'world', 'not', 'quite', 'happy', 'only', 'choice', 'make', 'living', 'prostitute', 'streets', 'Paris', 'lucky', 'love', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'men', 'Together', 'make', 'emotional', 'bond', 'nothing', 'one', 'can', 'break', 'times', 'impending', 'parental', 'death', 'reflections', 'past', 'years', 'growing', 'up', 'knowing', 'one', 'different', 'other', 'children', 'remarkable', 'how', 'bond', 'grows', 'stronger.This', 'compassionate', 'story', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'treasure', 'soul', 'matter', 'how', 'unconventional', 'love', 'may', 'seem', 'outsiders', 'one', 'easy', 'way', 'live', 'conventional', 'lives', 'due', 'someone', 'else', 'expectations', 'fight', 'happiness', 'matter', 'price', 'great', 'movie', 'pure', 'piece', 'art', 'storytelling', 'music', 'deep', 'emotional', 'message', 'director', 'viewers', 'admire', 'director', 'being', 'able', 'take', 'topic', 'homosexuality', 'make', 'apologies', 'bold', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'message', 'Surely', 'kind', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'such', 'will', 'have', 'smaller', 'audience', 'message', 'as', 'humaine', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'beautiful', 'other', 'love', 'story']",N/A
930727,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000AQ68W8,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 12]","Wild Side (Sebastien [...], 2004)I've been trying to figure out how I feel about this movie for weeks, and I'm stuck in deadlock. I get what [the director] was trying to do, and I admire him for trying to do it; I'm just not sure he pulled it off as much as he gets credit for having done.Stephanie (Stephanie Michelini) is a [TS] prostitute on the streets of Paris. She lives with two men, both rentboys as well: Djamel (Who Killed Bambi?'s Yasmine Belmadi) and Mikhail (Edouard Nikitine). When Stephanie's mother falls ill, Stephanie must return to the French countryside to take care of her. Djamel and Mikhail tag along, and Stephanie's mother (listed in the credits only as ""la mere"") has to deal not only with having a daughter where she previously had a son, but that daughter's rather unconventional romantic relationship.In other words, it's the family drama with added kink. It never really claims to not be the family drama, but I wondered a few times while watching it (and constantly while reading the reviews) if [the director] felt added kink was enough to take a relatively old, flavorless family drama and make it new. Of course, it'll work like a charm for those who are willing to upgrade anything with ""outsider"" characters and those odd ducks who are militant about only consuming media featuring gay characters. Not surprisingly, a good number of the reviews so far have been from that camp. Most of us, however, don't fall into it. And it seems to me that most of us are going to watch this film and say ""you've seen one family drama...""Not that it's not watchable or engaging. [The director] jumped on the bandwagon of ""recruit the folks you're casting from the ranks of those who live the life,"" and thus a decent portion of his cast are not professional actors; this is always a bit of a gamble. When it pays off (viz. Cidade de Deus), it pays off handsomely, but sometimes it doesn't. Here... half and half. Stephanie Michelini is a decent actor, but to take a non-actor and put her in a role of this importance? The other main newbie here is Nikitine, who as it turns out is not a bad actor at all. [The director] keeps things interesting by moving between the gentle, slow, talky family-drama scenes and the Parisian nightlife enjoyed (suffered?) by its main characters.After all this, though, I've no idea if I actually liked it. ***",3,"It's, um... something.",1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,2363,"['Wild', 'Side', 'Sebastien', '[', ']', '2004', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'feel', 'movie', 'weeks', ""'m"", 'stuck', 'deadlock', 'get', 'what', 'director', ']', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'admire', 'trying', 'do', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'pulled', 'off', 'as', 'much', 'credit', 'having', 'done.Stephanie', 'Stephanie', 'Michelini', '[', 'TS', ']', 'prostitute', 'streets', 'Paris', 'two', 'men', 'rentboys', 'as', 'well', 'Djamel', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Bambi', 'Yasmine', 'Belmadi', 'Mikhail', 'Edouard', 'Nikitine', 'When', 'Stephanie', 'mother', 'ill', 'Stephanie', 'must', 'return', 'French', 'countryside', 'take', 'care', 'Djamel', 'Mikhail', 'tag', 'along', 'Stephanie', 'mother', 'listed', 'credits', 'only', 'la', 'mere', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'having', 'daughter', 'where', 'previously', 'had', 'son', 'daughter', 'rather', 'unconventional', 'romantic', 'relationship.In', 'other', 'words', 'family', 'drama', 'added', 'kink', 'never', 'really', 'claims', 'not', 'be', 'family', 'drama', 'wondered', 'few', 'times', 'watching', 'constantly', 'reading', 'reviews', '[', 'director', ']', 'felt', 'added', 'kink', 'was', 'enough', 'take', 'relatively', 'old', 'flavorless', 'family', 'drama', 'make', 'new', 'course', ""'ll"", 'work', 'charm', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'upgrade', 'anything', 'outsider', 'characters', 'odd', 'ducks', 'who', 'are', 'militant', 'only', 'consuming', 'media', 'featuring', 'gay', 'characters', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'number', 'reviews', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'been', 'camp', 'Most', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'most', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'film', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'family', 'drama', 'Not', 'not', 'watchable', 'engaging', '[', 'director', ']', 'jumped', 'bandwagon', 'recruit', 'folks', ""'re"", 'casting', 'ranks', 'who', 'live', 'life', 'thus', 'decent', 'portion', 'cast', 'are', 'not', 'professional', 'actors', 'always', 'bit', 'gamble', 'When', 'viz', 'Cidade', 'Deus', 'handsomely', ""n't"", 'Here', 'half', 'half', 'Stephanie', 'Michelini', 'decent', 'actor', 'take', 'non-actor', 'put', 'role', 'importance', 'other', 'main', 'newbie', 'here', 'Nikitine', 'who', 'out', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', '[', 'director', ']', 'things', 'interesting', 'moving', 'gentle', 'slow', 'talky', 'family-drama', 'scenes', 'Parisian', 'nightlife', 'enjoyed', 'suffered', 'main', 'characters.After', ""'ve"", 'idea', 'actually', 'liked', '***']",N/A

930729,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B000AQ68W8,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[0, 0]","This is a film about Stephanie (Stephanie Michelini) who was born as Pierre, she survives as a prostitute on the streets of Paris and has some very enchanting co workers who don't seem to feel the cold very much judging by their choice of wardrobe, or rather lack of one. There is an awful lot of oral action actually, you start to wonder do men think about anything else, and the answer comes back pretty much as a `probably not'. Well enough said. As if she is not getting enough man meat action at work, she also has two lovers, which is a tad greedy by anyone's imagination.Then she gets a call from the hospital where her mother is dying, they are sending her home to the rural farm house where Pierre painfully grew up. So she and Mikhail head off to rural Nowheresville to care for her. Mikhail (Edouard Nikitine) is a Russian immigrant who misses his homeland but loves his two partners. He comes across as being very warm and caring, he is learning French but speaks a lot of English and of course his native tongue. They are then joined by Djamel (Yasmine Belmadi) who is a `hustler' -yay more sex! He is also Egyptian and has his own baggage too, emotional that is.They start to care for Stephanie's mum and through flash back we get the background story and how the three came to meet. This is a brilliantly acted, directed and shot piece of cinema, I found it totally captivating and full of real emotion and some very engaging performances. The interplay between mother and son/daughter was one of the most interesting and intelligent parts of the story.Directed and co-written by Sebastien Lifschitz (Presque Rien /Come Undone) this 94 minute offering is for anyone who is into world cinema and especially those of a gay theme. Whilst there is a fair bit of rumpy pumpy in this it is actually done very sensitively and with the three lovers it is genuinely touching without being crass or vulgar.
