A witch gets burned in the beginning of the movie which eventually somehow makes a curse to turn Paul Naschy back into a Werewolf hundreds of years later. This was odd. Basically an evil devil lady a skull of a demon with blood on it is made to bite Naschy & gets the Werewolf curse again. And she is killed by an axe murderer. The werewolf outfit this time was sort of goofy(you can see under the mask a little) & the face was weird looking. The transformation scenes were well done but overall it was just not that good - mostly in the 1st 30 minutes. Pretty graphically gory throughout the movie with rips and slashes of human flesh all over the place(bites in the neck, punctures in the chest) and as usual Naschy gets plenty of naked Naschy girls (full frontal - exposed breasts and well to be blunt hairy bush - hey this is Spanish horror) to be have sex with him. The love interest was lackluster. The Werewolf scenes were cool which saves the film and makes up for the first half hour.Night of the Werewolf is much better. So Id see that one first.Various websites are reporting that Curse of the Devil and The Werewolf shadow have defective discs..this is true on both titles. The people move oddly on them, its hard to explain but there is a choppiness to them when the people move..Id get the Anchor Bay versions to be safe if you really want them. The transfers aren't all that different from BCI what Ive read.++UPDATE++ Since I first made the review the Curse of the Devil DVD discs seem to have been fixed and there are various ways to get these movies via double disc sets or Naschy box sets.

496326,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B00000F0HH,Grindhouse and Horror,"[0, 0]","Carlos Aured was a great director of Spanish horror.  This old fashioned wolfman film is sort of an upgrade to the old 1941 film with Lon Chaney; add satanism, gore, more violence, give it a 70s film style and feeling, reconfigure the plot to an extent, throw in some nudity for the sake of nudity and also toss in an axe murderer, and you got CURSE OF THE DEVIL that's one of Paul Naschy's best films.  The atmosphere and scenery is great, and there's ample gore and violence in this fast paced film. The women look good, and there's full nudity in the film.  The gore isn't over the top, but there's a sufficient amount of it spread throughout the movie, along with some good suspense and action. There's also a scene when a woman disrobes near Naschy and says she's not leaving a virgin, and then there's that axe murderer that's tossed in to spice things up.  That guy doesn't do much, but he's in the film for a short time nevertheless.

496327,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B00000F0HH,J. B. Hoyos,"[3, 3]","I grew up watching ""Dark Shadows"" and one of my favorite characters was Quentin Collins.  He was a victim of a werewolf curse that was placed on him when he accidentally murdered his insane gypsy wife.  Waldemar Daninsky of ""Curse of the Devil"" reminds me very much of poor Quentin.  Daninsky accidentally shoots a gypsy (having mistook him for a wolf) and the werewolf curse is placed on him by devil worshipping gypsies.  During the full moon, he roams the countryside killing anyone who crosses his path; the superstitious villagers believe a werewolf is prowling the Carpathian woods, but the police believe it's an ax murderer who recently escaped from a mental institute.  As a result of having two murderers, the body count is deliciously high, higher than a ""Friday the 13th"" movie.  ""Curse of the Devil"" is very action packed.From the interesting liner notes that came with the DVD, I learned that ""Curse of the Devil"" is the sixth werewolf movie in eleven that stars Spanish horror icon, Paul Naschy.  Most, if not all, were written by Naschy under his pseudonym, Jacinto Molina.  It is no wonder he has love scenes with all of the beautiful lead actresses.  His screenplays are well written; their plots are always complex, almost too complex.I was overjoyed to discover that ""Curse of the Devil"" is gothic horror.  It is set in the late 1800's.  In fact, the prologue is set in the Medieval Dark Ages.  The best scenes are in the prologue.  Daninsky's ancestor destroys a coven of witches; there is a gruesome decapitation, multiple hangings of beautiful women from a bridge, and the burning of the priestess.  The ending is wonderfully downbeat as were many horror movies of the seventies.Also, from the liner notes, I learned that Paul Naschy did not wear a mask during his scenes as a werewolf.  He spent many grueling hours sitting patently while the makeup artist applied the hair, fangs, etc.  Never did he look as though he was wearing a mask.""Curse of the Devil"" is highly recommended for those who are fans of Paul Naschy.  I have only seen one werewolf movie from Hammer, ""Curse of the Werewolf.""  I thought ""Curse of the Devil"" would satisfy my craving.  Instead, I need to watch more werewolf movies starring Paul Naschy.  Fortunately, BCI Eclipse came out with ""Werewolf Shadow,"" which I will be watching soon.",4,"This Gothic Werewolf Classic Reminds Me of ""Dark Shadows""",1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,2335,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'was', 'Quentin', 'Collins', 'was', 'victim', 'werewolf', 'curse', 'was', 'placed', 'when', 'accidentally', 'murdered', 'insane', 'gypsy', 'wife', 'Waldemar', 'Daninsky', 'Curse', 'Devil', 'very', 'much', 'poor', 'Quentin', 'Daninsky', 'accidentally', 'gypsy', 'having', 'mistook', 'wolf', 'werewolf', 'curse', 'placed', 'devil', 'worshipping', 'gypsies', 'full', 'moon', 'countryside', 'killing', 'anyone', 'who', 'path', 'superstitious', 'villagers', 'believe', 'werewolf', 'prowling', 'Carpathian', 'woods', 'police', 'believe', 'ax', 'murderer', 'who', 'recently', 'escaped', 'mental', 'institute', 'result', 'having', 'two', 'murderers', 'body', 'count', 'deliciously', 'high', 'higher', 'Friday', '13th', 'movie', 'Curse', 'Devil', 'very', 'action', 'interesting', 'liner', 'notes', 'came', 'DVD', 'learned', 'Curse', 'Devil', 'sixth', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'eleven', 'Spanish', 'horror', 'icon', 'Paul', 'Naschy', 'Most', 'not', 'were', 'written', 'Naschy', 'pseudonym', 'Jacinto', 'Molina', 'wonder', 'love', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'lead', 'actresses', 'screenplays', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'plots', 'are', 'always', 'complex', 'almost', 'too', 'complex.I', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'discover', 'Curse', 'Devil', 'gothic', 'horror', 'set', 'late', '1800', 'fact', 'prologue', 'set', 'Medieval', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'prologue', 'Daninsky', 'ancestor', 'coven', 'witches', 'gruesome', 'decapitation', 'multiple', 'hangings', 'beautiful', 'women', 'bridge', 'burning', 'priestess', 'ending', 'wonderfully', 'downbeat', 'were', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'seventies.Also', 'liner', 'notes', 'learned', 'Paul', 'Naschy', 'did', 'not', 'wear', 'mask', 'scenes', 'werewolf', 'spent', 'many', 'grueling', 'hours', 'sitting', 'patently', 'makeup', 'artist', 'applied', 'hair', 'fangs', 'etc', 'Never', 'did', 'look', 'was', 'wearing', 'mask', 'Curse', 'Devil', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Paul', 'Naschy', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'Hammer', 'Curse', 'Werewolf', 'thought', 'Curse', 'Devil', 'would', 'satisfy', 'craving', 'Instead', 'need', 'watch', 'more', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Naschy', 'Fortunately', 'BCI', 'Eclipse', 'came', 'out', 'Werewolf', 'Shadow', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'soon']",N/A

496329,A16XRPF40679KG,B00000F0HH,Michael Dobey,"[3, 3]",the werewolf series of films that paul naschy did form 1968-2003is alot of fun and there are 12 of them.  this is one of the better ones and it's a mexican and spahish produced film with the lead female parts done by mexican actresses.  And that's a good thing.  The acting is fine but the transfer is choppy on this bci version.  It's like there are frames missing from the print. I also have the werewolf shadow dvd from this company and it's not choppy or at least not so noticable.  I don't know what happened by it is a defect that bci should do something about.  I hope that someone gets out the rest of the series as well because this is vintage werewolf mania that is directly related in makeup style to the classic wolfman movies from universal. I think Naschy did a great job this time around with his tormented lead character that only a woman who loves him can save him from the curse.  The title refers to the curse that is put upon his family line and not that the werewolf is a devil.  If you love vintage horror that was done by people who tried to make a decent flick then this may be for you.

To begin with, the story is actually pretty involving and the plot has some tricky forks in it at times.  The idea is very good:  an arrogant hero pays for that arrogance through a satanic curse, which seemingly is unbeatable.  Unfortunately, you have to make the mother of all suspensions of belief to deal with the actual werewolf.  Naschy just wasn't suited (bad pun!) for the job.  When you do have close-ups of the creature, there just isn't any menace conveyed-merely a frozen make-up expression.  When he attacks, it is almost comedic as, for most of the film, he quickly runs on screen and then off before the viewer has a chance to even register what has happened.  The opening sequence, if you're able to not laugh at what must be one of the lamest swordfight scenes ever filmed, is kinda cool with the way the pink tint conveys an otherworldly and othertimely atmosphere.  The gypsies in the beginning are very convincing in their vengeful rage.  All in all, it's not a bad movie.
