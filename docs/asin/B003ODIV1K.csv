1356191,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B003ODIV1K,Brad Baker,"[13, 13]","Warner Bros. has released the 1958 melodrama, ""Too Much, Too Soon"", the fiery biography of John Barrymore's daughter, Diana. ""Too Much, Too Soon"" was adapted from the autobiography of actress Diana Barrymore, played by Dorothy Malone. Diana suffers from lack of parental love. Her famous father, played with boozy bravado by Errol Flynn, is gracious when sober, but a monster when drunk. Her poetess mother, Michael Strange(Neva Patterson) is preoccupied by her bitterness against Barrymore. In one touching moment, Flynn as Barrymore calls-up his ex-wife, making love to her over the phone. ""Dear fig, I miss you"" he murmurs. Sadly, in a minute, he's simply talking to himself. In an eerie night sequence, Flynn as Barrymore spouts Shaekspeare and strolls the deck of his yacht, the Infanta(an actual boat owned by the actor). A search-light from a passing boat fixes on his profile. Filtered darkness blocks out the faces of the Hollywood partyers. ""Hey Jack, come on over. Join the party! Have a drink with us..""The partyers giggle and laugh and taunt the man on. Dinae Barrymore's eyes look longingly at the father she needs. He needs something else. With a laugh, a snort, and another drink, Barrymore slips and falls over the side. He swims over to his friends. His young daughter is in tears. ""Too Much, Too Soon"" is casually directed by Art Napoleon, who also co-wrote the screenplay. Several future television stars have supporting roles, including Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and Martin Milner. Uncredited in small parts are the great John Doucette, former Hollywood star Franklyn Farnum, and Flynn's 16-year-old girlfriend, Beverly Aadland. Flynn turns in a superb performance. His presence is electrifying. A stunning portrayal, the image of Flynn/Barrymore bantering drunkenly is pitiful and ridiculous. And deeply moving. In most respects, when Flynn leaves the film, the story grinds to a halt. This great role, and ""The Sun Also Rises(1957)"" re-energized the career of Errol Flynn. But sadly, like his champion, his life-style came first. Flynn died just one year later, at age 50.

1356193,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B003ODIV1K,Doug Erlandson,"[2, 2]","Judging from the number of reviews, ""Too Much Too Soon"" is not a widely watched film anymore. This is a shame. For it is a decent film and is a classic. Moreover, it tells the story of two members of the Barrymore family, a family still prominent in show business.Although billed as the story of Diana Barrymore (played by Dorothy Malone), it is as much a story of her father, played by the late Errol Flynn, one of the outstanding actors of all time. Flynn gives an outstanding performance as John Barrymore, Diana's father. A loving man when sober, he is often drunk. And when drunk he ignores his daughter, who feels unloved.Because she is the daughter of a famous actor, it is expected that Diana too will become a star. While still in her teens she begins receiving roles in movies. However, her limited acting skills and her finding solace in the bottle keeps her career from taking off. And by the time she is in her late 20's she is already a has-been. A series of failed marriages and relationships ensue, Eventually she squanders her money and becomes indigent.The movie ends on an upbeat note, with the expectation that Diana is about to get help for her alcoholism. Would that this had happened in real life. The movie was released in 1958. Two years later Diana was dead at age 30. As for Errol Flynn, whose performance clearly overshadows that of Malone, like the character he portrayed, in real life he was an alcoholic and was dead one year after the release of this film at age fifty.",4,A classic from another era,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,1501,"['Judging', 'number', 'reviews', 'Too', 'Much', 'Too', 'Soon', 'not', 'widely', 'watched', 'film', 'anymore', 'shame', 'decent', 'film', 'classic', 'Moreover', 'story', 'two', 'members', 'Barrymore', 'family', 'family', 'still', 'prominent', 'show', 'business.Although', 'billed', 'story', 'Diana', 'Barrymore', 'played', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'father', 'played', 'late', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'one', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'time', 'Flynn', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'Diana', 'father', 'loving', 'man', 'when', 'sober', 'often', 'drunk', 'when', 'drunk', 'daughter', 'who', 'daughter', 'famous', 'actor', 'expected', 'Diana', 'too', 'will', 'become', 'star', 'still', 'teens', 'receiving', 'roles', 'movies', 'However', 'limited', 'acting', 'skills', 'finding', 'solace', 'bottle', 'career', 'taking', 'off', 'time', 'late', '20', 'already', 'has-been', 'series', 'failed', 'marriages', 'relationships', 'ensue', 'Eventually', 'money', 'indigent.The', 'movie', 'upbeat', 'note', 'expectation', 'Diana', 'get', 'help', 'alcoholism', 'Would', 'had', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1958', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'Diana', 'was', 'dead', 'age', '30', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'performance', 'clearly', 'Malone', 'character', 'portrayed', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'was', 'dead', 'one', 'year', 'release', 'film', 'age', 'fifty']","Too Much, Too Soon"

Sure, it's a little preachy, and many of the performances are a little amatuerish (sorry, Dorothy Malone, but it's true), and it's loaded with many stock actors from the 50's/60's shlock melodramas.  However, what it DOES have is a fantastic performance by Errol Flynn, in one of his last roles.He plays John Barrymore, who happened to be a close friend of Flynn's in real life.  In his late 40's when he made this film, he looked so much older, not unlike his pal Barrymore. Flynn plays his part with such ferocity, such pathos and a great deal of sadness as well. I also find it remarkable how similar the personal lives of Flynn and Barrymore were.  Although Flynn was regarded more as a playboy, both he and Barrymore had very messy personal lives, scandals here and there and problems with alcohol.  Flynn's performance could have been an over-the-top caricature, but it is nuanced and portrays the heartbreak and desperation of someone in the throes of addiction, who knows he is dying.Dorothy Malone's portrayal of daughter, Diana Barrymore, is okay, but not too subtle.  Also, the parts with her as a teenager were just not believable.  I liked Dorothy Malone and she later grew into a better actress.All being said, Too Much Too Soon is a very entertaining movie and one often overlooked.  If you love 50's melodramas, this is for you.  If you enjoy a good story, this one is for you.  Most of all, if you love Errol Flynn, this one is certainly for you.",5,Watch it for Errol Flynn,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,1589,"['Finally', 'dvd', 'film', 'first', 'saw', 'late', 'show', 'kid', 'Rarely', 'shown', 'tv', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'Sure', 'little', 'preachy', 'many', 'performances', 'are', 'little', 'amatuerish', 'sorry', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'true', 'loaded', 'many', 'stock', 'actors', ""50's/60"", 'shlock', 'melodramas', 'However', 'what', 'DOES', 'have', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'one', 'last', 'roles.He', 'plays', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'close', 'friend', 'Flynn', 'real', 'life', 'late', '40', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'looked', 'so', 'much', 'older', 'not', 'pal', 'Barrymore', 'Flynn', 'part', 'such', 'ferocity', 'such', 'pathos', 'great', 'deal', 'sadness', 'well', 'also', 'find', 'remarkable', 'how', 'similar', 'personal', 'lives', 'Flynn', 'Barrymore', 'were', 'Flynn', 'was', 'regarded', 'more', 'playboy', 'Barrymore', 'had', 'very', 'messy', 'personal', 'lives', 'scandals', 'here', 'there', 'problems', 'alcohol', 'Flynn', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'over-the-top', 'caricature', 'nuanced', 'heartbreak', 'desperation', 'someone', 'throes', 'addiction', 'who', 'dying.Dorothy', 'Malone', 'portrayal', 'daughter', 'Diana', 'Barrymore', 'okay', 'not', 'too', 'subtle', 'Also', 'parts', 'teenager', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'liked', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'later', 'grew', 'better', 'actress.All', 'being', 'said', 'Too', 'Much', 'Too', 'Soon', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'one', 'often', 'overlooked', 'love', '50', 'melodramas', 'enjoy', 'good', 'story', 'one', 'Most', 'love', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'one', 'certainly']","Too Much, Too Soon"

He still had good films in him though and if he'd lived longer would have made more great films like this maybe. Irony is the heart of this story, because it's about the perils of living a partying lifestyle and then Flynn dies at fifty worn out by just that. The movie is a powerful one and few titles of a movie were ever more apt than this one. I only wish Diana had learned from this flick and turned it around. She'd at least have lived a few decades more. better to go at 58 than when you are still young.  This is  a classic movie and the dvd looks pretty good.

Movie shows how Dianna Barrymore feels starve for her father's love. Errol Flynn gives one of his best last performances as his dear friend John. Flynn proves he could have many more great performances in later years. However, he had only a year left to live after this movie. Movie becomes out of balance after Flynn's character John Barrymore dies in the middle of the movie. Although I have much admiration for Dorothy Malone, in this movie she doesn't reach her skills as an actress like she did in ""Written on the Wind."" Dorothy looks young as Flynn's daughter in the opening sequence but her acting ability as the little girl is corny. Dorothy does much better at the party sequence, when she is seduced by Ray Danton, who goes from good boy from ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" to a brute. Dorothy as Diana continues to drink and disappoints her mother, played by Neva Patterson. Neva was the warden in the classic Charlie's Angel's episode, ""Angels in Chains,"" who tries to turn the angels into prostitutes. Neva gives an effective performance, so does Efren Zimbalist Jr. as Dianna's first husband. There is unintentional humor when Dorothy wears heavy makeup and looks like Baby Jane Hudson at a strip club, where she is giving imitations of movie stars. She impersonates Garbo but is real funny trying to impersonate Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn was still living at the time. The ending has a touching scene Between Dorothy Malone and Martin Milner, Dianna's first boyfriend. Movie loses effectiveness as a comeback story from alcoholism because Dianna Barrymore commits suicide two years later from drugs and alcohol. Movie echoes Lillian Roth's ""I'll Cry Tomorrow,"" but not near as good. Who can beat Susan Hayward's performance as Roth? It is worth having in your collection because of Errol Flynn and Dorothy at least keeps your interest.

While there is small reference to her career as an actress, the focus of the film, ""Too Much Too Soon"" is more towards Barrymore's personal life.Diana Barrymore was born in 1921, the daughter of film legend John Barrymore and the writer Blanche Oelrichs.  She died in 1960, at age 38.Although there are a few minutes at the beginning of ""Too Much Too Soon"" devoted to her teenage years, the film really picks up around the time Diana is 19 and on Broadway.  As a result of her Broadway stint, the powers that be in Hollywood decide to make her a series of offers in order to cash in on the Barrymore name.In January 1942, Diana leaves the stage for Hollywood and in short order, takes on her husband number one (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) without much ado.  Things are rosy for a while, but Diana's drinking problem gets in the way and it's all downhill from there.  A few years later at age 23, even Diana reportedly considered her acting carrer as being a washout.So much of her journey was detoured due to alcoholism, poor decisions and failure to reconcile personal weaknesses.  Diana's life becomes a nightmarish landscape which ultimately results in her crash landing in a rehab institution.""Too Much, Too Soon"" is a Hollywood classic. It has held up extremely well since its realease over fifty years ago.  First released to movie audiences in 1958 this Warner Brother release was directed by Art Napoleon.  The screenplay was based on Diana's autobiography written by Diana Barrymore and Gerold Frank. The music score was by Ernest Gold.The film stars Dorothy Malone and Errol Flynn with Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Ray Danton, Neva Patterson, Murray Hamilton and Martin Milner.Although he gets second billing, Errol Flynn ""...steals the show as John Barrymore,"" according to the package liner notes attributed to film critic Leonard Maltin.  However, it's very strange to see Flynn portray his old pal John Barrymore in a way that parallels Flynn's own life.  As compared with the dashing figure he cut in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and other swashbucklers, Flynn looks much older than his 50 years, a victim of his own lifestyle. Flynn died about a year after making this film.I first saw this film on television as a teenager.  However, to see this film in its entirety without commercial interuption was revealing.

It suffers from the usual clich&eacute;s of these movie bios but two performances redeem it. Errol Flynn inhabits John Barrymore like a second skin, one can't help but connect the dots between the lives of the two actors. But it's Dorothy Malone as Diana Barrymore who carries the burden of the film on her shoulders and does it spectacularly. She's weak in the beginning but that's only because it's obvious the 30ish Malone is too old to play the 16 year old school girl that Diana was but once she enters into adulthood, Malone is sensational. Whether drunkenly doing a strip in Baby Jane make up at a dive or her pathetic embarrassment at begging a stranger for money only to find it's an old boyfriend, Malone brings a pathos to her debauchery.

1356200,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B003ODIV1K,The Mysterious Traveler,"[4, 5]","TOO MUCH, TOO SOON (1958) Directed and written by Art Napoleon. Based on the book by Diana Barrymore. Director of Photography Nicholas Musuraca.Starring Dorothy Malone(as Diana Barrymore), Efrem Zimbalest Jr, Ray Danton, Murray Hamilton, Martin Milner, John Doucette and Erroll Flynn as John Barrymore.The biofilm of Diana Barrymore--the daughter of noted author Michael Strange and the great actor John Barrymore---who, because of emotional neglect by her parents, went through a series of failed marriages and became an alcoholic. The film also covers the final incredibly tragic years of her father John who drank himself into the grave.The film ends with the upbeat note that Diana is about to get her life together but, in reality, two years later she committed suicide at the age of 39. Diana Barrymore was the aunt of Drew Barrymore and is buried in the Bronx.One of those seemingly endless series of 50s era films whose main reason for existence seemed be to show people sitting in darkened rooms being miserable. Incredibly depressing one cannot say that it is badly done or badly acted. It is not badly done at all and it is very well acted but watching it is the equivalent of using a manual drill to bore into your skull. One wants to run out into the street and throw one's self in front of a truck. I simply do not understand the purpose for films like these.However Malone is excellent as Diana as is Danton as her slimy tennis player second husband. JAWS star Hamilton is surprisingly sympathetic as a Hollywood producer. The film's main claim to fame, trivia question and eerie frisson status is Flynn as John Barrymore. Flynn---due to nastiness by Bette Davis--has a reputation as being a poor actor and just a pretty face. Obviously this was never true and if there was any doubt, his performance here to put paid to that idea. Flynn is excellent........as well he should be since not only was he a drinking buddy of Barrymore but he was in the process of drinking himself into the ground as well dying soon after this film was made. Flynn manages the very difficult feat of capturing the essence of the man without falling into the trap of impersonation. He is Barrymore.......subtly and his performance is probably the best reason to see the film........but I must confess that after his corpse is rolled out on a gurney I was sorely tempted to turn the film off.................A good movie technically but I can think of no reason.......save for Flynn's performance.....to put one's self through it.",2,Well THAT was cheerful!!,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,2522,"['TOO', 'MUCH', 'TOO', 'SOON', '1958', 'Directed', 'written', 'Art', 'Napoleon', 'Based', 'book', 'Diana', 'Barrymore', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Nicholas', 'Musuraca.Starring', 'Dorothy', 'Malone', 'Diana', 'Barrymore', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalest', 'Jr', 'Ray', 'Danton', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'John', 'Doucette', 'Erroll', 'Flynn', 'John', 'Barrymore.The', 'biofilm', 'Diana', 'Barrymore', 'daughter', 'noted', 'author', 'Michael', 'Strange', 'great', 'actor', 'John', 'Barrymore', '-who', 'emotional', 'neglect', 'parents', 'went', 'series', 'failed', 'marriages', 'became', 'alcoholic', 'film', 'also', 'final', 'incredibly', 'tragic', 'years', 'father', 'John', 'who', 'drank', 'grave.The', 'film', 'upbeat', 'note', 'Diana', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'reality', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'committed', 'suicide', 'age', '39', 'Diana', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'aunt', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'buried', 'Bronx.One', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'series', '50s', 'era', 'films', 'main', 'reason', 'existence', 'seemed', 'be', 'show', 'people', 'sitting', 'darkened', 'rooms', 'being', 'miserable', 'Incredibly', 'depressing', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'badly', 'done', 'badly', 'acted', 'not', 'badly', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'watching', 'equivalent', 'using', 'manual', 'drill', 'bore', 'skull', 'One', 'run', 'out', 'street', 'throw', 'one', 'self', 'front', 'truck', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'purpose', 'films', 'these.However', 'Malone', 'excellent', 'as', 'Diana', 'Danton', 'slimy', 'tennis', 'player', 'second', 'husband', 'JAWS', 'star', 'Hamilton', 'surprisingly', 'sympathetic', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'film', 'main', 'claim', 'fame', 'trivia', 'question', 'eerie', 'frisson', 'status', 'Flynn', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'Flynn', '-due', 'nastiness', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'reputation', 'being', 'poor', 'actor', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'Obviously', 'was', 'never', 'true', 'was', 'doubt', 'performance', 'here', 'put', 'paid', 'idea', 'Flynn', 'excellent', '..as', 'well', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'drinking', 'buddy', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'process', 'drinking', 'ground', 'as', 'well', 'dying', 'soon', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Flynn', 'very', 'difficult', 'feat', 'capturing', 'essence', 'man', 'falling', 'trap', 'impersonation', 'Barrymore', '.subtly', 'performance', 'probably', 'best', 'reason', 'see', 'film', '..but', 'must', 'confess', 'corpse', 'rolled', 'out', 'gurney', 'was', 'sorely', 'tempted', 'turn', 'film', '..A', 'good', 'movie', 'technically', 'can', 'think', 'reason', '.save', 'Flynn', 'performance', 'put', 'one']","Too Much, Too Soon"
