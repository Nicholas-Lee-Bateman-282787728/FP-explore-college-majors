I am a big fan of this tape because 1. Its Got the ANIMAL SONG!!  2. ROBIN WILLIAMS dressed as Andy's Grandmother (wonder about Mrs. Doubtfire)  3. The SHOCKING OLD LADY HEART ATTACK SCENE!! 4. The behind the scenes documentary after the show is over! It tells you why Andy really Wrestled Women (keep it a secret) and much more.

549663,AZZ2DEE2NTIM7,B00004SPY8,Richard Kaplan,"[6, 6]","It was late April 1979 that Andy played Carnegie Hall and I had the pleasure of witnessing one of the most unique evenings I ever spent. I didnt even realize the video existed until I did a Kaufman search on Amazon. To watch it last year brought back lots of memories. Earlier watching the ""Man on the Moon"" movie,that too brought a lot of it back.I ve been a fan of Andys since I saw him on a 1976 Dick Van Dyke series. I was always amazed how far he would go to entertain  and do his shtick. Nobody was like Andy Kaufman I remember Judd Hirsch,Marilu Henner and Danny Devito were in the audience that night and the electricity in the air was amazing. When Andy annouced there were 20 busses waiting for us outside to take us for milk and cookies,we all assumed it was another elaborate joke,butsure enough the busses were waiting for us to bring us to I think a local school where we munched on Famous Amos cookies and half pints of milk and Andy did a magic show. He announced then that the show would continue on the Staten IslandFerry the next day  I couldn t make that,but he was there.It's hard to believe that concert took place 25 years ago. If you remember the concert scene in the movie it was supposed to occur in 1983 about six months before his death.Liberties were taken with the film,obviously,but the concert was held when Andys career was at its peak..the first year of Taxi and his shows always selling out.",5,25 years ago and I was there,1080345600,"03 27, 2004",2004,1426,"['was', 'late', 'April', '1979', 'Andy', 'played', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'had', 'pleasure', 'witnessing', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'evenings', 'ever', 'spent', 'didnt', 'even', 'realize', 'video', 'existed', 'did', 'Kaufman', 'search', 'Amazon', 'watch', 'last', 'year', 'brought', 'back', 'lots', 'memories', 'Earlier', 'watching', 'Man', 'Moon', 'movie', 'too', 'brought', 'lot', 've', 'been', 'fan', 'Andys', 'saw', '1976', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'series', 'was', 'always', 'amazed', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'entertain', 'do', 'shtick', 'Nobody', 'was', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'remember', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Marilu', 'Henner', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'were', 'audience', 'night', 'electricity', 'air', 'was', 'amazing', 'When', 'Andy', 'annouced', 'were', '20', 'busses', 'waiting', 'outside', 'take', 'milk', 'cookies', 'assumed', 'was', 'elaborate', 'joke', 'butsure', 'busses', 'were', 'waiting', 'bring', 'think', 'local', 'school', 'where', 'munched', 'Famous', 'Amos', 'cookies', 'half', 'pints', 'milk', 'Andy', 'did', 'magic', 'show', 'announced', 'then', 'show', 'would', 'continue', 'Staten', 'IslandFerry', 'next', 'day', 'couldn', 't', 'make', 'was', 'hard', 'believe', 'concert', 'took', 'place', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'remember', 'concert', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'occur', '1983', 'six', 'months', 'death.Liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'film', 'obviously', 'concert', 'was', 'held', 'when', 'Andys', 'career', 'was', 'peak..the', 'first', 'year', 'Taxi', 'shows', 'always', 'selling', 'out']",N/A
549664,AV1Q265VNCDVX,B00004SPY8,William M. Jones,"[2, 2]","It has been said that Andy Kaufman was one of those one in a billion people that could sing &quot;100 bottles of beer on the wall&quot; and  leave the audience rolling in the ailes and rejoicing in their seats--with  just one bottle of beer left!  A good example of Andy's special ability is  manifest in his second number at Caragie Hall-after Tony Clifton's singing  of the &quot;National Anthem&quot; of course.  He comes out on the stage  and bows to the audience and then proceeds to hop around to the melody of  Oklahoma.  Andy intentionally flubs his lines, sings out of tune and reacts  off-beat to the melody.  Later on in the number, he demonstrated that he  could indeed dance.  Besides being talented however, Andy's courage and  experimentation easily erased divisions between himself and the  audience-and that is the point! He did so to the admiration and dismay of  his peers and of his fellow comics, and did so without appearing  pretentious or having to act cynical.  As it is the nature of  &quot;entertainers&quot; and &quot;comics&quot; to create a popular  character for their fans and audience, Andy created for them both a good  innocent man (foreign man) and the bad guy night-club entertainer (Tony  Clifton).  Both characters together created &quot;entertainment&quot;  value.",5,What is Entertainment?,966643200,"08 19, 2000",2000,1304,"['been', 'said', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'was', 'one', 'one', 'billion', 'people', 'could', 'sing', 'quot', '100', 'bottles', 'beer', 'wall', 'quot', 'leave', 'audience', 'rolling', 'ailes', 'rejoicing', 'seats', 'just', 'one', 'bottle', 'beer', 'left', 'good', 'example', 'Andy', 'special', 'ability', 'manifest', 'second', 'number', 'Caragie', 'Hall-after', 'Tony', 'Clifton', 'singing', 'quot', 'National', 'Anthem', 'quot', 'course', 'out', 'stage', 'audience', 'then', 'proceeds', 'hop', 'melody', 'Oklahoma', 'Andy', 'intentionally', 'flubs', 'lines', 'sings', 'tune', 'off-beat', 'melody', 'Later', 'number', 'demonstrated', 'could', 'indeed', 'dance', 'being', 'talented', 'however', 'Andy', 'courage', 'experimentation', 'easily', 'erased', 'divisions', 'audience-and', 'point', 'did', 'so', 'admiration', 'dismay', 'peers', 'fellow', 'comics', 'did', 'so', 'appearing', 'pretentious', 'having', 'act', 'cynical', 'nature', 'quot', 'entertainers', 'quot', 'quot', 'comics', 'quot', 'create', 'popular', 'character', 'fans', 'audience', 'Andy', 'created', 'good', 'innocent', 'man', 'foreign', 'man', 'bad', 'guy', 'night-club', 'entertainer', 'Tony', 'Clifton', 'characters', 'together', 'created', 'quot', 'entertainment', 'quot', 'value']",N/A
