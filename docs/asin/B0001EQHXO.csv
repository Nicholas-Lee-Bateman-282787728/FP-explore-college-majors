802704,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B0001EQHXO,,"[5, 5]","All of the episodes are included here with the original music, many of them with commentaries.  Deleted scenes with commentary, behind the scenes footage, bloopers, and a great booklet with liner notes by the creator.  To tell you what the series is, why I think it's great, and also why I think it didn't succeed.  The series is set in the 1970's Michigan high school and deals with the burnouts and the geeks.  The so-called main characters are two children from the Weir family.  The older daughter Lyndsay is a brain, but is attracted to the burnouts and the younger Sam is an undeniable geek although he does have a certain charm.  This series identifies with these groups and unjudgmentally presents them in these tempestuous times (time, because the series was canceled) of their lives.  What's great about this show is that it isn't really concerned with the popular kids because we already know all about them and since the impetus for the show was actual personal experience the performances are very authentic and without the commercial sheen of a show trying to push a certain lifestyle full of products to help one sustain beauty, coolness, etc.  The reason this show didn't succeed is because the earnestness didn't allow the show to be easily marketed. It wasn't a comedy, but it definitely had some funny moments and you couldn't exactly say it was a drama because it wouldn't be popular with the kids who love popular and commercial depictions of all youth groups.  Worst of all, it isn't melodramatic which is what mainstream America loves. Unfortunately, the promos on the network underlined the humor and so the casual viewer would be disappointed because they were expecting a comedy.  The people who truly gave the show a chance and understood it's genius have loved from day one.  Personally, I only saw bits and pieces of this series on TV because my parents fell into the first group and never gave this series a chance, and they had their show on at the same time.  What I did see was very good to me.""Freaks and Geeks"" is far more successful than another flashback series about growing up ""The Wonder Years"" because it isn't stooped in just one character and doesn't use a narrative to clarify its points. That this show doesn't have to use a narrative says a lot about the superior writing. One thing that blew me away while watching these episodes was the amazingly expensive soundtrack.  It really sets you into the time period while also letting you know that spent the movie wisely on just the right songs.  To me, the cast also has a great effect on the series.  The makers of the film were not afraid to make the most unorthodox, yet perfect casting choices and applaud them for it.  I also applaud Shout Factory for shelling out the money to put out this set.  I hope that enough people buy this so that they don't go out of business, also so that other shows will have their original music released as was originally aired.  As I understand it that's a growing problem with shows being released on DVD.  So, I wholeheartedly recommend this to fans of "" The Wonder Years"" which is still a good show, but inferior in my opinion to this one, and shows that have the guts to show it like it is.",5,Great documentation of a short lived series,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,3226,"['episodes', 'are', 'included', 'here', 'original', 'music', 'many', 'commentaries', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'scenes', 'footage', 'bloopers', 'great', 'booklet', 'liner', 'notes', 'creator', 'tell', 'what', 'series', 'why', 'think', 'great', 'also', 'why', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'series', 'set', '1970', 'Michigan', 'high', 'school', 'deals', 'burnouts', 'geeks', 'so-called', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'two', 'children', 'Weir', 'family', 'older', 'daughter', 'Lyndsay', 'brain', 'attracted', 'burnouts', 'younger', 'Sam', 'undeniable', 'geek', 'have', 'certain', 'charm', 'series', 'groups', 'unjudgmentally', 'presents', 'tempestuous', 'times', 'time', 'series', 'was', 'canceled', 'lives', 'What', 'great', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'concerned', 'popular', 'kids', 'already', 'know', 'impetus', 'show', 'was', 'actual', 'personal', 'experience', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'authentic', 'commercial', 'sheen', 'show', 'trying', 'push', 'certain', 'lifestyle', 'full', 'products', 'help', 'one', 'sustain', 'beauty', 'coolness', 'etc', 'reason', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'earnestness', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'show', 'be', 'easily', 'marketed', 'was', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'definitely', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'could', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'say', 'was', 'drama', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'popular', 'kids', 'who', 'love', 'popular', 'commercial', 'depictions', 'youth', 'groups', 'Worst', ""n't"", 'melodramatic', 'what', 'mainstream', 'America', 'Unfortunately', 'promos', 'network', 'underlined', 'humor', 'so', 'casual', 'viewer', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'were', 'expecting', 'comedy', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'gave', 'show', 'chance', 'understood', 'genius', 'have', 'loved', 'day', 'one', 'Personally', 'only', 'saw', 'bits', 'pieces', 'series', 'TV', 'parents', 'fell', 'first', 'group', 'never', 'gave', 'series', 'chance', 'had', 'show', 'same', 'time', 'What', 'did', 'see', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'flashback', 'series', 'growing', 'up', 'Wonder', 'Years', ""n't"", 'stooped', 'just', 'one', 'character', ""n't"", 'use', 'narrative', 'clarify', 'points', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'use', 'narrative', 'lot', 'superior', 'writing', 'One', 'thing', 'blew', 'away', 'watching', 'episodes', 'was', 'amazingly', 'expensive', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'time', 'period', 'also', 'letting', 'know', 'spent', 'movie', 'wisely', 'just', 'right', 'songs', 'cast', 'also', 'great', 'effect', 'series', 'makers', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'afraid', 'make', 'most', 'unorthodox', 'yet', 'perfect', 'casting', 'choices', 'applaud', 'also', 'applaud', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'shelling', 'out', 'money', 'put', 'out', 'set', 'hope', 'enough', 'people', 'buy', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'business', 'also', 'so', 'other', 'shows', 'will', 'have', 'original', 'music', 'released', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'understand', 'growing', 'problem', 'shows', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'So', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'still', 'good', 'show', 'inferior', 'opinion', 'one', 'have', 'guts', 'show']",N/A

From the clothes and fashion (even Sam's jumpsuit!), to the popular music, all these little things were lovingly recreated to vividly bring that era back to life.The quality acting and well-written stories natually resulted in the development of interesting and complex characters.  How did Lindsay Weir, one of the smartest students in school, get drawn to the freaks?  How did her relationship with her friend Millie change because of it?  Supporting character like Bill Haverchuk, and especially smart aleck freak Ken seemed to add depth to their character with each subsequent episode.  Watching the stories unfold was pure joy.Freaks and Geeks exuded a warmth and humanness sorely lacking from shows today.  I've grown so sick of this tiresome sitcom storyline:  a main character lies about something, tries in vain to cover it up, and in the end has everything blow up in his face.  Sound familiar?  You can see this theme over and over again in popular shows like Seinfeld, Frazier, and Friends.  Freaks and Geeks surpasses all these shows with its recurrent themes of friendship, trust, betrayal, and (not) fitting in with the popular crowd.

I mean some of the ideas are taken from other shows but they are done so well and you really really feel for everyone on the show. characters you didn't like in the begining are some of your favorites at the end, you see them evolve through out the series and if your lucky you find a little of yourself in the show. I don't think there is one character that reprents me but i see myself as about 85% Freak and 15% Geek.The whole hour holds your attention and it will make you smile! Its funny and warm hearted.

Granted, there are plenty of shows that are deservedly cancelled each year, but a few of my favorite shows were cancelled before they had a chance to reach an audience.  Firefly, Undeclared, Wonderfalls, all lasted less than a season, while Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Titus, and Arrested Development all got a few seasons, but were still ended too soon (I even consider Angel, which got five seasons, to have been cancelled to soon).  In my opinion, Firefly is the greatest show to ever last less than one season.  However, Freaks and Geeks is a very close second.  **MINOR SPOILERS BELOW**Created by Paul Feig and executive produced by Judd Apatow, who would later go on to create the pseudo-spinoff Undeclared and write The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Freaks and Geeks was the story of two groups of kids in a Michigan high school in 1980.  The freaks are the tough burnouts who enjoy rock and roll music, making fun of jocks, and smoking marijuana.  While they seem tough and jaded on the outside, many of them come from tough home lives and are very fragile kids.  The geeks, on the other hand, are into science fiction and comedy.  Their heroes range from Luke Skywalker and Captain Apollo of Battlestar Galactica to Bill Murray and Steve Martin.  Even though they can't seem to get girls and are attacked by bullies, they are usually fairly happy with themselves.The story revolves around the Weir family.  Older sister Lindsay (Linda Cardellini), who is an extremely intelligent girl who used to be very active in academic extracurricular activities, has recently gotten a new outlook on life following the death of her grandmother.  She now has lost a lot of her interest in school and hangs around with the freaks.  Her brother Sam (John Francis Daley) is a freshman and is a geek.  He hangs out with his two best friends everyday, while the trio discusses movies, girls, and Dungeons and Dragons.  Their parents, Jean (Becky Ann Baker) and Harold Weir (Joe Flaherty), love each other very much and care very much for their children, but they each have personalities that can sometimes alienate their kids.  Jean is a little too afraid to let go of her children, while Harold can be a little overbearing at times.The freaks include Daniel Desario (James Franco), an attractive guy who seems to be going nowhere in life, his girlfriend Kim Kelly (Busy Phillips), who could be mentally unbalanced and comes from a very broken home, Nick Andopolis (Jason Segel), a guy with a passion for drumming and marijuana, and Ken Miller (Seth Rogen), a sarcastic guy who tends to anger most people due to his unrelenting sarcasm.  The geeks include Neal Schweiber (Samm Levine) and Bill Haverchuck (Martin Starr).  Neal is a guy with a somewhat miscalculated self-image; he sees himself as the next Steve Martin even though he isn't as funny as he thinks he is.  Bill is very open; he always says what's on his mind, which often gets him into trouble.  Each of the characters is very well developed.  They are more than just two-dimensional cliches, and when they do things, we can always see what's driving them to do it.  But aside from the credited cast, there are tons of secondary characters who are just as developed as the credited cast.  Students like Millie Kentner (Sarah Hagen), a very religious girl who was friends with Lindsay when she was still a mathlete, Harris Trinsky (Stephen Lea Sheppard), a fellow geek who is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, and Cindy Sanders (Natasha Melnick), the girl that Sam has a crush on, all have their own distinct personalities and add a lot to the stories.  Meanwhile, the teachers at the school like Coach Ben Fredricks (Tom Wilson, who played Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future movies), math teacher Frank Kowchevski (Steve Bannos), and guidance counselor Jeff Rosso (Dave ""Gruber"" Allen) all help influence the students at the school in different ways.When Feig and Apatow got together to make this series, one of the things they talked about was how a lot of high school shows get it completely wrong and are all about the same group of people, the good-looking athletes.  Very few shows focus on the outcasts like the geeks, who tend to be at the brunt of jokes, or the freaks, who tend to be the subjects of negative rumors, while most shows have the characters experiencing happy endings that are very implausible.  For example, in one episode of Freaks and Geeks, two of the characters get together to help one cheat on a test.  When Mr. Kowchevski tries to get a confession out of them, he resorts to the following tactic: If the cheater can do one problem fromt the test in front of him, he will drop the charges and resign.  In most shows, the character would miraculously pull it off, but in Freaks and Geeks, he merely writes ""Zepplin Rules"" on the test and is forced to suffer the consequences.  I'm not saying that nothing good ever happens on this show, but that it isn't an idealized look at high school.  In fact, it is a very accurate portrayal of those four years of life.  I can actually identify with both groups to an extent, and many of the things that happen to the characters either happened to me or people I knew.  For example, I felt like the scene involving spin the bottle could have been taken out of my life (except for what later happened with Bill).While Freaks and Geeks is technically a drama, it is very hilarious.  The stories masterfully balance drama and comedy.  While many of the situations are very serious, they are dealt with in a way to make us laugh with the characters and not at them.  But when the moment calls for it, the show can be heartbreaking.  For example, in the episode ""Noshing and Moshing"", I have never seen a better use for a ventriloquist dummy.  It was hilarious what Neal did with it, but then on a dime, the show became dead serious, and at that moment, I really felt sorry for what some of the characters were going through.  Heavier topics like not being able to get the girl of your dreams, being forced to join the armed services if your grades don't improve, having information that could tear your family apart, and the consequences of drug use are all used very effectively used at some point on the show.  However, there were some very funny situations used, such as paying a friend to drink a mixture of nearly everything found in the kitchen, Halloween hijinx, and the ultimate use of the placebo effect when the geeks switch out a keg at a freaks party, and everyone gets drunk off of non-alcoholic beer (while Bill gets drunk off the real stuff).While some of the stories were, for all intents and purposes, wrapped up in these 18 episodes, such as an arc involving Sam and Cindy, there is so much more that could have happened to the supposedly finished storylines, while many other story arcs were only just beginning.  Both Neal and Bill were involved in separate stories that were only beginning at the end of the series, while the fallout of a choice Lindsay makes at the end of the series will never be resolved.  Furthermore, most of the other freaks were also at turning points in their lives.  Who knows what will happen to Nick after taking up disco or if Daniel will remain friends with Sam and company after a very hilarious scene that I won't spoil for you.  There are so many things left unresolved, as well as tons of potential for stories that could have happened in upcoming seasons.Sadly, due to viewer apathy and the emergence of reality television (I think Survivor started shortly after Freaks and Geeks did), we'll never get any more of this wonderful show.  However, this DVD set, while born out of tragedy, is a great tribute to the show.  In addition to the 18 episodes, there are tons of extras, including cast auditions, blooper reels, and over 25 commentary tracks!  Yes, there are more commentaries than there are episodes, which is nearly unheard of.  Some episodes have multiple commentaries, and everyone (and I mean everyone!) takes part.  From creators and crew tracks to cast tracks, nearly everybody gets on at least one track.  In addition to the regulars, many of the supporting cast members are included, and even some of the actors' parents (I'm not kidding!) accompany their kids.  Remember that when this show was filmed, John Francis Daley really was the age of a high school freshman.  Not only are there a ton of extras, but all of the show's music made it onto the DVD, which is really saying something.  Every episode features multiple songs from the 70's and early 80's from acclaimed musicians and bands such as Billy Joel, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Bob Seger, Warren Zevon, Led Zepplin, and Styx.  Also, the show's theme is the very appropriately chosen ""Bad Reputation"" by Joan Jett.  How the DVD producers got the rights to all the songs, I will never know.There are very few things that I'd reccomend buying ""blind"", but this is one of them (while you're out there, also pick up Firefly and Undeclared).  Freaks and Geeks is a terrific show that wasn't afraid to tell it like it was.  It is one of the most real and best portrayals of high school life ever to grace the television screen.  As I said at the beginning of the review, there are plenty of cancelled shows that I like, but I can also understand why some of them were cancelled; a few had somewhat quirky premises, and finding an audience may have been a little tough.  I cannot see how this show could not have gotten a strong audience, and its cancellation is truly a crime against television.  Buy this set.  You will not regret it.",5,High School Life The Way It Was Makes For One of Television's Finest Shows,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,9652,"['Why', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'TV', 'shows', 'die',

If you guys released this, ALL the great classic music in this series would have been taken out.  Fox and Paramount have ruined recent sets without the original music, particularly WKRP, Happy Days, etc.  Granted, this short-lived gem is far better than those shows in terms of writing and character development.  But sets with replaced music has gotten old and apparently nothing is going to be done about it.  The set goes to prove that Shout Factory really cares what fans want in a DVD release of a TV show.  This is the same label that is responsible for the great Dick Cavett releases.  Imagine Freaks and Geeks without the music.  The only thing that would be left is the closing credits.  Every episode not only has great music, but has references to classic songs and bands, posters, T-shirts, even Millie singing Jesus Is Just Alright.  All that had to be paid for.  Fox or Paramount wouldn't have paid a dime for it either.  This review is a message to companies that release TV shows with generic music.  Shell out the money and do it right!!  For the fans' sake.

Cameo performances are also a joy, including Joel Hodgson and Trace Beaulieu from MST3K fame and Jason Schwartzmann to name a few.

802721,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0001EQHXO,Benjamin,"[5, 6]","This DVD set, featuring every episode ever made of ""Freaks and Geeks"" including those never aired by NBC during its sole season, is the best way to spend a spare Saturday afternoon after a particularly tough week of work and adult-life minutae and garbage. It will cheer you up, make you both nostalgic for high school and happy that you never have to go through it again. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. And every character in the series will, at one point (for every character got at least one key episode), remind you of an aspect of yourself - a part you like or a part you hate. And when your spare ""Freaks and Geeks"" Saturday comes to an end, you'll feel better. Much better.Sam and Lindsay Weir are on different rungs at the bottom of the high school social ladder in 1981. Sam's too short, too wiry, too awkward and has seen ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Caddyshack"" way too many times. Lindsay thinks too much, mopes too much and is going through an identity crisis that involves abandoning the ""Mathletes"" to hang out under the bleachers with stoners, analyzing her grandmother's death and wearing her dad's old Army jacket to school every day.The show chronicles how they and their friends cope with high school and adolescence. But it's also about how cool they are by NOT fitting in with the popular kids and by being themselves. No episodes of the show have pat happy endings. There are upsides, downsides, compromises, heroes, villains. But nothing is ever clear-cut or easy for these characters or for the audience watching them.The characters in ""Freaks and Geeks"" are so well-drawn they feel like your real friends. My personal favorite is, of course, the ""Dallas""-worshipping, allergic-to-everything ""geek"" Bill Haverchuck, played brilliantly by the hilarious Martin Starr.Bill's scenes in the Halloween episode - featuring him in costume as the Bionic Woman - are worth the price of the DVD box set.The DVD is jam-packed with extras, including all the original music from the episodes, commentary tracks on every episode, deleted scenes and audition footage from the cast.This is a must-have.",5,I worship Bill Haverchuck.,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,2127,"['DVD', 'set', 'featuring', 'episode', 'ever', 'made', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'including', 'never', 'aired', 'NBC', 'sole', 'season', 'best', 'way', 'spend', 'spare', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'particularly', 'tough', 'week', 'work', 'adult-life', 'minutae', 'garbage', 'will', 'cheer', 'up', 'make', 'nostalgic', 'high', 'school', 'happy', 'never', 'have', 'go', 'again', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'character', 'series', 'will', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'got', 'least', 'one', 'key', 'episode', 'remind', 'aspect', 'part', 'like', 'part', 'hate', 'when', 'spare', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'Saturday', 'end', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'better', 'Much', 'better.Sam', 'Lindsay', 'Weir', 'are', 'different', 'rungs', 'bottom', 'high', 'school', 'social', 'ladder', '1981', 'Sam', 'too', 'short', 'too', 'wiry', 'too', 'awkward', 'seen', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'Caddyshack', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Lindsay', 'too', 'much', 'mopes', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'identity', 'crisis', 'abandoning', 'Mathletes', 'hang', 'out', 'bleachers', 'stoners', 'analyzing', 'grandmother', 'death', 'wearing', 'dad', 'old', 'Army', 'jacket', 'school', 'day.The', 'show', 'how', 'friends', 'cope', 'high', 'school', 'adolescence', 'also', 'how', 'cool', 'are', 'NOT', 'fitting', 'popular', 'kids', 'being', 'episodes', 'show', 'have', 'pat', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', 'upsides', 'downsides', 'compromises', 'heroes', 'villains', 'nothing', 'ever', 'clear-cut', 'easy', 'characters', 'audience', 'watching', 'them.The', 'characters', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'are', 'so', 'well-drawn', 'feel', 'real', 'friends', 'personal', 'favorite', 'course', 'Dallas', '-worshipping', 'allergic-to-everything', 'geek', 'Bill', 'Haverchuck', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'hilarious', 'Martin', 'Starr.Bill', 'scenes', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'featuring', 'costume', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'are', 'price', 'DVD', 'box', 'set.The', 'DVD', 'jam-packed', 'extras', 'including', 'original', 'music', 'episodes', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'episode', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audition', 'footage', 'cast.This', 'must-have']",N/A

Still, I am compelled to praise this excellent show that NBC eventually passed on...the fools.Other shows have tried but most have failed in portraying a realistic high school setting. A few succeeded, their was ""Room 222"" an excellent show that remarkably still holds up today.  Sara Jessica Parker was never cuter than she was in ""Square Pegs"", another short live show similar in theme to ""Freaks"". ""DeGassi"", a Canadian import, was also quite good in exhibiting the trials and tribulations of high school life. That's pretty much it. Others like ""90201"", ""Saved by the Bell"", ""A Different World"", ""That's so Raven"", ""Boy Meets World"", the ""O.C."" and on and on and on all need to bow in respect to ""Freaks"". Granted each show has it's own agenda and it's own audience but it kills me that these shows succeeded where in ""Freaks and Geeks"" didn't. It' not ""The O.C.s"" fault that ""Freaks"" got canceled and ""The O.C.s"" not a terrible show, but it doesn't elevate you like ""Freaks"" does.See, ""Freaks and Geeks"" is a show about underdogs and outsiders.  The first shot of the first show sums it up best. We start in on a jock and his girl friend exchanging cow eyes in the football stands as sweet music fills the scene, then the camera tilts down to under the bleachers. The music turns hard as kids with wild hair and sloppy clothes exchange words and cigarette butts. The scene says it all.  This isn't about the prom king or queen, it's a show about the rest of us.",5,How Many 5 Stars Reviews Do You Need?

802727,A1ELVOQTTWNLJ1,B0001EQHXO,Cameron Johnson,"[2, 4]","Considering how much I've come to despise Judd Apatow as a creator, director and producer, he was a force to be reckoned with in his early days. Freaks and Geeks is a pretty great show, and I recommend it to anyone. From beginning to end, there is very little to dislike about this show.The DVD set is chock full of commentary, by almost everyone involved in the show. If you're into that, you'll learn so much more about Freaks and Geeks then you ever thought possible.UPCOMING SPOILER ALERTSAs far as the show itself - SPOILER ALERT: (Maybe) - does anyone else know why Busy Philipps isn't included in the main cast? You've got every geek and every freak, but where is Kim Kelly, Daniel's angry girlfriend and Lindsay's (eventual) close friend? She's in every single episode, she's pivotal to many storylines, and has her own backstory and evolution just like all the other characters. I would say that Kim Kelly is a more fully evolved character than both Ken (Seth Rogen) or Bill Haverchuck (Martin Starr) but they are both ""main"" characters, both included in the cast photography on the box and part of the opening theme. It seems strange that there are two fully developed female characters in the show, ostensibly as main characters, but only one (Linda Cardellini) is an official ""main"" character. The others are all male, giving this odd lopsided perspective that there were just more boys than girls in high schools.MORE SPOILER ALERTS: This is an unfortunate pattern in all of Apatow's productions to treat it like a ""no girls allowed"" universe. I also think it's interesting that of the freaks, geeks, stoners, etc, the majority of the ""weird"" characters are male, while almost all of the female (high school) characters in the show are cheerleaders and/or hot and popular. Girls are mostly invisible in this show, and portrayed (mostly) as untouchable ""goddesses"" on pedestals. There's Lindsay and Kim, of course, as well as Lindsay's nerdy friend Millie, but most of the high school girls we see are cheerleaders. Isn't that odd? Even Lindsay is given the pedestal treatment by Nick, which destroys what could otherwise be a perfectly healthy high school relationship.Okay, so I have criticisms of the show, obviously. But I stand by my 5 stars because, despite it's flaws, Freaks and Geeks is an amazing show with powerfully developed characters. It's all the more impressive because it only lasted one, 18-episode season.",5,The Early Days of Judd Apatow,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,2437,"['Considering', 'how', 'much', ""'ve"", 'come', 'despise', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'creator', 'director', 'producer', 'was', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'early', 'days', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'pretty', 'great', 'show', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'beginning', 'end', 'very', 'little', 'dislike', 'show.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'chock', 'full', 'commentary', 'almost', 'everyone', 'involved', 'show', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'then', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible.UPCOMING', 'SPOILER', 'ALERTSAs', 'far', 'show', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Maybe', 'anyone', 'else', 'know', 'why', 'Busy', 'Philipps', ""n't"", 'included', 'main', 'cast', ""'ve"", 'got', 'geek', 'freak', 'where', 'Kim', 'Kelly', 'Daniel', 'angry', 'girlfriend', 'Lindsay', 'eventual', 'close', 'friend', 'single', 'episode', 'pivotal', 'many', 'storylines', 'own', 'backstory', 'evolution', 'just', 'other', 'characters', 'would', 'say', 'Kim', 'Kelly', 'more', 'fully', 'evolved', 'character', 'Ken', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Bill', 'Haverchuck', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'included', 'cast', 'photography', 'box', 'part', 'opening', 'theme', 'strange', 'are', 'two', 'fully', 'developed', 'female', 'characters', 'show', 'ostensibly', 'main', 'characters', 'only', 'one', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'official', 'main', 'character', 'others', 'are', 'male', 'giving', 'odd', 'lopsided', 'perspective', 'were', 'just', 'more', 'boys', 'girls', 'high', 'schools.MORE', 'SPOILER', 'ALERTS', 'unfortunate', 'pattern', 'Apatow', 'productions', 'treat', 'girls', 'allowed', 'universe', 'also', 'think', 'interesting', 'freaks', 'geeks', 'stoners', 'etc', 'majority', 'weird', 'characters', 'are', 'male', 'almost', 'female', 'high', 'school', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'cheerleaders', 'and/or', 'hot', 'popular', 'Girls', 'are', 'mostly', 'invisible', 'show', 'portrayed', 'mostly', 'untouchable', 'goddesses', 'pedestals', 'Lindsay', 'Kim', 'course', 'as', 'well', 'Lindsay', 'nerdy', 'friend', 'Millie', 'most', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'see', 'are', 'cheerleaders', ""n't"", 'odd', 'Even', 'Lindsay', 'given', 'pedestal', 'treatment', 'Nick', 'what', 'could', 'otherwise', 'be', 'perfectly', 'healthy', 'high', 'school', 'relationship.Okay', 'have', 'criticisms', 'show', 'obviously', 'stand', '5', 'stars', 'because', 'flaws', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'amazing', 'show', 'powerfully', 'developed', 'characters', 'more', 'impressive', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', '18-episode', 'season']",N/A

Probably its biggest problem, however, was that &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; was a surprisingly sensitive, deftly written and a frequently hilarious and painful little program.Created by Paul Feig and produced by &quot;Larry Sanders&quot; scribe Judd Apatow, it was crammed with cool period references, minor tragedies and sly, dry comedy comparable to that of &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; Of course it was doomed. The show's small-but-aggressive fan base did its best to keep &quot;Freaks&quot; on the air. When the series was initially yanked, NBC reportedly received cubic tons of letters of protest and gave it another chance, but the ratings just weren't there and in 2000 the show was canned for good before it even completed a season.While it's a shame that &quot;Freaks&quot; didn't have a chance to stretch out and grow over the course of four or five seasons, it also never &quot;jumped the shark&quot; or fell into a creative rut, which is, in many ways, a more satisfying consolation. &quot;Freaks&quot; never really had the time to decline to the unwatchable depths that other once-brilliant shows like, say, &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; eventually reached. The new box set, &quot;Freaks and Geeks - The Complete Series,&quot; bears that out.

With NBC basically clueless about what to do with it despite rabid and passionate fanbases, the show moved to bad timeslots and pre-empted episode showings before getting the axe. And while there's a huge devoted following to the show, I only heard of the show recently and finding it on sale at the store, I figured I'd see what the big deal is and while I'll admit it's funny and well-written, I wouldn't say it's when of the perfect shows out there.The show, set somewhere around 1980, centers on the title groups, the ""freaks"" or the ones that are too cool to attend all their classes, prefer lazying around and rocking out, and the ""geeks"" who love Steve Martin and ""Star Wars"". In the center of both groups is Lindsay and Sam Weir who try to find their place in high school as Lindsay sheds her mathlete image and hangs with the misfits while Sam struggles with young adolescence and being in love with someone that tells you the dreaded f-word: ""friend"".Even though I graduated from high school a few years ago, many of the themes and character moments presented in the show are just as familiar to me as anyone. From the faculty member who thinks he's cool from the punks who think they're better than everyone, there's a lot here people can relate to. Getting away from the overdone melodrama of Dawson's Creek where everyone will inevitably sleep with everybody, this show had least had the intelligence to follow these characters realistically. While future Apatow movies like ""40 Year Old Virgin"" combined this with more raunchy humor (to a strange disconnect for me, personally), it's this and his follow-up series ""Undeclared"" that I prefer for taking on more universal themes.Ironically, the problem I have with the show is some of the characters. While some I loved having such as nerdish Bill, school's badboy Daniel or central character Lindsay, some of the others kind of irritated me. Nick Andapolis, a frequent stoner with ambitions as a drummer, is incredibly creepy and no girl I know would find anything he does romantic and even a bit uncomfortable. Ken, played by Seth Rogan of ""Knocked Up"" fame, is basically the dry-humored guy who puts down almost everything and doesn't stray too far from that while Sam is incredibly whiny and can barely get through a line without cracking a smile. At least the adults like Tom Wilson, Larry Flaherty and Dave Allen add some spark to the show.One thing that I can appreciate is the amount of love the creators had for the show as evidenced with the DVD. Attractive book-like packing that reminds me of the old ""Smallville"" sets, there's lots of featurettes and surprisingly, many commentaries. I'm talking at least 29 commentaries for 18 episodes here folks with people who worked on the show, starred in the show, actors on the show in character and fan commentaries. While most of us probably won't even check out half of em, it's nice to see such a huge assortment of goodies available to fans as opposed to the rather anemic ones on other sets (2 commentaries and 3 featurettes? Booooo).I'd recommend Freaks and Geeks since there's bound to be people that love it but there's plenty of other shows that I absolutely love and there's some I like, and well...I like Freaks and Geeks.",4,A set bursting at the seams with goodies,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,3357,"['When', 'people', 'list', 'shows', 'were', 'cancelled', 'time', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'will', 'frequently', 'come', 'out', 'NBC', 'basically', 'clueless', 'what', 'do', 'rabid', 'passionate', 'fanbases', 'show', 'moved', 'bad', 'timeslots', 'pre-empted', 'episode', 'showings', 'getting', 'axe', 'huge', 'devoted', 'following', 'show', 'only', 'heard', 'show', 'recently', 'finding', 'sale', 'store', 'figured', ""'d"", 'see', 'what', 'big', 'deal', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'funny', 'well-written', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'when', 'perfect', 'out', 'there.The', 'show', 'set', 'somewhere', '1980', 'centers', 'title', 'groups', 'freaks', 'ones', 'are', 'too', 'cool', 'attend', 'classes', 'prefer', 'lazying', 'around', 'rocking', 'out', 'geeks', 'who', 'love', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Star', 'Wars', 'center', 'groups', 'Lindsay', 'Sam', 'Weir', 'who', 'try', 'find', 'place', 'high', 'school', 'Lindsay', 'mathlete', 'image', 'hangs', 'misfits', 'Sam', 'young', 'adolescence', 'being', 'love', 'someone', 'dreaded', 'f-word', 'friend', '.Even', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'many', 'themes', 'character', 'moments', 'presented', 'show', 'are', 'just', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'faculty', 'member', 'who', 'cool', 'punks', 'who', 'think', ""'re"", 'better', 'everyone', 'lot', 'here', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'Getting', 'away', 'overdone', 'melodrama', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'where', 'everyone', 'will', 'inevitably', 'sleep', 'everybody', 'show', 'had', 'least', 'had', 'intelligence', 'follow', 'characters', 'realistically', 'future', 'Apatow', 'movies', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'combined', 'more', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'strange', 'disconnect', 'personally', 'follow-up', 'series', 'Undeclared', 'prefer', 'taking', 'more', 'universal', 'themes.Ironically', 'problem', 'have', 'show', 'characters', 'loved', 'having', 'such', 'nerdish', 'Bill', 'school', 'badboy', 'Daniel', 'central', 'character', 'Lindsay', 'others', 'kind', 'irritated', 'Nick', 'Andapolis', 'frequent', 'stoner', 'ambitions', 'drummer', 'incredibly', 'creepy', 'girl', 'know', 'would', 'find', 'anything', 'romantic', 'even', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'Ken', 'played', 'Seth', 'Rogan', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'fame', 'basically', 'dry-humored', 'guy', 'who', 'down', 'almost', 'everything', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'while', 'Sam', 'incredibly', 'whiny', 'can', 'barely', 'get', 'line', 'cracking', 'smile', 'least', 'adults', 'Tom', 'Wilson', 'Larry', 'Flaherty', 'Dave', 'Allen', 'add', 'spark', 'show.One', 'thing', 'can', 'appreciate', 'amount', 'love', 'creators', 'had', 'show', 'evidenced', 'DVD', 'Attractive', 'book-like', 'packing', 'old', 'Smallville', 'sets', 'lots', 'featurettes', 'surprisingly', 'many', 'commentaries', ""'m"", 'talking', 'least', '29', 'commentaries', '18', 'episodes', 'here', 'folks', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'starred', 'show', 'actors', 'show', 'character', 'fan', 'commentaries', 'most', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'check', 'out', 'half', 'em', 'nice', 'see', 'such', 'huge', 'assortment', 'goodies', 'available', 'fans', 'opposed', 'rather', 'anemic', 'ones', 'other', 'sets', '2', 'commentaries', '3', 'featurettes', 'Booooo', '.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'bound', 'be', 'people', 'love', 'plenty', 'other', 'shows', 'absolutely', 'love', 'like', 'well', 'like', 'Freaks', 'Geeks']",N/A

Anyway, what a great show.  I hadn't watched F&G; since it was originally broadcast, and finally thought -- a decade later -- that the time had come to revisit the show.  Would it still hold up?  Boy, would it!This is one of the few totally honest, accurate, non-sentimentalized depictions of what American kids were really like in the 1970s (technically the early '80s, but close enough...) Along with Richard Linklatter's ""Dazed And Confused,"" this is an authentic document of the times, giving its characters the dignity they deserve, that is, the dignity of being portrayed in an honest fashion as flawed, endearing, utterly real people, kids coming of age in a new but still relatively naive pop culture, regular kids, bored with life, terrified by it, but yearning for more. What more can be said?  Director Judd Apatow has become an ascendant comedic force, but it's amazing to see how powerful a storyteller he was here... And the ""missing"" episodes, those that were not aired on the network during the show's first run, are also instructive, particularly the jarring episode showing Kim's explosive home life.

For anyone who felt like high school was cruel or lame or whatever, needs to check this show out. Any kid entering high school should watch this show. I love how honest it is, it's not melodramtic like 90210 or even Degrassi: Next Generation. This show goes there but not that extreme. Also unlike My So-Called Life, it's funny. My So-Called Life had it's funny moments but was more of a drama. I like Freaks and Geeks because of the comedic element, because that's how life is, it shows that sometimes the funny people have their issues as well and deal with them like adulterous parents or having your mom date your p.e. coach. I could definitly identify with Lindsay, I felt the same exact way my sophomore year. And I remember when this show came out and trying to catch it whenever I could but it was scheduled at a bad time, Friday's at 8 or 9, then it moved to Saturday's. The few episodes I did see were great and I would tell friends about it and they never heard of it.

But all of the praise heaped on this dvd set tempted me, so I bought it.  In two words, it is simply wonderful.

There are almost no cheap gags in this series (although at times it is hilarious); almost none of the scenes strike a false note.  It is just the everyday portrayal of 11th grade Lindsay Weir and her 9th grade brother, Sam, their family and their friends, and, of course, high school in 1981.  The humanity of each of the characters, whether they are the burnouts (inexplicably called the freaks) with whom Lindsay, a top student, starts to hang out with, or the (aptly named) geeks, Sam's friends, is subtly but fully portrayed.  By the last episode, I was almost in tears -- not because it was sad, but because I couldn't believe the series was over; that I would not be able to follow the lives of these characters anymore.  I think I will always miss them.  The ""special features"" such as the deleted scenes and the commentary are nothing special unless you are obsessed with F&G.

The critical flaw in the show was that it completely, utterly, abjectly failed in everything that it set out to do. It's not more realistic than Beverly Hills 90210, it's just unrealistic to the opposite extreme. Every episode is some overblown soap opera about a problem that the characters completely brought upon themselves, and that everyone I knew in high school never got flustered about, usually by not having the problem in the first place. The ""geek"" characters are all one-dimensional self-parodies who compare every single thing that happens in their lives to something that they saw on Star Wars/Star Trek/Battlestar Galactica/etc. No REAL geek would ever do that. These guys aren't geeks, they're such losers that real geeks would stuff THEM into lockers. And the ""freaks"" are even worse. One would expect a ""freak"" to be unusual in some way, right? Isn't that what makes them freaks? Well, not in the F&G universe. Judd Apatow defines ""freaks"" as characters who are so boring, bland, and devoid of anything resembling personality that they can't even be called one-dimensional. They're zero-dimensional.

802755,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B0001EQHXO,James D. Leverton,"[7, 7]","""Freaks and Geeks"" is quite honestly my choice for best TV comedy series of all time.  Although its entire run consists of only 18 episodes, every episode rates *****, and they are brilliantly cast, expertly written, skillfully directed, and offer more bellylaughs per hour than any other series I have ever seen.  Fans of ""Seinfeld,"" ""Frasier,"" ""Cheers,"" ""Dick Van Dyke Show,"" ""I Love Lucy,"" ""Andy Griffith Show, ""MASH,"" etc. will think I'm nuts, but I don't care.  ""Freaks and Geeks"" deserves its cult status and my hope is that this outstanding DVD release will bring it the multitude of fans it deserves.So, if it's so great, why did it get cancelled after only 18 episodes?  Simple: corporate myopity and lame-brained programming by the dolts at NBC, who originally premiered it on Saturday nights when its target audience wasn't even home to watch it, then frequently pre-empted it and shuffled it around the schedule so that it was impossible to find.  Even this fan missed several episodes because of lousy programming, so it's no wonder the ratings were anemic.  If the same idiots were running NBC in the early '80's, ""Cheers,"" which was low-rated in its first season, would have been given a quick hook and not only would we not have had that brilliant series, but we would never have known the character Frasier or the wonderful cast of the classic spinoff.  So who knows what could have happened if ""Freaks and Geeks"" were give half a chance by the NBC meatheads?""Freaks and Geeks"" takes place during the 1980-81 school year, which just happens to be my own senior year in high school and  I can verify it is an absolutely perfect representation of this particular year.  (Only the anachronistic reference to 1982's ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" in the second episode spoils the creative teams's otherwise perfect attention to detail.)  The fashions, the decor, the characters, everything about this little gem ring absolutely true as it follows the two title cliques as they navigate the school year in their own ways.  For the geeks, it's by dodging bullies and indulging in their favorite pasttimes--science fiction and silly comedies (""The Jerk"" is referred to frequently) and the dreadful TV shows of the time (""Starsky and Hutch"" and ""Dukes of Hazzard"" seem to be favorites).  For the ""Freaks,"" on the other hand, it is by underachieving, getting high, making fun of everyone else and by pretending not to care about their futures.  Then they are joined by the newly rebellious ""mathlete"" Lyndsey Weir, whose brother Sam is the leader of the ""Geeks,"" and their group dynamic starts to change as Lyndsey starts to influence the group for the better and, vice versa, they influence her for the worst.Linda Cardelini and John Francis Daley are wonderful in the lead roles, and are matched by the entire supporting cast of ""Freaks""--rising star James ""Spiderman"" Franco, Seth Rogan, Jason Segel and the absolutely wonderful Busy Phillips as campus slut Kim Kelley--and ""Geeks""--Samm Levene and my personal favorite, Martin Starr, who is brilliant as the ultimate nerd Bill Haverchuck, who walks around in a daze as if he had a permanent question mark over his head.  Starr is an absolute marvel in this wonderfully complex role.  Actually, the entire cast is perfect, down to the smallest recurring role.  (Watch for Ben Foster and Shia LaBeof(sp?) in particular.  My other two favorites:  the absolutely hilarious Joe Flaherty as Lyndsey and Sam's well-meaning hardware store-owning father, whose frequently ad-libbed lectures are often gut-bustingly funny, and Dave ""Gruber"" Allen as the dippy, ex-hippy counselor who is convinced the students think he is the coolest but is really seen as a total joke by one and all.  His obliviousness to the reality of the situation leads to big laughs, but then so does most everything else in the series.  And Becky Ann Baker is wonderful as Lyndsey and Sam's supportive, yet concerned mother, who is torn between supportively watching her kids grow into adults and wanting to keep them young forever.  She is the emotional heart and soul of the show.Of the eighteen episodes, my own favorite is the previously unseen opus ""Kim Kelley is My Friend,"" in which Lyndsey and Kim bond while dealing with Kim's incredibly dysfunctional family (which includes ""School of Rock"" scribe Mike White as her lazy brother and Anne Dowd in an uproarious bit as Kim's trailer-trash mother) and Kim's anger at her best friend and boyfriend (Rashida Jones and Franco) when she catches them making out behind her back.  Everything collides in a hysterical confrontation at Lyndsey's house as her befuddled parents watch helplessly from the sidelines.  Watch this one, then answer this question:  what was so offensive about it that the stooges at NBC refused to air it?  You'll be as stumped as I am.Finally, kudos to the creative talent behind the series (including Judd Apatow, Jon and Jake Kasdan, White, et al) not only for taking the time and care to craft a potential classic TV series (thanks to DVD this is now possible for shows that failed to find an audience in their all-to-brief runs) but also for taking care to secure all the rights to the show's music, which includes many expensive popular hits of the time, so the viewer can enjoy these episodes as they were originally intended.  The result is a more expensive DVD collection but believe me, it is worth it.  In addition, the many cast commentaries are wonderful and often as funny as the shows themselves.  And the extras and outtakes are excellent and obviously chosen with great care.  This is definitely a DVD collection that does a great series total justice.In all, I couldn't be happier with this collection, and I couldn't recommend it more highly.

802760,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0001EQHXO,Jonathan Appleseed,"[13, 13]","When the credits started to roll at the end of the last episode, Discos and Dragons, I was profoundly sad. I was so because: 1) I knew this show only lasted for one season, so there was no more to see; and 2) it is another sad example of how great - no, prodigious - television is denied airtime because of low ratings. This is the kind of show that should cause TV snobs who are proud to advertise to the world that they don't even own a TV to go buy one just to watch this.Television doesn't get much better than this. Although billed as a comedy, and while the show steadily delivers staggering punch lines, this is as much drama as comedy. There are *real* characters in this show, with real feelings, and quantifiable reactions to stimuli that resound with verity. While many shows that chronicle a time past suffer from an abundance of anachronisms, this does not. As a child of the 80s - my freshman year in high school began in the fall of 1980 - I can vouch for the shows authentic grounding.Freaks and Geeks won an Emmy, Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series, and not only is that spot-on and deserved, it also serves as greater frustration for this show's single season stint. Even in the best shows, there's often one character that doesn't quite fit their role. Eric Mabius, IMHO, is a good example. He has essentially two roles on Ugly Betty: 1) the playboy who, for complex and mostly paternal reasons, resembles the prodigal son and a frighteningly irresponsible executive; and 2) the reforming playboy who wants to succeed, is riddled with self-doubt - again, mostly for paternal reasons, and responds positively to Betty's unflagging encouragement. In the second role, he's outstanding. In the first, he's not believable.There are no miscasts in this show.From the hippy guidance counselor trying to relate to a new breed of students that emerged almost as anti-hippies, to fringe characters like the discotheque DJ, every character is fully realized and acts in congruence with their personality. I didn't notice one single character in the entire season who ever said or did anything that disagreed with that character's core personality. That doesn't mean that nobody grew. They did, and that is the genius of this show. Every main character, and most fringe characters, experienced growth.***Spoiler...read the next two paragraphs at your own risk! &lt;grin>***The best example (again, IMHO) was that of Sam, played by John Francis Daley. He began the school year hopelessly in love with Cindy Sanders. Not Cindy - Cindy Sanders. As he was a ""geek"", and she was a cheerleader, the likelihood of them coming together seemed possible only if Cindy Sanders stepped out of character. However, they did get together, and Cindy did not step out of character. It seemed that the show's writers, producers, etc., laid the groundwork for their potential relationship early on, so when it finally happened, it felt normal. Granted, Cindy expressed interest in Sam a bit too quickly after breaking up with her handsome jock boyfriend Todd, but her reasons for wanting to get together with Sam, which were that she wanted to go out with a *nice* guy (and Sam is nothing if not a nice guy) were convincing.But a funny thing happened. Sam discovered that he was bored when they hung out together. They went to malls, and spent the rest of the time making out. Neal couldn't understand what could be wrong with that, but *we* know. If you have nothing in common with a person, it doesn't matter how attracted you are to them. Ennui will set in and fester like a suppurating ulcer, and the relationship itself, if untended, will become septic. So Sam makes the unbelievably brave decision to break up with Cindy Sanders. I might not have believed that his character was capable of such bravery - for what geek, especially in high school, would ever break up with a cheerleader? - but again, as the series progressed, we learned that Sam was not just a nice guy, he was a guy who knew what was right and what was wrong, and someone who was very comfortable in his own skin. He knew who he was, and he knew that Cindy would not make him happy.***End of Spoiler***It's a shame that this show was cancelled, but that is often the fate of great TV. Low ratings, low advertising dollars, no money for the network, so, so long and good-bye.I would have loved to watch Sam and his friends grow up, mostly because I had absolute faith in the show's producers and writers to continue presenting us with great television. It would have offered an interesting counterpoint to 90210, where, IMHO, we saw plots change, characters given different ""assignments"", but no real growth.One thing the show didn't do was show the extremes. There are ""freaks"", and then are ""FREAKS"". Same goes for geeks. That was a wise decision. The freaks were kinder and gentler, and the geeks weren't quite as extreme as one would expect. This allowed us to relate to them better than we would have if those factions were represented by the extremes. (That should go without saying.)What is great, though, is that we're seeing some of the brilliance of Judd Apatow's and Paul Feig's work on the silver screen. Knocked Up and Superbad had all of the sensibility of Freaks and Geeks.Here's to hoping that they have long careers ahead of them.",5,"Nearly flawless in execution, Freaks and Geeks is one of the best

When this happens we seem to have a inner need to put on our nostalgic 'rose colored glasses' and say something like ""these are the best years of your life"" to the nearest teenager around. Most likely they are thinking ""if that's true, then shoot me now""! The reason for this is that we seem to magically forget, that unless you were the Varsity football quaterback or the Head Cheerleader, being a teenager in high school pretty much su**ed! Thank goodness for the single 1999 season of a TV show called ""Freaks and Geeks"" (created by Paul Feig & Judd Apatrow) came out to hilariously remind us of the real truths of high school and to realistically protray the lives of teenagers. The series takes place in the early 1980s and revolves around the teenage lives of brother & sister, Sam and Lindsay Weir. Sam (John Francis) is just entering that black hole we now call high school. He's small and puny, loves ""Star Wars"", ""Dugeons & Dragons"", Steve Martin and hanging with his even 'geekier' friends Neal (Sam Levine) and Bill (Martin Starr). Just from that short description you know, that we are watching the hellish trials & tribulations of three guys, who are pretty much at the bottom of the high school 'food chain'. On the other side of the coin is Sam's older sister, Lindsay. Lindsay (Linda Cardellini) is super smart, a 'staight A' student (a former mathlete!!) and was an all around good kid, who stayed out of trouble. But with the recent death of her grandmother, she's now questioning and testing her life. That means wearing an oversized army jacket and hanging out with her new 'Freak' friends (we use to called them 'burnouts') that includes the misunderstood bad boy, Daniel (James Franco), funny man, Ken (Seth Rogan) Nick (Jason Segal), who lives to be the next drummer in the rock group 'Rush' and the original 'Mean Girl', Kim (Busy Phillips). You knew these guys in high school. They were the ones endlessly cutting class, blasting heavy metal in the parking lot and keeping the 'Boy's Bathroom' supplied with a huge concentration of cigerette smoke. We follow these two clicks of teenagers through the high school year as they (sometimes humorusly) confront the social stuff, that is so important in the lives of teenagers. I think the reason this show is so good is the pure excellence of the writing. This show honestly lays out the 'ins and outs' of high school life. It really shows the pecking order that exists. The dialogue is hilarious yet stays realistic. You can honestly believe its stuff, that would come out of the mouth of a teenager. This is not a rehashing of ""Revenge of the Nerds"". The characters remain real without being boring. The other reason this is such a great show is the all around excellence of the ensemble cast. They look and sound like real high school kids, not an over beautified cast of some prime time soap opera! This show was only (criminally) a single season with anemic ratings, but now is developing a cult-like following, that has made it more popular than when it was on the air (shades of 'Star Trek'!!). This has lead to the DVD box set release of ""Freaks and Geeks - The Complete Series"". If ever there is an example of care being put into releasing a TV series to DVD, than this is it. Kudos go out to Executive Producers Paul Feig & Jud Apatow along with the company, 'Shout Factory' for doing such a great job! The picture and sound are wonderful! The original soundtrack featuring name groups (including bands such as Rush, Styx, Grateful Dead, The Who ETC.) remains intact without editing. This DVD set is also loaded with tons of extras. All twenty-nine episodes include commentary tracks from various writers, producers and members of the cast. Also, each episode includes rare deleted scenes and outtakes (which also include commentaries). This simply is ""Freaks & Geeks"" heaven! If you already are a fan of ""Freaks & Geeks"" or if you would like to give a chance to a fantastically, funny show that wasn't given a fair chance from the TV networks, than check out this DVD box!

From the writing to the casting to the cinemetography - everything about it was perfect.  As the creators of the show explained, this was a TV show about high school that featured those in high school who were not regularly portrayed on television before.  Even high school shows that were in the same league as &quot;Freaks &amp; Geeks&quot; like &quot;My So Called Life&quot; didn't always match the reality of what it was like to be in HS.  &quot;Freaks &amp; Geeks&quot; did.Maybe the title of the show caused many not to tune in during its 1999-2000 television run.  Maybe the mainstream television viewing public thought, &quot;oh, this is a show for people who *are* freaks and geeks?&quot; and how many people really want to admit that they fall into either of those categories?  &quot;F&amp;G&quot; however was not a show about being PROUD of being a &quot;Freak&quot; or a &quot;Geek,&quot; but more about showing how people are much more than the labels that are placed upon them.  The show focused on all the common themes of high school--from facing bullies, to trying to fit into a new group of friends, to having a first girlfriend, and more--but did it with such a realistic delicacy that it alternately broke your heart and made you laugh out loud because you really could've been watching something that happened in your very own life.If you're unfamiliar with the show, all the positive reviews you've read about it are right--it was great.  Pick this up and it will become a prized possession in your DVD collection.  For those who have seen the show and enjoyed it, DEFINITELY pick this up.  I've never seen a DVD with such a HUGE amount of extras--auditions, deleted scenes, TONS of commentaries, and more.You really can't go wrong with this purchase.

This is a show about the outcasts.  Though the show takes place in 1980, I think everyone will be able to relate to it.  These kids went to your high school.  You might have been one of them!

I'm in agreement with Busy Phillips (Kim Kelly), as she tells Starr on one of the many commentary tracks: Bill is my favorite F&amp;G character, and Starr is my favorite actor in a cast of wonderful actors.The many commentaries are wonderful to watch, and contain all sorts of random combinations or cool offerings (the actors who play the parents; the actors who guest as the coach and Sam's cheating dad!!!).

Storylines, although often juvenile, are honest, realistic, and unpredictable. There is no saccharine coating of adolescent years. This is well written, well shot, well directed acting that exposes the doubts, worries, and worlds of deservedly self-centered teenagers.

Like classics such as ""All in the Family"" and ""The Wonder Years"", the writing is superb, consistent and dare I say, perfect. ""Freaks and Geeks"" never leaves a stone unturned and in only 18 episodes, explores more characters than many series spanning 5 seasons or more. The plotlines are original, the dialogue is fresh and funny, the actors are born to play their roles and do so with confidence and ease, the historical references of the 80's such as ""the Atari"" and ""Caddyshack"" reflect popular trends and pop culture of the day DEAD ON and the soundtrack is amazing!!! So why...WHY did ""Freaks and Geeks"" get CANCELLED???Sometimes the perfect thing comes at the wrong time. I mean, I didn't watch it 1999. I didn't even know it was on until it was already axed. It seems as though the studio didn't fully market the show or believe in it's potential, therefore there were minimal viewers and a lack of interest with advertisers? I don't know for sure. What I do know is that I would rather have 18 episodes of this remarkable series on DVD with a plethora of commentary, deleted scenes and all the original music in tact, than nothing at all. I wonder if the series had stayed on longer, would it have received the same exceptional treatment on DVD? Maybe not? Maybe so? I'm just glad I own this set and am thankful for having had the opportunity to watch such a wonderful series.

Lohrke,"[2, 3]","there's not really much more that can be said about the fabulous 'freaks and geeks' that's not already been said--but here it goes anyway.it's a testament to paul feig, judd apatow, their writers and especially their actors that after only 18 episodes 'freaks and geeks' inspired the kind of devotion it did.  it's also another prime example of network talking heads/suits ending a show way too soon ('firefly' and 'my so-called life' also suffered unfortunate and untimely demises) and never really giving it a chance to reach a broader audience. although we do have to lay some blame at the american public--why do we watch so much crappy, throw-away television and not watch something of real quality? that's a question i fear will never be answered.what made 'freaks and geeks' so special was its subject matter. most shows that deal with teenagers, it seems, focus on the impossibly rich, mathematically pretty, and unbelievably popular. truth is those folks make up like .01% of the population. 'freaks and geeks' dealt with everyday people--the socially awkward, the rejects, the class clowns, the intellectually challenged, and, of course, the nerds and the geeks (a.k.a 'all of us'), and made them human, interesting, conflicted, and most importantly, redemptive.  by the end of the series, each one will hold a special place in your heart.the cast was about as great a cast you could ever expect or hope for. linda cardellini ('er') shines as lindsay weir. she's amazing as the former mathlete trying to make sense of the changing world around her after her grandma dies. john francis daley is also great as lindsay's younger, optimistic, girl-afraid brother, sam.  he's just about as cute and endearing as you can get (and has the single best sequence in the entire series: a certain blue oval covering his nether-regions as he darts through the school after getting locked out of the locker room in the buff!). they're the show's heart and anchor.the supporting cast (seth rogan, martin starr, james franco, and jason segal, busy phillips--what a cast!!) is amazing. again, pitch-perfect casting. every character, though hugely flawed, is someone you'll grow to love. even the super-creepy 'harris' (the zen-master, geek-guru) earns your love.there are so many quality moments in this show that it's impossible to name them all, but here are a few you can look forward to: nick standing outside lindsay's door in his undies; nick singing 'lady l' to ken; ken's grabbing nick's guitar and destroying before nick has a chance to sing 'lady l' to linsday; bill watching tv and eating his tv dinner; nick disco dancing; the hideous mascot outfit (what IS that?); daniel naming his d&d; dwarf 'carlos'; it's even great cameos from jason schwartsman ('rushmore') and rashida jones ('the office').my only quibble with 'freaks and geeks' (and it IS minor) is that tired cliche of religious kids ('millie') being so uptight and rigid -- sure, a lot are. but most aren't.  fortunately, the writers had the good sense to redeem millie and make her lindsay's most tried and true friend, but they still resorted to cliche after cliche with her character.you really can't go wrong with this show. i've watched it with over and over with several friends who'd never seen it.  without fail they all go out and buy it.  props to everyone involved with the show, and especially for taking the time to release a quality DVD with tons of extras, including commentary tracks with the actors.rip, freaks and geeks. we all miss you.",5,incredible television,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,3521,"['not', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'fabulous', ""'freaks"", 'geeks', 'not', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'here', 'testament', 'paul', 'feig', 'judd', 'apatow', 'writers', 'especially', 'actors', 'only', '18', 'episodes', ""'freaks"", 'geeks', 'inspired', 'kind', 'devotion', 'did', 'also', 'prime', 'example', 'network', 'talking', 'heads/suits', 'ending', 'show', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'so-called', 'life', 'also', 'suffered', 'unfortunate', 'untimely', 'demises', 'never', 'really', 'giving', 'chance', 'reach', 'broader', 'audience', 'do', 'have', 'lay', 'blame', 'american', 'public', 'why', 'do', 'watch', 'so', 'much', 'crappy', 'throw-away', 'television', 'not', 'watch', 'something', 'real', 'quality', 'question', 'i', 'fear', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'answered.what', 'made', ""'freaks"", 'geeks', 'so', 'special', 'was', 'subject', 'matter', 'most', 'shows', 'deal', 'teenagers', 'focus', 'impossibly', 'rich', 'mathematically', 'pretty', 'unbelievably', 'popular', 'truth', 'folks', 'make', 'up', '.01', '%', 'population', ""'freaks"", 'geeks', 'dealt', 'everyday', 'people', 'socially', 'awkward', 'rejects', 'class', 'clowns', 'intellectually', 'challenged', 'course', 'nerds', 'geeks', 'a.k.a', ""'all"", 'made', 'human', 'interesting', 'conflicted', 'most', 'importantly', 'redemptive', 'end', 'series', 'one', 'will', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'heart.the', 'cast', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'great', 'cast', 'could', 'ever', 'expect', 'hope', 'linda', 'cardellini', ""'er"", 'shines', 'lindsay', 'weir', 'amazing', 'former', 'mathlete', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'changing', 'world', 'grandma', 'dies', 'john', 'francis', 'daley', 'also', 'great', 'lindsay', 'younger', 'optimistic', 'girl-afraid', 'brother', 'sam', 'just', 'about', 'cute', 'endearing', 'can', 'get', 'single', 'best', 'sequence', 'entire', 'series', 'certain', 'blue', 'oval', 'covering', 'nether-regions', 'school', 'getting', 'locked', 'locker', 'room', 'buff', ""'re"", 'show', 'heart', 'anchor.the', 'supporting', 'cast', 'seth', 'rogan', 'martin', 'starr', 'james', 'franco', 'jason', 'segal', 'busy', 'phillips', 'what', 'cast', 'amazing', 'again', 'pitch-perfect', 'casting', 'character', 'hugely', 'flawed', 'someone', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'love', 'even', 'super-creepy', ""'harris"", 'zen-master', 'geek-guru', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'quality', 'moments', 'show', 'impossible', 'name', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'nick', 'standing', 'outside', 'lindsay', 'door', 'undies', 'singing', ""'lady"", 'l', 'ken', 'grabbing', 'nick', 'guitar', 'destroying', 'nick', 'chance', 'sing', ""'lady"", 'l', 'linsday', 'bill', 'watching', 'tv', 'eating', 'tv', 'dinner', 'disco', 'dancing', 'hideous', 'mascot', 'outfit', 'what', 'daniel', 'naming', 'd', 'd', ""'carlos"", 'even', 'great', 'cameos', 'jason', 'schwartsman', 'rashida', 'jones', ""'the"", 'office', 'only', 'quibble', ""'freaks"", 'geeks', 'IS', 'minor', 'tired', 'cliche', 'religious', 'kids', ""'millie"", 'being', 'so', 'uptight', 'rigid', 'sure', 'lot', 'are', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'fortunately', 'writers', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'redeem', 'millie', 'make', 'lindsay', 'most', 'tried', 'true', 'friend', 'still', 'resorted', 'cliche', 'cliche', 'character.you', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'show', 'i', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'friends', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'fail', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'everyone', 'involved', 'show', 'especially', 'taking', 'time', 'release', 'quality', 'DVD', 'tons', 'extras', 'including', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'actors.rip', 'freaks', 'geeks', 'miss']",N/A

It was definately a worthwhile purchase providing several hours of enjoyment, and I haven't even listened to all the extra commentaries available (I believe there are two for every episode-of which there are 18). It has several cringe-worthy awkward teenager moments, but it also captures the everyday ups and downs of high school life in a more realistic fashion than most TV teen dramas. One of the main reasons, probably ahs something to do with Judd Apatow (The Larry Sanders Show, The 40 Year Old Bachelor, Knocked Up), but credit must also go to the creator Paul Feig who was inspired to make a homage to his high school days. There are some standout performances by people like Linda Cardellini who went onto fame as an ER regular. Other cast members would become Apatow regulars like Seth Rogen (star of Knocked Up), Jason Segel, and Martin Starr.It is set in 1981 in Michigan and covers some uncharted territory like pot smoking, fake IDs, dungeons and dragons, and other more well worn themes (fist kiss, cheating in school, getting picked on by bullies). However, one of the more inspiring aspect of the series was the music which combines the sublime (The Who, Faces, Joe Jackson, the Cars, etc...) with the dated (Van Halen, Styx, Journey, etc...), but completely appropriate in all cases. I love the scene where Sam asks a girl for a slow dance to Styx's ""Come Sail Away"" and it switches from a slow dance to a fast dance just as he gets on the dance floor-absolutely hilarious.",5,Believe The hype,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,1632,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'spurred', 'buy', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'set', 'constant', 'references', 'Onion', 'AV', 'Club', 'was', 'definately', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'providing', 'several', 'hours', 'enjoyment', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'listened', 'extra', 'commentaries', 'available', 'believe', 'are', 'two', 'episode-of', 'are', '18', 'several', 'cringe-worthy', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'moments', 'also', 'everyday', 'ups', 'downs', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'more', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'most', 'TV', 'teen', 'dramas', 'One', 'main', 'reasons', 'probably', 'something', 'do', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'Show', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Bachelor', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'credit', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'creator', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'who', 'was', 'inspired', 'make', 'homage', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'are', 'standout', 'performances', 'people', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'who', 'went', 'onto', 'fame', 'ER', 'regular', 'Other', 'cast', 'members', 'would', 'become', 'Apatow', 'regulars', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'star', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Martin', 'Starr.It', 'set', '1981', 'Michigan', 'uncharted', 'territory', 'pot', 'smoking', 'fake', 'IDs', 'dungeons', 'dragons', 'other', 'more', 'well', 'worn', 'themes', 'fist', 'kiss', 'cheating', 'school', 'getting', 'picked', 'bullies', 'However', 'one', 'more', 'inspiring', 'aspect', 'series', 'was', 'music', 'sublime', 'Who', 'Faces', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'Cars', 'etc', 'dated', 'Van', 'Halen', 'Styx', 'Journey', 'etc', 'completely', 'appropriate', 'cases', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'Sam', 'girl', 'slow', 'dance', 'Styx', 'Come', 'Sail', 'Away', 'slow', 'dance', 'fast', 'dance', 'just', 'dance', 'floor-absolutely', 'hilarious']",N/A

TV this good can't last because its not the simplified, trashy, reductionist, lowest common demoninator, voyueristic crap we (mostly) get dished up nowadays.Tell me when you watched the last episode, you didn't feel a great sadness, like reading a fantastic book that comes to an end but you don't want it to end. Bittersweet, so bittersweet. This show, it was a great story. That's how I visualize: I treat the 18 episodes as chapters of a self-contained work. The fact they got a chance to resolve the story was good. It didn't just end, with hope of future rebirth or a movie conclusion. And each 'chapter' is great in its own way. I won't reiterate what people have said about this other than the DVD comes with all the original music as well as 3-6 deleted scenes for each episode, most of which are truly brilliant but were cut because of time or because they were too much for TV (ie. nick's creepy love for lindsey). One complaint, I would have liked to see them- the scenes cut for time- reinserted into the story. They all have commentary as well from various cast members.The ratings on this show don't lie. It's not often you get to find something truly unique, original and powerful- even immense!- on TV like this. That's why you knew it couldn't last. It's deep TV, you have to give your attention to get the full reward- not just open up and say ah TV as seem to fill the timeslots now.Perhaps I may be baised as I was 11 in 1980 when the show is set and, despite being australian, I remember most of 'texture' in the show:  characters (people like each character, including myself), clothing, decor, toys, games, etc. (not the cars though!). Perhaps nostalgia does color some of my feelings toward this show, but its more than that. The show has the power to grab hold of you and hold you enthralled as well as cracking you up at its hilarity at times. Its strength is that it makes you empathize with the characters. You connect with them because you can understand them. There's no sensationalized plots or characters, no fancy clothes, cars or houses, no unrealistic sleaze or smut. These a normal people living normal lives. The times may change, but the key issues don't -> setting the show in 1980 allowed them to strip away the technology that surrounds us, and reveal the more things change, the more they stay the same.I guess it was a show to show you that you weren't/aren't alone in what you went through at school.Buy this, watch it over and over and over, because you will. It's remarkable, special, unique, brilliant, powerful, poignant, honest, hilarious,...yes, it is THAT good.

802789,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B0001EQHXO,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[0, 0]","As a fan of Judd Apatow's recent movies, I was thrilled to learn that he also served as an Executive Producer and writer on ""Freaks and Geeks,"" which also starred some of the best actors from his film.  So I came for the Judd Apatow humor... and stayed for everything.  ""Freaks and Geeks"" is an utterly flawless high school comedy drama that is acted by some of the most talented young people around and written by truly hilarious people who bring out the funny in every day life, and are also deeply aware of the aches and pains of high school life.  It's one of the most realistic shows ever, finding humor in awkward facial expressions and naturalistic (but still highly quotable dialogue), and merely watching will show how much fun the cast and crew had in making this brilliant show.The storylines are about a group of ""freaks"" (stoners and the like) and a group of ""geeks"" in high school.  The stories often overlap, and the various stereotypes of day to day high school life are studied, torn apart, and rendered utterly real.  Seeing the different groups interact is so great, and I love that each character is given a chance to develop and have a really strong backstory.  They're all hilarious, they're all heartbreaking in their own way, and their character arcs are all done in such an achingly real way.The best way that I can describe it is likeMy So-Called LifemeetsSuperbad, because the way that they manage to balance the true to life drama with the comedy is superhuman.  It's hard to talk about the show, really, because talking at length about either the cast or the writing comes off as gushing, because it's all just so damn good.  But what the heck.  I'll gush away.  The cast is fantastic, from the mathlete turned freak Linda Cardellini to her geek brother John Francis-Daley to the drum obsessed Jason Segel to the snarky Seth Rogen to the bad boy James Franco to the awkward Martin Starr and everyone else, they're all fantastic and they all transcend their roles and any stereotypical adjectives I can apply to them.Quite simply, this show rocks.  If you like television, you need to own this.  If you ever went to high school, you need to own this.  It's universally enjoyable, heartbreaking, and hilarious.

802790,A6JQ6I9LGKXBG,B0001EQHXO,Paul Wiseman,"[2, 2]","Living overseas, I missed Freaks and Geeks' all-too-brief run on television. But after enjoying The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up, I wanted to know what Judd Apatow had been up to earlier. And wow. This is some of the most powerful, original stuff I've ever seen on the small screen. It took a little getting used to. The pilot at first struck me as pretty bleak. Just about everyone at McKinley High School seemed thoroughly unpleasant. But the first episode ends joyously - and I was hooked. I loved the way the writers refused to do the obvious thing, always turning away from clich&eacute; to give their characters a sometimes heart-breaking humanity. I'm thinking of Coach Fredericks, Neil's philandering dad, Mr. Weir, Gordon Crisp, Millie, Mr. Rosso, Harris, even the annoying bully Alan. The regular cast is amazing. Martin Starr's Bill Haverchuck is one of the funniest, most original characters in TV history. Jason Segel's Nick is simultaneously sad, decent, creepy and probably doomed to a life of failure - one of the most sympathetic characters ever. James Franco's Daniel gets by on charm but he's a loser going nowhere - and he knows it. Busy Phillips' Kim Kelly, one of the most abrasive characters I've ever seen, in the end wins our hearts. Seth Rogen fans may be surprised by his character here. Beady-eyed, stoic, sarcastic Ken Miller is nothing like the lovable man-child Rogen plays on the big screen - though there are hints of a change in some of the later episodes.  I loved the way the characters look so real; they're often uglier than the folks you usually encounter on TV. (Well, James Franco and Linda Cardellini are gorgeous - but they're dressed down to seem like people you might actually see at school.) You're left wondering what Apatow and Paul Feig would have done if they'd had another season or two. As it is, I think they were a little too eager to make us accept Lindsay Weir. Drugs and sex are the reasons that parents and straight-laced students are so freaked out by freaks. But (aside from one interlude with pot) Lindsay somewhat unconvincingly manages to avoid having to deal with either while establishing a new identity as a freak. No matter. If you love quirky, quality TV, buy this set. Even the opening credits are worthwhile. (Starr's facial expressions in the school photo shoot that opens the show are priceless). I'm also left wondering: How did I live this long without discovering the album American Beauty and the song ""Box of Rain''?",5,"Avoiding the obvious, making it real",1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,2498,"['Living', 'overseas', 'missed', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'all-too-brief', 'run', 'television', 'enjoying', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'had', 'been', 'up', 'earlier', 'wow', 'most', 'powerful', 'original', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'small', 'screen', 'took', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'pilot', 'first', 'struck', 'pretty', 'bleak', 'Just', 'everyone', 'McKinley', 'High', 'School', 'seemed', 'thoroughly', 'unpleasant', 'first', 'episode', 'joyously', 'was', 'hooked', 'loved', 'way', 'writers', 'refused', 'do', 'obvious', 'thing', 'always', 'turning', 'away', 'clich', 'eacute', 'give', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'heart-breaking', 'humanity', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Coach', 'Fredericks', 'Neil', 'philandering', 'dad', 'Mr.', 'Weir', 'Gordon', 'Crisp', 'Millie', 'Mr.', 'Rosso', 'Harris', 'even', 'annoying', 'bully', 'Alan', 'regular', 'cast', 'amazing', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'Bill', 'Haverchuck', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'original', 'characters', 'TV', 'history', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Nick', 'simultaneously', 'sad', 'decent', 'creepy', 'probably', 'doomed', 'life', 'failure', 'one', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'ever', 'James', 'Franco', 'Daniel', 'charm', 'loser', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Busy', 'Phillips', 'Kim', 'Kelly', 'one', 'most', 'abrasive', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'end', 'hearts', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'character', 'here', 'Beady-eyed', 'stoic', 'sarcastic', 'Ken', 'Miller', 'nothing', 'lovable', 'man-child', 'Rogen', 'plays', 'big', 'screen', 'are', 'hints', 'change', 'later', 'episodes', 'loved', 'way', 'characters', 'look', 'so', 'real', ""'re"", 'often', 'uglier', 'folks', 'usually', 'encounter', 'TV', 'Well', 'James', 'Franco', 'Linda', 'Cardellini', 'are', 'gorgeous', ""'re"", 'dressed', 'down', 'seem', 'people', 'might', 'actually', 'see', 'school', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'Apatow', 'Paul', 'Feig', 'would', 'have', 'done', ""'d"", 'had', 'season', 'two', 'think', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'eager', 'make', 'accept', 'Lindsay', 'Weir', 'Drugs', 'sex', 'are', 'reasons', 'parents', 'straight-laced', 'students', 'are', 'so', 'freaked', 'out', 'freaks', 'aside', 'one', 'interlude', 'pot', 'Lindsay', 'somewhat', 'unconvincingly', 'avoid', 'having', 'deal', 'establishing', 'new', 'identity', 'freak', 'matter', 'love', 'quirky', 'quality', 'TV', 'buy', 'set', 'Even', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'Starr', 'facial', 'expressions', 'school', 'photo', 'shoot', 'show', 'are', 'priceless', ""'m"", 'also', 'left', 'wondering', 'How', 'did', 'live', 'long', 'discovering', 'album', 'American', 'Beauty', 'song', 'Box', 'Rain']",N/A

Although the network abruptly cut this off this series mid-funk (quoting Bill Haverchuck), it is neatly wrapped up at the end with a satisfying but bittersweet finale.  Filmed in 1999, this series was far ahead of its time, treating each episode like a mini movie-- beautifully filmed, with gorgeous cinematography-- and fully utilizing the burgeoning 'dramedy' genre like so many HBO, Showtime, and AMC shows are now finally starting to do.  You have to remember-- looking at the full context of TV in the late nineties-- that most network family shows were the tired laugh track sit-com format, making Freaks and Geeks so ground-breaking. I really feel like the show is more of an 18 hour movie rather than an 18 episode TV show.Apatow and Feig know how to treat their fans.  This DVD set includes a wealth of cute and funny commentaries featuring many of the original cast members, deleted scenes, easter eggs, etc that are on par with the quality of the episodes themselves.

802793,A3TD7HLTDWZ382,B0001EQHXO,"Pikminfan ""bobsworld3""","[6, 6]","It's finally on DVD!!!  ""Freeks and Geeks"" without a doubt has to be the most underrated television comedy/drama of all time.  It's so unfortunate that audiences didn't pick up on the clever wit of this incredible series before it was cancelled.  I guess it was just too sophisticated for most tv audiences.Simply put, Freeks and Geeks was all about subtlety in it's humor.  The show didn't  feel it was necessary to hit you over the head with a punch line then follow it up with a canned laugh track like 95% of the lame sitcoms on television today.  (I'm looking your way NBC!)  With this show, you would catch yourself laughing for the smallest of reasons.Character and warmth were also very much the backbone of this series.  Who could forget the sympathetic brother and sister relationship of freak Lindsey and geek Sam?  And who didn't find themselves cheering for Sam as he attempted to turn the attentions of the popular cheerleader Cindy?  Who could forget Nick with all of his awkward but humorous problems or Amy the troubled, spiteful ""friend"" of Lindsey?  Of course there was also Bill, the ultimate geek and Neil the geek who wanted to be chic.  Plus Millie the geeky dedicated friend of the ever changing Lindsey, and the incredibly hip, Alice Cooper singing guidance counselor?  Finally there was also Lindsey and Sam's mother with her blind optimism and their father, the polar opposite.The reason this show worked so well was that it was directed and filmed in such a way as to truely capture the awkwardness of the teenage years.  In its direction it was brutal and honest which made it seem all that more real.  I knew people in high school that were just like the characters in this series, I was one of them myself.  In the real world, we are not all pretty people who live in adorable little apartments in New York, hang out in ultra hip coffee shops, and get laid on every date we go on.  The real world is much less forgiving.  It is confusing, and uncertain, awkward, and often times harsh.  The spirit of these realities is exactly what this series captured, and it did it remarkably well.  Whether you were one the freaks in high school or one the geeks, or even one of the popular kids who wondered how the other 95% of us lived, you should be able to relate to these characters.As I mentioned before, it's a shame that more viewers didn't tune in to watch this series.  I think one of the problems was that the characters were just a little too real for most people.  They were normal looking, not glamourized and they didn't live fabulous lives or wear chic clothing.  They were simple and down to earth and that made them real.

802795,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B0001EQHXO,R.A. McKenzie,"[7, 7]","I'm gonna lay it flat - this is the greatest television show I have ever seen!  I spent four nights in a row finishing this gripping series, and can't fathom how in the hell this splendid show only got 18 episodes!Paul Feig and Judd Apatow (creator/producer) obviously really invested a lot of heart and nostalgia into this show.  Melodramatic this is not.  ""Freaks and Geeks"" is a show that knows teenagers and high school.  How often does a show allow you to see ""burnouts"" with ambitions and dreams?  And how often are those ambitions and dreams accurately portrayed as a clash against reality?  How often does a TV show seriously deal with romance and lust without the usual sex cliches?  How often does a TV show capture a generational evolution so vividly through music and dialogue?  The answers to those questions, and many other rarities you can think of, is ""probably never.""  Does ""Freaks and Geeks"" portray these events...You bet it does!The ""Freaks"" and ""Geeks"" aren't the same person stretched over 8 people.  No, each character is rich with detail, motivation, dry humor, and conflict.  Lindsey (Linda Cardenelli) is a freak who is an intellectual genius, but somehow wants to hang with teens who have no drive to excel...or do they?  You'd think not, but these ""freaks"" actually want to succeed, as everybody does.  They take the usual routes, but they want to become something significant.  Take Nick (Jason Seger) for instance.  This guy's got a hard-ass father, but still desperately wants to be a drummer, and enormous passion for his hobbies (which include a 29-piece drum set).  The problem is that Nick is always stoned.  Or take Daniel (James Franco).  This guy is an irritable piece of garbage when you first meet him, but as he says about his wicked-tongued girlfriend, ""you just to get to know 'em better.""  Well guess what, I patiently watched a few episodes, and Daniel is surprisingly charming with his pathetic manipulative methods, but doesn't come off as mean-spirited.  His somewhat bad influence on other people (like Lindsey) is actually twistedly insightful.  Let's take a look at the ""Geeks"".  Sam (John Daley, playing Lindsey's brother), is a scrawny freshie who has the damndest getting comfortable with anything.  The thing is, his rivals are actually deeply wounded and insecure (the Pilot Episode bully has more depth than you think).  So he's actually not that bad off.  I don't want to give away any more, because the less you know about this show, the more of a treasure it's gonna be.  But believe me when I say that just when you think that you're about to witness the same stereotypical teens that Apatow and Feig have set out to avoid, the most insignificant character becomes something special that grips your attention and affection.  I had no idea the gym teacher would be such a respectable man.  Counselors like Mr. Rosso are deeply profound, but just don't know that the 80s generation doesn't want to listen.You've probably met some of these characters at some point in your life.  Although this show takes place in the early 1980s, the people exist today still.  Yes, it's painful to see some of these characters make mistakes (drug experimenting, relationship troubles, difficulty fitting in), but it's also comforting to see teenagers and adults resolve these situations with realism and intelligence.  Many of life's problems are resolved with unspoken tension, and this show captures that feeling perfectly.  And guess what, you might not laugh out loud, but ""Freaks and Geeks"" shows timely events with an ironic comical touch that's unique and moving.  This show has mastered the art of comedy/drama.And after you've witnessed the greatest 18 hours of television ever produced, how about some DVD Extras that are worth checking out?  Believe me, I'm not really a big Special Features kind of DVD fan, but the Deleted Scenes serve a purpose and are equally as good as the final cut.  Plus, almost every episode has TWO Commentaries, and they're always funny and/or interesting.  You could spend up to 50 hours with this complete series, and you'll love every minute of it.The rest I'll leave to you to witness.  I have never been so inspired and awe-struck by a TV series.  I'm so excited just typing this review, that I don't even know if it makes any sense.

I missed it altogether the first time through. Though there's little obvious frisky activity and the booze and drug scenes are limited to brief experimentations, the general impression of G&F; is a reality somewhat theatrical, but close to the 1980 high school experience.  That experience has been consistent from about 1967 on.  The less popular kids live a life of overindulgent internal fantasy, as their persona is lower than dirt.  The athletes and cheerleaders have a better time of it on the surface, but suffer youth angst anyhow.Linda Cardenelli gets the most face time and she is very good, a brainiac with a loss of faith.  God doesn't exist because grandma told her so. Okay, now we'll be deadheads and live the Gerry Garcia lifestyle.  Forget that scholarship to Michigan.  I had an old Army jacket like the one she tents her body with. That's because I was in the army, but I digress. Yes, there's an undertow of progressive politics in here somewhere.  The young Republican cheerleader that John Frances Daly of the juvenile good-looks has fallen for turns out to be kind of Gerald Ford dull despite the make out sessions.There's that geek kid with the goggle glasses, Martin Starr though.

That the writing, directing, and acting are unparalleled is something everyone here has echoed, and justifiably.Like many of you, I was able to catch F&G; mostly on Fox Family after NBC torpedoed it with myriad bad executive decisions. While what you saw definitely knocked you out, it was very difficult to follow any of the running storylines with any continuity since not all episodes made were aired, and the ones that did air were run out of sequence. Add to this FF's tendency to bleep out anything harsher than ""damn"" and the fact that some of the original music (some of the best ever in a TV show) was changed due to licensing hassles. So, just the privilege of seeing all these shows, in crystal clear digital glory with 5.1 Dolby, in sequence and unedited would be well worth the retail price (we're talking over 18 hours of film here).BUT..... if you want the FREAKIEST, GEEKIEST F&G; experience, you abso-f*****-lutely have to shell out the $120 for the Special Edition box. I can not recommend this to the novice, but for the F&G; fanatic... well... let's just say sex doesn't get much better than this.

802805,A37S3ACL57LN62,B0001EQHXO,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[2, 2]","I watched a few episodes of this show when I could catch it when it ran on television, and I was excited to hear that it was to be released on DVD years later. Finally, my library got a copy I could test out and I absolutely fell in love.Freaks and Geeks is one of the most realistic, least dramatic portrayals of high school. There are the geeks, the kids who don't quite dress like everyone else but who have loads of fun together. They're nice to everyone but everything bad always seems to happen to them. Sam, Bill, and Neal are excellent characters, lovable and unstereotypical. I knew guys like that in high school and luckily was able to make friends with them, some of the best friends I ever had. The freaks are the kids I got to know later in high school, the ""burnouts"" who really could have fit in anywhere except that they didn't want to. They were really cool people without even trying. And then there were the smart kids like Millie who had the best of intentions but were smothering themselves in their own restrictions. And last, Lindsay, the girl who could get along with all of them and find the beauty in each group.The great thing about this show is the fact that each episode does not wrap up with a neat heartwarming solution to the problems; several of them go unresolved and sometimes there is no real central problem to fix. The show is littered with small gems like the geeks daring each other to eat a disgusting concoction of kitchen items, hanging out in the basement listening to music, and waiting for the school bus in the morning.There are also plenty of great cameo appearances by familiar faces such as Ben Stiller, Shia LaBeouf, Thomas F. Wilson, Joanna Garcia, Allen Covert, and more.Thanks to the enthusiastic fan base, this DVD is littered with extra features. Aside from the fact that all of the original music remains intact (a great feat considering the fate of other shows like Roswell), each episode has at least one commentary, deleted scenes, and other goodies like promos and behind the scenes footage. Perhaps only hard-core fans will want to bother with them, but I assure you that after seeing the show, most people will be hard-core fans.",5,Why Do the Greats ALWAYS Get Cancelled?,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,2192,"['watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'when', 'could', 'catch', 'when', 'ran', 'television', 'was', 'excited', 'hear', 'was', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'years', 'later', 'Finally', 'library', 'got', 'copy', 'could', 'test', 'absolutely', 'fell', 'love.Freaks', 'Geeks', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'least', 'dramatic', 'portrayals', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'geeks', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'dress', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'have', 'loads', 'fun', 'together', ""'re"", 'nice', 'everyone', 'everything', 'bad', 'always', 'happen', 'Sam', 'Bill', 'Neal', 'are', 'excellent', 'characters', 'lovable', 'unstereotypical', 'knew', 'guys', 'high', 'school', 'luckily', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'friends', 'best', 'friends', 'ever', 'had', 'freaks', 'are', 'kids', 'got', 'know', 'later', 'high', 'school', 'burnouts', 'who', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'fit', 'anywhere', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'were', 'really', 'cool', 'people', 'even', 'trying', 'then', 'were', 'smart', 'kids', 'Millie', 'who', 'had', 'best', 'intentions', 'were', 'smothering', 'own', 'restrictions', 'last', 'Lindsay', 'girl', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'find', 'beauty', 'group.The', 'great', 'thing', 'show', 'fact', 'episode', 'not', 'wrap', 'up', 'neat', 'heartwarming', 'solution', 'problems', 'several', 'go', 'unresolved', 'sometimes', 'real', 'central', 'problem', 'fix', 'show', 'littered', 'small', 'gems', 'geeks', 'daring', 'other', 'eat', 'disgusting', 'concoction', 'kitchen', 'items', 'hanging', 'out', 'basement', 'listening', 'music', 'waiting', 'school', 'bus', 'morning.There', 'are', 'also', 'plenty', 'great', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'familiar', 'such', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Thomas', 'F.', 'Wilson', 'Joanna', 'Garcia', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'more.Thanks', 'enthusiastic', 'fan', 'base', 'DVD', 'littered', 'extra', 'features', 'Aside', 'fact', 'original', 'music', 'intact', 'great', 'feat', 'considering', 'fate', 'other', 'shows', 'Roswell', 'episode', 'least', 'one', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'other', 'goodies', 'promos', 'scenes', 'footage', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'bother', 'assure', 'seeing', 'show', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'hard-core', 'fans']",N/A

I guess that I was considered one of the ""geeks"" back then, though in those days we were called ""brains"" (which I guess is more like a nerd than a geek).  I'm not sure what people called the freaks back then--perhaps just ""burnouts"" or ""heads.""  It wasn't until I went to college that I heard the term ""freak.""  In those days there were also ""greasers"" in my high school--who tended to be in conflict with the freaks to some degree.I loved the episode where the home basketball team McKinley Norsemen square off against rival Lincoln High School--starting with the hilarious slogan ""Assassinate Lincoln!""  The funniest, most ironic, and most unexpected turn, is where the Freaks get drinks thrown at them from a Lincoln drive by.  This insult leads to fight with Lincoln students--and finally with the Freaks actually attending the basketball game against Lincoln.  James Franco is unforgettable with his completely wild and over the top cheering for the Norsemen!

Inside my family we've had many a satisfying conversation about who we love the most -- and it's hard to choose: the eternally hip square Mr. Rosso, the huggable Sam, the ballsy but painfully vulnerable Neil, Bill whose charms definitely grow on a person, the Lady L and her indefatigable wooer Nick, sloe-eyed Daniel and his callous moll Kim, mom and dad?

802825,AP3B615GM191G,B0001EQHXO,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 12]","As a fan of quality television series, I kept hearing about how good this little slice of silver screen high school life was, so I finally decided to give it a try.  Sadly, only 4-5 episodes in, I gave up due to the fact that it just didn't do a thing to suck me in.For a basic plot summary of ""Freaks & Geeks"", the show centers on two siblings: Lindsay Weir (Linda Cardellini), who rebels against her math-lete past to start hanging out with the ""burn-outs"", and Sam Weir (John Francis Daley), a dorky, underdeveloped nerd who is trying to grow into his new high school role.While I had heard this show described as sort of a ""Wonder Years for the 1980s"", I was ultimately disappointed for a number of reasons...-Despite featuring some decent actors, the acting itself seems mediocre.  Only the two leads really impressed me and made me feel as if I should care about them whatsoever.-I don't feel that the show ever really found its niche in terms of what it wanted to accomplish.  It seemed like it wanted to break down stereotypes, first and foremost, but then at the same time was quite predictable in terms of character development.  Never once did I feel as if my conception of 1980s high school was being challenged or even satiated in any meaningful way.-The auxiliary characters are cardboard at best.  For example, the Weir parents are little more than goofy caricatures and do absolutely nothing to advance the storyline or inject any emotion into the proceedings.While perhaps I needed to grow up during that time period to truly understand its nuances, I can't let this show ""off the hook"" on that theory, as I didn't grow up in the 1960s, either, yet I still thoroughly enjoyed ""The Wonder Years"".I realize that this show is considered a television classic, but I personally just do not quite understand why.  I usually finish what I start in terms of TV watching, but on this occasion I felt like I was wasting my time investing in this series (short even as it was).  Am I missing something crucial to the show's development that happened in the mid-to-late episodes?

You often here this show listed in the best of the 00's and how it was canceled too soon. Does the show live up to the hype? I believe so.I watched the first episodes alone but my sister starting to join in and began to obsesses over it. Just from the beginning of watching this series, you know it is not your typical sitcom. It deals with complex and interesting issues (particularly in the episode ""The Little Things"") and characters that are well expanded beyond specific stereotypes. As the story moves on, it is almost becomes depressing and sad. The relationships between the characters develop, and fall apart, and come to new realizations.Another aspect of the show I enjoyed was that it was set in 1980 through 1981. I really like the early 80's but hate the late 80's. Picking to start from this time period was a good choice. I loved The Jerk, Stripes, and The Who references, hehe. But do not expect this to be like Happy Days or That 70's Show, it is about relationships and uses the setting as a background, not something that pushes the plot and characters around!If I had to complain about one thing, it would be that the seasons never really change. It always feels like summer, and from someone who has lived in Michigan their whole entire life, this definitely is not true! We have extremely harsh winters and wet - often very cold - springs.In conclusion, Freaks and Geeks ended up being a good purchase. It would have been nice to have a Second Season but this will due.
