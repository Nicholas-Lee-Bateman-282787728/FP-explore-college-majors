529449,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00003CXN1,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[7, 8]","The term &quot;Whipped&quot; doesn't refer to sadomasochism or military discipline.  Put the familiar term that starts with &quot;p&quot; and refers to a kitty-cat before &quot;Whipped&quot; and you'll understand what this sexual comedy is all about.The plot involves four male New Yorkers who attended college together and have remained tight over the intervening five or so years.  They get together once a week or so for brunch at a diner and regale each other with (highly dubious, the film suggests) tales of their sexual conquests.  One of the four is married and doesn't worry about outlet as much as going crazy living under the same roof with another human being.Of the three bachelors, one is a tall, blond Wall Street yuppie who truly thinks he is God's gift to women.  He and his co-workers love to get soused each Friday evening and start hitting on the girls in a bar.  The middle character is a very &quot;downtown,&quot; stylish, would-be writer who does most of his cruising passively while writing in his journal in a coffee house.  He thinks that being an artiste entitles him to have no sexual ethics at all.  The third fellow's sexual escapades are entirely fiction and inspired by the two dozen or so creams and lotions that sit on the shelf of his shower stall.  The other guys are on to this onanist and his stories of imaginary women like &quot;Nivea,&quot; but tolerate him anyway.A confident, smart and funny woman (Amanda Peet) happens to run into the first character in the yuppie bar.  Pretty soon they're an item.  The second character notices her eyeing him up in the coffee house and pretty soon, they're going together.  (Going steady, he thinks.)  Our Heroine bumps into the third guy next to a magazine stand where he has just purchased a bundle of soft-core pornography. After a lot of shyness on his part, they eventually hook up too.It doesn't take too much time for the fellows to realize that their buddies have meet this woman through unbelievable coincidence (which is explained at the movie's end).  None of them want to relinquish this &quot;catch&quot; and they all insist on staying with her, which makes the male relationship deteriorate from bonding to distrust to outright hostility.  The Peet character plays the boys with the expert assurance of a prize-winning angler reeling in a marlin.I hope guys have a sense of humor about this movie; I think many young women will love it.  The men are portrayed as shallow, chauvinistic swine who aren't quite as good-looking and studly as they think they are.  Their sexual starvation is so pathetic that, perversely, it becomes one of their few saving graces.  When a guy is thinking with something other than his brain, he will go to pitiful lengths to keep a sexual liaison intact.Amanda Peet is just wonderful in this contradictory role that requires her to be sunny, sweet, smart, fast, and totally unscrupulous in the way she handles and manipulates these men.  A surprise ending explains why things have happened the way they are.  Truly, what's sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose.Truly, I am not a prude and I don't mind a profane movie.  But other than the coy title, this film has an incredible amount of raunchy (and repetitive) dialog.  When the guys get together, their talk is so filthy that I often wondered why they didn't get ejected from their favorite diner.  The obscene remarks are not rendered with the psychological precision of a David Mamet; they seem to be there simply to telegraph anger.  &quot;A-hole&quot; and &quot;[blank] you&quot; get tossed around so frequently you wonder if these guys really attended college together, their vocabulary is so limited.If you can handle this fairly graphic farce, it really is quite enjoyable and even insightful about people who have just enlisted in the Battle of the Sexes.  The surprise ending is wonderful.  Amanda Peet is terrific, and the cinematic unknowns who play the guys are top-notch too.  Definitely not a film for Aunt Agatha, but it satirizes sexual mores and attitudes of twentysomething urban males ruthlessly and effectively.  A good, solid, delightfully dirty movie that will appeal to lots of folks.",4,Sleazy Sexual Ethics Have Never Been So Entertaining...,1001462400,"09 26, 2001",2001,4190,"['term', 'quot', 'Whipped', 'quot', ""n't"", 'refer', 'sadomasochism', 'military', 'discipline', 'Put', 'familiar', 'term', 'quot', 'quot', 'refers', 'kitty-cat', 'quot', 'Whipped', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'sexual', 'comedy', 'about.The', 'plot', 'four', 'male', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'who', 'attended', 'college', 'together', 'have', 'remained', 'tight', 'intervening', 'five', 'so', 'years', 'get', 'together', 'once', 'week', 'so', 'brunch', 'diner', 'regale', 'other', 'highly', 'dubious', 'film', 'tales', 'sexual', 'conquests', 'One', 'four', 'married', ""n't"", 'worry', 'about', 'outlet', 'as', 'much', 'going', 'crazy', 'living', 'same', 'roof', 'human', 'being.Of', 'three', 'bachelors', 'one', 'tall', 'blond', 'Wall', 'Street', 'yuppie', 'who', 'truly', 'God', 'gift', 'women', 'co-workers', 'love', 'get', 'soused', 'Friday', 'evening', 'start', 'hitting', 'girls', 'bar', 'middle', 'character', 'very', 'quot', 'downtown', 'quot', 'stylish', 'would-be', 'writer', 'who', 'most', 'cruising', 'passively', 'writing', 'journal', 'coffee', 'house', 'being', 'artiste', 'have', 'sexual', 'ethics', 'third', 'fellow', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'are', 'entirely', 'fiction', 'inspired', 'two', 'dozen', 'so', 'creams', 'lotions', 'sit', 'shelf', 'shower', 'stall', 'other', 'guys', 'are', 'onanist', 'stories', 'imaginary', 'women', 'quot', 'Nivea', 'quot', 'tolerate', 'anyway.A', 'confident', 'smart', 'funny', 'woman', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'run', 'first', 'character', 'yuppie', 'bar', 'Pretty', 'soon', ""'re"", 'item', 'second', 'character', 'notices', 'eyeing', 'up', 'coffee', 'house', 'pretty', 'soon', ""'re"", 'going', 'together', 'Going', 'steady', 'Heroine', 'bumps', 'third', 'guy', 'magazine', 'stand', 'where', 'just', 'purchased', 'bundle', 'soft-core', 'pornography', 'lot', 'shyness', 'part', 'eventually', 'hook', 'up', 'too.It', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'fellows', 'realize', 'buddies', 'have', 'meet', 'woman', 'unbelievable', 'coincidence', 'explained', 'movie', 'end', 'None', 'want', 'relinquish', 'quot', 'catch', 'quot', 'insist', 'staying', 'male', 'relationship', 'deteriorate', 'bonding', 'distrust', 'outright', 'hostility', 'Peet', 'character', 'boys', 'expert', 'assurance', 'prize-winning', 'angler', 'reeling', 'marlin.I', 'hope', 'guys', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'movie', 'think', 'many', 'young', 'women', 'will', 'love', 'men', 'are', 'portrayed', 'shallow', 'chauvinistic', 'swine', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'good-looking', 'studly', 'think', 'are', 'sexual', 'starvation', 'so', 'pathetic', 'perversely', 'one', 'few', 'saving', 'graces', 'When', 'guy', 'thinking', 'something', 'other', 'brain', 'will', 'go', 'pitiful', 'lengths', 'keep', 'sexual', 'liaison', 'intact.Amanda', 'Peet', 'just', 'wonderful', 'contradictory', 'role', 'be', 'sunny', 'sweet', 'smart', 'fast', 'totally', 'unscrupulous', 'way', 'men', 'surprise', 'ending', 'explains', 'why', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'way', 'are', 'Truly', 'what', 'sauce', 'gander', 'sauce', 'goose.Truly', 'am', 'not', 'prude', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'profane', 'movie', 'other', 'coy', 'title', 'film', 'incredible', 'amount', 'raunchy', 'repetitive', 'dialog', 'When', 'guys', 'get', 'together', 'talk', 'so', 'filthy', 'often', 'wondered', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'ejected', 'favorite', 'diner', 'obscene', 'remarks', 'are', 'not', 'rendered', 'psychological', 'precision', 'David', 'Mamet', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'simply', 'telegraph', 'anger', 'quot', 'A-hole', 'quot', 'quot', '[', 'blank', ']', 'quot', 'get', 'tossed', 'so', 'frequently', 'wonder', 'guys', 'really', 'attended', 'college', 'together', 'vocabulary', 'so', 'limited.If', 'can', 'handle', 'fairly', 'graphic', 'farce', 'really', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'insightful', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'enlisted', 'Battle', 'Sexes', 'surprise', 'ending', 'wonderful', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'terrific', 'cinematic', 'unknowns', 'who', 'play', 'guys', 'are', 'top-notch', 'too', 'Definitely', 'not', 'film', 'Aunt', 'Agatha', 'sexual', 'mores', 'attitudes', 'twentysomething', 'urban', 'males', 'ruthlessly', 'effectively', 'good', 'solid', 'delightfully', 'dirty', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'lots', 'folks']",Whipped

I think that this was the film that got me noticing her, the next film I remember her in after that was the great ""Saving Silverman"". Man when I first watched this movie I was living in Maryland and had bought this movie at Blockbuster just cause. It turned out to be a good thing I did because I absolutely loved this movie, as did my friends. After taking my usual route walking home I decided to go over to my friends house, everyone was there and we watched this drinking red Kool Aid [love it]. Once it was over I realized that everyone in the room loved it as much as me, and we were all laughing out loud.For some reason people hate on this movie but I thought it was brilliant, everyone around me agrees 100%. The film is all about a group of friends [the jock type guy, the smooth type guy, and the loser guy who makes his stories up] that meet at a restaurant once a week to talk about their adventures with women, the unwanted friend there is the married guy. One day they all meet this one girl who one by one they all fall in love with, when they find out they are all going out with her the go to war. The film is so funny because I know for a fact that women can do this to guys, turn best friends on one another. Of course there is a nice little twist at the end that adds to the laughs, poor guys.Writer/director/producer Peter M. Cohen did a really great job. The film is very funny, and pits men's hunger for more women vs. evil women [ha ha]. I think this man may have had experienced something like this because it feels so real. And all the actors in this film do outstanding jobs; the married guy and the loser guy in particular are great.

529457,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00003CXN1,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","&quot;Whipped&quot; opens with three guys having their weekly Sunday brunch at a New York diner.  We have Brad (Brian Van Holt), the lady-killer with the high-paying job on Wall Street, Zeke (Zorie Barber), the intellectual type who spends his days writing in coffee houses, and the overly sensitive Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams), who apparently does not do anything other than wish he was at good as &quot;scamming&quot; as his two buddies.  While Brad uses the &quot;you look like my sister's friend&quot; scam to score and Zeke brings home two babes who proceed to steal his television set, Jonathan's sexual experiences involve &quot;Keri,&quot; named for his hand lotion de jour.  At their next meeting all three have stories about a woman they met during the week who might actually prove there is something better than scamming.  But as each relates their story, we realize it is all the same woman, which is exactly what all three guys discover when they all arrive at the apartment of Mia (Amanda Peete).  Despite some initial awkwardness, none of them are willing to back off from the new relationship.  Of course, each is convinced he is Mia's true love and the lady does nothing to dissuade any of them, to the consternation of their married friend Eric (Judah Domke), who lives vicariously for their erotic experiences.Writer-Producer-Director Peter M. Cohen writes snappy dialogue replete with expletives and he is concerned not only with the relationships these guys have with the mysterious Mia but with each other as well.  The obvious influences on Cohen's style as writer-director would be Quentin Tarantino, Woody Allen and the Farley Brothers.  There are comic vignettes, including a few crude ones that do not fit the overall tone of the film and caused ratings concerns.  For all their interest in scamming, it simply never dawns on these guys that they would ever meet a woman they would not want to sleep with on the first date or that any woman could ever come between them as friends.  Their protestations of special feelings for Mia would suggest that these guys are not as shallow as they seem, but in the end there is nothing to really suggest they are not either emotionally immature or sterile.The performances of male actors are adequate, given that they are playing characters rather than real people, but it is Amanda Peet' who holds the story together.  If we do not believe that these guys find her desirable, the whole thing gets flushed down the toilet (you'll understand that one after you watch the film).  It would have been nice if Whipped had been her breakout film, but better luck next time.  In terms of extra features all this DVD offers are trailers and a commentary track Cohen, who impressed me by addressing a lot of the questions that came to my mind as I watched the film (e.g., how come there's no nudity for a film that is so much about sex?).  An above average commentary track to be sure.  Ultimately, the main problem with &quot;Whipped&quot; is that when we get to the rather predictable twist at the end of the film it is hard to tell if this is just the final punch line or a more cynical statement on contemporary relationships between the sexes.",4,Peter Cohen's rather cynical take on the battle of the sexes,991008000,"05 28, 2001",2001,3208,"['quot', 'Whipped', 'quot', 'three', 'guys', 'having', 'weekly', 'Sunday', 'brunch', 'New', 'York', 'diner', 'have', 'Brad', 'Brian', 'Van', 'Holt', 'lady-killer', 'high-paying', 'job', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Zeke', 'Zorie', 'Barber', 'intellectual', 'type', 'who', 'days', 'writing', 'coffee', 'houses', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'Jonathan', 'Jonathan', 'Abrahams', 'who', 'apparently', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'wish', 'was', 'good', 'quot', 'scamming', 'quot', 'two', 'buddies', 'Brad', 'quot', 'look', 'sister', 'friend', 'quot', 'scam', 'score', 'Zeke', 'home', 'two', 'babes', 'who', 'proceed', 'steal', 'television', 'set', 'Jonathan', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'involve', 'quot', 'Keri', 'quot', 'named', 'hand', 'lotion', 'jour', 'next', 'meeting', 'three', 'have', 'stories', 'woman', 'met', 'week', 'who', 'might', 'actually', 'prove', 'something', 'better', 'scamming', 'story', 'realize', 'same', 'woman', 'exactly', 'what', 'three', 'guys', 'discover', 'when', 'arrive', 'apartment', 'Mia', 'Amanda', 'Peete', 'initial', 'awkwardness', 'none', 'are', 'willing', 'back', 'off', 'new', 'relationship', 'course', 'convinced', 'Mia', 'true', 'love', 'lady', 'nothing', 'dissuade', 'consternation', 'married', 'friend', 'Eric', 'Judah', 'Domke', 'who', 'vicariously', 'erotic', 'experiences.Writer-Producer-Director', 'Peter', 'M.', 'Cohen', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'replete', 'expletives', 'concerned', 'not', 'only', 'relationships', 'guys', 'have', 'mysterious', 'Mia', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'obvious', 'influences', 'Cohen', 'style', 'writer-director', 'would', 'be', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Farley', 'Brothers', 'are', 'comic', 'vignettes', 'including', 'few', 'crude', 'ones', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'caused', 'ratings', 'concerns', 'interest', 'scamming', 'simply', 'never', 'dawns', 'guys', 'would', 'ever', 'meet', 'woman', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'sleep', 'first', 'date', 'woman', 'could', 'ever', 'come', 'friends', 'protestations', 'special', 'feelings', 'Mia', 'would', 'suggest', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'shallow', 'seem', 'end', 'nothing', 'really', 'suggest', 'are', 'not', 'either', 'emotionally', 'immature', 'sterile.The', 'performances', 'male', 'actors', 'are', 'adequate', 'given', 'are', 'playing', 'characters', 'rather', 'real', 'people', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'who', 'story', 'together', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'guys', 'find', 'desirable', 'whole', 'thing', 'flushed', 'down', 'toilet', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'one', 'watch', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Whipped', 'had', 'been', 'breakout', 'film', 'better', 'luck', 'next', 'time', 'terms', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'offers', 'are', 'trailers', 'commentary', 'track', 'Cohen', 'who', 'impressed', 'addressing', 'lot', 'questions', 'came', 'mind', 'watched', 'film', 'e.g.', 'how', 'come', 'nudity', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'sex', 'above', 'average', 'commentary', 'track', 'be', 'sure', 'Ultimately', 'main', 'problem', 'quot', 'Whipped', 'quot', 'when', 'get', 'rather', 'predictable', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'hard', 'tell', 'just', 'final', 'punch', 'line', 'more', 'cynical', 'statement', 'contemporary', 'relationships', 'sexes']",Whipped

The execution of that twist is well-done and works to inject interesting irony under the humor. But that's really the only thing going in the whole plot. The conflict development happens a little bit late in the movie, which makes it something of a slow start. (Just a little.

529466,A11JU33HMT5XPU,B00003CXN1,"S. Lawrenz ""Lendorien""","[18, 24]","SynopsisBrad, Zeke and Jonathan along with their adulterous married friend Eric sleep around brazenly until they meet the cute and sexy Mia (Amanda Pete).  As each of the men seeks her affections (her carnal ones), they suddenly become aware that she has been dating all of them at once.  It becomes a battle to decide which guy will get her in the end, and a question of whether their friendships can survive the inevitable climactic decision she makes.About the Movie:It amazes me sometimes at what studios and directors think makes for great entertainment.  Writer/Director Peter Cohen proves the stereotype of men that he's trying to play on in this movie just by the mere fact that he made it.  He seems to try to say that women can be a lot like men in their philandering and mind games, but he clearly misses the irony of the whole situation. It says a whole lot about his OWN character in that he made a movie that only hornball men would ever want to watch.Whipped represents what has become standard with many Gen-X comedies these days, unoriginal sexual romps filled with disgusting toilet humor, gross sexual gags (Gagging being the operative word here), constant swearing and attractive women without their clothes on (but without the nudity...).  While, I can find that last thing appealing, it's the rest that completely turned me off of this movie.This movie deliberately tries to be disgusting and shameless, and it succeeds easily, while at the same time, undoubtedly turning off a good portion of its audience.  Not that it would matter to the director, whose characters brazenly talk about gross sexual acts in public places without turning a single head. He also seems to think (based on the synopsis on the back cover) that his disgusting male characters are ""typical males.""  Obviously, he considers people like me as ""abnormal"" and ""big prudes"" in that I DON'T do and talk about those things.But honestly, what makes any of this stuff funny?  Why would a man sticking his arm into a toilet filled with urine to retrieve something he dropped into it be considered funny?  Why would I think characters discussing their gross bodily function sex experiences were funny?  Why would a man cheating on his spouse be funny?It's not funny and it really is in incredibly poor taste.  But matters like ""Taste"" obviously don't matter these days, in a time where the lowest common denominator has become the goal to strive for.  Indeed, this movie is eagerly following the gross-out trend set by movies like American Pie.But honestly, in terms of pure sexual comedy, there are quite a few films that manage to be funnier without the gross-out factor and the complete and total disregard for taste.And taste is only half of it. In real life, men like these very quickly end up with sexually transmitted diseases (like AIDS, which is killing tens of millions all over the world, as you read this).  And like many movies, the director seems to think that all that irresponsible and dangerous sexual activity is all right, just so long as you mention the word ""condom"" at least once.As for the movie itself?  This is a forgettable one. Many of the comic gags pulled in this film are worn out overused clich&eacute;s that have been used a thousand times before. The screenplay itself is not that well written, and while some of the actors do a moderately decent job (Amanda Peet being one), many of the performances come off as weak and over the top.  The incessant swearing of the actors (that the director mistakenly seems to equate with ""realism"") doesn't help any.Then there's the story itself, of a women putting it over on philandering men...  It's been done many times before, often in far better films than this one.Honestly? This movie isn't worth the time of most viewers.  Of course, if the viewer happens to like gross bathroom and sex humor, then this movie may just be for them after all.About the DVD:Whipped comes in a plastic hard case on a double sided DVD with both fullscreen and widescreen versions in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. It has not been translated into any other languages besides its original English, though it does contain English, French and Spanish subtitles.  Both the video and audio transfer appear to be very good. Even on a high resolution screen, the video had only a little grain and few artifacts.As far as special features, this DVD contains the theatrical trailers and a director's commentary. I honestly didn't have the desire to watch the movie again, so I can't say whether or not the commentary is worth the time to listen to.Bottom Line: A gross, unexciting and unoriginal movie on basic no frills DVD release. If you think bathroom humor is disgusting, this is one to avoid. 1 Star.",1,Can someone please put this movie out of its misery?,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,4737,"['SynopsisBrad', 'Zeke', 'Jonathan', 'adulterous', 'married', 'friend', 'Eric', 'sleep', 'brazenly', 'meet', 'cute', 'sexy', 'Mia', 'Amanda', 'Pete', 'men', 'affections', 'carnal', 'ones', 'suddenly', 'become', 'aware', 'been', 'dating', 'once', 'battle', 'decide', 'guy', 'will', 'get', 'end', 'question', 'friendships', 'can', 'survive', 'inevitable', 'climactic', 'decision', 'makes.About', 'Movie', 'sometimes', 'what', 'studios', 'directors', 'think', 'great', 'entertainment', 'Writer/Director', 'Peter', 'Cohen', 'stereotype', 'men', 'trying', 'play', 'movie', 'just', 'mere', 'fact', 'made', 'try', 'say', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'men', 'philandering', 'mind', 'games', 'clearly', 'irony', 'whole', 'situation', 'whole', 'lot', 'OWN', 'character', 'made', 'movie', 'only', 'hornball', 'men', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'watch.Whipped', 'become', 'standard', 'many', 'Gen-X', 'comedies', 'days', 'unoriginal', 'sexual', 'romps', 'filled', 'disgusting', 'toilet', 'humor', 'gross', 'sexual', 'gags', 'Gagging', 'being', 'operative', 'word', 'here', 'constant', 'swearing', 'attractive', 'women', 'clothes', 'nudity', 'can', 'find', 'last', 'thing', 'appealing', 'rest', 'completely', 'turned', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'deliberately', 'be', 'disgusting', 'shameless', 'easily', 'same', 'time', 'undoubtedly', 'turning', 'off', 'good', 'portion', 'audience', 'Not', 'would', 'matter', 'director', 'characters', 'brazenly', 'talk', 'gross', 'sexual', 'acts', 'public', 'places', 'turning', 'single', 'head', 'also', 'think', 'based', 'synopsis', 'back', 'cover', 'disgusting', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'typical', 'males', 'Obviously', 'people', 'abnormal', 'big', 'prudes', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'do', 'talk', 'things.But', 'honestly', 'what', 'stuff', 'funny', 'Why', 'would', 'man', 'sticking', 'arm', 'toilet', 'filled', 'urine', 'retrieve', 'something', 'dropped', 'be', 'considered', 'funny', 'Why', 'would', 'think', 'characters', 'discussing', 'gross', 'bodily', 'function', 'sex', 'experiences', 'were', 'funny', 'Why', 'would', 'man', 'cheating', 'spouse', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'funny', 'really', 'incredibly', 'poor', 'taste', 'matters', 'Taste', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'days', 'time', 'where', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'become', 'goal', 'strive', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'eagerly', 'following', 'gross-out', 'trend', 'set', 'movies', 'American', 'Pie.But', 'honestly', 'terms', 'pure', 'sexual', 'comedy', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'manage', 'be', 'funnier', 'gross-out', 'factor', 'complete', 'total', 'disregard', 'taste.And', 'taste', 'only', 'half', 'real', 'life', 'men', 'very', 'quickly', 'end', 'up', 'sexually', 'transmitted', 'diseases', 'AIDS', 'killing', 'tens', 'millions', 'world', 'read', 'many', 'movies', 'director', 'think', 'irresponsible', 'dangerous', 'sexual', 'activity', 'right', 'just', 'so', 'long', 'mention', 'word', 'condom', 'least', 'once.As', 'movie', 'forgettable', 'one', 'Many', 'comic', 'gags', 'pulled', 'film', 'are', 'worn', 'out', 'overused', 'clich', 'eacute', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'thousand', 'times', 'screenplay', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'written', 'actors', 'do', 'moderately', 'decent', 'job', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'being', 'one', 'many', 'performances', 'come', 'off', 'weak', 'top', 'incessant', 'swearing', 'actors', 'director', 'mistakenly', 'equate', 'realism', ""n't"", 'help', 'any.Then', 'story', 'women', 'putting', 'philandering', 'men', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'often', 'far', 'better', 'films', 'one.Honestly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'most', 'viewers', 'course', 'viewer', 'like', 'gross', 'bathroom', 'sex', 'humor', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'DVD', 'Whipped', 'plastic', 'hard', 'case', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD', 'fullscreen', 'widescreen', 'versions', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'sound', 'not', 'been', 'translated', 'other', 'languages', 'original', 'English', 'contain', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'video', 'audio', 'transfer', 'appear', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'Even', 'high', 'resolution', 'screen', 'video', 'had', 'only', 'little', 'grain', 'few', 'artifacts.As', 'far', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'director', 'commentary', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'desire', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'commentary', 'time', 'listen', 'to.Bottom', 'Line', 'gross', 'unexciting', 'unoriginal', 'movie', 'basic', 'frills', 'DVD', 'release', 'think', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'disgusting', 'one', 'avoid', '1', 'Star']",Whipped
