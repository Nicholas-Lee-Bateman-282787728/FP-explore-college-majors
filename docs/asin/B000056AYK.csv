568633,ACSMIC0VD979T,B000056AYK,BluRay Boy,"[4, 7]","I just got this movie because of the reviews from Amazon and boy what a waste.  This is a VERY low-budget piece of crap.  Very boring story and I've seen better acting in a high school play. The main characters are named Dez &amp; Dazzy.  That should have tipped me off right there. On the back cover it reads &quot;Dazzy his BEAUTIFUL girlfriend.&quot;  Well, her ugly face was the biggest HORRORVISION in the whole movie.  Who did the casting for this movie?? STEVIE WONDER!  Well, whoever they should find a new profession.  For the people who liked this movie, watch Halloween you will be thrilled.

It's so bad that when you listen to the commentary track on the DVD, you find out that even the writer, director, producer, etc think it's horrible.  They tell a few things about the movie and how they made it, but most of it is talking about how the movie is horrible, utter garbage.  They talk about how no one is probably hearing what they're saying, because they already shut it off, took it back to the rental store, and threw it in the employee's face.  The movie itself seems like a waste of time.  Why did they make it, when it seems they only put 1% of effort into it?  They even talk like the movie was so under- budget it couldn't be made right.  Stay away from this movie, no matter what you do.  If you see Full Moon or Tempe Video on any movies, it's probably a good idea to stay away from all of them....I have yet to see these two groups release anything even close to watchable.",1,"So bad, the filmmakers diss it on the commentary track!!",990921600,"05 27, 2001",2001,931,"['movie', 'bad', 'mean', 'so', 'bad', 'when', 'listen', 'commentary', 'track', 'DVD', 'find', 'out', 'even', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'etc', 'think', 'horrible', 'tell', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'how', 'made', 'most', 'talking', 'how', 'movie', 'horrible', 'utter', 'garbage', 'talk', 'how', 'one', 'probably', 'hearing', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', 'already', 'shut', 'off', 'took', 'back', 'rental', 'store', 'threw', 'employee', 'face', 'movie', 'waste', 'time', 'Why', 'did', 'make', 'when', 'only', 'put', '1', '%', 'effort', 'even', 'talk', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'under-', 'budget', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'right', 'Stay', 'away', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'see', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Tempe', 'Video', 'movies', 'probably', 'good', 'idea', 'stay', 'away', '.I', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'two', 'groups', 'release', 'anything', 'even', 'close', 'watchable']",N/A

In fact, I think this is the first Full Moon release I've seen that took a serious stride. HorrorVision tells the story of Sed, a technology freak who is losing friends to a mysterious website. After he loses his girlfriend, it looks like all hope is lost from this guy. After being attacked by a techno-pede (my word for the creature that resembled a centipede but was all metal), he runs into a mysterious man who helps him on his quest to discover the truth behind HorrorVision.com. I believe if they worked on this a bit more, and made the gore a bit more believable, it would've worked well if it had been widely released. The acting was real good for Full Moon, and the directing was quiet good also. Although there were things not needed in the movie, I think it was a pretty fair release from Full Moon. The ending left it open for a sequel, which I hope will be a tad better if there is one.",3,Fair Full Moon Release,987897600,"04 22, 2001",2001,983,"['always', 'look', 'fun', 'Full', 'Moon', 'releases', 'Horrorvision', 'was', 'serious', 'fact', 'think', 'first', 'Full', 'Moon', 'release', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'took', 'serious', 'stride', 'HorrorVision', 'story', 'Sed', 'technology', 'freak', 'who', 'losing', 'friends', 'mysterious', 'website', 'girlfriend', 'hope', 'lost', 'guy', 'being', 'attacked', 'techno-pede', 'word', 'creature', 'resembled', 'centipede', 'was', 'metal', 'mysterious', 'man', 'who', 'quest', 'discover', 'truth', 'HorrorVision.com', 'believe', 'worked', 'bit', 'more', 'made', 'gore', 'bit', 'more', 'believable', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'well', 'had', 'been', 'widely', 'released', 'acting', 'was', 'real', 'good', 'Full', 'Moon', 'directing', 'was', 'quiet', 'good', 'also', 'were', 'things', 'not', 'needed', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'fair', 'release', 'Full', 'Moon', 'ending', 'left', 'open', 'sequel', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'tad', 'better', 'one']",N/A
568636,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000056AYK,Joshua Koppel,"[0, 1]","I really don't know what to make of this film.  It starts out in a sinister way, moves into a Matrix clone, and ends before the story really begins.  The story centers around a software genius who is running an erotic site to help pay the bills.  He gets pictures from Brinke Stevens (whose presence does nothing to save the film).  A web site called HorrorVision seems to be at the heart of a technological revolution/evolution.  Accessing the site seems to bring technology to life.Bradbury, a guy copied from Fishburne's character from the Matrix films, has the lowdown on what is going on and claims our hero has a special quality and can stop the rise of the machines (does this sound familiar?).  There are several others on a list that Bradbury carries than can help.  And that is about as far as the movie goes.  Our hero sets out to find the others and the credits roll.  Waste of time.This is a Full Moon presentation and it looks like they were hoping for another string of films like Puppet Master, Bloodstone, or Trancers but never got to the second film.  While films in these series did sometimes end unfinished on a cliffhanger they never did it with the first one.  Since it seems the story will never be finished, there is little reason to watch the beginning.

It has terrible acting and an even worse story line. This movie couldn't even scare my 8 year old son. The reviewers that gave this a five star rating most have been paid off because that is the only way it could get anything but one star. I would give it less, but the lowest I could go is one star.
