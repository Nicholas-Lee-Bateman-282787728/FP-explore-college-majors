573155,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000059HAN,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","On the face of it today a story about an impoverished, hard-nosed widowed woman trying to support several children working in a southern textile mill and who seeks to unionize the plant against one of the major textile companies might rate a documentary or docu-drama treatment but, perhaps not much else. The demographics and the audience would probably not be there for such a commercial endeavor, Sally Field or no Sally Field. That says more about the state of the organized labor movement in this country, the dramatic decline in union membership, the lack of recent successful major union organizing drives, the ""globalization"" of industry that has de-industrialized America and the attenuation of links between the old trade union movement forged in the class battles of the 1930s and 1940s and their grandchildren, today's youth.Back in 1973, however, this film was a hit not only because of the well-done performances by Sally Fields, as that down-troddened but spirited woman turned effective union organizer and Ron Liebman, as the northern union organizer called in to advice (?) Norma Rae. 1950s ""red scare"" black-listed writer Martin Ritt, who directed this film, also deserves kudos for not overburdening the film with unnecessary sentimentality. The times then thus were not out of joint for such an effort. The residue of 1960s radicalism and pro-working class sentiments still hung in the air. Moreover, the times were just becoming ripe for serious films about the trials and tribulations of women, especially working women and their problems, under the sign of the burgeoning women's movement.Of courser this particular review is posted here today because, unfortunately, the real-life model for the character of Norma Rae Crystal Lee Sutton has just passed away in North Carolina at the age of 68. I will finish up here by quoting a remark that I made in another space about her passing that also reflects on the highlight dramatically tense moment in the film:""No labor militant, or even just a simple friend of the international labor movement could do anything but cheer at that moment in ""Norma Rae"", based on the actual experience of Crystal Lee Sutton, when Sally Field silently holds up a handmade sign that said ""Union""- and everyone downs tools. Such events are the stuff not just of labor legend, but under the right circumstances revolution. Farewell, Sister.""

573156,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000059HAN,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","There are a lot of films about the overworked and underappreciated finally standing up for themselves and fighting for what they know they are owed; but `Norma Rae' is a notch above most of them.  Not only is it moving but it is engrossing and enlightening.  It works its magic in all areas of the film; shedding light on the issues, gathering our support and fleshing out three-dimensional characters we love, love to hate and even hate to love.Norma is a small town girl who is doing what she's been brought up to do.  She's a widow who is raising her two children while living with her overprotective father and working in the same mill as her parents.  She is going nowhere fast, but she doesn't know any better.  Then Reuben shows up in her town and tosses her whole life upside down.  Reuben is a unionizer from New York who is determined to make things better for the working class people in the area.  He only needs to rally enough support from the likes of Norma, and after she witnesses what the corrupt men in power are willing to do to prevent the union she becomes all the more determined to get it passed.What is so wonderful about `Norma Rae' is that it is as much about the woman that is Norma as it is about the union she so fervently wants to get passed.  The film is interested in her as a person, and thus we become interested in her; in her family life, her love life, her past and her eventual future.  The film's primary interest is focused on her dedication to the union, but it also gives ample time to build her relationship with her small town boyfriend/husband Sonny as well as her budding relationship with Reuben.The film is multilayered.Sally Field won her first Oscar for her riveting portrayal of Norma.  It's funny; when the film starts we get a taste of overacting at its finest with Norma screaming at her boss about how her mother is deaf because of the noise in the mill.  I immediately began to wonder if this was going to be one of those flashy performances that is almost all show and no depth.  I said a silent prayer that Field not scream through this whole movie and my prayer was instantly answered.  Yes, Field is impeccable here, capturing the essence of this woman with steely determination.  Some of her quieter scenes are her most captivating; especially when she confesses to her husband that Reuben is in her head.  That scene is instantly stolen from her though, but her co-star Beau Bridges who grabs your heart with when he responds that no one else is in his head by Norma.  Beau has gotten the shaft over the years.  I guess that's what happens when your brother is Jeff Bridges.  I must tell you though, Beau is a talent all his own.  His performance here is beyond words.  He is so moving, so sincere and so lovable.Every husband should strive to be more like him, and every woman would be lucky to find a man like him.`Norma Rae' is a splendid film about one woman's struggle to save her family and her entire town from the clutches of corruption; to give them what they work so hard for and spare them any further abuse.  It is also a story of a woman's struggle to find herself amidst a town that never changes and barely allows room for self expression.  This is a film about life and what you make of it and what you're willing to sacrifice in order to get what you deserve.",5,Sometimes you have to fight for your rights...,1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,3338,"['are', 'lot', 'films', 'overworked', 'underappreciated', 'finally', 'standing', 'up', 'fighting', 'what', 'know', 'are', 'owed', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'notch', 'most', 'Not', 'only', 'moving', 'engrossing', 'enlightening', 'magic', 'areas', 'film', 'shedding', 'light', 'issues', 'gathering', 'support', 'fleshing', 'out', 'three-dimensional', 'characters', 'love', 'love', 'hate', 'even', 'hate', 'love.Norma', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'do', 'widow', 'who', 'raising', 'two', 'children', 'living', 'overprotective', 'father', 'working', 'same', 'mill', 'parents', 'going', 'nowhere', 'fast', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'Then', 'Reuben', 'up', 'town', 'whole', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'Reuben', 'unionizer', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'determined', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'working', 'class', 'people', 'area', 'only', 'rally', 'enough', 'support', 'likes', 'Norma', 'what', 'corrupt', 'men', 'power', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'prevent', 'union', 'more', 'determined', 'get', 'so', 'wonderful', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'as', 'much', 'woman', 'Norma', 'union', 'so', 'fervently', 'get', 'passed', 'film', 'interested', 'person', 'thus', 'become', 'interested', 'family', 'life', 'love', 'life', 'past', 'eventual', 'future', 'film', 'primary', 'interest', 'focused', 'dedication', 'union', 'also', 'ample', 'time', 'build', 'relationship', 'small', 'town', 'boyfriend/husband', 'Sonny', 'as', 'well', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Reuben.The', 'film', 'multilayered.Sally', 'Field', 'won', 'first', 'Oscar', 'riveting', 'portrayal', 'Norma', 'funny', 'when', 'film', 'get', 'taste', 'overacting', 'finest', 'Norma', 'screaming', 'boss', 'how', 'mother', 'deaf', 'noise', 'mill', 'immediately', 'began', 'wonder', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'flashy', 'performances', 'almost', 'show', 'depth', 'said', 'silent', 'prayer', 'Field', 'not', 'scream', 'whole', 'movie', 'prayer', 'was', 'instantly', 'answered', 'Yes', 'Field', 'impeccable', 'here', 'capturing', 'essence', 'woman', 'steely', 'determination', 'quieter', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'captivating', 'especially', 'when', 'husband', 'Reuben', 'head', 'scene', 'instantly', 'stolen', 'though', 'co-star', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'who', 'grabs', 'heart', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'head', 'Norma', 'Beau', 'gotten', 'shaft', 'years', 'guess', 'what', 'when', 'brother', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'must', 'tell', 'Beau', 'talent', 'own', 'performance', 'here', 'words', 'so', 'moving', 'so', 'sincere', 'so', 'lovable.Every', 'husband', 'should', 'strive', 'be', 'more', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'lucky', 'find', 'man', 'him.', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'splendid', 'film', 'one', 'woman', 'struggle', 'save', 'family', 'entire', 'town', 'clutches', 'corruption', 'give', 'what', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'spare', 'further', 'abuse', 'also', 'story', 'woman', 'struggle', 'find', 'amidst', 'town', 'never', 'changes', 'barely', 'room', 'self', 'expression', 'film', 'life', 'what', 'make', 'what', ""'re"", 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'get', 'what', 'deserve']",N/A

So, why do people love this little film so much? Because it is very, very heartfelt and deals with a subjetc very interesting. Plus, Sally Field's performance is deeply touching.""Norma Rae"" is the story of a working woman who gets tired of being exploited by the factory she works for, which is one of the few companies in her town, where her whole family has been working for years, and in the future so will her children. After meeting a man from the Textil Union, she starts to get involved with the organization, and the fights for the workers' rights as well. Slowly she gets concious that union and Union make a whole difference.What I think is most interesting in this movie is the fact that is very timeless and placeless. Even now, 20 years later of its releasing, the subject is still up to date, everywhere there are employees fighting against unfair employers. And even though, it is about political and social aspects of society, the film does not tries to give you a lecture.As I aforementioned, Sally Field deliveries very good. The transformation of Nora from a party girls who only wants to date and drink into a working class hero is completely believable. Moreover, we stay by her side all the time rooting for her gets the rights they want. The supporting cast does also a very good work. Ron Liebman -- as the man who introduces Norma to the Union, and becomes a kind of mentor to her -- and Beau Bridges -- as her husband-- are very impressive. Martin Ritt's direction is very discreet and effective.All in all, I highly recomend this movie. It is very entertaining and deep.

They are trying to bring the bring the workers at a Southern Textile Plant into much-needed solidarity and director, Martin Ritt is obviously trying equally as hard to avoid the usual cliches of the hard-hearted, pig-headed, capitalistic boss and the passive severely put-upon workers.

Sally Field's Oscar win was well deserved.Unfortunately, the current industrial situation in the US has put a major damper on the feel good ending of this movie.  There are almost no textile mills in the US now.  It is sad watching Norma Rae live thru this incredible struggle only to know that in 10 to 15 years it will no longer matter.As well as being about labor unions, this movie is also a love story.  Sally Field has wonderful chemistry with her two male costars, Ron Liebman and Beau Bridges.  Both of their characters fall in love with Norma and throughout the movie they fight for her attention.  Bridges pulls out all the stops and proposes.  Liebman's Reuben tells fantastic stories about his Union Job, life in the big city and is generally exciting, almost enticing Norma to leave her small town life.  Liebman is great as Reuben and he embodies NY cool to the nth degree.  He makes Reuben stand out like a peacock in the small town and Norma is fascinated by him.  In one great scene, Liebman enters a local bar where Field and Bridges are on their first date.  Field's Norma immediately becomes Flirty, flighty and giggly over the appearance of her NY crush.

573167,A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ,B000059HAN,Larry Scantlebury,"[7, 8]","This is a great movie. For several reasons. Let me tell you one of them. The undercurrent is not homeric or heroic, it's about leadership.I teach a course in Leadership at a local college. One of the Chapters is about Women as Leaders. Well, we're kind of off in a fantasy world here if we try to use props. And the chasm beteen what we see on the screen and the real world, fantasy and application, is wide, enormous and scary.So this is not about Vin Diesel saving the world with his enormous biceps, nor Arnold with giant pecs protecting women and children. Nor is it a braless Signourney Weaver in a tee shirt and two machine guns on her hips blowing up aliens.This is about one of us in the body of a short, cute, 90 pound woman, uneducated, riddled with human flaw, inspired by her antithesis, a highly educated jewish labor organizer, to stand up and like Tommy Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Olympics, raise her fist in defiance of the machine.And, Sally Field does give the performanvce of a lifetime with all the nuances of an uneducated person sensing the right thing but lacking the tools with which to do it.There's a scene where she has to sign her name and she stares at the paper and purses her tongue and bites her lip in concentration. Small affectation. Brilliant. She got the Oscar and I think we laughed at her. She's Gidget for God's sake. The Flying Nun. It's even funnier than if Goldie Hawn won it. But here's the final answer: She deserved it.You know what the plot's about. This Alabama about 20 years after Brown v. Board of Education, 10 years after The Heart of Atlanta decison, and 6 or 7 years after the Civil Rights killings. So it's not a safe venue for change. And Ron Liebman as the organizer Reuben has one thing going for him, he's not black. But everything else about him is what many southerners at that time hated. He's jewish, he's ""a left-o,"" he's educated, he's from New Yawk. And somehow, the factory worker Norma Rae is drawn to him. I think she loves him and he her, but not that way. He changes her life, and she can never return. She has become a leader, with vision, communication, and patience. Hell. At the end she's reading Dylan Thomas. See the movie. 5 stars.

Although she stunned television audiences a few years earlier with the Emmy winning performance in Sybil, most still thought of her as either Sister Bertrille from The Flying Nun or TV's Gidget.Based on a true story, Norma Rae is a single mother of two, not all in wedlock.  She lives at home with mother (Barbara Baxley) and father (Pat Hingle).  She works at the OP Henley textile mill.  She is having an affair with a married man.Into her life comes two very different men.  First is Ruben Kincaid (Ron Leibman), a Jewish union organizer from New York.  Ruben wants to organize the textile mill but needs to get an in at the factory. The second is Sonny Webster (Beau Bridges), another mill worker.  Sonny takes a shining to Norma and starts to date her.  After a while, they get married and they combine their three kids together.Ruben is looking for that one person to get him in with the workers.  He sees that Norma is a bit of rebel and also cares for her coworkers.  This is the woman he needs.  After a few meetings and seeing Ruben take on the bosses, she signs on.  She works tirelessly for the union.  It starts to become her entire life and almost ends her marriage.The mill turns up the heat with threats of shift cuts and scares off the workers from the union meetings.  That is until Norma Rae's father dies after a supervisor refuses to let him off when he was feeling bad.  But the mill puts up a racist notice which prompts the film's famous scene.  Norma Rae writes down what is on the notice and management tries to stop her.  She gets up on a table and writes UNION of a piece of cardboard.  She holds it up and one by one the workers shut off their machines.  Then she is dragged of by the police.  This leads to what a friend called Sally's Oscar scene where she sits down with her kids and explains their parentage. (No dry eyes here).The factory holds the union vote and the union is approved.Sally Field deservedly won the Oscar and set her career on fire.  But you also have to give a big round to the supporting cast.  Pat Hingle as her father gives a the performance of his career.  Barbara Baxley showed her versatility in this role.  In Nashville she played a flamboyant diva.  In Norma Rae, she plays a woman beaten down by her life and just wants a life where she is not noticed.  Gail Strickland plays Norma's best friend.  This is a role that she will perfect over the next few years.  And finally, Beau Bridges once again shows that he is a great actor.Director Martin Ritt will team up with Sally two more times.  The next year in Back Roads which was a mild miss and then ten years later with Murphy's Romance which was another home run.DVD EXTRA: Backstory: Norma Rae - When AMC decided to launch an informational series about making of films that made a difference, their first episode was on Norma Rae.

573171,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B000059HAN,P Magnum,"[10, 12]","Sally Field gives a career turning performance in 1979's Norma Rae.  Up to that point, Ms. Field was better known as a TV actress who starred in fluffy comedies like Gidget, The Flying Nun &amp; The Girl With Something Extra.  In 1976, she showed a more serious side, taking home an Emmy for her work as a young girl with multiple personalities in Sybil.  After Sybil, she proceeded to star in more fluff pieces like Smokey &amp; The Bandit, Hooper &amp; The End with her then boyfriend Burt Reynolds.  Norma Rae was a film with much more substance.  In fact after reading the script, Mr. Reynolds advised her that she would win an Oscar for the film.  He turned out to be quite prophetic.  Ms. Field is superb in the title role.  Norma is an unassuming factory worker from a small town in the South, who is widowed and has two kids with two separate fathers.  That is until she meets Reuben Warshawky (Ron Liebman).  Reuben is an Union organizer from New York City and he is trying to get the mill workers to set up a union.  Most people ignore as they are fearful for their jobs, but Norma is intrigued and she starts meeting with Reuben to try and start a union.  She is met with resistance and is bullied by her bosses, but Norma is not persuaded to quit.  She feels that she has stood by her whole life without making a difference and this is her chance to actually matter.  There is of course the famous scene where Norma is about to be removed from the mill and she defiantly stands on a table with the Union sign.  Her co-workers one by one realize the chances she's taken for them and they shut off their machines in support.  The film has some excellent supporting work from Mr. Liebman, Beau Bridges and Pat Hingle, but this is Ms. Field's film all the way.  She proved Mr. Reynolds right and took home the 1979 Best Actress Oscar and set forth on a path that would add another Oscar to her collection and feature some of the best films of 1980's &amp; 1990's.",4,Rae of Hope,1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,1971,"['Sally', 'Field', 'career', 'turning', 'performance', '1979', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'Up', 'point', 'Ms.', 'Field', 'was', 'better', 'known', 'TV', 'actress', 'who', 'starred', 'fluffy', 'comedies', 'Gidget', 'Flying', 'Nun', 'amp', 'Girl', 'Something', 'Extra', '1976', 'showed', 'more', 'serious', 'side', 'taking', 'home', 'Emmy', 'work', 'young', 'girl', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'Sybil', 'Sybil', 'proceeded', 'star', 'more', 'fluff', 'pieces', 'Smokey', 'amp', 'Bandit', 'Hooper', 'amp', 'End', 'then', 'boyfriend', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'was', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'substance', 'fact', 'reading', 'script', 'Mr.', 'Reynolds', 'advised', 'would', 'win', 'Oscar', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'prophetic', 'Ms.', 'Field', 'superb', 'title', 'role', 'Norma', 'unassuming', 'factory', 'worker', 'small', 'town', 'South', 'who', 'widowed', 'two', 'kids', 'two', 'separate', 'fathers', 'Reuben', 'Warshawky', 'Ron', 'Liebman', 'Reuben', 'Union', 'organizer', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'trying', 'get', 'mill', 'workers', 'set', 'up', 'union', 'Most', 'people', 'ignore', 'are', 'fearful', 'jobs', 'Norma', 'intrigued', 'meeting', 'Reuben', 'try', 'start', 'union', 'met', 'resistance', 'bullied', 'bosses', 'Norma', 'not', 'persuaded', 'quit', 'stood', 'whole', 'life', 'making', 'difference', 'chance', 'actually', 'matter', 'course', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'Norma', 'be', 'removed', 'mill', 'defiantly', 'table', 'Union', 'sign', 'co-workers', 'one', 'one', 'realize', 'chances', 'taken', 'shut', 'off', 'machines', 'support', 'film', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Liebman', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'Ms.', 'Field', 'film', 'way', 'proved', 'Mr.', 'Reynolds', 'right', 'took', 'home', '1979', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'set', 'forth', 'path', 'would', 'add', 'Oscar', 'collection', 'feature', 'best', 'films', '1980', 'amp', '1990']",N/A

She ends up sacrificing all, including her self esteem, to give the workers more control over their working conditions.Chills ran down my spine during the scene where she held up the &quot;union&quot; sign and another where she rebuked her husband for being non-supportive of her union efforts. I am not a union supporter, but I know good drama, strong performances, and a logical and interesting plot when I see it, so I recommend this fine film to all.Hopefully they will give as much time and attention to dubbing and subtitling this movie into languages of third world countries because that's where this textile plant probably relocated a year after the events this film portrayed.

In 1979 ""Norma Rae"" was a trenchant look into the pervasive poverty of the American South and unions as a means to shift that paradigm.  It was a groundbreaking performance for Sally Field, normally cast as the ing&eacute;nue, and for Beau Bridges as her put-upon husband.  I'd not seen the film in its original release, but seeing it 30 years on certainly does give it a different feel.  At the time of its initial release it was as pro-union a film as could be imagined.  Thirty years on it now feels more like an elegy for an industry shipped overseas as a result of higher wages and globalization.  The unionization of ""Norma Rae"" ironically proved to be the undoing of the mills and the millworkers.  The mill itself plays a prominent role in the movie, and the work seems little changed from even a hundred years prior.  The loud roar of the machines pervades the movie, the cotton lint floating in the air coating the machines and workers alike a rough symbolism of how the workers and machines have become one.""Norma Rae"" is also pitch-perfect for the times, capturing the racism and anti-Semitism of the era; something rarely attempted in today's politically correct times.  Field is superb as the flawed yet indomitable Norma Rae, and it's easy to see how she won the Oscar for her performance.  The end is fittingly unsentimental and atypical for a Hollywood film with Norma Rae seeing Rueben, the union organizer, off to yet another destination.  You couldn't create a better ending as sentimentalists would have the two running off together, but realists know Rueben is a man on a mission.  The parting is the perfect metaphor for how the mills and their jobs would move on, seeking better opportunities, leaving the millworkers behind, jilted and unemployed.  The deeper meaning of ""Norma Rae"" is that the millworkers and the mills needed each other desperately.  Once one became a free agent the cycle of dependency was broken and mills were free to court other better options.""Norma Rae"" ultimately is more about the message but little thought as to the consequences.  While unions could break the cycle of poverty for millworkers it proved to be a Pyrrhic victory, and if anything hastened the demise of their jobs.  And to that end ""Norma Rae"" becomes an even more damning condemnation of Free Market Capitalism without ostensibly intending to do so.  ""Norma Rae"" was certainly a polarizing movie at the time and it remains so today.  Few who watch it now will be inspired to join a union or feel compelled to be unabashedly pro-union; it's quite simply not going to change many minds.  If anything it's a glimpse into who we were as a people and as a society.",4,Now more of a time capsule and a commentary on Free Market Capitalism,1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,2838,"['Hollywood', 'rich', 'tradition', 'producing', 'topical', 'subsequently', 'wind', 'up', 'becoming', 'video', 'time', 'capsules', 'summing', 'up', 'where', 'were', 'society', 'time', '1979', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'was', 'trenchant', 'look', 'pervasive', 'poverty', 'American', 'South', 'unions', 'means', 'shift', 'paradigm', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'performance', 'Sally', 'Field', 'normally', 'cast', 'ing', 'eacute', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'put-upon', 'husband', ""'d"", 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'original', 'release', 'seeing', '30', 'years', 'certainly', 'give', 'different', 'feel', 'time', 'initial', 'release', 'was', 'pro-union', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'imagined', 'Thirty', 'years', 'now', 'more', 'elegy', 'industry', 'shipped', 'overseas', 'result', 'higher', 'wages', 'globalization', 'unionization', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'ironically', 'proved', 'be', 'undoing', 'mills', 'millworkers', 'mill', 'prominent', 'role', 'movie', 'work', 'little', 'changed', 'even', 'hundred', 'years', 'prior', 'loud', 'roar', 'machines', 'movie', 'cotton', 'lint', 'floating', 'air', 'coating', 'machines', 'workers', 'alike', 'rough', 'symbolism', 'how', 'workers', 'machines', 'have', 'become', 'one', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'also', 'pitch-perfect', 'times', 'capturing', 'racism', 'anti-Semitism', 'era', 'something', 'rarely', 'attempted', 'today', 'politically', 'correct', 'times', 'Field', 'superb', 'flawed', 'yet', 'indomitable', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'end', 'fittingly', 'unsentimental', 'atypical', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'seeing', 'Rueben', 'union', 'organizer', 'off', 'yet', 'destination', 'could', ""n't"", 'create', 'better', 'ending', 'sentimentalists', 'would', 'have', 'two', 'running', 'off', 'together', 'realists', 'know', 'Rueben', 'man', 'mission', 'parting', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'how', 'mills', 'jobs', 'would', 'move', 'seeking', 'better', 'opportunities', 'leaving', 'millworkers', 'jilted', 'unemployed', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'millworkers', 'mills', 'needed', 'other', 'desperately', 'Once', 'one', 'became', 'free', 'agent', 'cycle', 'dependency', 'was', 'broken', 'mills', 'were', 'free', 'court', 'other', 'better', 'options', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'ultimately', 'more', 'message', 'little', 'thought', 'consequences', 'unions', 'could', 'break', 'cycle', 'poverty', 'millworkers', 'proved', 'be', 'Pyrrhic', 'victory', 'anything', 'hastened', 'demise', 'jobs', 'end', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'even', 'more', 'damning', 'condemnation', 'Free', 'Market', 'Capitalism', 'ostensibly', 'intending', 'do', 'so', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'was', 'certainly', 'polarizing', 'movie', 'time', 'so', 'today', 'Few', 'who', 'watch', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'inspired', 'join', 'union', 'feel', 'compelled', 'be', 'unabashedly', 'pro-union', 'quite', 'simply', 'not', 'going', 'change', 'many', 'minds', 'anything', 'glimpse', 'who', 'were', 'people', 'society']",N/A
