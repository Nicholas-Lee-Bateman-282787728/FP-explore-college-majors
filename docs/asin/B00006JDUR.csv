It is my honest opinion that if BET wants to make these wonderful books into movies that they should at least follow the blueprint in the book. I read this book by Brenda Jackson and it is one of my favorites. The movie strayed so far from the book that only the names were the same.This is a wonderful story but to feel the full effect, you must read the book. The movie was garbage. A suggestion to BET keep publishing the books and leave the moviemaking to someone else.",3,WHY MESS UP A GREAT BOOK?,1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,534,"['may', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'first', 'honest', 'opinion', 'BET', 'make', 'wonderful', 'books', 'movies', 'should', 'least', 'follow', 'blueprint', 'book', 'read', 'book', 'Brenda', 'Jackson', 'one', 'favorites', 'movie', 'strayed', 'so', 'far', 'book', 'only', 'names', 'were', 'same.This', 'wonderful', 'story', 'feel', 'full', 'effect', 'must', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'garbage', 'suggestion', 'BET', 'keep', 'publishing', 'books', 'leave', 'moviemaking', 'someone', 'else']",One Special Moment
717835,A33F2NHAO6HX5E,B00006JDUR,Blackworm,"[1, 4]","Sterling Hamilton is one of Hollywood's leading action stars, and even though his films are on the violent side, the money is coming in, and thanks to his manager Ed, he is in a comfortable place.  Emotionally, however, Sterling is lacking for something or someone to belong to, due to a troublesome childhood.  Leave it to Ed to come up with the most outrageous idea:  a contest for Sterling to pick a woman to have his baby for one million dollars!  Posted on his dying website, the offers come in, and Sterling couldn't be more disturbed by the whole idea.  It's during a television commerical that James, up and coming fashion designer, check it out and trick his sister Colby to come with him to meet Sterling and sell him on being the marquee man to wear and promote his clothing line, hoping to cash in on both prizes.  Honesty and deceit play all through the feature, and what people hold dear to them is tested.  The lead characters are intriguing and are able to hold their own against each other, especially as the final curtain rises and everyone realizes that money can buy many things, but it will never be able to pay in full an empty heart. A very good and romantic film for the cynical at heart.",5,"""ONE SPECIAL"" movie.",1048809600,"03 28, 2003",2003,1212,"['Sterling', 'Hamilton', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'action', 'stars', 'even', 'films', 'are', 'violent', 'side', 'money', 'coming', 'thanks', 'manager', 'Ed', 'comfortable', 'place', 'Emotionally', 'however', 'Sterling', 'lacking', 'something', 'someone', 'belong', 'due', 'troublesome', 'childhood', 'Leave', 'Ed', 'come', 'up', 'most', 'outrageous', 'idea', 'contest', 'Sterling', 'pick', 'woman', 'have', 'baby', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', 'Posted', 'dying', 'website', 'offers', 'come', 'Sterling', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'disturbed', 'whole', 'idea', 'television', 'commerical', 'James', 'up', 'coming', 'fashion', 'designer', 'check', 'out', 'trick', 'sister', 'Colby', 'come', 'meet', 'Sterling', 'sell', 'being', 'marquee', 'man', 'wear', 'promote', 'clothing', 'line', 'hoping', 'cash', 'prizes', 'Honesty', 'deceit', 'play', 'feature', 'what', 'people', 'hold', 'dear', 'tested', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'intriguing', 'are', 'able', 'hold', 'own', 'other', 'especially', 'final', 'curtain', 'rises', 'everyone', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'many', 'things', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'pay', 'full', 'empty', 'heart', 'very', 'good', 'romantic', 'film', 'cynical', 'heart']",One Special Moment
717836,A3MQVJ1JNGHDSP,B00006JDUR,"Henry  Cooper ""&#34;Still One Me&#34;""","[4, 6]","I'd enjoy this movie so well more than the book(which I haven't read or bought yet but I'ma still get ASAP). Yeah Sterling Hamilton (Kirk Taylor) did a very great job on this one, I did he should earn the credit 4 this one. And 'specially Colby Wingate (Tamara Taylor) she was more hot, smooth, sexy and very genuine. Maybe this shoulda won a Academy Award on that day. This movie is telling all the basics what's going on in our community like he had a talent or gift for money, clothes, music, books or whatever, we know God has the ability to give what we want in life. And for the rest of the cast that did it well, i.e. Obba Babatunde, Tavis Smiley (once did a special appearance on this movie), Tico Wells, Michelle Griffin, Shanice Wilson, etc. Every movie fan should have this if they're use to real movies I like. This movie is 'bout this young cat who is a blockbuster action star who craves to fall into a relationship with a brother's sister who wants to be apart of his company along with her brother who is doing the clothing line. Meaning he's making the right explanation or choice to prove it. Right after, he decides that he wasn't making the right decision, so he fired his manager 'cuz it's been bragging him 2 long at the end of the movie y'know. This is definitely a must-see movie. If ya'll aren't watching should check new movies which I'd see are real. For example, So Real, Play'd: A Hip-Hop Story (feat. the late Merlin Santana, R.I.P.), Livin' Large, Nikita Blues, One Week, Alfie (w/ Michael Caine in it), Double Platinum, The Wiz, 30 Years to Life, Motives, etc.C'mon you gotta love this man.

His name is Silver and he has everything a man could want the upscale crib, the fancy rides, and all the women he can handle. But what he really wants is a family. After follwing the advice of his manager he holds a contest offering a million dollars to the perfect woman who will have his baby. Well the high school teacher name Colby catches his eye. But of course she rejects him as being a shallow hollywood player with all his violent movies and actress girlfriends.From this point he does just about anything to capture this woman's heart.
