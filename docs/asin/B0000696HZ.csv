A lonely girl finds a monkey in the park and it goes from there to her trying to hide it and escape the gypsy that previously owned the monkey.

706885,A3O2Y1MVIY77IE,B0000696HZ,"Mary McGreevey ""frwhiskey""","[0, 0]","This film was a laugh and a sidetickler throughout with the great natural actress Thora Birch, the child who wants a pet but whose new father has an allergy to pet fur, while Harvey Keitel as a gypsy-thief with a capuchin monkey is perfect as greedy and conniving but easily thwarted and defeated jewelry/wallet crook.The filming of this looks almost magical - how did they get the monkey to do all these things, especially the amazing chase scene throughout the boardwalk of Venice Beach, surrounded by joggers, skaters, bike riders and spectators, skateboarders and chaos?  The ability of the monkey to steal watches and wallets from unsuspecting tourists was a pleasure to watch.  Gives one ideas!Meanwhile, Thora Birch plays a smart and able girl whose mother is about to re-marry.  New hubby-to-be is patient to a point, but when he sneezes his head off with every cat or dog around, there's no way that Thora's going to have a pet.  She's desperate, because she wants to have it for herself of course, but also to show her friends at school, the show-and-tell deal.This monkey is loose, ran away from the gypsy, and she finds it, slips it into her backpack, and adopts it!Oh boy!  The Troubles begin and they're hilarious!Don't want to give away the whole plot full of monkey trouble.  Suffice to say that it's a pleasure for any adult or child to watch, it's got very realistic acting in both adults and children, Thora's parents are tough and strict enough to punish her, and the school doesn't let the kids get away with nonsense either.  The dresscode at the public school looks pretty loose, but then, it's Southern California and I'm warped from Catholic school days of the 1960's.  Also noteworthy to my adult eyes is the girl's freedom:  she can come and go remarkably freely and do very mature things without too much interference, such as going out on her own to ride a bike down Venice Beach.Venice Beach has always attracted its share of loonies and weirdos and certainly a few childmolesters!  Would a parent really allow that kind of freedom to a girl of 9 or 10????But this is the kind of freedom that kids everywhere dream of, so live a little and fly free with Thora on her bicycle in and out of the surf-n-sun world, fantasy to be that young again WITHOUT the usual restrictions that normal parents impose.Her real Dad, divorced and busy and always flying around for his work (they're always successful businessmen, these divorced and move-out Dads, eh?), so he hasn't the time for Thora and cancels his weekend visit with her with a work excuse.She takes complete advantage of this and creates a perfect deception, which I had to admire; alarming to this oblivious busy-busy Dad.  Good to know that your kids are resourceful, but perhaps this one is a bit much for Dad to handle!!!Twenty years after its shooting, it's still fresh and looks wonderful.  How slowly our society is changing, one could think.  It's a big leap from 1950's to 1970's in mentality and fashion change, but it seems we're now stagnating since the 1970's.I think it's Don Fisher and GAP which has frozen us here, but maybe it's a couple of other factors, too.  Casual dressing for all, alleluia!  Even Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, in 1990's trying to upgrade the low dresscode of City Hall, got a private phone call from Don Fisher (RIP) who told him to rescind the dress change order, since he had spent a lifetime trying to get people into jeans.Just a comment - sociological observations of streets scenes of America come easily when sititng on a couch in California!",5,Cure your allergies - move a monkey into your house!,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,3577,"['film', 'was', 'laugh', 'sidetickler', 'great', 'natural', 'actress', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'child', 'who', 'pet', 'new', 'father', 'allergy', 'pet', 'fur', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'gypsy-thief', 'capuchin', 'monkey', 'perfect', 'greedy', 'conniving', 'easily', 'thwarted', 'defeated', 'jewelry/wallet', 'crook.The', 'filming', 'almost', 'magical', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'monkey', 'do', 'things', 'especially', 'amazing', 'chase', 'scene', 'boardwalk', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'surrounded', 'joggers', 'skaters', 'bike', 'riders', 'spectators', 'skateboarders', 'chaos', 'ability', 'monkey', 'steal', 'watches', 'wallets', 'unsuspecting', 'tourists', 'was', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Gives', 'one', 'ideas', 'Meanwhile', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'smart', 'able', 'girl', 'mother', 're-marry', 'New', 'hubby-to-be', 'patient', 'point', 'when', 'head', 'cat', 'dog', 'around', 'way', 'Thora', 'going', 'have', 'pet', 'desperate', 'have', 'herself', 'course', 'also', 'show', 'friends', 'school', 'show-and-tell', 'deal.This', 'monkey', 'loose', 'ran', 'away', 'gypsy', 'backpack', 'Oh', 'boy', 'Troubles', 'begin', ""'re"", 'hilarious', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'whole', 'plot', 'full', 'monkey', 'trouble', 'Suffice', 'say', 'pleasure', 'adult', 'child', 'watch', 'got', 'very', 'realistic', 'acting', 'adults', 'children', 'Thora', 'parents', 'are', 'tough', 'strict', 'enough', 'punish', 'school', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'get', 'away', 'nonsense', 'dresscode', 'public', 'school', 'pretty', 'loose', 'then', 'Southern', 'California', ""'m"", 'warped', 'Catholic', 'school', 'days', '1960', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'adult', 'eyes', 'girl', 'freedom', 'can', 'come', 'go', 'remarkably', 'freely', 'do', 'very', 'mature', 'things', 'too', 'much', 'interference', 'such', 'going', 'out', 'own', 'ride', 'bike', 'down', 'Venice', 'Beach.Venice', 'Beach', 'always', 'attracted', 'share', 'loonies', 'weirdos', 'certainly', 'few', 'childmolesters', 'Would', 'parent', 'really', 'allow', 'kind', 'freedom', 'girl', '9', '10', 'kind', 'freedom', 'kids', 'everywhere', 'dream', 'so', 'live', 'little', 'fly', 'free', 'Thora', 'bicycle', 'surf-n-sun', 'world', 'fantasy', 'be', 'young', 'again', 'usual', 'restrictions', 'normal', 'parents', 'impose.Her', 'real', 'Dad', 'divorced', 'busy', 'always', 'flying', 'around', 'work', ""'re"", 'always', 'successful', 'businessmen', 'divorced', 'move-out', 'Dads', 'eh', 'so', ""n't"", 'time', 'Thora', 'cancels', 'weekend', 'visit', 'work', 'excuse.She', 'complete', 'advantage', 'perfect', 'deception', 'had', 'admire', 'alarming', 'oblivious', 'busy-busy', 'Dad', 'Good', 'know', 'kids', 'are', 'resourceful', 'perhaps', 'one', 'bit', 'much', 'Dad', 'handle', 'Twenty', 'years', 'shooting', 'still', 'fresh', 'wonderful', 'How', 'slowly', 'society', 'changing', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'big', 'leap', '1950', '1970', 'mentality', 'fashion', 'change', ""'re"", 'now', 'stagnating', ""1970's.I"", 'think', 'Don', 'Fisher', 'GAP', 'frozen', 'here', 'couple', 'other', 'factors', 'too', 'Casual', 'dressing', 'alleluia', 'Even', 'Mayor', 'Willie', 'Brown', 'San', 'Francisco', '1990', 'trying', 'upgrade', 'low', 'dresscode', 'City', 'Hall', 'got', 'private', 'phone', 'call', 'Don', 'Fisher', 'RIP', 'who', 'told', 'rescind', 'dress', 'change', 'order', 'had', 'spent', 'lifetime', 'trying', 'get', 'people', 'jeans.Just', 'comment', 'sociological', 'observations', 'streets', 'scenes', 'America', 'come', 'easily', 'when', 'sititng', 'couch', 'California']",N/A
