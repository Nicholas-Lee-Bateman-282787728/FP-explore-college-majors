(My girls, ages 4 & 5, were dancing all the way thru it!)Mowgli is voiced by Haley Joel Osment, and he does a wonderful job! Mowgli is fed up with the rules of the man-village and longs for his old pal Baloo (voiced very well by John Goodman) and the jungle life. When Baloo strays into the man-village one night looking for Mowgli, Shanti (a girl from the man-village) spies him and screams ""wild animal!""  The villagers all come to her aid, but spy Shere Khan (voiced by Tony Jay) in the village instead of Baloo.  This enables Baloo and Mowgli to slip into the jungle, unseen by anyone, except Shanti. Shanti follows them, seeking to ""rescue"" Mowgli.  This is when the ""fun"" begins!The songs are addictive! (and annoying if your 5 yr old sings them for days on end!)

749130,A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B00008Y47S,"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony""","[0, 0]","Disney's 2003 sequel ""Jungle Book 2,"" newly released in ""special edition"" DVD, was a missed opportunity. Not because 1967's original, based on Rudyard Kipling's oft-filmed book, came 36 years before as the last animated film Walt Disney directly touched.Nor because most of the original's distinguished voice cast couldn't return. Phil Harris (the first ""Baloo""), George Sanders (""Shere Khan""), and the legendary Louie Prima (""King Louie"") had passed since the original. But John Goodman summarizes Baloo's carefree spirit, Tony Jay gives Shere Khan Scar-like menace and Jim Cummings slips into Sterling Holloway's snakeskin nicely as Kaa. King Louie couldn't appear, allegedly due to royalty dispute, so the original's Dixieland spirit is replaced by Smashmouth's ""I Want to Be Like You"" over end credits.The film could've been, should've been (and almost was) more about Mowgli's (voiced by Hayley Joel Osment) relationship with Shanti, the young girl who lured him to the man-village and his adopted family. Bonus features show early plans for a feistier relationship between them, dueting as equals on the omitted song ""I Got You Beat.""  In ""2,"" Shanti (voiced by Mae Whitman) timidly fears the jungle, finding her bravery when trying to rescue little brother Rajan and Mowgli himself from the vengeful Khan. (The omitted song ""Braver"" would have served as turning point for her growth). Disney producers decided Mowgli would spend most of his time singing and swinging with the animals, disappointing considering strong female characters anchored some of the studio's most acclaimed, successful films the last 20 years.Thus, in 72 minutes, we're treated to three versions of ""Bare Necessities,"" a couple of fun but overdone production numbers ""(Jungle Rhythm"" and ""W-I-L-D""), sunnier animation than the first film's aquas and turquoise backgrounds and a brief, suspenseful showdown with Khan again recalling (at least in spirit) ""Lion King.""'s magnificent final minutes.  All this makes ""Jungle Book 2"" pleasant for young children but only an brief reprise for beloved characters and an echo of the first film's jazzy style.",2,"""Jungle Book 2"" Barely Necessary Sequel to Classic Film",1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,2129,"['Disney', '2003', 'sequel', 'Jungle', 'Book', '2', 'newly', 'released', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Not', '1967', 'original', 'based', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'oft-filmed', 'book', 'came', '36', 'years', 'before', 'last', 'animated', 'film', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'directly', 'touched.Nor', 'most', 'original', 'distinguished', 'voice', 'cast', 'could', ""n't"", 'return', 'Phil', 'Harris', 'first', 'Baloo', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'legendary', 'Louie', 'Prima', 'King', 'Louie', 'had', 'passed', 'original', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Baloo', 'carefree', 'spirit', 'Tony', 'Jay', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'Scar-like', 'menace', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'Sterling', 'Holloway', 'snakeskin', 'nicely', 'Kaa', 'King', 'Louie', 'could', ""n't"", 'appear', 'allegedly', 'due', 'royalty', 'dispute', 'original', 'Dixieland', 'spirit', 'replaced', 'Smashmouth', 'Want', 'Be', 'end', 'credits.The', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'almost', 'was', 'more', 'Mowgli', 'voiced', 'Hayley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'relationship', 'Shanti', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'lured', 'man-village', 'adopted', 'family', 'Bonus', 'show', 'early', 'plans', 'feistier', 'relationship', 'dueting', 'equals', 'omitted', 'song', 'Got', 'Beat', '2', 'Shanti', 'voiced', 'Mae', 'Whitman', 'timidly', 'jungle', 'finding', 'bravery', 'when', 'trying', 'rescue', 'little', 'brother', 'Rajan', 'Mowgli', 'vengeful', 'Khan', 'omitted', 'song', 'Braver', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'turning', 'point', 'growth', 'Disney', 'producers', 'decided', 'Mowgli', 'would', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'singing', 'swinging', 'animals', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'anchored', 'studio', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'successful', 'films', 'last', '20', 'years.Thus', '72', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'treated', 'three', 'versions', 'Bare', 'Necessities', 'couple', 'fun', 'overdone', 'production', 'numbers', 'Jungle', 'Rhythm', 'W-I-L-D', 'sunnier', 'animation', 'first', 'film', 'aquas', 'turquoise', 'backgrounds', 'brief', 'suspenseful', 'showdown', 'Khan', 'again', 'recalling', 'least', 'spirit', 'Lion', 'King', 'magnificent', 'final', 'minutes', 'Jungle', 'Book', '2', 'pleasant', 'young', 'children', 'only', 'brief', 'reprise', 'beloved', 'characters', 'echo', 'first', 'film', 'jazzy', 'style']",N/A

I especially enjoyed the songs but now forget which was my favorite.  The snake was still the villain plus the tiger which, I think, would scare small sensitive children.  Seeing some Harry Potter early movies on t.v., some of those meanies would scare a child more than these animated songsters.

749134,A2EU9DO5CKMSYY,B00008Y47S,Dash,"[1, 1]","It seems like Disney can't keep their greedy little fingers off any original Disney film. They had already come out with a few sequels....namely ""The Little Mermaid 2"", ""Peter Pan 2"", and ""Pocahontas 2"", so it was only fitting that ""The Jungle Book 2"" would be next in line.I have to admit that this movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the greatest either. The main plot/storyline is this: Mowgli misses life in the jungle, and it shows not only in his songs, but in his stories also. Baloo misses his little ""man cub"" too, so one night, he decides to ""kidnap"" Mowgli and take him back to the jungle. The upside is that both Baloo and Mowgli are happy again. The downside is that Mowgli's two new villiage friends -- Shanti and Ranjan -- miss him, and go out in the jungle to look for him. The story turns into a two-way tie....following the adventures of both Shanti and Ranjan, and Mowgli and Baloo. In the end, Mowgli realizes that his heart lies in the man villiage.The animation seemed kinda so-so in my opinion. They obviously did their best to copy the original animation, and they achieved it in a way that I think was ok, but not great.The voice acting was superb. John Goodman did a pretty good (but not great) Baloo, Haley Joel Osment presents himself nicely as young Mowgli, and Jim Cummings does a wonderful job of portraying the sly and sinister thoughts of Kaa the snake. (I had the pleasure of meeting Jim Cummings once when I was about 8-10 yrs. old, actually. Nice guy.)All-in-all, it's a film that'll keep the kids on their toes clapping and laughing, but will have the parents waiting for it to end. *wink* It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that great either.

749135,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B00008Y47S,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[0, 0]","This 2003 sequel to the beloved 1967 Disney movie ""The Jungle Book"" is basically familiar territory that rarely strays far from the original as far as its characters, plot, and villains. Yet, it is an enjoyable romp that makes for a nice addition to the original. In the 5 years since its release, computer animation has come a long way, so some of the computer shadings and other effects seem almost primitive compared to what we are accustomed to; the harsh computer shading detracts a bit from the visual presentation. I don't know that I would go to a theater to view this widescreen presentation, but for a home video release, it is right on the money.Storywise, Mowgli has been living in the village with humans for about 4 years; Baloo misses Mowgli, and Mowgli is having a hard time forgetting the jungle, despite the fact that he has become closer Shanti, the girl who enticed him to live in the jungle in the first place. Can you see it coming? Shanti's fear of the jungle causes Mowgli to renounce the village, return to Baloo, and of course, Shere Khan is not far behind. Shanti & her little brother go after Mowgli, adding two more villagers for Shere Khan and Kaa to hunt. The catchy Sherman Brothers tunes from the original are re-used (""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna' Be Like You"") as well as a few fun new original songs, ""Jungle Rhythm"" and ""W-I-L-D""). Closing credits have the rock group Smash Mouth doing an awesome cover version of the song ""I Wanna' Be Like You."" The voice talent for the movie is impressive: John Goodman fills the mighty big shoes of the late Phil Harris as Baloo; Haley Joel Osment voices Mowgli; Jim Cummings is amazing as Kaa, and seems to be channeling Sterling Holloway; singer Phil Collins does admirably as one of the vultures.For the extras, there is a good amount of material here: Games & Activities include Mowgli's Story Time Adventure Game. This one uses the 2 dimensional shadow puppets featured in this films opening credits. Players punch the arrow keys on their remote to match what they see on screen. It's a bit of a yawn, and there are no fun prizes/extras when you complete the game. Mowgli's Jungle Ruins Maze is much better; players use their remote to find their way through a maze, and along the way they must answer questions about different animals; a nice mix of fun and education. Music Videos on the DVD include the Smash Mouth cover as well as the 2 original songs from the film, ""W-I-L-D"" and ""Jungle Rhythm."" A few deleted scenes are included along with explanation by Sharon Morrill (former head of Disney Toon Studios) and Matt Walker (Sr. VP of Music); the main reason scenes were deleted were to put the story focus back on Mowgli and not Shanti. Quick access to songs in the movie is included here, as well as a karaoke version of the movie. ""Backstage Disney"" includes a Reader's Digest version of the original movie and a featurette detailing the making of the movie; the featurette is really about the best bonus; it is fun to see and hear from the voice talents as well as the creative team, who does appear very excited about the movie, albeit a little self-congratulatory and over-praising.Overall...thumbs up for the family and kids.

I'd prefer to look at each on a case-by-case basis. Several of these sequels, especially The Lion King 1 1/2, that have a lot going for them, particularly when they take the characters into interesting territory but retain the look and flavor of the original.It's much tougher when contemporary artists, writers -- and the corporate decision makers who have multiple company initiatives to contend with -- tackle the Walt-era classics. They're being re-created with totally different artists under vastly different circumstances -- most of all, without the same budget, luxury of time and creative guidance. Taking all of this into consideration, it's a wonder that so many of them succeed as well as they do.The Jungle Book 2 falls somewhere between the extremes. It's impossible to follow Phil Harris, but few can handle such a thankless task than John Goodman, who after all, has equally formidable voice acting skills of his own -- as Sully in Monsters, Inc. for just one example. Haley Joel Osment does a fine job as Mowgli, being after all, a highly seasoned child actor. And Mae Whitman, who plays Shanti (known as ""The Girl"" in the original film) must have impressed Disney staffers enough to return to direct-to-video in the history-making role of Tinker Bell in the direct-to-video feature coming in October.The film also offers musical showpieces that rival the original in energy and execution. The only issue is, just like the 1969 Disneyland record album sequel More Jungle Book, this film kind of chews its cabbage twice. Mowgli goes back to the jungle, discovers he really doesn't totally belong there and returns to the man village this time able to revisit his old friends.But let's face it -- where else could you take the story without sacrificing the elements expected from the first? Mowgli Goes to College? Mowgli Rules at Camp Rock? (Well, that last one just may happen.)The DVD itself is basically a reissue of the earlier release, containing all the previous materials with one new feature:  ""Mowgli's Story Time Adventure,"" an interactive storytelling activity.

749153,A1HUFWL01E94C5,B00008Y47S,Lauren Rodriguez,"[3, 6]","Hi everyone!  I hope everyone is doing well!  I LOVED this movie and there are several reasons why.  Before I go into them, let me give you a brief summary of the film.The Plot:This movie takes place about a month or two after the original one ended.  Mowgli has been adopted by a nice family and has a new little brother, Ranjan, who idolizes Mowgli for his life spent in the jungle. The movie opens up with Mowgli telling his new family and new best friend, Shanti, about his former life in the jungle through a puppet show.  As he gets to the part where he fought Shere Khan, the ferocious tiger, Ranjan decides to put his own twist on the story and in doing so, manages to destroy the set and embarrass Shanti in the process.  Ranjan's comment that, ""Shanti blinked her big, beautiful, brown eyes at you.  And you follow her into our village,""  prompts Shanti to turn red and deny she did anything of the sort.  This prompts a little argument between Mowgli and Shanti, forcing Mowgli's father to break it up by revealing that his wife used the same trick on him.  Shanti then makes fun of Mowgli before leaving and Mowgli tells Shanti to ""watch out for Shere Khan on your way home.""  Shanti dismisses his warning by retorting that,  ""You and your stories. Everyone knows tigers don't come into the village.""  With that, she leaves.  But Mowgli soon finds that his theory is right when Shere Khan comes back, seeking revenge against Mowgli for what Mowgli did to him.Meanwhile, Mowgli still misses his jungle friends and they miss him.  Baloo, especially.  Baloo wants to bring Mowgli back to the jungle, but Bagheera won't hear it.  He tells Baloo that Mowgli belongs with his own kind.  Baloo disagrees and sneaks off to visit Mowgli.  Meanwhile back in the village, Mowgli and Ranjan spend their day teasing Shanti and playing on her fear of the jungle and especially of tigers.  But Shanti's fear is tested when Baloo is successful in whisking Mowgli back to the jungle and Shanti must save him.  She is accompanied by Ranjan who wants to find Mowgli too.  They encounter Kaa, who is searching for a snack and almost has one, but Ranjan stops him right when he is about to eat Shanti by hitting the snake over the head with a stick.  Mowgli and Shanti are soon reunited again and must face Shere Khan together.  The movie ends on a good note and not only does Shanti face her fear, but Mowgli is able to have the best of both worlds.  He is able to visit his jungle friends and remain in the village with his family and Shanti, who he discovers he cares for-a lot.The Music:This movie had some good songs and even though the Bear Necessities was reprised three times, it was still a good song for the movie.  There are also two new songs that add to the movie's greatness as well.  ""The Jungle Rhythm"", which is sung by Mowgli and his new friends in the village.  This song is one of my favorites because it's really catchy and really jazzy.  Mowgli sings this song to show Shanti, Ranjan and his other new friends just how happening the jungle life is.  His plan almost succeeds until Shanti sees what he's trying to do and gets him grounded by accident.  The other new song is ""W-Y-L-D"", which is sung by Baloo and several animals in the jungle.  This song is not one of my favorites, only because I liked ""I Wanna Be Like You"" a lot more.  Other than that, the instrumental score was really an attention grabber.  And I also enjoyed the first and last version of ""The Bear Necessities"".Musical Extras:The DVD also has some deleted songs that you can enjoy too.  The first song is called ""I've Got You Beat"".  This song was originally done by Mowgli and Shanti as a sort of competition to see what was better.  The jungle life or life in the village.  Although I didn't' like the version the DVD showed, I LOVE the version on the soundtrack.  The other song which is one of my absolute favorites is called ""Braver"".  It was supposed to be in the movie, but it never made it in because the producers and writers of the movie thought the song would give too much away of Shanti.  In my opinion, I think they made a huge mistake in not putting this song into the movie.  It's on the soundtrack, but I like the deleted version on the DVD a whole lot better.  I guess it's because I LOVE Shanti and she is my favorite character next to Mowgli, and Bagheera.  I love the way they developed her character and I really think Mae Whitman brings Shanti to life and she portrays her very well.  The reason I think ""Braver"" should have been in the movie is because it's a really pretty song and Shanti has a very pretty singing voice.  The other reason is that it showed how much Shanti was willing to risk for Mowgli.  She was willing to risk her fear to find him, which I think is a perfect example of what friendship really is.The humor in this movie was easy to see too.  The humorous parts for me were when Kaa, the snake, kept getting beat up.  But my favorite Kaa scene was where Ranjan hits him over the head when he is trying to eat Shanti.  And then after Shanti snaps out of her trance and tells Ranjan to stop, he gives Kaa another whack before doing as Shanti says!  I find that totally hilarious!  The other thing I really liked about the movie was the one liners between Shanti and Mowgli.  I especially love the scene where Mowgli makes Shanti fall into the river and drop her water jug.  The look on her face and the way she growled at him was priceless!In conclusion I really think anyone who has seen Jungle Book, should really pick up this movie.  It's a really good one and I even think it's better than the original.  So get with the Jungle Rhythm and join Mowgli, Shanti, Ranjan, Baloo, Bagheera, Kaa, Shere Khan and all their friends for another adventure full of humor, friendship and learning where you belong.Favorite Scene:Mowgli (to Shanti):  Well, keep your eyes and ears open and always watch your back, or the last sound you'll hear is...  (Ranjan jumps out of the bushes and roars.  Shanti screams and falls into the river, dropping her water jug.)  When does the tiger roar?Shanti:  You're horrible!  Horrible, stinky boys!  Come on, Ranjan.  He's a bad influence.  (They walk into the village.)  Now, don't move. That wasn't very nice you know.(Ranjan growls like a tiger.)Shanti:  Stop that!  You're not a jungle boy.Ranjan:  Why are you so ascared of the jungle?Shanti:  Because it's dangerous.Ranjan:  Dangerwis?  But Mowgli says...Shanti:  You shouldn't listen to everything Mowgli says.Ranjan:  But I thought you like Mowgli.Shanti:  I do.  I-I like Mowgli.  I...I...  (She turns around to see Mowgli standing there.)Mowgli:  You left this at the river.  (Hands Shanti her water jug back.)Shanti:  Thank you.Ranjan:  She's in a bad mood.Mowgli:  Hey, Ranjan, want to see a little trick I learned in the jungle?(Ranjan nods and Mowgli lassos some fruit down off a tree.)Ranjan:  That's a pretty neat trick.Shanti:  Well, here's a little trick I learned, right here at home.(She does the same thing, but manages to get the whole lot of fruit down.)Ranjan:  Wow!  That's a neater trick!Shanti:  Like I said, Ranjan, don't listen to him.",5,Getting with the Jungle Rhythm,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,7171,"['Hi', 'everyone', 'hope', 'everyone', 'doing', 'well',

I just watched this and what I saw was the stark difference between what Disney animation was in the 1960's (The Original Jungle Book; Robin Hood; Original Fox and Hound; The Aristocats) and what it has recently become.It took me a while to grasp what looks wrong about this movie, and what it is seems to be that it looks like multiple ways of rendering art are superimposed in a way that doesn't integrate them very well.  The original Jungle Book looks like an oil painting (to quote one of the creators of this movie from the special features) but this movie looks like some inordinately brightly colored and rather flat dimensionless matte artwork with a combination of animated drawings and computer generated 3D animation.Or to put it briefly, a group of computer people got together and threw together several different ways of creating images, way over did it, and then congratulated themselves for being great artists.  Oh, and while they were at it they forgot to come up with a story.  A real story would have helped.One good thing this movie has going for it is the voice acting talent.

I purchased the original film on DVD earlier in the week for her and she watched it three or four times (yes, she spends lots of time out-of-doors).  My wife is stuck in England due to the Icelandic volcano that grounded all aircraft.  I was kind of bummed out earlier today and went to Best Buy to look for CD bargains (came out with The Clash - London Calling).

I decided that buying my grand-daughter a little something was surely a way to brighten spirits stateside.  I was not wrong.  We loved it.  No, it isn't has wonderful as Jungle Book (original).  How could it possibly be expected to be as wonderful - Most of the cast from the original are long dead.

I've just recently even become aware of this sequel to the 1967 (was it?) original. Well, THAT movie will always have a special place in my heart as I remember seeing it when it first came out when I was, like ten. The 'Jungle Book 2', I thought had a real good storyline and production. Most of the beloved jungle characters return here, like Baloo, Bagheera, Kaa, Sonny (the baby elephant), Shere Khan and the two vultures (did they even have names?). The animation is (as always, of course) top rate. My two favorite scenes were where Mowgli and Baloo step over to King Louie's temple to join everyone else for a memorable dance number while there were animals strutting their stuff on EVERY square inch of the temple's foundation and the dramatic / eerie scene where Mowgli, the girl and Baloo try to draw Shere Khan away by secretly banging on the temple's ancient gongs and the tiger ends up being trapped... (you'd have to see the movie yourself). Their remake of ""The Bare Necessities"" was good. A movie that the whole family could enjoy on especially a rainy night.

749163,A3A90CELVLOUP6,B00008Y47S,"Nanciejeanne ""Enjay""","[8, 12]","I had very low expectations for this movie.  I was very disappointed in Return to Neverland, more disappointed with Lilo and Stitch, and didn't even bother seeing Treasure Planet (I noticed that I wasn't alone.)  When I heard Disney was remaking one of my favorite classics, I thought ""Oh, no!""  But we went.1. The first thing I noticed was the animation.  It looked like the original.  No, it isn't beautiful and it doesn't look like the stuff we are used to now, but it looks like the Disney stuff from the Classic era.  Therefore Baloo looks like Baloo, Mowgli, Kaa, etc. look like they did before.  I am glad they didn't try to re-draw them.  When they do put in more modern stuff, you really notice it and it is sort of distracting.  (Check out the log in the river and the waterfall.)2. Next, the voices.  I actually thought this Mowgli (Osment) was better than the original.  If you really listen to the original, Mowgli isn't too great an actor.  Just the director's kid who they stuck in because they needed a kid's voice.  Shere-Khan, Kaa, Bagiera, the Elephant Patrol, etc.--I thought the voices were GREAT.  Unfortunately, the one I thought I would like the most, I liked the least.  John Goodman.  It sounded like the jazzy, Baloo, went south.  He traded in his jazz for zydeco.  Close, but too much southern-drawl accent.  If they wanted to go this route, even Harry Connick, Jr. would have been better, at least he would have been a little jazzy.3. Music  Not enough.  Man, do we all miss Howard Ashman.  The background stuff IS good.  Nice trumpets, jazz sound.  The songs were more like top 40, though.  The King Louie stuff isn't even close to Louie Prima, so don't expect it.  Here, they kinda rip off ""I just can't wait to be king"" from Lion King--minus the quality of the music.  Still, at least they had some original (i.e. new) music.4. Characters.  What is the deal with this baby character?  Did they really need a side-kick this bad?  They should have skipped him completely.  My 4-year olds laughed at him here and there, but he should have been cut.  The vultures, the elephants, Kaa, Shere-Khan have no musical numbers.  What a shame.  Their voices were good and their characters could have been better with a song or two.  (Provided they were decent songs.)  I never read Kiplings version, so I don't know if it follows the book.  I know that Walt Disney told the original writers to forget about Kipling in the original, so I imagine this doesn't follow the book either.  So what.  It is Disney--do any of them follow the original stories too well?4.  Last word (if you are still bothering to read this)  No, it isn't the original.  I know it is probably just a money-making venture for Disney to re-do this and cash in on all the parents nostalgia.  But, I will continue to pay for (and enjoy mostly) the newer kids stuff.  If they see how much money they can make on a mediocre movie, maybe it will entice them to make more great ones to make even more money. I hope so.  In the meantime, seeing this remake is a lot like going to a class reunion--you will be happy to see your old friends again, but things won't be quite the same. Still, I wouldn't have missed it.",4,"It is not the original, but still good.",1045440000,"02 17, 2003",2003,3199,"['had', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'more', 'disappointed', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'seeing', 'Treasure', 'Planet', 'noticed', 'was', ""n't"", 'alone', 'When', 'heard', 'Disney', 'was', 'remaking', 'one', 'favorite', 'classics', 'thought', 'Oh', 'went.1', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'animation', 'looked', 'original', 'No', ""n't"", 'beautiful', ""n't"", 'look', 'stuff', 'are', 'used', 'now', 'Disney', 'stuff', 'Classic', 'era', 'Therefore', 'Baloo', 'Baloo', 'Mowgli', 'Kaa', 'etc', 'look', 'did', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 're-draw', 'When', 'do', 'put', 'more', 'modern', 'stuff', 'really', 'notice', 'sort', 'distracting', 'Check', 'out', 'log', 'river', 'waterfall.', '2', 'Next', 'voices', 'actually', 'thought', 'Mowgli', 'Osment', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'really', 'listen', 'original', 'Mowgli', ""n't"", 'too', 'great', 'actor', 'Just', 'director', 'kid', 'who', 'stuck', 'needed', 'kid', 'voice', 'Shere-Khan', 'Kaa', 'Bagiera', 'Elephant', 'Patrol', 'etc.', 'thought', 'voices', 'were', 'GREAT', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'thought', 'would', 'like', 'most', 'liked', 'least', 'John', 'Goodman', 'sounded', 'jazzy', 'Baloo', 'went', 'south', 'traded', 'jazz', 'zydeco', 'Close', 'too', 'much', 'southern-drawl', 'accent', 'wanted', 'go', 'route', 'even', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'jazzy.3', 'Music', 'Not', 'enough', 'Man', 'do', 'miss', 'Howard', 'Ashman', 'background', 'stuff', 'IS', 'good', 'Nice', 'trumpets', 'jazz', 'sound', 'songs', 'were', 'more', 'top', '40', 'though', 'King', 'Louie', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'Louie', 'Prima', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Here', 'kinda', 'rip', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'king', 'Lion', 'King', 'minus', 'quality', 'music', 'Still', 'least', 'had', 'original', 'i.e', 'new', 'music.4', 'Characters', 'What', 'deal', 'baby', 'character', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'side-kick', 'bad', 'should', 'have', 'skipped', 'completely', '4-year', 'olds', 'laughed', 'here', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'vultures', 'elephants', 'Kaa', 'Shere-Khan', 'have', 'musical', 'numbers', 'What', 'shame', 'voices', 'were', 'good', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'song', 'two', 'Provided', 'were', 'decent', 'songs', 'never', 'read', 'Kiplings', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'book', 'know', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'told', 'original', 'writers', 'forget', 'Kipling', 'original', 'so', 'imagine', ""n't"", 'follow', 'book', 'So', 'what', 'Disney', 'do', 'follow', 'original', 'stories', 'too', 'well', '4', 'Last', 'word', 'are', 'still', 'bothering', 'read', 'No', ""n't"", 'original', 'know', 'probably', 'just', 'money-making', 'venture', 'Disney', 're-do', 'cash', 'parents', 'nostalgia', 'will', 'continue', 'pay', 'enjoy', 'mostly', 'newer', 'kids', 'stuff', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'can', 'make', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'maybe', 'will', 'entice', 'make', 'more', 'great', 'ones', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'hope', 'so', 'meantime', 'seeing', 'remake', 'lot', 'going', 'class', 'reunion', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'see', 'old', 'friends', 'again', 'things', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'quite', 'same', 'Still', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'missed']",N/A

As I began to watch this sequel, I tried very hard to experience it and then judge it on its own merits. All issues considered, my rating of it is explained as follows: I think it offers pleasant but unexceptional entertainment (Three Stars) and several bonus features that add one Star to my rating.My guess is that, in general, adults enjoy the special features (other than interactive games such as ""Mowgli's Jungle Ruins Maze"") more than children do. In the sequel, the plot remains faithful to the beloved Rudyard Kipling novel, this time featuring the voices of  John  Goodman, Haley Joel Osment, Mae Whitman,  and Jim Cummings. Phil Collins provided the voice of Lucky. I watched this film with several of my younger grandchildren, none of whom had seen the 1967 version. Unlike their parents and grandparents, they and other children ages 4-14 seem to think nothing of watching a film they like several times either in a theatre or a DVD of it, whether or not it is a sequel.Although a sequel offering solid entertainment to ""children of all ages,"" I doubt if it will not have the same enduring appeal from one generation to the next as do other feature length animated films produced by Disney (e.g. Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, Dumbo, Pinocchio, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) and Pixar (e.g. Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and WALL-E) nor by DreamWorks  (e.g. Antz and Shrek).

True, it does have some flaws, though. First of all, the voice acting will get annoying for purists. The actor they got to play Baloo doesn't match with Phil Harris at all. But on the plus side, Haley Joel Osment does a great job as Mowgli, and the character, while being intensely annoying in the original, has become more mature, and is a more likeable character. The film also has the addition of Shanti, the girl that lured Mowgli into the village and Ranjan, a little kid who looks up to Mowgli. It's overall a pretty good but pointless film.

And it has new songs like Jungel Ryhtem. And both Baloo and Mowgli doing solos. As the movie opens, Mowgli (Haley Joel Osment) is telling his life story, as much as he knows of it. And he is missing the jungle, and he is not allowed to cross the water. While in the jungel, Baloo (John Goodman) is missing Mowgli, and can't not cross the water to visit or bring Mowgli back to the jungle.

Mowgli once again finds himself in the jungle having a grand adventure with all of the old characters.  The only real difference is that this time he brings along two others from the &quot;man village&quot;.  But that's okay.  The story was good the first time, and because of decent writing and great casting, the story is good a second time also.  Re-doing the story was a much better choice than trying to make some wierd interpretation, or just a lazily written sequel.The casting in this movie is really good, with voices that sound authentic enough that you don't bother comparing them to the original.  Doubtless that was a big help to making this a best-ever sequel.The music in this movie was also very good.  Reusing some of the old music, tinkering around with some new mixes, and adding some brand new scores brought together a totally fun soundtrack.  The Smashing Pumpkins never before sounded this good.While not of the same calaber as the original Jungle Book, JB2 comes in a close second and is far better than I really expected of a sequel considering Disney's reputation for stupid, cheap, straight-to-video sequels.

749172,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008Y47S,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","What it this? Disney's original animated film `The Jungle Book' was made in 1967, and after almost 40 years they released a sequel `The Jungle Book 2.' What is the point of doing this anyway?To be fair, the sequel is not a horrible film. It has more colors (more light colors in the jungle) and comes with the original's exhilarating `Bare Necessities.' Who can dislike this song? And the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done, letting us into the world of the wild child Mowgli and his friends.But after that, about 10 minutes or so, the film suddenly starts to look not-so-ambitious attempt to re-tell the story of the original, which should have been ended 40 years ago. In this sequel Mowgli, who is fed up with the rules of the village, goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear Baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone. Now Baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number.But we are not so happy. That is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film's conclusion, and partly because we know the same story has just begun again. The difference between the 1967 version and this one is that Shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy Ranjan, but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable.After all, the problem is not the fact that the story of `The Jungle Book 2' in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made 40 years ago. The real drawback is that in `JB2' nothing interesting happens except the last 10 minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill Mowgli. The film provides musical scenes (which are decent themselves), but they only stretch the thin story. Even though I love the song Bare Necessities, I don't want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs 72 minutes.To me (I am living in Japan) the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so-so film `Return to Neverland' `The Jungle Book 2' was originally made for video, and then was chosen for theatrical release in USA and UK. That they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company's choice of the material for the sequel.",2,This Sequel Is Not So Bad.

749173,AID8OJP77VK6Y,B00008Y47S,unicornelia,"[2, 3]","I actually purchased this movie after hearing the decent reviews it received. It admittedly wasn't the most horrible sequel ever. But it came pretty close. The story is all rehash. The one quote by Mowgli's foster father: &quot;YOU DELIBERATELY DISOBEYED ME!&quot; is ripped right from the &quot;Lion King,&quot; where Mufasa tells Simba the same exact thing. The story itself is feeble at best. Shanti is a shallow character who can't really remind you of anyone becuase she's just...there. There's no feeling or creativity in her. I have seen decent Disney sequels with characters I've actually been able to feel for (ie, &quot;101 Dalmatians II&quot; &amp; &quot;Cinderella II&quot;), but this unfortunately isn't one of them. The songs are...how shall we put this, corny? Cheesy? One of those food-related words that generally means &quot;bad&quot; but not &quot;painful to listen to, just annoying.&quot;Okay, the one song with the monkeys (WHY did they not include King Louie, I liked him?!) is all right. Kind of catchy--if I remember correctly. I can't think of the tune right now. But the voice of John Goodman as Baloo just doesn't fit. He's done alot of characters and done them well (ie, Sulley from Monsters Inc, NOT MIKE WAZOWSKI, who was played by Billy Crystal), but Baloo's character doesn't mesh with his voice; the two don't work together. *shrug* It's difficult to explain. It just does not sound right, it's not a good mix.Ths plot is basically just a redo of the original, with Shere Kahn out stalking Mowgli for revenge and a pretty dumb new vulture named Lucky. The humor is almost not present; I can't remember laughing. It kept me moderately entertained for maybe an hour, then I kinda wished it was over, then I decided I'd probably never end up watching it again and regretting that I'd bought the thing! This movie did have a FEW things going for it, I do know that much....I just can't seem to recall what they were. Which means it gave me a bad impression.

749174,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00008Y47S,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[34, 36]","Some of the reviews here appear abit premature (the last couple I read were from people who hadn't even seen the movie--they judged it from the trailer!). In many respects Jungle Book 2 could, on the surface, look like a cash-in similar to the Peter Pan sequel Return to Neverland (that film had been planned as a direct-to-video release originally but turned out looking so good that it was released theatrically). That's hardly the case with Jungle Book 2.The animation uses many of the design elements from the original film and incorporates some nice computer generated imagery as well. It's a bit surprising that folks expect the voices of the original actors. The original Jungle Book was released in 1967 (if memory serves) and all the original actors have been dead for quite some time.The voice casting for the sequel is quite good. Haley Joel Osmond (A.I., The Sixth Sense)makes a fine Mowogli and John Goodman as Baloo captures his character perfectly without imitating the late Phil Harris. Equally good are Jim Cummings (in dual roles as both Col Hathi and the snake...whose name escapes me at the moment. Cummings also is the present day voice for Winnie The Pooh). Bob Joles manages to recall Sebastian Cabot in his portrayal of Bagheera. It's a pity his character isn't more central to the story like in the original. Phil Collins steps in as Lucky a new Vulture to torture Sheer Khan with bad puns, jokes and timing. It's ironic that Collins plays the role as the quartet of vultures from the original film were caricatures of The Beatles.The script is both witty and the pacing swift. Children won't get bored and, yes, adults just might be entertained. Jungle Book 2 isn't a sequel as much of an update of the original film with more contemporary references. The conflict is once again between Mowgli and Shere Khan; Shere Kahn has returned to the jungle looking for revenge against the man cub. Baloo (brilliantly played by John Goodman)is bored out of his mind and rushes out to find Mowgoli again as he misses his buddy. Mowogli takes to the jungle again with Baloo when Shanti (the little girl who tempted Mowogli into the man village in the first place)alerts the town to Baloo's presence. She believes Baloo to be a dangerous wild animal. At the same time Shere Kahn has entered the village looking for Mowogli and is attacked by the villagers who believe he is the wild animal Shanti alerted them to.Shanti, feeling guilty for her treatment of her best friend Mowogli, goes in search of Mowogli. In the process, she becomes lost in the jungle but proves she's every bit as tough as Mowogli. The film rushes to a showdown between Shere Kahn, Baloo Mowogli and Shanti in the city of ruins.The songs are engaging (and, yes, a number of classic songs turn up again slightly jazzed up for modern audiences. These classics manage to retain their flair and charm despite the passage of 35 years). The fluid animation, acting and witty script are not captured very well in the trailer that played late last year and early this year. The Jungle Book 2 is every bit a worthy sequel to the original. While it doesn't quite live up to the original film's spectacle and songs, it recaptures much of the fun of the first film without pandering to its audience.My children were captivated by the film and I found it enjoyable as well. I have to admit I had my doubts but this fine production quickly won me over. It's definitely worth a visit to the theater to catch.",4,Pleasing sequel to classic original,1045440000,"02 17, 2003",2003,3478,"['reviews', 'here', 'appear', 'abit', 'premature', 'last', 'couple', 'read', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'seen', 'movie', 'judged', 'trailer', 'many', 'respects', 'Jungle', 'Book', '2', 'could', 'surface', 'look', 'cash-in', 'similar', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'sequel', 'Return', 'Neverland', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'planned', 'direct-to-video', 'release', 'originally', 'turned', 'out', 'looking', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'hardly', 'case', 'Jungle', 'Book', '2.The', 'animation', 'many', 'design', 'elements', 'original', 'film', 'nice', 'computer', 'generated', 'imagery', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'surprising', 'folks', 'expect', 'voices', 'original', 'actors', 'original', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'was', 'released', '1967', 'memory', 'serves', 'original', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'dead', 'quite', 'time.The', 'voice', 'casting', 'sequel', 'quite', 'good', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osmond', 'A.I.', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'fine', 'Mowogli', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Baloo', 'character', 'perfectly', 'imitating', 'late', 'Phil', 'Harris', 'Equally', 'good', 'are', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'dual', 'roles', 'Col', 'Hathi', 'snake', 'name', 'moment', 'Cummings', 'also', 'present', 'day', 'voice', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Bob', 'Joles', 'recall', 'Sebastian', 'Cabot', 'portrayal', 'Bagheera', 'pity', 'character', ""n't"", 'more', 'central', 'story', 'original', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'steps', 'Lucky', 'new', 'Vulture', 'torture', 'Sheer', 'Khan', 'bad', 'puns', 'jokes', 'timing', 'ironic', 'Collins', 'role', 'quartet', 'vultures', 'original', 'film', 'were', 'caricatures', 'Beatles.The', 'script', 'witty', 'pacing', 'swift', 'Children', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'yes', 'adults', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'entertained', 'Jungle', 'Book', '2', ""n't"", 'sequel', 'much', 'update', 'original', 'film', 'more', 'contemporary', 'references', 'conflict', 'once', 'again', 'Mowgli', 'Shere', 'Khan', 'Shere', 'Kahn', 'returned', 'jungle', 'looking', 'revenge', 'man', 'cub', 'Baloo', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'John', 'Goodman', 'bored', 'mind', 'out', 'find', 'Mowgoli', 'again', 'buddy', 'Mowogli', 'jungle', 'again', 'Baloo', 'when', 'Shanti', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'tempted', 'Mowogli', 'man', 'village', 'first', 'place', 'town', 'Baloo', 'presence', 'Baloo', 'be', 'dangerous', 'wild', 'animal', 'same', 'time', 'Shere', 'Kahn', 'entered', 'village', 'looking', 'Mowogli', 'attacked', 'villagers', 'who', 'believe', 'wild', 'animal', 'Shanti', 'alerted', 'to.Shanti', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'treatment', 'best', 'friend', 'Mowogli', 'search', 'Mowogli', 'process', 'lost', 'jungle', 'bit', 'as', 'tough', 'Mowogli', 'film', 'rushes', 'showdown', 'Shere', 'Kahn', 'Baloo', 'Mowogli', 'Shanti', 'city', 'ruins.The', 'songs', 'are', 'engaging', 'yes', 'number', 'classic', 'songs', 'turn', 'up', 'again', 'slightly', 'jazzed', 'up', 'modern', 'audiences', 'classics', 'manage', 'retain', 'flair', 'charm', 'passage', '35', 'years', 'fluid', 'animation', 'acting', 'witty', 'script', 'are', 'not', 'captured', 'very', 'well', 'trailer', 'played', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'early', 'year', 'Jungle', 'Book', '2', 'bit', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'original', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'film', 'spectacle', 'songs', 'much', 'fun', 'first', 'film', 'pandering', 'audience.My', 'children', 'were', 'captivated', 'film', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'admit', 'had', 'doubts', 'fine', 'production', 'quickly', 'won', 'over', 'definitely', 'worth', 'visit', 'theater', 'catch']",N/A
