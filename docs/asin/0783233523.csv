64934,A1WXCMB52BON8N,0783233523,A Customer,"[3, 6]","Despite the requisite Hollywood cliches, this is a great film. Dian Fossey didn't know what she was getting into when she volunteered to go to Africa, working for Dr. Louis Leakey in taking a census of the endangered Mountain Gorillas. She didn't realise she was expected to work alone, in a remote mountain hut, and in a country torn by civil war...But she came to love the subjects of her study so much that nothing could prize her from the mountain, not even the (human) man she eventually fell in love with. ""When you look deep into a gorilla's eyes,"" she wrote, ""your life is changed forever.""The blacks thought she was a witch, due to her reddish hair and fierce glance (captured well by actress Sigourney Weaver, although the real Dian was apparently a bit more shy than Sigourney's character). But this witchlike image actually helped to scare the poachers off. And Dian's work helped prevent the gorillas from becoming extinct. But unfortunately she was murdered by cowardly scum...black poachers in the pay of white animal traffickers. Too often the best are cut down before their life's work is finished...One other thing to note is the incredible beauty of the landscapes, filmed on location in the mountains of Rwanda. The result is a worthy tribute to this wildlife warrior, who is most now probably in Asgard, feasting at Freyja's very table (with a gorilla at her side, no doubt).",4,A few things you should know about 'Gorillas in the Mist',1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,1396,"['requisite', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'great', 'film', 'Dian', 'Fossey', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'when', 'volunteered', 'go', 'Africa', 'working', 'Dr.', 'Louis', 'Leakey', 'taking', 'census', 'endangered', 'Mountain', 'Gorillas', 'did', ""n't"", 'realise', 'was', 'expected', 'work', 'alone', 'remote', 'mountain', 'hut', 'country', 'torn', 'civil', 'war', 'came', 'love', 'subjects', 'study', 'so', 'much', 'nothing', 'could', 'prize', 'mountain', 'not', 'even', 'human', 'man', 'eventually', 'fell', 'love', 'When', 'look', 'deep', 'gorilla', 'eyes', 'wrote', 'life', 'changed', 'forever', 'blacks', 'thought', 'was', 'witch', 'due', 'reddish', 'hair', 'fierce', 'glance', 'captured', 'well', 'actress', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'real', 'Dian', 'was', 'apparently', 'bit', 'more', 'shy', 'Sigourney', 'character', 'witchlike', 'image', 'actually', 'helped', 'scare', 'poachers', 'Dian', 'work', 'helped', 'prevent', 'gorillas', 'becoming', 'extinct', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'murdered', 'cowardly', 'scum', 'black', 'poachers', 'pay', 'white', 'animal', 'traffickers', 'Too', 'often', 'best', 'are', 'cut', 'down', 'life', 'work', 'finished', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'note', 'incredible', 'beauty', 'landscapes', 'filmed', 'location', 'mountains', 'Rwanda', 'result', 'worthy', 'tribute', 'wildlife', 'warrior', 'who', 'most', 'now', 'probably', 'Asgard', 'feasting', 'Freyja', 'very', 'table', 'gorilla', 'side', 'doubt']",N/A

64940,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783233523,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 8]","I know that a lot of people really love this movie, but for me it just pushes forced melodramatics in a direction that doesn't suit the film or the message at all.  Instead of really developing characters (or `a' character) and giving us a real study of Dian Fossey's character and motives and inner demons, we are given a blank sheet littered with some colorful acting decisions by the film's star.The film centers on the work of Dian Fossey, an amateur scientist who pried her way into the mountainous regions of Rwanda to study and eventually protect the gorillas that inhabited it.  Witnessing the horrors of poaching, Dian became the name and face behind gorilla preservation, and her actions certainly helped take the creatures off the endangered species list.Still, the film lacks a human element that was needed to give Fossey a real voice.I know this is going to sound like a broad statement, but a major issue I have with 80's cinema in general is the melodramatic nature of the majority of the films.  There seems to be a lack of depth in a lot of what that decade provided us (there are certainly exceptions to this observation, but as a whole it really was weak).  `Gorillas in the Mist' isn't one of those exceptions.  It holds potential, but it meanders in its own values too much and winds up presenting something that feels almost hollow.Fossey herself appears rather one-note.  She is passionate in her convictions, but there are no layers presented to help flesh her out entirely.  They hint, slightly, to her emotional stance during the ending sequence (it's a mere voiceover where you hear her lament about not having a family) but overall she isn't given much backstory.  We are left wondering what her life was like before the gorillas.  Why did she feel so consumed by their life and their preservation, at the cost of her own happiness?  What was she running away from?  I remember feeling similar frustrations while watching the documentary `Grizzly Man' (which holds a similar story in many terms).  I wanted to know more about her, and I felt like the film wasted an opportunity to really do her story and her life justice.I also found some of the films scenes to be unconvincingly overdramatic.  I understand that all `true stories' are dramatized for greater emotional impact when Hollywood gets a hold of it, but you have to be careful not to go so far that you become unbelievable.  I'm sorry, but there is no way that Fossey would have gotten away with hitting and punching and screaming at Rwandan soldiers and not have been shot and killed; it just wouldn't have happened.Alas, Sigourney Weaver does all that she can to make this film palatable, and in most respects she pulls it off (it's not an overly remarkable performance, but she is certainly moving).  Still, it moves like a soap opera in too many moments and it lacks the depth needed to make this a poignant and lasting character study.",2,Sigourney Weaver and a lot of hot air...,1297382400,"02 11, 2011",2011,2930,"['know', 'lot', 'people', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'pushes', 'forced', 'melodramatics', 'direction', ""n't"", 'suit', 'film', 'message', 'Instead', 'really', 'developing', 'characters', 'character', 'giving', 'real', 'study', 'Dian', 'Fossey', 'character', 'motives', 'inner', 'demons', 'are', 'given', 'blank', 'sheet', 'littered', 'colorful', 'acting', 'decisions', 'film', 'star.The', 'film', 'centers', 'work', 'Dian', 'Fossey', 'amateur', 'scientist', 'who', 'pried', 'way', 'mountainous', 'regions', 'Rwanda', 'study', 'eventually', 'protect', 'gorillas', 'inhabited', 'Witnessing', 'horrors', 'poaching', 'Dian', 'became', 'name', 'face', 'gorilla', 'preservation', 'actions', 'certainly', 'helped', 'take', 'creatures', 'endangered', 'species', 'list.Still', 'film', 'human', 'element', 'was', 'needed', 'give', 'Fossey', 'real', 'voice.I', 'know', 'going', 'sound', 'broad', 'statement', 'major', 'issue', 'have', '80', 'cinema', 'general', 'melodramatic', 'nature', 'majority', 'films', 'be', 'lack', 'depth', 'lot', 'what', 'decade', 'provided', 'are', 'certainly', 'exceptions', 'observation', 'whole', 'really', 'was', 'weak', 'Gorillas', 'Mist', ""n't"", 'one', 'exceptions', 'potential', 'own', 'values', 'too', 'much', 'up', 'presenting', 'something', 'almost', 'hollow.Fossey', 'rather', 'one-note', 'passionate', 'convictions', 'are', 'layers', 'presented', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'entirely', 'hint', 'slightly', 'emotional', 'stance', 'ending', 'sequence', 'mere', 'voiceover', 'where', 'hear', 'lament', 'not', 'having', 'family', 'overall', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'backstory', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'gorillas', 'Why', 'did', 'feel', 'so', 'consumed', 'life', 'preservation', 'cost', 'own', 'happiness', 'What', 'was', 'running', 'away', 'remember', 'feeling', 'similar', 'frustrations', 'watching', 'documentary', 'Grizzly', 'Man', 'similar', 'story', 'many', 'terms', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'felt', 'film', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'really', 'do', 'story', 'life', 'justice.I', 'also', 'found', 'films', 'scenes', 'be', 'unconvincingly', 'overdramatic', 'understand', 'true', 'stories', 'are', 'dramatized', 'greater', 'emotional', 'impact', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'hold', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'become', 'unbelievable', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'way', 'Fossey', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'hitting', 'punching', 'screaming', 'Rwandan', 'soldiers', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'killed', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened.Alas', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'palatable', 'most', 'respects', 'off', 'not', 'overly', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'certainly', 'moving', 'Still', 'soap', 'opera', 'too', 'many', 'moments', 'depth', 'needed', 'make', 'poignant', 'lasting', 'character', 'study']",N/A

Occasionally public television will have something on that warrants a second glance; and recently I stumbled across PBS showing GORILLAS IN THE MIST.  As I had never seen this highly-acclaimed Sigourney Weaver movie, I pulled up a chair and watched this powerful biography of environmentalist/animal rights activist Dian Fossey.  The viewer is treated to quite the transformation of Ms. Fossey (and Weaver is the convincing vessel)--from meek, timid marm to brash, and quite frankly, petulant and neurotic radical.  By the end of this film you don't want to get on Dian Fossey's bad side; of course, several poachers and corrupt government officials do, and things kind of turn out. . .ugly.But the true wonder and awe of this beautifully filmed movie has to do with the actual contact with wild gorillas, you know, in the mist.  These aren't people dressed up as apes, these aren't trained animals--these are the real deal, with Weaver and co-star Bryan Brown and a handful of the other actors making close encounters of the very realistic kind.  Especially Weaver; as I watched her interact with the gorillas, as some of them playfully jump over her or groom her, I wondered what was going through director Michael Apted's mind.  (Probably something like, ""I hope that Lloyd's policy we have on Sigourney is in force!"")

Or Diane Fossey, the impressive gorilla researcher who was mysteriously machete'd to death for her efforts. This film cleanly, beautifully chronicles Fossey's work, starting with her chasing after Dr. Louis Leakey and ending with her tragic, unsolved murder decades later.The gorillas are beautiful, whether puppet, real or animatronic. The scenery is lavish, and the acting is intense, thought-provoking. All I can say is I was a bit resentful that Diane Fossey's lesbianism was passed over in favor of her love affair with...what's-a-name, that hunky male photog from National Geographic, will Follywood's wonders never cease.What I wish to add to this review is something on a slightly off-beat level. This film is one of the several things I cite when I argue the existence of the Sasquatch. You see, here there was never a shot of a man in a gorilla suit and for good reason. They could not achieve the effect no matter what; finally someone said, ""I will not have this movie tainted by a man in a gorilla suit."" So they couldn't accomplish it at the time this was made.Another film I always cite is2001: A Space Odysseybecause Kubrick spent the modern equivalent of about a million dollars to have custom-engineered primate suits for the film; they still looked like guys in gorilla suits. The filmInstinctwith Sir Anthony Hopkins is another I use simply to demonstrate Hollywood's ineptitude with gorilla suits.Finally there is the original, immortalPlanet Of The Apes (1968)(along with its very modern remakes), and I cite that one because the facial makeups were so astounding. If I saw that on a dark night there'd be a yellow puddle in the AIR, I'd be running so fast. Yet it is still obvious they are elaborate masks.And people say Roger Patterson's 1967 film was a man in a gorilla suit?! So, ladies and gentlemen, YES, we have all seen a real, live Bigfoot ... in Roger Patterson's film. Let's get past that and try to find some living ones today!

64954,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,0783233523,Enjolras,"[5, 6]","It's so great to see a major Hollywood production about a conservationist hero - and a good film no less.Gorillas in the Mistcovers the life of Dian Fossey, often viewed by many as a patron saint of gorilla conservation. The movie was inspired by her memoirsGorillas in the Mist, with some added liberties (such as the end of the film). Fossey herself was a relatively unsung hero (especially when compared to Jane Goodall) who almost single-handedly saved the mountain gorilla species by confronting poachers and raising public awareness of the gorillas. Although this is based on a true story, this movie has more action and suspense than most Hollywood films in theaters today. It features a civil war, roving gangs of hunters, corrupt ministry officials, messy romance, and murders of both gorillas and humans. I won't ruin the plot, but thinkIndiana Jones - The Complete Adventure CollectionmeetsPlanet Earth. All in the life of a conservation biologist!Sigourney Weaver, not always the best actress outside of sci-fi films, does a great job portraying Fossey. She starts off awkwardly, but by the middle of the film she really captures Fossey's passion. At times, she seems almost possessed and overcome with her mission, a one-man army in a war against poachers. At one point in the movie, I forgot that she ever played Ripley in theAlien Quadrilogyand became completely immersed in her acting.What makes the film all the more impressive is that the production crew filmed on location in Virungas, Rwanda. The gorillas in the film are not zoo animals or trained animal actors (as I thought the first time I watched the movie), but rather real, live wild gorillas. All of the footage with the gorillas was taken in their natural habitat, including the instances when the silverbacks charge the actors! The gorillas were so natural and photogenic that you almost suspect that they realize they're being filmed and portray their best side.I really hope one day somebody goes back to make a ""special edition"" of this film for blu-ray. At times, the video quality is a bit grainy and could really benefit from enhancements. The beautiful imagery in the film - the green mountains, close-ups of gorillas, etc. - would look great in an enhanced blu-ray edition. Maybe also include some wildlife documentaries about gorillas, such asMountain Gorilla (IMAX), or a brief documentary on Fossey's life (with interviews from those who knew her). I hope this movie doesn't remain obscure - more people would benefit from seeing it and understanding the problems gorillas face in the wild.I'd love to read Fossey'sGorillas in the Mistto see how accurate the movie is. If the movie is anything near accurate, Fossey led an incredible life and had an amazing force of will.

64970,A228JH8V9Y700G,0783233523,MortensOrchid,"[13, 23]","This was a phenomenal movie, no question about that.  Sigorney Weaver did a bang up job as Dian Fossey and showed us a lush landscape of Africa.  We were also introduced to the Fossey cause of preserving the endangered mountain gorilla and wildlife, as well as the problems with poaching.  What we were not shown in true light was the real woman Dian Fossey was, and had they not glossed over certain things and made this movie Hollywood she might not have been so appealing to the general public.Dian Fossey, as was portrayed as the movie unfolded, was a physical therapist from California who became fascinated with the continent of Africa and the gorillas of Rwanda.  Having little to no training in anthropology and animal behavior but getting the ok from a prominent anthropologist, Dr. Leaky,  Dian Fossey embarked on what would become her life's work: to study and care for the gorilla.Dian loved being in Africa and enjoyed her work with the gorillas, there is no doubt about that, but had the general public read about other aspects of her residence there they would not have found her very appealing.  As time went on she became more and more paranoid and vicious.  The lifestyle of living on a secuded mountaintop surrounded with your only companions being upper primates other than humans does not make for the most socially well adjusted person.  Although the relationship she had in the movie was otherwise happy, Dian had many affairs with married men (and even with Dr. Leaky himself) which would leave her devistated and rejected.  She had affairs with research fellows, tourists, cameramen, and just about anyone who came to her camp.  As the affairs would end, she would become more bitter, but because she was lonely she would start others again with the next unavailable.  It was a vicious cycle.  She also was very hung up on a research assistant who was half her age, then once he took up with another woman she filled her journals with jealous entriesDian began to see the territory as hers, and it certainly wasn't as she was a guest in their country.  Many were driven away, others quit on her because they couldn't stand being around her temper tantrums and irrational behavior.  A research fellowship couple by name of Webster later wrote an account of Dian not actually spending as much time with the gorilla troups as she implied because she was passed out drunk most of the time.  She shunned the government officials who tried to open the area more towards tourism and created many enemies within the higher ups.  Poaching had always been a problem, and when her beloved Digit was killed by the poachers I'm sure that devistated her.  She was naturally vicious towards poachers, but had also taken it upon herself to take out vigalante justice on them, which was not her official decission to make.  She was petty, selfish and tyranical who had high standards that even she did not live up to.Dian Fossey could have been killed by any number of people, recent theories have now pointed to a connection between her murder and the Rwandan ethnic cleansing from 1994.  Who knows?  If she were alive today, she would probably say she was the best and the worst thing ever to happen to the species.

They run far faster then any person, and are far far stronger. There is no way that anyone could have out run them in that setting. It's pure jungle, you need to move branches out of your way no matter where you go. The only man made trails are almost never frequented by gorillas.

Heads up to Warner Brothers for giving us a glimpse into the world of a woman who ultimately gave her life to save and protect the few mountain gorillas remaining in Africa. Dian devoted 18 years of her life to researching and understanding these wonderful primates. This film shows Dian's vunerable side along with her determined side to do what ever it took to save the gorillas who are supposed to be protected by the parks. Sigourney Weaver shines in her role and was the perfect choice for this movie. She approached it with reckless abandon. Although Dian lost her life trying to save the remaining gorillas, we get to see how one person was responsible for doing so much for the gorillas. With heartwarming scenes with her and her beloved Digit, to heartbreaking scenes like when she had to turn over Pucker, the infant gorilla she nursed back to health, to a zoo and the horrible death of Digit, this movie captivates you from beginning to end. For anyone who is interested in the few remaining mountain gorillas, this movie will really open your eyes and make you route for Dian. Although with a tragic ending with Dian's death and burial next to Digit, it's a true love story not only between her and Bob Campbell, but between her and the gorillas she loved so much.

In my opinion, it's these moments that make the movie worth seeing.The cinematography is also awe-inspiring with beautiful footage of the jungle landscape.Most of this movie was filmed in Rwanda and Kenya.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 1999) is perfect in video and audio quality.  It has five extras.  One of these extras is a brief ""Making of Featurette"" where you get to see the real Dian Fossey.  This featurette is a definite must-see.In conclusion, this movie brilliantly shows how one woman went to extremes to save the Mountain Gorilla from extinction!!(1988;  2 hours, 10 min;  wide screen;  18 scenes)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5,"""Get off my mountain!!""",1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,2011,"['XXXXX', 'When', 'Dian', 'Fossey', '[', '1932', '1985', ']', 'arrived', 'Africa', 'mountain', 'gorilla', 'was', 'doomed', 'extinction', 'result', 'life', 'work', 'was', 'significant', 'decrease', 'poaching', 'survival', 'species.The', 'gorilla', 'population', 'grow', 'spirit', 'achievement', 'above', 'found', 'printed', 'on-screen', 'end', 'fabulous', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'Dian', 'Fossey', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'work', 'Rwanda', 'located', 'central', 'eastern', 'Africa', 'Mountain', 'Gorillas', 'extremes', 'went', 'too', 'protect', 'spring', '2010', 'estimated', 'total', 'number', 'Mountain', 'Gorillas', 'was', '800', 'Remember', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'not', 'go', 'deeply', 'Fossey', 'life', 'efforts', 'protect', 'Mountain', 'Gorilla', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'learn', 'Fossey', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'frustrated', 'fact', 'many', 'promoters', 'movie', 'state', 'subtitle', 'Story', 'Dian', 'Fossey', 'NO', 'subtitle', 'Adventure', 'Dian', 'Fossey', 'was', 'impressed', 'scenes', 'gorillas', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'real', 'stars', 'movie', 'way', 'live', 'footage', 'was', 'blended', 'people', 'gorilla', 'costumes', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'difference', 'Everything', 'equally', 'real.There', 'were', 'moments', 'felt', 'genuine', 'awe', 'opinion', 'moments', 'make', 'movie', 'seeing.The', 'cinematography', 'also', 'awe-inspiring', 'beautiful', 'footage', 'jungle', 'landscape.Most', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Rwanda', 'Kenya.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '1999', 'perfect', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'five', 'extras', 'One', 'extras', 'brief', 'Making', 'Featurette', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'real', 'Dian', 'Fossey', 'featurette', 'definite', 'must-see.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'how', 'one', 'woman', 'went', 'extremes', 'save', 'Mountain', 'Gorilla', 'extinction', '1988', '2', 'hours', '10', 'min', 'wide', 'screen', '18', 'scenes', 'lt', 'lt', 'Stephen', 'Pletko', 'London', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '>', '>', 'XXXXX']",N/A
