1019567,A21ERQVE9KUDJS,B000I9Z2CY,Harry Orwell,"[29, 32]","Five Stars for the movie and for David Janssen.I have seen this TV movie numerous times and can only hope that this release will be the full version, and remastered to some degree. Smile Jenny You're Dead was the second pilot for the TV series Harry O.  It set the standard for this wonderful, fondly remembered show.  Janssen is just superb!  He was born to play this role and has just the right melancholy touch; he underplays to perfection.  And his first person narration allows us in on his personal world.The supporting cast is mostly terrific too.  Andrea Marcovicci plays the beautiful, vulnerable Jenny of the title.  She is both lovely and fragile.  It's a great performance, and it's easy to see why Harry feels protective and ultimately falls in love with her.  Her stalker is played by Zalman King.  Another great performance!  King makes a first rate psychopath.  Other fine performances come from TV veteran John Anderson, Clu Gulager, and a very young and confidently precocious Jodie Foster.  The atmospheric incidental music and direction by Jerry Thorpe, (one of TV's finest from that era) make for a first class package.  A series had to follow!As I say, I hope this DVD Release is quickly followed by the entire series with some extras - PLEASE!  Commentaries from Henry Darrow, Anthony Zerbe, Les Lannom (the inimitable Lester) and other series regulars would be real treat.  One can but hope.Enjoy!",5,Telephones bug me!,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1421,"['Five', 'Stars', 'movie', 'David', 'Janssen.I', 'have', 'seen', 'TV', 'movie', 'numerous', 'times', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'release', 'will', 'be', 'full', 'version', 'remastered', 'degree', 'Smile', 'Jenny', ""'re"", 'Dead', 'was', 'second', 'pilot', 'TV', 'series', 'Harry', 'O', 'set', 'standard', 'wonderful', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'show', 'Janssen', 'just', 'superb', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'role', 'just', 'right', 'melancholy', 'touch', 'perfection', 'first', 'person', 'narration', 'personal', 'world.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'mostly', 'terrific', 'too', 'Andrea', 'Marcovicci', 'beautiful', 'vulnerable', 'Jenny', 'title', 'lovely', 'fragile', 'great', 'performance', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Harry', 'protective', 'ultimately', 'love', 'stalker', 'played', 'Zalman', 'King', 'great', 'performance', 'King', 'first', 'rate', 'psychopath', 'Other', 'fine', 'performances', 'come', 'TV', 'veteran', 'John', 'Anderson', 'Clu', 'Gulager', 'very', 'young', 'confidently', 'precocious', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'atmospheric', 'incidental', 'music', 'direction', 'Jerry', 'Thorpe', 'one', 'TV', 'finest', 'era', 'make', 'first', 'class', 'package', 'A', 'series', 'had', 'follow', 'say', 'hope', 'DVD', 'Release', 'quickly', 'followed', 'entire', 'series', 'extras', 'PLEASE', 'Commentaries', 'Henry', 'Darrow', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Les', 'Lannom', 'inimitable', 'Lester', 'other', 'series', 'regulars', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'treat', 'One', 'can', 'hope.Enjoy']","Smile Jenny You're Dead (1974 TV movie / ""Harry O"" pilot)"

1019569,A3VKT6WV3UNRE3,B000I9Z2CY,"Joel, Holden ""Barry Eysman MY REAL NAME""","[17, 17]","Smile, Jenny, You're Dead is still excellent. It is mood and plot and characterization and  dialogue. It's David Janssen as private detective Harry O. He is perfect. Every word, every move, every inflection, it's his alone. You hear him thinking, and he's every bit as good at this as he was as Richard Kimble. And that's really saying something too. From his very first scene, he is hypnotizing. He could convey with  the slightest gesture.He makes Harry funny, iconoclastic, wry and deeply human, deeply compassionate. The cast is impeccable. The storyline riveting. The writer was Howard Rodman. One of the best. John Anderson, Andrea Marcovicci, Clu Gulager, Jodie Foster and Howard de Silva put their interpretations on the words  and make them their own. When Harry says to Jenny, ""You move me, I want you,"" our hearts go out to him, and when it's his duty to  tell of death a second time to a person whose world has just ended, what else could you do but hold her through the night, let her cry, admit to yourself that you fell in love with her then and knowing of course, it can lead in only one direction.I'm told David Janssen always gave credit to his writers. As he should, but also for himself, and for this ensemble cast, and superb direction by Jerry Thorpe,  this is a minor miracle or a major one. His character and the film fit beautifully. Everything is so eloquent and eloquent, and you feel like crying because there's been a point of life touched here, and we have the  honor, thanks to very talented people, to see such a good and fine thing.It is suspenseful and has  an excellent framework, so you won't be disappointed in that either. That boat Harry O was constantly working on, name of THE ANSWER, and the bus he  rode "" because you can sit and look out the window and think. Try it sometime."" And because his car was always in the shop and we just had to get David Janssen on the bus again. All of these things and more became endearing to us.And when he smiled, the whole world is incandescent. This is a treasure trove, this movie, and it is all life-giving,  every word and every scene with these actors saying Howard Rodman's lovingly crafted, thoughtful, profound dialogue, with such relish, and how because  it's been for something.And sometimes all you can do for a person in pain is to hold them through the night, admit to yourself you have fallen in love with them, and prepare to say goodbye. And maybe this is as close to the answer as you can get.

Now us die hard David Janssen and Harry O fans can finally have all of the Harry O show on disc. The picture and sound quality is stellar. It is a great transfer from a great print I do not think this show looked that good when I saw it on TV in 1974. I loved it! It is your typical made for TV movie but is a good story and really gives you insight into the Harry O character that he will portray in the series. I would say this is a must for anyone planning on watching the whole series on DVD. I would start with the first two pilots. This one and the other one that comes in the season one DVD set. It is true there are no bonus's and it just comes in a standard DVD case but who needs extras it is the movie you really want to watch. As for the price it is fair for an on demand product that is made for a very limited audience that probably is also the reason there are no extras. I would give an A+ to Warner Bros TV for finally dusting off this long lost TV movie and making it available for  us to enjoy again! It is will worth the price of admission.,5,"Smily Jenny, Your'e Dead.
