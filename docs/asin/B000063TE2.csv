695836,A3DWUM6SN3N3NR,B000063TE2,Brian Wallace (Co-author of It's Not Your Hair),"[1, 1]","A stunning achievement. a-ha has created an amazing collection of songs that are performed so beautifully and hypnotically in this live performance. From rocking early numbers such as &#65533;I&#65533;ve been Losing You&#65533; to recent highpoints such as &#65533;You&#65533;ll Never Get Over Me,&#65533; a-ha produces smile after smile after smile on this brilliant musical escapade. Vocals are so strong after all these years and the players have become masterful in their art. The songwriting has touches of male and female nuances/perspectives and the background vocalist complements Harket so well.I am completely in awe of this band that thrives despite being mostly laid off by the idiotic American music market and taking seven years off! Since 2000 my speakers have kept a steady flow of these lovely songs and Harket&#65533;s solo work.When you take strong players, an immensely unique, untouchable voice and eternally divined songwriting, you simply do not go wrong. Persistence pays off big time throughout this work &#65533; which I consider to be one of the most important musical offerings of the past five years, at least.Bowie once wrote of one d*** song making him cry. Number 10 on this work does it for me.This disc is a masterpiece!",5,19 stars on this work,1045094400,"02 13, 2003",2003,1254,"['stunning', 'achievement', 'a-ha', 'created', 'amazing', 'collection', 'songs', 'are', 'performed', 'so', 'beautifully', 'hypnotically', 'live', 'performance', 'rocking', 'early', 'numbers', 'such', '65533', '65533', 've', 'been', 'Losing', '65533', 'recent', 'highpoints', 'such', '65533', '65533', 'll', 'Never', 'Get', 'Me', '65533', 'a-ha', 'produces', 'smile', 'smile', 'smile', 'brilliant', 'musical', 'escapade', 'Vocals', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'years', 'players', 'have', 'become', 'masterful', 'art', 'songwriting', 'touches', 'male', 'female', 'nuances/perspectives', 'background', 'vocalist', 'complements', 'Harket', 'so', 'well.I', 'am', 'completely', 'awe', 'band', 'being', 'mostly', 'laid', 'off', 'idiotic', 'American', 'music', 'market', 'taking', 'seven', 'years', '2000', 'speakers', 'have', 'kept', 'steady', 'flow', 'lovely', 'songs', 'Harket', '65533', 'solo', 'take', 'strong', 'players', 'immensely', 'unique', 'untouchable', 'voice', 'eternally', 'divined', 'songwriting', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'Persistence', 'big', 'time', 'work', '65533', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'musical', 'offerings', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'least.Bowie', 'once', 'wrote', 'one', 'd***', 'song', 'making', 'cry', 'Number', '10', 'work', 'me.This', 'disc', 'masterpiece']",N/A

I am proud of my heritage and proud to see my homeboys doing so well. As pointed out, A-ha is very big outside of America.I really do like this DVD and play it every so often. Song selection is good and every song gets performed professionally to a T. I at first kind of balked at the performance on ""Losing You"" but it eventually grew on me and now it sounds as it does on the Scoundrel Days album to me.The female vocalist, Annilee does bring a welcome addition in the performance. A-ha at least in this concert is not overwhelmingly visual as far as stage props and lighting goes. It is adequate but I want to believe it is because A-ha wants the audience focusing totally on their performance.I heard that they had toured again recently. I sure do hope they release at least one more DVD like this one. They definitely cleared their own path in the music world and there will never be another like them.

What has changed after nearly 20 years:  A-ha in concert presents a more mature, progressive sound in this concert.  Their last live video in the 90s - Live in South America was more commercial and really should be RE-RELEASED.  The hits are here, but the overall mood feels more distinctly European and serious and isn't the 'young' A-ha that we all grew up with.  Nonetheless, the guys still look great - Morten Harket has aged well and still has his falsetto.Note: The live CD set mentioned here by another reviewer - How Can I Sleep With Your Voice in My Head - is great and has even more songs and is recommended for those needing their A-ha fix.",4,Morten & Gang,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,759,"['are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'official', 'live', 'documents', 'A-ha', 'try', 'youtube', 'so', 'was', 'pretty', 'welcome', 'What', 'changed', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'A-ha', 'concert', 'presents', 'more', 'mature', 'progressive', 'sound', 'concert', 'last', 'live', 'video', '90s', 'Live', 'South', 'America', 'was', 'more', 'commercial', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'RE-RELEASED', 'hits', 'are', 'here', 'overall', 'mood', 'feels', 'more', 'distinctly', 'European', 'serious', ""n't"", ""'young"", 'A-ha', 'grew', 'up', 'Nonetheless', 'guys', 'still', 'look', 'great', 'Morten', 'Harket', 'aged', 'well', 'still', 'falsetto.Note', 'live', 'CD', 'set', 'mentioned', 'here', 'reviewer', 'How', 'Can', 'Sleep', 'Your', 'Voice', 'My', 'Head', 'great', 'even', 'more', 'songs', 'recommended', 'needing', 'A-ha', 'fix']",N/A

I found a USA non-PAL formatfinally and this disk is loaded with extra's.Great live concert of the 2000 &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot;tour peformed in their native Norway Spring 2001.Great sounding, many older favorites mixed with their newsongs and sound. Very enjoyable group, adult songs playedwith their usual class and no frills adds up to a better thanaverage pop concert. Nice lighting not overdone.  What Ithink makes this whole DVD worth the price is the 4 videosfrom &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot;, especially enjoyed the &quot;Velvet&quot;clip, disturbing in a macabre way but its nice to see A-ha nottake itself so seriously, thats what I like most about gettingto know the years I'd missed when the USA decided to pull theplug on these talented outfit after their late 1980's 2nd collection. Great to have them back performing. Also, live interviews mixed with what A-ha members (side solo projects)have been doing from (1994'-2000)when they went their own ways.They are making their best music now and look forward to themchangeing their minds and come back to the states for some shows.",5,Well worth seeking out....,1038528000,"11 29, 2002",2002,1178,"['DVD', 'A-ha', 'live', 'Vallhall', 'HOMECOMING', ""wasn'tthe"", 'easiest', 'find', 'found', 'USA', 'non-PAL', 'formatfinally', 'disk', 'loaded', ""extra's.Great"", 'live', 'concert', '2000', 'quot', 'Minor', 'Earth', 'Major', 'Sky', 'quot', 'tour', 'peformed', 'native', 'Norway', 'Spring', '2001.Great', 'sounding', 'many', 'older', 'favorites', 'mixed', 'newsongs', 'sound', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'group', 'adult', 'songs', 'playedwith', 'usual', 'class', 'frills', 'up', 'better', 'thanaverage', 'pop', 'concert', 'Nice', 'lighting', 'not', 'overdone', 'What', 'Ithink', 'whole', 'DVD', 'price', '4', 'videosfrom', 'quot', 'Minor', 'Earth', 'Major', 'Sky', 'quot', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Velvet', 'quot', 'clip', 'disturbing', 'macabre', 'way', 'nice', 'see', 'A-ha', 'nottake', 'so', 'seriously', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'gettingto', 'know', 'years', ""'d"", 'missed', 'when', 'USA', 'decided', 'pull', 'theplug', 'talented', 'outfit', 'late', '1980', '2nd', 'collection', 'Great', 'have', 'back', 'performing', 'Also', 'live', 'interviews', 'mixed', 'what', 'A-ha', 'members', 'side', 'solo', 'projects', 'have', 'been', 'doing', ""1994'-2000"", 'when', 'went', 'own', 'ways.They', 'are', 'making', 'best', 'music', 'now', 'look', 'forward', 'themchangeing', 'minds', 'come', 'back', 'states', 'shows']",N/A

And just as suddenly, about 2 1/2 years ago I was watching a show on VH-1 called Top 100 One Hit Wonders and was shocked to find out that they never had another hit in the US but stayed on the charts consistently in Europe.  And just like that, a new door was opened.  Had it not been for that little 3 minutes of footage, who knows what I would be doing today?People think I'm crazy for liking an ""80s band"" so much, when my tastes are otherwise.  They say ""What, you like big hair and day glo and all that shmaltz? PL-EEASE.""  If you think so too, you just don't get it.  They've since changed their wardrobe (and you have too! Don't deny it!) and toned down their hair.  Pop this in your player and all doubts will be erased about their 80s fluff.This was the first of many a-ha things I collected, everytime it amazes me.  It's not cheesy pop music, it's artsy and really about musicianship.  Sure, they're cute pinup boys and used that to their advantage (and I still have their posters everywhere in my house and on my desk at work - tee hee!), but listen to the music and it goes much deeper than that.  This is genuine, they have integrity, and they write great songs.  The special features are also great as they give you insights into their inspirations and how they aged like fine wine over the years.They put on a fantastic show in this DVD.  And I was so excited as I'm going to New York in September to see them for their triumphant return to the US.  I gush about them to everyone I meet, and even turned a few on to them.  I hope this will turn some more on as well.",5,Wonderful to be Back Again,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1695,"['was', 'just', 'little', 'kid', 'when', 'Take', 'Me', 'hit', 'airwaves', 'remember', 'cutting', 'edge', 'video', 'so', 'well', 'just', 'suddenly', '2', '1/2', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'watching', 'show', 'VH-1', 'called', 'Top', '100', 'One', 'Hit', 'Wonders', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'out', 'never', 'had', 'hit', 'US', 'stayed', 'charts', 'consistently', 'Europe', 'just', 'new', 'door', 'was', 'opened', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'little', '3', 'minutes', 'footage', 'who', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'today', 'People', 'think', ""'m"", 'crazy', 'liking', '80s', 'band', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'tastes', 'are', 'otherwise', 'say', 'What', 'like', 'big', 'hair', 'day', 'glo', 'shmaltz', 'PL-EEASE', 'think', 'so', 'too', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'wardrobe', 'have', 'too', 'Do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'toned', 'down', 'hair', 'Pop', 'player', 'doubts', 'will', 'be', 'erased', '80s', 'fluff.This', 'was', 'first', 'many', 'a-ha', 'things', 'collected', 'everytime', 'not', 'cheesy', 'pop', 'music', 'artsy', 'really', 'musicianship', 'Sure', ""'re"", 'cute', 'pinup', 'boys', 'used', 'advantage', 'still', 'have', 'posters', 'everywhere', 'house', 'desk', 'work', 'tee', 'hee', 'music', 'much', 'deeper', 'genuine', 'have', 'integrity', 'write', 'great', 'songs', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'give', 'insights', 'inspirations', 'how', 'aged', 'fine', 'wine', 'years.They', 'put', 'fantastic', 'show', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'excited', ""'m"", 'going', 'New', 'York', 'September', 'see', 'triumphant', 'return', 'US', 'gush', 'everyone', 'meet', 'even', 'turned', 'few', 'hope', 'will', 'turn', 'more', 'as', 'well']",N/A
