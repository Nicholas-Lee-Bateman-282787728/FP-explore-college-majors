1221381,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001O0TWXG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 4]","South Park Season 12 on Blu-ray is raw and absolutely hardcore!And this season dares to go ""there"" and push the button and will more than likely provoke a reaction.  But come on, its ""South Park"" and you wouldn't accept anything less right?""SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE TWELFTH SEASON"" becomes the first ""SOUTH PARK"" season to be released via the Blu-ray format in all of its uncensored glory.VIDEO & AUDIO:""SOUTH PARK"" gets its first High-Definition treatment on Blu-ray and is presented in 1080i.  As much as people may wonder why not ""1080p"", considering that ""SOUTH PARK"" is not exactly a series you are looking for extreme special effects or action scenes, the 1080i does a great job in showcasing the color.  Vibrant colors pop and overall, picture quality is clear with no grain or major artifacting.  Picture quality is very good!As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD English 5.1 , English 5.1 and Stereo.  If anything, the Comedy Central intro really puts your front speakers for a challenge with its heavy bass.  But overall, dialogue is clear and again, this is not a series where you would expect any major uses of audio.  But dialogue is clear and understandable.  Music segments definitely are heard quite clearly and more pronounced, especially the episode of ""Elementary School Musical"" which is a music-based episode.SPECIAL FEATURES:Both Blu-ray Disc and DVD versions come with the following special features.  Although the ""Behind the Scenes - About Last Night"" is a featurette featured in HD.* MINI-COMMENTARY -  Every episode has good length commentary by Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  The two definitely give insight to every episode and what prompted to have the storyline and what was in their heads at the time.  Especially an episode such as ""China Probrem"" where the two were definitely upset with the fourth Indiana Jones film and talk about what would happen if Spielberg or Lucas were to approach them about the episode.  Also, another episode featured Matt Stone sick and a doctor giving him a steroid that delayed the cold in order to give him enough time to do the vocals for an episode before he gets sick again.  Really good insight for the commentary.* Disc 1: Making Boobage: Behind the Scenes of ""Major Boobage"" - This feature showcases Kenny and Randy Marsh's scenes which pay homage to ""Heavy Metal"" from storyboards and commentary on those ""major boobage"" scenes.* Disc 2: Six Days to South Park: A Day-by-Day Making of South Park - This feature surprised me because it features six of the staff discussing how the episode ""Super Fun Time"" was created.  I was aware that in a country like Japan where in an animated series, an episode is completed right on the day of when it is supposed to be aired and sometimes arriving minutes before airing.  But I always figured in the US, these episodes were made way before it was to air.  But watching this featurette, you get an idea how the staff and crew working six days a week.  Each day is broken down and you get to hear what the crew does for each day.  From drawing out storyboards, then black holes, animating, voice work, final touches, etc.  An informative featurette.* Disc 3: Behind the Scenes: ""About Last Night"" HD - A 20-minute featurette featuring the producers commentary of the episode.  Unlike the ""Six Days to South Park"", this features on one day and the crew talking about the 24-hours they had to do this show because it aired the day after the Presidential elections and thus had to fix a lot of the show based on who won the elections and get it out to the Cartoon Network in time.""SOUTH PARK"" is one of those series that I've watched since my college years that I can't seem to stop watching.  No matter how far the series goes, how offensive the series may get, I don't really get upset.  It's because the series is known for pushing the button and taking things as far as Comedy Central will allow them.Of course, on this Blu-ray (and also on the DVD) edition, these episodes are uncensored and are filled with profanity.  But it's what makes ""South Park"" the type of series it is and personally,  I find it refreshing to have an animation targeted for adults.""SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE TWELFTH SEASON"" definitely dared to go farther in surprising people with its content.With the first episode to kick of the new season with Cartman contracting AIDS (for the episode titled ""Tonsil Trouble"")  from a transfusion mishap during his tonsillectomy and then getting back at Kyle (who ridiculed him) by injecting his blood with AIDS into his mouth while he slept was shocking.And then each episode after the other such as Britney Spears blowing off her head for the episode ""Britney's New Look"" but kept alive and yet everyone around her thinks she is fine while Kyle and Stan are in awe that these people don't recognize that she blown her head nearly off.And to see the kids testing out of how they can get high by ""cheesing"" by having their face behind a male cat and using another cat to provoke it, thus making the male cat pee on the person's face and making them get high.  To the episode of ""China Probrem"" and watching Steven Spielberg and George Lucas constantly raping Indiana Jones.As for the first Blu-ray release of ""SOUTH PARK"", looking at the Blu-ray and DVD specs of bonus features, they both have all three special features and commentary.  The only significant difference is that the Blu-ray is featured in HD.  Also, the Blu-ray does come with a way to obtain a digital copy of ""South Park Season 12' (a code for one to download the episodes).A lot of the episodes from the twelfth season has generated plenty of comments of ""oh, crap...that is so f'd up"".  But it's all about comedy and if one is sensitive to these jokes, then ""South Park"" is definitely not for them.  But for those who have been long time fans, we enjoy the series and enjoy seeing how far Parker and Stone can go. ""SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE TWELFTH SEASON"" goes even farther than previous seasons and pushes the limit of what can be shown on cable television.  And again, each episode is featured in its uncensored glory on Blu-ray and DVD.I've found the series entertaining then and entertaining now.  It's not a series to take seriously, it's a series you just want to sit back, laugh and be surprised of what Parker, Stone and crew have prepared for you.  Prepare for some surprises in this twelfth season and more of the ""oh, crap that's f'd up"" sentiments but in an entertaining, ""South Park"" kind of way.",5,"Season 12 on Blu-ray, the series

There was satire (Canada on strike spoofing the Writer's strike), social commentary (the role of the paparazzi in chasing stories of train wreck celebs, like Britney), but nothing that was laugh inducing. Perhaps the issues were just sad and sometimes stupidity just makes one angry.It's not til disk two that I begin to find myself smiling and occasionally chuckling over scenes/dialogs in ""Super Phun Thyme"" and ""The Breast Cancer Show Ever"".Then disc 3 with Pandemic I & II about Peruvian pan flute bands and their links to giant destructive Guinea Pigs, the aftermath of the Presidential election amd why Obama and McCain really wants to get into the White House manages to come together for some laugh out loud comedy. The last two episodes skewers the fads of ""High School Musical 3"", and ""Twilight"" while at the same time making some pointed observation about society, fitting in, finding an identity, and holding on to one's identity.Cartman and Butters are an incredibly powerful comedy team with the eternally cynical, selfish, and self-centred Cartman matched with the insecure, anxious-to-please, perpetually innocent and naive Butters, and the ""Super Phun Thyme"" episode was particularly funny because of these two characters and the way Butters stood by his principles.Of course anytime Cartman gets his just desserts is an episode worth watching (""The Breast Cancer Shpw Ever"").Pandemic I/II was funny for it's self-commentary as provided by Craig.Season 10 is still my all-time favourite, but season 12 is an improvement over season 11 which may have suffered for following an excellent season in 10.",4,Mix bag that starts slow but pulls up at the end,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,1732,"['easy', 'write', 'satire', 'difficult', 'write', 'funny', 'satire', 'Disc', '1', '5', 'episodes', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'was', 'satire', 'Canada', 'strike', 'spoofing', 'Writer', 'strike', 'social', 'commentary', 'role', 'paparazzi', 'chasing', 'stories', 'train', 'wreck', 'celebs', 'Britney', 'nothing', 'was', 'inducing', 'Perhaps', 'issues', 'were', 'just', 'sad', 'sometimes', 'stupidity', 'just', 'one', 'angry.It', 'not', 'til', 'disk', 'two', 'begin', 'find', 'smiling', 'occasionally', 'chuckling', 'over', 'scenes/dialogs', 'Super', 'Phun', 'Thyme', 'Breast', 'Cancer', 'Show', 'Ever', '.Then', 'disc', '3', 'Pandemic', 'II', 'Peruvian', 'pan', 'flute', 'bands', 'links', 'giant', 'destructive', 'Guinea', 'Pigs', 'aftermath', 'Presidential', 'election', 'amd', 'why', 'Obama', 'McCain', 'really', 'get', 'White', 'House', 'come', 'together', 'laugh', 'loud', 'comedy', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'skewers', 'fads', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', '3', 'Twilight', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'pointed', 'observation', 'society', 'fitting', 'finding', 'identity', 'holding', 'one', 'identity.Cartman', 'Butters', 'are', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'comedy', 'team', 'eternally', 'cynical', 'selfish', 'self-centred', 'Cartman', 'matched', 'insecure', 'anxious-to-please', 'perpetually', 'innocent', 'naive', 'Butters', 'Super', 'Phun', 'Thyme', 'episode', 'was', 'particularly', 'funny', 'two', 'characters', 'way', 'Butters', 'stood', 'principles.Of', 'course', 'anytime', 'Cartman', 'just', 'desserts', 'episode', 'worth', 'watching', 'Breast', 'Cancer', 'Shpw', 'Ever', '.Pandemic', 'I/II', 'was', 'funny', 'self-commentary', 'provided', 'Craig.Season', '10', 'still', 'all-time', 'favourite', 'season', '12', 'improvement', 'season', '11', 'may', 'have', 'suffered', 'following', 'excellent', 'season', '10']",N/A

Tired of being teased by Kyle, Cartman sneaks into his bedroom and gives Kyle a shot with his virus, infecting Kyle. Furious, Kyle attacks Cartman and breaks many of his toys. Cartman suggests they go to L.A. and find out Magic Johnson's secret. They do, suspect Johnson's success is due to sleeping with large piles of money. An injection of $180,000 pulverized dollars cures the problem for them both.The next program has the boys becoming paparazzi after learning a photo of Britney Spears brought $150,000 for the photographer. They talk their way into her hotel room, she becomes despondent over the constant harassment and shoots herself. Seriously wounded and disfigured, the boys try to take her away to isolation in Alaska - that doesn't succeed either after the conductor identifies her.Children getting high from being sprayed by cat urine leads the town to outlaw cats, followed by the DEA rounding most of them up. Cartman has a heart and hides a growing number in his attic. Kyle's dad, a former user, does it once more and is caught in a public square. The law is rescinded and all cats returned.Canada Appreciation Day in South Park is mostly ignored, and Canadians, feeling slighted go on strike. The boys become concerned because their favorite cartoon is made in Canada, thus try to resolve the problem. They earn millions in Internet pretend money for Butters dancing on You Tube, but the Canadians are not impressed. Finally they talk a U.N. group into sending Canada some low-value items to end the strike.Etc.",3,Some Good Plots -,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,1609,"['Cartman', 'tonsillectomy', 'transfusion', 'AIDS', 'result', 'Tired', 'being', 'teased', 'Kyle', 'Cartman', 'bedroom', 'Kyle', 'shot', 'virus', 'infecting', 'Kyle', 'Furious', 'Kyle', 'Cartman', 'breaks', 'many', 'toys', 'Cartman', 'go', 'L.A.', 'find', 'out', 'Magic', 'Johnson', 'secret', 'do', 'suspect', 'Johnson', 'success', 'due', 'sleeping', 'large', 'piles', 'money', 'injection', '180,000', 'pulverized', 'dollars', 'problem', 'both.The', 'next', 'program', 'boys', 'becoming', 'paparazzi', 'learning', 'photo', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'brought', '150,000', 'photographer', 'talk', 'way', 'hotel', 'room', 'despondent', 'constant', 'harassment', 'shoots', 'Seriously', 'wounded', 'disfigured', 'boys', 'try', 'take', 'away', 'isolation', 'Alaska', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'either', 'conductor', 'identifies', 'her.Children', 'getting', 'high', 'being', 'sprayed', 'cat', 'urine', 'town', 'outlaw', 'cats', 'followed', 'DEA', 'rounding', 'most', 'up', 'Cartman', 'heart', 'growing', 'number', 'attic', 'Kyle', 'dad', 'former', 'user', 'once', 'more', 'caught', 'public', 'square', 'law', 'rescinded', 'cats', 'returned.Canada', 'Appreciation', 'Day', 'South', 'Park', 'mostly', 'ignored', 'Canadians', 'feeling', 'slighted', 'go', 'strike', 'boys', 'become', 'concerned', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'made', 'Canada', 'thus', 'try', 'resolve', 'problem', 'earn', 'millions', 'Internet', 'pretend', 'money', 'Butters', 'dancing', 'Tube', 'Canadians', 'are', 'not', 'impressed', 'Finally', 'talk', 'U.N.', 'group', 'sending', 'Canada', 'low-value', 'items', 'end', 'strike.Etc']",N/A

1221395,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B001O0TWXG,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[4, 7]","Season 12 is not one of my favorites.  In fact, I would say it is my least favorite since season 3!  It starts off on a high note, as ""Tonsil Trouble"" is hilarious.  It is definitely the best episode on this set.  There are a few other episodes I'd consider 5-star such as ""Super Fun Time"" and ""Elementary School Musical."" The other episodes I would rate from 4-star (""Breast Cancer Show Ever,"" ""Overlogging"") to maybe as low as 1 star (""Britney's New Look"").  South Park's multiple-parters are usually excellent (""Do the Handicapped Go To Hell?,""  ""Go, God, Go,"" ""Imaginationland"").  The one on this set (""Pandemic"") really didn't do anything for me.  The jewel heist in ""About Last Night..."" seemed unimaginative and boring to me.  The theme of stop messing with classic films in ""The China Probrem"" has been done before, and better.  I'll admit, ""Major Boobage"" was pretty clever but, I think, the overall re-watchablility of this season is not as good as seasons past.  There are not many episodes on this set I crave to watch over & over save for the 3 mentioned above.  With that said, South Park shows it is still relevant and keeps up with the current topics (the bonus ""Six Days of South Park"" gives us a peek at how they do that).Disc 1:""Tonsil Trouble""--In an innocent intro (complete with ""Leave It To Beaver"" style music), a doctor tells Cartman he needs his tonsils removed (how did the Cartmans find a doctor who makes house calls? --Oh, Mrs. Cartman, riiiiight).  During the tonsillectomy, Cartman is infected with HIV.  Cartman soon finds out having HIV isn't as big a deal as it once was.  To teach an insensitive Kyle a lesson, Cartman infects him with HIV, too, and they both go on a quest to find a cure which leads them to Magic Johnson.  I am ""HIV positive"" this episode is hilarious.""Britney's New Look""--All the constant media attention causes Britney Spears to blow off the top part of her head and most of her brain (I guess she was left with enough to keep her alive), but no one seems to notice or care.  Weird one.""Major Boobage""--Thanks to the unintentional advice of Mr. Mackey, the boys find a ""felinal"" (I think I made that word up) way to get high and Kenny becomes hooked.  You get ""Heavy Metal"" music and imagery in this one and the revelation that Cartman actually has a heart.""Canada On Strike""--Feeling unappreciated on a global scale, Canada goes on strike demanding Internet money.  The boys create a viral video (taken directly from Samwell's ""What, What In My Butt"") starring Butters to meet the demands and get a striking Ike out of the cold. I'm not crazy about this episode, but my friends love it, especially all the references to other popular Youtube phenoms.""Eak, A Penis!""  Mr. Garrison finally goes full circle--and what a ride it was.  I would have enjoyed a montage, oh well.  Mrs. Garrison decides that her sex change operation was a big mistake, so she goes to a lab that grows body parts on mice to get a male member, but her mouse escapes.  Meanwhile, Cartman does such a good job teaching Garrison's class in her absence he is asked to work his magic on some inner city kids.  As a Patriot/Bill Belichick hater, I liked how he used Belichick as the model for cheaters.Disc 2:""Overlogging""--South Park is given ""The Grapes of Wrath"" treatment (one of my all-time favorite films), complete with a Henry Fonda character.  When the Internet stops working, the Marshes head for ""Californi.""  That Internet porn simulator is hilarious!""Super Fun Time""--One of my favorite episodes from this season.  When terrorists take over Pioneer Village, they find that the village workers take the ""never break character"" rule to the extreme.  Unlike some of these episodes, this one was very clever and well-written.""The China Probrem""--After seeing the opening ceremonies for the Olympics in Beijing, Cartman thinks the Chinese want to take over America (only he would design those 19th century Chinese costumes).  Also, the boys are traumatized by the recent Indiana Jones movie.  I don't care much for this one.  I'm not a movie buff, so the Stephen Spielberg/George Lucas featured eps are not among my favorites.  This seems like a rehash of the ""Free Hat"" episode.  There are references to rape scenes from ""The Accused"" and ""Deliverance.""""Breast Cancer Show Ever""--Wendy is so furious at Cartman for making fun of her breast cancer awareness presentation she challenges him to a fight, but Cartman keeps conniving to make it look like she's chickening out.  The scene with Wendy and Principal Victoria is actually very touching.""Six Days of South Park""--Bonus feature that shows--with video and commentary--how the episode ""Super Fun Time"" is created from story boards to the finished product in only 6 days!  That's amazing!  It must be very stressful.  Repetitive but interesting to learn how characters and backgrounds from past episodes are recycled and how little details like Cartman and Butters always having to hold hands causes animation headaches.Disc 3:""Pandemic""--There is an epidemic of Peruvian pan flute bands (""pandemic,"" get it?).  The boys convince Craig to invest his birthday money in creating their own band so they can sell CDs.  They end up being arrested with the other bands in a worldwide raid and sent to Peruvia--I mean, Peru.  It turns out that the pan flute bands were serving an important purpose.""Pandemic 2--The Startling""--The purpose of the pan flute bands and the intentions of the director of homeland security are revealed.  A complaining Craig, who wants nothing to do with the boys' adventure, turns out to be the key to it all.  Meanwhile, Randy guides us through the carnage of the guinea monsters in South Park with his video camera.  Note: Gary Numan's ""Cars"" is played on the pan flute at the end.""About Last Night...""--Obama is elected President and, in typical South Park fashion, there are two extremes.  Obama supporters party because they think everything has changed and their lives are instantly better while the McCain supporters are waiting for the end of the world.  Turns out Obama and McCain aren't so different after all--in fact, they begin working together for the same goal.""Elementary School Musical""--The boys have not been keeping up with the High School Musical craze and are clueless as to why their classmates suddenly break into song.  Stan is concerned that Bryden, the school's top singer/dancer, is going to steal Wendy, so he convinces him to take up his true love: basketball.  Bryden's musical obsessed, slap-happy father won't let him pursue his sissy jock aspirations. Excellent topic and well-done.""The Ungroundable""--A group of kids start wearing black and call themselves vampires much to the chagrin of the goth kids.  This new group lures Butters who is tired of being pushed around and not taken seriously at home, or anywhere else for that matter.",3,"""Life goes by pretty fast.  If you don't stop & look around & do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.""--Cartman",1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,6880,"['Season', '12', 'not', 'one', 'favorites', 'fact', 'would',

1221396,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001O0TWXG,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[15, 17]","I've said it before and I'll say it again: after twelve seasons, you'd figure that an animated comedy would have gone stale (I'm looking at you Simpsons, no I'm not afraid to say it).  With South Park though, you'd be wrong.  The twelfth season of Comedy Central's bread & butter series finds Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and the rest of the town's citizens in more insane situations.  ""Britney's New Look"" finds creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker putting their own spin on the train wreck that is Britney Spears, and also has no shame in pointing the finger at who helped make her who she is today, all the while having some insane fun doing it as the boys attempt to help her out.  ""Tonsil Trouble"" gives Cartman a taste of his own medicine, ""Major Boobage"" finds Kenny with a strange drug problem while paying tribute to the animated classic Heavy Metal (right down to the animation style), and ""Eek, a Penis!"" finds Mrs. Garrison wishing to be a man again (and features one of the most hilarious moments you will ever see with a singing mouse and his, ahem, attachment).  Other episodes go so far to feature some undercurrent themes, whether it be the writer's strike (""Canada Goes on Strike""), our dependency on the internet (""Over Logging""), the Olympics and the butchering of Indiana Jones (""The China Problem""), and even the election (""About Last Night""); while some episodes poke fun at hit flicks like Cloverfield (""Pandemic 1 & 2""), High School Musical (""Elementary School Musical""), and Twilight (""The Ungroundable"").  The only weak point of the season for me personally was ""Super Fun Time"", but other than that, the twelfth season of South Park is flawless and hilarious.

1221397,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B001O0TWXG,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[16, 24]","I'm excited that South Park is now available on Blu-Ray and hope other animated shows will soon be doing the same. I was in fourth grade when South Park came out back in 1997, now here we are heading into 2009 and the creator's of the show Matt Stone and Trey Parker are still coming up with stories based in immature humor but paired with intelligent and witty story premises very relevant to today's pop culture. The twelfth season contains the following fourteen classic episodes as well as some special features that previous sets have been lacking.Britney's New Look - Rather than mock the mess Britney Spears was, this episode mocks those of us who put her there and those trying to take her place.Tonsil Trouble - Cartman ends up with aids, and he's hiv positive that he wants to find a cure.Major Boobage- Kenny gets high off cat urine and lives the 'heavy metal' lifestyle.Canada Goes On Strike- I'm canadian and love that they used us to mock the writer's strike of last year.Eek, A Penis!- Mrs. Garrison comes full circle. Or is that Mr. Garrison?Over Logging- Instead of commenting on natural resource over use like oil or forestry Matt and Trey decide to comment on our over dependency on the internet.Super Fun Time- A pioneer village field trip turns into the plotline of several hit eighties movies when terrorists take over the fun park and Cartman and Butters skip out.The China Probrem- Beijing Olympic's get Cartman paranoid of the Chinese while Kyle and Stan deal with the disappointment of Steven Speilberg and George Lucas 'raping' Indiana Jones for profits.The Breast Cancer Show Ever- Cartman becomes a cancer to Wendy, the only way to stop cancer is to fight it.Pandemic- The boys get Craig involved in a scheme that goes wrong, meanwhile Randy goes 'cloverfield' with his new video camera when furry monsters begin attacking.Pandemic 2- The Startling- I'm so startled, and so is Randy as Craig and the boys finish saving the world again with more unrealistic twists than the latest Hollywood blockbuster's.About Last Night- Instead of mocking the presidential candidates like everyone else we see a twist on their stereotypes when election night turns into a heist movie for the O'Bama and McCain tickets. Meanwhile the boys parents get out of control celebrating the 'change'.Elementary School Musical- I hate High School Musical, and luckily for me so do Matt, Trey and the boys. Rather than dance and sing a boy wants to play basketball but his dramatic father won't allow it.The Ungroundable- Butters unwillingly joins the 'Twilight' crowd while the Gothic kids try to stop the 'vamp' craze at it's source, the local Hot Topic store.This season is the first to be released on Blu-ray as well as DVD, though it appears as standard full screen on the DVD, the Blu-Ray is widescreen 1080i, which isn't quite 1080p but is still High Def ( i meaning *interlaced, p progressive), and will have 5.1 *DTS Audio. The new special features provided are probably better suited for die hard fans or those interested in animation but personally if it's between having these and none at all I'd rather the option of watching these. The special features are:Making Boobage: Behind The Scenes Of ""Major Boobage""-Four scenes from the Heavy Metal parody are broken down and shown to us in several stages as producer Eric Stough gives a commentary on how they blended it all together for a final result.Six Days to South Park, A Day By Day: Making of South Park-This is less featurette and more commentary. It finds the production crew giving a rather long commentary over several stages of incomplete animation discussing the changes that are made on each of the six days leading up to the air date. We get to see 'Super Fun Time' slowly transform from the storyboard animatic stage to the near final cut.Behind The Scenes: ""About Last Night""-This is essentially another commentary by the creative crew lead by Eric Stough. They talk over a rough cut of the episode and discuss how most of it was made last minute on the sixth day of production which was the last day before it aired.Matt and Trey will also provide the same mini commentaries they have provided on every season set since the complete third season. I always find these enjoyable and entertaining. They also manage to give alot of information considering each commentary tends to be under five minutes long. The way they discuss issues really gives you an inside look to how their creative minds work and why the humor of the show is what it is.I'm glad to see Paramount and Comedy Central now releasing this show on Blu-Ray as it makes the already vibrant colors that much better, though some may understandably not want to pay more money for high definition alone, it's perfect for those of us who want South Park in all it's glory. These sets have stayed consistent throughout the release of the series (despite typo's on the first sets), they line up nicely on a shelf and always have humorously picked box art that fits the season. They make it easy as possible to store your DVD safely and access them quickly.I'm happy to see the show hold onto the quality it built up to in previous seasons and perfected in season eleven, despite some slower episodes this season is just as smart overall and certainly as funny. This show has held up where other animated series have fallen apart or gone astray. I often worry that this show may follow the same path but after listening to Matt and Trey's awareness of themselves I don't believe they would let that happen, at least not to the same extent.One of my favorite moments of the season was the boys watching high school musical to see what the hype was about and Cartman's reaction:""Well, I'm out guys. If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.""",5,Goin' On Down to South Park...This Time In High Definition,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,5879,"[""'m"", 'excited', 'South', 'Park', 'now', 'available', 'Blu-Ray', 'hope',

The season's weaker episodes include ""Eek, a Penis,"" which tries to derive humor from shock value as the show often does but simply isn't that shocking; ""Britney's New Look"" and ""The China Problem,"" which both have the problem of treading on a joke until it's just not funny anymore; and ""About Last Night,"" which was simply formulaic and boring (relatively speaking for South Park; this same episode would have been a breakthrough of creative genius for The Simpsons or Family Guy).

1221400,A34GG58TJ1A3SH,B001O0TWXG,seamonkey10,"[5, 7]","I really enjoyed season 11, and was anticipating the laughs to come on season 12.  I watched the first few episodes...and nothing.  A few chuckles and that was it.The problem is that the satire isn't what it used to be.  South Park really likes to bring up unpleasant thoughts or double standards of our society and make fun of that, while the characters have their different opinions on the matter.This season is mainly plot-driven, and seems to leave out the jokes.  A lot of episodes are allusions to movies, an it seems a lot of effort went into getting to the conclusion of the plot.  Along the way, the same jokes get repeated, and this technique wears on the viewer like...dare I say...Saturday Night Live.  Examples would include: ""Dude you don't shoot a guy in the _____"",  Randy and his video camaera, the 1864 characters who won't break character.  Wow, it wasn't funny the first time, and now we have to watch 22 minutes of it.  What happened to Stan and the gang making sarcastic remarks about the predictable, cheesy plots and stereotypical characters?  Instead, they've become the cheesy movies that they were trying to make fun of.Maybe Matt and Trey are getting worn out.  Even the characters seem lethargic, like in Pandemic.  Not animated (no pun intended) but worn out and tired.  Sitting on a plane with no laughs.Another thing I've noticed is that the satire has been pushed to the vulgar.  Cussing with no connection to humor and a macabre move toward death and killing.  The Brittney Spears episode was disturbing...and not funny (until they were buying corn in the store and started singing!)The only two bright spots on the disc are ""Elementary School Musical"" and ""Ungroundable"".
