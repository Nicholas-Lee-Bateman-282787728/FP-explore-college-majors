845687,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,B0002V7OHO,The Patriarch,"[4, 59]","Hey everyone, Patriarch here. Now my sister and her husband-in-law went away for some second honeymood kind of thing and you know what that means? Babysitting time for yours truly. As soon as they left the kids started hopping all over the place and they built this makeshift sliding board in the kitchen. The boy slip down and bumped his head and just laid there in this crooked position. I just didn't' know what to do with them and their misbehaving.I got the idea that I needed something to keep their little minds occupied. What I found was this: The Dora the Explorer ultimate adventure collection. First of all, anything with the word ULTIMATE in it automatically catches my eye. The fact that there would be adventures made it all the more better. So as fast as I could, before another one of them could be injured I popped it in.The good news is that those kids' faces were glue to the screen almost immediately. The bad news was I still had to sit there with them and watch it. Now the plot lines of these cartoons were very weak. There was very little character development and most of them had to do with finding her backpack or the monkey finding his boots. I also noticed that the monkey talks and sings, so this show is like more evolution propaganda hocus pocus.Also, this was a Spanish show which I hadn't realized. It's about this Spanish girl names Dora, and...I guess the monkey is Spanish too. The only problem with that is, like that Coqueta movie I reviewed, there are no English subtitles. Luckily there are some English words used to so I could at least tell what was going on. Not that it mattered, because as I said the plots were horrible anyway.Now I could give this show five stars because it did keep the kids busy. But I just don't think it would be fair to potential viewers who could possibly purchase it based on my rating and be disappointed. So I had to do a fair and balanced review. No plot, no character development, no English subtitles, and...oh yeah the jokes were not funny. I didn't get into that yet. The jokes all fell really flat. The only reason I knew they were jokes was because the kids would laugh at them. Maybe the kids just knew Spanish better than I. I don't know.So, long story short, the kids well to sleep after this was over adn the first night of this babysitting has gone well. Their parent's will be back in a couple days so I might show them some spongebob in the meantime. I'll let you know how that goes.
