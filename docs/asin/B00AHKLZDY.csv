If you think Tara talks too much, you wouldn't believe how annoying would be to try to do yoga while listening to Tia Mowry's laughter. She makes fun of everything, and it's more like a friendly practice between friends than a workout DVD. The &#34;Core Yoga&#34; DVD is almost unbearable because of Tia, who looks more controlled in the &#34;Calm&#34; DVD (thank God!). Great to learn the flows and practice them by yourself...",3,"Great workout, BUT...",1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,497,"['really', 'Tara', 'Stiles', 'videos', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'one', 'think', 'Tara', 'talks', 'too', 'much', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'annoying', 'would', 'be', 'try', 'do', 'yoga', 'listening', 'Tia', 'Mowry', 'laughter', 'fun', 'everything', 'more', 'friendly', 'practice', 'friends', 'workout', 'DVD', '34', 'Core', 'Yoga', '34', 'DVD', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'Tia', 'who', 'more', 'controlled', '34', 'Calm', '34', 'DVD', 'thank', 'God', 'Great', 'learn', 'flows', 'practice']",Tia Mowry’s Complete Calm & Core Yoga Series with Tara Stiles

1610565,A1FDVT0DLJWV78,B00AHKLZDY,D. A. J.,"[1, 2]","I wanted a good, but calming workout. Like everyone I vowed to ""get back into shape"", but wasn't ready for the boot camp type DVD's. The Core Yoga video is really amazing. I was surprised at how much I could do as a beginner, but there are still lots of things to get better and work up to (like the crow pose). I love that in this 45 minute video, you are pretty much moving the entire time. There isn't time spent teaching you to do the pose, just talking your through it and trusting your body to find its way. Many beginner videos focus so much on teaching you never really get to break a sweat. This video allows yoga to be the exercise it was meant to be - challenging in a gentle sort of way.The conversation or chatter isn't too much. Think I will be able to stick with this for some time and maybe work up to more complex videos by Tara Stiles. I think Tia Mowry is good at showing the modifications for poses for beginners and would love to see this pair team up to do an intermediate series next.",5,Really good workout for beginners,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,1007,"['wanted', 'good', 'calming', 'workout', 'everyone', 'vowed', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'boot', 'camp', 'type', 'DVD', 'Core', 'Yoga', 'video', 'really', 'amazing', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'do', 'beginner', 'are', 'still', 'lots', 'things', 'get', 'better', 'work', 'up', 'crow', 'pose', 'love', '45', 'minute', 'video', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'moving', 'entire', 'time', ""n't"", 'time', 'spent', 'teaching', 'do', 'pose', 'just', 'talking', 'trusting', 'body', 'find', 'way', 'Many', 'beginner', 'videos', 'focus', 'so', 'much', 'teaching', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'break', 'sweat', 'video', 'yoga', 'be', 'exercise', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'challenging', 'gentle', 'sort', 'way.The', 'conversation', 'chatter', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'Think', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'stick', 'time', 'maybe', 'work', 'up', 'more', 'complex', 'videos', 'Tara', 'Stiles', 'think', 'Tia', 'Mowry', 'good', 'showing', 'modifications', 'poses', 'beginners', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'pair', 'do', 'intermediate', 'series']",Tia Mowry’s Complete Calm & Core Yoga Series with Tara Stiles

After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this DVD. I did the routine a couple of times and decided this was to advance for me, to say this is for beginners is a joke. I decided to do some more research and found Jane Fonda had a beginners yoga DVD out, I looked at the reviews and decided this might be the one for me. I do like the Tia's dvd and will go back to it once I become better and stronger at the routines.",3,Not for real beginners!,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,505,"['wanted', 'bring', 'yoga', 'workout', 'saw', 'Tia', 'Tamara', 'show', 'reading', 'reviews', 'decided', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'did', 'routine', 'couple', 'times', 'decided', 'was', 'advance', 'say', 'beginners', 'joke', 'decided', 'do', 'more', 'research', 'found', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'had', 'beginners', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'looked', 'reviews', 'decided', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'do', 'Tia', 'dvd', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'once', 'become', 'better', 'stronger', 'routines']",Tia Mowry’s Complete Calm & Core Yoga Series with Tara Stiles

I never imagined that I would enjoy Yoga so much! Tia and Tara's easy-going style has made me a Yoga fiend, and I cannot go a day without having some sort of Yoga involved. I wish I could thank them both in person for making this set, as if they had not, I would never have tried Yoga again, and made my health so much better!",5,Changed my life!,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,507,"['had', 'originally', 'ordered', 'DVDs', 'simply', 'support', 'Tia', 'great', 'choice', 'do', 'Yoga', 'series', 'having', 'used', 'several', 'months', 'now', 'have', 'admit', 'am', 'love', 'never', 'imagined', 'would', 'enjoy', 'Yoga', 'so', 'much', 'Tia', 'Tara', 'easy-going', 'style', 'made', 'Yoga', 'fiend', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'day', 'having', 'sort', 'Yoga', 'involved', 'wish', 'could', 'thank', 'person', 'making', 'set', 'had', 'not', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'tried', 'Yoga', 'again', 'made', 'health', 'so', 'much', 'better']",Tia Mowry’s Complete Calm & Core Yoga Series with Tara Stiles
