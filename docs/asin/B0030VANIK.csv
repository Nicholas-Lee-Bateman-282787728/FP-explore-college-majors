It's not a perfect DVD but I can watch the show and that is all that i wanted. I don't need fancy extras or blu ray to make me happy with this!,5,Good show!,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,238,"['watched', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'loved', 'was', 'happy', 'finally', 'get', 'DVD', 'not', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'show', 'i', 'wanted', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'fancy', 'extras', 'blu', 'ray', 'make', 'happy']",The Commish: Season 1

Michael Chiklis is great as Scalli. A little strange with the east coast accent. If not for him it would have been unwatchable for me. Kinda cheesy compared to today's dramas, without much violence, language, or T and A. Older folks wanting to reminisce won't be dissapointed. For younger people who want lots of action and realism, this probably isn't your cup of tea.",3,Far from The Shield,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,498,"['other', 'reviews', 'say', ""n't"", 'Shield', ""'re"", 'right', 'show', 'OLD', 'Filmed', '91', 'eighties', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'great', 'Scalli', 'little', 'strange', 'east', 'coast', 'accent', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unwatchable', 'Kinda', 'cheesy', 'compared', 'today', 'dramas', 'much', 'violence', 'language', 'T', 'A', 'Older', 'folks', 'wanting', 'reminisce', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed', 'younger', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'lots', 'action', 'realism', 'probably', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea']",The Commish: Season 1

1315672,A11ATJK36KXJS6,B0030VANIK,M. Miller,"[13, 14]","Well, first of all it would have been nice to see season 3 released instead of a rehash of already commercially available season 1 & 2 but I digress.The GOOD news:1. This set is far cheaper if price was your reason for skipping the first go round release of season 1 and 2 a few years ago.2. Target is selling season 1 & 2 for $14.99 in a limited edition 2 for pack available now. Just got mine today.So my advice would be to skip Amazon's offering  on this item (I canceled my pre-order)and save money in the long run by getting the 2 for deal.Now for the BAD news:This is the no frills edition. (What can you really expect for $11?)1. The 4 discs contained come in paper sleeves!I've seen some cost cutting schemes in my time when manufacturers skimp on dvd releases but this takes the cake. I've seen bootleg dvds that are packaged more professionally than this.2. The episodes are the butchered ones from the prior releases. You would have thought that if they were going to redo these 2 seasons over, they would have  atleast issued them uncut this time.So only buy this if:A. You didn't buy the original release a few years ago because of costB. You want your set to match seasons 3 & 4 if they ever come outC. Your old sets are all scratched and beat up in the 4/5 years you've been waiting for season 3 to be released.",3,There's GOOD news and there's BAD news,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,1326,"['Well', 'first', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'season', '3', 'released', 'instead', 'rehash', 'already', 'commercially', 'available', 'season', '1', '2', 'digress.The', 'GOOD', 'news:1', 'set', 'far', 'cheaper', 'price', 'was', 'reason', 'skipping', 'first', 'go', 'round', 'release', 'season', '1', '2', 'few', 'years', 'ago.2', 'Target', 'selling', 'season', '1', '2', '14.99', 'limited', 'edition', '2', 'pack', 'available', 'now', 'Just', 'got', 'mine', 'today.So', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'skip', 'Amazon', 'offering', 'item', 'canceled', 'pre-order', 'save', 'money', 'long', 'run', 'getting', '2', 'deal.Now', 'BAD', 'news', 'frills', 'edition', 'What', 'can', 'really', 'expect', '11', '1', '4', 'discs', 'contained', 'come', 'paper', 'sleeves', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'cost', 'cutting', 'schemes', 'time', 'when', 'manufacturers', 'skimp', 'dvd', 'releases', 'cake', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bootleg', 'dvds', 'are', 'packaged', 'more', 'professionally', 'this.2', 'episodes', 'are', 'butchered', 'ones', 'prior', 'releases', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'redo', '2', 'seasons', 'would', 'have', 'atleast', 'issued', 'uncut', 'time.So', 'only', 'buy', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'original', 'release', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'costB', 'want', 'set', 'match', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'ever', 'come', 'outC', 'old', 'sets', 'are', 'scratched', 'beat', 'up', '4/5', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'season', '3', 'be', 'released']",The Commish: Season 1

We get a new release of The Commish by an entirely different company while Amazon decides to move the reviews of the Anchor Bay release, a release some reviewers have noted has cut versions of several episodes, here to the file for the new release. It would be nice if the idiot savants at Amazon.com didn't do this. Why?  Because the new release might, since it is licensed from Cannell, have the uncut versions of the episodes and it would be nice to know if this is the case. It is nice to know that Amazon.com doesn't care about this. So Amazon I am giving you a big O stars for your fourth rate practises here. Bravo and Brava.
