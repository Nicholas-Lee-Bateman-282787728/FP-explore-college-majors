I had taped this when it was originally broadcast on the Disney channel, but made the mistake of loaning it to my niece when she was studying the book in school.  She's a great kid, but I never saw the tapes again.Hopefully one day Disney will issue this on dvd without screwing it up.  I should think even if there was no other reason to see it there would be some interest in seeing the pre-Hannibal Lechter Anthony Hopkins threatening to eat someones liver.",5,the best version,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,605,"['far', 'best', 'overall', 'version', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'when', 'say', 'mean', 'take', 'nothing', 'away', 'great', 'David', 'Lean', 'film', 'had', 'taped', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'Disney', 'channel', 'made', 'mistake', 'loaning', 'niece', 'when', 'was', 'studying', 'book', 'school', 'great', 'kid', 'never', 'saw', 'tapes', 'again.Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'Disney', 'will', 'issue', 'dvd', 'screwing', 'should', 'think', 'even', 'was', 'other', 'reason', 'see', 'would', 'be', 'interest', 'seeing', 'pre-Hannibal', 'Lechter', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'threatening', 'eat', 'someones', 'liver']",Great Expectations VHS

I wish they would release this on DVD.

266011,A347MRCA48RV4J,6301788486,wiser consumer,"[0, 1]","I began Disney's version of Dickens' tale with reservations -- even if it fleshed out the story, could it surpass Lean's version?At first I didn't think so. Pip's clothing, for instance, looks coarser in Lean's, and the fact he wore them to bed is probably accurate for the time and their economic condition. Then the spareness of the Gargery household is probably accurate for a blacksmith's income.But on the other hand, John Mills was too old to play the adult, Pip. And the actress who played the adult Estella wasn't very satisfactory. Then there's the complete departure of the ending from that of the book.I could go on but I'll end by saying I've been won by Disney's version because it contains so much more of Dickens' story. In fact, I wonder if it's possible to do justice to a Dickens' book in the usual 1 1/2 - 2 hour movie. I just wish someone would clean up the tape a bit and digitize it.But, of course, one can have both and enjoy them both for different reasons. (One can only dream that Lean had had the money to do the entire story his way.)Addendum: I've just bought this German DVD of Disney's version and the quality is excellent. But, I also had to locate instructions online for converting my DVD player to an all-region player. (It's legal for the owner to do this and it doesn't void the player's warranty; a computer repair shop probably can do it for a nominal sum).Thank heaven a German company had the wisdom to see the value of digitizing this film. Where Disney apparently found sufficient funds to support this English-made production, they didn't see sufficient sales to justify converting it to DVD. For us lovers of this Dickens' story, I'm very thankful a German company did.",5,Great expectations met,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1714,"['began', 'Disney', 'version', 'Dickens', 'tale', 'reservations', 'even', 'fleshed', 'out', 'story', 'could', 'surpass', 'Lean', 'version', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Pip', 'clothing', 'instance', 'coarser', 'Lean', 'fact', 'wore', 'bed', 'probably', 'accurate', 'time', 'economic', 'condition', 'Then', 'spareness', 'Gargery', 'household', 'probably', 'accurate', 'blacksmith', 'income.But', 'other', 'hand', 'John', 'Mills', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'adult', 'Pip', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'adult', 'Estella', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'satisfactory', 'Then', 'complete', 'departure', 'ending', 'book.I', 'could', 'go', ""'ll"", 'end', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'been', 'won', 'Disney', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Dickens', 'story', 'fact', 'wonder', 'possible', 'do', 'justice', 'Dickens', 'book', 'usual', '1', '1/2', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'just', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'clean', 'up', 'tape', 'bit', 'digitize', 'it.But', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'have', 'enjoy', 'different', 'reasons', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'Lean', 'had', 'had', 'money', 'do', 'entire', 'story', 'way', ""'ve"", 'just', 'bought', 'German', 'DVD', 'Disney', 'version', 'quality', 'excellent', 'also', 'had', 'locate', 'instructions', 'online', 'converting', 'DVD', 'player', 'all-region', 'player', 'legal', 'owner', 'do', ""n't"", 'void', 'player', 'warranty', 'computer', 'repair', 'shop', 'probably', 'can', 'do', 'nominal', 'sum', '.Thank', 'heaven', 'German', 'company', 'had', 'wisdom', 'see', 'value', 'digitizing', 'film', 'Where', 'Disney', 'apparently', 'found', 'sufficient', 'funds', 'support', 'English-made', 'production', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'sufficient', 'sales', 'justify', 'converting', 'DVD', 'lovers', 'Dickens', 'story', ""'m"", 'very', 'thankful', 'German', 'company', 'did']",Great Expectations VHS
