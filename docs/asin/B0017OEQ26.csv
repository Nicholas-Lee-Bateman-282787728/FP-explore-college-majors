My wife didn't like it, but I am so-so about it. We are Ghost Adventures fans so we compare it to that. I was not sure if this was fiction or an investigation.We didn't see any techniques that we would add to our investigations. We were confused on the point that the woman is a family member of the house owners but claimed she received information psychically that she could have simply witnessed growing up. I thought it was funny they argued about the alleged ghost shot since it all came down to personal perception, which is kinda the whole theme of the show.I like that I only spent a couple dollars to get a view of what ghost investigators are doing in other locations without having to sit in on it physically.",3,Amateur ghost documentary or fiction?,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,849,"['love', 'buying', 'amateur', 'stuff', 'was', 'OK', 'overall', 'did', 'price', 'point', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'purchase', 'price', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'am', 'so-so', 'are', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'fans', 'compare', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'fiction', 'investigation.We', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'techniques', 'would', 'add', 'investigations', 'were', 'confused', 'point', 'woman', 'family', 'member', 'house', 'owners', 'claimed', 'received', 'information', 'psychically', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'witnessed', 'growing', 'up', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'argued', 'alleged', 'ghost', 'shot', 'came', 'down', 'personal', 'perception', 'whole', 'theme', 'show.I', 'only', 'spent', 'couple', 'dollars', 'get', 'view', 'what', 'ghost', 'investigators', 'are', 'doing', 'other', 'locations', 'having', 'sit', 'physically']",DEAD HOUSE

It is video footage from PSI investigators from one of their investigations in a supposed haunted house previously owned by ""Grandma and Grandpa"", who just happened to be devil worshippers.  There is only one EVP and not much technical investigating going on here.  The members of the team consist mainly of clairvoyants, sensitives, and mediums and that is what they are basing their investigation on.  There is a bonus episode at the end which takes place at what I am assuming is a mental hospital, and the investigation is based solely on what everyone is 'feeling'.  The investigators claim to have nurses and patients possessing them and walkie talkie malfunctions are taken for disembodied screams of long gone mental patients.  I found it mildly interesting, but there was a bit too much drama going on between the clairvoyants for my taste.  Not sure it's worth the $20.00 either, but if you are tired of reruns of Ghost Hunters, you might find this worth a look.",2,Yet another paranormal group...,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,1093,"['are', 'seasoned', 'investigators', 'not', 'movie', 'not', 'professionally', 'done', 'documentary', 'video', 'footage', 'PSI', 'investigators', 'one', 'investigations', 'supposed', 'haunted', 'house', 'previously', 'owned', 'Grandma', 'Grandpa', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'devil', 'worshippers', 'only', 'one', 'EVP', 'not', 'much', 'technical', 'investigating', 'going', 'here', 'members', 'team', 'consist', 'mainly', 'clairvoyants', 'sensitives', 'mediums', 'what', 'are', 'basing', 'investigation', 'bonus', 'episode', 'end', 'place', 'what', 'am', 'assuming', 'mental', 'hospital', 'investigation', 'based', 'solely', 'what', 'everyone', ""'feeling"", 'investigators', 'claim', 'have', 'nurses', 'patients', 'possessing', 'walkie', 'talkie', 'malfunctions', 'are', 'taken', 'disembodied', 'screams', 'long', 'gone', 'mental', 'patients', 'found', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'there', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'drama', 'going', 'clairvoyants', 'taste', 'Not', 'sure', '20.00', 'are', 'tired', 'reruns', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'might', 'find', 'worth', 'look']",DEAD HOUSE
