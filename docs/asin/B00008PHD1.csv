Erland,"[1, 1]","After watching the absorbing, subtly moving film `Maya Lin - A Strong Clear Vision' it was easy to see why it won the Academy Award in the category of `Best Documentary Feature' in 1995. Its intent is clearly to convey so much more than just providing the viewing audience with an intimate look at the talented and introspective young Asian college student who designed the controversial Vietnam War Memorial.As Maya's work and theories of design, architecture, and sculpture are presented to the audience we slowly begin to realize how much her inner world serves as a microcosm and barometer for the turbulent, emotional atmosphere of Post-Vietnam trauma and the ensuing social upheaval which was in the process of drastically altering the collective consciousness of our 20th century landscape. As Maya's personal, artistic journey is examined within the framework of that specific time and place in American culture a broader, holistic understanding comes into focus. Her art and its gifts of remembrance, acceptance and healing becomes our reward for embracing her journey as our own.

Clendenin,"[4, 4]","When Maya Lin was just a twenty-one year old architecture student at Yale, the committee for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial chose her proposal (a class assignment, it turns out) from a national competition of 1,441 submissions as the winning design. Then the battle began. Congress people and even Vietnam veterans opposed it, the latter caricaturing it as a ""big, black scar in the earth."" Others compared it to a boomerang. Lin was vilified as a communist. And a memorial designed by an Asian, woman, college student? In the end, after congressional hearings at which the young Lin testified, her design was built and then dedicated in 1982. I have taken my family to the memorial when we visited Washington and, along with virtually everyone who has visited, can attest to the incredibly evocative power of this public monument. The first half of this documentary covers the VVM; the last half reviews her other prominent works, namely, the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, the Museum of African Art, the Wexner Center at Ohio State University, a fountain commemorating the contributions of women at Yale, an open air Peace Chapel, and her work with the Presidio project in San Francisco. I am always inspired and encouraged to follow the story of a person whose sense of vocation is so strong and crystal clear.

746504,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00008PHD1,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 2]","Part of the turbulent 1960s, the war in Vietnam was a brutal experience for not only the soliders who fought it, but for American society as a whole. In the late 1970s a group of Vietnam veterans began seeking to have a monument erected on the Washington Mall. The project was approved and a blue-ribbon panel was chosen to select the winning design from anonymous submissions. When the panel made a final choice, everyone was disconcerted--some even shocked--to find that it had been created by Maya Lin, a twenty year old art student at Yale.MAYA LIN: A STRONG CLEAR VISION describes how and why that student came to the idea of a black, reflective wall as a monument. The documentary, which won an Academy Award, also takes pains to note that Lin, her design, and even members of the jury that selected it came under tremendous attack from members of congress and many veterans groups. The design was described as ugly, a gash in the earth, a huge boomerang; Lin, a Chinese-American, was frequently the victim of racial slurs. At least one member of the selection jury was attacked as a communist and others were attacked as Vietnam protesters by both conservative congressmen and right-wing columnist Pat Bucchanan. At one point the project was blocked until a congressional panel was able to placate the monument's detractors by inclusion of an American flag and a more traditional sculpture--elements that Lin, although a very young and somewhat inexperienced woman, successfully fought to keep separate from her original design. It is worth pointing out that, although the flag and the sculpture (and another sculpture since added) have been praised, they pale in comparison to Lin's creation, which silenced all critics from the moment it was dedicated in 1982.Although Lin is most clearly remembered as the creator of the Vietnam memorial in Washington D.C., the documentary explores a number of her other works, including a major monument to the struggle for Civil Rights, placed in Montgomery, Alabama; Open-Air Peace Chapel at Juniata College; and the Women's Table fountain at Yale University. Throughout the documentary, Lin remains a somewhat mysterious figure, and we learn only a few essentials about her as a person: her father was an artist, her mother an English teacher, and her background a creative one that emphasized rightness and importance over financial success. But scenes showing her at work are very telling. She is clearly a highly focused woman immersed in her work. The early works noted in the film were highly successful; her later works were sometimes less so (the notorious ""punch card park"" at Ohio University a case in point.) Even so, she has remained a major artist for three decades, her great gift being an eye for large-scale installations and monuments.The DVD offers good visual and sound elements; it has little in the way of bonus material. But the documentary does not really require support: like Maya Lin, like her own work, it is what it is--and it is graceful, powerful, and moving.

On a basic level, the film discusses several projects of artist/architect Maya Lin, a young Chinese-American woman who unexpectedly won the design competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial while a Yale student.  Her design, a departure from conventional expectations, is now famous, and is the most visited memorial in Washington D.C.  Some of the strong feelings that the Vietnam War elicits in people, especially its veterans, is touched upon in moving live scenes at the Memorial and in the controversial hearings that were held in the wake of the design's selection.  The experience put Maya Lin in a national spotlight and forced the student to mature very quickly addressing the grievances of veterans and others.  In the end, with some minor site additions, the Memorial stood as designed, with the names of all the soldiers who gave their lives in Vietnam etched in its simple, polished, reflective granite.  Other works of Maya Lin, including the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama; the Yale Women's Table; and others demonstrate a similar simplicity and poetry that is both moving and powerful.

I didn't know, for example, that there was some adamant opposition to it. I did know that some Vietnam vets felt it lacked the symbolism on which they insisted. For that reason, the statue of the three troops was added after ""The Wall"" was completed.The film also shows some of Ms. Linn's other designs, e.g., the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama and the peace chapel at a college in Pennsylvania.I appreciated the film because of the references to these other memorials, and also because Ms. Linn was able to describe her artistic reasoning behind all of them. The Vietnam wall, for example, is to allow the living to meet with the dead; the water that covers many of her memorials is to serve a symbolic purpose.In short, I rather like all her designs. At the same time, if she hadn't been chosen for the Vietnam War Memorial, I don't know that such a film would have been made.That's not to discredit her work, which, again, is great.
