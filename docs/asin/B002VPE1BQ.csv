1295599,A1OZEX6BNJEDBM,B002VPE1BQ,"A. Barry ""THE reviewer""","[18, 23]","This movie is an amalgamation of poor decisions and poor understanding. Remember being young and having to constantly correct your parents whenever they attempted to discuss the cartoons and video games you liked? That's this movie. It's as if Shyamalan walked in on his son watching Avatar, watched one episode with him, and decided to make a movie adaptation as a surprise birthday present.Where to begin? First of all, the deliberate decision to pronounce many of the characters' names differently from the cartoon reeks of ignorance. What does this accomplish? It serves only to instantly throw off and alienate the real fans of the show, and in no way enhances the movie for people not in the know.Second, pacing. This movie ludicrously attempts to condense an entire season consisting of roughly 7 and a half hours of content into 90 minutes. A feat so daunting Shyamalan probably knew it was impossible, but did it anyway! I had watched the 1st season of the show directly before watching this movie and was amazed at how fast the it tries to plow through the storyline of the show. The film is so rushed it offers no time to introduce its characters. Characters that once formed an ensemble are now given the back burner in favor of the main character.Finally, the magic of the show is just simply lost in the transition to live action. I don't know if the fighting in the cartoon can be pulled off in this medium, but the movie seems to want me to believe that it can't. The iconic regalia of the fire nation in the cartoon just comes off as drab in the film. Just like Dragonball Evolution, the film not only brings absolutely nothing new to the table of the source material, but taints it for merely existing.",1,The last straw.,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,1720,"['movie', 'amalgamation', 'poor', 'decisions', 'poor', 'understanding', 'Remember', 'being', 'young', 'having', 'constantly', 'correct', 'parents', 'whenever', 'attempted', 'discuss', 'cartoons', 'video', 'games', 'liked', 'movie', 'Shyamalan', 'walked', 'son', 'watching', 'Avatar', 'watched', 'one', 'episode', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'present.Where', 'begin', 'First', 'all', 'deliberate', 'decision', 'pronounce', 'many', 'characters', 'names', 'differently', 'cartoon', 'reeks', 'ignorance', 'What', 'accomplish', 'only', 'instantly', 'throw', 'off', 'alienate', 'real', 'fans', 'show', 'way', 'movie', 'people', 'not', 'know.Second', 'pacing', 'movie', 'ludicrously', 'condense', 'entire', 'season', 'consisting', 'roughly', '7', 'half', 'hours', 'content', '90', 'minutes', 'feat', 'so', 'daunting', 'Shyamalan', 'probably', 'knew', 'was', 'impossible', 'did', 'anyway', 'had', 'watched', '1st', 'season', 'show', 'directly', 'before', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'fast', 'plow', 'storyline', 'show', 'film', 'so', 'rushed', 'time', 'introduce', 'characters', 'Characters', 'once', 'formed', 'ensemble', 'are', 'now', 'given', 'back', 'burner', 'favor', 'main', 'character.Finally', 'magic', 'show', 'just', 'simply', 'lost', 'transition', 'live', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fighting', 'cartoon', 'can', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'medium', 'movie', 'want', 'believe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'iconic', 'regalia', 'fire', 'nation', 'cartoon', 'just', 'off', 'drab', 'film', 'Just', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'source', 'material', 'taints', 'merely', 'existing']",The Last Airbender

There are quite a few reviews so far on the movie telling its plot etc so I won't go into that too much.Plot. 9/10-I rather liked the plot line. A friend whose an avid watcher of the series said they tried to squeeze everything from season one into a 2 hour movie. They did but I thought it was done well.Characters: 9/10-I HATED Aang in the series, heck I HATED Sokka and Katara too. Whiny children is what they were. Granted they were young, but Aang was raised by monks for his whole life up till he ran away, and he would NOT be as childish as he was in the show. I LOVED that he was much more serene with bits of childish thrown in. His actor gets top marks from me. Sokka and Katara were both brilliant I thought. I was shocked to find out that Sokka's actor also played Jasper in Twilight. The Fire Nation was kind of meh to me. I was hoping to like Zuko as I did in the show but I didn't really feel for him here. His Uncle was the same as always and I loved him in the show and in the movie.Sound/Special effects: 10/10. I just loved how they did everything with this movie. My one complaint would be I didn't get a clear look at the dragons. Would have loved to see the whole dragon not just his face or a shadow moving by. LOLOverall: 28/30Overall I liked what they did with the movie. I thought it was better then the show in many respects. The characters were less childish and whinny, which made me happy, and were played very well as far as I was concerned.

1295605,A3MD0VOZTT2OAU,B002VPE1BQ,allij28,"[3, 9]","My little sister and I went to see The Last Airbender when it came out in theaters this summer. We're both huge fans of the animated series.  When I heard that this movie was coming out, I was a little worried, but I decided to have an open mind and ended up being really excited about it.Unfortunately, my original instincts were correct. This is a terrible movie. What's really awful about it is the complete lack of regard Shyamalan obviously has for Avatar: The Last Airbender.  He said in an interview that fans of the animated series would notice that the movie's spirit was identical to the spirit of the show. Ha! He obviously didn't watch the show very closely, if that's what he thinks.For me the biggest problems in the movie are with the characters and the lack of humor.  Why is Aang so serious all the time? What got me hooked on the show was how even though he has a this huge, imposing destiny, Aang is still a kid.  He plays pranks, he jokes around, and he takes detours on their journey to ride giant fish.  The movie also totally skips over Aang's crush on Katara.  Katara acts as the mature voice of reason in the movie the few times we see her doing anything, but there's no sibling banter with Sokka whatsoever. She also isn't shown improving her waterbending. In Book 1 of the series, Katara goes from a beginning waterbender to a master by the end of the season. Movie-Sokka is much to serious. He provided so much comic relief in the show, and I have a hard time seeing what his purpose is in this movie.  And the worst part about the characters is that they have no relationship with each other.  You never get to see a friendship building between Aang, Katara, and Sokka. They just seem to be three kids randomly traveling together.  Sokka and Katara say a couple of times that ""Aang is their responsibility,"" not that they care about him at all.  The interaction between the three main characters and the growth of their relationship is a great and integral part of the series. In the movie I don't even think they like each other.As for humor, this is a kid's movie! Even though the story is epic, there should be light hearted moments. Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia have both managed that, even more grown up movies like Lord of the Rings are still funny, but Airbender just didn't have it.  The only time my sister and I laughed during this movie was at the ridiculous water tribe battle cry. ""Oooooooo!"" And I'm pretty sure that wasn't meant to be humorous. (And by the way, my sister is 10 and usually loves any movie that she sees, and she pretty much hates this movie. So apparently Shyamalan made this movie to stupid for even sweet, open-minded kids, his target audience)As for the changing of the names, I was willing to let that slide if the movie was good, but since it wasn't hearing Ohng and Sohkka really annoyed me.  It takes a lot of nerve to tell someone that they are pronouncing names that they created incorrectly. None of these names (Aang, Katara, Sokka, Iroh) are actual names, but Shyamalan felt the need to insult Avatar's creators by saying that he needed to fix their made up world.Skip this movie.

1295606,AVAHA06K08ZKK,B002VPE1BQ,Alwyn Lau,"[12, 23]","M.Night Shyamalan used to give us kick-ass mind-benders (like Sixth Sense and Un-Breakable), the kind of movie which makes viewers gasp towards the end because a final revelation forces them to rethink the entire movie retroactively. Bruce Willis' character's sudden realisation that he was dead was a milestone in cinema history, a plot-device that ended being copied in other big movies (the one which jumps out strongest is Nicole Kidman's The Others). This was followed by less shocking though still appreciated twist-and-turn movies like Un-Breakable (another Willis hit), Signs and even The Village, though here there were already signs (pun yes) that Shyamalan's craft was going to require a heavy injection of something new (the Eureka index was definitely falling), failing which he'd just be the guy who made movies where the camera has a tendency of lingering and the characters spend eons talking to each other (another such director is Clint Eastwood).So what happened? Was the lure of CGI box-office collections too strong, so strong that story-telling-and-making is thrown to the, err, air? Because other than the fancy shots of the elements being manipulated and used as weapons, I'm not sure what else is new/good/worthwhile about the Last Air-Bender.The acting is second- (even third-)rate; other than Prince Zuko's uncle, the rest look like they're auditioning for the high-school end of year play. The plot is predictable and is so loop-holed you'd think someone threw some fireballs at it. The 'spirituality'? Don't even get me started.(In one scene, the Avatar - supposedly the incarnation of the source of harmony in the world, the One who can 'bend' all the four elements - asks, ""Do you have a spiritual place where I can meditate?"" - and I wanted to go, ""Down the hall, turn left, first door on the right. Please flush when you're done."")And, most disappointly of all, I repeat: There is no mind-twirling twist here. There is no unanticipated near-the-end scene which brings surprise and coherency to the whole movie. The Last Air-Bender, in a word, is nothing more than a PG-13 CGI-soaked version of something Jean-Claude Van Damme did when he was two decades younger. Something which draws the crowd but it utterly forgettable; one can hardly imagine having anything resembling an 'intelligent conversation' about the movie (or at least the kind inspired by gems like Sixth Sense). To risk a judgment harsh yet unfortunately true: With this movie, Shyamalan has lost his defining charateristic. Why, pray tell, bother getting him to direct it?We need a return to great story-telling with profound themes. This year only Inception has come close, IMO. The Air-Bender? If I could hurl flames at the screen at the end of the show I might've tried.

1295607,A2GB2VETVMKST5,B002VPE1BQ,Amanda L. Conley,"[0, 5]","Before I bash this movie with a metal-encrusted Toph (and I will) there are some things that really ought to be pointed out, by an adult fan of the actual TV show.Number 1.THE CREATORS OF THE SHOW ARE AMONG THE PRODUCERS OF THE LAST AIRBENDER. You can see it on the case, you can see it in the credits. They were very much involved in the decision to let 'Shame-a-lan' handle the writing for this movie. Yes, it was a mistake. But they were there. M. Night did not slip this under the original creators somehow.Number 2.THIS HAS 3D APPA AND 3D MOMO IN IT!! And they are wonderful. Seeing those two things alone made it worth my twenty dollars. I loved them!Number 3.THE EFFECTS WERE NOT 'BAD'. They were simply inappropriately used for what they should have been trying to accomplish. But again, the creators were there. They could have stopped this, and they did not.Number 4.THIS IS JUST A MOVIE. Yes, I know that is very disappointing! I love the show, and I know that it is more than just a show, and we all would have hoped this would be more than just a movie, which it is not. But let's face it guys, it's just mediocre. It didn't make you cry blood, it didn't make worlds end.--------That all being said... BASH THIS MOVIE WITH METAL-ENCASED TOPH.Did the filmmakers EVER watch the show? Who the hell are Ung, Soak-uh, and ee-row. It was AAng SOKKa and I-roh.Avatar: The Last Airbender was not really an action show. It was more of a fantasy-drama hybrid. It was enchanting and heartwarming... and in terms of that, this movie is just stupid. Sokka is only passively funny, he will not make you laugh out loud like he does in the show. Aang (Or 'Ung' as some apparently prefer) has no energy whatsoever and doesn't even ride around on his little bubble things. Zuko's scar looks like stretch marks -- it is far from the 'who's bad?' disfiguring ear-growth-stunting thing across his face that was in the show, and you can't feel nearly as bad for him and you just kind of don't care about him. He is just kind of a bad guy who seems like he will always be a bad guy -- static and closed minded. Which is not how he was in the show at all, he was very doubtful and torn, and quite frankly, really interesting, even when he was still being evil and whiny. The Firelord was not some pompous doughboy looking guy either, he was buff and aggressive and the anime equivalent of 'sexy', for lack of a better term. In this movie he is also lame.

1295612,A134MJZL7H493A,B002VPE1BQ,Amazon Customer,"[3, 9]","Let's take a moment to discuss something completely different, but entirely relevant to The Last Airbender. The trend of the new first Neon Genesis Evangelion movie versus the Cowboy Bebop movie. These are anime, which is a style that inspired the Nickelodeon animated show.The Evangelion movie is a retelling of the original show's first few episodes. It's supposed to bring a wider audience to the franchise and eventually retell the whole story in a condensed manner. It is supposed to do so through a trilogy of movies. This is pretty much exactly how The Last Airbender is being set up.The Cowboy Bebop movie retells nothing. It is a standalone movie that takes place in continuity between two of the latter episodes of the series.Let's look at this a little closer. For the Evangelion movie, since they're retelling the story, what is the incentive for the audience to expand their horizon by watching the original show now? What do the fans of the show gain by seeing the same stuff, only mutilated to fit the compressed time of a motion picture?Would it not have been better to have followed in the footsteps of Cowboy Bebop, and told an original story that took place somewhere between a couple episodes of the show? This may have screwed up continuity a bit, but better a tiny bit of fan hatred than almost universal hatred period. Also, what was gained by having a live action adaptation? Where does that make sense? What other animated show has successfully been adapted to live action? The first Ninja Turtles movie is the only one that comes to mind. Why was this not animated? The art and style of the television show was amazing, the bending of each nation had a specific influence in real, distinct styles of martial arts, and it's like they just said screw everything about the show except the most superficial stuff that we can make with CG, toss in some bad redesigns, horrible (but typical of M. Night Shamamalam) dialogue, and hope for a return on investment. Unacceptable to the fans of the show, unacceptable to the franchise and to the people who put so much effort into the original show, and generally just insulting to the creative process as a whole.And speaking of M. Night Shamuamalm, whose decision was it to give an action movie to a man known for slow-burn, pretentious, narcissistic bad movies that lack humor, emotion, action, realistic actions, reactions and dialogue of people, or color; all the things the original show has in spades. Who thought this was a match made in heaven? Don't let them ever make decisions about movies again. Stop that. Don't do that.Y'know, this movie's going to be somewhere between $17 and $30. Your money is better spent on the first season of the original show. It's far better value for money, in that it is longer (20-some shows at 22-ish minutes each), it's far more entertaining, funny, cohesive, imaginative, and involving than this movie could ever hope to be.Here, I'll make is easy for you:Avatar The Last Airbender - The Complete Book 1 CollectionAnd if you want to go a step further, here's the collector's edition:Avatar The Last Airbender: The Complete Book 1 (Collector's Edition)",1,What the why I don't even know,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,3163,"['Let', 'take', 'moment', 'discuss', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'entirely', 'relevant', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'trend', 'new', 'first', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'movie', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'movie', 'are', 'anime', 'style', 'inspired', 'Nickelodeon', 'animated', 'show.The', 'Evangelion', 'movie', 'retelling', 'original', 'show', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'supposed', 'bring', 'wider', 'audience', 'franchise', 'eventually', 'retell', 'whole', 'story', 'condensed', 'manner', 'supposed', 'do', 'so', 'trilogy', 'movies', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'how', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'being', 'set', 'up.The', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'movie', 'nothing', 'standalone', 'movie', 'place', 'continuity', 'two', 'latter', 'episodes', 'series.Let', 'look', 'little', 'closer', 'Evangelion', 'movie', ""'re"", 'retelling', 'story', 'what', 'incentive', 'audience', 'expand', 'horizon', 'watching', 'original', 'show', 'now', 'What', 'do', 'fans', 'show', 'gain', 'seeing', 'same', 'stuff', 'only', 'mutilated', 'fit', 'compressed', 'time', 'motion', 'picture', 'Would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'followed', 'footsteps', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'told', 'original', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'somewhere', 'couple', 'episodes', 'show', 'may', 'have', 'screwed', 'up', 'continuity', 'bit', 'better', 'tiny', 'bit', 'fan', 'hatred', 'almost', 'universal', 'hatred', 'period', 'Also', 'what', 'was', 'gained', 'having', 'live', 'action', 'adaptation', 'Where', 'make', 'sense', 'What', 'other', 'animated', 'show', 'successfully', 'been', 'adapted', 'live', 'action', 'first', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'mind', 'Why', 'was', 'not', 'animated', 'art', 'style', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'amazing', 'bending', 'nation', 'had', 'specific', 'influence', 'real', 'distinct', 'styles', 'martial', 'arts', 'just', 'said', 'screw', 'everything', 'show', 'most', 'superficial', 'stuff', 'can', 'make', 'CG', 'toss', 'bad', 'redesigns', 'horrible', 'typical', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shamamalam', 'dialogue', 'hope', 'return', 'investment', 'Unacceptable', 'fans', 'show', 'unacceptable', 'franchise', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'original', 'show', 'generally', 'just', 'insulting', 'creative', 'process', 'whole.And', 'speaking', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shamuamalm', 'decision', 'was', 'give', 'action', 'movie', 'man', 'known', 'slow-burn', 'pretentious', 'narcissistic', 'bad', 'movies', 'lack', 'humor', 'emotion', 'action', 'realistic', 'actions', 'reactions', 'dialogue', 'people', 'color', 'things', 'original', 'show', 'spades', 'Who', 'thought', 'was', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'ever', 'make', 'decisions', 'movies', 'again', 'Stop', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', ""that.Y'know"", 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'somewhere', '17', '30', 'money', 'better', 'spent', 'first', 'season', 'original', 'show', 'far', 'better', 'value', 'money', 'longer', '20-some', 'shows', '22-ish', 'minutes', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'cohesive', 'imaginative', 'involving', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'be.Here', ""'ll"", 'make', 'easy', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'Complete', 'Book', '1', 'CollectionAnd', 'want', 'go', 'step', 'further', 'here', 'collector', 'edition', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'Complete', 'Book', '1', 'Collector', 'Edition']",The Last Airbender
1295613,AP9UOXX9272YO,B002VPE1BQ,"Amazon Customer ""Noble Poet""","[9, 21]","This film is based off of the show Avatar: The Last Airbender, Book 1: Water.  The way they rushed the scenes and script, one might've thought they'd get through the complete series!  Die hard fans of the show will not like this film.  The cast that seemed to be drawn from a hat were weak, but to be half fair, the script was an epic fail.  The special effects were equal to that of a cheap network sci-fi show.  And as far as directing goes--I cringed about 2 years ago after hearing rumors about M. Night Shyamalan being this film's director, and still, after seeing it, I cringe.  Kudos to The Sixth Sense, but nothing else.If you haven't seen the Nickelodeon series, I highly suggest you do.  You're sure to find it on Netflix or your local Blockbuster.  There are 3 books in this series--Book 1: Water, Book 2: Earth, Book 3: Fire--with each book containing 4 to 5 volumes. As mentioned before, this film starts off with Book 1: Water.  You learn more from Katara's introduction monologue in the opening cartoon episode than you do from most of the feature film.  The series introduction is far more simple to understand.Obviously, you cannot possibly cram every detail from the series into an hour and a half long film.  But this wasn't a film based off of the whole series.  It's based off the grand opening of the series!  So there should be time to develop Aang's crazy fun and playful, carefree character.  There should be time for Sokka to crack some of his obvious, lame jokes that only he finds funny.  There should be time to show the motherly and strong side Katara had since losing her mother.  And it should probably have shown the true, brutal and ruthless nature of the Fire Nation, with exception to banished Prince Zuko's uncle, General Iroh, who's quite lighthearted and wise.  But it's as if these things were not important, so we're left with a flat cast rambling from a shoddy script.  It's as if no one who participated in the making of the film actually watched the series.  It was put together like a school project.So overall, as a film by itself, the film was poor.  Had I not seen the series, I probably would've given it 2 stars because I think the ideas of controlling the 4 elements and visiting the Spirit World are cool.  But still--poorly cast, poorly directed, cheap special effects, and a horrendously written script.

Yes, I realize that many things had to be left out in order to squeeze an entire season into one movie, however, a few SIMPLE things such as character name pronunciation and accurate character representation would have made the film less painful to watch. As a person who occasionally gets teary-eyed during the more emotional sequences of the cartoon series, I felt absolutely no emotion (other than anger) while watching this movie. The actors playing the characters were about as fun to watch as seeing paint dry. I am appalled that a 400-plus minute season of a show could possibly be crammed into a movie that was barely 1 and 1/2 hours. My husband and I were both bored to death while watching this, but we really love the cartoon series, and we are glad that we rented this at Redbox for $1.00, which, as another reviewer stated, is too high a price. The only things that were worth seeing in live action were the costumes (however inaccurate they were), and the sets. Bending was sufficient, but we would have liked to have seen more of it.

Ok now I heard allot of bad things about this movie, but when I sat down with my hubby last night to watch it I was pleasantly surprised, I found the movie entertaining and while it had quite a few flaws and is not what i would call a really good movie, I think it provided a fun watch. Now The Lat Airbender is set in an Asian inspired fantasy world where there are four kingdoms, one for each of the four Western elements, now a few people in each kingdom can manipulate their birth element and are called benders. Now the Fire realm have gone to war on everyone else and have among other things killed off every airbender, now the people's only hope come in the form of a legend that a character called the avatar, someone able to bend all elements will come and save them. Off course this prophecy comes true in the first five minutes of the movie and the rest of the film follows said avatar and two children, a waterbender and her brother who helps him, around on their adventure to liberate the world.Now this movie follows about every fantasy stereotype they can find, however the storyline is interesting enough to hold your attention. Some of the fights in this movie look just plain dumb, but some of the magic battles with elements at least look good. Most of the adult actors do a good job, but the child actors is a different story, Noah Ringer as Aang do a passable job, Dev Patel as Prince Zuko is rather good but the other child actors is lackluster and just seams to be delivering lines.The Last Airbender would have been a better film if it had been longer, characters do not get enough time to develop, however this is a problem many reviews talk about and I do not agree that the story is so condensed as to make the movie unwatchable, however the phasing do seam odd. One thing that I do find disturbing in the movie however is that all the Fire Nation characters have Arabic appearance, I guess following the Asian theme they are supposed to be Indian, however they sure look Arabic to me, now I am all for artistic freedoms however I do question the wisdom of having every villain look Arabic in our current political climate.All in all I found The Last Airbender to be a average film, not so bad as many say, quite entertaining and it do have good parts like the creature designs and some of the music which is quite nice. However phasing problem, lack of involvement from the child actors, very up and down quality to the computer graphics along with other problems keep the movie from being really good. However I was entertained by it and I think that if someone like fantasy, and especially if they are kids themselves they they might at least enjoy this film for a rent. I came to this film with zero expectations and I was pleasantly surprised.",3,I was pleasantly surprised.,1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,2929,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'original', 'cartoon', 'based', 'do', 'list', 'writing', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'now', 'heard', 'allot', 'bad', 'things', 'movie', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'hubby', 'last', 'night', 'watch', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'found', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'flaws', 'not', 'what', 'i', 'would', 'call', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'provided', 'fun', 'watch', 'Now', 'Lat', 'Airbender', 'set', 'Asian', 'inspired', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'four', 'kingdoms', 'one', 'four', 'Western', 'elements', 'now', 'few', 'people', 'kingdom', 'can', 'manipulate', 'birth', 'element', 'are', 'called', 'benders', 'Now', 'Fire', 'realm', 'have', 'gone', 'war', 'everyone', 'else', 'have', 'other', 'things', 'killed', 'off', 'airbender', 'now', 'people', 'only', 'hope', 'come', 'form', 'legend', 'character', 'called', 'avatar', 'someone', 'able', 'bend', 'elements', 'will', 'come', 'save', 'course', 'prophecy', 'true', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'rest', 'film', 'said', 'avatar', 'two', 'children', 'waterbender', 'brother', 'who', 'around', 'adventure', 'liberate', 'world.Now', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'stereotype', 'can', 'find', 'however', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'fights', 'movie', 'look', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'magic', 'battles', 'elements', 'least', 'look', 'good', 'Most', 'adult', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'child', 'actors', 'different', 'story', 'Noah', 'Ringer', 'Aang', 'do', 'passable', 'job', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Prince', 'Zuko', 'rather', 'good', 'other', 'child', 'actors', 'lackluster', 'just', 'seams', 'be', 'delivering', 'lines.The', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'longer', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'time', 'develop', 'however', 'problem', 'many', 'reviews', 'talk', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'story', 'so', 'condensed', 'make', 'movie', 'unwatchable', 'however', 'phasing', 'do', 'seam', 'odd', 'One', 'thing', 'do', 'find', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'however', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'characters', 'have', 'Arabic', 'appearance', 'guess', 'following', 'Asian', 'theme', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'Indian', 'however', 'sure', 'look', 'Arabic', 'now', 'am', 'artistic', 'freedoms', 'however', 'do', 'question', 'wisdom', 'having', 'villain', 'look', 'Arabic', 'current', 'political', 'climate.All', 'found', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'be', 'average', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'many', 'say', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'parts', 'creature', 'designs', 'music', 'quite', 'nice', 'However', 'phasing', 'problem', 'lack', 'involvement', 'child', 'actors', 'very', 'up', 'down', 'quality', 'computer', 'graphics', 'other', 'problems', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'really', 'good', 'However', 'was', 'entertained', 'think', 'someone', 'fantasy', 'especially', 'are', 'kids', 'might', 'least', 'enjoy', 'film', 'rent', 'came', 'film', 'zero', 'expectations', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised']",The Last Airbender

1295621,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B002VPE1BQ,Armando N. Roman,"[5, 9]","I'd heard nothing but bad things about The Last Airbender over the last couple of months. Most of it was feedback from fans of the animated series, who went off about tons of changes made to characters, no matter how minor they were. Ethnicity, pronunciations of names, the color of their outfits, everything. I have only seen a few episodes of the Avatar series, and liked what I saw, but never had the time to watch it in its entirety, so more or less, I went into this not knowing anything about the source material. At the same time, M. Night Shyamalan sure hasn't had any good movies under his belt for the last 6-7 years, so I was already doubtful. Well, I thought I had my picks for the worst movies I'd seen all year, but watching The Last Airbender, I might have to reorganize my list, because this sure as hell is in the top 3. Again, this is not a review from a fan of the series, so there isn't any bias. But this -is- pretty awful, and knowing that they tried to cram 20 episodes of the series into one movie just makes me wonder what they were thinking releasing the movie as it was.The basic plot summary is that there's a boy named Aang, more or less a messiah who has been missing from the world for a century. There are four different tribes on earth, each controlling one of the main elements: earth, fire, wind and water (sorry Captain Planet fans, no Heart here) and Aang was born with the ability to control all four. It's his job to keep the peace amongst them, but things aren't going too well, thanks to the Fire nation trying to take over the other tribes. Aang and two waterbenders go with Aang to try and keep the Fire nation from taking over everything. Yes, it's as boring as it sounds.Normally when I do a plot summary for a movie, it's a lot longer than that. But with The Last Airbender, I was so bored watching the movie that I didn't care about anything. None of the characters appealed to me because of how poor the performances were, and everyone seemed devoid of emotion half the time. Any potentially cool action scenes were lost in slow fights of elements almost to the point where it seemed like there was lag when someone would throw fire or water at someone. Really, if it takes 2 seconds for your fireball to merely be summoned, and a few more long seconds to reach the target who's no more than 20 feet in front of you, what's the point in using it at all? Something else that bugged me about the elemental powers here is that the Fire nation is seen as a huge threat, conquering other territories, and many are scared of them. Yet when they get into fights with earth and water users, nearly all fire attacks are blocked because water puts it out and earth just plain stops it. 'reminds me of Pokemon games and how screwed you are most of the time in early gym battles if you pick a fire type as your starter. What I'm guessing are lovable animal characters in the animated series are lifeless special effects in the movie- a giant flying buffalo-looking thing, and a little flying monkey. The little monkey was used so much that you'd think the animation team was desperate to get it in any scene they possibly could. I'm really surprised I managed to stay awake through the whole movie, even with the 'epic' final battle that lasted a few minutes and had no climax to speak of. You know what? I think watching this movie has inspired me to give the animated series a shot now, because there's no way that thing can be as lifeless as this junk.And yet, I'll bump up the rating by a star because of the blu-ray, which looks and sounds incredible. This would be a great movie to show off your home theater with, provided people don't know what movie it is you're showing them. Visually, it looks perfect, and the DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless audio track is great. The special features are pretty loaded too, with an hour long documentary going over everything that went into the movie, a featurette just for creating the final battle, and more. It's just too bad such a boring movie got better treatment than movies that are at least average.The Last Airbender is one of those movies that I'll forget about in a week or two from now, but always remember as one of the worst I saw in 2010. It's definitely not one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen, but I can't stress how boring it is. How do you make an animated series about martial arts, element controlling, and interesting looking creatures, and turn it into...THIS? Most of M. Night's movies have a twist near the end, but I think the twist with The Last Airbender is that it never gets good.

1295622,A5EKUC02QJKWE,B002VPE1BQ,"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[10, 21]","Let me start this review off by saying that The Last Airbender was an embarassing piece of filmmaking. I could not see how the filmmakers saw the supposed finished product of this and thought it was okay to be released. I think M. Night Shyamalan is a talented director, but only in his element (no pun intended), which is obviously horror and contemporary science fiction. Going into the realm of fantasy and action was not an intelligent move for Shyamalan. I was strongly anticipating this film, and I was actually looking forward to see Shyamalan take on a completely new project, which I heard he was very passionate about. So, it had to be good, right? No way! The film was sloppy--an utter mess--the characters were extremely one-dimensional (I could care less for the fate of any of them). The only thing that got me through this film were some of the action sequences, which were, at times, impressive to behold, but they did not deliver quite as well as they should have. For one thing, there was always a set choreography in the art of bending, which was very aesthetically pleasing, but that never quite worked in tandem with the special effects. Another aspect of the film that butchered the overall aesthetic was the cinematography: it was never stable. I felt M. Night Shyamalan did not know what he wanted to do with the camera, or what he wanted to focus on. In other words, the camerawork was drab and quite awkward. For example, sometimes he'd have a long shot depicting two of the actors. He'd have one actor acting while the other literally blatantly seems to be waiting to deliver his lines. If the blocking is off, there are ways of concealing that. For example, instead of showing the two actors, show a close-up of the one communicating and then a close-up of the other actor responding. But no, Shyamalan was too fond of his long and medium shots without bothering to block secondary characters that were in the frame. Other shots were so close that when the lead would talk, his mouth would disappear under the frame. That is bad filmmaking. I felt Shyamalan was trying to apply some of the camerawork he used in films such as Unbreakable or Signs, but that kind of cinematography is too mundane for a child's fantasy film. Both Unbreakable and Signs were meant to embrace a sense of realism. The Last Airbender destroys the conventions of realism and it should be acknowledged and treated as such. For example, a director of photography such as Bruno Delbonel would have been able to treat this material like a work of art. If this film at least had good camerawork, I think that would have distracted me away from the daft plot, acting, and script discrepancies. I know Shyamalan wishes to make a series out of this, just like the show. I don't think he should give up on it, but I do think he should read a lot of the reviews for this film and try to enhance the story for the next installment. EIther he do that, or step down as director and become producer, and allow another person take the creative, artistic licenses with this material. Many have said this film marks the end of Shyamalan's career, and I say I definitely disagree. Many filmmakers hit rough patches in movie-making careers, and Shyamalan has hit one.

The characters are lovable. The special effects are amazing! I'm flabbergasted that so many people don't like this film.

It is really, really hard to watch his forced acting throughout this movie.What's more, as stated a bazillion times in these reviews... M. Night takes a great series and ruins it on so many levels.  As a true series fan, I feel violated.  To the point that I may need psychological counseling (not really).The series presents a well written, well acted (voice acted) story that draws you in completely.  It's anime suffices for the action therein.  AND.. the series is presented with an Asian theme, Buddhism, Taoism and other Eastern undertones, and the ANIME of the movie reflects the races of the people as being of Asian decent.THIS F-ed up stinking pile of digested food out of the south end of an elephant presents an poor acting Aang, who is Caucasian.  As are most of the other actors; they throw in a few Asian extras to pay penance to the series and that is it.  Further adding to the molestation of the series by M. Night, Aang's Eastern religious influences from the series are changed by Aang's tattoos being changed to a Cross, rather than a straight line.Then, there's the montages, the sporadic narration to fill in the gaps.There is so, so, so much wrong with this movie.  M. Night really needs a punch in the face for this movie.  He needs to sit his ass down and actually watch the series, and then try to do it honor rather than try to sell tickets simply on visual effects.  When you do that, you get this stinking mess.If you find this movie thrown out on the road, it might be worth watching.If you want to rent it for $3.99... then you've wasted $3.99.If you are not a series fan, this may be appealing to you.Perhaps you could watch it, and then watch the series, and then wonder why you watched this mess in the first place.I might have to contact my Congressman about this.  Its that bad.  I need to start a grass-roots protest against this.Such a dis-service to a off-the-charts awesome tv series.Please M. Night, don't fornicate us again on the next movie...

It tells the story of four nations Air, water, fire,  and earth, each of which has inhabitants called benders that can control their nation's element. All nations lived in peace until the fire nation attacked in hopes of taking over. The  remedy for their defeat  is the person known as the avatar. The only being capable of mastering all four elements and burdened with the responsibility of keeping peace between the nations. If the Avatar dies he is reincarnated into a bender of the next element in the cycle and must journey the world to learn the other three.  This movie is a terrible rendition of the story.  The actors are terrible. This is a major understament for the character of prince Zuko.  within the cartoon he is forceful and demanding with a harsh and nilhistic demeanor. The prince Zuko in this film is pitiful not only in appearance, but in his acting. he blurts out lines like a child.The Avatar's name and those of his friends are  constantly mispronounced and this film strips away from Aang his playful and goofy side replacing it with a laughable form of stoic detachment. The bending is accomplished with overly dramatic yoga moves that in lieu of their quick performance in the cartoon are slow and look terrible. The film threw a whole bunch of special effects together  and melded them  with inexperienced actors and TERRIBLE dialogue. An example of which is see when aang talks to the earthbenders and says ""The ground is an extension of who you are!!!!"" If you're trying to encourage someone let alone a group of people, do you really think comparing them to the dirt under their feet is going to work? They're eathbenders, not dirt.Cartoon facts vs Movie lies:Avatars can marry and have children in the cartoon and they do. In this movie Aang constantly repeats that the monks told him he could never have a family. LIE!!!!Firebenders can make their own fire in the cartoon. In the movie firebenders could not do that. they could only use fire if they found some LIE!!!.The Avatar's name is pronounced ""ang""  as in the end of ""Bang"".

What you get is a very painful movie experience.I just don't get the whole thing with the ""Benders"".  They are not very impressive at all. It takes a number of Tai-Chi type movements before they can manipulate matter.  Unfortunately, it takes way too many moves to do anything, which should make them easy to kill.

They better have a lot and I mean a lot of special features on this dvd and included the game free.  I agree with the reviews, the pronouncation of Aang's and Sokka's name it was irritating, Sokka lack of comic relief, the Fire Lord who in the end of the movie stumbled over his lines and the acting for most of the charactors was flat very flat I was like were did they get these people?  They could have gotten better actors fresh from acting school and I think they would have done better. I didn't mind the story line but the acting sucked and the over the top bending moves.  I don't think I am going to like the next one if there is a next one.  When I saw who was going to play Azula I was like I don't think she is going to work.  She looked more cutie pie than jealous and crafty to me.  I would be surprise if another one is made because that was the worst movie making I have ever seen.  The creaters of the show must be saying why did we let this happen.  My favorite actors was the girl Katara, the guy who played Zuko and Aang everyone else can go. I liked Appa and Momo they did a good job on them and the special effects and the fighting scene when they was at the Water Tribe I thought was good. Overall they ruined the feel of The Last Airbender shows.  After watching the movie we had to watch the shows to get that good feeling back.

I go in with an open mind, but then, minute by minute, it seems as if he's purposely trying to push me away with his unreasonably slow pacing, his amateurish dialogue, his bizarre character development, his ill-fitting sense of humor, and in some cases, his ridiculous plot twists. By the time I leave, a wall has gone up, and I feel cheated and angry. Many have felt the same way about ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening,"" but few agreed with me on ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" ""Signs,"" and ""The Village."" The first even garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.Now we have ""The Last Airbender,"" a live-action 3-D adaptation of the Nickelodeon anime series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender."" Unfortunately, Shyamalan has proven he can alienate younger audiences just as easily as older ones. It's a children's film, and yet he didn't seem to have children in mind when making it; it's unmanageably plot-heavy, the dialogue is rife with incomprehensible exposition, the last minute 2-D to 3-D conversion is unimpressive, and worst of all, the characters are badly drawn - a mistake, I suspect, that was made worse with the casting of white actors in roles that were intended to be Asian and Inuit. There are a few enjoyable action sequences and moments of digital wizardry, but on the whole, I cannot envision anyone, kids least of all, making heads or tails of this film.The premise is that, in an alternate reality, the world is divided into four elemental kingdoms: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Within each are people who can manipulate, or bend, the elements. The Fire Nation, having already overseen the genocide of the Air Nomads, is now waging war against the Earth Kingdom and the Water Tribes. From the Southern Water Tribe, we meet a teen waterbender named Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her brother, Sokka (Jackson Rathbone); while hunting, they crack open a gigantic sphere of ice, releasing little Aang (Noah Ringer), the sole surviving airbender who disappeared 100 years ago. As it turns out, he's also the Avatar, which is to say he's the only one with the ability to control all four elements. Apparently, he can go into meditative trances and have conversations with a dragon spirit, a skill that's never adequately explained apart from its obvious implications.While well skilled in the art of airbending, Aang was never trained to bend water, earth, or fire. So begins his journey to the Northern Water Tribe, since, according to him, water training the natural progression from air training. He has to be careful; the Fire Nation is aware of his existence, and more than one person is pursuing him. Firstly, there's Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis). Secondly, there's Ozai's exiled son, Prince Zuko (Dev Patel), who hopes to regain his honor by capturing Aang. Finally, there's Admiral Zhao (Aasif Mandvi), Zuko's main rival.It seems basic enough, but the plot is deceptively weighty, mostly due to extremely long-winded explanations about various spirits, periods in history, peoples, places, and philosophies. Some are woven into unnecessary subplots. When Aang, Katara, and Sokka arrive in the Northern Water Tribe, for example, Sokka immediately falls in love a white-haired princess named Yue (Seychelle Gabriel); because so little time is spent on them, we can't invest in their relationship, nor can we absorb the details of her miraculous birth or her connection to the spirit of the moon. And then there's Zuko's uncle, Iroh (Shaun Toub), who really serves no purpose except to be an easy-going crutch for Zuko to lean on. He has his own troubled past, although it's alluded to so casually and briefly that one wonders why Shyamalan deemed it necessary.What he seems to be doing is taking an entire series' worth of information and packing it into a single film. This isn't how it works; when it comes to a film adaptation, especially of a lengthy source, one must know exactly which story should be told and then proceed to remove the extraneous details. Yes, sacrifices would be made, but the simple fact is that movies generally require streamlines plots. There's no conceivable way audiences are going to take in everything ""The Last Airbender"" tells them. There's simply too much of it. Worse still, it's not told particularly well. If you doubt me, listen to the dialogue Shyamalan supplies Aang with. When he speaks, he sounds more like a modern-day kid than a revered figure of myth.I don't want to write Shyamalan off as a bad filmmaker. He has disappointed me time and time again, but I can't help but feel that, somewhere deep down, he has what it takes to make a good movie. His previous films, even the ones I flat out hated, all had flashes of greatness. What he needs to finally realize is that successful films cannot be just about the craft; he must stop laboring over atmosphere and put some effort into actual storytelling. ""The Last Airbender,"" while stylistically and thematically different from his earlier efforts, is a burden to watch, an overstuffed and underdeveloped adventure fantasy that doesn't have any audience capable of following along in mind. Yet again, I have built up a wall, and its seeming less and less likely that I'll ever be able to knock it down.",3,"Elemental, My Dear Shyamalan",1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,5482,"['Ever', 'seeing',

1295653,A1OGORMOPYZ0PY,B002VPE1BQ,"C. LeBlanc ""I love music!""","[5, 13]","With all the drop-dead FLOPS this guy (M.Night) has made... It's truly astounding & baffling, that people STILL ALLOW this man to direct (or even WRITE) movies!  He had TWO movies, which were DECENT (6th Sense & Signs); however, once you've seen the 6th Sense -- there's NO point in watching it ever again.... and Signs is only good for 2, maybe 3 viewings.  I too was amped after watching the trailers for this movie, because it looked like it would be a great family action flick... (but cringed, as soon as I saw M.Night's name in the credits, hell, you know why!)Unlike most though, I was completely unaware of the tv series & waited until AFTER I'd seen the movie, to rent the 3 TV Seasons (because of how I felt about the movie, and based on so many saying how great the series was -- figured I'd rent them & see for myself).After viewing all 3 Seasons, I'm even more disgusted with this Movie (and I didn't think that was even possible)!  Nevermind the TERRIBLE script, directing, and fluidity of the movie.... Nevermind the lack of essential characters, locations, etc.... This movie is completely & entirely terrible, just based on the atrocious & unbelievable acting by MOST of the main characters!... oh, and it's insanely boring to boot, with maybe 10 minutes of combined ""action"" throughout the entire film (12 min. max).  Even IF they go ahead & make the 2nd & 3rd film adaptations... and even IF they get someone with TALENT to write & direct those... the entire Series/Trilogy is now RUINED, because they're either stuck with the same GOD-AWFUL main cast of actors.... or.... they have to get GOOD actors to replace them, thus creating no continuity from the 1st to 2nd &/or 3rd, just as far as characters go.  (I too agree, that the Kyoshi Warriors should've been included... perhaps, since they're Earth Kingdom related, they planned on putting them in the 2nd/Earth Film... but who knows)At any rate, even IF the studio decides to go ahead & make the Trilogy and not end it with this one (as New Line Cinema did with ""The Golden Compass"" when they weren't satisfied w/ box-office sales)..... and again, even IF M.Night is replaced by someone with ACTUAL TALENT.... the Trilogy is effectively Ruined.  Even IF the rest of the Trilogy is AWESOME... you still have to either (painfully) endure watching the 1st Film; or be forever lacking the beginning part of the Trilogy & Story.  _____  I also agree, this was shortened WAY too much.  1.5 Hrs is just laughable, given the AMPLE EXCESS of material which was there to choose from.... but even IF they release an ""extended Director's Cut"" or something.... come on.... M.Night is still the Director... and adding more minutes back to the film, will only make it that much more boring & painful to watch.One would think... after ""Unbreakable"" (1 Star), ""The Villiage"" (2 Stars), ""Lady In the Water"" (or whatever it was called, 1 Star)... and ""The Happening"" (ZERO Stars).... Hollywood would've black-listed M.Night, for fear of releasing yet another Pathetic film.  But no.  Apparently, he wanted the ""hat-trick""... and just had to completely ruin an already successful TV Series... completely ruin a 1st in a Trilogy... and completely ruin the ""careers"" of nearly every kid-actor in the film... as NONE of them will probably EVER be able to ""work"" in film again... due to the horrible acting displayed in the film.  (which is another thing... surely, M.Night could've done a few (hundred) more ""takes"" of certain scenes, to TRY and get better performances out of many of the cast... since for whatever reason, he couldn't find better actors to begin with!???  Seriously, he's wasted Hundreds of Reels of Film, not to mention, Millions of Producer & Studio Dollars over the last 10 Years or so... so why get stingy regarding how many takes & how much film is used now!!?!?)Pathetic. Terrible. Waste of film. Call it what you will... it's all true... and M.Night should be BANNED from ever being even LOOSELY associated with another film, ever again.  No more Writing, Certainly no more Directing..... heck, this guy shouldn't even be allowed to go on TOURS of the studio (you know, bus-tours w/ tourists, etc.)..... any time this guy even tries to set foot on a Studio's parking lot, he should be thrown in jail for trespassing!

1295655,A3C6NQZIZT09OD,B002VPE1BQ,"Coren Alan Grill ""Coren""","[8, 19]","I'l make this short.  I'm not familiar with the anime, like my 6 year old little girl.  We never got the chance to see this in the theaters (we really-really wanted to), and finally was able to see it when we received the blu-ray movie for Christmas.  I can easily say, the movie was really great.  The story was easy to follow, all the while handling multiple plot points just as well as the first Hellboy movie (origins, development, destiny-driven, evloving the character etc...).  I almost gave it a 4 star because of some of the acting, but as I am a very large fan of all things anime since 1993, I half wonder if the director was trying to go for that ""over-the-top"" American voice acting we seem to get in every anime brought to the US with the actors.  So in a way, though it's live action (first dubbed TV Evangelion episode anyone?), it still fits in really well over-all after you get used to all the actors, and the plots.  My little girl mention a few things about some of the characters and difference and the like.  But then again just like novel made into movies, it they aren't changed somewhat there would be nothing much to talk about nor hardly any healthy debates.

Night ShyamalanDIRECTED BY: M. Night ShyamalanRated: PGGenre: Action / FantasyRelease Date: 01 July 2010Review Date: 22 September 2010M. Night Shyamalan is a long, long ways away from The Sixth Sense and Signs. Between what he did with the second half of The Happening, and what he's done here with The Last Airbender - I'm in no rush to see his next film. And don't even get me started on The Village; I'd run out of ink and you'd go blind.Noah Ringer stars as Aang; `the last Airbender.' What the hell is an Airbender you ask? Someone who can bend air. Why would someone want to bend air? To swoosh away bad guys, I guess - you tell me. Am I the only one that finds this incredibly lame? There really is no better word than lame, I promise.The movie is filled with characters that can bend things. Earth, fire, water and air. There are never-ending segments of watching characters interact with one another, using their different bending techniques on each other. How is this entertaining? The special effects add little to no appeal to this boring plot point.Brother and sister Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) and Katara (Nicola Peltz) find Aang early on in the film and feel a need to protect him. They need to protect him because he may or may not be `the chosen one'; prophesized to lead their people to peace when other benders using their powers to do bad, come-a-knockin'.I can't even begin to explain the plot from there, because it was all over the place, and to be quite honest, I lost interest within the first 15 minutes. From what I could gather, at one point it was pretty clear, but then quickly becomes murky with useless added elements. Out of left field Sokka begins a romance with a princess, then she is somehow a magic fish, and that kid we all loved in Slumdog Millionaire (Dev Patel) comes into play, and tries to beat up our heroes to impress his daddy (Cliff Curtis) who is someone of great importance to the story. And the Slumdog kid's uncle is also evil, and trying to create friction between the father and son.The acting is sometimes good, but is mostly bad. I don't blame any of the actors however, what with the pitiful dialogue they were given to work with. I can see how this flick will be fun for a certain age group of kids, but it's not for me.Please tell me the cartoon it's based on is more appealing than this. And God help us, based on the end, there will be at least another installment to follow this segment of dread. I'll leave you with saying that, once upon a time... M.

The earnestness of the young actors also really helped convey a sense of innocence and purity (also lacking in Hollywood), even though the acting itself was not Oscar quality.This is not a movie that appeals to critics, who tend to like overly dramatic movies with conflicted characters and a muddied lines between right and wrong, good and evil. This movie has none of that. This does not show the dirt of humanity (such as the abase ""District 9""). It seems to me that most people go to the movies to be lifted up, not to see more of what can already been seen in the world. As an epic, this movie was extremely far-sighted. One thus has to be far-sighted to appreciate it.Moral values conveyed;-forgiveness of one's enemies (and seeking reconciliation/friendship)-reverence and respect toward spiritual realities-humility necessary for an appointed mission-true love requires sacrifice-the importance of honor, honesty, friendship, and unity",5,an *extremely* under-rated transcendent film,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,1039,"['movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'mystical', 'beauty', 'be', 'sorely', 'undervalued', 'today', 'earnestness', 'young', 'actors', 'also', 'really', 'helped', 'convey', 'sense', 'innocence', 'purity', 'also', 'lacking', 'Hollywood', 'even', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'Oscar', 'quality.This', 'not', 'movie', 'appeals', 'critics', 'who', 'tend', 'like', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'movies', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'muddied', 'lines', 'right', 'wrong', 'good', 'evil', 'movie', 'none', 'not', 'show', 'dirt', 'humanity', 'such', 'abase', 'District', '9', 'most', 'people', 'go', 'movies', 'be', 'lifted', 'up', 'not', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'can', 'already', 'been', 'seen', 'world', 'epic', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'far-sighted', 'One', 'thus', 'be', 'far-sighted', 'appreciate', 'it.Moral', 'values', 'conveyed', '-forgiveness', 'one', 'enemies', 'seeking', 'reconciliation/friendship', '-reverence', 'respect', 'spiritual', 'realities-humility', 'necessary', 'appointed', 'mission-true', 'love', 'sacrifice-the', 'importance', 'honor', 'honesty', 'friendship', 'unity']",The Last Airbender

Night Shyamalan's big name and previous work raised my family's expectations very high.Ten minutes into this film, we agreed that the dialogue was VERY poor. We speculated that it was perhaps a film aimed at ten-year-olds. Fifteen minutes into it, one of us suggested that the script had actually been written BY ten-year-olds. Thereafter, we made a game of watching it: whenever anything outrageously funny occurred (unintentionally funny, of course), we would pause the film to make fun of it--and sometimes replay the scene once or twice.The story is a jumble of elements ""borrowed"" from a dozen or more better fantasy and martial arts films. The plot premise is rather childish, the continuity is poor and illogical, and the dialogue is stilted some moments and slangy-modern other moments--with the whole film being merely a set-up for . . . a sequel.The acting is uneven--ranging from ""F"" quality up to the ""C"" range. Even the more experienced and skilled cast members have to cope with  poor writing and stereotyped characters. Sadly, there is not even one person in this film that we can really care about, favorably or unfavorably.The special effects are mostly a huge disappointment--for about 4 minutes near the end, they approach the quality of those in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON--but mostly they are boring or just laughable. Most of the battle scenes lack ""drive"" and ""cohesion."" They typically involve one-on-one fights, even when fifty or more people are faced off--i.e., two people kick or swing at each other until one of them is knocked down, while everyone else basically stands and waits--then the next couple starts kicking or swinging, etc. etc. etc. Rarely is there any sense of a real group battle taking place, such as we get in films like THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE GOLDEN COMPASS--or even KUNG FU PANDA.And speaking of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, watching any two minutes of it is at least fifteen times more enjoyable and meaningful than the entire experience of THE LAST AIRBENDER.Among this DVD's ""bonus features"" are few deleted scenes. Most viewers, after looking at these, will probably wish that many MORE scenes had been deleted.The GOOD news for my family is that we rented it. I would strongly recommend that nobody buy this film without first doing likewise.

This is a film directed by someonewho thinks humanity will be attacked by pollen, and it's adapting the show's first season into a feature-length plane; to be fair, half of the first season was filler anyway, so the film shouldn't have too much trouble adapting important story elements from Book 1.  Because of prior expectations, I did anticipate some grave prospects like the kid actors being shoddy, having repulsively stupid scenes like when Peter Parker went gothic in ""Spider-man 3"", or even make a lackluster effort into follow its source material. As it turned out, only one of those prospects were true, but I was otherwise pretty humble with its final product. It's not a very good adaptation, but at least it's a step above ""Jonah Hex"" and ""Dragonball: Evolution"".  To go into further details due to my exposure to the cartoon, I'll have to review it in two ways: my normal foolhardy self, and my FANBOY self.I should commend M. Night Shyamalan for trying to be straightforward with the story; I'm not saying it's simple, just straightforward.  It goes through the premise of a world where certain people can manipulate certain elements in four different nations.  The fire nation decided to conquer the world, and only the master of all four elements, The Avatar can stop it, but he vanished for a century until he was discovered by two teens from the southern water tribe.  The Avatar is a young reluctant airbender who hasn't understood his powers, and thus he and the discoverers go on a journey so he can learn to bend them all.  The movie is pretty faithful to the first sesaon, where it ends in the aftermath of the northern water tribe battle, and there isn't a insipid twist in the mix.  I do have to chastise him a bit for starting the film with a boring opening crawl with nothing in the background; it could've been more exciting to show the events that occur in the past instead of just leaving text to be read by the narrator.  Speaking of, the narrator is very obnoxious, from explaining many events that never happened on-screen to detailing what the characters are feeling; yea, because if the two people are staring at each other with love in their eyes, I have to be told they're in love.  The audience isn't that dumb.[FANBOY] OMG, what happened to the original characters?  They changed so much during the movie transition!  Katara is no longer bossy and spunky, she's now happy and mellow and completely boring.  And what happened to her hair-loopies?!  Sokka lost his comic relief trait and the stiffly-performance actor made him sound mopey and pathetic; he had a unique character arc in the series, and this movie trashed it.  The Fire Lord Ozai shouldn't even be in this first act of the story, he was only briefly mentioned in the show's Book 1 and is shown in silhouettes, which the mystery of him makes him a formidable foe.  Iroh and Zhao seems to have their roles switched, as Iroh appear more lean and threatening than Zhao, which should've been the other way around.  The only characters that remain what they originally were are the main protagonist and antagonist, Aang and Zuko; Aang still has that carefree, fun and idealistic attitude about him, and while Zuko had hair this early in the story, the actor manage to keep the basic structures of his character, which are hot-tempered and assertive.  BTW, why are their names pronounced so differently? [/FANBOY]""The Last Airbender"" has a serious emphasis on exposition.  Put aside the analytical narrator, the characters themselves revolve around explaining what they're suppose to do, who they are, and what path they should follow, nevermind just having a chat for fun.  I don't mind a little guidance to the plot, but such expository can be arbitrary at times.  One unorthodox scene has Zuko asking some random kid to explain how the antagonist had a scar on his face and why he was exiled from his nation; why didn't Zuko explain this himself and why wasn't this backstory shown earlier when Zhao confronted Zuko about his exile, I was baffled.  Even after putting much time in explaining things, it doesn't explain enough.  There are a lot plot holes in this movie that would irritate 100-year-old wheelchair bound psychopaths with a taste for pizza rolls.  It didn't explain how Aang and his large pet Appa were frozen in ice for a century, how Zuko found out that Aang was captured by Zhao at one point, how Aang found out about the secret temple needed to learn about his legacy, or how Zhao discovered the secret scrolls needed to destroy the plot device later in the film.[FANBOY]  Of course, I knew exactly why since I saw the first season more than twice, but what about the audience who never saw the cartoon?  Those are issues that can't be ignored.  I'm annoyed by how the film downplayed certain elements from the show.  It downplayed the romance between Aang and Katara (darn it, I want my Kataang!), it downplayed Princess Yue which makes her final moment lacking the impact it originally had, and it even downplayed the Avatar State.  The Avatar State was a powerful form for Aang, and he didn't want to use it because of how dangerous and uncontrollable it is, which became an ongoing crisis which also developed his character; in this movie, he only used it once to make a large tidal wave that does nothing.  Sadly, the movie also downplayed its humor.  It's a serious movie, TOO serious; the cartoon does have its dramatic elements, but it's always in high spirits, being funny as well as being adventurous.  Taking away the fun of the show makes the characters and their situations unfulfilling for this movie. [/FANBOY]Now that I think about it, the plot of ""The Last Airbender"" is incredibly bare.  It could've been better as a 2 1/2 hour movie instead of 90 minutes, that way most of the plot holes would be resolved and more time would help develop the characters.  But as it is, the film's a byproduct of the director knowing the people love the source material, but he doesn't seem to know WHY they do: it's an underwhelming treatment for the show's fans and a rushed, convoluted movie for non-fans; I could see why both sides wanted to burn this to the ground.I still enjoy it for its technical achievements.  The special effects were well-done, the fight scenes were pretty sweet...except for the stupid Earthbending scene (""You're standing in dirt!""), and it had some decent performances; the actor playing Sokka was the weakest in the cast, but Noah Ringer did a fine job as Aang and so is Dev Patel as Zuko.  The music was the only technical aspect I didn't like, it's about as westernized as the actors playing the characters; could've been better with exotic Asian instruments.  For all it's faults, I'm one of the few who's willing to give the film a pass.[Reviewer's View: possible sequels]Considering how critically panned it is and the underwhelming box-office sales, it's all but guaranteed that there's not going to be a sequel.  But what if there is?  In fact, just the thought of it actually scares me.  Unlike the first season, EVERY EPISODE OF SEASON TWO IS IMPORTANT!  Even a 2 1/2 hour movie wouldn't cover it without severely cutting important sub-plots; heck, the first film already removed one sub-plot about a rebel kid, which would appear in the next act.  And since the first movie is devoid of comedy, I'm pretty sure the same mood applies to the second film, meaning when the second act introduces the blind character, it would possibly excised the cynical, sarcastic charm about that character; plus, there would be no more funny blind jokes.I can't believe I'm thinking negatively about a sequel that hasn't been greenlighted at this point.",3,Underbends Its Bounds,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,7868,"['Part', 'heartbroken', 'amount', 'negative', 'criticism', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'received', 'considering', ""'m"", 'fan',

Night Shyamalan has disappointed us in the past, we seem to continue to have high hopes for every movie he releases, as if it will once again astound us the wayThe Sixth Sense,Unbreakable,Signs, andThe Villagedid. But alas, that has yet to come to pass.One of the main things I heard about this movie before I saw it was that it was boring. That didn't bother me. I have seen movies that were really boring for the most part, but still had a great finish and left you satisfied. So I went in with low expectations, but high hopes. Well, it was boring. And the reason that it was boring was because it was so very poorly acted. Everyone seemed so emotionless and robotic. The lines were spoken, but the emotions were lacking or wrong. The wrong words in a line were emphasized, and you knew that because you could tell from the line what the emotion was supposed to be, yet the actor was acting out a completely opposite emotion. I will say thatSlumdog Millionaire's Dev Patel did a decent job, but even he could have done more with the character than what we saw.At first, I thought that maybe the movie was just poorly written, but in listening to the words, the script could be pulled off well if the actors were good. But the actors were just horrible in this film. I don't understand what happened. Shyamalan did some amazing work with the young actors in Sixth Sense and Signs, what happened to that ability? Where was his focus in this film?Other than the acting, the film had good effects and fun fight scenes. But the movie was slow and anti-climatic. The film had awesome potential, but it was just so poorly crafted. I would say that this movie was really not even worth seeing once... well, maybe if it was free... and it was really late at night... because everything is better late at night... and we don't know why... but that's the only time I can really watch movies likeStrange BrewandMonty Python And The Holy Grail... they're so much funnier late at night...anyways...[...]",1,Boring and poorly written,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,2013,"['matter', 'how', 'bad', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'disappointed', 'past', 'seem', 'continue', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'wayThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'Signs', 'andThe', 'Villagedid', 'alas', 'yet', 'come', 'pass.One', 'main', 'things', 'heard', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'was', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'were', 'really', 'boring', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'had', 'great', 'finish', 'left', 'satisfied', 'So', 'went', 'low', 'expectations', 'high', 'hopes', 'Well', 'was', 'boring', 'reason', 'was', 'boring', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'poorly', 'acted', 'Everyone', 'seemed', 'so', 'emotionless', 'robotic', 'lines', 'were', 'spoken', 'emotions', 'were', 'lacking', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'words', 'line', 'were', 'emphasized', 'knew', 'could', 'tell', 'line', 'what', 'emotion', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'actor', 'was', 'acting', 'out', 'completely', 'opposite', 'emotion', 'will', 'say', 'thatSlumdog', 'Millionaire', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'character', 'what', 'saw.At', 'first', 'thought', 'maybe', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'poorly', 'written', 'listening', 'words', 'script', 'could', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'horrible', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'Shyamalan', 'did', 'amazing', 'work', 'young', 'actors', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Signs', 'what', 'happened', 'ability', 'Where', 'was', 'focus', 'film', 'Other', 'acting', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'effects', 'fun', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'was', 'slow', 'anti-climatic', 'film', 'had', 'awesome', 'potential', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'poorly', 'crafted', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'not', 'even', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', 'well', 'maybe', 'was', 'free', 'was', 'really', 'late', 'night', 'everything', 'better', 'late', 'night', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'only', 'time', 'can', 'really', 'watch', 'movies', 'likeStrange', 'BrewandMonty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', ""'re"", 'so', 'much', 'funnier', 'late', 'night', 'anyways', '[', ']']",The Last Airbender

And there are adaptations that rip asunder the source material and gleefully devour its corpse.This is one of the last category.I might have been able to still enjoy ""The Last Airbender"" if it had merely had special effects, a horrible script and actors with the charisma of a plank. But director M. Night Shyamalan gets EVERYTHING ELSE wrong too, from the character motivations to bending.Southern Water Tribe girl Katara and her brother Sokka stumble across a glowing glacier, and find a young Airbender boy inside. Since all the other Airbenders are dead, Katara figures out that Aang is the Avatar -- the master of all four elements, and the only person in the world who can defeat the powerful Fire Nation.However, the Fire Nation has already found him, in the form of the disgraced Prince Zuko (Dev Patel). Aang, Sokka and Katara set out on a perilous voyage to the North Pole to find a waterbending master. But the malevolent Admiral Zhao -- Zuko's nemesis -- is approaching the North Pole with the Fire Nation navy, with a plan that may destroy them all.M. Night Shyamalan had a golden opportunity with ""The Last Airbender"" -- the original cartoon was intelligent, funny, complex and filled with brilliant martial-arts and strong philosophical overtones. So instead he decided to make a movie with NONE of that -- a witless, humorless, simplistic stumbling behemoth of a film.The culture, the characters, the climactic battle, the bending, the acting, the action sequences, and even the pronunciation of the names... EVERYTHING IS WRONG. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. But if I listed everything wrong with the movie, this review would be the size of a novel.Even from an objective perspective, this movie is a disaster. Shyamalan clearly has no idea how to write an action movie, blasting through incoherent fight scenes in one long pan. The story feels painfully repetitive (how many times is Aang going to be captured?!) and the script is horrendously pompous, humorless and rushed (""We have to show them that we believe in our beliefs as much as they believe in theirs"" -- WHAT? You're not trying to SAVE THE WORLD?).Also, there are gaping plot holes that a three-year-old can spot. So the Fire Nation imprisons Earthbenders, who manipulate rocks and soil... in a friggin' MINE. And the pseudo-Buddhist Aang apparently has no problem with COLD-BLOODEDLY KILLING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. Was Shyamalan mocking us with how bad he could make this, or did he just not care?I will give Dev Patel credit -- even though his Zuko's main source of angst seems to be a mild case of eczema, he does put a lot of passion and intensity into the role.Sadly, the same cannot be said of the other actors. Aang is wooden and mopey, Katara is weepy and inept, and Sokka comes across as a ticking time bomb. Even the talented Shaun Toub plays the horrendously-written role of Iroh with an air of boredom -- he always looks like he's thinking, ""Okay, when do I get paid?"" Only Aasif Mandvi seems to be having fun chewing the scenery.M. Night Shyamalan managed something truly impressive in ""The Last Airbender"" -- he managed to take a funny, well-written, intelligent series and suck out all the humor, cleverness and likability from it.",1,Wroong,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,3269,"['are', 'good', 'adaptations', 'are', 'bad', 'adaptations', 'are', 'adaptations', 'rip', 'asunder', 'source', 'material', 'gleefully', 'devour', 'corpse.This', 'one', 'last', 'category.I', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'had', 'merely', 'had', 'special', 'effects', 'horrible', 'script', 'actors', 'charisma', 'plank', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'EVERYTHING', 'ELSE', 'wrong', 'too', 'character', 'motivations', 'bending.Southern', 'Water', 'Tribe', 'girl', 'Katara', 'brother', 'Sokka', 'stumble', 'glowing', 'glacier', 'find', 'young', 'Airbender', 'boy', 'inside', 'other', 'Airbenders', 'are', 'dead', 'Katara', 'out', 'Aang', 'Avatar', 'master', 'four', 'elements', 'only', 'person', 'world', 'who', 'can', 'defeat', 'powerful', 'Fire', 'Nation.However', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'already', 'found', 'form', 'disgraced', 'Prince', 'Zuko', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Aang', 'Sokka', 'Katara', 'set', 'out', 'perilous', 'voyage', 'North', 'Pole', 'find', 'waterbending', 'master', 'malevolent', 'Admiral', 'Zhao', 'Zuko', 'nemesis', 'approaching', 'North', 'Pole', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'navy', 'plan', 'may', 'destroy', 'all.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'had', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'original', 'cartoon', 'was', 'intelligent', 'funny', 'complex', 'filled', 'brilliant', 'martial-arts', 'strong', 'philosophical', 'overtones', 'So', 'instead', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'NONE', 'witless', 'humorless', 'simplistic', 'stumbling', 'behemoth', 'film.The', 'culture', 'characters', 'climactic', 'battle', 'bending', 'acting', 'action', 'sequences', 'even', 'pronunciation', 'names', 'EVERYTHING', 'WRONG', 'WRONG', 'WRONG', 'WRONG', 'listed', 'everything', 'wrong', 'movie', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'size', 'novel.Even', 'objective', 'perspective', 'movie', 'disaster', 'Shyamalan', 'clearly', 'idea', 'how', 'write', 'action', 'movie', 'blasting', 'incoherent', 'fight', 'scenes', 'one', 'long', 'pan', 'story', 'feels', 'painfully', 'repetitive', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Aang', 'going', 'be', 'captured', 'script', 'horrendously', 'pompous', 'humorless', 'rushed', 'have', 'show', 'believe', 'beliefs', 'as', 'much', 'believe', 'theirs', 'WHAT', ""'re"", 'not', 'trying', 'SAVE', 'THE', 'WORLD', '.Also', 'are', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'three-year-old', 'can', 'spot', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'imprisons', 'Earthbenders', 'who', 'manipulate', 'rocks', 'soil', 'friggin', 'MINE', 'pseudo-Buddhist', 'Aang', 'apparently', 'problem', 'COLD-BLOODEDLY', 'KILLING', 'HUNDREDS', 'OF', 'PEOPLE', 'Was', 'Shyamalan', 'mocking', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'make', 'did', 'just', 'not', 'care', 'will', 'give', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'credit', 'even', 'Zuko', 'main', 'source', 'angst', 'be', 'mild', 'case', 'eczema', 'put', 'lot', 'passion', 'intensity', 'role.Sadly', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'actors', 'Aang', 'wooden', 'mopey', 'Katara', 'weepy', 'inept', 'Sokka', 'across', 'ticking', 'time', 'bomb', 'Even', 'talented', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'horrendously-written', 'role', 'Iroh', 'air', 'boredom', 'always', 'thinking', 'Okay', 'when', 'do', 'get', 'paid', 'Only', 'Aasif', 'Mandvi', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'chewing', 'scenery.M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'managed', 'something', 'truly', 'impressive', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'managed', 'take', 'funny', 'well-written', 'intelligent', 'series', 'suck', 'out', 'humor', 'cleverness', 'likability']",The Last Airbender

It is not in my habit to comment much on the films of Shyamalan, though one day of course I'll review them all.After that disclaimer, I have to say I was charmed enough by AIRBENDER to sit through it and enjoy. The young actors are cute and well disciplined; the older ones are impressive considering the film they find themselves serving.In this film we are introduced to ""benders""- vaguely Chinese/Tibetan/Norse/Lapp/Eskimo tribes scattered around some mythical world. Each tribe has total power over an element (hence the ""bending""): water, earth, air, fire (and I guess metal was missing). The young water-bender is a charming girl who struck me as a Lapp, and her lovely older brother is very funny.Into this frozen land where they live (was that Greenland?) comes the last air-bender, a goofy little kid who looks like a Shao-lin priest. I'll say right now, I am utterly sick of true history being pillaged then misrepresented by the movies. But then, there is my original disclaimer so I'll leave it at that.A war of elements is at hand, and the last air-bender is also The Avatar. Based on the Buddhist tradition's 'messiah', he is supposed to bring balance to the force, oops, wrong movie, something like that anyway.One major pet peeve of mine is this reeling in an audience, only to find that at the end of the film it's half or a third of the way through the whole story. What if something happens, they make no sequel, audiences rebel? What if we suddenly become theater-seat-benders and whack the silver screen out of existence just to teach M. Knight a lesson?As a very decrepit old ""fan boy"", I can relate to those who are addicted to the books, the tv cartoon and whatever else was ground out of that neo-Disneyesque anime factory. I am no fan of anime, since I sort of grew up on the original anime-type of garbage. I also don't care too much for tv cartoons. (Except SpongeBob, his first couple of seasons are funny.) So I will never understand the immature, rabid criticism or beloved adoration I see directed at this film- or at any other cartoon-to-film adaptation. All I want to know is when will it stop!!Film, to me, is film. It isn't anime, it isn't American cartooning, it isn't a tv show. This film, however, should have been done on tv. Oh wait, it already was. How redundant.Well, this was fun enough, and it tries in a feeble way to teach compassion- I suppose there's a hidden environmental agenda here too. My wife saw this film fresh off the silver screen and she said it was ""stupid"". Therefore I had to see it.It isn't stupid. It is a Nickelodeon movie, and would have been much more fun to see as-is on television. Shyamalan has nothing better to do I suppose, so there's his direction as a negligible inducement. He does well enough- I can only add that it is worth seeing for the effects and phony-baloney martial arts which still look quite elegant.Just don't try any of their tricks at home (well, splashing bath water is OK).By the way, only in America is ""Ang"" or ""Aang"" pronounced ""aing"" or whatever it is that I see is bugging people. Everywhere on earth where people use ANG/AANG as a name it is pronounced the way it is pronounced in this film.

I was a fan of the cartoon and I only had one or two gripes about this movie and they are very small ones.Yes, they decided to pronounce Aang's name as it should have been like Ohng. They DID change Sokka's name too pronouncing it with a long O which was a little annoying.Fine, General Iroh was a thin, dark haired man and in the cartoon he was fat and white haired.These are all very minor changes that do not rate a 1-2 star movie.I have read that the Fire benders could not make their own fire and could only manipulate fire that was already lit. OK!! Think about it. Earth benders do NOT make earth. They bend it. Water benders bend water, not make it and the same thing is with the Air benders. Why would Fire benders be any different? There is 1 point where a strong Fire bender creates fire and scares his own people which I thought was a cool moment.I have read reviews saying there was very poor acting. I do not agree. I felt it was acted pretty well.I have also read reviews complaining of ""dancing"" rather than the quick gesture bending? This is also false. The only time there is any dancing type bending is when Aang must do something truly amazing and it takes more concentration.Special effects were very well done as well.I do recommend this movie for any fans that can see it for what it was. I felt they corrected some inconsistancies from the cartoon.This is book 1: Water. Be prepared. They tell you in the movie that the comet will come in 3 yrs and that is when the Fire benders will be more powerful and the big battle will take place so there are no surprises here that it will be 3-4 movies. If you know the cartoon, this is no surprise as well.Special features: There are many special features such as many behind the scenes and gag reels.

Artificial Intelligence"" in 2001 have I heard such hatred heaped upon a director and his film as with Shyamalan's much anticipated ""The Last Airbender"".  If the gods seek to destroy those they once called promising, perhaps that is so with Mr. Shyamalan.  The critics, who once called him the next Spielberg, now scorn and dismiss him.  These self-appointed lesser gods, who have never made movies themselves, have the power to destroy those who do.  Their influence over audiences and ticket sales is without doubt, so it is not surprising that Sony invented a phony movie critic called ""David Manning"" in 2001 to write favorable reviews of its films.  Well, I liked this film, and I have never made a movie, either.Everything I knew, in fact, I learned from the publicity.  I didn't expect the movie to be great, I'd hoped it would be good, but it wasn't as bad as these critics say.  I departed with a hunger to learn more.  As a newbie to the story, though, and I am not the only one, perhaps I should not have had to ferret it out on my own, as I had to do with the puzzle of Spielberg's ""A.I.""  But I like to do research.After I viewed some episodes on Amazon and learned more, I have become a fan.  The cartoon series, much beloved by its fans, is a good story.  I expect to purchase the DVD sets.  I saw the movie again and enjoyed it much better, though I still had quibbles about it.  There were a few times when I imagined how I might write, direct, frame, or shoot a scene to make it different or more powerful.  For example, in the climactic scene, when Aang reaches deep into his memories and emotions before facing the Fire Nation navy, I would've made his reaction more cathartic, his battle less effortless.  I do that with movies, sometimes.  This is not to say my vision is better or that is the way it should've been done, just what I might have done.  I don't make movies.I liked the premise of the story, which some critics misunderstood, and I liked the visual majesty of it.  It's properly targeted at and safe for kids.  I liked the fantasy world, the martial arts work, and Mr. Shyamalan's vision of it.  It was clean, escapist entertainment.If the dialogue and story changes sound cartoonish, well, a cartoon was its source, right?  I guess some have forgotten the cartoonish dialogue, non sequitur scenes, and sorry acting in ""Star Wars"".  I guess some expected a word-for-word, scene-for-scene, blow-by-blow replication of the cartoon series first season of 20 episodes.  They got a stripped-down adaptation in 103 minutes that condenses or overlooks a lot.  That is not unusual.  Whenever a film is adapted from another source, such as, a book or play, it's a palimpsest from the original, and there are always changes, compromises.  Those fans and others should get a life.  I agree, though, that 15 to 30 minutes of film time must be missing.  Perhaps they should've planned for more than three movies or filmed the trilogy all at once.  It's too bad Mr. Shyamalan has disappointed some very vocal fans, but there it is--a strategic fault that the directors of ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" were cognizant to avoid.The cast is ok and so is their understated acting, considering the source.  Noah Ringer is the martial arts prodigy hired to play Aang, the character he strongly resembles, the reincarnation of the avatar, the spiritual savior who can control all the elements to keep them in balance.  I don't like to discuss child actors.  But think about it: a $150M movie rests on the shoulders of an inexperienced 12 year old.  He is not the first child actor to have to learn his acting craft on-the-job.  So, cut the kid some slack, folks.  Noah has his chops now.  We felt he was very good, some of his martial arts were graceful, even beautiful to watch, self-possessed and controlled, and we hope he will reprise his role if sequels are made.Some think Mr. Shyamalan has ruined the film and his career.  I don't think so.  As a person of color, too, I found no issue or challenge with it.  The audience applauded after both showings that I saw.  However, I wonder if Nickelodeon, who hoped the property would become their ""Harry Potter"", agrees.To date, I have seen ""The Last Airbender"" three times.  I expect to see it again tomorrow.  I like the film enough to give it a fair and just rating.  To borrow from Admiral Farragut, ""Damn the critics!  Full steam ahead!""  When Kubrick's famous film, ""2001"", opened in 1968, the critics savagely dismissed it and its director; so, never mind them.  I conclude by echoing one of the other commentators here.  Thank you, Mr. Shyamalan, for making this film, but please make the sequels great.",4,Remember It's Only A Movie,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,4717,"['Not', 'Spielberg', 'A.I', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', '2001', 'have', 'heard', 'such', 'hatred', 'heaped', 'director', 'film', 'Shyamalan', 'much', 'anticipated', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'gods', 'seek', 'destroy', 'once', 'called', 'promising', 'perhaps', 'so', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'critics', 'who', 'once', 'called', 'next', 'Spielberg', 'now', 'scorn', 'dismiss', 'self-appointed', 'lesser', 'gods', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'made', 'movies', 'have', 'power', 'destroy', 'who', 'do', 'Their', 'influence', 'audiences', 'ticket', 'sales', 'doubt', 'not', 'surprising', 'Sony', 'invented', 'phony', 'movie', 'critic', 'called', 'David', 'Manning', '2001', 'write', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'films', 'Well', 'liked', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'made', 'movie', 'either.Everything', 'knew', 'fact', 'learned', 'publicity', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'great', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'say', 'departed', 'hunger', 'learn', 'more', 'newbie', 'story', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'perhaps', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'ferret', 'out', 'own', 'had', 'do', 'puzzle', 'Spielberg', 'A.I', 'like', 'do', 'research.After', 'viewed', 'episodes', 'Amazon', 'learned', 'more', 'have', 'become', 'fan', 'cartoon', 'series', 'much', 'beloved', 'fans', 'good', 'story', 'expect', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'sets', 'saw', 'movie', 'again', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'better', 'still', 'had', 'quibbles', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'imagined', 'how', 'might', 'write', 'direct', 'frame', 'shoot', 'scene', 'make', 'different', 'more', 'powerful', 'example', 'climactic', 'scene', 'when', 'Aang', 'deep', 'memories', 'emotions', 'facing', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'navy', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'reaction', 'more', 'cathartic', 'battle', 'less', 'effortless', 'do', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'not', 'say', 'vision', 'better', 'way', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'just', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies.I', 'liked', 'premise', 'story', 'critics', 'misunderstood', 'liked', 'visual', 'majesty', 'properly', 'targeted', 'safe', 'kids', 'liked', 'fantasy', 'world', 'martial', 'arts', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'vision', 'was', 'clean', 'escapist', 'entertainment.If', 'dialogue', 'story', 'changes', 'sound', 'cartoonish', 'well', 'cartoon', 'was', 'source', 'right', 'guess', 'have', 'forgotten', 'cartoonish', 'dialogue', 'non', 'sequitur', 'scenes', 'sorry', 'acting', 'Star', 'Wars', 'guess', 'expected', 'word-for-word', 'scene-for-scene', 'blow-by-blow', 'replication', 'cartoon', 'series', 'first', 'season', '20', 'episodes', 'got', 'stripped-down', 'adaptation', '103', 'minutes', 'lot', 'not', 'unusual', 'Whenever', 'film', 'adapted', 'source', 'such', 'book', 'play', 'palimpsest', 'original', 'are', 'always', 'changes', 'compromises', 'fans', 'others', 'should', 'get', 'life', 'agree', 'though', '15', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'time', 'must', 'be', 'missing', 'Perhaps', 'should', ""'ve"", 'planned', 'more', 'three', 'movies', 'filmed', 'trilogy', 'once', 'too', 'bad', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'disappointed', 'very', 'vocal', 'fans', 'strategic', 'fault', 'directors', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'were', 'cognizant', 'avoid.The', 'cast', 'ok', 'so', 'understated', 'acting', 'considering', 'source', 'Noah', 'Ringer', 'martial', 'arts', 'prodigy', 'hired', 'play', 'Aang', 'character', 'strongly', 'reincarnation', 'avatar', 'spiritual', 'savior', 'who', 'can', 'control', 'elements', 'keep', 'balance', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'discuss', 'child', 'actors', 'think', '150M', 'movie', 'rests', 'shoulders', 'inexperienced', '12', 'year', 'old', 'not', 'first', 'child', 'actor', 'have', 'learn', 'acting', 'craft', 'on-the-job', 'So', 'cut', 'kid', 'slack', 'folks', 'Noah', 'chops', 'now', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'martial', 'arts', 'were', 'graceful', 'even', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'self-possessed', 'controlled', 'hope', 'will', 'reprise', 'role', 'sequels', 'are', 'made.Some', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'ruined', 'film', 'career', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'person', 'color', 'too', 'found', 'issue', 'challenge', 'audience', 'applauded', 'showings', 'saw', 'However', 'wonder', 'Nickelodeon', 'who', 'hoped', 'property', 'would', 'become', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'agrees.To', 'date', 'have', 'seen', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'three', 'times', 'expect', 'see', 'again', 'tomorrow', 'film', 'enough', 'give', 'fair', 'just', 'rating', 'borrow', 'Admiral', 'Farragut', 'Damn', 'critics', 'Full', 'steam', 'ahead', 'When', 'Kubrick', 'famous', 'film', '2001', 'opened', '1968', 'critics', 'savagely', 'dismissed', 'director', 'so', 'never', 'mind', 'conclude', 'echoing', 'one', 'other', 'commentators', 'here', 'Thank', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'making', 'film', 'please', 'make', 'sequels', 'great']",The Last Airbender

While I am a devoted fan to the television series, it wasn't necessarily the bastardization of the storyline that made me dislike this movie. I can fully understand why the director might have found it difficult to condense the entire first volume of the anime into one single film. Actually, it was the acting and the style in which the movie was filmed that I found myself hating the most.First off, the 'Ung' sound of Aang's name was just something I could not get over. Every time I heard it, I had to remind myself that the actors were referring to a person and not just making some kind of grunting sound.Second, would it have been so difficult for the director to find a seasoned actor with martial arts training to play Aang. Every time that kid talked, it was like watching the very first harry potter movie (you know, when they were barely tweens and still learning how to act).Third, why did the camera repeatedly do close-ups. I had heard of this from a friend, but until I watched the movie I didn't really understand what they meant. Bascially, when one of the characters give one of their many speeches, the camera moves so close that all you see if the very middle of their face. Sometimes even the chin and top-most part of their forehead is off screen. I'm sorry, but I can't watch a movie where half the time the camera is doing close-ups. By the end of the movie I was yelling for the cameraman to LAY OFF THE ZOOM.I also agree with a lot of other reviews on this website, I would look forward to someone else creating a worthy adaptation of the television show. Directors are doing remakes and adaptations all the time from foreign films and books, it just seems disappointing that the director didn't take notes on previous attempts. Heck, even the simpsons movies found a way to be decent. Maybe the director should have done a continuation of the series, used his own creativity.

Someone could have kicked your butt the old fashioed way before they had the time to perform a bending move. We wanted to like this film, we really did.

1295709,A10E0IZ8TY5XRR,B002VPE1BQ,Jaelin B.,"[8, 11]","This movie had so, so much potential to be good. Unfortunately, it fails not only to live up to the expectations of fans of the series, but also fails to stand on its own as a standalone film. I actually rather like M. Night Shymalan's movies, even the ones that most people hated like ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Village"". From beginning to end, however, this movie was just plain awful.My biggest problem with this movie is simply that Mr. Shyamalan took an entire season of a very well fleshed-out and developed series, set in a world that doesn't work quite like the real one, with what are very complicated cultural and political structures going on, and tried to jam it into less than two hours of time. The result is film with a barely-coherent story, dialogue that is composed almost entirely of exposition, and not enough time spent with any of the characters to care what happens to them. Had I not seen the series this movie was based upon, this movie would have seemed like a string of completely unrelated events. Having seen the series and being a fan, it was painful to see vibrant and well-developed characters reduced to blank-stared, in-story narrators.Even the visual effects and action scenes fell short for me. In an attempt to showcase the element-bending effects, the battle scenes featured heavy use of slow-motion. Rather than make the bending more impressive, it just sucked every last bit of excitement out of the action. A movie with nature-element superpowers and lots of nifty martial-arts type moves should not come off feeling sluggish. I wonder how much time would have been shaved off from the overall length of the film had they run the battles at normal speed.The acting was painful, although I'm not sure I can fault the actors. When most of your dialogue is narration, there isn't much you can do with that. The only character that didn't come off as awkward and stilted in his delivery was Dev Patel as Prince Zuko. Zuko was the only character that really got any attention in the script to his background or personality. Unfortunately, one decently-portrayed character had no chance of salvaging this disaster of a movie.I really can look past the usual complaints about this movie regarding casting the main protagonists as Caucasian, while casting Fire Nation antagonists as primarily actors with Indian or Middle-Eastern appearances (I expect that predictable sort of shennanigans from Hollywood, really), and I don't care about the changes in name pronunciations (although I don't think the argument that ""that would be the proper pronunciation in most Asian languages"" is particularly convincing considering that in this adaptation the characters whose names were affected are decidedly not Asian).For me, this movie failed in story, in dialogue, in pace, and in visuals.

1295711,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,B002VPE1BQ,James Duckett,"[9, 15]","I loved the show and this is the movie I've been looking forward to more than any other.  In the end, it is a huge disappointment but it did have some small redeeming qualities, but not enough of them.  I'll start with what I liked:1) Sound Track.  I usually don't point this out, but I was actually digging on the sound track of the show, all except for one scene (the music built up but nothing happened on the screen).2) Added plot elements.  They added a few plot elements, some I liked and some I didn't.  The one I liked was that the movie seemed to focus on building a balance throughout the world instead of, ""I'm the Avatar so I'm just going to destroy what gets in my way,"" like what the show seemed to say.  I liked it, it added a little bit of depth to the roll of the Avatar.3) Special Effects.  I especially loved the special effects of the water and the fire.  The air and the earth bending effects sometimes came across as silly.But there were too many negatives:1) Too short.  The show was several hours long in the first book but this movie was less than two hours.  I think the movie would have been a lot more decent if Shyamalan had put more into character development, relationship building, and story.  Unfortunately, all he could cram into roughly 105 minutes where all the action scenes, which is not why Avatar was so beloved.  It wouldn't have cost him much more to add the character development and it is so unfortunate that he took a skip on it.2) Added plot elements. So, Aang is not allowed to have a family since he is the Avatar.  What?  Why was this added into the movie?  In the show other Avatars were shown with family.  In fact, since he is the last airbender he really SHOULD create a family so that the Airbender Nomads can be re-formed.  Was this something that Shyamalan had planned on revisiting in the future?  For now, I just don't get it.3) 3D.  I knew I wasn't going to like the 3D as soon as I had heard it was done post-production.  I should have followed my instinct and just caught the 2D version.  The 3D version is dark with very little life in the colors.  In fact, many scenes I removed the glasses just so I could enjoy the (blurry) scenes that were filmed.  If Shyamalan continues making this in 3D, I hope he shoots it in 3D instead of doing it afterward.4) No character development and relationship building.  A real shame as this is what made the show so wonderful.  But Aang doesn't even seem to get along with Katara and Sokka.  In fact, if I hadn't seen the show, I think I would wonder why two kids where helping out the Avatar to begin with, or why the Avatar would even have them along.5) Names.  I don't know why, but many of the names were re-pronounced for the movie, often times replacing hard vowels with soft ones.  Aang sounded more like Ung.  They didn't even say the word Avatar right.  Was this a copyright issue?  I can't figure out why this happened.6) Poor editing.  This is a roller-coaster of a ride as locations and plot lines seemed to be thrown at us at 100 miles per hour.  This is not a compliment.  If I hadn't seen the show I know I wouldn't be able to keep up.  Again, transitions could have been helped along with the character and even plot building.In the end, it is more bad than good.  It is a poorly executed movie and I expected more from Shyamalan.  If you where a fan of the show I'd suggest you wait until it comes out as a rental... a Netflix rental at that.  If you didn't watch the show I would avoid this movie like the plague.  In fact, do yourself a favor and watch the show.  The special effects weren't fantastic but everything else is FANTASTIC!No matter what, I'd suggest skipping on the 3D version.

1295713,AQNYGIYW2W6O,B002VPE1BQ,jarredbyitall,"[13, 28]","In brief:  This is a deeply moving, spiritual fantasy film that differs in some ways from the cartoon series on which it's based. Understand going in that it's a condensed version of 20 episodes and, as such, there were changes to be made.  Any rational person could see that would be necessary.  Even the creators of this series, who mixed both Western and Eastern story-telling elements, knew and approved of these changes. Many of these changes are for the better and deepen the flow, reality and, ultimately, the heart of the film. If you re-watch the first season you can see where M. Night took the heart of the episodes and crafted an even better and emotion-filled core and ending for this series.Many of those who rallied against this film fall into one major category - obsessed fan-boys with no sense of perspective.  They are a heartless bunch. Many of them even got tied up in the race of the characters - characters voiced by white actors in the cartoon, a cartoon which was created by two white dudes, and animated in style that mixes both Eastern and Western animation styles. This is a fantasy world people!  And even so,  M. Night took the most inclusive approach possible and said, hey let's show as many races as we can - we can have Asians, Whites, Blacks and Indians in this fantasy world.  But no. The fanboys got offended and started an internet-based political movement against this film: the so-called race-bending controversy.  In doing so, these fanboys became the very thing they accused the filmmakers being: flat-out racists. Racism is when you don't accept someone for the color of their skin.  They couldn't accept Indian firebenders or white waterbenders.  Who are the real racists here?  All told, they've shown themselves to be as a whole a group of heartless, nit-picking navel-gazers, lacking the souls necessary to really appreciate this great film. They've flooded the internet with hate.  They won't stop.  Even now, months after the film's release, they post on message-boards (and here on Amazon) just to tell you how much they hate it. Who does that?  They don't want to see a sequel - by any means necessary.I for one want a sequel - badly.  The film made over $315 million world-wide.  Apparently, I'm not the only one who wants a sequel.I love the show and I love this movie. Both have a place in my heart. I guess I root for the underdog and when so many critics rag on a film you have to take a step back and wonder what's really going on.  This film made over $315 million worldwide, so there's hope for a sequel. I for one don't really get all of the hate.  What film did the critics see? It seems to me like there was a studio-driven campaign against this movie to fail. Maybe one lead by FOX who put out the other Avatar in name? There was a massive media blitz against this film. Can you think of any other film with so much hate directed against it?  Think about that for a moment. Can you?All of the so-called super-fans of the TV show need to relax. There is no way that they could show all of the countless characters and locations that are in season one in one movie. Think of all the stuff that gets cut of of a Harry Potter novel for just one film - 2 films for one book doesn't make it twice as good. Realistically, how many movies should they have made just about season one?  Even if you did two for season one, you'd have no story arc.  It wouldn't have been as satisfying.  The movie and main character had a great emotional arc, in my opinion.  This was also a more thoughtful film than critics would have you believe.  I bought it on DVD.  I have all of the Avatar Season Box sets as well.  Changes were made for the sake of a movie, but overall it was an enjoyable ride.  Don't listen to the critics.  Judge for yourself.  Stop the hate.Noah Ringer is Aang.  Shaun Toub was amazing as Uncle Iroh.  Devel Patel was terrific as Zuko.  The special effects were great.  The score was beautiful.  The story had great emotion and moved me.  M. Night did a great job.  Bring on Books Two and Three.",5,Loved it.

No way that's the movie.  With that said, here's my review of the ""movie.""The plot is borderline incomprehensible.  I guess that's the result of condensing a 20-episode series into a 90 minute movie.  In some ways it's like taking the entire contents of my refrigerator and creating a giant smoothie.  After each I want to vomit.  Anyway, two kids are hanging out in the South Pole when they find an iceberg.  Despite the ability to ""bend"" all elements (including water), the kid inside has been imprisoned, in ice!, for an insignificant period of time.  5318008 or 8675309 years.  I'm not completely sure, and I don't care.  Bada-boom, bada-bing, in walks roughly 200 unconnected, supporting actors/characters, some logorrhea about powers and spirits, enough FX to make Michael Bay moist, and an open-ended finale portending a sequel that, if made, will undoubtedly be used during the torture scenes of anyZero Dark Thirtyfollow-ups.  Let's hope Ebert is right and the ""title proves prophetic.""Some of the dialogue is so wooden I was convinced Kristen Stewart would make a cameo.  And don't even get me started on the expository nature of nearly every.single.word.  Dora the Explorer provides fewer clues.  The laughable acting and casting certainly doesn't help.  There is no subtlety.  No nuance.  When a character is angry, it's all foot-stomping, furrowed brows, Charlie Chaplin exaggeration - sorry, Charlie - in an effort to explain what the plot and dialogue cannot.  It's kind of like watching a baby cry, not knowing what exactly is wrong, then smelling poop.  Actually, it's almost exactly like that.  To be quite honest, aside from Shaun Toub, the best performance of the film goes to the CGI dragon.  And Dev Patel as a villain?  I've seen more menacing figures on cereal boxes.The only redeeming aspect to this film is the FX.  It's decent when everything else doesn't suck so bad.

Why in the heck did he change Angg name to Ung? Did anyone involved with this even bother to watch the show first? Now for the acting not horrible but there are better child actors out there. Unfortunately even the best actors couldn't work with the horrid script m night wrote. I don't know about anyone else but I like to watch movies where the director/writer does not force feed me info tell me once I swear I will remember. The library that's mentioned in this movie 3 xs was mentioned once in the cartoon. But I think what hurts this movie the most is its 107min run time. The cartoon had a run time of 489min and I know some things had to be cut. The truth is this movie should have run at least 150min with a 180min directors cut. Due to the limited time many IMPORTANT elements to the story simple were not told. For instance Appa is barely mentioned in the movie but in the cartoon he is loved character. In book 2 of the cartoon Appa is taken and Angg damn near kills the people who took him because he was so upset about it. How did m night plan to show that emotion when in his movie Appa is nothing more than a means of transportation? And then the Keoshi warriors very important characters in the show that are not even mentioned in the movie!! Why??

1295716,A1FEITLECMZ6EW,B002VPE1BQ,Jeffrey Thomas,"[1, 3]","Ok, after just finishing watching this, I find the movie very much off from the series in several points. Personally, I think this movie needed more homework done on different things. Sokka is not said like So-ka it's said like Sah-ka. Also, Aang is said with the ""A"" sound in the beginning. Agni Ki is not said like Agni Key the ""I"" is emphasized at the end of Ki. Oh, Ki might be spelled Kai, sorry. Anyway, passing spelling errors. A lot of this was a jumble. I also found the guy who played Zhao bad because all he did was act whimpy, or something, in parts. Maybe that's not the right word. Anyways, he was this skimpy dude dressed in armor as an Admiral. In the series he was this really fit dude that actually could intimidate people. I had zero intimidation coming from that guy who played Zhao. I can live with Iroh, he had the attitude down. However, I'll admit that the guy who played him should've been fatter. However, the way the actor did things and looked I think he fit the bill. The fatness can be left on the side. Also, the avatar state, and meditation, seriously, they should've done that better. Not once, in the entire series, did Aang talk to a dragon. Considering the language problem this was an issue. The closest relation to such an event in the series was when Aang learned to fire-bend from the dragons of the sun-warriors. Or at least, understand better about fire-bending. It was a little complicated to explain.Moving on. The jumble of bound together events in the movie really was strange. Especially how, at times, they would randomly add in an event that didn't happen in the series, or something. The posters considering the Avatar were not helped to be posted by Katara even once in the series. Also, Aang did not randomly skip around saving Earth villages, they didn't have time for that. Better yet, they screwed with the deadline of the comet. Aang didn't combine with the Ocean spirit for an awesome Avatar state to, which is really sad. Aang first avatar state was not at the air temple but around Zuko's ship. There are several instances to list. However, I think one of the most frustrating to me was the ending. For one, before getting to the scene before Azula, the fire-bending that fire-benders could do in the series they couldn't do any longer here. Anyone else think this is stupid? It takes away from the comet for one. I mean, why have Iroh be able to do it, and Zuko also, and not have all the other fire-benders use it like this? Anyway, getting to the end scene, before the talk between Azula and Ozai (the Fire Lord), everyone just bows down before Aang, including fire nation people. Anyone else see a problem with that? Everyone bows down. I can understand allies, but all the fire nation people to? Come on.Also, to list one thing that really got to me when watching the end, ""will Aang please do something with the gigantic wave please?"" Anyone else get that reaction. You go through the horrendous clumped up thing that is this so-called remake of the series, or at least part of it, and you end up at that scene, which is supposedly when he is supposed to be in the avatar state at the Northern Water Tribe, and he just builds a wave and holds it up for a while. Yeah, it's intimidating to the fire nation soldiers, but can you move it please? He built a big wave, SO WHAT! In the series, Aang was not the only water bender who could do something like that. I love the dragon's comment (sarcasm), ""teach them the true meaning of water bending,"" or something like that. ""Hey, script writer? I'd like to inform you that water benders have been bending water really well for a long long time. Thank you. Please watch the original series now."" Besides, take out the dragon speaking to Aang, Aang wasn't talked to by the dragon in the series, he was talked to by Avatar Roku; and Roku wasn't talking about all the things that dragon was. Please, script writer and director, and other people, please try harder. I'm guessing someone watched the series as they got the basic lay-out correct. Other than that I think some people scribbled SOME things down from the original series, and some other things, and they took it from there.I don't see how the people who made this movie expect me to think, at least the main staff, the staff watched the series when this movie is not that close to the series.This is a horrible remake of the series. It's a jumble of things, some of the characters need work, this movie needs some more things in order of events, details need to be corrected in several places, and more.Really, as a start, the people making this movie needed to watch the series, because there is so much to pick on in this movie. The big wave is something that I will most definitely pick on when it comes to this movie. The jumble of events is really something I'll pick on.Oh, the saying that Aang was having trouble with water bending, in this movie, is totally false. For anyone who watched the series we know this to be true. Katara knew some water bending and Aang picked it up easily. Rack one up for another mistake. Watch the series much movie makers?Also, the earth-benders in prison were on a ship, not land. The writers made a serious mistake here because do you think putting earth-benders on land is really a great way to imprison them. All they need is a tent and they could simply go in and burrow a way out using earth-bending. Better yet, they could fight the guards and others using the very earth around them. Why they didn't follow the series I have no idea. Better yet, for even someone who didn't watch the series, how hard is it to figure that putting earth-benders on solid ground isn't going to work. I mean seriously, how much work did you guys put in this thing. I know they spent a lot of cash, but where's the effort. It shows there isn't a huge amount of effort put in when your stuff doesn't correspond with the series in several spots. Yes, I'll admit, they put in effort on effects and other things. Yes, there's no doubt a lot there. However, how hard is it to look over the scenes, compare them with the series, and see the problems?Anyway, this was a terrible remake of the series. It was painful, at times, to watch this. Please people, no sequal, I beg of you. Also, do not touch Legend of Korra. No Touch. You made a horrible remake of this movie. I don't want to see a horrible one of that series. It's painful enough with this one. It didn't take long to run into something wrong.I seriously do beg that unless someone is willing to spend as much time working on it as humanly possible to make it great, and it comes out great, neither this series nor Legend of Korra should be touched. Unless someone can make a great movie off of them it's better to leave them alone.Anyway, terrible movie, I'm sorry with all the rest of the fans that this happened. I hope it never happens again.P.S. If you haven't watched the series and you watch this movie I could see how you might enjoy it. However, if you actually watched the series and know what should be happening you know this movie was a bad remake of the series (part of the series, rather). Also, if you haven't seen the series I advise you don't choose to like or dislike this review as it would be best you knew better the series this movie was made off of before you dislike my comment. If you like my review and you haven't seen the original series, I thank you. However, I do advise you watch the series. You'll enjoy it, trust me. Also, to any adult people, watching anime isn't a bad thing. Especially if you watch this movie, know it's based off a series and choose to say something, like, or dislike, something concerning it. So, for anyone who hasn't watched the series, I strongly advise you do. Plus, with the hope they don't make a sequal, you won't get to see a close to this movie series anytime soon. So, watching the anime series you'll be able to actually see the ending, as well as the flaws in this movie. Also, I truly enjoy the anime series. Plus, I think I'd prefer to see the anime version of the ending versus this movie series ending. I really don't even want to think of watching up to two more movies over the anime series. This one was bad enough, another one or two, much to painful. Anyway, the anime version had a lot more to it and was AWESOME! So, go watch the anime series, please, you'll enjoy it, and if you watched this movie using amazon prime you can watch the anime series to using it. There are 60+ episodes at about 20 minutes per. The anime series is really fun to watch.Well, thanks for reading.Edit: I should add, looking back, that the wave at the end, wasn't just any water bending, and does make sense for an Avatar to be able to do, instead of just water benders. Whilst, with a lot of water benders together it can be done, that much water controlled by the Avatar seemed more to fit him and his description. Although, the ending still didn't make sense or work, and this film is still horrible, and a black mark on anime movies.",1,Not good enough,1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,9040,"['Ok', 'just',

1295718,A259W5KIP41XFL,B002VPE1BQ,Jennifer A. Everhart,"[3, 5]","Where do I even begin?  I just want to let you know that I began watching the Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon series ever since this film adaptation hit the big screen, and it became my absolute favorite Nickelodeon animated series of all-time.  This is thanks to high-octane action scenes, beautiful animation, creative element bending, charm, heart, humor, top-notch conflict, emotion, lovable characters, and a really thought-provoking story arc that discusses various real-life issues, all of which is ripe for expanding upon in film-making.  THERE WAS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS MOVIE TO BECOME THE COMPLETE ANTITHESIS TO WHAT THE SHOW STANDS FOR!  I mean, what happened to you, M. Night Shyamalan?  Both The Sixth Sense & Unbreakable were really solid thrillers and Signs was fun to watch despite it's faults.  After that, your writing skills deteriorated.  Granted I have yet to see The Village (despite hearing polarizing things about it and plan on updating the review once I see it), but Lady in the Water was an over-glorified bedtime story in disguise as a fantasy film and The Happening can compete with Nightmare on Elm Street 5 & 6 for craziest horror movie ever made.  However, they were the former three of Shyamalan's aforementioned directorial efforts, compared to this.  I used to think The Happening was worse, but after taking into account that it was at least trying as a horror movie and had a few interesting ideas, this became more alienating since it butchered a brilliant cartoon and didn't even try.  It's such a shame because he really was looking forward to making a film adaptation of this show after watching it with his family, as seen in an interview with him and the show's creators in the Season 2 box set, but the action genre was new to him and I heard a rumor that the producers rushed him.  However, I don't know who was truly at fault for this film's tasteless quality.  Like everyone else pointed out, it completely disregarded what made the show so special and instead suffered from a rushed ""chess-piece"" plot, lifeless direction, lack of character & emotional development, awkward acting (for the most part), sluggish action scenes & bending, the idea of taking a 20-episode season and adapting it into a 108-minute motion picture (resulting in excessive narrations of key plot points), cleaner cinematography than the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy, cheap 3D post-conversion, getting the races of some characters mixed up, their foreign accents changing the pronunciation of certain characters' names, dumb decisions, Princess Yue's hairdo looking like a certain male reproductive system (let's just say), and sheer boredom.  I will admit that the bending effects & sets were decent on a technical level, the re-enactment of the show's opening was promising, Dev Patel, Sahun Toub, & Aasif Mandvi at least tried with what they had to work with, the best action scene was with Aang vs. Zuko in the Northern Water Tribe Village, and the James Newton Howard score was pretty cool, but that's about it.  There was nothing else I liked about it.  At the end of the day, it really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life and a complete train-wreck of a beloved cartoon.  It makes Dragonball Evolution look like The Fugitive by comparison.  I don't want to kick a dead horse, seeing as how everyone ripped it a new one, but please watch the cartoon instead.  You will be a lot happier.  If you want to know more as to why this movie blows rice ball chunks, watch the Nostalgia Critic's review.  Pretty much everything he says, I agree on.  With that said, see you later, and Legend of Korra was a huge, huge improvement over this lame-brained excuse for a movie in execution.",1,!@#$%^&*(*&^%$#/?@#$%=^&*()(*&^%$#?+%^&*(*&$#@#$%^&*,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,3720,"['Where', 'do', 'even', 'begin', 'just', 'want', 'let', 'know', 'began', 'watching', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'cartoon', 'series', 'ever', 'film', 'adaptation', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'became', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Nickelodeon', 'animated', 'series', 'all-time', 'thanks', 'high-octane', 'action', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'creative', 'element', 'bending', 'charm', 'heart', 'humor', 'top-notch', 'conflict', 'emotion', 'lovable', 'characters', 'really', 'thought-provoking', 'story', 'arc', 'various', 'real-life', 'issues', 'ripe', 'expanding', 'upon', 'film-making', 'THERE', 'WAS', 'NO', 'EXCUSE', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'TO', 'BECOME', 'THE', 'COMPLETE', 'ANTITHESIS', 'TO', 'WHAT', 'THE', 'SHOW', 'STANDS', 'mean', 'what', 'happened', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'were', 'really', 'solid', 'thrillers', 'Signs', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'faults', 'writing', 'skills', 'deteriorated', 'Granted', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Village', 'hearing', 'polarizing', 'things', 'plan', 'updating', 'review', 'once', 'see', 'Lady', 'Water', 'was', 'over-glorified', 'bedtime', 'story', 'disguise', 'fantasy', 'film', 'Happening', 'can', 'compete', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', '5', '6', 'craziest', 'horror', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'However', 'were', 'former', 'three', 'Shyamalan', 'aforementioned', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'compared', 'used', 'think', 'Happening', 'was', 'worse', 'taking', 'account', 'was', 'least', 'trying', 'horror', 'movie', 'had', 'few', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'became', 'more', 'alienating', 'butchered', 'brilliant', 'cartoon', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'such', 'shame', 'really', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'making', 'film', 'adaptation', 'show', 'watching', 'family', 'seen', 'interview', 'show', 'creators', 'Season', '2', 'box', 'set', 'action', 'genre', 'was', 'new', 'heard', 'rumor', 'producers', 'rushed', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'was', 'truly', 'fault', 'film', 'tasteless', 'quality', 'everyone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'completely', 'disregarded', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'special', 'instead', 'suffered', 'rushed', 'chess-piece', 'plot', 'lifeless', 'direction', 'lack', 'character', 'emotional', 'development', 'awkward', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'sluggish', 'action', 'scenes', 'bending', 'idea', 'taking', '20-episode', 'season', 'adapting', '108-minute', 'motion', 'picture', 'resulting', 'excessive', 'narrations', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'cleaner', 'cinematography', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Prequel', 'Trilogy', 'cheap', '3D', 'post-conversion', 'getting', 'races', 'characters', 'mixed', 'up', 'foreign', 'accents', 'changing', 'pronunciation', 'certain', 'characters', 'names', 'dumb', 'decisions', 'Princess', 'Yue', 'hairdo', 'looking', 'certain', 'male', 'reproductive', 'system', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'sheer', 'boredom', 'will', 'admit', 'bending', 'effects', 'sets', 'were', 'decent', 'technical', 'level', 're-enactment', 'show', 'opening', 'was', 'promising', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Sahun', 'Toub', 'Aasif', 'Mandvi', 'least', 'tried', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'best', 'action', 'scene', 'was', 'Aang', 'vs.', 'Zuko', 'Northern', 'Water', 'Tribe', 'Village', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'score', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'liked', 'end', 'day', 'really', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'complete', 'train-wreck', 'beloved', 'cartoon', 'Dragonball', 'Evolution', 'look', 'Fugitive', 'comparison', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'kick', 'dead', 'horse', 'seeing', 'how', 'everyone', 'ripped', 'new', 'one', 'please', 'watch', 'cartoon', 'instead', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'happier', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'why', 'movie', 'rice', 'ball', 'chunks', 'watch', 'Nostalgia', 'Critic', 'review', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'agree', 'said', 'see', 'later', 'Legend', 'Korra', 'was', 'huge', 'huge', 'improvement', 'lame-brained', 'excuse', 'movie', 'execution']",The Last Airbender

There are no name actors in the movie, and that was remarkably courageous of the director.  But the actor cast made the movie seem like a bad high school production.

Noah Ringer is perfectly cast as Aang, the Avatar and last airbender, while the movie is visually stunning and Appa the flying Bison looks just like he does in the show.But the movie doesn't work too well due to the fact that it tries to fit a whole season of the Last Airbender in just an hour and 43 minute movie and that's counting the credits because it's more like an hour and 35 minute movie. The film is so fast paced that it counts on the unnecessary narration of Katara (Nicole Peltz) to explain what's going on half the time.The movie tries hard to be a faithful adaption of the show and in many ways it is, but mostly just look wise and story wise. The movie doesn't take enough time to make us care about the characters or even enough time to make us believe that Katara and Aang have formed a great bond. Plus Appa may look very impressive but he's wasted and under-used, we only get like 3 quick glimpses of him. While Aang doesn't make as big of deal about him as he does in the show. Here, he's nothing more than just transportation.I should also mention that a lot of the acting is pretty wooden. Noah Ringer as Aang and Shaun Toub as Prince Zuko's (Dev Patel) Uncle Iroh are the only ones that really shine. Cliff Curtis as Fire Lord Ozai and Aasif Mandvi as Commander Zhao seem like they have gone to M. Night Shyamalan acting school because they are as wooden as Shymalan is when he tries to act. They have way too much to do and way too many lines because they were really bad. While I never found Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) too threatening as Prince Zuko. Patel yells a lot and barks commands but I never really took him too seriously, but sadly compared to Curtis and Mandvi, his performance isn't that bad.In all, the Last Airbender still is a decent attempt to adapt a cartoon to the big screen, in fact it's one of the better attempts. But if there's more films by some miracle, whoever directs them needs to pace himself a lot better. Because the pace is so quick that it was hard to even get into the movie or even care about what happens. It's a shame because the movie looks great and Noah Ringer was at least well cast.",3,"Pretty decent, but you're better off just watching the show",1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,2282,"['Critics', 'have', 'called', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'bomb', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'half', 'star', 'star', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Noah', 'Ringer', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Aang', 'Avatar', 'last', 'airbender', 'movie', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Appa', 'flying', 'Bison', 'just', 'show.But', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'well', 'due', 'fact', 'fit', 'whole', 'season', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'just', 'hour', '43', 'minute', 'movie', 'counting', 'credits', 'more', 'hour', '35', 'minute', 'movie', 'film', 'so', 'fast', 'paced', 'unnecessary', 'narration', 'Katara', 'Nicole', 'Peltz', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'time.The', 'movie', 'hard', 'be', 'faithful', 'adaption', 'show', 'many', 'ways', 'mostly', 'just', 'look', 'wise', 'story', 'wise', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'enough', 'time', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'even', 'enough', 'time', 'make', 'believe', 'Katara', 'Aang', 'have', 'formed', 'great', 'bond', 'Appa', 'may', 'look', 'very', 'impressive', 'wasted', 'under-used', 'only', 'get', '3', 'quick', 'glimpses', 'Aang', ""n't"", 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'about', 'show', 'Here', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'transportation.I', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'lot', 'acting', 'pretty', 'wooden', 'Noah', 'Ringer', 'Aang', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'Prince', 'Zuko', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Uncle', 'Iroh', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'really', 'shine', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Fire', 'Lord', 'Ozai', 'Aasif', 'Mandvi', 'Commander', 'Zhao', 'seem', 'have', 'gone', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'acting', 'school', 'are', 'as', 'wooden', 'Shymalan', 'when', 'act', 'have', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'lines', 'were', 'really', 'bad', 'never', 'found', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'too', 'threatening', 'Prince', 'Zuko', 'Patel', 'lot', 'barks', 'commands', 'never', 'really', 'took', 'too', 'seriously', 'sadly', 'compared', 'Curtis', 'Mandvi', 'performance', ""n't"", 'bad.In', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'still', 'decent', 'attempt', 'adapt', 'cartoon', 'big', 'screen', 'fact', 'one', 'better', 'attempts', 'more', 'films', 'miracle', 'whoever', 'pace', 'lot', 'better', 'pace', 'so', 'quick', 'was', 'hard', 'even', 'get', 'movie', 'even', 'care', 'what', 'shame', 'movie', 'great', 'Noah', 'Ringer', 'was', 'least', 'well', 'cast']",The Last Airbender

1295726,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B002VPE1BQ,J. Munyon,"[8, 19]","""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" wasn't all that well received in America; or at least not as well as it was in Eastern geography locations.  Asian's tend to have a better understanding for and tolerance of the spiritual mysticisms of Buddhism and Taoism, as well as possessing an appreciation and respect for the difference between the disciplines of Sifu Kisu martial arts, as well as respect for Asian mythology, and Asian artistic expression.  Americanization of North American people is only now becoming able to reverberate back from the intolerance of such diversity because of what happened at Pearl Harbor on December 7 of 1941.  It will take just as much time before those born and raised in America before September 11, 2001 can be softened enough from what happened to the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City; before Middle Eastern religions or disciplines can become more easily accepted by the majority in North America.No doubt it becomes pivotal for us as the viewing audience to be able to separate the significance of this movie from the Nickelodeon version rendered in manga anime.  This version with Noah Ringer in the role of Aang (the Avatar) uses real people.  ""The Last Airbender"" released July 1st of 2010 is the first of a trilogy.  It is a movie about harmony and balance; having respect, and using spiritual guidance.The Water Nation people practice the Sifu Kisu discipline of Tai Chi; and are represented by the Cardinal or leadership and initiating qualities sign of Cancer, the Fixed or focused and stability of the sign Scorpio, and the Mutable or flexibility and changeable qualities of the sign Pisces; and are known for being dreamers, emotional, imaginative, having a depth of meaning that isn't afraid of change, and their ability to soften others around them.  Their natural Spirits are the Moon and Ocean.  This being significant of course because of the nature of the characteristics of the element of water.The Earth Nation people practice the Sifu Kisu discipline of Hung Gar; and are represented by the Cardinal or leadership and initiating qualities sign of Capricorn, the Fixed or focused and stability of the sign Taurus, and the Mutable or flexibility and changeable qualities of the sign Virgo; and are known for a strong sense of duty, structure, and organization, as well as using all five senses to fully experience life in a tangible way.  This being significant of course because of the nature of the characteristics of the element of earth.The Fire Nation people practice the Sifu Kisu discipline of Northern Shaolin; and are represented by the Cardinal or leadership and initiating qualities sign of Aries, the Fixed or focused and stability of the sign Leo, and the Mutable or flexibility and changeable qualities of the sign Sagittarius; and are known for spontaneity, enthusiasm, impulsiveness, inspiration, and their sense of mission and purpose as visionaries.  This being significant of course because of the nature of the characteristics of the element of fire.The Air Nation people practice the Sifu Kisu discipline of Bagua; and are represented by the Cardinal or leadership and initiating qualities sign of Libra, the Fixed or focused and stability of the sign Aquarius, and the Mutable or flexibility and changeable qualities of the sign Gemini; and are known for being analytical, flexible, seeing the larger picture, optimism, and their ability of detachment.  Their natural spirit is the Dragon.  This being significant of course because of the nature of the characteristics of the element of air.I am fairly certain if you're steeped in staunch upbringing based upon Protestantism or Catholicism, you're not going to think much of this movie.  The order I have listed the elements in this review escaped your notice altogether because you have little capacity for understanding anything not taught within the four walls of your local church.  On the other hand if you have an open mind and an understanding that English isn't the only language spoken on the face of the planet, you will probably be able to appreciate there being a deeper significance to ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" than simple entertainment - therefore you won't be as critical about surface details such as writing; plot; a flying buffalo; or acting.

But I saw previews of this movie and thought it was cool.  I really enjoyed the elements bending scenes and for that, it's worth it.Edit: After watching almost the complete Avatar anime series, I have to agree with all the bad reviews this movie got.  Although the fight scenes were good enough in my eyes, as well as the acting, the movie just didn't plot right at all.  All of the stuff in the movie is basically from book 1 water.  I admit, they did do a pretty good job with it, but they should have made it into a trilogy like Lord of the Rings did.

1295735,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B002VPE1BQ,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 8]","Does anyone remember when the name M. Night Shyamalan generated interest for a movie rather than ridicule? It seems so long ago now, when the writer/director was being heralded as ""The Next Spielberg"" due to his successes with ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"". However, after those three initial films Shyamalan apparently misplaced his talent for writing and directing, or allowed his rise to fame to get in the way of his creativity and talent. Whatever the case may be, this once acclaimed director has been on a downward spiral career-wise for several years now, and his latest film is easily his worst yet.""The Last Airbender"" chronicles the discovery and rise to power of a young boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) who is destined to become the Avatar that will save his world in its darkest hour. However, accepting his destiny will place himself and those he loves in grave danger as two opposing forces within the dreaded Fire Nation, the despotic Commander Zhao (Aasif Mandvi) and the outcast Prince Zuko (Dev Patel), seek to eliminate this prophesied threat to their power. With time running out and the Fire Nation closing in, Aang and his fellow allies in the Water Nation must stand united or all hope will be lost.Before I go any further, please let me take a moment to say ""Thank You"" to M. Night Shyamalan for allowing myself, and everyone else unfortunate enough to have watched this dismal wannabe blockbuster, a front row seat at his career hitting rock bottom. It is an honor, after all so many of us were there when you rose to success with ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999, and now just a mere eleven years later, we're front-and-center for what could be your final bow.I must say that it has been a journey Mr. Shyamalan, and one that I wish I had abandoned years ago after the crap-tacular ""Lady in the Water"". I'm not sure what that says about me, other than I'm an apparent glutton for B-movie punishment, but I digress.So, how did this movie go wrong for not only the unlucky moviegoers (or renters as the case may be), but M. Night Shyamalan and company as well? For starters, the story is nothing more than a series of bullet points gleamed from the show's first season. I understand that when a television series is being adapted into a feature film that some distillation must occur, but come on, M. Night, show some restraint in the process.Every scene in this movie feels like someone is just marking them off a list of events from ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" season one. Resulting in nary a shred of true character development, other than Aang's increasing control of his abilities. Relationships between characters are introduced and handled as if they were merely afterthoughts, rather than being central to the story. Then there are the various character motivations, which are sketchy at best. Nothing within the movie is allowed time to breathe or develop naturally, and the film suffers miserably for it.Of course, I would be remiss not to mention the plot holes and contradictions scattered throughout the entire duration of the film via editing mishaps. Numerous times characters would refer to situations, character details, or events that either had not occurred in the film yet or the person had not learned. This was typically followed shortly thereafter by the event or knowledge being presented to the person that had just been speaking of it moments before. Which prompted me to wonder, did anyone watch this film to make sure it made sense before releasing it to the general public? I'm guessing the answer would be a ""no"".Regarding the overall failure of the story, a majority of these issues could have been avoided if M. Night had been more judicious in his pacing, editing, and plotting. Attempting to adapt an entire season of a television show into one single two hour movie, and do so without oversimplifying the story, is an impossible task.So, why is it that M. Night didn't try to break some of the events apart to make for a series of movies comprising the story of the first season? Who knows? If he had done so, then there would have been time for plot, character, and relationship developing. I'm not saying those developments would have happened, but there would have been time and perhaps a better movie as an outcome.Now, anyone that has ever seen the show ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" knows that to adapt such a show requires an abundance of visual effects work. This shouldn't have been a problem with today's technology, along with the film's sizable budget; however, something went horribly wrong along the way and the visual effects were yet another casualty of this ill-conceived, lackluster production.The most glaring issue from the visual effects aspect of the film rests with the various displays of water-bending. Every time a water effect was being employed, the water always looked too gel-like and fake. This was even more obvious if real water was shown alongside the CGI-created water, because the consistency and color between the two would be completely different. This should be Special Effects Work 101, if you are mixing a real element with a CGI one then there should not be an easily discernible difference between the two. This is simply shoddy effects work and nothing more.As a side note to how horrible the water-based effects work truly was, CG-animated water has been employed since James Cameron's ""Abyss"" in 1989. How is it that 21 years later, M. Night managed to find a visual effects house incapable of mastering something that James Cameron's crew had nearly mastered all those years ago? It's mind-boggling, isn't it?As for the other elemental powers on display, they were a mixed bag between ho-hum and decent. The fire powers looked alright, although M. Night never really let the members of the villainous Fire Nation really cut loose with them, so that was disappointing. The air powers used by Aang were standard fare, nothing groundbreaking. And the earth powers were fairly blah and typically felt overlooked in the proceedings.After seeing the various visual effects on display in this movie, one has to wonder what was done with the 150 million dollar budget this movie was granted? Did M. Night pocket most of it? Because he sure didn't use big name actors and his visuals didn't seem to show that kind of financial backing?If all of those complaints weren't enough to illustrate the horrendous nature of this movie, we now come to the actors and actresses bringing these characters to life. In his first acting role Noah Ringer semi-resembles Aang and definitely fits the wide-eyed wonder of the character; however, that's where any praise for the young man ends as his acting is often forced and amateurish. His line delivery was painful almost every single time out of the gate, and any conveying of emotions was even worse. I know this was his first acting gig, but come on, you're starring in a big budget film, try to appear to know what you're doing. Seriously, how did he make it through the casting process?The supporting roles weren't much better, despite the fact that most of them had had previous film or TV experience. Actor Dev Patel, fresh off the critically acclaimed ""Slumdog Millionaire"" should have taken a second look at the script before signing onto this epic misfire. Dev showed in his previous movie that he has definite acting chops, but his work here goes from being completely uninspired and flat to over-the-top and laughable at random. Dev made Prince Zuko seem bi-polar and at times childish, rather than a rightful heir to the throne of a nation, driven to prove himself worthy to a distant father.Actor Aasif Mandvi (TV's ""Jericho"") is comical, although I'm not sure it was intentional, as the film's primary villain Commander Zhao. I don't know if M. Night instructed Aasif to overact in virtually every scene like some cheesy, scene chewing stereotypical villain or if that was just Aasif's interpretation of the character? Whatever the case, the end result was more absurd than evil.When all is said and done, there is not much of anything to be found worthy of praise in ""The Last Airbender"" other than the fact that the movie does end. That was probably my favorite part in this movie, as it has been in several other duds before it. No matter how bad a movie gets, I can always rely on the fact that the end will eventually arrive. Sadly, with this film, that moment didn't arrive soon enough.""The Last Airbender"" is rated PG for violence.",1,M.

1295736,A387Y8UUP25MOH,B002VPE1BQ,Karen Anne Webb,"[1, 7]","OK, this is a cumulative review from a family who adored the series. The film was built around the climactic battle scene between the Fire Nation and the Northern Water Tribe. Everything else was crammed in to accommodate the film length once they'd timed the battle sequence (sorry, not something I'm saying is documented; just my feeling). The term ""mystical"" some people have used might have included *finally* getting in something about Iroh's journey to the spirit world beyond Zhao's brief mention from the series. The whole Avatar State thing got lost, and the distinctive martial arts styles used for the different bending styles (OK, some nice tai chi with Katara and Aang) really got lost: 50 different moves before you could generate fire or bend earth, for gosh sakes. Sooo Cliff Notes, and they utterly lost the sense of most of the characters, even mispronouncing names. What made the series great was sharp writing, the wonderful sense of character development and spiritual journeys that characterized even the minor characters, and the sense of real rather than hokey mysticism. Really lost was ""Soaka,"" who in the seriesis the wise-cracking non-bending comedy relief who really ultimately turns into a pretty good warrior. Iroh (although no one could out-write his part in the series or out-act Mako) did actually develop a sense of spirituality: this was the closest anyone got to the quality of the characters and dialogue from the series. Appa looks like a character from Where the Wild Things Are. And how in the world is Zhao getting back and forth to report to Ozai so fast? Did these guys learn to time-bend? Like much of Lord of the Rings, so much more could have been done with this. Of course you have to cut some things from a 10 hour, 20-part series, but the series was about character, humor, courage, relationships, and growth. The movie is mainly about special effects. Unless that's what counts with you, bag this and stream the series from Netflix.

The acting was the worst I've seen (they couldn't even manage to pronounce the characters names correctly!), the scenes were dark, lacking in color and interest, the editing was choppy and uneven, and the writing and direction were completely uninspired.The Avatar: The Last Airbender series was entertaining and fun.

1295738,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B002VPE1BQ,Kathy W,"[7, 16]","As someone who is very much into spiritualism and the concept of metaphysical energy, I had such high hopes for this movie.  Unfortunately, I was EXTREMELY disappointed.  Although the Computer Graphic Imaging was fantastic, the movie itself ran seriously short in story-line, acting, drama, etc.  There was NOTHING except CGI.  On top of all that, it ended abruptly with an ""unfinished"" feel, obviously to hang you out waiting for part 2 and possibly part 3.  With all that said, you will find the basic story-line below.  Although it could have been enough to build a good movie around, it just didn't.  I almost felt cheated having gone, not so much for the $11.00 but for the waste of my time.The movie takes place somewhere in a frozen land, I am assuming it is Tibet, high in the mountains and arctic area.  Beginning in a frozen land, we touch on the concepts of the elements of Air, Earth, Water, and Fire. (Possibly, a little pre-info blog here in the movie about energy might have helped.)  The movie explains that the Avatar was the ONLY one who could control ALL 4 elements and also the ONLY one who could talk to the Spirits (of the Spirit World).  The last airbender disappeared about 100 years ago (and is a reincarnation of himself over the years).In a place where all the fathers have gone off to war, only the children and elderly are left in the village.  As Katara (female) and Soka (male) (brother and sister, each about 18 years old) talk, they start playing with the frozen ice and find that it is glowing.  A sphere of ice emerges and Katara is compelled to bang on it.  It bursts a column of light vertically up to the sky and opens to reveal a young boy (shaved head with symbolic tattoos on him) and a large animal that looks big and fuzzy and flies.  Unfortunately, the ""bad guys"" see the column of light and take off after it.The ""bad guys"" are the Fire Nation.  Over the years, we have 4 different societies that have built up in little contained villages.  We have The Fire Nation, who seek to use the Fire element to control others and the entire earth planet.  They seem to have gone through and weeded out those who can control an element and sequestered them into certain villages and are slowly waging war across the earth area.  So far, they have only taken over small areas but are moving toward the larger ones.  We also have a group that controls the Water element, and a group that controls the Earth.  Our Last Airbender was studying with the Monks when he ran off without finishing his training and somehow became trapped in the ice for 100 years.  Meanwhile, all the Monks were killed by the Fire Nation.  Avatar learned Air bending but still has to master Earth, Water and Fire bending.  (Remember, he is the only one who will be able to do all 4.) The Fire Nation is still looking for the Avatar, not to kill him (because he will just reincarnate) but to use him to control others.Prince Suko is the legal heir to the throne of the Fire Nation, but the King (his daddy) burned his face with the fire and banished him for being ""weak"" (nice guy, huh).  He said he could not come back until he brought the Avatar in.  So, the Prince is after the Avatar.  Katara and Soka travel with the Avatar to look after him.  Katara is the most powerful water bender left so she tries to train him.  He must learn Air, Water, Earth and Fire in that order and proceeds on a journey to the villages to learn how to master the remaining elements.Like many Tibetan Monks, the Avatar is capable of going into deep meditation and he also contacts his Dragon for advice in these states.  He also finds that he must release his emotions and let them flow through him (like water flows), in order to master the Water Element.Please understand that I REALLY expected to love this movie.  It is based on good metaphysical concepts, but it did not present them in a way that would capture the interest of the audience.

1295739,A17DCPYMLXV1S4,B002VPE1BQ,Kay Shackleton,"[0, 1]","M. Night Shyamalan, most known for his huge hit film ""The Six Sense,"" has taken on the task of adapting Nickelodeon's most popular cartoon series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" to a feature film series. The first of three films to be released is entitled ""The Last Airbender."" The cartoon series on which this is based is a story of an Asian-inspired mythological world divided into cultures that are connected to one of the four elements of air, water, earth or fire.The controversy came during the casting of the film. Non-Asian actors were selected for the film and fans of the series were horrified. It is truly amazing that Hollywood would still cast Caucasians into Asian parts, and hopefully the controversy over this film will put to rest this antiquated and racist practice.None the less, the film is overall a good children's movie. The story focuses on the character Aang, an air bender. In this world some special inhabitants possess the ability ""to bend"" or manipulate one of the four elements. But Aang is the most important of his world. He is the Avatar. He is uniquely capable of bending all elements and communicating with the spirit world. With these abilities come the task of maintaining peace and balance in the world. But Aang's training was interrupted for over 100 years and when he returns to his duties the world is in the process of being enslaved by the fire nation. With the help of a water bender and her brother, Aang returns to his training while in the midst of trying to restore peace to his world.The story is a pleasant departure from Shyamalan's more adult and scary films. It should be noted that his adaptation does stray from the original series and ardent fans may disapprove.For more reviews and film industry news see Kay's articles at: [...]-Kay Shackleton is a film historian with special focus on the Silent Film Era, see her work at [...]",3,"""The Last Airbender"" a good family film despite controversial casting decisions",1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,1885,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'most', 'known', 'huge', 'hit', 'film', 'Six', 'Sense', 'taken', 'task', 'adapting', 'Nickelodeon', 'most', 'popular', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'feature', 'film', 'series', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'be', 'released', 'entitled', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'cartoon', 'series', 'based', 'story', 'Asian-inspired', 'mythological', 'world', 'divided', 'cultures', 'are', 'connected', 'one', 'four', 'elements', 'air', 'water', 'earth', 'fire.The', 'controversy', 'came', 'casting', 'film', 'Non-Asian', 'actors', 'were', 'selected', 'film', 'fans', 'series', 'were', 'horrified', 'truly', 'amazing', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'still', 'cast', 'Caucasians', 'Asian', 'parts', 'hopefully', 'controversy', 'film', 'will', 'put', 'rest', 'antiquated', 'racist', 'practice.None', 'less', 'film', 'overall', 'good', 'children', 'movie', 'story', 'character', 'Aang', 'air', 'bender', 'world', 'special', 'inhabitants', 'ability', 'bend', 'manipulate', 'one', 'four', 'elements', 'Aang', 'most', 'important', 'world', 'Avatar', 'uniquely', 'capable', 'bending', 'elements', 'communicating', 'spirit', 'world', 'abilities', 'come', 'task', 'maintaining', 'peace', 'balance', 'world', 'Aang', 'training', 'was', 'interrupted', '100', 'years', 'when', 'duties', 'world', 'process', 'being', 'enslaved', 'fire', 'nation', 'help', 'water', 'bender', 'brother', 'Aang', 'training', 'midst', 'trying', 'restore', 'peace', 'world.The', 'story', 'pleasant', 'departure', 'Shyamalan', 'more', 'adult', 'scary', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'adaptation', 'stray', 'original', 'series', 'ardent', 'fans', 'may', 'disapprove.For', 'more', 'reviews', 'film', 'industry', 'news', 'see', 'Kay', 'articles', '[', ']', '-Kay', 'Shackleton', 'film', 'historian', 'special', 'focus', 'Silent', 'Film', 'Era', 'see', 'work', '[', ']']",The Last Airbender

1295741,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B002VPE1BQ,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 13]","I had really high hopes for M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Last Airbender.""  Few films in recent years had me looking forward to their release, but ""Airbender"" had me excited from the moment I saw the sneak peek trailer awhile back.  Based on the popular ""Avatar:  The Last Airbender"" cartoon series, it appeared that this film had all of its ducks in a row.Unfortunately, ""Airbender"" didn't deliver on my expectations.Instead, it was a decent film with poor dialogue, bad acting, stiff direction, and wonderful special effects.  Shyamalan definitely dropped the ball on this film, sucking the life (or air) out of a brilliant animated program and making it a stilted live action production.The plot is easy enough to understand.  The Fire Nation has declared war on all of the other tribes, those being Water, Earth, and Air.  With the Air Nomads obliterated, the Fire Nation focuses its attention on finding the Avatar, the last Airbender who can control all of the elements and eventually bring about the demise of the Fire Nation's rule.The Avatar (Noah Ringer) has been missing for one hundred years, but is mistakenly found and awakened by Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her brother, Sokka (Jackson Rathbone).  They take him to their home, but he's quickly discovered by Prince Zuko (Dev Patel), the estranged son of Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis) who is trying to win back the favor of his father.After a quick escape, the Avatar (who's revealed his name to be Aang), gets back with Katara and Sokka and the trio begin a rebellion against the Fire Nation that draws hidden Earth and Waterbenders out of hiding.  The only problem is that Aang only knows how to bend air.  While he has the ability to bend the other elements, he hasn't learned how to do it yet.  With this in mind, the group heads to the north to meet with Master Pakku (Francis Guinan), a Waterbender who lives in one of the few places where benders openly use their powers.While training with Pakku, power-hungry Admiral Zhao (Aasif Mandvi) sets his sights on finding the Avatar before Prince Zuko does in order to finish off both Aang and the Fire Lord's son.  Who wins in the end?  Watch the film to find out.The film is loaded with wonderful special effects.  Watching earth, air, fire, and water get bent was visually stunning.  I was particularly fond of the dirt walls that the Earthbenders created.  Aang's flying friends, Appa and Momo, while having only limited screen time, are very fun to watch as well.  The scenery was created quite well, with CGI and man-made sets blending nicely.The story itself was enjoyable enough to watch as it unfolded on the screen.  As already mentioned, the acting was pretty bad, with Guinan and Shaun Tob (who portrayed Zuko's uncle, the quietly powerful Iroh) delivering the best performances overall and Peltz reciting line after poorly stilted line.  For a decent comparison, refer to Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's choppy dialogue during the romantic scenes of Episodes II and III of the Star Wars films.I did not see the film in 3-D, as it wasn't offered in my area in that format.  To be quite honest, I don't see where the 3-D gimmick would enhance the film at all.In closing, I gave ""The Last Airbender"" three stars for the fact that despite sub par acting, bad dialogue, and questionable direction, I still enjoyed the film.  I find it funny that many of the things that people panned this film for here on Amazon and on other websites are the same things that people glossed over in their glowing reviews of ""Avatar"" by James Cameron.  If I had to pick between the two films, I'd have to go with ""Airbender.""",3,"Despite The Wind Being Knocked Out Of It, It's A Decent Film",1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,3634,"['had', 'really', 'high', 'hopes', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'Few', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'had', 'looking', 'forward', 'release', 'Airbender', 'had', 'excited', 'moment', 'saw', 'sneak', 'peek', 'trailer', 'awhile', 'back', 'Based', 'popular', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'cartoon', 'series', 'appeared', 'film', 'had', 'ducks', 'row.Unfortunately', 'Airbender', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'expectations.Instead', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'acting', 'stiff', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'special', 'effects', 'Shyamalan', 'definitely', 'dropped', 'ball', 'film', 'sucking', 'life', 'air', 'brilliant', 'animated', 'program', 'making', 'stilted', 'live', 'action', 'production.The', 'plot', 'easy', 'enough', 'understand', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'declared', 'war', 'other', 'tribes', 'being', 'Water', 'Earth', 'Air', 'Air', 'Nomads', 'obliterated', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'attention', 'finding', 'Avatar', 'last', 'Airbender', 'who', 'can', 'control', 'elements', 'eventually', 'bring', 'demise', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'rule.The', 'Avatar', 'Noah', 'Ringer', 'been', 'missing', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'mistakenly', 'found', 'awakened', 'Katara', 'Nicola', 'Peltz', 'brother', 'Sokka', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'take', 'home', 'quickly', 'discovered', 'Prince', 'Zuko', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'estranged', 'son', 'Fire', 'Lord', 'Ozai', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'who', 'trying', 'win', 'back', 'favor', 'father.After', 'quick', 'escape', 'Avatar', 'who', 'revealed', 'name', 'be', 'Aang', 'back', 'Katara', 'Sokka', 'trio', 'begin', 'rebellion', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'hidden', 'Earth', 'Waterbenders', 'hiding', 'only', 'problem', 'Aang', 'only', 'how', 'bend', 'air', 'ability', 'bend', 'other', 'elements', ""n't"", 'learned', 'how', 'do', 'yet', 'mind', 'group', 'north', 'meet', 'Master', 'Pakku', 'Francis', 'Guinan', 'Waterbender', 'who', 'one', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'benders', 'openly', 'use', 'powers.While', 'training', 'Pakku', 'power-hungry', 'Admiral', 'Zhao', 'Aasif', 'Mandvi', 'sights', 'finding', 'Avatar', 'Prince', 'Zuko', 'order', 'finish', 'off', 'Aang', 'Fire', 'Lord', 'son', 'Who', 'end', 'Watch', 'film', 'find', 'out.The', 'film', 'loaded', 'wonderful', 'special', 'effects', 'Watching', 'earth', 'air', 'fire', 'water', 'get', 'bent', 'was', 'visually', 'stunning', 'was', 'particularly', 'fond', 'dirt', 'Earthbenders', 'created', 'Aang', 'flying', 'friends', 'Appa', 'Momo', 'having', 'only', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'scenery', 'was', 'created', 'quite', 'well', 'CGI', 'man-made', 'sets', 'blending', 'nicely.The', 'story', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'watch', 'unfolded', 'screen', 'already', 'mentioned', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Guinan', 'Shaun', 'Tob', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Zuko', 'uncle', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'Iroh', 'delivering', 'best', 'performances', 'overall', 'Peltz', 'reciting', 'line', 'poorly', 'stilted', 'line', 'decent', 'comparison', 'refer', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'choppy', 'dialogue', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Episodes', 'II', 'III', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films.I', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', '3-D', 'was', ""n't"", 'offered', 'area', 'format', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'where', '3-D', 'gimmick', 'would', 'enhance', 'film', 'all.In', 'closing', 'gave', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'three', 'stars', 'fact', 'sub', 'par', 'acting', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'questionable', 'direction', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'find', 'funny', 'many', 'things', 'people', 'panned', 'film', 'here', 'Amazon', 'other', 'websites', 'are', 'same', 'things', 'people', 'glossed', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'Avatar', 'James', 'Cameron', 'had', 'pick', 'two', 'films', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'Airbender']",The Last Airbender
1295742,AIRCASSWQRZDT,B002VPE1BQ,Kolwynia,"[4, 7]","Usually I wouldn't bother reviewing something that I did not find some sort of enjoyment in, but I noticed that The Last Airbender was averaging two and a half stars and that's just plain misleading to the potential victims--I mean customers.  This movie is every bit as terrible as you have heard.  If you have spent any fraction of your life watching this, I'm sorry.The cartoon this was based on, Avatar: The Last Airbender, is great.  How could such great source material be so completely squandered by a director?  I have no idea.  I actually liked M. Night Shyamalan as a director before this.  I even enjoyed a couple of his films that generally get ripped by reviewers, like The Village and Lady In The Water.  But with this film, he lost me.  I mean, was it possible that he truly did not realize just how bad a movie he was making?  I doubt it.  This feels more like someone had a franchise with a strong enough fan base that he knew the movie was going to be watched, so he just produced garbage without even trying.Some of my specific gripes with this film: First, taking Katara, a strong female character from the cartoon, and turning her into the film's Narrator.  And by Narrator, I mean the one who tells the audience what happens because the director has decided to cut out all of the traveling sequences in the film.  Expect a lot of ""We traveled to such and such a place...and then we went to...""  And that is her main role in the film.  The fact that he even needed a character to tell the audience what was happening should have been a clue to Mr. Shyamalan that he was doing something wrong.  Imagine you are watching Star Wars, and Princess Leia's only role in the movies is to give annoying voiceovers saying things like ""Then Luke found himself in the desert land of Tatooine...""  It's that bad.  And it gives the whole film a very amateur feel to it.My next big gripe is the complete disrespect the director has for the mythology of the series.  Important characters are gone from the story.  The Firebenders can't do their firebending without a pre-existing flame (a relatively small gripe, but what was the point of changing it?).  The whole Spirit World, awesome in the series, is really badly imagined in the film.  My favorite moment, just because of how bad it was: A group of imprisoned Earthbenders need rescued by our heroes.  In the cartoon, they are imprisoned in a metal prison at sea, away from any earth and rocks they could use to escape.  In the film, they are imprisoned...where earth is all around them.  But they need Aang to inspire them with one of the most uninspiring speeches ever to be delivered in a film in order for them to find the will to free themselves.I don't know what to make of the young actors in the film.  A lot of people complain about them, but they seem all right to me.  They've just been directed really badly and given an awful script is all.  Blame M. Night Shyamalan.  But their performances never get to go beyond the terrible lines of dialogue they have.  (The animated series had fun, sometimes witty dialogue.)The story has been butchered to fit an entire season of episodes into a single film.  It gives the film a feeling that it is always rushing along, never allowed to stay in a scene long enough for the scene to matter.  (Sped along by poor Katara's bad narration.)The heart of my complaint against the film is how far it is fallen from its source material.  This is worse than that Eragon movie (sorry for reopening that wound, Eragon fans).  But even if I had never seen the animated series, I would have known a bad movie when I saw it.  It moves at a pace that is too fast, relies on a Narrator to tell things it should be showing (Like when two characters fall in love, Katara's narration actually has to tell the viewer that they are falling in love.  This should never happen in any film.), and gives the viewer no real reason to love the world or its characters.The film does have decent visual effects and nice costumes, but they are not enough to make up in any way for the terrible storytelling and badly realized characters.  And the worst part is knowing what could have been.

1295743,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B002VPE1BQ,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[3, 7]","The primary Merriam-Webster definition of ""Avatar"" is: ""In Hindu Mythology, the descent of a deity to the earth in an incarnate form or some manifest shape; the incarnation of a god."" A secondary definition in the computing world is: ""A graphical image that represents a person, as on the Internet."" In short, a virtual incarnation.M. Night Shyamalan's THE LAST AIRBENDER (originally AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER) covers the first defintion. James Cameron's AVATAR covers the second definition, though Cameron managed to force Shyamalan to change his title. The truth is that Shyamalan's films are phantasmagorical, and I find them either uneasily engrossing (The Village) or uneasily boring (Lady in the Water). THE LAST AIRBENDER falls into the first category, though without the uneasiness. Never having watched the animated series, and being unfamiliar with the complex universe of Katara and Aang the last airbender, I can't say that I knew that I was missing anything in THE LAST AIRBENDER.I found the conceptual universe rather fascinating though. The idea of four human tribes, each related to one of the Classical Elements, and each with ""Benders"" who can manipulate those elements through a series of stylized katas caught my imagination. I liked the idea that one human, The Avatar, has been successively reincarnated and has learned to use all the Elements. I found the melange of cultural elements among the four races fascinating too, from the Tibetan Buddhist-styled Air Nation (who wear the Dalai Lama's colors and use his name, Gyatso) to the Native American/Eskimo-styled Water Nation with their ice teepees and igloos, to the technologically-advanced steam-era militants, the Fire Nation. The Earth Nation barely made an appearance, though.The downside to THE LAST AIRBENDER was not characterization, it was the pacing of the story. The story itself, of the Fire Nation seeking to enslave the yet-untrained Avatar made perfect sense, and the main characters were engaging. But the film dragged deplorably in spots as Shyamalan struggled to fill up 120 minutes of screen time with 60 minutes of script and the presumption of a sequel.Overall, I enjoyed THE LAST AIRBENDER (which surprised me; I assumed it would be intolerable, based on the previews), and I would like to see the sequel, and now that I've been introduced to the story I'll probably give the cartoon show a whirl, but Shyamalan needs to give The next LAST AIRBENDER a bit more---quite a bit more---story and substance.

As a long time Science fiction/fantasy fan, I would have grown to love the cartoon even if I didn't have two daughters who introduced me to it.I know movie adaptations can't be purely faithful to source material and if the movie is done well I generally don't care. Coraline, for example - good movie, but different from the book - both are in my opinion quite good.I decided not to care about the odd racial casting changes, the name pronunciation changes and the story line compression because I felt that these would not mean that the movie would therefore be bad, or even a travesty of what the original is.But bad acting, direction AND script?  And horrible characterizations? What the hell was M Knight thinking when he cast Zhao and Ozai? Did he ever even watch them on screen? Both of them were pissant men who really were more annoying than menacing.My suggestion to M Knight is to get the original voice actors to over dub the movie so that at least the poorly written and directed movie will be acted well. Dante Basco as Zuko evokes all the appropriate emotions in the audience... Dev Patel just looked like he was having a bad day.A lot of haters say don't watch it... but I say... go on and watch it.

Knight Shyamalan (or however you spell it, I don't even care if I got it wrong, that's how much I DON'T respect his work) has got to be the WORST director ever to be allowed to foist his crap onto the public. I know, people think his movies are so great, blah blah blah. I've even seen him compared to Alfred Hitchcock...which is practically blasphemous! Hitchcock was a master, Shyamalama-ding-dong is a hack, pure and simple. I don't even pretend to understand the workings of the film industry, but I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would fund him and allow him to continue to make movies.I mean, this was a wonderful animated series, and he managed to screw it up and make a movie that was totally boring and lame. Okay, granted, it's surely not all his fault. The script is pretty bad, and whoever cast it should be taken out and shot by firing squad!!But there's no energy, no spark, no heart, no anything in the characters, and the actors seem almost embarrassed to be speaking their lines.I understand this was made for kids, but kids these days are smart and sophisticated, and don't want to be condescended to. Especially if they're loyal fans of the TV show. It's a slap in the face that a movie made from a beloved show sucks so bad you can't even finish watching it!But, I'm not a kid, I'm an adult. And yes, I really enjoyed the TV show. It was smart and funny and sweet and heartwarming. It had everything a good show should have. But the movie failed miserably and did not live up to the show. Which is sad.They should have gotten Joss Whedon to direct it. That would have been awesome!I read many of the bad reviews for this movie, and thought, yeah, they're probably right, I mean, look who directed it! And yes, they are right. I also read many of the good reviews, just to get both ""sides"". But, I have to agree with the bad ones...it does sucks, and badly! I can't recommend it.

They always go with the classic ""Critics are stupid and will not care about anything that's not an art film"", ""Fanboys can't stand any change to their show"", ""People think it's cool to hate on the director"" or ""It's just a fun popcorn movie, sometimes it's OK to turn your brain off and enjoy the ride"".  You know, the classic excuses they all give when they can't find an actual good reason to like a film.  Whenever a movie is defended this way, beware, for you are, most likely, in the presence of an awful film.So, on to the film.  It's based, of course, on an anime of mostly the same name, following the adventures of Aang, the Avatar and titular Last Airbender and his friends Katara (a waterbender) and Sokka, Katara's brother and brave if not particularly gifted warrior.  Element Benders are people who possess the ability to control the elements.  Not the ones from the Periodic Table, but the classic ones from legend and every RPG ever: Water, Earth, Fire and Air.  The Avatar is a special person who can control all elements and comunicate with the spirit world, and reincarnates every time he dies in a new, different bender.  When Aang was informed he was the Avatar, he couldn't cope with the responsability and ran away.  Lost in a storm, he froze himself to survive, but unfortunately ended up undiscovered for over a hundred years, during a time in which, in his absence, the Fire Nation attacked the other ones (before this, all coexisted peacefully) and waged a long war.  After Katara and Sokka find Aang they decide to help him in his quest to learn to control the rest of the elements and compensate for his mistake by defeating the Fire Nation.On the other side of the story is Prince Zuko, who was scarred and expelled from the Fire Nation by his own father for defying him, and whose only chance at regaining his honor is to capture the Avatar and bring him to his father.  Zuko is passionate and obsessive, but noble, and he's joined on his quest by his wise and caring uncle Iroh, who cares more for his nephew than for glory.  Then there's Admiral Zhao, who cares only for the triumph of the Fire Nation, with total disregard for everything and everyone else, including Zuko, who he openly despises.Pay a lot of attention to those last two paragraphs, because that's far more care about the plot and characters than Shyamalan gave in the entire film.  The movie is trying to condense the entire first season (20 episodes) in less than two hours.  That's no easy task, and even a fantastic director would have problems with that, so you'd think that we could cut some slack to M. Night.  The problem is, he doesn't even try.  When asked to bake a cake, he simply throws all the ingredients together without unpacking them, measuring them or cooking them, and what comes out is practically inedible.The director's decisions are baffling at best and mind-numbingly stupid at worst.  There are some weird choices, like switching around the races of the different nations and pronouncing the names differently than the show.  That's not inherently bad, but it makes absolutely no sense.  But when it comes to the story and the characters, things take a turn for the brain-bending.  The characters are just different here.  All of them.  They share the same name and more or less the looks of the ones in the anime, but they behave completely different.  Katara seems unable to smile, Sokka is grim and pessimist, Zuko seems unable to emote, etc.  I know you can't expect much from child actors, but the problem is not the acting (well, not the ONLY problem), since the kids do what they're told to do.  And they're all told to behave completely different from how they should.And I honestly think people who haven't watched the anime will exchange fury for confusion.  The plot is trying to condense so much that characters are introduced and forgotten in a matter of seconds, scenery changes constantly, people come and go without rhyme or reason and things happen with no explanation.  Those who watched the series will understand because they know what the movie fails to explain.  Those who didn't watch will be baffled.Then there's the action.  The special effects are, for the most part, good.  They look nice and it's easy to understand what happens on screen.  The problem is that the action is profoundly boring.  I don't know how they managed to make people attack others by controlling elements so dull, but they did it.  You'd think after the irritating excess of dialogue some action would be welcomed, but everything is so poorly shown that you can't find it entertaining.Oh yeah, the dialogue.  The absolute main problem of this movie is the one that plagues political comics but should never be present on a film: excess talking.  You see, a movie is a visual medium.  It should focus on showing rather than telling.  Yet most of the movie is spent with people talking, and talking, and talking.  And not talking about themselves, how they feel or what their motivations are, in order to show depth to the characters.  Oh, no.  They only talk to further the plot.  They talk to explain what happened before.  They talk to explain what is happening now and they talk to explain what's going to happen in the future.  They spend so much on exposition that you have to wonder why they bothered making a movie instead of a book.All in all, this is barely watchable if you actually understand what's going on thanks to previous knowledge of the series.  People who haven't watched it should not be subjected to this absolute dreck.  No one should.  If you want real, good, fun and interesting entertainment, stick to the anime.  This movie is better if it's forgotten.",1,"Not worst movie ever, but worst Shyamalan film, and that says a lot...",1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,6608,"['Having', 'never', 'watched', 'anime', 'movie',

I do understand that most of the negative reviews had to do with angry fans panning the movie for various reasons. I read many of those reviews before writing mine and as loyal and dedicated fans they're certainly entitled to their opinions.However, none of that applied to me, so I could watch it without any previous expectations. If nothing else, the visuals and backdrops are possibly the most beautiful of any CGI movie I've ever seen. I thought the movie was worth seeing just for that. I remember what computer generated graphics were like 30 years ago and we're a long way from that with movies like this. One wonders how much better they can get since there seems to be nothing is really beyond the capabilities of computer rendering at this point.Overall, I thought the movie was fun and just very visually appealing. The action scenes and martial arts fights were fine (I am a martial arts teacher myself), the cast was good, and the musical score also worked well with the movie.

You have been warned.How my ratings work:5 - I really liked/loved it4 - I liked it3 - Could've been better/worth a look2 - Just didn't live up to the potential1 - Simply awfulOh M. Night Shyamalan. How the mighty hath fallen so far from grace. His breakout film was of course The 6th Sense, which many may not know as in fact his third full length feature film. His first film Praying With Anger is hard to find and I hope to some day check it out. His second feature was a family dramedy called Wide Awake, which is actually a pretty touching story of a Catholic school boy losing his grandfather and trying to work through the loss and his faith in God. I really like the 6th Sense. It was tense, scary, and had great performances all around and I can easily say is one of Bruce Willis' best performances. Unbreakable was another good turn by Willis, as well as co-star Samuel L. Jackson. Signs I first saw when I was 14 and I liked it a lot more when it first came out than I do now. Still, it's a guilty pleasure. I also enjoyed The Village despite the obvious twist mainly because I felt the performances weren't half bad. I'm probably in the minority of people who enjoyed Lady in the Water. Yes it was a bit self indulgent of M. Night to cast himself as this future important writer, but Paul Giamatti as always does a good job and Bryce Dallas Howard is enjoyable. If you think of the movie by fairy tale logic than the stuff that doesn't make a whole lot of sense isn't so bad. I've only seen clips of The Happening, and from what I can tell it's unintentionally hilarious. Okay, now let's get to the real point as many people will say.I hadn't seen Avatar: The Last Airbender during it's original run on Nickelodeon. At this point Nick, a staple of my childhood, began to seriously disappoint with it's various crappy shows. Upon hearing there was a live action version in the works, and serious praise from my friends, I decided to check out the show. AND I LOVED IT! This is a fantastic show! The story is compelling, the characters are well drawn out, the setting is rich and colorful, and the mythology is very interesting. Even the villains and secondary characters are enjoyable to watch. When it's funny it's hilarious, when serious it really makes you care, and when there's an action moment it's super exciting.Brief synopsis: There are four nations of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. One hundred years ago the Fire Nation started a war against the rest of the nations. In this world there are people with special abilities to bend the said elements and perform extraordinary feats. One person is able to perform all elements. This person is the Avatar. Every time the Avatar dies her or she is reincarnated. During the war, the Avatar died and was reincarnated as a young Air Bender named Aang. However, Aang was frozen in ice, along with his flying bison with 6 feet named Appa (you read that right), before he could master all his bending techniques. He's unfrozen 100 years later by two water tribe siblings named Katar and Sokka. Katara is a water bender while her older brother Sokka is an aspiring warrior and strategist. Looking for the Avatar is Fire Nation prince Zuko who's been banished by his father Fire Lord Ozai. He's accompanied by his uncle Iroh. The series involves Aang trying to master all 4 elements, with Katara and Sokka tagging along, while also avoiding the Fire Nation from capturing him.I don't think it was impossible to compact the first season into a full length feature film. There was plenty of filler moments that could easily be taken out, and if you make the movie over 2 hours you could still establish plenty. And the trailer for it did look pretty cool!But then I saw the movie...in theaters...in 3D. Siiiiiiigh :(Soooooooooo. Where do I begin? Why does this movie fail on so many levels? What caused it to be a fail of epic proportions? And in this case epic fail does work given the budget and scope of the film. Shyamalan does manage to stick with the basic plot. Too bad he's made everything dull as dirt, but more on that later. Shyamalan has claimed to watch the show because of his kids, but you wouldn't guess from how this turned out. This list won't be in a particular order of what's worse, since pretty much everything fails. I'm more going by what comes to my mind first.1. THE NAMES! I'm sure many will say that's nitpicking. But when you've seen the show and then see the movie the pronunciations are jarring. Aang sounds like ONG, Sakka like SO-KA, Iroh like E-RO, and throughout the movie they go back and forth on pronouncing Avatar as OVATAR. They even mess up the pronunciation of Yin and Yang, calling it YONG. I have never heard anyone say it that way. This is basic philosophy that nearly everyone knows, and anyone will know it's YANG.2. From the opening this film is not working. It shows 4 different people showing off the bending techniques. The opening of the show lists off each element as it happens. Here it's silent. By doing so it just dulls everything down. It's not till after showing off the techniques that we get exposition (and the more you read the more you'll see why I titled this review ""The Last Expositionist"") from Katara (Nicola Peltz)in the form of a text scroll. Given that this is a motion picture, it would have been way more exciting to see the war starting as Katara narrates.3. The bending effects rarely work. Right away we see that when Katara accidentally splashes Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) with some water she's bending. One scene many people point out is a scene that looks as if 6 earth benders are moving one not so giant rock. I think that was just bad framing, but yeah either way it looks bad. The bending is also inconsistent as there's a scene where various fire nation soldiers are shocked to see Iroh (Shaun Toub) fire bending without a source. This is not how it worked in the show. A fire bender doesn't need a source, unless you count air to ignite it. Also Shyamalan makes the bending over complicated, having people do unnecessary movements.4. The casting. In the show each nation seemed to have a clear ethnic background worked out. The Fire nation was Chinese, the Water Nation Eskimo, The Earth Benders Caucasian, and Air Nation also seem to be a sort of Chinese influence. In this movie Shyamalan has made the Fire Nation Indian, the Water Nation a combo of Eskimo and Caucasian, Earth Nation Chinese, and Air Nation various ethnicities.5. The acting/personalities...OH. MY. GOD! It could be because the writing is just awful, but the acting is so embarrassing you just want to tell the actors they can stop and go home. I'm gonna include personalities here too since I feel it does go hand in hand. They get everyone wrong.A. Aang (Noah Ringer) looks like a deer in headlights. This is his first movie and it really shows. He does not have the talent to hold this together. All he does is sulk in this movie. Yes Aang could be serious in the show, but he was still a 12 year old boy. He was all about having fun and being a kid. One scene shows an incarnation who someone mentions liked to play games. Aang says he likes to play games, but who would ever guess that from this movie. His motivations are wrong as well. In the show he ran away because the elder monks were going to take him away from another monk who practically raised him because they felt he was holding him back. In the movie it's because Aang was told he could never have a family, so he didn't want to be the Avatar. So instead of touching father son like relationship being broken up, Shyamalan made it that this 12 year old boy was upset that he'd never get to have a family and prompting him to just let the world be taken over by evil. I'm sorry but no 12 year old boy is going to think ""Oh man! I can never have a family!""B. I know that Jackson Rathbone is best known for the Twilight films, but I haven't seen those. Man is he terrible! Based on this performance alone I have no idea how he gets movie roles. He delivers every line as if he's about to hit puberty or he's about to mess his pants. There's only a couple scenes that even try to use him as comic relief, and then it's just dropped. They make him so incompetent. Yes in the show Sokka was a goof, but he was also our point of view character. He was the only major character who wasn't an element bender, so he had to rely on his whits in fights. He was able to hold his own most of the time, but not here.C. Katara's job is simply to give exposition at sporadic moments throughout the movie. I can tell the actress is trying some, but for the most part she looks like she's always on the verge of tears. Maybe she realized early on that this movie was a stinker and it made her sad.D. Zuko (Dev Patel) is annoying! Some sited Patel as the only decent actor, but I would disagree. He's been given the direction to brood in every scene he's in. Yes in the show Zuko was brooding, but he still came off as human. He still had comedic moments, or moments where you think this guy isn't totally evil. Also the facial scar that plays an integral part in Zuko's character is made practically non existent. In the show and movie Zuko questioned his father's tactics and thus was forced to fight to reclaim honor. Zuko refused to fight, but his father still attacked and gave him a horrible scar on the left side of his face. For a show on a kids network this scar was rather intense looking. He was unable to fully open his eye, and his left ear was just a nub. It also helped that starting out in the show his hair was a long ponytail in the middle, while the rest of his head was bald, thus showing off the scar more. But in the movie he has a full head of short hair and his scar looks more like a bad rash.E. Iroh. Shaun Taub you can tell is trying, but again there's no saving here. His look reminds me of Tommy Chong (if Chong had actually played role this movie would've at least been funnier) and he has nasty looking dreadlocks. Iroh was another heart of the show. He was a better father to Zuko than Ozai ever was, even if it took Zuko a while to realize this. He was also more jovial in the show and often spat out words of wisdom. Here he just talks and sounds mostly uninterested.F. Commander Zaoh (Aasif Mandvi) is probably the only silver lining because he's the only actor not playing it straight. He mostly hams it up, which puts some life in the movie.G. There's no point in mentioning anyone else in detail. Princess Yue (Seychelle Gabriel) is just there and Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis) is given a serious lackluster introduction. In the show we don't see his face till Book 3 and it gives more impact to the threat of this character.6. The Look. Shyamalan loves his dark color pallets. The show was bright and colorful and it was easy to tell what nation was what. Here everything is so murky and dim you just feel depressed watching it.7. The Dialogue. With each movie Shyamalan shows more and more that he has no idea how people talk to each other. There's a scene where a young Earth Nation boy meets our heroes and they are captured and taken to a prison with other Earth Nation people. The boy runs up to some guy proclaiming ""DAD!"" and follows this with ""This is my father."" No kidding he's your father! You just said it! It's as if Shyamalan thinks kids are stupid and won't make that connection. There's a scene where Aang is escaping a Fire Nation stronghold with a mysterious man in a blue mask (SPOILER: it's Zuko). They end up in some circle area with these spinning boards and Aang goes ""This is there training area."" Um...so what? This is a bit of dialogue that adds absolutely nothing to what is going on. I know it's knit picking, but there was no reason for him to say it.8. Hardly any establishment. Things are very much rushed in this movie. Aang's named is first said in narration while they're on their way to an Air Temple, and right after said narration Katara in film asks him his name. Wouldn't they have asked that after finding him in ice? Appa's (the flying six legged bison) name is said once in the entire film, and it's not when they introduce the characters. Then there's Momo. Who's Momo? He's a monkey/bat hybrid our heroes meet at the air temple. One scene towards the end has Aang saying ""Momo stop."" He may as well not be in this movie because they don't use him at all. The only reason Aapa is here is because they needed a way to get around quickly. In the show both these animal characters had way more personality. Speaking of animals, the show had a plethora of amazingly cool hybrid animals. Many were also silly looking, but it was still fun to see. But we don't see any of these things. In the final battle of the film the Fire Nation soldiers are riding giant lizards! These were never mentioned before and it's the first time being shown. You have to establish these things for those that never saw the show. This isn't a household name like The Simpsons where in that movie we don't need an intro to those characters and the world they live in. There's also scenes where Aang seems to go into a spirit realm and talk to a dragon. They never say what it is or why Aang is going into this realm. In the show he's going into a trance so he can talk to his previous incarnation, who does have a dragon but isn't the one talking to him. The movie says nothing of this. It also doesn't explain Aang going into the Avatar state, where he's able to release a great amount of energy.9. Pacing. Everything is rushed. The narration comes in and out at random times. There's a drive by romance between Sokka and Princess Yue, complete with a painful scene of them trying to flirt. The Blue Spirit sub plot is dropped about as fast as it appears.10. EXPOSITION! And Now we come to why my review has it's title. So much of this movie is random narration of Katara telling us what's happening. If this movie was over 104 minutes we wouldn't need so much of this. People assume that kids won't sit through a movie that's 2 hours or more. This is a PG film, so the target audience is old enough to where if it holds their attention it doesn't matter if it goes to 2 hours or more.While the movie was a mild success, it got mostly a thrashing from critics. I really hope they don't manage to make a sequel to this. I don't understand how you mess it up so terribly. Shyamalan had an entire first season to work with. And it's yet another movie that tacks on the 3D to boost the prices of tickets. I have a feeling that's why it was a mild success. I read on Wikipedia a while back Shyamalan saying that the sequel would be ""darker and more ambiguous."" How could it get any darker? This movie was so dreary looking! But so far it seems that a sequel isn't going to happen. It is a shame that Shyamalan seemed to peek way too early in his career, and then just seemed to lose it.So there's my review. I had to make this one long. I had a lot to say about it. And yes it's been a while since it was out in theaters so it seems late for me to writing about it. But I wanted to be able to give my opinions. After all the point of the internet is to come together and complain about movies. Also share naughty pics and videos with one another. ^_^",1,The Last Expositionist,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,15294,"['WARNING', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'review', 'have', 'been', 'warned.How',

The ""bending"" feature of this movie was so beautiful, like a very skilled dance and I enjoyed that element. I also enjoyed the effects and scenery. I guess I would qualify it as a very ""artsy"" movie...The only downside I saw with it is that it does have a ""spirit"" world and is kinda new-ageish in that respect so people that don't believe in that element may not want to sit through a bunch of mystical ""spirits"" bologna.",4,The Last Airbender,1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,677,"['Having', 'connection', 'series', 'movie', 'think', 'can', 'give', 'more', 'objective', 'view', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'will', 'start', 'saying', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'bit', 'mediocre', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'plot', 'bending', 'feature', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'very', 'skilled', 'dance', 'enjoyed', 'element', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'effects', 'scenery', 'guess', 'would', 'qualify', 'very', 'artsy', 'movie', 'only', 'downside', 'saw', 'have', 'spirit', 'world', 'kinda', 'new-ageish', 'respect', 'so', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'element', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'sit', 'bunch', 'mystical', 'spirits', 'bologna']",The Last Airbender

When he makes a movie based on a cartoon, the fans lynch him for not living up to the spirit of the toon.The Last Airbender is a fun fantasy film.I am one of the masses who knows nothing about the animated series. I got this because I enjoyed the music and the special effects looked fun. On both counts, this movie is entertaining. The music drives the action and the effects are great eye-candy.In a world of nations based on the elements, (water, fire, earth, air) Noah Ringer plays, Aang, the last airbender. He can do some funky moves and manipulate the air to do whatever he wishes. Water benders, fire and earth benders have the same ability with their respective elements.The Fire nation wants to control the world. They know of the prophecy of an Avatar - someone who can control all the elements. Once they realize it's Aang, the chase is on.Aang is teamed up with other friends to protect him and gather the other nations to fight off the Fire Nation.Unfortunately, this is only one movie so we only get as far as the water nations.

1295762,A2BHE7OREKTGGU,B002VPE1BQ,Matt Gillette,"[3, 7]","I honestly thought ""The Last Airbender"" was a much better movie than the enthusiastically negative reviews would have you believe (and I guarantee they wouldn't have been nearly as bad if the director's name wasn't M. Night Shyamalan - people love to hate on him these days).

I actually watched this on Nickelodeon the other week and it was the first time I've seen it since its theatrical release. The Last Airbender is a classic example of what happens when you try to squeeze an entire season of a TV series into a 90 minute film. First of all there is so much going on in the show, that the movie is forced to skip some of through some of the most iconic moments i.e. when Aang tries to learn Firebending for the first time and burns Katara resulting in his fear to learn it. Everybody in the cartoon goes through their share of problems. But the movie has to skip through all of that to keep the focus on Aang. Hell, we don't even get to see Sokka and the princess bond with each other.The second problem is the characters. Some of that has to do with the fact that actors are so terrible that saying their performance was wooden would be a compliment. There's also the fact that nobody save for Zuko, Iroh, and Katara, is IN character. Sokka has none of his humor and sarcasm. Aang whines the time about how it sucks to be the Avatar and how he failed everyone the first time (and yes I know he was depressed about that fact in the cartoon, he wasn't this emo about it) And don't even get me started on the Earthbenders.Even the fight scenes are absurd turning bending into a joke. If I could rate this film any lower, I would.

1295765,A1LNIS2WYQK9XY,B002VPE1BQ,M. Bowen,"[11, 25]","Avatar The Last Airbender, the SERIES on TV is an amazing story! It's a wonderful cartoon both serious and funny, you grow to love these characters you see. Katara, Aang, Sooka, Toph, Uncle Iroh, Zuko, and thats just naming a few! You learn alot of things about the characters I just listed. Katara is brave and tough, she doesn't take it sitting down when the Northern Water Master tells her girls don't bend for fighting but do healing. She eventually gets him to duel her, then he trains her. SHE master's water BEFORE Aang, and is actually HIS watermaster.Keeping that in Mind one scene in this movie disregarded such a wonderful scene, that I""ve chosen to make an example of. The scene where they get to the watertribe, no water master tells Katara no........no duel......no bravery on Katara's part, no determination. She's just this soft spoken (mostly) girl who BELIEVES the Avatar would return. She has faith, and at first in some of her more determined moments I saw a little, very little of Katara, the real one.The movie feels rushed, most of the scenes are horrible, and the music overtaking most of the movie makes it bad! I absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR DIME ON THIS FILTHY DISGUSTING MOVIE! This director was horrible, the characters were supposed to be more serious apparently, but none of the actors could really act. Or maybe it was the musical moments that killed some of their emotion. My point is this, Aang is a happy fun loving young boy of 12, who got frozen in the ice, he has his serious moments, but he knows how to have fun. He doesn't just stand there like that one in the movie did. Looking all sad and depressed, and somehow emotionless at the sametime. HOW do you get that?

1295767,A370Z6I5GBWU44,B002VPE1BQ,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[299, 354]","Originally, I had been intending to wait until this film came out on DVD so I could rent it from a Redbox. However, my friend wanted to see this, and invited me along. I thought, why the heck not.He wanted to see it in 3D, so I thought, sure, might as well. The 3D cost 4 extra bucks, but after the movie was over, I felt totally ripped off. The movie previews that came before the actual Airbender movie itself had more 3D in them than the danged movie! There were a few moments where the 3D effects popped out, but overall, if you watch this in 2D, you're not really missing out on anything here.I don't know what M. Night Shymalan was thinking when he directed this. Now, it would have been IMPOSSIBLE to get all of the cool stuff in Season 1 into this movie, but what the people responsible for this atrocity did was disgraceful. There was so much cut out. Many beloved characters - the Kyoshian Warriors, Jet, Bato, Jeong Jeong, Haru, Avatar Roku, King Bumi, Madame Wu, the pirates, the list goes on... none of them made a single appearance. Many things were simply smushed together - for example, Haru's village and the Kyoshi Village have apparently been mushed together as one - but there's no Haru or Kyoshian Warriors (the only thing we see is a old stone statue of Avatar Kyoshi) All the cutting out of vital elements of the story was really unneccessary as this movie was barely one and a half hours. Titanic was twice that long, and this movie could have done at least two hours easy. Why such a short film? Only God knows why. Maybe M. Night or the producers got bored and decided to just cut out as much as he thought he could get away with.Of course, you CAN'T fit twenty episodes into one movie. We all know that. I've seen enough book to movie adaptations to know that a movie adaptation can never get everything in from the source, but the problem with this movie is that there was minimal effort to capture the spirit of the TV series. I didn't feel like the producers and director CARED for the story, with the way the movie came out plot and dialogue-wise.I loved Dev Patel as Zuko. And for a odd reason, I rather liked Iroh's appearance. Both of them were decent actors. But none of the lines from the show made it to the movie - such as Sokka's sarcasm, Aang asking Katara if she wanted to go penguin-sledding, the delicious banter between Zhao and Zuko (and the Agni Kai that resulted from it), Iroh's nuggets of wisdom, and so on and so forth. What made the show so great and enjoyable was stripped away from the movie. I didn't FEEL any of the essence of the show in this.The Bending was a joke. Some of the fight scenes were awesome, but much of the Bending was preceded by what looked like interpretive dance whereas on the show, Bending was pretty much instantaneous with just one or two moves or gestures. Why did M. Night do this to the Bending arts? Again, only God knows why. He clearly had the budget, and the costumes were great - I loved the clothing of the Fire Lord and Admiral Zhao. Overall the costumes for everyone seemed well-done, but so many other things were lacking and props could not save the atrocious storyline, writing, and dialogue.Very little of the original show remains. Even the freaking name pronouncation has changed. If all of the character's names were changed and the Bending was renamed 'element magic' or something like that, this could easily have passed as an entirely different movie/story. One would think that with such an AWESOME TV show, the movie would be awesome too. Most of the actors for this film - especially Aang, or should I say, 'Ohng' - failed in their roles and were so unlike their TV counterparts and such lackluster actors in their roles that I wonder why M. Night chose them in the first place. It seems especially that the actors for Aang and Sokka have never seen the TV show and didn't bother studying their characters - which to me is shocking, because any actor in a movie adaptation should take the time to study their character and source material.Sadly, it's a terrible film, and I'm afraid of what M. Night and the producers will do with the next movie. Even people who haven't seen the TV show are trashing this film, and I have to agree. So much has been cut out that if you don't have the TV show information in your mind, things become really confusing. Hopefully M. Night will read all the negative reviews and rethink his plans for the next Airbender movie, because if he didn't even take the time to make sure the character's names were pronounced properly, he shouldn't be too surprised that people are being so critical of the film.",2,Wasted potential,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,4637,"['Originally', 'had', 'been', 'intending', 'wait', 'film', 'came',

It's not for everyone--just like Lady in the Water wasn't for everyone.  Regardless, I think he does a great job with this title.  In my opinion, there's little to complain about!  You can't knock the 3D theater version in a review of the DVD, right?  Anyways...The movie isn't exactly like the cartoon; it's more of an interpretation of the cartoon.  There's a mix of different people and places that aren't entirely asian.  You'll see eskimo-like people, Egyptian/desert style cultures, and more.  Changing the style to match the elements and regions is an imaginative idea.The martial arts-esque moves that they do to control the elements are just plain cool!  Some of it looks like dancing, but it reminds more of a kata or ritualistic martial arts--maybe tai chi or something like that.  It looks great and it lends to the mystical nature of what the characters are doing.  There's an art form to it that's expressed in bodily movements.  If you want the cartoon version, or you don't care for the dance-like martial arts, then I'd avoid this movie.The story is good.  I thought it was creative, original, and well realized on the screen.  I've seen elements of it in other movies, particularly movies with an eastern flavor, but Airbendor does a great job of reinventing them.  The acting is pretty good, for the most part.  There are a few 'campy' moments and bland interactions but not enough to ruin the whole movie.  The visual effects are astounding.  The movie makes good use of slow motion scenes without overdoing it: the slow motion is used to highlight a particular bending power, move, etc and it works well.The movie is family friendly.  There aren't any words, scenes, or other situations that I'd feel uncomfortable letting my 8 and 10 year olds watch.  We're very picky; we don't have subscriber TV for that reason.

The plot made little sense, rushing from one scene to the next without any comprehensible progression in the story line. Literally the only two sequences that make any sense at all are the first and the last. Everything between is just jumbled nonsense. The acting is worse still, with hardly any characterization or personality to distinguish one person from the next. I'm having a difficult time believing that M.N.

All this movie is a cheap knock off of the Never Ending Story with a mixture of Mortal Kombat thrown into the mix.What made it even worse was the god awful dance moves these moron actors do before a fight scene. It really does look so stupid that it's not funny. So the plot is about a billion year old kid who is the chosen one, but he gets frozen in time, but comes out in time to help the future who need a leader to help them fight back against the forces of evil... sigh... how many times have we heard something like this before? Oh but get ready to roll your eyes even more.. the kid doesn't know if he is the chosen one or not, he doesn't know his full potential yet and has to discover his magical abilities to dance around and break wind hard enough to blow enemies away, and if he lights one of his farts on fire they better duck under something flameproof... oh, but in this one, he just learns how to use one power... but if some idiot somewhere gives this the green light for a sequel, then expect this annoying little dancing brat to be able to use the powers of Sub Zero, Scorpion and Thunder-Butt (one of the many rejected Mortal Kombat ninja concepts)If you for some reason still want to see this movie after reading this, then all I can tell you is you will be sorely disappointed when you watch this and keep waiting for this kid to yell out for Falkor and go on a magic dragon ride... oh wait, he does.... I think the rock biters even made a cameo in this?Anyway, don't bother with this, as you can see from other reviews, it's not worth seeing.

1295776,AO65T0JON8R80,B002VPE1BQ,Michele Lyons,"[6, 16]","Reading all the negative reviews this movie got, I was a litte shy of paying a rental to watch it.  What a surprise! I found this movie to be a throughly enjoyable fantasy! I am not familiar with either the book or animated series, but that certainly did not keep me from enjoying this movie. No one should have expected that the producers would have been able to include all the characters, events and details that go into a multiple book story arc, or a 30 episode animated series, into one movie that is only about an hour and a half long! Anybody remember the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy? Lots of characters were cut out, events were changed, liberties were taken with the story, and all of it did not keep The Lord of the Rings from being one of the best movies of all time.The Last Airbender has great characters, wonderful special effects and a good fantasy story. The story is a basic quest: the young Airbender, living a happy and peaceful life in a isolated temple is presented with the news that he is to be the new Avatar, the ruler of all the clans in this world, ultimate Master of all four Elements, speaker to spirits--a god in all but name! Since he is just a little boy, he is frightened by all this, and runs away.  Unfortunately, a cruel fate interferes, and he is trapped in ice, frozen but alive, for 100 years. In his absence, the powerful Fire clan decides to conquer the clans and all its people. When the young Airbender is revived he finds that his single bad decision has had terrible consequences: His entire clan has been murdered, the Fire Clan has declared war on the world, they have destroyed all the temples, and murdered or imprisioned all people capable of Element Bending.  The young Avatar now embarks on an epic journey to harness his powers, free the other Element Benders, promote rebellion in the conquered lands, restore balance to the world and realize his destiny.In this movie, the Element Benders must perform a kind of ritual dance that is part fighting arts, part tai chi, and part ballet, in order to conjure forth their powers, to harness, direct and use them.  I did not find anything wrong with that. In fact, I found it beautiful and graceful.  It gave the idea that the powers of an Element Bender had to be drawn forth and manipulated with great care, effort and training. It requires dicipline of mind and body, with a spirtual element taken into consideration as well. It isn't like an X-Men spin off, where you point a finger, or wiggle your eyebrows, and blow up buildings.The special effects are well worth seeing, worth the price of the movie by themselves. And the fighting arts dances of the characters are beautiful.  The characters are good and enjoyable to watch. The acting is fine. You have a basic story that is easy to follow and to enjoy.  The only thing you should be aware of, if you are like me and not familar with the story, is that the ending does not finish the story.  It is a pause in the story telling---rather like watching the first movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  But the ending is still a good one: the hero has begun to realize his true powers, the good guys win and the bad guys are in retreat.  Of course, that is not the end of the story, not by a long shot!  Unfortunately, I do not think that any more movies will follow this one, to finish it.  Which is a great shame, as far as I am concerned.  What is good is that it may cause more people to check out the book series. But the movie was lovely and entirely enjoyable.

The commercials didn't look that great but I was willing to still give the movie a chance. I am so glad I didn't pay money or waste time going to the movie theater to watch it. I wanted to cry after watching this, how can someone screw up a movie where the script was already written?I know hollywood has a terrible time re-creating non-superhero /comic animated series into a live action movies, but this totally missed the mark. The only decent thing about the movie was appa, momo and the kid that played avatar aang (although a lot of fans think the kid was terrible). It was too dramatic when it should have been action-packed. The actors were terrible, the special affects were terrible and the script was ruined. This movie is so terrible that i gave Dragonball evolution (another hollywood disaster) a second chance and actually liked it. I have given this movie several chances since my first viewing, but I just couldn't find a the silver lining.Hopefully a decent director like (Ang Lee) or someone will decide to redo this movie the way it is supposed to be, since hollywood seems to be remaking the remakes of movies (does Spiderman ring a bell ). However I won't hold my breath.Ps. for the young ones who don't understand my spiderman comment; it is referring to the fact that spiderman was recreated into a live-action movie in 2002 starring Tobey Maguire.

I am a fan of Japanese anime and shied away from ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" for a while, because of people saying how it was some ""anime rip-off""... I regret waiting so long to watch it, because it isn't, it's just an incredible animated show that deserves the praise it gets.So, I watched the show after this live action film ""The Last Airbender"" had already been released (yes, I know I was behind, but once I got to it, I finished the entire show in three days), and I knew I might watch it at some point. The day came, and for reasons already listed in other reviews, I was VERY disappointed. Just to sum-up my disappointments and dislike for this film: name pronunciations, lack of character in the characters (no bad Sokka jokes? No bubbly Aang? He was so emo, only Zuko sort of remained in character), the very undramatic introduction of Fire Lord Ozai (they waited until the beginning of season 3 to even show us his face)... there is a lot more, but this is the general stuff.In the end, I could see that if someone had never watched the animated show, they might find this movie entertaining, but if you are a fan of the series, you will most likely not enjoy it.

Loved the plot too.It's a different type of film though, and that alone could make it a bad movie if one is a fan of particular movie conventions. To TRY and explain this, the acting:I like seeing the acting in this movie, for example the girl really shines, Ang is perfect, the brother charismatic yet steady, and i really like the Uncle too. The Prince is also good but his character has less variation than others in this episode due to intensity of character arc & acting entirely appropriate in representing that for overall plot.But the acting is full of belief and imagination that is specific to The Last Airbender film and isn't so much of genre character types that you could substitute into another film of a different style - it's very much a stylistic element of this type of Fantasy Genre. For a film audience only use to genre or stylistic type of films not of this type (& this kind of fantasy film is not such a common one stylistically), this variation will be UNEXPECTED, seem bad and that could apply across the board to many different aspects of the film for that audience segment - this is an explanation, to a small factor at the very least, of the puzzling & loud negativity that has attached itself on first glance to such an otherwise obviously stand out top film enjoyed by many.The fact that Airbender has gotten such a loud reaction in this regard, shows that Airbender is a relatively rare change to such pre-concieved film issues in this area or wouldn't be the outlandish misunderstanding, for what is, a wonderful piece of cinema craft in the realisation of an inspirational & unique fantasy film entry.If reading this and only heard the bad of TLA, check it out, you might be in for a really good surprise.",5,Epic Fantasy Film full of Craft,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,1861,"['film', 'alot', 'personality', 'aspects.Best', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'potential', 'long', 'term', 'classic', 'Loved', 'plot', 'too.It', 'different', 'type', 'film', 'alone', 'could', 'make', 'bad', 'movie', 'one', 'fan', 'particular', 'movie', 'conventions', 'TRY', 'explain', 'acting', 'seeing', 'acting', 'movie', 'example', 'girl', 'really', 'shines', 'Ang', 'perfect', 'brother', 'charismatic', 'yet', 'steady', 'i', 'really', 'Uncle', 'too', 'Prince', 'also', 'good', 'character', 'less', 'variation', 'others', 'episode', 'due', 'intensity', 'character', 'arc', 'acting', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'representing', 'overall', 'plot.But', 'acting', 'full', 'belief', 'imagination', 'specific', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'film', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'genre', 'character', 'types', 'could', 'substitute', 'film', 'different', 'style', 'very', 'much', 'stylistic', 'element', 'type', 'Fantasy', 'Genre', 'film', 'audience', 'only', 'use', 'genre', 'stylistic', 'type', 'films', 'not', 'type', 'kind', 'fantasy', 'film', 'not', 'such', 'common', 'one', 'stylistically', 'variation', 'will', 'be', 'UNEXPECTED', 'seem', 'bad', 'could', 'apply', 'board', 'many', 'different', 'aspects', 'film', 'audience', 'segment', 'explanation', 'small', 'factor', 'very', 'least', 'puzzling', 'loud', 'negativity', 'attached', 'first', 'glance', 'otherwise', 'obviously', 'stand', 'out', 'top', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'many.The', 'fact', 'Airbender', 'gotten', 'loud', 'reaction', 'regard', 'Airbender', 'relatively', 'rare', 'change', 'such', 'pre-concieved', 'film', 'issues', 'area', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'outlandish', 'misunderstanding', 'what', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'cinema', 'craft', 'realisation', 'inspirational', 'unique', 'fantasy', 'film', 'entry.If', 'reading', 'only', 'heard', 'bad', 'TLA', 'check', 'out', 'might', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'surprise']",The Last Airbender

Night Shyamalan had mustered was broken, and the theatre burst into guffaws of laughter. (Those not familiar with British schoolboy dialect need only note that ""bender"" generally isn't taken as a generic reference to those who are skilled at bending things.)Now it would be a real pity, were this a film of great (or even a little) merit, for an otherwise meaningful cinema experience to be ruined by such a careless and unfortunate error. But it isn't a great pity. This isn't a single error. It's indicative of the whole film.I tried hard to find positives in The Last Airbender, which has already received a roasting back home, for every film deserves the benefit of the doubt. But doubts are few and far between. I got as far as scraping the ""nice set design"" and ""impressive surround-sound rendering"" barrels just to think of something nice to say.The Last Airbender is a sub-Harryhausen car-crash of a movie. It has none of the adeptness, inventiveness or creepiness Shyamalan demonstrated in theThe Sixth Sense(or even in the flawedSigns).The plot is somewhere between byzantine and incoherent - perhaps no surprise, as it is a condensation of something like seven hours of an animated TV series. But Shyamalan doesn't trust his own direction to handle the exposition (much less respect his audience to nut it out) and so repeatedly has his characters stop and explain what's going on in portentous, but ludicrously scripted and woodenly executed, soliloquies. That offends the first rule of film-making: show; don't tell.Conceptually, The Last Airbender is dreadfully derivative and, by and large, of dreadful films (The Golden Compass looms large, as do The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, at least two lesser episodes of Star Wars, all three of the Matrix; the Last Emperor, Avatar and the bad bits of Lord of the Rings). Inexplicably, one of the beasties from Where The Wild Things Are - a large hairy, dopey monster with a platypus tail - seems to have wandered onto the set, been roped in, and given the most improbable power of flight. Whenever things look a bit touch-and-go for poor old Aang (who at some times is startlingly vulnerable, at others can effortlessly repel hoardes of attackers using only Tai-Chi) this great hairy boulder flies in from nowhere to save the day.The universally wooden acting is almost entirely the fault of the script. This is therefore a let-off for Dev Patel and others, for there is no compelling way to say things like ""your destinies are tied, Zuko"". The script in turn drives a quite incoherent screenplay (you can follow it, but only by mapping it against archetypal plot formulas (for example: ""this must be the bit where the hero is captured, nearly killed and then, because he has been underestimated, miraculously escapes to regroup and save the day"" and so on).The cast's general lack of acting acumen (one or two of the leads are so entirely forgettable that I honestly can't remember them) is only accentuated by the ropey choreography. From time to time whole troupes of benders break out into synchronised air-karate, in the manner of a Bollywood dance routine, only not quite in time with each other.  And whenever it looks like a semblance of decorum is about to be restored, one of the characters will cry something like, ""Earthbenders! Why are you acting this way?"" (a question I pondered of Dev Patel on more than one occasion) or ""Look! A bender!"" Cue more guffaws.To add unneeded insult to what are surely mortal injuries, during post-production someone had the bright idea of rendering the film in 3D, even though it wasn't shot that way, and so you have to watch it through blurry plastic glasses for a 3D effect that doesn't work very well in the first place.The Last Airbender could almost have been a superb spoof. But not quite. I tried to convince myself that this was, in fact, what was going on in a last desperate attempt to give it the benefit of the doubt. But I really couldn't.  The sad irony is that so little would be needed to change into the most subtle and devastating parody. A missed opportunity: perhaps Mr Shyamalan will release a director's cut.In the mean time, masochists only need applyOlly Buxton",1,He's a bender!,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,4618,"['other',

1295798,A2P0L2XE35BYQW,B002VPE1BQ,"Patt ""Shop4Bliss""","[4, 8]","Contrary to so many ridiculous negative reviews, the Last Airbender is in itself a good film. While I am completely aware that this film is based on the anime series of the same name. What most negative reviewers fail to mention is that it is LOOSELY based on the anime. I, personally have never really watched the anime, nor am I interested to do so. I own quite a few anime dvds as well as seen countless others in my lifetime, so I do know the genre. However, the Last Airbender does not deserve the slam from many people who are obviously bias because they are angry fans of the anime. Nor, does M. NightShyamalan deserve the terrible backlash he has received because of this film. With that being said, I will move on to my review of both the film and Blu-ray version.The Last Airbender as a film:To cram a long running anime series clocking in at well over several hours into about an hour and forty minute feature film is no easy task, hence why there is a possible sequel being negotiated which would be nice to expand on the storyline. The storyline is very long and in-depth but broken down to fit under two hours worth of film, so there is a ton left out which is obvious with any franchise Hollywood grabs hold of. The story is the number one gripe by fans because there is so much depth of the series the feature lacks. Although, from the eyes and ears of the average movie-goer the story works well and keeps one entertained as it did for me, and obviously millions of others, since it grossed $150 million, $20 million more than its budget. The story is decent enough to get the point of the film and its characters across to the audience. Yes, it is no way near as detailed as the anime but you shouldn't expect it to be, the Last Airbender is no Lord of the Rings and even that amazing trilogy was missing a lot from the books. Needless to say, the story here works well. Unfortunately, some of the acting falls flat and at times the dialogue comes off as if the actors are merely reading the script but what do you expect when most are unknown actors and actresses. The director, editing and overall production values are what you would expect from an M. Night Shyamalan picture minus ""the twist"" he typically adds to all of his films. I enjoyed the film for what it is; a fun fantasy-adventure set in an cool world filled with magical characters, feuding clans & elemental powers.The Last Airbender as a Blu-ray:The picture quality is beautifully rendered and suited perfectly for the blu-ray format. The colors are vibrant, rich with detail and texture. The contrast between light and dark colors is amazing. The picture is prestine. The Blu-ray is without a doubt breath taking! Easily one of the best looking discs out now, if every Blu-ray could look as perfect as this one, no one would think twice about owning a player. I say this, as an owner of at least a hundred Blu-ray discs all ranging from beautiful to a slight leap over DVD.The sound quality is remarkable, no distortion or loss of sound. I will take into consideration that I have a very nice home theatre system, so that could be part of how well the disc sounds but I seriously doubt that is the only reason. I have heard some Blu-ray movies compared to this one and they are no where near as good in the sound department.Unfortunately, I have not yet viewed the bonus footage, so I will not be reviewing it at this time. I may at some point update this review but for now I am finished reviewing.",4,A Beautiful Film With A Decent Overall Production,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,3485,"['Contrary', 'so', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'good', 'film', 'am', 'completely', 'aware', 'film', 'based', 'anime', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'What', 'most', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'fail', 'mention', 'LOOSELY', 'based', 'anime', 'personally', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'watched', 'anime', 'am', 'interested', 'do', 'so', 'own', 'quite', 'few', 'anime', 'dvds', 'as', 'well', 'seen', 'countless', 'others', 'lifetime', 'do', 'know', 'genre', 'However', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'not', 'deserve', 'slam', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'bias', 'are', 'angry', 'fans', 'anime', 'M.', 'NightShyamalan', 'deserve', 'terrible', 'backlash', 'received', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'will', 'move', 'review', 'film', 'Blu-ray', 'version.The', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'film', 'cram', 'long', 'running', 'anime', 'series', 'clocking', 'well', 'several', 'hours', 'hour', 'forty', 'minute', 'feature', 'film', 'easy', 'task', 'hence', 'why', 'possible', 'sequel', 'being', 'negotiated', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'expand', 'storyline', 'storyline', 'very', 'long', 'in-depth', 'broken', 'down', 'fit', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'ton', 'left', 'out', 'obvious', 'franchise', 'Hollywood', 'grabs', 'hold', 'story', 'number', 'one', 'gripe', 'fans', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'series', 'feature', 'eyes', 'ears', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'story', 'well', 'one', 'entertained', 'did', 'obviously', 'millions', 'others', 'grossed', '150', 'million', '20', 'million', 'more', 'budget', 'story', 'decent', 'enough', 'get', 'point', 'film', 'characters', 'audience', 'Yes', 'way', 'as', 'detailed', 'anime', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'even', 'amazing', 'trilogy', 'was', 'missing', 'lot', 'books', 'Needless', 'say', 'story', 'here', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'acting', 'falls', 'flat', 'times', 'dialogue', 'off', 'actors', 'are', 'merely', 'reading', 'script', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'when', 'most', 'are', 'unknown', 'actors', 'actresses', 'director', 'editing', 'overall', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'picture', 'minus', 'twist', 'typically', 'films', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'what', 'fun', 'fantasy-adventure', 'set', 'cool', 'world', 'filled', 'magical', 'characters', 'feuding', 'clans', 'elemental', 'powers.The', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'Blu-ray', 'picture', 'quality', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'suited', 'perfectly', 'blu-ray', 'format', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'rich', 'detail', 'texture', 'contrast', 'light', 'dark', 'colors', 'amazing', 'picture', 'prestine', 'Blu-ray', 'doubt', 'breath', 'taking', 'Easily', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'discs', 'out', 'now', 'Blu-ray', 'could', 'look', 'as', 'perfect', 'one', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'owning', 'player', 'say', 'owner', 'least', 'hundred', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'ranging', 'beautiful', 'slight', 'leap', 'DVD.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'remarkable', 'distortion', 'loss', 'sound', 'will', 'take', 'consideration', 'have', 'very', 'nice', 'home', 'theatre', 'system', 'could', 'be', 'part', 'how', 'well', 'disc', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'only', 'reason', 'have', 'heard', 'Blu-ray', 'movies', 'compared', 'one', 'are', 'where', 'near', 'good', 'sound', 'department.Unfortunately', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'viewed', 'bonus', 'footage', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'reviewing', 'time', 'may', 'point', 'update', 'review', 'now', 'am', 'finished', 'reviewing']",The Last Airbender

When I first saw The Last Airbender, I had not yet seen the show. Though I thought is was okay (at the time), even I could recognize a cramped plot and fumbling dialogue. After watching all three books from Avatar The Last Airbender, however, I realized how severely disappointing the film really was. Some of my personal favorite characters were terribly represented, the writing not half as clever as the cartoon, and even the action sequences were lacking in the movie as compared to the show. Not to mention the terrible casting of the races. Looking back on it, Dev Patel would have been a much better choice to play Water Tribe Sokka than Fire Nation Zuko. Flip those two around (and their respective races) and the movie might actually have been decent. Also, if they had given movie Aang and movie Sokka personalities even REMOTELY similar to their animated counterparts, there may have been something worth saving in this film.Once again, however, the only thing that makes this movie even remotely watchable is the score and the special effects. And since the score is beautiful on its own and the effects you can look up on Youtube...I would avoid this movie if you have seen anything of the cartoon.

I do sympathize with the fans of the cartoon who feel that this film desecrated something they love, because I have the same response to Michael Bay's travesty of the ""Transformers"" - so believe me, I get it!  But as someone with no preconceived expectations, I found this movie an entirely solid and enjoyable fantasy action flick.Granted, some of the acting wasn't stellar, and some of the martial arts battles looked a bit clumsy - but the world and the scenario was well presented, with some fantastic visuals.  There was a nice contrast between the four ""nations;"" each realm of Water, Earth, Fire, and Air (what was left of it) had its own look and distinguishing characteristics.  I didn't find the characters to be flat, certainly no more so than in most other action films, and I very much liked the ambiguity of the exiled Fire prince and his uncle, who were originally presented as the villains, but turned out to be not nearly so simple.  These two were perhaps the best characters in the movie, though some of the supporting characters really shone too, in their brief appearances.  I liked the reference to the Avatar's successive incarnations, and how he was identified as a child, which was taken straight from the rites to identify the Dalai Lama (he's asked to select objects that belonged to his previously-incarnated self).The film ends on a note that hints strongly at a sequel, and I for one will look forward to it if it should be made.",4,"Being unfamiliar with the cartoon, I liked it.",1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,1601,"['guess', 'was', 'lucky', 'sense', ""'m"", 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'cartoon', 'allowed', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'do', 'sympathize', 'fans', 'cartoon', 'who', 'feel', 'film', 'desecrated', 'something', 'love', 'have', 'same', 'response', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'travesty', 'Transformers', 'so', 'believe', 'get', 'someone', 'preconceived', 'expectations', 'found', 'movie', 'entirely', 'solid', 'enjoyable', 'fantasy', 'action', 'flick.Granted', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'stellar', 'martial', 'arts', 'battles', 'looked', 'bit', 'clumsy', 'world', 'scenario', 'was', 'well', 'presented', 'fantastic', 'visuals', 'was', 'nice', 'contrast', 'four', 'nations', 'realm', 'Water', 'Earth', 'Fire', 'Air', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'had', 'own', 'look', 'distinguishing', 'characteristics', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'characters', 'be', 'flat', 'certainly', 'no', 'more', 'so', 'most', 'other', 'action', 'films', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'ambiguity', 'exiled', 'Fire', 'prince', 'uncle', 'who', 'were', 'originally', 'presented', 'villains', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'simple', 'two', 'were', 'perhaps', 'best', 'characters', 'movie', 'supporting', 'characters', 'really', 'shone', 'too', 'brief', 'appearances', 'liked', 'reference', 'Avatar', 'successive', 'incarnations', 'how', 'was', 'identified', 'child', 'was', 'taken', 'straight', 'rites', 'identify', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'asked', 'select', 'objects', 'belonged', 'previously-incarnated', 'self', '.The', 'film', 'note', 'strongly', 'sequel', 'one', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'should', 'be', 'made']",The Last Airbender

Twas a very depressing evening.First off, ENOUGH WITH THE CONVERTED 3D. Or, at least, if you're gonna convert it to 3D, PUT SOME FECKING THOUGHT INTO IT. Look at the CG animated movies, they're clearly converted and yet they are stunning. This movie was NOT 3D. It's just blurry image which requires a pair of tinted glasses to unblur the image, and there's NO depth to the picture. It took 3 minutes to get a headache and every 10 minutes I had to remove the glasses. There was no real depth or anything, it just looked like 2D but with a pair of shades on. Weak.OK that aside. The movie is bad from the start. From the dull and lifeless blast of orchestral music over the logos to the gimmicky flashy red-tinted shots of the four element benders bending the elements, and then to top it all off, the opening expository crawl and its evil twin, Obnoxious Patronizing Narrator join in on ruining any suspense about to come. Joy!!!!! The acting is... well, AWFUL. Dev Patel's performance consisted of basically SHOUTING and over-emphasizing every word, reminding me of John Travolta in Battlefield Earth. His British accent kept slipping too, and his facial expressions looked like he was reacting to someone holding a catbox under his nose. The two leads were laughably bad. I kept laughing at their wooden acting, in fact their acting was so wooden that I was expecting someone to carve a rocking chair out of them. Aang looked and sounded like he was reading the lines off of a teleprompter.The sets, aside from the gorgeous Water region, were all grungy and depressing to look at. Not that every movie has to look like Pandora from JC's Avatar, but honestly, with the big budget and all you'd think they'd have put some thought into it.The dialogue is the perfect example of how NOT to write dialogue. My favorite lines: ""Is there a spiritual place where I can meditate?"" ""There is a very spiritual place. The city was built around it, ya know."" ""I'm scared. Please don't make me more scared."" (I'm not kidding, I burst out laughing at that line) ""Let's spar! I don't think we've sparred in quite a while."" ""My father WILL take me back someday and you will bow down to me."" And pretty much every line mentioning ""Pretty girls"". Seriously, does Night actually think people talk like that?!?!?!?!?!!! The plot I won't waste much time on because there's so many holes and misconceptions.I haven't seen much of the original show so I can't say much about what they got right, but come on, it's full of holes. For example, Aang is THE LAST AIRBENDER, as the title suggests. I mean come on, while the water benders can only go so much as to attack people and they've been doing it for years, he's SOOOOOO SPECIAL that he can basically create a tsunami as does at the end. I gotta say I laughed pretty hard at that.The action scenes were pale copies of copies of copies of copies, and were very badly done. I swear the ""Burly brawl"" was a carbon copy of the prison fight scene in Watchmen! Even the music sounded similar!!! The scene near the end with all the zoom in/slow mo of Aang owning people made me laugh so hard I fell out of my chair. Way to rip off Zack Snyder, and it's also no coincidence that the Legend of the Guardians trailer showed too.In short, this movie was awful and quite possibly the worst I've seen this year, and I HAVE seen Robin Hood.

1295813,A2UMWRHKE4SQZB,B002VPE1BQ,"Richard T. Wright ""Didymus20X6""","[0, 0]","First of all, I realize that several people have already contributed reviews that pretty much say all that needs to be said, but I feel the need to attempt to communicate my own impressions of this film.I do realize that there are two ways to look at this movie: (1) as someone who is unfamiliar with the Avatar cartoon series, and (2) as a fan of the series.  So let us look at it from both perspectives.I will admit, I am a fan of the cartoon series.  I only became familiar with it recently on the recommendation of a friend, and I absolutely loved it.  But I am also well aware that it would be very easy to nitpick this movie based entirely on how it differs from the source material, or on how much of the source material is incorporated (accuracy and content).  However, it is not my intention to first off give my impression of this movie on its own merits, apart from its relationship to the original cartoon.And frankly, I don't think it holds up very well on its own merits.  Visually, it is stunning, and it does draw you in to this fantastical world.  But without reference to the original cartoon, there are far too many plot points that don't make much sense.  For example, why did the Fire Nation imprison the Earthbenders in such close proximity to their native element?  And why did Prince Zuko disguise himself as the Blue Spirit to free Aang?  Without some basic understanding of why these scenes are included in the movie, they just don't make much sense.  What's more, the characters aren't fleshed out very well, either.  I get very little sense of anyone's personality or their driving motives.  In other words, without reference to the cartoon series, the movie doesn't hold up very well as a compelling story with an interesting plot and intriguing characters.  And that's a shame, because these are the very things that made the cartoon series great.Now, in comparison to the source material, I feel I have very little to add to what others have said, but I will reiterate some key points:  too many important plot points and key characters are left out.  Granted, I don't think you could expect to cram almost 480 minutes of material into a mere 90 minutes, but that might be part of the problem in and of itself.  Why couldn't the movie have been a bit longer, say, in the 180 minute range?  The LOTR movies were each that long.And frankly, I got the sense that M. Night Shyamalan wasn't familiar enough with the source material to treat it with due respect.  He should stick with suspense-thrillers, as kung-fu fantasy simply isn't his forte.Overall, this film just did not do justice to its source material.  It was an ambitious project to start with, and it definitely deserved a better treatment than what it got.But, having said all that, the film wasn't nearly as bad as I expected.  It wasn't Battlefield Earth bad.  And the visuals do help to bring a new dimension to the animated world.  But I can't recommend it to someone who isn't a fan of the original, because it would be too confusing to watch it without reference to the cartoon series, and I can't recommend it to someone who is a fan because it doesn't come close to doing justice to the original.The best I can hope for is that those who watch this film wondering, ""What's all the fuss about?"" will then turn around and watch the cartoon, and will come away from the whole experience saying, ""I'm so glad I watched that.""  Otherwise, this is a movie that didn't need to be made.",2,"Not the worst movie, but not a good one, either.",1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,3476,"['First', 'realize', 'several', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'contributed', 'reviews', 'pretty', 'much', 'say', 'be', 'said', 'feel', 'need', 'attempt', 'communicate', 'own', 'impressions', 'film.I', 'do', 'realize', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'look', 'movie', '1', 'someone', 'who', 'unfamiliar', 'Avatar', 'cartoon', 'series', '2', 'fan', 'series', 'So', 'let', 'look', 'perspectives.I', 'will', 'admit', 'am', 'fan', 'cartoon', 'series', 'only', 'became', 'familiar', 'recently', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'am', 'also', 'well', 'aware', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'nitpick', 'movie', 'based', 'entirely', 'how', 'source', 'material', 'how', 'much', 'source', 'material', 'incorporated', 'accuracy', 'content', 'However', 'not', 'intention', 'first', 'off', 'give', 'impression', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'apart', 'relationship', 'original', 'cartoon.And', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'own', 'merits', 'Visually', 'stunning', 'draw', 'fantastical', 'world', 'reference', 'original', 'cartoon', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'points', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'example', 'why', 'did', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'Earthbenders', 'such', 'close', 'proximity', 'native', 'element', 'why', 'did', 'Prince', 'Zuko', 'disguise', 'Blue', 'Spirit', 'free', 'Aang', 'basic', 'understanding', 'why', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'What', 'more', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'anyone', 'personality', 'driving', 'motives', 'other', 'words', 'reference', 'cartoon', 'series', 'movie', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'compelling', 'story', 'interesting', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'shame', 'are', 'very', 'things', 'made', 'cartoon', 'series', 'great.Now', 'comparison', 'source', 'material', 'feel', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'add', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'will', 'reiterate', 'key', 'points', 'too', 'many', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'key', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'Granted', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'expect', 'cram', 'almost', '480', 'minutes', 'material', 'mere', '90', 'minutes', 'might', 'be', 'part', 'problem', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'longer', 'say', '180', 'minute', 'range', 'LOTR', 'movies', 'were', 'long.And', 'frankly', 'got', 'sense', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'enough', 'source', 'material', 'treat', 'due', 'respect', 'should', 'stick', 'suspense-thrillers', 'kung-fu', 'fantasy', 'simply', ""n't"", 'forte.Overall', 'film', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'ambitious', 'project', 'start', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'better', 'treatment', 'what', 'having', 'said', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'was', ""n't"", 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'bad', 'visuals', 'do', 'help', 'bring', 'new', 'dimension', 'animated', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'fan', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'confusing', 'watch', 'reference', 'cartoon', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', 'fan', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'doing', 'justice', 'original.The', 'best', 'can', 'hope', 'who', 'watch', 'film', 'wondering', 'What', 'fuss', 'will', 'then', 'turn', 'around', 'watch', 'cartoon', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'whole', 'experience', 'saying', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'watched', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'made']",The Last Airbender

1295816,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B002VPE1BQ,Robert Badgley,"[0, 3]","The Last Airbender(released June/10)stars,among others, Noah Ringer, Nicola Peltz, Dev Patel,Jackson Rathbone and Cliff Curtis.This is a nicely done fantasy film directed by M.Shyamalam.Together with an interesting story and some bang up S/Fx and computer enhancements,it is bound to please viewers of all ages.The story finds a world where humans live in tribes based on the elements earth,air,water and fire.Each tribe has at least one who can control their particular elements.Looking over the earth are four spirits who symbolize each element.The only person that can commune both with humans and spirits,and unites the world,is the avatar.The avatar has not been seen in 100 years and as such the fire tribe has been on a quest to take over the world.In the south lives a brother and sister who are under the water elements and the it is the sister who is the last remaining water user/bender in their tribe.Out looking for food they discover something under the ice.They dig it out and find a large ball of ice.Seeing something in it the sister opens it.In it lies a young boy and an animal that looks like the Luck dragon from The Never Ending Story,on steroids! He claims he ran away from his induction ceremony as the new avatar,without finishing his lessons and learning to  bend other elements,besides air.In the area happens to be an exiled prince and his uncle from the fire nation.The prince is looking to capture and return the avatar to his father in order to regain his rightful place by his side.They enter the water village and end up capturing the young boy,but he soon escapes from their grasp.He returns to the brother and sister who accompanying him on his flying animal to his home village.However the village has been destroyed in the 100 years since his disappearance.Upset he enters a dream state and communes with a dragon spirit.The spirit tells him to go far north to learn to master water bending first,then move on to other elements after.On the way north the now trio decide to stop off at an earth element tribe to try and incite them to start a rebellion against the dominant fire tribe.Members of the fire tribe that are there are fought and pushed out of the village.While there the sister is given a water bending scroll and she practices her craft while also trying to teach the avatar those skills also.The man responsible for the local forces of fire is a commander who is virtually competing to get back the avatar to the king,over the kings son and his uncle.The commander welcomes the uncle and prince aboard his fire ship for a dinner but embarrasses them,during which they walk out.Farther on the avatar visits a northern air temple and there meets a very kind priest who has been waiting for the avatars return.The avatar is taken to a room with statues of his former incarnations, but is soon captured by the commanders forces,having bribed the priest.However the avatar is not easily taken and in fact is helped to escape by an unknown masked warrior.It turns out the masked warrior is none other than the prince.The prince also cannot keep the avatar and he again escapes back to his friends.After a four day trek there and back the prince returns to his uncle and goes aboard their ship to rest before sailing the next day.However the prince barely escapes death as an explosive device detonates and destroys the ship.The uncle is given passage on board the commanders ship and the prince sneaks aboard.Meanwhile the brother,sister and avatar have made it to the northern water tribe and are welcomed.The tribe prepare themselves for the upcoming conflict as the avatar slowly but surely gains more knowledge and control over his water bending skills.The fire tribe fleet arrives outside the icy walls of the city. The avatar communes with the dragon spirit once more to try and gain some insight as to what he should do.He is told to show the fire tribe what water will do and to let his emotions flow.Back with his friends and the northern tribe,the conflict has started.The commander knows that the moon spirits will help the northern tribe as the sun sinks so with information obtained by a rare scroll,he finds a pond containing what look like two over sized goldfish;one the moon spirit and the other its counterpart the ocean spirit.The commander kills the moon spirit fish and the northern tribes advantage starts to disappear.However a northern tribe princess is there,who was originally given life by the moon spirit.She gives her life essence back to the the fish and restores the balance of power.The prince who had already sneaked inside the city and had captured the avatar briefly,is now confronting the commander.His uncle steps in and tells him to let the commander alone.Four members of the northern tribe appear behind him and in the ensuing brief battle,the four easily over power and kill him.Back at the city wall the avatar is now concentrating on the advice the dragon spirit gave him and creates and huge wall of water which towers over the fleet,ready at any moment to fall on them all and drown them.The avatar however lets the wall hang for a while then slowly lets it down.The fleet,scared off by what could have been, flees.The young avatar now stands in front of the entire village and the brother and sister who are bending down in reverence to him.He now does what he couldn't do 100 years before and accepts their devotion.Back at the castle of the fire king/lord, he has learned of his fleets defeat and his brother and sons betrayals.He now tasks his daughter with stopping the avatar before he can learn earth and fire bending.Sequel anyone? Well,considering the appalling criticism that was originally leveled at this film on its release,I'd say probably not.The series has been expanded in anime' and in comics and is available in those formats as we speak.The negative reaction to this film citing everything from racial and ethnic slurs,the lack of proper 3D,the script,to the lousy plot,you name it,was all thrown out there.And alot of it stuck on poor Syhamalam,who really took a personal and professional hit for this film.Shyamalam's ""The Happening"" ,which I saw at the theatre,deserved a far bitter lashing than this film.You see I must admit until today I(deliberately) had not seen the film.When such negative reactions occur to the extent they did for this one,I will get a copy but put it away for a period of time and THEN view it.I let time wash away the negative so in my mind I can look at it with fresh eyes and mind.Another movie I did this to was WaterworId,as it had a similar gross over panning,much by so called ""respected"" critics.Well sometimes maybe a film will deserve what it gets,but I happen to like this film despite everything that was said originally.It moves along well,the acting is good,the computer enhancements and S/Fx are superb, and I liked the story.There is also a mish mash of eastern culture on display,right down to the fighting moves.I think it is a fun family fantasy that deserves MUCH better.As an aside,it was nice to see New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis as the fire lord,whom I first saw in Xena,back in the day.The bad reaction also reminds me of the absolutely ludicrous reaction to "" The Golden Compass"",another well made movie that got panned in the same fashion, except they threw in religion into the mix.And there has never been a sequel to that one either.You have to love Hollywood.....not!Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:86:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include and featurette,deleted scenes and a gag reel.All in all I found The Last Airbender a good film.Never mind the big negs on this one,watch it for yourself and enjoy it for what it is,a wonderful fantasy film for the whole family.A solid four stars!",4,A

1295817,A1LIUMB0N0XHLG,B002VPE1BQ,ROGER WARD,"[15, 32]","As I sat in the theater watching this I wondered what was all the up roar about. This movie reminded me of the fantasy action films I grew up watching as a kid. I felt like I was 8 again. They do not make these types of movies anymore,and its sad. If you liked willow,star wars,never ending story,then you should like this. The camera work was very controlled especially during the action scenes. I heard people say this movie was boring, I really don't know how that can be,their was action through out. Maybe they wanted the camera to shake all over the place to make it feel more actiony. The movie did not over power you with special effects and action, it was paced well. The major complaint is its not like the cartoon. This is nothing new with adaptations. Lord of the rings,Narnia,and even harry potter were changed to fit in the allotted time slot. There was no love story in the book of Lord of the rings, between the elf and aragon,but they added it to the movie. ""Sacrilege""We heard the fan boys scream out.Just like what we are hearing now. Take it for what it is,a fantasy movie that harkens back to the 70's and 80's where I think the best movies of all time were made.It was a pure action,fantasy adventure. no blood,no sex,no bad language. Great visuals,and camera work. I was even expecting the acting to be really,really,really bad. I thought the acting was better then ""The spiderwick chronicles."" Which I also liked,by the way.

1295819,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002VPE1BQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","**1/2Based on the Nickelodeon series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" M Night Shyamalan's ""The Last Airbender"" takes us to a mythical world where four types of people with special powers dwell: those who can bend air (Airbenders), those who can bend water (Waterbenders), those who can bend earth (Earthbenders) and those who can bend fire (Firebenders).  Then there's the one very special person who can do all four: the messianic figure known as the Avatar, who alone is able to maintain peace and order in an otherwise chaotic world.Noah Ringer plays Aang, the youthful reincarnation of the many Avatars who preceded him.  However, this Avatar is a bit reluctant to assume the title and thus all the personal responsibilities and sacrifices that come along with it.  But Aang soon learns that he must fulfill his duty as spiritual leader of the world or the power-hungry Firebenders will become dictators over all the earth.The movie was met with such a cacophony of outrage when it was released in 2010 that, in a way, I almost hate to add my voice to the chorus of ""Airbender""-bashers.  (I suspect the vehemence of the reaction is as much a product of a generalized and almost irrational hatred of Shyamalan, as of the film itself). So I will start out on a positive note by saying that ""The Last Airbender"" is not quite as bad as I was expecting it to be, and that the premise of the story is actually quite interesting if you're into this sort of thing (which I'm generally not, though I must say that, if I were forced to choose, I'd opt for this over the ""Narnia"" films any day).  But that's about as far as I'm willing to go in defense of the work, which ultimately struggles under the weight of derivative and frequently incoherent storytelling, wooden performances and decent but unspectacular special effects.All in all, not a particularly good film - but not quite an unmitigated disaster either.",2,so-so movie but hardly the disaster it's made out to be,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,1907,"['**1/2Based', 'Nickelodeon', 'series', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'mythical', 'world', 'where', 'four', 'types', 'people', 'special', 'powers', 'dwell', 'who', 'can', 'bend', 'air', 'Airbenders', 'who', 'can', 'bend', 'water', 'Waterbenders', 'who', 'can', 'bend', 'earth', 'Earthbenders', 'who', 'can', 'bend', 'fire', 'Firebenders', 'Then', 'one', 'very', 'special', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'four', 'messianic', 'figure', 'known', 'Avatar', 'who', 'alone', 'able', 'maintain', 'peace', 'order', 'otherwise', 'chaotic', 'world.Noah', 'Ringer', 'Aang', 'youthful', 'reincarnation', 'many', 'Avatars', 'who', 'preceded', 'However', 'Avatar', 'bit', 'reluctant', 'assume', 'title', 'thus', 'personal', 'responsibilities', 'sacrifices', 'come', 'Aang', 'soon', 'must', 'fulfill', 'duty', 'spiritual', 'leader', 'world', 'power-hungry', 'Firebenders', 'will', 'become', 'dictators', 'earth.The', 'movie', 'was', 'met', 'cacophony', 'outrage', 'when', 'was', 'released', '2010', 'way', 'almost', 'hate', 'add', 'voice', 'chorus', 'Airbender', '-bashers', 'suspect', 'vehemence', 'reaction', 'as', 'much', 'product', 'generalized', 'almost', 'irrational', 'hatred', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'will', 'start', 'out', 'positive', 'note', 'saying', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'premise', 'story', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', ""'m"", 'generally', 'not', 'must', 'say', 'were', 'forced', 'choose', ""'d"", 'opt', 'Narnia', 'films', 'day', 'about', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'willing', 'go', 'defense', 'work', 'ultimately', 'weight', 'derivative', 'frequently', 'incoherent', 'storytelling', 'wooden', 'performances', 'decent', 'unspectacular', 'special', 'effects.All', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'unmitigated', 'disaster']",The Last Airbender

1295821,A117KO8Q1KAEMY,B002VPE1BQ,"Roren Tarubetto ""Roren""","[2, 7]","Ugh, ugh, ugh. Why, why, why?? How could he screw this up so badly? I really wanted to like this movie. As a huge fan of the series the prospect of a movie was intriguing IF it was done right. M. Night Shyamalan, you have broken this fan's heart.For those unfamiliar with the Avatar, The Last Airbender series, the story revolves around the idea of a world divided into 4 nations - Air, Water, Earth, Fire, and the war waged by the latter element.  Within each of these nations are people with the ability to control their specific element, for example, Water tribe members are able to ""bend"" water, manipulating its form in multiple ways to form anything from walls of ice to projectile waterfalls. The Avatar is special because he or she has the power to control all 4 of these elements, as well as maintain a connection to the spirit world(because everything from trees to rivers has a spirit) to keep everything in balance.Problem is, the Avatar disappeared and has been missing for 100 years.  During that time, the Fire Nation perpetuated a war.  Knowing the next Avatar would be reincarnated into an airbender, the Fire Lord exterminated all of the Air Nomads and invaded smaller colonies of the other nations, leaving many in fear and without the hope of ever being freed from the Fire Nation's tyranny.  The Last Airbender's story is told 100 years after the disappearance of the last Avatar.  Whew, that was a mouth full.So where to begin - do I make comparisons of the movie and the TV show? Or do I give my opinion of the movie independently of the show. I think I'm incapable of separating the two so here goes.Fault number one: The age old issue, black versus white, or in this case, Brown vs White. Good guys are now White, and bad guys are now Brown. Not the way of the animated series, so why make such a blatant change?Fault number two: They changed the names, or more precisely the pronunciation of the names. What is M.Night Sham-uh-land, my new pronunciation for his name,trying to be authentic to?  Certainly not the wonderful animated series from which the story came. I will borrow an example from a friend ""It's like calling Darth Vader, Darth Vah-der"". Star Wars fans, Would you stand for this?! I didn't think so. Aang, Sokka, General Iroh, they all have been given the Sham-uh-land treatment.Fault number three: Would it have killed them to inject some lightheartedness? This movie is so melodramatic and slow with no relief. I know it is difficult to insert humor without it seeming contrived and corny, but it is possible, the show did it wonderfully.  I guess this speaks to Sham-uh-land's directing ability- he likes wood. Wooden characters. Wooden acting. Wooden delivery. Blah.Fault number four: Connection or lack there of. No friggin chemistry. Do I believe they care about each other? Eh, maybe a little.  Enough to die for each other? Nope.  And Appa?  Do we believe he and Aang are inseparable? Nope. I needed to believe in the camaraderie, but it was virtually non-existent.Fault number five: Complete girl dumb-down. Tell me why Sham-uh-land chose to give the smart dialogue that was originally spoken by Katara's character in the series, to the main male cast? More than once!!! C'mon!!I could go on and on. But I will end here with this - Fans of the television show will be disappointed with this film, from its mis-pronunciation of names and horrible dialogue to its pathetic attempt to sum up the first season of Avatar the Last Airbender  in 1 hour and 43 minutes (Really?). Movie-goers with no attachment to the series will simply be bored and confused.  EPIC FAIL  Mr. Shammy-land.Oh and I'm sure you're wondering about the effects. They were there, but the reason you cared before was because of the people executing the action.

I had never seen the animated series. I was bored one day, saw this movie and decided to watch it. I thought it was a really good movie. So if you want to know my opinion of the movie in an isolated environment by itself without considering anything else it is a good movie. So much so I watched it again a few weeks later with my family.Not to spoil anything but the movie leaves the story hanging. Obviously the intent was to follow the series by having the story in three parts (&#34;books&#34;). Not wanting to wait for the next movie (which is apparently a good thing since it seems no more will be made) I found the animated series and started watching it to get the rest of the story.Oh wow! The animated series completely blows the movie away. The series has a much better and deeper story. The acting is better. The characters are much more likable with more depth. Aang is completely different in the movie than he is in the series. To be honest I have no idea why he was changed so drastically as in the cartoon he is a very likable and entertaining kid.So if you want my overall opinion about Avatar The Last Airbender here it is. If you have never seen the animated series then you might like this movie. However if you want my honest advise I would suggest not bothering with the movie at all. If you have any interest in seeing the Avatar just go with the animated series. It is much more enjoyable and entertaining.If you have seen the animated series then you are probably not going to like this movie very much. I am glad that I saw the movie first otherwise I would have been very disappointed watching it. I do not see myself ever watching it again.

1295830,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B002VPE1BQ,S. Der,"[1, 9]","This movie kicks butt! I loved it! I watched the movie first and had an open opinion about it and just watched it for what it was. I loved learning about the characters, story, and just had a great time watching it.Others people did not do what I did. Instead most people, watched the cartoon first and was always comparing the movie to the cartoon. They went to the movie because they saw the cartoon and just wanted to see the cartoon in a live action movie. Well that's too bad, because that's not how or what the movie is. You want to watch the cartoon than watch the cartoon. You want to watch the movie than watch the movie. I don't know why, but people just don't understand why a movie cannot be the same exact thing from the the original source. If you look at every movie that came out from somewhere else first, then you will always see there were changes!!! I always watch movies for what they are and not compared them to the original sources. I never watch a movie and start thinking ""oh that's not how it should be"". I watch a movie for what it is! If I think it's good then it's good!On the other hand, I could see where these people are coming from now. I have watched all 3 books of the cartoon, but only after watching the movie first. The movie made me watch the cartoon because I wanted to know more. A long time ago, when I first heard about this cartoon, I thought it was just for kids and had no interest in it at all. I watched the movie and liked it and thought it had an awesome story going for it, so I checked out the cartoon. I understand all the changes they did with the movie now but that doesn't mean it was a bad thing.For example, the cartoon is good, but I didn't like all that humor they threw in there. The movie doesn't do that kid like humor and that's why I preferred the movie more. In a cartoon, you can have that kind of humor because it's made for little kids and that was for a 3 part series long. Now for the movie, there was no where enough time to do all that silly kid stuff. They have to move and tell you the whole story in a short time. It's not like they can have their sweat time showing you all these humor and you can keep on watching it every week. Nope. You come here to see a one time sit down movie. Also, the movie is for a wider audience. This movie wasn't just for little kids, but for teens and adults too! So, that's why I thought it was a great idea they didn't put in all those jokes and stayed far away from that stuff.If there is a second movie, I will watch it for sure. I heard it will be even more action and have even more special effects. I can't wait! :)-----------------------------------Updated: 03/27/2014I decided to revisit this review after so many years since I first watched it in the theaters. I still stand by my original review, but I decided to lower my grade for this movie. I can see now, why people didn't like it originally too. I learned that this movie was just the first of a 3 part series of movies, just like the cartoon. I didn't know that back then. So, I lower my grade for that.Another thing is, I thought they need to portray an Asian lead character. I understand now that Aang is really supposed to be Asian, and more specific I would say he should be Chinese. Why wasn't the lead Asian? I know there are a bunch of Asian male leads that could had been great for this role to cast. I don't care if the rest of the whole cast was filled of Asians. That doesn't matter to me. I want the lead to be Asian and would trade that for the whole cast to be whatever you like them to be. I'm going to take another grade down for that.Another thing was the bending of the elements movement. The characters do a too much movement just to bend anything in this movie. The only one that doesn't seem to do that often was Aang. If you look at the movie more closely, you can see earth benders, water benders, and fire benders really have to do a lot of hand, feet, and body movement just to do a little element bending. That's really dumb. It doesn't make that much  sense to me anymore. They should just do very little just like Aang to bend air. If he does a lot of movement then it's going to be a huge effect. That makes way more sense. So, I have to deduct another grade for this.Finally, I decided to change my initial grade from 5 stars to 1 star.

His ego was on full display as he butchered scene after scene of material that was handed to him on a silver platter. Nothing of the talent responsible for The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable is available here. His script has all the quality and remedial charm of a grade school project.Fans of the cartoon know the story very well: Aang, a child monk from the Air Nation, accidentally freezes himself in ice. When he's revived 100 years later by two water tribe kids, Katara and Sokka, he discovers that the Air Nation has been wiped out by the Fire Nation making him the Last Airbender. He is doggedly pursued by banished Fire Nation prince Zuko, who is not only hunting the Avatar, but his honor and the love and acceptance of his father as well. The cast of characters experience many adventures over the course of this first book. Some of these episodes are one-offs, others push the season one story arc forward. Despite the heavy responsibility plaguing Aang and his friends, the stories are often interwoven with elements of comedy and irony to show that while the weight of the world rests upon them all...they're still just goofy kids.None of this is in M. Night's script. He stripped away most of the light-hearted elements to the story. They're occasionally thrown in almost as an aside. As if he'd forgotten that the show was also pretty funny. The script is chock full of expository writing. Katara narrates everything from their location to their emtotion, as M. Night jump cuts from one action scene to the next. It's overly serious and dreadfully overacted. Noah Ringer delivers his lines like a comedian performing a really bad William Shatner impersonation. I understand he's a kid, which is why I blame M. Night. I've never made a movie, but after one screen test or rehersal I'd know immediately that Aang needed to be re-cast. The martial arts, which was such an impressive element of the cartoon, was agonizingly over-choreographed. M. Night should be ashamed of himself. Instead of pretending the movie is some sort of artistic vision, he should just man up and own this pile of garbage.

1295833,A21SVQPB3BMIZO,B002VPE1BQ,Shadow Walker,"[20, 28]","I'd like to make it clear that I am NOT a fan of the cartoon series. I need to say that right off the bat so that people can't accuse me of being a disgruntled fangirl/boy. ;) Now that that's out of the way...The Last Airbender is about the titular Aang, who - in addition to being the last airbender - is also the Avatar, capable of manipulating the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water). Aang is on a journey to free the rest of the world from the grip of the oppressive Fire Nation. On the way, he is joined by pals Katara (a waterbender) and Katara's brother, Sokka. Meanwhile, the exiled Fire Nation prince Zuko is out to capture Aang in an attempt to get back in his father's good graces.All of the critics blasting this movie are spot on. Everything about The Last Airbender is dreadful. The costumes - Aang's especially - look like something you'd wear on Halloween. The dialogue is stilted beyond belief, and the amateurish acting (especially from Nicola, Noah, and Jackson) doesn't help. I don't know whether I should blame the actors themselves for that, or M. Night Shyamalan for doing a lousy job of directing them. After all, Nicola and Noah are just kids and haven't had a lot of experience yet. I'm not as willing to give a pass to Jackson, as I've seen him in the Twilight movies and he's just as bad in those. Someone needs to tell him that looking constipated is not a valid acting choice.The movie is narrated by Katara, which gets tiresome very quickly. Shyamalan uses narration as a cheap substitute for any sort of character development whatsoever. For example, when Aang and crew arrive at the Northern Watern Tribe, Sokka makes eyes with Yue, the Water Tribe princess. Katara's voiceover then says something like, ""Sokka and Yue became fast friends,"" and then - BAM! - the next scene is of Sokka and Yue strolling along all buddy-buddy. We don't get to actually SEE Sokka and Yue becoming friends, we just have to take Katara's word for it. That's not good writing. I realize that Shyamalan was in a tricky spot, because he had to compress an entire season into one two-hour movie. Still...would it have hurt him to expend a bit more effort so that the storyline didn't seem as rushed and sloppy as it ended up being?What upsets me the most however isn't how much the movie sucks from a technical and/or acting perspective, but how it is a modern emblem of Hollywood's systematic racism and bias. The series was steeped in Asian and Inuit culture and as far as I could tell, there were hardly any white people in the cartoon, at least not in any substantial roles*. So what was up with the three white kids - yes, I know that it has very recently come out that Noah actually has American Indian heritage, but Paramount was certainly treating him as white in the past - being cast as the heroes? Katara and Sokka were the two darkest-skinned characters in the show, so how on earth does it make sense that they are the palest people in the movie? Whereas the villain Zuko is actually very pale in the cartoon and yet in the movie he's been made unambiguously brown. So basically this whole movie is about the good white saviors fighting against the evil brown people who want to oppress us all. AWESOME.Defenders like to say that casting white actors is okay, because Avatar doesn't take place in the real world. ""There is no Asia,"" they say. And technically, that's correct. However, when everything else about this fantasy world - the settings, the clothes, the buildings, the writing, etc. - takes its cues from Asian and Inuit culture, then it serves to follow that the people would follow suit. Why is it that white is considered the default just because no race is explicitly mentioned? How messed up is that?Re: the pronunciation of the names - I wouldn't have really cared about how Shyamalan chose to have the names pronounced, except I think it shows his hypocrisy. So he cares enough to stay true to the show's Asian/Inuit roots by making the names less Anglicized, but doesn't care enough to cast non-white people? I don't think one can defend the name pronunciation and the whitewashing at the same time. The two directly conflict with each other. You can't say, ""But there was no Asia, so who cares if white people were cast?"" and then turn around and say, ""It makes sense that Shyamalan changed the names; after all, that's how the names are actually pronounced in Asian languages!"" At least, not without looking like a total fool. (Also, here's a sidenote: *What* Asian languages? People do realize that Asian languages are very different from each other, right? Korean does not sound like Chinese.)All in all, I am angry and disappointed with this movie. It had such promise, and Paramount squandered it. I can only hope that it doesn't get a sequel.* If I am mistaken, someone please let me know! Like I said, I'm not a fan of the cartoon and only sat down to watch it when I heard about the casting controversy. And don't tell me that Aang counts because he 'looks' white. Anybody who says that clearly doesn't know anything about anime style conventions.",1,a million critics can't be wrong...,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,5104,"[""'d"", 'like', 'make', 'clear', 'am',

1295834,A1NIN3C7LE1AUY,B002VPE1BQ,shardinea,"[2, 4]","So, like probably a lot of people, I watched the trailer first and thought it looked pretty amazing. Even after people told me it was bad, I just had to watch it for myself to make sure. After all, I liked Prince of Persia and a lot of people hated that. In this case, the low ratings are completely justified.I graduated with a degree in film and animation, so I'm already a critical person when it comes to movies, and I can tell you pretty much everything that was wrong with this one. To start out with, Sokka, the comic relief, wasn't comic relief. This may not sound like a big deal, but it is, especially when coupled with the horrible acting from Zuko's actor. The only semi-good actor in the entire movie was probably the boy who played Aang. The movie relied too much on flashbacks and expositions from random, non-related characters to propel the story forward, which not only made it strange and unbelievable, but slowed the story down. The film totally lacked every ounce of ""give a crap"" that was needed to actually be a successful film.  And even if you didn't watch the anime, this film would still be awful. It was so obvious that the film's budget was thrown down a hole. I give props to the color grading department and some of the video and trailer editors in this film. They were the only ones who did their jobs. The rest have a lot to learn.The structure of this film, which should've been covered with beautiful lighting, visual effects, and creative camera moves, shown through with the lack-there-of like a sore thumb. I'll start with the green screen.  In any good fantasy, sci-fi, adventure type movie/tv series, green screen is a valuable asset that's sewn into the film seamlessly to provide a more interesting surrounding.  If done badly, this surrounding will look artificial, and will take you out of the movie entirely.  This movie is the later. The animation and use of the green screen was done so poorly that you could see the outlines of the characters where they met the background, not to mention that the lighting used on the actor and the lighting used in the background were not merged, making them look like they belonged to two entirely different environments. The visual effects weren't in themselves all bad (probably because visual effects by nature are contracted out to other companies), but were totally misplaced. There was never any climax to any of the battles, and fights often went on without using any kind of bending, made even more distracting in scenes where you knew bending was supposed to be taking place.  This was especially evident when we saw a scene where fire bending was supposed to be taking place, and though it began with effects, it ended with none. The acting was cheesy at best, and totally exaggerated almost all the time. There was also no variety in the ethnicity of the actors, nor did much of the cast even look like the original characters. The effort wasn't even really made to attempt to make them look the part, save maybe the costuming department.  It was written horribly, and because there was no one else there to correct M. Night Shyamalan, edit his script or horn in on his decision making (him being the writer, director, and producer of the film), it was no wonder the film turned out as bad as it did.

1295837,A392BGTO28EN6V,B002VPE1BQ,"S. Jenkins ""Arshes Nei""","[8, 16]","Yeah, another reviewer complaining about this movie.I understand how difficult it can be adapting a movie from different source material, especially when you have a lot of it.Let's take a look at a movie like Jurassic Park, it took the premise of the book and made it something completely different but it was still enjoyable. Yes the book was better, but we saw amazing dinosaurs, the movie made them amazing and we were entertained and thrilled.Here we have a cartoon that spanned 3 seasons and a great storyline.I don't expect a movie to be able to cover all the material as there were a lot of episodes, but not only was the tone of the cartoon which had a lot of humor and coming of age issues changed, personality with the characters were lost entirely.It's one thing to change the personality and we can argue about that, but the problem was THERE WAS NO PERSONALITY.If he had been smart, Shyamalan could have done the first part of Book 1 for water (leaving the Battle at the Northern Water Tribe for a sequel) and established, CHARACTERIZATION, made even more at the box office and justified a very good reason to instead of having the green light of 3 movies up to 6 films.Many times I was left confused as to what was going on, even though I watched the cartoon series.One of my biggest beefs with the film is that I know there is a lot to tell but they relay this information in the most boring way possible. A good example is when Sokka meets the Princess and asks about her hair. We could have had a flashback or something that showed this amazing occurrence. I mean, her hair is WHITE and there's a story behind it! Wouldn't you WANT to see it? Instead she read her lines, like she had to complete an essay for her school project. In fact, while she's talking about her HAIR and the impact of it, let's just zoom in on the eyes!You know this awesome avatar warrior named Kiyoshi, hey Aang you're related. ""She liked to play games!"" That's how awesome she was...huh? I'm not kidding you, this was how she was explained as an awesome avatar.One other odd thing bothered me is Shyamalan's ego was very present in the Fire Nation. They all looked like clones of him. You could have switched the actors for Ozai - who is supposed to be this intimidating villain who is also Zuko's father who can easily switch places for the guy who is supposed to be the ""slimy politician"". You don't feel a real threat, you feel like you're in the Afterschool version of the Fantasy Oriented ""White House"". They all looked alike, no real scope of characterization or design in this movie.With the exception of Clone Wars...I mean Fire Nation. The casting was so haphazard and random. We got a random Black looking dude as a Monk. Some White people who are supposed to look related to their nation brother and sisters which are ASIAN in the background ...wut? Some guy who didn't look related to his sister, but rather he looked related to a reptile or amphibian that was ready to lash his tongue out and catch a fly (Yes, I'm talking about Sokka's actor!). The leader of the Southern Water tribe looked like they snagged him off the Harry Potter set and threw him in blue clothes, and looking severely out of place with the other characters. Iroh with his strong Iranian accent is related to the Fire Nation? huh?The fight scenes were shot in a boring manner possible. In fact, I felt like I was watching a Universal Studios on stage performance. The cinematography was canned. I just felt claustrophobic and boxed in instead of being shown large and lush nations. In fact, you may was well put the various nations in an Apartment Complex and shot it that way. The problem with the bending, was that the movements and the bending weren't done in conjunction. It looked like someone put out a dance move from Billy Banks Tae Bo, then the effect came later. It made the effects look like an afterthought. It was essentially Taekwondo spell casting without the amazing.I could go on with much more, but I wanted to note and kill any arguments in defense of changing the characters names. It's one thing to claim to change them to sound ""more Asian"" but when your actors cannot for one film use CONSISTENT pronunciation in a 2hr movie where a cartoon did it for over 60, you have no excuse.I've heard a long ""Ung"" for Ang to ""Ahng"" I've heard ""ahhh-vatar"" to long A sounding ""avatar"" with various cast members in that film. So yeah, not buying that or this movie.It's terrible and can't stand on its own unless you're one of those brainless zombies that just like seeing stuff flash across your screen in the most mediocre

1295841,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B002VPE1BQ,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[2, 3]","There are a lot of people out there dragging this movie over the coals. Most, if not all, of them do so in comparing this movie with the cartoon it was based on. While I am an avid fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender on Nickelodeon over the years I have come to an understanding regarding how movies compare with the material they are based, whether it be from a book, TV show, video game or whatever. Rule number one: Movies are NOT, and will never be, the same as TV shows, book, video games or whatever. Totally different media and totally different format. I have learned to never based my expectations on a movie based on what was previously done with the material. That being said The Last Airbender is a weak film that looks pretty good from an aesthetic standpoint now and then, but is a mess in many other ways.M. Night Shyamalan used to be one of those great directors that made interesting movies with a dynamic that was a signature all his own. Now granted I have only seen his first four films and liked every one (including The Village, but I admit it's not him in peak form). Also granted is the films he has made since (that I haven't seen) have been critical and theatrical disappointments, yet I cannot judge what I haven't seen (after all I thought The Village was pretty good). However when I see The Last Airbender I see very, very little of what Shyamalan was known for and see more of what I expect from ""other"" Hollywood directors. Lets breakdown the issues, and since the link between the movie and cartoon are undeniable we'll address that too.One of the issues so many people seem to have a beef about is the actors and how they do jibe visually with their cartoon counterparts. To me this is a non-issue. This is a different version after all. How many people complained that Jean Claude Van Damme doesn't look like Guile from Street Fighter (how many people actually watched that film?)? How many people made an issue about I Am Legend's main character going from white to black, being contrary to both the book and films that came before based on it? Better yet how many people said anything about Heath Ledger's Joker not really fitting the comic's version of the character? My point is casting is the least of issues to worry about, even if they seem more contrary to what you are used to.Now the characters in regards to the movie I don't find bad at all. At least not in casting. The water tribe characters have the same general feel as the cartoon, even if the ethnicity is not right. Same for Ang. Seychelle Gabriel is the spitting image of Princess Yue so there should be absolutely no complaints there. The biggest difference is with the fire nation characters, but there is mostly consistency there so I'll give them those changes. As far as character development I have no real complaints here. It's not the characters development where I see the issue, and the actors played their parts adequately.The next big issue everybody seems to have with the movie is the fact they try to compact and entire season of half hour cartoon episodes into a single feature film. In concept that can work as long as you trim lots of the side stories and focus on only a few of the major watermarks of the season. This is where the movie fails in. It tries to tie in way too many elements of the cartoon, which ultimately makes the film feel buggy and awkward. Scenes were put in that detract from the main theme. Even if those scenes are considered major events in the cartoon all they did was burden the movie with needless exposition and muck up the pacing. To me it feels like only people who saw the cartoon can follow the plot of this movie. A good 30 minutes of movie script could have been cut out and repurposed to expand on the more vital plot elements. This, to me, is Shyamalan's greatest shortcoming in this film.The Last Airbender is essentially a martial arts film so this aspect needs to take as much scrutiny as the rest. How can I say this? It's ultimately serviceable. You see some really nice form when individual characters are doing their thing, but when there is hand to hand combat it just doesn't feel like it's connecting right. The cropping of the martial arts also his a few misses. Some only show upper torsos and no foot work. A few parts of the fight choreography were just plain weak as you can definitely see no physical contact. This is where good camera angles can pay off.The look and feel of the movie I have to admit is pretty polished, if still flawed. Camera placement/angling, colors and sets all are pretty solid and creative. I never saw this movie in theaters and especially not in 3D. I am told the 3D version actually made the movie look worse because it darkened the scenes too much. Some of the scenes I saw on the Blu-Ray looked great as they were, but I can imagine how bad it would have been when affected by the 3D post-production. There is ample use of CGI in the effects and other animations, which isn't necessarily bad, but it doesn't wow you as much as it feels overdone. The effects themselves are functional, but not really impressive.The music is utterly forgettable. No themes to hold you. No musical dynamic that goes beyond being something to keep the background noise more interesting than... well... silence. I'm betting the score was done on synthesizers with no traditional orchestra. It sounds that bland. Audio, like dialog and atmospheric stuff, on the other hand was pretty tight.The single disk Blu-Ray looks really good. Details are sharp and impressive and the colors blend well. Audio was well balanced too with the center channel not being drowned out. The special features are kind of sparse on this one. All you get is The Origins of the Avatar, which is a short interview with the creators of the cartoon talking about how the concept came about; Deleted scenes that were well deserved to be taken out of the movie (maybe one part of one scene seemed interesting); and a gag reel with the actors cutting up a bit (Noah Ringer dances the robot, Jackson Rathbone makes funny mistakes, etc). It's essentially all the stuff you get on the single disk DVD version. The two disk Blu-Ray has the good stuff on it, but why not here? I hear the other bonuses are on the single disk with the movie. Why not just add them to the single disk release too?The Last Airbender is a flawed movie, if an admittedly pretty one. I think your standard popcorn eating crowd who enjoys light spectacle will actually enjoy this movie. If you are looking for a deeper story with good pacing this won't really cover it. If you are a fan of the cartoon it's going to depend on how much of a purist you are will depend on how much you get out of it. As a fan that saw the movie with an open mind I saw nods to the series that I appreciated; even if I still don't think the movie was all that good.",3,I agree with most of the consensus. Not that great of a movie.,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,6870,"['are', 'lot', 'people', 'there', 'dragging', 'movie', 'coals', 'Most', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'comparing', 'movie', 'cartoon', 'was',

M Night Shyamalan does not seem to understand that there is a difference between an homage and a turd, and that there's an even bigger difference between creative freedom and hocking a big juicy loogie on the original. This movie will leave a bitter taste in the mouth of any ATLA fan, and for those who don't know the series, it's still a pretty bad film. While there are some pretty decent special effects, it's not enough to save this movie; not even close. The acting, the dialogue, and the casting are so off it's almost funny. I wanted to laugh at the ""bending"" that Shyamalan attempted to recreate for us, but I could only grimace. Now I know this movie already has enough hate as it is, so I'll try to keep this short. I could not, for the life of me, sit through this movie. I rented it from the DVD machine at my university to see what all the fuss was about, but now I wish I hadn't. I mean, this movie is a joke! I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't for the fact that so many people are to be introduced to the series this way. If you've seen the movie and it's turned you off of the series, please reconsider! The show is spectacular, and fans are banding together to defend it now that M Night's little project has done its damage. The movie is completely different; it leaves out way too much and adds way too much at the same time. As I said before, it's not the kind of creative freedom or unique adaptation fans hoped for. While my expectations were low to begin with, I was sorely disappointed with this film. Just don't watch it if ya know what's good for ya.

1295845,A17M1HL6U2GS7M,B002VPE1BQ,Storylover,"[4, 7]","I'll start with the most important sentence: My kids loved this movie, so if were rating it just for them, this would be 5 big big stars.  We had watched the entire air bender series as a family, and I went from bored to interested to fascinated to just as excited as my kids to watch the next episode.  The anime series has surprisingly complex character development, complicated stories built around easily understood episodes, and a real message of hope, redemption (for multiple people), and saving the world!  I was certain that there was no way that a movie could capture what the series had done.I was right--the movie didn't capture what the series did.  But it isn't fair to expect that--the series had 10+ hours to cover the material that the movie covers.  M. Night and Co. had a daunting task to try to pull that breadth of storytelling into a cohesive not quite two hour movie, and I have to say that they did it.  If you expect every twist and turn of the series to be here, you will be sadly disappointed.  What you will get is the important emotional beats to be hit, you will get character development, you will get engaging performances by young actors, and really enjoyable special effects.  If you approach this movie like a retelling of a legend you already know, and you won't be disappointed.Let's talk a little about the script.  Some have complained that it is hard to follow--because I knew the series well, the story was easy to follow, but I understand how those who are not familiar with the story might have felt that some things seemed to jump a bit.  They do.  They also did in Harry Potter 1 when Chris Colombus did it--but the movie was still enjoyable on its own.  Don't approach this rigidly--be willing to let it wash over you somewhat.  The children do a really wonderful job.  They are not veteran actors, and they make some choices that a veteran actor would have avoided.  But they bring an excitement, a freshness to the roles that is perfect.  The young man who plays Aang and the young lady who plays Kitara in particular do a wonderful job.  I loved seeing these folks come to life, and if they weren't as complex as the cartoon characters, remember, they are trying to do this in 1/5th the screen time.  Pretty impressive job overall.  Aang is very likable and quite a charmer.  He must have had signficant martial arts training ahead of time, because he is very impressive in the action sequences.The movements that bring about the ""bending"" are beautiful.  The entire film is full of asian/eastern cultural references, so from a spiritual perspective, if Buddhist or Taoist inspired elements offend you or are something you want to keep your kids away from, then avoid this film at all costs.  If you are willing to discuss the spiritual aspects with your children from whatever spiritual direction you come, then this will actually provide a rewarding platform.  Just because I don't particularly admire a spiritual choice doesn't mean that it can't add interest to a fantasy story--and for those who do like the eastern philosophy, I think that there is a lot to enjoy here as long as you aren't looking for the endorsement of a single philosophy, but are willing to take the ride to get a blend of sort of pan-asian things.The special effects are top notch.  The air, fire, and water are all amazing (not much earth moving in this film).  The sets are gorgeous, and if some of them look highly stylized and fantastic, well, it is a fantasy world.  Momo is a delight, but losing much of his story line made me sad, even if I understood how it was a good thing to cut.  Apa was fun, and just as I had hoped.  THe bad guys had just the right tone--Prince Suko (I'm not sure if I spelled that right) seemed a little older than I had expected, but his mixture of misplaced loyalty to his unloving father, his desperation to gain his honor and to win the love of a parent was just right.  His uncle was cast against type from the cartoon, but the actor pulled it off well, and after my first apprehension that htey had gotten it wrong, I was pleased.  I didn't love general zhao or the Firelord, but I don't hink I was supposed to love them.  The water princess was adorable, and the scenes between Jackson Rathbone (Sato) and her were great.I really enjoyed this film quite a bit.  As I mentioned, my kids loved it, and it has been playing every night since we got it.  If you are in the need of this sort of family adventure, it will fit the bill, and I definitely hope that M. Night will get to make the other two and turn this into the heroic trilogy we know it to be.",4,"Engaging, warm hearted, reasonable adaptation of the series, my kids really loved it",1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,4617,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'most', 'important', 'sentence', 'kids', 'loved', 'movie', 'so', 'were', 'rating', 'just', 'would', 'be', '5', 'big', 'big', 'stars', 'had', 'watched', 'entire', 'air', 'bender', 'series', 'family', 'went', 'bored', 'interested', 'fascinated', 'just', 'as', 'excited', 'kids', 'watch', 'next', 'episode', 'anime', 'series', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'character', 'development', 'complicated', 'stories', 'built', 'easily', 'understood', 'episodes', 'real', 'message', 'hope', 'redemption', 'multiple', 'people', 'saving', 'world', 'was', 'certain', 'was', 'way', 'movie', 'could', 'capture', 'what', 'series', 'had', 'done.I', 'was', 'right', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'what', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'fair', 'expect', 'series', 'had', '10+', 'hours', 'cover', 'material', 'movie', 'M.', 'Night', 'Co.', 'had', 'daunting', 'task', 'try', 'pull', 'breadth', 'storytelling', 'cohesive', 'not', 'quite', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'did', 'expect', 'twist', 'turn', 'series', 'be', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'What', 'will', 'get', 'important', 'emotional', 'beats', 'be', 'hit', 'will', 'get', 'character', 'development', 'will', 'get', 'engaging', 'performances', 'young', 'actors', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'special', 'effects', 'approach', 'movie', 'retelling', 'legend', 'already', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Let', 'talk', 'little', 'script', 'have', 'complained', 'hard', 'follow', 'knew', 'series', 'well', 'story', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'understand', 'how', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'felt', 'things', 'seemed', 'jump', 'bit', 'do', 'also', 'did', 'Harry', 'Potter', '1', 'when', 'Chris', 'Colombus', 'did', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'Do', ""n't"", 'approach', 'rigidly', 'be', 'willing', 'let', 'wash', 'somewhat', 'children', 'do', 'really', 'wonderful', 'job', 'are', 'not', 'veteran', 'actors', 'make', 'choices', 'veteran', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'avoided', 'bring', 'excitement', 'freshness', 'roles', 'perfect', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Aang', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'Kitara', 'particular', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'loved', 'seeing', 'folks', 'come', 'life', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'complex', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'remember', 'are', 'trying', 'do', '1/5th', 'screen', 'time', 'Pretty', 'impressive', 'job', 'overall', 'Aang', 'very', 'likable', 'quite', 'charmer', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'signficant', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'ahead', 'time', 'very', 'impressive', 'action', 'sequences.The', 'movements', 'bring', 'bending', 'are', 'beautiful', 'entire', 'film', 'full', 'asian/eastern', 'cultural', 'references', 'so', 'spiritual', 'perspective', 'Buddhist', 'Taoist', 'inspired', 'elements', 'offend', 'are', 'something', 'want', 'keep', 'kids', 'away', 'then', 'avoid', 'film', 'costs', 'are', 'willing', 'discuss', 'spiritual', 'aspects', 'children', 'spiritual', 'direction', 'come', 'then', 'will', 'actually', 'provide', 'rewarding', 'platform', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'admire', 'spiritual', 'choice', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'interest', 'fantasy', 'story', 'who', 'do', 'eastern', 'philosophy', 'think', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'here', 'as', 'long', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'endorsement', 'single', 'philosophy', 'are', 'willing', 'take', 'ride', 'get', 'blend', 'sort', 'pan-asian', 'things.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'air', 'fire', 'water', 'are', 'amazing', 'not', 'much', 'earth', 'moving', 'film', 'sets', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'highly', 'stylized', 'fantastic', 'well', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Momo', 'delight', 'losing', 'much', 'story', 'line', 'made', 'sad', 'even', 'understood', 'how', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'cut', 'Apa', 'was', 'fun', 'just', 'had', 'hoped', 'THe', 'bad', 'guys', 'had', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'Prince', 'Suko', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'spelled', 'right', 'seemed', 'little', 'older', 'had', 'expected', 'mixture', 'misplaced', 'loyalty', 'unloving', 'father', 'desperation', 'gain', 'honor', 'win', 'love', 'parent', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'uncle', 'was', 'cast', 'type', 'cartoon', 'actor', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'first', 'apprehension', 'htey', 'had', 'gotten', 'wrong', 'was', 'pleased', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'general', 'zhao', 'Firelord', 'do', ""n't"", 'hink', 'was', 'supposed', 'love', 'water', 'princess', 'was', 'adorable', 'scenes', 'Jackson', 'Rathbone', 'Sato', 'were', 'great.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'mentioned', 'kids', 'loved', 'been', 'playing', 'night', 'got', 'are', 'need', 'sort', 'family', 'adventure', 'will', 'fit', 'bill', 'definitely', 'hope', 'M.', 'Night', 'will', 'get', 'make', 'other', 'two', 'turn', 'heroic', 'trilogy', 'know', 'be']",The Last Airbender

1295847,A2XL87EAC6CQYE,B002VPE1BQ,SuperT,"[20, 32]","This is a movie that might be fun to watch if you have nothing to do, live near a movie theater, and need a little special effects-style action. But if you are looking for a movie with relatable, developing characters, comprehensible plot, or decent 3-D effects, I would strongly suggest seeing another movie.The Good:-The special effects are pretty well done, especially the little details in the ladscapes.-There is decent action.The Bad:-The 3-D is terrible! During the previews before the movie started, things flew right off the screen and into your face. However, when this movie started anything that popped out only came about two inches off the screen. Through most of the movie I could take my glasses off and tell no difference. (Which I did.) Do not see this movie in 3-D. It costs more and just gets in the way.-The characters have practically no personality traits. I think throughout the whole movie only two characters have even one noticable trait that can seperate them from the other characters.Also, there is no character development. For example (spoilers) two characters see each other in one scene and talk for a minute and a half in another. Then the narrator says ""they are in love"". Then, when the girl dies, the audience is supposed to feel a deep sorrow for the boy who lost his love. But we didn't SEE them fall in love, did we? That makes it harder to connect with them.-The acting is hollow and there is no real emotion. Also, it is very easy to tell when the actors were performing in front of a blue screen, because they make forced reactions and seem to not really know what is is they are reacting to.-The plot is incredibly complicated. Although the characters (quite annoyingly) repeat plot points several times, they are adding nothing to the fact that nobody can understand what they are saying in the first place. I didn't understand what was going on until halfway into the movie.-There is almost no humor. The movie takes itself WAY too seriously.

The movie tried to fit the entire first season of the series into a 2-hr movie which made for a break-neck pace, but was oddly boring. It gave no time to flesh out the characters so the viewer has no reason to care. On top of that, I'm really unsure who to blame for the horrid acting. Most of the actors were newish so I can understand why they had a difficult time. However, if you've seen The Happening you know that M. Night Shyamalan has a history of giving poor direction to his actors so it's more than likely his fault.Speaking of Mr. Shama-lama-ding-dong, he once again proved that he should not be allowed anywhere near a script. He absolutely OBLITERATED it! If you have not seen the series, you will most like have no FREAKING idea what the hell is going on. He makes the story that unintelligible. They have also turned it into a race war. The fire nation was Indian while all the other nations looked Caucasian. Not a huge deal but it was completely unnecessary. The only thing that shined through this piece of crap was the visuals. The bending was nice to look at, but they couldn't even get that right. They would do a martial arts ""dance"" for like 5 mins before anything (water, earth, fire or air) started to move.

This movie has that potential.I liked the movie in spite of its short comings. I have not seen the Avatar cartoon, which may be why I over rate this as compared to die-hard cartoon fans. I have been a big fan of the early RPGs until my PS-1 died.The world consists of a number of spirits which create harmony (moon spirit, dragon spirit etc.). Mankind in divided into four nations, each of which controls one of the 4 elements, water and Earth, Wind & Fire. Each element has its own spirit too. Each Nation has people who can control their specific element. The are called ""benders."" There is one person, and only one person in all the world who can control all 4 elements, that is the Avatar. The Avatar spirit always lives and is passed on, or reincarnated in every generation.In this movie, the Avatar originated from the Air Bender nation. However, he didn't want to be an Avatar because of the self sacrifice so he ran away before he could learn all of his skills and powers. He ended up encased in a block of ice in the southern world, only to be ""rescued"" a 100 years later. During that 100 years, the Fire Nation and their machines have taken over the planet. They symbolically represent civilization destroying the planet and ruining the harmony of nature. The Air Bender must learn to master the other 3 elements in order to become a complete Avatar. This is his quest in the movie. Once he does that he can save the planet from the Fire Nation. He is capable of going into a deep trance and talks to the dragon spirit for advice.Now to make this movie slightly more complicated there is friction within the Fire Nation. The king has disowned his son (a Fire Bender played by Dev Patel, who was a good guy and bad actor in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" now is simply bad all around.) The son is tasked to bring the would-be Avatar to the king to prove his worth. At the same time, the evil fire general, (Noah Ringer, who is great on Comedy Central but stinks in Air Bender) is trying to bring back the Avatar also.The acting wasn't solid.

I thought the movie was ok at best but it was enough to convince myself to watch the cartoon was a billion times better. The action was good in some scenes, especcialy the visual affects. But it was a mistake in make a movie based on the first season of a popular cartoon because to make it around 90 minutes, they left out a lot of important stuff from the show (The Kyoshi warriors, more on the Avatar itself) and so much more)A good thing for M. Night Shyamalan, this was his best film in a while which isnt saying much as since Signs his films have been horrible. The actors they chose werent that good. But a key was the fact they removed all of the fun of the series and replaced it with a serious tone.The only special features are:*4 Deleted scenes*Origins of Avatar*Gag reel (makes no sense since the whole movie was mainly a joke)They did get some things right, I wouldnt buy this, rent it if you are a fan of the show..but most likely you'll be disapointed. Probably it will be best if you see this first then start watching the show so you wont be disapointed right away.I will watch the most likely sequels but unless they make major changes from the tone of this movie, it will fail.Pros:-Was good enough to convince me to watch the cartoon-Still kind of M.

I can't express how highly anticipated this film was for our family because we've logged serious quality time watching some of our favorite characters ... over and over ... and over.  The anticipation was comparable to that felt by my fellow Star Wars fans in 1999 when G. Lucas delivered Jar Jar (who i blame for the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Sith).  Thanks, George, for nothing.M. Night Shyamalan had it all.  A great story line, a lot of material to draw from, and some amazing characters which grew on every one of us fans.  And what does he deliver, angry trees.  Oh, sorry, that was a different movie.  He delivers something that had me holding my tongue so I wouldn't spoil the movie for my children and wife.

Don't believe what the trailers make it look like, because any movie can make a great trailer as long as it has at least 2 minutes of good footage. This movie is impressive from a production values standpoint-- the costumes, sets, visual effects, etc. are all wonderfully done, and in the hands of a competent director and paired with an intelligent script could have made for a great film. Unfortunately, Shyamalan seems to waste virtually every resource he had at his disposal, making what is quite possible the most amateurish film of his entire career.Much ado has been made by certain sects of the internet over the casting of caucasian actors in roles that were once accepted by many to be minorities, but this movie has much bigger problems to worry about than whether or not the water tribes have dark skin. No matter who they cast in these roles, this movie would have been just as disappointing, and the only thing that could have been done differently to make it good would have been to keep M. Night Shaymalan as far away from it as possible and replace him with a director who actually understands how to make an epic fantasy with action scenes. This movie is like watching kids playing in the back yard with sticks, except with a hundred million dollars of production value slapped over it. Most of the action is bland and poorly choreographed, and even the camera work is dodgy and at times resembles a home movie.Shyamalan had no excuse for why this movie turned out bad, other than because he's completely lost his sense of what a good movie is. This movie would actually be the year's best unintentional comedy if I didn't love the source material, and hadn't walked in walk in hoping desperately that the critics were wrong. Apparently, a lot of fans felt that way, because otherwise this horrible movie would not have made 300 million dollars.

1295860,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002VPE1BQ,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[5, 9]","Movie - 1.0Water.. Earth.. Fire.. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed when a girl and her brother discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills were great, he still had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone. But she believed Aang could save the world. This first chapter of Avatar: The Last Airbender follows Aang, Katara, and Sokka on their journey around the globe. As they travel, they run into many adventures, people, and events along the way that would go on to shape them not only as warriors to bring peace and balance back to the four nations, but also evolve as people. In pursuit is Prince Zuko, banished son of the Fire Nation who is obsessed in capturing the Avatar to restore his lost honor, and with him is his ever-loving uncle, Iroh, who serves as Zuko's conscience, voice of reason, and occasional recommender of tea. Traveling about on Aang's Air Bison, Appa, and with his old flying lemur temple buddy, Momo, the ""Aang gang"" proceed to the Northern Water Tribe in an effort to teach the Avatar mastery of his first element -- water. What makes the Avatar franchise so great is its amazing ability to tell an epic fantasy story full of diverse characters. Be it the goofy, often funny smart-ass remarks and one-liners of Sokka, the nurturing and maternal instincts of Katara, the silly and innocent playfulness of Aang, a boy who didn't even want the weight of the world on his shoulders in the first place, the conflicting choices of right and wrong within the tempestuous Zuko, or the whimsical words of wisdom from his uncle that would ultimately be the difference maker, one can't deny the existence of some level of empathy, entertainment, or joy from their interactions and experiences. And that's not even mentioning the excellent wushu-based elemental-bending choreography, the rousing score, tons of comedic, dramatic, and storytelling elements, and all rolled up into a presentation reminiscent of anime. By the way, this movie has none of that.Instead, we get this: The director of The Happening put together a movie starring this kid with big nostrils who's released from a giant iceberg by some cute girl and her Twilight vampire brother given a movie name derived from a water gun only to find out that Big-nostril Kid is the Avatar whose name sounds like the broken ending sound of a deaf person trying to speak. All of a sudden, the Slumdog Millionaire and his uncle who saved Tony Stark two years earlier spot the beam of light where the Avatar was freed. In getting to the village, the much taller Slumdog Millionaire grabs Big-nostril Kid and threatens to burn the place down if he doesn't go willingly. When Big-nostril Kid escapes the boat he, the cute chick, and Twlighty go to visit the old Air Temple he used to live at only to find everybody's been turned into the biodegradable aftermath of one Dexter Morgan's handiwork. Big-nostril Kid screams ""noooo~!,"" lights up, produces some fine Low Frequency Effects from within the sub-woofer then calms down after 30 seconds of dialogue from the cute girl. After that, the cute girl and unfunny brother make up their minds without any hesitation or emotional motivation whatsoever to accompany the Avatar to the Northern Water Tribe where he will inexplicably learn water bending from that one priest in Constantine. On their way, they save an Earth Kingdom village while showcasing the film's one and only comedic moment and then proceed to display the slow, Matrix-like speed of their martial arts dancing/bending. In the process, Big-nostril Kid gets captured after being tricked by the tattoo artist in Ninja Assassin only to be rescued by a guy dressed as the demon version of Troy Polamalu. Angered by constant setbacks in the war, the Fire Lord who had ironically been disintegrated on the Icarus 1 some three years back comes up with a plan to take the Northern Water Tribe. But Big-nostril Kid had an unestablished epiphany, scared the Indians away, and everyone was unified.. just.. like.. that. The film ends with a grinning girl who seemed way too happy to have been cast in the movie.Video - 5.0The image is stellar. What with the whole four elements theme being a prominent factor in the movie's production design, there's quite the diverse color palette throughout. The reds, golds, and blacks of the Fire Nation are vibrant and deep, most notably in their armor, costuming, and mechanical devices. The Water Tribe is represented by mostly blues, whites, and purples that add a very soothing sense of calm and (to quote the terrible analogy of the script) ""flowing emotions."" Earth Kingdom colors are a bit dingy and muddy, as we don't even get to see Omashu or the glorious capital city of Ba Sing Se, but the yellows, greens, and browns are displayed very well. We also get a glimpse of what was the Air Nomads through various yellows, golds, oranges, and a little bit of brown (think Buddhist monks). So yeah, colors are awesome. Black levels are equally perfect with a great deal of shadow delineation visible in a lot of the intricate fabrics worn. Nighttime scenes are especially easy to look at and don't show a whole lot of noise at all. I swear I could see all the soldiers, the lines in their armor, and every little detail in the ground and set during the Blue Spirit scene. Contrast is perfect as well showing a lot of overall detail and sharpness. From the big nostrils of the Avatar to the uncalled for stubble of Twilighty's face to the directions of the water in the frozen ice, the image makes for some relatively commendable cinematography. Special effects shots (while really, really slow in conjunction with the needlessly slower martial arts) look about as ""realistic"" as you can get without the film taking itself less seriously. Fire firing, water watering, earth unearthing, and air airing are essentially equal to their cartoon counterparts. Other than some really bad photography (zooming in way too close to Big-nostril Kid's face on a few shots), the picture quality is flawless.Audio - 5.0Yet another technical marvel on this BD, the sound has two things going for it: the brilliant and epic (albeit vastly different from the original) score by James Newton Howard, and the action effects. Dialogue is unintelligible, yet crisp from the center channel with no issues in overall volume level or dynamics, while the front sides do an amazing job of separation between music, panning voices, and the aforementioned slew of effects. And while the visual side of the action sequences may be questionable, the auditory portion is some of the best material I've heard. Crackling flames during any kind of fire bending will literally encircle you as it travels throughout each speaker starting from the back left or right and swooping around to somewhere in the front. Explosions from said fireballs create a good rumble and really give the sound field a sense of depth amidst the boisterous sound editing and design. Water bending is particularly light depending on who's doing it and to what degree, though one scene that will definitely give your system a workout is at the end when a giant tidal wave is summoned by the Avatar against the Fire Nation navy. I thought my sub had overloaded itself or broken, but it was just the creaking of the ships' hulls and the rumbling of the wave itself. Rear channel usage, by the way, is amazing. The sound clarity between the trumpets, strings, and drums of the score do an excellent job at staying up front and never become mixed with any of the ambient effects or distorting the on-screen speech. And if you haven't guessed it by now, LFEs are killer. The action for the most part is disappointingly slow, but its one benefit from this is the result of some reference level audio. Yes, it's that good. If you by chance are willing to even have this movie in your collection, there would be a lot of scenes you could use to wow the guests.Overall - 3.5If you're a fan of the cartoon series, you'll probably hate this movie. It has no humor, a plodding screenplay, a choppy script, bad child actors, way-too-close-on-the-face photography, super slow motion elemental bending, too much martial arts arm flailing, and absolutely zero character development. If you've never seen Avatar: The Last Airbender, you might find this decent at best for all its fantasy atmospherics, but that's about it. Fans: skip it. The Uninitiated: rent it, first.

1295861,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002VPE1BQ,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 11]","I was having a bizarrely strong sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu while watching M. Night Shyamalan's not-so-great action/fantasy film ""The Last Airbender."" I didn't know exactly why until I remembered another not-so-great (or just terrible) action/fantasy film called ""Dragonball: Evolution."" These two films share so many things: disjointed stories, uninteresting characters, miscast actors, and mediocre effects. The only difference is ""The Last Airbender"" has become a box office hit, having already garnered over 100 million dollars in USA alone at the time of writing.The figure itself, while not staggering, is still impressive, a proof of the huge popularity of the original TV shows. Not having seen the source material, I will not make any comment on the liberties taken in turning the anime show into a feature-length live-action film. Fans have already done that. Personally I don't usually complain about the changes per se, as long as the end results offer something thrilling, exciting or ... anything. Sorry, but here you have none.The story begins with a boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) found in a huge ice sphere and freed by a Waterbender girl named Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone). The rest of the story involves their adventures in the fantasy world. Forgive me if I don't summarize the story because I'm sure you can find better summaries elsewhere.What I want to say is that with the right person(s) behind the camera, the story - a rushed and disjointed one with no character development - could have been much better. The characters, often burdened with long expository dialogues, need to be much more interesting. The subplot about banished Prince Zuko (Dev Patel) is terribly underwritten, and so is the romance of Sokka. ""The Golden Compass"" was pretty disappointing, but at least it knew whose story it was. ""The Last Airbender"" just doesn't.Will there be any sequel? I don't know, but if the film producers are thinking about it, please, hire someone else as writer and director.",2,"Well, Not Bad as ""Dragonball: Evolution"" ...

1295862,A2N60VDBR10N18,B002VPE1BQ,Tyler Johnson,"[3, 7]","Many people made an issue of the fact that the main characters were white, while almost the entire rest of the cast matched the race of the source material. While this is a small annoyance, it has no impact on the movie one way or the other. What does impact this movie is the horrible writing, terrible acting, and the directors insistence on fitting every one of his favorite scenes from the show into the movie, despite the fact that because of the lack of context, the audience will not understand why they are important, or even why they are happening.Even being a die hard fan of the original show, I was lost during parts of this movie. Shyamalan is on record saying that him, and his family are fans of this series; and there in lies the problem. Because he is a fan, he tried to cram an entire television season's worth of information into a single film. The film is thick with content, but without the proper time and context to explain most of it.Viewers who have not seen the show will not understand the majority of the plot. Why is robbing a library so important? what does killing a fish have to do with the sky turning red? Why does the guy from the daily show keep talking about spirits that we never see? Why does that creepy girl at the end look so excited? Having seen the show, I know all of the answers, but in the movie these events were handled so badly, it took me a second to realize why they were happening. In his zeal to appease the hardcore fans, Shyamalan forgot about the core audience, and ultimately alienated both.The visual effects are beautiful, but wasted on boring, nearly pointless fights. The Katara character is so laughably ineffective, that after her third failure to be useful, I almost had to stop watching. Sokka is a humorless robot, with acting skills that match his demeanor. Noah Ringer catches alot of heat for his acting, but honestly, look at his lines. The poor kid is never given anything to say, so I guess he will come off wooden.Overall this is an overly cluttered, poorly executed attempt to capture the magic of a story that was given a full season to properly develop.

The effects were spectacular - CGI technology just keeps getting better all the time. And that small boy in the lead role (Ringer) did quite well for a child of 13.Everyone else involved in the movie, scriptwriters included, lived up to the kid's standards - they all performed at about a 13 year old level, too. The plot had so many holes they must have used a drill press on it. The female sidekick seemed to be named after a disease (""Catarrh,"" or something like that). The male sidekick sported a hairstyle that somehow combined a mullet and a ponytail. To tell the truth, the flick was even less than the dismal reviews had led me to hope for. Then, about two-thirds of the way through, I realized that one big part of the plot just didn't have time to wrap up. I was right - this is really just the first half of something, a fact that was obvious enough even without the blatant sequel-bait at the end.So, I got what I went to see: Incredible effects in an otherwise subpar flick, just as I expected. And, when the sequel comes out, I expect I'll spend money to see that, too, even if it costs more of my self-respect.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters",2,Everything I expected,1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,1231,"['Shyamalan', 'Airbender', 'really', 'was', 'everything', 'expected', 'effects', 'were', 'spectacular', 'CGI', 'technology', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'time', 'small', 'boy', 'lead', 'role', 'Ringer', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'child', '13.Everyone', 'else', 'involved', 'movie', 'scriptwriters', 'included', 'lived', 'up', 'kid', 'standards', 'performed', '13', 'year', 'old', 'level', 'too', 'plot', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'must', 'have', 'used', 'drill', 'press', 'female', 'sidekick', 'seemed', 'be', 'named', 'disease', 'Catarrh', 'something', 'male', 'sidekick', 'sported', 'hairstyle', 'somehow', 'combined', 'mullet', 'ponytail', 'tell', 'truth', 'flick', 'was', 'even', 'less', 'dismal', 'reviews', 'had', 'led', 'hope', 'Then', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'realized', 'one', 'big', 'part', 'plot', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'wrap', 'up', 'was', 'right', 'really', 'just', 'first', 'half', 'something', 'fact', 'was', 'obvious', 'enough', 'even', 'blatant', 'sequel-bait', 'end.So', 'got', 'what', 'went', 'see', 'Incredible', 'effects', 'otherwise', 'subpar', 'flick', 'just', 'expected', 'when', 'sequel', 'out', 'expect', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'money', 'see', 'too', 'even', 'more', 'self-respect.', 'wiredweird', 'reviewing', 'release', 'theaters']",The Last Airbender

Sometimes I cannot see why so few seemed to like a movie and THE LAST AIRBENDER is one of those movies. OK, so most of the actors were running the emotional gamut from A to B; the uncle of the prince is a major exception. But George Lucas gave us the same lack of acting with the same great special effects and made a decent amount of money anyway in Star Wars one, two, three. With this film, a blu-ray player, a large widescreen and surround sound, this movie is a lot of fun. Yes, I haven't watched the Nickolodeon series and had no background, so had nothing to be disappointed about. But this led me to order the first series. I want to see more of this. I hope we get the next film in this series anyway. I hope this is not going to be like GOLDEN COMPASS, where you are left hanging in the middle of the story.
