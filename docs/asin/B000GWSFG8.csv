1007877,A2066JC1FGIEAT,B000GWSFG8,Nadira Jamal of the Improvisation Toolkit,"[7, 7]","I really enjoyed this video.  The ""talking"" portions were short but enlightening, and I learned a lot of good material from it.  I'd highly recommend it to you as well if you:- are an intermediate, advanced, or professional belly dancer( Aradia does not break down most of the movements, so beginners and advanced beginners may need to ask their teachers for help breaking down the moves)- are interested in seeing Egyptian, Lebanese, and Turkish belly dance compared and contrasted- would like to learn some attractive, versatile combinationsWhat you get:- A quick introduction to the aesthetics of the Egyptian, Lebanese, and Turkish styles of belly dance- 3 combinations in each style- A full-song performance in each styleWhat I Liked:- The video made the difference between the three styles VERY clear.  I've studied with several teachers, each of whom has a different interpretation of ""Arabic"" belly dance, and now I understand why, given what I know about their influences.- The combinations are cute, they fit the music Aradia has chosen, and they could easily be adapted to go with other music.  They move quickly, and some are not easy to execute, but they are well-structured, so they won't fly over your audience's head.- For each style, Aradia begins the performance with the combos she just taught.  That helped me understand what she was doing as she expanded on those ideas later in the piece.- The Turkish section used music in 4/4 time, which is often neglected.  (Most Turkish videos focus on 9/8, but that's not all there is to Turkish dance!)  Also, Aradia danced to ""Geceler"" which is one of my favorite Turkish songs, and it was a treat to see it interpreted by someone so talented and well-versed in Turkish style.- Aradia spent just the right amount of time breaking down and practicing each combo.  I didn't feel rushed or bored.What I Didn't Like:- The Egyptian & Lebanese style sections used pop-y/remix-y music.  I would have preferred more classical/traditional selections.- Each ""chapter"" was actually a title on the DVD (rather than a proper chapter), so the ""step forward"" button on my remote didn't work.- When facing you, Aradia says ""right"" when she's working on the viewer's left.  This is pretty common on video, but it gets a little confusing when she turns around and her right actually IS your right.- Aradia's performance in the Egyptian section seemed a little prissy.  The moves and musical interpretation were perfect for the genre, but her performance was missing the ""goo"" and the emotional intensity you find in good Egyptian dancers.(This is not to criticize Aradia's dancing. I've seen clips of her performing in Egyptian style and she absolutely had the ""goo"" and the ""love""; those qualities just didn't come through in this performance.)I'd love to see Aradia do additional volumes on this theme.  Maybe one comparing & contrasting how the styles use slow music, another for drum solos, zils etc.?",5,"Excellent comparison of three styles, plus some nice material to take home",1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,2950,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'talking', 'portions', 'were', 'short', 'enlightening', 'learned', 'lot', 'good', 'material', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'professional', 'belly', 'dancer', 'Aradia', 'not', 'break', 'down', 'most', 'movements', 'beginners', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'may', 'need', 'ask', 'teachers', 'help', 'breaking', 'down', 'moves', 'are', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Egyptian', 'Lebanese', 'Turkish', 'belly', 'dance', 'compared', 'contrasted-', 'would', 'like', 'learn', 'attractive', 'versatile', 'combinationsWhat', 'get', 'quick', 'introduction', 'aesthetics', 'Egyptian', 'Lebanese', 'Turkish', 'styles', 'belly', 'dance-', '3', 'combinations', 'style-', 'full-song', 'performance', 'styleWhat', 'Liked', 'video', 'made', 'difference', 'three', 'styles', 'VERY', 'clear', ""'ve"", 'studied', 'several', 'teachers', 'whom', 'different', 'interpretation', 'Arabic', 'belly', 'dance', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'given', 'what', 'know', 'influences.-', 'combinations', 'are', 'cute', 'fit', 'music', 'Aradia', 'chosen', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'adapted', 'go', 'other', 'music', 'move', 'quickly', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'execute', 'are', 'well-structured', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fly', 'audience', 'head.-', 'style', 'Aradia', 'performance', 'combos', 'just', 'taught', 'helped', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'expanded', 'ideas', 'later', 'piece.-', 'Turkish', 'section', 'used', 'music', '4/4', 'time', 'often', 'neglected', 'Most', 'Turkish', 'videos', 'focus', '9/8', 'not', 'Turkish', 'dance', 'Also', 'Aradia', 'danced', 'Geceler', 'one', 'favorite', 'Turkish', 'songs', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'interpreted', 'someone', 'so', 'talented', 'well-versed', 'Turkish', 'style.-', 'Aradia', 'spent', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'time', 'breaking', 'down', 'practicing', 'combo', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'rushed', 'bored.What', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Egyptian', 'Lebanese', 'style', 'sections', 'used', 'pop-y/remix-y', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'classical/traditional', 'selections.-', 'chapter', 'was', 'actually', 'title', 'DVD', 'rather', 'proper', 'chapter', 'step', 'forward', 'button', 'remote', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.-', 'When', 'facing', 'Aradia', 'right', 'when', 'working', 'viewer', 'left', 'pretty', 'common', 'video', 'little', 'confusing', 'when', 'around', 'right', 'actually', 'right.-', 'Aradia', 'performance', 'Egyptian', 'section', 'seemed', 'little', 'prissy', 'moves', 'musical', 'interpretation', 'were', 'perfect', 'genre', 'performance', 'was', 'missing', 'goo', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'find', 'good', 'Egyptian', 'dancers', 'not', 'criticize', 'Aradia', 'dancing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'clips', 'performing', 'Egyptian', 'style', 'absolutely', 'had', 'goo', 'love', 'qualities', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'performance', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'Aradia', 'do', 'additional', 'volumes', 'theme', 'Maybe', 'one', 'comparing', 'contrasting', 'how', 'styles', 'use', 'slow', 'music', 'drum', 'solos', 'etc']","BellyDance ""Oriental Dance By Aradia""-combinations for Egyptian, Lebanese and Turkish Oriental Dance"
