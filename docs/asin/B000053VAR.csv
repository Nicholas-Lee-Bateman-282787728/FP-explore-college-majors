565653,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000053VAR,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Alice's Restaurant, 1969 filmThe story begins in an office where men are being questioned about their eligibility for the army. Arlo Guthrie decided it was time for an education. A friend visits him. Later Arlo leaves his music class. He learns his friend Roger was put on a bus out of town. Arlo gets into a fight at a restaurant then the police take him away. Arlo hitches a ride out of town in a big truck. He visits his sick and dying father. [Did he really need a cigarette?] A couple bought a used church to use as their home. [Aren't those high ceilings hard to heat?] There is a song. An undertaker's flower car is used like a pickup truck. [The dollar figures date this movie.] Arlo meets an old friend who just got out of the Army. You hear the song (as a commercial) for Alice's Restaurant in Stockbridge Mass. [Is the Norman Rockwell Museum there?]Dirt track motorcycle races provide entertainment. Running a restaurant requires work and devotion. Huntington's Chorea is a hereditary nervous disease with no cure. Pete Seeger sings about the fun of riding in an automobile. Arlo goes back to New York, Alice visits him, so too Ray and Roger. Ray plans a Thanksgiving feast. Guests arrive, some have gifts. Later they take the garbage to the town dump. Since it was closed they dumped their garbage at another place. Will this be a problem? Yes. [Small towns don't want them dirtied.] ""Shut up, kid."" Alice puts up the bail money. They are fined $25 each for illegal dumping. The judge has a guide dog. Arlo and Ray dump their garbage at an approved place. Arlo reports for his draft physical. Was he ever arrested? Then its ""Group W""! Arrested for littering and creating a nuisance?Officer Obie brings a friend to the ""free farm"". Is a friend ""on"" again? Is he in denial? He endangered the others. That flower car has a long wooden box in the back. Woody is gone. No funeral for him? There is another friend. Ray and Alice consider a real wedding. There is a celebration in their house. ""It's up there."" Later the guests depart. Ray thinks about selling the church to buy land in Vermont and live off the food they raise. At the end Alice stands alone and stares at the camera. Significance?Arlo Guthrie wrote ""Alice's Restaurant"" as a folk song to commemorate an actual event (like ""Casey Jones""). The song was better and took less time. This is about average as a movie. The background of the people was missing.

565657,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000053VAR,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This movie is pretty authentic, for all it is a fictionalized story. Arlo plays Arlo, Pete Seeger is unmistakable, but the funniest part is that Officer Obie plays himself, too. As the cover quotes him, ""if someone was going to make a fool out of me, it had better be me.""""You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.""I'm betting you've heard the song, probably all the way through its nearly 20 minutes. Most of what's in that song is in the movie, along with a lot of other things. The church that Alice and Ray converted into a Hippie Hangout was the real location used in the movie. So while it's really not a documentary, it has a good bit of authenticity. This includes the schemes one guy uses to claim he has quit doing drugs, where he hides them, the excuses he makes. The clothes are far more what I remember than the movie ""Hair,"" but then that was a musical and not expected to feel very authentic.Anyway, I suppose I should outline the story for the sake of the youngsters who don't know the song. Arlo and a friend hopped into a red VW microbus and went up to Massachusetts to visit Alice and Ray Brock in their deconsecrated church for Thanksgiving dinner. They had a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, and in gratitude, decided to take a load of trash out of the church as it hadn't been dumped in ""a very long time."" They filled the red VW microbus with ""garbage,"" as Arlo puts it, and drive off to the town dump. But the dump was closed on Thanksgiving, so they went looking for somewhere else to dump the load. After awhile they noticed a pile of trash off the side of the side road, and figuring one big pile was better than two little piles, rather than bring that one up, they threw theirs down. They then returned to the church and had another Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat.The next morning they were confronted by Officer Obie, who had discovered an envelope with Arlo's name on it at the ""bottom of half a ton of garbage."" Arlo confessed that he had put that envelope at the bottom of that half a ton of garbage.I'm not going to go through the whole routine, but the bottom line is they were fined $50 and had to pick up the garbage. So later, when Arlo is called to Whitehall Street to report for the draft, he's given a form that asks, ""Kid, have you ever been arrested?"" So he puts down all about the garbage and the ""27 color glossies with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one telling what it was and how it was to be used in evidence against us.""Arlo is sent to sit on the Group W bench, where you go if they have to decide if you're moral enough to join the army after committing your particular crime. There were mother rapers, father stabbers, even father rapers, and they were mean, ugly and nasty . . . one of the meanest, ugliest father raper asks him, ""Kid, what'd you get?"" Arlo answers, ""I didn't get nothing. I had to pay 50 dollars and pick up the garbage.""Oh, you really must at least hear the song, even if you don't see the movie. It's really very funny.Most of the parts of the movie that are not in the song are not nearly so funny. At one point, Arlo goes to visit his father, Woody Guthrie (he did not play himself; he had died a couple of years before the movie was made), in the hospital. Woody had Huntington's chorea, a hereditary neurological disease that is severely crippling. While he's there, Pete Seeger comes to visit, and they sing to Woodie.The other part that is sad is about the kid with a drug problem. I won't go into details, but everyone really does try to help him. They fail.It's a good movie for someone young enough not to know much about the sixties, because it is very much a part of the memories. There's even a scene of Arlo with a groupie. The costumes are real; they just wore their own clothes for the most part, except for the big party scene where Alice and Ray renew their wedding vows. And of course the music is real. In fact, it's so real it's kind of depressing in spots, like the older woman who runs a coffee house and tries to seduce Arlo, reminding him of the times she has helped him, like he owes her sex for it.",3,Hippie History,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,4153,"['movie', 'pretty', 'authentic', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'Arlo', 'Arlo', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'unmistakable', 'funniest', 'part', 'Officer', 'Obie', 'too', 'cover', 'someone', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'fool', 'had', 'better', 'be', 'can', 'get', 'anything', 'want', 'Alice', 'Restaurant', ""'m"", 'betting', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'song', 'probably', 'way', 'nearly', '20', 'minutes', 'Most', 'what', 'song', 'movie', 'lot', 'other', 'things', 'church', 'Alice', 'Ray', 'converted', 'Hippie', 'Hangout', 'was', 'real', 'location', 'used', 'movie', 'So', 'really', 'not', 'documentary', 'good', 'bit', 'authenticity', 'schemes', 'one', 'guy', 'claim', 'quit', 'doing', 'drugs', 'where', 'excuses', 'clothes', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'what', 'remember', 'movie', 'Hair', 'then', 'was', 'musical', 'not', 'expected', 'feel', 'very', 'authentic.Anyway', 'suppose', 'should', 'outline', 'story', 'sake', 'youngsters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'song', 'Arlo', 'friend', 'hopped', 'red', 'VW', 'microbus', 'went', 'up', 'Massachusetts', 'visit', 'Alice', 'Ray', 'Brock', 'deconsecrated', 'church', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'had', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat', 'gratitude', 'decided', 'take', 'load', 'trash', 'church', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'dumped', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'filled', 'red', 'VW', 'microbus', 'garbage', 'Arlo', 'drive', 'off', 'town', 'dump', 'dump', 'was', 'closed', 'Thanksgiving', 'went', 'looking', 'somewhere', 'else', 'dump', 'load', 'noticed', 'pile', 'trash', 'side', 'side', 'road', 'figuring', 'one', 'big', 'pile', 'was', 'better', 'two', 'little', 'piles', 'rather', 'bring', 'one', 'up', 'threw', 'down', 'then', 'returned', 'church', 'had', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'beat.The', 'next', 'morning', 'were', 'confronted', 'Officer', 'Obie', 'who', 'had', 'discovered', 'envelope', 'Arlo', 'name', 'bottom', 'ton', 'garbage', 'Arlo', 'confessed', 'had', 'put', 'envelope', 'bottom', 'ton', 'garbage.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'whole', 'routine', 'bottom', 'line', 'were', 'fined', '50', 'had', 'pick', 'up', 'garbage', 'So', 'later', 'when', 'Arlo', 'called', 'Whitehall', 'Street', 'report', 'draft', 'given', 'form', 'Kid', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'arrested', 'down', 'garbage', '27', 'color', 'glossies', 'circles', 'arrows', 'paragraph', 'back', 'one', 'telling', 'what', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'be', 'used', 'evidence', 'Arlo', 'sent', 'sit', 'Group', 'W', 'bench', 'where', 'go', 'have', 'decide', ""'re"", 'moral', 'enough', 'join', 'army', 'committing', 'particular', 'crime', 'were', 'mother', 'rapers', 'father', 'stabbers', 'even', 'father', 'rapers', 'were', 'mean', 'ugly', 'nasty', 'one', 'meanest', 'ugliest', 'father', 'raper', 'Kid', 'what', ""'d"", 'get', 'Arlo', 'answers', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'nothing', 'had', 'pay', '50', 'dollars', 'pick', 'up', 'garbage', 'Oh', 'really', 'must', 'least', 'hear', 'song', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'really', 'very', 'funny.Most', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'song', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'funny', 'one', 'point', 'Arlo', 'visit', 'father', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'had', 'died', 'couple', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'hospital', 'Woody', 'had', 'Huntington', 'chorea', 'hereditary', 'neurological', 'disease', 'severely', 'crippling', 'there', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'visit', 'sing', 'Woodie.The', 'other', 'part', 'sad', 'kid', 'drug', 'problem', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'everyone', 'really', 'try', 'help', 'fail.It', 'good', 'movie', 'someone', 'young', 'enough', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'sixties', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'memories', 'even', 'scene', 'Arlo', 'groupie', 'costumes', 'are', 'real', 'just', 'wore', 'own', 'clothes', 'most', 'part', 'big', 'party', 'scene', 'where', 'Alice', 'Ray', 'renew', 'wedding', 'vows', 'course', 'music', 'real', 'fact', 'so', 'real', 'kind', 'depressing', 'spots', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'coffee', 'house', 'tries', 'seduce', 'Arlo', 'reminding', 'times', 'helped', 'sex']",N/A
565658,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000053VAR,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[11, 13]","`Alice's Restaurant', directed by Arthur Penn, following on his great success with `Bonnie and Clyde' is a great bookend to that other 1960's cinematic document, `Easy Rider'. Both movies are less well known for their quality as works of film art as they are for statements of the counter-culture state of mind in the late 1960's.I saw the movie when it was first released in theaters and I even bought Arlo Guthrie's `Alice's Restaurant' album (his first) when it was first released in 1967. At the time, I was not especially impressed with the quality of the movie; however the thrill of seeing the ceremonial passing of the torch from Woody Guthrie's generation, represented in the flesh by Pete Seeger, to the next generation was really nice, in spite of the irony that Arlo Guthrie was much less a standard-bearer of that torch than the far greater talents such as Bob Dylan, Richard Farina and Phil Ochs. And yet, it was Arlo that managed to capture the spirit of 1960's counterculture dropouts driven less by doctrinal zeal than by simple self-interest.Like `Easy Rider', `Alice's Restaurant', the movie has a depressing ending, albeit not quite so tragic. If Penn and his collaborators are to be given any credit, it is that they took the sweet little story behind the 15 minute `talking blues' which was the album cut (the full first side of the album of the same name), and expand it into a morality play about great counterculture ambitions and less great drug culture dangers.The weakest part of the movie may be the fact that at this age, Arlo Guthrie was simply did not have what it took to hold up a major role in a feature length movie. All the heavy lifting in the acting department was done by Pat Quinn as Alice and James Broderick as her husband who, together, were the earth mother and father of a loose band of hippies living, per the song, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. As I recall from the newspaper stories of the day, the skeleton story was almost all true, as there was a real Alice and there was a real `Alice's Restaurant', evidenced by pictures of actresses Quinn standing beside the true to live Alice.The foreground story, the famous Thanksgiving feast, the disposal of the refuse, the call to the draft board, and the segregation of our hero with the other of society's miscreants is funny enough, but from this distance in time, the background story of the failure of Alice and Ray's little commune is much more durable. It shows how fragile `new' value systems can be, when they don't have all the resources or support of mainstream society.I watch this movie with great nostalgia for a milieu of which I was a part, and a great longing for the fact that like so many great `60's sentiments, they are preserved only in such greatly metamorphosed form to be almost unrecognizable.An average movie which captures a distinctly admirable, but ephemeral spirit of years gone by.",4,Great document of the times.

565660,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,B000053VAR,Cowboy Buddha,"[3, 3]","I re-visited this film the other night (on Thanksgiving) after not having seen it for some years. I remember when it first came out that I had mixed feelings about it and I still do. It's an interesting film (almost too interesting) but not really what I would call enjoyable. As portrayed in the film, Alice's Restaurant was not a particularly fun place to be.Part of the problem seems to the director's insistence on making the film ""relevant"" and ""meaningful"" in the heavy-handed manner that too many Sixties films did. The movie is most successful when following the mood and theme of the song on which it is supposed to be based; much less so when trying to pad out the plot. The Woody hospital scenes are a nice poignant touch, but the bike races are boring and the character of Shelly is just plain annoying. The acting throughout is inconsistent. Arlo Guthrie is likeable but lightweight and flashes his toothy grin once too often. Pat Quinn as Alice comes off best. Officer Obie is a nice touch but many of the rest of the cast seem to be Hollywood versions of very clean hippies wearing the latest fashions straight off the costume rack.The biggest problem in the film for me is the character of Ray who I find rather sinister. His background is never really explained and he comes across as a kind of cult leader, always going on about ""our kids"". His source of income is a mystery - he buys the church and sets up the restaurant but has to borrow $80 from Arlo. He's not very nice to Alice but she seems drawn to him. The hippies follow him without question, apparently happy to trade one establishment for another. The film seems unnecessarily dark whenever Ray is on the scene.I suppose it's interesting to see this film every once in a while, if only because it provides a kind of snapshot of the times. Perhaps not a totally accurate snapshot, but then memories have a way of improving on reality. For me, I think Alice's Restaurant would have been better with more comedy and less forced dramatics.

565664,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000053VAR,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","1969 was a turning point in American history. And this film is still living on the hippy dream, on the flower kids and their illusion that life is nothing but music and fun. Even the war and the draft are made small and insignificant, as if you could escape the draft because you had been arrested, tried and convicted of a crime like littering. Why not jaywalking? 1969 was the arrival of Nixon, the invasion of Cambodia, after the Tet offensive, escalation and blindness among all political personnel or politicians. The film thus is a full nightmare in disguise as a freewheeling period of complete enjoyment and happiness, wedding and champagne added as a reward for your trust in the future. And yet the film is a tremendous satire of that very short-sighted and careless spirit. Every detail is symbolical and metaphorical. Arlo Guthrie's girl friend looks very Vietnamese, a symbol of the war going on that no one wants to see. The church that is sold is also the symbol of the loss of faith and legitimacy in the US. Everything is just running down and away. And that is crowned at the end by this very last scene where Alice and Ray are literally abandoned by Arlo and Mari-chan, and Alice is not standing in any Wonderland then, but in her wedding dress, early in the sunless morning on the front steps of the church of hers, unmoving and silent in a world where there is a light breeze that makes her veil float slightly, both the veil and its shadow on the church wall, and Alice and the church are captured by the slowly moving camera following some circle whose center is Alice herself and every so often a tree trunk goes by in the picture, and the whole church is surrounded by a complete waste land, all dirt and no grass, brown and muddy. The church itself looks unkempt and its paint seems to be more or less starting to scale. A world abandoned and being wasted, wrecked, dumped along the way of history that is going to come, a vision we can imagine bleak and sad, tearful and fearful, frightening and full of pain. There is like some nostalgia at that time about a good old world that has vanished in thin air and will never be back. See you, bye bye, forever. That was a time when the United States, for the first time in their history, had met an obstacle they could not negotiate. And today this past vision is becoming so premonitory of the forty years it will take for hope to come back in time to be able to assume the changing world in which the US are no longer to be number one and yet when they can recapture some leadership provided they accept to share responsibilities and resources. That idea of sharing definitely was not in the air in 1969 and the dissatisfied young people could only dream of a freewheeling enjoyment of what was at their disposal without any effort of any kind. And the vice-principal of my high school was telling us in the car that took us to the Teachers' Union state convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, how a simple atom bomb on Hanoi or ,Haiphong would bring in victory. The higher the monkey climbs in the tree... You know the second part of the saying I guess, if not go and check in Sri Lanka, for instance, what you can see when the monkey is going up into the tree leaving you on the ground, your eyes rising slowly to follow the butt sight of the acrobatic animal.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Visionary about our future of their past,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,3473,"['1969', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'American', 'history', 'film', 'still', 'living', 'hippy', 'dream', 'flower', 'kids', 'illusion', 'life', 'nothing', 'music', 'fun', 'Even', 'war', 'draft', 'are', 'made', 'small', 'insignificant', 'could', 'escape', 'draft', 'had', 'been', 'arrested', 'tried', 'convicted', 'crime', 'littering', 'Why', 'not', 'jaywalking', '1969', 'was', 'arrival', 'Nixon', 'invasion', 'Cambodia', 'Tet', 'offensive', 'escalation', 'blindness', 'political', 'personnel', 'politicians', 'film', 'thus', 'full', 'nightmare', 'disguise', 'freewheeling', 'period', 'complete', 'enjoyment', 'happiness', 'wedding', 'champagne', 'added', 'reward', 'trust', 'future', 'yet', 'film', 'tremendous', 'satire', 'very', 'short-sighted', 'careless', 'spirit', 'detail', 'symbolical', 'metaphorical', 'Arlo', 'Guthrie', 'girl', 'friend', 'very', 'Vietnamese', 'symbol', 'war', 'going', 'one', 'see', 'church', 'sold', 'also', 'symbol', 'loss', 'faith', 'legitimacy', 'US', 'Everything', 'just', 'running', 'down', 'away', 'crowned', 'end', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'where', 'Alice', 'Ray', 'are', 'literally', 'abandoned', 'Arlo', 'Mari-chan', 'Alice', 'not', 'standing', 'Wonderland', 'then', 'wedding', 'dress', 'early', 'sunless', 'morning', 'front', 'steps', 'church', 'hers', 'unmoving', 'silent', 'world', 'where', 'light', 'breeze', 'veil', 'float', 'slightly', 'veil', 'shadow', 'church', 'wall', 'Alice', 'church', 'are', 'captured', 'slowly', 'moving', 'camera', 'following', 'circle', 'center', 'Alice', 'so', 'often', 'tree', 'trunk', 'picture', 'whole', 'church', 'surrounded', 'complete', 'waste', 'land', 'dirt', 'grass', 'brown', 'muddy', 'church', 'unkempt', 'paint', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'starting', 'scale', 'world', 'abandoned', 'being', 'wasted', 'wrecked', 'dumped', 'way', 'history', 'going', 'come', 'vision', 'can', 'imagine', 'bleak', 'sad', 'tearful', 'fearful', 'frightening', 'full', 'pain', 'nostalgia', 'time', 'good', 'old', 'world', 'vanished', 'thin', 'air', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'back', 'See', 'bye', 'forever', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'United', 'States', 'first', 'time', 'history', 'had', 'met', 'obstacle', 'could', 'not', 'negotiate', 'today', 'past', 'vision', 'becoming', 'so', 'premonitory', 'forty', 'years', 'will', 'take', 'hope', 'come', 'back', 'time', 'be', 'able', 'assume', 'changing', 'world', 'US', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'number', 'one', 'yet', 'when', 'can', 'recapture', 'leadership', 'provided', 'accept', 'share', 'responsibilities', 'resources', 'idea', 'sharing', 'definitely', 'was', 'not', 'air', '1969', 'dissatisfied', 'young', 'people', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'freewheeling', 'enjoyment', 'what', 'was', 'disposal', 'effort', 'kind', 'vice-principal', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'telling', 'car', 'took', 'Teachers', 'Union', 'state', 'convention', 'Charlotte', 'North', 'Carolina', 'how', 'simple', 'atom', 'bomb', 'Hanoi', 'Haiphong', 'would', 'bring', 'victory', 'higher', 'monkey', 'climbs', 'tree', 'know', 'second', 'part', 'saying', 'guess', 'not', 'go', 'check', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'instance', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'monkey', 'going', 'up', 'tree', 'leaving', 'ground', 'eyes', 'rising', 'slowly', 'follow', 'butt', 'sight', 'acrobatic', 'animal.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

565667,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000053VAR,Kevin Killian,"[1, 2]","Enjoyed this movie on many levels; I liked Arlo's non-performance, the way he had of keeping it real even when the action bordered on the absurd.  The conflicting tones of the movie, that many reviewers balk at, were for me its saving grace.  It wasn't just an animated version of the song, and it wasn't a stoner comedy like HAROLD AND KUMAR--but it almost was--however the Bergman-esque aspects of Penn's portrait of the up and down marriage of Alice and Ray made sure that the movie carried within itself a tragic dimension...  So one scene's light hearted and hippie, the next might be unbearably stark and cruel--that change-up gives the movie more energy than I remembered it having.Otherwise the narrative structure is like the three bears, especially in the way the movie keeps throwing beautiful women at Arlo--in a random way that could only happen in the movies because, let's face it, he's kind of a freakish looking dude.  First he's tempted by the pubescent groupie ""Reenie"" played by Shelley Plimpton--but he turns her down when she admits being 14.  (Talk about a cultural difference, they wouldn't show a 14 year old girl topless in the American cinema of today now, would they, but here it's just another day in Arlo's life.)  Then he gets propositioned by the older, sexually rapacious club owner Ruth (the only film role for the legendary actress and teacher Eulalie Noble), hard and crass as a bowlful of rocks.  He rejects her for being too old.  Too young, too old, and then third time lucky he meets the angelic Asian-American Mari-chan, end of story.In the other story line, I found the triangle story between Alice, Ray and Shelly entirely believable and sad, even though some of Pat Quinn's acting mannerisms indicate she took courses at the Anna Magnani School of Over the Top, while the young man who plays Shelly is so weird and choppy I'm surprised he lived to the end of filming, it feels ike a performance by someone who's dead already.

565671,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000053VAR,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Alice's Restaurant is based on the song of the same name by Arlo Guthrie; and although it's not the best movie I've ever seen it's far from being the worst. The plot moves along fairly well; they could have edited the first hour a little bit more to make the action tighter; the second part moves along at a much better pace. Some of the actors did a great job; other actors were not so convincing. However, the cinematography and the choreography are very strong; and the movie overall is entertaining.When the action starts, we meet young Arlo Guthrie who's bouncing around having some adventures. He goes to college but he finds it's not for him; and he has a brush with the law after he gets thrown through a window for the crime of having long hair! Worse yet, his father Woody Guthrie (played by Joseph Boley) is dying of a rare neurological disorder in a New York hospital. Arlo splits his time between visiting friends Alice and Ray (Patricia Quinn and James Broderick) who buy a church in Massachusetts and New York where he visits his father in the hospital.Ray and Alice get some people to help renovate the church into a home with a restaurant in back (thus we have Alice's Restaurant) and the church takes on a beautiful transformation. Unfortunately, a love triangle complicates things between Alice, Ray and a young man named Shelly (Michael McClanathan).Shortly before Thanksgiving time, a few key events happen. First, Ray and Alice reconcile after a brief breakup--and Ray surprises Alice when he tells her he's invited ""a few"" other people for Thanksgiving dinner. Thanksgiving turns into a banquet for tons of people although a good time is had by all; and Arlo and his friend Roger (Geoff Outlaw) innocently dump the garbage at the bottom of a ravine where a lot of garbage already lies--after all, what can you do when you need to dump a ton of garbage and the town dump is closed for Thanksgiving? This creates an unexpected problem for Arlo and Roger; they are arrested by Officer ""Obie"" (William Obanhein) and the local police have a field day using all their equipment to document the biggest ""crime"" to hit Stockbridge in nearly 50 years. After Alice gets them out of jail, they must pay a fine and pick up the garbage.And then Arlo gets his draft notice--he must report to a military screening post on Whitehall Street in New York for a physical and more. When they find out that he was arrested for littering and that he thinks little of it, their reaction is remarkable!Of course, there's already plenty more that I've left out (believe it or not) and there are questions that remain. Ray and Alice struggle to make their relationship work--will they stay together? Will Arlo be inducted into the military? What about the girl that Arlo likes--her name is Mari-chan (Tina Chen). Will she return Arlo's affection? What about Officer Obie--what happens at Arlo and Roger's trial that could derail his ""prosecution"" case against Arlo and Roger for littering? Watch and find out!We do indeed get a commentary by Arlo; and that's grand. There's also a marvelous cameo by the great Pete Seeger who plays and sings along with Arlo in Woody's hospital room.Alice's Restaurant isn't as well edited as I hoped it would be; the story line has unnecessary complications. Nevertheless, it does explore the issues of life, death, hope, loss, love and more. I recommend this film for people interested in these meaningful issues; and people who want a nostalgic look back at the 1960's would do well to get this DVD.",4,fine movie despite a few minor flaws,1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,3531,"['Alice', 'Restaurant', 'based', 'song', 'same', 'name', 'Arlo', 'Guthrie', 'not', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'far', 'being', 'worst', 'plot', 'moves', 'fairly', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'edited', 'first', 'hour', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'make', 'action', 'tighter', 'second', 'part', 'along', 'much', 'better', 'pace', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'convincing', 'However', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'movie', 'overall', 'action', 'meet', 'young', 'Arlo', 'Guthrie', 'who', 'bouncing', 'around', 'having', 'adventures', 'college', 'not', 'brush', 'law', 'thrown', 'window', 'crime', 'having', 'long', 'hair', 'Worse', 'yet', 'father', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Boley', 'dying', 'rare', 'neurological', 'disorder', 'New', 'York', 'hospital', 'time', 'visiting', 'friends', 'Alice', 'Ray', 'Patricia', 'Quinn', 'James', 'Broderick', 'who', 'buy', 'church', 'Massachusetts', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'father', 'hospital.Ray', 'Alice', 'get', 'people', 'help', 'renovate', 'church', 'home', 'restaurant', 'back', 'thus', 'have', 'Alice', 'Restaurant', 'church', 'beautiful', 'transformation', 'Unfortunately', 'love', 'triangle', 'things', 'Alice', 'Ray', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Shelly', 'Michael', 'McClanathan', '.Shortly', 'Thanksgiving', 'time', 'few', 'key', 'events', 'happen', 'First', 'Ray', 'Alice', 'reconcile', 'brief', 'breakup', 'Ray', 'surprises', 'Alice', 'when', 'invited', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'Thanksgiving', 'banquet', 'tons', 'people', 'good', 'time', 'had', 'Arlo', 'friend', 'Roger', 'Geoff', 'Outlaw', 'innocently', 'dump', 'garbage', 'bottom', 'ravine', 'where', 'lot', 'garbage', 'already', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'need', 'dump', 'ton', 'garbage', 'town', 'dump', 'closed', 'Thanksgiving', 'unexpected', 'problem', 'Arlo', 'Roger', 'are', 'arrested', 'Officer', 'Obie', 'William', 'Obanhein', 'local', 'police', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'using', 'equipment', 'document', 'biggest', 'crime', 'hit', 'Stockbridge', 'nearly', '50', 'years', 'Alice', 'jail', 'must', 'pay', 'fine', 'pick', 'up', 'garbage.And', 'then', 'Arlo', 'draft', 'notice', 'must', 'report', 'military', 'screening', 'post', 'Whitehall', 'Street', 'New', 'York', 'physical', 'more', 'When', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'arrested', 'littering', 'little', 'reaction', 'remarkable', 'course', 'already', 'plenty', 'more', ""'ve"", 'left', 'out', 'believe', 'not', 'are', 'questions', 'remain', 'Ray', 'Alice', 'struggle', 'make', 'relationship', 'work', 'will', 'stay', 'together', 'Will', 'Arlo', 'be', 'inducted', 'military', 'What', 'girl', 'Arlo', 'name', 'Mari-chan', 'Tina', 'Chen', 'Will', 'return', 'Arlo', 'affection', 'What', 'Officer', 'Obie', 'what', 'Arlo', 'Roger', 'trial', 'could', 'derail', 'prosecution', 'case', 'Arlo', 'Roger', 'littering', 'Watch', 'find', 'out', 'do', 'indeed', 'get', 'commentary', 'Arlo', 'grand', 'also', 'marvelous', 'cameo', 'great', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'who', 'sings', 'Arlo', 'Woody', 'hospital', 'room.Alice', 'Restaurant', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'edited', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'story', 'line', 'unnecessary', 'complications', 'Nevertheless', 'explore', 'issues', 'life', 'death', 'hope', 'loss', 'love', 'more', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'interested', 'meaningful', 'issues', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'nostalgic', 'look', 'back', '1960', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'DVD']",N/A

Thanks to audio commentary by Arlo Guthrie himself, Alice's Restaurant merits nomination as the greatest movie ever about the 60s or, for that matter, any time of profound social and spiritual change! What adds human depth to this movie is that many people involved in the real-life drama are here, in the same locations, playing themselves!The 60s social/intellectual/spiritual divide is illustrated in Alice's Restaurant by this insane question: can anyone who dumps litter be sufficiently moral to help kill people in another land? The social divide of the 60s has additional clarity in Alice's Restaurant because the movie director was in one ideological camp and Arlo Guthrie was in the other! In addition, an extremely valid spiritual dimension is provided to the story because Alice's restaurant was in a church; a fertile and far-reaching symbol! It makes the movie and  real-life story into one wonderful (but never utopian) heart-warming adventure!The movie has an amazing number of dimensions. What amazes most, however, is the Alice's Restaurant song, on which the movie was partly based. It still sounds wonderfully fresh and nave! It maintains its power because it is not only a celebration of the genuine joys of life, love, and friendship but also an indisputable anthem that fully affirms the great natural value of simply having fun in life when you can `get anything you want'.  It seems a totally innocuous, irrelevant song ...  yet,  that remains its overwhelming strength rather than its weakness.

This movie captures the fun of that classic ARLO GUTHRIE rant, about thanksgiving, littering, and the Draft (and, check out the title of my review, that too). NOW- the live track that A.G. recorded manages to tell the whole story in seventeen minutes, and I have got to tell you, that for the years and years of hearing that tune every Thanksgiving, I had painted a somewhat different picture of the story.The movie adds a lot of details, and extends the plot somewhat, to make it proper film length. None of this hurts in any way. Arlo Guthrie is very funny in the film (those Guthries were a witty bunch anyway) -and we get a good view of sixties subculture, from a sideview of Guthries counter culture, within a counter culture.I used to have this on video, but my moms copied over it with the last episode of Seinfeld in the late nineties (der)... I haven't seen the movie since.Arlo himself wrote a review for this one, asking us to please wait on this release until he releases it himself. MAN...

565686,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B000053VAR,William Timothy Lukeman,"[1, 1]","As another Thanksgiving approaches, those of a certain age invariably hear the strains of ""Alice's Restaurant"" playing in their heads. Which means I'll be watching this somewhat uneven but thoughtful movie once more, reacquainting myself with what are now legendary days. I'm sure they seem a bit implausible & unreal to those who didn't live through the times ... but rest assured, the shambling, rough-edged, absurdist tones are a fairly accurate evocation of those days.We all know the basic story: how Arlo was arrested for littering, and how that criminal blot on his record made him unfit for the draft. What's interesting are the two counterpoints at work here, from the director's more critical & judgmental eye, to Arlo's mellow retrospective in the commentary. Which is closer to the truth?Well, both of them are, and that's what gives this movie its lasting impact. It's all too easy to dismiss it as dated, but those who do so are really missing the larger picture. Because the intersection of idealism & experience, hope & loss, despair & renewal, is one that every generation faces. It's just that such things were writ very large indeed in the 1960s.So we see the naive but determined hope of Arlo & his friends to create a newer world, one that's free of the hypocrisies & betrayals of the past. Again, it's easy to dismiss this from a more cynical distance -- but young people really did believe that transformation was possible, and did their best to live as if it had already taken place. It might have proven an impossible dream, but it was a beautiful & positive one.And we also see how the basics of human nature couldn't be denied, especially with the central character of Alice. I knew hippie earth mothers like that -- but as a naive young man myself, I couldn't see how the burden of living such an archetypal role was more than most flesh-&-blood could bear for any length of time. Even hope takes its toll.Which brings us to the most moving scenes, the funeral in the snow & the disintegration of their brief communal moment. Never was a song more aptly chosen than Joni Mitchell's ""Songs to Aging Children Come,"" and never was it more heartbreaking. For me, that scene always brings to mind the last lines of James Joyce's ""The Dead,"" with snow falling upon the universe, upon the living & the dead.And then we see as the temporary family pulls apart, when Ray's need to control things & keep everything captured in the amber of one instant destroys the very thing he sought to preserve. Is there a sadder sight than the drive away from the church, with Alice standing forlornly among the bare trees?Yet as Arlo's commentary track from decades later shows, it wasn't quite as bleak as all that in the long run. Here's the other truth that's revealed over time: even though such vital, creative movements burn & fade all too quickly -- the Romantics, the Transcendentalists, the Beats, the 1960s, to name just a few -- their spirit outlives those who pronounce their dismissive obituaries. In countless places across the globe today, young people discover William Blake, Thoreau, Jack Kerouac, Dylan. And the spark is rekindled once more, and hope rises like a star in the darkness.Most highly recommended!",5,A memory of idealism & shadows,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,3234,"['Thanksgiving', 'approaches', 'certain', 'age', 'invariably', 'hear', 'strains', 'Alice', 'Restaurant', 'playing', 'heads', 'Which', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'thoughtful', 'movie', 'once', 'more', 'reacquainting', 'what', 'are', 'now', 'legendary', 'days', ""'m"", 'sure', 'seem', 'bit', 'implausible', 'unreal', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'times', 'rest', 'assured', 'shambling', 'rough-edged', 'absurdist', 'tones', 'are', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'evocation', 'days.We', 'know', 'basic', 'story', 'how', 'Arlo', 'was', 'arrested', 'littering', 'how', 'criminal', 'blot', 'record', 'made', 'unfit', 'draft', 'What', 'interesting', 'are', 'two', 'counterpoints', 'work', 'here', 'director', 'more', 'critical', 'judgmental', 'eye', 'Arlo', 'mellow', 'retrospective', 'commentary', 'Which', 'closer', 'truth', 'Well', 'are', 'what', 'movie', 'lasting', 'impact', 'too', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'dated', 'who', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'really', 'missing', 'larger', 'picture', 'intersection', 'idealism', 'experience', 'hope', 'loss', 'despair', 'renewal', 'one', 'generation', 'just', 'such', 'things', 'were', 'writ', 'very', 'large', 'indeed', '1960s.So', 'see', 'naive', 'determined', 'hope', 'Arlo', 'friends', 'create', 'newer', 'world', 'one', 'free', 'hypocrisies', 'betrayals', 'past', 'Again', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'more', 'cynical', 'distance', 'young', 'people', 'really', 'did', 'believe', 'transformation', 'was', 'possible', 'did', 'best', 'live', 'had', 'already', 'taken', 'place', 'might', 'have', 'proven', 'impossible', 'dream', 'was', 'beautiful', 'positive', 'one.And', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'basics', 'human', 'nature', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'especially', 'central', 'character', 'Alice', 'knew', 'hippie', 'earth', 'mothers', 'naive', 'young', 'man', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'burden', 'living', 'such', 'archetypal', 'role', 'was', 'more', 'most', 'flesh-', '-blood', 'could', 'bear', 'length', 'time', 'Even', 'hope', 'toll.Which', 'brings', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'funeral', 'snow', 'disintegration', 'brief', 'communal', 'moment', 'Never', 'was', 'song', 'more', 'aptly', 'chosen', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'Songs', 'Aging', 'Children', 'Come', 'never', 'was', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'always', 'mind', 'last', 'lines', 'James', 'Joyce', 'Dead', 'snow', 'falling', 'universe', 'living', 'dead.And', 'then', 'see', 'temporary', 'family', 'pulls', 'apart', 'when', 'Ray', 'need', 'control', 'things', 'keep', 'everything', 'captured', 'amber', 'one', 'instant', 'very', 'thing', 'sought', 'preserve', 'there', 'sadder', 'sight', 'drive', 'away', 'church', 'Alice', 'standing', 'forlornly', 'bare', 'trees', 'Arlo', 'commentary', 'track', 'decades', 'later', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'bleak', 'long', 'run', 'Here', 'other', 'truth', 'revealed', 'time', 'even', 'such', 'vital', 'creative', 'movements', 'burn', 'fade', 'too', 'quickly', 'Romantics', 'Transcendentalists', 'Beats', '1960s', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'spirit', 'outlives', 'who', 'pronounce', 'dismissive', 'obituaries', 'countless', 'places', 'globe', 'today', 'young', 'people', 'discover', 'William', 'Blake', 'Thoreau', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'Dylan', 'spark', 'rekindled', 'once', 'more', 'hope', 'rises', 'star', 'darkness.Most', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

565688,AZTOAD13FDS58,B000053VAR,ZenPenguin,"[7, 11]","I was one year old when this movie came out. Growing up I had all the influences of the 60's and none of the benefits. So I can understand how someone in their early 20s during the late 60's could identify with this movie, but I really can't relate to the lifestyle. Some of the ""free spirit"" attitudes just made no sense to me. The hippies seemed to have no sense of responsibility or accountability; maybe that was the point, but certain scenes didn't really stress the negative aspects of this attitude. The young mother dragging on a joint holding a newborn, or Alice hooking-up with the junkie behind Ray's back. These scenes were at the parts meant to accentuating the positive side of free spirits, not the negative; but I can?t see anyone in any decade thinking a woman getting stoned holding a baby is cool. Also, the hippies seemed a little over the top in begin jerks to poor Officer Obie. Chill out, the guy's only doing his job. After all, for being hippies, Arlo WAS littering up nature. And I couldn't really get over the fact that a bunch of kids who have no jobs (Alice seemed to fail miserably at the Restaurant) could afford a huge Thanksgiving dinner or that megaparty-wedding. Where'd they get the money? Since this movie in part idealizes hippie life, I can only wonder about the reality of hippie life.I guess I really didn't know what to expect when I rented the movie. Since the song is satirical and a little caustic, I expected the movie to be the same; but it bounced back and forth all over the place. The song ''Alice's Restaurant'' is fantastic as a biting commentary on the draft and the establishment, but the movie jumps from enacting the song, to showcasing the free hippie life, to a drug overdose death (which is distinctly NOT funny), to slapping women and becoming an ugly drunk. Nor was there any character development, not even with Arlo, who at the end makes the comment ""I've got a lot of hard traveling to do"" (like, what have you been doing so far?). The director's many messages were ultimately muddied and lost. Other period movies with much the same themes (MASH, Catch 22, Harold and Maude, Easy Rider) were more successful in getting their underlying messages across.Ok, maybe I'm overanalyzing. It would have been pretty cool to be at that Thanksgiving dinner (although I wouldn't have wanted to deal with the War). And there are some absolutely great aspects to this movie. Probably the best is Arlo's commentary. I saw the movie a second time with the commentary on and it is an absolute riot. 35 years later that guy is STILL a crackup. The music is really very good too, especially the folk music with Pete Seeger. Arlo is a great musician. And Tina Chen is gorgeous - she's worth renting the DVD alone (kudos to the director for hiring an Asian-American to play the girlfriend at the height of the Vietnam War). So I give the DVD a solid 3 stars. It's worth a view if you have any interest in the 60's scene, and I'm sure many people will love it and want to own it.",3,Free Love and Freaky Hippies...,1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,3022,"['was', 'one', 'year', 'old', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'Growing', 'up', 'had', 'influences', '60', 'none', 'benefits', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'someone', 'early', '20s', 'late', '60', 'could', 'identify', 'movie', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'lifestyle', 'free', 'spirit', 'attitudes', 'just', 'made', 'sense', 'hippies', 'seemed', 'have', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'accountability', 'maybe', 'was', 'point', 'certain', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'stress', 'negative', 'aspects', 'attitude', 'young', 'mother', 'dragging', 'joint', 'holding', 'newborn', 'Alice', 'hooking-up', 'junkie', 'Ray', 'back', 'scenes', 'were', 'parts', 'meant', 'accentuating', 'positive', 'side', 'free', 'spirits', 'not', 'negative', 'can', 't', 'see', 'anyone', 'decade', 'thinking', 'woman', 'getting', 'stoned', 'holding', 'baby', 'cool', 'Also', 'hippies', 'seemed', 'little', 'top', 'begin', 'jerks', 'poor', 'Officer', 'Obie', 'Chill', 'out', 'guy', 'only', 'doing', 'job', 'being', 'hippies', 'Arlo', 'WAS', 'littering', 'up', 'nature', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'fact', 'bunch', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'jobs', 'Alice', 'seemed', 'fail', 'miserably', 'Restaurant', 'could', 'afford', 'huge', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'megaparty-wedding', 'Where', ""'d"", 'get', 'money', 'movie', 'part', 'idealizes', 'hippie', 'life', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'reality', 'hippie', 'life.I', 'guess', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'rented', 'movie', 'song', 'satirical', 'little', 'caustic', 'expected', 'movie', 'be', 'same', 'bounced', 'back', 'forth', 'place', 'song', 'Alice', 'Restaurant', 'fantastic', 'biting', 'commentary', 'draft', 'establishment', 'movie', 'jumps', 'enacting', 'song', 'showcasing', 'free', 'hippie', 'life', 'drug', 'overdose', 'death', 'distinctly', 'NOT', 'funny', 'slapping', 'women', 'becoming', 'ugly', 'drunk', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'even', 'Arlo', 'who', 'end', 'comment', ""'ve"", 'got', 'lot', 'hard', 'traveling', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'so', 'far', 'director', 'many', 'messages', 'were', 'ultimately', 'muddied', 'lost', 'Other', 'period', 'movies', 'much', 'same', 'themes', 'MASH', 'Catch', '22', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'were', 'more', 'successful', 'getting', 'underlying', 'messages', 'across.Ok', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'overanalyzing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'cool', 'be', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'wanted', 'deal', 'War', 'are', 'absolutely', 'great', 'aspects', 'movie', 'Probably', 'best', 'Arlo', 'commentary', 'saw', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'commentary', 'absolute', 'riot', '35', 'years', 'later', 'guy', 'STILL', 'crackup', 'music', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'especially', 'folk', 'music', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'Arlo', 'great', 'musician', 'Tina', 'Chen', 'gorgeous', 'worth', 'renting', 'DVD', 'alone', 'kudos', 'director', 'hiring', 'Asian-American', 'play', 'girlfriend', 'height', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'give', 'DVD', 'solid', '3', 'stars', 'view', 'have', 'interest', '60', 'scene', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'want', 'own']",N/A
