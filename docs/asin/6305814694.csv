Even the movie Deep Blue tried hard to avoid being thought of as Jaws 5.  Why is that?Probably because this sorry piece of filming terminated the giant shark in more ways than one.

479842,A34QGZBQIG3U0E,6305814694,"Barbara L. Lemaster ""Bibliophile""","[0, 1]","This film, the fourth in a franchise inspired by Peter Benchley's novel ""Jaws"" could be used by either the MST3K crew for episode fodder or by a film school to show how not to make an action-adventure film.The fact that scenes from the original and far superior ""Jaws"" are spliced into this film might make the viewer rush to eject this film and watch Spielberg's first blockbuster.  Nevertheless, the film is good stupid fun if you really have nothing better to do.The film starts with Mrs. Brody's youngest son Sean (the baby on the beach in the original and the kid on the sailboat in the second) being attacked and killed at night by (presumably) a Great White shark.  Mrs. Brody is inconsolable, and she orders her other son, Mike, to stop working as a marine biologist in the Bahamas.  He invites her to visit him partly because he's concerned about her mental state and partly to assuage her fears that he will soon become the victim of a shark attack.She goes to the Bahamas and meets a single pilot named Hoagie (played by Michael Caine).  She seems to sense that a Great White is lurking nearby and, sure enough, Mike is stalked through a sunken ship by one and her granddaughter is nearly eaten while riding a banana boat on the beach.  Interestingly enough, the boat used in this film is located in 60 feet of water off the shore of Nassau, Bahamas, and local dive stores use it for wreck dives.  I dove this wreck in 1998.Mrs. Brody decides to take matters into her own hands and kill the shark herself so she steals her son's boat.  Hoagie and Mike find her (spotting the boat and shark from Hoagie's plane) and they all battle the shark before the film's glorious conclusion: the shark being impaled on the bowsprit of the boat.The fact that in many scenes the shark is so obviously fake so as to make one's eyes roll is one reason the film was panned.  Secondly, Mrs. Brody has flashbacks to events she did not personally witness (Chief Brody's killing the original shark and her son Sean's death as examples); even Roger Ebert pointed this glaring flaw out.If you want a stupid shark movie, this will do unless you watch ""Shark Attack 3: Megalodon"" which is even more stupid.",2,"Wherefore art thou, Chief Brody?",1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,2192,"['film', 'fourth', 'franchise', 'inspired', 'Peter', 'Benchley', 'novel', 'Jaws', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'MST3K', 'crew', 'episode', 'fodder', 'film', 'school', 'show', 'how', 'not', 'make', 'action-adventure', 'film.The', 'fact', 'scenes', 'original', 'far', 'superior', 'Jaws', 'are', 'spliced', 'film', 'might', 'make', 'viewer', 'rush', 'eject', 'film', 'watch', 'Spielberg', 'first', 'blockbuster', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'good', 'stupid', 'fun', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do.The', 'film', 'Mrs.', 'Brody', 'youngest', 'son', 'Sean', 'baby', 'beach', 'original', 'kid', 'sailboat', 'second', 'being', 'attacked', 'killed', 'night', 'presumably', 'Great', 'White', 'shark', 'Mrs.', 'Brody', 'inconsolable', 'orders', 'other', 'son', 'Mike', 'stop', 'working', 'marine', 'biologist', 'Bahamas', 'visit', 'partly', 'concerned', 'mental', 'state', 'partly', 'assuage', 'fears', 'will', 'soon', 'become', 'victim', 'shark', 'attack.She', 'Bahamas', 'single', 'pilot', 'named', 'Hoagie', 'played', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'sense', 'Great', 'White', 'lurking', 'nearby', 'sure', 'enough', 'Mike', 'stalked', 'sunken', 'ship', 'one', 'granddaughter', 'nearly', 'eaten', 'riding', 'banana', 'boat', 'beach', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'boat', 'used', 'film', 'located', '60', 'feet', 'water', 'shore', 'Nassau', 'Bahamas', 'local', 'dive', 'stores', 'use', 'wreck', 'dives', 'dove', 'wreck', '1998.Mrs', 'Brody', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'kill', 'shark', 'son', 'boat', 'Hoagie', 'Mike', 'find', 'spotting', 'boat', 'shark', 'Hoagie', 'plane', 'battle', 'shark', 'film', 'glorious', 'conclusion', 'shark', 'being', 'impaled', 'bowsprit', 'boat.The', 'fact', 'many', 'scenes', 'shark', 'so', 'obviously', 'fake', 'so', 'make', 'one', 'eyes', 'roll', 'one', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'panned', 'Secondly', 'Mrs.', 'Brody', 'flashbacks', 'events', 'did', 'not', 'personally', 'witness', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'killing', 'original', 'shark', 'son', 'Sean', 'death', 'examples', 'even', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'pointed', 'glaring', 'flaw', 'out.If', 'want', 'stupid', 'shark', 'movie', 'will', 'do', 'watch', 'Shark', 'Attack', '3', 'Megalodon', 'even', 'more', 'stupid']",Jaws 4:Revenge VHS

I felt sorry for Michael Caine for being in it. I am glad he was paid heavily and atleast the film was good for someone as it was never good for the viewers. It's a waste of time. Sadly you stare at the screen wondering how a character who has been chewing on by the shark for five minutes all of the sudden is alive at the end. The film wasn't scary it was sad.This is the type of film they show to young filmmakers to show them how not to make a film. They usually start with the positives. The first step was hiring a good actor. In this case Michael Caine. But they forgot to follow the rest of the steps in making a good film like writing a script that makes sense and write characters the audience will care about if they are in danger of being eaten by a giant shark.The acting was awful. Lorraine Gary is a capable actress but she can't overcome the poorly written script. Caine can't do enough to make the film worth watching. Lance Guest normally does alright in his movies but here he was especially bad. Do yourself a favor and instead of watching this go rent Jaws and rewatch Robert Shaw's famous speech on the boat in the first Jaws it will help you to remember the brilliance of the first movie and how the way the film should be remembered.

479848,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6305814694,Carl Manes,"[3, 3]","Considered by most to be the worst film in the series, JAWS: THE REVENGE has earned a notorious reputation for its laughable plot and poor designs, but logical inconsistencies aside, there is still plenty of killer shark action to be enjoyed here. After Shawn Brody is killed by yet another Great White shark, his mother becomes obsessed with the idea that the sharks are out to destroy her family. She demands that Mike, their eldest son, quits his research in the Caribbean to ensure his safety, but when Mike and his research partner discover a Great White prowling the warm waters of the Bahamas, they set off to study the man-eater. How or why a Great White could have made it down to the Bahamas is besides the point. What is important in this third sequel is that the shark is there, and it is royally pissed. This is easily the cruelest and most violent of any of the JAWS films, where the shark literally has to go out of its way to attack everything and anything in its way (planes not excluded). After the Brody family killed four of the shark's closest relatives, it has finally come back to even the score! It is also the darkest film in the series, lacking the lighter humor that broke up the terror and suspense of the earlier films. Lance Guest offers the most memorable take on Mike Brody, bringing a seriousness and intensity to the role despite the silliness of the plot. There is one element present in THE REVENGE that manages to successfully recreate the same heart-racing anxiety of John Williams' original theme, and that is the shark's heart-rate monitor that thumps aggressively as the shark draws nearer. What can't be denied or overlooked is the dreadful design of the shark, itself, which is as unconvincing as it is unintentionally funny. Michael Caine said it best when asked about the film after its release: ""I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.""

479849,A2XUIU2GOMA68G,6305814694,"Carlos Donoso Kronfle ""-CDK-""","[3, 4]","I hadn't witnessed this fiasco since I was a little kid, and I still remember thinking back then how pathetic this movie was. I once had claimed that Batman and Robin was the worst movie in history, but after watching this again, I can tell you it's even.Many things I noticed this time, things that I was too young to do when I first watched this garbage. Bear with me:First:""Jaws the Revenge"" (And this time personal) is the story of a shark that is LITERALLY out for revenge! It first attacked the youngest of the Brody's and now is after the other sibling, even the sibling's daughter at one point of the flick. Indeed, this shark is so smart that he can track the bloodline of Chief Brody (rest in peace) in order to attack his remains;  smartest shark in history? Very much so.  It is also incredibly smart that it was able to follow the Brody family from their hometown Amity to all the way to... ready? The Bahamas! Yup, it overheard the conversation hundreds of miles from shore or simply knew by how the water tasted at distant that the folks had temporarily relocated.Another flaw of the deprived film is how the shark would literally lift himself up (15 to 20 feet approximately), and take a bite of the side of the boat for either intimidation purposes or to catch its prey, as it happened with the first victim. Since when can sharks elevate at such height and literally out of nowhere decide to munch on the side of a vessel? I don't care if it's just a `movie' but it's not a cartoon either.Did I mention that this shark can roar? Yes, that too! This shark not only has the brains but also `thee' vocal chords. His roaring makes a grown lion look like a cub. To top things off it also has a big grin throughout the whole movie. You may think it is smiling and smirking but the truth is it was so poorly designed that its creators forgot to make it look like an actual shark (And stop showing off its teeth on every appearance).The black dude in the end, after getting chewed by the fantastic beast incredibly managed to survive. Don't ask me how but I guess since it's a movie he knew how to pull that one off.In the long run, I recommend everyone to watch this film; not because it's good, on the contrary, to realize how bad and absurd it is. Sometimes you have to see it to believe it. The eighties are popular for producing tacky and cheesy films, but this one takes the cake.I read an interview of Michael Caine not so long ago, where he admitted in never watching this movie (mind you, he was part of the supporting cast).

Living with her is her youngest son, SEAN BRODY (played by Mitchell Anderson). Sean is engaged to be married. He plans to marry his fianc&eacute;e, TIFFANY (played by Mary Smith) sometime in January, the following year. Right now, they are about to celebrate Christmas. Sean is now a deputy, where Martin Brody, his father, had worked. Martin Brody had sadly died of a heart attack, some years ago. His obsession with a possible third shark entering Amity and wrecking havoc again had caused heart attack.The next night, Ellen is leaving work with one of her co-workers. She meets up with Sean and Tiffany. Sean has to stop by the office for a while, while Ellen and Tiffany go out and get a Christmas tree. Sean gets a call about some sort of tie up of some wiring in the middle of the ocean. As he tries to untangle the mess, a great white shark comes up out of nowhere and kills Sean. Ellen Brody is in a deep depression. MICHAEL BRODY (played by Lance Guest) has just arrived from the Bahamas. Michael has been living in the Bahamas with his wife, CARLA (played by Karen Young), and their adorable little daughter, THEA (played by newcomer, Judith Barsi). Michael, Carla, and Thea stay for two days to attend Sean's funeral. The next day, Michael, Carla, and Thea have to return  to the Bahamas, where at that moment, Michael suggests that Ellen go with them to help overcome her grief. She had already lost her husband to a heart attack, and now she has lost her youngest son to a shark. Carla and Thea love the idea of Ellen going home with them, where Ellen decides to go.Flying them on a jet the rest of the way is HOAGIE NEWCOMBE (played by Michael Caine). Hoagie is a very generous man. They arrive at the Bahamas, where Ellen has her fears of the shark that killed Sean. She totally disagrees with Michael's work, where he works underwater, looking breeds of snails. There, Ellen meets Michael's co-worker, JAKE (played by Mario Van Peebles) and his wife, LOUISA (played by Lynn Whitfield). Both Jake and Louisa are very close friends with Michael, Carla, and Hoagie, and they happily befriend Ellen.Some days later, Hoagie takes Ellen out on a little day of fun, trying to provide more help for her to get over Sean's death. Ellen finds herself falling in love with Hoagie, as Hoagie is with her. At that moment, Michael and Jake find an unusual discovery...a great white shark. The shark takes a bite out of their boat and heads on his way. A great white shark is unusual in the Bahamas since the water there is very warm and sharks can't take the warm water. This great white shark is Sean's killer. The shark has followed the Brody's to the Bahamas. Michael and Jake decide not to say anything about this.A week later, while Ellen, Carla, Louisa, and Thea are on the beach while Carla is being awarded for a sculpture she had welded. Carla decides to let Thea ride with her friends on a banana boat. As she is being awarded, the shark appears and attacks the banana boat, where one of the girls' mothers is killed. Thea is fine, but is in severe shock, forcing Ellen to take Michael's boat and head out to destroy this shark once and for all. Michael returns home and finds Carla and Louisa comforting Thea, which is where Michael comes clean of his knowing of the shark. Michael and Jake head out to find Ellen, with the help of Hoagie flying them over to spot her easily. Michael, Hoagie, and Jake find Ellen and climb aboard, where Jake is bitten by the shark and taken down. With Michael and Hoagie's help, Ellen kills the shark off, in revenge of the death of her husband and youngest son. At that moment, the boat tips over and dumps, Michael, Hoagie, and Ellen out into the water, where Jake appears, injured, but still alive. Looks Jake will survive.JAWS: THE REVENGE was definitely a great sequel and was one hell of an improvement of JAWS 3.

Saxelid ""Bookworm""","[0, 1]","Jaws the Revenge has a beautiful transfer, sharp and clean and well matted in the 2:35:1 aspect ratio of its original theatrical presentation, but the movie still stinks to high heaven.Sheriff Deputy Sean Brody (son of the late Sheriff Martin Brody, is killed off when Roy Scheider wisely refused to be in this outing) is killed in the waters off of Amity Island. His distraught mother Ellen Brody (well played by Lorraine Gary) believes that the attack was personally motivated by revenge for the shark that Martin killed in 1975 (readers should note that this movie ignores Jaws 2 and 3-D). Her surviving son Mike (an icthyologist studying sea snails in Bermuda) fears for her mental state and encourages her to join his family for awhile down in the tropics, far away from Amity. Ellen goes and the shark follows for this it is indeed personal.What hampers Jaws the Revenge, aside from a silly story, is that director Joseph Sargent (The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3, Colussus: The Forbin Project) does absolutely nothing with the supernatural concepts or the shark. The attacks scenes are perfunctory in nature, only a sequence where the demon fish chases Michael through the bowels of a sunken ship comes close to generating any kind of suspense, and the mechanical gear operating the shark is painfully visible in several shots. I got the feeling that Sargent wanted this to be more of a people picture. Too bad that screenwriter Michael DeGuzman did not deliver a script that clearly focused on those people.

The plot is actually wonderful, implausible, yet you believe the story and truly sympathize with a grieving mother. However because of some shots that are in very poor taste, the movie is an abysmal popcorn movie you would expect to be featured as a tv movie on SyFy. The shark is obviously fake and mechanical and is suffering from overexposure, watch the scene where they first see it.. you just feel this sense of let down because, there it is in all it's glory chomping away at the boat and everyone in the shot just stands there with their hands in their pockets like .. ""Oh there's a shark.. well isn't that weird"". But again, in their defense, it is so fake even the actors I'm sure had trouble pretending it was real.The best part of this movie is the onscreen chemistry between Hogie and Ellen, it's wonderful to see that Ellen Brody has met someone and being all giddy; but then it is Michael Caine so I'm not sure how much of it was acting.Michael Brody is the stupidest person on earth. He knows the moment he saw that shark that it came for him, the other guy was dangling his feet in the water for a long time and it didn't even try to get him, just in case you don't realize this, someone points it out later in the dialogue. He continually goes down in the water even though he knows the shark is there for him and even allows his daughter to go into the water.Another thing worth pointing out is that whomever, handled this shark obviously had a sense of humor. The shark teeters from side to side like a drunk as it swims and even plays hide and seek growling all the way like a lion.The lone scary moment of the movie comes when the eel scares Michael, that is actually a great shot.

(wait for it) TEENAGERS! To be honest, I don't know what people are complaining about, this was an enjoyable film. I don't find a shark out for revenge against one particular family an impossible, implausible plot device. ""Twister"" made no sense (attach leather belts to a pipe and hold on real tight and you'll be safe, and heck, you'll also get to see the inside of the dang thing!) and yet that made money. A shark roaring? Who cares? If we were scientifically correct in every single film, all the outer space fight scenes in ""Star Wars"", ""Moonraker"" and ""Star Trek"" would be completely boring without the lasers and explosions to accompany the scenes. Same thing goes for the shark traveling from New England to the Bahamas (and surviving) in a short amount of time. Though two things did detract me, however, and I'm sure this first thing has been said before; how can Ellen Brody have flashbacks to the beginning of this movie when she wasn't even present for those events, let alone her having flashbacks to the events of of her husband shooting the shark from the first movie. Second, how the shark died. Now before I get negative remarks, I did do my research on this and all the Jaws films, so I do know about how there was negative audience reaction to the character Jake dying, but I digress. When I saw this movie on TV, there was opening narration as the shark made its way into the town and, I can't really remember but I swear there was a different ending. The shark's head still explodes but it wasn't by ramming the boat into it (and seeing the shark and boat model). Why have two slightly different versions been released? I don't know but now I have to tape this movie again just to make sure I'm not crazy.

If you ask me, I don't believe that a Jaws sequel should always have to include a member of the Brody family.  I feel the same way about Sigorney Weaver in the 'Alien' series.  It doesn't add any freshness or a sense of originality if you just continue to use the same human characters again and again and again, because lets face it, the shark is the real star in the movie.  I say we give it some fresh meat and pitch the leftovers!  This series has the potential to do so much better than this, and it's a travesty to see what it has become.On the other hand, perhaps it's for the best.  The jaws series did nothing but demonzie sharks, especially Great Whites, and have placed them, in various areas around the globe, on the endangered species list.  I'm not saying that the Jaws movies were directly responsible for this. Lots are killed due to sloppy fishing methods, that target anything and everything in the ocean.  But I sure would like it if the next Jaws movie didn't spout so much nonsense about sharks.  I mean, have you watched the trailers.  Some of the lines describing the Great Whites are ludicrous!  &quot;A mindless eating machine, that will attack and devour anything!&quot;  Followed by that line about God creating the devil, and giving him JAWS!&quot;  Marine biologists probably go nuts hearing crap like that, and any kind of animal lover probably would too.  Just because they aren't cute and cuddley doesn't mean they should lose their right to live.  And I would hate to imagine a world where those majestic predators no longer roam the ocean depths.  At the very least, the jaws movies should have a message before the movie telling viewers that it is completley unrealistic, and that sharks do not behave in the manners they potray them.If Universal does attempt to resurrect the Jaws franchise, they should try to make the shark a little more believable, and I'm not just talking about its appearance.

If Jaws the Revenge was released say, 70 years ago, it could have been scary to certain standards, but no sequel, certainly not this one, could ever live up to the original classic or better yet, the Peter Benchley book itself.

It's also very amusing in the way it tries to insert useless cameos and irrelevant flashbacks from the first film in order to spruce up and blind the viewers to what can only be considered a monumental travesty, especially with such a great actor like Michael Caine playing a guy named...Hoagie.

For some reason, its sheer incompetence and discordance strikes me as amusing and for that reason alone I enjoy watching it (it's proudly displayed in my collection).  I've lost track of the number of times I've watched it.  It's definitely an acquired taste.Yes, it's bad on so many levels, seriously, I can't argue with that.  Even more bizarre, it could actually be considered a Christmas movie as so much of it takes place during the holidays.  You can hear Noel sung as the poor Brody boy (Mitchell Anderson) dies in agony, arm chewed off, screaming for all he's worth.  Even the log he was sent out to move could serve as proxy for a Yule log.  Hello, nothing says Merry Christmas like becoming the feast of the day!As for the story this time out; Chief Brody's dead, Sean's dead, and now mother Brody has turned into a loon.  Moreover, the woman has developed a strange psychic connection to this vengeful shark that's willing to go on vacation to the Bahamas just to chew up the rest of the family.  This was a well thought out plot, can't you tell?  They used a boat for pity sake to finally bring it down.  It spontaneously blows up upon contact (we all know just how volatile sharks can be).  That alone proves the miracle of Christmas!  It's all tied in, trust me.I would have loved to have been in the board room when they pitched this idea.It was nominated in several categories for a Golden Raspberry Award: worst actress (Lorraine Gary), worst actor (Bruce the shark), worst supporting actor (Michael Caine), worst screenplay (Michael de Guzman), worst picture, worst director (Joseph Sargent), and it won worst visual effects (Henry Millar).

The result is a series of admittedly scary but otherwise thoroughly pedestrian shock sequences, topped off by flashbacks experienced by Gary to events that she never even witnessed (!!) and a climax that is both totally unbelievable and rather disgusting.JAWS 4 does boast a good music score by Michael Small, and is directed well enough by Joseph Sargent, a journeyman director who has made at least two great films prior to this--1970's COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, and 1974's THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE.

479883,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,6305814694,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[11, 12]","After a Great White shark kills her youngest son, the widowed Ellen Brody comes to the realization that the shark is after her and her loved ones. As ridiculous of this might sound, it turns out that she's right. The vengeful, grudge-holding fish follows the grieving woman along with her son, daugther-in-law and niece to the beautiful Bahamas, I guess to seek revenge? For what, you ask? I have no idea.The scathing reviews this film has received from those who have watched it are justified because this film is unbearably bad. The film-makers thought that in order to make a JAWS sequel, the story must involve the Brody family. In JAWS 2, chief Brody battled another over-grown Great White and in JAWS 3, the Brody sons battled an even bigger shark in Florida's seaworld. In JAWS: THE REVENGE, the homicidal fish returns to torment the Brody's yet again. Talk about an unlucky family. What I do not understand is why is this shark after them? Didn't the shark die in the original film? Didn't the second shark ""cross over"" during the sequel's climax? Is this shark somehow related to the previous sharks; maybe a spouse or a sibling or a cousin? Maybe it wanted to avenge the murder of it's relatives? Maybe ""Bruce"" was somehow resurrected in a Jason Voorhees/Mike Myers kind of way and the scene ended up in the cutting room floor? Help?Another intriguing factor in JAW: THE REVENGE is that the shark roars. Mighty ""Bruce"" roars just like the T-Rex in Jurassic park and if that wasn't enough, it can also jump out of the water and stand on its tail, kinda like Flipper. I was waiting for Michael Caine to throw it a Mackerel and ask it to do a back-flip. Speaking of Michael Caine, he gives the most annoying performance of his entire career.All kidding aside, JAWS: THE REVENGE is definitely the worst film in the series and qualifies as probably one of the worst sequels ever made. The acting is not too bad (Michael Caine being the exception) and I have to give credit where credit is due because you can tell that Lorraine Gary and Lance Guest were taking their roles very seriously and it's a testament to their talents that they were able to keep a straight face throughout this film.The film's horrible climax only adds insult to injury. After her niece was nearly eaten up by the hungry fish, Ms. Brody decides to seek and kill it by herself without any weapons of any kind whatsoever. What was she expecting to do, run the shark over with her boat?There are 2 endings to this film, both equally bad. The original ending had ""Bruce"" being impaled by the Brody's boat. After the film's release and for the Video editions the ending was changed and had the beast mysteriously explode upon impact.

You just think about that for a while.  This is disturbing for a variety of reasons, not the least of which being that 'Orca' was a knockoff of 'Jaws', and is also the stupidest movie ever made, with the possible exception of.... 'Jaws: The Revenge'.-I first saw this movie when I was a little kid.  I thought about it occasionally over the years reflecting on how at the end of the film the shark kinda floats on top of the water on his tail and is impaled on the mast, or whatever, of the ship.  Eventually, after a number of years, I became convinced that I had imagined this.  It was just too stupid to be real.  No frickin' way.  Then I saw this movie again a while back and sure enough the ending happened just as a remembered it.  All this comes together to mean that the ending of this film is so stupid that it is literally beyond belief.  That's somethin'-The shark in this movie roars.  Many others have mentioned this, but it bears repeating.  This is another thing I'd forgotten.  After being reminded of it today I nearly fell over laughing.-Also, the shark is really, really amusing looking.

It  certainly starts off very promisingly.  The death scene of the younger  Brody brother is superbly sinister and the opening sequence features some  wonderfully eerie camera-work.  But most of the film is like a made-for-TV  movie, completely devoid of real thrills.The main problems lie in the  plot, which has more holes than a tramp's vest.  A shark somehow manages to  travel halfway across the world faster than an aeroplane, Ellen Brody has  flashbacks to events she never witnessed, a lot of people die but then turn  out to be 'alright after all' in ludicrously contrived fashion and the  shark explodes for no explained reason.The special effects are pretty  pathetic.  At one point the shark seems to be hovering in the air.  The  characters are dull and irritating and Michael 'my ambition is to be in  every film ever made' Caine is wasted in a thankless role.If you're a  fan of the original Jaws then watch Part 2, which is the definate shark  sequel.

The storyline is a total nonsense.

But I will say that no collection is complete without this movie. It is so wretchedly bad it's funny.First of all, hardly anybody gets eaten. After Jaws gobbles up the youngest Brody son Mom goes on a holiday to get away from Amity Island and it's history...to the Bahamas! Total change of scenery huh? Jaws follows. How? Don't ask me. And he gets there in a day when it would take any ordinary shark about a week minimum.Her elder son works as a marine biologist (surely being attacked by sharks in the first two movies would put him off going in the ocean) and is studying sea snails (presumably he got fired from Sea World after Jaws 3). By pure coincidence (or contrivance), Jaws shows up and pokes his nose into the sea snail research.The shark looks sooooooooooooo fake. It's very obviously nothing but foam rubber with plastic teeth. And it's incredibly stupid. The shark in the first film (and in the surprisingly good second) seemed to be kind of smart and cunning. But now it's just a big lumbering idiot.Why on earth Michael Caine agreed to be in this is beyond me. He even couldn't get to the Oscars to accept his award for Hannah and her Sisters because he was too busy filming this turkey. And the story with him dating Mom Brody takes up a tremendous amount of the film's running time and ends up turning it into a soap opera.The worst thing tho, isn't the elder Brody son's beard or Mario Van Peebles' Jamaican accent. It's the ending. Let me explain what happens...Jaws stands on his tail!On the Water!!Roars like a Lion!!!Is stabbed by the broken mast of a ship......and explodes!!!!Of course!Where on earth the idea for that ending came from is probably best kept a mystery. The fact that it recycles footage from the first film into this ending is a mockery of the original's genius. It should also be noted that this version includes the happy (alternate) ending in Mario Van Peebles survives being chomped across the belly by the big fish.This new DVD release by Universal improves upon the shoddy, OOP Goodtimes release. Gone is the snapper cover, now we have a sturdy keepcase. The picture is now anamorphic and although the 2.35:1 frame has some dirt on it, it's rather sharp.

Not only do I not believe I could sit through this whole movie in one sitting, I am amazed that good money was wasted to make this. When the film was being made did ANYONE ask ""Is this movie going to entertain anyone??""The plot is ridiculous and beyond coherent thought. In Amity Mrs. Brody's son gets killed by a shark. He is in a boat trying to free a log from a buoy, when a Great White leaps from the water and snaps off an arm. After yelling for help and going into an almost believable panic, the shark returns to finish him off. Mrs. Brody is convinced that this shark is on a mission to kill her entire family.So she goes to the Bahamas to stay with her other son for awhile. He is a marine biologist who studies the mating of conch snails. Mario Van Peebles is his over cliched Jamaican partner. Michael Cane comes along for the ride to as a pilot who woos Mrs. Brody.The shark somehow knows all this and the killer great white from the frozen Atlantic travels to the warm clear waters of the Carribean. It then attacks a banana boat with Mrs. Brody's 5 year old granddaughter. Mrs Brody has had enough, she decides to get on a boat, head out into the water, and be eaten by the shark ""It's the only way!!!"" she exclaims.Of course Michael Cane and her son come to her rescue in an airplane. Of course the shark attacks and eats the plane, that's a given. Now the anti-climatic finale of this film is a roaring shark getting zapped by a Black and Decker flashlight. I'm not even going to explain this. It is stunned long enough for the boat to ram into the shark CAUSING IT TO EXPLODE! I rewound it to make sure I got it right, and yes the shark exploded.Now you know a sequel is on very weak legs when you are about to kill the shark and the screen shows flashbacks of the shark getting killed in the first Jaws.This is by far the worst Jaws movie of the franchise and is possibly one of the worst movies ever made.

479905,AR2JF8MCZ54JM,6305814694,Joshua Chipman,"[11, 13]","First off, I must be honest: I get a kick out of these plastic-sharkfests (which I admit sounds a little suggestive), and there was a time when I thought this movie was actually as scary as its predecessors. But that was when I was ten years old, just after it had been first released.  Since that time, I've grown to have just a little bit more seasoned moviegoing tastes...and while now and then I may watch 'Jaws 2' for a few meager shivers or even 'Jaws 3-D' for a laugh, this one defies belief even for a 'Jaws' movie.  Somewhere along the line, Universal execs must have figured 'Jaws 3-D' turned out so ludicrously that they said to themselves, 'We'll go ahead with another one, and we'll just go back to Amity Island and be as straightlaced about it as possible...' which probably impressed the execs, until somebody said, 'only THIS time let's try to make it so that the audience will think that one shark after another can keep going after the same group of people and not be ridiculous!'  And that must have really tickled their inept fancy, because they managed to crap this turd out.To start with, the film's very premise is even more absurd than that of 'Jaws 3-D', which at least was hackneyed enough for anyone watching that one to crack up. Instead of a giant shark breaking into an underwater theme park, this time we have a giant shark who somehow seems to have some mysterious psychic link with Ellen Brody (played once again by Lorraine Gary, who I'm guessing felt she was typecast by this point and just went with it, or did it as a favor to her then-CEO husband at the studio, I can't say).  It's bad enough poor Sean Brody bites it (or rather, the other way around) in the first five minutes after being established as an Amity police officer like his pop; even worse when director Joseph Sargent decides to get masochistic and remind us that Roy Scheider won't be coming back to save anyone from this mess: apparently the Chief died of a heart attack some years prior to the film's events, and a photo of him in the police office only serves to aggravate the agony of what is to follow.And what DOES follow is an idiotic attempt to make the viewer believe:1) That a great white shark would actually target a specific bloodline.2) That said shark would be so bent on eating everyone in that bloodline that it will actively pursue them all the way to the Bahamas and stay there until the job is done - despite the fact that the water is just too damn warm for a real shark to tolerate that long.3) That said shark can not only launch itself completely out of the water (which nowadays isn't all that silly a notion if you've seen any of these 'Air Jaws' documentaries on the Discovery Channel), but can stay there suspended for several minutes (Look! it's Matrix Shark!).4) That the shark's intended victim will actually have psychic premonitions that it's coming to get them.5) That a boat twice as big as the Orca (Quint's boat from the first film) could actually be sunk by the weight of a shark stuck on its bowsprit (yeah, yeah, I know they blew the shark up in the original ending. Perhaps Sargent felt that having a fourth shark die the same way was a little tiresome...but then what else CAN you do to get rid of a shark that big?)6) And that Michael Caine actually starred in this piece of garbage. That's one for six.And in terms of casting, everything's just wrong.  Again, studio-head's-wife Lorraine Gary was probably wanting a few extra bucks, but Academy-Award-winner Michael Caine should have known better (Roy Scheider DID, which could be good or bad depending on your point of view). Mario Van Peebles' career was just beginning, so he can be afforded at least one disaster; but Mike Brody this time is portrayed by Lance Guest - yeah, the same Lance Guest who lived out every sci-fi geek's dream in 'The Last Starfighter'.  Cheesy as that movie was, this was a horrific downgrade for Mr. Guest.  What's worse, the actress playing his wife in this one seems utterly frigid and despondent, except when she's in her shop making metal sculptures, sooty and dirty with blowtorch in hand (which again is a little suggestive, there).  Everything about 'Jaws 3-D' was goofy, to be sure, but even Bess Armstrong's character is sorely missed this time around.In the end, though, the failure and cinematic abomination that is 'Jaws: The Revenge' finally put a franchise that had no right to be a franchise out to pasture, so some good did come of this film.  But if I were you, I'd steer well clear of this dungheap of a sequel.And if you wanna see the great Michael Caine in a ridiculous movie, see 'Goldmember'.",1,Horrible Beyond Description...But I'll

The first one is absolutely terrifying. I mean it still causes generations of people to be afraid of going in the water. What other movie has that impact? The second one was just trying to capitalize on the first one. The third one was gimicky with some pretty bad 3D effects. And then there's this one.It's full of inconsistencies and just absolute non-sense. Just read the other reviews. They got it right on. But this movie has a charm that just appeals to me.

479909,A7IIPRUAEZ2N6,6305814694,Kendrik Lau,"[1, 2]","Everybody is entitled to his or her opinion, but those people who would give this piece of shark turd of a movie a four star rating, I would love to see what other kind of movies you watch.Jaws: The Revenge is simply one of the worst movies that have ever graced the silver screen. I am sure that many straight to video films were better shot and plotted. There are so many stupid and inane things about this film that the fact that the shark roared (the shark also roared in the first and second movie) and it looked fake is the least of its problems.The problem is, the storyline is so thin and pointless and in the process of stretching this wreck to movie length, that the entire movie is filled with scenes that added nothing to the plot or characterss.The plot is, as you probably know already, Sean, the younger son of Ellen and the now deceased Martin Brody got killed (that means Marge from Jaws 2 shouldn've let him get eaten anyway) and Ellen is convinced that a shark did it and is exacting revenge on the Brody family.Michael, the older son, persuades Ellen to join him and his wife and daughter in the Bahamas so she can get her mind off Sean's death. The Bahamas is surronded by water, but water too warm for great whites. But in this case, that didn't deter the revenge seeking shark from swimming all the way from New Enlgand to the Caribbean in pursuit of the Brodys.Meanwhile, Ellen meets Hoagie, played by Michael Caine, who apparently used his salary to purchase a home in the Bahamas and have yet to even saw this film. The two began courting while a jealous Michael glowers from the sidelines.The shark, once it arrives in the Bahamas, chases after Michael and his faux-Jamaican assistant played by Mario Van Peebles in one failed attempt after another to eat them. When the shark finally targeted Michael's daughter Thea, Ellen commandeered a boat and ram it into the shark and in Lorraine Gary's own words, in a way you wouldn't believe.How right she was.So that is the story in a nutshell and all could probably be squeezed into a one-hour TV episode; but that won't do for a theatrical release, so they padded it with endless scenes of Ellen and Hoagie romancing one another, or Michael and his wife arguing about who haven't been taking out the garbage. And the shark attacks were so few and far in between that I wonder if Lorraine Gary and Michael Caine were actually making another movie entirely and somewhere half-way through they decided to make it into a Jaws sequel and shoehorned the shark into the proceedings.And most maddeningly of all, in an act of utter desecration and desperation, they spliced in scenes from the first movie, supposedly to represent Ellen remembering events from the past (and most of which she was not witness to, ironically, but not surprsing given how stupid this film is).As for people who defends this movie, a great white shark lurking in the waters of New England in the first movie is probably as improbable as a great white taking personal vengeance on the Brodys, but at least the first movie was so well made that it makes you suspend your disbelief and overlook some of its flaws (like the exploding scuba tank and the roaring shark).In the end, this movie disgraced the legacy of the very first movie. The fact there are Jaws ripoffs out there that are actually better than this movie is a sad commentary.",1,"BORING, POINTLESS AND TOOTHLESS",1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,3379,"['Everybody', 'entitled', 'opinion', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'piece', 'shark', 'turd', 'movie', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'kind', 'movies', 'watch.Jaws', 'Revenge', 'simply', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'graced', 'silver', 'screen', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'straight', 'video', 'films', 'were', 'better', 'shot', 'plotted', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'stupid', 'inane', 'things', 'film', 'fact', 'shark', 'roared', 'shark', 'also', 'roared', 'first', 'second', 'movie', 'looked', 'fake', 'least', 'problems.The', 'problem', 'storyline', 'so', 'thin', 'pointless', 'process', 'stretching', 'wreck', 'movie', 'length', 'entire', 'movie', 'filled', 'scenes', 'added', 'nothing', 'plot', 'characterss.The', 'plot', 'probably', 'know', 'already', 'Sean', 'younger', 'son', 'Ellen', 'now', 'deceased', 'Martin', 'Brody', 'got', 'killed', 'Marge', 'Jaws', '2', 'shouldn', ""'ve"", 'let', 'get', 'eaten', 'anyway', 'Ellen', 'convinced', 'shark', 'did', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'Brody', 'family.Michael', 'older', 'son', 'Ellen', 'join', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Bahamas', 'can', 'get', 'mind', 'Sean', 'death', 'Bahamas', 'surronded', 'water', 'water', 'too', 'warm', 'great', 'whites', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'deter', 'revenge', 'seeking', 'shark', 'swimming', 'way', 'New', 'Enlgand', 'Caribbean', 'pursuit', 'Brodys.Meanwhile', 'Ellen', 'Hoagie', 'played', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'apparently', 'used', 'salary', 'purchase', 'home', 'Bahamas', 'have', 'yet', 'even', 'saw', 'film', 'two', 'began', 'courting', 'jealous', 'Michael', 'glowers', 'sidelines.The', 'shark', 'Bahamas', 'Michael', 'faux-Jamaican', 'assistant', 'played', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'one', 'failed', 'attempt', 'eat', 'When', 'shark', 'finally', 'targeted', 'Michael', 'daughter', 'Thea', 'Ellen', 'commandeered', 'boat', 'ram', 'shark', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'own', 'words', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe.How', 'right', 'was.So', 'story', 'nutshell', 'could', 'probably', 'be', 'squeezed', 'one-hour', 'TV', 'episode', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'theatrical', 'release', 'padded', 'endless', 'scenes', 'Ellen', 'Hoagie', 'romancing', 'one', 'Michael', 'wife', 'arguing', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'taking', 'out', 'garbage', 'shark', 'attacks', 'were', 'so', 'few', 'far', 'wonder', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'were', 'actually', 'making', 'movie', 'entirely', 'somewhere', 'half-way', 'decided', 'make', 'Jaws', 'sequel', 'shoehorned', 'shark', 'proceedings.And', 'most', 'maddeningly', 'act', 'utter', 'desecration', 'desperation', 'spliced', 'scenes', 'first', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'represent', 'Ellen', 'remembering', 'events', 'past', 'most', 'was', 'not', 'witness', 'ironically', 'not', 'surprsing', 'given', 'how', 'stupid', 'film', '.As', 'people', 'who', 'movie', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'lurking', 'waters', 'New', 'England', 'first', 'movie', 'probably', 'as', 'improbable', 'great', 'white', 'taking', 'personal', 'vengeance', 'Brodys', 'least', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'exploding', 'scuba', 'tank', 'roaring', 'shark', 'end', 'movie', 'disgraced', 'legacy', 'very', 'first', 'movie', 'fact', 'are', 'Jaws', 'ripoffs', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'actually', 'better', 'movie', 'sad', 'commentary']",Jaws 4:Revenge VHS

But it's better than 2 and 3, so that's a start.  This time, Lorraine Gary is now a widow (not really sure what happened to Roy Scheider?), and her youngest son is killed by a great white on Christmas Eve.  She thinks the shark came back (I thought it got exploded twice?) for revenge.  Her oldest son (Lance Guest) persuades her to come visit him in the Bahamas to help heal the wounds.  She wants him to stop working in the water, but he's a scientist studying of all things snails and he doesn't want to give it up.  Gary meets and falls for suave pilot Michael Caine (He'll do anything it seems), and just when things start looking up, here comes the great white to wreak havoc again.  It's all pretty silly and Mario van Peebles is simpy awful as the rastaman associate.  The IMDB says Peebles wrote his own dialogue; what a crime--it's terrible.  So why 3 stars?

Had the producers pulled a fast one on all of us by making us think it was going to be a thriller, then gone from one ridiculous and implausible development to the next to make a Jaws 'Scary Movie' years before its time? I'd love to say that was the case, but it also became more and more clear as the movie went on that all this was meant to be taken seriously. Somebody has a confrontation with a shark, after which the shark travels thousands of kilometres to track that person down. Somebody spots a shark while flying overhead in a light aircraft and has the bright idea of crashing the plane kamikaze-style into the shark in an attempt to kill it. Of course it fails dismally and they all have near-death experiences, but to be honest I can't say how they killed the shark in the end, as by this point the whole film just seemed to have been a waste of time and my concentration was drifting. I cannot fathom how Michael Caine got involved in the project, he surely must have been severely broke to have even considered it.

479920,A2JU4FUSW1PBEC,6305814694,Michael Pappalardo,"[2, 3]","Jaws was a fantastic film and is probably one of the best films in movie history. Jaws 2 was no where near as good, but was still, in itself, a fairly good sequel. Jaws 3 was just too much. Originally, that movie was not even supposed to be a Jaws movie, but dialog was edited and cut to make it a Jaws movie. And a very poor one at that. Unfortunately they didn't learn. This movie is not as bad as 3, but that really isn't saying much.Quite a shame, really...the characters in the movie are actually quite likable.  Character development is actually handled rather well, and Michael Caine also manages to liven up the movie a bit with some tales to make you chuckle.  But it's the overall plot of the movie that makes it so bad.  If this wasn't a Jaws movie, it may actually have been a good movie all together.  The concept of a shark out of revenge.......sorry...that just really makes no sense whatsoever.  Mike Brody is back after a family tragedy, and his mother (role reprised by Lorraine Gary) is convinced that its 'The Shark' and its back for revenge.  You will also see some of the original cast of Jaws reprising their roles alongside Ellen Brody, such as Mrs. Kintner and police deputy(Still a deputy after all these years???).Mario Van Peebles is Mike's research buddy and adds comic relief to the film. There is a rather poigniant moment that is a throwback to the original Jaws, with Mike and his daughter acting out the same scene that Chief Brody and Sean did at the dinner table in the original classic with the copycat game. Other than that, this movie is full of action, but there are many things that just go beyond the realm of nonsense and stupidity, namely the shark with a mind for vengeance.What is very odd is that there are several versions of this movie. When you see this movie on TBS or TNT (At least once a month on a sunday afternoon, you WILL see it), Jake(Mario Van Peebles) will either be alive or dead at the end of the movie, and the then end scene will be either the theatrical movie ending, or a badly cut and pasted scene from the ending of the first movie. Very odd. Randomly on TV they change it. This particular edition of the movie features the 'new' footage, with Jake actually being alive at the end. All in all, a bad movie mainly because it has taken the Jaws series WAY too far. IT should have stopped at Jaws 2. Even Jaws 2 was slightly overkill. Let a good name rest. If you want a mindless action movie with a poor plot, then go for this. Personally, I recommend the same thing i did for Jaws 3:If you are lounging in bed and feeling lazy on a Sunday afternoon, and you happen upon this movie on TBS or TNT(Like I said, at least once every month or so), by all means watch it. Rent it if you must, but don't buy it, becuase you'll watch it once and probably not watch it again.",2,Why didn't they stop at Jaws 2?,991785600,"06 6, 2001",2001,2832,"['Jaws', 'was', 'fantastic', 'film', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'movie', 'history', 'Jaws', '2', 'was', 'where', 'near', 'good', 'was', 'still', 'fairly', 'good', 'sequel', 'Jaws', '3', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'Originally', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'Jaws', 'movie', 'dialog', 'was', 'edited', 'cut', 'make', 'Jaws', 'movie', 'very', 'poor', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'bad', '3', 'really', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much.Quite', 'shame', 'really', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'likable', 'Character', 'development', 'actually', 'handled', 'rather', 'well', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'also', 'liven', 'up', 'movie', 'bit', 'tales', 'make', 'chuckle', 'overall', 'plot', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'Jaws', 'movie', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'together', 'concept', 'shark', 'revenge', '.sorry', 'just', 'really', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'Mike', 'Brody', 'back', 'family', 'tragedy', 'mother', 'role', 'reprised', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'convinced', ""'The"", 'Shark', 'back', 'revenge', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'original', 'cast', 'Jaws', 'reprising', 'roles', 'alongside', 'Ellen', 'Brody', 'such', 'Mrs.', 'Kintner', 'police', 'deputy', 'Still', 'deputy', 'years', '.Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'Mike', 'research', 'buddy', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'rather', 'poigniant', 'moment', 'throwback', 'original', 'Jaws', 'Mike', 'daughter', 'acting', 'out', 'same', 'scene', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'Sean', 'did', 'dinner', 'table', 'original', 'classic', 'copycat', 'game', 'Other', 'movie', 'full', 'action', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'just', 'go', 'realm', 'nonsense', 'stupidity', 'namely', 'shark', 'mind', 'vengeance.What', 'very', 'odd', 'are', 'several', 'versions', 'movie', 'When', 'see', 'movie', 'TBS', 'TNT', 'least', 'once', 'month', 'sunday', 'afternoon', 'WILL', 'see', 'Jake', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'alive', 'dead', 'end', 'movie', 'then', 'end', 'scene', 'will', 'be', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'ending', 'badly', 'cut', 'pasted', 'scene', 'ending', 'first', 'movie', 'Very', 'odd', 'Randomly', 'TV', 'change', 'particular', 'edition', 'movie', ""'new"", 'footage', 'Jake', 'actually', 'being', 'alive', 'end', 'bad', 'movie', 'mainly', 'taken', 'Jaws', 'series', 'WAY', 'too', 'far', 'IT', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'Jaws', '2', 'Even', 'Jaws', '2', 'was', 'slightly', 'overkill', 'Let', 'good', 'name', 'rest', 'want', 'mindless', 'action', 'movie', 'poor', 'plot', 'then', 'go', 'Personally', 'recommend', 'same', 'thing', 'i', 'did', 'Jaws', '3', 'are', 'lounging', 'bed', 'feeling', 'lazy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'happen', 'movie', 'TBS', 'TNT', 'said', 'least', 'once', 'month', 'so', 'means', 'watch', 'Rent', 'must', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'once', 'probably', 'not', 'watch', 'again']",Jaws 4:Revenge VHS

Note how the title text resembles a cheap television documentary about dangerous insects, and note how the image of the shark has been very badly composited with Photoshop into the picture, to make it look larger and more ferocious than it does in the film. As for the film itself, it's dismal. Not much of substance happens - the shark appears at the beginning (although it's too dark to see), and at the end, but the middle of the film is essentially a lengthy soap opera with lots of false scares that aren't scary. The climax, incorporating footage from the original 'Jaws' (something that will make you gag - 'Jaws' was and is a classic film, whereas this is dreck), is confusing and unexciting - Michael Caine repeatedly presses a button on a radio transmitter, and that's it. It gets a little kudos for being a proper sequel to the first couple of Jaws films - 'Jaws 3D' was, apart from having a shark in it, unrelated - but it's neither bad enough to be funny or interesting enough to watch.

There's not much to say on this movie except that it's a disgrace to all Jaws stands for. (Or is that swims for?)For one thing the plot is ludicrous. The idea that a shark is after the Brody family to right all the wrongs they have done against its own kind is too far fetched to work. Sure, it was hinted at in the second part and also the third (which this movie pretends never took place) but up in our face like this is too funny. Lorraine Gary as the returning mother even goes as far as to say that the shark caused her husbands death (he died of a heart attack, which she claims the stress from the sharks caused). While that may or may not be true, the way she says it is comical. She was never the main star before but she is here. Who knew she would survive so long in the series?

I don't know if they thought it was too cheesy to include here but it would have at least attempted a half assed explanation.The movie opens well, believe it or not. We jump from the POV of little kids singing Christmas Carols to a gruesome, vicious all-out attack on the youngest Brody Brother Sean. The shark dives into the boat, rips off an arm, you name it. Blood all over the place, effective screaming, a horrible way to die. There is another incredible death on some sort of weird boat-float thing where a bunch of swimmers are sitting on it and the shark, in open view, grabs one of the girls. It's a graphic scene (although not as graphic as Quints demise in part one or the first death in this stinker) but the excitement ends here as this sequel goes into committing the same maladies as the third one: boredom.Simply put, I grew drowsy.  Especially when Hoagie (Michael Caine) is introduced -- the man isn't my favorite actor to begin with but him and Ellen courting and the whole Bahamas vacation caused more than five yawns, and that's way too many to be induced by a movie of any kind. Besides the two above deaths, all other killings or attempted ones are stupid, unrealistic, and distasteful.The acting and general setup of the characters made me wish the supernaturally smart shark would kill them all. The surviving characters...couldn't have happened. Can you say unrealistic?I can't help but wonder why the family just won't leave the islands (or else stop working in the water!) You would think they would have developed some giant phobia of it. Will they ever learn? Do we even care if they end up as merely human mince meat?As for the shark itself...it's large and it's rubbery but not as bad (by far) as part three. But while the second shark in part 2 may have growled, this one actually roars -- I kid you not! A giant battle cry roar when going after Ellen Brody. So now every surviving shark is going to try and take a piece out of this family that doesn't have enough sense to stay out of the ocean?One part that was hysterical (but wasn't meant to be) was when Jaws the IV leapt up and grabbed the Jamaican guy off the boat rail. The cameras enhanced everything by causing all to go quiet and flashing in slow motion from everyone's reactions. Didn't work by far and definitely didn't result in any fright. There's no fear here but the heart does do a nice beat at the beginning; such a shame as it all started so well and flopped over so fast! During the ending showdown they *attempt* suspense with a good score and overacting but it just instills more hatred of this now gutted and left-out-to-rot series.This one was obviously slapped together very quickly in order to cash in on the cash shark. If this movie actually took TIME to work out, God help us all.",1,"Melodramatic and dull, but cool beginning",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,3838,"['subtitle', 'movie', 'Revenge', 'only', 'revenge', 'see', 'taking', 'place', 'viewers', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'movie', 'disgrace', 'Jaws', 'stands', 'swims', 'one', 'thing', 'plot', 'ludicrous', 'idea', 'shark', 'Brody', 'family', 'right', 'wrongs', 'have', 'done', 'own', 'kind', 'too', 'far', 'fetched', 'work', 'Sure', 'was', 'hinted', 'second', 'part', 'also', 'third', 'movie', 'never', 'took', 'place', 'up', 'face', 'too', 'funny', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'returning', 'mother', 'even', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'shark', 'caused', 'husbands', 'death', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', 'stress', 'sharks', 'caused', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'way', 'comical', 'was', 'never', 'main', 'star', 'here', 'Who', 'knew', 'would', 'survive', 'so', 'long', 'series', 'book', 'Jaws', 'Revenge', 'explained', 'was', 'voodoo', 'curse', 'put', 'Brody', 'family', 'what', 'feared', 'most', 'Great', 'White', 'Shark', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'cheesy', 'include', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'attempted', 'half', 'assed', 'explanation.The', 'movie', 'well', 'believe', 'not', 'jump', 'POV', 'little', 'kids', 'singing', 'Christmas', 'Carols', 'gruesome', 'vicious', 'all-out', 'attack', 'youngest', 'Brody', 'Brother', 'Sean', 'shark', 'boat', 'arm', 'name', 'Blood', 'place', 'effective', 'screaming', 'horrible', 'way', 'die', 'incredible', 'death', 'sort', 'weird', 'boat-float', 'thing', 'where', 'bunch', 'swimmers', 'are', 'sitting', 'shark', 'open', 'view', 'grabs', 'one', 'girls', 'graphic', 'scene', 'not', 'as', 'graphic', 'Quints', 'demise', 'part', 'one', 'first', 'death', 'stinker', 'excitement', 'here', 'sequel', 'committing', 'same', 'maladies', 'third', 'one', 'boredom.Simply', 'put', 'grew', 'drowsy', 'Especially', 'when', 'Hoagie', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'introduced', 'man', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'actor', 'begin', 'Ellen', 'courting', 'whole', 'Bahamas', 'vacation', 'caused', 'more', 'five', 'yawns', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'be', 'induced', 'movie', 'kind', 'two', 'deaths', 'other', 'killings', 'attempted', 'ones', 'are', 'stupid', 'unrealistic', 'distasteful.The', 'acting', 'general', 'setup', 'characters', 'made', 'wish', 'supernaturally', 'smart', 'shark', 'would', 'kill', 'surviving', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'happened', 'Can', 'say', 'unrealistic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'family', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'islands', 'else', 'stop', 'working', 'water', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'giant', 'phobia', 'ever', 'learn', 'Do', 'even', 'care', 'end', 'up', 'as', 'merely', 'human', 'mince', 'meat', 'shark', 'large', 'rubbery', 'not', 'bad', 'far', 'part', 'three', 'second', 'shark', 'part', '2', 'may', 'have', 'growled', 'one', 'actually', 'kid', 'not', 'giant', 'battle', 'cry', 'roar', 'when', 'going', 'Ellen', 'Brody', 'So', 'now', 'surviving', 'shark', 'going', 'try', 'take', 'piece', 'family', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'sense', 'stay', 'ocean', 'One', 'part', 'was', 'hysterical', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'was', 'when', 'Jaws', 'IV', 'leapt', 'up', 'grabbed', 'Jamaican', 'guy', 'boat', 'rail', 'cameras', 'enhanced', 'everything', 'causing', 'go', 'quiet', 'flashing', 'slow', 'motion', 'everyone', 'reactions', 'Did', ""n't"", 'work', 'far', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'result', 'fright', 'fear', 'here', 'heart', 'do', 'nice', 'beat', 'beginning', 'shame', 'started', 'so', 'well', 'flopped', 'fast', 'ending', 'showdown', '*attempt*', 'suspense', 'good', 'score', 'overacting', 'just', 'more', 'hatred', 'now', 'gutted', 'left-out-to-rot', 'series.This', 'one', 'was', 'obviously', 'slapped', 'together', 'very', 'quickly', 'order', 'cash', 'cash', 'shark', 'movie', 'actually', 'took', 'TIME', 'work', 'out', 'God']",Jaws 4:Revenge VHS

The 3rd film was terrible, as it went away from the sea and brought the killer shark into Sea world. THIS film, is the real sequel which concludes to the second and first, but it still isn't great. Lorraine Gary reprises her role as Ellen Brody, also Michael Brody (the kid from 1 and 2) comes back, along with his brother Sean (you might remeber Sean as being a cute little boy in the first film), well if you liked him in the first one you will be dissapointed 'cause he hardly lasts ten minutes in this one, although it is quite a thrilling scene. What was stupid about this film was that the rest of the family go to the bahamas 'cause Michael has a job there, but for some reason, the shark can somehow know where they're going and follows them there. I'm no expert on sharks, but I know they can't swim in warm water. Also, how can a shark have feelings. It heads there so he can kill the whole family. What I liked about this film was Michael Caine's performance, he shone some light into the movie. I didn't like the look of the shark (they usually look bad in all of the films, but this one looked horrible). I liked the cast, they seemed like they enjoyed doing this film, that little girl's quite cute too. What I hated was Ellen's flashbacks, she has flashbacks in this about Sean being eaten by the shark and Roy Schieder killing the shark from the first film... but how can you have a flashback of something when you didn't even see it? I liked a couple of shark scenes, I thought the chase in the sunken ship was quite tense. I didn't like the ending though. Like from the third film, the shark roars. Why? And it dies by getting the mast of the boat stabbed through it's body.

479934,A3RWY91SBR2ACY,6305814694,Ronin,"[2, 2]","Remember Jaws 3D when both of the Brody brothers were working together to build Sea World in Florida?  The oldest Brody boy was a welder and married to a blond marine biologist.  The Brody boy knew a lot about welding but not much about fish.In this film, both Brody boys are back, except that they are played by different actors, have different occupations, and different personalities for instance, the main Brody boy no longer welds, but is now a marine biologist, that's OK though, because his wife is now a welder.Their mother is the same actor from the first two films, and the photo of their dad looks the same, he's not actually in the film as he apparently was scared to death of great white sharks sometime after the second film.  I'm not joking about that.  That's how they explain Roy Scheider's absence.  He had a heart attack because he was scarred of sharks.  Really.Really this is a story of a feud between two families as a member of the Jaws family is upset that the Brody's keep killing his or her relatives and plots revenge against the family.  First he or she kills Sheriff Brody's youngest son who is no longer a theme-park-building-cowboy but a New England cop like his dad, then swims super-fast to get to the Bahamas around the same time Mrs. Brody and her family get there.  Keep in mind that Brody's don't swim from New England to the Bahamas but instead take a plane.  That is one fast shark.  Maybe I'm being too sarcastic.  Perhaps it's a different shark than the one in Amity Island.  Maybe the one in the Bahamas is a member of a Miami shark cartel and was paid by the shark in New England.Oh, and why did Mrs. Brody leave her home in Maine?  Because it was on a body of land surrounded by water; in other words, an island, and she was getting kind of freaked out by sharks.  So she wisely moves to South Dakota where there are no sharks.  No, just kidding, she moves to The Bahamas, which isn't just one island, it's like seven-hundred islands.  See, much better.The shark in this film looks a little long in the tooth.  Some of the shots of it feature a broken dorsal fin that's barely connected; it just kind of flops back and forth.  Maybe it's the same model from the previous films.  If so, maybe this belies some deeper subplot to the franchise.  Perhaps the previous sharks didn't explode but have been somehow secretly replacing the fine Brody family members they normally serve here with different people.  Maybe that's what was really bothering Sheriff Brody.Later in the film the dorsal fin got better.Anyway, the dialog is a little better than the third film, which was really bad, but the lack of plot required the director to have lots of scenes that go on and on and on but that don't add anything to the story.  It's sort of like the movie is made out of nothing more than deleted scenes.  Also, just as a side point, most of the film takes place in the Bahamas, in the sun, yet nobody wears sunglasses.  Nobody.  Well, there was this one guy, but he wore the flip up kind and always had them in flip up mode.  I found this harder to swallow than many of the other inconsistencies that are a constant feature of this movie.  And why do great white sharks blow up when you shoot them.  And knowing that all you have to do is shoot them, why not shoot them earlier in the film?On a positive note, it's one of the best looking Jaws films in that the print looks mostly good and is bright and colorful; everything looks as if it was filmed last year.  Also, Michael Cain is in it.

I was a big fan of sharks and luckily, my parents were cool enough to let me watch the original Jaws and sequels at such a young age. The first two movies in the series were wonderful. Maybe it was the 70's atmosphere, and the fact that no film maker had ever really covered the ""killer shark"" view on the big screen-but, the first two movies were scary! The third movie tried to hit it big by going 3-D which just makes the film's overall appearance look grainy and blurry. Jaws 3-D was actually even worse than the mess they created with this movie. The only slightly good thing about the movie is the character developement. We are comfortable as movie viewers watching the Brody family, who have endured numerous shark attack scenarios, and aside from Elaine Gray's lopsided hairdoo, we enjoy seeing what's left of the Brody family interact. The mechanical shark in this movie is so bad that it is actually unexplainable. It literally moves so slow that anyone who knows how to at least swim laps could outswim it in the water. There are only two scenes in this movie that are slightly scary-but the slow, OVERLY exposed shark pretty much ruins it for the moviegoer. My biggest issue with this movie though is that I am confused about why the Brody family even goes around water at all anymore?!? Mike Brody works in the water constantly-which is odd since he has been in ALL of the movies and has been attacked on numerous occasions. Why not just find a career away from the sea? I live in Ohio and have only been to the ocean a couple times but, I know that If i DID live by the ocean, and a vengeful shark seemed to want to ruin my life, I would simply MOVE. The shark can't come up on land, so it's not that big of a deal. It's so sad that they have let this series go downhill so bad. If they ever do make a sequel they should really do a LOT of research and come up a halfway decent plot that doesnt involve a shark that is seeking out revenge. One more sad fact about this movie is that the young girl who played Thea (and also provided the voice of DUCKY in THE LAND BEFORE TIME)-Mike Brody's daughter-was tragically murdered by her father shortly after this movie was made.",1,Painfully bad...,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,2252,"['remember', 'first', 'seeing', 'Jaws-The', 'Revenge', 'when', 'was', 'around', '[', ']', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'sharks', 'luckily', 'parents', 'were', 'cool', 'enough', 'let', 'watch', 'original', 'Jaws', 'sequels', 'young', 'age', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'series', 'were', 'wonderful', 'Maybe', 'was', '70', 'atmosphere', 'fact', 'film', 'maker', 'had', 'ever', 'really', 'covered', 'killer', 'shark', 'view', 'big', 'screen-but', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'scary', 'third', 'movie', 'tried', 'hit', 'big', 'going', '3-D', 'just', 'film', 'overall', 'appearance', 'look', 'grainy', 'blurry', 'Jaws', '3-D', 'was', 'actually', 'even', 'worse', 'mess', 'created', 'movie', 'only', 'slightly', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'character', 'developement', 'are', 'comfortable', 'movie', 'viewers', 'watching', 'Brody', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'endured', 'numerous', 'shark', 'attack', 'scenarios', 'aside', 'Elaine', 'Gray', 'lopsided', 'hairdoo', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'what', 'left', 'Brody', 'family', 'interact', 'mechanical', 'shark', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'unexplainable', 'literally', 'so', 'slow', 'anyone', 'who', 'how', 'least', 'swim', 'laps', 'could', 'outswim', 'water', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'slightly', 'scary-but', 'slow', 'OVERLY', 'exposed', 'shark', 'pretty', 'much', 'moviegoer', 'biggest', 'issue', 'movie', 'though', 'am', 'confused', 'why', 'Brody', 'family', 'even', 'water', 'anymore', 'Brody', 'water', 'constantly-which', 'odd', 'been', 'ALL', 'movies', 'been', 'attacked', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'find', 'career', 'away', 'sea', 'live', 'Ohio', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'ocean', 'couple', 'times', 'know', 'i', 'DID', 'live', 'ocean', 'vengeful', 'shark', 'seemed', 'want', 'ruin', 'life', 'would', 'simply', 'MOVE', 'shark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'land', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'so', 'sad', 'have', 'let', 'series', 'go', 'downhill', 'so', 'bad', 'ever', 'do', 'make', 'sequel', 'should', 'really', 'do', 'LOT', 'research', 'come', 'up', 'halfway', 'decent', 'plot', 'involve', 'shark', 'seeking', 'out', 'revenge', 'One', 'more', 'sad', 'fact', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Thea', 'also', 'provided', 'voice', 'DUCKY', 'THE', 'LAND', 'BEFORE', 'TIME', 'Brody', 'daughter-was', 'tragically', 'murdered', 'father', 'shortly', 'movie', 'was', 'made']",Jaws 4:Revenge VHS

Back when the original Jaws came out in the late 70's it scared the hell out of most people, myself included. Then came Jaws 2. An above average sequel that at least didn't insult us too much. Then came Jaws 3-D. The acting was at least good in the film but the movie itself was a little hard to swallow. This movie makes Jaws 3 look like a Kurosawa film.The plot is about the wife of Martin Brody played by Lorrane Gray, going to the Carribian after her son is killed by a shark, man this group can't get a break from great whites. She vists her other son the oldest played by Lance Guest. While down there another shark shows up, were supposed to asume its the same one and now it's out for revenge on the family.One of the biggest surprises in the film is that Michal Caine is in it. I always thought that he must have lost a bet to be in the film. The plot is just so foolish I really have to wonder if the person writing the script was out of JR High.

One can only hope that they simply had too much faith in the director and honestly believed that he would make a good movie. And even then, the script would have sent most serious actors on the run.First of all the plot is unbelieveably poorly conceived. Even if you accept the concept of a shark having a vendetta against a particular family, the story is so full of holes and illogical twists that you end up sitting in front of the sceen in utter disbelief: Ellen Brody has flasbacks to incidents where she wasn't present?! The pilot Hoagy actually chrashes his plain into the ocean to rescue Ellen (this is laugh-out-loud-funny if you actually consider how ridicules it is), and subsequently survives being trapped inside the plane while the shark is attacking him, then swims to the boat in prestine condition?!Jake somehow survives being dragged into the ocean, lodged between the shark's teeth, with massive bite wounds and blood loss?! What?...it just let him go? Oh, I forget, the REAL target is still Ellen Brody, who feels she has to sacrifice herself in order to stop the killings. The shark then tries to kill her by leaping unto the boat (much as in the original JAWS) but not until it has managed to stand still in the water raised on its tail long enough for Ellen to ram into it, with so much speed that it actually BLOWS up.Need I say more? But it doesn't end here. The plot is completely horrendous. Then the least you could hope for is that the action scenes were somewhat well executed. But no, not even that is the director able to pull off. First of all the shark looks entirely fake, making it impossible to have proper footage of it, rendering many of the scenes ineffective. On top of that the scenes are so poorly constructed that no suspense or real ""action"" is gained from them. The camera angles are flat and unfocused, the editing is illogical and robs the sequences of any natural narrative flow.In the end you have to be a really, really, REALLY big JAWS fan to enjoy this film, and even then I find it hard to justify actually liking it. The original was a masterpiece of action and suspense, the second one was pretty good, the third was a bit embarassing - but this last chapter (so far) of the JAWS saga is so bad I think most people just want to forget it ever happened.",1,"Horrible, horrible movie!",1033689600,"10 4, 2002",2002,2588,"['Jaws', 'Revenge', 'just', 'plain', 'simple', 'bad', 'movie.Lorrain', 'Gary', 'Michael', 'Cain', 'are', 'actors', 'respect', 'admire', 'work', 'other', 'films', 'why', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'logical', 'reason', 'why', 'one', 'would', 'participate', 'mess', 'sequel', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'simply', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'faith', 'director', 'honestly', 'believed', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'then', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'sent', 'most', 'serious', 'actors', 'run.First', 'plot', 'unbelieveably', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'Even', 'accept', 'concept', 'shark', 'having', 'vendetta', 'particular', 'family', 'story', 'so', 'full', 'holes', 'illogical', 'twists', 'end', 'up', 'sitting', 'front', 'sceen', 'utter', 'disbelief', 'Ellen', 'Brody', 'flasbacks', 'incidents', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'present', 'pilot', 'Hoagy', 'actually', 'plain', 'ocean', 'rescue', 'Ellen', 'laugh-out-loud-funny', 'actually', 'consider', 'how', 'ridicules', 'subsequently', 'being', 'trapped', 'plane', 'shark', 'attacking', 'then', 'boat', 'prestine', 'condition', 'Jake', 'somehow', 'being', 'dragged', 'ocean', 'lodged', 'shark', 'teeth', 'massive', 'bite', 'wounds', 'blood', 'loss', 'What', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'Oh', 'forget', 'REAL', 'target', 'still', 'Ellen', 'Brody', 'who', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'stop', 'killings', 'shark', 'then', 'kill', 'leaping', 'boat', 'much', 'original', 'JAWS', 'not', 'managed', 'stand', 'still', 'water', 'raised', 'tail', 'long', 'enough', 'Ellen', 'ram', 'so', 'much', 'speed', 'actually', 'BLOWS', 'up.Need', 'say', 'more', ""n't"", 'end', 'here', 'plot', 'completely', 'horrendous', 'Then', 'least', 'could', 'hope', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'somewhat', 'well', 'executed', 'not', 'even', 'director', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'First', 'shark', 'entirely', 'fake', 'making', 'impossible', 'have', 'proper', 'footage', 'rendering', 'many', 'scenes', 'ineffective', 'top', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'suspense', 'real', 'action', 'gained', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'flat', 'unfocused', 'editing', 'illogical', 'robs', 'sequences', 'natural', 'narrative', 'flow.In', 'end', 'have', 'be', 'really', 'really', 'REALLY', 'big', 'JAWS', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'film', 'even', 'then', 'find', 'hard', 'justify', 'actually', 'liking', 'original', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'action', 'suspense', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'third', 'was', 'bit', 'embarassing', 'last', 'chapter', 'so', 'far', 'JAWS', 'saga', 'so', 'bad', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'just', 'want', 'forget', 'ever', 'happened']",Jaws 4:Revenge VHS

479948,A1441JD62UV8IR,6305814694,Techy DVD Guy,"[3, 3]","Many people hate on Jaws: The Revenge, which I do understand why. The plot makes NO sense whatsoever and the Shark is the fakest thing I have ever seen...BUT there is more to it then meets the eye! Jaws: The Revenge originally had a lot more scenes and sub-plots which ended up being cut out of the film. Such as, when the shark is stabbed by the boat, it roars and blood is pouring out of it's mouth until is finally starts to sink and the heartbeat of the shark fades away. However, on the DVD version, the shark blows up for no reason! Also, in the original version, Jakes dies, but in the DVD version, Jakes happens to live somehow..don't ask how, I'm not a doctor. As you can see, the original version of the film is much better than what Universal gave us on the DVD. All these scenes I have talked about were seen in the US Theatrical Version of Jaws the Revenge released in 1987, however, Universal decided to use the European Theatrical Version for the DVD/VHS/Laserdisc release of the film. The US version has aired on TV in America and Europe. AMC, back in 2004, aired the uncut version of Jaws the Revenge but it had many errors such as scenes being re-arranged. In the UK, BBC-1 aired Jaws the Revenge with the completed uncut ending and the alternate death scene that Jake had. But it did not include other uncut scenes such as Jake and Mike playing guitar on the porch, Ellen talking to Michael about her adverture in Eygpt, Mike showing Neptunes Folly to Ellen, Hoagie talking to Ellen in front of large cruise ships, the extended intro, and a scene where Hoagie and Mike are having an argument. There are a few more uncut scenes but they have not yet surfaced on TV versions, they only exist on the US 35mm print of Jaws the Revenge. As you can see, the ORIGINAL version of Jaws the Revenge was much better than what we got on the Home Video release of it. Why do you think it says ""CONTAINS NEW FOOTAGE NOT SEEN IN US THEATERS"" on the VHS..?

Especially when the whole family MOVES from New York to the Bahamas - and the shark follows them! How did it know they were going? Did it tap their phones? Read their mail?Tellingly, Roy Scheider is nowhere to be seen in this movie, leaving it all up to his boring wife to handle the stalking shark. And Michael Caine pops up too, for pretty much no reason other than to tell us, ""phwoar, that shark's breath stinks.""Oh, and speaking of the shark - he roars like a lion in this movie. Not once, but a handful of times. I didn't know sharks could do that. Then again, I didn't know sharks bore grudges over the deaths of family members from over 10 years ago either. Learn something new every day, eh?Lastly, the director has the shark ""popping"" out of the water so much it starts to wear a little thin. In the first film, when the shark pops out of the water it's a jump out of the seat moment, and clue that indeed Sherrif Brody is ""gonna need a bigger boat"".

For everyone who quibbles about the unlikelihood of finding a Great White in the warm waters of the Bahamas: this shark also roars.  Like a lion or something.  A roaring shark.  You read that right.The filmmakers also keep cutting shots from the original JAWS into the climax.  As a reminder that there was actually a good film at one time here?  A distraction from how horrible this one is?They paid Michael Caine enough to be in this stink bomb--but obviously not enough to wear a wet shirt after climbing out of the ocean.  His expressions often convey that he's there but you're lucky he's at least facing the camera.Was there something better he could have been doing?  Yes.  Picking up his first Oscar for HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.  But he missed the Oscars to be in JAWS: THE REVENGE.  At least he went on national TV to admit that he did this movie because he had a home right there in the Bahamas (he even pointed at the house during the interview).The demise of the roaring shark is a baffling, badly-edited violation of all of our natural laws and logic.  Shark rises out of the water.  Boat rams shark.  Shark explodes.  Boat explodes.  Everyone survives, even the annoying Jamaican who got chewed up several minutes before.

Director Joseph Sargent; however, is not Steven Spielberg and the film certainly shows it.  Sheriff Brody (played brilliantly by Roy Scheider in the original ""Jaws"") has been dead for some years, his sons have grown, and his wife (once again played the comatose, lathargic Lorraine Gary) has tried to move on, but she now fears the water and still has nightmares. Her son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), now a cop at Amity is killed one night in the water, and Ellen decides to visit Michael (Lance Guest), her other son on a Caribbean island. Ellen believes her family is haunted by sharks and wants her son to stop working with them as he now has a family of his own to look after. He will not believe her, but a great white attacks him and his friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles). They escape, but decide to investigate; meanwhile Ellen is falling for local Pilot, Hoagie (Michael Caine). Soon though it becomes clear that the shark is after the family and Ellen decides to find and destroy the shark as she cannot get on with her life and must protect remaining members of her family, and Mike, Jake and Hoagie follow.There are some moderately good performances here, but they hardly are special.  Lorraine Gary and Lance Guest are solid as the Brody family, while Van Peebles is good and provides some banter. Caine looks like he is having fun, it is the Bahamas after all, and he probably was paid well. There are a couple of good moments:  the banana boat scene and the shark following Mike into the sunken ship, yet ""Jaws: The Revenge"" resembles nothing that the original 1975 classic embraced.

479954,AV5G37VFE5NVD,6305814694,Tom Benton,"[7, 9]","Steven Spielberg's classic masterpiece JAWS did not have a stellar plot.  It was a bubblegum storyline: a monstrous shark terrorizes a beach town on the east coast.  In the hands of any other director, it would have been a terrible film, something to laugh at on lonely Saturday nights while chowing down popcorn.  In the hands of Mr. Spielberg, however, it became one of the very finest and most memorable films ever made.Steven Spielberg's hands were nowhere near JAWS: THE REVENGE.Okay, so here's the plot.  Remember JAWS 3-D?  Well, that never happened.  Chief Brody - from the first movie - is dead.  His wife, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), is living a happy life in Amity until her youngest son is killed - by a great white shark.  Ellen flies down to the Bahamas with her other son, Michael Brody (Lance Guest).  Though her family and friends assure her that she is crazy, Ellen believes that the shark from the first movie - yes, the one that Chief Brody killed - is back for revenge, hunting down her family and killing them one-by-one.  Even though it died.  In the first movie.Confused?  Any sensible moviegoer would be.  It's best to completely shut down your brain while watching the third JAWS sequel.  As you now know, the story is completely absurd.  The script, by Michael De Guzman, is unintentionally hilarious, filled with outrageously funny dialogue.  For example, in one scene, pilot Hoagie (played by Michael Caine!) is courting Ellen Brody.HOAGIE: I have an irresistible urge to kiss you, Ellen Brody.ELLEN: Why?HOAGIE: Because ... it would not occur to you why.And if that's not confusing enough for you, feast upon this nugget of dialogue, from a conversation between Michael and Ellen Brody.ELLEN: Why did you come out here?  Why did you come out here?MICHAEL: Mom!  Mom!  WHY did you take the boat?ELLEN: It [the shark] kept coming!MICHAEL: Don't you realize what you're doing?ELLEN: I've tried to tell you, there was nothing else to do!MICHAEL: Mom, you shouldn't have done it.ELLEN: I've tried to tell you, I've tried!Joseph Sargent's directing is terrible; it's clear that the actors have no clue what they are doing.  Which may be why the acting is so horrible.  The highlight of the cast is Lance Guest, whose straight-faced performance overshadows the very talented Michael Caine's by a longshot.  The horrid acting is forgivable, however; after all, how could someone even attempt to keep a straight-face in a film so absurd?  A film in which sharks roar, swim from New England to the Bahamas to kill family members, and leap thirty feet out of the water?On the plus side, JAWS: THE REVENGE is enormously fun to watch, thanks to its ridiculousness and unpurposeful hilarity.  It is very likely one of the worst films ever made - JAWS 3-D looks like the original when compared to this film - but if there's nothing else on TV some late night, grab some popcorn and a frosty beverage and enjoy the absurdity that is JAWS: THE REVENGE.",1,"""I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder ...""",1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,2966,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'classic', 'masterpiece', 'JAWS', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'stellar', 'plot', 'was', 'bubblegum', 'storyline', 'monstrous', 'shark', 'beach', 'town', 'east', 'coast', 'hands', 'other', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'terrible', 'film', 'something', 'laugh', 'lonely', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'chowing', 'down', 'popcorn', 'hands', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'however', 'became', 'one', 'very', 'finest', 'most', 'memorable', 'films', 'ever', 'made.Steven', 'Spielberg', 'hands', 'were', 'nowhere', 'near', 'JAWS', 'REVENGE.Okay', 'so', 'here', 'plot', 'Remember', 'JAWS', '3-D', 'Well', 'never', 'happened', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'first', 'movie', 'dead', 'wife', 'Ellen', 'Brody', 'Lorraine', 'Gary', 'living', 'happy', 'life', 'Amity', 'youngest', 'son', 'killed', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'Ellen', 'down', 'Bahamas', 'other', 'son', 'Michael', 'Brody', 'Lance', 'Guest', 'family', 'friends', 'assure', 'crazy', 'Ellen', 'shark', 'first', 'movie', 'yes', 'one', 'Chief', 'Brody', 'killed', 'back', 'revenge', 'hunting', 'down', 'family', 'killing', 'one-by-one', 'Even', 'died', 'first', 'movie.Confused', 'sensible', 'moviegoer', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'completely', 'shut', 'down', 'brain', 'watching', 'third', 'JAWS', 'sequel', 'now', 'know', 'story', 'completely', 'absurd', 'script', 'Michael', 'De', 'Guzman', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'filled', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'pilot', 'Hoagie', 'played', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'courting', 'Ellen', 'Brody.HOAGIE', 'have', 'irresistible', 'urge', 'kiss', 'Ellen', 'Brody.ELLEN', 'Why', 'HOAGIE', 'would', 'not', 'occur', 'why.And', 'not', 'confusing', 'enough', 'feast', 'nugget', 'dialogue', 'conversation', 'Michael', 'Ellen', 'Brody.ELLEN', 'Why', 'did', 'come', 'here', 'Why', 'did', 'come', 'here', 'MICHAEL', 'Mom', 'Mom', 'WHY', 'did', 'take', 'boat', 'ELLEN', 'shark', ']', 'kept', 'coming', 'MICHAEL', 'Do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'ELLEN', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'tell', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'MICHAEL', 'Mom', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'it.ELLEN', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'Joseph', 'Sargent', 'directing', 'terrible', 'clear', 'actors', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Which', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'acting', 'so', 'horrible', 'highlight', 'cast', 'Lance', 'Guest', 'straight-faced', 'performance', 'very', 'talented', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'longshot', 'horrid', 'acting', 'forgivable', 'however', 'how', 'could', 'someone', 'even', 'attempt', 'keep', 'straight-face', 'film', 'so', 'absurd', 'film', 'sharks', 'roar', 'swim', 'New', 'England', 'Bahamas', 'kill', 'family', 'members', 'leap', 'thirty', 'feet', 'water', 'plus', 'side', 'JAWS', 'REVENGE', 'enormously', 'fun', 'watch', 'thanks', 'ridiculousness', 'unpurposeful', 'hilarity', 'very', 'likely', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'JAWS', '3-D', 'looks', 'original', 'when', 'compared', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'TV', 'late', 'night', 'grab', 'popcorn', 'frosty', 'beverage', 'enjoy', 'absurdity', 'JAWS', 'REVENGE']",Jaws 4:Revenge VHS

I know that it isn't a classic by any means, but the movie really is good.First off the acting.  It wasn't terrible.  Lorraine Gary did a terrific job as the lead.  I felt sympathy for her and she does have some ability.  Lance Guest as Michael was fantastic also.  I am still waiting for him to get his break out role in Hollywood because I think he has potential.  Mario Van Peebles brings some Bahamian humor, and it sheds some light onto the movie.  And Michael Caine maybe isn't at his finest, but he is decent enough.The cinematography is just beautiful.  It just makes me want to go to the Bahamas every time I watch.  The music score is better than the original.  It has a sort of mystical, on the edge feel to it.  It's too bad Michael Small didn't get any recognition for it, and anyone would be hard pressed to find the soundtrack, even though it's one of the finest ever.Joseph Sargent does an okay job directing.  I admit that it isn't anything special, but it's not trash.  A lot of people have problems with the special effects and some of the things the shark does.  Yes, the shark looks fake.  That's a given when the film has such a low budget and the studio behind the picture isn't totally committed.  There is one scene in particular that many have a problem with and that is when the shark is doing a so called stand on the water.  It's obvious to me that the scene is in slow motion, and the shark is leaping from the water, which makes it appear to be standing on its fin.  There are many aspects of the film also that are very authentic.  An example is when the shark is attacking the boat and it's eyes roll back in its head, which is what a real great white would do.The ending is terrible and totally brings down the film.  But once again, I come with my defense.  In Michael De Guzman's original script, the ending was much different and rather exciting.  As I alluded to earlier, budget constraints kept this film from producing an adequate ending.  If you are interested, there are many links on the Net with the original script.Jaws the Revenge is a movie that I guess you have be a really big Jaws fan to enjoy.  I know that it isn't perfect by any means and that it never will be considered to be a good movie by anybody other than the ""Jaws Junkies.""

479961,A15U46ZENEHGTH,6305814694,Wicked_Smaht,"[1, 2]","This is a film about a shark that's contrary to pretty much everything we know about sharks. Jaws starts off in Amity Island (the location of the original film) on some sort of revenge-quest on the Brody family because they keep maiming, killing or otherwise blowing up the significant number of Great White sharks that seem to keep coming into their vicinity. Jaws gobbles up one of Chief Brody's sons (himself now a cop like his pop once was) and there's a lot of close-ups of some renegade piece of driftwood. We get the sense that Jaws somehow managed to use this piece of driftwood to lure Brody's kid a little closer to the water so he could snatch him and eat him up. This is ridiculous right from the get-go, but here it is in about the first ten minutes of the film. Sharks do not take things personally and they don't seek vengeance, but this is only one of the many facts about sharks that the filmmakers will ignore as we progress through this film.Mrs. Brody (Lorraine Gary) gets very boo-hoo about this attack and decides to visit her other son who lives down in the Bahamas. Somehow, Jaws knows of this and follows her down to the Bahamas. Again, the likelihood of finding a Great White shark in the warm waters of the Bahamas is crazy unlikely, but as we've already seen, the filmmakers don't care much for things such as science or fact. So, Mrs. B tools around the islands and manages to hook up with Michael Caine, who's named after a sandwich for this movie (maybe not, but his name's Hoagie and all I can think of is the hoagie sandwich whenever he's on screen). In defiance of the otherwise talented cast on screen, Jaws manages to out-act them both when he shows just how cunning and crafty he is. See, Mrs. B's other son hasn't suffered enough trauma from being in the water, so he hangs out with Mario van Peebles (as Rasta, Mon!) and does science-y stuff in the ocean that has something or other to do with ocean life. Like I've said, the filmmakers don't care much for science or fact so what Mrs. B's kid and Mario van Rasta are doing in the ocean doesn't much matter. Anyways, Jaws does fun stuff like stop swimming to hide behind some coral or seaweed - only to jump out like some wacky aquatic ninja and eat up some more hopeless victims. Well, the filmmakers have completely thrown fact to the wind on this one because if a Great White stops swimming for even a minute, they die. They will essentially suffocate themself and drown. However, Jaws seems pretty able to manage sitting in idle while waiting for his prey to come directly to him.Once Mrs. B realizes that Jaws has come to the Bahamas to get her and the rest of her family, she begins to lose her s--t royally. She takes off on her own revenge-quest against Jaws and they're supposedly destined to duke it out somewhere on the high seas. However, Jaws seems pretty easy to find since he's also gained the ability to roar... or growl... or whatever the heck sound he's making. Yep, you guessed it - once again, the filmmakers have thrown all logic and reason to the wind and have now made a Great White sound like a lion (in fact, this reminds me of the Simpsons episode where Captain Lance Murdoch had to jump over a water tank filled with piranhas, sharks, electric eels and a lion). Anyways, Mrs. B drives her boat out into the ocean to have a final showdown with Jaws. Hoagie shows up again and crashes his plane into the water and swims to the boat. Like many other reviewers have noted, even though Hoagie just came from the very wet ocean, none of his clothes appears to be the least bit damp. Why this has garnered such attention is beyond me. I mean, honestly, at this point in the film you've been asked to accept a roaring, revenge-minded shark that pounces on its prey from out of nowhere - why quibble about Hoagie's clothes?Now Mrs. B and friends are ready to go mano-e-mano with the Great White and we're led to believe that Mario van Rasta buys the farm halfway through this nightmare at sea. After some more nonsense regarding things that sharks don't do, the climax builds up to the point where Jaws leaps a good 15-20 feet out of the water (apparently, he has also acquired the abilities of a dolphin. Maybe Jaws is a mystical shark that takes on the properties of whatever it eats for its own personal gain). Mrs. B and friends run the ship's prow directly into the beast and stabs it. That's right, she stabbed Jaws... with a boat... Cut to a growling, anguished Jaws as he flops about after being skewered like a Great White shish-ka-bob. He dies an embarassing death and everybody relaxes now that the nightmare is... finally... over...Also, Mario van Rasta shows up after the shark is killed with a friendly ""Hey, mon!"" and everyone's all ha-ha as the credits roll.This is the film in a nutshell and the installment that the Jaws series chose to end on (or maybe not chose, I'm sure the studio would've kept churning these things out if the audience hadn't breathed a collective ""give me a break"" sigh). Why Michael Caine is in this makes even less sense than a growling, stalker-esque Great White shark. I guess he was just slumming and figured a free trip to the Bahamas and a paycheck on top of it was a great way to finish out an Academy Award-winning year (he had won an Oscar whilst he was in the middle of filming Jaws 4). In the meantime, the filmmakers were able to top the sheer silliness of the previous entry (the one where Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, Jr. deal with sharky shenanigans at a Sea World-esque theme park... in 3D, no less!) whilst also soiling everyone's collective memory of Spielberg's original classic film.In short, this is obviously a terrible film, but it does fall into the so-bad-it's-fun category and is even better to view when capping off another week of Shark Week on TV. With all the things you learn about sharks during Shark Week, watch this film and see just how many the filmmakers got wrong. All in all, go into this expecting exactly what you'd expect from the third sequel in a franchise and you won't be disappointed because ""Jaws 4"" delivers the silly in spades! However, if you're looking for a film that's along the same lines as Spielberg's original, well then... just go watch the first one again.Thanks for reading and stay safe out on those high seas, mon!",2,This Time...
