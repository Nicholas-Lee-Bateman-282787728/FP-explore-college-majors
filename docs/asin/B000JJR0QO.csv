Heffernan ""Innerspace Karmanaut""","[9, 13]","Philip Gardiner is obviously an intelligent man with loads of knowledge on esoterics, cults and religions of the world.  Why he would produce such an annoying amateur production is as much of a mystery to me as these serpent cults.  He presents tons of similiarities between religious icons from Osiris to Krishna to Christ and Zoroaster.  Those similiarities are obvious to any thinking person and sophmoric as a foundation for this video.  Snakes are prehistoric animals which exist on almost every continent.  Of course there are snake and dragon myths in many cultures.  I'm tired of all this thin conjecture and emphasis on anthropamorphism.  What's with the idiotic soundtrack which goes from heavy metal to choir practice without rhyme or reason.  The sound quality is sub par, the visuals are pathetic.

But, the video editing makes me seasick, and ultimately, I had to turn it off.  Nearly every scene consists of two or more images that are superimposed, and swirling or moving in opposite directions.  All the other video effects are over-used, too; like someone who went crazy with Adobe Photoshop.  Too bad; I think that the author may have had some good content, but if he ever makes another video, he needs to get a competent and qualified editor to do the post-production work.",1,Video editing makes me seasick,1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,563,"['was', 'really', 'eager', 'see', 'video', 'very', 'interested', 'subject', 'matter', 'video', 'editing', 'seasick', 'ultimately', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'Nearly', 'scene', 'two', 'more', 'images', 'are', 'superimposed', 'swirling', 'moving', 'opposite', 'directions', 'other', 'video', 'effects', 'are', 'over-used', 'too', 'someone', 'who', 'went', 'crazy', 'Adobe', 'Photoshop', 'Too', 'bad', 'think', 'author', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'content', 'ever', 'video', 'get', 'competent', 'qualified', 'editor', 'do', 'post-production', 'work']",Secrets of the Serpent: In Search of the Sacred Past
