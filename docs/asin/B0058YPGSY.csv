It is obvious that they want to build to a big end.  This episode does everything but stand on its head to set up the final episode.

Of course, mayhem will break loose in the finale.  Just like an episode of Columbo or Murder, She wrote, the formula will take us where the writers and producers want us, no matter how transparent it may be.There have been some fairly decent episodes this year, and there are actors from Deadwood, a truly great series here, as well as Danny Trejo, ""Tortuga"" from Breaking Bad and other choice roles, down-playing his skills, but stil interesting.

Don't freak out.On its own, this season of SOA would probably get a 4-star rating: the first few episodes were hard to get into and the entire subplot about Juice being afraid of being ""outed"" as an African-American simply didn't ring true: the Sons spent their first two seasons combating the local white supremacist gang, and had expressed a dislike of their ideology. Now, suddenly, they're all racist themselves and Juice is so flipped out about it that he's willing to rat them out to the Feds? Sorry -- I don't buy it. It was way too forced and didn't serve that great a dramatic purpose. Meanwhile, Jax is still wringing his hands about what to do with his life and is still spinning around in the same should-I-stay-or-should-I-go? circles he's been running in for the entire show.  I know this is meant to be a Hamlet parallel, but it's starting to wear thin.  Also, the new Top Cop character was a little too ""quirky"" for my tastes. Still, by the time the second half of the season rolled around, we were transfixed, and wanted to see what was going to happen next. The last couple of episodes were sharp enough to make us eager to see what happens next.The reason I'm giving the show a 1-star rating, though, is as a protest vote against Amazon's new monopolistic sales policies, in which they are colluding with HBO, Fox and other companies to forbid Amazon customers from reselling their DVDs on Amazon: you can buy ""Sons Of Anarchy"" on Amazon, but if you try to sell it used, suddenly it's a ""restricted item"" and they won't let you. What's worse is they will allow *some* Amazon-affiliated sellers to provide it used, but not regular folks like you and me. The idea is, apparently, to crack down on bootlegs as well as artificially boost the used prices and, I would imagine, to push more customers towards Amazon's vastly inferior download and streaming video services, so that the video companies don't ""lose"" more money through re-sales. Well, since I bought this show brand new, directly from Amazon, I don't think it's a bootleg, and I think that I should be able to resell it there as well, as I've always been able to before. Now, if Amazon wanted to stop ALL used sales on their site altogether, that would be one thing, but playing favorites with ""pre-approved"" sellers seems pretty unfair and smells a bit like monopoly practices to me. Just one more reason to migrate away from Amazon's sphere of influence, I guess. I really don't like the high-handed way Amazon is treating its customers these days.

1445740,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B0058YPGSY,D. C. Obraztsov,"[2, 2]","Motorcycle gangs.  Shoot outs.  Tough guys.  Rock 'n roll.  This is a MAN'S show, correct?  No soapy stuff here.  Not correct.  This is through and through a SOAP OPERA, disguised with the leather jackets and tough guys.  Don't get me wrong - this is an excellent show.  It is definitely captivating, the acting is great, and it is NON-STOP drama and action.  As far as one of the best shows EVER?  I think some people are getting ahead of themselves.The thing that really separates the epitome of excellent television (The Wire, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad) from very good television (Sons of Anarchy, for example), is the fact that in the first types of shows, people don't really change.  This mimics real life, where people generally remain relatively the same over long periods of time once they reach a certain age.  Of course people can do complete 180s in their lives and change, but at the core....people generally remain the same.  EXCELLENT television is generally a little slow moving in character development, since in real life people don't change from day to day.  These shows don't rely on cheap thrills and love triangles and constant jaw-dropping character changes and motives.  They have to rely on...wait for this....great writing.Enter Sons of Anarchy.  It is one of the biggest rollercoaster emotional ride experience on television, with people and their motives CONSTANTLY changing and evolving from episode to episode.  People get kidnapped, everyone is a liar and a backstabber, and one minute something is a crucial element to the plot, and the next it's dropped/forgiven/forgotten.  The writers are masters at creating drama and non-stop action, but as far as realistic portrayals of human beings (something that the show is trying to achieve - make us empathize with these characters), this gets a 4/10.  They are the show that relies on cheap thrills and twists to make a show.  Does it make it bad?  Not necessarily.  Not every show is made to be in the ranks of shows like The Sopranos.  Kurt Sutter has commented that all of the excess, ridiculous, over-the-top drama is purposeful and for good television.  This is quite probable, but is it an excuse or the truth?  With the way some of the characters act (Gemma in particular), I believe that the show is trying to make me feel like this show is more than just constant drama and twists, but something more deep and meaningful.  And I'm not feeling it.The acting is really great, there is no denying that.  I'm still not convinced that I buy Ron Perlman (Clay) as tough biker, but I've come to deal with it.  This is a very Clay-focused season.  Katey Sagal as Gemma is wonderful as always, and is absolutely superb with the material she is given.  My only problem with her character is that sometimes the writers push the ""matriarch"" card a little too hard.  Ever see the end of Mystic River, where the wife gives Sean Penn that ""king"" speech?  Every time Gemma talks it sort of reminds me of that, and it's a little annoying after 4 seasons.  Also, Maggie Siff as Tara Knowles continues to bore the hell out of me, and it's been obvious since season 1 that they are setting her up to become the new ""matriarch"" of the club.  Predictable/cliche, much?I also still can't forgive the sudden drop of Wendy (Drea de Mateo) in season 2.  In season 1 she is living with Jax and there is a major storyline between Gemma/Tara/Wendy, and in the next season Wendy completely dropped off the face of the earth along with the storyline, and then she returns this season.....?  Disjointed storylines like this are never signs of excellent television.  Her character was inconvenient for the growth of Tara/Jax, so they just dropped her.  Lazy writing.Charlie Hunnam is an amazing actor (can you believe he is a British stage actor?) and totally convincing for his role.  Everyone else is very good - I love Kim Coates, Mark Boone Junior, Theo Rossi, Tommy Flanagan, and probably my favorite - Dayton Callie as Wayne Unser.  He was terrific in Deadwood, and equally great in this show.  The show still has a total obsession with using Deadwood characters - over 13 to date, but that's a great thing and they make a great addition to the show.  This season we're joined by Ray McKinnon, another Deadwood actor (the Reverend!) as Assistant U.S. Attorney, Lincoln Potter, and as usual, this guy is just amazingly weird and a terrific addition to the cast.SoA is not lacking in drama or great acting, but I think a more slow-paced show (somewhat like the first season) would do it justice and make it a little less silly and a little more gritty.  I definitely recommend this show to anyone though that is interested in a high-action, intense, dramatic show with lots of twists, turns, extremely sappy moments and great acting performances.  Even with the all of the criticism I gave it, it's still easily in the top 10 best dramas currently on television, hence the high rating.  I'm definitely not going to stop watching.",4,An action-packed soap opera,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,4989,"['Motorcycle', 'gangs', 'Shoot', 'Tough', 'guys', 'Rock', 'n', 'roll', 'MAN', 'show',

Season 4 starts with the Sons getting out of jail after 14 months and heading home. A new sheriff in town stops them and tells them they can't wear their colors or they will be in violation of their parole. Things have changed a lot in the last 14 months, new sheriff, a new suburban development is going full bore into construction and a new US Attorney is in Charming under cover to get rid of SAMCRO by building a RICO case.The Sons set a trap and kill the Russian mob members at a wedding and then set up a meeting with a drug cartel to sell them heavy weapons. In a joint deal Clay agrees to smuggle drugs for the cartel and club is divided over being drug mules which is something they never wanted to get involved in. The money is good but the risks are high and the penalties and dangers are something some gang members do not want to deal with.Season 4 in my opinion is one of the best of the series and Clay's out of control actions put everyone at risk. Clay will do everything to remain at the top of SAMCRO including murder and lying, things that he is used to doing. This season has a lot of action and is gory as murders and violence increase as the plot unwinds. Clay's actions are over the top and Jax decides that he must do something to rein him under control.If you like Sons of Anarchy you will love this DVD set of Season 4.

The resulting suspense produces very dramatic scenes.

The whole cast makes for an excellent ensemble. It should be difficult to care these violent criminals, yet this series makes the audience feel for them.

My old man rides with a 1 percent club and so much of what the show is about is true life of a biker. The jail lock downs, and the club looking out for you till he is out again, the violence. It is not a way a life for the weak. I really hated the Clay and Gemma violence this 4th season only because they always played off each other so well and you really could beleive their love for each other. The only thing I would love for Kurt to change is to let Opie find some kind of happiness. Every season he gets crapped on from donna dieing then finding out that clay and tig betrayed him, to his new marraige is going down the toilet, and clay kills piney. Enough of Bobby getting locked down every season. That poor guy spends more time locked down then riding with the club. I honestly look fo clay to sorta move into the retired role that piney was in. i love piney though and not sure how next season will go without him. This is not a series you can really start watching from seaso 4 or the beginning of season5. You really have to follow the entire story from the season 1 on to really understand the whole situations going on. I also think we will see the end of Otto this next season. Poor Otto has pretty much gave everything he has and even his life because he is on death row now for getting back on the attack that left him blind, and the attack on jackson while he was in prison. This is an awsome show. and it only get better each season. I think Kurt picked the right people for each role.

As the first several seasons developed, I began feeling like the show was turning into a soap opera dressed in leathers.  The plot lines revolved around who's screwing who, who's back-stabbing who, who's lying to who... but ultimately, that didn't matter, I eagerly awaited each show.I love the fact that the backstory is based on Hamlet.  That Jax is playing the part of Hamlet, Clay is Uncle Claudius, Jenna is Hamlet's mother Gertrude and JT is the ghost of Hamlet's murdered father.  You could even find parallels between Jax's best friend Opie and Hamlet's good friend Horatio.  About the only one that doesn't fit the scheme is Jax's girl Tara.  She's certainly no Ophelia, that is unless the writers intend on having her go mad and commit suicide.  Still, I like the way the writers have based the story on one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies. It lends a story a level of class and sophistication that I wouldn't expect in a show about bikers.Another thing I like about the show is its sense of balance.  It's got everything; action, adventure, romance, intrigue, humor, it really has it all.  One week you're watching the Sons shoot it out with the Mayans, and the next week the show has me in practically in tears as Tig mistakenly kills Opie's wife Donna.Can't say enough about the acting.  There are no slouches in this cast.  Jax, Jenna and Clay are all superb.  I've even learned to appreciate the minor characters like the sheriff Wayne Unser.  He does an excellent job, as do the other supporting players like Bobby Elvis, Juice, Chibs and Opie.
