1691474,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00HQOD0SM,Darren,"[6, 6]","So many rom-coms.  So many bad ones.  Even the &#34;romantic dramas&#34; aren't very good -- just saw &#34;Labor Day&#34; with Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin, the latter playing an escaped convict who also happens to be the Perfect Man, doing small repairs on Winslet's house and baking peach pies.  What a relief, therefore, to find a romantic drama featuring honest-to-god people to root for.  &#34;At Middleton&#34; is a gem amongst the dross.Andy Garcia and Vera Farmiga, married to different people, are taking their respective kids to a tour of fictional Middleton College.  They meet in the parking lot, and it isn't a good start: bow-tied Garcia is preparing to back into a spot, but Farmiga swoops in before he begins the process.  Once they're out of their cars, there's a contretemps, ending with Farmiga going, &#34;So you're one of those people?&#34; (that is, one of those people who annoyingly back into parking spaces.  I'm with Farmiga on this one: if you're too scared to back out of a parking space, you probably shouldn't be driving.  Sorry.)  As they part, muttering about each other to their respective kids as they head to the tour, it's clear that they don't stand a chance: Cupid has struck, and struck hard.  He's overwhelmed by her girlishness, sharp wit, and mature beauty, and she ... well, as a man, I'm always a little uncertain about what motivates women.  I would imagine Garcia's whole rocking-the-Cary-Grant-from-&#34;Bringing Up Baby&#34; thing is irresistible to her.  She wants to squeeze him like a big puppy, I guess.  Basically, they're so thunderstruck by each other that they each find excuses to bail on their kids and the tour in order to hang out with each other all day.  The movie invites you to think about all those people you might take an instant dislike to on first impression for whatever reason -- differences in personal style, mostly -- and wonder if such obvious differences might in truth be perfectly complementary.It also gives you reason to disdain that old canard about each person having one discrete &#34;soulmate&#34;.  This notion is wishful thinking, as this wise, funny, and sad movie demonstrates.  The fact is that we might have several soulmates throughout the journey of our lives, each intimate partner weaving their own fabric, whether a whole quilt or a short swatch, in our biographies.  For these two empty-nesters from different families and different worlds, this moment in time was meant to be their discovery of each other.  A very intelligent review not far below mine points out that they weren't &#34;looking for it&#34; -- these things just happen in life, and each person must evaluate how sturdy the foundation of his or her marriage is when confronted by the enchantment of a new infatuation.  When people talk about how marriage is &#34;work&#34;, this is what they're ultimately talking about.  Those who are judgmental about such matters are, if not thumping a bible or something, probably newly married or single -- young, in either case.  As Farmiga points out, until you find yourself watching the thing that mostly gave purpose to a partnership -- a child -- fly the coop, your opinions on mid-life love affairs between people, married or not, is uninformed.A small point, but worth pointing out: the contrast between the middle-agers' relationship and their children's encounters rings true.  How earnest we are when we're teenagers!  So serious and solemn, so much to prove.  And so much less solemn when we're middle-aged -- so much less to prove.  It certainly makes for easier courting, despite the baggage of (hopefully!) ex-wives/husbands, adult children, time-consuming careers, and all the rest of it.  If only we were thinner, god.  Youth is wasted on the young!While prepping for this review, I read that Garcia and Farmiga got along wonderfully on the set, and it shows.  This movie doesn't work if there's no chemistry.  More to the point, the scene where they &#34;perform&#34; in front of an acting class demonstrates like nothing else a strong and easy working relationship that makes the romance more than just plausible.  I'm not sure this little scene was necessary to the movie, but these fine performers put on an acting clinic, if nothing else.  If there's justice, it will become a minor YouTube classic, to be performed, most fittingly, by drama students.  The movie is also a family affair: Farmiga's sister, Taissa, plays the daughter (21 years difference between them), and Garcia's daughter plays the projectionist running Tati's &#34;Umbrellas of Cherbourg&#34;.  While watching the movie one gets the sense that everyone's on board and having a great time.Highly recommended for all the middletons out there.  Oh, and if you're infatuated with Vera Farmiga, this movie is like crack, seriously.  5 out of 5.",5,Warm and wise -- shockingly good,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,4831,"['So', 'many', 'rom-coms', 'So', 'many', 'bad', 'ones', 'Even', '34', 'romantic', 'dramas', '34', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'just', 'saw', '34', 'Labor', 'Day', '34', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'latter', 'playing', 'escaped', 'convict', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Perfect', 'Man', 'doing', 'small', 'repairs', 'Winslet', 'house', 'baking', 'peach', 'pies', 'What', 'relief', 'therefore', 'find', 'romantic', 'drama', 'featuring', 'honest-to-god', 'people', 'root', '34', 'Middleton', '34', 'gem', 'dross.Andy', 'Garcia', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'married', 'different', 'people', 'are', 'taking', 'respective', 'kids', 'tour', 'fictional', 'Middleton', 'College', 'meet', 'parking', 'lot', ""n't"", 'good', 'start', 'bow-tied', 'Garcia', 'preparing', 'back', 'spot', 'Farmiga', 'swoops', 'process', ""'re"", 'cars', 'contretemps', 'ending', 'Farmiga', 'going', '34', 'So', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', '34', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'annoyingly', 'back', 'parking', 'spaces', ""'m"", 'Farmiga', 'one', ""'re"", 'too', 'scared', 'back', 'parking', 'space', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'driving', 'Sorry', 'part', 'muttering', 'other', 'respective', 'kids', 'head', 'tour', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'Cupid', 'struck', 'struck', 'hard', 'overwhelmed', 'girlishness', 'sharp', 'wit', 'mature', 'beauty', 'well', 'man', ""'m"", 'always', 'little', 'uncertain', 'what', 'women', 'would', 'imagine', 'Garcia', 'whole', 'rocking-the-Cary-Grant-from-', '34', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', '34', 'thing', 'irresistible', 'squeeze', 'big', 'puppy', 'guess', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'so', 'thunderstruck', 'other', 'find', 'bail', 'kids', 'tour', 'order', 'hang', 'out', 'other', 'day', 'movie', 'think', 'people', 'might', 'take', 'instant', 'dislike', 'first', 'impression', 'reason', 'differences', 'personal', 'style', 'mostly', 'wonder', 'such', 'obvious', 'differences', 'might', 'truth', 'be', 'perfectly', 'complementary.It', 'also', 'reason', 'disdain', 'old', 'canard', 'person', 'having', 'one', 'discrete', '34', 'soulmate', '34', 'notion', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'wise', 'funny', 'sad', 'movie', 'fact', 'might', 'have', 'several', 'soulmates', 'journey', 'lives', 'intimate', 'partner', 'weaving', 'own', 'fabric', 'whole', 'quilt', 'short', 'swatch', 'biographies', 'two', 'empty-nesters', 'different', 'families', 'different', 'worlds', 'moment', 'time', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'discovery', 'other', 'very', 'intelligent', 'review', 'not', 'far', 'mine', 'points', 'out', 'were', ""n't"", '34', 'looking', '34', 'things', 'just', 'happen', 'life', 'person', 'must', 'evaluate', 'how', 'sturdy', 'foundation', 'marriage', 'when', 'confronted', 'enchantment', 'new', 'infatuation', 'When', 'people', 'talk', 'how', 'marriage', '34', 'work', '34', 'what', ""'re"", 'ultimately', 'talking', 'who', 'are', 'judgmental', 'such', 'matters', 'are', 'not', 'thumping', 'bible', 'something', 'probably', 'newly', 'married', 'single', 'young', 'case', 'Farmiga', 'out', 'find', 'watching', 'thing', 'mostly', 'gave', 'purpose', 'partnership', 'child', 'fly', 'coop', 'opinions', 'mid-life', 'love', 'affairs', 'people', 'married', 'not', 'uninformed.A', 'small', 'point', 'pointing', 'out', 'contrast', 'middle-agers', 'relationship', 'children', 'encounters', 'rings', 'true', 'How', 'earnest', 'are', 'when', ""'re"", 'teenagers', 'So', 'serious', 'solemn', 'so', 'much', 'prove', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'solemn', 'when', ""'re"", 'middle-aged', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'prove', 'certainly', 'easier', 'courting', 'baggage', 'hopefully', 'ex-wives/husbands', 'adult', 'children', 'time-consuming', 'careers', 'rest', 'only', 'were', 'thinner', 'god', 'Youth', 'wasted', 'young', 'prepping', 'review', 'read', 'Garcia', 'Farmiga', 'got', 'along', 'wonderfully', 'set', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'chemistry', 'More', 'point', 'scene', 'where', '34', 'perform', '34', 'front', 'acting', 'class', 'nothing', 'else', 'strong', 'easy', 'working', 'relationship', 'romance', 'more', 'just', 'plausible', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'little', 'scene', 'was', 'necessary', 'movie', 'fine', 'performers', 'put', 'acting', 'clinic', 'nothing', 'else', 'justice', 'will', 'become', 'minor', 'YouTube', 'classic', 'be', 'performed', 'most', 'fittingly', 'drama', 'students', 'movie', 'also', 'family', 'affair', 'Farmiga', 'sister', 'Taissa', 'daughter', '21', 'years', 'difference', 'Garcia', 'daughter', 'projectionist', 'running', 'Tati', '34', 'Umbrellas', 'Cherbourg', '34', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'sense', 'everyone', 'board', 'having', 'great', 'time.Highly', 'recommended', 'middletons', 'out', 'there', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'infatuated', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'movie', 'crack', 'seriously', '5', '5']",At Middleton

Both stellar movies.  And here they are again, together.  What potential.  And they gave it their best. I felt embarrassed for them, watching them  rn through fountains, stoned, and imitating Charlie Chaplin.  This whole movie is a trite piece of formulaic writing -- you know, you've seen these antics before -- parents let down their hair and get high while uptight kids try to navigate their futures.  A word used incorrectly makes the round from one to the other and finally back again.  Parents hijack a couple of bicycles and go tooling around the campus, oh what fun.  Trust me -- you've seen all these silly devices before, or close enough, many times.  The good bits -- there is some honest dialogue about facing into empty nest mid life loneliness.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 3]","SPOILER AHEADTwo people, both in complacent marriages, meet by chance one morning, fall in love, and then, at the end of the day, go back to their own, separate lives.I know that sounds like the plot of Noel Coward's BRIEF ENCOUNTER, but it also applies to AT MIDDLETON, a pleasant romantic comedy, recently released onto DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment.Andy Garcia and Vera Farmiga play parents of college-ready kids, who are spending an ""open house"" day at Middleton University.  Staid Garcia is a heart surgeon, traveling with his son (Spencer Lofranco), who doesn't really want to be there, while the more adventurous Vera, who runs a children's furniture store, is with her daughter (played by her sister, Taissa Farmiga), and that young lady is gung ho to study under linguistics professor Tom Skerritt.Neither parent seems to be getting on that well with their individual offspring, so they break away from the tour and stroll the campus on their own.  Despite their differences in personality, the couple is definitely attracted to each other and, by the end of the day; each has discovered a passion within that had long been dormant.Adam Rodgers directed and co-wrote  (with Glenn German) AT MIDDLETON, a film with likable characters, well played by a fine cast, and spry dialogue.  Indeed, this is an amiable movie, though I do feel that it overstays its welcome by about fifteen minutes, and there is also one key scene in an acting class that feels forced.  Certainly these talented writers could have come up with a more believable way to get over that story juncture.Peter Riegert plays a key supporting role in the picture.DVD extras include audio commentary by Rodgers, German and Garcia, outtakes and a music video by Andy Garcia.

1691495,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00HQOD0SM,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 3]","""At Middleton"" is a mid-life romance that suffers from a terminal case of the cutes. Edith (Vera Farmiga) and George (Andy Garcia) meet while taking their respective children, Audrey (Taissa Farmiga) and Conrad (Spencer Lofranco), on a tour of a fictional college (their respective spouses are conveniently unable to attend the event). While the kids are going through the official orientation, the two parents break off and conduct a tour of their own, exploring the campus as well as each other.Despite the best of intentions, ""At Middleton"" feels phony from the get-go. We get the sense that Edith and George are unreasonably antagonistic towards one another at the beginning just so they can become an item by the end. And things don't get any better from there, as the parents proceed to make fun of the tour guide, steal bikes from some unsuspecting students on campus, horn in on an acting class, smooch in a projection booth, get stoned in a dorm room, and in general act superior to everyone they meet, with corn, affectation and heavy-handed life lessons the order of the day.Though the movie tries very hard to achieve moments of ""little people"" sentimental uplift, virtually every scene in ""At Middleton"" emerges as hopelessly contrived and calculated, a reflection more on the screenwriters Glenn German and Adam Rogers (who also directed the movie) than on the actors, who do their best under the circumstances. Farigna, so impressive in TV's ""Bates Motel,"" comes across as unnecessarily grating at times, the result of a grown woman behaving in a less mature fashion than her teenaged daughter perhaps, her joie de vivre and truth-telling assertiveness, which might have seemed refreshing in small doses, ultimately falling over the edge into obnoxiousness (though she does well playing opposite her real life daughter). As the buttoned-down heart surgeon who really needs to loosen up and learn how to enjoy life, Garcia is constrained by having to embody a character with no truly interesting or compelling personal traits (the fact that he's supposed to be that way doesn`t exactly make him any more interesting).I know we're supposed to be moved and inspired by what`s happening between Edith and George, but all I could think about while watching their story unfold is how some parents just can't help making what is supposed to be a special day for their kids really all about themselves.",2,Middling through Middleton,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,2409,"['Middleton', 'mid-life', 'romance', 'suffers', 'terminal', 'case', 'cutes', 'Edith', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'George', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'meet', 'taking', 'respective', 'children', 'Audrey', 'Taissa', 'Farmiga', 'Conrad', 'Spencer', 'Lofranco', 'tour', 'fictional', 'college', 'respective', 'spouses', 'are', 'conveniently', 'unable', 'attend', 'event', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'official', 'orientation', 'two', 'parents', 'break', 'off', 'conduct', 'tour', 'own', 'exploring', 'campus', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'intentions', 'Middleton', 'feels', 'phony', 'get-go', 'get', 'sense', 'Edith', 'George', 'are', 'unreasonably', 'antagonistic', 'towards', 'one', 'beginning', 'just', 'can', 'become', 'item', 'end', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'there', 'parents', 'proceed', 'make', 'fun', 'tour', 'guide', 'steal', 'bikes', 'unsuspecting', 'students', 'campus', 'horn', 'acting', 'class', 'smooch', 'projection', 'booth', 'get', 'stoned', 'dorm', 'room', 'general', 'act', 'superior', 'everyone', 'meet', 'corn', 'affectation', 'heavy-handed', 'life', 'lessons', 'order', 'day.Though', 'movie', 'very', 'hard', 'achieve', 'moments', 'little', 'people', 'sentimental', 'uplift', 'virtually', 'scene', 'Middleton', 'hopelessly', 'contrived', 'calculated', 'reflection', 'more', 'screenwriters', 'Glenn', 'German', 'Adam', 'Rogers', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'movie', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'best', 'circumstances', 'Farigna', 'so', 'impressive', 'TV', 'Bates', 'Motel', 'unnecessarily', 'grating', 'times', 'result', 'grown', 'woman', 'behaving', 'less', 'mature', 'fashion', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'perhaps', 'joie', 'vivre', 'truth-telling', 'assertiveness', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'refreshing', 'small', 'doses', 'ultimately', 'falling', 'edge', 'obnoxiousness', 'well', 'playing', 'opposite', 'real', 'life', 'daughter', 'buttoned-down', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'who', 'really', 'loosen', 'up', 'learn', 'how', 'enjoy', 'life', 'Garcia', 'constrained', 'having', 'embody', 'character', 'truly', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'personal', 'traits', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', 'way', 't', 'exactly', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', '.I', 'know', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'moved', 'inspired', 'what', 's', 'happening', 'Edith', 'George', 'could', 'think', 'watching', 'story', 'unfold', 'how', 'parents', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'making', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'special', 'day', 'kids', 'really']",At Middleton

He soon is joined in the parking lot by Edith Martin (Vera Farmiga), who is also bringing her opinionated daughter, Audrey (Taissa Farmiga, Vera's actual sister).  Edith is a free spirited, beautiful woman, and is more cautious about the University's safety than her daughter appears to be.The two teens are not all that enthused about having to go on this tour with the guide.  They appear so informed already and a bit bored with it all. Justin (Nicolas Braun), better known as the `Dingleberry', although this is how they are able to view what may be the school they will be attending.  As the group of intended students and their family members begin, Conrad and Audrey's parents purposely get separated from everyone for an adventure of their own.  Edith hops on a student's parked bike and taunts George until he does the same, taking off for the day.Directed by Adam Rodgers, this is a feeling story which is much more about the two adult lives and much less about their children's.  George and Edith are like vinegar and oil when they first start out, then their tangible chemistry just oozes to the surface.  Farmiga shines pitching satirical one-liners at Garcia, who is the perfect straight man for her quipping.  The dialogue takes on a tone that is witty, wisecracking, and extremely likable for the two leads.  Throughout the day, these two experience several different people, places and situations together.  One with distinct significance is the Bell Tower, which gets revisited at a later time.  The two of them also slip into an acting class, among several other things, while it is in session commenting aloud to the director that the scene about marriage didn't seem plausible to them.  She has the two of them improvise, at a moments notice, a situation for the group of students that gets dangerously close to the quality of their own lives and their marriages.  It is after this point that the dialogue and the feelings between them take on new meaning and open up parts of them that they have kept hidden for many years.There are a couple of smaller roles with Tom Skerritt as Dr. Roland Emerson, the Linguistics Professor, that Audrey is itching to study with. Also an unexpected music themed role with Peter Riegert as 'Boneyard Slims' along with Conrad, making this even more interesting.  I really enjoyed this movie for the little story with the huge heart that it was for me and also for the easily developed chemistry between Garcia and Farmiga.

The actress who plays the mother was just way over the top and the scene with the 2 of them in the drama class was totally unbelievable...I mean he was an intelligent heart surgeon who in the space of an afternoon climbs towers, smokes pot, participates in a drama class and jumps in a fountain then goes about his business.  I wanted to love this movie but it was so beyond unbelievable that it was irritating to watch!
