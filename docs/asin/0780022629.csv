Mark is a video photography buff who films his victims in their death throes because he likes seeing the fear in their eyes (The sad result of a traumatic childhood experience in which his scientist father would drop a lizard on him and film his fear as part of his experiments. Nice guy. Director Powell plays his father in the flashback sequence). But then a funny thing happens to Mark: he falls in love with Helen (Moira Shearer)one of his models/intended victims; and tries to keep the object of his affection from making him film her, because Mark automatically equates film and photography with  pain and death. (His camera tripod has an extendable blade which he plunges into the throats of his victims).Boehm gives a performance which is simultaneously naive and frightening.Years ahead of its time, PEEPING TOM remains one of the most chilling British films ever lensed. While rather tame by today's standards its cult status is assured and there's no denying the influence it had on later films like REPULSION, FADE TO BLACK and HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.

There are a lot of odd things going on here. The oddest is why the central character, Mark Lewis, is so obviously a blond, blue-eyed German. Very strange, this. Is there some weird subterranean comment about the sickness of Hitler's Germany, and how we ought to feel sorry for the perpetrators of his crimes, because of their blighted childhoods? Much of the rest of the symbolism is very heavy-handed, however, as other reviewers have pointed out. It is consistently perverse. The director of the film within the film: ""The Walls are Closing In"", is played by an actor who was in point of fact virtually blind. He had a bit part in several James Bond films. Is there some message here? Peeping Tom's father, the heartless psychologist, was played by Powell himself. What is this telling us?  Is part of the message meant to be that the camera kills? It doesn't hang together somehow. What's the meaning of the model with half a hideous face? Why is the would-be girl-friend's alcoholic mother blind? Why is the only presence with real star quality, Moira Shearer, playing a stand-in? Much of the premise of the film seems promising, but it is clumsily written, and directed with a leaden hand. In fact, what many of the Powell-Pressburger films seem to lack is any real sense of pace or excitement. It's all a bit tired, and slow. There is nausea, but no shock or thrill.

27010,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,0780022629,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","PEEPING TOM singlehandedly destroyed the career of producer-director Michael Powell in 1960.  Universally reviled by critics and basically ignored by audiences, the film slid into obscurity.  Only now has PEEPING TOM begun to be recognized as a modern classic of the thriller genre.Clean-cut Mark Lewis (Karlheinz Bohm) works as a camera operator at a London film studio, and moonlights as a photographer for ""girlie pictures"" above a seedy newsagency.  He also hides a dark secret; where he stalks and murders lovely young women, capturing their last moments of sheer terror on his portable movie camera.  Mark's neighbour Helen (Anna Massey) strikes up a friendship with him, but could her life also be in danger?PEEPING TOM, filmed in glorious blazing Technicolor, is filled with intriguing performances and lots of underlying subtext.  Bohm is mesmerizing to watch as the conflicted and tortured Mark, especially when his relationship with the Anna Massey character starts to bloom and he begins to start walking away from his dark and murderous desires.  Bohm is best-remembered for his role of Emperor Franz-Joseph in the beloved ""Sissi"" trilogy--a far cry indeed from his intense performance in PEEPING TOM.Michael Powell also got to reunite with his ""Red Shoes"" leading lady Moira Shearer, who plays Vivian, a stand-in at the film studio where Mark works.  Vivian becomes another victim of Mark's bizarre fetish, but not before Shearer is showcased dancing an expressionistic jazz routine (a sequence again scored by ""Red Shoes"" composer Brian Easdale).  Shearer always looked very lovely in Technicolor with her flaming red hair.  I assume Powell called in a few favours by getting Shearer--who is the second-billed in the credits (despite her role being a supporting one).Fans of good quality thrillers will get a real kick out of PEEPING TOM, a true classic of the genre, with lots of rewards for multiple viewing.",4,"""Take me to your cinema""",1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,1925,"['PEEPING', 'TOM', 'singlehandedly', 'destroyed', 'career', 'producer-director', 'Michael', 'Powell', '1960', 'Universally', 'reviled', 'critics', 'basically', 'ignored', 'audiences', 'film', 'slid', 'obscurity', 'Only', 'now', 'PEEPING', 'TOM', 'begun', 'be', 'recognized', 'modern', 'classic', 'thriller', 'genre.Clean-cut', 'Mark', 'Lewis', 'Karlheinz', 'Bohm', 'camera', 'operator', 'London', 'film', 'studio', 'moonlights', 'photographer', 'girlie', 'pictures', 'seedy', 'newsagency', 'also', 'dark', 'secret', 'where', 'murders', 'lovely', 'young', 'women', 'capturing', 'last', 'moments', 'sheer', 'terror', 'portable', 'movie', 'camera', 'Mark', 'neighbour', 'Helen', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'up', 'friendship', 'could', 'life', 'also', 'be', 'danger', 'PEEPING', 'TOM', 'filmed', 'glorious', 'blazing', 'Technicolor', 'filled', 'intriguing', 'performances', 'lots', 'underlying', 'subtext', 'Bohm', 'mesmerizing', 'watch', 'conflicted', 'tortured', 'Mark', 'especially', 'when', 'relationship', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'character', 'bloom', 'start', 'walking', 'away', 'dark', 'murderous', 'desires', 'Bohm', 'best-remembered', 'role', 'Emperor', 'Franz-Joseph', 'beloved', 'Sissi', 'trilogy', 'far', 'cry', 'indeed', 'intense', 'performance', 'PEEPING', 'TOM.Michael', 'Powell', 'also', 'got', 'reunite', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'leading', 'lady', 'Moira', 'Shearer', 'who', 'Vivian', 'stand-in', 'film', 'studio', 'where', 'Mark', 'Vivian', 'victim', 'Mark', 'bizarre', 'fetish', 'not', 'Shearer', 'showcased', 'dancing', 'expressionistic', 'jazz', 'routine', 'sequence', 'again', 'scored', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'composer', 'Brian', 'Easdale', 'Shearer', 'always', 'looked', 'very', 'lovely', 'Technicolor', 'flaming', 'red', 'hair', 'assume', 'Powell', 'called', 'few', 'favours', 'getting', 'Shearer', 'who', 'second-billed', 'credits', 'role', 'being', 'supporting', 'one', '.Fans', 'good', 'quality', 'thrillers', 'will', 'get', 'real', 'kick', 'PEEPING', 'TOM', 'true', 'classic', 'genre', 'lots', 'rewards', 'multiple', 'viewing']",N/A
27011,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,0780022629,Carl Manes,"[2, 2]","It has been widely publicized that Michael Powell's PEEPING TOM rivals the masterful filming techniques of the great Alfred Hitchcock, and rightly so. In many ways, it is even more daring, subversive, and groundbreaking than many of Hitchcock's best, which were the same reasons it was panned by critics at the time of its release and unfortunately was the cause for Powell's retreat from the industry. Its characters are brilliantly written and set into play in an imperfect world with a seedy underbelly. PEEPING TOM finds young cameraman with a troubling past that uses a spiked tripod to slay his victims as he films their last moments of terror for his own personal enjoyment. His murderous and voyeuristic tendencies trickle in to his daily life as the cinematographer for a local movie shoot, and it isn't long before the police begin to take notice of his sordid affairs. Bohm's portrayal of Mark is only slightly offsetting, generally exhibiting a calm and disarming persona, but with very subtle cracks where he compulsively obsesses over his camera and folds when confronted with the truth. His sunken eyes and forced smile are just a human mask under which a soulless killer resides. There are very few moments where Bohm comes across as anything but a cold machine, and they are each drawn out of him by the unsuspecting Vivian. It is only fitting that Vivian's blind mother instinctually sees through Mark's charming exterior, using her other heightened senses in an equally intruding manner to out her daughter's reclusive suitor. This is also one of if not the first movies to use the subjective first-person perspective as shown through the eyes of the camera. Many critics of the time found this to be a tasteless technique that forces the audience to relate with the killer and engage in his activities, but it is simply a tool used to convey Mark's scoptophilic obsession to the audience. What makes the film so uniquely interesting is how the themes of voyeurism infiltrate every aspect of the script. Even the police keep a hidden and watchful eye on our killer, and Vivian finds herself compelled to sneak into Mark's apartment to play the reels which he holds so close to him. I never expect to enjoy or understand the works of the early masters, but PEEPING TOM is just as relevant, darkly genius, and compelling as it was upon its release in 1960.

27012,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,0780022629,Casey62,"[1, 1]","British director, Michael Powell is acclaimed for groundbreaking masterpieces like A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH (1946), THE RED SHOES (1948), and THE TALES OF HOFFMANN (1951). His equally innovative, and at the same time most notorious film is the brilliantly perverse PEEPING TOM (1960). Released just a few months before Alfred Hitchcock's similar PSYCHO, Powell's thriller is one of the first, and still considered one of the best to explore the motivations of a psychopath's mind.PEEPING TOM is about a voyeuristic murderer who has the gruesome obsession of filming his female victims at the moment of their death. His childhood experiences of being subjected to his father's sadistic experiments were the cause for his psychosis.Carl Boehm is superb as the seriously disturbed young man, Mark, and manages to gain our sympathy despite the horrible acts he commits. Besides his fascination with fear, Mark is a film fanatic whose Bell & Howell 16mm movie camera is mounted on a tri-pod with a steel-spiked leg, which he uses as a weapon to pierce his victims' throats.Unlike slasher movies of today, PEEPING TOM doesn't rely on graphic depictions of the murders, but suggests them through the creative, cinematic manipulation of our worst imagination. In fact, while even PSYCHO contains at least some blood, PEEPING TOM doesn't show any at all. This is surprising for a color movie, in which the redness of blood could have been exploited the way it was beginning to in Britain's Hammer horror productions of that period. Nevertheless, the rich, eye-popping color photography is one of PEEPING TOM's enduring strengths giving it the look of a seedy, pulp novel's cover come to life.This film was one of the most controversial ever made in Britain, and was banned in that country for years. Critics called it ""the sickest and filthiest film"", and demanded it be ""flushed down the nearest sewer"". A film far ahead of its time, PEEPING TOM has steadily gained its worthy reputation as an offbeat, underground classic which, despite its lurid subject matter, exudes a genuine sensitivity.For those with a multi-region player, the best quality on PEEPING TOM is Studio/Canal's 2007 region 2/PAL Special Edition DVD from England.

Both would make an outstanding double feature on a stormy night.  Martin Scorcese claimed this is one of the greatest films depicting the mechanics of directing.It's the story of Mark, who works behind the scenes at the film studio.  He has a strange fascination with the camera, which stems from his childhood.  His father had an incessant passion, actually a sadistic passion, with capturing every aspect of his son's life on tape.  Never a free moment off the record, which would be tough for anybody.  His dad also enjoyed catching the reactions of the nervous system to fear, especially in children.  Mark constantly would wake up in the middle of the night, petrified by his father's twisted experiments.So, of course Mark grew up with issues.  Add to the fact that his mom died when he was young, so he lacked that motherly nurturing spirit to help offset his crazy dad's obsession.  Does that sound like a crazy sex-fiend who loves to kill women in the making?  Yep, you guessed it.He would capture each murder on tape of course.  There would be a hidden blade in the tripod of the camera, which would be the last thing his victims would see before they die.As you watch him work, you get the uncomfortable feeling that you're the one peeping at the unlucky ladies.  You become the voyeur.  That's probably a big part of the reason this film was pulled from the theaters after one week.  It essentially ruined the career of the director.One thing I really enjoyed about this film was the psychological process the filmmaker uses to accomplish their goals with the actor or actress.  I've heard of some pretty drastic tactics used by some directors.  I remember hearing about John Singleton making his debut film, Boyz-in-the-Hood.  He suprised the cast with live ammunition being fired from a machine gun in order to get them all to run frantically away.  That's effective filmmaking.There was a moment during Peeping Tom where Mark was alone with an actress, he was filming and trying to scare her.  She said ""I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me, but I just don't feel frightened"".  Silly b#$%ch, wait til he pulls the knife out and we'll see some Oscar worthy acting.  Haha.Peeping Tom is just plain brilliant filmmaking, no doubt about it.

27014,A2HI0VW335YX4L,0780022629,Charlie Peterson,"[4, 7]","As a fan of the Criterion Collection, I was intrigued by the premise of ""Peeping Tom"".  The idea of a young, psychotic cameraman filming his victims at the moment of death while forcing them to see their reflection in a distorted mirror was definitely disturbing subject matter.  If you've done any looking into the movie at all, you already know the back story:  it virtually destroyed Michael Powell's career, and was regarded as ""filth"" upon its release.  However, much of this film remained a mystery until I purchased the DVD (it's a bit difficult to find to rent), so I'll try to provide some insight to anyone who's debating buying this one.The film is bathed in 60's Technicolor, and Criterion's got this one looking delicious.  It's as if Michael Powell wanted all the colors as pronounced and accentuated as possible, to give each aspect of each shot the ability to stand on its own.  The sound is no different from any other movie of that era, and the piano score by Gordon Watson weaves in and out of the poignant ""attack"" music to the classic ""crashing"" chords after it's all over....almost a clich&eacute; in the horror/slasher genre.That said, however, ""Peeping Tom"" is not a bloody film.  In fact, there's very little carnage shown.  Like ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", it's more of a psychological ""profiler""-type film.  What makes Mark Lewis do the things he does?  That much is made clear to us when we view the movies he presents to Anna Massey in his upstairs screening room:  he's been the lifelong subject of his father's experiments on the human reaction to fear.  Even though his father is deceased, he still feels the desire to carry on his father's work.  But he takes it a step further when he begins committing fetishistic homicide, developing his ""snuff"" films for his own enjoyment.By today's standard's, ""Peeping Tom"" is no longer the travesty it was branded in 1960.  Many movies since have followed the groundwork Powell laid, and have gone far deeper into the deeply disturbing tunnel of psychomania and murder.  However, there are elements present in ""Peeping Tom"" which never go out of style and never get old.....those elements which, when mixed, form a spine-chilling concoction that doesn't quickly dissipate.About the DVD:  accompanying the movie is an audio essay by film theorist Laura Mulvey, in which she hyperanalyzes and maps out each section of the movie, the inside jokes (one of the early scenes shows a renowned British actor, known for playing stately roles, as a purchaser of pornography), etc.  Also included is a fascinating Channel 4 UK documentary providing insight on the life of screenwriter Leo Marks.  This program shows the evolution of the story of ""Peeping Tom"", reaching back to Marks' days in the war as a code breaker.  The documentary also features appearances by Karl Boehm, Anna Massey, Columba Powell and others, as well as past-and-present journalists and film critics.""Peeping Tom"" is not for everyone.  If you're into films about film, ""PT"" presents an interesting and risqu&eacute; slant on the topic.  If you're into blood and guts, you'll have to use your imagination on this one (though it wouldn't be hard....).  But if you're into chilling, thought-provoking psychodrama presented in 60's Technicolor, ""Peeping Tom"" is one to check out.",3,Voyeurism in Technicolor,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,3313,"['fan', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'idea', 'young', 'psychotic', 'cameraman', 'filming', 'victims', 'moment', 'death', 'forcing', 'see', 'reflection', 'distorted', 'mirror', 'was', 'definitely', 'disturbing', 'subject', 'matter', ""'ve"", 'done', 'looking', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'back', 'story', 'virtually', 'destroyed', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'career', 'was', 'regarded', 'filth', 'release', 'However', 'much', 'film', 'remained', 'mystery', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'bit', 'difficult', 'find', 'rent', 'so', ""'ll"", 'try', 'provide', 'insight', 'anyone', 'who', 'debating', 'buying', 'one.The', 'film', 'bathed', '60', 'Technicolor', 'Criterion', 'got', 'one', 'looking', 'delicious', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'wanted', 'colors', 'pronounced', 'accentuated', 'possible', 'give', 'aspect', 'shot', 'ability', 'stand', 'own', 'sound', 'different', 'other', 'movie', 'era', 'piano', 'score', 'Gordon', 'Watson', 'poignant', 'attack', 'music', 'classic', 'crashing', 'chords', '.almost', 'clich', 'eacute', 'horror/slasher', 'genre.That', 'said', 'however', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'not', 'bloody', 'film', 'fact', 'very', 'little', 'carnage', 'shown', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'more', 'psychological', 'profiler', '-type', 'film', 'What', 'Mark', 'Lewis', 'do', 'things', 'much', 'made', 'clear', 'when', 'view', 'movies', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'upstairs', 'screening', 'room', 'been', 'lifelong', 'subject', 'father', 'experiments', 'human', 'reaction', 'fear', 'Even', 'father', 'deceased', 'still', 'desire', 'carry', 'father', 'work', 'step', 'further', 'when', 'committing', 'fetishistic', 'homicide', 'developing', 'snuff', 'films', 'own', 'enjoyment.By', 'today', 'standard', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'longer', 'travesty', 'was', 'branded', '1960', 'Many', 'movies', 'have', 'followed', 'groundwork', 'Powell', 'laid', 'have', 'gone', 'far', 'deeper', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'tunnel', 'psychomania', 'murder', 'However', 'are', 'elements', 'present', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'never', 'go', 'style', 'never', 'get', 'old', '..those', 'elements', 'when', 'mixed', 'form', 'spine-chilling', 'concoction', ""n't"", 'quickly', 'dissipate.About', 'DVD', 'accompanying', 'movie', 'audio', 'essay', 'film', 'theorist', 'Laura', 'Mulvey', 'out', 'section', 'movie', 'inside', 'jokes', 'one', 'early', 'scenes', 'renowned', 'British', 'actor', 'known', 'playing', 'stately', 'roles', 'purchaser', 'pornography', 'etc', 'Also', 'included', 'fascinating', 'Channel', '4', 'UK', 'documentary', 'providing', 'insight', 'life', 'screenwriter', 'Leo', 'Marks', 'program', 'evolution', 'story', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'reaching', 'back', 'Marks', 'days', 'war', 'code', 'breaker', 'documentary', 'also', 'appearances', 'Karl', 'Boehm', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'Columba', 'Powell', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'past-and-present', 'journalists', 'film', 'critics', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'not', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'films', 'film', 'PT', 'interesting', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'slant', 'topic', ""'re"", 'blood', 'guts', ""'ll"", 'have', 'use', 'imagination', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hard', ""'re"", 'chilling', 'thought-provoking', 'psychodrama', 'presented', '60', 'Technicolor', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'one', 'check', 'out']",N/A

Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[3, 4]","If Hitchcock's Psycho can be called the father of the modern slasher film, than PEEPING TOM must be the mother of them.  Director Michael Powell (Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes) kissed his career goodbye when he made this still disturbing, denounced, and banned film about a psychotic serial killer (much like Tod Browning did when he made Freaks). Most of the film is told from the perspective of a disturbed serial killer and several murder scenes are shown from the perspective of the killer and these are the ones which upset people a great deal in 1960.  The film has many thematically similar ideas to Hitchcock's Rear Window and voyeurism.  This film however took ideas where no man had gone before and did so in color.  It's still a sometimes surprisingly brutal film, though it's minimal gore is quite tame by today's standards.I'm sure there will be some who will call the film's mixture of psychological terror, voyuerism and mild gore dull.

To say it was misunderstood at the time would be an understatement, as over time it has come to be recognized as a masterpiece of filmmaking. It is often compared with Psycho in terms of shock value, but Peeping Tom's Mark Lewis makes Norman Bates look like the Easter Bunny by comparison.Carl Boehm plays Mark Lewis, by day a camera assistant at a film studio, by night a photographer for girly magazines who murders women and films them while he's doing so. Why does he do so? It gives him a sexual rush to see the fear in their eyes when they realize they are going to be killed. His father was a biologist, he explains to Helen (Anna Massey), a young woman who lives in his building, and his father was especially interested in fear in children, so he made Mark a test subject. You can see the connection here: a bruised childhood leading to abnormal adult behavior.The relationship between Mark and Helen is a peculiar one. She is terribly curious about him; at first she seems to think he's a nice young man, but during their first encounter, Mark shows her some strange film and she becomes outraged, yet she does not run away. Her interest in him seems to only grow, despite his clearly creepy ways. In an ordinary film, Mark would be a villain, and we would hate him, because he is a murderer. But what Peeping Tom asks is for us to sympathize with this man, because it is not entirely his fault that he is the way he is. The major conflict in the film is between Mark and himself, as he struggles to suppress his urges and contain his own fears.This is a horror movie, but the only monster is a human, and that makes it all the more frightful, because it is horror rooted in reality. There are sick people like Mark Lewis out there in the world, and you read about them in the newspaper just about every day. Peeping Tom doesn't terrify with ""Boo!"" moments, but rather it works on a more cerebral level, letting the audience into the twisted mind of a killer.So why was this film such a topic of controversy in 1960? Well, never before were audiences asked to look upon a sadistic killer as anything but an irredeemable evil person, and nobody was really expecting that. This film is the kind that is intended to disturb instead of entertain, and when you go to a movie expecting to be entertained and end up being disturbed instead, you tend not to look favorably on the movie. Peeping Tom has been an incredibly influential film for today's filmmakers, as its influences can be seen in films from Road to Perdition to Red Dragon.

27017,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0780022629,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 7]","This is a great, unpleasant, disturbing film made by Michael Powell three years after he and his partner in the Archers, Emeric Pressburger, went their own ways. British critics loathed it, said so loudly, and the movie died within weeks of its release. Some say it destroyed Powell's career.Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) is a young man who works as a camera puller at a movie studio, who also at night photogaphs girlie pictures for magazines. His father, a psychologist, studied the effects of fear by putting his son in terrible situations and then photographing the child's reactions. Lewis lives in the second floor of a house and often watches those movies while he sits alone in the dark.Lewis also does something else. In the tripod of his camera there is a concealed knife. As he photographs a girl the knife pushes into her, while the camera films her face as she realizes she is going to die and then while she is dying. He plays back these movies, too. As you watch Peeping Tom you become a voyeur participant in what he is doing. He meets the young woman who lives below him and it is apparent that she is at first curious about him, but then attracted to him. He finds within himself an attraction that might be love, might be salvation, but which is conflicted. The movie plays out with tension, remorse and even sympathy. The ending is somewhat unexpected, but with hindsight also inevitable.And maybe that is what made this movie so controversial. Lewis is a sympathetic figure. You know what his father put him through because you've watched those old movies. Boehm playes Lewis as a shy, nice, rather sad young man. Anna Massey, who plays Helen Stephens, the girl on the first floor, is a first-rate actress and in this role she is excellent. She eventually realizes something is wrong with Lewis, but still wants to give him love and help.This movie was released just weeks after Psycho. Hitchcock's career was enhanced, Powell's was hurt. I think the difference was that while Norman Bates was weird to begin with and the frights were real, you could laugh at yourself afterward. Not so with Peeping Tom.

Seen today, almost fifty years later, it is of course diminished in its capacity to shock. But it is still both disturbing and entertaining. Carl Boehm plays Mark Lewis, an assistant cameraman working for a small studio in London. He has a secret life as well--he also photographs nudes for a local shop owner/pornographer. But he also has an even bigger secret--he kills women and photographs them at the moment of death, then plays back the film to himself over and over. He starts to get to know his downstairs neighbor Helen (Anna Massey), a sweet young woman attracted to the shy, quiet Mark. We gradually learn why he is so messed up--his scientist father filmed him constantly while he grew up and subjected him to ""terror experiments,"" obsessing the boy with the effects of fear and how photography can capture life, even when it can no longer be lived normally. Of course, a stable relationship is out of the question for someone who is only comfortable watching life around him as a voyeur, so it becomes a matter of waiting for Mark to snap as the tension builds. It's amazing to a modern audience that this could so upset viewers back in 1960. It's not gory at all, with the violence suggested but still mighty intense. This is strong stuff, especially in the context of the time in which it was made and well worth catching for horror buffs.

Since the last film I had sought out from this book happened to be amazing (Roman Polanski's Repulsion), I tried again.Peeping Tom must be one of those movies that need time and reconsideration through multiple viewings.  The first time I saw it, it bored me and I fell asleep.  The second time, I was intrigued by many parts, but as a whole found it disjointed and strange.I understand how it could be a ""masterpiece,"" but also think that since he was so reviled at the time he is given landmark status now to make up for the fact that his career was ruined.The movie is about a man with sexual and psychological perversions who acts out on the torments he endured from his father--only his victims are women (mostly of ill repute: actresses, hookers and porn models).  He is  demented in his isolated world with his camera until he meets Helen and her blind mother.  Through Helen, we learn all about Mark and his fractured self.The concept of the movie is the real winner.  Reading about it, you would think it the most brilliant script ever written.  But the actual film is disappointing with this mindset.  Some acting is overdone.  Some scenes drag on, while others are cut short.  You never see enough to understand (but this is where the terror lies, in the unknown!), yet in the end you see too much and it seems like Mark is now hamming it up.  I also think that this film would have been better in black and white (like its companion Psycho, to which this movie will be eternally paired with, although I cannot figure out why, nor do I endorse such sentiments).Check it out to see if it was worth a ruined career.

27020,A2GYX971VETQBV,0780022629,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[0, 1]","_Peeping Tom_ is a shockingly original film that deals with themes of voyeurism, fear, and childhood trauma in a unique and interesting way.  The opening shot reveals the hand-camera work of the main character, Mark Lewis (played by Carl Boehm), who videotapes himself murdering an innocent woman, causing her terrible fright-the source of which we do not quite know.  He subsequently watches his video in a perverse scene of indulgence and therapy.  I particularly enjoyed the film-inside-a-film theme that runs throughout the movie's entire length.  As Mark satiates his desire for control and to complete a documentary on fear by watching his own snuff films, the audience peers over his shoulder and watches him work.Another aspect of this film that sets it apart from many thriller films is the amount of psychological complexity and character that we are treated to.  Mark Lewis's character is as much a victim as those he kills, in light of the fact that he himself was the subject of his own father's voyeuristic attraction to fear and psychological experiments.  Rather than being a killer motivated by power or sexual lust, Lewis's particular attraction is to capture the fear of his victims on camera in the same manner that his father captured his screams and reactions to torture.  Boehm plays the character splendidly and truly breathes life into the character of an emotionally unstable man with a vivid sense of his own troubles.  Far from a simple horror film centered around the actions of a serial killer, Boehm's portrayal fleshes out the mind and background of a demented serial killer, creating sympathy and a sense of understanding from those privileged to his background (namely we, the audience).On top of everything, I enjoyed the way that piano music was woven into the film and I really liked the entire soundtrack.  Finally, the ending of the film is absolutely tremendous, weird, and indescribable.  If the film seems a bit like trudging uphill it certainly blasts off in the final five minutes.  Critics apparently reviled the film for its voyeuristic camera shots and the fact that it portrayed Lewis as a sympathetic character-the same two reasons I found the film compelling.  Well, it isn't the 1960s anymore and you should definitely give this film a look.",4,There's a Little Tom in All of Us...,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,2292,"['_Peeping', 'Tom_', 'shockingly', 'original', 'film', 'deals', 'themes', 'voyeurism', 'fear', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'unique', 'interesting', 'way', 'opening', 'shot', 'hand-camera', 'work', 'main', 'character', 'Mark', 'Lewis', 'played', 'Carl', 'Boehm', 'who', 'murdering', 'innocent', 'woman', 'causing', 'terrible', 'fright-the', 'source', 'do', 'not', 'quite', 'know', 'subsequently', 'video', 'perverse', 'scene', 'indulgence', 'therapy', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'film-inside-a-film', 'theme', 'movie', 'entire', 'length', 'Mark', 'desire', 'control', 'complete', 'documentary', 'fear', 'watching', 'own', 'snuff', 'films', 'audience', 'peers', 'shoulder', 'work.Another', 'aspect', 'film', 'apart', 'many', 'thriller', 'films', 'amount', 'psychological', 'complexity', 'character', 'are', 'treated', 'Mark', 'Lewis', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'victim', 'light', 'fact', 'was', 'subject', 'own', 'father', 'voyeuristic', 'attraction', 'fear', 'psychological', 'experiments', 'Rather', 'being', 'killer', 'motivated', 'power', 'sexual', 'lust', 'Lewis', 'particular', 'attraction', 'capture', 'fear', 'victims', 'camera', 'same', 'manner', 'father', 'captured', 'screams', 'reactions', 'torture', 'Boehm', 'character', 'splendidly', 'truly', 'breathes', 'life', 'character', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'man', 'vivid', 'sense', 'own', 'troubles', 'Far', 'simple', 'horror', 'film', 'centered', 'actions', 'serial', 'killer', 'Boehm', 'portrayal', 'out', 'mind', 'background', 'demented', 'serial', 'killer', 'creating', 'sympathy', 'sense', 'understanding', 'privileged', 'background', 'namely', 'audience', 'top', 'everything', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'piano', 'music', 'was', 'woven', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'entire', 'soundtrack', 'Finally', 'ending', 'film', 'absolutely', 'tremendous', 'weird', 'indescribable', 'film', 'bit', 'trudging', 'uphill', 'certainly', 'off', 'final', 'five', 'minutes', 'Critics', 'apparently', 'reviled', 'film', 'voyeuristic', 'camera', 'shots', 'fact', 'portrayed', 'Lewis', 'sympathetic', 'character-the', 'same', 'two', 'reasons', 'found', 'film', 'compelling', 'Well', ""n't"", '1960s', 'anymore', 'should', 'definitely', 'give', 'film', 'look']",N/A

Not because of it's squeamish subject matter, rather, it just doesn't deliver the goods.  There's alot of rhetoric here about voyeurism and cinephilia but it doesn't amount to much.  The best I can say here is that Powell is still a master of color.  Whereas other director's use black-and-white to ratchet a suspenseful mood Powell uses the full spectrum of colors to suggest horror.  His use of the color red is interesting, particularly in a horror film where not a drop of blood is spilled.

27022,A36L1F0YECOAW8,0780022629,David Grant,"[14, 16]","In a day and age where the importance of film in our society grows in leaps and bounds everyday, Michael Powell's devastating and completely unforgettable &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; levels the most convincing argument that we don't just watch films... we live them. The killer in &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; is a kind, shy, almost child-like man who, as the son of a scientist father forever obsessed with the fear of children, was tormented as a child. Many times his father would shine lights in the sleeping boy's eyes or drop lizards onto his bed in order to frighten the child, all the while recording his reactions on film. When the boy grows up, he carries on his father's work... maybe a little too well. He decides that the greatest fear experienced comes at the point of death. He conceals a knife in the tripod of his ever-present camera and films his victims as they slowly realize their fate. He also (in a move Hitchcock would envy) forces them to watch their own frightened faces with a small mirror attached to the front of the camera. He desires fear and he goes to extreme lengths to achieve it in his victims. The movie not only asks us to sympathize with the killer (played with a certain charm and yet an air of repellance by Carl Boehm) but also participate in his crimes. We see what he sees while filming them, while watching his footage at home, we are (very eerily) immersed into his film. We are right beside him, watching his victims and relishing in their terror. The camera the killer carries is more of an extension of himself then merely a way of recording what he sees. When his lovely neighbor kisses him, his face remains immobile, as if he doesn't quite know what's going on. But when she walks into the next room, he places his lips onto the lense of the camera and a look of pure passion crosses his face. When she is asking for his opinion on where she should place the pin he has given to her for a birthday present, his hands follow hers as if recording their movement. It is a film about film and about the experience of a moviegoer. Like Hitchcock's &quot;Rear Window&quot; it is a truly exhilarating and unnerving experience about sitting in a theater and not only watching what is going on, but living it. And loving it.

Mark's little ""indie film"" project concerns a subject he is quite intimate with-a string of unsolved murders, all involving sexually alluring young women. You can detect a bit of ""Peeping Tom"" influence in 1966's ""Blow-Up"", 1985's controversial ""Henry:Portrait of A Serial Killer"", and even as recently as the 2002 Bob Crane biopic ""Auto Focus"".

The heroine's mother often sits at the fire-place, ladling out whiskey from a large bottle, even when talking to her daughter, but is still sober as a judge throughout.

27027,A2CPM6AEJHVNKL,0780022629,Found Highways,"[39, 45]","That's what Helen tells Mark in his projection room. Helen gets her wish later, when she watches a film Mark shot, and she gradually realizes it's not staged, but a real murder. Helen wants Mark to tell her that it's ""just a film, isn't it?""We've already seen the terror on the faces of women Mark has killed, so we know what Helen sees. We can't turn away any more than she can, even as she backs out of the room, knowing but not wanting to admit that the man she loves put a blade through women's throats and photographed them watching their own deaths with a mirror attached to the camera.Like Psycho, Peeping Tom is the story of a grown-up child who can't get rid of a parent. But Peeping Tom is better. The characters in Peeping Tom are more believable than the puppets Hitchcock moves around to create his ""pure cinema."" As freakish as Norman Bates is, as a personification of insanity he's as much a straw figure as Mother in the attic.Peeping Tom offended its audiences so much that it was pulled from theaters, wrecking director Michael Powell's career, so the story goes.Peeping Tom isn't more violent or sexually explicit than other movies from the time. We turn away from the victims as Mark's blade enters their throats. Even when he uses his camera-weapon on himself we don't see any blood. More horrific is Anna Massey as Helen watching the snuff film Mark left on the projector. (Did he leave it for her to find because he wanted her to see ""the documentary"" he was making, the way she showed him the children's book she was writing?) The scene that made me cringe the most was Mark playing tape recordings his father (an experimental biologist) made while exposing his son to frightening stimuli. We hear the young Mark screaming; we have to imagine what is making him scream.So Peeping Tom is upsetting, but also traditional. It hints more than it shows. Why did people react to it so much more violently than they did to Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) or Georges Franju's Eyes without a Face (1959)? Was it the just the difference between British vs. American or French sensibilities? Since World War II at least, the British have tolerated movie censorship more than other Europeans or Americans. Stanley Kubrick had the same kinds of problems with British critics and censors with A Clockwork Orange (1971) that Powell did with Peeping Tom. And Thatcherite Britain went nuts over the ""video nasties"" controversy in the 1980s.When I finally saw the DVD of Peeping Tom, two things struck me that might have made people so upset when it came out.First, the title may have led a lot of moviegoers to think they were going to get a softcore porn flick/thriller, like the ""erotic thrillers"" on video in the United States. When they didn't get lots of violence or nudity, maybe they felt cheated. Even worse than cheated, maybe they felt complicit. After you've been through the experience of watching Peeping Tom you know exactly who the title refers to. Audiences in 1960 might have resented Powell's holding a mirror up to them, the way that Mark held a mirror up to his victims as he plunged the knife in.Another reason audiences may have hated the movie might be the sympathy shown to the murderer Mark. And two things in particular could have antagonized moviegoers - - Mark's youth and his German accent.The look of Peeping Tom - - especially the outside locations - - at times is schizophrenic. It goes back and forth between the gaslit forties and the swinging sixties. Sometimes it looks like the Blitz is still going on, the city is dark, the buildings shadowy and decrepit. Sometimes it's sunny and you expect to see mods and rockers on the street. Are we going to run into Mrs. Miniver or Twiggy?This tension is in the first scene. We see two generations come into a stationery shop that sells ""French postcards."" First a dirty old man, fat, drooling over pictures, then a healthy young girl whose innocence won't allow itself to be stained by the pornographer (the shop owner) and murderer (Mark) inches away. She's from a different world.The handsome Aryan-looking Carl Boehm is Mark. He speaks fluent English, but with a definite German accent. Mark's father was a renowned scientist. We hear his voice on tape - - middle-class, educated, Received Pronunciation. Quite English.Of the subject a little: Peeping Tom is interesting linguistically. In the film Anna Massey as Helen has an accent that's sounds a touch archaic (not stagy, it sounds natural, just a little old-fashioned). But in Massey's interview for the DVD, which must have been done forty years later, her accent sounds like the Standard English of today. We also hear a film studio executive pronounce ""memo"" as ""MEE-mo."" Not exactly the Great Vowel Shift of the fifteenth century, but interesting.So Mark's father (working at the same time as the real behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner, who also observed, if not experimented on, his child at home) is English. Mark's mother is dead. If we want to invent a reason for Mark's accent I suppose his mother might have been German.Mark would have had to have grown up speaking German in another country for his English to sound the way it does, though. Or maybe Mark's father was bilingual and he and his German wife spoke German to Mark as part of another experiment.Whatever the reason is that Mark sounds like a German, that may have been the real reason British audiences in 1960 were repulsed by the movie. The Germans had been the enemy twice in half a century. People still alive had lost parents and children to German soldiers and bombs. How dare they expect us to feel sorry for this murdering Hun sex fiend. How dare they expect us to be glad for the Germans and their ""economic miracle"" when we had food rationing for years after the war we won.How dare they say we're like him.",5,"""I like to understand

27028,A2BPDFR58H9575,0780022629,Galina,"[2, 3]","It is hard to believe that the movie was a total fiasco when it was released 46 years ago. It was hated with the passion by both critics and the audiences alike. It was pulled out of the theaters only after one week. Why? It is a masterpiece. It is breathtaking combination of voyeurism, eroticism, and horror. The main character is a serial killer who films his victims as he literally kills them with his camera achieving the level of genuine fear and horror that no other filmmaker would be able to achieve. We watch the women as they die being filmed for a movie and paying with their lives for its grim realism. Maybe, that was the reason for hatred? ""Peeping Tom"" is provocative and very unsettling. The serial killer, a young, shy, attractive and sympathetic man is a victim himself. He was raised by a scientist father who filmed him under intensely emotional conditions studying how the fear affects the children. Powell himself played the father and his young son played young Mark Lewis. I think it also added to the initial shock when the movie was released. ""Peeping Tom"" is also the movie about making movies. Mark works as a camera assistant for a film director and dreams about becoming a famous director one day. He is ready to pay an ultimate price for finishing his own documentary.""Peeping Tom"" has been called a ""Very British ""Psycho"" and it was released two months before Hitchcock's film. The similarities are plenty but Powell's film is much darker and it does not have a psychiatrist in the end to explain Mark Lewis. Ironically, ""Peeping Tom's"" unavailability for many viewers for many years has preserved its power and impact better than the initial universal approval and praise would ever have done. I can understand the controversy of the subject but how could the sheer brilliance of film-making - the choice of music, the work of camera, the acting, the dark humor (the guy who looked like Hitchcock was darkly-hilarious) not have been noticed is beyond me.

27029,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0780022629,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Michael Powell (1905-1990) is generally regarded as one of England's finest filmmakers, working with partner Emeric Pressburger to produce and direct such extremely influential films A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH (1946), BLACK NARCISSUS (1947), THE RED SHOES (1948), and THE TALES OF HOFFMAN (1951.)  When his partnership with Pressburger ended in the late 1950s, Powell worked alone--and one of his first projects was the 1960 PEEPING TOM, a thriller based on a script by Leo Marks, noted World War II crytologist.  Critics were outraged by the film, which was withdrawn from release within a few weeks of its debut.  Although Powell made a few more films, it effectively ended his career, and it damaged the careers of many others associated with it, particularly actress Moira Shearer.The film is essentially a Freudian nightmare about a killer who photographs the expression on his victims faces as he murders them.  The resulting movie is strangely layered voyerism: we are made to know we are watching a film about a film about a film and so on; the fact that one of those layers is essentially the creation of snuff films, and the film's references to distorting mirrors and the implications that arouses, is also pretty creepy.  The killer, played by handsome young Carl Boehm, is also treated sympathetically, and given the period in which the film was made and released the combination was enough to raise every moral hackle imaginable.PEEPING TOM is frequently compared to Hitchcock films, most particularly REAR WINDOW, which is about voyerism; VERTIGO, from which it seems to borrow several particulars; and finally PSYCHO, which was released at about the same time.  According to film lore, Hitchcock refused to have a screening of PSYCHO for the English press specifically because he feared they would savage the film before the public could get to it--just as they had PEEPING TOM.  The English critics were indeed horrified by PSYCHO, but by the time the attack began the film was already popular at the box office, which had the effect of blunting their reviews.  But the truth is that PEEPING TOM doesn't hold up as well as these three Hitchcock films.  It is an uneven sort of film with great ideas but which never quite seems to carry those ideas all the way home.  There is nothing in the film that hits the same height of shock and horror as, for example, PSYCHO's famous shower scene.It was very hard to find a showing of PEEPING TOM during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and those that could be found were sometimes in black and white prints with various scenes chopped out.  Even so, the film developed a mystique, and today many filmmakers and critics, including Sorceses, regard it as an extremely fine film.  It certainly has been influential, and whenever film about film about film occurs the title PEEPING TOP is sure to be mentioned.  For myself, however, I think PEEPING TOM doesn't quite make the grade.  Interesting, yes, but seen today it is both a shade too obvious and a shade too subtle, and I can't imagine returning to it for a second viewing.  The Criterion edition includes an interesting documentary on writer Leo Marks, a nice commentary, and restores the cuts as much as possible.  The visual and sound elements are very good.

27032,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0780022629,Jeffrey Leach,"[25, 31]","When British director Michael Powell and screenwriter Leo Marks collaborated on the 1960 film &quot;Peeping Tom,&quot; the two really thought they had something special. The movie about a mentally unstable young man caught in the clutches of his father's psychological experiments horrified audiences and critics alike. Obscene, depraved, wildly inappropriate--these were only a few of the milder labels attached to the film. The movie played less than a week in cinema houses throughout Britain before disappearing. Powell, come to find out, was so devastated by the response to his movie that he promptly left England for Australia, never to return. In our crazy modern world, what people thought horribly twisted yesterday has an allure beyond reckoning for today's cranks. Thus, &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; has now become a movie lionized by modern filmmakers, students of film history, and critics. The Criterion Collection's release of the movie goes so far as to call Powell's film a &quot;British 'Psycho.'&quot; Well, I wouldn't go that far, but the movie is intriguing considering the date of its release (1960) and the subject matter it fearlessly tackles.Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) spends his days working the cameras at a film studio and his nights moonlighting as pin-up photographer and documentarian. He always carries a camera wherever he goes, photographing seemingly mundane objects as buildings and people. Lewis seems like a harmless sort of chap, but the dark secrets swirling in his mind would give the stoutest soul pause. He is a Peeping Tom, always gazing into windows or using his camera to spy on the intimate details of other people's lives. His illness seems to come from his childhood, when his famous psychologist father used Mark as a test subject in his work on human fears. Father would set up a camera in different rooms of the house, along with a tape recorder, and proceed to torment his son in various ways in order to monitor the boy's reaction. At some point in the proceedings, young Mark equated women with his terror fits, and as a full grown man he has decided to conduct his own amateur experiments. With camera and tripod firmly in tow, Lewis tricks women into situations where he can murder them and record their fear on celluloid. His first victim is a woman of the night, the next a would be actress at the studio. Mark initially gets away with his crimes because he blends easily into the background. He's polite to a fault, quiet in manner and movement, and solitary. He spends most of his time in the huge dark room at his house, endlessly replaying his sordid film footage and anguishing over his painful childhood.Enter Helen Stephens (Anna Massey), an aspiring author and tenant in Lewis's house. Young Stephens notices Mark when she sees him staring into her apartment during her birthday party. Intrigued, Helen follows Lewis up to his apartment, discovers he owns the house and acts as its landlord, and witnesses some of his bizarre behavior. Despite the uneasiness of their first meeting, Mark and Helen become fast friends. In fact, Lewis takes such a shine to Helen that the mere idea of &quot;photographing&quot; her--code for committing another murder--shocks him to the very marrow of his being. Helen really likes this man even though her blind, alcoholic mother despises young Lewis because she has an intuition that he is up to no good. Things begin to turn south for Mark when the police launch an investigation into the murders, Helen's mother confronts him about his activities, and he learns that his little problem will take years of therapy to overcome. Lewis loses his cool as the authorities close in but discovers a peace of sorts during the film's conclusion.Modern audiences will scratch their heads as they try to figure out why &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; was so controversial when it first came out. I think the primary reason this movie shocked British moviegoers and critics concerns how the movie presents such an appalling criminal as a figure worthy of sympathy and outright pity. No one wants to feel for a murderer of young women, but Powell's movie often gives Boehm's character endearing traits. When Helen comes to Mark requesting his aid with the photographs in her soon to be published book, Lewis visibly enthuses that anyone would honor him with such a request. The guy is genuinely happy about Helen's success, and further confounds audience perceptions by buying her a very nice brooch for her birthday. He gives her this gift not as a means for tricking her into a situation where he can victimize her, but because he likes her, respects her, and wants her to be happy. There are a few other reasons why &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; scandalized the British film industry, probably reasons best left unelaborated on here, but the film's refusal to judge Mark Lewis's behavior is probably the biggest reason for the insults heaped on this picture.I liked the film even though it is a relatively bloodless affair. Carl Boehm's performance as the tortured Mark Lewis provides the primary impetus for viewing this film. He captures perfectly the concept of a scared, tormented little boy wrapped in a man's body. Hats off to Criterion as well; they did a grand job with the widescreen picture transfer and the heap of extras included on the disc. There's a stills gallery, a trailer for the film, a lengthy documentary about screenwriter Leo Marks, and a commentary by one of those hoity-toity film historians. Don't go into this movie looking for a gory thriller. What you will find is a colorful, quiet movie about a very disturbed young man looking for a way out of his personal darkness.",4,"Subversive at the time, mild today",1073260800,"01 5,

But in this film, a.k.a. The Face of Fear and The Fotographer of Panic, the culprit has a movie camera and yearns to capture the terrible face of each woman before he kills her. Later, he can watch the sick shameful thing on the movie screen in his flat.The tom is played by Carl Boehm, blandly like a glass of warm milk fortified with invisible Botulinus toxin. Moira Shearer is killed off early, but not until she's done a looong sexy unballetic dance to hotstuff music from her tape machine. The climax of the film is a pile-on of effects, so excessive that Director Powell and the Editor must have been laffing up their sleeves. Powell and his son Columba (Bumba) appear in a black/white sequence of the film to good effect.One is startled by the bare flesh of two women in the porny room, with rumpled recliner, above the tobacco shop. As one woman turns to the camera, we see a badly repaired harelip: a photo of disfigurement can be heart sickening, can't it? The other woman with a looong peroxided ponytail does, I'm told, appear nude in a full-length side shot, but I must have been looking for a mike boom shadow at the time.The excellent Supplement, A Very British Psycho (50 mins, 1997), contains of course the hindsights of a number of critics. But the lightning bolt is Leo Marks(1920-2001), who wrote the screenplay. A cryptography genius, he recounts his activities in British service during WWII. They included writing a unique poem for each agent to memorize for application in encrypting messages. And the use of a Silk Handkerchief printed with columns of minute letters as basis for coding--after use of a column, the agent cut it off and immediately burned it; if the Germans managed to seize part of a handkerchief and used it to send false messages, the English could perceive the deception. Leo Marks had the voice and aura of a great actor, and indeed was the voice of the Devil in Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ. Associated with him are the film Carve Her Name With Pride (1958) and the book Between Silk and Cyanide (1998), both available from Amazon. Admittedly, all this is quite tangential to Peeping Tom, but makes the Supplement a gem in its own right.

27035,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,0780022629,J from NY,"[1, 1]","""Peeping Tom"" is one of the Criterion Collection's best kept secrets, it  seems--I can't remember the last time I saw a psychological study as refined, beautiful, and disturbing as this one.I'm not sure Michael Powell wanted to be ""subversive"" as one reviewer seems to think. Instead he created a groundbreaking study in voyeurism that doesn't allow any flimsy experimental ideas about what's going on: he implicates the whole of society and the viewer in this tragic tale of personal ruin, using the camera as a symbiotic vehicle of our ultimate culpability.Outwardly it is the tale of a youthful killer, Mark Lewis, an unnaturally intense ""photographer"" in his spare time and assistant director/cameramanin his daily life.  A pathetic neurotic to everyday appearances, Mark is a shy young man who practically lives in a screening room he has meticulously constructed in the backroom of his apartment.  The paradox of this bizarre character is so well done that we can't help but sympathize with him even while he claims victim after victim, recording their facial expressions as they die and adding each one to his ""documentary"".What sets Mark apart from other night prowling monsters is the obvious reason for his state of emotional derangement--his father, a pathological scientist who wanted to learn about the nerve reactions of little children to fear, taped him his entire childhood while putting him in the most frightening situations imaginable for someone of that age.  Dropping lizards on him as he slept, forcing him to view quite adult situations, etc.  The brief sequences in which Mark reveals these reels to a young woman who lives in his apartment are more disturbing than anything else in the movie.Mark takes his father's work one step farther.  Not only does he want to know about fear, he wants to film other human beings in the state in which they are most afraid: when they are just about to die.Powell doesn't let us off the hook here, however.  Mark is a man who wants help, a way out of the demented darkness his life has become, but his desire for redemption comes far too late.  Helen, a young woman with a worldly wise alcoholic mother, tries to pry Mark from the coffin of his apartment with some success; he enjoys a night out with her as any young man would, and she even manages to separate him from his camera.  The whole night, though, he can't stop gazing at people through windows and the brush of night.  The paradox of his character is absolutely believable and all the more heartwrenching for it.

Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[3, 3]","This Pre-Psycho British thriller (that was banned shortly after it's release and now seems quaint) operates on two different levels, and it deserves it's reputation.By today's standards it will be considered very tame, but it was groundbreaking in it's day. Like many Hitchcock films, we see the inner working and reasoning of a serial killer in such a way as to understand his motivations, and Carl Boehm gives an excellent and subtle personal portrayal of a soul tormented by his own desires.On the surface it is a creepy psychological drama - rather kitsch-y by now with the ""pin up girls"". But when you have Moira Shearer giving possibly her best performance, lively and humorous, as one of the murder victims, you have something special, and something deeper.  Anna Massey as the spinsterish girl who discovers it all is inspired casting.This film has a lot to say about the voyeurism and destruction that persists within the industry. About how the industry chews up young women to suit the various perversions of Directors and producers... the purveyors to the public; and how the sickness feeds on itself. Powell's brilliance was to include himself as the demon father in the ""home movie"" sequences of the child being psychologically abused that caused.It was ahead of it's time in anticipating how the pornography industry would infiltrate and become accepted within the mainstream media. (Think of the glossy gore movies being produced today by major studios.) It was also ahead of it's time in how ""documentary"" (think ""news reporting"") is used to excuse uninvolvement. ""I can only film the action,"" I'm not responsible for getting involved and stopping the horror I'm filming.This was also an extremely strong indictment of the idea of casting non-actors to achieve ""reality."" The rage of the new wave cinema of the time was to cast non-actors, and then put them in uncomfortable situations to try to evoke a ""real"" reaction from them. (Invariably what was - and still is - produced was fairly leaden performances of people who were uncomfortable being on film.) Powell's film uncannily makes the subtle point that a good actor can do a better job with half the effort. Of course all this enraged critics at the time. No one wants to be reminded they've been sold a bag of ""magic beans."" More shocking then was that it is also an indictment of how psychology - in studying human emotions as a subject - also alienates people from each other as ""objects of study"" instead of feeling for them and relating to them.

27040,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0780022629,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 12]","&quot;Peeping Tom&quot; is a film whose place in cinematic history cannot help but outweigh the critical value of the film itself.  When it was released in Great Britain in 1960 it was universally condemned by the critics and pulled from released the first week, effectively ending the career of director Michael Powell (&quot;I Know Where I'm Going,&quot; &quot;Black Narcissus,&quot; &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;).  &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; is about a young man who not only murders women, but who films them as he kills them.  What upset the critics was that Powell used the perspective of the camera to turn the viewing audience into voyeurs as well, and that he made the murderer into a sympathetic figure.Reducing &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; to the level of a slasher film misses the point, because this is much more of a psychological portrait of a troubled young man.  Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) works as an assistant cameraman at a film studio and has trouble appreciating the difference between the real world and what he sees through the lens of a camera.  Mark has another job, taking &quot;views&quot; of half naked women for the owner of the local news agent shope (Bartlett Mullins) to sell discretely to his customers.  But Mark's voyeurism is ultimately not about sex, but rather about fear: provoking it and recording it.  As Mark slowly opens up to Helen (Anna Massey), the girl who lives downstairs in his building who shows an interest in his work, we learn that his father was a psychologist who filmed his son in a series of disquieting experiments into the nature of fear.  The boy is following in daddy's footsteps.  Powell and screenwriter Leo Marks had wanted to do a film about the work of Sigmund Freud, but John Huston was working on &quot;Freud&quot; in Hollywood, so Marks suggest a story about a voyeuristic murderer as an alternative psychological thriller.  Ultimately, the psychological dimensions of &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; outweigh the thriller elements and are what make this a noteworthy film.&quot;Peeping Tom&quot; came out before &quot;Psycho,&quot; and the comparisons are inevitable, although they seem as much the work of different times as of different directors.  Part of it is that Powell is working in technicolor, with rich colors which work against the horror elements in the film.  But we also have to take into account that Powell is not dealing with suspense as a key part of the equation and that there is nothing in &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; anywhere near the level of the shower scene in &quot;Psycho.&quot;  The key scene is the opening sequences, where we see Mark approach a prostitute on the street, his camera becomes the point of view for the audience, and we see the terror on this face of his first victim before she dies.  Then, during the opening credits, we see Mark watching the film he has just shot.  The film's opening sets up the rules for the game in this film and no doubt outraged the London film credits before the director's name appeared (shown over Mark's projector no less).  Add to this the fact that Powell and his son played Mark's father and Mark as a child, and that probably outraged them more than the half naked women lounging around in display positions.  Powell's leading man was the son of a noted Austrian conductor and Boehm's slight German accent probably afforded the critics the small confort that this twisted individual was not a proper English lad.Since this is a Criterion Collection DVD the presentation of the film is done right, with a commentary track by film theorist Laura Mulvey who combines criticism of the film with the history of the film, cast, and crew.  Serious film students will enjoy her insights and her comprehensive critique of the film as a true commentary on &quot;Peeping Tom,&quot; and not the gay banter of actors and crew trying to come up with things to say that are so disappointing on so many commentary tracks. There is a theatrical trailer, whose tenor seems quite at odds with the film itself, a gallery of production stills, and a Channel 4 U.K. documentary &quot;A Very British Psycho,&quot; which relates the controversy of the film and interviews screenwriter Leo Marks and the critics who bashed the film on its release in 1962.  You cannot help but feel that while it was Michael Powell's directing career that was ended up this film, it was Marks who should have suffered more as the writer is at least as disturbing a personality as his fictional creation in the film.",5,Michael Powell crosses over the line with &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,4497,"['quot', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'quot', 'film', 'place', 'cinematic', 'history', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'outweigh', 'critical', 'value', 'film', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'Great', 'Britain', '1960', 'was', 'universally', 'condemned', 'critics', 'pulled', 'released', 'first', 'week', 'effectively', 'ending', 'career', 'director', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'quot', 'Know', 'Where', ""'m"", 'Going', 'quot', 'quot', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'quot', 'quot', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'quot', 'quot', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'quot', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'murders', 'women', 'who', 'films', 'What', 'upset', 'critics', 'was', 'Powell', 'used', 'perspective', 'camera', 'turn', 'viewing', 'audience', 'voyeurs', 'as', 'well', 'made', 'murderer', 'sympathetic', 'figure.Reducing', 'quot', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'quot', 'level', 'slasher', 'film', 'point', 'much', 'more', 'psychological', 'portrait', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'Mark', 'Lewis', 'Carl', 'Boehm', 'assistant', 'cameraman', 'film', 'studio', 'trouble', 'appreciating', 'difference', 'real', 'world', 'what', 'lens', 'camera', 'Mark', 'job', 'taking', 'quot', 'views', 'quot', 'half', 'naked', 'women', 'owner', 'local', 'news', 'agent', 'shope', 'Bartlett', 'Mullins', 'sell', 'discretely', 'customers', 'Mark', 'voyeurism', 'ultimately', 'not', 'sex', 'rather', 'fear', 'provoking', 'recording', 'Mark', 'slowly', 'up', 'Helen', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'girl', 'who', 'downstairs', 'building', 'who', 'interest', 'work', 'learn', 'father', 'was', 'psychologist', 'who', 'filmed', 'son', 'series', 'disquieting', 'experiments', 'nature', 'fear', 'boy', 'following', 'daddy', 'footsteps', 'Powell', 'screenwriter', 'Leo', 'Marks', 'had', 'wanted', 'do', 'film', 'work', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'John', 'Huston', 'was', 'working', 'quot', 'Freud', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'Marks', 'suggest', 'story', 'voyeuristic', 'murderer', 'alternative', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Ultimately', 'psychological', 'dimensions', 'quot', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'quot', 'thriller', 'elements', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'noteworthy', 'film.', 'quot', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'quot', 'came', 'out', 'quot', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'comparisons', 'are', 'inevitable', 'seem', 'as', 'much', 'work', 'different', 'times', 'different', 'directors', 'Part', 'Powell', 'working', 'technicolor', 'rich', 'colors', 'work', 'horror', 'elements', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'take', 'account', 'Powell', 'not', 'dealing', 'suspense', 'key', 'part', 'equation', 'nothing', 'quot', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'quot', 'anywhere', 'level', 'shower', 'scene', 'quot', 'Psycho.', 'quot', 'key', 'scene', 'opening', 'sequences', 'where', 'see', 'Mark', 'approach', 'prostitute', 'street', 'camera', 'point', 'view', 'audience', 'see', 'terror', 'face', 'first', 'victim', 'Then', 'opening', 'credits', 'see', 'Mark', 'watching', 'film', 'just', 'shot', 'film', 'opening', 'up', 'rules', 'game', 'film', 'doubt', 'outraged', 'London', 'film', 'credits', 'director', 'name', 'appeared', 'shown', 'Mark', 'projector', 'no', 'less', 'Add', 'fact', 'Powell', 'son', 'played', 'Mark', 'father', 'Mark', 'child', 'probably', 'outraged', 'more', 'half', 'naked', 'women', 'lounging', 'around', 'display', 'positions', 'Powell', 'leading', 'man', 'was', 'son', 'noted', 'Austrian', 'conductor', 'Boehm', 'slight', 'German', 'accent', 'probably', 'afforded', 'critics', 'small', 'confort', 'twisted', 'individual', 'was', 'not', 'proper', 'English', 'lad.Since', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'film', 'done', 'right', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'theorist', 'Laura', 'Mulvey', 'who', 'criticism', 'film', 'history', 'film', 'cast', 'crew', 'Serious', 'film', 'students', 'will', 'enjoy', 'insights', 'comprehensive', 'critique', 'film', 'true', 'commentary', 'quot', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'quot', 'not', 'gay', 'banter', 'actors', 'crew', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'things', 'say', 'are', 'so', 'disappointing', 'so', 'many', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'tenor', 'quite', 'odds', 'film', 'gallery', 'production', 'stills', 'Channel', '4', 'U.K.', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Very', 'British', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'controversy', 'film', 'interviews', 'screenwriter', 'Leo', 'Marks', 'critics', 'who', 'bashed', 'film', 'release', '1962', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'was', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'directing', 'career', 'was', 'ended', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'Marks', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'suffered', 'more', 'writer', 'least', 'disturbing', 'personality', 'fictional', 'creation', 'film']",N/A

Admirers of Hitchcock, especially of his &quot;Psycho&quot; (released later  the same year, 1960) will find many points of comparison.At the risk of  seeming overly enthusiastic, I will say that the Criterion DVD issue of  Peeping Tom is one of the finest, most satisfying video issues I have ever  come across. Every aspect of this release is absolutely top-drawer. The  film transfer is beautifully clear and looks almost new. In terms of audio  the disc is also quite impressive with none of the tinny quality that some  older films have. As for extras, this release is a total knockout: the  audio commentary by critic Laura Mulvey is detailed and easy to follow; the  50-minute documentary &quot;A Very British Psycho&quot; is so fascinating  it can't really be summed up here; and the original British trailer is a  really worthwhile bonus. &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; should be required viewing  for all interested in the possibilities of this art form.",5,&quot;Watch Out!

They weren't ready for his view of voyuerism and the cinema. The film itself is a fine and daring piece of work detailing the obsession and madness of a young photographer who was horrendously traumatized as a child by his equally obsessed father. Mark (Karl Boehm) murders women with the tripod of his camera as he films their faces as they are dying. He then views the footage in private for self gratification. He's literally making his own ""pornography"". Whew. Not an easy subject matter for 1960! But what the film says to me is that we are ALL voyeurs because we watch cinema for different reasons. Some are sicker than others. This movie is a heavy statement by a renowned filmmaker who literally put his career on the line to make it. He lost. But today, the film survives as a testament to Powell's viewpoint and ideas. And we are the richer for it. ""Peeping Tom"" is still not for every taste primarily because I don't feel very many people can understand what is being said by the movie. For those who do get it , it is a rare treat indeed.

27051,A3UA40JOD3BE1M,0780022629,"Paul Fogarty ""Hopeless film addict!""","[10, 12]","I first saw this film back in the 80's on British television, and was completely unaware of its history and background. I found it a very striking film, which explores - using the device of a serial killer photographer - the voyeur that is, to some extent, in all of us.The film is difficult to categorize; thriller, drama, psychological horror, romance... to some extent it's all of the above, but I guess I'd say it's closest to a psychological horror/thriller film. But be warned, you'll find no unstoppable cyborg killers, no chainsaw wielding crazies, no killer aliens bleeding acid, or teenagers being sliced `n' diced ad nauseum; if that's what you want, there're endless films, both good and bad, that will do the job. No, ""Peeping Tom"" deals with the desperate, abject ""horror,"" that is born of a tortured human soul.The film certainly doesn't hang around, and gets right down to business from the opening scene, which has the main character, a film technician named Mark Lewis, played by Karlheinz (Carl) Bohm, stalking and killing his first victim, one of London's many ""streetwalkers."" This opening scene sets the tone for most of the rest of the film, a feeling of seedy desperation.Mark keeps it together in his everyday life, but he is horribly psychologically damaged by the ""research"" his father, a famed doctor of psychology, carried out on him as a child, and desperately driven to act out his own twisted revenge on those around him. Mark's father was researching the effects of fear on the human psyche, and used his own son as a clinical guinea pig throughout his childhood; now the child is grown, and driven by his own internal demons to complete his fathers work.But Mark wants to take his fathers work one step forward, not only is he obsessed with `fear', but he is consumed with the idea of ""seeing"" it, of ""capturing"" the face of fear with his camera, as if somehow that will bring him the ultimate understanding. And so it is that he sets out to murder Women, and films their last moments as he does so, creating his own ""snuff movies,"" that he watches over and over again in his darkened apartment, desperately looking for something that only he can see.And while he's not working in a film studio, Mark earns a little extra on the side by shooting porno pics in a room over a newsagents! This actually leads to what is probably the only deliberately comical scene in the whole film, when Mark reports for `work' one evening, only to find an elderly gentleman in the shop perusing the special ""views"" that are for sale, ""under the counter."" There is a second scene in the film that raises a wry grin; Mark is in the street filming the police investigating his murder of the prostitute. A man walks up to him, and assuming he's a reporter, asks him what paper he works for, ""Oh, The Observer,"" Mark replies with a knowing smile.But Mark's life is not all horror and desperation; into it comes love and happiness in the shape of a girl, Helen Stevens, played by Anna Massey, who lives downstairs in his building. Helen is an ingenue, an innocent, in every sense of the word. She lives with her blind mother, and is as far removed from Mark's worlds, both his professional one at the studio and the porn operation ""after hours,"" and his internal nightmare existence, as it is possible to be.He opens up to her, and in a moment of trust, of empathy, shares with her a glimpse of his tortured childhood, by showing her some the film his father took of HIM, while he carried out his research! How can Mark reconcile these two worlds? Will he choose to live in the light with Helen, or will he be cast into horrifying darkness and damnation by his internal demons, driven to take ever greater risks in his quest to ""see"" what he so desperately needs to see; will Helen herself, or her mother, be sacrificed to this end?!Karlheinz Bohm's performance as Mark is wonderful; he's a monster, he was MADE a monster by his own father, he knows it, but he's a monster all the same, only, he doesn't WANT to be a monster! And herein lies the ""problem"" with ""Peeping Tom;"" Mark is an incredibly sympathetic character! We the audience are aware of all this, and yet we want Mark to change, to be happy with Helen, to help her with the children's book she's writing, but he's a killer of Women, and worse, he's driven to kill time and time again. There's a scene where he `toys' with one of his victims on a studio soundstage that reminded me of the way a cat will `play' with a bird or mouse before moving in for the kill. An incredible, cold-blooded performance by Bohm.It's difficult, if not impossible, to view the film NOW, with the sensibilities of those who watched when it came out in the early 60's. The film opened to a roaring, and unanimous, tide of disgust and revulsion on the part of the London critics, and was pulled from the cinema circuit within a week of its release. One of the worst reviews went as follows; ""The only really satisfactory way to dispose of ""Peeping Tom"" would be to shovel up and flush it swiftly down the nearest sewer. Even then the stench would remain!""The film was ""lost"" for nearly 20 years, before being rediscovered by the likes of Martin Scorsese. This is still a somewhat uncomfortable film to watch, and the last 10 minutes or so, when Mark realizes the game is up, have lost none of their power to chill.",5,A VERY British psycho

27052,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,0780022629,Pork Chop,"[1, 2]","Peeping Tom (1960), is a unique movie, almost some extraordinary,in the sense of touching upon subjects that at first glance wouldhave only a somewhat limited commercial potential. This workrecalls Reed Haddly of Racket Squad, for example, as it takesviewers into a realm of the underground, psychosis of killershandled by the Homicide Division officersThe many aspects of this movie, with the tightly controlled messagefrom start to finish, suggests an ample financing and time ingetting the project done, as well as a carefully selection of theactors. It also shows a confidence in the economic outcome of thefilm, or impervious to public blowback, from the controversialstory. Those involved are keenly perfectionist throughout, such asin the script, the timeless, modern  Miles Davis-like Jazz, or ErikSatie-like piano pieces,  the image quality, editing, etc.Karlheinz Bohm plays a film studio professional, who is followingin the footsteps of his scientist father (also a cinematographer),who investigated and published famous findings on ""fear"".

Others are the law, the vulnerable girls in movie shootsand camera sessions, etc.The psychosis demonstrated by Bohm, runs parallel to an introvertedshy, awkward personality, as he fears social situation involvingstrangers, a break in his routines, not carrying in a camera eachand every moment of the day, etc.There's also perhaps a definitive critique of the very wealthyclass in Britain, of which Bohm is a part, and those partaking inmovies, from lack of moral / character.

27055,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0780022629,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 12]","Peeping Tom (Michael Powell, 1960)A Very British Psycho, BBC4's amusing documentary about Peeping Tom and its writer, Leo Marks, says that Peeping Tom is the film that got Michael Powell barred from the British cinema, sent him into exile in Australia, and destroyed his career. It's not quite as bad as all that; Powell did return to make another British film (The Boy Who Turned Yellow), and his interesting 1937 docudrama The Edge of the World was updated and re-released in Britain in 1978. He also ended his life on British soil in 1990, dying of cancer. In the interim, though, he made some wonderful Australian films that were, in general, well-received (of these, American audiences are probably best familiar with The Age of Consent, starring James Mason and a young, tantalizing Helen Mirren).It is impossible, writing in 2003, to go back to 1960 and understand the effect Peeping Tom had on the British film world. Released four months before the similarly-themed American film Psycho, Peeping Tom, already cut, was pulled from theaters less than a week after its release, and remained banned for another thirty years; ironically, the version released after the lifting of the ban (theatrical premiere 16 September 1994) was uncut. To stay banned for thirty years, especially in the wake of Psycho (now considered an American classic), there has to be something pretty distressing going on.There are, in fact, two things going on that are the likely causes of the distress: Pamela Green's nude scene (according to Green in the aforementioned documentary, the first in British film history on the big screen), and the sympathetic portrayal of the main character. Either alone, and it might have slipped past the censors; the combination was enough to get it yanked.Peeping Tom is the story of Mark Lewis (German Academy Award winner for Lifetime Achievement Karlheinz Bohm), a serial killer whose particular quirk is filming the deaths of his victims and rewatching them over and over in his home theater. He works for a film studio as an assistant cameraman, but is truly of the once-idle rich; his inheritance is mostly gone, and he makes much of his money renting out rooms in the erstwhile mansion of his parents. After a chance meeting, he begins a tentative relationship with one of his tenants, Helen Stephens (Anna Massey, recently seen in The Importance of Being Earnest and Possession). Lewis struggles to keep his relationship with Helen normal while still indulging the seamier side of his nature, with the expected consequences.Lewis is a far more sympathetic character than ever was Norman Bates, and thus in many ways Peeping Tom is a superior film to Psycho in its depth of character. In every other way, however, Psycho's British older brother falls short. The cinematography, the music, the building of suspense, all are realms where Hitchcock had worlds of experience, while Powell had relatively little; Powell was in his element with the drama, rather than the thriller. And presented as a drama. with Lewis' inner struggle the center of the action, this might well have made a lot more 100-best lists than it did. It makes a few too many bows to the lurid side, however, and most of them seem somewhat gratuitous. he mystery angle, too, seems a bit overdone; it's as if the writers decided that a mystery had to be worked into the plot, and ""ow can we handle this so it seems as if James M. Cain wrote it?""Still, a must-see film for those interested in the history of the thriller. Criterion's DVD leaves a little something to be desired in the sound transfer (especially at the beginning), but the picture quality is unmatched in a film with this many years on its back. And if you can transport yourself back to 1960, in those few months between the release of Peeping Tom and your first viewing of Psycho, you might even get the intended effect. ***",3,"It's good... overhyped, but good.",1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,3884,"['Peeping', 'Tom', 'Michael', 'Powell', '1960', 'Very', 'British', 'Psycho', 'BBC4', 'amusing', 'documentary', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'writer', 'Leo', 'Marks', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'film', 'got', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'barred', 'British', 'cinema', 'sent', 'exile', 'Australia', 'destroyed', 'career', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'Powell', 'did', 'return', 'make', 'British', 'film', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Turned', 'Yellow', 'interesting', '1937', 'Edge', 'World', 'was', 'updated', 're-released', 'Britain', '1978', 'also', 'ended', 'life', 'British', 'soil', '1990', 'dying', 'cancer', 'interim', 'though', 'made', 'wonderful', 'Australian', 'films', 'were', 'general', 'well-received', 'American', 'audiences', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'familiar', 'Age', 'Consent', 'starring', 'James', 'Mason', 'young', 'tantalizing', 'Helen', 'Mirren', '.It', 'impossible', 'writing', '2003', 'go', 'back', '1960', 'understand', 'effect', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'had', 'British', 'film', 'world', 'Released', 'four', 'months', 'similarly-themed', 'American', 'film', 'Psycho', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'already', 'cut', 'was', 'pulled', 'theaters', 'less', 'week', 'release', 'remained', 'banned', 'thirty', 'years', 'ironically', 'version', 'released', 'lifting', 'ban', 'theatrical', 'premiere', '16', 'September', '1994', 'was', 'uncut', 'stay', 'banned', 'thirty', 'years', 'especially', 'wake', 'Psycho', 'now', 'considered', 'American', 'classic', 'be', 'something', 'pretty', 'distressing', 'going', 'on.There', 'are', 'fact', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'are', 'likely', 'causes', 'distress', 'Pamela', 'Green', 'nude', 'scene', 'according', 'Green', 'aforementioned', 'documentary', 'first', 'British', 'film', 'history', 'big', 'screen', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'main', 'character', 'alone', 'might', 'have', 'slipped', 'censors', 'combination', 'was', 'enough', 'get', 'yanked.Peeping', 'Tom', 'story', 'Mark', 'Lewis', 'German', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Lifetime', 'Achievement', 'Karlheinz', 'Bohm', 'serial', 'killer', 'particular', 'quirk', 'filming', 'deaths', 'victims', 'rewatching', 'home', 'theater', 'film', 'studio', 'assistant', 'cameraman', 'truly', 'once-idle', 'rich', 'inheritance', 'mostly', 'gone', 'much', 'money', 'renting', 'out', 'rooms', 'erstwhile', 'mansion', 'parents', 'chance', 'meeting', 'tentative', 'relationship', 'one', 'tenants', 'Helen', 'Stephens', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'recently', 'seen', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'Possession', 'Lewis', 'keep', 'relationship', 'Helen', 'normal', 'still', 'indulging', 'seamier', 'side', 'nature', 'expected', 'consequences.Lewis', 'far', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'ever', 'was', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'thus', 'many', 'ways', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'superior', 'film', 'Psycho', 'depth', 'character', 'other', 'way', 'however', 'Psycho', 'British', 'older', 'brother', 'short', 'cinematography', 'music', 'building', 'suspense', 'are', 'realms', 'where', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'worlds', 'experience', 'Powell', 'had', 'relatively', 'little', 'Powell', 'was', 'element', 'drama', 'rather', 'thriller', 'presented', 'drama', 'Lewis', 'inner', 'struggle', 'center', 'action', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'made', 'lot', 'more', '100-best', 'lists', 'did', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'bows', 'lurid', 'side', 'however', 'most', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'gratuitous', 'mystery', 'angle', 'too', 'bit', 'overdone', 'writers', 'decided', 'mystery', 'had', 'be', 'worked', 'plot', 'ow', 'can', 'handle', 'James', 'M.', 'Cain', 'wrote', 'Still', 'must-see', 'film', 'interested', 'history', 'thriller', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'little', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'sound', 'transfer', 'especially', 'beginning', 'picture', 'quality', 'unmatched', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'back', 'can', 'transport', 'back', '1960', 'few', 'months', 'release', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'first', 'viewing', 'Psycho', 'might', 'even', 'get', 'intended', 'effect', '***']",N/A
27056,A16QODENBJVUI1,0780022629,Robert Moore,"[4, 7]","PEEPING TOM famously was condemned upon its release in 1960, and has seen ascended to the position of cult favorite. It is the last of Powell's major films that I have seen, and I must say that in comparison with his other films, this does not come off very well. My opinion is that it is a film that was underrated when it came out, but quite overrated by many film viewers today.I think there are three reasons for the film's undeserved high evaluation today. First, many film viewers are aware that people like Martin Scorsese have heaped lavish praise on it, which I believe cows many into evaluating it more highly than they might otherwise be inclined. If you are expecting a minor masterpiece, you will be inclined to see it. Second, some viewers knowing how lowly the film was esteemed when it came out are pleased to see that it is not an awful film, as indeed it is not. Third, many people compare it to Hitchcock's FRENZY, which I believe lends it an aura that it might not otherwise have obtained completely on its own.I believe this is a decent film, even if Powell's weakest major film. The comparison with FRENZY is both unfair and unenlightening. Virtually none of the most astounding elements of FRENZY appear in PEEPING TOM. On the other hand, the most conspicuous elements of PEEPING TOM appear in other Hitchcock films, but not FRENZY. Many of Hitchcock's films deal with voyeurism, but FRENZY is not one of them. Also, PEEPING TOM lacks all of the astonishingly moments of suspense that graces FRENZY, as well as the many moments of extraordinary humor.Carl Boehm, who is the son of the great German conductor Karl Boehm, does a good job in this film, but I wonder a bit about his having been cast. He is supposed to play a boy raised in England by English parents, but throughout the film he displays a marked German accent. More troubling is the fact that his psychological history is handled in a fashion even murkier than usual in films of past decades, though in fairness to Powell it is no worse than psychological explanations in Hitchcock films, which despite his undoubted genius as a filmmaker were always the greatest weak moments in his films.Worse of all, I didn't find any part of this film to be especially compelling. Interesting, yes, but compelling, no. At no point did it grip me, and many scenes seemed either contrived or trite. Powell also lacks the ability that Hitchcock possessed in such abundance to portray convincingly pathological obsession. Most such elements in this film were mentioned rather than displayed.One interesting casting quiddity was the presence of Miles Malleson and Anna Massey in the same film. One of the lesser romances in THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST is that between Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble. Interestingly, Malleson (who played the part of a purchaser of dirty photos early in the film) played Chasuble and Massey (who played Boehm's downstairs neighbor) played Prism in the 1952 and 2002 filmed versions of the play respectively.I do urge those interested in the career of Michael Powell to see this film, but I would also suggest that this is hardly the masterpiece that many assert it to be. It is a moderately interesting film with some strong performances told with less than Powell's usual flair. Hopefully in the future we will see a more balanced assessment of this film than dominates today.",4,A fascinating but flawed film by a marvelous director,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,3378,"['PEEPING', 'TOM', 'famously', 'was', 'condemned', 'release', '1960', 'seen', 'ascended', 'position', 'cult', 'favorite', 'last', 'Powell', 'major', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'must', 'say', 'comparison', 'other', 'films', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'opinion', 'film', 'was', 'underrated', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'quite', 'overrated', 'many', 'film', 'viewers', 'today.I', 'think', 'are', 'three', 'reasons', 'film', 'undeserved', 'high', 'evaluation', 'today', 'First', 'many', 'film', 'viewers', 'are', 'aware', 'people', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'have', 'heaped', 'lavish', 'praise', 'believe', 'many', 'evaluating', 'more', 'highly', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'inclined', 'are', 'expecting', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'be', 'inclined', 'see', 'Second', 'viewers', 'knowing', 'how', 'lowly', 'film', 'was', 'esteemed', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'are', 'pleased', 'see', 'not', 'awful', 'film', 'indeed', 'not', 'Third', 'many', 'people', 'compare', 'Hitchcock', 'FRENZY', 'believe', 'aura', 'might', 'not', 'otherwise', 'have', 'obtained', 'completely', 'own.I', 'believe', 'decent', 'film', 'even', 'Powell', 'weakest', 'major', 'film', 'comparison', 'FRENZY', 'unfair', 'unenlightening', 'Virtually', 'none', 'most', 'astounding', 'elements', 'FRENZY', 'appear', 'PEEPING', 'TOM', 'other', 'hand', 'most', 'conspicuous', 'elements', 'PEEPING', 'TOM', 'appear', 'other', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'not', 'FRENZY', 'Many', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'deal', 'voyeurism', 'FRENZY', 'not', 'one', 'Also', 'PEEPING', 'TOM', 'astonishingly', 'moments', 'suspense', 'FRENZY', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'moments', 'extraordinary', 'humor.Carl', 'Boehm', 'who', 'son', 'great', 'German', 'conductor', 'Karl', 'Boehm', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'wonder', 'bit', 'having', 'been', 'cast', 'supposed', 'play', 'boy', 'raised', 'England', 'English', 'parents', 'film', 'marked', 'German', 'accent', 'More', 'troubling', 'fact', 'psychological', 'history', 'handled', 'fashion', 'even', 'murkier', 'usual', 'films', 'past', 'decades', 'fairness', 'Powell', 'worse', 'psychological', 'explanations', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'undoubted', 'genius', 'filmmaker', 'were', 'always', 'greatest', 'weak', 'moments', 'films.Worse', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'part', 'film', 'be', 'especially', 'compelling', 'Interesting', 'yes', 'compelling', 'point', 'did', 'grip', 'many', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'trite', 'Powell', 'also', 'ability', 'Hitchcock', 'possessed', 'such', 'abundance', 'portray', 'convincingly', 'pathological', 'obsession', 'Most', 'such', 'elements', 'film', 'were', 'mentioned', 'rather', 'displayed.One', 'interesting', 'casting', 'quiddity', 'was', 'presence', 'Miles', 'Malleson', 'Anna', 'Massey', 'same', 'film', 'One', 'lesser', 'romances', 'IMPORTANCE', 'OF', 'BEING', 'EARNEST', 'Miss', 'Prism', 'Dr.', 'Chasuble', 'Interestingly', 'Malleson', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'purchaser', 'dirty', 'photos', 'early', 'film', 'played', 'Chasuble', 'Massey', 'who', 'played', 'Boehm', 'downstairs', 'neighbor', 'played', 'Prism', '1952', '2002', 'filmed', 'versions', 'play', 'respectively.I', 'do', 'urge', 'interested', 'career', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'see', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'suggest', 'hardly', 'masterpiece', 'many', 'assert', 'be', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'film', 'strong', 'performances', 'told', 'less', 'Powell', 'usual', 'flair', 'Hopefully', 'future', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'balanced', 'assessment', 'film', 'dominates', 'today']",N/A

27058,A1J1163Q56YIVZ,0780022629,Shaun Anderson,"[0, 1]","Peeping Tom's impact remains resolutely undiminished in the 47 years that has seen it go from reviled and despised horror film, to a classic of British cinema. Those 47 years have seen the rise and fall of many extreme examples of the horror genre (Italian giallo, slasher films, video nasties, Manga inspired mayhem and much more), but Peeping Tom remains persistently one of the most disturbing and disconcerting screen experiences, that puts a great deal of more visceral horror to shame. Michael Powell's film explores voyeurism, scopophilia, child abuse and the rise of psychology to damning effect. But perhaps most damning is Mr. Powell's assessment of the impact of cinema on spectators. Throughout Powell connects the act of spectatorship with the psychotic Mark Lewis, the camera becomes a phallic object to stroke and kiss the devices of cinema a fetish. As a result we are drawn into an uncomfortable association with the screen psychopath, as we vicariously join him in his personal screening room. The only person immune to this is a blind woman, simply because her ability to look has been removed. The look of the camera is associated with violence and perversity, and the only remedy against it is to close ones eyes or look away. That we continually open our eyes and eagerly follow Mark's descent into insanity, illustrates perfectly the power of Michael Powell's film. Furthermore Powell de-eroticises almost every aspect of the film; grim, seamy, dirty streets, crone like hookers, and perverted old men buying porn. This makes the conventional interpretation of the film as enforcing patriarchy and masculinity something that is disputable.

27060,A2R70Z8WQ8BZNB,0780022629,"TANTRUM!!!! ""...no longer Maria!""","[6, 8]","Voyeurism, violence, perversion, and dark forbidden sexual desire. Michael Powell's most controversial, important  and artistic achievement, also destroyed his carrer after the ferocious and merciless critics for this at-the-time outrageous, unbeliavable and shocking classic about the meditation and observation of murder and depraved cruelty.Mark (Karl heinz) was profoundly affected by his father's creepy experiments, a psychologist who kept a video journal  about his son's personal life and raw childhood fears, and that demential intrusion turned him not only in an apparently shy photographer himself, but in a violent, sexual-deviate, and menacing stone cold killer. Over the very afflictions that marked his life and as an traumatic extension of his father's visual research, he found over his work the way to satisfy his murderous and gruesome sexual appetites, in the most terrible but passionate way: To torture and murder women with the sharpened leg of a camera's tripod, while capturing the whole sequence on film. After the killing in front of the camera, he runs the films for his private pleasure, to explore and study the victim's agonizing expresions and reactions towards fear and death.This macabre and unseen concept broke the stereotypes about permited reality on cinema, by creating a disturbing and horrific portrayal of a derranged film fan, on film. Without delivering excessive gore or even fear, the explicit and graphic aproach to murder and the dark atmosphere about madness and psychological mental trauma, were more than enough to raise hell back at the year 1960, while Alfred Hitchcock actually shocked the world of cinema with his mind-bending and creepy classic ""Psycho"". After destroying Powell's reputation, ""Peeping Tom"" eventually became a cult classic of the thriller genre, overthrowing standard after standard about any possible concept in post-noir cult-disturbing films.As we witness the sickening and torturous obsession throught the viewfinder of Mark's camera, as we are forced to watch the pain and despair of the women throught Michael Powell's eyes, we slowly realize that it is we who feel uncumbfortable: When mark projects on screen the silent and savage murders, we find an unpleasant projection of ourselves, the appeal of the voyeurist pleasure to other people's pain, regardless of the degree of fantasy implied in cinema itself. We become silent accomplices as we observe Mark's erotic pleasures becoming the ugly side of the filmgoing experience and on-screen display of everyday's suffering. Powell drives us in depth, into the very essence of the darkest side of human behaviour, by indicating the complicity of the audiences over mark's atrocities.Recomended, ultimate dark masterpiece in psychological thriller, the mind-bending but non-judgemental style of Powell's work is devastating. The haunted-by-the-past character of Mark, must be one of the most disturbing and psychotic portrayals of a lonely and traumatized sad killer. The audacious  fetishistic voyeurism implied of the story, will reveal the very dark side of your soul, something that not even the less-daring milestone ""Psycho"" was capable of achieve. The documented emotional conditions of the  twisted psyche or Mark  are waiting for your presence: Come, the show's about to start....",5,Frank and Uncomfortable masterpiece in psychological thriller's history.,1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,3319,"['Voyeurism', 'violence', 'perversion', 'dark', 'forbidden', 'sexual', 'desire', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'most', 'controversial', 'important', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'also', 'destroyed', 'carrer', 'ferocious', 'merciless', 'critics', 'at-the-time', 'outrageous', 'unbeliavable', 'shocking', 'classic', 'meditation', 'observation', 'murder', 'depraved', 'cruelty.Mark', 'Karl', 'heinz', 'was', 'profoundly', 'affected', 'father', 'creepy', 'experiments', 'psychologist', 'who', 'kept', 'video', 'journal', 'son', 'personal', 'life', 'raw', 'childhood', 'fears', 'demential', 'intrusion', 'turned', 'not', 'only', 'apparently', 'shy', 'photographer', 'violent', 'sexual-deviate', 'menacing', 'stone', 'cold', 'killer', 'very', 'afflictions', 'marked', 'life', 'traumatic', 'extension', 'father', 'visual', 'research', 'found', 'work', 'way', 'satisfy', 'murderous', 'gruesome', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'most', 'terrible', 'passionate', 'way', 'torture', 'murder', 'women', 'sharpened', 'leg', 'camera', 'tripod', 'capturing', 'whole', 'sequence', 'film', 'killing', 'front', 'camera', 'films', 'private', 'pleasure', 'explore', 'study', 'victim', 'agonizing', 'expresions', 'reactions', 'towards', 'fear', 'death.This', 'macabre', 'unseen', 'concept', 'broke', 'stereotypes', 'permited', 'reality', 'cinema', 'creating', 'disturbing', 'horrific', 'portrayal', 'derranged', 'film', 'fan', 'film', 'delivering', 'excessive', 'gore', 'even', 'fear', 'explicit', 'graphic', 'aproach', 'murder', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'madness', 'psychological', 'mental', 'trauma', 'were', 'more', 'enough', 'raise', 'hell', 'back', 'year', '1960', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'actually', 'shocked', 'world', 'cinema', 'mind-bending', 'creepy', 'classic', 'Psycho', 'destroying', 'Powell', 'reputation', 'Peeping', 'Tom', 'eventually', 'became', 'cult', 'classic', 'thriller', 'genre', 'overthrowing', 'standard', 'standard', 'possible', 'concept', 'post-noir', 'cult-disturbing', 'films.As', 'witness', 'sickening', 'torturous', 'obsession', 'throught', 'viewfinder', 'Mark', 'camera', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'pain', 'despair', 'women', 'throught', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'eyes', 'slowly', 'realize', 'who', 'feel', 'uncumbfortable', 'When', 'mark', 'projects', 'screen', 'silent', 'savage', 'murders', 'find', 'unpleasant', 'projection', 'ourselves', 'appeal', 'voyeurist', 'pleasure', 'other', 'people', 'pain', 'regardless', 'degree', 'fantasy', 'implied', 'cinema', 'become', 'silent', 'accomplices', 'observe', 'Mark', 'erotic', 'pleasures', 'becoming', 'ugly', 'side', 'filmgoing', 'experience', 'on-screen', 'display', 'everyday', 'suffering', 'Powell', 'depth', 'very', 'essence', 'darkest', 'side', 'human', 'behaviour', 'indicating', 'complicity', 'audiences', 'mark', 'atrocities.Recomended', 'ultimate', 'dark', 'masterpiece', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'mind-bending', 'non-judgemental', 'style', 'Powell', 'work', 'devastating', 'haunted-by-the-past', 'character', 'Mark', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'psychotic', 'portrayals', 'lonely', 'traumatized', 'sad', 'killer', 'audacious', 'fetishistic', 'voyeurism', 'implied', 'story', 'will', 'reveal', 'very', 'dark', 'side', 'soul', 'something', 'not', 'even', 'less-daring', 'milestone', 'Psycho', 'was', 'capable', 'achieve', 'documented', 'emotional', 'conditions', 'twisted', 'psyche', 'Mark', 'are', 'waiting', 'presence', 'Come', 'show', 'start']",N/A

27062,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0780022629,trebe,"[1, 1]","A groundbreaking suspense thriller with a colorful history, Peeping Tom (1960) receives a well deserved ""rebirth"" in this Criterion Collection release.  Reviled by critics at the time, the film had kind of sunk into obscurity over the years, so the availability of a new widescreen transfer of the film, which predates Hitchcock'sPsycho(1960) in the slasher timeline, should be welcome news to horror fans.Set in England, Peeping Tom isn't about a simple pervert who surreptitiously spies on women through windows, or a hole in the wall.  Instead the film is a more complicated and intriguing psychological drama, that is centered on a man who seeks to capture the final moments of life on film.  This rather macabre subject, earned the film a reputation as one of the first ""snuff"" films, and its poor reception and the subsequent backlash, led to the demise of director Michael Powell's career.  (Major spoilers follow)The opening of the film features some POV shots of a lady of the night taking a client into her room, where she is taken by surprise, and murdered on her bed.  The killer is Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm), a very troubled man who is determined to capture on film, the expression of pure terror in the final moments of life, as a person witnesses their own violent death.  To this end, he has made some diabolically clever modifications to his 16mm camera rig, which almost always carries with him, to capture whatever catches his eye.Lewis' identity as the killer is soon confirmed, and the focus on him becomes more intense, as the details about his activities are slowly revealed.  Besides being a brutal murderer, Lewis seems to live a rather interesting life.  His primary job is as a camera focus puller, at a movie studio.  Lewis also works at a magazine shop, which has a photo studio upstairs, where he photographs models in sexy attire.Lewis owns a large two storey walkup, and lives on the second floor.  He has a workroom, where he develops his films and views his movies.  The house is his childhood home, inherited from his father.  The spaces downstairs are rent out to tenants.  When Helen Stephens (Anna Massey), one of Mark's tenants, comes upstairs to give him a piece of her birthday cake, it is the start of a relationship that provides great insight to Lewis' past.  Through their interactions, it is revealed that Mark's father was a noted psychologist who specialized in the study of fear.  As a boy, Mark was constantly filmed by his father, and used as a test subject.  Because of this cruel treatment, Mark has developed a sick fascination with death.It is not clear whether Mark has killed before, but the police investigating the prostitute's murder are not yet looking for a serial killer, so she may well have been his first victim.  In any case, Mark Lewis' desire to capture death on film has now become a compulsion, as he engages in risky behavior that is sure to lead to his discovery.  When a second woman is found murdered, at the studio where he works, Lewis soon falls under suspicion.Mark also faces a crisis at home, as Helen's mother (Maxine Audley) who is blind, is fearful of what might happen to her daughter.  Mark catches her inside his room, and although she can't see anything incriminating, in a ultra-dramatic confrontation the woman senses that Mark is extremely troubled, and tells him to get help.Mark is already too far gone, and nothing will keep him from attempting to achieve his goal.  The film's conclusion is shocking and grim, as the ingeniously cruel method by which Lewis attempts to capture his images is clearly revealed.  And as a final shocker, Lewis has also made extensive advance preparations for shooting his final movie.Once reviled as utter trash, Peeping Tom is now regarded by some as an avant-garde masterwork in the horror genre, championed by the likes of Martin Scorsese.  Viewed by today's standards, the violence may not seem very graphic, however when put in historical context, the film was quite bold, daring, and twisted for the times.  With the killer's identity revealed early on, the story may not be as suspenseful or sophisticated as Psycho, but it still has layers that are peeled back to gradually reveal a very troubled individual, and the fatalistic finish is exceedingly extreme for 1960.Carl Boehm's performance is deep, captivating, and displays great range.  Mark Lewis is clearly a sick person who does some really terrible things, but there's still some humanity present that makes it difficult to regard him as completely evil.  Maxine Audley makes a very strong impression as Helen's almost clairvoyant mother, while Anna Massey (1937-2011) brings innocence and purity to Helen, the girl that is too special for Mark to photograph.Previously available only on Region 2 DVD, The Criterion Collection edition is the first ever Region 1 release, and features a newly restored widescreen version of the film, an deeply analytical ""companion"" type commentary by Laura Mulvey, and a 50 minute long documentary from 1997 called A Very British Psycho.  The Criterion edition is a solid release, although the extras are not as extensive as on some of the Region 2 releases.",4,a return from obscurity for this once reviled pre-Psycho

Ros ""rastacat1""","[7, 9]","&quot;Well, he won't be doing the crossword tonight!&quot;&quot;Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is ...?&quot;This is somewhat of a landmark film in that it was well made and truly disturbing. Those two things had not really made it to films together before this gem came along. But unfortunately for the director Michael Powell, it also brought about the end of his career as a director. Make a scary movie that is effective and realistic? The nerve! Lets blacklist him and make sure he never does it again!It did however pave the way for fellow director Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho which came out a few months later. Without Peeping Tom to have blazed the trail the same fate to some degree may have befallen Hitchcock.The story is about a reclusive man, Mark Lewis (Karlheinz B&ouml;hm), who works as a cameraman for a movie studio during the day, and by night films things with his hand held movie camera. What his tastes for filming have turned to lately have been the looks on women's faces as they are being murdered.A woman in the building he lives in, Vivian (Moira Shearer), takes a fancy to him and starts getting him to go out occasionaly. They hit it off but Vivians mother, a blind woman who is so good at using her other senses that she can tell who is standing outside their window, has her doubts about Vivians new love interest. In one incredible scene there is a confrontation between her and Mark that is terrifying to watch.It almost has the feel of a who-dunnit except that we know exactly who-dunnit from the start. The detectives in the movie are putting together the clues that take them closer to Mark and and the tension that is built around them and between Mark and Vivian and her mother becomes intense as the movie progresses.The ending, although less shocking 40 years after the movie was released, still left me somewhat drained and empty. A certain amount of sympathy is built up for Mark and there are hopes that he can be redeemed. But I won't tell any more of what happens, you will just have to rent or buy the movie.This is part of the Criterion Collection and horror/drama fans and dvd enthusiasts alike will not be dissapointed.

I'm so thankful that the Criterion people have secured the rights to PEEPING TOM, because prior to their involvement, no adequate VHS version has existed.  Upon viewing, one can see why the relative conservative United Kingdom vehemently attacked the film when it was released.  It is not an immoral, disgusting film as it has been characterized as... rather, it is a deeply disturbing look at the voyeuristic nature of film itself, which is probably why it has struck such an unpleasant chord in many film-lovers, as it questions the very medium of their enthusiasm.  It is a splendidly made film which invites us into the mind of a very sympathetic, oddly charasmatic serial killer who has a penchant for filming the killings of his victims.  Rather than a cold-blooded psychopath, he is a semi-gentle, shy man who has fallen victim to the lure of peeping and has taken it to an ultimate extreme.  Martin Scorsese has asserted that no other movie has had such an overwhelming intellectual effect on his work... could you need a higher recommendation?",5,One of the classic thrillers,972172800,"10 22, 2000",2000,1133,"['movie', 'art-film', 'lovers', 'would', 'should', 'come', 'back', 'time', 'time', 'again', ""'m"", 'so', 'thankful', 'Criterion', 'people', 'have', 'secured', 'rights', 'PEEPING', 'TOM', 'prior', 'involvement', 'adequate', 'VHS', 'version', 'existed', 'viewing', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'relative', 'conservative', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'vehemently', 'attacked', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'not', 'immoral', 'disgusting', 'film', 'been', 'characterized', 'rather', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'look', 'voyeuristic', 'nature', 'film', 'probably', 'why', 'struck', 'unpleasant', 'chord', 'many', 'film-lovers', 'questions', 'very', 'medium', 'enthusiasm', 'splendidly', 'made', 'film', 'mind', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'oddly', 'charasmatic', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'penchant', 'filming', 'killings', 'victims', 'Rather', 'cold-blooded', 'psychopath', 'semi-gentle', 'shy', 'man', 'who', 'fallen', 'victim', 'lure', 'peeping', 'taken', 'ultimate', 'extreme', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'asserted', 'other', 'movie', 'had', 'overwhelming', 'intellectual', 'effect', 'work', 'could', 'need', 'higher', 'recommendation']",N/A
