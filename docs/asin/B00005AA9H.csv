576327,A24H4MQR1BU7CT,B00005AA9H,John D. Seneca,"[3, 3]","This movie is a must see for all horror movie/ thriller fans. It is quite magnificent. It will have you looking around your house when it's over if you watch it alone late at night.The movie begins quickly after shortly over 2 mins. From that point on, it will have you hooked and it will feel as if you are in the shoes of the main character.This is more of a 70's style horror film. It brings to mind a few other certifiable horror classics such as Last House On The Left and I Spit On Your Grave. It is, however, unique in it's own way. It takes it's audience on a ride which they can't imagine!!The movie never was released to movie theatres; it went straight to video release. It definetely deserves more recognition than that.I highly recommend this movie if horror movies are your thing!! On the other hand, if you prefer special effects ridden movies, then this is not the one for you.So, lock your doors, draw down the shade, and relax for a wonderful movie that succeeds in scarying the ... out of you!I prefer these types of horror films much more than a lot of the ... released today. At least this movie can frighten you!!Stephanie Jones did a magnificent job portraying LoriBeth and Muse Watson was fantastic as the insane killer, Daryl. Both of these actors deserve recognition and this film should not be overlooked because it is very good!Check it out- at your own risk and be sure to lock the door first!!",5,A Terrifying Horror Movie!!,1009584000,"12 29, 2001",2001,1423,"['movie', 'must', 'see', 'horror', 'thriller', 'fans', 'quite', 'magnificent', 'will', 'have', 'looking', 'house', 'when', 'watch', 'alone', 'late', 'night.The', 'movie', 'quickly', 'shortly', '2', 'mins', 'point', 'will', 'have', 'hooked', 'will', 'feel', 'are', 'shoes', 'main', 'character.This', 'more', '70', 'style', 'horror', 'film', 'mind', 'few', 'other', 'certifiable', 'horror', 'classics', 'such', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'however', 'unique', 'own', 'way', 'audience', 'ride', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'movie', 'never', 'was', 'released', 'movie', 'theatres', 'went', 'straight', 'video', 'release', 'definetely', 'more', 'recognition', 'that.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'thing', 'other', 'hand', 'prefer', 'special', 'effects', 'ridden', 'movies', 'then', 'not', 'one', 'you.So', 'lock', 'doors', 'draw', 'down', 'shade', 'relax', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'scarying', 'prefer', 'types', 'horror', 'films', 'much', 'more', 'lot', 'released', 'today', 'least', 'movie', 'can', 'frighten', 'Stephanie', 'Jones', 'did', 'magnificent', 'job', 'portraying', 'LoriBeth', 'Muse', 'Watson', 'was', 'fantastic', 'insane', 'killer', 'Daryl', 'actors', 'deserve', 'recognition', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'very', 'good', 'Check', 'out-', 'own', 'risk', 'be', 'sure', 'lock', 'door', 'first']",N/A
576328,AOAW5ARGQWSCY,B00005AA9H,"kurlebj ""kurlebj""","[3, 3]","It seems, from reading the reviews that are written about this film, that people either absolutely loved it or out right hated it. I actually found myself in between while watching this film for the first time yesterday. After reading some of the reviews here, I was browsing through my local dvd store and picked it up on a whim. Here's what I thought:The plot of the movie couldn't be more simple. A gang of hoodlums break into a family's house while they are home. They begin to terrorize the family while the two daughters (who the thugs didn't know existed yet) try to escape and get help. That's it. There's no backstory on any of the characters and the movie gets under way without and development at all. Most of the violence in the film is done off screen so we really don't get to see much of it, just hear it. And since there are no special effects, no set changes and pretty much no budget, what we are left with is the story, the characters and the acting.I felt the real winner in this little film was the acting. The girl who layed Loribeth was actually quite good. Coming off as very scared but determined. The main ""bad guy"" (done in meniacal fashion by the same ""bad guy"" in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") also was very convincing as the instigator/leader of the group. Most of the supporting cast was acceptable enough.Overall, the movie successfully comes off with a bit of a scared and tense feeling to it and does the job of making you interested and feel sympathy for Loribeth. I felt with a little more effort and maybe a few more bucks in the budget they could have made it into something much better, but it's a reasonable entry into a genre that doesn't get much attention nowadays....",3,If I Die Before I Wake,1029888000,"08 21, 2002",2002,1716,"['reading', 'reviews', 'are', 'written', 'film', 'people', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'out', 'right', 'hated', 'actually', 'found', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'yesterday', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'browsing', 'local', 'dvd', 'store', 'picked', 'up', 'whim', 'Here', 'what', 'thought', 'plot', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'simple', 'gang', 'hoodlums', 'break', 'family', 'house', 'are', 'home', 'begin', 'terrorize', 'family', 'two', 'daughters', 'who', 'thugs', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'existed', 'yet', 'try', 'escape', 'get', 'help', 'backstory', 'characters', 'movie', 'way', 'development', 'Most', 'violence', 'film', 'done', 'off', 'screen', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'much', 'just', 'hear', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'set', 'changes', 'pretty', 'much', 'budget', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'story', 'characters', 'acting.I', 'felt', 'real', 'winner', 'little', 'film', 'was', 'acting', 'girl', 'who', 'layed', 'Loribeth', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Coming', 'off', 'very', 'scared', 'determined', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'done', 'meniacal', 'fashion', 'same', 'bad', 'guy', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'also', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'instigator/leader', 'group', 'Most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'acceptable', 'enough.Overall', 'movie', 'successfully', 'off', 'bit', 'scared', 'tense', 'feeling', 'job', 'making', 'interested', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Loribeth', 'felt', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'maybe', 'few', 'more', 'bucks', 'budget', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'reasonable', 'entry', 'genre', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'attention', 'nowadays']",N/A
576329,A1V5G1O9TRGO7M,B00005AA9H,matt,"[0, 2]","&quot;If I Die Before I Wake&quot; is far from a typical genre effort these days.  In an age of 'hip' horror films which provide neither the promised horror nor suspense, it's refreshing to come across this little hidden gem of a movie!  Fully loaded with both terror and suspense, it is a far cry from most modern horror films and because of this, most genre fans will be very pleased with this little offering.  Think back to the late 70's, a time of exploitation/revenge cinema.  If you've seen Wes Craven's &quot;Last House on the Left&quot;, you know what kind of film you have on your hands with &quot;If I Die...&quot;, it's not nearly as good as &quot;Last House...&quot;, but worlds better than your typical &quot;Urban Legend&quot; or &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; offering that has sent horror fans running for the exits in disgust in recent years.This film opens rather quicky, with an immediate home invasion.  There is no character development before things get underway, at the start,we are plunged headfirst into a realisitc nightmare along with Lori-Beth (Stephanie Jones) and her very young sister Mary (Coryanne Sennett).  Three thungs have broken down the door and entered their home, while Lori-Beth quickly and carefully hides her little sister and herself, we hear the intruders sieze the rest of the family, mother, father and brother.  These scenes are unsettling without being terribly graphic, director Brian Katkin keeps the violence off camera choosing instead to focus on the terrified expressions of a frantic Lori-Beth and the young and terrified Mary.For the first half of the film, we follow Lori-Beth and her efforts to keep Mary safe, as well as find a way to get help.  This is where the film is most effective, some of the scenes of Lori-Beth hiding from the intruders are heartpounding.  Some of the moments where young Mary listens to her parents and brother being beaten in the next room are among the most unsettling I've seen in a while.During the second half of the film, the pace slackens, but just a little.  We begin to learn a little about the attackers' personalities and learn that the one in charge is Daryl (Muse Watson, the killer from I Know What You Did Last Summer).  He is the most threatening of the bunch and is clearly the biggest menace in the film.  Of course, they eventually find out about the two hidding siblings and so begins a game of cat and mouse for the third act.  One of the thugs is also overcome with remorse and befriends the little girl, which makes for a more interesting and tense finish.  It also gives the villians a much needed human characterisitc which was severely missing at the start.  In many ways, seeing this human side makes these characters more frightening.&quot;If I Die Before I Wake&quot; has a few uncomfortable moments, including beatings, rape and even sodomy.  Although none of these moments are portrayed graphically, this may be enough to keep some viewers at bay.  Seasoned horror vets shouldn't be overly bothered, but this film does produce moments of an unsettling nature for sure.If there are any complaints regarding this film, it's the villians.  They're not quite as believable as the rapist/killers in &quot;Last House on the Left&quot;, at times (especially at the baginning) they tend to ham it up and go overboard balooning up their characters into larger than life cliches.  This is both disapointing and a bit distracting.  Most of this film is so good that it's sad to see it funble in one of the most crutial areas.At 77 Minutes, &quot;If I Die...&quot; isn't very long giving it little chance to wear out its welcome.  Overall, it's a mean little horror film that's actually scary and unsettling.  This is a must see for horror fans, a welcome throwback to one of the golden ages of horror.  It's a shame this great little sleeper didn't get a theatrical run, don't miss your chance to catch this one on DVD, it's really very good!  Hats off to the cast and crew, you've made a horror film that's all too rare these days, it both scares and disturbs.  Get this one along with the foreign chiller Funny Games for a night of close to home terror.
