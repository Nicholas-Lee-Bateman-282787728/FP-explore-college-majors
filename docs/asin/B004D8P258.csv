Anyone care to tell where the WOF routine is found on this DVD?OK, I found it myself :-) The contents list was under the generic paper catalog in the left side of the case. It said it was in the last episode, and it is. The first time through the DVD I turned it off in the middle of that episode due to lack of interest in the A&C; show in general.Still doesn't change the rating, though. I guess if you like over the top silliness you could add a star.

From the beginning to the end of this video,if you are unmoved then you are truly without any humor. The ability to make people laugh without sex, profanity, or at the expense of some one else is a lost art. The section who's on first is a masterpiece in it self. Just trying to keep up in the beginning was funny, and to turn words of t into names, inter change them and not fumble was hilarious. great video.",5,Who's on first?,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,510,"['Classic', 'comedy', 'should', 'be', 'video', 'collection', 'one', 'who', 'good', 'clean', 'comedy', 'beginning', 'end', 'video', 'are', 'unmoved', 'then', 'are', 'truly', 'humor', 'ability', 'make', 'people', 'sex', 'profanity', 'expense', 'one', 'else', 'lost', 'art', 'section', 'who', 'first', 'masterpiece', 'Just', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'beginning', 'was', 'funny', 'turn', 'words', 't', 'names', 'inter', 'change', 'not', 'fumble', 'was', 'hilarious', 'great', 'video']",The Abbott and Costello Show: Who's On First?
