1236707,A1OEUS1U0S6X6E,B001TKKB1I,"Amy Goodson ""amycougar""","[10, 10]","These are classic Tom and Jerry cartoons from the 40s/50s. No Chuck Jones, thank goodness. Personally, I do not care for the Chuck Jones directed ones. Anyway, there are 14 o 15 shorts -- not remastered. The sound goes low in 3 of them and then comes back to normal. I really didn't pay attention to this since there's not any dialouge. The picture looks as if they transferred it right from the 16mm. But it's not completely horrible. No Mammy Two Shoes. Cartoons included on this disc are Jerry's Cousin, Jerry and the Goldfish, Slicked Up Pup, Quiet Please -- also, the one where Tom is dressed up as a baby and 3 cats make fun of him, the one where the bird falls in love with Tom, ""Just Whistle"" with Spike helping Jerry. I have been wanting to buy the Spotlight collections but have been hesitant because of the reviews saying they are edited. I love Tom and Jerry, but I want the uncut versions. Even without Mammy Two Shoes, the Greatest Chases DVDs are worth getting.",4,"Not remastered, but still entertaining and fun trip down memory lane",1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,976,"['are', 'classic', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'cartoons', '40s/50s', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Personally', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Chuck', 'Jones', 'directed', 'ones', 'Anyway', 'are', '14', 'o', '15', 'shorts', 'not', 'remastered', 'sound', 'low', '3', 'then', 'back', 'normal', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'not', 'dialouge', 'picture', 'transferred', 'right', '16mm', 'not', 'completely', 'horrible', 'Mammy', 'Two', 'Shoes', 'Cartoons', 'included', 'disc', 'are', 'Jerry', 'Cousin', 'Jerry', 'Goldfish', 'Slicked', 'Up', 'Pup', 'Quiet', 'Please', 'also', 'one', 'where', 'Tom', 'dressed', 'up', 'baby', '3', 'cats', 'make', 'fun', 'one', 'where', 'bird', 'love', 'Tom', 'Just', 'Whistle', 'Spike', 'helping', 'Jerry', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'buy', 'Spotlight', 'collections', 'have', 'been', 'hesitant', 'reviews', 'saying', 'are', 'edited', 'love', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'want', 'uncut', 'versions', 'Even', 'Mammy', 'Two', 'Shoes', 'Greatest', 'Chases', 'DVDs', 'are', 'worth', 'getting']","Tom and Jerry's Greatest Chases, Vol. 2"
