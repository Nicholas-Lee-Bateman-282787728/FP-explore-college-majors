Both of these movies were fun, Losin' It with John Stockwell as the star and with Jackie Earle Haley and Tom Cruise as his followers was terrific the guys need to go to Mexico to &#34;lose it&#34;. fun. By far though my favorite of the 2 is &#34;the last American virgin&#34;, attractive cast, very well acted, funny when it needed to be and authentic when dealing with the problems of youth.
