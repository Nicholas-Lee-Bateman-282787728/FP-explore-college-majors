Looking back and studying history can help you find out who you are and where the world is going due to history often repeats itself. This six hour dvd is packed with information about slavery and its history. The documentary goes so deep into detail that it will have unknown information for the most scholarly historian. Features like this are important for children of afrikan descent due to the fact it seems that the school system isn't teaching this aspect of history and making sure our youth understands the importance of the events that happened. This documentary is highly recommended for your collection.,5,a documentary that everyone needs to see.,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,645,"['love', 'history', 'death', 'also', 'Looking', 'back', 'studying', 'history', 'can', 'help', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'world', 'going', 'due', 'history', 'often', 'six', 'hour', 'dvd', 'packed', 'information', 'slavery', 'history', 'documentary', 'so', 'deep', 'detail', 'will', 'have', 'unknown', 'information', 'most', 'scholarly', 'historian', 'Features', 'are', 'important', 'children', 'afrikan', 'descent', 'due', 'fact', 'school', 'system', ""n't"", 'teaching', 'aspect', 'history', 'making', 'sure', 'youth', 'importance', 'events', 'happened', 'documentary', 'highly', 'recommended', 'collection']",N/A
551623,A25KKXUQQ0OLWB,B00004U2MR,"Lynn Ellingwood ""The ESOL Teacher""","[1, 1]","Wonderful absorbing documentary about how Africans began coming into America and were turned into slaves.  The history stops at the Civil War but provides a complete overview of the time period before the end of slavery.  Africans who initially came were pressed into indentured servitude but after word got out in Europe and England how badly indentured servants were treated (few barely lived to freedom in 7 years) and tobacco was discovered to grow well in Virginia soil, planters sought to procure slaves to do work which others would not do.  I am teaching American History in school and found this to be a very good documentary and included information I didn't even know about.  Hard to reconcile the idea of freedom and slavery in the same country but the truth is the truth and it is not pretty.",5,"Very Thorough, Absorbing History of Africans In America",1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,805,"['Wonderful', 'absorbing', 'documentary', 'how', 'Africans', 'began', 'coming', 'America', 'were', 'turned', 'slaves', 'history', 'Civil', 'War', 'complete', 'overview', 'time', 'period', 'end', 'slavery', 'Africans', 'who', 'initially', 'came', 'were', 'pressed', 'indentured', 'servitude', 'word', 'got', 'out', 'Europe', 'England', 'how', 'badly', 'indentured', 'servants', 'were', 'treated', 'few', 'barely', 'lived', 'freedom', '7', 'years', 'tobacco', 'was', 'discovered', 'grow', 'well', 'Virginia', 'soil', 'planters', 'sought', 'procure', 'slaves', 'do', 'work', 'others', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'am', 'teaching', 'American', 'History', 'school', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'included', 'information', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'about', 'Hard', 'reconcile', 'idea', 'freedom', 'slavery', 'same', 'country', 'truth', 'truth', 'not', 'pretty']",N/A

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[10, 10]","I am absolutely NOT a history buff, so when I didn't have to take a bunch of history classes in high school, I was okay with that.  But when I got to Northern Michigan University and realized how some locations can completely snub African American literature by not teaching it, it annoyed me.  It also made me want to learn more.  Since then, I have found interesting ways to learn more about my own history.  An Amazon friend gave this DVD such a high rating (and he doesn't like much of anything) so I had to check it out.  I picked it up at the library figuring it was going to be pretty dry but educational.  Wrong!  Not only was it educational, but it was the most interesting way to ever learn about African American history for someone like me.  Bassett has a wonderful storytelling voice, there were enough anecdotes to make it feel heartwrenching, the information was endless, and it was so well documented.  I am completely impressed and bought a copy for myself. It's such a satisfying feeling to be able to back up emotions with actual facts and this DVD gave a lot of hidden information that we'll never find in ""American"" history books.
