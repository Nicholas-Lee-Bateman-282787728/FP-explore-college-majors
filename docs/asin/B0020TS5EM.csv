1246005,AYS76OJTHVY1K,B0020TS5EM,A,"[0, 0]","I truly believe that The Shield is one of the greatest works of art ever put on film.  I'd place it right alongside The Godfather and 2001: A Space Odyssey.Many people have compared the Shield to Shakespeare's Macbeth and Richard the Third.  It has also been said, that unlike most television Dramas, the Shield, in its entirety, has a three act structure. Two key events happen - during seasons five, and seven, respectively - in the lives of the characters that completely change the dynamic of the show.I'd have to choose the final season as my favorite, and I also consider the series finale to be the best season finale I've ever seen.  You must watch this show all the way to the final episode.  If you were to stop short of the end, you really would not understand it completely.  Everything that happens in these characters' lives culminates in the final few episodes.Two days ago, I watched the final episode again.  I've watched the entire series, front to back, twice already, so nothing that happens in the story comes as a surprise anymore.  Despite this fact, when the episode finished, I just sat there, overwhelmed, and almost in shock.  I think my reaction was due to the fact that I was taken aback by the sheer quality of this show, and by the degree to which it affected my life.

Several weeks ago, I decided to give it a try here on Amazon Prime. Within the first ten minutes I was hooked, and binge-watched whenever I could.  I have never seen TV characters more real or more flawed than a lot of these people. The Strike Team shows you how rogue they can go right from the beginning, so you no longer find yourself surprised when they do something heinous, whether it is justified or not. These are not Law & Order cops.  These are dirty cops who get the job done, and you find yourself rooting for them whether you want to or not. All seven seasons kept me riveted.  The final season was positively Shakespearean in its conclusion, particularly with regard to Ronnie. The ironies that pile up, one after, make it hard to completely like or dislike anyone, though Corinne did get on my nerves more than once. Dutch is a great character, a genius at psychological profiling. Billings is smarmy and funny. They could have done so much more with Danny, but Catherine Bent did what she could with the role.  CCH Pounder, long a favorite of mine, is mesmerizing as Claudette.  All of the guys on the Strike team were perfectly cast and each of them pulled his weight. Walton Goggins blew me away with his ability to make you both love and hate him, and you really come to like and understand Lem and Ronnie. The heart of the show, though, is Michael Chiklis.  His Vic Mackey is a complex good guy who is occasionally bad or bad guy who is occasionally good. His love for his family is not his driving force until the end, and then the end knocks you out as you watch the lengthy close-up of his face as he realizes what he has lost. Excellent. Perfect. Right up there with ""The Wire"" and ""Breaking Bad"" for me.  Will likely start again, just to pick up things I missed before.

1246017,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0020TS5EM,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[5, 6]","This tv series would be very difficult to watch out of order.  So the only qualifier I must give is that if you want to experience this series, you really need to see series 1-7 in order.  Do not start with season 7 or you will miss the truly Shakespearean, almost King Lear type epic tragedy, which unfolds in the final season. There is little if any comic relief in this series.  I didn't particularly miss having comic relief but this series is not for the faint of heart.Det. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) is, of course the lead.  He is a cop who had a lot of talent for the job who has gotten more and more corrupt with each season.  When the series started he had some redeeming features.  Back then he seemed to really love his wife and kids and treasure his friends on his strike team.  Now every one of those relationships has been likewise contaminated by all the evil he has engaged in from series 1-6.  He also got the job done back in season one even though no one could approve of his methods.  He's not even getting the job done right by season 7.  He is so over his head with everyone and everything that he touches, that anything within his vicinity becomes likewise contaminated and ruined.The series is very well written and directed.  Shawn Ryan is the one who conceived the show and saw it through all seven seasons.  He kept the writing on track as well as the directing.  I am sure he must be a hero to everyone who acted on the show as virtually everyone on it was fairly unknown prior to its debut.There are few likable people in this series.  Claudette, who has become in charge and tries to do an honest job; Dutch, the most honest and best detective; Danny, a cop on the force who had Vic's baby; Vic's wife and children; Shane's wife and children; Julian, a gay cop--that pretty much covers it on likable characters.  Certainly no one on the strike force is likable.  Perhaps the closest to likable left was Ronnie Gardocki.  He is the one who remains closest to Mackey all through the final season and Mackey now even uses him at every turn to save himself.  In season 1, that would have been unthinkable.However, the most stunning tragedy which unfolds is the deterioration of the Mackey-Shane Vandrell relationship.  Mackey becomes obsessed with getting Shane, taking him down.  He sees Shane as the embodiment of all of his problems and in his head thinks if he can get rid of Shane, he can return to the way he was in season 1.Walter Goggins as Shane Vandrell becomes such a tragic figure in his quest to save his wife and children from all the consequences of what he did with Mackey that he comes close to stealing the whole show.  Perhaps the most horrible thing Mackey does is paint a picture for Shane over the phone of ""Shane and his wife being in prison and his children in foster care with Mackey there to make sure all of them get the rawest deal"".  He gloats aloud over the fact that Shane can no longer hurt him because he's got a deal with the feds to save himself.  Shane knows it is all really over for him when he hangs up from this phone call.  This phone call was one of the most horrible things I've ever heard but the actions which flow from it are even worse.What happens to Mackey is just brilliant.  It is totally fitting and apt.  It is one of the best series enders I've experienced.  I cannot say a word more about it though without spoiling it.This is vivid, riveting, rugged drama, shot in a cinema verite style (you are there) and if you are not faint of heart, see it.  If you hate violence and unhappiness though, it may not be for you.",5,Fantastic Conclusion to an Excellent Series but Not for Faint of Heart,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,3599,"['tv', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'order', 'only', 'qualifier', 'must', 'give', 'want', 'experience', 'series', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'series', '1-7', 'order', 'Do', 'not', 'start', 'season', '7', 'will', 'miss', 'truly', 'Shakespearean', 'almost', 'King', 'Lear', 'type', 'epic', 'tragedy', 'final', 'season', 'little', 'comic', 'relief', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'miss', 'having', 'comic', 'relief', 'series', 'not', 'faint', 'heart.Det', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'Michael', 'Chiklis', 'course', 'lead', 'cop', 'who', 'had', 'lot', 'talent', 'job', 'who', 'gotten', 'more', 'more', 'corrupt', 'season', 'When', 'series', 'started', 'had', 'redeeming', 'features', 'Back', 'then', 'seemed', 'really', 'love', 'wife', 'kids', 'treasure', 'friends', 'strike', 'team', 'Now', 'one', 'relationships', 'been', 'likewise', 'contaminated', 'evil', 'engaged', 'series', '1-6', 'also', 'got', 'job', 'done', 'back', 'season', 'one', 'even', 'one', 'could', 'approve', 'methods', 'not', 'even', 'getting', 'job', 'done', 'right', 'season', '7', 'so', 'head', 'everyone', 'everything', 'anything', 'vicinity', 'likewise', 'contaminated', 'ruined.The', 'series', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'Shawn', 'Ryan', 'one', 'who', 'conceived', 'show', 'saw', 'seven', 'seasons', 'kept', 'writing', 'track', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'am', 'sure', 'must', 'be', 'hero', 'everyone', 'who', 'acted', 'show', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'was', 'fairly', 'unknown', 'prior', 'debut.There', 'are', 'few', 'likable', 'people', 'series', 'Claudette', 'who', 'become', 'charge', 'tries', 'do', 'honest', 'job', 'Dutch', 'most', 'honest', 'best', 'detective', 'Danny', 'cop', 'force', 'who', 'had', 'Vic', 'baby', 'Vic', 'wife', 'children', 'Shane', 'wife', 'children', 'Julian', 'gay', 'cop', 'pretty', 'much', 'covers', 'likable', 'characters', 'Certainly', 'one', 'strike', 'force', 'likable', 'Perhaps', 'closest', 'likable', 'left', 'was', 'Ronnie', 'Gardocki', 'one', 'who', 'closest', 'Mackey', 'final', 'season', 'Mackey', 'now', 'even', 'turn', 'save', 'season', '1', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unthinkable.However', 'most', 'stunning', 'tragedy', 'deterioration', 'Mackey-Shane', 'Vandrell', 'relationship', 'Mackey', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'Shane', 'taking', 'down', 'Shane', 'embodiment', 'problems', 'head', 'can', 'get', 'rid', 'Shane', 'can', 'return', 'way', 'was', 'season', '1.Walter', 'Goggins', 'Shane', 'Vandrell', 'such', 'tragic', 'figure', 'quest', 'save', 'wife', 'children', 'consequences', 'what', 'did', 'Mackey', 'close', 'stealing', 'whole', 'show', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'horrible', 'thing', 'Mackey', 'paint', 'picture', 'Shane', 'phone', 'Shane', 'wife', 'being', 'prison', 'children', 'foster', 'care', 'Mackey', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'rawest', 'deal', 'aloud', 'fact', 'Shane', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'hurt', 'got', 'deal', 'feds', 'save', 'Shane', 'really', 'when', 'up', 'phone', 'call', 'phone', 'call', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'horrible', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'actions', 'flow', 'are', 'even', 'worse.What', 'Mackey', 'just', 'brilliant', 'totally', 'fitting', 'apt', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'enders', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'word', 'more', 'spoiling', 'it.This', 'vivid', 'riveting', 'rugged', 'drama', 'shot', 'cinema', 'verite', 'style', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'see', 'hate', 'violence', 'unhappiness', 'may', 'not', 'be']",The Shield: Season 7 - The Final Act

1246037,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B0020TS5EM,Green Manalishi,"[1, 1]","Wow, this show...  Thank God for Amazon, a place where you can come to unwind the turmoil that shows like this leave you in once you're finished.  The Shield stands among those epic acheivements of television in the new millenium like The Wire or The Sopranos.  In two words.. riveting television.  Other riveting shows, not necessarily of the same genre would include Breaking Bad (the first 2 seasons at least), 6 Feet Under, Damages, Rome, The Good Wife, and Californication.  It's amazing what the turn of the millenium has produced, mostly for pay TV, HBO and Showtime.  With this show ""The Shield"", FX established themselves.But what of the show? * * SPOILERS * * It somehow managed to outdo itself time after time and season after season.  Weakest of the bunch, in my opinion would have been the season which takes up with Forest Whitaker as Det. John Kavanaugh.  He was pretty over-the-top I thought especially in the beginning.  If anyone ever looked psycho in this show it was him - a bit much for a guy playing a cop.  The thing that bugged most was that Whitaker just seemed to be playing the same character he always plays, e.g. ""The Crying Game"", etc.  If there was a lull in the series, it was during his tenure.  Especially after following up Glenn Close from the previous season.  She was great.But I'm digressing, because this is supposed to be about the end of the show and not the middle.  If there were ever any bones I had to pick about The Shield it would be the occasional (but perhaps necessary) convenient illogical choices made by characters along the way. And come to think of it, those illogical decisions were made by Mackey in every incident I can think of.  The first: Mackey's threat to kill Shane after he discovers Shane has killed Lem.  Had Lem testified about the money train in order to get locked up in some prison away from Antwon Mitchell, the whole strike team would have been brought down.  Shane simply acted with the same intelligence any other mobster would have, probably the second biggest negative defining point of the strike team's players after the killing of the would-be informant cop they offed in season 1.  Vic could not accept that, but the reality of the situation is that with Lem not accepting a trip to Mexico and his mind already set on giving up his part in the money train, Shane's action in effect kept the whole group out of jail (and kept the series going!).  Nothing contrived thus far, but Vic's final inability to forgive Shane that, and vowing to kill him even, sets what's left of the group in turmoil and Shane back to his own devices.  I kind of didn't beleive Vic would be so stupid as to not seeing the unpleasant logic of what Shane had done.  Shane calls Vic a hypocrite at one point and he's right.  He basically saved him (again, in true gangster logic) from doing what needed to be done.  Of course the war that this sparks off between them is good fodder for following seasons.  Which brings us to Season 7.A few more things I didn't quite buy.  Vic agrees to give Aceveda a key to the locker in which they are storing the little black box with dirt on all the higher ups that Vic found.  Why would he do that, knowing his always precarious relationship with Aceveda?  Later Vic gives over his file with dirt on the ICE agent to that same agent (they are working together).  He gives her the file before making his deal - again, why would he do that?  If not for convenience to the developing plot line, I don't think Mackey would have been so soft-headed and incapable of seeing his loss of bartering position.Then there is the issue of over-stupid criminals that always agree to go with Mackey's plans (and that always end up with them on ICE's plate).  You could argue that Mackey is truly corrupt enough for it not to seem so completely illogical.  So I will suspend disbeleif.And this brings up another good topic: Mackey's corruption.  In spite of his undeniable crimes, there is a reason most people who watch this show end up routing for Mackey in spite of themselves, and that is that he has as many good qualities as he has criminal tendencies in his career.  Let us also not forget that while his greatest and most unforgivable crime was the killing of an investigating officer, at the same time it is undeniable that Mackey's mere presence on the street largely results in the saving of many lives time and time again.  Many more lives than the one he took in fact. There is no black and white about Vic - he's a lovely shade of grey.  And though he is certainly that grey character, your underlying feeling is that the man is basically decent.  There is no denying that Vic under normal circumstances (and even under incredibly un-normal circumstances) is a loyal, if not father-like figure, to his people on the strike team offering undying and unflagging support.  And not only to them but to his divorced wife and children as well.  The general feeling you get about Vic most of the time is that the man cares about his people.  This makes the ending where he winds up making a deal to get his traitorous wife off the hook instead of his truly loyal friend Ronnie Gardocky one of the great tragedies of the last season.  If the ship is sinking do you save your wife, who is mother of your three children, or your best friend?  Ronnie was really one of my favorite characters in this show. Quiet, behind the scenes, and reliable.  It was beyond tragic that Vic should give up Gardocky's safe passage for that of his treacherous wife.  Wow, it was amazing and ironic how much more villainous and detestable Corrine seemed by that point.  And his daughter?  What happened to her?  One moment she's trying to turn her own father in at the station.  By the end of the show she seems quite nice to her father again for some reason.  You can only imagine how Corrine is going to explain to her that she can no longer talk to her father for the rest of her life.  Realistic?  I didn't quite buy that Corrine would become so completely traitorous suddenly towards the end of the show, but season 7 certainly wasn't the first time she'd walked that line.  On a side note, some of her screen time acting occasionally seems kind of weak by this point.  Not that it was ever super-strong. Even from the beginning of the show, she and Vic's relationship never came off as 100% convincing.  I think he only kisses her one time in the whole series.You never get the feeling Corine really hates Vic, though her actions and the course she follows, especially with the entry of Kavanaugh into her life, seem to say otherwise.  In this way she goes from being a rather sympathetic to detestable character by the end of the series.  Granted, the strains and danger that Vic's job and extracuricular activities put her under were enormous.In more than one way, Mackey plays something of a modern-day Caesar.  With enemies trying to bring him down at all corners, he's a ruthless dictator of the street on one hand, a benevolent friend on the other. It's hard not to sympathize with him, and with all the rest of the strike team, in spite of what you know.

1246044,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0020TS5EM,J from NY,"[3, 5]","How Sean Ryan managed to pull this off on a channel as relatively tame as ""FX"" is beyond me. Since Season 1 of this bloody, Shakespearean epic, Vic Mackey and Company have done some most unpleasant things--the first thing that comes to mind would be Vic frying a murdering drugdealer's face on a stove burner, the mistaken torture and execution of Guardo in Season Six, etc etc. I am more than sure that Ryan had to work a lot harder than David Chase or David Simon (imagine trying to squeeze an hour of real art between commercials for Enzyte.)""The Final Act"" comes extremely close to transcending anything I have ever seen on television. Learning just who Victor Samuel Mackey, and that's his full name, really was felt both exhilarating, dirty, exhausting and in the end, horrifying.  He is not the alphamale wolf who protects the clan.  He is not the complex, mysterious father figure to Shane.  He is not a righteous vigilante cop in the tradition of ""The Punisher"".He is a bald headed demon from hell who sucks the life out of those under his satanic influence or destroys them entirely.  And he is particularly apt to do so when it is his neck on the line.  How he came to be this way and whether he knows it or not are questions we will never know (Ryan was right not to answer them, actually: the feel of this show, which is kind of like dropping Raymond Chandler into ""Training Day"", does not allow for warm reminiscence).  As the aged ICE agent who listens to Mackey's horrifying confession which seals his immunity asks Claudette ""Exactly what kind of detective did you *raise* here?"", it would be interesting to know that indeed.In the end, though, speculation is immaterial.  When Lem got shafted by Shane with a grenade, whatever tincture of a conscience Vic Mackey possessed in the first place went right through the window.  Lem was the first Sacrifical Lamb, one of Vic's own who died because of his deluded belief in his own intelligence, and Ronnie was the second.  Time heals all wounds, I guess, because it was easier for Vic to sell his friend out so blatantly to save his own skin.  None of that anguish or rage he had when searching for Lem's killer, who was always at his back, only a begrudging and slightly pained willingness.When Claudette finally confronts Vic in the last episode to see what he's made of, to see if there is anything remotely human left in the man, we have perhaps one of the most disturbing sequences in TV history. The ""Hitler act"" with Shane poisoning his wife and children with the threat of prison hanging over his head(Goebbels did the same thing when ""the great man"" withdrew his affection in suicide) ultimately does not affect Vic.  He looks at the awful picture of Shane with his head blown to bits, his wife and child clutching a toy and flowers, and sits for a moment.  He blinks, represses a tear, and grins.  He is a sociopath.  If he so wills it, these kind of things will not hurt him.  The reaction to Claudette trying to probe him is akin to the Devil himself: tearing the camera off the wall with that cobra-like loook in his eye, as though to say ""You dare to judge me?"" and swaggering out of the interrogation room.Watching Ronnie go down was the worst for me.  Though it is possible that Vic was going to tell him that he was screwed, it's pretty clear he didn't care that much.  When he screams ""RONNIE!"" as the police approach to take him straight to hell, it is only to save face in the mirror of his cracked identity.  The heated dialogue between them tells you a lot about Mackey.  He tries to tell Ronnie that he believed Karin, his wife, was ""loyal""--loyal??  Like Vic was loyal?  This is not a titanic figure at all, but a ""twisted and sick man"" as Olivia puts it.  He didn't really have any idea where all this was going and ""the team"" was BS as soon as he lost the feeling for it.One of the best television series in history.",5,"""How the Mighty Have Fallen..""",1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,3905,"['How', 'Sean', 'Ryan', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'channel', 'relatively', 'tame', 'FX', 'Season', '1', 'bloody', 'Shakespearean', 'epic', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'Company', 'have', 'done', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'things', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'Vic', 'frying', 'murdering', 'drugdealer', 'face', 'stove', 'burner', 'mistaken', 'torture', 'execution', 'Guardo', 'Season', 'Six', 'etc', 'etc', 'am', 'more', 'sure', 'Ryan', 'had', 'work', 'lot', 'harder', 'David', 'Chase', 'David', 'Simon', 'imagine', 'trying', 'squeeze', 'hour', 'real', 'art', 'commercials', 'Enzyte', 'Final', 'Act', 'extremely', 'close', 'transcending', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'Learning', 'just', 'who', 'Victor', 'Samuel', 'Mackey', 'full', 'name', 'really', 'was', 'felt', 'exhilarating', 'dirty', 'exhausting', 'end', 'horrifying', 'not', 'alphamale', 'wolf', 'who', 'clan', 'not', 'complex', 'mysterious', 'father', 'figure', 'Shane', 'not', 'righteous', 'vigilante', 'cop', 'tradition', 'Punisher', '.He', 'bald', 'headed', 'demon', 'hell', 'who', 'life', 'satanic', 'influence', 'destroys', 'entirely', 'particularly', 'apt', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'neck', 'line', 'How', 'came', 'be', 'way', 'not', 'are', 'questions', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'Ryan', 'was', 'right', 'not', 'answer', 'actually', 'feel', 'show', 'kind', 'dropping', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'Training', 'Day', 'not', 'allow', 'warm', 'reminiscence', 'aged', 'ICE', 'agent', 'who', 'Mackey', 'horrifying', 'confession', 'immunity', 'Claudette', 'Exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'detective', 'did', '*raise*', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'end', 'though', 'speculation', 'immaterial', 'When', 'Lem', 'got', 'shafted', 'Shane', 'grenade', 'tincture', 'conscience', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'possessed', 'first', 'place', 'went', 'right', 'window', 'Lem', 'was', 'first', 'Sacrifical', 'Lamb', 'one', 'Vic', 'own', 'who', 'died', 'deluded', 'belief', 'own', 'intelligence', 'Ronnie', 'was', 'second', 'Time', 'heals', 'wounds', 'guess', 'was', 'easier', 'Vic', 'sell', 'friend', 'out', 'so', 'blatantly', 'save', 'own', 'skin', 'None', 'anguish', 'rage', 'had', 'when', 'searching', 'Lem', 'killer', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'back', 'only', 'begrudging', 'slightly', 'pained', 'willingness.When', 'Claudette', 'finally', 'Vic', 'last', 'episode', 'see', 'what', 'made', 'see', 'anything', 'remotely', 'human', 'left', 'man', 'have', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'sequences', 'TV', 'history', 'Hitler', 'act', 'Shane', 'poisoning', 'wife', 'children', 'threat', 'prison', 'hanging', 'head', 'Goebbels', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'great', 'man', 'withdrew', 'affection', 'suicide', 'ultimately', 'not', 'affect', 'Vic', 'awful', 'picture', 'Shane', 'head', 'blown', 'bits', 'wife', 'child', 'clutching', 'toy', 'flowers', 'sits', 'moment', 'tear', 'grins', 'sociopath', 'so', 'kind', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'hurt', 'reaction', 'Claudette', 'trying', 'probe', 'akin', 'Devil', 'tearing', 'camera', 'wall', 'cobra-like', 'loook', 'eye', 'say', 'dare', 'judge', 'swaggering', 'interrogation', 'room.Watching', 'Ronnie', 'go', 'down', 'was', 'worst', 'possible', 'Vic', 'was', 'going', 'tell', 'was', 'screwed', 'pretty', 'clear', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'When', 'RONNIE', 'police', 'approach', 'take', 'straight', 'hell', 'only', 'save', 'face', 'mirror', 'cracked', 'identity', 'heated', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'Mackey', 'tell', 'Ronnie', 'believed', 'Karin', 'wife', 'was', 'loyal', 'loyal', 'Vic', 'was', 'loyal', 'not', 'titanic', 'figure', 'twisted', 'sick', 'man', 'Olivia', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'team', 'was', 'BS', 'as', 'soon', 'lost', 'feeling', 'it.One', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'history']",The Shield: Season 7 - The Final Act

I hope show creator Shawn Ryan makes the smart move and insists on putting into his contract that all DVD releases of his present and future shows include subtitles.Heck, even the pre-show interstitial disclaimer cards (""The views expressed in the enclosed commentaries are those of the speakers only and do not necessarily reflect the views of Sony Pictures..."" etc) are presented in French and Spanish in addition to English.

1246072,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B0020TS5EM,Mike,"[3, 3]","Caution...spoilers ahead. I'm assuming many of the people reading this either saw the episodes on TV, watched the DVDs or both. If you're not one of those people, you may want to read this at some other time.One thing about the bonus materials on The Shield DVDs...it's always interesting and provides excellent ""peeks behind the curtain"" for the series' fans. It's made clear that the show would end with ""closure"" on Vic Mackey...perhaps to avoid the kind of backlash that came with Tony Soprano's onion ring-munching ""non-ending"" at the final moments of The Sopranos, or perhaps the complexity of the Mackey character demanded closure.In reality, series creator Sean Ryan is a genius, because whether it's immediately clear or not, Season 7 of The Shield ended with Vic Mackey munching onion rings. Please allow me to elaborate.The set-up is that Vic is being exiled to a cubicle for the next three years, where he'll crank out a ten-page report every day, five days a week, 52 weeks a year. We see Vic look pensively out the upper-story window as squad cars, lights and sirens in full blaze, head toward some unknown crime scene. And when he stuffs his gun in his belt and walks out of the office...the last shot of the series...we see that VIC MACKEY LOOK. The only thing that has changed is his surroundings. He's still the same coiled snake that's depicted on the Strike Team calling card used throughout the series.Three years in Vic Mackey time is nothing, and he would game the system every inch of the way. He'd hired private detectives in the past to find his wife and kids...what possible reason do we have for believing he wouldn't do it again? Vic was simply transplanted to a new playing field. If Ryan wants to do a Shield movie, I've just handed him half the script.CCH Pounder...Captain Wyms...provides another insight when she says in the bonus materials that she is ""cold blooded about walking away from a job well done."" It's an honest and refreshing moment from an actor in a series that was known for its brutal honesty.One reason why NYPD Blue limped to the finish line is that every time the show lost a major character...David Caruso, Jimmy Smits, Rick Schroeder, on and on and on...the writers took a time-out to regroup, to introduce a new character, to re-build momentum, and over time it simply became tiresome.The Shield broke the mold by keeping the freight train roaring down the track, no matter who left. They moved the character of Julien from uniformed officer to Strike Team and back to uniform again. But they never took a time-out, not even for a second. The viewer was never allowed to catch their breath.In terms of major characters...The Strike Team...the series had to end. This became clear after Lem's death, when the only logical progression was to have Shane pay for his sins. Vic exhibits some tough talk about taking a deal from ICE only of Ronnie gets the same deal, but in the end...in true Vic Mackey style...he saved his own hide, took the deal, and sent Ronnie ""off to Antwon Mitchell-land.""Other than the death of the Lem and Shane characters (and Captain Wyms revelation to Dutch that she is dying of lupus), Sean Ryan fed you a big, fresh from the deep-fryer platter of onion rings. There was no more ""closure"" in the final episode of The Shield than there was in the final episode of The Sopranos. If and when he decides to do a movie or any other form of follow-up, Ryan...just like Sopranos creator David Chase...can pick up the pieces right where he left them.On the ""Blue Comet"" episode from the final series of The Sopranos, Steve Van Zandt reveals on the DVD commentary track that actor James Gandolfini, at the table read for the final episode, paused, looked up, and asked ""Why?"" (regarding the onion rings ending). Without missing a beat, David Chase replied ""Because I did not want to show that crime paid, and I did not want to show that it DID NOT pay.""Sean Ryan did exactly the same thing with Vic Mackey. He will spend the next three years drawing a paycheck as the single most corrupt cubicle dweller on the planet. After that, he will regain full ownership of his game, with all sins from the past wiped away with the single stroke of an ICE signature.This, my friends, is genius.",5,A mostly-successful final season juggling act,1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,4256,"['Caution', 'spoilers', 'ahead', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'many', 'people', 'reading', 'saw', 'episodes', 'TV', 'watched', 'DVDs', ""'re"", 'not', 'one', 'people', 'may', 'want', 'read', 'other', 'time.One', 'thing', 'bonus', 'materials', 'Shield', 'DVDs', 'always', 'interesting', 'excellent', 'peeks', 'curtain', 'series', 'fans', 'made', 'clear', 'show', 'would', 'end', 'closure', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'perhaps', 'avoid', 'kind', 'backlash', 'came', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'onion', 'ring-munching', 'non-ending', 'final', 'moments', 'Sopranos', 'perhaps', 'complexity', 'Mackey', 'character', 'demanded', 'closure.In', 'reality', 'series', 'creator', 'Sean', 'Ryan', 'genius', 'immediately', 'clear', 'not', 'Season', '7', 'Shield', 'ended', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'munching', 'onion', 'rings', 'Please', 'allow', 'elaborate.The', 'set-up', 'Vic', 'being', 'exiled', 'cubicle', 'next', 'three', 'years', 'where', ""'ll"", 'crank', 'out', 'ten-page', 'report', 'day', 'five', 'days', 'week', '52', 'weeks', 'year', 'see', 'Vic', 'look', 'pensively', 'upper-story', 'window', 'squad', 'cars', 'lights', 'sirens', 'full', 'blaze', 'head', 'unknown', 'crime', 'scene', 'when', 'stuffs', 'gun', 'belt', 'office', 'last', 'shot', 'series', 'see', 'VIC', 'MACKEY', 'LOOK', 'only', 'thing', 'changed', 'surroundings', 'still', 'same', 'coiled', 'snake', 'depicted', 'Strike', 'Team', 'calling', 'card', 'used', 'series.Three', 'years', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'time', 'nothing', 'would', 'game', 'system', 'inch', 'way', ""'d"", 'hired', 'private', 'detectives', 'past', 'find', 'wife', 'kids', 'what', 'possible', 'reason', 'do', 'have', 'believing', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'again', 'Vic', 'was', 'simply', 'transplanted', 'new', 'playing', 'field', 'Ryan', 'do', 'Shield', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'just', 'handed', 'script.CCH', 'Pounder', 'Captain', 'Wyms', 'insight', 'when', 'bonus', 'materials', 'cold', 'blooded', 'walking', 'away', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'honest', 'refreshing', 'moment', 'actor', 'series', 'was', 'known', 'brutal', 'honesty.One', 'reason', 'why', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'limped', 'finish', 'line', 'time', 'show', 'lost', 'major', 'character', 'David', 'Caruso', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Rick', 'Schroeder', 'writers', 'took', 'time-out', 'regroup', 'introduce', 'new', 'character', 're-build', 'momentum', 'time', 'simply', 'became', 'tiresome.The', 'Shield', 'broke', 'mold', 'keeping', 'freight', 'train', 'roaring', 'down', 'track', 'matter', 'who', 'left', 'moved', 'character', 'Julien', 'uniformed', 'officer', 'Strike', 'Team', 'back', 'uniform', 'again', 'never', 'took', 'time-out', 'not', 'even', 'second', 'viewer', 'was', 'never', 'allowed', 'catch', 'breath.In', 'terms', 'major', 'characters', 'Strike', 'Team', 'series', 'had', 'end', 'became', 'clear', 'Lem', 'death', 'when', 'only', 'logical', 'progression', 'was', 'have', 'Shane', 'pay', 'sins', 'Vic', 'tough', 'talk', 'taking', 'deal', 'ICE', 'only', 'Ronnie', 'same', 'deal', 'end', 'true', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'style', 'saved', 'own', 'hide', 'took', 'deal', 'sent', 'Ronnie', 'Antwon', 'Mitchell-land', 'Other', 'death', 'Lem', 'Shane', 'characters', 'Captain', 'Wyms', 'revelation', 'Dutch', 'dying', 'lupus', 'Sean', 'Ryan', 'fed', 'big', 'fresh', 'deep-fryer', 'platter', 'onion', 'rings', 'was', 'more', 'closure', 'final', 'episode', 'Shield', 'was', 'final', 'episode', 'Sopranos', 'when', 'do', 'movie', 'other', 'form', 'follow-up', 'Ryan', 'just', 'Sopranos', 'creator', 'David', 'Chase', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'right', 'where', 'left', 'them.On', 'Blue', 'Comet', 'episode', 'final', 'series', 'Sopranos', 'Steve', 'Van', 'Zandt', 'reveals', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'actor', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'table', 'read', 'final', 'episode', 'paused', 'looked', 'up', 'asked', 'Why', 'regarding', 'onion', 'rings', 'ending', 'missing', 'beat', 'David', 'Chase', 'replied', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'show', 'crime', 'paid', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'show', 'DID', 'NOT', 'pay', 'Sean', 'Ryan', 'did', 'exactly', 'same', 'thing', 'Vic', 'Mackey', 'will', 'spend', 'next', 'three', 'years', 'drawing', 'paycheck', 'single', 'most', 'corrupt', 'cubicle', 'dweller', 'planet', 'will', 'regain', 'full', 'ownership', 'game', 'sins', 'past', 'wiped', 'away', 'single', 'stroke', 'ICE', 'signature.This', 'friends', 'genius']",The Shield: Season 7 - The Final Act

Durham ""Big Evil""","[29, 38]","Warning, spoilers ahead:In the seventh, and final, season of FX's The Shield, everyone gets just about what they deserve to one degree or another.  Whether it be crooked cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis), who is working overtime to save himself along with working every angle and playing every side he can in the process, or his ex-partner Shane (Walton Goggins), whose plan to take out Vic and Ronnie (David Rees Snell) goes awry, and when he is discovered, amounts to one of the absolute best scenes and moments in the show's entire history as he goes on the run with his pregnant wife Mara (Michele Hicks).  In between all that, Vic's shaky alliance with Aceveda (Benito Martinez) hits a bump as he plays the Armenians, Mexicans, Salvadorans, and the Feds all against each other, as well as seeking immunity with the help of a shady agent (Laurie Holden), which leads to a powerful moment of Vic's admition of all the things he's done over the years in the season's penultimate episode.  Everything truly does come together as the episodes wind down to the end, and everyone gets what they deserve in the process.  There's some sub-plots abound that include Claudette's (CCH Pounder) failing health rearing its ugly head again, Dutch's (Jay Karnes) investigation of a possible up and coming serial killer, Dani's (Catherine Dent) attempting to keep her son out of Vic's reach, and Corrine's (Cathy Cahlin Ryan) betrayal of Vic.

1246079,A3U4VUSBJMR5KP,B0020TS5EM,Patrick A. Hayden,"[53, 54]","One thing about ""The Shield"" is how well the show holds up on multiple viewings.  It's probably because of the attention to detail and the numerous story arcs going on in any single episode.  This continues to be the case in the 7th and final season of the show.Season 7 finds Det. Vic Mackey, at the end of the line.  Season 6 finished with Vic walking out on his last chance to keep his job with the LAPD and making a deal with former police Captain, now wannabe-Mayor Aciveda to take down the crooked developer who has been bankrolling Aciveda's political career.  Meanwhile, Vic's strike team is beginning to come apart at the seams, all of their former bad deeds are bubbling to the surface, and on top of that Vic's ex-wife and daughter are terrified of him.  Vic's a dirty cop with a perverted sense of justice.  He thinks that if he can nail this crooked developer AND take down the Armenian mob, it will make up for all the horrible things he has done.The season plays out almost as a tragedy, and is the strongest season of the Shield since the powerful season 3.  Watching these episodes again, I'm most struck by the relationship between Dutch and Capt. Wymms.  Both actors do terrific work as seemingly the only people in the precinct who seem to care about Mackey's abuses, and the quest to bring him down strains them to the breaking point.The rest of the cast is solid as always.  David Rees Snell, who plays Ronnie Gardocki on the strike team, shows a whole lot more here than he has in the past.  But the real standouts are Michael Chiklis as Mackey, and Walt Goggins as his longtime best friend/failed protege Shane Vendrell.  Goggins is outstanding in the final episodes.  He's done horrible things and he can barely live with himself, yet he continues on to try and help his wife and children.The show ends in about the only logical place it could end.  The last three episodes in particular are shattering.  The writing, acting, and direction are all fantastic, and ""The Shield"" goes out on a highly satisfying and emotional peak.
