954146,A2AQG4XS7MJUB4,B000C05YG8,Daniel S. Cooter,"[2, 12]","I was very disppointed in this film, as it's inaccuracy is staggering.  The film starts out before Japan's surrender, while the emperor is living in a bomb shelter on the palace grounds; the movie shows a palace above this, but virtually all the palace buildings were destroyed during allied bombings, and weren't replaced until the '60s.  Then there is a scene of a cabinet meeting in which Hirohito tells the ministers that they will continue the war.  Here's were the film slips into fiction - it depicts the emperor going up to his bedroom, where he awaits the arrival of the occupying Americans.  No depiction or mention of the surrender, in which Hirohito played a vital role by recording and then broadcasting his surrender speech to the nation (and in which a group of hardliners tried to prevent it's broadcast).  It does seem the screen writer confused this speech with his deification renunciation.  In the film, it shows the emperor reaching this decision on his own, and then mentions that he recorded the speech for broadcast - in reality, the renunciation of his deity was something mandated by the US occupying forces, and he read out loud in a speech to the Diet (Japanese parliament).  The film does not portray the efforts by the Japanese government or statesmen to shield the emperor from responsibility for the war, or to preserve his place in the Japanese state.  The film depicts both Hirohito and McArthur as caricatures - I've read Hirohito had an unusual, stiff walk, but I don't recall ever reading that he continuously puckered his mouth like a fish out of water, as the film shows.

954151,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000C05YG8,mirasreviews,"[10, 12]","""The Sun"" is the third film in Russian director Aleksandr Sokurov's tetralogy about powerful political figures as they suffer personally from their poor decisions. The first two films were about Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Lenin. ""The Sun"" is about Hirohito, Emperor of Japan, just after the Japanese surrender in 1945. The Emperor (Issey Ogata) is under house arrest in a building on the grounds of the Imperial Palace while the Allies decide what to do with him. He is attended by a chamberlain (Shiro Sano) and an elderly manservant, who try to preserve his normal routine. He is briefed by his ministers on the state of the war effort, he studies marine biology, takes a nap, writes his son, sees a guest, and meets General Douglas MacArthur (Robert Dawson), Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, for the first time.The way Sokurov presents this series of events gives the impression that it all happened in one day. Looking closely, that is not explicit but implicit, though the events actually took place over the course of months. There is much debate over the degree to which the Emperor was in control of the Japanese military and therefore responsible, or not, for ""war crimes"". ""The Sun"" takes the view that was adopted by the United States and its Allies, and therefore by the Japanese, after the war: Hirohito was isolated, easily manipulated by those more ambitious than himself, and a bit clueless. He was just a figurehead, and the Allies wanted him to continue to be so as Japan recovered from the devastation of war. Presented this way, Hirohito seems a lot like King Louis XVI of France or Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.Sokurov paints Hirohito as a well-meaning fool who has an embarrassing nervous tick, is preoccupied with his interest in marine biology, and summons a scientist whose research institute has been destroyed to discuss the Northern Lights, all while Japan is in crisis and the Emperor must contemplate the implications of renouncing his divine origins. But Sokurov respects the Emperor, because he placed the future of his nation above his own pride. He surrendered. He did what was asked of him by his conquerors to smooth the transition to an occupied and new Japan. I suppose this would be true whether or not he was responsible for war crimes.The Emperor does everything with slow deliberation, which sets the film's pace. It's slow. Issey Ogata looks remarkably like Hirohito, though I don't know if the nervous tick is accurate. The content of  conversations between Hirohito and MacArthur is uncertain and may have been fictionalized. Although Ogata's performance is impressive, ""The Sun"" would not have much meaning were these not true events. So veracity is an essential component of the film's worth, and I don't think Sokurov was concerned with history so much as his impression of the Emperor's character at a time of crisis. The subdued, dreamy cinematography, also by Sokurov, is admirable, as is Ogata's portrayal, but I wouldn't take ""The Sun"" to be history.

Ogata's staggering performance as Emporer Hirohito is the film's pivot. Not a moment of exaggeration, mannerism or overstated camerawork. The interplay of a gloved hand, of light catching the lower rim of one eye, the regimented deep space of the palace, the ambient short-wave sound track in Hirohito's study as he jots off a haku - the list is long. An apocolyptic dream shakes him from a noonday nap. It's one of cinema's most impressive dream sequences, in keeping with the Emporer's biological passions. Later, he scans a print of Durer's,'Four Riders' which, when the camera pounces on him from behind, mysteriously enlargens so that Hirohito's head swims in its detail. As a sustained study of profound pathos, the film has no equal. The Emporer's Chaplinesque antics before the GI's cameras in his front garden are unspeakably humiliating. The annihilation of the Empire, and with it the sombre lifestyle, liberates him from the absurdly suffocating protocols that attended his deification. The film ends with him in hand with his wife, imprisioned in his palace, but 'free' to enjoy the pleasures of his children. As a raid on the inarticulate, a devastation, a change of beliefs, the abiding state of the Emporer's mind is evinced in his inability to speak.

954154,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000C05YG8,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 4]","***1/2Alexander Sokurov's austere, moody and claustrophobic chamber piece, ""The Sun,"" takes place in Tokyo in 1945, just as the victorious American forces are overtaking the city.  The focus of the film is on Emperor Hirohito (believed by his subjects to be a direct descendent of the Sun goddess Amaterasu ) who, holed up in a bunker in the royal palace, agonizes over how such an ignominious fate could have befallen his nation and his people - and the part he himself may have played in bringing that outcome about.Hirohito spends much of the first half of the film engaging in deep introspection and personal recrimination, blaming himself for having placed too much faith in the power of the Empire and for relying too heavily on the enthusiasm of the soldiers rather than properly equipping the army.  Meanwhile, he pores over old family photo albums as well as pictures of glamorous Hollywood stars of the time, suggesting that he clearly doesn't despise all things American, even if that nation has become the cause of his downfall.In the second half of the movie, Hirohito finds himself under house arrest, where his American captors ply him with wine and chocolate bars as they negotiate the terms of his surrender.  Then he's brought before General MacArthur himself, who treats the defeated emperor with outward politeness but inward condescension and dismissiveness.  The result is a subtle little game of cat-and-mouse in which two of the great figures of their time vie for position and power - both personal and diplomatic.A largely fictionalized, impressionistic account of historical events, ""The Sun"" is definitely an acquired taste.  Its subdued tone, spare settings and desultory pacing may be off-putting to some in the audience, and the acting by the American performers is amateurish in the extreme.  But there's a haunting quality to the film as well, as a man once convinced of his own infallibility, divinity and immortality is forced to face the fact that, like the rest of humanity, he has feet of clay - and finds what a truly liberating and unburdening thing that can be in the long run.",3,not for every taste but an interesting piece of historical fiction,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,2118,"['***1/2Alexander', 'Sokurov', 'austere', 'moody', 'claustrophobic', 'chamber', 'piece', 'Sun', 'place', 'Tokyo', '1945', 'just', 'victorious', 'American', 'forces', 'are', 'overtaking', 'city', 'focus', 'film', 'Emperor', 'Hirohito', 'believed', 'subjects', 'be', 'direct', 'descendent', 'Sun', 'goddess', 'Amaterasu', 'who', 'holed', 'up', 'bunker', 'royal', 'palace', 'how', 'such', 'ignominious', 'fate', 'could', 'have', 'befallen', 'nation', 'people', 'part', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'bringing', 'outcome', 'about.Hirohito', 'spends', 'much', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'engaging', 'deep', 'introspection', 'personal', 'recrimination', 'blaming', 'having', 'placed', 'too', 'much', 'faith', 'power', 'Empire', 'relying', 'too', 'heavily', 'enthusiasm', 'soldiers', 'rather', 'properly', 'equipping', 'army', 'Meanwhile', 'old', 'family', 'photo', 'albums', 'as', 'well', 'pictures', 'glamorous', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'time', 'suggesting', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'despise', 'things', 'American', 'even', 'nation', 'become', 'cause', 'downfall.In', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'Hirohito', 'house', 'arrest', 'where', 'American', 'captors', 'ply', 'wine', 'chocolate', 'bars', 'negotiate', 'terms', 'surrender', 'Then', 'brought', 'General', 'MacArthur', 'who', 'defeated', 'emperor', 'outward', 'politeness', 'inward', 'condescension', 'dismissiveness', 'result', 'subtle', 'little', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'two', 'great', 'figures', 'time', 'vie', 'position', 'power', 'personal', 'diplomatic.A', 'largely', 'fictionalized', 'impressionistic', 'account', 'historical', 'events', 'Sun', 'definitely', 'acquired', 'taste', 'subdued', 'tone', 'spare', 'settings', 'desultory', 'pacing', 'may', 'be', 'off-putting', 'audience', 'acting', 'American', 'performers', 'amateurish', 'extreme', 'haunting', 'quality', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'once', 'convinced', 'own', 'infallibility', 'divinity', 'immortality', 'forced', 'face', 'fact', 'rest', 'humanity', 'feet', 'clay', 'what', 'truly', 'liberating', 'unburdening', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'long', 'run']","The Sun Solntse  Il Sole  Le Soleil  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"
