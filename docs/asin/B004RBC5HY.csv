1426397,A1TPW86OHXTXFC,B004RBC5HY,"prisrob ""pris,""","[3, 3]","'Party Animals' is a BBC production of eight episodes that saw only one season. That is a shame,as I became familiar with the characters I liked their stories and the way it was told.This series reminded me of the US 'West Wing'. Young,energetic people in the place of power, assisting their bosses in their role in the big time, in this case 'Parilment'. The series MPs, advisors, researchers and lobbyists making their way through Westminster.  Scott Foster plays Andrew Buchan, a lobbyist on the Labour side who is becoming increasingly tired and burnt out protecting and informing the rich and infamous. He lives with his younger brother Danny, played by Matt Smith, who works as a researcher for Junior Minister Jo Porter played by Raquel Cassidy. Danny Has a crush on the newintern Kirsty MacKenzie, played by Andrea  Riseborough.Ashika Chandrimani, plays Shelley Conn, the  chief advisor to Shadow Minister James Northcote. they are having an affair, a risky prospect, no matter if he is married or not.&#34;The relationship between Scott and Danny feels, both are idealistic and take Fter their father who was a Labour Minister. Jo Porter is stressed with her job, her marriage and her child, and she brings this all to work, where Danny and Kirsty cater to her every whim. Politics in the office and on the big stage are well portrayed.The tone of Party Animals is that of work, drink, drugs and sex. this is a nicely scripted series with the characters' motivation at the forefront.  Scott Foster has a great deal of charisma, and I would bet he moves on quickly to some juicy parts. Shelly Conn is a superb actress as Matt Smith is an actor. These are young professionals with a career in front of them.I was intrigued with this first series and am sorry to read there will not be a series two. It may be the title 'Party Animals' was off-putting.Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-10-13",4,Young Politicos,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,1894,"[""'Party"", 'Animals', 'BBC', 'production', 'eight', 'episodes', 'saw', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'shame', 'became', 'familiar', 'characters', 'liked', 'stories', 'way', 'was', 'told.This', 'series', 'reminded', 'US', ""'West"", 'Wing', 'Young', 'energetic', 'people', 'place', 'power', 'assisting', 'bosses', 'role', 'big', 'time', 'case', ""'Parilment"", 'series', 'MPs', 'advisors', 'researchers', 'lobbyists', 'making', 'way', 'Westminster', 'Scott', 'Foster', 'Andrew', 'Buchan', 'lobbyist', 'Labour', 'side', 'who', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'tired', 'burnt', 'out', 'protecting', 'informing', 'rich', 'infamous', 'younger', 'brother', 'Danny', 'played', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'who', 'researcher', 'Junior', 'Minister', 'Jo', 'Porter', 'played', 'Raquel', 'Cassidy', 'Danny', 'crush', 'newintern', 'Kirsty', 'MacKenzie', 'played', 'Andrea', 'Riseborough.Ashika', 'Chandrimani', 'Shelley', 'Conn', 'chief', 'advisor', 'Shadow', 'Minister', 'James', 'Northcote', 'are', 'having', 'affair', 'risky', 'prospect', 'matter', 'married', 'not.', '34', 'relationship', 'Scott', 'Danny', 'feels', 'are', 'idealistic', 'take', 'Fter', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'Labour', 'Minister', 'Jo', 'Porter', 'stressed', 'job', 'marriage', 'child', 'work', 'where', 'Danny', 'Kirsty', 'cater', 'whim', 'Politics', 'office', 'big', 'stage', 'are', 'well', 'tone', 'Party', 'Animals', 'work', 'drink', 'drugs', 'sex', 'nicely', 'scripted', 'series', 'characters', 'motivation', 'forefront', 'Scott', 'Foster', 'great', 'deal', 'charisma', 'would', 'bet', 'quickly', 'juicy', 'parts', 'Shelly', 'Conn', 'superb', 'actress', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'actor', 'are', 'young', 'professionals', 'career', 'front', 'them.I', 'was', 'intrigued', 'first', 'series', 'am', 'sorry', 'read', 'there', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'series', 'two', 'may', 'be', 'title', 'Animals', 'was', 'off-putting.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '02-10-13']",N/A
1426398,A2K3ZJWLF0V4K,B004RBC5HY,"Rachel Holland ""miribeau""","[1, 1]","This series, to put it plainly, is brilliant. It showcases a young cast of talented and dedicated actors, all of whom have impressed in other projects and all of whom stand in my mind for this work above all others, even Matt Smith, and I love Doctor Who so that is saying something. His doctor is my favorite, yes, my favorite, of all of them, even the black and white Doctors I remember from childhood in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep and snuck to the living room for that buzzing static and brightly lit solace (with no remote). Even so, when all is said and done, it is Danny Foster I think of first for this actor.The premise is simple, two brothers, as in the greatest of stories, two brothers, raised on politics by an office-holding father who set the bar so high and then did the worst thing a father can do: died. Danny (Smith) and Scott (Andrew Buchan of Broadchurch and the best Jane Eyre adaptation in history, the 2006 White, Welch and Wilson version) live together and work for the same political goals as their father did, in very different ways. Scott is a lobbyist and Danny is a researcher (basically a Congressional assistant for us Americans). They work hard and make mistakes and fall on their faces and get back up because they want so desperately to be important in their cause, to fight and make it happen, whatever the issue happens to be, and they care, too much, about the political wheels and the spin and turnabout and the rhetoric and the regime.They each have lives, love interests and friends, or so it seems but the goal of this too short-lived political drama, as seen from the very first moment, is that their lives, their loves, their friends, even their family, in all ways, at all times, are part of the political process. There is no out for either of them and political service exacts a price, often too high to pay. The supporting cast, what I consider anyone other than Smith and Buchan, is a beautifully selected group of talent including Raquel Cassidy and Shelley Conn and, though they share near equal screen time to the boys, it is the boys and the tale of their struggles that keeps you glued to the screen for this one. I watched this in two days, with work and familial obligations, two days. I typically hate drama. I typically hate politics, having been very much like these boys in my youth. I typically hate anything without lots of violence or sex or spaceships, yet, somehow, I love this show. It is raw and real and beautiful and painful and loving and hateful and so much like those films I remember from the eighties about newsrooms and political scandals and congressmen and presidents and senators and teenage interns and lies and truths and manipulations and clear consciences.I highly recommend this program to anyone to enjoys drama, political drama, family drama, or basically anything that airs after 9pm that isn't about or filmed for children. Give it a try. Really. It is that good.
