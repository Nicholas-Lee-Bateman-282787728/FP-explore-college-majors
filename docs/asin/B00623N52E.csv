1508507,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,B00623N52E,A_Plain_Janeite,"[17, 17]","First off I already own seasons 1-5 that I purchased on eBay, and I wholeheartedly give a 5 star rating for each season!  The main reason for this review is to give a heads up for potential buyers, because I'm seeing 2 different problems/complaints in these reviews.First, if you are in North America, make sure the disc you are buying states ""NTSC (or Region 1)"".  If it says PAL (Region 2), you dvd player likely won't be able to play it (unless it's region free).  The covers will be different than the original Canadian releases, and will likely have a triangle or round rating on the front cover.Second, if there's an orange bar across the top of the cover that states ""GMCTV/UP TV"" that is the US release, and is NOT the true ""complete season""-- as aired in Canada on CBC network!Here's the deal with GMCTV/UPTV.  Because the US will always be behind in the way they can air seasons here (which is about a season and a half behind CBC, the Canadian network that airs it), these US TV release sets will likewise be the same way.I made the mistake of buying ""the complete season 2 (GMCTV)"" release, only to find out it was Season 2 Episodes 10-18 to Season 3-Episodes 1-14.  So if you find ""Complete Season 3 (GMC TV/UP TV)"", would be the last 4 episodes of season 3, and probably up to episode 14 of season 4.I suggest that if you want the true seasons as aired in Canada, that you avoid any dvd package that has ""GMCTV/UP TV"" bar at the top.  You can refer to Amazon.ca and look at the listings to verify what the true cover looks like.  If you don't want to buy directly from there, check eBay!  (Or be doubly sure that the item on Amazon US states ""NTSC/Region 1"".)  That's what I ended up doing.  I actually bought season 1-5 as a package deal from a vendor there.  They may be lumping 1-6 together once it's released.  This year the dvd release is about a month later, being the season 7 premier is later (likely due to the flooding in the area back in June, which probably affected production time).  This Sunday Oct. 6th, is when the first episode of 7 airs (CBC network).  And the season 6 set will be released Oct. 15th.One final note of caution is that the discs so far released are NOT high-def/blu-ray quality.  There is graininess to the picture, especially seen in low light scenes.For the most up to date information on the series, go to:  cbc.ca/heartland/ , or the official FB page:  facebook.com/cbcheartlandAnyway, hope this helps everyone!",5,"BUYER BEWARE, Please Read On!
