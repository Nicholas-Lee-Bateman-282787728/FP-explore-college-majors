568922,A2JJBGVMLHNEYG,B000056BRR,"Eileen E. Freeman ""Sister Elias Freeman, OSB.Sol""","[1, 2]","(This review is also a plot spoiler.) ""Sudie and Simpson"" is a rare movie. It takes place in a poor, small southern town during World War II, a town firmly entrenched in the racist beliefs of that era. At the borders of the town, street signs not only  contain the usual information, but a dire warning as well: ""N-gg-r, don't let your face be seen in our town after dark."" Sudie is on the edge of puberty, and she still hovers between intense curiosity about the world and a childlike desire to dive into a secret world where she can play and forget the privations of a world at war. Seeking that fantasy, she wanders into a secluded area at the edge of town where an old wooden house still stands abandoned. But this time, she notices that a garden has been planted, and she smells tobacco. To her amazement, a man with black skin and hair very different from her own is hoeing. Curious rather than afraid, she comes up behind him and startles him into fearful wariness by asking, ""Mister, are you a n-gg-r?"" She had never seen one before.Simpson is angry that anyone has found him out, just when he had found a place where he could live without anyone knowing. But Sudie's intense curiosity about him, and her promise never to tell anyone about him, ease his fears somewhat. The two develop a strange friendship built on Sudie's innocence and total lack of prejudice and Simpson's sad experiences as a Black man who had once been a husband and father until a tragedy destroyed everything he once believed in.Sudie watches and listens--and begins to learn about life and inequality. The denouement involves a younger girl who goes missing. When she is found, it is clear that she has been sexually molested--but by whom? The men of the town, who know of Simpson by now, decide that he must have done this awful deed, simply because he is Black. They gather in the schoolyard to plan how to catch him and ""string him up"" when Simpson himself arrives, together with the white man he works for, a man more reasonable than the people of Sudie's town. Without even a word, the mob of bigots head for Simpson to kill him, but Simpson's voice stops them for a moment. He urges Sudie to tell the men the name of the child molester (""Tell the truth and shame the Devil,"" he whispers.) The real criminal--who, as it turns out, has been molesting many girls, including Sudie and her friends, is a respected teacher in the school. (As Sudie says to a girlfriend, ""He gives me fifty cents to wiggle his 'thing.'"") With the eyes of all the town upon her for the first time in her life, Sudie is confused and fearful, knowing that Simpson's life is at stake, but knowing that something terrible might also happen to her if she tells the whole town, including her mother, that she has made friends with a ""Negro."" What happens next is amazing.""Sudie and Simpson"" is not merely about racism and sex crimes. The real beauty of the film is the genuine love and friendship that grows between the two unlikely characters. Simpson's grief over the family he lost is healed by Sudie's total acceptance of him; Sudie's alienation from her own family, and her inner conflicts about the teacher who was also molesting her, are healed through Simpson's caring love that overcomes his fear of being discovered. The town's spiritual ugliness is finally brought into the light.I bought this movie because Lifetime is no longer airing it. And despite the subplot, the movie contains no sexual scenes or language, ""out of context"" foul talk, and no physical violence. Unless you must have action-packed adventures, computer-created monsters, sex, and every four-letter word in creation, please make room in your heart for this gem of a sleeper.",5,Innocence and experience challenge a racist town and are changed as well,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,3714,"['review', 'also', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'Sudie', 'Simpson', 'rare', 'movie', 'place', 'poor', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'town', 'firmly', 'entrenched', 'racist', 'beliefs', 'era', 'borders', 'town', 'street', 'signs', 'not', 'only', 'contain', 'usual', 'information', 'dire', 'warning', 'as', 'well', 'N-gg-r', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'face', 'be', 'seen', 'town', 'dark', 'Sudie', 'edge', 'puberty', 'still', 'hovers', 'intense', 'curiosity', 'world', 'childlike', 'desire', 'dive', 'secret', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'play', 'forget', 'privations', 'world', 'war', 'Seeking', 'fantasy', 'secluded', 'area', 'edge', 'town', 'where', 'old', 'wooden', 'house', 'still', 'abandoned', 'time', 'garden', 'been', 'planted', 'tobacco', 'amazement', 'man', 'black', 'skin', 'hair', 'very', 'different', 'own', 'hoeing', 'Curious', 'rather', 'afraid', 'up', 'fearful', 'wariness', 'asking', 'Mister', 'are', 'n-gg-r', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'before.Simpson', 'angry', 'anyone', 'found', 'out', 'just', 'when', 'had', 'found', 'place', 'where', 'could', 'live', 'anyone', 'knowing', 'Sudie', 'intense', 'curiosity', 'promise', 'never', 'tell', 'anyone', 'ease', 'fears', 'somewhat', 'two', 'develop', 'strange', 'friendship', 'built', 'Sudie', 'innocence', 'total', 'lack', 'prejudice', 'Simpson', 'sad', 'experiences', 'Black', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'husband', 'father', 'tragedy', 'destroyed', 'everything', 'once', 'believed', 'in.Sudie', 'watches', 'listens', 'learn', 'life', 'inequality', 'denouement', 'younger', 'girl', 'who', 'missing', 'When', 'found', 'clear', 'been', 'sexually', 'molested', 'whom', 'men', 'town', 'who', 'know', 'Simpson', 'now', 'decide', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'awful', 'deed', 'simply', 'Black', 'gather', 'schoolyard', 'plan', 'how', 'catch', 'string', 'up', 'when', 'Simpson', 'together', 'white', 'man', 'man', 'more', 'reasonable', 'people', 'Sudie', 'town', 'even', 'word', 'mob', 'bigots', 'head', 'Simpson', 'kill', 'Simpson', 'voice', 'moment', 'Sudie', 'tell', 'men', 'name', 'child', 'molester', 'Tell', 'truth', 'shame', 'Devil', 'real', 'criminal', 'who', 'out', 'been', 'molesting', 'many', 'girls', 'including', 'Sudie', 'friends', 'respected', 'teacher', 'school', 'Sudie', 'girlfriend', 'fifty', 'cents', 'wiggle', ""'thing"", 'eyes', 'town', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'Sudie', 'confused', 'fearful', 'knowing', 'Simpson', 'life', 'stake', 'knowing', 'something', 'terrible', 'might', 'also', 'happen', 'whole', 'town', 'including', 'mother', 'made', 'friends', 'Negro', 'What', 'next', 'amazing', 'Sudie', 'Simpson', 'not', 'merely', 'racism', 'sex', 'crimes', 'real', 'beauty', 'film', 'genuine', 'love', 'friendship', 'two', 'unlikely', 'characters', 'Simpson', 'grief', 'family', 'lost', 'healed', 'Sudie', 'total', 'acceptance', 'Sudie', 'alienation', 'own', 'family', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'teacher', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'molesting', 'are', 'healed', 'Simpson', 'caring', 'love', 'fear', 'being', 'discovered', 'town', 'spiritual', 'ugliness', 'finally', 'brought', 'light.I', 'bought', 'movie', 'Lifetime', 'no', 'longer', 'airing', 'subplot', 'movie', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'language', 'context', 'foul', 'talk', 'physical', 'violence', 'must', 'have', 'action-packed', 'adventures', 'computer-created', 'monsters', 'sex', 'four-letter', 'word', 'creation', 'please', 'make', 'room', 'heart', 'gem', 'sleeper']",N/A

The little girl's belief system that she had been taught by adults began to clash with the reality around her.  Things were just not adding up and she came to a point in her life early where she would have to decide to hold on to old misconceptions as truth or to let them go, such as girls bodies were evil and were the cause of a man to lust and to do wrong things as well as the lies that she was taught about the black race.

MANY MANY MANY times I almost turned it off, but I made it to the end.  The IGNORANCE of racists in the film is just plain SICKENING.  To me, this almost ranks right up there with 'Mandingo', namely because the same IGNORANCE is shown here in the year 1940?!?!?  I could &#34;stomach&#34; this content much better had it been 1840....but not 1940.  74 years ago is not nearly long enough ago to forgive this kind of racial intolerance and ignorance.  The children in this movie can be forgiven.  They are children who have been taught such trash.  But, the adults is what made me want to vomit.  I read a review that said you had to be &#34;thick-skinned&#34; to watch this.  Well, let me tell you......they were right on the mark!  So, I guess I am NOT thick-skinned enough to EVER watch this movie again.  It is a good movie, I grant you that.  But, FOR ME.....once is enough.  I can't stomach this kind of racism and ignorance.  &#34;Remember that it's in 1940?  REALLY?  MY MOTHER (who is STILL alive) was born in 1941!&#34;  The realization of that fact is what settled in for me.  And, that's what made this movie, not only sickening (because of the content), but SCARY!  If you can put this type of ignorance in a place that doesn't bother you, go for it.  Me?
