1511085,A3CFJT9CYLLSA0,B0066O104Y,Archaic Tears,"[3, 9]",how can someone justify charging $40 for 6 episodes of the most convoluted crap I have ever watched in my life. I consider myself a person who will give just about any anime a try. mecha/fantasy being one of my favorite genres in anime. the story here was not spectacular nor was it even close to keeping me captivated. It jumped from plot point to alternate plot point so much I felt as if I were watching a hyper active group of people go nuts on me through the tv screen. There was no time to even grow any sort of sentimental attachment or liking of ANY of the characters in the story because things were paced SO poorly! Art wise I was less than impressed. The cover art made this out to be something beautiful and tragic promising something fun and action packed. What I got was a pretty cover with no innards. How frustrating!!! Where has the taste gone? Is anime dead? I miss the days where story still mattered.I am an avid collector of anime and after watching this I no longer feel the same passion or regard for this hobby which I have been pursuing since I was but a teenager. I find myself going back to old school classics like Neon Evangelion and Akira. At least as insane as the plots were for these sci-fi animes they for the most part held my interest and challenged my attention span. Broken Blade could not even keep me awake. I would recommend this anime to someone who has trouble sleeping. This anime is guaranteed to knock you out cold. If you make it to the end like I somehow managed to do the ending will absolutely PISS YOU OFF. One commenter stated that the ending left it open for future episodes. I say don't bother let this thing burn in a fire.

I highly recommend. It has a great story and the dubbing is well done. For any fans of action and/or mecha anime, this is a must. The series is very gritty and real, not overly glamorized or fake looking. The battle scenes are intense and will keep you at the edge of your seat. It does star off slightly slow but by the second mini movie and onwards it goes barreling through with little filler or anything to get in the way of the main plot.

1511088,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B0066O104Y,Coulter Rail,"[2, 2]","I'm not normally a ""mecha fan,"" with the exception of Evangelion, Code Geass, and Gurren Lagann. I picked up Broken Blade because I thought the designs and battle animation looked promising. It's six episodes long, with each episode being longer than the norm (45 min).***PROS***MECH DESIGN/BATTLE ANIMATIONThe mech's look great. They have a more realistic appearance than most: They're covered in dings and scrapes, and their movements give the welcome and much-needed impression of weight/gravity. The battles in the beginning are somewhat plain (focusing on familiarizing the audience with their projectile weapons, which fire steel spikes). But once they move on to close-quarters combat, the show starts to shine and flex some intensity. If you like long battles that don't start and end with a single attack, then this series is for you. These things take a beating, and the pilots must use strategy to achieve victory. The final boss battle consumes an entire episode. Thank you.***CONS***STORYEveryone in this story uses a power called ""magic"" (I know, what a concept) to move all items considered technology, from toasters to robots. Our hero can't use magic (he's special), but at least they've unearthed an ancient mech that no one except our protagonist can use. He's reluctant to pilot it and doesn't want to fight in a war, as he's a pacifist at heart. Sound familiar?  Because it's the base-level theme of every popular mecha anime. The goods news is they get that cliche out of the way in the first episode and MOVE ON. He pilots it and starts kicking ass, and the story changes gears. The politics and character motivations are simple. The princess makes some pathetic attempts at winning the heart and mind of a captive enemy by having sexy slumber parties, and the bonds between characters remain surprisingly thin. It's not bad, but it's not good either.LENGTHThis story could be told in two hours (instead of six). Otherwise, it needs to be an entire 26-episode series, wherein they could fully develop the characters, explore the world of nations they've created, and let their story mean more than it does.VOICESThe main character looks to be about 18, but his voice actor (English dub) sounds 10. It's jarring and takes a while to . . . no, you never get used to it.This is a decent mecha anime. The combat is fresh and rewarding. There are some intense battles and a mildly entertaining story. There just needed to be either more or less. What they have here is adequate. Watch first, before you buy.I'm a writer and animator, so I'm constantly pouring through stacks of anime looking for gems of inspiration. If you find this review helpful, or our taste seem to align, follow along.

It's a very good story/character development driven anime, like The Vision of Escaflowne TV series. Yeah, you have the mecha battles and etc, but you also have just as much good character development and engrossing storyline as the mecha stuff. I think that's why I enjoyed this anime as much as I did. You get the same immersive experience when the mecha battles are going on as you do when the ""other stuff outside of the mecha stuff""(the human drama) is going on. So, you get the best of both worlds.Anyway, the blu-ray version gives you the full HD treatment. The video is presented in 16x9 aspect ratio and 1080p resolution, so if you have a nice HD TV, the visuals will be nice eye candy for you.

The series was not released all at once in Japan but over many months. Very similar in that respect to Katanagatari.How I would categorize this show is a dirty mecha. Mechs are not overly glamorized or well fashioned. Combat is brutal and they are not like others where they stand there and take punishment while looking cool. People do die and often in gory ways. While the camera cuts away on most of them, it leaves enough to the imagination where you'd know it would hurt.The storyline itself is about an invasion based on a need for Quartz. So, in other words, resources. But there is a lot of background to the plot that may slightly confuse you if you spend too long thinking about it. Resources isn't the only reason they are invading. Most of the answers are revealed during the course of the other films. A lot of bad blood has taken place between the nations and what makes it worse is that you have generations growing up believing lies and false history spread by the governments. You'll see this many times in the story.However, you will get to see both sides in the conflict, but it does favor the defender's position. Each of the characters involved have their own tale and despite focusing on the defenders more, you will get to see some of the other side. Enough to find characters you like on both fronts. Many backgrounds interconnect in this way.Overall, you'll find a great series here that gives mech combat more of a gritty feel. This series does have an ending, but it is open enough that you will hope they make more in the future.

Only the degrees are supposed to vary.  This means that everything from window shades to the mechanisms powering triggered is powered by ability and the stronger a person's ability, the stronger they are in battle. Sometimes a person is born without any ability at all, and they are looked down upon by most as useless. One's value will be proven, however, as battle consumes to countries.  In a kingdom struggling to survive, four friends find themselves approaching the conflict differently. One a king, the other his wife, the third on the other side of the conflict, and the fourth once considered useless now finding the most powerful weapon on the battlefield his to command.I really LOVE this show because it has so much to offer. It goes well beyond other mech shows, incorporating a level of detail i find refreshing. The characters are concise and the ideas are thought out, and the storyline is brilliantly detailed. It does not easily break down or descend into long bouts of melee, instead introducing characters and having them face struggles that stretch into and beyond battle.This is not to say that the fighting in the series in not beautiful, because it is. The mechs are powered by a center-based driver tucked in what essentially amounts to the stomach, and horrible things sometimes happen to them or to foot soldiers as they struggle to stay alive. One theme that is constantly reinforced is that the defending force is at a disadvantage technology-wise and the mechs show that, with differences in their designs of functions or pilot-based response. they also have strengths and limitations, and the show focuses on those by brilliantly focusing on them in ways that does not take away from the action. It seems hard for most shows to do, but Broken Blade pulls it off time and again.A lot of time is also devoted to the the core friendship that has developed between the four characters, each of them attending military school together but facing reality beyond the school walls. The queen and her feelings for the one who left, the friend forced to battle the other friend; there's so much detail and it never clutters the pace. Along with that is the time spent showcasing different pilots on each side, so you do not pick a side and think ""this is the good guy."" Both have their reasons for struggle, one is just being invaded. when someone dies, and they do often, there is stunning in some way because the show dedicated time to let you know them.If you get this, I recommend BluRay because of the crisp picture and clarity. The sound is superb compared to the SD. I watched both and the difference is noticeable. that said, SD is not bad at all, looking both nice and detailed. Either is a good watch, I just recommend bluRay.

I really enjoyed this 6 part movie their is good story good charactor development the story starts with a boy named rygod he gets summoned by the king of his nation to pilot a new mecha that he uncovers but it also turns out that he and the king and queen are good friends. One thing i would like to say is that i'am so glad that hollywood is not the only choice for movie making. The japanese film industy and the indepentent film industies can also make really good films as well. through it seems that indie films have gotten more popular it would be nice to see more people give them a chance. Because they do not know what their missing,5,a mechwarriors dream come true,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,764,"['anyone', 'who', 'wished', 'was', 'mechwarrior', 'style', 'movie', 'look', 'know', 'further', 'then', 'film', 'collection', 'really', 'enjoyed', '6', 'part', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'charactor', 'development', 'story', 'boy', 'named', 'rygod', 'summoned', 'king', 'nation', 'pilot', 'new', 'mecha', 'also', 'out', 'king', 'queen', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'One', 'thing', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'say', ""i'am"", 'so', 'glad', 'hollywood', 'not', 'only', 'choice', 'movie', 'making', 'japanese', 'film', 'industy', 'indepentent', 'film', 'industies', 'can', 'also', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'films', 'well', 'indie', 'films', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'popular', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'people', 'give', 'chance', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'missing']",N/A
