493232,A1U0U4650AMBPH,B0000065NH,"Sandi Tinker ""Belles""","[25, 26]","Richard's tapes are fun to do. There is a pretty steep learning curve, but  they are a blast once you get the routines down. This one includes (brief)  upper and lower body toning. The routine is fun and flows well. Don't  expect consistent mirror cueing though. That's not Richard's strong point.  But if you're looking for support, enthusiasm, and real people (instead of  hard bodies), I highly recommend Richard's aerobics tapes and especially  this one (and Dance Your Pants Off for more advanced exercisers). I'd rate  this as good for Beginners to Intermediate.",4,One of my favorites,965001600,"07 31, 2000",2000,568,"['Richard', 'tapes', 'are', 'fun', 'do', 'pretty', 'steep', 'learning', 'curve', 'are', 'blast', 'once', 'get', 'routines', 'down', 'one', 'brief', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'toning', 'routine', 'fun', 'well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'consistent', 'mirror', 'cueing', 'not', 'Richard', 'strong', 'point', ""'re"", 'looking', 'support', 'enthusiasm', 'real', 'people', 'instead', 'hard', 'bodies', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Richard', 'aerobics', 'tapes', 'especially', 'one', 'Dance', 'Pants', 'more', 'advanced', 'exercisers', ""'d"", 'rate', 'good', 'Beginners', 'Intermediate']",Sweatin' to the Oldies 2: An Aerobic Concert with Richard Simmons VHS
