They teach patterns, numbers, colors and it is done is such a fun way that they don't realize their learning!  ""Umigames"" is a DVD that features its main episode being an Olympics of sorts for Team Umizoomi.  It was the perfect episode to get my boys thinking about summer sports!  Next up is three more episodes with more Team Umizoomi fun!  It is an hour and a half and perfect to watch all the way through or an episode here and there.

The DVD features a new episode called the Umigames, it's a nice Olympics themed episode and one my kids hadn't seen yet. Also included are three older episodes: Boardwalk Games, Carnival, and Crazy Skates (which my 2 year old loves). Team Umizoomi is the only show on Nick Jr which still holds my 5 year olds' attention. I'm not much for justifying my children's tv time by calling it ""educational"" but there are REAL math skills to be learned on this show, from counting by 10's to pattern recognition.
