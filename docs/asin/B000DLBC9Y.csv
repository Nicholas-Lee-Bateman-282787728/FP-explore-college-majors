But as said by another reviewer (whose star rating seems to have slipped if you look at its title), it is a rare film (and rarer in Aussie) about blokes dealing with those bloody awkward things of emotions, loss, grief and brotherly rivalry. What I liked about this film is the sizzling, bleached light quality of a lot of the shots. OK other than those dingy, faded, mothballing interior ones. I guess what I am at is that the cinematography kept pace with the story which turned out to be a cracker all round. Great acting, understated and then over big in drama as the boys manoeuvred their balls in and out of shot. It is not feel good cinema. Not rinky/dinky Aussie humour but Jackman as the tortured Wace, bless him, is exceptional. Marty Dennis as younger brother Barky is an impressive foil playing emotional catch up with you can't know what you were not told. This deserves a place in the same bracket as Ray Winstone in ""War Games"". Not for the faint of heart but worth the watch and absorb.",4,Hugh Jackman before the wolfman bit him a man cave story from Oz,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,1151,"['Living', 'close', 'Erskineville', 'well', 'lot', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'Newtown', 'Sydney', 'picked', 'up', 'flea', 'market', 'not', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'said', 'reviewer', 'star', 'rating', 'have', 'slipped', 'look', 'title', 'rare', 'film', 'rarer', 'Aussie', 'blokes', 'dealing', 'bloody', 'awkward', 'things', 'emotions', 'loss', 'grief', 'brotherly', 'rivalry', 'What', 'liked', 'film', 'sizzling', 'bleached', 'light', 'quality', 'lot', 'shots', 'other', 'dingy', 'faded', 'mothballing', 'interior', 'ones', 'guess', 'what', 'am', 'cinematography', 'kept', 'pace', 'story', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'cracker', 'round', 'Great', 'acting', 'understated', 'then', 'big', 'drama', 'boys', 'manoeuvred', 'balls', 'shot', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'cinema', 'Not', 'rinky/dinky', 'Aussie', 'humour', 'Jackman', 'tortured', 'Wace', 'bless', 'exceptional', 'Marty', 'Dennis', 'younger', 'brother', 'Barky', 'impressive', 'foil', 'playing', 'emotional', 'catch', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'not', 'told', 'place', 'same', 'bracket', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'War', 'Games', 'Not', 'faint', 'heart', 'watch', 'absorb']",Erskineville Kings
