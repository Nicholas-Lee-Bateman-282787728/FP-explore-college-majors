This is quite an interesting situation where he is literally fighting for his life and a couple of times it looks like he definately won't make it.  The ending was a little silly because I don't know why his wife would be hunting him down so late, why didn't she try sooner to contact him.

We have to take their word that they were successful.  The movie, but for too many flashbacks, takes place in a parking garage of undetermined levels.

Preposterous to the nth degree, very little makes sense.

He's totally new to me but he had the star role and he literally ran with it.Of course there are a few holes in the plot--a man is trapped underground in a multi-level parking garage--and his enemy drives a truck to kill him--but this is forgiven given the overall excellence of production and performances.One fault were the flashbacks that interrupted the tension. Also, why didn't our hero just walk up to the main entrance and wait for a car--or, were all the fire alarms out of order?In any case, this was a fun two hours of tension and excitement and now I'm going to see what other movies Grayson McCouch is in so I can check him out.

Writer/director James Seale sets up a labyrinthine plot which keeps the audience guessing on who is driving the nasty truck.  Grayson McCouch gives a visceral, masculine performance as our hero, a would be thief who finds himself trapped in a parking garage with a demented truck driver.  Numerous flashback sequences give us plenty of suspects, and the villian's identity comes as a bit of a surprise,which is to Seale's credit.

There's almost no budget, no one of name in it, and still the movie has you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Throttle was very entertaining and did a lot with what little they had. A businessman, leaving work finds himself stuck, in the basement of a parking garage, with nowhere to go, and a killer on his tale. It's a definite thrill ride, albeit a very predictable one. I'm no super sleuth, but I had the killer pegged within the first 25 minutes. The acting, is what you'd expect in these types of films. Some were pretty good, while others were terrible. The lead, Grayson McCouch was great. He doesn't have much under his belt, but if he keeps putting on performances like this one, it won't be long until everyone knows his name.

908397,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0009ML2V0,trebe,"[0, 0]","Directed by James Seale, Throttle (2005) is an effective thriller, but one that requires you to accept a very unlikely premise.  If you can, you may find this strangely manipulative tale set in a parking structure, to be quite entertaining.Tom Weaver (Grayson McCouch) and his partner Gavin Matheson (Adrian Paul) are involved in a shady scheme to acquire millions.  Exactly what they are up to is not explained, but after executing their plan, Weaver has second thoughts.  After arguing with Matheson in the parking garage of their office building, he backs out of the deal.  An angry Matheson departs.  Weaver attempts to follow, but finds that his car has been sabotaged and won't run.  The doors and elevators have card readers, and Weaver who does not have his access card, finds himself ""trapped"" on the fifth level of the underground parking structure.In this situation, most rational people would simply walk out of the structure.  It may take a while, but you will eventually get out.  This obvious path is not taken, which allows this drama to continue.  Another key factor is the lack of cell phone service, which prevents Weaver from calling for help.Weaver is suddenly confronted by a SUV that attempts to run him down, but unbelievably outruns the vehicle several times.  Matters turn more deadly, when he asks a woman leaving in her car for assistance, while on Level 4.  Weaver is backed up against a wall and almost crushed by the SUV, but mysteriously his life is spared.  Snippets of Weaver's backstory keep unfolding in a series of flashbacks.  Bits and pieces are revealed, but the overall picture isn't very clear until near the end.The level of violence escalates, as Weaver's long strange journey through the almost empty structure continues.  Despite the ridiculous premise, and the cheap trick of obscuring the garage with mist, the film is successful at creating suspense, and generating genuine scares.  One is when Weaver manages to crawl on the roof of the mysterious SUV, only to have the sweat dripping from his nose onto the windshield, give his location away to the unseen driver, who then tries to fling him from the roof.Weaver should just continue on his way out, but on Level 3 he stops to ask for help, and again almost gets killed.  This guy is pure poison, as everyone he asks for help, winds up dead.  Still, it is kind of fun watching him bolt like a jackrabbit, continuing to outrun that SUV.Throttle is pretty well executed, and acted, featuring some decent cinematography, and nicely executed stunts, within the close quarters of the garage.  Grayson McCouch is quite entertaining as the hapless, continuously squinting, Tom Weaver.  Dan Mundell turns in a fun performance as Eddie the garage attendant.  There are some big problems, however.  Besides the utterly ridiculous premise, and completely idiotic overdramatic ending, the film has a basic problem with pacing.  Things just take way too long.  Tom Weaver arrives at his car about 1am, and finally reaches the garage entrance gate about 6am.  They should have tightened things up, five hours to navigate five levels is insanity.",3,"extremely shaky premise, but still an entertaining rabbit hunt . . .",1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,3132,"['Directed', 'James', 'Seale', 'Throttle', '2005', 'effective', 'thriller', 'one', 'accept', 'very', 'unlikely', 'premise', 'can', 'may', 'find', 'strangely', 'manipulative', 'tale', 'set', 'parking', 'structure', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining.Tom', 'Weaver', 'Grayson', 'McCouch', 'partner', 'Gavin', 'Matheson', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'are', 'involved', 'shady', 'scheme', 'acquire', 'millions', 'Exactly', 'what', 'are', 'up', 'not', 'explained', 'executing', 'plan', 'Weaver', 'second', 'thoughts', 'arguing', 'Matheson', 'parking', 'garage', 'office', 'building', 'deal', 'angry', 'Matheson', 'departs', 'attempts', 'follow', 'car', 'been', 'sabotaged', 'wo', ""n't"", 'run', 'doors', 'elevators', 'have', 'card', 'readers', 'Weaver', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'access', 'card', 'trapped', 'fifth', 'level', 'underground', 'parking', 'structure.In', 'situation', 'most', 'rational', 'people', 'would', 'simply', 'walk', 'structure', 'may', 'take', 'while', 'will', 'eventually', 'get', 'out', 'obvious', 'path', 'not', 'taken', 'drama', 'continue', 'key', 'factor', 'lack', 'cell', 'phone', 'service', 'calling', 'help.Weaver', 'suddenly', 'confronted', 'SUV', 'run', 'down', 'unbelievably', 'vehicle', 'several', 'times', 'Matters', 'turn', 'more', 'deadly', 'when', 'woman', 'leaving', 'car', 'assistance', 'Level', '4', 'Weaver', 'backed', 'up', 'wall', 'almost', 'crushed', 'SUV', 'mysteriously', 'life', 'spared', 'Snippets', 'Weaver', 'backstory', 'keep', 'unfolding', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Bits', 'pieces', 'are', 'revealed', 'overall', 'picture', ""n't"", 'very', 'clear', 'end.The', 'level', 'violence', 'escalates', 'Weaver', 'long', 'strange', 'journey', 'almost', 'empty', 'structure', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'cheap', 'trick', 'obscuring', 'garage', 'mist', 'film', 'successful', 'creating', 'suspense', 'generating', 'genuine', 'scares', 'One', 'when', 'Weaver', 'crawl', 'roof', 'mysterious', 'SUV', 'only', 'have', 'sweat', 'dripping', 'nose', 'windshield', 'give', 'location', 'away', 'unseen', 'driver', 'who', 'then', 'fling', 'roof.Weaver', 'should', 'just', 'continue', 'way', 'Level', '3', 'ask', 'help', 'again', 'almost', 'killed', 'guy', 'pure', 'poison', 'everyone', 'help', 'up', 'dead', 'Still', 'kind', 'fun', 'watching', 'bolt', 'jackrabbit', 'continuing', 'outrun', 'SUV.Throttle', 'pretty', 'well', 'executed', 'acted', 'featuring', 'decent', 'cinematography', 'nicely', 'executed', 'stunts', 'close', 'quarters', 'garage', 'Grayson', 'McCouch', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'hapless', 'continuously', 'squinting', 'Tom', 'Weaver', 'Dan', 'Mundell', 'fun', 'performance', 'Eddie', 'garage', 'attendant', 'are', 'big', 'problems', 'however', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'completely', 'idiotic', 'overdramatic', 'ending', 'film', 'basic', 'problem', 'pacing', 'just', 'take', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Tom', 'Weaver', 'car', '1am', 'finally', 'garage', 'entrance', 'gate', '6am', 'should', 'have', 'tightened', 'things', 'up', 'five', 'hours', 'navigate', 'five', 'levels', 'insanity']",Throttle
908398,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009ML2V0,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","`Throttle' (aka `No Way Up' begins effectively. It builds up the tension considerably in the opening 20 minutes, and then suddenly stops moving. It is a great pity that the film, of which actions are competently done, just couldn't keep the initial pace through its 90 minutes.It is one of the numerous clones of Spielberg's `The Duel,' but the film sets its location in underground car park, which is a very clever choice. One businessman Tom Weaver (reminding us of the name of leading actor in `The Duel') enters the underground parking lot around 12:00 pm, but he soon realizes that someone has designs against him. And in his case a truck (not monstrous, but still huge) chases him around the parking lot.There are several characters who might be seeking for the life of Tom. But the mystery part of the film, some of which are seen in the several flashbacks, is perfunctory (and probably unnecessary). The main attraction of the film is its stunts, and they are very good. The actors - Grayson McCouch as Tom, Adrian Paul as his business partner, and Amy Locane as Tom's wife - are all good, especially McCouch, who appears as slightly arrogant guy whose ego must be humiliated by the cat-and-mouse chase.But for all its great set-up, `Throttle' runs out of ideas pretty earlier than it should. You see, Tom is trapped in the underground space, and a truck chases him around. The cell phone is dead. The exits are all locked. Now, before you watch the film, you know there is little else for the film to do, and actually it has few options to choose. It tries to stretch the story by including several episodes, but none of them works. Flashbacks are boring, and the characters often act in the most unbelievable way, which only makes the running time unnecessarily longer. Why cannot Tom escape from the place when he encounters not less than three people after being attacked by the truck? Why doesn't he think of using a gun? I love watching action films, and I can stop disbelieving while enjoying them, but so many plot holes (and the black-outs which suggest we have to wait for the next action to begin for a while) are too much for me.`Throttle' starts very well, but soon runs out of gas.
