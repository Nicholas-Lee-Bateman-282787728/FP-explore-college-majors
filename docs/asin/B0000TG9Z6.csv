The same actors appear to be present, but I'm guessing that they have been replaced by emotionally-incapable robots with their charm programme removed.Instead of a plot, almost the entire movie is spent inside an extremely confusing computer game with incomprehensible rules, controlled by the evil Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone, what have you gotten yourself into?)  The robot battle scene was very imaginative, and also the bike race and the lava surfing, but having to watch it with 3D glasses spoiled the movie for me. I wear spectacles, and was unable to see the effects clearly while wearing both pairs.  Taking them off just made it worse, and the version I bought didn't have a 2D version included.Just for information, Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino only appear in this movie as cameos, as all the action centers around Juni (Daryl Sabara), Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Grandpa (Ricardo Montalban).  Small parts were adequately filled by Elijah Wood and Salma Hayek, and there are guest appearances by everybody who was in the first two movies.For fans of Alexa Vega, like my four year old son, there are some music videos in the extras that are worth a look.Not up to the standard of the first two Spy Kids movies.Amanda Richards, May 24, 2005",3,Unworthy,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,1394,"['way', 'earth', 'other', 'planet', 'dimension', 'matter', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'related', 'first', 'two', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'movies', 'same', 'actors', 'appear', 'be', 'present', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'emotionally-incapable', 'robots', 'charm', 'programme', 'removed.Instead', 'plot', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'spent', 'extremely', 'confusing', 'computer', 'game', 'incomprehensible', 'rules', 'controlled', 'evil', 'Toymaker', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'what', 'have', 'gotten', 'robot', 'battle', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'imaginative', 'also', 'bike', 'race', 'lava', 'surfing', 'having', 'watch', '3D', 'glasses', 'spoiled', 'movie', 'wear', 'spectacles', 'was', 'unable', 'see', 'effects', 'clearly', 'wearing', 'pairs', 'Taking', 'off', 'just', 'made', 'worse', 'version', 'bought', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', '2D', 'version', 'included.Just', 'information', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'only', 'appear', 'movie', 'cameos', 'action', 'centers', 'Juni', 'Daryl', 'Sabara', 'Carmen', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'Grandpa', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'Small', 'parts', 'were', 'adequately', 'filled', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'are', 'guest', 'appearances', 'everybody', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'movies.For', 'fans', 'Alexa', 'Vega', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'are', 'music', 'videos', 'extras', 'are', 'look.Not', 'up', 'standard', 'first', 'two', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'movies.Amanda', 'Richards', 'May', '24', '2005']",N/A

The cameos, the tongue in cheek humor, the gadgets... it was a nice alternative to some of the other kids movies out there. Then there was Spy Kids 3. Since there are already over a hundred reviews out here, I figure that you don't need me to rehash the plot synopsis.The general premise of the film was interesting enough. A villain in a computer has kidnapped Carmen & Juni has to go save her via a computer game. The film just didn't live up to my expectations. While I don't exactly expect intricate story lines in the Spy Kids flicks, this one was fairly weak in comparison to the previous two films in the series. The whole point of the film seemed to be to push the 3-D, which unfortunately wasn't very good. I know that 3-D during that time was limited & that a film in a theater can't compare to something seen in a theater specifically set up to play 3-D films, but the 3-D was bad in the theaters. It was even worse when I later purchased the DVD set to complete my collection. There just wasn't a lot of dimension to the 3-D & for the most part there was a lot of straining by all of us in an attempt to see the 3-D. (And in case you were asking, yes- the room was dark & we took every precaution to use the glasses & whatnot.)My nephews still liked the movie, but they didn't really love it as much as they did the first films, so in that aspect their opinions mirrored mine. I'd purchased this set in the week it was released & viewing it years later, the film really hasn't aged all that well. I would still recommend this to parents looking for something fairly wholesome to show to their kids. (There's some violence, but none of it is really all that bad in comparison to what most of them see in videogames & TV.)I would give this set 3 stars because the films were entertaining enough, but I had to lower it to 2 stars because the 3-D still stinks & without the 3-D, the film just isn't all that great.",2,A mediocre 3rd entry to an otherwise great series,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,1961,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'loved', 'Spy', 'Kids', '1', '2', 'cameos', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'humor', 'gadgets', 'was', 'nice', 'alternative', 'other', 'kids', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'Then', 'was', 'Spy', 'Kids', '3', 'are', 'already', 'hundred', 'reviews', 'here', 'figure', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'rehash', 'plot', 'general', 'premise', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'villain', 'computer', 'kidnapped', 'Carmen', 'Juni', 'go', 'save', 'computer', 'game', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'expect', 'intricate', 'story', 'lines', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'flicks', 'one', 'was', 'fairly', 'weak', 'comparison', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'series', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'push', '3-D', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'know', '3-D', 'time', 'was', 'limited', 'film', 'theater', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'something', 'seen', 'theater', 'specifically', 'set', 'up', 'play', '3-D', 'films', '3-D', 'was', 'bad', 'theaters', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'later', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'set', 'complete', 'collection', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'dimension', '3-D', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'lot', 'straining', 'attempt', 'see', '3-D.', 'case', 'were', 'asking', 'yes-', 'room', 'was', 'dark', 'took', 'precaution', 'use', 'glasses', 'whatnot', 'nephews', 'still', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'first', 'films', 'so', 'aspect', 'opinions', 'mirrored', 'mine', ""'d"", 'purchased', 'set', 'week', 'was', 'released', 'viewing', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'parents', 'looking', 'something', 'fairly', 'wholesome', 'show', 'kids', 'violence', 'none', 'really', 'bad', 'comparison', 'what', 'most', 'see', 'videogames', 'TV', 'would', 'give', 'set', '3', 'stars', 'films', 'were', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'had', 'lower', '2', 'stars', '3-D', 'still', '3-D', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'great']",N/A

The sequel was a homage to the monster movies of Ray Harryhausen. Rodriguez wraps everything up with Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, which addresses his love of video games.There is more style and imaginative visuals in the first ten minutes of this movie then the entirety of most kids' films. Rodriguez fills the screen with all kinds of details and with colourful objects zipping around in the background of scenes. This overload of visual stimulus invites repeated viewings just to catch all of the visuals that were missed the first time around. There is tons of eye candy that kids will love.The 3-D effects isn't just a gimmick that Rodriguez hangs the entire film on. They are an integral part of the story as much of the film takes place in a three-dimensional virtual world with objects flying out at the audience and pieces of scenery sticking out.Both 3-D and 2-D versions of the movie are available on the two DVDs with four pairs of 3-D glasses included.""Robert Rodriguez Ten Minute Film School"" continues his series of featurettes that show how elaborate effects or stunts were done simply and economically.Robert Rodriguez contributes a relaxed, informative audio commentary. He talks at length about how he creatively cut costs by building almost all of the film's sets on a computer. He also talks about his love of video games and how he realized long ago that they are addictive and how deeply kids can get immersed in them.""The Making of Spy Kids 3D"" is a twenty-minute look at how the film was made. There are the standard interviews with the cast and Rodriguez.""The Effects of the Game"" is a montage of footage showing how some of the fantastic computer effects were achieved set to music from the movie.There is a multi-angle feature that takes the surfing lava sequence from the movie and allows the viewer to switch between the original storyboards, green screen footage and the final finished product.Finally, ""Mega Race Set-Top Game"" allows the viewer to control a cyber bike from the movie and avoid obstacles on the track to win the race. This is a neat little feature but lacks true interactivity because it can be easily mastered once you memorize the sequence of moves needed to win.What makes the Spy Kids films work so well is that they tap into what kids fantasize about: being a famous super spy, fighting big creatures and being inside a video game. Spy Kids 3-D is a fitting conclusion to the series and Rodriguez has gone all out not only with the movie but also with a fantastic two-DVD set that is jam-packed with extras.",4,Visually Inventive and Lots of Fun!,1077580800,"02 24, 2004",2004,2738,"['When', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'made', 'first', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'film', 'was', 'goof', 'James', 'Bond', 'super', 'spy', 'movies', 'two', 'kids', 'finding', 'out', 'parents', 'are', 'internationally', 'renowned', 'spies', 'sequel', 'was', 'homage', 'monster', 'movies', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'Rodriguez', 'wraps', 'everything', 'up', 'Spy', 'Kids', '3-D', 'Game', 'Over', 'love', 'video', 'more', 'style', 'imaginative', 'visuals', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'then', 'entirety', 'most', 'kids', 'films', 'Rodriguez', 'screen', 'kinds', 'details', 'colourful', 'objects', 'zipping', 'around', 'background', 'scenes', 'overload', 'visual', 'stimulus', 'invites', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'just', 'catch', 'visuals', 'were', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'tons', 'eye', 'candy', 'kids', 'will', 'love.The', '3-D', 'effects', ""n't"", 'just', 'gimmick', 'Rodriguez', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'much', 'film', 'place', 'three-dimensional', 'virtual', 'world', 'objects', 'flying', 'out', 'audience', 'pieces', 'scenery', 'sticking', '3-D', '2-D', 'versions', 'movie', 'are', 'available', 'two', 'DVDs', 'four', 'pairs', '3-D', 'glasses', 'included', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'Ten', 'Minute', 'Film', 'School', 'series', 'featurettes', 'show', 'how', 'elaborate', 'effects', 'stunts', 'were', 'done', 'simply', 'economically.Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'relaxed', 'informative', 'audio', 'commentary', 'length', 'how', 'creatively', 'cut', 'costs', 'building', 'almost', 'film', 'sets', 'computer', 'also', 'love', 'video', 'games', 'how', 'realized', 'long', 'ago', 'are', 'addictive', 'how', 'deeply', 'kids', 'can', 'get', 'immersed', 'Making', 'Spy', 'Kids', '3D', 'twenty-minute', 'look', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'are', 'standard', 'interviews', 'cast', 'Rodriguez', 'Effects', 'Game', 'montage', 'footage', 'showing', 'how', 'fantastic', 'computer', 'effects', 'were', 'achieved', 'set', 'music', 'movie.There', 'multi-angle', 'feature', 'surfing', 'lava', 'sequence', 'movie', 'viewer', 'switch', 'original', 'storyboards', 'green', 'screen', 'footage', 'final', 'finished', 'product.Finally', 'Mega', 'Race', 'Set-Top', 'Game', 'viewer', 'control', 'cyber', 'bike', 'movie', 'avoid', 'obstacles', 'track', 'win', 'race', 'neat', 'little', 'feature', 'true', 'interactivity', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'mastered', 'once', 'memorize', 'sequence', 'moves', 'needed', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'films', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'tap', 'what', 'kids', 'fantasize', 'being', 'famous', 'super', 'spy', 'fighting', 'big', 'creatures', 'being', 'video', 'game', 'Spy', 'Kids', '3-D', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'series', 'Rodriguez', 'gone', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'also', 'fantastic', 'two-DVD', 'set', 'jam-packed', 'extras']",N/A

783084,A12SHC9IT3VZQG,B0000TG9Z6,Daniel Sweeney,"[2, 3]","First off, let me start by saying that I own all three Spy Kids movies and although I'm an adult male with no kids, I've seen the first one probably 5 times and the second one thrice...so I'm not a typical Spy Kids fan.  However, I am a big fan of Robert Rodriguez and his maverick style of filmmaking, as well as his films (particularly the Desperado films, which are about as opposite from Spy Kids as you can get).  Also, his DVD's are always loaded with tons of extras including commentary, behind the scenes footage, his &quot;10-minute Film School&quot; videos and other material.  So his films are always worth the DVD purchase.Aside from writing and directing his films, Rodriguez is also the cinematographer, editor, production designer, visual effects supervisor and producer.  Oh yeah, and HE ALSO WRITES THE MUSIC!!!  Because his films are made on ultra-tight budgets yet always reap massive box office, he enjoys creative freedom unheard of to anyone in the motion picture business not named George Lucas.  That's how he was able to make a 3-D film for kids.So what's the verdict?Well, when I first saw Spy Kids 3-D in the theater I was definitely underwelmed.  Perhaps I was sitting too close to the screen or maybe the picture was out of focus, but more than anything the 3-D gave me a headache and frequently I had to remove the glasses to give my eyes a rest.But a funny thing happened when I watched it again on DVD...IT WAS LIKE SEEING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME!  Thanks to the sharpness of DVD (they actually recommend you watch it on a computer monitor, which is higher quality), the 3-D effect was awesome!  In fact, after watching it I put in Spy Kids 2, and that movie immediately seemed weak in comparison to the dynamic 3-D effect of the third movie.Now some reviewers here have complained about the story, and they are right, it lacks the charm and wit of the other Spy Kids films.  However, as Rodriguez mentions in the commentary on the disc, this is largely due to the fact that it originally was not going to be a Spy Kids film...He set out to make a 3-D film for kids that would progress like a video game, and decided later to shoehorn that plot into a Spy Kids film.  And I think he succeeded...the movie advances very similarly to the way a video game advances through various levels of increasing difficulty.

I mean, let's just face it! The movies are getting worse by the minute! I wasn't too crazy about Spy Kids to begin with, and after the second movie, I tried to do a favor for myself and made a pact with myself never to see another Spy Kids movie voluntarily for as long as I live, but unfortuately, when I went to the movies with a couple of close friends, everything else was sold out except Game Over (I wonder why....), we wound up having to see it, and that was that.First off, the movie itself lacked......well, actually, it lacked everything, but most of all it lacked a good plot, humor, meaning, and good acting. Four things that, for the most part, every good movie needs.I mean, any moviemakers can make a crappy movie, throw in some 3-D, and make some money. Just the idea of 3-D makes people willing to spend the money to go see it, but that's a shame, because this movie isn't worth a cent to go see.After I realized the movie was a total dud, I looked around the theater to see other people's reactions to the movie. In the beginning of the 3-D part*, most little kids were transfixed on the screen, but 10 minutes into it, most kids were already wriggling and playing with their candy. Some people, both young and old, had taken their glasses off, and were either just watching it without them, or doing something else.* I forgot to mention earlier that not all of the movie is 3-D. Only about half is, maybe even less.So, in conclusion, this movie is a total waste of your time, effort, and money.

I mean the other two were smart and funny spy movies for kids and the whole family. This one, although it has it's fun moments is the weakest of the three films. The movie focuses too much on Juni Cortes this time around as he trys to rescue his sister from a  virtual video game world.Antonio Banderas and others only appear at the end of the movie. Which I don't think is that smart since the kids aren't the best actors to hold most of the movie by themselves. At least in the other two films it was about the whole Cortes family working together. Sylvester Stallone gets a decent ammount of screen time though as the villain. I actually liked his scenes where he argues with other virtual versions of himself. It sorta has a Terry Gillian (Time Bandits) style to it and I liked those scenes. Some people have called the movie too dark for kids but I totall disagree. I think this one mostly kids will like, probably more than their parents. I see it as mostly overly silly, I don't see it as dark at all. The visuals make the movie fun as well and you don't need tthe 3-D glasses to enjoy them because I didn't need them.

But, just like one of my other favorite movies 'SPEED' with our Matrix-man Keanu Reeves, this movie is flat-out fast-paced and fun. The 3D effects were completely unnecessary, but also a nice novelty. The ending went completely against the grain of the typical action flick.

783105,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B0000TG9Z6,"John ""MovieAddict""","[3, 4]","I think I would have enjoyed ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over"" a lot more if I had achieved a pair of 3-D glasses before seeing the film. Without them, nothing jumped out at me and the movie -- which is like one long, overdrawn theme park -- seemed rather pointless. For viewers with 3-D glasses, maybe it was a treat. But as a mainstream movie attempting to stay around for a while...well, it won't. Because it's just a long theme park ride -- and they get old after a while, especially when they're outdated.I enjoyed some scenes in ""Spy Kids 3-D."" It is a lot like a videogame, and does a good job of mimicking one. The visual effects are never very good, probably on purpose -- graphics in videogames, after all, are not yet truly realistic. But apart from successfully making us feel as if we are in a videogame, ""Spy Kids 3-D"" does little else. In fact, it plays out like a videogame very much -- sometimes in unintended areas.Of course, director Robert Rodriguez (""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"") is notorious for being fast-paced and furious. He is perfect for material such as this. It's just a question of whether we, as a viewer, can put up with one long 90-minute 3-D theme park ride/videogame imitation without taking part in the process. Videogames are, after all, essentially interactive -- they wouldn't be entertaining if we just watched the characters move about on the screen, which is exactly what happens here.Juni (Daryl Sabara) has retired from his family's spy agency and become a PI. Oh, yeah, forget school -- he has a steady job finding lost cats and toys. His career highlight is discovering why there's no water at a theme park for a little girl, who claims to be the owner. ""It's winter,"" he says.Juni is called back into action when his older sister, Carmen (Alexa Vega), has disappeared inside a videogame called Game Over, created by The Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone in an unthankful role), a maniacal modern-day Hitler bent on enslaving children across the world in his new never-ending videogame and thereby controlling the future fate of mankind. (Problem: how can life reproduce when all the world's children are attached to videogames? Never mind; I don't want to know.)Juni is briefed on his upcoming mission by a beautiful computer/videogame hacker, played by Salma Hayek, who is portraying a computer nerd but looks wholly different (she still has the little girl ponytails left over from ""Dogma""). Juni is sent into The Toymaker's new game in an attempt to shut down the system core before it goes live in a matter of hours, and every single child across the world plugs into the contraption (save those who can't afford or don't want to own such a thing, another obvious problem overlooked by the film).Inside he is befriended by a group of fellow Beta Testers (individuals who get to try out the game prior to release,) who call Juni The Guy, since he looks like the outline of the advertising figure printed on the videogame's cover art, who is destined to be the leader of the Beta Testers and who will unlock the secret of the ""unwinnable"" Level 5. This must be an ill-fated spoof on Keanu Reeves' The One, but the laughs never go anywhere. In fact, when the real ""Guy"" is finally revealed, it's none other than Elijah Wood, who survives two minutes before being booted out of the game. I appreciate the cameo, but wouldn't it have been a lot funnier to cast Keanu Reeves in the brief role? The thin parody of ""The Matrix"" would have been even clearer. In fact, I was half expecting Elijah to crouch down and call the group of children The Fellowship of the Game at one point.Antonio Banderas is given top billing in ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over,"" although fans of the actor will be disappointed to realize he shows up at the end of the movie to try and destroy The Toymaker's virtual self after he breaks out into the real world. (Question: how do computer programs take life form when the universe is not run by a computer processor? Hmm....) In fact, the real star of the show is Daryl, and that's unfortunate since the chubby little twerp has -- what film critics call -- absolutely no sense of screen presence whatsoever. The little guy can't act too well, either, especially when he's interacting with his fellow videogame testers and demonstrating his best materialization of the expression ""Bug-Eyed.""I'm being unfair. The movie has some good parts to it. Some. If you shut off your brain and do not try to follow the plot at all (which I realized halfway through is impossible since the longer the film runs the lesser the cohesion and common sense grow), you may find yourself enjoying the ride. I might have if I had been given 3-D glasses beforehand. But if you go into this film without some, the fact that it's just one long theme park ride marketed as a feature film becomes quite apparent.I liked the cameos and, to a certain extent, Robert Rodriguez' bright and vibrant visualization of the inside of a videogame matrix (though it has been done before -- remember ""The Lawnmower Man""?) Rodriguez can make good action movies. ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over"" is primarily a failure because it is nothing than one long overdrawn ride without a point. It's a good family film with morals, but it mimics what it is spoofing too much. It's nothing than a long videogame, only when you're not in control of what's happening, videogames are pretty dull. Why do you think no one likes to let their friends have a go on their game consoles?For Rodriguez, this series has just lost its third life. Game over.",2,This series has just lost its third life.

783117,A3SYT3JC9VH5UZ,B0000TG9Z6,Marina Michaels,"[0, 0]","The Spy Kids movies have always been a little over the top, and this one is no different. I don't mind over-the-top movies if they are done well; in fact, the over-the-topness is part of why they are so funny. From the start of this movie, with Juni playing a private eye in the style of the old Humphrey Bogart movies, I knew I was in good hands.The acting is quite good for the most part (with the exception of some actors who have very small parts toward the end; nothing important or movie-breaking), and some of the concepts are worth the price of admission alone, as it were, such as Sylvester Stallone playing four different versions of himself--including a fascist martinet, a nerdy scientist, and an aging love hippie. Whoo hoo! And for that matter, some of the outtakes in the closing credits were pretty funny, too.The basic story is that The Toymaker (Stallone) has created a virtual reality game that will take over the minds of all those who play it. Juni's sister has already tried to get into the game to stop it, but has (mentally) vanished inside. Juni's mission? Go inside the game, find his sister, and stop the game before it goes live.Of course, Juni accepts the challenge (another thing I love about the Spy Kids movies--the family whose members truly love and care for each other), but meets many obstacles along the way, including young beta testers who are jealous of their territory and get in his way as much as possible. Lots of action, lots of fun.I won't spoil the movie, though I will say there are some wonderful cameos (including one by Elijah Wood, best known to many as the actor who so wonderfully brought Frodo to life). George Clooney has a small but amusing role (and one laugh-out-loud outtake in the credits), as does the inestimable Ricardo Montalban. Alas, we see only a few seconds of Antonio Banderas, but that's okay--the rest of the movie and cast make up for it. (Though can anyone truly make up for the lack of Antonio Banderas?)I highly recommend this as a fun romp. Don't have high expectations of it as some kind of artsy film; it is pure entertainment, and proud of it.",4,Sheer entertainment,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,2123,"['Spy', 'Kids', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'little', 'top', 'one', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'over-the-top', 'movies', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'fact', 'over-the-topness', 'part', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'start', 'movie', 'Juni', 'playing', 'private', 'eye', 'style', 'old', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'movies', 'knew', 'was', 'good', 'hands.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'exception', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'small', 'parts', 'end', 'nothing', 'important', 'movie-breaking', 'concepts', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'were', 'such', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'playing', 'four', 'different', 'versions', 'including', 'fascist', 'martinet', 'nerdy', 'scientist', 'aging', 'love', 'hippie', 'Whoo', 'hoo', 'matter', 'outtakes', 'closing', 'credits', 'were', 'pretty', 'funny', 'too.The', 'basic', 'story', 'Toymaker', 'Stallone', 'created', 'virtual', 'reality', 'game', 'will', 'take', 'over', 'minds', 'who', 'play', 'Juni', 'sister', 'already', 'tried', 'get', 'game', 'stop', 'mentally', 'vanished', 'inside', 'Juni', 'mission', 'Go', 'game', 'find', 'sister', 'stop', 'game', 'live.Of', 'course', 'Juni', 'challenge', 'thing', 'love', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'movies', 'family', 'members', 'truly', 'love', 'care', 'other', 'many', 'obstacles', 'way', 'including', 'young', 'beta', 'testers', 'who', 'are', 'jealous', 'territory', 'get', 'way', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'Lots', 'action', 'lots', 'fun.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'wonderful', 'cameos', 'including', 'one', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'best', 'known', 'many', 'actor', 'who', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'brought', 'Frodo', 'life', 'George', 'Clooney', 'small', 'amusing', 'role', 'one', 'laugh-out-loud', 'outtake', 'credits', 'inestimable', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'Alas', 'see', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'okay', 'rest', 'movie', 'cast', 'make', 'up', 'can', 'anyone', 'truly', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fun', 'romp', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'kind', 'artsy', 'film', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'proud']",N/A
783118,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0000TG9Z6,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","So after two successful movies in this franchise where was director Robert Rodriguez going to go? How about in your face? Yes after the first two films the next logical step, especially since the newest 3-D craze was kicking off, was 3-D. And, as always, Rodriguez does it better than anyone.This time around we open with Juni now retired from the OSS and working as a private eye. But that all changes when he's called back in. It seems his parents are off on their own mission and his sister is being held captive inside a video game. Not physically captive but mentally. The only person with enough skill and knowledge to take on the game is Juni.The game itself called Game Over, was created by the Toymaster (Sylvester Stallone) and his main reason for creating it was to capture kids around the globe. It seems that anyone who can make it through the initial first four levels to the fifth is placed in a world of mind control there is no escape from. So Juni must get to level 4 where his sister Carmen is being held captive, rescue her and then the pair must shut down the game.Along the way Juni goes through various tests/games on each level and meets a series of other players as well. These are the beta testers, each one with a different function that will help Juni. One is smart, another strong and the last cool. This group picks up an additional helper later on when Juni faces off against another player named Demetra. He defeats her but she knows he'll need her help as the game progresses.With only so many lives to use getting through the game, Juni keeps finding himself losing them one by one. He does get a great assist though when he's allowed to call one person in to help him. His choice? His grandfather. While his grandfather is confined to a wheelchair in the outside world, here he has full function of all his limbs and abilities. He also brings something to the table Juni wasn't aware of. You see, it was the Toymaker who was responsible for grandfather being in the wheelchair to begin with.With a few twists in the story, an amazingly created world of combat for game players and in imagination that seems to know no bounds, Rodriguez has come up with the perfect film for 3-D. Rather than have the non-stop use of 3-D to have people poke their fingers at you from start to finish (though there are a few of those moments) he allows the special effects items in the film fly out. Splotches of goop and more fly at the camera. Now, the truth is I didn't watch this movie in 3-D as I don't have a 3-D television or blu-ray player. But you know when you see it what is and isn't 3-D. And with due respect, you can tell it would work well here.The cast does a great job as well and it's interesting to watch as the different young members have grown before our eyes. You get the feeling that Rodriguez thought this might have been the last of the series when you see various cast members from the other two films turn up, everyone from Alan Cumming to Bill Paxton. Each plays an important part in the films ending sequence.Had this been the last it would have been a fitting swan song. But it wasn't! There's a new SPY KIDS movie in theaters now (or just leaving depending on when you read this) that employs a new set of kids. The others return but have aged to the point where you couldn't quite call them kids anymore. If the series stays as creative and interesting as it has in the past, who knows how long it could go on? Perhaps as long as the James Bond series? Only time will tell. In the meantime we have at least the first three on hand in blu-ray format to enjoy.On an ending note to the reviews of this series, each one contains some great extras including Rodriguez' ""10 Minute Film School"" shorts that shows how he economically saved money on each film and came up with some fantastic effects that turned out better than if he'd used more money.

783137,A2MITD3KZ1BIQP,B0000TG9Z6,Sparky McShine,"[0, 0]","Another decent Spy Kids movie by Robert Rodriguez. This episode finds Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) drawn out of retirement to save his big sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) from the clutches of the Toymaker (Sly Stallone). The 3D is a good gimmick; it's been a long time since I've seen a new-release 3D movie.Spy Kids 3D is more or less a low-tech Matrix knockoff for kids. To his credit, director Rodriguez doesn't spend much time asking pseudo-profound ""what is reality"" type questions. Instead, he answers them. Juni's reality is that he needs to save his sister; he doesn't care at all whether he's in the ""real world"" or in a video game. In this movie, ""reality"" is relative. But when Juni gets to choose a family member to help him, he's sharp enough to realize that his grandfather (Ricardo Montalban), crippled by the Toymaker in ""real life,"" would therefore be his best choice in the ""virtual reality"" world.The movie maintains a pretty good pace throughout, distracting the viewer from the fact that a lot of it is pretty silly, and it makes up for its cold virtual-reality settings by ending with some syrupy-sweet messages about the value of family and forgiveness. The movie's major weakness is Juni himself. Daryl Sabara is just not yet a good enough actor to justify his appearance in almost every frame. The other family members (Antonio Banderas and the standard ""Robert Rodriguez cast"") hardly appear at all. Why didn't Rodriguez instead decide to focus on the eminently talented Alexa Vega, especially since this is the last Spy Kids movie?One more thing I have to say: am I the only one who's starting to get a little tired of Robert Rodriguez and his ""Wow, I'm so cool, look how quickly and cheaply I made this movie"" attitude? Robert, why should I care if you shot Spy Kids 3D in six weeks and made it for a tiny fraction of what most movies cost? I paid nine bucks to see Lord of the Rings, and I pay nine bucks to see your movies. Get over yourself: you're not an indie ""flick"" maker anymore.

As the movie opens, stubborn Juni (Daryl Sabara) has left the OSS, and has become a private eye, and keeps telling the OSS that he is no longer an adgent, and he can't help them. He has his office in the tree house that his uncle Machete made for Juni and his older sister Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega) after they became secret agents. And he is visited by Gerti Giggles (Emily Osment), and after she leave he gets a call from Devlin (George Clooney), and he tells Devlin that he is into reality and the reality is nothing Devlin can say will make Juni return to the OSS as a secret agent. Then Delvin delivers the bad news, his sister is missing. So, he goes off to OSS where he is taken to games and theory, where bad boy turned good boy Donnagon Giggles (Mike Judge) and his wife (Salma Hayek) is waiting for him. They ask him what he knows about a game called &quot;Game Over&quot; created by the Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone) who is prisoned in cyber space, by the OSS year ago. Carmen went until the game by herself, because her only choice would not answer their calls, and got has far as level 4, and then disappeared into the game and is a prisoner of the Toymaker. Now with 3D glasses on, Juni is sent into the game, and has to start on level 1. Where he meets Beta testers, Arnold (Ryan Pinkston), Francis (Bobby Edner) and Rez (Robert Vito). And they tell him the fast way to get to level 2, is to jump into a target that will get him to the moon, where level 2 is, and he finds himself in the arena of Missfortune, and has to battle a mach to get to level 2, and he fights a girl named Demetra (Courtney Jines), and after a couple of rounds Juni wins, and off to level 2, where he runs into Arnold, Rez, and Francis who mistakes him for the Guy. But one has his doubts, and they changgle him to a mega race, where Juni wins, is congratulated by his grandfather (Richard Montalban) whom he brought in the game, without realzieing the Toymaker was the one that put Grandfather in the wheelchair, 30 years before the movie takes place, but when Demetra discovers, that Juni is not the real gut, she asks him to at least act like he is the real guy.

One must ask how could I make such kindda applause to appreciate stupidity. The reason? the 3D and real human performance are techniqily impossble before but it does on this one that they merch seamlessly and I mean totally seamless. Has anyone seen ""skycaptain and the world of tommorrow""? in that movie, except for the actors everything else is done 3D but its a totally boring movie since u can tell which part is human and which are 3D and there is no real actions in the whole movie. What spykids 3D does is to successfully to make real people interact with non exsiting 3D object and it does make u think they are interacting with each other in the movie, this is really the next big step toward cinema fictions. And come on people just admit it yourself even how stupid the script and plot that sounds, IT IS fun to watch, you know it does just ask your heart.

The little boy Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) gave up the O.S.S. to do private investigator work, but his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) tried to play the evil Toymaker's (Sylvester Stallord) video game. She lost because she couldn't handle the wizardry of the diabolical genius. Then Juni came back to save his sister and the world. That's how extensive and intricate the plot of the story really is. Duh. The boy goes through these levels with computer nerds and he is the main star, but not quite. Evil Toymaker is the best character in this movie and he deserved an Oscar nomination for all FIVE of his roles. Only Sylvester Stallord can truly dominate a motion picture like this! George Clooney does his best Stallord impression and scores big time. Kudos to you man. Yes, every person in the world should see this historical achievement. The set designs were more impressive than any &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie and the acting was phenomenal, especially Sylvester Stallord's. All of that raw emotion! Those kids can move!
