This story did not start badly as in the very beginning the viewer is treated to interesting (albeit clich&eacute;) characters presented in a very beautifully rendered environment. Then the story began to reveal itself and that is when you realize that this series never really had a chance.Much like the characters, the story is never entirely consistent, and eventually settles on a bizarre path that wrecks the premise of the original series all together and will leave any true fan bitter and feeling somewhat betrayed by the way this series was handled. The animation and action sequences are, for the most part, good, so I could not tank the score to one star in good conscience.If you enjoyed Psalms of Planets: Eureka Seven, then do yourself a huge favor and don't bother watching this, much less buying it. If you have not seen the original series, then you would do well to see it as it is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest animated works of all time. Then you should do whatever you can to avoid seeing this series.",2,Wrecking the original like it didn't even do it!!!,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1131,"['Eureka', 'Seven', 'AO', 'very', 'essence', 'predecessor', 'just', 'way', 'possible', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'start', 'badly', 'very', 'beginning', 'viewer', 'treated', 'interesting', 'clich', 'eacute', 'characters', 'presented', 'very', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'environment', 'Then', 'story', 'began', 'reveal', 'when', 'realize', 'series', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'chance.Much', 'characters', 'story', 'never', 'entirely', 'consistent', 'eventually', 'settles', 'bizarre', 'path', 'premise', 'original', 'series', 'together', 'will', 'leave', 'true', 'fan', 'bitter', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'betrayed', 'way', 'series', 'was', 'handled', 'animation', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'could', 'not', 'tank', 'score', 'one', 'star', 'good', 'conscience.If', 'enjoyed', 'Psalms', 'Planets', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'then', 'do', 'huge', 'favor', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'much', 'less', 'buying', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'series', 'then', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'see', 'humble', 'opinion', 'one', 'greatest', 'animated', 'works', 'time', 'Then', 'should', 'do', 'can', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'series']",Eureka Seven: AO - Part 1
1651127,AZVZXVX07KGWI,B00CU6WC1W,Larry B. Beitel,"[3, 3]","I thought the original series Eureka Seven was a great series with many memorable characters and a great story. Then I watched Eureka Seven: AO. It really didn't have the same heart and soul of the original series, it felt to me that it may have been better off sold as an alternate to the original series. Where I felt for Renton, Eureka, Holland, Talho and the rest of the GekkoState, in the AO series I felt no real attachment to any of the characters. I gave it a chance though and my hope went up when the *spoiler alert* scub coral in orbit broke apart to reveal the Gekko and second Nirvash but I was let down from there.Don't get me wrong, AO would have been a good series stand alone or as an alternate universe take (ala J.J. Abrams Star Trek 2009) but with the Eureka Seven tag next to it, the viewer is going to be expecting certain things that just weren't there in the sequel.",3,Not Quite A Worthy Sequel But Maybe An Alternate Series?,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,890,"['thought', 'original', 'series', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'many', 'memorable', 'characters', 'great', 'story', 'Then', 'watched', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'AO', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'heart', 'soul', 'original', 'series', 'felt', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'sold', 'alternate', 'original', 'series', 'Where', 'felt', 'Renton', 'Eureka', 'Holland', 'Talho', 'rest', 'GekkoState', 'AO', 'series', 'felt', 'real', 'attachment', 'characters', 'gave', 'chance', 'hope', 'went', 'up', 'when', '*spoiler', 'alert*', 'scub', 'coral', 'orbit', 'broke', 'apart', 'reveal', 'Gekko', 'second', 'Nirvash', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'there.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'AO', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'series', 'stand', 'alone', 'alternate', 'universe', 'take', 'ala', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'Star', 'Trek', '2009', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'tag', 'next', 'viewer', 'going', 'be', 'expecting', 'certain', 'things', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'sequel']",Eureka Seven: AO - Part 1

1651129,AQRFR7YYF7HE1,B00CU6WC1W,Nathan,"[0, 3]","A much better storyline than Eureka 7. AO is a young boy that has the gift of piloting Nirvash, a mech. Similar to Renton from Eureka 7 with one huge difference. AO has a character that develops and matures. Honestly this series is way better than the previous one. Good acting, characters, story, and animation all around. The nice thing about this series is that it stands on its own apart from the original. Having seen both I can say that I would recommend renting or watching online the original if you want to understand the history of Eureka 7.Oddly, there aren't hardly any bonus features for the AO series, whereas the original did. The original was more childish, almost immature throughout the series and AO more developed, maturing characters.",5,Better than Eureka 7,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,755,"['much', 'better', 'storyline', 'Eureka', '7', 'AO', 'young', 'boy', 'gift', 'piloting', 'Nirvash', 'mech', 'Similar', 'Renton', 'Eureka', '7', 'one', 'huge', 'difference', 'AO', 'character', 'matures', 'Honestly', 'series', 'way', 'better', 'previous', 'one', 'Good', 'acting', 'characters', 'story', 'animation', 'around', 'nice', 'thing', 'series', 'own', 'apart', 'original', 'Having', 'seen', 'can', 'say', 'would', 'recommend', 'renting', 'watching', 'online', 'original', 'want', 'understand', 'history', 'Eureka', '7.Oddly', 'are', ""n't"", 'hardly', 'bonus', 'features', 'AO', 'series', 'original', 'did', 'original', 'was', 'more', 'childish', 'almost', 'immature', 'series', 'AO', 'more', 'developed', 'maturing', 'characters']",Eureka Seven: AO - Part 1
1651130,A19TAPHYWWH3EW,B00CU6WC1W,Ritz,"[15, 18]","The first series was a beautiful love story about a boy maturing into a young man with an anti-war message of tolerance and understanding wrapped in an interesting and unique sci-fi world with an ending we all wish all anime had.This series has the interesting sci-fi bit and it has a bit of romance but it's missing out on any deeper meaning. It's an adventure, a fun one, but not as fun and not really memorable like the first series. And it will confuse the hell out of you most of the time. The end doesn't even answer all of the questions.The problems probably stem from the fact that Dai Sato (the brains behind the first series) wasn't attached to the project and that there were problems with the production staff mid series.",3,It's good but pales in comparison to its predecessor.,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,733,"['first', 'series', 'was', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'boy', 'maturing', 'young', 'man', 'anti-war', 'message', 'tolerance', 'understanding', 'wrapped', 'interesting', 'unique', 'sci-fi', 'world', 'ending', 'wish', 'anime', 'had.This', 'series', 'interesting', 'sci-fi', 'bit', 'bit', 'romance', 'missing', 'out', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'adventure', 'fun', 'one', 'not', 'fun', 'not', 'really', 'memorable', 'first', 'series', 'will', 'confuse', 'hell', 'most', 'time', 'end', ""n't"", 'even', 'answer', 'questions.The', 'problems', 'probably', 'stem', 'fact', 'Dai', 'Sato', 'brains', 'first', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'attached', 'project', 'were', 'problems', 'production', 'staff', 'mid', 'series']",Eureka Seven: AO - Part 1
1651131,A36OT34BWUV59E,B00CU6WC1W,Shiro,"[0, 2]",I am a huge fan of the original (which I hope they make a blu-ray release of) and I am willing to buy anything with the Eureka Seven name tagged on if it comes from the same development team.The product can in very nice. I picked up the LE set which is just a larger box to put set two in when it comes out in October. The set is very sturdy and I also like how they put both the BR and DVDs in the same cast to limit the wastefulness of two cases.I wont go into the story as must of you reading this mist likely have seen the first and may know a thing or two about this one. All I will say is the first 18 or so eps are really nice paced and the last few will start to speed up (only 12 are on this set). The ending can leave you wondering about a lot of things that happened in this series but I will say it does answer the biggest question everyone had and the end of the first series. Which I think everyone should enjoy.All in all I feel this was a good addition to my collection.,5,"Very nice story, did move fast in end.",1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,986,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'hope', 'make', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'am', 'willing', 'buy', 'anything', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'name', 'tagged', 'same', 'development', 'product', 'can', 'very', 'nice', 'picked', 'up', 'LE', 'set', 'just', 'larger', 'box', 'put', 'set', 'two', 'when', 'out', 'October', 'set', 'very', 'sturdy', 'also', 'like', 'how', 'put', 'BR', 'DVDs', 'same', 'cast', 'limit', 'wastefulness', 'two', 'cases.I', 'wont', 'go', 'story', 'must', 'reading', 'mist', 'likely', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'may', 'know', 'thing', 'two', 'one', 'will', 'say', 'first', '18', 'so', 'eps', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'paced', 'last', 'few', 'will', 'start', 'speed', 'up', 'only', '12', 'are', 'set', 'ending', 'can', 'leave', 'wondering', 'lot', 'things', 'happened', 'series', 'will', 'say', 'answer', 'biggest', 'question', 'everyone', 'had', 'end', 'first', 'series', 'Which', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'enjoy.All', 'feel', 'was', 'good', 'addition', 'collection']",Eureka Seven: AO - Part 1
