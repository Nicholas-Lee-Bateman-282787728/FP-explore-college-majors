924556,A1DDPWLITL7THF,B000AA4EZC,Customer from Quebec,"[2, 4]","I've been waiting for  12 years  for a decent Scorpions album and they've disappointed me a lot with poppy albums. Now the legendary german band is  back with a very solid  album (Unbreakable) and a strong DVD. I don't know where this quadriple ""reviewer""  was coming from (maybe he's got used to listen to the smooth and clean sound of some new crappy  pop groups calling themselves ""metal"" - you could easily get used to them if you listen to the lousy radio stations all across America). But this is not rock music.  Good  heavy rock sounds rough and ""bad"" edition can do it only god. I like the heavier sound of this album. Or maybe the ""reviewer "" knows only ""Wind of Change"" and doesn't know that Scorpions were considered as a heavy metal  bvand in the eighties. I wish the Scorpions have included more classics and extended the show a little bit (it's only 75 minutes), but I think it's great for the price! Klaus Meine has still a great voice and Rudolf Schenker and Mathias Jabbs are still on fire! I liked the documentary (although it could be a little shorter) too. Welcome back  Scorpions to heavy music!  I wish  Amazon could screen for multiple reviews from one person (no matter  bad or good) and remove the excess of them!",5,The Scorpions Are Back and Biting!,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,1239,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', '12', 'years', 'decent', 'Scorpions', 'album', ""'ve"", 'disappointed', 'lot', 'poppy', 'albums', 'Now', 'legendary', 'german', 'band', 'back', 'very', 'solid', 'album', 'Unbreakable', 'strong', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'quadriple', 'reviewer', 'was', 'coming', 'maybe', 'got', 'used', 'listen', 'smooth', 'clean', 'sound', 'new', 'crappy', 'pop', 'groups', 'calling', 'metal', 'could', 'easily', 'get', 'used', 'listen', 'lousy', 'radio', 'stations', 'America', 'not', 'rock', 'music', 'Good', 'heavy', 'rock', 'sounds', 'rough', 'bad', 'edition', 'can', 'do', 'only', 'heavier', 'sound', 'album', 'maybe', 'reviewer', 'only', 'Wind', 'Change', ""n't"", 'know', 'Scorpions', 'were', 'considered', 'heavy', 'metal', 'bvand', 'eighties', 'wish', 'Scorpions', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'classics', 'extended', 'show', 'little', 'bit', 'only', '75', 'minutes', 'think', 'great', 'price', 'Klaus', 'Meine', 'still', 'great', 'voice', 'Rudolf', 'Schenker', 'Mathias', 'Jabbs', 'are', 'still', 'fire', 'liked', 'documentary', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'shorter', 'too', 'Welcome', 'back', 'Scorpions', 'heavy', 'music', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'could', 'screen', 'multiple', 'reviews', 'one', 'person', 'matter', 'bad', 'good', 'remove', 'excess']",Scorpions: Unbreakable World Tour 2004 - One Night in Vienna

This is like the second time the Scorpions actually released a normal rock version DVD other than the Crazy World one. Acoustica and Moment of Glory was not a normal rock one they were projects. I don't think we should complain. I was happy when I heard they were releasing a live concert DVD. The documentary is very long, but it goes really in depth and you see a lot of the Scorpion's footage that you've never seen before. The question is that if they have all these pro footage, why not realease them on DVD and make money?!

The video is busy and they do show way too much of the drummer even when there is a guitar solo going on. Whats up with that?A drummer should be heard and not seen for the most part unless its his time to shine. The music is good the video quality is good as well.
