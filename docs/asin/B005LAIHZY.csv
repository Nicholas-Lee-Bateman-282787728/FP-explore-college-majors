Neither Merida nor her mom knew how to listen to anyone, each always expected to get her own way.Merida is a Princess, a member of the Royal Family.  She sees that as something to escape from.  Royalty are the richest, most connected and most powerful people in her country, and she hates it.Beyond that the movie shows marriage as something to fight against - something to fear and oppose.  It backs up the presumption by having Merida's suitors be physically weak and mentally inadequate - in other words, beneath her.  Beyond that Merida herself chooses the means by which they were supposed to show their worth, and she deliberately chose a means in which she could out do all of them.After that she flees into the forest - runs away from home.Merida meats a Witch in woods and buys a spell.  She wants to curse her own mom.  The curse was on a cake, which turns her mom into a bear.  Afterwards Merida just leaves the cake laying around, she leaves a cursed cake behind.  Which her brothers eventually find and eat.Merida's reaction to the transformation was blame the Witch, she just kept saying "" It's not my fault""  She'd bought the spell, and gave it to her mom, but refused to show responsibility for her actions.Merida then learns that her 3 younger brothers also ate the cake, turning them into bear cubs.  She'd just found out she'd cursed her brothers as well as her mom.  Her reaction was disgusting. she wasn't hurt or afraid or even shocked -  she was angry, at them!  She felt no guilt over what had happened to them.Her dad finds her mom's cloths shredded and her room destroyed, by a bear.  He sets out to avenge his wife.  That should be a great and honorable intent, but the movie's content make it look stupid.  This shows her dad trying to kill his wife, Magic curses or not - that is horrible.  Merida arrives in time to save her mom - Saying ""I wont let you kill my Mother"".  She had to fight her dad, that's beyond horrible.At the end Merida broke the curse by, finally, admitting that it had been her fault.  So her suitors were sent away. She cursed most of her family, and nearly got her mom killed - so for that she gets what she'd wanted.  She's rewarded and considered a heroine for just undoing the catastrophe she caused.It's hard to believe children are even allowed to watch this, much less encouraged to.",1,Deserves negative Stars,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,2471,"['could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'horrible', 'was.The', 'movie', 'only', 'about', 'Princess', 'Merida', 'Mother', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'minor', 'Merida', 'mom', 'knew', 'how', 'listen', 'anyone', 'always', 'expected', 'get', 'own', 'way.Merida', 'Princess', 'member', 'Royal', 'Family', 'something', 'escape', 'Royalty', 'are', 'richest', 'most', 'connected', 'most', 'powerful', 'people', 'country', 'it.Beyond', 'movie', 'marriage', 'something', 'fight', 'something', 'fear', 'oppose', 'up', 'presumption', 'having', 'Merida', 'suitors', 'be', 'physically', 'weak', 'mentally', 'inadequate', 'other', 'words', 'Beyond', 'Merida', 'means', 'were', 'supposed', 'show', 'worth', 'deliberately', 'chose', 'means', 'could', 'out', 'do', 'them.After', 'forest', 'away', 'home.Merida', 'meats', 'Witch', 'woods', 'spell', 'curse', 'own', 'mom', 'curse', 'was', 'cake', 'mom', 'bear', 'Afterwards', 'Merida', 'just', 'cake', 'laying', 'around', 'cursed', 'cake', 'behind', 'Which', 'brothers', 'eventually', 'find', 'eat.Merida', 'reaction', 'transformation', 'was', 'blame', 'Witch', 'just', 'kept', 'saying', 'not', 'fault', ""'d"", 'bought', 'spell', 'gave', 'mom', 'refused', 'show', 'responsibility', 'actions.Merida', 'then', '3', 'younger', 'brothers', 'also', 'ate', 'cake', 'turning', 'bear', 'cubs', ""'d"", 'just', 'found', 'out', ""'d"", 'cursed', 'brothers', 'as', 'well', 'mom', 'reaction', 'was', 'disgusting', 'was', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'afraid', 'even', 'shocked', 'was', 'angry', 'felt', 'guilt', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'them.Her', 'dad', 'mom', 'cloths', 'shredded', 'room', 'destroyed', 'bear', 'out', 'avenge', 'wife', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'honorable', 'intent', 'movie', 'content', 'make', 'stupid', 'dad', 'trying', 'kill', 'wife', 'Magic', 'not', 'horrible', 'Merida', 'time', 'save', 'mom', 'Saying', 'wont', 'let', 'kill', 'Mother', 'had', 'fight', 'dad', 'horrible.At', 'end', 'Merida', 'broke', 'curse', 'finally', 'admitting', 'had', 'been', 'fault', 'suitors', 'were', 'sent', 'away', 'cursed', 'most', 'family', 'nearly', 'got', 'mom', 'killed', 'so', 'what', ""'d"", 'wanted', 'rewarded', 'considered', 'heroine', 'just', 'undoing', 'catastrophe', 'caused.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'children', 'are', 'even', 'allowed', 'watch', 'much', 'less', 'encouraged']",N/A

The only reason I put 4 stars is because this movie was made by Pixar, and this isn't a 5 star Pixar movie. In any other context, yes, 5 stars, no problem.  But this movie fails to reach the (extremely high) standards set by Pixar's greatest.Should you see this movie? Yes. It's brilliantly paced, extremely funny, and has two shining examples of strong female protagonists with both Merida and her mother. Will it make you cry like Up did? Probabally not.  Does it take risks with the format of storytelling like Wall-E did? Nope; in fact, the plot is fairly predictable for an adult, though children might be taken by some of the twists.

Both of my girls must just be Brave and Strong young girls, because both of them don't seem to be bothered by the movie.  Now we did purchase the book a while ago and have read the story to them a number of times and discussed the scary scenes.  We also sat down as a family, made popcorn and watched it all together with our 6yr old and almost 4yr old.  I have to say there are some parts that I was not a fan of--for instance how she visits a witch to change her mother and that the food was left around for her brothers to eat.  But the hype about the nudity and every thing else...what are we puritans.  My girls didn't even seem to notice that the boys were naked.  I thought I was a wonderful story about how some traditions should be changed and left behind!!!! Like marrying your daughters off at a young age, making them wear outdated clothing and arranging their marriages.Hence the break from tradition, which all the young men were happy about as well.  It was refreshing to have a movie that showed how a girl could be strong and not have to ""live happily ever after"" and marry prince charming. Or be saved by a man.  It showed how she must figure out how to make things right through problem-solving. My husband and I believe our two daughters need to learn to rely on themselves and someday, as I did, find a wonderful man to share their lives.  We do not believe that our girls need a man to be complete--nor should a man need a woman--they should be healthy independent persons who are not co-dependent.I thought it was a delightful show that let you see how both mother and daughter were not listening to one another and after mom gets changed into a bear, they spend time mending and bonding together.  I have to say, parents sometimes get very hung up in having to have things their way and do not listen to their children.  I am also guilty at times--no one is perfect.  I liked how the bonds were mended both concretely for young children (with the tapestry), verbally and physically for older children and parents.

1477250,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIHZY,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Who doesn't love a good princess movie?  I mean, if you have children, or more specifically if you have daughters, then princess movies circulate your DVD player on an almost constant, and so you really do hope and pray and a good one comes along.  There are so many of them.  Pixar, the same studio behind great animated films like `Up' and `Toy Story' has never ventured into princess territory, and so when `Brave' was announced the internet (and every attentive parent) got their hopes up for this to actually be something special.In parts, this really is, but in other parts it is kind of the same.I think where `Brave' differs from almost every single other princess movie is that the protagonist is actually fighting AGAINST the idea of finding a prince charming.  It may have a lot to do with what she is offered (laughable at best) but the idea that she is more of a tomboy seeking her right to be herself and express herself freely, and without tradition barking in her ear, is a nice touch.  It's not like that same sentiment hasn't been expressed before.  Disney films like `Pocahontas' and `Mulan' display similarly strong-willed women fighting against the traditions of their people, but `Brave' takes it a step further by eliminating the desire to find Mr. Right.  Sadly, the overall construction of `Brave' doesn't steer too far from the set course.  It follows a similar story outline and so, by the time the film has ended, it does feel like an exercise in the same.The visuals are lush, and the moral of communication and compromise are nice assets to the films progression.  Folklore is such a fun and spirited way of telling a story, although I will say that many of the films plot points felt a tad lazy in construction.  Really, another witch?  Another potion?  Can't we do better than that?  The film is heartwarming and presents a meaningful message, especially for families since it stresses the importance of realty listening to one another.At the end of the day, my daughters love this (obviously) but I'm not entirely sold on the finished product.  Maybe it's because I expected more from the same studio that found such inspired ways to address so many mature themes (growing up via `Toy Story 3', mourning and loss via `Up', parenthood and balance via `Finding Nemo').  I wanted this to be something special, something amazing.

Merida makes a deal with this witch who casts a spell on Merida's mother (who wants her to marry another clan's son and unite two Irish tribes). Merida's mother becomes a bear- if they can't reverse the spell in enough time the spell will become permanent.I am an adult Disney fan and I found parts of this movie VERY scary and inappropriate for young children. The bad character (Merdu the bear) was terrifying- very scary- and the fight scenese with said bear were equally uncomfortable.There are a few Irish songs in this movie but nothing very catchy that left you wanting to replay them with children or do a sing-a-long.What I did find interesting of this movie is: there is no love interest.

Young Merida is the headstrong daughter of the feisty Scottish King Fergus and the equally strong but more quiet Queen Elinor, and loves both with all her heart, but as a princess, finds her duties to be a royal pain in the tush. Elinor is grooming her to royal duties, but Merida sees the inequality of her life as she has three smaller brothers who can almost get away with anything and are not facing the duties she must. In what little time she has to herself. she can be found outside the castle walls, riding her horse and practicing her archery, her favorite hobby. It is when she discovers she has been, literally put up for betrothal to the winner in a contest between three clans that the war with her mother actually begins as she has no desire to be married at all unless she can choose for herself, and none of the three clans offer much hope for a good match. Merida then takes matters into her own hands when she enters the contest to win her own hand sparking a raging argument with her mother which sees her flying off alone in tears. Willo the wisps enter the picture to lead her to an old witch's cottage where she pays the witch to cast a spell to change her fate. It changes more than that. It turns her mother into a bear and binds both her and her mother to an older fate when she finds she must not only seek a way to change her mother back, but protect her from her father who is seeking to kill what he believes is a legendary monster. Worse, both must contend with the monster, who is not only legendary, but alive. Merida must fight her father while Elinor takes on the powerful creature to save her daughter. How does it end? You'll have to see. I love this because it doesn't fall into the usual fairytale rule of Prince marrying the princess and living happily ever after. This is a tale of a headstrong powerful girl changing her fate and herself, seeking more from life than to be a prize for a contest and the dutiful quiet wife of a winner she doesn't even know. She is seeking the freedom to choose for herself what she wants and must be brave to not only find what she wants, but to correct her mistakes and protect her family as well as she might.

The heroine's archery skill serves nothing, in fact I wondered why they included it in the movie. Surely she could have gotten in trouble a myriad of other ways?  The bear was too cartoon-ish. It felt like the makers couldn't quite figure out if this was sad or funny.  The horse, a buddy in the beginning, disappears when the going gets tough. I also found the dialog hard to follow at times because of the accent.  The best and most significant character in the whole movie is the red hair, and in fact it dominates the screen.

Their animated films reflect racial diversity without being patronizing or offensive, with good values. ""Brave"" is an exciting and delightful film that follows this pattern, addressing the at-times-neglected role of women in society, showing an empowered and determined young lady that defies good ol' boy traditions. And it does it in an intelligent and colorful way.The story takes place in Scotland, where King Fergus rules the Clan DunBroch. The king gives Merida, his young daughter, a bow for her birthday. With time, Merida becomes an expert archer, a beautiful teenager, and lives a happy life with her three identical triplets. It is at this time that her mother, Queen Elinor, tells her that she is to be engaged for marriage to one of the sons of the leaders of his father's allied Clan kings. Merida, who has a strong and determined character - independent and opinionated -, hates the idea and does everything that she can to avoid this task, which means breaking a holy tradition. In doing so, she hurts her mother, by asking a witch to transform her into a bear. Merida, of course, feels sorry that she made that choice, and, against time, tries to reverse the spell. Add to this the curse of the legendary Mor'du, a huge, mean black bear, who is feared by all, and who was once a handsome prince. All these problems will make Merida reexamine her actions and behavior, and her future in the kingdom.""Brave"" has all the technical goodies of any Pixar films, and it is just great to watch. It is also funny, wicked and charming. And, as I said, it is about women's empowerment and bravery.

1477383,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIHZY,Chris Kennison,"[10, 25]","Other than ""Prometheus"", ""Brave"" may have been the most mysterious movie of the summer. The trailer reveals a flowing locks, red-headed girl who is being forced to marry the winner of an archery contest to dawn her own bow and arrow, step out onto the archery field and put, not one, but three arrows dead center of the target, splitting the third arrow down the middle. Then of course the words ""Brave"" jump to the middle of the screen with a dramatic crescendo of music. So, what is the movie all about?  Well, it's from Pixar, the guys behind ""Toy Story"", ""Cars"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Up"", yada yada yada, you get the point and you know their stuff.First and foremost, the movie opens with beautiful ""Braveheart""ish scenery that is done justice by the Pixar team and their abilities continue to dazzle throughout, bringing the characters and situations to life. You expect nothing less from the artists who have done such incredible work in the past and ""Brave"" is no exception. Yet, Pixar has set their own bar and we don't go to the movies expecting to be dazzled by them like we were when we saw ""Toy Story"" for the first time. We know what they're capable of and we're not surprised by it anymore. Their artistry is commonplace now. So, we need a story and ""Brave"" may, or may not have delivered.The movie starts off with what we saw in the trailer and builds upon that. We learn about Princess Merida, voiced by Kelly MacDonald and most importantly Queen Elinor, voiced by Emma Thompson. We learn about their complicated relationship and how tradition is expected of Merida and they both have conflicting views about how Merida should go forward in life. The relationship comes to a head and things happen that I won't delve into and then the movie goes into uncharted territory. Once Merida flees from her life, we start to see where all the mysteriousness leads. We start to see all the things that Pixar kept from us with their extremely vague trailer.I won't delve into that because it was kept from the audience for a reason and I hate ruining movies for people, but what does happen was unexpected and I didn't see it coming. Unfortunately though, underneath all the Pixar animation magic, the story that resides is kind of thin. It is a fairy tale type movie and it never really delves beyond that. The movies becomes sort of clich&eacute; and forgettable. Had dozens of movies previous not had such a collective similarity, ""Brave"" may have been better, but the story never really grabbed me like it should of and I found myself sort of just watching, instead of living it.Not to say that ""Brave"" is a bad movie, cause it isn't. It is just a middle of the road movie for a Pixar company that has set the bar so high in the past. I am always elated to see what Pixar has been working on. I remember watching ""Toy Story"" for the first time and I remember feeling like a kid, dazzled to the core.

1477384,A1BGE3EXIJ42XA,B005LAIHZY,"Chris ""Okie""","[5, 7]","On a spur of the moment decision, we took the kids to see Brave.  I have to admit that I was probably more excited to see this film than some of the kids (my oldest son almost backed out to stay home and do chores instead...what a choice, huh?).  The trailer had me a little nervous as it didn't ""feel"" the same as some of the other Pixar movies I've loved.  It almost had a ""Dreamworks"" studio feel...which isn't a bad thing since I've enjoyed some Dreamworks movies, but I was worried that it wouldn't be all that I hoped for and expected.  So, even though the trailer didn't put forth a whole lot in terms of the overall plot, I went into this film with pretty high expectations just because it's from Pixar.And hands down, my expectations were met.  If anybody else loves Pixar and was worried (as I was) that this film was a departure from their usual magic, put those fears aside.  This movie is great.Before talking about the movie, I want to comment on the ""short"" before the film.  As with all Pixar movies (and more and more on other animated films as well), they had a short cartoon.  This one was called ""La Luna.""  It starts with a young boy sitting in the middle of the water with two older men.  There are no words but a lot of mumbled grunts and other unspoken language.  As the title suggests, the short involves the Moon.  Through most of the short it felt like we were balancing between a lovely piece of artwork and silly humor that tried to stop just short of the slapstick humor of cartoon.  But then, in the final moments of the short there is a great image that pulls everything together in a surprising way that is absolutely fantastic and makes the whole thing very endearing and special.  This one is a sweet and fun showcase of talent.Similar to the surprising twist in the short, there was a surprise for me in the movie itself.  From the trailer, it looked like the plot would be about an outspoken girl who doesn't want to get married because she has too much fun being a warrior boy.  She's at odds with her parents (mostly her mother) and sets out in search of a way to change things.  That's where the trailer left it....and it left me thinking this might be a Mulan-esque story where she goes off on some sort of adventure (again making me nervous that maybe we'd just have a rehashed story).The trailer is a bit sneaky.  I haven't looked to see if they've released a new, more revealing trailer but I can tell you that the original trailers were somewhat misleading in terms of the overall plot and story arc of this movie.  With a couple of brief, disjointed exceptions, I think all of the scenes from the trailer come only from the first half (or less) of the movie.  About one-third or one-half of the way through the movie there is a big twisty plot element that makes this movie very different from what I expected.  I won't spoil it for you since the surprise is a lot of fun and it makes for a very compelling second half of the movie.  I don't think the movie would be any less enjoyable if you know what's going to happen, but the thrill of the reveal is a lot of fun, so I'll leave you to it.The story is not 100% fresh and unique.  In fact it borrows themes and elements from other stories.  But it is told in a fresh, humorous and compelling way.  The writing and directing is fabulous and keeps the pacing and fun.  It was filled with great banter as well as some awesome non-verbal communication.  Merida's little brothers never really speak...and yet they are super evocative and funny.  Other characters later in the movie also have super non-verbal communication.Near the very end of the movie the staging of the scene was powerful enough that I looked next to me as Lynette gasped in fear and whispered ""oh no"" and looked like she might cry.  Even knowing this was a children's film, there was enough tension and emotion invoked that she was worried things might all fall apart.The artwork is superb as is expected from Pixar.  Some of the scenery and landscape shots were absolutely stunning and looked almost photo-realistic.  There was a scene where Merida and her mother were walking through the forest and at quick glance it looked almost like a live-action movie rather than a cartoon.  Still, the colors and palette were vibrant and cartoony enough to maintain the animation aspect, but I was very impressed with the art.  The grass.  The water.  The hair.  The cloth.  Great work.The music was also great.  The score is wonderfully engrossing and a lot of fun.  They presented a wonderfully Celtic vibe and had some great vocal selections as well (all background...there aren't any musical numbers in the movie).Over the years I have absolutely loved the Pixar films.  I've been a big Disney fan since I was a little kid and enjoy those movies but I have to admit that some of the Disney animated films of the past decade(s) have lost some of their charm and magic.  Amid the slight slump from Disney, I feel like Pixar has picked up the slack.  There are certainly Pixar films I like more than others and I haven't seen all of them (the only full-length film I haven't seen is Ratatouille) but I really like all of their work and totally love many of them.As I mentioned I was initially nervous that this film might be a departure from the Pixar magic that I know and love.  My fears were unfounded and Brave was as fabulous an experience as I have come to expect and enjoy from Pixar.  There are a couple of scenes that might be a little intense for very young viewers...and there was a scene where you see bare male bottoms (as my wife pointed out to the kids, it shows verisimilitude in the fact that there often wasn't anything worn beneath the kilts...not that it was necessary to put it into the movie, but it was some generally tasteful comic relief).Overall I really had a ton of fun with this movie and look forward to seeing it again.  All of the family really enjoyed it (even my oldest who initially didn't plan on coming).  If you're on the fence but have enjoyed Pixar in the past, I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.  If you're not a fan of cartoons and kids movies, this one might just straddle the fence enough between childish and grown up to help you have fun.4.5 out of 5 stars",5,Exceded my high

1477415,A2RK3QEUEFRNAN,B005LAIHZY,"Daddy Shawn ""Writer & daddy.""","[8, 8]","I've been trying to understand why some seem to be lukewarm about BRAVE.  Some would like to see the beginning cut so that the action starts sooner, I would say that you'd miss the exposition if it wasn't there.  I, for one, enjoyed every minute of it.  Some have said that the backgrounds were too realistic, I think the backgrounds (and all the animation) is just incredibly beautiful.  I would agree with the sentiment that it would have been nice to see more of the mother/daughter interaction, but then the movie would have been too long for the younger kids.  It's there appropriately, but when the mother and daughter's relationship changes it could have been a slower process and I'd have enjoyed it because I'm at an age where I can enjoy the subtle changes.  A ten-year-old wouldn't like that so I can understand the choice.  I've read all the negative reviews, but I just don't agree.  BRAVE is a great film.As for this 5-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition - It's fine.  I would have liked a sound remix for the 2 channel Dolby.  The dialogue is slightly too weak or the musical soundtrack too loud.  But if you aren't listening to the film on internal TV speakers then you're fine.  It's all great and nothing too terribly distracting.  It's great that Disney included so many extras.  That makes buying these versions worth the extra $$.

1477419,AS5DZ7COE84B5,B005LAIHZY,"Dan-Fabian Parra ""the dude""","[0, 0]","With &#34;Brave&#34;, Pixar finally made their entrance into a period and fairy tale setting. After the critical and financial failure of &#34;Cars 2&#34; (which is a film that I personally enjoyed and didn't deserve the massive hate), &#34;Brave&#34; was seen as Pixar's chance of redemption. However, some Pixar fans screamed foul and thought &#34;Brave&#34; was a result of the Disneyfication of Pixar. However, although &#34;Brave&#34; wasn't seen as the definite Pixar comeback, it still was better critically and commercially received as &#34;Cars 2&#34;.The feminist aspects were also surrounding &#34;Brave&#34;. It was their first film with a female lead after more than a decade of films with male leads. &#34;Brave&#34; got also some buzz of the directorial change. It was Brenda Chapman's lovechild, but she got replaced because of creative differences. Although Chapman herself has stated that her original visions of the tale was fulfilled, the replacements are barely mentioned in the special features. She still got credited as the secondary director, although one can't help to wonder if there was a bigger conflict about this story or if this conflict was enhanced by the media.Either way, although I've always been not so fond of Pixar, they can deliver a masterpiece now and then (&#34;Toy Story&#34;, &#34;Finding Nemo&#34;, &#34;Up&#34;). &#34;Brave&#34; does come across a one of Pixar's strongest works, but is also hampered by some flaws. And some quite obvious flaws too. Moviegoers has grown to expect more from Pixar and many of them found the film to be conventional. The marketing device also misguided the film, depicting it as a grand adventure, when it really is an intimate, character-driven story in the second half.Where &#34;Brave&#34; really excel is with the animation and the music. The animation is stunningly gorgeous, as is the music, setting a haunting atmosphere and giving the movie a special quality. The wonderful score is by Patrick Doyle, the songs written by Alex Mandel and they work well.&#34;Brave&#34; is a departure from Pixar's previous works, not only because of it's setting, but it's scope. It definitively feels more Disney than Pixar at times, but that's doesn't necessarily hurts the film. I see nothing wrong about Pixar trying to go in Disney's territory  and make a Princes movie long you do it with class and subtlety (damn me as much as you want to, Pixar fanboys). However, I still wished that Pixar would make more realistic-looking characters for once and expand their horizons in term of character designs.Where &#34;Brave&#34; falls flat, it's in terms of it's story. It's quite conventional, as the matter of fact too conventional. The story is trite, cliched and really not particularly well structured. The film seems more of two separate stories incorporated into one. However, despite the  story problems, &#34;Brave&#34; shall have praise for having a mother-daughter-related story in a fairy tale setting and not having a prince charming to save the day.Another noteworthy component about &#34;Brave&#34; is the choice of having an all Scottish cast into the movie. It's easy to give Pixar some good points about that, although the Medieval Scottish would probably be not understandable for todays audiences. However, most of the voices are fine. Billy Connolly (who previously was in &#34;Pocahontas&#34;) brings the warmth and joviality to King Fergus. Emma Thompson (who was in &#34;Treasure Planet&#34;) brings dignity and subtlety to Queen Ellinor. Less successful is Kelly McDonald as the protagonist Merida herself, making Merida more grating and whiny than she needs to be. Otherwise, Julie Walters makes a fine witch. Steve Purcell makes a fun crow. Kevin McKidd makes a good Lord MacGuffin/Young MacGuffin. Craig Ferguson delivers some spunk to Lord Macintosh.BONUS FEATURESThe film is filled with good bonus features. First up is a audio commentary by director Mark Andrews, co-director Steve Purcell, editor Nick Smith and story supervisor Brian Larsen. The four of them delivers an excellent commentary, covering all the topics of the story and the technical aspects, although Andrew's voice can be a little grating at times. But still another excellent commentary from Pixar.LEGEND OF MOR'DU; A short which enhances the full story about Mor'Du (according to rumors that were around the Internet, the short was supposed to be included in the actual movie). It's a fine short, giving more purpose and weight to the story of Mor'Du and it's nice to see that it's mainly hand-drawn.LA LUNA: A short and sweet Pixar film.BRAVE OLD WORLD: A featurette that talks about the crew's visit to Scotland and the Scottish influences on the film. Although is mostly praise about the land and culture, it's still interesting.MERIDA & ELINOR: A featurette that covers the characters and personalities of Merida and Elinor and their relationship. Chapman herself dominates most of the featurette. A quite engaging topic.BEARS: A short featurette that covers the designs and animation aspects of Mor'Du and Queen Elinor as a bear. Short, but still quite interesting.WONDER MOSS: A topic about how they created the moss in the movie. It's a little too technical, but still interesting.MAGIC: Magic tells us about the magical aspects of the film, like the wisps and the witch and the fairy tale aspect. Quite enjoyableCLAN PIXAR: A featurette that covers the folks at Pixar. A little more jovial and happy talk than what it needs to be.ONCE UPON A SCENE: A featurette that delivers the many deleted scenes (and also indicates &#34;Brave's&#34; troubled production). It's interesting that Pixar decided to have many of the deleted scenes in one featurette, instead of having the deleted scenes themselves. However, it's still interesting to watch.Disc two is also filled with many featurettes. First up is an alternative opening (a few shots that made into one of the trailers). While it's not fully animated, it's still an engaging shot.FALLING WARRIORS: A featurette about the fighting scenes in the movie and how they got choreographed. Short, but interesting.DIRTY HAIRY PEOPLE: A featurette which talks about the hair in the movie. Also short, but interestingIT'S ENGLISH... SORT OF: This featurette talks about the use of the Scottish actors, the Scottish words and phrases used in the movie. Quite funANGUS: About Merida's black horse, Angus and how to create the character.THE TAPESTRY: About the tapestry that Queen Elinor makes in the film and how the creative team managed to create it.Overall, &#34;Brave&#34; is hampered by some flaws and might be to conventional at times, but still makes a good movie to watch. It's easily one of the best animated movies yet on this decade.",4,"A flawed, but good Pixar effort",1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,6762,"['34', 'Brave', '34', 'Pixar', 'finally', 'made', 'entrance',

1477423,A30KFOL6357WPZ,B005LAIHZY,Daphne Jones,"[1, 1]","As Pixar's first fairy tale and its first ""princess"" movie, I was very curious to see what they'd come up with. Would Brave's Merida be a traditional princess in the Disney mold, or a more modern girl?Well, it's the latter, thankfully. Merida is a great character and role model for girls (and boys, really) who are struggling between respecting their parents and growing into their own person.This isn't at all a story about a girl who a) needs rescuing, or b) falls helplessly in love.

1477426,A154R0EH8V8J23,B005LAIHZY,"Davey B. ""Gadget Geek""","[2, 3]","Disney/Pixar really hit the mark on this one. The main character shares a lot more true-to-life qualities with growing up that many past princess characters; she's rebellious to the point of not only going against her mother's wishes, but trying to subvert them completely. But she loves her family dearly all the same, and the bond runs deep through all that happens. Seeing a child's deep love and caring towards a parent whose rules they also so desperately wish to escape from is a very different motif for a Disney princess story. I found it heartwarming on so many different levels. The fear, the bravery, the sacrifices, and the strengthening of their loving bond through their tribulations are all wonderful and relatable parts of the story for any parent and their growing (or grown!) child. The lesson of mutual respect between a parent and child is a wonderful reminder of this constant challenge to both real-life counterparts as they watch this movie, as well.As others have stated, this movie does have some fairly scary scenes involving animals. Many people use the term ""intense,"" which they are, but to be perfectly blunt - they're scary. As a small child, I would have had bad dreams involving them, but I also clung to imagery in movies very tightly and had an overactive imagination. If in doubt, watch the movie by yourself first, or search online for a synopsis or video of just the scary scenes if you don't want to spoil getting to watch the whole movie together for the first time with your child. It's not ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or anything - it's just good to be aware of the scenes if you have a child you know gets frightened easily.As for the physical disc itself, the presentation is very nice. I like the lenticular slip cover that goes over the disc case, though it is prone to the corners getting a little bent after removing and reinserting the blu-ray case a few times, as it's a pretty tight fit. I do appreciate that unlike a lot of multi-disc sets, the discs aren't stacked on top of each other in this package. Each one is one its own little spindle so you can get to whichever disc you want without having to remove a bunch of others first. The bonus features are also really enjoyable, and this movie looks great in 3D! A wonderful package to buy if you'd like to get the complete set of viewing options (we used the 3D blu-ray as a special ""movie night"" treat, the standard blu-ray for normal ""let's pop in a movie"" type viewing, and the DVD for playing in the car during road trips).",5,A wonderful new Disney princess to be proud of,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,2530,"['Disney/Pixar', 'really', 'hit', 'mark', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'shares', 'lot', 'more', 'true-to-life', 'qualities', 'growing', 'up', 'many', 'past', 'princess', 'characters', 'rebellious', 'point', 'not', 'only', 'going', 'mother', 'wishes', 'trying', 'subvert', 'completely', 'family', 'dearly', 'same', 'bond', 'deep', 'Seeing', 'child', 'deep', 'love', 'caring', 'towards', 'parent', 'rules', 'also', 'so', 'desperately', 'wish', 'escape', 'very', 'different', 'motif', 'Disney', 'princess', 'story', 'found', 'heartwarming', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'fear', 'bravery', 'sacrifices', 'strengthening', 'loving', 'bond', 'tribulations', 'are', 'wonderful', 'relatable', 'parts', 'story', 'parent', 'growing', 'grown', 'child', 'lesson', 'mutual', 'respect', 'parent', 'child', 'wonderful', 'reminder', 'constant', 'challenge', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'watch', 'movie', 'well.As', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'movie', 'have', 'fairly', 'scary', 'scenes', 'involving', 'animals', 'Many', 'people', 'use', 'term', 'intense', 'are', 'be', 'perfectly', 'blunt', ""'re"", 'scary', 'small', 'child', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'bad', 'dreams', 'involving', 'also', 'clung', 'imagery', 'movies', 'very', 'tightly', 'had', 'overactive', 'imagination', 'doubt', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'search', 'online', 'synopsis', 'video', 'just', 'scary', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'getting', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'child', 'not', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'anything', 'just', 'good', 'be', 'aware', 'scenes', 'have', 'child', 'know', 'frightened', 'easily.As', 'physical', 'disc', 'presentation', 'very', 'nice', 'lenticular', 'slip', 'cover', 'disc', 'case', 'prone', 'corners', 'getting', 'little', 'bent', 'removing', 'reinserting', 'blu-ray', 'case', 'few', 'times', 'pretty', 'tight', 'fit', 'do', 'appreciate', 'lot', 'multi-disc', 'sets', 'discs', 'are', ""n't"", 'stacked', 'top', 'other', 'package', 'one', 'one', 'own', 'little', 'spindle', 'can', 'get', 'whichever', 'disc', 'want', 'having', 'remove', 'bunch', 'others', 'first', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'great', '3D', 'wonderful', 'package', 'buy', ""'d"", 'like', 'get', 'complete', 'set', 'viewing', 'options', 'used', '3D', 'blu-ray', 'special', 'movie', 'night', 'treat', 'standard', 'blu-ray', 'normal', 'let', 'pop', 'movie', 'type', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'playing', 'car', 'road', 'trips']",N/A

1477436,AOS5ZBTQX7QIT,B005LAIHZY,D. Barbour,"[22, 45]","Pixar's first tale to center on a female heroine introduces us to Merida, who is, ironically enough, an adventurous tomboy. She loathes her loving mother (the queen) for pushing her into the very feminine royal life laid out for her based on the traditions of her people. This resentment eventually boils over, and Merida rides off into the woods in an act of protest. During this glorified tantrum, she stumbles upon a mysterious group of stones and magical blue 'wisp' creatures. These beings lead Merida to the cabin of a bumbling witch with a penchant for spells. Merida strikes a deal with her to 'change her destiny' in exchange for a valuable necklace. Of course the new destiny is worse than her original one so Merida spends the rest of the movie trying to, as Bay-Staters know how to say all too well, 'reverse the curse!'As usual for Pixar, the animation is nothing short of breathtaking. A young girl sitting behind me at the theater gasped ""So beautiful!"" when the film opened to a stunning shot of an animated Scottish coastal community. The way the animators craft the different settings for our characters in such vivid color and detail is almost worth the price of admission alone...almost.Where the film falters is with both the overall pacing and with the development of an antagonist. The beginning of the movie seems to drag, especially for a fairy tale geared at young children. The first hour could have been told in half the time, and gets quite repetitive as it drives home the point that Merida is not happy with her life. She is like the child version of Elizabeth Gilbert from Eat, Pray, Love - both being whiny characters that have so much yet want something different. Once Brave does begin to move along plotwise, it becomes a disjointed tale in search of a villain. Is it the witch? The demon bear? The queen? Merida herself? Maybe all of them? The narrative doesn't take the time to establish any one evil to root against, which leaves older, more mature viewers a little impartial to the outcome.For a story so lacking in a developed villain, it is surprisingly violent, taking advantage of every last bit of the 'PG' rating. From constant sword/fist/bear fights to one character getting crushed to death by a large stone, I was taken aback by how far Pixar took the intensity of this story. While other Pixar movies have had dramatic scenes, this one strikes me as the first I would say real young children would not enjoy seeing. I wish the film had leaned more on the humor, because when Brave tries to be funny, it succeeds brilliantly. There are a few comical sequences with devious little triplets that save the film from being a complete disaster.All that criticism aside, this is a perfect movie for preteen/middle school girls who can handle cartoon violence and want an ultimately positive message. For the rest of us, Pixar's latest is simply a disappointing Scottish legend that borrows from better animated films of a similar vein (see the far superiorSpirited Away). It's not the worst way to spend your money at the multiplex, but it's certainly not worth rushing out to see if you aren't in the target demographic. In my movie-going opinion, I would give it a 5 out of 10.",2,"Great Animation, Lacking Pixar-Standard Story",1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,3222,"['Pixar', 'first', 'tale', 'center', 'female', 'heroine', 'introduces', 'Merida', 'who', 'ironically', 'enough', 'adventurous', 'tomboy', 'loving', 'mother', 'queen', 'pushing', 'very', 'feminine', 'royal', 'life', 'laid', 'out', 'based', 'traditions', 'people', 'resentment', 'eventually', 'Merida', 'woods', 'act', 'protest', 'glorified', 'tantrum', 'mysterious', 'group', 'stones', 'magical', 'blue', 'creatures', 'beings', 'lead', 'Merida', 'cabin', 'bumbling', 'witch', 'penchant', 'spells', 'Merida', 'deal', ""'change"", 'destiny', 'exchange', 'valuable', 'necklace', 'course', 'new', 'destiny', 'worse', 'original', 'one', 'so', 'Merida', 'rest', 'movie', 'trying', 'Bay-Staters', 'know', 'how', 'say', 'too', 'well', 'curse', 'usual', 'Pixar', 'animation', 'nothing', 'short', 'breathtaking', 'young', 'girl', 'sitting', 'theater', 'gasped', 'So', 'beautiful', 'when', 'film', 'opened', 'stunning', 'shot', 'animated', 'Scottish', 'coastal', 'community', 'way', 'animators', 'craft', 'different', 'settings', 'characters', 'such', 'vivid', 'color', 'detail', 'almost', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'almost.Where', 'film', 'falters', 'overall', 'pacing', 'development', 'antagonist', 'beginning', 'movie', 'drag', 'especially', 'fairy', 'tale', 'geared', 'young', 'children', 'first', 'hour', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'time', 'quite', 'repetitive', 'home', 'point', 'Merida', 'not', 'happy', 'life', 'child', 'version', 'Elizabeth', 'Gilbert', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'being', 'whiny', 'characters', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'want', 'something', 'different', 'Once', 'Brave', 'begin', 'move', 'along', 'plotwise', 'disjointed', 'tale', 'search', 'villain', 'witch', 'demon', 'bear', 'queen', 'Merida', 'Maybe', 'narrative', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'establish', 'one', 'evil', 'root', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'viewers', 'little', 'impartial', 'outcome.For', 'story', 'so', 'lacking', 'developed', 'villain', 'surprisingly', 'violent', 'taking', 'advantage', 'last', 'bit', ""'PG"", 'rating', 'constant', 'sword/fist/bear', 'fights', 'one', 'character', 'getting', 'crushed', 'death', 'large', 'stone', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'how', 'far', 'Pixar', 'took', 'intensity', 'story', 'other', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'one', 'first', 'would', 'say', 'real', 'young', 'children', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'leaned', 'more', 'humor', 'when', 'Brave', 'be', 'funny', 'brilliantly', 'are', 'few', 'comical', 'sequences', 'devious', 'little', 'triplets', 'save', 'film', 'being', 'complete', 'disaster.All', 'criticism', 'aside', 'perfect', 'movie', 'preteen/middle', 'school', 'girls', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'want', 'ultimately', 'positive', 'message', 'rest', 'Pixar', 'latest', 'simply', 'disappointing', 'Scottish', 'legend', 'better', 'animated', 'films', 'similar', 'vein', 'see', 'far', 'superiorSpirited', 'Away', 'not', 'worst', 'way', 'spend', 'money', 'multiplex', 'certainly', 'not', 'worth', 'rushing', 'out', 'see', 'are', ""n't"", 'target', 'demographic', 'movie-going', 'opinion', 'would', 'give', '5', '10']",N/A

1477449,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005LAIHZY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 7]","In the summer of 2012, Pixar Animation Studios released their latest computer-animated film titled ""Brave"".The summer blockbuster was written by award-winning writer Brenda Chapman (""Chicken Run"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""The Real Ghostbusters""), Mark Andrews (""John Carter"", ""Spider-Man""), Steve Purcell (creator of the adventure game series ""Sam & Max"") and Irene Mecchi (""The Lion King"", ""Hercules"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"") and co-directed by Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman and Steve Purcell.The film would become Pixar's first fairy tale film and also feature a darker tone compared to previous Pixar animated films.  And as one would expected from a Pixar film, ""Brave"" which was budgeted around $185 million, went on to earn over $532 million in the box office.VIDEO:""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is probably one of the most significant Disney/Pixar animated releases I have seen in terms of overall presentation and gorgeous picture quality.  The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1) aspect ratio and as far as picture quality is concerned, everything about this film looks incredibly well-detailed.First, let's take a look at the Blu-ray 3D version.  For those who have the hardware to display 3D, this is one film that was created with 3D in mind.  From the way the animation utilizes depth for 3D is wonderful to see.  You actually can see the scale of the castle through 3D as it gives an impression the location is quite vast.  While there are scenes with the Elinor as the bear or Mor'du the demon bear cowering over a character with great monstrosity, you can see the scale of the bears.But for the most part, the 3D for this film is improved compared to past Disney 3D films.  Overall, depth gives us a sense of scale much more effective for the film on Blu-ray 3D.As for the Blu-ray release, the Blu-ray of ""Brave"" is fantastic.From the food that King Fergus is eating to the emphasis on hair, from the strands of hair, unkept hair, beard hair, ear hair, you name it, there is a lot of detail when it comes to hair and hair physics in this film.  Also, the clothing are well=-detailed, the background scenery looks magnificent outdoors especially indoors.  The overall color is sharp, vibrant and black levels are nice and deep.There are so many things about this film that looks realistic and detailed, I was really impressed.  The overall picture quality is one of the best I have seen on Blu-ray and the film on Blu-ray looks amazing!As for the DVD, the DVD version is presented in 2:39:1, enhanced for 169 televisions.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:If you thought that ""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" was great for videophiles, audiophiles will also find a lot of satisfaction with the Blu-ray release.  Presented in Dolby TrueHD 7.1, this is one of the most immersive Disney Blu-ray releases I have heard for an animated film.  From the environmental ambiance of hearing the forest, the wind, the trees, the grass being fully integrated to the film and giving you the sense that Merida and family are out in the country, there is also great utilization of sound when Mor'Du approaches or when Ilinor growls in bear form.  There is also great utilization of sound when Merida is shooting her bow and arrow or when the men are fighting against the demon bear.The immersive soundtrack utilizes the surround channels may it be with sound effects or its beautiful musical soundtrack but also a good amount of LFE to make you feel those action scenes.  But the positive factor of this film is its immersiveness and making you feel that sound outdoors are coming from all over your soundscape.  ""Brave"" sounds absolutely fantastic in Blu-ray!As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH, English Commentary 2.0 Dolby Digital, SpanishSPECIAL FEATURES""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" comes with the following special features:La Luna - (6:57) A theatrical short about a young boy working with his father and grandfather.The Legend of Mor'Du - (6:51) What is the history about the demon bear known as Mor'Du.Behind the Scenes - (12:35) Featuring seven scenes in which the crew traveled to Scotland and embraced the scenery which was important for creating the look and feel of ""Brave"".Once Upon a Time - (7:47) Each scene may have had different perspectives and storytelling that had to be cut out.  This segment features the different ideas for a certain scene.Extended Scenes  - Featuring four separate extended scenes with extra scenes that were cut out of the final cut.Director's Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director Mark Andrews, co-director Steve Purcell, story supervisor Brian Larsen and editor Nick Smith.Fergus & Mor'Du: An Alternate Opening - (2:40) Featuring a scene that original focused on King Fergus.Fallen Warriors - (2:08) Shots that were cut out of the final version of the film and honored in this Blu-ray.Dirty Hairy People - (3:33) The animators talk about how the characters have a lot of hair in this animated film.  As well as trying to capture the authenticity of Scottish people of that time period, including bad teeth.It is English... Sort of - (3:50) The Scottish talent and crew discuss the various Scottish dialects utilized in the film and with various characters.Angus - (3:25) A feature about the research of horses and capturing the look and feel of the horse and also creating the relationship between Merida and her horse Angus.The Tapestry - (3:56) Creating the visual element of the tapestry and its importance int he film.Art Galleries - With your remote, you can view art revolving around the characters, color keys, development art, environments and graphics.EXTRAS:""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" comes with a cardboard sleeve case with a renticular front featuring Merida.  The Ultimate Collector's Edition comes with the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy.JUDGMENT CALL:""Brave"" was a pleasant surprise to come from Pixar.Not only was the storyline a bit dark, but rarely do you find a story that is concentrated on a mother and daughter relationship.  But obviously it was a film that was used to test waters of what Pixar can accomplish outside of animated films that featured non-human characters, especially characters who were not young children and it was also a film that featured Pixar Animation Studios first female director.While a film like ""Up"" was a film about an elderly man's life who is changed thanks to a child, ""Brave"" is a film that was driven by co-director and co-writer Brenda Chapman and capturing the relationship between mother and daughter.  From Chapman's experience of traveling to Scotland and wanting to create a fairy tale in the tradition of Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm.I'm always open for something unique and different and what I enjoyed about this film is it's overall feel and how the film incorporated Scottish dialects and utilizing the right talent that fit the film.  Originally, Reese Witherspoon was to voice the character of Merida, but it worked to Pixar's benefit to have actress Kelly Macdonald play the lead character.  From the spoken dialogue to seeing a female character that is athletic, dominant but also free-spirited, you just don't see this kind of character in a Disney animated film.And speaking of acting, along with actress Kelly Macdonald, ""Brave"" also features wonderful voice acting from Bill Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd and Craig Ferguson.  The voice acting really made a big difference in the believability of this film.And it's important to mention that ""Brave"" is not a film that loses its cuteness in sake of creating something realistic.  While the film does focus on mother and daughter relationships, children will no doubt love the adorable and mischievous nature of Merida's triplet young brothers.  And also, for action purposes, you have Merida's father ready to jump into any fray to defend his family and people.The characters are fun, the scenery looks absolutely beautiful and overall animation is fantastic.  But will it work for children?  I think children will love it for its action.  I also feel that families will enjoy it for that family bonding storyline but also the nature of the story and the aspect of family.And for those who have wanted an animated film with a brave heroine, ""Brave"" is that kind of movie.As for the Blu-ray release, ""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is wonderful!  Not only is this the best 3D animated film to come from Disney thus far, it's also a film that looks and sounds incredible on Blu-ray.  There is so much detail in the characters (especially the hair!) , clothing, backgrounds and scenery, I was impressed by seeing how fantastic ""Brave"" looks on Blu-ray.  It really was breathtaking just to watch this film and see how Pixar continues to improve after one hit film after the other.  As for special features, you get a lot of them included with this release that shows us how much work and research went into capturing Scottish culture and integrating it through the entire film.And with the holiday season coming up, ""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is also fantastic as you get the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy.A first for Pixar....first female director, the first fairy tale film and a film that focuses on a mother and daughter relationship.  But ""Brave"" is much more than that!  It's a film that is strong on storytelling, featuring wonderful acting but also, ""Brave"" is one of the most impressive Blu-ray releases I have ever seen and heard in my years of reviewing Blu-ray releases.""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is a must-own, must-buy Blu-ray release!  And is highly recommended and deserving of five stars!",5,"This Ultimate Collector's Edition of ""BRAVE"" is worth owning!

Parts of the movie are violent and/or extremely intense; this movie may be frightening to really young children.Merida is a princess, the eldest child of King Fergus, ruler of an ancient kingdom set somewhere in the Highlands of ancient Scotland.  The introduction shows her to be an independent tom-boy with wonderful red hair, a love for the outdoors and archery, and the angst and stubborn streak of a typical teenager.  A precursor sequence tells of a dramatic family encounter with a vicious bear that lays the groundwork for key parts of the rest of the plot.As the story proper gets underway, we learn the time has come for her to be betrothed to the eldest son of one of the clans of the kingdom, a crucial event of state for which Merida's mother, the dutiful Queen Elinor, has been attempting to prepare her for years.  Merida refuses to play out her role, subverting the betrothal process and fleeing into the forests.  There, she has an encounter with a witch, who offers her a magical way out of her responsibilities as a princess.  This escape comes with unfortunate and even terrifying consequences for Merida's mother and for the Kingdom that Merida will only slowly come to recognize.  She will be forced to race the clock, attempting to apply her mother's lessons to putting things right.""Brave"" has a nice mixture of action and comedy, even in its supernatural elements. The action builds to a dramatic and emotional climax at story's end, assisted by a score highlighting both gaelic and modern music.

1477479,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B005LAIHZY,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","From 1995 to 2004 Pixar ran up an unbelievable string of critical successes with each animated film receiving at least 92% aggregate score on Rotten Tomatoes and 77 out of 100 on Metacritic. Then came Cars which was financially successful but was recognized by many, myself included, as the weakest Pixar movie thus far. Pixar regained its mojo and rattled off another 4 winners before Cars 2 stunk up theaters. The following film, Brave, was the lowest rated Pixar film not featuring Cars in the title. That's not to say it was bad and it did win the 2012 Oscar for Best Animated Feature but some measure of Pixar magic seemed to be lost. It's also possible that Cars 2 was sufficiently bad that it knocked the luster off of Pixar and reviewers were primed for revenge.There are a lot of films I've seen that are greater than the sum of their parts but Brave is the rare film that seems less than the sum of its parts because I cannot point to anything in the film that's bad. The animation is spectacular and somewhat of a technological breakthrough that Pixar was crowing about prior to the film's release. The breathtaking Scottish Highlands were the first thing I noticed having such an amazing level of detail and organic feel. The only weakness I saw was that character movements are still somewhat jerky and mechanical. I didn't have any issues with the story or the music and I can't think of any individual scenes that weren't well done so why is it when the whole thing is put together it feels so Un-Pixar like?I've done a lot of thinking about this and I believe one big factor in the failure to connect is due to the darkness of the film. I don't mean the darkness of the plot because quite frankly I think that Up, The Incredibles and WALL-E were darker. It's the physical darkness of the film particularly in the second half of the film. Most of the film takes place in a Scottish castle, at night, lit only by torches on the walls. From the moment Merida leaves the castle after getting in an argument with her mom until right near then end there are almost no well-lit scenes. This is not me saying that this makes the film bad. This is me saying why I believe it didn't connect with a lot of people. On the technical side it is a magnificently crafted film but it lacks the joy of many of the other Pixar films. I would compare it to Wreck-It-Ralph which also came out in 2012 and many might say should have won the Oscar. Wreck-It-Ralph was inventive, bright and full of energy.I've actually discovered that with each additional viewing I enjoy the film more. It is a great film and Brenda Chapmen who wrote and co-directed the film should be proud. It made well over $500 million worldwide which although a bit light for a Pixar film is still a fantastic take. I'm not into the whole Disney Princess thing being an adult male and all but Merida is probably the best, most believable Princess ever to be produced by Disney/Pixar. She is tough and strong but Chapman didn't go overboard as often happens with writers overcompensating for the farer gender. I suspect it's because Chapman IS female that she didn't feel the need to make Merida tougher than any male (except in archery).

Aside from that, however, it is a mere exercise and cannot possibly compare to an Oscar-worthy work of genius such asThe Incredibles.Here the setting seems to be, I don't know, just before the Dark Ages in Scotland. A brash young tomboy, whose father is ""the king"" (I take it he's basically king of his glen and of the three neighboring clans) becomes bored with life as a ""princess"". When an invasion of will o' the wisps lead her to a witch's hut, her destiny is changed for sure. (An example of the occasionally lazy path Pixar takes: the witch's hut is identical to Merlin's hut inMerlin (Special Edition).) I'm certain other films have been raided to help with the scenes, though I was quite taken with the way they presented what I thought was Loch Ness.There is a hilarious scene when the princess returns to the witch's hut, abandoned except for a cauldron, some vials and one of the funniest takes on modern life I have ever seen in film.The remainder of the story, with a loopy and ridiculous plot involving the queen being changed into a giant black bear, is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Mainly this seems to have been made just ... because. It is, I have to admit, a lavish feast for the eyes. And there's no doubt the actors had a blast making it. Yet it still leaves the audience feeling a bit high, dry and bored.If you are a Pixar die-hard fan, have a love of Scottish things, a Scots background of which you are insanely proud but also good-humored, or if you like the idea of Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson voicing the king and queen, then this is for you.

As far as the term `brave' being applied to a girl who is simply fighting for respect and acknowledgement of her own merits against the tyrannical ravings of an overbearing mother who clearly rules the kingdom instead of the permissive caring father/king.......  I'm not certain what I watched was a demonstration of bravery as opposed to squirming out of a mess of her own making.  Merida is a girl who wants to go her own way and when given two grand opportunities to escape, she does just the opposite.  Instead of fleeing for her life, she resorts to trickery to get her mother to see things her way.  She finds a means of finally making her mother shut up and listen, only to have precious little to say to the woman/bear other than they need to find a means of getting out of the trouble she caused.  The fact that the mother/queen has a belated epiphany where her daughter is concerned might have more to do with the desperation to return to her normal form and not angering the only person who might be able to do just that.This movie is loaded with mixed messages.  They barely skirted around the issue of servitude through an arranged marriage to a total stranger.  And what about blind obedience that only serves the person making all the orders/demands?  The same person who charges, ""we can't run away from who we are.""  Who we are, or what someone else wants us to be?  As for celebrating Pixar's first strong female character, I found it incredibly odd that there was a curious lack of female characters in the first place, strong or otherwise.  There was just the domineering mother, the less than dutiful daughter, a wacky witch, and for comic relief a nanny of sorts.  Why?  In this fantasy, were women supposed to be barely seen and never heard?  Evidently, this was a matriarchal society, run by an iron-willed woman, why weren't more women involved in the story?Not my favorite Pixar movie by a long shot.  But.  All the characters save one were fantastic, the art work was spectacular (but fared better on the theater screen than a small screen TV), loads of good humor, some excitement, it's a keeper but not a movie I will watch all that often.As for the viewing problems noted above, I have an older LG Blu-ray player and both the DVD and the Blu-ray disks played just fine in it.",4,"""Never conjure where you carve.""",1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,2403,"['story', 'special', 'care', 'set', 'up', 'mother', 'monster', 'then', 'turn', 'one', 'As', 'far', 'term', 'brave', 'being', 'applied', 'girl', 'who', 'simply', 'fighting', 'respect', 'acknowledgement', 'own', 'merits', 'tyrannical', 'ravings', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'who', 'clearly', 'rules', 'kingdom', 'instead', 'permissive', 'caring', 'father/king', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'watched', 'was', 'demonstration', 'bravery', 'opposed', 'squirming', 'mess', 'own', 'making', 'Merida', 'girl', 'who', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'when', 'given', 'two', 'grand', 'opportunities', 'escape', 'just', 'opposite', 'Instead', 'fleeing', 'life', 'trickery', 'get', 'mother', 'see', 'things', 'way', 'means', 'finally', 'making', 'mother', 'shut', 'up', 'listen', 'only', 'have', 'precious', 'little', 'say', 'woman/bear', 'other', 'need', 'find', 'means', 'getting', 'trouble', 'caused', 'fact', 'mother/queen', 'belated', 'epiphany', 'where', 'daughter', 'concerned', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'desperation', 'return', 'normal', 'form', 'not', 'angering', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'just', 'that.This', 'movie', 'loaded', 'mixed', 'messages', 'barely', 'skirted', 'issue', 'servitude', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'total', 'stranger', 'what', 'blind', 'obedience', 'only', 'person', 'making', 'orders/demands', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'run', 'away', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'what', 'someone', 'else', 'be', 'celebrating', 'Pixar', 'first', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'found', 'incredibly', 'was', 'curious', 'lack', 'female', 'characters', 'first', 'place', 'strong', 'otherwise', 'was', 'just', 'domineering', 'mother', 'less', 'dutiful', 'daughter', 'wacky', 'witch', 'comic', 'relief', 'nanny', 'sorts', 'Why', 'fantasy', 'were', 'women', 'supposed', 'be', 'barely', 'seen', 'never', 'heard', 'Evidently', 'was', 'matriarchal', 'society', 'run', 'iron-willed', 'woman', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'women', 'involved', 'story', 'Not', 'favorite', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'long', 'shot', 'characters', 'save', 'one', 'were', 'fantastic', 'art', 'work', 'was', 'spectacular', 'fared', 'better', 'theater', 'screen', 'small', 'screen', 'TV', 'loads', 'good', 'humor', 'excitement', 'keeper', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'often.As', 'viewing', 'problems', 'noted', 'have', 'older', 'LG', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'disks', 'played', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

1477506,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B005LAIHZY,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[1, 1]","As I begin this review, I should confess I'm not a big Pixar fan. Although I do recognize the charm the films hold, I don't find them as entertaining as most people do. Much of that has to do with the animation style. The environments look great, but I find the human beings to resemble lifeless marionettes many times. The atmospheres of the movies are too ""cute"" for me as well. I'm not big on ""cute"" when it comes to animated movies.All that being said, Disney and Pixar's ""Brave"" is as good as their films come. It has all the right elements of a classic fairy tale with a few twists thrown in to keep things modernized. There's a princess, a witch, and some kooky animals in a faraway land.The only thing missing is a prince to save the day. Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) makes it very clear to her parents that she doesn't need a prince to fulfill her life's ambitions or save her. She wants to live life on her own terms free of the trappings and responsibilities of being royalty.Merida stumbles upon a witch (Julie Walters) that gives her a spell to change the Queen's (Emma Thompson) mind about marrying one of three suitors from other clans. The spell does more than change her mother's mind; it physically transforms her into the most feared creature in the kingdom - a gargantuan bear. Merida frantically looks for a way to change the Queen back before her father (Billy Connolly) and fellow huntsmen track her down. They mistakenly believe her to be the bear that took the King's leg.In usual fashion, there are lessons for everyone to learn in ""Brave."" One is children should be careful what they wish for and value their parents. The other is that parents should give children the freedom to choose their own paths in life. It wouldn't be a Disney or Pixar movie without some sort of words of wisdom.""Brave"" is successful as a whole. I'm glad I gave it a chance after skipping it in theaters. The initial marketing campaign for the movie offered no real motivation for me to see it in theaters. I did get a bit frustrated during the climax with some of Merida's illogical decisions. The different settings in the film really do carry you away to a fantasy world and help put you into the middle of the story and action.The movie looks and sounds phenomenal in its high-definition version. Merida's bright red hair magically stands out against the backdrops of dark green meadows and grey castle walls. All the sounds of waterfalls and roaring bears mixed with cultural musical numbers spring to life through an elegant 7.1 surround mix.There's plenty of special bonus material to give consumers their money's worth. Director Mark Andrews, co-director Steve Purcell, story supervisor Brian Larsen, and Editor Nick Smith all provide commentary for the film. It also includes two shorts entitled ""The Legend of Mordu"" and ""La Luna."" ""The Legend of Mordu"" features the witch from ""Brave"" telling the story of the Demon Bear. We get eight ""behind-the-scenes"" featurettes, four extended scenes, an alternate opening, several art galleries, and plenty more.Disney / Pixar's 5-Disc Combo Pack of ""Brave"" has everything admirers of the movie could want. You can choose whether you want to watch it in 3D or 2D. The different formats make it easy to view anywhere on any sort of device. If you're curious how the movie was created there's plenty of ""making of"" and ""behind-the-scenes"" material to educate you.

Many went this summer to see Brave to see for themselves if Pixar was going to be giving us another great Pixar film, or a Pixar film that is better than most but poor in comparison to their other films. I took my 5 year old son with this goal in mind.I must say that Pixar returned to the fold of giving a great story with beautiful animations like they have in the past. Brave will not stand up to some of the greater Pixar films (and in my opinion those are Monsters Inc, UP, Toy Story 3, and Incredibles) but it is far better than some of the worst (Cars, Cars 2, Bugs life...once again my opinion). It sits right in the middle IMO of all of the Pixar films. And lets be honest, with respect to all other animated films...or live action for that matter, being an average to above average Pixar films is better than 95% of what else is out there.***Spoilerish***The story is about a young princess and her mother for the most part. The young girl is a free spirit while her mother, the queen, is attempting to train her to be a presentable future queen. The young girl is set to be married to one of three princes that, as tradition dictates, are to compete for her hand. The young princess decides to compete for her own hand to free herself from her obligations. This does not set well with the queen and results in a large fight that ends with the princess running away to a witch and asking her help to change her destiny. Let's just say that you should always be careful what you wish for and her actions result in the kingdom falling into disarray. While the kingdom is falling apart, the young princess works to figure out a way to turn back her decisions and mend the battered relationship between her and the queen.There is plenty of humor to keep the kids interested and plenty of adult humor to keep the parents from nodding off.

Just watching how Merida's (the main female character) long curly red hair moves in a wonder in and of itself.  Animation is just getting better and better.As are the plots for many animation movies.  I didn't see this movie in the theatre, a decision which I now regret.  But I sat down to watch it based on the idea of a main female protagonist and with a love of all things Scottish.  I was not disappointed.  The humor was great, if crude at times, and the Scots characters covered a spectrum as displayed by the different virtues and vices of each clan.Merida is a princess and is expected to wed one of the three sons of the other three clans.  Her own father is head of the fourth clan, and she discovers a clause so that she can ""fight"" for her own hand and takes part in the contests.  Of course, she is a wild girl who can ride, hunt, and shoot with the best and resents her much more dignified and formal mother's attempts to make a real ""lady"" out of her.  She resists what she sees as her Fate and so discovers that the question about Princess vs Rebel was never so far apart as she first thought.This is a real mother-daughter picture, one that brings the two together as they fight to overcome the results of a badly-chosen spell.  In-between the funny scenes, we see how they each learn to really see each other, rather than their expectations of each other.The movie has many elements (especially how people speak) woven into the (somewhat) more historical ones, so it will appeal to a modern audience.  Fortunately, it isn't too distracting.  There is enough action that most kids won't get too bored, but I would recommend this movie more for 8 year olds and up than any younger ones.

Denick,"[0, 0]","For those of you who don't know, Stephen Colbert is a hilarious fellow who runs his own political/comedy show, called ""The Colbert Report"" on Comedy Central. Among Colbert's more humorous quirks is an all-consuming, quite irrational fear of bears. He seems to believe they are out to get him at every opportunity, and that they may very well be bent on conquering the world itself. As such, he would probably soil his shorts by watching ""Brave"", as this movie is chock-full of bears... most of which are adorable, but some of which are quite scary.If you share Colbert's weird fear of bears, steer clear of ""Brave"", for it will undoubtedly give you night terrors for a solid fortnight. Personally, I think bears are awesome, and Pixar's rendering of them in this beautifully animated movie is nothing short of breathtaking. The other elements of animation are likewise up to the studio's industry-leading standards, and this movie is just as visually impressive as anything else in their formidable stable. These guys can create vibrant, immersing worlds like nobody else.The story, while somewhat simplistic, is also great. At first, I was a bit hesitant as the plot began to unfurl, as I feel that the ""angst-ridden teenager whom nobody understands"" theme has been ridden to death, and I couldn't believe that Pixar would go down that road. However, I was happy to see that the movie soon took on unexpected twists and turns, and delivers an exciting, heart warming tale that even Stephen Colbert would enjoy (should he be able to look past the scary bears).

And Brave is one of the good ones!Set in 10th Century Scotland, Merida is a Scottish princess and her parents are preparing to marry her off in a manner consistent with the times. Her hand in marriage shall go to the prince of one of the neighboring clans; the one who can best prove his worth by winning a competition in some area of traditional masculinity. But spunky Merida has plans of her own, she carefully chooses archery as the designated contest and then boldly competes herself to win her right to stay single.When that doesn't work, Merida follows the woodland wisps to seek her fate.  She makes a bargain with a witch exchanging her valuable necklace for a spell to make her mother understand her better.  Suffice it to say that the  result was unexpected.Mixing accurate historical Scotland with ancient folklore, this charming little film does a terrific job of depicting current family issues and the underlying love that provides the family foundation.The scenery are based on real settings in Scotland and were breathtaking in brilliant colors.But the thing I really loved about the film was the strong female protagonist who was both physically and emotionally tough. A heroine with a mind of her own, who doesn't need a man to complete her. These are the types of characters that I want my daughters to grow up with.Well-done, Pixar!!",4,Bravo for Brave!,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,1445,"['mother', 'two', 'daughters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'children', 'movies', 'past', 'decade', 'Brave', 'one', 'good', 'ones', 'Set', '10th', 'Century', 'Scotland', 'Merida', 'Scottish', 'princess', 'parents', 'are', 'preparing', 'marry', 'off', 'manner', 'consistent', 'times', 'hand', 'marriage', 'shall', 'go', 'prince', 'one', 'neighboring', 'clans', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'best', 'prove', 'worth', 'winning', 'competition', 'area', 'traditional', 'masculinity', 'spunky', 'Merida', 'plans', 'own', 'carefully', 'archery', 'designated', 'contest', 'then', 'boldly', 'win', 'right', 'stay', 'single.When', ""n't"", 'work', 'Merida', 'woodland', 'wisps', 'seek', 'fate', 'bargain', 'witch', 'exchanging', 'valuable', 'necklace', 'spell', 'make', 'mother', 'understand', 'better', 'Suffice', 'say', 'result', 'was', 'unexpected.Mixing', 'accurate', 'historical', 'Scotland', 'ancient', 'folklore', 'charming', 'little', 'film', 'terrific', 'job', 'depicting', 'current', 'family', 'issues', 'underlying', 'love', 'family', 'foundation.The', 'scenery', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'settings', 'Scotland', 'were', 'breathtaking', 'brilliant', 'colors.But', 'thing', 'really', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'strong', 'female', 'protagonist', 'who', 'was', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'tough', 'heroine', 'mind', 'own', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'man', 'complete', 'are', 'types', 'characters', 'want', 'daughters', 'grow', 'up', 'with.Well-done', 'Pixar']",N/A

The almost infinite details fill every millimeter of the home screen.Brave is a sweeping epic tale, but it's also an intimate examination of mother/daughter relationship. Although I enjoyed the film and saw it twice in theaters, as a dad and husband, I found the scene in which Merida gives her mother something to ingest that could be extremely harmful or fateful, is kind of difficult to take. Merida then snaps into denial of wrongdoing, which pushes more than a few buttons.But I'm not a Mom or a daughter. When I saw the film with two sets of each, they resoundingly loved the film with absolutely no reservations. Being mothers of teen daughters, they each agreed that of course, the girl would be driven to risk anything to make her mother change, not considering the consequences and, yes, not owning up to it.How Merida does face the impact of her actions, the fate of the kingdom, and her parental issues, is the heart of Brave, and what you must experience from beginning to end. Few films, animated or not, take a character through such a character arc in such a plausible, believable way. The Brady Bunch this ain't.The magnificent score by Patrick Doyle is as epic as the film, and the voice cast is ideal. Pains were taken to make things as authentic as possible, as evidenced by the bonus features.And what a feast of bonus features there are, at least on the Blu-ray. The DVD does contain the audio commentary (thank you!) and two short films, but depending on which Blu-ray set you choose, you get a lot of cool stuff.Basically the 3-disc ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" includes everything that the 5-disc Disney/Pixar's Brave: The Ultimate Collector's Edition does except for a Blu-ray 3-D disc and a digital download disc.Here's are the bonus features:DISC ONE / FEATURE FILM* Audio Commentary* Short Films1.

Pixar has had such a wildly successful run of animated films, one wondered how long the streak could be sustained. I guess the uneasy murmurs first surfaced when CARS 2 was critically panned. And now here's BRAVE, and murmur, murmur, murmur. And I liked BRAVE, quite liked it. But we grade on a curve when it comes to Pixar products. And as much as I favor BRAVE, it doesn't hold up to WALL-E or UP or FINDING NEMO or the TOY STORY franchise. Any other animated studio, and odds are I would've cast a more generous eye. But Pixar's standards are so lofty... I rate BRAVE 3.5 out of 5 stars. Kids will adore this movie. The grown-ups should maybe temper expectations.It doesn't flaunt the originality of the Pixar classics. If anything, BRAVE wanders into the more familiar territory of Pixar's corporate partner, Disney. Set in an ancient and more mystical version of Scotland, the story revolves around Merida (Kelly Macdonald), a teenaged princess who rebels against a time-honored custom. Her doting father, King Fergus (Billy Connolly), may've erred in presenting her with a bow and arrows when she was a wee lass. Today Merida is very much a tomboy and has no use for the fineries of her status. When not besieged by her mother's unending instructions on history and proper royal decorum, Merida prefers to roam the craggy landscape and practice her archery. So imagine her collosal pique when her mother informs her that, as per tradition, the time has come for her to choose from three suitors.Maybe Pixar was going for irony when they released BRAVE only a week after Father's Day. The film's central conflict lies between Merida and her exacting mother, Queen Eleanor (Emma Thompson). After a hurtful argument with her mom, Merida flees into the dark woods and stumbles onto a sketchy cottage in the wilds. In the cottage she finds a woodcarving old hag (Julie Walters), except does a woodcarver's home routinely feature a surprisingly mobile broom and a creepy talking bird? Merida is desperate to change her fate. The ""woodcarver"" has got something for her.Beware the deal with the devil, the wish granted by the genie of the lamp, and the witch's spell. These never come out right for us foolish mortals. Merida's bargain leaves dreadful repercussions, and it's a bit frustrating that Merida repeatedly refuses to acknowledge any blame. The plot twist, the fallout to Merida's waywardness, is pretty unexpected - unless you knew the film's original title (which I won't mention). But, ugh... I think what follows underscores some folks' big quibble, which is that the film fails somewhat to deliver on the storytelling. As mentioned, this wouldn't be as telling if BRAVE had come out from other studios. But Pixar pictures are celebrated for their cleverness and inventiveness and rich emotional beats. BRAVE, compared to its predecessors (excepting CARS 2), presents a relatively uninspired narrative.I wonder what effect director Brenda Chapman's being replaced had on the film? Because, ultimately, not everything comes together for this film, and this so is unlike Pixar. There are darker, scarier moments in the film which are then offset by a brawny and obvious form of levity. Aside from Merida and Queen Eleanor's depiction, characterization for the cast is doled out in broad strokes. Not to say that I didn't like the cast. King Fergus and the triplet scamps are all endearing as hell, but they're there mostly for comic relief. But if you thought the plot thread with the three hapless suitors is going somewhere, no, it fizzles out. The visiting members of the various clans are stereotyped to the kilt. So brace up for a steady diet of spit takes, brawling, carousing, and mooning (yes, mooning). Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd, and Craig Ferguson as the four contentious Scottish lairds are admittedly great fun. Again, I wish they'd been developed more.I know I've bagged on it, but I do recommend BRAVE. The visuals are sublime, and I'm sure it's no coincidence that your eyes are immediately drawn to Merida's fiery, untamed hair. Merida's tresses are so meticulously animated that Rapunzel's hair is gnashing its teeth (to mangle a metaphor). The Scottish Highlands are rendered in grand and panoramic detail. I love the design of the characters, the animators having leaned toward a stylized approach rather than a realistic one. Merida has got this distinctive moon face. It separates her from the other Disney princesses. And then there's Kelly Macdonald's marvelously expressive Scottish brogue. I could listen to her talk all day.Also setting Merida apart is her remarkable aptitude for archery. In recent months, we'd already eyeballed Katniss Everdeen and the Avengers' Hawkeye. Merida's marksmanship rivals that of those two. There's a gratifying scene in which she Robin Hoods her way thru an archery competition, but then gets chewed out by her mum for her trouble. Yeah, Merida sometimes comes across as a brat, but you never doubt that her heart is in the right place. You never doubt that this family loves each other to pieces. Were you concerned that Merida won't be able to reverse the calamitous spell before the second sunrise deadline? Me neither. Ah, but will she own up to her bad behavior? Um...I don't recommend viewing this in the 3D version, by the way. You just can't see anything during the night sequences, and there are heaps of night sequences. Also, you're in for a treat with the captivating animated short LA LUNA, which precedes the feature film. In it, a little boy learns the secret family business, which is awesome.",4,Merida places her weapon on the table and rages against fate,1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,5650,"['Yikes', 'Pixar',

1477600,A2RE5ZLL3RB084,B005LAIHZY,H. P.,"[26, 43]","Forcing a young woman into marriage when she is not ready does not make her happy and is generally agreed upon, outside a few uber-religious communities, as not the right thing to do.  The latest Disney heroine to take on the concept is Merida, protagonist of ""Brave,"" a rebellious redhead with a prowess in archery as a result of a gift bestowed upon her by a boisterous but loving father.  This is much to the dismay of her mother who wishes her to take on what many today regard as an antiquated feminine role of passivity and elegance.  The process with which she must choose her husband involves a competition among her suitors in an activity of her choice, which turns out to be--you guessed it--archery.  Needless to say, Merida, in a toast to girl power, shows up her three mediocre, socially-inept suitors with her own archery skills and proceeds to address her overall marital issue through a spell that changes the one forcing the marriage issue, her mother, into a bear.  This provides for some intense moments as Merida is forced to defend and care for her mother in light of her father who is determined to avenge a lost limb by killing the bear.The problems with this story are twofold:  First, fighting forced marriage is bit like fighting the Holy Roman Empire.  It is a noble fight but the enemy really doesn't exist anymore, outside a few cloistered segments of society, with whom most of the audience probably doesn't associate anyways.  Plus, Jasmine and Mulan already fought that battle, succeeded, and had presumably brought even the most obstinate detractors onboard.  Second, it is unclear exactly how showing up her suitors or turning her mother into a bear helped to win her case.  She proved that she had better aim than her suitors, but so what?  Many a successful husband has been landed without the foggiest notion on how to operate a bow-and-arrow.  Then, the bear bit showed that she could take care of her mother in spite of an army of adversaries led by none other than her father.  But again, so what?  If the mother's motivation for a forced marriage was the security of the kingdom, would such an antic really eliminate that notion?The final product feels like a rush job, where several individuals of varying interests were summoned to assemble a product to meet various business objectives, with the story secondary.  The product should be the first Pixar to feature a female lead to tap into the young, soccer-playing girls who find it gratifying to show up their male counterparts.  Check.  It should have some fights so that the young male audience doesn't perceive it as a ""girl's movie"" and avoid it.  Check.  It should showcase Pixar's animation to be a cut above anything produced elsewhere.  Check.  It should include some magic or witchcraft so that it does not come across as an animated version of a Jane Austen novel.  Check.In spite of its splendid animation, the movie ultimately fails not because of its female protagonist or its magic.  It fails because of a flawed story concerning an overused adversary.",2,Stunning Animation but a Lackluster Story,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,3061,"['Forcing', 'young', 'woman', 'marriage', 'when', 'not', 'ready', 'not', 'make', 'happy', 'generally', 'agreed', 'few', 'uber-religious', 'communities', 'not', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'latest', 'Disney', 'heroine', 'take', 'concept', 'Merida', 'protagonist', 'Brave', 'rebellious', 'redhead', 'prowess', 'archery', 'result', 'gift', 'bestowed', 'boisterous', 'loving', 'father', 'much', 'dismay', 'mother', 'who', 'take', 'what', 'many', 'today', 'regard', 'antiquated', 'feminine', 'role', 'passivity', 'elegance', 'process', 'must', 'choose', 'husband', 'competition', 'suitors', 'activity', 'choice', 'out', 'be', 'guessed', 'archery', 'Needless', 'say', 'Merida', 'toast', 'girl', 'power', 'up', 'three', 'mediocre', 'socially-inept', 'suitors', 'own', 'archery', 'skills', 'proceeds', 'address', 'overall', 'marital', 'issue', 'spell', 'one', 'forcing', 'marriage', 'issue', 'mother', 'bear', 'intense', 'moments', 'Merida', 'forced', 'defend', 'care', 'mother', 'light', 'father', 'who', 'determined', 'avenge', 'lost', 'limb', 'killing', 'bear.The', 'problems', 'story', 'are', 'twofold', 'First', 'fighting', 'forced', 'marriage', 'bit', 'fighting', 'Holy', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'noble', 'fight', 'enemy', 'really', ""n't"", 'exist', 'anymore', 'few', 'cloistered', 'segments', 'society', 'whom', 'most', 'audience', 'probably', ""n't"", 'associate', 'anyways', 'Jasmine', 'Mulan', 'already', 'fought', 'battle', 'succeeded', 'had', 'presumably', 'brought', 'even', 'most', 'obstinate', 'detractors', 'onboard', 'Second', 'unclear', 'exactly', 'how', 'showing', 'up', 'suitors', 'turning', 'mother', 'bear', 'helped', 'win', 'case', 'proved', 'had', 'better', 'aim', 'suitors', 'so', 'what', 'successful', 'husband', 'been', 'landed', 'foggiest', 'notion', 'how', 'operate', 'bow-and-arrow', 'Then', 'bear', 'bit', 'showed', 'could', 'take', 'care', 'mother', 'spite', 'army', 'adversaries', 'led', 'none', 'other', 'father', 'again', 'what', 'mother', 'motivation', 'forced', 'marriage', 'was', 'security', 'kingdom', 'would', 'such', 'antic', 'really', 'eliminate', 'notion', 'final', 'product', 'feels', 'rush', 'job', 'where', 'several', 'individuals', 'varying', 'interests', 'were', 'summoned', 'assemble', 'product', 'meet', 'various', 'business', 'objectives', 'story', 'secondary', 'product', 'should', 'be', 'first', 'Pixar', 'feature', 'female', 'lead', 'tap', 'young', 'soccer-playing', 'girls', 'who', 'find', 'gratifying', 'show', 'up', 'male', 'counterparts', 'Check', 'should', 'have', 'fights', 'young', 'male', 'audience', ""n't"", 'perceive', 'girl', 'movie', 'avoid', 'Check', 'should', 'showcase', 'Pixar', 'animation', 'be', 'cut', 'anything', 'produced', 'elsewhere', 'Check', 'should', 'include', 'magic', 'witchcraft', 'so', 'not', 'come', 'animated', 'version', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'Check.In', 'spite', 'splendid', 'animation', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'not', 'female', 'protagonist', 'magic', 'flawed', 'story', 'concerning', 'overused', 'adversary']",N/A

However, with the right story, CGI films can certainly hold their own. Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films are great examples of superlative CGI films. Well, with Brave, the CGI technique has reached a high level. The background scenery of the Scottish Highlands, combined with the Celtic music score, drew me right into the atmosphere of medieval Scotland. And that most difficult of items to depict in CGI, hair and fur, was done magnificently. Watch the mane on Merida's horse, Angus, as it moves & flows while the horse runs...gorgeous! There was exhilaration in the gallops Merida & Angus took when she had a day free of lessons, and the will o' the wisps had a shimmery, magical quality. The first half of the movie had me captivated, although I did find the male characters drawn too broadly....all buffoons....with none of the subtlety of the female characters, especially the Queen. However, once the plot veered off into the changes Merida wrought on her mother, the Queen, I found the story to be far less interesting. It seemed to strain both credulity and logic, and the resolution of an ancient legend seemed confusing and tangential to the mother/daughter conflict. At least, that was my reaction during a first viewing of the film in a theater. However, on a 2nd viewing at home, I thoroughly enjoyed both halves of the movie. It made more sense, and I no longer had unrealistic expectations of what the movie would be like. I found it exciting, that it captured my attention throughout, and the storyline made sense. It was a departure for Pixar to have a female lead, and I applaud them for finally breaking away from their previously male-centric movies. Also, the female leads were just the right degree between the helpless princess and the pseudo-male wannabes like Mulan.

I mean, really, we need to stop teaching our daughters this! And Brave begins with this independent sassy girl who hates being prim and proper, would much rather be a tomboy and shoot arrows and ride her horse. She's still a girl and just not ready to grow up. She reminds me so much of my  daughter, Ella.Spoilers Alert Ahead, scroll to bottom to avoid!So when her parents announce she will be married off to keep the peace between the Kingdoms, she is beyond unhappy. Merida doesn't want to be a PRINCESS, let alone a WIFE. Her mother just won't listen, and her mother, the Queen, thinks Merida just won't listen, either, as peace is at stake if she doesn't comply. Neither understands the other.When the suitors arrive, her parents announce only the firstborn from each royal family may shoot for Merida's hand in marriage, which gives Merida a great idea. Being the excellent marksman, or girl, that she is, she announces after everyone has gone, and shot poorly, that she will be shooting for her own hand.This is one of my favorite scenes as she really defies her mother here, publicly, while rejecting all her suitors and standing up for herself and what she wants. Of course, her and mom get into a major fight, in which the Queen tosses Merida's precious bow into the fireplace, breaking her daughter's heart and sending Merida running from her home on horseback in tears.Soon, she discovers a witch, whom she begs for the power just to change her mother. Merida hopes this will change her mind about the whole marriage and be done with, things can go back to normal. The witch gives her a tart to feed the Queen, promising her mom will change.What Merida doesn't expect is that her mom changes into a bear, the very animal her father hates the most for taking his leg. The witch promised her a change, but her mom changes physically, not internally, like Merida expected. Fearing the King won't understand or believe his wife is a bear and may try to kill her, Merida and her mother flee the kingdom.They of course return to the witches Hut to no avail, she simply left a message about fixing what has come undone by the next day or permanently becoming a bear, but the witch herself is gone.Frustrated, guilty and sad, Merida tries to care for her mother and apologizes as they make do I'm the wild. It is entertaining to watch as the prim and proper queen turned bear tries to keep her manners about her while in her new form.  She makes eating utensils from branches, just to have them fling about. She tries to slowly eat fish at first, making Merida cook it, before impatience kicks in and it isn't long before she is ravishing fish cold and alive with get bear claws.The two begin to share and form a new bond as her mother lives as a bear in the wild with Merida, doing things and learning things from her daughter.  Merida, in contrast learns more about the different Kingdoms and their fall as they stumble upon another bear, this one once human also, cursed like her mother,a part of what she thought was just a fairytale proved to be true. Merida finally sees the importance of all the Kingdoms uniting, and her role in it, when she realizes how they came apart; with this one brother, power hungry to control them all, became a beast. This bear who took her fathers leg.Thinking they must return home to repair a tapestry, they sneak back into their castle, where they find everyone growing more restless. Merida decides to announce her decision, but her mother, posing as a bear statue at the back of the room, redirects her otherwise. Finally understanding one another, through time spent and a bond deeper than any ocean, this mother and daughter love each other so much.By the end of this movie, I had shed more than a few tears and was glad just me and my daughter were watching it together the first time. She came and sat on my lap in the theatre, she's six and doesn't often do that, so I think it affected her greatly, too. When it came out I managed to get it on Black Friday and put it up for her for xmas, along with a few other Brave goodies. Ella was thrilled, she loves the movie so much, she's watched it almost every day following xmas the first week and often since then. She took the regular dvd copy to her dads so she could continue watching it there.Such a brilliant movie, and I was thrilled it didn't revolve around romantic love for a change, as that seems shoved down kids throats these days with Disney princess'and all, not that we dislike those movies, this was just VERY refreshing and heartwarming and a great mother/daughter movie that we continue to enjoy and love together.

We hear this familiar cry many times during the course of this exciting PG-rated film. A doughty red-haired girl and her faithful horse are up against an old curse that has turned one Scottish clan against another. Not only that, our willful and stubborn princess is in full revolt against her mother's attempts to turn her into a lady. She would much rather be in the forest with her bow and arrows, or climbing rocks to test her courage.The combination of Pixar and Disney gives us wonderful emotion, with the mother's subtle expressions that ring true, plus stunningly realistic animals: the horse in particular is amazing, although the bear is good, too. (I didn't like the dogs.)Voiced by:* Kelly Macdonald (""Boardwalk Empire"") is Merida, our tomboy princess, who has long curly red hair and blue eyes, the perfect Scots lass. Ms Macdonald was born in Scotland, but as an actress, she plays any nationality (""No Country For Old Men""); here we are treated to an authentic Scots' brogue.* Emma Thompson (""Men in Black III"") is exquisite as a frustrated Queen Elinor, struggling with her rebellious daughter who does NOT want to be a lady!* Billy Connolly (""Gulliver's Travels"") is King Fergus, rambunctious, brawling, and with one peg leg, due to an historic bout with a bear many years ago.* Julie Walters (""Momma Mia!"") cackles her way around our heroine as The Witch, full of more trickery than teeth.Animation gets better and better, plus the sound was outstanding. The horse's hoof-beats were clearly those of a massive Clydesdale rather than a regular-size riding horse. Don't ask me how I know....Expect lots of brawling, chaotic chase scenes and a truly violent fight between two bears. Bloodless, but with lots of roaring, claws and teeth. Not a child in our packed screening audience moved a muscle, so I'll be sure to tell my JayFlix.net folks when Amazon has this available on DVD.Surprisingly, even though this is Disney, there was no Prince Charming, our little heroine is pretty self sufficient; and then, because this is Disney, our heroine finally owns up to her mistakes and admits it when something IS her fault!

1477691,A3NMW51418AO9M,B005LAIHZY,John S. Reid,"[20, 27]","This is an addition to my original review (below).After viewing this film for a third time, I finally determined where the real fault lies in the story.  Merida (the princess) wants to change tradition (i.e., her marriage to the winner of a contest).  But the problem is, she does absolutely nothing to earn the RIGHT to challenge the tradition.  That is, Merida does not place her own personal safety at stake, nor does she redeem anyone by taking her position (e.g., by personally saving the soul of the ghost-bear prince).  If she had placed her own interests at risk, or accomplished something grand or noble by taking her position, then she would have earned the right to challenge tradition.  But ... she did nothing.  Rather, it was her mother (Elinor) who changed.  In short, the ostensible heroine of the story (i.e., Merida) did nothing meritorious - she was only ""brave"" in being a defiant child.  And what lesson does that teach?My original review:With over 2000 reviews written thus far, it's unlikely that anyone will read my review.  Notwithstanding, here I go.First of all, let me say that the animation is superb - what Pixar has done in the way of animating hair and water is simply amazing.  The forest scenes in the early part of the film are works of art.Now, to my major problems with the film.  Yes, I understand that the ""moral"" of the story is about being brave in choosing and pursuing your own destiny.  What I simply don't get is why the mother (Elinor) underwent such a radical change in personality (going over to accept her daughter's views) merely as a result of her transformation to a bear.  There was simply nothing in the mother's experience as a bear which would explain this transformation of personality.  Yes, there is the whole ""fish"" scene, and the ""rescue from the evil bear"" scene, but I just don't see why either experience should convince the mother that she was wrong in her views, and that her daughter (Merida) was right.  Plus, it does not seem that any lesson was learned by Merida, the ostensible heroine of the story (a major shortfall in story telling).  In fact, it seems to me that the story is more about the mother (Elinor), and what she learned as a result of her experiences.  But, as said, the story falls short to that end.  Plus, there is the whole confusing thread of ""legends are lessons"" - what lesson was learned by whom and as a result of the story told?  Merida did not save her mother - it was the mother who saved herself from the ""evil bear"".  So, in my opinion, not good story telling.John Lassiter (the father of Pixar) is on record as being a great admirer of the films of Hayao Miyazaki (as am I).  In Brave Lassiter attempts to create a ""young heroine"" story line, perhaps along the lines of Miyazaki's Spirited Away, or Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind.  But Lassiter falls short in Brave.  That is, the ostensible heroine of Brave (i.e., Merida) does not place her own life at risk in order to save those whom she loves (or for a greater ideal).  In Brave, Merida's greatest contribution to the salvation of her mother is merely placing the stitched-together tapestry over her mother.  It was not Merida who saved the day, but rather her mother, Elinor.  So what lesson is to be learned from this film?  Nothing, so far as I can discern.  Merida (the daughter) did not ""save the day"", and Elinor (the mother) underwent a transformation in personality with no satisfactory explanation as to why that occurred.  In the end, a confusing story line as to what was learned by who, and why.",3,Not a solid story,1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,3570,"['addition', 'original', 'review', '.After', 'viewing', 'film', 'third', 'time', 'finally', 'determined', 'where', 'real', 'fault', 'story', 'Merida', 'princess', 'change', 'tradition', 'i.e.', 'marriage', 'winner', 'contest', 'problem', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'earn', 'RIGHT', 'challenge', 'tradition', 'Merida', 'not', 'place', 'own', 'personal', 'safety', 'stake', 'redeem', 'anyone', 'taking', 'position', 'e.g.', 'personally', 'saving', 'soul', 'ghost-bear', 'prince', 'had', 'placed', 'own', 'interests', 'risk', 'accomplished', 'something', 'grand', 'noble', 'taking', 'position', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'earned', 'right', 'challenge', 'tradition', 'did', 'nothing', 'Rather', 'was', 'mother', 'Elinor', 'who', 'changed', 'short', 'ostensible', 'heroine', 'story', 'i.e.', 'Merida', 'did', 'nothing', 'meritorious', 'was', 'only', 'brave', 'being', 'defiant', 'child', 'what', 'lesson', 'teach', 'My', 'original', 'review', '2000', 'reviews', 'written', 'thus', 'far', 'unlikely', 'anyone', 'will', 'read', 'review', 'Notwithstanding', 'here', 'go.First', 'let', 'say', 'animation', 'superb', 'what', 'Pixar', 'done', 'way', 'animating', 'hair', 'water', 'simply', 'amazing', 'forest', 'scenes', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'are', 'works', 'art.Now', 'major', 'problems', 'film', 'Yes', 'understand', 'moral', 'story', 'being', 'brave', 'choosing', 'pursuing', 'own', 'destiny', 'What', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'mother', 'Elinor', 'underwent', 'such', 'radical', 'change', 'personality', 'going', 'accept', 'daughter', 'views', 'merely', 'result', 'transformation', 'bear', 'was', 'simply', 'nothing', 'mother', 'experience', 'bear', 'would', 'explain', 'transformation', 'personality', 'Yes', 'whole', 'fish', 'scene', 'rescue', 'evil', 'bear', 'scene', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'experience', 'should', 'convince', 'mother', 'was', 'wrong', 'views', 'daughter', 'Merida', 'was', 'right', 'not', 'seem', 'lesson', 'was', 'learned', 'Merida', 'ostensible', 'heroine', 'story', 'major', 'shortfall', 'story', 'telling', 'fact', 'story', 'more', 'mother', 'Elinor', 'what', 'learned', 'result', 'experiences', 'said', 'story', 'short', 'end', 'whole', 'confusing', 'thread', 'legends', 'are', 'lessons', 'what', 'lesson', 'was', 'learned', 'whom', 'result', 'story', 'told', 'Merida', 'did', 'not', 'save', 'mother', 'was', 'mother', 'who', 'saved', 'evil', 'bear', 'So', 'opinion', 'not', 'good', 'story', 'telling.John', 'Lassiter', 'father', 'Pixar', 'record', 'being', 'great', 'admirer', 'films', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'am', 'Brave', 'Lassiter', 'attempts', 'create', 'young', 'heroine', 'story', 'line', 'perhaps', 'lines', 'Miyazaki', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Nausica', 'auml', 'Valley', 'Wind', 'Lassiter', 'short', 'Brave', 'ostensible', 'heroine', 'Brave', 'i.e.', 'Merida', 'not', 'place', 'own', 'life', 'risk', 'order', 'save', 'whom', 'greater', 'ideal', 'Brave', 'Merida', 'greatest', 'contribution', 'salvation', 'mother', 'merely', 'placing', 'stitched-together', 'tapestry', 'mother', 'was', 'not', 'Merida', 'who', 'saved', 'day', 'rather', 'mother', 'Elinor', 'what', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'film', 'Nothing', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'discern', 'Merida', 'daughter', 'did', 'not', 'save', 'day', 'Elinor', 'mother', 'underwent', 'transformation', 'personality', 'satisfactory', 'explanation', 'why', 'occurred', 'end', 'confusing', 'story', 'line', 'what', 'was', 'learned', 'who', 'why']",N/A

Even at the ripe old age of maybe 5, little Merida is headstrong, bright, and bubbly.  And she sees the wisps, a kind of blue fairy type light that sends her in certain directions.We watch Princess Merida grow, and be instructed in the ways of a Princess by her ""Mum,"" the Queen.  Now that she is of age, Mum decides it is time to have a suitor party so the gents can compete for her hand.  But Merida has a mind of her own.

1477743,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B005LAIHZY,Kenya Starflight,"[1, 1]","Ever since the first ""Toy Story"" film rolled into theaters, I have greatly enjoyed Pixar's contributions to Disney's animated films.  It seems that no matter what genre they decide to tackle, be it superhero movies (The Incredibles), dystopian science fiction (WALL-E), tearjerking Oscar contenders (Up), and even culinary movies (Ratatoullie), they come up with winners.  Even their critically panned ""Cars"" movies have been a step above a lot of modern animated movies, and I can't think of with a single Pixar film that I didn't just enjoy, but love.""Brave"" is no exception.  And after so many years of suffering through the pastel-colored, girly-girl world of the Disney Princesses, it's refreshing and wonderful to see a princess who can hold her own.  And the film looks gorgeous to boot.""Brave"" chronicles the story of Merida, princess of a Scottish kingdom who prefers horseback-riding and archery to etiquette and embroidery, much to the consternation of her proper and dignified mother.  When her mother announces that Merida must soon marry in order to prevent a clan feud from overtaking the kingdom, she runs away and decides to change her fate by consulting an eccentric witch in the forest.  The witch grants her wish... but it comes at an unexpected cost, and Merida must take responsibility and act quickly to save both her mother and the kingdom from the consequences of the spell.This film looks absolutely stunning -- Pixar apparently had to rewrite its graphics software for this movie, and it shows in graphics that are top notch.  The Scottish highlands serve as a magnificent backdrop for this story, creating a world that looks almost real.  Hair and fur are well-rendered as well -- Merida's hair in particular is a wild tangle that must have been a nightmare to render but looks real enough to touch.The story has come under criticism by some for being ""average"" and not showcasing Merida's talents enough.  I feel it's a wonderful fairy tale, however, and is a great coming-of-age story.  And the moral of the story is a timely one that I think all children and parents should learn -- that our choices have consequences, and we must take responsibility for our actions, for better or for worse.I must also give special mention to the sounds of this movie -- the music and the voice cast.  The music, a combination of traditional orchestral score and bagpipe music, fits the story like a glove, with additional vocal songs woven in seamlessly.  And after seeing so many films that are supposed to take place in foreign countries but have a jarrinly American-sounding voice cast, it's refreshing to hear authentic British and Scottish voices in this film.  The voice cast does a wonderful job bringing the characters to life.I personally consider this one of Pixar's best films yet, and one of the best Disney fairy tales and princess stories in a long time.  Merida is a worthy addition to the Disney Princess roster, and could probably run circles around Snow White and Cinderella (though I think she'd get along well with Mulan...).  Best suited for children 8 and up due to some scary moments.",5,"Pixar tackles the ""princess"" tale... and comes out a winner",1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,3124,"['Ever', 'first', 'Toy', 'Story', 'film', 'rolled', 'theaters', 'have', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'Pixar', 'contributions', 'Disney', 'animated', 'films', 'matter', 'what', 'decide', 'tackle', 'be', 'superhero', 'movies', 'Incredibles', 'dystopian', 'science', 'fiction', 'WALL-E', 'tearjerking', 'Oscar', 'contenders', 'Up', 'even', 'culinary', 'movies', 'Ratatoullie', 'come', 'up', 'winners', 'Even', 'critically', 'panned', 'Cars', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'step', 'lot', 'modern', 'animated', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'Pixar', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'enjoy', 'love', 'Brave', 'exception', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'suffering', 'pastel-colored', 'girly-girl', 'world', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'refreshing', 'wonderful', 'see', 'princess', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'boot', 'Brave', 'story', 'Merida', 'princess', 'Scottish', 'kingdom', 'who', 'horseback-riding', 'archery', 'etiquette', 'embroidery', 'much', 'consternation', 'proper', 'dignified', 'mother', 'When', 'mother', 'announces', 'Merida', 'must', 'soon', 'marry', 'order', 'prevent', 'clan', 'feud', 'overtaking', 'kingdom', 'away', 'change', 'fate', 'consulting', 'eccentric', 'witch', 'forest', 'witch', 'wish', 'unexpected', 'cost', 'Merida', 'must', 'take', 'responsibility', 'act', 'quickly', 'save', 'mother', 'kingdom', 'consequences', 'spell.This', 'film', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Pixar', 'apparently', 'had', 'rewrite', 'graphics', 'software', 'movie', 'graphics', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Scottish', 'highlands', 'serve', 'magnificent', 'backdrop', 'story', 'creating', 'world', 'almost', 'real', 'Hair', 'fur', 'are', 'well-rendered', 'well', 'Merida', 'hair', 'particular', 'wild', 'tangle', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'nightmare', 'render', 'real', 'enough', 'touch.The', 'story', 'come', 'criticism', 'being', 'average', 'not', 'showcasing', 'Merida', 'talents', 'enough', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'fairy', 'tale', 'however', 'great', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'moral', 'story', 'timely', 'one', 'think', 'children', 'parents', 'should', 'learn', 'choices', 'have', 'consequences', 'must', 'take', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'better', 'worse.I', 'must', 'also', 'give', 'special', 'mention', 'sounds', 'movie', 'music', 'voice', 'cast', 'music', 'combination', 'traditional', 'orchestral', 'score', 'bagpipe', 'music', 'story', 'glove', 'additional', 'vocal', 'songs', 'woven', 'seamlessly', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'foreign', 'countries', 'have', 'jarrinly', 'American-sounding', 'voice', 'cast', 'refreshing', 'hear', 'authentic', 'British', 'Scottish', 'voices', 'film', 'voice', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life.I', 'personally', 'consider', 'one', 'Pixar', 'best', 'films', 'yet', 'one', 'best', 'Disney', 'fairy', 'tales', 'princess', 'stories', 'long', 'time', 'Merida', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'roster', 'could', 'probably', 'run', 'circles', 'Snow', 'White', 'Cinderella', 'think', ""'d"", 'get', 'along', 'well', 'Mulan', 'Best', 'suited', 'children', '8', 'up', 'due', 'scary', 'moments']",N/A
1477744,A2EP52TE6GH8OB,B005LAIHZY,Kevin Millward,"[0, 2]","This film was generally well-received by critics and audiences alike, so I went in expecting what most Disney films deliver: family-friendly content that normally doesn't require any serious emotional or intellectual investment.  I actually laughed out loud at a few parts, which surprised me.  When I saw the trailer, I thought the humor was going to be obnoxious crap in a desperate attempt to appeal to the younger audience, but I was pleased with the way it was done.The storyline is a bit strange.  Because the main character, Merida, wants to be free, she has a witch perform a spell to ""change"" her mother.  This ""change"" involved her turning into a horse.  The rest of the film consists of Merida trying to break the spell and bring her mother back into human form.  Okay, I can try to accept the odd storyline.  It is a kid's movie, after all.  But here's where I have a problem: The witch tells Merida to remember a phrase.  I don't remember it because everyone in the film has Scottish accents, so it was hard enough trying to comprehend what they were saying.  This phrase is supposed to be so important that the witch repeats it.  After this, we never hear the phrase again.  What was the point of spending that much screen time on something that won't be brought up again?  More organization in the script could've made this a better film.There was one thing I really liked about this film: the climax.  There is an awesome scene where we get to see two bears fight.  For a Disney film, it was actually really intense, which is an unusual but welcome feeling to experience in a film of this caliber.  This film was also funny, specifically when Merida is trying to sneak her bear mother past a group of townspeople.  Also, who doesn't enjoy seeing a bear dive down a big-breasted woman's blouse to get a key?  I give two thumbs up for the comedy in this film; the timing was spot-on and targeted several different age groups.To wrap things up, Brave is a colorful and funny film that lacks a solid script.  I really want to check out more Disney films in the future so I can keep in check my thoughts about the studio.  Disney usually does a good job of making great family films, but not always.  I liked Brave and I like the direction Disney is heading in.  If they continue to make films as enjoyable as this one, you can expect more Disney reviews from me.",4,Can't wait to see what Disney puts out next!,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,2374,"['film', 'was', 'generally', 'well-received', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike', 'went', 'expecting', 'what', 'most', 'Disney', 'films', 'deliver', 'family-friendly', 'content', 'normally', ""n't"", 'require', 'serious', 'emotional', 'intellectual', 'investment', 'actually', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'few', 'parts', 'surprised', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'thought', 'humor', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'obnoxious', 'crap', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audience', 'was', 'pleased', 'way', 'was', 'done.The', 'storyline', 'bit', 'strange', 'main', 'character', 'Merida', 'be', 'free', 'witch', 'perform', 'spell', 'change', 'mother', 'change', 'involved', 'turning', 'horse', 'rest', 'film', 'Merida', 'trying', 'break', 'spell', 'bring', 'mother', 'back', 'human', 'form', 'Okay', 'can', 'try', 'accept', 'odd', 'storyline', 'kid', 'movie', 'here', 'where', 'have', 'problem', 'witch', 'Merida', 'remember', 'phrase', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'everyone', 'film', 'Scottish', 'accents', 'was', 'hard', 'enough', 'trying', 'comprehend', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'phrase', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'important', 'witch', 'never', 'hear', 'phrase', 'again', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'spending', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'again', 'More', 'organization', 'script', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'better', 'film.There', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'climax', 'awesome', 'scene', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'two', 'bears', 'fight', 'Disney', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'intense', 'unusual', 'welcome', 'feeling', 'experience', 'film', 'caliber', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'funny', 'specifically', 'when', 'Merida', 'trying', 'sneak', 'bear', 'mother', 'group', 'townspeople', 'Also', 'who', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'bear', 'dive', 'down', 'big-breasted', 'woman', 'blouse', 'get', 'key', 'give', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'comedy', 'film', 'timing', 'was', 'spot-on', 'targeted', 'several', 'different', 'age', 'groups.To', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'Brave', 'colorful', 'funny', 'film', 'solid', 'script', 'really', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'more', 'Disney', 'films', 'future', 'can', 'keep', 'check', 'thoughts', 'studio', 'Disney', 'usually', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'great', 'family', 'films', 'not', 'always', 'liked', 'Brave', 'like', 'direction', 'Disney', 'heading', 'continue', 'make', 'films', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'can', 'expect', 'more', 'Disney', 'reviews']",N/A

We made an unfortunate mistake to choose the 3D screening.The movie is violence-packed. Very scary to kids and parents alike. Parents beating themselves on the headwhat they brought the kids to, kids struggle with each violent scary scene and trying to show the nextone that they can make it through. We had to delegate one parent who finally left the theather with three ofour youngest ones 2, 4.5 and 5 as they were watching in horror and had no intention to hide it.At the end of the movie there were plenty of seats left - mind that the movie started with full theather.I don't recall any quite as violent kids movie that would be rated PG in long while.

The traile is not doing the justice.The trailer makes you believe you are going to see a gentle fun movie with some elements ofadult humor. The reality is very different.

Where most princesses sit around gazing moonily at a bird and hoping for a prince to rescue them, Merida picks up her own sword, takes charge of her own life, and at the end of the film, is still proudly carving her own path - putting off thoughts of marriage until later.It is quite clear from the very beginning that the team at Pixar knew what they were doing in the archery and sword-fighting scenes. I've taken medieval swordfighting classes for several years and have spent far more years attending reenactments and watching swordplay. The movements in Brave are nearly perfect; in many cases they were exactly what I was taught to do. I remember thinking, in a pivotal scene where Merida holds off an assailant with her sword, ""hey, I know that pose!""In the commentary we learn that the team did know how to sword-fight and mapped out all the combat sequences in real life before transferring them to the screen. So these aren't just fantasy versions of sword fights. They are realistic, authentic looks as to how these swords were handled.The same is true for the archery. They show the details about how the arrow bends as it flies, the way the bow is held, and so on.It's true that Merida's mom is not thrilled about Merida's sword-and-bow interests, but that conflict between mother and daughter is the whole heart of the film. Merida's mom has one, specific track in mind her for daughter - become part of a clan merger. And, to be fair, this was often the way marriage was in medieval times. Nobles had to ensure their land was protected and their borders secure. It was a quite practical situation. So the mother's stance is understandable. So is the daughter's.I give the story great praise. Sure, it's a bit predictable. We could almost recite some of the lines along with the characters, knowing what they were likely to say. Still, the underlying message is wonderful and miles apart from the 1937 Snow White. Snow White sat around waiting for her prince to come, with no thought of doing anything for herself. Merida has plenty she wants to do with her life, and has little interest in a prince coming to take control.Well recommended.",5,"Great Message, a Wealth of Historical Accuracy",1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,2266,"['Pixar', '2012', 'animated', 'feature', 'Brave', 'apart', 'wealth', 'princess-based', 'movies', 'came', 'Where', 'most', 'princesses', 'sit', 'gazing', 'moonily', 'bird', 'hoping', 'prince', 'rescue', 'Merida', 'up', 'own', 'sword', 'charge', 'own', 'life', 'end', 'film', 'still', 'proudly', 'carving', 'own', 'path', 'putting', 'off', 'thoughts', 'marriage', 'later.It', 'quite', 'clear', 'very', 'beginning', 'team', 'Pixar', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'archery', 'sword-fighting', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'medieval', 'swordfighting', 'classes', 'several', 'years', 'have', 'spent', 'far', 'more', 'years', 'attending', 'reenactments', 'watching', 'swordplay', 'movements', 'Brave', 'are', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'many', 'cases', 'were', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'taught', 'do', 'remember', 'thinking', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'where', 'Merida', 'assailant', 'sword', 'hey', 'know', 'pose', 'commentary', 'learn', 'team', 'did', 'know', 'how', 'sword-fight', 'mapped', 'out', 'combat', 'sequences', 'real', 'life', 'transferring', 'screen', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'fantasy', 'versions', 'sword', 'fights', 'are', 'realistic', 'authentic', 'looks', 'how', 'swords', 'were', 'handled.The', 'same', 'true', 'archery', 'show', 'details', 'how', 'arrow', 'bends', 'way', 'bow', 'held', 'so', 'on.It', 'true', 'Merida', 'mom', 'not', 'thrilled', 'Merida', 'sword-and-bow', 'interests', 'conflict', 'mother', 'daughter', 'whole', 'heart', 'film', 'Merida', 'mom', 'one', 'specific', 'track', 'mind', 'daughter', 'become', 'part', 'clan', 'merger', 'be', 'fair', 'was', 'often', 'way', 'marriage', 'was', 'medieval', 'times', 'Nobles', 'had', 'ensure', 'land', 'was', 'protected', 'borders', 'secure', 'was', 'quite', 'practical', 'situation', 'mother', 'stance', 'understandable', ""daughter's.I"", 'give', 'story', 'great', 'praise', 'Sure', 'bit', 'predictable', 'could', 'almost', 'recite', 'lines', 'characters', 'knowing', 'what', 'were', 'likely', 'say', 'Still', 'underlying', 'message', 'wonderful', 'miles', 'apart', '1937', 'Snow', 'White', 'Snow', 'White', 'sat', 'around', 'waiting', 'prince', 'come', 'thought', 'doing', 'anything', 'herself', 'Merida', 'plenty', 'do', 'life', 'little', 'interest', 'prince', 'coming', 'take', 'control.Well', 'recommended']",N/A

1477821,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B005LAIHZY,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[15, 31]","MOVIE REVIEW #39: "" Brave ""I never thought I would ever write a review about a Pixar film like this one. It probably works better on the small screen (Blu Ray/DVD) but Disney's/Pixar release of director Brenda Chapman's (The Prince of Egypt) film Brave was a little more than disappointing.  I can see why this took 5 years to make and was pushed back with its release date two times.Beautifully looking and deeply rich in Celtic culture it really lacks the full spectrum of the movie by grabbing you in the beginning and holding you. It's a mother and daughter film definitely and the best scenes are really only with them together. It does have a lush score by Patrick Doyle (Hamlet, Thor) - but even that didn't carry the film for me. Again it was made for 3-D - which it didn't really need - I think the glasses took away from the detail and majesty of the colors, textures and all the scenery itself in the film. (Just another attempt to charge more ticket prices at the box office, in my opinion..)The story to me was a little simple and took a long while to get to the real `heart' of the film. It's about Merida, (Voiced by Kelly Macdonald of Boardwalk Empire and No Country For Old Men) who is a skilled archer and impetuous daughter of King Fergus (Voiced by Billy Connolly of The Last Samurai and Lemony Snickets) and - the one she conflicts with most, her mother Queen Elinor (Voiced by Emma Thompson of Nanny McPhee and Love Actually).Determined to carve her own path in life, Merida defies an age-old custom sacred to the uproarious lords of the land - Betrothal: with - the overly massive Lord MacGuffin (Voiced by Kevin Mckidd of Trainspotting and Kingdom of Heaven), the hugely surly Lord Macintosh (Voiced by Craig Ferguson of How To Train Your Dragon and Winnie The Pooh)  and cantankerous Lord Dingwall (Voiced by Robbie Coltrane of Harry Potter and Goldeneye).Merida's actions inadvertently unleash chaos and fury in the kingdom, - as well as creating a huge riff in her relationship with her mother - and when she mistakenly turns to an eccentric old Witch for help, (Voiced by Julie Walters of Harry Potter and Mama Mia!), she is granted a strange wish to `change' her mother. A wish she later learns to regret and make the entire kingdom threaten her mother in a very mortal way. The ensuing peril forces Merida to harness all of her skills and resources -- including her clever and mischievous triplet brothers -- to undo a beastly curse before it's too late. She does this by learning how and summoning up her own Bravery!Those three brothers end up being a VERY minor comic relief for the film. They could have done so much more with them, but the few scenes they had were `slapsticky' and quick with wit and humor - but not much.Sounds great to hear story-wise- but to me the execution of the script was slow and the dialogue a little garbled due to the thick Celtic dialects overlapping a lot of the time. The screenplay written by Marc Andrews (John Carter) , Steve Purcell (Cars), Brenda Chapman (Cars, Beauty and the Beast) and Irene Mecci (Annie, Hercules) and need more heart and continuity to me.The best scenes were always between Merida and her mother. Whether happy, arguing or dealing with a `change' - they were spot on! An extremely tear jerking moment is when her mother, in another form, realizes what's important to both her and her daughter and has to communicate this `change' to her daughter in a most unconventional, funny and heartfelt way!Definitely a good film for the younger audiences and a family film - but  I definitely got the reaction/impression that it is geared more toward the female crowd (with a little action and a little violence thrown in for the men) and as such suffered the continuity and balance for a general audience. I think it was trying to be the female version of Finding Nemo. But it won't hold a candle to that classic Pixar film!I wanted to enjoy it more....but it didn't have the Pixar heart I am so used and was excited and hoping to see again in a Pixar film. I am sure when I get the Bu Ray/DVD - it will work better. Some films work better on the small screen - this one needed a lot of help on the big one for me.",3,Brave Was A Little Short on Heart For a Pixar Film For Me!,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,4198,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', '39', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'ever', 'write', 'review', 'Pixar', 'film', 'one', 'probably', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'Blu', 'Ray/DVD', ""Disney's/Pixar"", 'release', 'director', 'Brenda', 'Chapman', 'Prince', 'Egypt', 'film', 'Brave', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'disappointing', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'took', '5', 'years', 'make', 'was', 'pushed', 'back', 'release', 'date', 'two', 'times.Beautifully', 'looking', 'deeply', 'rich', 'Celtic', 'culture', 'really', 'full', 'spectrum', 'movie', 'grabbing', 'beginning', 'holding', 'mother', 'daughter', 'film', 'definitely', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'together', 'have', 'lush', 'score', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'Hamlet', 'Thor', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'film', 'Again', 'was', 'made', '3-D', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'think', 'glasses', 'took', 'away', 'detail', 'majesty', 'colors', 'textures', 'scenery', 'film', 'Just', 'attempt', 'charge', 'more', 'ticket', 'prices', 'box', 'office', 'opinion..', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'simple', 'took', 'long', 'while', 'get', 'real', 'heart', 'film', 'Merida', 'Voiced', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'who', 'skilled', 'archer', 'impetuous', 'daughter', 'King', 'Fergus', 'Voiced', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Lemony', 'Snickets', 'one', 'most', 'mother', 'Queen', 'Elinor', 'Voiced', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Nanny', 'McPhee', 'Love', 'Actually', '.Determined', 'carve', 'own', 'path', 'life', 'Merida', 'age-old', 'custom', 'sacred', 'uproarious', 'lords', 'land', 'Betrothal', 'overly', 'massive', 'Lord', 'MacGuffin', 'Voiced', 'Kevin', 'Mckidd', 'Trainspotting', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'hugely', 'surly', 'Lord', 'Macintosh', 'Voiced', 'Craig', 'Ferguson', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'cantankerous', 'Lord', 'Dingwall', 'Voiced', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Goldeneye', '.Merida', 'actions', 'inadvertently', 'unleash', 'chaos', 'fury', 'kingdom', 'as', 'well', 'creating', 'huge', 'riff', 'relationship', 'mother', 'when', 'mistakenly', 'eccentric', 'old', 'Witch', 'help', 'Voiced', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Mama', 'Mia', 'granted', 'strange', 'wish', 'change', 'mother', 'wish', 'later', 'regret', 'make', 'entire', 'kingdom', 'threaten', 'mother', 'very', 'mortal', 'way', 'ensuing', 'peril', 'forces', 'Merida', 'harness', 'skills', 'resources', 'including', 'clever', 'mischievous', 'triplet', 'brothers', 'undo', 'beastly', 'curse', 'too', 'late', 'learning', 'how', 'summoning', 'up', 'own', 'Bravery', 'three', 'brothers', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'VERY', 'minor', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'few', 'scenes', 'had', 'were', 'slapsticky', 'quick', 'wit', 'humor', 'not', 'great', 'hear', 'story-wise-', 'execution', 'script', 'was', 'slow', 'dialogue', 'little', 'garbled', 'due', 'thick', 'Celtic', 'dialects', 'overlapping', 'lot', 'time', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Marc', 'Andrews', 'John', 'Carter', 'Steve', 'Purcell', 'Cars', 'Brenda', 'Chapman', 'Cars', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Irene', 'Mecci', 'Annie', 'Hercules', 'need', 'more', 'heart', 'continuity', 'me.The', 'best', 'scenes', 'were', 'always', 'Merida', 'mother', 'Whether', 'happy', 'arguing', 'dealing', 'change', 'were', 'spot', 'extremely', 'tear', 'jerking', 'moment', 'when', 'mother', 'form', 'what', 'important', 'daughter', 'communicate', 'change', 'daughter', 'most', 'unconventional', 'funny', 'heartfelt', 'way', 'Definitely', 'good', 'film', 'younger', 'audiences', 'family', 'film', 'definitely', 'got', 'reaction/impression', 'geared', 'more', 'female', 'crowd', 'little', 'action', 'little', 'violence', 'thrown', 'men', 'such', 'suffered', 'continuity', 'balance', 'general', 'audience', 'think', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'female', 'version', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'classic', 'Pixar', 'film', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Pixar', 'heart', 'am', 'so', 'used', 'was', 'excited', 'hoping', 'see', 'again', 'Pixar', 'film', 'am', 'sure', 'when', 'get', 'Bu', 'Ray/DVD', 'will', 'work', 'better', 'films', 'work', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'one', 'needed', 'lot', 'help', 'big', 'one']",N/A

I thought it was a very good movie...it's not on the same level as the classics, but I really enjoyed the story alot more than Tangled. I couldn't stand Flynn Ryder or hearing his cheesy monologues... it made me gag. I would even say the characters, story, and the songs were far better than the ones in Tangled. I personally think that Brave should have gotten Tangled's hype. I think Merida is a pretty underrated character/princess. I like how the movie teaches how one's own selfishness can lead to regrettable consequences. It's a story that follows Merida putting a spell on her mother to turn her into a bear just so she could find her way out of being in a an arranged marriage. In the end, Merida realizes how much her mother really loves and cares for her. Her mother even risked her own life to fight off the Mordu bear. She almost lost her mother because she just wanted to escape from being in an arranged marriage and find her own destiny. I could never do a thing like that to cause any bodily harm to my own mother..no matter how many arguments or differences we may have. I have to admit that I really cringe when Merida tries to poison her own mother by giving her a blueberry tart. That was just pure evil and sick. In a way, Merida reminds me of Mulan. Wanting do what the big boys do, defies her elder's wishes, and have things her own way. I really love how the story focuses more on the mother/daughter relationship.

1477836,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B005LAIHZY,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","After the ""Cars 2"" half-fiasco I feared the worse for ""Brave"" - but I was VERY pleasantly surprised! This is again Pixar as we love it - a film with a good scenario, excellent dialogues, wit and humour galore, likeable heroes, stunningly good music and breathtaking perfection of animation!After reading the first reviews by so-caled ""professional"" reviewers in newspapers, I was a little bit concerned that it would be a kind of feminist, radically rebellious politically correct thing, but my apprehension was completely unfounded.The one thing that can be called ""feminist"" about this film is that during the final fight the main villain defeats easily all the men before being bested by - well, not a man and not a male... This ""feminist"" thing is however somehow weakened by the fact that no man could ever boast being eight feet tall and weighing around 800 pounds, most of which muscles... To fully understand this point you will have however to watch the film to the end...Far from being a manifesto of rebellion or feminism, ""Brave"" is in fact the story of a very traditional loving and caring family, confronted to the universal challenge of perfectly natural adolescent rebellion against the parents and established authorities - but it is also the story which once again shows that true love conquers all and that there is no ""good guys"" and ""villains"" in this eternal and omnipresent clash of wills. In fact (with the sad exception of deeply pathological families) in this time of life both parents and teenagers are a little bit wrong and a little bit right. ""Brave"" shows that the key to the satisfying solution in this particular stage of family life is first to avoid the escalation of the conflict beyond reasonable boundaries... which is something Princess Merida, the main hero in ""Brave"" will learn in the hardest possible way... Because the great idea of the scenarists of this film was to make the rebellious teenager the main culprit for all things that go wrong somewhere in the middle of the story...In fact one could call this film very conservative in its message, because it says to the young ones: ""Do not go too far in your rebellion, because not only you will be very sorry for it, but it is even possible that the damage can not be entirely repaired""... The parents on another hand also get a warning: ""Cut your growing children at least some slack, because if you push them too hard, they will break under pressure - and the damage can be beyond any possibility of repairing"". And for both sides the message is: ""Family is archi-precious - therefore, even if you fight, stay always conscious that some holds are barred - and know that small concessions can avoid HUGE disasters"". And finally there is a very discreet but strong warning against the deadliest sin in Christian teachings, Devil's great all time favorite, the greatest destroyer of men and women - pride!This powerful message is served to us in a very skillful, absolutely not preaching way, by being wrapped in an excellent story (some limited SPOILERS ahead). Let it be known then that ""Brave"" occurs in Medieval Scotland. The civilization of the Kingdom in which everything happens seems to be roughly that of 800 AD, as the technology seems to come from last moments of Iron Age and also the Vinkings are mentioned, but some elements are missing (there is not Christian symbols or priests) and there is one strong anachronism (a mention of fights with Romans). But all of this is not really so important for the story and if this kind of things offend you, it is advised to simply consider the Kingdom from ""Brave"" to be a Far Far Away Land from Times Long Since Passed...The Kingdom is ruled by the mighty King Fergus, who was gifted with the volume, build and all the beauty of a Panzer division which saw a lot of action, but who is overwise a very endearing fellow, with a heart as large as his chest. He sincerely loves his wife, his children, his kinsmen and his country and he is a fair and merry ruler, who enjoys without limits the good things of life: good food, strong liquor, loud songs, cheerful dances (with a lot of axe throwing), long difficult hunts and last but not least friendly brutal savage bloody fist/teeth/club/stool/table/mug/bottle/mutton leg/tree trunk/etc. fights, possibly with no less than one hundred participants...)))His wife, Queen Elinor, is a very beautiful, very intelligent and very brave woman, a loving mother of four children, a competent manager of the castle and other estates and also a very respected power figure, restless in her work to assist her husband in his royal duties. She seems to love a lot her oversized, loud and ugly as deadly sin husband (it is however hinted that she initially was not at all happy about her parents choice of future husband - for her, marriage came before love) even if he exasperates her frequently, as she is a sophisticated and learned lady, whereas he would not recognize sophistication even if it sat on his nose and started to dance the strathpeys. Last but not least, Queen Elinor has an iron will - once she wants someting, she will get it, come hell, high water or both!The first born of the royal couple is a very beautiful redhead, Merida. Since her earliest childhood she was a tomboy, happiest when riding the horse, shooting the bow, climbing cliffs, eating fish she captured in mountain streams and drinking with her bare hands cold water from forbidden springs. Merida grows to be a fair young maiden, but she is unable to live up to her mother's expectations. She simply was not meant to be a lady - she is much more like her loud, naturaly happy, extravertic, simple pleasures loving father. She however shares one trait with her formidable Mum - she is completely, totally, irrevocably pigheaded!The dramatis personae would not be complete without Merida's three baby brothers, Harris, Hubert and Hamish. They are natural triplets and they seem to be around 5 years old. Now, if the marriage of King Fergus and Queen Elinor seems to be a match made in heaven, those last three offsprings it produced were certainly conceived in part with Hell's help, because they are the most annoyingly mischievous and destructive little imps ever seen on the screen! They almost never speak but let their acts speak for themselves and they are heard really loud and clear by everybody in the castle and around! The dirty tricks they play to almost everybody (including the King - but NEVER the Queen!) can be really nasty... They also strongly believe in the principle ""No dessert left behind"" and they are so adept at stealing and pilfering sweeties, that it can be assumed that everybody else in the castle suffers from serious sugar deficiency...As you probably already saw in the trailers, the bears play an important role in this film and there is especially one, a really impressive and scary creature called Mor'du, which is crucially important for the whole plot. But there will be no more said here, to avoid spoilers. One WARNING however about Mor'du - this is a REALLY scary creature, and there are moments in which the skillful use of fog, shade and darkness (and of a chillingly creepy music) gives the viewers a good fright for their money! Therefore I would really AVOID showing this film to the youngest children, especially under the age of seven. This is a serious warning, as Mor'du is a really, REALLY frightening sight!There is (of course) also a witch in this film. I found her a very delightful presence, not scary at all - in fact, the witch is one of the strongest and best comic moments in the film. Do NOT miss the last joke, after the final credits - wait patiently (they are very long), and you will be rewarded with a very nice punch line!It is a good thing that Scots are people with lot of sense of humour, because in this film they are portrayed with a great love - but also with lots of jokes which take no prisoners! This film also DEFINITELY settles the eternal dispute about what it is that Scots really wear under their kilts!The ending is very clever and very touching - and it shows also very nicely how sexy can be a single white streak in the otherwise raven-wing black chevelure...Finally, there are sound aspects. Scottish accent heard in this film is a real delight! Songs are very good and as of the music, it is a TREASURE! Wonderful bagpipes, carrying us to infinity - and beyond!CONCLUSION: Pixar is back, with all its men, horses, artillery and train (and bagpipers!). This is an excellent kidult (kid/adult) film, to see, see again, buy on DVD, view regularly in family and keep for your grandchildren! I LOVED it and I am certain you will enjoy it too!",5,Pixar finds its bearings and is back in the game - and in great shape too!,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,8691,"['Cars', '2', 'half-fiasco',

That's probably because she's turning 16 in March, and she's right on the cusp of outgrowing the appeal of most Disney heroine films (I remember her wanting to see this movie when it was released in theaters in June, 2012, but she never did see it in the theater, and seemed none the worse for it.) In the world of the high school sophomore, last year's priorities can become this year's ""meh"" overnight!It turns out that the movie has a level of maturity to it that worked very well for my soon-to-be-sweet-sixteen daughter. From a parenting perspective, I had no problem with the few ""adult"" bits that were tossed in, as they were sufficiently humorous and sufficiently brief as to not be off-putting. This is pretty tame stuff by any measure.Overall, I enjoyed the film as well, though the story isn't very inventive as stories go. Within the first 15 minutes one can begin predicting what will occur later in the story line. I was happy to see that Disney avoided adding too many contemporary references or characters to the film (Merida's mom tells her to ""stop doodling"" in one scene), as such playing to the gallery can become dated in short order (think ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" or Robin Williams' Genie in ""Aladdin,"" whose ad naseum references to circa 1980s pop culture are lost on audiences 20 years later). I can see ""Brave"" becoming a family evergreen, watched each year around St Patrick's Day, along with ""Darby O'Gill & The Little People"" and ""The Quiet Man,"" even though ""Brave"" is set in Scotland, not Ireland.The animation is just spectacular - ""Brave"" just won the 2013 Oscar for animation, in fact. The only complaint I have is the complaint I have about most of Disney's recent animated films: things sometimes move too fast, no doubt a sop to pacing their films to a contemporary tempo that will compete with the explosion-laden video games that are so popular these days.Another Academy Award-winning film from Disney/Pixar, though not - I suspect - the kind of film that will garner the repeat viewings the more-traditional Disney fare seems to enjoy, let alone earning a place in posterity in the form of a theme ride at one of Disney's Amusement Parks.Four stars.",4,Enjoyable If Not Earth-Shattering,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,2304,"['daughter', 'received', 'UCE', '2012', 'Xmas', 'present', 'just', 'got', 'around', 'watching', 'last', 'weekend', 'probably', 'turning', '16', 'March', 'right', 'cusp', 'outgrowing', 'appeal', 'most', 'Disney', 'heroine', 'films', 'remember', 'wanting', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'June', '2012', 'never', 'did', 'see', 'theater', 'seemed', 'none', 'worse', 'world', 'high', 'school', 'sophomore', 'last', 'year', 'priorities', 'can', 'become', 'year', 'meh', 'overnight', 'out', 'movie', 'level', 'maturity', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'soon-to-be-sweet-sixteen', 'daughter', 'parenting', 'perspective', 'had', 'problem', 'few', 'adult', 'bits', 'were', 'tossed', 'were', 'sufficiently', 'humorous', 'sufficiently', 'brief', 'not', 'be', 'off-putting', 'pretty', 'tame', 'stuff', 'measure.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'inventive', 'stories', 'go', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'one', 'can', 'begin', 'predicting', 'what', 'will', 'occur', 'later', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'Disney', 'avoided', 'adding', 'too', 'many', 'contemporary', 'references', 'characters', 'film', 'Merida', 'mom', 'stop', 'doodling', 'one', 'scene', 'such', 'playing', 'gallery', 'can', 'become', 'dated', 'short', 'order', 'think', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Genie', 'Aladdin', 'ad', 'naseum', 'references', 'circa', '1980s', 'pop', 'culture', 'are', 'lost', 'audiences', '20', 'years', 'later', 'can', 'see', 'Brave', 'becoming', 'family', 'evergreen', 'watched', 'year', 'around', 'St', 'Patrick', 'Day', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'Little', 'People', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'even', 'Brave', 'set', 'Scotland', 'not', 'Ireland.The', 'animation', 'just', 'spectacular', 'Brave', 'just', 'won', '2013', 'Oscar', 'animation', 'fact', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'complaint', 'have', 'most', 'Disney', 'recent', 'animated', 'films', 'things', 'sometimes', 'move', 'too', 'fast', 'doubt', 'sop', 'pacing', 'films', 'contemporary', 'tempo', 'will', 'compete', 'explosion-laden', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'so', 'popular', 'days.Another', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'film', 'Disney/Pixar', 'not', 'suspect', 'kind', 'film', 'will', 'garner', 'repeat', 'more-traditional', 'Disney', 'fare', 'enjoy', 'let', 'alone', 'earning', 'place', 'posterity', 'form', 'theme', 'ride', 'one', 'Disney', 'Amusement', 'Parks.Four', 'stars']",N/A

Whittington,"[12, 16]","Brave the latest animated feature from Disney and Pixar, adds to the pantheon of Disney princesses in the form of a head strong, strong willed highland lassie named Merida, who has a big problem that is soon compounded by a bigger problem.Merida, who is all red hair and sharp mouth, is a royal princess whose parents want her to marry one of the sons of various highland clan leaders. The problem is that she would rather not. Instead she would rather gallop about on her huge horse shooting arrows at everything in sight.Her father, the King of Scotland, is indulgent while her mother, the Queen, is anxious that her little girl become a proper princess and learn how to submit to her duty. Merida, instead, makes an unwise bargain with a witch and then has a bigger problem on her hands concerning her mother.The animation, which shows an idealized Scottish highlands, is gorgeous enough to be breathtaking. The music, as is proper, is very generous with the bagpipes and often soars along with the landscape; if ""Touch the Sky"" does not win an Oscar for best song in a feature length film, there is no justice in the world and no taste in Hollywood.It is the fate of a lot of mothers and daughters to tussle when the later passes puberty. The story of ""Brave"" relates how Merida and her mother wage this battle and how they work through their issues while dealing with a potentially dangerous enchantment. There is also lessons about responsibility, getting what one wishes for, and listening once in a while to one's irritating teenagers.The voice talent is exemplary and actual Scottish actors are well represented, including Billy Connolly as King Fergus, Craig Ferguson, Kevin McKidd, and Robbie Coltrane as the lairds whose sons are vying for the hand of Merida, and Kelly McDonald as Merida herself.There are some scary, dark parts in the film, so parents should be cautious about bringing younger or more sensitive children to see it.

1477860,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAIHZY,Mark Turner,"[1, 5]","The fusion of animation between Disney and Pixar studios has resulted in some dynamite movies over the past few years. Many have become the classics of the future for children including movie series like CARS and TOY STORY. There hasn't been a single movie from the combined efforts of these two that has yielded a bad movie. This holds true for their latest release to DVD, BRAVE.BRAVE takes place in an unnamed country that more than likely is Scotland pre-Christianity days. These Celtic warriors talk tough and battle against the likes of bears when not fighting one another (something alluded to as the film progresses). In this world is a young princess named Merida, a free spirited young woman who loves to roam the countryside with her bow and arrows, riding her horse and climbing mountains. But that's not the thing that a princess should be doing as her mother reminds her of over and over.Her mother wants Merida to be a young lady of refinement, ready to take over the duties of a queen when the day comes. That day comes sooner than Merida would like when her mother and father inform her that the leaders of the other three clans are on their way bringing with them their first born sons, her eligible suitors. Ever the misunderstood teen in these sorts of films, Merida revolts against her parents and when a tournament is held to determine who will win her hand, it is Merida who wins the match and announces she is free to choose as she likes. This doesn't go well with the clans and arguing ensues.Back at the castle Merida and her mother have words that result in Merida slicing a tapestry of her family her mother made and running off to the woods. In the woods she comes across a Stonehenge type area where she spies a sprites (blue lit fairies of a sort) that guide her to a house in the woods where a witch lives. Talking about her desire to determine her own fate, she makes a bargain with the witch to help find a way to change her mother.Returning with a gift for her mother, a treat that contains the spell, her mother eats a portion of it only to become ill. Once in her room with Merida's help, her mother changes into a black bear. Not a good thing since Merida's father is known for being a bear killer. The two escape the castle and head back to find the witch's house in hopes of returning the queen back into herself.In order for this to happen, Merida and her mother must mend the tear in their relationship that has come about. Not only must they do this figuratively they must do so literally as well with the tapestry. Along the way they begin to understand one another clearer than they did in the past. But if they don't take care of this problem soon, the queen might stay this way forever.What we have here is a failure to communicate. Okay I had to say that. But the gist of the story lies in the inability between a teen and her parent to be able to come to a common ground. This, as well as several exposed bottoms on the warriors, makes the film more inclined to be one for teens as opposed to the younger crowd. That might not be easy since by that age they're past cartoons, computer animated or not.The movie is entertaining with some great music in it. The animation as always is breath taking to behold and you'll wonder just as I did how they are able to capture such detail in some areas like Merida's hair. The story is one that might even help a few teens and their parents come to terms with one another and communicate better than before seeing the film.My only problem was that this isn't the sort of film Disney was known for. In the past magic was on display in Disney films but was used as a plot device. The jaded apple, the pumpkin carriage and such. In this film the magic stems from Celtic symbols and revolves around magic. This might not mean much to some people but for me it gave the film a different feel than the normal Disney films I grew up with.Still, the movie does offer a nice piece of entertainment. It tells the story of a young girl looking to find her way in life and how she achieves that. For me, it won't go down as a classic Disney tale and my guess is it won't be remembered as well as most, but it's still a good movie.",3,A DIFFERENT DISNEY,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,4208,"['fusion', 'animation', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'studios', 'resulted', 'dynamite', 'movies', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Many', 'have', 'become', 'classics', 'future', 'children', 'including', 'movie', 'series', 'CARS', 'TOY', 'STORY', ""n't"", 'been', 'single', 'movie', 'combined', 'efforts', 'two', 'yielded', 'bad', 'movie', 'true', 'latest', 'release', 'DVD', 'BRAVE.BRAVE', 'place', 'unnamed', 'country', 'more', 'likely', 'Scotland', 'pre-Christianity', 'days', 'Celtic', 'warriors', 'talk', 'tough', 'battle', 'likes', 'bears', 'when', 'not', 'fighting', 'one', 'something', 'alluded', 'film', 'world', 'young', 'princess', 'named', 'Merida', 'free', 'spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'roam', 'countryside', 'bow', 'arrows', 'riding', 'horse', 'climbing', 'mountains', 'not', 'thing', 'princess', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'mother', 'over.Her', 'mother', 'Merida', 'be', 'young', 'lady', 'refinement', 'ready', 'take', 'over', 'duties', 'queen', 'when', 'day', 'day', 'sooner', 'Merida', 'would', 'like', 'when', 'mother', 'father', 'inform', 'leaders', 'other', 'three', 'clans', 'are', 'way', 'bringing', 'first', 'born', 'sons', 'eligible', 'suitors', 'Ever', 'misunderstood', 'teen', 'sorts', 'films', 'Merida', 'revolts', 'parents', 'when', 'tournament', 'held', 'determine', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'hand', 'Merida', 'who', 'match', 'announces', 'free', 'choose', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'clans', 'arguing', 'ensues.Back', 'castle', 'Merida', 'mother', 'have', 'words', 'result', 'Merida', 'slicing', 'tapestry', 'family', 'mother', 'made', 'running', 'off', 'woods', 'woods', 'Stonehenge', 'type', 'area', 'where', 'sprites', 'blue', 'lit', 'fairies', 'sort', 'guide', 'house', 'woods', 'where', 'witch', 'Talking', 'desire', 'determine', 'own', 'fate', 'bargain', 'witch', 'help', 'find', 'way', 'change', 'mother.Returning', 'gift', 'mother', 'treat', 'spell', 'mother', 'portion', 'only', 'become', 'ill.', 'Once', 'room', 'Merida', 'help', 'mother', 'changes', 'black', 'bear', 'Not', 'good', 'thing', 'Merida', 'father', 'known', 'being', 'bear', 'killer', 'two', 'escape', 'castle', 'head', 'back', 'find', 'witch', 'house', 'hopes', 'returning', 'queen', 'back', 'herself.In', 'order', 'happen', 'Merida', 'mother', 'must', 'mend', 'tear', 'relationship', 'come', 'about', 'Not', 'only', 'must', 'do', 'figuratively', 'must', 'do', 'so', 'literally', 'as', 'well', 'tapestry', 'way', 'begin', 'understand', 'one', 'clearer', 'did', 'past', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'problem', 'soon', 'queen', 'might', 'stay', 'way', 'have', 'here', 'failure', 'communicate', 'Okay', 'had', 'say', 'gist', 'story', 'inability', 'teen', 'parent', 'be', 'able', 'come', 'common', 'ground', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'exposed', 'bottoms', 'warriors', 'film', 'more', 'inclined', 'be', 'one', 'teens', 'opposed', 'younger', 'crowd', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'age', ""'re"", 'past', 'cartoons', 'computer', 'animated', 'not.The', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'great', 'music', 'animation', 'always', 'breath', 'taking', 'behold', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'just', 'did', 'how', 'are', 'able', 'capture', 'such', 'detail', 'areas', 'Merida', 'hair', 'story', 'one', 'might', 'even', 'help', 'few', 'teens', 'parents', 'come', 'terms', 'one', 'communicate', 'better', 'seeing', 'film.My', 'only', 'problem', 'was', ""n't"", 'sort', 'film', 'Disney', 'was', 'known', 'past', 'magic', 'was', 'display', 'Disney', 'films', 'was', 'used', 'plot', 'device', 'jaded', 'apple', 'pumpkin', 'carriage', 'such', 'film', 'magic', 'Celtic', 'symbols', 'revolves', 'magic', 'might', 'not', 'mean', 'much', 'people', 'gave', 'film', 'different', 'feel', 'normal', 'Disney', 'films', 'grew', 'up', 'with.Still', 'movie', 'offer', 'nice', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'looking', 'find', 'way', 'life', 'how', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'as', 'classic', 'Disney', 'tale', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'remembered', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'still', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

I did find it perhaps predictable for Pixar.,.maybe could of been more inventive, but the theme of a strong princess who doesn't want the prince, and the focus of the mother daughter relationship was great!  I don't think Merida was portrayed as too bratty really..I mean, kids can be bratty and they do things without realizing the real consequences.  They can be short sited and only think of their wants and needs..I don't think that is bad to show as long as the resolution shows the growth of the character, and their realization to see beyond themselves and have compassion etc etc.  Merida does grow and so does her Mother for that matter.  They clearly love each other but their own preconceived notions and desires get in the way.  I have a very strong willed and feisty daughter and this movie touched me for sure.  It just reminds us that no matter what is going on in our relationship with our children, how furious we get, how furious they get, how many things that are done with haste..we still love each other fiercely and that is always there..sometimes things just get in the way and we must rise above and settle differences.

It pains me to say that this is the second movie they have put out in a row that left me feeling underwhelmed (Cars 2 was the first). It's not a bad movie by any means, let me get that out of the way. It's a mildly entertaining flick for kids, and it's almost a coming-of-age tale, mostly geared towards girls, which is fine, but it was not what I expected. I feel like I was watching a movie I've seen a hundred times, even though it was my first time watching it. The animation is spectacular, I'll give it that. The characters and story are largely forgettable. I can't even recall the main character's name. Or any of their names to be honest. Pixar can do better than this. I have my fingers crossed that Monsters Inc 2 will live up to the original. And to be fair, Cars 2 and Brave are the only 2 Pixar movies I found disappointing. The trouble is, I didn't expect big things from Cars 2. I expected big from Brave, and it did not deliver. Is it my fault for expecting too much then? Perhaps.

Of course, the tale is written for a 21st century audience because back in the day marrying into families was a way of survival and if you brooked tradition it could mean the death of many including your loved ones but Brave chooses to ignore that historical piece and instead turn this into a modern telling of following your bliss. It works well enough.Brave is very much of a tale of a daughter and mother mending ""the bond torn by pride"". In fact, that is arguably the ongoing thematic element of this film and it works on different levels that adults and children can comprehend.Notable voices by: Emma Thompson, Kevin McKidd, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kelly MacDonald and Bill Connolly.The budget for this film was $135M and it made over $535M at the Box Office.

And they have broken a bit of tradition when it comes to animated fairy tales aimed at children with ""Brave.""  And that's a good thing.Here we have a teen-age Merida (Kelly Macdonald), a Scottish princess who is more interested in archery than being married off by the King (Billy Connolly) and Queen (Emma Thompson).  When forced to choose between a trio of unworthy suitors, she rebels going deep into the forest where she meets a ""wise"" witch (Julie Walters).In one of the funnier scenes, Merida agrees to buy all of the old woman's artwork - she has a small business of mostly wood carvings - in exchange for a spell to be used on her mother to change her mind.  Unfortunately, Merida doesn't read the small print, so-to-speak and the spell turns mom into a bear, but still with human characteristics; at least until the spell becomes permanent.  This is the tension of the film.  Can Merida fix things so Queen Mum can be her old self?It is refreshing to see that the movie foregoes the traditional rescue by a handsome prince.  That film tradition coupled with a story line that eschews the tradition of the Kingdom is a nice turn.  While the film is well made and holds the audience attention, it lacks much of the humor that most of us grown-ups look for.  Recognizing this movie isn't aimed at me, it should be a worthwhile option for the youngsters.I watched this film at home on a 63"" Plasma HDTV and I must say, I was stunned by the beauty of the transfer.  As stated earlier Pixar never disappoints and the technical wizardry carries over to the home system.  As you would expect the resolution is 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Every color is represented and the blacks are black.  Small details like freckles, beard stubble and wrinkles are clear and sharp.  Remarkably good picture.  If anything the audio is even better.

1477936,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B005LAIHZY,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 3]","A girl with wild hair, being adventurous, defying custom and owning a bow; what's not to like about this story, right?  Well, that's what I thought going in.  I had heard quite a bit about this movie and decided I should probably watch it.  It was ok, but it certainly didn't make me use up that whole box of tissues like most Pixar movies do (the first five minutes of UP anyone?).Merida is a young princess growing up in the woodlands of Scotland.  Her mother tries to teach her to be the perfect lady, but Merida would rather be out with her horse Angus, shooting arrows at targets and having adventures in the woods.  When it comes time for three suitors to compete for her hand, Merida decides she'll have none of it and comes in contact with a witch who promises to help her change her mother so she won't have to go through with the marriage.  The problem is, it changes her mom a little too much, and into something that her dad is not very fond of.  And only Merida can fix the problem.Ok, this might be a spoiler of sorts, but I kind of think Merida is a bit of a sociopath.  Take the potion, her mother is doubled over in pain and instead of thinking that maybe she poisoned her and she should get help, Merida is more concerned on if her mother's changed her mind about the marriage.  Then later on she watches her mother eat a few berries and then only tells her about the fact that they are poison and giggles while she sputters them out.  To me that is just a bit crazy.  Sure Merida has some good aspects, she's disciplined in her practice of the bow and arrow, will try to save her mom, and gets along well with her brothers.  But my goodness she can be quite scary as well.  Her mother I thought was very sweet in contrast.  Sure she doesn't want to listen to Merida's wishes, but really for that time in history she was doing what she was supposed to.  And Merida's dad was just comic relief sadly and not a figure you could learn from in this story; her brothers were the same type of characters.  I just couldn't really feel connected to any of the characters though.Voice Cast:Kelly Macdonald: MeridaEmma Thompson: Queen ElinorBilly Connolly: King FergusJulie Walters: WitchRobbie Coltrane: Lord DingwallKevin McKidd: Lord MacGuffin and sonCraig Ferguson: Lord MacintoshI think all of the voice cast did a good job.  The Scottish accent was certainly there and Macdonald had enough spunk for Merida.  Thompson as Elinor was calming although she could raise her voice if need be.  All the guys were the bumbling sort that the movie cast them as.The plot certainly wasn't what I expected it to be.  From the previews I thought Merida would be going on adventures and saving her country or something.  That was not the case.  She was just saving her mother from a mess that she had made and learning a little life lesson about not trying to change your own fate for selfish reason.  The problem is that the storyline was a bit convoluted and since this is a kid's movie, I'm not sure that younger or more immature kids could actually get any sort of lesson out of the movie.  There were some tender moments between Merida and her mom, and those were nicely done, but they were still offset by the times that Merida was a bit socio-pathic.  And quite frankly, the pace was so fast that it was a whirlwind trying to make anything of the life lessons the movie was teaching at times.  I wanted to like it, I really did, but while being a cute story about a mother-daughter relationship, it didn't use Merida to her full potential or keep my interest.  It should also be noted, that since this is a kid's movie, that there is some violence, especially towards a very scary bear.  It could be frightening for some.What was good was the animation.  I always like Pixar and its films and this was no different.  Fantastic use of color, especially in Merida's hair, and even without watching it in 3D it was still wonderfully involving.  I especially liked the way they portrayed the Willow the Wisps.  The music too was very nice and I liked the Scottish theme it had.  They even had Bagpipes.  And ""Touch the Sky"" had that right element of adventure and bravery to its lyrics.An ok movie, it had the wonder of Pixar's animation and great music, but just a lackluster plot and characters that would merely rate average.  It won't stop me from watching Pixar, but I may have to go re-watch Up to regain my love of Pixar.Review by M.

1477939,AMX4202M7D7HV,B005LAIHZY,"M. Secaur ""Meredith Secaur""","[379, 451]","Pixar Animation Studios has always been known for their unique approach to filmmaking. They have always put the story first and foremost, something that so many other studios seem to take for granted. They also know the rest of the ingredients to add to make their films stand out from the rest: Great characters, lots of heart, and a goodly quantity of humor.While not continuing the 21st century tradition of turning the fairy-tale on its head, as in the case of ""Shrek"", ""Brave"", feels like a rediscovered story by Grimm's with an unmistakably Pixarian flavor. Legends and myths abound in Scots folklore, and the writers at Pixar didn't have far to go in order to come up with their own story, one that is at once relevant, quite original, and yet entirely congruous with one's expectations of the perfect fairy-tale. As fresh and surprising as any of the studio's previous successes, I enjoyed it immensely, and could watch it many times over without growing tired of it. It's hard to find a real family film that everyone can enjoy together, but this one comes pretty to close to that ideal.In the ultimate cautionary tale of being careful what you wish for, the film, set in 10th century Scotland, concerns Princess Merida, a feisty, strong-willed, adventure-seeking lass, skilled with both a sword and a bow and arrow, who would rather practice archery and ride through the woods with her horse, Angus, than follow the path desired for her by her parents; or more specifically, her mother. Determined to avoid her fate, she runs away, and manages to find a way to alter her destiny. To make a long story short, this ill-chosen wish sets off a chain of events that threaten to destroy everything Merida holds dear and the entire kingdom of DunBroch along with it.This fresh take on a typical princess character pleasantly surprised me, as well as the fact that the emotional core of the film, as well as most of the plot, stems not from a romantic relationship between prince and princess, but from the mother/daughter relationship between Merida and Queen Elinor. Anyone who is a daughter like I am will easily relate to how complicated the bond can be between a mother and her child, and this film portrays that unique bond beautifully. Without giving too much away, it is their love for each other and their clashing of personalities that ultimately moves the entire film forward, and the changes they both experience throughout the course of the film give them both a better understanding of each other, and emphasize the importance of empathy, bravery, courage, family, and love.Not content with just being an entertaining theatrical experience, the film goes into a level of moral and emotional depth that even fans of Pixar may be unfamiliar with. It takes a very special film to bring me to tears, and I was moved quite often. Not to say that ""Brave"" is strictly a tear-jerker, because it is not. I'd estimate that there is more action, adventure, and humor than in any other Pixar movie to date.There is no doubt that ""Brave"" is one of Pixar's most beautifully animated films. The amount of detail is simply brilliant, and computer technology being what it is today, there are times when the visuals on screen almost rival the real world. I've never been to Scotland, but the richness and beauty of the country expressed in the film makes me feel as if I had. The landscapes are simply breathtaking, and so photo-realistic you might feel as if you've just fallen into the wilds of the Highlands; I'm sure that more than one viewing would be needed to absorb it all. The rendering on the hair and fabric is especially lifelike, and certain scenes involving non-human characters might make you do a double-take, they appear so true-to-life!Composer Patrick Doyle's score is appropriately Scottish in flavor, combining the expected Gaelic melodies (jigs, reels, and such like), with more modern, atmospheric, incidental scoring. Sprightly where it needs to be and brooding where it doesn't, it perfectly enhances the movie to the point that it feels as organic as the moss on the trees. The gentle lullaby, ""A Mhaighdean Bhan Uasal"", sung by Emma Thompson, is one of the stand-out pieces, and serves as the kind of musical representation of the love between Merida and Elinor. I also quite enjoyed ""Song of Mor'du"", a sort of Scotch drinking song, heard mainly in the background, but reiterated often throughout the rest of the score. There are also three other songs: ""Touch The Sky"" and ""Into The Open Air"", performed by Scots songstress Julie Fowlis, and ""Learn Me Right"", sung by Birdy, with Mumford and Sons, which, while not written by Doyle, fit expertly into their places in the story and aptly enhance the film.Now, a good animated character needs a good voice to bring them to life, and the entire cast is all very well-chosen and very well-acted. Comprised mainly of Scottish and English actors, including Billy Connolly as King Fergus, Emma Thompson as Queen Elinor, Robbie Coltrane as Lord Dingwall, Julie Walters as the Witch, and the incomparable Kelly Macdonald as Merida herself, it would be hard to find another group of people so perfect in their roles. Macdonald is wonderful as the flame-haired heroine, and Thompson simply shines as the equally obstinate but caring mother. Billy Connolly is a great counterpoint to her more level-headed and dutiful Queen, but gets far less screen time than either of the two female protagonists.To sum it all up, ""Brave"" is a beautiful, touching, exciting, and refreshingly original film, one that is entertaining on so many levels and can stand proudly alongside any of Pixar's previous masterpieces. I would rank it as one of my favorite (if not my favorite) Pixar film, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",5,Pixar's First Fairy-Tale Hits The Mark!,1340496000,"06 24,

The story is about a queen who is training her daughter into becoming a princess and according to tradition, a prince is selected to marry the princess upon proving himself through competitions.  The princess wants her own freedom to choose and fights with her mother on this.  She symbolically tears her mother out of the family by cutting a tapestry with the family in it and seeks a witch to help her mother change.  Her mother does change, but not her heart, rather she becomes a bear.  The story is a lesson of choosing freedom over tradition.  It is also about a love shared between family members that is unbreakable since Merida instantly regrets what she did to her mother and will go to any lengths to bring her back.

The 3 little redheaded boys are cute/fun little devils.I heard a few laughs from the parents and didn't hear anything from the kids that would indicate it was too scary for them, or boring - most seemed pretty glued to their seats.

Their animation captures the characters and their habits perfectly, and it couldn't be done any other way. They also continue their creativity, both in script and animation (which were yet again incredible), and had the audience laughing frequently!The characters were done very well. Merida, the princess, is a headstrong free spirit that wants to ""change her fate"" (of being betrothed against her will) at nearly any cost. Like her wild, flaming hair, she will not be held back. King Fergus is jovial and sympathetic, and yet a fiercely loyal husband. Queen Elinor is a lady proper, and wishes the same upon her daughter. The three sons, while never speaking, were portrayed fantastically. This shows the superior nature of Pixar: the ability to convey spectacularly through animated expression and posture.*SPOILER ALERT* Elinor, the prim mother, undergoes change herself. Facing the uncomfortable reality of becoming a beast, she must face her unruly side. As the credits begin to roll, one is left wondering: ""Which character am I to look up to?"" Merida is headstrong and sometimes disobedient. Fergus is understanding and supportive, but deaf to reason in a rage. Elinor is too strict. And what role does the witch play? Does she give Merida the spell in order to help her realize her mistake, or to cause more discord? She seemed regretful of giving the former prince the spell, in hiding her status as a witch, so it seems she has people's best interest in mind. *END SPOILER* Yet again, we find cauldrons producing what seems to result in good. Still, there is no character to completely imitate. This is one of Pixar's realistic conclusions, even if it isn't terribly original. There aren't any perfectly good people. (not even the heart-throb Young Macintosh) Everyone has a bad side to go along with their good, but each person is different. We can learn from each in a different manner.Once again, when the film ends, the audience is slightly confused by the ""moral."" ""You can change your fate"" is an odd choice for Pixar, and is a bit vague. It's not so much a moral as it is a challenge. Brave doesn't rely on other Pixar films for its reasoning or popularity. It sets itself apart, even in the purpose of the film. But is that a good thing? I don't think so, in this case. ""You can change your fate"" seems to encompass many ""morals,"" including ""do what your heart tells you,"" and as Jeremiah 17:9 says, ""The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?""On a lighter note, this film is perfectly suitable for kids. Because of the heavy reliance on expression, they will be able to understand more than in usual animated film dialogue. *SPOILER ALERT* The only possible inappropriate scenes are when Fergus and his fellow hunters have just descended a tower using a rope made of their shed kilts. The only other one is when the three brothers change back into boys, sans clothes of course. All of this is done in good-natured Scottish humor, and isn't much to worry about. *END SPOILER*In conclusion, the animation was superb, and the characters were fantastic. They are the reason I would go see this movie again, rather than the vague ""moral"" conclusion. You can learn a lot from them, but please don't ""follow your heart"" as a result of this movie.P.S.

1477975,AHF97M45JFCB,B005LAIHZY,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","To animated film students and CG geeks in general, the geniuses responsible for the Pixar classics we know and love have become something of celebrities themselves.  John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, these are the cornerstones of the Pixar ideology so when you encounter a feature film boasting the Pixar name; it seems odd when such names are absent.  Yet such is the case with Brave, Pixar's 2012 big budget action film that spent 6-years in development at a cost of $185-mil.Though it wasn't overly apparent at the time, looking back 2012's Brave finds itself smack dab in the middle of a Disney animated heroine resonance (2010 saw Rapunzel take center stage in Tangled and 2013's Frozen centers on Elsa, princess of Arendelle).  And, despite nearly a century's worth of Disney experience with leading ladies (think all the 2D princesses throughout the years), Brave actually represents Pixar's first attempt with the concept.  How did they do you ask? The answer depends heavily upon who you ask.Critics weren't overly generous with the film during its theatrical run, many going as far as to say that it continued in the lackluster tradition of the Pixar piece that preceded it: Cars 2.  It doesn't take much to realize that a lot of such criticism stems from the simple fact that Pixar has managed to raise the bar so ridiculously high in the 17-years' worth of releases separating the first Toy Story from Brave.  Were such criticisms justified with Brave?  Not entirely but let's first take a look at the plot summary.Set in 10th century Scotland, we follow along on the exploits of one princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald), a redhead tomboy whose regal lifestyle is forever jeopardized when she receives a bow as an early birthday gift.  With aspirations of becoming the best archer in the kingdom replacing those of becoming the best possible wife in a parentally arranged (and politically-driven) marriage, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) is forced to watch helplessly as her rebellious daughter mounts her steed and flees into the wilds.  Here the strangely underdeveloped will-o-the-wisps lead her to the cottage of a witch just itching to cast some spells.Of course if there's one thing we can take away from all Disney films it's that witches should definitely be one's last resort when it comes to the concept of problem-solving and Brave isn't about to break this tradition.  In fact, rather than grant Merida's wish with w a spell that could change her mother's mind about the whole marriage situation, the spell in question actually changes the queen into a bear!  Strange as this sounds, Merida's lovable but brain-cell limited father King Fergus (Billy Connolly) just so happens to have lost his leg in bear attack in the prologue; and hence is not the world's biggest fan of the creatures accordingly.The king (and much of the village) are bent on slaughtering the bear, unaware that it is in fact their wife and queen respectively.  What results from this point forth is a lot of slapstick as bear Elinor knocks haphazardly about in structures and rooms too small for her newfound girth and does her best to communicate while remorseful Merida endeavors to reverse the spell.If this all sounds rather un-Pixar-like; that's probably because it is.  In action the film definitely feels more like something we've come to expect from DreamWorks; which is to say entertaining, humorous, solid, and pretty.  However, until now, Pixar has separated itself from the competition with unrivaled cleverness.  It has been their concepts of observing and capturing the nuances of adult life and spinning them around a kid-friendly prose:  In short, something for all ages.  Brave however is a bit more forthright with its delivery and underlying message.  The humor beats certainly harken back to How to Train your Dragon with the brawling, uncouth behavior of the Scottish clans-folk (particularly the overly proportioned King Fergus, who is eerily reminiscent of Dragons' Stoic).The visuals however are stunning.  Just when you think computer generated imagery has reached its peak, Pixar goes and develops a brand new hair simulator program that required 1,500 individual curl strands to be strung through with a flexible core not unlike the string of a beaded necklace, that allows the scarlet coils to bounce and brush against one another without unwinding.  The misty and green Scottish landscapes are lush and unbelievably intricate with rendered textures and elemental effects that positively dazzle.  Factor in a Patrick Doyle score and Julie Fowlis' Gaelic soundtrack and the environment almost makes up for what the depth in story lack... almost.All in all Brave remains an entertaining 93-minutes with enough gusto to keep the little ones glued to the screen while adults marvel at the near-photorealistic textures laced throughout.  Had this one come from any of the other animation studios in the world, it most certainly would have earned unanimous praise.  Perhaps Pajib's Agent Bedhead said it best in his June 22, 2012 review of the film: ""Brave is a pretty good movie. In fact, for a Dreamworks or Sony movie, it's outstanding. However, relative to the Pixar brand, Brave is merely OK.""",4,"Perhaps Not Pixar's Finest, Bust Certainly not UnBEARable",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,5231,"['animated', 'film', 'students', 'CG',

1477978,A2GP36FGLXD9T2,B005LAIHZY,Oscar L. Colombo,"[0, 0]","This movie is entertaining enough, but the truly impressive thing for me is how the artists at Pixar have advanced the techniques for animating and texturing clothing, hair, skin and hide, muscles and inner body structures, so they all move together in a natural way that is a wonder to behold. There is a great amount of skill and hard work that has gone into making this possible, even with the help of great computer-aided animation software. This movie can be an important landmark in the evolution of animated films. Pixar has been producing landmark movies every two years or so, and one can be glad that, after becoming part of Disney, they retain and continue to sharpen their artistic and technical edge.Having seen now the movie twice, first in 3-D at a theater, and now on DVD in 2-D, my impression is that both versions are equally interesting and a pleasure to watch: those detailed backgrounds of leafy and mysterious forests and of the wonderful and craggy Highlands' landscapes are rendered with a poetic sensitivity that reminds me of Miyazaki's work.When it comes to the tale being told with such a display of technical prowess, while I can't find anything seriously wrong with it, it has left me wishing they can get Brad Byrd (Incredibles, Ratatouille) back on the director's chair once again, and soon. I miss those charming, offbeat, uniquely inventive stories.""Brave"", on the other hand, is a conventional fairy tale, with light and dark passages as it is traditional to have in such stories. I felt that the balance between light and dark was a bit off: too much slap-stick, perhaps. But that is a minor qualm, and most people who like animated movies will probably find this one is a good one to go and see, or buy.",4,"Entertaining, with superb animation: PIXAR's latest achivement.",1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,1740,"['movie', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'truly', 'impressive', 'thing', 'how', 'artists', 'Pixar', 'have', 'advanced', 'techniques', 'animating', 'texturing', 'clothing', 'hair', 'skin', 'hide', 'muscles', 'inner', 'body', 'structures', 'move', 'together', 'natural', 'way', 'wonder', 'behold', 'great', 'amount', 'skill', 'hard', 'work', 'gone', 'making', 'possible', 'even', 'help', 'great', 'computer-aided', 'animation', 'software', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'important', 'landmark', 'evolution', 'animated', 'films', 'Pixar', 'been', 'producing', 'landmark', 'movies', 'two', 'years', 'so', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'glad', 'becoming', 'part', 'Disney', 'retain', 'continue', 'sharpen', 'artistic', 'technical', 'edge.Having', 'seen', 'now', 'movie', 'twice', 'first', '3-D', 'theater', 'now', 'DVD', '2-D', 'impression', 'versions', 'are', 'equally', 'interesting', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'detailed', 'backgrounds', 'leafy', 'mysterious', 'forests', 'wonderful', 'craggy', 'Highlands', 'landscapes', 'are', 'rendered', 'poetic', 'sensitivity', 'Miyazaki', 'work.When', 'tale', 'being', 'told', 'display', 'technical', 'prowess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'left', 'wishing', 'can', 'get', 'Brad', 'Byrd', 'Incredibles', 'Ratatouille', 'back', 'director', 'chair', 'once', 'again', 'soon', 'miss', 'charming', 'offbeat', 'uniquely', 'inventive', 'stories', 'Brave', 'other', 'hand', 'conventional', 'fairy', 'tale', 'light', 'dark', 'passages', 'traditional', 'have', 'such', 'stories', 'felt', 'balance', 'light', 'dark', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'slap-stick', 'perhaps', 'minor', 'qualm', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'animated', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'one', 'good', 'one', 'go', 'see', 'buy']",N/A

Merida is born into the most privileged position in her society but rejects the accompanying obligations. Merida's mother clearly loves her but when Merida meets a strange witch she immediately purchases a spell that puts her mother's life in danger just to selfishly avoid her royal obligations. It is a mistake to judge the obligations of a historical social organization by what exists today. Other than skill at archery I saw nothing in Merida that was good. Merida's selfishness and lack of concern for society as a whole seem to epitomize what is wrong with people today. She is the bratty child of privilege like Paris Hilton. Did she do the right thing for her royal realm? No, she almost kills her mother to avoid doing the right thing. So if you want your children to disregard what is best for family and country and turn to witches and spells to break the rules this is the movie to teach that. How did this movie win an Oscar? I suspect many people who actually got to vote just read the positive press for the movie and never actually saw it.

Disney and Pixar has given us an unusual twist to the Princess, gruff King, loving queen mother story.The Princess is Merida  with the voice of the wonderful Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald. Merida is an a red haired Scottish tomboy whose life is changed by an early birthday gift of a bow, which quickly inspires her to become the best archer in the kingdom. Then we move to Merida as a young lady of marriageable age, who is angered by  a request from Queen Elinor voice-over by Emma Thompson, to choose among three possible husbands chosen by her clan. Merida wants none of them and escapes to the forest after winning the archery contest. One event after another occur and the queen becomes a bear after a magic spell is cast. The search for god and evil occurs, and in the process new love and devotion come to the fore. All is right with the world after battles and barriers are broken down.This is not one of the ground breaking Pixar films, but good enough.

1478037,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B005LAIHZY,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[14, 23]","So what is there to say that hasn't been said? All the reviews for this film have nearly universally claimed that the animation is fantastic, as one would expect, and it is indeed. The scenery is gorgeous, the 3D really helps the beautiful visuals pop and provides depth, the character designs are distinctive (if not slightly reminiscent of Dreamworks How to Train Your Dragon). Any animation fan will enjoy watching this film.As for the film overall, the story is charming, if not also quite familiar, and there is certainly enough humor and funny sounding pronunciations (the Scottish accents are purposefully hammed up at times) to keep children engaged. One caution up front, I would advise against taking toddlers, or extremely timid children, as there is a frightening bear, seen for a much more tame moment in the previews, who has several less tame scenes scattered throughout the film. Another caution for readers of the review, I am going to strongly hint at the major plot point of the film, I won't come right out and say it but I will say that by now most will have pieced it together from previews and other reviews, so this review shouldn't spoil anyone who hasn't figured it out already.All this said, I usually don't write reviews to simply regurgitate what has been said already, so I do have a point here I would like to make. The difference between this film and a true transcendent classic is that this film does nothing new or truly unique (well perhaps one thing, but we'll get to that). It is excellent to see a female heroine (especially one this strong) but the very notion of putting a female up front is something that has been done purposefully before, so even that cannot be said to make this film unique. I'm sure many, especially some mothers, will adore this film and they have every right to, it is charming in many respects. A great many more people will enjoy this film moderately and put it in their collection to rewatch, but this film will never be as great or as remembered as it could have been, and as an animation/Pixar fan that leaves me somewhat disappointed.The previews are deliberately vague regarding the actual story of this film. The opening is clear enough, a princess doesn't want to marry and butts heads with her mother so she goes in search of a spell to change her fate... it all seems familiar but is bold in its honesty and execution. However, from there I found the film became less Brave and more like what I will call Mama Bear, somewhat of a spinoff take on Disney's Brother Bear. The film runs with this new conceit, dropping what I deemed to be the more interesting story of the princess's efforts to win her own hand and convince her mother to change tradition, but never goes anywhere with it other than the usual predictable places. Predictability isn't a bad thing, it is often comforting and in many ways is even expected from any film, let alone a family film. But as a Disney Pixar film one would have thought they'd push the boundaries here or at least have the story be incredibly well told. Ultimately, the 'Mama Bear' idea just isn't mined to its full potential, though that doesn't stop it from being fun and having laughs.Overall the film, which admittedly had a troubled production, feels like a pastiche of earlier efforts by Disney and even some of their rival studios. There is even a random witch character thrown into the mix but then she disappears never to return or be mentioned again. A lot of elements in the film are that way, they appear, play their part in the plot and then disappear or vanish until they may or may not be needed again. There are few strong through lines. More evidence to this is that the only villain truly presented here seems to be stubbornness (and perhaps that scary bear who waltzes in and out of the plot with little purpose), which is again a potentially interesting angle but it doesn't fully develop and things are wrapped up too easily in that regard without any sacrifice and surprisingly little effort. The film also seems unable to decide whether it wants to be classic fairy tale (i.e. Disney's traditional formula) or take the true Pixar/Dreamworks route and have a modern take (i.e. Toy Story, Shrek, etc.), as such much of the film feels in a definite time and place but then certain scenes have modern references thrown in.Now back to finding praise for the film, the stubborn characters are the princess, and her mother the queen. Both want what they want and desire for the other to see their point of view (sound familiar to any parents of adolescents?). The story does do an excellent job of portraying the trials of a mother and daughter relationship, at least from my experiences as an observer. The teenage princess really goes for the throat and the mother truly loses her control in one crucial moment and it all feels heartwrenchingly true to life. The one original thing I praise about the film is that mother-daughter relationship, but ironically at the same time it feels too realistic and thus out of place in a movie that tones everything else down. Another positive note is that neither the mother nor the daughter ultimately gives into the other but instead a wonderful scene shows how both have come to understand the other and they find a common ground, which is much better than simply having a stubborn parent realize they were wrong (you know, little mermaid style).I do recommend this film to animation fans, children kindergarten and up, or even for mothers and their adolescent daughters. It is well made and extremely well animated but overall as a 23 year old male film fan who adores Pixar (and Disney even more so) I have to say this film reminded me of Disney's Brother Bear, which was unfortunately only moderately successful. While I personally love that film and feel it brings together so many themes so wonderfully (the Inuit culture, man vs. nature, family bonds, beautiful and unique settings) this film takes the conceit from that film and never plays it out as well as it could or with the originality one comes to expect from Pixar. Even a straight A student gets a B once and a while, I just wish this film had been as strong willed as its main character, picked one direction and been more... well, Brave.Still highly recommended, with less gags but definitely more depth than Madagascar 3, but far from a must see for the casual filmgoer.",4,"Disney Pixar's Mama Bear, whoops, I mean BRAVE",1340496000,"06 24,

She rebels by asking a witch to cast an evil spell on her mother, who then turns into a bear. If the spell isn't broken by the second sunrise, the mother stays a bear forever. Now doesn't that just scream Disney? Doesn't that sound like the premise for every other Disney movie you've ever seen? Of course it does. Brother Bear, for one, comes to mind.Brave's animation is flawless and spectacular. But that should come with every Pixar film, like a toy comes with a Happy Meal. Kudo's to Pixar for introducing a female protagonist. Merida really is lovely, she possesses a terrific voice (Kelly Macdonald) and her hair flows magnificently. The rest of the characters, unfortunately, are simply not interesting enough and are largely forgettable, especially Merida`s three younger brothers, who are used solely for comic relief and as a handy standby to keep the plot going.The dialogue is riddled with trite and clich&eacute;d family melodrama.  Merida and her mother's back and forth bickering bored me to tears. (Mother: ""You listen to me!"" Merida: ""This is so unfair! I'm not going to be like you!"" Mother: ""You're acting like a child!) And so it goes on ad infinitum. That is such lazy scriptwriting.  And what about the blue wisps? What are they? Where do they come from? They're an essential component to the story and yet, their origins are never explained.Pixar's comedy is always on the cutting edge. A laugh very minute. Sadly there are very few genuine belly laughs present here. It's mostly slapstick fare, particularly during the comedic action sequences. Of course, the story's ending is utterly predictable, like most Disney films.  Merida puts on her brave face - excuse the pun - and saves her mother who becomes human again. Still, the ending is sweet, poignant and heartfelt.Brave is by no means a bad film. But it won't be recognized as one of Pixar's best. In fact, a film such as ""How to train your Dragon"", a Dreamworks film, fares far better in comparison. For my money, Pixar should get Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) or Pete Docter  (Monster's Inc. and Up) back in the director's chair. I see Docter, who directed the first Monster's Inc. film is not even scheduled to direct the next Monster's Inc movie, Monsters University.

1478080,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B005LAIHZY,R. Sardrena,"[17, 47]","Arguably no institution has greater power to shape and mold public opinion than mass media organizations like Disney.  They claim to simply respond to public tastes, but they usually twist and turn those tastes to suit their own objectives.  Their influence is hard to see, since they start early, shaping our minds when we are yet youngsters.  Pixar's Brave is a case in point.Promoted as a hip, feminist fairy tale, Brave tells the story of Merida, a Scottish princess required to marry a prince from a rival clan in order to quell the potential for war.  Merida sports the most violently blow-dried mop of red hair since Nicole Kidman's Aussie youth.  The princes vying for Merida's hand - like all male characters in the film - are portrayed as oafish losers.  Merida seems justified when claiming the right as a first-born noble to ""champion herself.""  In Zena-like fashion, she is quite the waifish warrior, capable of outmatching the males at all martial arts.Most of the film deals with Merida's conflict with her mother; she defies the Queen's wishes to submit to an arranged marriage.  A magical spell causes Merida's mother to transform into a beast.  The girl must reconcile with her mother before the change becomes permanent.The subtext of the story involves how females suffer from the burdens of obligations they bear due to men.  Like many popular entertainments, Brave characterizes females as almost a separate species from males, possessing insight and sensitivity that the barely-sentient masculine sex lacks.  The last time we saw a wave of similarly-themed entertainment was during the feminist revolution of the early Seventies.  In both cases, the true conflict was not between the sexes but between employers and workers.  In the 2000's the public is saturated with stories about female empowerment, but really it is a justification for an employer's power to hire cheaper female workers, firing men en masse.  Brave is an attempt to reconcile children to this social norm, even before they develop the power to decide for themselves what those norms should be.  In the end, Brave is a sinister agent for a brave new world.",1,Brave is hard to bear,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,2149,"['Arguably', 'institution', 'greater', 'power', 'shape', 'mold', 'public', 'opinion', 'mass', 'media', 'organizations', 'Disney', 'claim', 'simply', 'respond', 'public', 'tastes', 'usually', 'twist', 'turn', 'tastes', 'suit', 'own', 'objectives', 'influence', 'hard', 'see', 'start', 'early', 'shaping', 'minds', 'when', 'are', 'yet', 'youngsters', 'Pixar', 'Brave', 'case', 'point.Promoted', 'hip', 'feminist', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Brave', 'story', 'Merida', 'Scottish', 'princess', 'required', 'marry', 'prince', 'rival', 'clan', 'order', 'quell', 'potential', 'war', 'Merida', 'sports', 'most', 'violently', 'blow-dried', 'mop', 'red', 'hair', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Aussie', 'youth', 'princes', 'vying', 'Merida', 'hand', 'male', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'portrayed', 'oafish', 'losers', 'Merida', 'justified', 'when', 'claiming', 'right', 'first-born', 'noble', 'champion', 'Zena-like', 'fashion', 'quite', 'waifish', 'warrior', 'capable', 'outmatching', 'males', 'martial', 'arts.Most', 'film', 'deals', 'Merida', 'conflict', 'mother', 'Queen', 'wishes', 'submit', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'magical', 'spell', 'Merida', 'mother', 'transform', 'beast', 'girl', 'must', 'reconcile', 'mother', 'change', 'permanent.The', 'subtext', 'story', 'how', 'females', 'suffer', 'burdens', 'obligations', 'bear', 'due', 'men', 'many', 'popular', 'entertainments', 'Brave', 'females', 'almost', 'separate', 'species', 'males', 'possessing', 'insight', 'sensitivity', 'barely-sentient', 'masculine', 'sex', 'lacks', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'wave', 'similarly-themed', 'entertainment', 'was', 'feminist', 'revolution', 'early', 'Seventies', 'cases', 'true', 'conflict', 'was', 'not', 'sexes', 'employers', 'workers', '2000', 'public', 'saturated', 'stories', 'female', 'empowerment', 'really', 'justification', 'employer', 'power', 'hire', 'cheaper', 'female', 'workers', 'firing', 'men', 'en', 'masse', 'Brave', 'attempt', 'reconcile', 'children', 'social', 'norm', 'even', 'develop', 'power', 'decide', 'what', 'norms', 'should', 'be', 'end', 'Brave', 'sinister', 'agent', 'brave', 'new', 'world']",N/A

But the problem with any work of art that's nearly but not quite perfect is that the imperfection stands in relief.There is a definite disconnection between the words mouthed by the human actors and the mouth movements of the animated figures. At times it's almost as if sound is not quite synchronized to picture, but with this Blu-Ray recording, the synchronization is of course exact. Or, it's as if (almost) the picture has been dubbed into a foreign language. This is especially true where the faces, like that of the heroine, are greatly simplified, rounded, smoothed and stylized. With grotesque faces, such as that of the witch, where extreme facial distortions are employed by the animators, the lip-syncing is perfectly convincing. A fuller range of facial muscles appear to be forming the words, and the result is presented as far more convincingly human.It's a small quibble indeed. I had not seen any animated film in years; they just never drew me in. They all were so childish, and none captured my attention.

Being a Scot living abroad it was also nice to hear a lot of Scottish accents together (even if some were a bit dubious) and even I laughed heartily at trying to understand the ""Aberdonian"" accent of Lord MacGuffin's son.  It also made me a little home sick to see the beautiful Scottish scenery reflected in this cartoon - there is nowhere in the world like it.My only concern about the movie itself would be that a lot of the humour felt very Scottish and I think it would be lost on your average American movie watcher.  The story was nothing special and there were several things that happened that were not explained.  Why a bear, for example?  Perhaps, I am just overthinking it a bit.I was also disappointed in the 3D effects.  While it gave the scenery some depth it felt as if the movie had just been an old movie made in normal 2D and then converted into 3D.

1478112,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B005LAIHZY,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[3, 5]","Since seeing the trailer a few months ago I've wanted to see Brave.  In fact, I wanted to see it before The Dark Knight and I am glad I did!There are other plot synopses around the `net, so these are just some of my impressions.  -Brave stars Merida, a royal tomboy who wants nothing more than to shoot her arrows and have a great time.  Her mother, the queen, wants her daughter to be proper and married, so as to carry on tradition.The mother/daughter dynamic is very strong in this tale.  Disney/Pixar break tradition a bit and have the princess as an independent girl in a land of tough Scottish brogue and Clan jealousies and pride.  Merida is proud too.  Perhaps too proud.  Her mother is proud as well and demands her girl to be traditional.The tension grows as Merida becomes a fierce teenager, not realizing she's also coming of age.  To change her mother, she follows the willow wisps and meets a woodcarver (actually a witch!) and does the whole spell/magic thing that only Disney can do.The film is darker than other Pixar films and has more of a Disney feel than did Cars or Up or Wall-E, all excellent films in their own right.Not to reveal too much, but Merida's mother has a major change in view which most of the movie revolves around.  The humor is pretty good, especially amongst the clans - the young men who vie for Merida's hand are less than amazing and she out-shoots them all in an archery contest.  Very funny.Animation:The animation has improved greatly from earlier Pixar.  The fiery red hair of the leading lady almost has a mind of its own.  The fierce bear fights, the frightened horse Angus and the Stonehenge-like Celtic legends and magic create an awesome tapestry.Bottom Line:Though tedious in length, the mother/daughter tensions, the magical elements and the message of making your own Fate, that destiny is inside you, was inspiring, funny and though missing adult-themed messages (as in Up or Wall-E) was fun to watch.  Mothers should bring their daughters (and vice versa) to see this film.Recommended.Voice cast* Kelly Macdonald as Princess Merida* Billy Connolly as King Fergus* Emma Thompson as Queen Elinor* Julie Walters as The Witch",4,Pleasant Mother/Daughter-Themed Fairytale!,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,2178,"['seeing', 'trailer', 'few', 'months', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'Brave', 'fact', 'wanted', 'see', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'are', 'other', 'plot', 'synopses', 'net', 'are', 'just', 'impressions', '-Brave', 'stars', 'Merida', 'royal', 'tomboy', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'shoot', 'arrows', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'mother', 'queen', 'daughter', 'be', 'proper', 'married', 'so', 'carry', 'tradition.The', 'mother/daughter', 'dynamic', 'very', 'strong', 'tale', 'Disney/Pixar', 'break', 'tradition', 'bit', 'have', 'princess', 'independent', 'girl', 'land', 'tough', 'Scottish', 'brogue', 'Clan', 'jealousies', 'pride', 'Merida', 'proud', 'too', 'Perhaps', 'too', 'proud', 'mother', 'proud', 'as', 'well', 'girl', 'be', 'traditional.The', 'tension', 'grows', 'Merida', 'fierce', 'teenager', 'not', 'realizing', 'also', 'coming', 'age', 'change', 'mother', 'willow', 'wisps', 'woodcarver', 'actually', 'witch', 'whole', 'spell/magic', 'thing', 'only', 'Disney', 'can', 'do.The', 'film', 'darker', 'other', 'Pixar', 'films', 'more', 'Disney', 'feel', 'did', 'Cars', 'Wall-E', 'excellent', 'films', 'own', 'right.Not', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'Merida', 'mother', 'major', 'change', 'view', 'most', 'movie', 'around', 'humor', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'clans', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'vie', 'Merida', 'hand', 'are', 'less', 'amazing', 'out-shoots', 'archery', 'contest', 'Very', 'funny.Animation', 'animation', 'improved', 'greatly', 'earlier', 'Pixar', 'fiery', 'red', 'hair', 'leading', 'lady', 'almost', 'mind', 'own', 'fierce', 'bear', 'fights', 'frightened', 'horse', 'Angus', 'Stonehenge-like', 'Celtic', 'legends', 'magic', 'create', 'awesome', 'tapestry.Bottom', 'Line', 'Though', 'tedious', 'length', 'mother/daughter', 'tensions', 'magical', 'elements', 'message', 'making', 'own', 'Fate', 'destiny', 'was', 'inspiring', 'funny', 'missing', 'adult-themed', 'messages', 'Up', 'Wall-E', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'Mothers', 'should', 'bring', 'daughters', 'vice', 'versa', 'see', 'film.Recommended.Voice', 'cast*', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'Princess', 'Merida*', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'King', 'Fergus*', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Queen', 'Elinor*', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Witch']",N/A

To me she seemed quite spoiled, she was given a lot of love and attention and seemed quite privileged. She accepts all but none of the responsibility.  When it comes to being responsible, she runs away, never owning up to her actions. She wasn't compassionate, she wasn't considerate of others, and aside from shooting a bow, she didn't have a lot of talent at much of anything. I didn't find her that brave. I think this could've been written differently, so the heroine's rebellion would seem a bit more justified, and less the actions a form of tantrum. Yes, I agree, being forced to marry someone against your will is a bad custom. But so is hereditary leadership, royalty, an privilege. I didn't notice that she was all that upset about her privileged life in the castle. In fact, her and her brothers seem to take advantage of their good fortune quite often, plaguing the servants, and wrecking the kitchen. To me, she seemed quite spoiled.

The visuals & computer graphics did not disappoint-- Walt Disney would be awestruck and ecstatic if he could see what the industry can do these days--No doubt. But I believe he would have had the writers work on the storyline a bit more before releasing this to the public.  It was a nice idea -- I'm sure that every mother & daughter would be able to recognize themselves in this tale of Merida and her queen mom-with-nagging-high-expectations.  And, yes, when rifts and disagreements occur as a result of youthful pride and stubborn ego a mother figure can become, at least in the eyes of her daughter, a scary giant bear--who can be threatening & monstrous towards her girl --as well as more protective of her baby than any other natural force in the living world--- I completely get the metaphor and it had so much potential to resonate more with people than it actually did.  But somehow, the metaphor in its beginning is strained and carries little momentum.  There seem to be few apparent parallels between the Queen and her enchanted persona.  Perhaps this could have been fixed by making her more ""bear-like"" before the transformation-but it would be difficult to do this and still have her be likable.  So as it stands for most of the film, there is very little to make us believe that the Queen is really inside of this bear-and it's somewhat horrifying to think that her husband is getting ready to slay his wife b/c of mistaken identity.  The story is redeemed in the one scene when Merida believes that she has failed to break the spell that holds her mother captive.  She waits for the bear to transform back to her mother -and she is crushed when it does not occur as she had hoped.  She is humbled and can only hopelessly cling to her mother's side -wishing her back to who she once was.  This scene was masterfully done and rightfully brings the audience to tears.  Almost as fulfilling as the classic scene from ""Dumbo"" where his mother reaches thru the bars of the carnival cage with her trunk to be with him as much as she is able to.  C'mon Disney-Pixar -- don't be distracted/overwhelmed by your own visuals-- make sure the story is refined and fleshed out as much as possible before takeoff.",3,Visually Stunning-- But Metaphor and Storyline Needed Work,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,2385,"['was', 'excited', 'movie', 'animation', 'seemed', 'brilliant', 'cutting-edge', 'Scottish', 'culture', 'very', 'colorful', 'interesting', 'so', 'bought', 'HD', '20', 'visuals', 'computer', 'graphics', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'would', 'be', 'awestruck', 'ecstatic', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'industry', 'can', 'do', 'days', 'doubt', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'writers', 'work', 'storyline', 'bit', 'more', 'releasing', 'public', 'was', 'nice', 'idea', ""'m"", 'sure', 'mother', 'daughter', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'tale', 'Merida', 'queen', 'mom-with-nagging-high-expectations', 'yes', 'when', 'rifts', 'disagreements', 'occur', 'result', 'youthful', 'pride', 'stubborn', 'ego', 'mother', 'figure', 'can', 'become', 'least', 'eyes', 'daughter', 'scary', 'giant', 'bear', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'threatening', 'monstrous', 'towards', 'girl', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'protective', 'baby', 'other', 'natural', 'force', 'living', 'world', 'completely', 'get', 'metaphor', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'resonate', 'more', 'people', 'actually', 'did', 'somehow', 'metaphor', 'beginning', 'strained', 'little', 'momentum', 'seem', 'be', 'few', 'apparent', 'parallels', 'Queen', 'enchanted', 'persona', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fixed', 'making', 'more', 'bear-like', 'transformation-but', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'do', 'still', 'have', 'be', 'likable', 'So', 'most', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'make', 'believe', 'Queen', 'really', 'inside', 'bear-and', 'somewhat', 'horrifying', 'think', 'husband', 'getting', 'ready', 'slay', 'wife', 'b/c', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'story', 'redeemed', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'Merida', 'failed', 'break', 'spell', 'mother', 'captive', 'bear', 'transform', 'back', 'mother', '-and', 'crushed', 'when', 'not', 'occur', 'had', 'hoped', 'humbled', 'can', 'only', 'hopelessly', 'cling', 'mother', 'side', '-wishing', 'back', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'scene', 'was', 'masterfully', 'done', 'rightfully', 'audience', 'tears', 'Almost', 'fulfilling', 'classic', 'scene', 'Dumbo', 'where', 'mother', 'bars', 'carnival', 'cage', 'trunk', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'able', ""C'mon"", 'Disney-Pixar', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'distracted/overwhelmed', 'own', 'visuals', 'make', 'sure', 'story', 'refined', 'fleshed', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'takeoff']",N/A

1478156,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B005LAIHZY,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[6, 7]","I'm a bit worried about Pixar of late... they seem to be having a hard time finding their way since UP, which was followed by the overestimated TOY STORY 3, and the ""let's never mention this again"" CARS 2 ... BRAVE seemed like a shot at returning to form with a new original story.And there is much to admire here.  The animation is, of course, outstanding - reportedly a new software upgrade was required for handling the heroine's fiery red hair, and it shows.  Pixar has yet to falter in the graphics department, and BRAVE is a stunning and beautiful film to behold!  The voice acting is typically top shelf as well, with the likes of Emma Thompson, Kelly McDonald, and Bill Connoly leading the cast.  And the underlying theme of learning how to swallow your pride and admit mistakes is a very good one to share with the youngsters.With a strong foundation such as this, it is a shame that the movie ends up feeling so ... bland.  The problem here is that there really isn't anything new to sink your teeth into.  Perhaps we hold Pixar to too high of a standard now after one major innovative story after another.  I have long bragged over Pixar's ability to avoid the commonalities of Disney and other animated features - but here things are about as rudimentary as they come.So how many over-worn story elements you can find here:We have a young princess (check) who has a problem with her parents authority (check) who decides to follow her own path (check) which leads her to making a deal with a witch (check) that ends up backfiring and hurting those she loves (check), requiring her to mature in order to solve the problem (check) - but in doing so, she still ultimately kind of gets what she originally wanted (check and check).Supposedly there was originally an intention to make this more of an adventure story of the ""good vs. evil"" kind, and you can see in the build up of the heroine how this might have been.  She is an expert archer in the medieval days of Scotland - a setting rife with possibilities for adventure.  But, midway through you can sense the script being wrested out of one pair of hands and into another as the story takes a right turn into fable territory... one wonders how this setup might have functioned as more of an adventure.But as I said, the theme overall is a good one, and the relationship that builds between Merida and her mother is a very touching and positive one.  There is certainly a strong pro-family message here, which is always nice.However, there are also the typical ongoing tropes that are, sadly, rampant in Disney's films of late - adult responsibility is not as important as personal freedom, men are immature idiots while woman must take up their slack, etc...And most annoying of all, nearly every shot of the movie has to have someone bumping into something, or being hit by something, or screaming, or falling, or laughing uproariously.  It's as if the filmmakers are afraid of losing the kids' interest for a split second, so they had to dress up every shot with some overly kinetic movement.  Add to this the over-animation of the characters.  Merida cannot simply bob her head as she utters a line - she has to sweep her hair up, or fall onto a bed and then roll off, or bulge her eyes, or something... these are the elements that are common among Disney films, but have not plagued the Pixar movies of the past.Overall, BRAVE is a passable piece of entertainment - but it quickly leaves you once you've walked away.  Enjoyable? Sure... but BEST ANIMATED FEATURE?  Hardly!  The handful of children I know of who have seen it have expressed no interest in seeing it again.  That's your target audience, Pixar - I hope you're paying attention!I'm  not excited about Pixar continuing this year with the ""franchise development"" mentality in delivering a MONSTERS, INC prequel ... I really want to see them getting back to groundbreaking and innovative storytelling - and keeping away from the commonalities of children's animation - here's hoping the best animation studio in the business will remember it's roots!!",3,"There is a very good story here, but unfortunately it is crushed under the weight of the most typical of Disney tropes.",1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,4080,"[""'m"", 'bit', 'worried', 'Pixar', 'late', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'way', 'UP', 'was', 'followed', 'overestimated', 'TOY', 'STORY', '3', 'let', 'never', 'mention', 'again', '2', 'BRAVE', 'seemed', 'shot', 'returning', 'form', 'new', 'original', 'story.And', 'much', 'admire', 'here', 'animation', 'course', 'outstanding', 'reportedly', 'new', 'software', 'upgrade', 'was', 'required', 'handling', 'heroine', 'fiery', 'red', 'hair', 'Pixar', 'yet', 'falter', 'graphics', 'department', 'BRAVE', 'stunning', 'beautiful', 'film', 'behold', 'voice', 'acting', 'typically', 'top', 'shelf', 'as', 'well', 'likes', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Kelly', 'McDonald', 'Bill', 'Connoly', 'leading', 'cast', 'underlying', 'theme', 'learning', 'how', 'swallow', 'pride', 'admit', 'mistakes', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'share', 'youngsters.With', 'strong', 'foundation', 'such', 'shame', 'movie', 'up', 'feeling', 'so', 'bland', 'problem', 'here', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'sink', 'teeth', 'Perhaps', 'hold', 'Pixar', 'too', 'high', 'standard', 'now', 'one', 'major', 'innovative', 'story', 'have', 'long', 'bragged', 'Pixar', 'ability', 'avoid', 'commonalities', 'Disney', 'other', 'animated', 'features', 'here', 'things', 'are', 'as', 'rudimentary', 'come.So', 'how', 'many', 'over-worn', 'story', 'elements', 'can', 'find', 'here', 'have', 'young', 'princess', 'check', 'who', 'problem', 'parents', 'authority', 'check', 'who', 'follow', 'own', 'path', 'check', 'making', 'deal', 'witch', 'check', 'up', 'backfiring', 'hurting', 'check', 'requiring', 'mature', 'order', 'solve', 'problem', 'check', 'doing', 'so', 'still', 'ultimately', 'kind', 'what', 'originally', 'wanted', 'check', 'check', '.Supposedly', 'was', 'originally', 'intention', 'make', 'more', 'adventure', 'story', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'kind', 'can', 'see', 'build', 'heroine', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'expert', 'archer', 'medieval', 'days', 'Scotland', 'setting', 'rife', 'possibilities', 'adventure', 'midway', 'can', 'sense', 'script', 'being', 'wrested', 'one', 'pair', 'hands', 'story', 'right', 'turn', 'fable', 'territory', 'one', 'how', 'setup', 'might', 'have', 'functioned', 'more', 'adventure.But', 'said', 'theme', 'overall', 'good', 'one', 'relationship', 'Merida', 'mother', 'very', 'touching', 'positive', 'one', 'certainly', 'strong', 'pro-family', 'message', 'here', 'always', 'nice.However', 'are', 'also', 'typical', 'ongoing', 'tropes', 'are', 'sadly', 'rampant', 'Disney', 'films', 'late', 'adult', 'responsibility', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'personal', 'freedom', 'men', 'are', 'immature', 'idiots', 'woman', 'must', 'take', 'up', 'slack', 'etc', 'most', 'annoying', 'nearly', 'shot', 'movie', 'have', 'someone', 'bumping', 'something', 'being', 'hit', 'something', 'screaming', 'falling', 'laughing', 'uproariously', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'afraid', 'losing', 'kids', 'interest', 'split', 'second', 'had', 'dress', 'up', 'shot', 'overly', 'kinetic', 'movement', 'Add', 'over-animation', 'characters', 'Merida', 'can', 'not', 'simply', 'bob', 'head', 'line', 'sweep', 'hair', 'up', 'fall', 'bed', 'then', 'roll', 'off', 'eyes', 'something', 'are', 'elements', 'are', 'common', 'Disney', 'films', 'have', 'not', 'plagued', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'past.Overall', 'BRAVE', 'passable', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'quickly', 'once', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'away', 'Enjoyable', 'Sure', 'BEST', 'ANIMATED', 'FEATURE', 'Hardly', 'handful', 'children', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'expressed', 'interest', 'seeing', 'again', 'target', 'audience', 'Pixar', 'hope', ""'re"", 'paying', 'attention', ""'m"", 'not', 'excited', 'Pixar', 'continuing', 'year', 'franchise', 'development', 'mentality', 'delivering', 'MONSTERS', 'INC', 'prequel', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'getting', 'back', 'groundbreaking', 'innovative', 'storytelling', 'keeping', 'away', 'commonalities', 'children', 'animation', 'here', 'hoping', 'best', 'animation', 'studio', 'business', 'will', 'remember', 'roots']",N/A
1478157,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B005LAIHZY,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 7]","Pixar has produced some of the best animated films ever made, and even the worst offerings are better than the work of most rival studios. However, after seeing trailers for Brave, I found myself wondering whether it would live up to my expectations. People running into walls or being hit in the groin are usually there to get a few cheap laughs and I expect more from a Pixar movie.I shouldn't have worried.Brave is aimed at a younger audience than Pixar's best work like Ratatouille and Up. Although it does contain deeper themes, such as conflict between mother and daughter, and dealing with society's expectations, the story is easy to follow. There were quite a few small children present in the theater when I saw the movie and I could hear them laughing and curiously asking questions about the characters. It also worked for me, and I'm by no means a small child.A few of the action scenes and some of the scenes set in the dark forest might worry very young children, but I don't think there's anything frightening enough to stop anyone seeing Brave.Those who were complaining that Pixar hasn't featured a female protagonist finally have a reason to celebrate; Merida (Macdonald) is featured heavily throughout, and she's a princess, although not in the traditional Disney style. You will hear a couple of songs, and there is a witch in the story, but Brave is not simply rehashing the formula exhausted in Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Instead, Merida is like a tougher version of Rapunzel from Tangled.Brave is a coming-of-age tale set in ancient Scotland. The main clan-leaders all have sons, and Merida is expected to marry one of them. Unfortunately, she doesn't feel ready for marriage and wants time to discover how she feels about adult pursuits. All she really wants to do is enjoy her childhood, ride her horse, and practice her archery. This is essentially a story about a girl trying to change her fate.Some of the supporting characters are funny. Her potential suitors are an interesting bunch of misfits, and they supply a few laughs early in the story. Merida's three younger brothers appear regularly and are used in very inventive ways.Be prepared to hear Scottish accents throughout the movie. It reminded me somewhat of How to Train Your Dragon in that respect. I didn't find myself rooting for Merida as strongly as I rooted for Remy in Ratatouille because the outcome never really felt in doubt. Although Merida faces considerable peril, I never suspected that things would end badly.The voice acting was particularly good. Merida's father (Connolly) stole a lot of scenes and was the source of much of the humor. Kelly Macdonald did well as Merida and kept her likable, even though some of her actions were misguided. I also noticed how effective Patrick Doyle's score was. Unlike most Pixar movies, Brave is full of action, and the music enhanced those sequences considerably.The opening five minutes provided some of the strongest scenes in the movie as we were able to see Merida as a small girl and the relationship she had with her parents. Other magical moments included her encounter with will o' the wisps in the forest. Both of these elements reminded me of Studio Ghibli works, but Brave couldn't maintain that high standard for the whole movie.What we are left with is an enjoyable 90 minutes with plenty of laughs. There's less substance than that found in the best Pixar movies, but it's still a worthy addition and I will buy the Blu-ray when it is released. The overall look of the animation does match Pixar's excellent standards and it's hard to imagine it looking any better. Be prepared for a few cheap laughs, but don't miss it in theaters. I saw the 3D version and I don't think it added anything to the experience, so stick to the 2D version if you want to save a few bucks.I was pleasantly surprised by the full movie after being disappointed by the rather formulaic trailers. I should also mention that La Luna, the latest short from Pixar, airs immediately before Brave. That's well worth your time too.",4,"More action than most Pixar titles, but still has a little magic",1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,4075,"['Pixar', 'produced', 'best', 'animated', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'even', 'worst', 'offerings', 'are', 'better', 'work', 'most', 'rival', 'studios', 'However', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'Brave', 'found', 'wondering', 'would', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'People', 'running', 'walls', 'being', 'hit', 'groin', 'are', 'usually', 'there', 'get', 'few', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'expect', 'more', 'Pixar', 'movie.I', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried.Brave', 'aimed', 'younger', 'audience', 'Pixar', 'best', 'work', 'Ratatouille', 'Up', 'contain', 'deeper', 'themes', 'such', 'conflict', 'mother', 'daughter', 'dealing', 'society', 'expectations', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'small', 'children', 'present', 'theater', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'could', 'hear', 'laughing', 'curiously', 'asking', 'questions', 'characters', 'also', 'worked', ""'m"", 'means', 'small', 'child.A', 'few', 'action', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'set', 'dark', 'forest', 'might', 'worry', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'frightening', 'enough', 'stop', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'Brave.Those', 'who', 'were', 'complaining', 'Pixar', ""n't"", 'featured', 'female', 'protagonist', 'finally', 'have', 'reason', 'celebrate', 'Merida', 'Macdonald', 'featured', 'heavily', 'princess', 'not', 'traditional', 'Disney', 'style', 'will', 'hear', 'couple', 'songs', 'witch', 'story', 'Brave', 'not', 'simply', 'rehashing', 'formula', 'exhausted', 'Snow', 'White', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'Cinderella', 'Instead', 'Merida', 'tougher', 'version', 'Rapunzel', 'Tangled.Brave', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'set', 'ancient', 'Scotland', 'main', 'clan-leaders', 'have', 'sons', 'Merida', 'expected', 'marry', 'one', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ready', 'marriage', 'time', 'discover', 'how', 'adult', 'pursuits', 'really', 'do', 'enjoy', 'childhood', 'ride', 'horse', 'practice', 'archery', 'essentially', 'story', 'girl', 'trying', 'change', 'fate.Some', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'funny', 'potential', 'suitors', 'are', 'interesting', 'bunch', 'misfits', 'supply', 'few', 'laughs', 'early', 'story', 'Merida', 'three', 'younger', 'brothers', 'appear', 'regularly', 'are', 'used', 'very', 'inventive', 'ways.Be', 'prepared', 'hear', 'Scottish', 'accents', 'movie', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'respect', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'rooting', 'Merida', 'as', 'strongly', 'rooted', 'Remy', 'Ratatouille', 'outcome', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'doubt', 'Merida', 'considerable', 'peril', 'never', 'suspected', 'things', 'would', 'end', 'badly.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'particularly', 'good', 'Merida', 'father', 'Connolly', 'stole', 'lot', 'scenes', 'was', 'source', 'much', 'humor', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'did', 'well', 'Merida', 'kept', 'likable', 'even', 'actions', 'were', 'misguided', 'also', 'noticed', 'how', 'effective', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'score', 'was', 'most', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'Brave', 'full', 'action', 'music', 'enhanced', 'sequences', 'considerably.The', 'opening', 'five', 'minutes', 'provided', 'strongest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'able', 'see', 'Merida', 'small', 'girl', 'relationship', 'had', 'parents', 'Other', 'magical', 'moments', 'included', 'encounter', 'will', 'o', 'wisps', 'forest', 'elements', 'reminded', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'Brave', 'could', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'high', 'standard', 'whole', 'movie.What', 'are', 'left', 'enjoyable', '90', 'minutes', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'less', 'substance', 'found', 'best', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'still', 'worthy', 'addition', 'will', 'buy', 'Blu-ray', 'when', 'released', 'overall', 'look', 'animation', 'match', 'Pixar', 'excellent', 'standards', 'hard', 'imagine', 'looking', 'better', 'Be', 'prepared', 'few', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'theaters', 'saw', '3D', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'added', 'anything', 'experience', 'so', 'stick', '2D', 'version', 'want', 'save', 'few', 'bucks.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'full', 'movie', 'being', 'disappointed', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'trailers', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'La', 'Luna', 'latest', 'short', 'Pixar', 'immediately', 'Brave', 'well', 'time', 'too']",N/A

It is a solid balance of humor with the emotional weight Pixar has recently become notorious for (cough Up and Toy Story 3). Furthermore, by placing the setting in a semi-historical context, the story gains a much heavier sense of importance and meaning.Pixar's recent foray into more mature work also makes the stakes much higher for each new film. Their marketing team did a solid job of not revealing many plot details (the commercials just hit the tip of the iceberg), so the plot details are genuinely surprising. The main plot has not even been addressed in any of the advertisements I've seen.I had my doubts going into it, but Brave turned out to be a very different and far superior movie than I was expecting.

Right from the get go, Brave feels charming and mature.  We are introduced to Merida, a fiesty young woman who has more on her mind than childish activities and yet does everything possible to avoid growing up.  This of course leads to a conflict with her family, which is obsessed with marrying her off as soon as possible.What ensues is what feels like a RAN inspired tale of the dangers of ripping your family apart.  Instead of tragedy though, Brave takes you on a dangerous quest to mend the tapestry of family.. with awesome action sequences that tease you with the notion of Gummi Bears returning.Brave is a great film, it's mature, it's silly and it's the first Pixar movie I've seen that has a sense of dark, tense danger.

This movie can only be described as despicable.  It is rated PG, but it might as well be PG-13, as it should not be shown to any children under 12 (or actually no one under the age of 30 should see this movie).  The only good part about this movie is the beautiful cinematography, but otherwise its trash:1. The movie simply advocates for a radical sort of rebellion by a teenage girl.  Yes, supposedly she is sorry and remorseful, but if that is so then why does everything go her way at the end anyway, and she changes her mother like she wanted to in the first place.  Come on teenage girls, rebel against your mother as best you can, then cry when you nearly destroy your family and then your family will do what you wanted them to do in the first place.  This movie is a recipe for disaster in any family.2. The is a dream movie for ultra-feminists.  Not the true feminists who want equality and opportunity for women, but the ones who feel the presence of males is superfluous, and women can do everything themselves without any males being present.  They do everything right while the men and boys are no better than a bunch of monkeys (sorry if I insult any monkeys for comparing them with the male characters in this cartoon).3. The violence of this movie is way beyond anything children should see.  I guess with kids these days exposed to violent video games and movies without parental supervision, this movie may be not a shocker, but for any normal kid living a normal kid's life, this will simply bring your boy or girl nightmares.4. The theme of this movie is:  get rid of any traditions and set your own path.  Freedom, finding your own love, no input from mother or family, that's the way a girl should act.  Then if you end up in poverty with 3 kids from 3 different boyfriends, that's alright, you made your own decisions, or paraphrasing the cartoon, you have set your own fate (and set the fate of your family towards certain disaster).5. This is the closest a cartoon has ever gotten to being a form of child abuse.  It can only confuse good kids and make not-so good kids believe that their overbearing mother and stupid father are the cause of all their problems.  The supposedly redeaming quality of the ending again would only make sense if the girl would actually make the right decision in the end and listen to what her parents asked her to do.  But essentially nowhere in the movie does the daughter listen to her parent's commands, from beginning to end.6.  Some have commented on the crass humor and inappropriate images, but these are the least of the problems of this movie.

1478209,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B005LAIHZY,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[2, 7]","""Brave"" is Disney/ Pixar's newest animated wonder, a wonderful story about the young and fiercely independent Merida, Scottish daughter of Queen Elinor and King Fergus.  The story is solid but doesn't break any new ground here: we have the princess Merida who takes after her rough-and-tumble dad and would rather hunt quail than knit mittens.  This puts her at odds with her means-well mother who is trying to teach her how to be a royal (think ""The Princess Diaries"") but Merida, whose untamed and unruly spirit is matched by those gobs of red firebrands that make up her hair, wants none of it and defies the convention of being married off to one of the sons of the heads of the opposing clans.  Because that's just not fair.  And herein our heroine asserts herself and does something very modern: she enters the challenge for her own hand and wins.  The rift between Merida and her mother comes to a breaking point and Merida makes use of a witch's spell to try to get her mother off her back (think about the storyline in Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"").The story picks up from here as Merida's mum becomes (what else?) a literal mama bear.  There's some fun here and we have a great deal of sympathy for Queen bear Elinor.  But this was just the trick to help mom and daughter bond, albeit it's a little saccharine, and Merida discovers her love for her mom while her mom discovers the value of Merida's independence.  (Some of this recalls the wonderful and underrated ""Brother Bear"" movie.)The real focus of this film is on the fierce bonds (including the fierce pulls and pushes) between mother and daughter, between the mama bear and her cubs.  She is, after all, willing to die for them and the mama bear is a tried-and-true caricature of what people and circumstances should not do in coming between her and her offspring.  This aspect of the story works in ""Brave"" even if the other aspects of the story and humor aren't up to the usual Pixar standards.  It is still better than most of what else is out there.",4,Mama bear bears the brunt of her daughter's independent ways.,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,2023,"['Brave', 'Disney/', 'Pixar', 'newest', 'animated', 'wonder', 'wonderful', 'story', 'young', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'Merida', 'Scottish', 'daughter', 'Queen', 'Elinor', 'King', 'Fergus', 'story', 'solid', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'here', 'have', 'princess', 'Merida', 'who', 'rough-and-tumble', 'dad', 'would', 'rather', 'hunt', 'quail', 'knit', 'mittens', 'odds', 'means-well', 'mother', 'who', 'trying', 'teach', 'how', 'be', 'royal', 'think', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'Merida', 'untamed', 'unruly', 'spirit', 'matched', 'gobs', 'red', 'firebrands', 'make', 'up', 'hair', 'none', 'convention', 'being', 'married', 'one', 'sons', 'heads', 'opposing', 'clans', 'just', 'not', 'fair', 'herein', 'heroine', 'something', 'very', 'modern', 'challenge', 'own', 'hand', 'wins', 'rift', 'Merida', 'mother', 'breaking', 'point', 'Merida', 'use', 'witch', 'spell', 'try', 'get', 'mother', 'back', 'think', 'storyline', 'Disney', 'Little', 'Mermaid', '.The', 'story', 'up', 'here', 'Merida', 'mum', 'becomes', 'what', 'else', 'literal', 'mama', 'bear', 'fun', 'here', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'sympathy', 'Queen', 'bear', 'Elinor', 'was', 'just', 'trick', 'help', 'mom', 'daughter', 'bond', 'little', 'saccharine', 'Merida', 'love', 'mom', 'mom', 'value', 'Merida', 'independence', 'wonderful', 'underrated', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'movie', 'real', 'focus', 'film', 'fierce', 'bonds', 'including', 'fierce', 'pulls', 'pushes', 'mother', 'daughter', 'mama', 'bear', 'cubs', 'willing', 'die', 'mama', 'bear', 'tried-and-true', 'caricature', 'what', 'people', 'circumstances', 'should', 'not', 'do', 'coming', 'offspring', 'aspect', 'story', 'Brave', 'even', 'other', 'aspects', 'story', 'humor', 'are', ""n't"", 'up', 'usual', 'Pixar', 'standards', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'else', 'there']",N/A

1478217,AAGLJJ0OUBO8V,B005LAIHZY,Tim,"[6, 8]","First off, I should probably make note that Brave has received a lot of negative reviews with the consensus being that it's ""Not Pixar's best movie."" I would like to point out that just because it is not their best movie, that does not mean that it should necessarily receive a bad review. Pixar has had a long standing history of fine animated films, being their best is quite a challenge. Saying that this is a bad movie for not being their best is like saying Shakespeare's Coriolanus is bad because it is not Hamlet. Also, this is far from their worst movie (Looking at you Cars 2). Brave is simply a fairy tale, and I say that with the highest compliments. After all, what were Disney classics like Snow White or Cinderella, but fairy tales? Fairy tales are meant to be somewhat simple stories that entertain and impart a moral. In that regard I think Brave is a huge success. I'm not saying it is Pixar's best film (though I would personally rank it there). I'm saying it shouldn't be dismissed.The plot follows a princess who is forced to... well, be rather princessy. She'd rather be an archer and could fight with the rest of them. Considering this is set in mythical Scotland, that's saying quite a bit. As her mother forces her into taking suitors, she goes to a witch in order to change her mother so that she may have her freedom. This backfires to say the least. For more than that I suggest you see the movie. The only other thing I will say is that for those who say that the bear sequences came out of nowhere, they were foreshadowed throughout the beginning. Watch it again.Enough about plot, on to technical aspects. Visually the film is stunning. The animation is grand, and Merida's hair looks amazingly real. I was honestly distracted from the plot a few times on my first view  just because I wanted to focus on the animation. Some scenes are simply breathtaking. The Blu-ray completely does honor to the visual look of the film and the 3D disc is some of the best 3D I've ever seen. While I am not a huge fan of 3D films personally, it adds a lot to the atmosphere of the old castles and the fog at night.There are enough special features to keep both kids and adults entertained, from Pixar's classic short films related to the movie to a very in depth commentary that animation fans will find very interesting.All in all, I have to give Brave as a movie a 4.5 by my own personal rating system. The film was an enjoyable fairy tale with a fun story and beautiful animation. The Blu-ray presentation is easily a 5 out of 5 and outclasses visually any other animated disk I've ever seen both in terms of 3D and standard presentation. Brave is easily one of the must own films this year.",5,A Worthy Entry in the Pixar Canon,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,2709,"['First', 'should', 'probably', 'make', 'note', 'Brave', 'received', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'consensus', 'being', 'Not', 'Pixar', 'best', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'just', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'not', 'mean', 'should', 'necessarily', 'receive', 'bad', 'review', 'Pixar', 'had', 'long', 'standing', 'history', 'fine', 'animated', 'films', 'being', 'best', 'quite', 'challenge', 'Saying', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'best', 'saying', 'Shakespeare', 'Coriolanus', 'bad', 'not', 'Hamlet', 'Also', 'far', 'worst', 'movie', 'Looking', 'Cars', '2', 'Brave', 'simply', 'fairy', 'tale', 'say', 'highest', 'compliments', 'what', 'were', 'Disney', 'classics', 'Snow', 'White', 'Cinderella', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'somewhat', 'simple', 'stories', 'entertain', 'impart', 'moral', 'regard', 'think', 'Brave', 'huge', 'success', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Pixar', 'best', 'film', 'would', 'personally', 'rank', 'there', ""'m"", 'saying', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'dismissed.The', 'plot', 'princess', 'who', 'forced', 'well', 'be', 'rather', 'princessy', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'archer', 'could', 'fight', 'rest', 'Considering', 'set', 'mythical', 'Scotland', 'saying', 'quite', 'bit', 'mother', 'taking', 'suitors', 'witch', 'order', 'change', 'mother', 'may', 'have', 'freedom', 'say', 'least', 'more', 'suggest', 'see', 'movie', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'who', 'say', 'bear', 'sequences', 'came', 'nowhere', 'were', 'foreshadowed', 'beginning', 'Watch', 'plot', 'technical', 'aspects', 'Visually', 'film', 'stunning', 'animation', 'grand', 'Merida', 'hair', 'amazingly', 'real', 'was', 'honestly', 'distracted', 'plot', 'few', 'times', 'first', 'view', 'just', 'wanted', 'focus', 'animation', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'Blu-ray', 'completely', 'honor', 'visual', 'look', 'film', '3D', 'disc', 'best', '3D', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', '3D', 'films', 'personally', 'lot', 'atmosphere', 'old', 'castles', 'fog', 'night.There', 'are', 'enough', 'special', 'features', 'keep', 'kids', 'adults', 'entertained', 'Pixar', 'classic', 'short', 'films', 'related', 'movie', 'very', 'depth', 'commentary', 'animation', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'interesting.All', 'have', 'give', 'Brave', 'movie', '4.5', 'own', 'personal', 'rating', 'system', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'fairy', 'tale', 'fun', 'story', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'easily', '5', '5', 'outclasses', 'visually', 'other', 'animated', 'disk', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'terms', '3D', 'standard', 'presentation', 'Brave', 'easily', 'one', 'must', 'own', 'films', 'year']",N/A

1478220,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B005LAIHZY,titania86,"[4, 11]","Princess Merida of the Dunbroch clan hates tradition, despises it with every fiber of her being. She loves adventuring, riding her horse, and, above all, archery. Her mother always reprimands her for doing unladylike things, which cover just about everything she likes, and instructs her how to be proper and respectful. The lessons culminate when Merida is expected to marry the young man who wins the competition between the three clans in the kingdom. Refusing to conform to convention, Merida decides to compete for her own hand and wins. She and her mother fight, leaving both tearful, frustrated, and angry. Merida rides into the woods and is let to a witch's cottage by wisps. After buying all the witch's wooden wares, she gives Merida a spell to changer her mother which would in turn change her fate. The spell doesn't go as Merida wanted, so she and her mother go in search of the witch to change her mother back to the way she was.I have been looking forward to Brave for a long time and it definitely didn't disappoint me. This is the first Pixar film to feature both a setting in the past and a female protagonist. Both the medieval Scottish setting and Merida serve the film well. The lush greens and wonderful Scottish landscapes are just perfect for this film. They really help in creating the mood of possibility, mystery, and magic. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and seem more realistic than many other recent computer animated films. Merida is a breath of fresh air after so many simpering, weak, boring female protagonists of recent years. Merida is as fiery and wild as her hair. She knows who she is and what she wants in life. Her intelligence and cleverness sometimes get her into trouble, but it's nice to see these qualities revered for once. Even though she rashly makes decisions without thinking them through and hurts some people in the process, I appreciated that this warrior princess erred on the side of impulse. Beneath it all, she truly loved and cared for her family, but didn't really know how to balance their needs with her own. Her endearing personality and the goodness at her core outweighed her carelessness and the ramifications of her impulsive actions on everyone around her.I don't believe this is really a children's film. It's a film that really speaks to mothers and teenage daughters. The conflict between Merida and her mother Elinor that is in the center of this film has no clear side that is right. Merida wants what any teenage girl wants: freedom to be herself and pursue her dreams. An arranged marriage is the last thing she wants. Elinor, on the other hand, has more than herself and her daughter to think about. The fate of the kingdom is in her hands and she must think of the kingdom's safety and wellbeing as well as her family's. Both of these women have valid worries and concerns. If they had spoken to each other rationally, they may have resolved their problems before anyone got transformed, but they are both stubborn and felt they couldn't open up to each other. I think anyone can relate to not being able to communicate with their parents or their teenaged children. Although there is a witch that can be blamed on the surface for Merida and Elinor's predicament, the real villain of the piece is really Merida, her rash decisions, and her inability to take responsibility for them. The witch is an easy scapegoat for younger viewers who don't yet understand more complex themes, but she is only in the film for a very short time and isn't particularly malicious. Some of the humor in the film is fairly simple and childish I believe to entertain young children, but the bulk of the film is for a much older crowd.One of the main shining stars of this film for me is the soundtrack. It is phenomenal and is rapidly becoming one of my favorites. I'm not too familiar with Patrick Doyle's body of work besides Thor, but after this I will seek out anything else he does. The soundtrack is incredibly varied and utilizes a variety of instruments from the Scottish culture, such as bagpipes, dulcimers, flutes, a fiddle, and a bodhran. Scottish reels and jigs create excitement and momentum, while a simple lullaby theme featuring quiet dulcimer and solemn fiddle create tenderness and sadness. My favorite is the lullaby theme from the song Noble Maiden Fair sung in Gaelic by Merida and Elinor. When that theme recurs throughout the film, it just pulls on my heart strings and makes me cry. I also loved that 3 featured songs came from the movie: Touch the Sky and Into the Open Air performed by Julie Fowlis, my new favorite Scottish singer, and Learn Me Right by Mumford and Sons. I love all these songs and have been listening to the whole soundtrack on loop since I saw it earlier this week. Another gorgeous song by Julie Fowlis was featured in the trailer for Brave, but wasn't on the soundtrack called Tha Mo Ghaol Air Aird A' Chuain. It's another gorgeous song with Julie Fowlis' pure tones and a simple strings accompaniment and one of two that are actually in Gaelic.In addition to being incredibly entertaining, full of heart, and full of emotion, Brave is a good step forward in fairy tale films. First, it's an original tale with the basic trappings that put the audience at ease. However, the conclusion is much different than most princess stories. ** SPOILERS** At the end of the film, Merida and Elinor come to a compromise and it's agreed by all the the young people will choose their own spouses. Unlike many other fairy tales, there is no real love interest for Merida and she doesn't get married at the end. She is not defined as a character by any romantic relationship. It also lets the audience see an alternative to marriage or having a family as a life choice in general. I found that refreshing in a genre that almost always ends with a marriage and a happily ever after. I loved Brave and consider it one of my favorite Pixar films. It was entertaining to both children and adults and pushed the boundaries of what a fairy tale princess film can be.",5,An unconventional fairy tale princess film,1340928000,"06 29,

I thought this was going to be an empowering movie for young girls to see, but it fell super short. Loved the graphics, her dress, hair and that she is a tough girl, but that doesn't mean that she should go on an impulse, that she can't think things through. All I saw was be free, do what makes you feel happy and even after you destroy your family with grief, things will be the way you always intended it to be. BLAH...I think I'm waiting a long long time before I show this to my 3 year old. I don't expect to be able to protect them forever, but I do find that relativism is harder to deal with than any other thing in this world. Do what makes you happy and you can't go wrong!!! BIG NO NO. Do what God would want you to do, even if it's something you don't want to do, bc in the end God knows what is best. I was disappointed in the whole plot. Instead of forcing someone to marry someone (which is true historically, but not really applicable in this age), it could have been a story line like that of the Little Mermaid III, where at first she doesn't understand why her mom would make her do certain things, but then it turns out how mom was right all along. Not go on an impulse without thinking things through (like Tangled, where Rupunzel DID think things through). The 4th king (refering to shakespeare's macbeth) had consequences, but as a girl, everything I (or any girl) will do, will in the end turn out okay no matter what.

Worse yet, something you hated with almost every fiber of your being. How far would you go to change it?King Fergus and Queen Elinor (voiced by Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson, respectively) have four children. Their triplet sons Hubert, Harris, and Hamish, and there oldest, a daughter, named Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald). Before her brothers were born Merida (Macdonald) bore witness as a bear attacked her family and took her father's leg. Subsequent to the attack, Merida, much to her mother's dismay, has grown into a free spirit who rejects her mother's influence. This doesn't stop her mother from offering tips as to how a princess must behave on a near constant basis, however. And when Merida hears the ancient tale of a prince who broke off from his duty and caused his kingdom's downfall, she rejects it without a thought. So, even with her daughter's objections, the Queen holds a contest for the first-born sons of nearby allied clans. The winner will receive her daughter's hand. As the first-born of her clan, Merida competes and wins, causing a rift that is exacerbated when Merida destroys a tapestry and the Queen retaliates by throwing Merida's bow in the fire. Merida flees to the forest in anger and follows a will o' the wisp to a cabin. The old woman inside first insists that she is a wood carver but changes her tune once Merida offers a family amulet in trade for the witch's services. The witch gives Merida a cake and tells her that it will change her mother, leaving out a few minor details as to the nature of that change and telling her only that the spell becomes permanent after the second sunrise.Kelly Macdonald is tragically underrated as an actress. I first saw her in Two Family House, an independent film released in 2000 and then in the 2005 BBC film The Girl in the Caf&eacute;. She had some recent success thanks to Boardwalk Empire, but nowhere near what she deserves, in my opinion. She does a great job as Merida, and I feel similarly about the job Connolly does voicing King Fergus. Thompson does well, but the role doesn't have anywhere near the same number of lines, for obvious reasons. The story is highly entertaining, as is the music.

I like those lovely and likable characters this animation studio continues to create - Woody and Buzz, Sulley and Mike, Lightning McQueen and Remy the gourmet mouse chef. I also like Merida, the heroine of Pixar's new film ""Brave."" (She is the first female protagonist of the company's films.) And I tried to like the film itself, which is certainly entertaining, but fails to offer a story that this brave and independent heroine really needs. In short, Merida deserves a better story.The story begins promisingly. Merida is a princess of a Scottish clan, with formidable skills with a bow and arrow. Being dissatisfied with a marriage arranged by her parents, she obtains a magic spell from a witch living in the woods so that she can thwart the marriage plan. As you expect, Merida's conduct results in a terrible disaster that she must somehow fix on her own.The best part of the film is its visuals, especially those of Merida and her hair. Voice acting is also wonderful. Kelly Macdonald captures the spirit of strong-mined Princess Merida. Another good point is that the film sometimes seems having fun with genre conventions.. Witches are often depicted in a negative light, but in ""Brave"" the Witch (voice by Julie Walters) may be strange, but definitely not evil.But the weak storyline needs improvement. That Merida looks often selfish didn't bother me. We know she will change, and she actually does, but the point is how she changes. ""Brave"" does not give the heroine a real challenge. A big bad bear is not good enough. A considerable portion of the film's second half is spent on silly slapstick involving her young brothers. Curiously Merida, a skilled archer, is not given enough chance to show what she can do.""Brave"" is better than last years' disappointment ""Cars 2,"" but the film, despite its interesting heroine, is still a letdown.",3,"The ""Brave"" Heroine Deserves a Better Story",1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,1874,"['like', 'Pixar', 'films', 'like', 'lovely', 'likable', 'characters', 'animation', 'studio', 'create', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'Sulley', 'Mike', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'Remy', 'gourmet', 'mouse', 'chef', 'also', 'Merida', 'heroine', 'Pixar', 'new', 'film', 'Brave', 'first', 'female', 'protagonist', 'company', 'films', 'tried', 'like', 'film', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'offer', 'story', 'brave', 'independent', 'heroine', 'really', 'short', 'Merida', 'better', 'story.The', 'story', 'promisingly', 'Merida', 'princess', 'Scottish', 'clan', 'formidable', 'skills', 'bow', 'arrow', 'Being', 'dissatisfied', 'marriage', 'arranged', 'parents', 'magic', 'spell', 'witch', 'living', 'woods', 'can', 'thwart', 'marriage', 'plan', 'expect', 'Merida', 'conduct', 'results', 'terrible', 'disaster', 'must', 'somehow', 'fix', 'own.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'visuals', 'especially', 'Merida', 'hair', 'Voice', 'acting', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'spirit', 'strong-mined', 'Princess', 'Merida', 'good', 'point', 'film', 'sometimes', 'having', 'fun', 'genre', 'conventions..', 'Witches', 'are', 'often', 'depicted', 'negative', 'light', 'Brave', 'Witch', 'voice', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'may', 'be', 'strange', 'definitely', 'not', 'evil.But', 'weak', 'storyline', 'improvement', 'Merida', 'often', 'selfish', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'know', 'will', 'change', 'actually', 'point', 'how', 'Brave', 'not', 'give', 'heroine', 'real', 'challenge', 'big', 'bad', 'bear', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'A', 'considerable', 'portion', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'spent', 'silly', 'slapstick', 'involving', 'young', 'brothers', 'Curiously', 'Merida', 'skilled', 'archer', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'chance', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Brave', 'better', 'last', 'years', 'disappointment', '2', 'film', 'interesting', 'heroine', 'still', 'letdown']",N/A

No matter what visually technical movie they want to make they hold the animators at bay until the story is just right.  It is why we followed a fish on a journey to find his son, felt for a robot as it discovered love, and had our hearts strung by a cowboy toy who feels tossed aside like yesterday's news.  I have no idea why I ever doubted that Brave would work as well as past Pixar hits, but I admit I expected it to be nothing more than a money grab movie.  One might come to the thought that this movie was only so Disney could have a red headed princess from Scotland to market to little girls.  I walked into the movie thinking that very thing and was knocked out by how much I enjoyed it.  Regardless of the whether or not this movie was green lighted to fit a toy market, the Pixar touch gave it such strength both visually and emotionally I tossed away my prejudious I had on such thoughts.Although there is humor of easy steriotypes in the movie that makes me feel that Disney had a finger or two in the pie the pace of the movie screamed Pixar.  There never seemed to be a conflict in the movie that was thrown in to only shock and grab your attention.  Every scene was purposeful, and seemlessly flowed into the next.  The artwork was beautiful, and I was pulling for the characters through the movie.  The relationships between the mother and daughter was realistic, yet also shows young girls how to be independent yet respectful.  Too often movies and shows have children who start off snotty rebels, and by the end are still snotty heroes.  It's nice to see a movie where they still show a girl who is independent, yet any snotty actions show real consequence.  By the end you can see the real developement of the hero, and want to root for her.  As a parent I loved how the story was enjoyed by the whole family and my girls left the theatre with a real role model to pretend to be.  The music was beautiful, and celic style made up for any overtly commercial sounding pop theme.

This is where the movie starts losing the plot. I couldn't believe my eyes. From this point on I would sit there shaking my head - what on earth were the writers thinking??Merida's mother was a strong character who exuded regal charisma. What possessed the writers to turn her into a bear?? Her bear mannerisms and Merida's interaction with her... good grief. It was such a waste of a pivotal character. If that wasn't enough Merida's three little brothers turn into bears as well!Merida's character came across as a little bratty at times but not to the extent, in my opinion, that other reviewers have made it out to be. I personally liked her character a lot: spirited, strong, independent, yet with plenty of heart. In saying that however some of her dialogue towards her mother was over the top and totally uncalled for (eg 'You're a beast. I'd rather die than be like you!'). Gotta love that big mane of red hair though.'Brave' certainly does have plenty of strong scenes (my absolute favorite being the one accompanied by the song 'Touch The Sky' - this scene gives me goosebumps every time I re-watch it) but the whole 'bear spell' storyline was just plain stupid.I was hoping that 'Brave' was going to be more grounded in some sense of reality and history, as to opposed the over-worn hocus pocus themes that seem to permeate animations. And how Merida's use of a spell to change her mother is to be considered brave is beyond me. I do re-watch the movie to purely enjoy the Scottish setting - however very rarely will I watch beyond the bear transformation scene (about 38 minutes into the story) - the movie seriously loses the plot from that moment on and is painful to watch, especially when up to that point it's terrific viewing.All in all this movie was well made, however it easily had the potential to have been so much more, had it not been for the ridiculous 'bear spell' storyline.

I should've listened to the other reviews that said this movie isn't that great. The message of the movie ultimately is- do your feminine duty.  (even if that duty entails you getting married to someone you don't want to marry).  Um- this is the same message you can find spoonfed to women through the centuries.  It would've been different if Rubella STAYED rebellious throughout the movie, but toward the end Rubella DOES decide to go ahead with the marriage for the sake of duty ""it was selfish of me not to see that this is what I had to do"" she says. Selfish because her marriage is what would end the fighting. And this was the 'lesson' she learned when she 'grew up' in the movie.  And we see her mother look at her in fondness when she does this as if to say 'my little girl has finally grown up.' ugh.So she ""learned"" that a girl needs to sacrifice her own independence and dreams for the good of others.  It was only because her mother changed her mind that it didn't actually happen and Rubella didn't go through with it.  So in the end Rubella learned to do her duty and was just lucky that her mother changed her mind about forcing rape on her in marriage.  Just dandy. The idea of the female having a duty to sacrifice herself for the needs/wants of the family and of others is further pointed to by the fact that her brothers in the movie are not expected to do anything similar themselves.  Not to mention that while Rubella is rebelling against being forced towards marriage she is deemed as ""immature"" and unlady-like... and then when the story progresses and she finally decides to succumb to marriage she does not want is when the character is implied to have 'grown up' in some way.  Ridiculous!I don't see this as that great for girls at all.  There are other animated female characters that are much more independent and don't learn this as a ""lesson.""  All in all, I think the animation and accents were really cute, but the story wasn't that great. And not just because of this women needing to be sacrificial lambs for the sake of the family idea... but the story was lacking in other ways.  It never goes into why the witch was obsessed with Bears or what happened to the prince's family (the one that turned into a bear)..  There are many interesting characters, but we don't get to learn much about them like with other disney films...  The story itself however is completely forgettable and not a healthy lesson for girls.
