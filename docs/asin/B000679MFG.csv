862044,APEF45BBSR1IC,B000679MFG,Karen Schlueter,"[10, 23]","In this movie, Gail O'Grady's character, [Jessica Gradwell] is a paralegal, and a single, divorced mother who just can't seem to do certain things right, like keeping her nose out of her 15-year-old daughter, Sara's business. For example, peeking through Sara's private photos, and her relationships with boys. Sara (Danielle Panabaker), an aspiring photographer is annoyed by her mother's faults, bitchiness and nosiness. She becomes more furious when she finds out her mother, who always denied having a ""boyfriend"" had a [six week fling] with a phony character named [Alex Lofton] (Grant Show), a [heart surgeon] involved in a malpractice suit whom Jessica was interviewing at her employ. He was also married with kids, but said that he was getting a divorce (which might have been a lie). They deliberately started a relationship, and deliberately had sex. Then after a while, Alex said he was [going back to his kids, and left]. Then Jessica found out [she was pregnant], and at first denied it to Sara when Sara found a [pregnancy test kit] in the trash. When Jessica finally fessed up, and said she was [going to have, and keep the baby], Sara lashed out. She had every right to after being lied to, and lectured about sex. She left the house, and stayed with her father, Nick for a while, but eventually she and Jessica reconcilled their differences. Still, Jessica foolishly [had the baby] (a boy unfortunately). She later decided to go to law school. She should've also realized about all the misery she had caused, and faced the facts of her consequences.This is a movie about habitual liars who get away with sexual affairs.",1,Pregnant Liars 1,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,1636,"['movie', 'Gail', ""O'Grady"", 'character', '[', 'Jessica', 'Gradwell', ']', 'paralegal', 'single', 'divorced', 'mother', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'certain', 'things', 'right', 'keeping', 'nose', '15-year-old', 'daughter', 'Sara', 'business', 'example', 'peeking', 'Sara', 'private', 'photos', 'relationships', 'boys', 'Sara', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'aspiring', 'photographer', 'annoyed', 'mother', 'faults', 'bitchiness', 'nosiness', 'more', 'furious', 'when', 'out', 'mother', 'who', 'always', 'denied', 'having', 'boyfriend', 'had', '[', 'six', 'week', 'fling', ']', 'phony', 'character', 'named', '[', 'Alex', 'Lofton', ']', 'Grant', 'Show', '[', 'heart', 'surgeon', ']', 'involved', 'malpractice', 'suit', 'whom', 'Jessica', 'was', 'interviewing', 'employ', 'was', 'also', 'married', 'kids', 'said', 'was', 'getting', 'divorce', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lie', 'deliberately', 'started', 'relationship', 'deliberately', 'had', 'sex', 'Then', 'while', 'Alex', 'said', 'was', '[', 'going', 'back', 'kids', 'left', ']', 'Then', 'Jessica', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'pregnant', ']', 'first', 'denied', 'Sara', 'when', 'Sara', 'found', '[', 'pregnancy', 'test', 'kit', ']', 'trash', 'When', 'Jessica', 'finally', 'fessed', 'up', 'said', 'was', '[', 'going', 'have', 'keep', 'baby', ']', 'Sara', 'lashed', 'out', 'had', 'right', 'being', 'lied', 'lectured', 'sex', 'left', 'house', 'stayed', 'father', 'Nick', 'while', 'eventually', 'Jessica', 'reconcilled', 'differences', 'Still', 'Jessica', 'foolishly', '[', 'had', 'baby', ']', 'boy', 'unfortunately', 'later', 'decided', 'go', 'law', 'school', 'should', ""'ve"", 'also', 'realized', 'misery', 'had', 'caused', 'faced', 'facts', 'consequences.This', 'movie', 'habitual', 'liars', 'who', 'get', 'away', 'sexual', 'affairs']",Sex & The Single Mom
