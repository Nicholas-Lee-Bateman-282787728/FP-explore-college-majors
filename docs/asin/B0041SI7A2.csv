1382185,A3890NYX72ZQ,B0041SI7A2,Amazon Customer,"[13, 15]","Since SHOUT took over the dvd production of Dragnet, the quality has been GREAT! Like Dragnet 1968 SHOUT has placed bonus material on one of the disks. For this version disk 1 has a rare 1954 Dragnet episode (I forgot the name not being at home as I write this), two Jack Web PSA announcements on Social Security along with Muscular Distrophy and a promo for Dragnet 1969. The quality of these bonus features are not restored. The rest of the disks look great and has the same selection format as Dragnet 1968. For the price this is a worth the purchase and a nice way to finish off the Dragnet series. The 69 Dragnet has quite a few episodes on Juvenile cases and if you are as old as I am you, know the bright colors used on clothes and household items at that time. Often I judge the quality of the dvd processing by the crispness of bright colors and the luminance transition from bright to dark. The dvd's are beautiful. There is very little color smear and the colors tend to be slightly warm. The fourth dvd when the Gannons drop by Friday's apartment for dinner is a good example of this. Bill Gannon's wife Rita is wearing a yellow-green suit, notice how crisp the colors are and when the neighbors drop by the apartment for a party (toward the end) notice all the different colors and see how they track (no smearing or fading). SHOUT did a nice job.

I realize that the stars reflect more what the Chief and the PD administration think a good detective should look/act like but it is not reality. As a retired police officer I know what the reality is - but the show was still fun to watch. Jack Webb did a good job for the times. It's amazing how much progress has occurred in the past 30+ years. Back then a detective had to fish a dime out of his pocket (not reimbursed) to call headquarters. I remember the first squad I drove had the radio transmitter in the trunk and a whip antenna on the rear fender - by the end of my career we were using laptops and cells phones.,4,Very Good DVD Set,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,666,"['liked', 'back', '1969', 'still', 'do', 'today', 'realize', 'stars', 'reflect', 'more', 'what', 'Chief', 'PD', 'administration', 'think', 'good', 'detective', 'should', 'look/act', 'not', 'reality', 'retired', 'police', 'officer', 'know', 'what', 'reality', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'times', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'progress', 'occurred', 'past', '30+', 'years', 'Back', 'then', 'detective', 'had', 'fish', 'dime', 'pocket', 'not', 'reimbursed', 'call', 'headquarters', 'remember', 'first', 'squad', 'drove', 'had', 'radio', 'transmitter', 'trunk', 'whip', 'antenna', 'rear', 'fender', 'end', 'career', 'were', 'using', 'laptops', 'cells', 'phones']",Dragnet 1969: Season 3

I already owned Dragnet 1967 (Season One), and preordered Dragnet 1968 (Season Two) -- it was incredible, as will be Season Three.  And I will be ordering Season Four as well when it is released on DVD, completing the 4-season set of Dragnet episodes.  All 98 episodes of Dragnet, seasons 1-4 (1967-1970) are in color!  The episodes themselves are fun to watch, even to watch over and over.  Jack Webb (Sergeant Joe Friday) simply defines the role, and his sidekick (Officer Bill Gannon) played by Harry Morgan was terrific, too.  Shout! Factory did just a first-class job on the production of the Dragnet 1968 DVD set, they set the standard, in my opinion -- and they went the extra mile on the bonus extras they included in Season Two, and I'm sure will try to again in Season Three.
