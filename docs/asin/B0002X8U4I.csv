After watching the Charlie Rose show in which he interviewed Jehane Noujaim I was very interested in watching this movie. This movie shows the war in Iraq from a different perspective, from the Arab perspective and the Al-Jazeera television perspective.This movie is a documentary which tells you the truth about the war in Iraq. It challenges you to open up your mind to what is really going on and to ignore for a second all the propaganda you've been watching on American TV and from the administration. There are many interesting interviews in this movie.Control Room shows how Al-Jazeera broadcasts the war in Iraq to over 40 million people in the Middle East. It's ironic that people like Rumsfeld say that Al-Jazeera spread lies because Rumsfeld and his gang are hypocrites who claim that they are bringing ""freedom"" to the Iraqis. There are many unique characters in this movie, my favorite being an African man who often has humorous yet true comments about the war. The Americans claim that the Arabs are showing the war in a negative light, when they are really just showing what is actually happening-civilians being slaughtered and violence being perpetrated.The style of this movie is engaging and simple, and you should go see it on DVD now if you haven't seen it.",5,Excellent movie about the war in Iraq,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,1335,"['movie', 'excellent', 'analysis', 'war', 'Iraq', 'watching', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'show', 'interviewed', 'Jehane', 'Noujaim', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'watching', 'movie', 'movie', 'war', 'Iraq', 'different', 'perspective', 'Arab', 'perspective', 'Al-Jazeera', 'television', 'perspective.This', 'movie', 'documentary', 'truth', 'war', 'Iraq', 'open', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'ignore', 'second', 'propaganda', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'American', 'TV', 'administration', 'are', 'many', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'movie.Control', 'Room', 'how', 'Al-Jazeera', 'war', 'Iraq', '40', 'million', 'people', 'Middle', 'East', 'ironic', 'people', 'Rumsfeld', 'say', 'Al-Jazeera', 'spread', 'Rumsfeld', 'gang', 'are', 'hypocrites', 'who', 'claim', 'are', 'bringing', 'freedom', 'Iraqis', 'are', 'many', 'unique', 'characters', 'movie', 'favorite', 'being', 'African', 'man', 'who', 'often', 'humorous', 'yet', 'true', 'comments', 'war', 'Americans', 'claim', 'Arabs', 'are', 'showing', 'war', 'negative', 'light', 'when', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'showing', 'what', 'actually', 'happening-civilians', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'violence', 'being', 'perpetrated.The', 'style', 'movie', 'engaging', 'simple', 'should', 'go', 'see', 'DVD', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen']",Control Room

849006,A1R602SXNGOMJ4,B0002X8U4I,A. Vegan,"[6, 7]","What an absolutely brilliant documentary about the war in Iraq.  I never realized how skewed and one sided journalism can be.  I have much respect for Al-Jazeera and was excited to know that a documentary was being made about them and their take on the War with Iraq.The film travels back and forth between the stations headquarters in Qatar and CentCom which is the main press briefing room set up by the US military in Iraq. It's a breath of fresh air to see an entire network of people who are smart and committed to the idea of debate and communication. I don't think you could find that at any of the major news networks in the States. Their operations, anecdotes and analysis are worthy of a documentary alone.But there are specific moments in the film that are especially profound and upsetting.  First and foremost, there is the death of an Al-Jazeera journalist. Before the troops entered Baghdad, the US committed air strikes on civilian targets including the building housing Al-Jazeera. In the attack, one of their correspondents is killed along with three other journalists. There is footage of the journalist facing him head-on right up until seconds before the attack. That along with a plea for justice from the journalist's wife and a completely absurd justification for the attack from the US is both infuriating and literally sickening.Finally there is the case of Lt. Josh Rushing. Throughout the film, he is the American representative that has debates and discussions with the many Arab journalists. Despite having to take the absurd position of defending US aggression, he is intelligent and empathetic. At one point he becomes self-analytical and candid talking about how he had seen images of dead Iraqi casualties one day and it didn't affect him. The next day, he was footage of American casualties and it made him sick. At that point he really had to face himself and while still in the process at least recognize how much he hates war. That story doesn't end there. With the release of the film, the Pentagon ordered Rushing not to comment on the film. Offended by this gesture, he is now seeking to leave the Marines.""Control Room"" is a movie about the War with Iraq. But that's not the half of it. It's a movie that will hopefully widen the debate about television and what is objective journalism in this country. It's also another stone catapulted through the wall of Arab stereotypes.

Mainly because it's taken almost solely from an Arab perspective: an Arab news media, living in a deeply Arab culture, and run by Arab men and women.That's not to say that what we see on NBC and Fox News here in the States is any less insightful. Skewed toward the Lazy-Boy recliner news watcher, the American news media is just as blind to its prejudices and half-truths as many other media outlets around the world.So when I read reviews of this documentary and they lambaste it for being ""one-sided"", I have to shrug and say, ""Yeah, so what news media do you watch?"" Covering the Iraq War, Al Jazeera focused on what happened and was happening from inside Bahgdad. A pretty risky proposition, a move that ends up killing one of their correspondents. Looking at the Ba'athists and other political affiliations within the country was interesting and, again, a bit skewed.The anti-American sentiment can be felt smoldering under the surface of Al-Jazeera, too.

Since the U.S. invasion of Iraq, this network has enjoyed greater publicity and has increased its following largely because of its outspoken opposition to the war. This documentary takes the viewer on a trip inside this controversial communications operation and lets you see what goes on behind the scenes.Many people operate this network operation and the vast majority f them have a decidedly anti- American bias. This isn't because of any inherent disliking of Americans, it's because of the U.S. led invasion in Iraq. The different members of this business come forward on the documentary and openly express their opposition to this U.S. led war, stating their opinions on the unethical foundation of the war, the hypocrisy, and the false pretenses that led an arrogant nation to forcibly change the leadership of a foreign country.What I like best about this documentary is the bluntness of the people on the screen. They hold back nothing when they express their collective outrage and while some of them make statements that seem a little nave, others make comments that are intelligent and thought- provoking. They vow to continue to tell people the other side of the story so that the world will know exactly what takes place each day as the U.S. and allied forces battle for political control in Iraq.Some of the scenes in this documentary are gruesome, with bloodied bodies lying dead in plain view; open wounds on the bodies of young children; and other nasty stuff. Of course, the Al Jazeera network intends it this way. They want the world to see the brutality of war, up close and personal.Al Jazeera is an anti- war operation and its members are quite vocal in their opposition to Bush, the United States, and other countries who have chosen to fight in the Iraqi conflict. The documentary is very biased, which is ironic when you consider that the mission of Al Jazeera is to expose the propaganda of the U.S. and other countries. But ""Control Room"" is still a good documentary to watch.

849011,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,B0002X8U4I,C. Chow,"[24, 80]","The fact that `Control Room' was such a critical and commercial success proves this quote true.I found `Control Room' to be neither entertaining nor informative. Those who recommend the film as,  ""It's important to see all sides of a war. Make up your own mind,"" fail to see (or mention) that `Control Room' is not a film about the Iraqi side or perception of the war. It is terrorist propaganda about how they'd like the West to see the war.Recently with the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII documentaries have been featuring interviews with Japanese soldiers from Okinawa and survivors of the atomic bombings. This is real journalism about what was happening in Japan. It would be silly to drag out old Japanese propaganda films and portray them as accurate depictions of the war in Japan.Instead of sparking discussion about the war, `Control Room' will certainly only further polarize people. Supporters will see it as more evidence of how Iraq needed to be freed from this type of media dictatorship. Protestors will see it as how Iraq was akin to Disneyland before the American fascists arrived.Having lived in China and being a fan of WWII documentaries I've become familiar with how propaganda works. The evidence of `Control Room's propaganda rather than journalism is evident in the following examples.American POWs tortured into denouncing America: By far the most shocking scenes of `Control Room' are the footage that American media refused to show of POWs being tortured into denouncing America. These scenes of people too injured to stand up and being forced by Iraq to stutter in fear words against their country are UNFORGIVABLE! The mere fact that Al Jazeera argues for this proves how heartless they are.The Iraqi on the street: Here Al Jazeera gets the opinion of the average Iraqi on the street. According to `Control Room' the average Iraqi is in a pub watching TV, drinking beer, and speaks almost perfect English. Never mind that most on Iraq lacks electricity, beer is prohibited by Muslims, and most of the country is illiterate in their own language. And what does the ""average Iraqi"" have to say in English? ""We love America. I want to immigrate there. It's George Bush who's an evil dictator who we hate."" They all seemed to be in agreement. Al Jazeera never interviews the starving Iraqis who hate Saddam. Perhaps that's because it is punishable by death to speak out against Saddam. I'm reminded of the Japanese propaganda of the same fashion. ""We love America. It's the dictator Roosevelt we hate.""Iraq will win the war: The most amusing side of `Control Room' is the fiery Iraqi rhetoric that Iraq will push the invaders back. ""This war will last for years."" They boast. ""America will never so much as set foot in Baghdad."" When tanks begin the final assault on Baghdad, Al Jazeera is still in denial, claiming it's only American propaganda. ""No tank will ever reach Baghdad."" I'm reminded of Josef Goebbels boasting that as the Soviets surrounded Berlin, ""This only proves we'll win the war. Because we'll fight harder than ever and fight them all the way back to Moscow.""The CIA is hiding the most wanted deck of cards: `Control Room' continues the lie that the Pentagon's famed most wanted card deck is of such nation security, it must be something sinister they're hiding. Living in the DC area these packs of cards are so plentiful they're sold at every souvenir stand. There's nothing sinisterly top secret about them. The makers of `Control Room' know this.Toppling of Saddam's statue was fake: Al Jazeera laughs at the toppling of the statue as being a shear fraud. According to them the event never happened; it could never happen because Saddam is so loved by the Iraqis. They laugh, ""These people in the video are not Iraqis. I know Iraqis. And this Iraqi putting up the old Iraqi flag, do they expect us to believe he was carrying it in his pocket for 15 years?"" I guess Al Jazeera expects us to believe that the Pentagon conspired to fake the whole thing. They put together an entire set for the city square of Baghdad and, hired hundreds of Arab actors, including children to act out the toppling of Saddam's statue. I don't think anyone has made the claim that people carry flags in their pockets for 15 years. He probably got it in one of the US airlift care packages containing food, medical supplies, and yes America propaganda.In conclusion, `Control Room' will certainly not spark any discussion about the war. It will only further separate the two sides. Anyone who can see `Control Room' and argue that Al Jazeera is journalism is clearly so far out to sea it's not even worth trying to reel them in.",1,The Greater The Lie The More People Will Believe

Although the context of the documentary is the media coverage of a war, there are still some moments of humor. I chuckled during some segments and came close to crying on others. The emotional intensity is high.The allegation of the 'staging' of the crowd toppling over the statue of Saddam Hussein should make you think about just how far perceptions can be swayed by those in power manipulating news broadcasts and visual images. It also makes one more critical of believing something to be a ""truth"", just because we saw it on a television news program.The killing of an Al-Jazeera reporter in one of the first ""shock and awe"" blasts rightfully creates great sadness and tension among those interviewed from the Al Jazeera station. You can also understand how hard 'objective' reporting from the remaining staff at Al-Jazeera must be after that incident.The much larger question always remains if ""objective"" reporting is possible at all. Chances are, if both sides of a controversial issue are irritated with the media coverage, the reporting is being done as objectively and effectively as possible. The truth is often very hard to swallow from both sides.The notion of banning certain graphic war images on American news broadcasts also makes one wonder what purpose censorship serves.If we are to truly learn from history, Control Room proposes the truth must be told without censorship and without the candy coating.

The DVD is loaded with extras.This movie is not a political rant and is not just an ""election year"" movie, not by a long shot.  This documentary will hold its own decades from now.  [Please see other reviews for basic concept/topic of this documentary, no point in my repeating the movie overview].For anyone who saw this movie in the theatre, you will want to GET THE DVD(!!) for the excellent extras and commentaries.  I've seen the movie twice in theatres and purchased the DVD so I could share it with others who missed it.  I was surprised to see the level of extras in the DVD, outstanding job!The DVD contains the movie shown in the theatre, plus has three additional commentary audio tracks: 1) normal movie audio, 2) commentary by the producer and cinematographer, 3) commentary by Marine Captain Josh Rushing (recorded after the movie was made), and 4) commentary by two Al Jazeera news producers.There is also a large amount of additional interviews/footage that didn't make it into the original movie.  Subtitles are available in English, Arabic, French, Spanish. WowOne of the things I really, really liked about this documentary is that it isn't out from the get go to demonize anyone.  The vast majority of the people portrayed in the film (US military press core, western news media, arab news media, etc.) come across as basically well intentioned people with very different perspectives of what is going on and what needs to be done, different cultural understandings, etc.The different audio commentary tracks also promote more food for thought from the sometimes very different perspectives of the various commentators.  When was the last time you saw a movie with audio commentary from a U.S. Marine Captain and another audio commentary with Al Jazeera producers?The best documentary DVD I've ever seen.  One of the best overall movies I've seen in the last few years, documentary or otherwise.This important movie will be viewed many times in the future, long after the war and political disputes have moved on...If you haven't seen the movie, you will be pleased with the DVD.

These non-religious Arabs paradoxically enjoy the benefits of Western Civilization while holding it in utter contempt.  Islamic fundamentalism doesn't even slightly interest them.  The vast majority attended school in the despised occidental countries.  They are the intellectual disciples of ultra-leftists Noam Chomsky and Edward Said. Truth does not exist and everything is relative.  The very concept of objectivity is a supposed fiction employed to deceive the dispossessed of the earth.  Saddam Hussein may have been a monster who enslaved and tortured his people---but he is still an Arab leader.  The reporters of Al-Jazeera have a difficult time cheering on the coalition soldiers who are about to liberate Iraq.  One woman even blurts out that she doesn't know who to favor in the conflict.  Bitterness and envy best explains their attitude.  The Arab world is today a third rate power.  Little remains of its dominance of some five hundred years ago.  Existential anguish and self pity underpins the mindset of Al-Jazeera's editorial policy and news reporting.Control Room is a must see documentary.  It is necessary to view our enemies up close and personal.  And yes, Al-Jazeera is a foe of all that is good and decent.  This news organization will continue to do much harm until its employees overcome their inferiority complex.  Ataturk warned the Arab world that there is little sense in competing against the West. On the contrary, it is best to become part of it.  Control room easily earns five stars.

849021,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0002X8U4I,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 5]","While this is not by any means a prize-winning documentary it is still worth seeing because of the perspective gained.  To see the war through Arab/Muslim eyes is what is gained.  It is a bit chilling.  Most of us watched the war through the eyes of CNN or Fox or PBS or one or more of the networks, and we saw a biased view.  The real carnage was withheld from us because it was believed that to show the bleeding and mangled bodies was to (1) inflame opinion (2) give assistance to the enemy.It was almost impossible for an American news source to present the war as it really was.  No American network executive could do that.  But for Al Jazeera, no such reluctance existed.  And that is the value of this documentary: it allows us to see what our own news media dared not show, although that too was only part of the story.Filmmaker Jehane Noujaim uses interviews and footage from inside Al Jazeera's ""control room"" and footage from the communications center of the coalition forces to show how the reporters worked.  Reports from the US authorities, Rumsfeld and the generals, the media officers in the field and at the communications center, are contrasted with actual footage and reports from Iraq.  It is clear that the news was managed by both Western services and by Al Jazeera to conform to the expectations and interests of their differing audiences.Frankly I was surprised that the bias wasn't greater (on both sides).  I came away feeling that, given that modern wars are won or lost to some extent by how well the combatants manage the news, this war within a war was a toss up.  And indeed despite Bush's declaration of victory aboard the aircraft carrier, the war on the ground as it exists today is still very much a toss up.  Coalition forces roared into Iraq and found very little resistance.  And then began the insurgency.  What does it mean to win?  How does one side lose?  As in Vietnam, victory or defeat is to some extent in the eyes of those watching.  In the field there was and is no victory.  There is only carnage.  And so the combatants try to spin the war to their advantage, because it is in the spin that one may find victory regardless of what happens in the field of battle.  In this case, Saddam Hussein and the insurgents had no media.  But the Muslim/Arab world needed such a media, and thereby arose Al Jazeera to spin the other side.  This documentary affords us a quick look at that network.However I don't think this documentary was very effective.  It lacked focus and continuity.  It seemed hastily thrown together.  We are shone some interviews, some on-camera reportorial and editorial activities, some footage from the field, from Baghdad, from Mosul.  An Al Jazeera reporter is killed by an American missile.  The people at Al Jazeera are deeply saddened and outraged.  They think it was on purpose, to ""punish"" them for reporting what Rumsfeld doesn't want reported, and they may be right; but somehow the loss seems almost trivial compared to the rest of it: the tens of thousands of people dead, the uncounted maimed and wounded, the hundreds of billions of dollars spent like buckets of water poured upon a vast and seething desert.  Somehow the ""news"" of the news reporters themselves seems somewhat irrelevant, almost, I thought, a vanity show.  We have the power to report what happens, they are telling us.  Therefore we have the power to create what happens.As was famously said, ""In war, the first casualty is truth.""

849022,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0002X8U4I,Ed Uyeshima,"[29, 33]","Having just seen Robert Greenwald's ""Outfoxed"" about the media manipulation we are subjected to by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, specifically the Fox Network, this eye-opening documentary is a fascinating counterpoint from the perspective of the famous and sometimes infamous Middle East news agency, Al-Jazeera. I cannot think of two more diametrically opposite news agencies reporting on the events in Iraq, but the key difference between them is that Al-Jazeera appears to admit to their biases rather than claim to be ""fair and balanced"". What is more startling is how much more similar they are in operation than they are different in their presentation of political opinion disguised as facts. Obviously filmmaker Jehane Noujaim takes a more sympathetic portrait of Al-Jazeera and does supply clear evidence where Al-Jazeera is right and the American government is wrong on certain Iraqi events. As an overview of the first independent and now most popular news channel in the Middle East, the film takes a hard look at the key milestones from Bush's threat of invasion through the toppling of Saddam Hussein.One would think Michael Moore funded this documentary from the damning evidence presented, but Noujaim is nothing but thorough in illustrating the Bush administration's changing rationales for invading Iraq, the use of fear in the media to manipulate public opinion, the martyrdom of Jessica Lynch, the card deck identifying the most wanted men in Hussein's regime, and the suspiciously coincidental bombing deaths of three different Arab journalists on the same day by American planes. Al-Jazeera's perspective is unsurprisingly countered by Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld, who accuses the news agency of faking pictures of civilian deaths. But Noujaim cuts to indisputable pictures of real victims from the American bombing. One of the most revealing moments in the film is the Al-Jazeera team's shocked disbelief witnessing the fall of Hussein's Iraq as they try to make their emotional response correspond to what they must rationally have expected all along. Noujaim spotlights several of Al-Jazeera's personalities, and each provides a unique opinion on both their news coverage as well as that of their American counterparts. Their begrudging respect for the Fox Network, for example, is an intriguing revelation among many presented here. Ultimately though, their disgust over American imperialism is clear, as reporter Hassan Ibrahim, as bitter an idealist as you'll ever see, decries, ""Eventually you'll have to find a solution that doesn't involve bombing someone into submission... democratize or I will shoot you."" Another eye-opener is how Al-Jazeera does not hesitate to invite Americans to give their point-of-view on the network, which is something the Fox Network purports to do but does so miserably due to the bullying tactics of their own personalities, Sean Hannity and of course, Bill O'Reilly. Those who have grown tired of the spin coming from the Bush administration will find this documentary valuable viewing.

849024,A111BH1GN0D33Z,B0002X8U4I,Folantin,"[9, 12]","The documentary ""Control Room"" is a behind-the-scenes look at al-Jazeera, the largest all-news Arabic television station. Al-Jazeera was formed in 1996, and its office is located in Qatar. Since the beginning of the Iraqi war, the number of al-Jazeera's viewers has doubled. In other words, if you are an Arab, and you are watching footage of the war, there's an excellent chance that you are watching al-Jazeera's coverage. The film's main focus is al-Jazeera's coverage of the Iraqi war, and the film begins in 3/03 with Bush's televised announcement that Saddam Hussein and his sons need to leave Iraq--or else.Curiously enough, Qatar is also the base of operations for the U.S. Central-Command (Cen-Com), and right next door is the Coalition Media Centre. Qatar is located about 700 miles from Baghdad, and all of the major news stations have offices inside the Coalition Media Centre. Some of the film's footage shows reporters from various stations summoned for press releases that are delivered by a military officer. The film illustrates the frustrations felt by the reporters who gather in one room to get the low-down on the news that is taking place hundreds of miles away. For example--one of the announcements concerns a pack of cards--featuring America's 'most wanted' Iraqis. The reporters are eager to look at the pack and identify the villains, but there's a catch. There's only one pack of cards in Cen-Com, and although the general offered to let the journalists take a look at them when he flashed them at the news conference, bottom line--the general won't part with his pack of cards--even though a horde of journalists crowd around his office and demand a look.Spokesperson, Marine Lt. Josh Rushing presents an earnest, human face to the al-Jazeera reporters and to the world. He confesses that he found the footage of the American military dead aired by al-Jazeera very distressing, but at the same time, he realizes that his reactions to the footage of the Iraqi dead failed to cause such an emotional reaction. From this observation, Lt. Rushing comprehends that Arabs observing footage of their dead are just as distressed as he is when he sees dead Americans.As for al-Jazeera, ""the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden"" (according to the Bush administration), they are not content to show the war through a system of press releases. They air footage of bodies--some severely wounded children, flattened buildings, and Iraqis screaming their grief at the camera. These scenes are the reality of war. People die. But in America, an entirely different picture is painted. The American media's presentation is, as Deema Khatib, an al-Jazeera producer comments ""like an American movie."" Rumsfeld accuses al-Jazeera of faking photos of the wounded. According to Rumsfeld, when they know a bomb is about to hit ""they grab some children and some women and pretend the bomb hit the women and children."" Al-Jazeera responds to charges that they incite the Arab world with photos of the dead and wounded by saying:""war has a human cost."" Just what are the ethics of showing the footage of the casualties of war? Should the media sanitize the war and serve it up in a series of carefully orchestrated photo-op moments (like the majority of the American Press)? Is al-Jazeera inciting the Arab world by showing the footage of the dead and wounded, or is al-Jazeera morally obligated to show these gruesome images to the world?This eye-opening documentary includes moment of shames when an al-Jazeera reporter is killed in what appears to be a deliberate targeting by an American bomber. Another shocking element of the documentary is the way in which the al-Jazeera reporters catch things that the Americans reporters don't. Scenes of the invasion of Baghdad, the toppling of Sadaam's statue, the Kurds destroying money, and children chanting hate messages to Bush are all subject to vitally different interpretations. In other words--what we see here in America is not what the Arab world sees, and furthermore we so often interpret things incorrectly simply because we do not understand. Similarly, just as Lt. Rushing insists that Palestine and Iraq are two different things, al-Jazeera reporter, Hassan Ibrahim tries to explain the two conflicts are tied in the Arab world. Can we ever understand the Arab point of view, or are we simply not interested in understanding it?""Control Room"" is a fascinating glimpse at a world that we rarely see. Al-Jazeera is full of dedicated journalists--some in traditional clothing, and some very Westernized (I noticed that none of those in traditional dress spoke to the cameras).

That did it! Soon Jordan was made to recant. Then he was made to resign!_______________________________________________________Alas, as ""CONTROL ROOM"" shows, Egyptian-American filmmaker Jehane Noujaim (Startup.com) catches the frantic action at Al-Jazeera headquarters -- as an American fighter jet targets them in their Baghdad hotel room . The deliberate killing of an Al-Jazeera reporter by a targeted air strike is pretty horrifying as captured on film. That filmed sequence alone makes it worthwhile to see CONTROL ROOM.There's no doubt, someone gave the American fighter jet pilot orders to ""take out"" Al-Jazeera in their Baghdad hotel headquarters. The plane is seen circling the city, and it briefly changes course in a shallow dive, attack mode. Three flashes of light and puffs of smoke signal the pilot had released rockets. As the jet veers off screen, the rockets hit Al-Jazeera's hotel room -- killing one of the reporters who couldn't get out of the way fast enough.Equally fascinating is the way ""CONTROL ROOM"" allows well-meaning, Western-educated, pro-democratic Arabs an opportunity to express their views on Iraq as they see it -- in an international context, and in a way most Yanks and Brits never get to hear about it.",5,SUPPORTS CNN'S E.

Then on the same note, our government got mad that Al Jazeera showed the POWs and dead American soldiers when all Al Jazeera is trying to do is show that there is a human cost to war by showing the very unfortunate deaths on both sides.In Control Room, American soldiers, the U.S. government, Iraqis, and people who work at Al Jazeera talk uncensored about their opinions and feelings.The part that I thought was the most powerful is when a Al Jazeera worker is upset about the way U.S. government is handling it's foreign policies but admires the U.S. public and our constitution - he says that he believes in our constitution and Americans have enough sense and power to do what is right and they will.This is a great documentary if want to see news which actually follows the saying - we report you decide.",5,Highly Recommended!!!,1099180800,"10 31, 2004",2004,1304,"['Wow', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'said', 'be', 'too', 'pro-American', 'Arab', 'world', 'too', 'much', 'propaganda', 'according', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'Donald', 'Rumsfield.But', 'reality', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'as', 'unbiased', 'can', 'get', 'report', 'everything', 'mean', 'literally', 'everything', 'uncensored', 'people', 'blame', 'trying', 'show', 'things', 'way', 'example', 'U.S.', 'government', 'thought', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'was', 'taking', 'supposedly', 'pro-Saddam', 'view', 'showing', 'dead', 'civilians', 'Iraq', 'Then', 'same', 'note', 'government', 'got', 'mad', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'showed', 'POWs', 'dead', 'American', 'soldiers', 'when', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'trying', 'do', 'show', 'human', 'cost', 'war', 'showing', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'deaths', 'sides.In', 'Control', 'Room', 'American', 'soldiers', 'U.S.', 'government', 'Iraqis', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'talk', 'uncensored', 'opinions', 'feelings.The', 'part', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'powerful', 'when', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'worker', 'upset', 'way', 'U.S.', 'government', 'handling', 'foreign', 'policies', 'U.S.', 'public', 'constitution', 'constitution', 'Americans', 'have', 'enough', 'sense', 'power', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'will.This', 'great', 'documentary', 'want', 'see', 'news', 'actually', 'saying', 'report', 'decide']",Control Room

Saddam sycophants singing a siren song, leading our children into godless Communism or godfull Islam!So sorry. ""Control Room"" is none of these.The film, a documentary about the Al-Jazeera network by Jehane Noujaim, does make a few very simple points. First, non-Americans have a different perspective than we do. Second, not many of them carry bombs. Third, they are often calm, rational and even nice.In any other time, ""Control Room"" might be a rather bland Frontline-style documentary piece about a journalistic source in the Arab world. In today's polarized world of us-versus-them, however, it has become subversive to declare, ever so gently, that human beings with different points of view have anything worthwhile to say to Americans. This simple point is brought home by the sight of a roomful of Al-Jazeera technicians watching the fall of Bagdad in 2003. Where Americans might have reacted with glee or some form of relief or satisfaction, the Al Jazeera techs are dumbstruck and crestfallen. They can't believe that a proud and seemingly powerful Arab country like Iraq could be conquered so quickly. The sense of disappointment, humiliation and dismay are palpable. How much more so for the uneducated masses who are susceptible to manipulation by radicals?""Control Room"" does not proselytize about the rightness of Al Jazeera's viewpoint. It merely presents us with the sight of rather ordinary journalists trying to do their jobs in the context of a clash of eastern and western cultures. Its depictions of Lieutenant Joshua Rushing, US press liaison in Baghdad is telling. Rushing tries mightily to convey American motivations and strategies to his Al Jazeera contacts. He seems perplexed and uncertain when they challenge his assumptions. Rushing tries hard to understand them, but it seems that he has two choices: to believe his own government's line, or to switch to the other man's. Clearly questioning his own logic, he cannot bring himself (for cultural and professional reasons) to accept the opposing viewpoint. ""Control Room"" expertly uses such poignant scenes to depict the struggle of well-intentioned people and the disparate ""truths"" they represent.

This is, of course, filtered through a very American lens.  It is difficult to say what the reality of the network is without actually being a part of that world or even that network, but ""Control Room"" attempts to bring us that perspective.  We are invited into the world of Al Jazeera where the network producer tells the viewer that it is his job, his passion to have an entirely fair news broadcast that presents different viewpoints and gives voice to those who are willing to speak.  The network has criticized Arab governments and has been officially banned in several nations.  It sounds so democratic.At the same time the people at the network are talking up Al Jazeera there are clips from speeches and press conferences held by Donald Rumsfeld and President Bush saying that what Al Jazeera is doing is wrong and it isn't balanced and that the network is trying to undermine the war in Iraq (this film was shot in the early days of the US invasion) by showing the violence and aftershocks of the violence and that the network is distorting the truth.  Al Jazeera counters with saying that they are only showing reality and that United States can't have it both ways, to have a war and also to be shown as entirely peaceful.  This is as much of a clash of ideology as it is about the truth in Broadcasting.The Army's press liaison asks an Al Jazeera newsman if the people at the network can be entirely unbiased and report only the truth with no shadings of interpretation.  The newsman counters by asking if the Americans can do this.  Of course, we know the answer is no.  Fox News and CNN and all of the other channels shade the reports, especially in the early stages, with Pro-American slants.  It is expected, though not truly ""fair"".  I think that the issue the United States officials and military has with Al Jazeera is that it doesn't blindly support the United States and that it does offer differing perspectives and that it does give voice to those the US finds offensive.  Perhaps even the network is Anti-American, though the film does not truly give that opinion.  The perspective the film is showing us is that Al Jazeera is a truly free network and possibly the only truly fair network.

And Central Command has its own agenda.This is a shocking documentary on a different level. ""Control Room"" shows that there is no mercy in war. Both American and Arab news stations sense something fishy when the U.S. Central Command shows a deck of cards of 52 Iraq officers who are most wanted, but refuses to disclose the deck to the news stations. Censorship is easily imposed in wars, as well as fear. The film forces viewers to question all reporting on the American side, from the color-coded terror levels in newscasts to the ""propaganda"" from Al Jazeera. It forces viewers to question what information is truly biased or propaganda.Especially in the wake of the upcoming U.S. elections, it is important to watch this film and remember the censorship and inconvenience that was spread by the U.S. government and Central Command.

But as someone who was in Iraq at the time, I can see that the film makes an awful lot of incredible assumptions. Probably its most outrageous accusation is that the US military deliberately assassinated an Al-Jazeera journalist. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This documentary doesn't provide any evidence whatsoever.The documentary also claims that the toppling of the Saddam statue was a fake or ""staged"" event. They said that the Iraqis there were not actually Iraqis, and must have been brought in by the Americans. As if a combat unit is going to bring in a dozen non-Iraqi Arabs all the hundreds of miles from Kuwait, though combat operations???? (Especially when they are traveling through a country full of Arabs already!). They asked why there wasn't more of a mob if people didn't like Saddam. Well the truth is, there was still a war going on, and there were still sniper shots going on in the square. They asked where did the Iraqi flag come from, that it must have been brought in by the Americans. But actually one lieutenant brought the flag with him with the hope of using it - I don't see how that makes the event ""staged"".The only ""other side"" of the argument is given by an inexperienced LT Josh Rushing, who is obviously over his head and the documentary takes advantage of this. Heaven forbid they might actually interview someone with more experience or more knowledge about the war itself (like even me). Incidentally, I should also point out that later Rushing left the Marines very soon after the documentary was made and was offered a job at Al-Jazeera. How convenient. A quid pro quo?

849039,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B0002X8U4I,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[9, 10]","Since September 11th, we have heard a lot about al-Jazeera. To some, they are a radical and admirable group of journalists who is bringing the concept of a free press to a geographic region that has never known it. To others, they are a hate filled, propoganda spewing, anti-American network that doesn't practice news so much as skewed drivel. Who is right? The answer, as Control Room demonstrates, might not be cut and dry.This is a film with no narrator and no commentary. It is billed as not having a partisan agenda, and while it spends much of its time covering al-Jazeera in action, I found that it was truly a fair film. What the film is 'about' is covering al-Jazeera covering the Iraq war. Of course, al-Jazeera gets a radically different picture of the war than we do (as the war is being fought in their, not our, backyard). And like any good journalists, the pictures they see dictate the story they tell.Interspersed with this, we are also able to see the struggle that media officials at cent-com (which one journalis in the film suggests sounds too much like 'sitcom') to get the American point of view across to the Arab population in an attempt to provide counterpoint to al-Jazeera.In showing all of this, this film does a great job at showing exactly how much the Middle-Eastern and U.S. perspectives differ and also how modern wars must play the PR battle as much as the field battle. In quite a few scenes, it becomes evident that the media battle is not over 'truth vs. falsehood.' Both US and Arab media are reporting facts. Rather the question is WHICH facts each reports, HOW each network reports these facts, and WHAT they exclude.For those used to documentaries like 'Farenheit 9/11' that not only offer the 'answers' to you but entertain you while it does, this film might not be for you. It is not really that entertaining, and makes no pretense at giving any answers. Even the last scene ends abruptly without warning or explanation.

It has been pushing controversial topics to its viewers.  In fact, many of these news shows have been so progressive that they critiqued some regimes, which have lead them to become banned in some Arab countries.  Nonetheless, they continue to air both sides of the news, as many of their employees hope for a better future in the Middle East.In March 2003, President George W. Bush declared war on Iraq on the basis that his administration suspected that they had weapons of mass destruction that could potentially be used against the United States.  Before the war began the United State set up a military headquarters called Central Command in the Middle East, which is located outside Doha, Qatar.  At this Central Command most news networks could get the United States' version of how things progressed in the war, which naturally provided an American biased view.  Nonetheless, Al Jazeera was present and tried to get the information in the American light.Simultaneously with the news from the Command Center, Al Jazeera had people located in Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra in order to get the Iraqi view on the war.  Through the war they received shots of civilians being killed to which Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld disputed as propaganda and deceitful lies.  When Al Jazeera aired shots of captured American POW's many Americans were heated with hatred towards Al Jazeera and the Muslim world, yet no other news station displayed the opposite side of the war.  Despite what was right or wrong, Al Jazeera aired this, which fueled the rage on both sides.  The press officer Lieutenant Josh Rushing offers the best two sided explanation to the violence in Iraq.  He comments to how he reacted with revulsion to the killed American soldiers that were filmed by Al Jazeera and how nonchalant he felt after having seen Al Jazeera's film of the mayhem after one of the American bombings that accidentally harmed and killed civilians.  To this Lt. Rushing stated, ""It makes me hate war.""This documentary displays the good and bad while telling the truth of both sides, and how it affects people on both sides.  It is truly a tragic story, yet, it offers a profound insight into how it could be to be on the other side.  One should also consider the fact that United States has had freedom of speech for over 200 years while in the Middle East this is still a new concept that they are trying to grasp.  To expect change overnight is to close the eyes to the 200 years of history in the United States that has been full of injustice and trespasses in regards to these freedoms through prejudice and hatred.  The Middle East might have to go through their own 200 years before true freedom for all is to be expected.",5,"""It makes me hate war."" - Lt.

Bernabo,"[4, 7]","During the second Gulf War the Arab news network Al Jazeera managed to be denounced by both American Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Iraqi Information Minister Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf.  In some quarters this would be taken as evidence they must have been doing something right, but seeing Al Jazeera as being anything other than right or wrong has been difficult enough that the 2004 documentary ""Control Room"" is worth seeing.  Before this you have probably heard about what the American government and television networks have had to say about Al Jazeera, so letting its producers and reporters talk for themselves is pretty interesting especially if all you really know about Al Jazeera is that they run tapes by Al Queda and showed film of hostages, wounded children, and corpses during the war with Irqai.""Control Room"" was made by Jehane Noujaim, an Arab-American documentarian who previously made ""Startup.com.""  The director's presence in this film consists of title cards and editing instead of over narration or commentary (the film is in English and Arabic with Arabic subtitles).  The focus is on how the Arab satellite news channel about other networks covered the early days of the war in Iraq and the style is certainly much more that of the spectator than the involved advocate (to wit, this ain't Michael Moore).  The result is that there is ample evidence Al Jazeera is more of a news network where they speak Arabic than an instrument of propaganda.If, for the sake of argument, the Watergate scandal represents the high point of journalism, then things have certainly slipped.  When ABC's ""Primetime Live"" did an hour-long expose on FOX's ""American Idol"" and the claims of Corey Clark that he had an inappropriate relationship with Paula Abdul, one of the show's judges was this a quest for the truth or a chance to take down another network's highest rated show a peg or too in the Nielsen ratings?  Those who have seen the documentary ""Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism"" will have an interesting choice as to where to start throwing stones first when it comes to issues of journalistic standard and integrity (and there is no end to the list of where to throw those stones).  The simple reality might be that it is no longer possible to tell who is standing on your side of the looking glass, the politicians or the reporters.That being said, what emerges here are a group of individuals, most of who are producers for Al Jazeera.  Hassan Ibrahim is an articulate man who continually makes points about how what is being shown on television plays to the Arab audience.  Deema Khatib is even more articulate Arab Woman who embodies the Arab perspective of the network.  Yes, there is a scene where she expresses disbelief that ""we"" lost Baghdad, but if you get to the deleted scenes she talks about how she wants to see the Arabs get rid of the Sadaam Husseins of the region, but she wants to see it done without outsiders accomplishing it (there are dozens of deleted scenes, consisting mostly of interview clips with these individuals).  Samir Kahder, a senior producer, is the one who responds to Rumsfeld's attacks by explaining that the network showed images of Iraqi civilians killed by U.S. bombs because they wanted to show the human cost of war.  If there is one strength to this documentary it is that you will understand Al Jazeera's perspective, even if you disagree or even detest it.  Yes, there are elements here that are critical of specific actions of the American military during the war, but we do not need Al Jazeera to tell us that was the case.Ironically, the key figure to emerge from the documentary is Lt. Josh Rushing, a Marine office assigned at Central Command to talk to reporters.  Rushing become important not because he is an American in a documentary largely about Arab television journalists, but because he has the most important epiphany.  Outraged by film on Al Jazeera of the corpses of American soldiers, Rushing notes that similar footage of dead Iraqis did not keep him from going off to dinner.  Rushing comes to the conclusion that Arabs watching these images on television would probably feel the same way about the latter as he did about the former.  This does not change Rushing's views about the war, but it underscores what is the most important lesson of ""Control Room,"" which is to simply understand a different point of view.  Even if you reject it, at least understand it first.  Fortunately, ""Control Room"" helps us do that.",5,The key here is to understand a different perspective,1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,4518,"['second', 'Gulf', 'War', 'Arab', 'news', 'network', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'managed', 'be', 'denounced', 'American', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'Iraqi', 'Information', 'Minister', 'Muhammed', 'Saeed', 'al-Sahaf', 'quarters', 'would', 'be', 'taken', 'evidence', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'something', 'right', 'seeing', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'being', 'anything', 'other', 'right', 'wrong', 'been', 'difficult', 'enough', '2004', 'documentary', 'Control', 'Room', 'worth', 'seeing', 'have', 'probably', 'heard', 'what', 'American', 'government', 'television', 'networks', 'have', 'had', 'say', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'so', 'letting', 'producers', 'reporters', 'talk', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'especially', 'really', 'know', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'run', 'tapes', 'Al', 'Queda', 'showed', 'film', 'hostages', 'wounded', 'children', 'corpses', 'war', 'Irqai', 'Control', 'Room', 'was', 'made', 'Jehane', 'Noujaim', 'Arab-American', 'documentarian', 'who', 'previously', 'made', 'Startup.com', 'director', 'presence', 'film', 'title', 'cards', 'editing', 'instead', 'narration', 'commentary', 'film', 'English', 'Arabic', 'Arabic', 'subtitles', 'focus', 'how', 'Arab', 'satellite', 'news', 'channel', 'other', 'networks', 'covered', 'early', 'days', 'war', 'Iraq', 'style', 'certainly', 'much', 'more', 'spectator', 'involved', 'advocate', 'wit', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Michael', 'Moore', 'result', 'ample', 'evidence', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'more', 'news', 'network', 'where', 'speak', 'Arabic', 'instrument', 'propaganda.If', 'sake', 'argument', 'Watergate', 'scandal', 'high', 'point', 'journalism', 'then', 'things', 'have', 'certainly', 'slipped', 'When', 'ABC', 'Primetime', 'Live', 'did', 'hour-long', 'expose', 'FOX', 'American', 'Idol', 'claims', 'Corey', 'Clark', 'had', 'inappropriate', 'relationship', 'Paula', 'Abdul', 'one', 'show', 'judges', 'was', 'quest', 'truth', 'chance', 'take', 'down', 'network', 'highest', 'rated', 'show', 'peg', 'too', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'documentary', 'Outfoxed', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'War', 'Journalism', 'will', 'have', 'interesting', 'choice', 'where', 'start', 'throwing', 'stones', 'first', 'when', 'issues', 'journalistic', 'standard', 'integrity', 'end', 'list', 'where', 'throw', 'stones', 'simple', 'reality', 'might', 'be', 'no', 'longer', 'possible', 'tell', 'who', 'standing', 'side', 'looking', 'glass', 'politicians', 'reporters.That', 'being', 'said', 'what', 'here', 'are', 'group', 'individuals', 'most', 'who', 'are', 'producers', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'Hassan', 'Ibrahim', 'articulate', 'man', 'who', 'continually', 'points', 'how', 'what', 'being', 'shown', 'television', 'plays', 'Arab', 'audience', 'Deema', 'Khatib', 'even', 'more', 'articulate', 'Arab', 'Woman', 'who', 'Arab', 'perspective', 'network', 'Yes', 'scene', 'where', 'disbelief', 'lost', 'Baghdad', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'how', 'see', 'Arabs', 'get', 'rid', 'Sadaam', 'Husseins', 'region', 'see', 'done', 'outsiders', 'accomplishing', 'are', 'dozens', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'consisting', 'mostly', 'interview', 'clips', 'individuals', 'Samir', 'Kahder', 'senior', 'producer', 'one', 'who', 'Rumsfeld', 'attacks', 'explaining', 'network', 'showed', 'images', 'Iraqi', 'civilians', 'killed', 'U.S.', 'bombs', 'wanted', 'show', 'human', 'cost', 'war', 'one', 'strength', 'documentary', 'will', 'understand', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'perspective', 'even', 'disagree', 'even', 'detest', 'Yes', 'are', 'elements', 'here', 'are', 'critical', 'specific', 'actions', 'American', 'military', 'war', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'tell', 'was', 'case.Ironically', 'key', 'figure', 'emerge', 'documentary', 'Lt.', 'Josh', 'Rushing', 'Marine', 'office', 'assigned', 'Central', 'Command', 'talk', 'reporters', 'Rushing', 'become', 'important', 'not', 'American', 'documentary', 'largely', 'Arab', 'television', 'journalists', 'most', 'important', 'epiphany', 'Outraged', 'film', 'Al', 'Jazeera', 'corpses', 'American', 'soldiers', 'Rushing', 'notes', 'similar', 'footage', 'dead', 'Iraqis', 'did', 'not', 'keep', 'going', 'off', 'dinner', 'Rushing', 'conclusion', 'Arabs', 'watching', 'images', 'television', 'would', 'probably', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'latter', 'did', 'former', 'not', 'change', 'Rushing', 'views', 'war', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'lesson', 'Control', 'Room', 'simply', 'understand', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'Even', 'reject', 'least', 'understand', 'first', 'Fortunately', 'Control', 'Room', 'do']",Control Room

I've received comments that suggests to me this film can have a profound impact on those who watch it.  For that, this film is very valuable.  Most people, I think would benefit from watching it.The most optimistic part of the film includes the portions with a young U.S. soldier that appeared to be working behind the lines in some administrative function.

This is a balanced view of the war with its tragedies, loss, suffering and pain. Jehane Noujaim has done an amazing job of portraying the picture of the other side without getting biased. This movie is not about any propaganda but about journalism and the choices journalists get (specially in middle east) and the options open (or close to them).In the western world we typically jump about democracy in middle east - the prime savior of a democracy is the free press. But then again we like the free press in Arab as long as they praise the western civilization. So when in the Arab world when Al-Jazeera tries to work towards free press and free speech Bush and his cronies are so angry. This is the essence of democracy and the way to live with it is to accept it as an aspect of life. Instead we see that US military destroys the Al-Jazeera bases.When you compare these journalists to Bill O'Rielly then they look like saints. Somehow we as American's have to get out from this idea of ""you are in our side or their side"" - the world is all too grey and there is too little black and white.I loved the documentary and after a long time saw something completely unbiased.

Many of the challenges it faces are shared by journalists everywhere.  They risk their lives to bring a story to the people.  And they are all under pressure to spin the story to their employers' wishes.The viewer meets the people who produce this news network.  There's the director Samir Khader, the chain smoking and cynical head of the organization.  He freely admits he'd be willing to work for Fox News if offered the job and wants to send his children to America for their educations.  There's Hassan Ibrahim, a former BBC correspondent.  He's a well-spoken pudgy man with a clear mind, who sees the world through a slightly different filter that I do.  And a lot of what he says makes sense challenging my perceptions on a very human level.  There's Deema Khatib, one of the Al Jazeera staff members, whose playful expressive large brown eyes sparkle with a great sense of humor, She's unveiled and modern and obviously well educated.  Then there is Lieutenant Josh Rushing, who clearly is doing his best to explain U.S. policy.  He's blue eyed and personable and very American and has a calm demeanor and a high intellect.  His interchanges with Al Jazeera personnel show a depth of understanding for all sides of the question.  And yet he is steadfast in his support of America.The film begins in March 2003 as American troops invade Iraq. Al Jazeera shows pictures of the casualties.  The American news media does not.  Al Jazeera is fast to point out some troubling realities of American foreign policy.  And, in this documentary at least, it attempts show that its news coverage is fair and balanced.  But then, again, isn't that what they all say?This film made me think.And what made me think even more were the special features included on the DVD which show more interviews with the subjects of the film and adds a bit of humanity to them all, including the American Lieutenant who has the hard job of trying to placate all sides.The situation in the world today is complex.  I came away with more insight into its depths.  There are no real answers.  Only serious questions.This is fine and troubling film that challenges all our perceptions.

Al-Jazeera was founded in 1996 as the first independent television news network in the Arab world. It's Western style coverage quickly made the Al-Jazeera persona non grata is several Arab nations for covering viewpoints critical of government policies. Al-Jazeera takes the view that objectivity is impossible to achieve in news coverage, and it is dangerously naive to think otherwise. At least in theory, the network attempts to give voice to all sides of the issue, encompassing all biases. If everybody hates them, Al-Jazeera believes it's doing it's job. If only one side hates them, their coverage must be inexcusably biased. I should mention that this is a typical Arab perspective on the news media. And it's certainly how things worked out with the United States. President Bush has accused Al-Jazeera of being ""the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden"", while Iraq banned Al-Jazeera for  broadcasting ""American propaganda"".""Control Room""'s director Jehane Noujaim, whose last documentary was ""Startup.com"", is half American and half Egyptian. The film's producer and cinematographer, Hani Safama, is half Bosnian and half Egyptian. ""Control Room"" not only shows the other side of coin, the what and why of Iraq war coverage by an Arab network, but the film  contemplates the role of the media in modern warfare. Jehane Noujaim obtained daily access to two Al-Jazeera employees, whom we get to know well over the course of the film. Samir Khader is a world-weary, stressed-out Senior Producer at the network. Hassan Ibrahim is a Sudanese-born journalist, formerly of the BBC, who grew up in Saudi Arabia, attended college in the United States, and has covered 10 wars in the course of his career. Both of these men are perceptive and articulate in their views of the machinations of the press and politicians alike. (They speak English.) Ibrahim is an affable idealist who adores the US Constitution and hates this nation's politics. Khader is more pragmatic by nature, and his astute observations give the film weight. Khader's attitudes are very typical of educated Arabs, whom we don't often hear from in the American press. Other Al-Jazeera staff whom we meet include Producer Deema Khatib, Manager Joanne Tucker, and one of the network's simultaneous translators. These people are all very idealistic about the power for positive change that an independent network such as Al-Jazeera can bring to the Arab world by bringing uncensored political and social discourse into the homes of 40 million Arabs.""Control Room""'s crew spent 5 weeks at the US Central Command, called CentCom, that had been moved from Tampa, Florida to Doha, Qatar for the invasion of Iraq. It is here that the world press gathered to broadcast announcements and ask questions of the US military. Press Officer Lt. Josh Rushing, of the Marine Corps, also gave the filmmaker's a lot of his time. It was his job to represent the American military operation to the world press. He assisted journalists however he could, all the time trying to make the US look good. The US Military couldn't have chosen a better representative. Lt. Rushing is generous with his time, friendly, fair, idealistic, remarkably patient, and always eager to understand all points of view. We also meet CNN correspondent Tom Mintier and MSNBC correspondent David Shuster at CentCom. CentCom, itself, is an interesting phenomenon. The war is being conducted from this isolated place in the middle of nowhere in Qatar. Journalists and military Press Officers alike are cut off from direct contact with the war and rely entirely on long distance communication in and out of CentCom.""Control Room"" is truly a fascinating film about the media's role in modern warfare. Seeing what Arabs saw and why is ironically revealing of what Americans saw and why. Populated with interesting characters and pointed insights, ""Control Room"" is a must-see. In English and Arabic with English subtitles.The DVD: Bonus features include 31 deleted scenes, 3 audio commentaries, and a theatrical trailer. I didn't watch all of the deleted scenes, but I found they contain a few interesting tidbits, but nothing essential. The scenes are mostly interviews with Hassan Ibrahim, Samir Khader, David Shuster, Deema Khatib, Tom Mintier, Lt. Josh Rushing,  and Moafak Tawfik. There are also some Al-Jazeera promo spots and 2 additional pieces about the day that 3 journalists were killed by American fire. The deleted scenes are organized according to whom they feature, so it's easy to find what you may be interested in.The first audio commentary is by director Jehane Noujaim and producer/cinematographer Hani Safama. They talk about the history of Al-Jazeera that compelled them to understand the people behind the network and how they convinced Hassan Ibrahim, with whom they lived during filming, among others, to give them access. The commentary includes some interesting observations about the Al-Jazeera journalists and the American Press Officers. The second audio commentary is by Capt. Josh Rushing (Lieutenant in the film). He talks about his experiences at CentCom, the characters featured in the film, and the role of media in warfare. The third audio commentary is by Hassan Ibrahim and Samir Khader. They talk about each other, how they became involved with the film, their feelings about events depicted in the film, and decisions that they made in covering the war in Iraq. Samir is more pointedly critical of the Bush Administration in the commentary than in the film, as he gives his analysis of the aftermath of the war in Iraq. All three of the commentaries are worthwhile. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Arabic, French, and Spanish.",5,Who Saw What and Why.

It is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it's willingness to go where other, stated-owned and controlled arab networks won't tread. In this sense it is more than a mere arab CNN in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media.The filmmakers here interview Al-Jazeera personel, as well as some american journalists, and the american official which liases with Al-Jazeera for Centcom, the american Central Command in the present Irak war (which happens to be 30 miles from Al Jazeera headquarters). It covers the timeline from just before the war, to just after Bush anounced main millitary operations to be over.By striving to be neutral, the documentary allows you to see how Al-Jazeera see themselves and how they conceive their mission in the world. They are very disappointed in the United States, but adhere strongly to its values.Also interesting is how being ""on the arab side"" gives them a very different perspective from western media in spite of the fact that they clearly espouse its values, like when they are angered by Pentagon protests at their having showed images of US prisoners, when western media routinely show Iraki POWs.An unexpected insight the documentary affords you is that it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management can be. The american liaison doesn't speak a word of arabic in spite of being assigned by his goverment to the most important arab news source, and as if that weren't enough, he is barely articulate in english and clearly doesn't know anything about the local context and history. Another instance of bungled media operations is when centcom tells journalists about the deck of cards with the most wanted iraki officials, but doesn't have the foresight to have some to give to journalists, irritating the very people they are trying to win over.All in all it's a compelling watch which gives you a good look into the producers of news in the west and arab worlds.

I don't have any problem with anti-Americanism, if the objections are based on factual material. There is not a lot of that here. I mean, of course, factual material and not the objections to American military actions.There was a humorous highlight in this presentation where the young, sort of attractive Arab anchorwoman, or whatever she was, screwed up her face in disbelief and said, "" Where was the Republican Guard?"" That was a good laugh. She said this when the American tanks and troops had entered Baghdad. They also claimed the rejoicing seen in the streets just after the ""liberation"" was staged by the Americans. Their idea is: No one was ever tortured or murdered by Saddam. After an 8 year war with Iran, the Shia brohers are again dancing cheek to cheek. But not to digress.There were some serious Arab objections worthy to note. There is no question we have wandered off and screwed up yet another war, albeit with the best stated intentions. Sine qua non of all wars, n'est ce pas? [Yawn] We spend more money doing this sort of thing than anyone else.One of the dramatis personnae is an oily fat, Arab, who seems to think he is the smartest fellow that ever appeared on the planet. He is set against this rather young American Lieutenant. The lieutenant thinks spin in the opposite direction is the way to confront the far out Arab position, and thus balance it. The American lieutenant, representing the army propaganda position, is just young and still a bit naive. He's a decent fellow and you can tell that. The fat Arab is simply an arrogant liar and no more. By the way, the Arab is married to this dumpy Brit person, who listens to his garbage, as if it were holy grail truth. It sort of reminds one of Himmler's wife.There are other Arabs featured, all with the same warped mindset. Can we spell myopia? To think that is the threat we will have to face in the upcoming years. Ah well, this is just the same old historical tyranny.There is one more wondrous thing about all this Al Jazeera propaganda in this presentation. They actually believe Bush is the murderer and Saddam is a martyr! I mean tres mervellieux, monsieur all this. I have just one question here for these Arabs and the producers of this thing. Was Hitler a martyr too? Excuse me, rhetorical question. They've already answered that quite clearly and that with supreme confidence.

Let us, however get one thing straight. This is a far cry from Moore. Where Moore would've shown image after bloody image to coerce you to his POV, this film provides sound analysis of international social issues. In the wake of Fahrenheit 9/11, it's refreshing to see a documentary about the Iraqi War without a political agenda.Some critics contend that this film is nothing more than another mouthpiece for Muslim radicals, merely a showcase for the more controversial footage from Al-Jazeera. They completely missed the main narrative of the film, which is not stock footage, but documentary exploration of international psyches.This is a film about two completely different cultures, so different they might as well be from different planets, suddenly thrown together in the loop, by war no less, and expected to get along. The western media defends the Western actions, and Al-Jazeera condemns them.I liked watching the various people trying to find a middle ground to stand on together, despite their personal biases. After conducting an interview with an American ""political analyst"" who turns out to be some ultraliberal nut, Samir Khader tracks down the man who set the interview up and scolds him. Hasan Ibraham, who mocks American policy every chance he gets, expresses his undying faith in our Constitution: ""The Americans will defeat the Americans."" Lt. Joshua Rushing absolutely loathes the war yet defends its necessity.The film is bookended by debates between Ibraham and Rushing. Near the film's opening, Ibraham grills the lieutenant about the occupancy of Iraq. Rushing dismisses the interview because Ibraham is a belligerent radical who carries a bias. Over the course of the film he grows to realize that no news is truly objective, that all mews is biased because all people are biased in some way. Fox displays the triumph of victory because Fox feels the victory, just as Al-Jazeera feels the tragedy of Iraq's destruction, a tragedy made that much more real when American planes attacked Al-Jazeera's offices.Toward the end of the film, Rushing and Ibraham speak again. Watching their discussion, I realized to what extent they were talking about two completely different subjects. Over the course of the conversation, they realize it too and each gains a greater appreciation for the other. The find a common ground in that they are both unable to think from the other side, and they bond, agreeing to share dinner later.The film's only drawback is that it might be too sober to keep your attention, but this is an extremely concise and accurate look at what's been going on in the world.

As one who spends a lot of time thinking about ""strategic communication"" and public diplomacy and public perception, I cannot think of a more important reference point for any US official interested in understanding where we are going wrong in the Arab and Muslim worlds.Bottom line up front: Al Jazerra gets 5 points from me, in comparison with CENTCOM 1 (for naive earnestness), and Western journalists 0 (just generally stupid).There are some spectacular flashes of insight in this documentary.  My favorite is when one of the Al Jazeera editors says that the US cannot have it both ways--it cannot be the most powerful nation in the world, exercising that power (implicitly, capriciously and dangerously and harmfully) and at the same time expect the world to love it for doing so.Over-all--and I am perhaps not the norm, having lived overseas most of my life as the son of an oilman, as a Marine Corps infantry officer, and as a clandestine case officer--I have to say that in the real world, Al Jazerra is wiping the deck with our ass.  You may not like my opinion, but there are a couple of billion people that probably agree with that opinion, and most of them, right now, are not very respectful of the old USA.It is not possible to be effective as a strategic communicator, or to practice public diplomacy, without first understanding what your target audience is seeing, hearing, and thinking.

The filming occurred in the lead up and the beginning of the American lead invasion of Iraq (initially described as it's liberation [forgetting that Saddaam Hussein was put into power in a CIA backed coup] by western governments and the western media).Of particular interest is the 'sparring' that occurs between one of the more 'rotund' members of the Al Jazeera team and the American army propaganda spokesperson. The Al Jazeera person is able to rebutt most of his arguments with authoratative ease.We are now in the internet age and control of information is becoming more and more difficult. It is all out there, all one has to do is to find it. This film exposes how uncritical the orthodox western media is about 'government authorized material' during war time. The western media is not as objective as it would like to pretend and is complicit in the lies/ommisions that have/have not been circulated about Iraq.One interesting fact put to bed by the film :Remember the day when the American troops entered Baghdad? Remember when the statue of Saddam Hussein was pulled down by the US army witnessed by a few hundred jubilant Iraqis? Remember how the orthodox media spent hours showing us this footage live (and on their highlight reels) and mostly ignoring the demonstrations by tens of thousands of Iraqis. The orthodox media reported this as a factual event, whilst on the internet news media this was reported as a fiction - a staged event done to placate the western voters. This film shows how the orthodox media was wrong and the unorthodox internet media correct.And their reward for all of this?

849060,A912C7977MO6O,B0002X8U4I,Smallchief,"[12, 15]","""Control Room"" is a documentary about the Arab news channel, Al Jazeera, and its reporting during the 2003 war with Iraq. Al Jazeera is often considered anti-US, anti-Israel and a mouthpiece for the likes of Osama Bin Laden.  A contrary view is that Al Jazeera is the first independent, unfettered, professional news channel of the Arab world.""Control Room"" looks at the Iraq war through the eyes of several Al Jazeera journalists.  That they are distressed by the easy US conquest of Iraq and the failings of the Arab world is obvious, but they are also human, cynical, and occasionally amusing.  By contrast the U.S. military and political figures in the movie appear robotic, with the exception of the young Marine, Lt. Josh Rushing, who at least grasps for reality.  ""Control Room"" tilts toward the Al Jazeera anti-war view, but all in all it's probably more fair and balanced than the coverage of the war by the US networks, which was uninformed, jingoistic, and stage-managed.  Truth - or at least information - was more likely to be found on Al Jazeera.  (That's an opinion based on being in the region before, during, and after the Iraq War.  If you wanted news you turned to Al Jazeera; if you wanted the US official line or a rehash and reinterpretation of what Al Jazeera had already told and showed you, you turned to the US networks or BBC.)The most powerful part of the film is the story of the alleged targeting of Al Jazeera's Baghdad headquarters by US warplanes and the killing of an Al Jazeera journalist.  Also, powerful are the pictures of Iraqi and American casualties of the war - rarely shown on U.S. news programs and Lt. Rushing's tortured, but honest, explanation of his reaction to Al Jazeera's broadcast of pictures of American casualties.  (Rushing apparently lost his job in the Marines as a result of his statements in this film, some of which are, heaven-forbid, introspective.)See this movie.  Like it or not, all Americans should be exposed to contrary opinions.

After intense bombing and thousands of civilian deaths, our nation's Capital is occupied and our government overthrown.  Now, I wonder how unbiased the western press would be in this situation. What is unbiased in this situation?After watching Control Room, I find Al Jazeera's coverage of this invasion to be far superior to that of any western network.  Why?  Because they are actually covering it.  What the hell happened to the media in this country?  They have lost their backbone.  They have been completely emasculated by corporate interests.  Thirty years ago, the U.S. media helped to stop the unjust war in Vietnam, not with propoganda, but with ACTUAL reporting, primarily with their cameras.  If the American media showed the real human cost of this war, as Al Jazeera does, then the American people would not stand for the criminal actions of the Bush administration.  Some Americans may think it ironic that some Arab press is more free than their own.The FACT that the U.S. military purposely targeted foreign journalists is absolutely disgusting.  What is more disgusting is the American public's complete indifference.  This kind of intimidation is inexcusable - reprehensible!  Whomever was responsible for this should be severely punished.The right-wingers will say that this movie is propaganda, as they did with Michael Moore's film.  Don't believe a word.

The gulf war was a tightly managed media event with the Americans placing journalists with combat units and managing the news by supplying them with selective positive images to feed to the world. Al Jazeerah appears to have adopted a more questioning line by releasing material showing some interviews with captured American troops and also civilian casualties.The film consists of a number of interviews, shots of the war and filmed interchanges between American army media liaison units and employees of the network. The film has a certain amount of poignancy as one of the journalists who worked for the station and appears in the early scenes was killed.  The death of this journalist attracted a lot of attention as it was speculated that the fire that killed him was due to American concern about the activities of the network. This was denied by the Americans who said that the incident was related to returning fire from the building in which the network office was located.In general the feel of the film is not so much one of direct anti Americanism but cynicism. Most of the staff of the network are not supporters of Saddam but are motivated by a general cynicism about the American media managing of the war and the underlying motivation. In one exchange a journalist suggests that no one particularly mourns Saddam but there is a feeling of unease about the fact that Bagdad is occupied by American tanks. One of the better parts of the film is the revelation that the famous pulling down of one of Saddam's statues was a contrived media stunt rather than a genuine outpouring of popular feeling. The camera angles shown by Al Jazeerah show that there was no crowd just a few people in civilian clothes heavily guarded by American tanks. One of the commentators makes the comments that the "" Iraquis"" appear not to be speaking with correct accents and comments in the absence of women and children from the event.The film is reasonably polemical and its main device is to have a number of reporters from the network discuss and debate matters with an American lieutenant who works as a media officer. The lieutenant is clearly intelligent and articulate but is unbelievably insular and has little understanding or knowledge of any culture that is not his own. The impression that one comes away with from the film is not so much that the war was the product of a malevolent impulse but rather it arose out of and was conducted a blinkered vision.",4,Worth a look,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,2587,"['documentary', 'Al', 'Jazeerah', 'reportage', 'American', 'invasion', 'Iraq', '20', 'days', 'conflict', 'gulf', 'war', 'was', 'tightly', 'managed', 'media', 'event', 'Americans', 'placing', 'journalists', 'combat', 'units', 'managing', 'news', 'supplying', 'selective', 'positive', 'images', 'feed', 'world', 'Al', 'Jazeerah', 'have', 'adopted', 'more', 'questioning', 'line', 'releasing', 'material', 'showing', 'interviews', 'captured', 'American', 'troops', 'also', 'civilian', 'casualties.The', 'film', 'number', 'interviews', 'shots', 'war', 'filmed', 'interchanges', 'American', 'army', 'media', 'liaison', 'units', 'employees', 'network', 'film', 'certain', 'amount', 'poignancy', 'one', 'journalists', 'who', 'worked', 'station', 'early', 'scenes', 'was', 'killed', 'death', 'journalist', 'attracted', 'lot', 'attention', 'was', 'speculated', 'fire', 'killed', 'was', 'due', 'American', 'concern', 'activities', 'network', 'was', 'denied', 'Americans', 'who', 'said', 'incident', 'was', 'related', 'returning', 'fire', 'building', 'network', 'office', 'was', 'located.In', 'general', 'feel', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'direct', 'anti', 'Americanism', 'cynicism', 'Most', 'staff', 'network', 'are', 'not', 'supporters', 'Saddam', 'are', 'motivated', 'general', 'cynicism', 'American', 'media', 'managing', 'war', 'underlying', 'motivation', 'one', 'exchange', 'journalist', 'one', 'particularly', 'Saddam', 'feeling', 'unease', 'fact', 'Bagdad', 'occupied', 'American', 'tanks', 'One', 'better', 'parts', 'film', 'revelation', 'famous', 'pulling', 'one', 'Saddam', 'statues', 'was', 'contrived', 'media', 'stunt', 'rather', 'genuine', 'outpouring', 'popular', 'feeling', 'camera', 'shown', 'Al', 'Jazeerah', 'show', 'was', 'crowd', 'just', 'few', 'people', 'civilian', 'clothes', 'heavily', 'guarded', 'American', 'tanks', 'One', 'commentators', 'comments', 'Iraquis', 'appear', 'not', 'be', 'speaking', 'correct', 'accents', 'comments', 'absence', 'women', 'children', 'event.The', 'film', 'reasonably', 'polemical', 'main', 'device', 'have', 'number', 'reporters', 'network', 'discuss', 'debate', 'matters', 'American', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'media', 'officer', 'lieutenant', 'clearly', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'unbelievably', 'insular', 'little', 'understanding', 'knowledge', 'culture', 'not', 'own', 'impression', 'one', 'away', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'war', 'was', 'product', 'malevolent', 'impulse', 'rather', 'arose', 'was', 'conducted', 'blinkered', 'vision']",Control Room
