873329,A18BD98SU49UB7,B0006SSOHC,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[4, 4]","I went to ""see saw"", simply because I am a huge elwes fan. I haven't always liked every film he's been apart of, but all in all he's very dependable. After reading the reviews of several critics and balancing whether or not I should spend the twenty bucks, I sauntered into the theater with low expectations. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised.Saw opens with two men in complete darkness. Only their voices are heard, as they figure out a way to turn the lights on. It takes a little courage to start a film this way. No explosions. No endless galaxies. Darkness and two voices. That drew me in pretty quickly. Then, once they take that step, the film begins.Saw is not perfect. Is any film? It has dozens of puzzles that unfold at exactly the time the plot deems it necessary. Yes, it feels sometimes forced. To me it felt like a train ride, you know its always going to go in one direction, but as long as you reach the destination, no one cares. I didn't. I just sat there, allowed the film to have its way with me, sipped my pibb, then walked away with a grin. It does touch on other films like se7en, which is sitting on my shelf right now, but if it wasn't made, would we still be bashing Saw? Also a key difference is in this we get to see the actual events, rather than the aftermaths. Also, you cannot guess the ending before it comes. Its near impossible. Yes, that's a challenge.I am going to conclude on this. I do recommend Saw, simply because it has managed to do something very few films have accomplished. It has a secret. A one million dollar budget. That is unheard of! It continues the trend of low-budget, independant films that are sweeping the globe in massive success. Saw has earned nearly 72 million dollars world wide.

I've heard a great deal of people say this and that about Carey Elwes' performance in this film.  Most people say he overdid it.  Well sorry to say this, but I highly doubt any of them have ever seen how someone would behave in that sort of situation.  Overdoing it would be Jack Nicholson (Oscar winner)in the Shining.  He'll even admit it.  I think these days people are looking for reasons to hate any movie that is marginaly original.  Or even worse...when they see one, they get confused, then a little frightened and lash out at it.  ""That movie outsmarted me! How dare it!?""  In this..the golden age of REMAKES, Saw was a brilliant whiff of originality.  Sure, comparisons could be drawn to a bunch of other films...but at least it's its own movie.  No remake of the 1976 ""classic"" here.No fetch and borrow from some piece of Japanese crap either.  Think about that when you go see The Ring2.(edit and rebuttal)Ok, I can see that some of the other reviewers failed to understand what I meant when I said that they don't know how someone would act in the situation Cary Elwes' character was in.While I admit I've never seen anyone who's been locked in a subterrainian bathroom and held hostage while his family is being threatened....I do know how people act in situations where their families are threatened and they are powerless to do anything about it.  I work in a hospital where people who've been in fairly bad trauma situations come.  A recent example would be a pretty bad shooting spree in a church group meeting.Without going into details too much, the son/brother of a group of victims arrived at the hospital a while after the attack.  He lost his father and younger brother.  His mother was still in very critical condition.  While this isn't the same thing that happened to Cary in Saw, his reaction and behavior was almost the exact same thing.  Held back tears, and the look of someone who could vomit at any second.  I hate to get all depressing, but this is the best way I can think of to illustrate my point.  I'll agree that the other actors in the film may have given a sub standard performance, but Elwes did a fantastic job of portraying a helpless man whose family was in mortal danger.So while I've never been chased by robots with drills for gentials either, I do know the difference between ridiculus acting and a performance that is either misunderstood, or too real to be believed because its too unsettling.  I think because the scenario and performance of the others in this film requires a certain suspension of disbelief, his all too realistic portrayal may have seemed out of place.",4,Isn't it funny....,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,2705,"['How', 'people', 'can', 'just', 'arbitrarily', 'say', 'what', 'good', 'acting', 'bad', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'great', 'deal', 'people', 'say', 'about', 'Carey', 'Elwes', 'performance', 'film', 'Most', 'people', 'say', 'overdid', 'Well', 'sorry', 'say', 'highly', 'doubt', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'how', 'someone', 'would', 'behave', 'sort', 'situation', 'Overdoing', 'would', 'be', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Shining', ""'ll"", 'even', 'admit', 'think', 'days', 'people', 'are', 'looking', 'reasons', 'hate', 'movie', 'marginaly', 'original', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'get', 'confused', 'then', 'little', 'frightened', 'out', 'movie', 'outsmarted', 'How', 'dare', 'this..the', 'golden', 'age', 'REMAKES', 'Saw', 'was', 'brilliant', 'whiff', 'originality', 'Sure', 'comparisons', 'could', 'be', 'drawn', 'bunch', 'other', 'films', 'least', 'own', 'movie', 'remake', '1976', 'classic', 'here.No', 'fetch', 'borrow', 'piece', 'Japanese', 'crap', 'either', 'Think', 'when', 'go', 'see', 'Ring2', 'edit', 'rebuttal', 'Ok', 'can', 'see', 'other', 'reviewers', 'failed', 'understand', 'what', 'meant', 'when', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'someone', 'would', 'act', 'situation', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'character', 'was', 'in.While', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'locked', 'subterrainian', 'bathroom', 'held', 'hostage', 'family', 'being', 'threatened', '.I', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'people', 'act', 'situations', 'where', 'families', 'are', 'threatened', 'are', 'powerless', 'do', 'anything', 'work', 'hospital', 'where', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fairly', 'bad', 'trauma', 'situations', 'come', 'recent', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'bad', 'shooting', 'spree', 'church', 'group', 'meeting.Without', 'going', 'details', 'too', 'much', 'son/brother', 'group', 'victims', 'arrived', 'hospital', 'while', 'attack', 'lost', 'father', 'younger', 'brother', 'mother', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'critical', 'condition', ""n't"", 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Cary', 'Saw', 'reaction', 'behavior', 'was', 'almost', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'Held', 'back', 'look', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'vomit', 'second', 'hate', 'get', 'depressing', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'illustrate', 'point', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'sub', 'standard', 'performance', 'Elwes', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'helpless', 'man', 'family', 'was', 'mortal', 'danger.So', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'chased', 'robots', 'drills', 'gentials', 'do', 'know', 'difference', 'ridiculus', 'acting', 'performance', 'misunderstood', 'too', 'real', 'be', 'believed', 'too', 'unsettling', 'think', 'scenario', 'performance', 'others', 'film', 'certain', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'too', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'place']",N/A

873333,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B0006SSOHC,A. Estes,"[2, 5]","As someone who is admittedly addicted to horror films, I'd like to think I've seen it all. But every now and then, a movie comes along, takes me by surprise, and knees me in the groin. ""Saw"" is that film. From beginning to end, this movie is pure intensity. Directed by the young James Wan, who is just getting started in the business (and got one helluva headstart with this movie), ""Saw"" revolves around two seemingly unrelated men (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) who wake up opposite of each other in a dirty, stinky, sketchy old bathroom, chained to the pipes and with a dead body loafing in between them. It seems that someone is playing a game with them, someone who selects the players in his game for a reason. He doesn't actually kill these people himself, but somehow, they end up dead (sound familiar, Kevin Spacey fans?). Hot on his trail, in a simultaneous subplot is Detective David Tapp (played by Danny Glover), who has a has a vendetta against one of the men trapped in the room. The movie moves at a brisk pace. It is absolutely unrelentless and virtually humorless. There isn't a moment where the movie sags, or where you, the viewer, can relax. Everytime you think you've wrapped your head around this movie, a curveball is thrown at you, straight up until the knock-out ending. I really can't explain much more about the plot without ruining parts of the movie. No doubt, this movie bares similarities with ""Se7en,"" both in the story (which was also penned by Whannell) and in Wan's directing style. However, instead of coming off as derivitive, Wan uses his obvious influences to paint a totally different picture. He uses some stark, nightmarish images to full effect (check out the child abduction scene...how creepy) and turns old cliches (Adam's apartment scene) on their heels. The story, and more importantly, the characters are what's important here. Whannell created two very different, flawed, but sympathetic leads that we really start to care for, despite whatever events unfold (I saw a little of myself in Adam). Overall, I can't find a flaw in this film. It is just mind-blowing. It is perfectly crafted. Every little shot in this movie is in there for a reason, so pay attention. ""Saw"" is more than just your average thriller, and it doesn't reduce to splatterfest either (although there are some grisly scenes). Easily the best horror flick to come out last year. Fans of the genre should not miss it. The DVD is a little disappointing, with the mere highlight being the insightful commentary from Wan and Whannell. Also included is a feature, albeit brief, on the making of the movie, along with two versions of Fear Factory's ""Bite The Hand That Bleeds"" video and a making of the video segment. Pretty skimpy for a landmark release like this.

873334,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006SSOHC,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 9]","While I will admit, with several other critics, that the acting was not great, I must resort to a comment that I made in my Grudge comment.  I did not come into this film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting.  I came into this film expecting to be impressed with a story that I hadn't seen and some imagery that would resonate throughout my mind long after the film was over.  Saw successfully accomplished this task.  While I will admit that it is nowhere close to toppling the popular Se7en, it did stand on its own two fee and provide some interesting thoughts about life and the choices we must make when placed into life-challenging moments.  It was classy in the way that it presented the story, staying away from the pitfall of being too gory, it instead placed more emphasis on simplicity and raw human emotions.  What impressed me about Saw is that it revamped the age-old Hollywood formula for these types of films.  That is what ultimately made this ending so difficult to decode.  I thought I knew exactly what was happening up until the final key moments when my mind shattered and the wildly implausible became a reality.  That is what pushed this film from your average ""serial killer"" film to a wickedly delightful noir-styled thriller.I continue reading more reviews about the acting in this film and how under par it was.  I would like to quickly mention that you are working with two of the teetering ""B"" to ""C"" grade actors of our generation.  Cary Elwes and Danny Glover could be classified as 80s superstars, but as the years passed they found themselves with less and less work, thus fading their acting ability.  After the Lethal Weapon films, I am not sure I have seen Glover in anything worth writing home about, while Elwes can be said that his career went down after Robin Hood: Men in Tights.  So, you are not dealing with the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of Hollywood, but instead two actors who read a story that was original and chilling at the same time and chose to jump onto the project for sheer enjoyment.  While their acting is not outstanding, their effort and overall feeling of excitement cannot be matched.  You can watch huge blockbuster films and think to yourself that the $20 million dollar actors are just doing it to sustain the lifestyle that they have and ultimately their performances don't seem to reach their pay scale, then you can watch these smaller, limited budget films like Saw, and appreciate the work that the actors are doing.  I guess what I am trying to say is that I agree with the critics out there that the acting wasn't great, but there was excitement and appreciation for their roles, and I have to give them credit for that.Outside of the acting, this film impressed me.  The originality of the story shocked me.  I thought it was going to be this unoriginal butcher/killer film, but instead it turned into this deeply thematic film about the values that we place on our lives as humans.  Without giving anything away, you have to appreciate what this supposed ""killer"" is doing to his victims.  The killer is opening the eyes of those that have taken their life and literally thrown it out the window.  While I do not think that it was done in the most appropriate way, this film did allow your mind to open.  Just like in Se7en when our killer is talking to Pitt and Freeman in the back of the police car, the words and ideas that are created will remain with you for a very long time.  Saw was a very intelligent film that coupled gruesome scenes of violence with the apathy of human existence.  To me, it worked.I am also extremely passionate about films that allow you to discuss the possibilities of the ending, middle, or even the beginning.  Any film that evokes conversation the moment is has finished, in my book, has done a great job.  Now, if the conversation is continually about the negative aspects of the film, then it succeeded in making a bad film, if the conversation is about the great moments, the endless possibilities, and the deeply rooted themes that pertain to life in general, than the film was successful in being good.  I despise those films that just shoot for the middle of the road, forcing you to walk away from the film or theater just not caring that you just spent your hard-earned money and time into the film.  Those films are a waste in my book.  Saw had, actually, still has me thinking about the different possibilities of the ending.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I finished the film thinking ... wow, but what does this mean?  How did this happen?  Where are we going from here?  Yada yada yada ... (did I just yada yada yada Saw?)  I could have watched it a second time back to back just to find points that I missed.  Any film that makes it exciting and interactive deserves some respect in my book ... and Saw earned it.Overall, I thought this was a much better film that I was expecting. The deeply rooted themes of human life and our choices to praise what is handed before us are strong and not often argued in film.  While the acting was about average, I did not walk into this film expecting to be blown away by performances, it was the bigger picture that I was more excited about.  Saw worked well as a whole, from the acting to the story, all the pieces put together brought a very enjoyable movie to the table, but if you look at them separately, you will not find the enjoyment, just random bits of chaos.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,5471,"['will', 'admit', 'several', 'other', 'critics', 'acting',

The real horror of Saw is watching a fine actor like Danny Glover damage his reputation by appearing in it - I would suggest that a much more interesting film could be made showing how a gentleman like Mr. Glover could be driven to such desperate ends.  After that, the most disturbing thing about Saw is the pretensions to intellectualism exhibited by its director, James Wan, and writer Leigh Whannell (who also acts like a person acting in the picture).These individuals have studied their betters carefully, combing through Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, and more obscure efforts like Deathtrap and Sleuth.  Indeed, if these two had any skill at all, they might have structured the film as a play and shot the whole thing in that filthy room with the two protagonists and alleged corpse. Unfortunately, they aren't clever; they just want you to believe they are.  What drives all four of those better films is fantastic characters whose obsessions and peculiarities are fascinating.  Saw offers us a women slitting open the belly of a man so that she can paw through his intestines in time to find the key that will save her from having her head split in half.  (Edward Albee eat your heart out!)Which brings us to Jigsaw, the mastermind behind these devious ""hands-off"" killings, orchestrated so ingeniously.  Just where do the Jigsaws of the world come from?  These psychopaths seem to have unlimited time and resources, whiling away the hours dreaming up imaginative tortures, leaving lots of cleverly encrypted clues, adding presentational flair and panache to their intricate delivery, and of course, spending countless hours on victim research and pre-planning diabolical snares.  How convenient for everyone!If you're a 14-year old boy and video games aren't violent enough for you, you will find something satisfying in Saw.  However, if you know better, but you just have a hankering for senseless gore and mayhem, spare yourself the pseudo-intellectualism and get High Tension instead.",2,"""I Sawed The Best Minds Of My Generation""",1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,2095,"['DVD', 'very', 'chic', 'clear', 'box', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'everything', 'else', 'real', 'horror', 'Saw', 'watching', 'fine', 'actor', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'damage', 'reputation', 'appearing', 'would', 'suggest', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'showing', 'how', 'gentleman', 'Mr.', 'Glover', 'could', 'be', 'driven', 'such', 'desperate', 'ends', 'most', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'Saw', 'pretensions', 'intellectualism', 'exhibited', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'writer', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'who', 'also', 'person', 'acting', 'picture', '.These', 'individuals', 'have', 'studied', 'betters', 'carefully', 'combing', 'Se7en', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'more', 'obscure', 'efforts', 'Deathtrap', 'Sleuth', 'Indeed', 'two', 'had', 'skill', 'might', 'have', 'structured', 'film', 'play', 'shot', 'whole', 'thing', 'filthy', 'room', 'two', 'protagonists', 'alleged', 'corpse', 'Unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'clever', 'just', 'want', 'believe', 'are', 'What', 'four', 'better', 'films', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'obsessions', 'peculiarities', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Saw', 'women', 'slitting', 'open', 'belly', 'man', 'can', 'paw', 'intestines', 'time', 'find', 'key', 'will', 'save', 'having', 'head', 'split', 'half', 'Edward', 'Albee', 'eat', 'heart', 'Jigsaw', 'mastermind', 'devious', 'hands-off', 'killings', 'orchestrated', 'so', 'ingeniously', 'Just', 'where', 'do', 'Jigsaws', 'world', 'come', 'psychopaths', 'seem', 'have', 'unlimited', 'time', 'resources', 'whiling', 'away', 'hours', 'dreaming', 'up', 'imaginative', 'tortures', 'leaving', 'lots', 'cleverly', 'encrypted', 'clues', 'adding', 'presentational', 'flair', 'panache', 'intricate', 'delivery', 'course', 'spending', 'countless', 'hours', 'victim', 'research', 'pre-planning', 'diabolical', 'snares', 'How', 'convenient', 'everyone', ""'re"", '14-year', 'old', 'boy', 'video', 'games', 'are', ""n't"", 'violent', 'enough', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'satisfying', 'Saw', 'However', 'know', 'better', 'just', 'have', 'hankering', 'senseless', 'gore', 'mayhem', 'spare', 'pseudo-intellectualism', 'get', 'High', 'Tension', 'instead']",N/A

It might have had a great concept, looked good via story boards, but the end result was just.  boring.  How do I know it was  boring?  It was so boring that I fast forward the DVD scenes for a good twenty or so minutes jumping to the end.  We all know the movie, I am sure.  Two chaps wake up chained in a bathroom.  Sounds like something from Married with Children eh?  But not this, some psycho (like there is not one hanging around every corner these days?) did this two them and they have to ""piece"" (excuse the pun) the clues together to solve the mystery.The movie tried too hard to have psychological horror and gore horror.  The psychological horror seemed, at least to me, as if it was trying too hard to be suspenseful and terrorizing to the mind.  Solid clues and hit and miss clues just didn't go over well with me.  It seemed to me as if the direct was trying to throw all the old and new cliches together (i.e. Hitchcock meets SEVEN meets X-Files meets CSI and on and on and on).  In this case, the charming psycho (who we think we see but ahh the ending the ending) kidnaps lads and lasses who are having a poorly lived life from their own making and puts them through a psychological horror test to see if they regain the appreciation for living.  For example, the torture of a young lady who takes drugs, well she will get a bit of a headache if she doesn't learn to appreciate her life.  This headache will be a everlasting one due to the fact that if she fails this test, her head explodes.  Charming?Then there was the gore.  We all know there is going to be gore in a movie called Saw (as if you would be thinking this movie is aimed toward helping you with wood working techniques).  Now it wasn't the kind of gore you would see in, say, Freddy vs. Jason or Seven.  The film writer and director tried to have the gore too sinister.  The film tried too hard with this department too.  An example of on of the gore scenes that was a bit subdued but still a bit to the ol' stomach is when some fellow who has a bad life has to find his way through a maze of razor wires due to the fact he tried to commit suicide (not the best way to help people with mental handicaps if you ask me).  If he makes it, he lives, he doesn't.  So he is cut to shreds.  Even better we are hit repeatedly by the images of gore.  Again. and again.  and again.  I think we get the point here, at least I did.I dont know.  I am sure many of you like this film, and I am sure it has some good qualities.  But for me, someone who's seen many a film come and go, eh, I just would rather read a book and go to bed then watch this snooze of a movie.  Maybe though.  Maybe what bothers me the most is that, taking into account the psychological horror and the gore, we are suppose to ... in some sick way ... say that what the psycho killer is doing is good.  Like with the girl who takes drugs.  She ""regains"" her humanity or something to that effect.  Are we suppose to say that this sort of treatment is good? I dont know.  Maybe I am giving this film too much credit.",1,Boring,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,3086,"['did', 'not', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'concept', 'looked', 'good', 'story', 'boards', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'just', 'boring', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'was', 'boring', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'fast', 'forward', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'good', 'twenty', 'so', 'minutes', 'jumping', 'end', 'know', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'Two', 'chaps', 'wake', 'up', 'chained', 'bathroom', 'something', 'Married', 'Children', 'eh', 'not', 'psycho', 'not', 'one', 'hanging', 'around', 'corner', 'days', 'did', 'two', 'have', 'piece', 'pun', 'clues', 'together', 'solve', 'mystery.The', 'movie', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'have', 'psychological', 'horror', 'gore', 'horror', 'psychological', 'horror', 'seemed', 'least', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'terrorizing', 'mind', 'Solid', 'clues', 'hit', 'miss', 'clues', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'well', 'seemed', 'direct', 'was', 'trying', 'throw', 'old', 'new', 'cliches', 'together', 'i.e', 'Hitchcock', 'meets', 'SEVEN', 'meets', 'X-Files', 'meets', 'CSI', 'case', 'charming', 'psycho', 'who', 'think', 'see', 'ahh', 'ending', 'ending', 'kidnaps', 'lads', 'lasses', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'poorly', 'lived', 'life', 'own', 'making', 'psychological', 'horror', 'test', 'see', 'regain', 'appreciation', 'living', 'example', 'torture', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'drugs', 'well', 'will', 'get', 'bit', 'headache', ""n't"", 'learn', 'appreciate', 'life', 'headache', 'will', 'be', 'everlasting', 'one', 'due', 'fact', 'test', 'head', 'explodes', 'Charming', 'Then', 'was', 'gore', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'gore', 'movie', 'called', 'Saw', 'would', 'be', 'thinking', 'movie', 'aimed', 'helping', 'wood', 'working', 'techniques', 'Now', 'was', ""n't"", 'kind', 'gore', 'would', 'see', 'say', 'Freddy', 'vs.', 'Jason', 'Seven', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'tried', 'have', 'gore', 'too', 'sinister', 'film', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'department', 'too', 'example', 'gore', 'scenes', 'was', 'bit', 'subdued', 'still', 'bit', 'ol', 'stomach', 'when', 'fellow', 'who', 'bad', 'life', 'find', 'way', 'maze', 'razor', 'wires', 'due', 'fact', 'tried', 'commit', 'suicide', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'help', 'people', 'mental', 'handicaps', 'ask', ""n't"", 'So', 'cut', 'shreds', 'Even', 'better', 'are', 'hit', 'repeatedly', 'images', 'gore', 'Again', 'again', 'again', 'think', 'get', 'point', 'here', 'least', 'did.I', 'dont', 'know', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'film', 'am', 'sure', 'good', 'qualities', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'many', 'film', 'come', 'go', 'eh', 'just', 'would', 'rather', 'read', 'book', 'go', 'bed', 'then', 'watch', 'snooze', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'Maybe', 'what', 'most', 'taking', 'account', 'psychological', 'horror', 'gore', 'are', 'suppose', 'sick', 'way', 'say', 'what', 'psycho', 'killer', 'doing', 'good', 'girl', 'who', 'drugs', 'regains', 'humanity', 'something', 'effect', 'Are', 'suppose', 'say', 'sort', 'treatment', 'good', 'dont', 'know', 'Maybe', 'am', 'giving', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'credit']",N/A

I had no real pre-conceived ideas beyond having heard that it was similar to ""Seven"".Although I can only give the film 4 stars, I can recommend it to all viewers of crime thrillers.  The reason for not offering a further star is that, upon reflection, the plot is perhaps too far fetched.  That point aside, the film was truly chilling.In brief, two men are chained together in a filthy basement toilet area.  They each have a saw although the saw is only sufficient to sever a limb and not adequate for braking their chains.  If they cannot escape within about 8 hours they will be killed.Through a series of flashbacks, the viewer is able to piece together a series of horrible murders that are all connected.  The connection is both the horror of the crime and the fact that the victims have a link with a local hospital.

873345,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0006SSOHC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","When `Saw' was first released it took the nation by storm.  It was the freshest thing to hit the world of horror and it still to this day has a large following.  With `Saw IV' set to hit theaters this weekend the anticipation is already thick for what new and disturbing things lay in store for the general public.  With the sequels though there has been an onslaught of critics for the original film as well calling it an overrated piece of trash.  I feel that this is an unfair assessment.  The original film was unique and thought provoking.  Finally we had a detour from the abundance of prefabricated copycats, horror films that relied heavily on severed limbs and large amounts of gore to establish a fan base.  This is not to say that `Saw' is lacking in the gore department, or even in the severed limbs area (just what do you think that `saw' is for) but it's smarter than that.  By the closing credits the audience has been forced to really open their minds, turn on their thinkers and delve into the material presented before them.  Saw is gritty, real, disturbing and most importantly stimulating.The film opens with two men waking up in a room alone with a corpse.  The two men are chained to opposite sides of the room, the corpse lying between them just out of reach.  The two men are Adam, a student, and Lawrence, a doctor.  Soon after awakening the two men are informed that they only have a short period of time before they are to be killed.  They have been left clues in order to lead them to survival but they must find and follow them.  Before long it becomes apparent that they are being toyed with by a mastermind bent on making them atone for past indiscretions.  As their sanity begins to fray they uncover that they are linked in more ways than their current situation.As far as acting is concerned, this is far from a showcase that's for sure.  Cary Elwes is somewhat all over the place here and Leigh Whannell (who co-wrote the film with director James Wan) is very amateur.  Danny Glover is decent as is Monica Porter but really the only effective actor is Tobin Bell and he's rarely seen, only heard.What `Saw' lacks in acting it makes up for in originality and sheer eeriness.  In fact this is one of the only films that have kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.  It has been compared to `Se7en', which is a nice compliment (`Se7en' is the better film), but `Saw' really is a film all its own.  Aside from the scare tactics there really is no similarity between the two films.  The subsequent sequels have been less effective than this original and it's a shame that Hollywood rushes these things because of that `it' factor, embracing a hot commodity to the effect of tarnishing a good thing.  If only a little more time and effort had been placed into creating sequels with the same originality and gritty flare as this original film then maybe we would have a complete set of worthy horror films.  Sure `Saw' has its flaws (mostly found within the acting) but it works hard within the script and plot to make up for its flaws and deliver one disturbing, horrific and gruesome good time.",4,"Dark, gritty, disturbing, gruesome; takes the best of the genre and adds a nice little twist...originality...",1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,3137,"['When', 'Saw', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'took', 'nation', 'storm', 'was', 'freshest', 'thing', 'hit', 'world', 'horror', 'still', 'day', 'large', 'following', 'Saw', 'IV', 'set', 'hit', 'theaters', 'weekend', 'anticipation', 'already', 'thick', 'what', 'new', 'disturbing', 'things', 'lay', 'store', 'general', 'public', 'sequels', 'been', 'onslaught', 'critics', 'original', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'calling', 'overrated', 'piece', 'trash', 'feel', 'unfair', 'assessment', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'unique', 'thought', 'provoking', 'Finally', 'had', 'detour', 'abundance', 'prefabricated', 'copycats', 'horror', 'films', 'relied', 'heavily', 'severed', 'limbs', 'large', 'amounts', 'gore', 'establish', 'fan', 'base', 'not', 'say', 'Saw', 'lacking', 'gore', 'department', 'even', 'severed', 'limbs', 'area', 'just', 'what', 'do', 'think', 'saw', 'smarter', 'closing', 'audience', 'been', 'forced', 'really', 'open', 'minds', 'turn', 'thinkers', 'delve', 'material', 'presented', 'Saw', 'gritty', 'real', 'disturbing', 'most', 'importantly', 'stimulating.The', 'film', 'opens', 'two', 'men', 'waking', 'up', 'room', 'alone', 'corpse', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'chained', 'opposite', 'sides', 'room', 'corpse', 'lying', 'just', 'reach', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'Adam', 'student', 'Lawrence', 'doctor', 'Soon', 'awakening', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'informed', 'only', 'have', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'are', 'be', 'killed', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'clues', 'order', 'lead', 'survival', 'must', 'find', 'follow', 'long', 'apparent', 'are', 'being', 'toyed', 'mastermind', 'bent', 'making', 'atone', 'past', 'indiscretions', 'sanity', 'fray', 'uncover', 'are', 'linked', 'more', 'ways', 'current', 'situation.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'far', 'showcase', 'sure', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'somewhat', 'place', 'here', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'very', 'amateur', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'decent', 'Monica', 'Porter', 'really', 'only', 'effective', 'actor', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'rarely', 'seen', 'only', 'heard.What', 'Saw', 'lacks', 'acting', 'up', 'originality', 'sheer', 'eeriness', 'fact', 'one', 'only', 'films', 'have', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'start', 'finish', 'been', 'compared', 'Se7en', 'nice', 'compliment', 'Se7en', 'better', 'film', 'Saw', 'really', 'film', 'own', 'Aside', 'scare', 'tactics', 'really', 'similarity', 'two', 'films', 'subsequent', 'sequels', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'effective', 'original', 'shame', 'Hollywood', 'things', 'factor', 'embracing', 'hot', 'commodity', 'effect', 'tarnishing', 'good', 'thing', 'only', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'effort', 'had', 'been', 'placed', 'creating', 'sequels', 'same', 'originality', 'gritty', 'flare', 'original', 'film', 'then', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'complete', 'set', 'worthy', 'horror', 'films', 'Sure', 'Saw', 'flaws', 'mostly', 'found', 'acting', 'hard', 'script', 'plot', 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'deliver', 'one', 'disturbing', 'horrific', 'gruesome', 'good', 'time']",N/A

873352,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B0006SSOHC,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[5, 6]","Actor-writer Leigh Whannel stars with Cary Elwes and Danny Glover in this horror-thriller in the vein of Seven. Newcomer James Wan takes on the directing duties for this ambitious, but flawed film called Saw. Financed by Lions Gate Films which is quickly earning the reputation for taking chances on small, low-budget horror films that other major studios and their independent house won't touch.Saw succeeds in creating a palpable dread and tension as the character of Adam (Whannel) and Lawrence (Elwes in scenery-chewing mode) wake up with no memory of how they got into chained-up in adingy and dimly lit shower room. Slowly the two characters try to figure out why they've been chained into pipings in the room. Soon ehough a tape recorded message informs them of the situation they're in and all of it due to demented criminal who the press and the police have dubbed Jigsaw. The premise of their incarceration is simple. Jigsaw wants them to play a game where they must find clues and tools hidden around the room and escape from just in time to save Lawrence's wife and daughter. This premise and the reasoning as to why they must play this game is one of this film's strong points, but it also becomes one of its flaws as the Whannel overwrites the dialogue into trying to explain everything through the Elwes character. Whannel as a writer doesn't seem to trust his audience to solve or even understand the premise and Jigsaw. Unlike Seven which gives just enough hints and clues for people to try and solve the problem, Saw pretty much tries to give everything away. Fortunately, the story in convoluted and twisty enough that the audience might be confused by the time Elwes character over-explains everything. Saw is the kind of film that surely would've benefitted from the concept of less is more.The acting is average to say the least with Elwes chewing up every scene he's in. It's hard to gauge whether Elwes' performance was due to the pedestrian script he had to read from or if he thought that was what the character needed. Either way his character dominated the film even in scenes when he should've stayed in the background. Whannel as an actor is believable enough and probably a level better than as a writer. Though he was abit too subdued, but then that might've been due to the fact he had to act opposite of the over-the-top Elwes. Danny Glover makes an appearance as a burned-out cop whose earlier run-in with Jigsaw led to his partner's death and him scarred for life. Glover's seems to barely register in the film and his character seems abit tacked on to give the story an added dimension to make it complex. Horror films should really try to stay simple.Saw does deliver in the gore department, but not overly much. It just had enough squirm-inducing scenes in the beginning, middle and end chapters to make the film worthwhile to fans of R-rated horror. This film will not be mistaken for one of the PG-13 Japanese ghost remakes of the last five years. As stated earlier this film owes alot more to Fincher's Seven than to Nakata's Ringu series. The quick frantic beginning makes way for a middle part where too much talking and not enough horror sequences. Fortunately, the pacing speeds up once more in the last 10-15 minutes as Jigsaw's game and manipulations come to a bloody and twisted end.One thing to mention as a stand-out character even though he's only on the screen a limited time is the genre actor Tobin Bell who plays Jigsaw with a twisted sense of tragic nobility. As much as Jigsaw may be the demented creator of the game and trap Adam and Lawrence have been put in, it was very difficult not to admire Bell's character. He's not on par with Hannibal Lector, but he has that potential to be one of the classic cinematic villains.In the end, Saw was a good enough horror movie for fans of the genre. Though casual horror fans may be more shocked with the film's scenes and premise than hardened horror-aficionados. Saw could've been very good or great if not for its overexplanation of everything going on in the scene and the average acting performance of most of the cast. Tobin Bell's performance being the only real highlight of the entire group. The ending of Saw seems well-suited for sequels. I wouldn't mind seeing what new complex game Jigsaw has in mind for a new set of unworthies.",3,"A good horror film with an interesting premise, but flawed nonetheless",1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,4344,"['Actor-writer', 'Leigh', 'Whannel', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'horror-thriller', 'vein', 'Seven', 'Newcomer', 'James', 'Wan', 'directing', 'duties', 'ambitious', 'flawed', 'film', 'called', 'Saw', 'Financed', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Films', 'quickly', 'earning', 'reputation', 'taking', 'chances', 'small', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'other', 'major', 'studios', 'independent', 'house', 'wo', ""n't"", 'touch.Saw', 'creating', 'palpable', 'dread', 'tension', 'character', 'Adam', 'Whannel', 'Lawrence', 'Elwes', 'scenery-chewing', 'mode', 'wake', 'up', 'memory', 'how', 'got', 'chained-up', 'adingy', 'dimly', 'lit', 'shower', 'room', 'Slowly', 'two', 'characters', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'chained', 'pipings', 'room', 'Soon', 'tape', 'recorded', 'message', 'situation', ""'re"", 'due', 'demented', 'criminal', 'who', 'press', 'police', 'have', 'dubbed', 'Jigsaw', 'premise', 'incarceration', 'simple', 'Jigsaw', 'play', 'game', 'where', 'must', 'find', 'clues', 'tools', 'hidden', 'room', 'escape', 'just', 'time', 'save', 'Lawrence', 'wife', 'daughter', 'premise', 'reasoning', 'why', 'must', 'play', 'game', 'one', 'film', 'strong', 'points', 'also', 'one', 'flaws', 'Whannel', 'dialogue', 'trying', 'explain', 'everything', 'Elwes', 'character', 'Whannel', 'writer', ""n't"", 'seem', 'trust', 'audience', 'solve', 'even', 'understand', 'premise', 'Jigsaw', 'Unlike', 'Seven', 'just', 'enough', 'hints', 'clues', 'people', 'try', 'solve', 'problem', 'Saw', 'pretty', 'much', 'tries', 'give', 'everything', 'away', 'Fortunately', 'story', 'convoluted', 'twisty', 'enough', 'audience', 'might', 'be', 'confused', 'time', 'Elwes', 'character', 'over-explains', 'everything', 'Saw', 'kind', 'film', 'surely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'benefitted', 'concept', 'less', 'more.The', 'acting', 'average', 'say', 'least', 'Elwes', 'chewing', 'up', 'scene', 'hard', 'gauge', 'Elwes', 'performance', 'was', 'due', 'pedestrian', 'script', 'had', 'read', 'thought', 'was', 'what', 'character', 'needed', 'way', 'character', 'dominated', 'film', 'even', 'scenes', 'when', 'should', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'background', 'Whannel', 'actor', 'believable', 'enough', 'probably', 'level', 'better', 'writer', 'was', 'abit', 'too', 'subdued', 'then', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'due', 'fact', 'had', 'act', 'opposite', 'over-the-top', 'Elwes', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'appearance', 'burned-out', 'cop', 'earlier', 'run-in', 'Jigsaw', 'led', 'partner', 'death', 'scarred', 'life', 'Glover', 'barely', 'register', 'film', 'character', 'abit', 'tacked', 'give', 'story', 'added', 'dimension', 'make', 'complex', 'Horror', 'films', 'should', 'really', 'try', 'stay', 'simple.Saw', 'deliver', 'gore', 'department', 'not', 'overly', 'much', 'just', 'had', 'enough', 'squirm-inducing', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'chapters', 'make', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'fans', 'R-rated', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'mistaken', 'one', 'PG-13', 'Japanese', 'ghost', 'remakes', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'stated', 'earlier', 'film', 'alot', 'more', 'Fincher', 'Seven', 'Nakata', 'Ringu', 'series', 'quick', 'frantic', 'beginning', 'way', 'middle', 'part', 'where', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'not', 'enough', 'horror', 'sequences', 'Fortunately', 'pacing', 'up', 'once', 'more', 'last', '10-15', 'minutes', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'manipulations', 'come', 'bloody', 'twisted', 'end.One', 'thing', 'mention', 'stand-out', 'character', 'even', 'only', 'screen', 'limited', 'time', 'genre', 'actor', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'who', 'Jigsaw', 'twisted', 'sense', 'tragic', 'nobility', 'As', 'much', 'Jigsaw', 'may', 'be', 'demented', 'creator', 'game', 'trap', 'Adam', 'Lawrence', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'not', 'admire', 'Bell', 'character', 'not', 'par', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'potential', 'be', 'one', 'classic', 'cinematic', 'villains.In', 'end', 'Saw', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'genre', 'casual', 'horror', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'shocked', 'film', 'scenes', 'premise', 'hardened', 'horror-aficionados', 'Saw', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'not', 'overexplanation', 'everything', 'going', 'scene', 'average', 'acting', 'performance', 'most', 'cast', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'performance', 'being', 'only', 'real', 'highlight', 'entire', 'group', 'ending', 'Saw', 'well-suited', 'sequels', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'what', 'new', 'complex', 'game', 'Jigsaw', 'mind', 'new', 'set', 'unworthies']",N/A

It's typical horror, psychological stuff that will either thrill you or leave you wondering why you even bothered to rent it. And one shock (which happens in the end) doesn't make up for a mediocre movie. The characters don't learn anything about themselves, the ""killer's"" (he's more like a puppermaster) motivation lacks depth, and his choice of victim is screwy with what motivation we do get. This movie is just, well, stale.So Adam and Lawrence wake up in a dirty bathroom, each chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room with a guy who has blown his head off laying between them. They don't remember how they got there, nor do they know why they of all people were so unfortunate as to end up in a smelly, disgusting bathroom. Lawrence thinks he knows who did it-- the same guy, known as the jigsaw killer, who had killed (or rather set up his victim's to kill themselves) several people. We learn that Lawrence was a suspect. Anything of importance about Adam, Lawrence, and the killer, are revealed in a series of flashbacks. It's a tad confusing, but it's all sorted out in the end. And the final shock is actually pretty good. I didn't see it coming.This movie is just under par in terms of character. I really want to see a horror movie that has a killer with awesome motivation and victims who use their heads instead of machetes to discover the mystery murderer. If Lawrence had thought about the situation a little more, he would've concluded that sawing his foot off (yes, he does that, and it's cringe-worthy) was a bad idea.

First of all, the acting is too melodramatic; Carey Elwes and Danny Glover, among others, just seem flat and unconvincing at times.  The writer of the film, who felt the need to cast himself in one of the main roles, clearly needs a little more practice before he tackles another big part.

873357,AI46E73DWKD2B,B0006SSOHC,BackToGood,"[0, 0]","SAW (2004), for better or worse, is a landmark film. Very LOW in budget, yet very HIGH in concept, this film basically broke the mold for the way horror films are being presented in the 21st century. There had never really been a horror movie like this one before. Prior to the late 70s, horror movies tended to be more cerebral and psychological, demanding viewers full attention. Then, with the advent of ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" in the late 70s/early 80s, horror movies had become ""teens-in-peril"" slasher exercises that have been copied ad nauseum ever since. Then ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" in the mid-80s, introduced an interesting concept, but was kind of it's own entity that was hard to replicate. In the 90s, the horror genre was dying. Movie-goers were tiring of the same old ""not-so-bright teenagers being snuffed out one by one"" formula, until ""Scream"" came along and breathed life back into the genre, but it had to go the homage route to really work. SAW introduced a new kind of horror to the movie-going world that didn't need to be anything more than what it was.In nonlinear fashion, SAW tells the tale of one Dr. Lawrence Gordon (well-played in an understated performance by Cary Elwes), whose character we are introduced to at the start. Gordon is being held prisoner in what appears to be a bathroom in an industrial facility. He is chained to the pipes, along with another prisoner Adam (persuasively played by newcomer Leigh Wannell, who also was a co-writer as well as starred in the short film that this movie is developed from). A tape recording nearby makes the men soon realize that they are pawns in the game of a mysterious figure coined ""Jigsaw"".Flashback scenes reveal that Jigsaw plays games with his victims, compelling them to make life-changing decisions while under his capture. The ""game"" usually involves the captive having to make a choice of either doing something they would never do under normal circumstances, or risk certain death in one of Jigsaw's traps! The lead cop in the investigation of this unique serial killer is Detective Tapp (solid performance by Danny Glover, and of course he's used to playing a cop), and his partner is Det. Sing (convincingly played by Ken Leung). Befuddled by Jigsaw's MO, the cops have a difficult time getting a break in the case.The cops do actually catch somewhat of a break in one case, a rare one where one of Jigsaw's victims actually survived. In the most keeper scene of the film, the viewer is treated to a firsthand account of the depth of Jigsaw's unapologetic menace in the form of Amanda (stellar performance by Shawnee Smith). While being interrogated by Tapp, Amanda reveals in a flashback the events of how she escaped Jigsaw's trap for her. This creepy and shocking scene is one of the most disturbing horror sequences I've ever seen, part gory, but more mental horror. Smith's amazing performance (along with that VERY CREEPY doll!), really sells it.SAW actually plays like trying to solve a ""jigsaw"" puzzle, as little by little, in flashbacks, we get details of how Gordon and Adam ended up as Jigsaw's victims while the 2 men brainstorm to try and beat him at his own game in the present. The maze-like presentation accentuates the film, which is told with so much style, confidence, and flair that it's hard to believe the shoestring budget with which it was actually made. It certainly doesn't look or feel like a low-budget exercise, or even an independent film.In addition to being wow-ed by Smith's small part, the other actors do a good job of selling the film's most horrific moments in conveying genuine fear and terror. They all acted how I would expect a person to act when they were on the verge of certain death! In addition to the aforementioned Elwes, Glover, Whannell, and Smith, the film also boasts good work by Monica Potter (as Gordon's wife), Makenzie Vega (as Gordon's daughter), and especially Michael Emerson (as a creepy orderly at Gordon's hospital).Director James Wan (who also developed the original story with Whannell) displays wonderful cinematic flourishes, with very colorful eye-popping sets, great camera angles, quick jump-cut editing, and incorporates creepy yet pulse-pounding music at the perfect moments.To further hit on SAW's importance and influence, it spawned a slew of popular sequels and copycats, most of which ventured into the infamous ""torture porn"" category to push the envelope on showing as much blood, gore, and pain as possible. But SAW was really the first, and IMHO, still the best because it is more MENTAL, making one think ""What would you do?"" in these tricky situations. When I first saw this movie 10 years ago, this was the first horror film in a long time that truly scared me on a PSYCHOLOGICAL level because I imagined myself to be in the situation of some of these victims, and the mere thought was unbearable. That is how much this movie affected me! For better or worse, SAW created a whole new genre of horror.",5,Groundbreaking addition to the horror genre,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,4990,"['SAW', '2004', 'better', 'worse', 'landmark', 'film',

873358,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B0006SSOHC,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[4, 5]","This is another instance where hype leads to disappointment. Saw was a big ""word-of-mouth"" film when it came out in theaters. It was supposedly ""different"". Not typical horror, more of a mix of twisted psychological horror, suspense, and whodunit. It wasn't a gore fest by any means (although it's pretty darn gruesome at times). And some people loathe it for that because they expected copious amounts of blood and gore, and Saw didn't really deliver that.Its story and devices smack of ""The Abominable Doctor Phibes"", or the serial killer movie ""Se7en"" ... even a scenario from ""Suspiria"" is borrowed. ""Saw"" plays with several genres including the detective story. It comes off at first viewing as engaging but truly it's not a fun movie by any means. Some horror movies are fun because they are truly scary and entertaining. Saw is not entertaining enough or truly scary; it's fairly suspenseful and feels tantalizing in its puzzles, but it needs more than that to succeed. But to be fair, when you consider that this was a low budget indy movie, its tremendous success is really impressive.I'm not going to describe the premise or plot too much. Too many reviews for Saw start by saying ""These two guys wake up chained to a pipe in a disgusting bathroom..."" and they begin to delve into a nutshell synopsis. You'll find out what it's about when you watch it.Saw doesn't really quite know what it is, or what it wants to be. Is it a horror movie? Some say yes, others deny it vehemently. Yes, it's stylish enough (but sometimes the silly sped-up cinematography gets too obvious, like the film is trying hard to be cool), and the twisted scenarios that the psycho has dreamed up are pretty disturbing. But there seems to be not really enough meat here. When it's finished we are left feeling a bit empty... like what we just experienced was just an exercise in sadism, and not much more. And the entire story falls apart when carefully scrutinized. It's a bit disappointing when you see so much potential at the start, and then witness the movie fizzling/struggling until its surprise ending.Bottom line: worth a look for horror buffs, but overall nothing to scream about.",3,A Grisly Film with Few True Frights,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,2174,"['instance', 'where', 'hype', 'disappointment', 'Saw', 'was', 'big', 'word-of-mouth', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'was', 'supposedly', 'different', 'Not', 'typical', 'horror', 'more', 'mix', 'twisted', 'psychological', 'horror', 'suspense', 'whodunit', 'was', ""n't"", 'gore', 'fest', 'means', 'pretty', 'darn', 'gruesome', 'times', 'people', 'loathe', 'expected', 'copious', 'amounts', 'blood', 'gore', 'Saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'deliver', 'that.Its', 'story', 'devices', 'smack', 'Abominable', 'Doctor', 'Phibes', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'Se7en', 'even', 'scenario', 'Suspiria', 'borrowed', 'Saw', 'several', 'genres', 'including', 'detective', 'story', 'off', 'first', 'viewing', 'engaging', 'not', 'fun', 'movie', 'means', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'fun', 'are', 'truly', 'scary', 'entertaining', 'Saw', 'not', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'truly', 'scary', 'fairly', 'suspenseful', 'feels', 'tantalizing', 'puzzles', 'more', 'succeed', 'be', 'fair', 'when', 'consider', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'indy', 'movie', 'tremendous', 'success', 'really', 'impressive.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'describe', 'premise', 'plot', 'too', 'much', 'Too', 'many', 'reviews', 'Saw', 'start', 'saying', 'two', 'guys', 'wake', 'up', 'chained', 'pipe', 'disgusting', 'bathroom', 'begin', 'delve', 'nutshell', 'synopsis', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'when', 'watch', 'it.Saw', ""n't"", 'really', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'what', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'say', 'yes', 'others', 'deny', 'vehemently', 'Yes', 'stylish', 'enough', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'sped-up', 'cinematography', 'too', 'obvious', 'film', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'cool', 'twisted', 'scenarios', 'psycho', 'dreamed', 'up', 'are', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'there', 'be', 'not', 'really', 'enough', 'meat', 'here', 'When', 'finished', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'bit', 'empty', 'what', 'just', 'experienced', 'was', 'just', 'exercise', 'sadism', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'entire', 'story', 'falls', 'apart', 'when', 'carefully', 'scrutinized', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'when', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'start', 'then', 'witness', 'movie', 'fizzling/struggling', 'surprise', 'ending.Bottom', 'line', 'worth', 'look', 'horror', 'buffs', 'overall', 'nothing', 'scream', 'about']",N/A

873362,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B0006SSOHC,Ben Rowland,"[2, 2]","Saw functions on two levels, as a serial killer thriller and a psychological horror film. It achieves success in both areas, and is actually a good film that is not nearly as graphic as the trailers and the adverts might lead you to believe. While hardly a great movie, it is good for it's genre, and should appeal to it's fans.The movie opens with two characters, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and nondescript young Joe-everyman Adam (Leigh Whannell), waking up in some dingy forgotten bathroom, chained to the walls with a dead body lying between them. We soon learn, well ahead of the main protagonists, that they are the victims of a serial killer known as ""Jigsaw"", known for his unusual MO of having his victims kill themselves somehow. To elaborate on that would be giving too much away. Both men discover that they are in danger, and they must work together to find their way out, otherwise Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter will die, and they will rot in their ""prison"". Added to the mix is the disgruntled cop (Danny Glover) who has personal reasons for finding the serial killer, who basically adds filler to the story that would otherwise be too short for a feature length movie. While Saw borrows from more prominent serial killer movies, especially Seven, it does have some unique twists and clever fright scenes. Where this movie really succeeds is in the visual atmosphere. The dank bathroom and the spooky interior settings make this movie very unsettling, while the more visceral horror works on a more psychological level.Saw works on the whole, but it is not without flaws. For starters, a good plot doesn't necessarily mean a good script. The dialogue, written by star Leigh Whannell, it totally banal and stilted, and it makes the screenplay seem very much like the work of an amateur. Next, the acting is less than first rate. Whannell is not bad, but Elwes is definitely out of his element in this movie. While he is not known as great actor, he has done much better than this before. However, my biggest problem is with the Danny Glover character, the clich&eacute;d ""bitter cop out for revenge"" subplot that has been done to death, and it adds nothing of value to this movie.Despite it's shortcomings, Saw is an effective and compelling thriller that should satisfy most of it's audience. The premise of the story, coupled with the notable plot twists, save this movie from being just another serial killer rehash, and I would recommend it based on that alone.",3,A cut above the average.,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,2486,"['Saw', 'functions', 'two', 'levels', 'serial', 'killer', 'thriller', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'success', 'areas', 'actually', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'graphic', 'trailers', 'adverts', 'might', 'lead', 'believe', 'hardly', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'genre', 'should', 'appeal', 'fans.The', 'movie', 'two', 'characters', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Gordon', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'nondescript', 'young', 'Joe-everyman', 'Adam', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'waking', 'up', 'dingy', 'forgotten', 'bathroom', 'chained', 'walls', 'dead', 'body', 'lying', 'soon', 'learn', 'well', 'ahead', 'main', 'protagonists', 'are', 'victims', 'serial', 'killer', 'known', 'Jigsaw', 'known', 'unusual', 'MO', 'having', 'victims', 'kill', 'somehow', 'elaborate', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'men', 'discover', 'are', 'danger', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'way', 'otherwise', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'wife', 'daughter', 'will', 'die', 'will', 'rot', 'prison', 'Added', 'mix', 'disgruntled', 'cop', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'who', 'personal', 'reasons', 'finding', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'basically', 'filler', 'story', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'too', 'short', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'Saw', 'borrows', 'more', 'prominent', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'especially', 'Seven', 'have', 'unique', 'twists', 'clever', 'fright', 'scenes', 'Where', 'movie', 'really', 'visual', 'atmosphere', 'dank', 'bathroom', 'spooky', 'interior', 'settings', 'make', 'movie', 'very', 'unsettling', 'more', 'visceral', 'horror', 'more', 'psychological', 'level.Saw', 'whole', 'not', 'flaws', 'starters', 'good', 'plot', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'good', 'script', 'dialogue', 'written', 'star', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'totally', 'banal', 'stilted', 'screenplay', 'seem', 'very', 'much', 'work', 'amateur', 'Next', 'acting', 'less', 'first', 'rate', 'Whannell', 'not', 'bad', 'Elwes', 'definitely', 'element', 'movie', 'not', 'known', 'great', 'actor', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'before', 'However', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'character', 'clich', 'eacute', 'bitter', 'cop', 'revenge', 'subplot', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'nothing', 'value', 'movie.Despite', 'shortcomings', 'Saw', 'effective', 'compelling', 'thriller', 'should', 'satisfy', 'most', 'audience', 'premise', 'story', 'coupled', 'notable', 'plot', 'twists', 'save', 'movie', 'being', 'just', 'serial', 'killer', 'rehash', 'would', 'recommend', 'based', 'alone']",N/A

873368,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0006SSOHC,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[14, 19]","`Saw' is a delightful movie to review, as it is such a mix of both good and poor qualities that it is a challenge to weigh them against one another to see what comes out ahead. For the impatient, I will say that I think the two cancel one another out in weighing the overall quality of the movie; however, the interesting aspects make the movie worth seeing and buying, in spite of the negatives.The first and most important positive for a horror film is the visceral reaction of the viewer. Did the movie scare, frighten, or cause mad dashes to the bathroom to clean out soiled underpants? The answer to this question for me is a tentative yes, but only with regard to a single, minor character, where the movie played the `Aliens' / `The Exorcist' card which put a child at genuine risk, not the supernatural, kinda spooky, kinda neat type of menace of `Poltergeist'. So my score on this point is positive.A second important positive for a horror film is the inventiveness of the threat. `Halloween' scores big on this point with its creative minimalism of a psychopathic stalker with a blank, white mask. This is in strong contrast to a lot of more elaborate scare scenarios done up until `Halloween' was made, whereupon everyone copied John Carpenter's idea. Another prime example among `B' movies is '28 Days Later' which changes the rules about how zombies are expected to act. It doubles its impact by adding a twist to the behavior of a group of survivors which seems to be making a psychological statement not unlike the classic `Lord of the Flies' survivors novel. My favorite example from A list movies is the nature of the threat in `Alien'. The object lesson here is to be sure to hire a great graphic artist when you design your monsters.The seemingly most striking original element of `Saw' is the fact that the perp is not literally killing the victims himself, he is putting them in situations where they do things which leads to their killing themselves, or at least failing to find their way out of a trap before the trap is sprung and they are killed by the environment created by the perp. While this is the element of originality explicit in the movie, this story line may not be quite as original as the authors would have you believe. There is a strong similarity between the fate of the victims in `Saw' and the way in which the murders are done in `Seven'. In both cases, the scenario in which the vics die is connected to perceived past sins. And, the deaths in `Seven' are to some extent a result of the victims' own actions.The truly more original aspect of `Saw' is that it is laid out very much like an adventure video game, where progress or even survival is based on solving puzzles. Clues are doled out by a very stingy puzzle master and they are generally couched in riddles, so we double the fun by making one answer one puzzle to get the clues needed to solve the next puzzle. The frustration in seeing the nested puzzles, yet you are stuck at the first step. Reminds me of the frustration of trying to find my way into the Underground Empire in `Zork I'. I must also say that most of the perils created by the perp win points for originality. These add to the dangers to those among us with weak bowels.The biggest question for the audience is for how long does the filmmaker maintain the suspense for the viewer? The answers to some of the puzzles are evident to the audience long before they dawn on the characters, partly because the producers let the cat out of the bag for at least one major piece of business in their promotional material. The writer did manage to keep the identity of the ultimate perp hidden until the very end of the movie, largely by presenting us with a fairly transparent red herring that kept our attention diverted from the real puzzle master.Weighed against these positives is a rather serious list of negatives beginning with the question of whether the two main characters would really behave as they did in the movie if they were presented with their situation. I think the initial panic is real enough, but I think the writer does not give enough credit to the problem solving abilities of a normally intelligent person, and at least one of the two principals is a highly educated surgeon. I really suspect that with the tools at hand, the two principle vics would have been a lot more clever in being able to free at least one, so he could go get help. As evidence of this, I offer the resolution to a similar problem in Stephen King's novel `Gerald's Game'.If you resolve the improbabilities, you are left with some bad writing for the roles of the police detectives working this case, lead by Danny Glover. The glaring contrast between Glover in this movie and Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman in `Seven' makes my point better than anything else I can say. This is not Glover's fault, except in the fact that he decided to play this weak role to begin with. I am inclined to say that the movie would have been much better if the roles of Glover and his partner had been eliminated or minimized. The movie makers probably felt they needed the detectives' business to have someone to chase perps and take bullets from the potential perp and from booby traps, since the two main characters are trapped inside their own personal dungeon. The cops also introduce scenes from past perp scenes that fill out the way in that our perp works and thinks.The movie does not live up to its hype, but it is worth a good chill.",3,Good Novelties and Surprises.

Adam (Leigh Whannell) is a photographer; Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, The Princess Bride) is a surgeon. Both men have no idea how they ended up in this room together. Nor how a dead body laying between them got there. In the dead body's hands are a gun and a micro-cassette tape player.They soon discover a micro-cassette tape in each of their pockets, and quickly uncover a creepy message that awaits them by their captor. The ""jigsaw"" killer has caught them: a psychopath who doesn't necessarily ""kill"" people, but helps them kill themselves . . . or survive by killing others.**********************************************************************The psychology surrounding the events is sound enough: the slow descent into suspicion of each other, the lack of external stimulation that leads to a decline in mental faculties, and the eventual near insanity that would insue if you found out you had to kill someone in order to save yourself and/or your loved ones. Do they deserve to die anymore than you do?Where this film fell a bit short was in acting and plot. The acting was subpar. Cary Elwes, who I absolutely LOVED in The Princess Bride, here comes off like an amateur (could be that they were pressed for time and money, filming on a budget of $1.2 million and in 18 days). Makenzie Vega, Elwes' wife in the film, was flat, uncharming, and a bore. As were the estimable Danny Glover (Grand Canyon), and Ken Leung (Rush Hour and Red Dragon).There were also enough plot holes to make this film resemble swiss cheese. There was the fact that the main antagonist turns out to be someone who could NEVER have pulled off such cases (mainly because he was deathly ill); Dr. Gordon was allowed to sit and watch the interrogation of a survivor of the Jigsaw Murderer (which NEVER would have happened if, as the film shows us, Dr. Gordon was an initial suspect); the ""game"" that is played out by this killer is given to the captives bit by bit, as if it were a simple video game and all you had to do to survive was to put the pieces together.

The plot still stands out as very original in the crowded vault of &#34;cops track serial killer&#34; movies (yes I know that strictly speaking JIGSAW doesn't actually kill anyone. or does he?). SAW has to be watched closely as every line is important to the plot as little bits of the JIGSAW puzzle fall into place in some of the biggest twists I've seen in a film. The end twist is a whopper and anyone who says they SAW it coming is a lunatic. I'm sure the plot has been fairly well covered in other reviews so I'm not even going to bother.Lots of people will either refuse to watch SAW or will find it too gruesome (It is very gruesome, but no more so than films like SE7EN which seemed to be perfectly acceptable). This is a mistake as all the nasty bits are vital to the plot. It is after all a crime thriller over being a gore/horror.They also manage to squeeze in some humor like when Adam has fished around in a crap filled toilet bowl, he then finds the clue in the cistern and comes out with &#34;Kinda wish I'd looked in there first&#34; which gets a chuckle from his fellow captive, despite their current predicament.So the film is great and the sets are disgusting. The extras on this DVD are alright. There is a music video which I can only assume was released but I'd never heard it before. The song is pretty awful but the video is cool. There is also a short documentary which is pretty good. Amazingly they shot SAW in only a couple of weeks and the idea of having the two actors in the toilet all came about from keeping costs down. Funny as that is the most memorable thing about the whole film, that opening scene. All in all SAW is a must own film for anyone who is into Saws, toilets, feet, games, puppets, deaths & twists.Buy it, watch it, then buy all the other SAWS and then watch them (in order).

One is given the instruction that by a certain time, he must kill the other man or his family will die instead.We soon discover that the scenario is the work of a serial killer known as `Jigsaw,' whose M.O. is to place people in sadistic set pieces from which escape is possible, but at great cost.  Like the killer in SEVEN, Jigsaw is trying to teach a lesson.  He targets individuals who don't seem to appreciate their lives.  But unlike `John Doe's victims, Jigsaw's have a way out available to them, horrific though it might be.  The sole survivor of his traps emerges a changed woman and claims ""he helped me.""  This is an interesting point that I wish had been given more attention.SAW is a gripping, suspenseful and unpredictable thriller while it's running.  It wasn't until I thought about it afterward that I realized it just didn't make sense.  The plot of the film - at best - relies on the remotest of coincidence to play out, while many of its elements don't work altogether.  In the manner of Dario Argento, the filmmakers went for style and effect rather than logic.  I'm willing to overlook it in this case because I was thoroughly entertained for the duration.For the benefit of the timid, it is perhaps worth mentioning that the film is not as grisly as its subject matter and promotional imagery would suggest.The DVD of SAW includes commentary by director James Wan and writer/actor Leigh Wannell.  It is fairly interesting and often funny.  There are two music videos for Fear Factory's ""Bite the Hand That Bleeds You"" - one rated and one unrated.  The rated one is actually better.  The unrated video requires the band and a model to act (badly) while singing the song and is kind of embarassing.  There is a ""making of"" featurette for the unrated video, as well as a very brief one for the film itself.

I'm being completely honest in everything I say here.  I just viewed this earlier today at my local theater and it has to be the biggest letdown for me out of all the movies that I have seen this year.  To me, Saw has a weak and uninteresting plotline with a bunch of horrific actors weaved into it.  Cary Elwes was completely unconvincing in this picture (I've never seen him in others, so I'm only going by his performance here) When the film first started, I wasn't getting into it then, but I decided to wait it out, hoping that things would pick up by mid picture, but sadly to report, it did not.  I wasn't scared at all, I was disinterested.  I was so bored, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater.  I wasn't the only one.  I was the only one left in the theater because everyone was walking out (I never walk out of films, but I REALLY wanted to).  I heard one comment as a dad and his son were exiting: ""this is too long."" I also agree, what was shown here could have been accomplished in less than an hour and forty minutes.  The concept of using Jigsaw to freak people out may work with young kids, but it didn't work with me.  I was completely unaffected by this picture, psychological thriller/horror or whatever genre would be the appropriate placing for this.  I did get the message out of this as some people are stating in their reviews, but did they really have to put it in such an overrated and dreadful film? I think this movie gives psychological thrillers a bad name.  I've seen some exceptionally wonderful films in that genre, including One Hour Photo.  I wouldn't recommend this picture to anyone, rental or otherwise.  I firmly believe it's a big waste of money and time.  It sure was for me, at least.  I had to chuckle to myself when ""game over"" was said-I was counting my lucky stars that I didn't have to sit through that ""game"" any longer. I've never seen any of the movies that this has been compared to (mostly speaking of Seven here) but I'm sure those movies are much better in storyline and acting than this (I honestly doubt it could be worse)",1,"I went, I ""Saw""..I hated.",1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,2225,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'going', 'get', 'share', 'flack', 'others', 'site', 'read', 'review', ""'m"", 'going', 'voice', 'opinion', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'being', 'completely', 'honest', 'everything', 'say', 'here', 'just', 'viewed', 'earlier', 'today', 'local', 'theater', 'be', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'Saw', 'weak', 'uninteresting', 'plotline', 'bunch', 'horrific', 'actors', 'weaved', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'was', 'completely', 'unconvincing', 'picture', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'others', ""'m"", 'only', 'going', 'performance', 'here', 'When', 'film', 'first', 'started', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'then', 'decided', 'wait', 'out', 'hoping', 'things', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'mid', 'picture', 'sadly', 'report', 'did', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'scared', 'was', 'disinterested', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'theater', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'theater', 'everyone', 'was', 'walking', 'out', 'never', 'walk', 'films', 'REALLY', 'wanted', 'heard', 'one', 'comment', 'dad', 'son', 'were', 'exiting', 'too', 'long', 'also', 'agree', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'less', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'concept', 'using', 'Jigsaw', 'freak', 'people', 'out', 'may', 'work', 'young', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'completely', 'unaffected', 'picture', 'psychological', 'thriller/horror', 'genre', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'placing', 'did', 'get', 'message', 'people', 'are', 'stating', 'reviews', 'did', 'really', 'have', 'put', 'such', 'overrated', 'dreadful', 'film', 'think', 'movie', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'bad', 'name', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'exceptionally', 'wonderful', 'films', 'genre', 'including', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'picture', 'anyone', 'rental', 'otherwise', 'firmly', 'believe', 'big', 'waste', 'money', 'time', 'sure', 'was', 'least', 'had', 'chuckle', 'myself', 'when', 'game', 'was', 'said-I', 'was', 'counting', 'lucky', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'sit', 'game', 'longer', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movies', 'been', 'compared', 'mostly', 'speaking', 'Seven', 'here', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movies', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'storyline', 'acting', 'honestly', 'doubt', 'could', 'be', 'worse']",N/A

I had heard all the bad press it got but refused to believe Danny Glover would make a bad movie. My opinion was proven right but his character is a bit obsessed in this movie. He plays one of the cops chasing the Jigsaw Killer. After seeing his partner be murdered, quite brilliantly I might add, he becomes obsessed with finding who the killer is even after being discharged. He is convinced that a man named Lawrence is the killer and stakes his place out. That's all I will say about his character. The movie starts off amazingly well, two men wake up in a room chained to pipes with a dead body in the middle of the room. It progresses rather quickly with Lawrence, a doctor, explaining about a few of the deaths to Adam. It may just be me but I didn't find Cary Elwes' (Lawrence) acting to be very believable at times. Leigh Whannell (Adam), however, was very convincing and made his character very understandable. The plot is about as good as you get in this day-and-age. A cheap rip-off of Seven? Maybe. But this movie is executed very well. It keeps you guessing throughout, even when you think you have everything figured out. The deaths featured in the film are gruesome and extremely raw, a nice visual compared to other movies' deaths. This movie also contains one of the best endings to a psychological/horror movie I have seen, you're jaw will be on the floor. Overall this movie is very enjoyable and doesn't stoop to the cheap scares as you might expect. The horror mounts throughout and is more in the atmosphere of the movie because you know what might happen and you just dread the thought of it. There's not enough movies with that aspect to it anymore, so for that alone, this movie is worth it.

My expectations were that it was going to be nothing more than just another one of those splatter films whose sole aim was to nauseate and repulse the audience.Miracle of miracles, I happened to be wrong. While the gore element is there, for the most part it is an anticipated horror more than an actually realized one (at least by today's standards). For most of the film the terror and dread is psychological in nature and proceeds from an intelligent storyline and a thought-provoking script which dialogues with the audience on such concerns as the nature of life, death and what a person would be willing to do to retain ones life.For me what really makes the film work is the protagonist nicknamed Jigsaw. While his actions are indeed horrific and grotesque his reasoning comes across as rational, his goals subtle and his attention to detail flawless.

873379,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B0006SSOHC,Brian,"[5, 7]","A great many people, it would appear, hold the film ""Saw"" in high regard. It was at the behest of numerous co-workers and friends that I finally ran out with my spouse and snagged a rental of this rather curious title. While I can certainly credit the film for taking a fresh route so completely unorthodox and visually arresting, I still must conclude that I found the whole thing rather lacking.The concept of two people struggling to solve the puzzle of why they were abducted and squared away together with the threat of death looming over their heads could, and should, have been handled with far greater care and intelligence. Having already seen David Fincher's far superior ""Seven,"" I could not bring myself to connect with anything this film had to offer. It was nothing more than a carbon-copy of so many other better films and didn't really seem to have any valid point. I think that is what hurts this film the most, aside from the fact that Danny Glover and Cary Elwes were totally miscast. The writing, in some areas, is so bad that you wonder how the script was ever approved. Key points in the film offer golden opportunities for Glover's character to end Jigsaw's murderous campaign. But he winds up dropping the ball in a manner no real authority figure ever would. The ending is a particular disappointment, because it foolishly leaves the door wide open for a highly unnecessary sequel when it honestly didn't have to.""Saw"" does have a good concept, like I said.

Poor lighting, aparently designed to be ""spooky"", makes some scenes unbearable to watch. I don't know what movie some other reviewers were watching, but it seems we watched diffrent films. I think people were sucked in because the plot and or mystery was not predictable, but a mystery that doesn't make any sense is no mystery, it's a confusing story that shouldn't be told. For a really good mystery the viewer should be given the chance of figuring out the mystery as the story developes. Saw did none of that. There was no way to figure out what was going on or who was doing it while the story was unfolding. Stay away from this movie (a series now that Saw2 is out).

He is not exactly a murderer because he traps people in rooms and lets them play a game of life and death. If you don't complete the game or fail in anyway, you die. If you do the task sucessfully, you earn your life. So therefore, the victims kill themselves. The reason behind these awful games is to teach the meaning and value of life. That you cannot take advantage of it and must live life to the fullest and with meaning.In saw, there are two men and they are locked in a room and they have to kill each other within a certain time limit. There are two saws for them. The saws aren't used and too weak to cut their shackles off their feet but has the ability to cut flesh.They are surveilanced by Jigsaw. however, the story does not just lie within the walls of the men's death chamber but there are flash backs to the past. Here we learn the characters and their personalities. and with it, comes the horror of Jigsaw and his horrific (but inventive) turture games.This movie is very creepy. Especially with Jigsaw's evil mask. His 'fight for survival' games are nail bitting and smart.Flash backs let us learn the characters and why they deserved this fate. Blood, and guts are kept to their medium. There are no pathetic and over-exaggerated fountains of blood flowwing everywhere. but gore is only used when it is truly needed. Too much can be unrealistic, James Wan has done a good job of a good horror story.Saw is a very smart Horror movie. James wan is (evily) inventive with jigsaw's death games. He makes us experience the horror but also the emotion towards this. However, James Wan's youth can get the better of him. The two males actors who are stuck in the chamber sometimes can make you cringe because sometimes, their acting can be too overdone and extreamly unrealistic. Where emotions are at their peak, the two men's acting become horrible and we get pulled way from it start to look around and think:""Its a movie"". I hoped for better acting to make this film 5 stars but I gave it 4.. for the acting.but in summary, its a great film. Horror is a hard genre to please.. it HAS to be scary or else we rethink your spending on the movie ticket. James wan's movie is not only scary, its an intellegent one as well.Saw 2 is comming out.

From the get-go, ""Saw"" is a disturbing game of master and servant as ""the Jigsaw Killer"" rounds-up disenchanted individuals and makes them pay for their own carelessness. A man who tried to take his own life by slicing his wrist was forced to decide on whether to die in a cell or navigate a path through barbed wire to reach the exit to freedom. A sort of test for these people who've previously made horrible choices in their life. Even the female early on in the movie who managed to get away from the killer (via succeeding in HER game) said that the experience changed her for the better.A twisted vigilante for sure, but the evil lead doesn't tug on anyone's sympathies for long as ""Adam"" and ""Lawrence"" are forced to work together (yet against each other) to stay alive.While the acting amongst all characters isn't exactly Oscar-quality, you can't go into the movie thinking that's what's to be expected. This is an extraordinarily unique movie and should be treated as a morbid look at the human condition in times of stress and life/death. As well, the creepy games (like the one Mr. Suicide played above) that the victims must play in order to live are creative and compelling.Fans of Rockstar Games' ""Manhunt"" should enjoy ""Saw"" immensely, by the way. The Jigsaw Killer and the Director from said game are very similar in approach and technique.Do not, however, be fooled by the grisly imagery of the DVD cover or any other mediums used to advertise the movie.

But if you're looking for Saw to be something beyond simply a creepy idea, you'll probably be disappointed.The performances turned in by both lead actors are downright bad. Leigh Wannell, who co-wrote the script, should probably stick to writing as he fails to bring any real life to his character. Cary Elwes, who's been enjoyable when cast in lighter fare just can't pull off the level of emotion needed. His cries of ""Allie? Allie!?"" should be gut wrenching. Well, they are, but for all the wrong reasons.The film's twist ending is...well, interesting.

""It was like `Se7en' but not as good.""`Saw' is only similar to `Se7en' in that they fall into the same genre of Serial Killer Thriller. But plot wise I'd compare it closer to `Usual Suspects.' Both stories are non linear. The plots are told from different points of view and through flashbacks, creating a very complex edge of your seat thriller.The plot: As you may already know, `Saw' begins with a GREAT narrative hook about two men, Lawrence and Adam whom wake up in a cellar bathroom chained to pipes. The men must think back to how they could possibly end up in such a predicament.The rest of the story is told by the men looking through their surroundings and finding objects their tormentor has left for them. Key words, and objects that end up taking shape in some way.The plot is also told via flashbacks by Lawrence. He remembers being a person of interest in the ""Jigsaw"" killings, in which the people were tormented in truly sick and original ways. (`Se7en') The police detective (Danny Glover) uncovered an extramarital affair by Lawrence but cleared him of the killings, and left both Lawrence and Glover totally perplexed as to why the Jigsaw killings took place or why the victims were chosen.This is the first hour of `Saw' and it's great. Chilling, well acted, and most importantly keeps you on the edge of your seat dying to know what will happen next.The last third of `Saw' goes WAY down the drain with new narrative hooks which have no objective or conclusion. Next we see Lawrence's wife (Monica Potter) and daughter held hostage at gunpoint in their apartment. We see Danny Glover go from hero cop to revenge driven nut after the death of his partner.Where was `Saw' going with these new narrative hooks? Nowhere! Sad to say but `Saw' ends with no conclusion as to whom lives or dies or what motives our characters had.The most infuriating thing about `Saw' is how after so much originality, it attempts to wrap things up with old cheesy movie formulas. Characters that kill each other by struggling for a gun and shooting themselves at the same time, and cops with guns so stupid as to not call for backup and then get close enough to the killer so that he can pull a knife.Spoiler Warning! Another pathetic last minute narrative hook is Adam's revelation that he knows Lawrence and was hired to follow him, and knows whom hired him. Not only does this blow the premise that Lawrence and Adam were strangers but shouldn't he have mentioned that right away?Spoiler Warning! Who lives or dies? Having argued with fans there seems to be some dispute. I conclude that if Lawrence lives so must Adam, because if Lawrence is able to successfully hop away, the police will return to the scene of the crime and rescue Adam. The Jigsaw killer locking him in the room is pointless since Adam will be rescued and he now knows the killer's identity.",3,The Flaw of `Saw',1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,2918,"['Ask', 'anyone', 'Saw', ""'ll"", 'get', 'same', 'answer', 'was', 'Se7en', 'not', 'good', 'Saw', 'only', 'similar', 'Se7en', 'fall', 'same', 'genre', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'Thriller', 'plot', 'wise', ""'d"", 'compare', 'closer', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'stories', 'are', 'non', 'linear', 'plots', 'are', 'told', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'flashbacks', 'creating', 'very', 'complex', 'edge', 'seat', 'thriller.The', 'plot', 'may', 'already', 'know', 'Saw', 'begins', 'GREAT', 'narrative', 'hook', 'two', 'men', 'Lawrence', 'Adam', 'whom', 'wake', 'up', 'cellar', 'bathroom', 'chained', 'pipes', 'men', 'must', 'think', 'back', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'end', 'up', 'such', 'predicament.The', 'rest', 'story', 'told', 'men', 'looking', 'surroundings', 'finding', 'objects', 'tormentor', 'left', 'Key', 'words', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'shape', 'way.The', 'plot', 'also', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'Lawrence', 'being', 'person', 'interest', 'Jigsaw', 'killings', 'people', 'were', 'tormented', 'truly', 'sick', 'original', 'ways', 'Se7en', 'police', 'detective', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'uncovered', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'Lawrence', 'cleared', 'killings', 'left', 'Lawrence', 'Glover', 'totally', 'perplexed', 'why', 'Jigsaw', 'killings', 'took', 'place', 'why', 'victims', 'were', 'chosen.This', 'first', 'hour', 'Saw', 'great', 'Chilling', 'well', 'acted', 'most', 'importantly', 'edge', 'seat', 'dying', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next.The', 'last', 'third', 'Saw', 'WAY', 'drain', 'new', 'narrative', 'hooks', 'have', 'objective', 'conclusion', 'Next', 'see', 'Lawrence', 'wife', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'daughter', 'held', 'hostage', 'gunpoint', 'apartment', 'see', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'go', 'hero', 'cop', 'revenge', 'driven', 'nut', 'death', 'partner.Where', 'was', 'Saw', 'going', 'new', 'narrative', 'hooks', 'Nowhere', 'Sad', 'say', 'Saw', 'conclusion', 'whom', 'lives', 'dies', 'what', 'characters', 'had.The', 'most', 'infuriating', 'thing', 'Saw', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'originality', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'old', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'formulas', 'Characters', 'kill', 'other', 'struggling', 'gun', 'shooting', 'same', 'time', 'cops', 'guns', 'so', 'stupid', 'not', 'call', 'backup', 'then', 'get', 'close', 'enough', 'killer', 'so', 'can', 'pull', 'knife.Spoiler', 'Warning', 'pathetic', 'last', 'minute', 'narrative', 'hook', 'Adam', 'revelation', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'hired', 'follow', 'whom', 'hired', 'Not', 'only', 'blow', 'premise', 'Lawrence', 'Adam', 'were', 'strangers', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'mentioned', 'right', 'away', 'Spoiler', 'Warning', 'Who', 'dies', 'Having', 'argued', 'fans', 'there', 'be', 'dispute', 'conclude', 'Lawrence', 'so', 'must', 'Adam', 'Lawrence', 'able', 'successfully', 'hop', 'away', 'police', 'will', 'return', 'scene', 'crime', 'rescue', 'Adam', 'Jigsaw', 'killer', 'locking', 'room', 'pointless', 'Adam', 'will', 'be', 'rescued', 'now', 'killer', 'identity']",N/A

Two men wake up in an obscure prison cell, one a doctor, the other a photographer. They are chained up, with no obvious chance to escape. They are a piece in the ""Jigsaw"" puzzle. They are part of a brutal ""killer's"" game, and they must find a way to win, and find out who plays the main role in their mysterious and vomit-inducing inprisonment.""Saw"" succeeds on almost every level. It is gruesome, tense, and atmospherically terrifying. I cannot say enough good about this movie-you have to see it to believe it. No pathetically played-out jump scenes here. This is straight suspense, and everything you think is something IS something.Graphically nauseating, ""Saw"" manages to make its viewers terrified, but mostly intensely uncomfortable. Watching the Jigsaw's victims kill themself in trying to save themself is incredibly unpleasent and left me shaking.

I almost refused to watch it thinking it was just another gorey, plotless, no-story, let's try to scare some people, worthless movie. But then I watched it. I was shocked. I will say that this movie was brilliant. Aside from subpar acting performances, this movie was excellent.Now, this and SE7EN are very different movies but I will say that Saw was very comparible to that film. It's a look inside the mind of a psychopathic killer who believes they've got it all figured out and is trying to prove a point through these ""situations"" he is putting people in, who, in turn are to attempt the save their own lives by doing something quite desperate and abnormal. I grow tired of movies that serve no purpose but to try to scare, ex. The Ring, The Grudge, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. They make little sense, loose ends are rarely tied together, the plot is generally insignificant. But this was different. The story really keeps you thinking, and you stay on the edge throughout the movie.What I really liked about this movie was something the director accomplished that most try to do but few can succeed. He makes you believe that you've got it all figured out (on a few occasions), and everything is coming together just like you predicted, and BAM, the ending throws it all right back in your face. All I could do at the end of this movie was smile and say ""Bravo"" and give it a good clap. It was brilliant.I do have a few qualms though bringing it down to a 4 star. They are: acting...questionable. I guess that is because I'm not sure I've seen Kary Elwes in a serious role like this one, I mean, look at his resume: Robin Hood Men in Tights, Hot Shots, The Princess Bride (excellent movie), etc. It was kind of like placing Leslie Nielson in...I don't know...The Patriot as General Cornwallace? You get the picture. There was something else I thought was strange but effective. There is a car chase scene where the camera jumps around and is sped up and the drivers are both kinda crazy...it all came off kinda goofy to me, not too big a deal though.In all, if you think this is another ""scare"" movie, it's not.

873400,A95SF04RX9G8,B0006SSOHC,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[2, 3]","Why? That is my question. Why did they have to take a perfectly good horror film and tack on an arbitrary twist at the end that negates everything that went before it. Why? Saw had so much promise all throughout, and, if done right, the ending could have tied it all together and really delivered a message, but instead, the ending essentially throws everything out the window in favor of tricking the audience. Sure, all of the self-contained plot elements might make sense, but the resolution completely ignores all logical character motivations. This is not to say that Saw isn't a disturbingly scary movie for most of its length, but, jeez, why?The film opens in a disgusting bathroom that you can almost smell through the screen, where Adam (Leigh Whannell, who also wrote the screenplay) and Lawrence (Cary Elwes) wake up to find themselves chained at the foot on opposite sides of the room, and, oh, there's a dead man lying in between them. They quickly intuit that this is not good, and Lawrence, a doctor, conveniently has a good idea of who has captured them here, because he was once a suspect. It seems there is a serial killer on the loose, but this killer does not technically do any killing himself; he cleverly finds ways to allow his prey to kill themselves.And so the killer has given Lawrence an ultimatum: kill Adam before six o'clock, or the doctor's wife and young daughter will be killed. The killer has left certain objects in strategic places for the two of them to discover and use as they will, including a jigsaw for each of them--not to cut off their chains, mind you, but rather their feet. Obviously both of them are freaked out. Along the way, we get some flashbacks involving Detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung) in pursuit of the killer. And there we have the setup: will Lawrence and Adam find a way to escape to save the lives of loved ones, or will Lawrence give in and kill Adam first? After all, he's got all the tools he needs at his disposal. But, wait, why are they there in the first place? And who is this killer who has brought them here?A film like Saw is more frustrating than your average run-of-the-mill bad horror movie, which is not to say that this is a bad horror movie; in fact, it's quite good. A bad horror movie is preposterous from the first frame to the last, and believe me, there are more of these kinds of movies than the world needs. However, Saw gives us an entirely credible premise, and fills it with just enough elements to keep our heads from spinning off, but then takes a horrible wrong turn and the wheels come flying off, leaving some viewers to think it's a brilliant twist that brings everything together when really it's a cop out, and offers nothing deeper than a ""gotcha!"" moment.Director James Wan has infused the film with a lot of style, using washed-out colors and quick edits to give it a gritty look and keep the suspense factor high. He also succeeds in using psychological suspense rather than monsters and one-off spooks. There are some truly terrifying moments where you know something bad is going to go down, but you don't know the what, when or who.

When it was released and I saw it in the theater, I was really glad it lived up to the buzz.The story is about a very unusual serial killer who places his victims in situations where they might die, unless they figure out the way to save themselves.  The killer never actually commits the acts that cause the deaths of these people, an interesting premise in an of itself.  His latest victims are two men chained at opposite ends of a large washroom...with a dead body in between them.  One must shoot the other in order to save his family within an 8 hour period.  Their chains prevent alot of movement, but they have each been given a saw...not strong enough to cut through chains, but can penetrate bone.  Do you remove a limb and kill another stranger?The story, as I said, is a great premise, and for novice filmmakers, it plays much better than most first-time efforts.

873406,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0006SSOHC,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 2]","Watching Saw, there's a feeling that this film could've been great but it never quite gets there and I can't seem to figure it out. Sure the acting is a little rough but it's a horror movie, not an Oscar contender. The film loses steam halfway through only to pick up at the end so it's not a thrill ride from beginning to end. It's got incredibly fast editing with a jerky image at times so it's obviously trying to make things more exciting than it needs too. But in the end it's a pretty satisfying film if you let it.The film opens with an odd idea: 2 men are chained up on opposite ends of a really dank and decrepit bathroom. In the middle is a guy with a gunshot wound in his head, a gun in one hand, a tape recorder in the other. After some searching they find out why they're there: a killer nicknamed Jigsaw put them there and wants one of them to kill the other or his wife and daughter will die. There's clues all around them to get out, including tools for one method that's quite grisly.You can tell there's a certain enthusiasm with this: the film doesn't have a sense of an obvious independent film as it's smartly written and has quite an ending(although it probably won't make sense). There is some gore in the film but it's not outright gory except for a few shots. In fact, except for those certain shots it's kind of tame at times. The unrated adds some extra footage but I honestly couldn't figure out where the new stuff was.Acting wise well..., don't forget that this is an independent film shot incredibly quickly so there's bound to be some performances that are kinda eek. The writing's pretty sharp although at times it's quite illogical. Pretty soon a character's like ""wait a minute, I know this!"" to actually explaining certain obvious parts. But all the clues and hidden things are clever but like I said, some are kind of like ""well he figured that out pretty quickly"".Like the other big Sundance film Blair Witch Project, it's a film that seemed refreshing and well-liked despite its flaws.

Also appearing is Danny Glover (Grand Canyon, Gone Fishin'), Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers - she was the redhead who got topless in the group shower), Ken Leung (Vanilla Sky), Shawnee Smith, whom many may recognize from television's Becker as the dumb as a brick character of Linda, and cute as a button Monica Potter (Along Came a Spider).The movie opens, oddly enough, in my bathroom, or, at least a very good facsimile...it's dark, dank, slimy, dirty, gritty, moldy, and generally funkified, as my good friend Robbie Van Winkle used to say, to the extreme.  As the florescent lights come to life, we see three men, two alive, one dead (I'm assuming this as he was laying face down on the icky tile in a pool of his own blood with a ginormous hole in the back of his head).  The two remaining men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes) and Adam (Whannell), find themselves not only wondering how they came to be in such a place, but why they are shackled by the ankle to large pipes, each at opposite ends of the room.  Some answers are found on cassette tapes found in their respective pockets (the dead man in the middle of the room had a player) in that of a raspy voice and various clues that indicate the survival of the two men, among others, depends on their having to perform some unusual acts (two men in a bathroom performing unusual acts?  No, this isn't a George Michael video...).  The question soon becomes one of what someone would be willing to do to stay alive, and the answers may shock you...The general opinion for Saw seems clearly divided, and I can see both sides...but I enjoyed this nasty little movie, for what it was...so many have already compared it to (or claimed it ripped off) the popular film Se7en, so it must be true, but I found myself likening the tone of the film to the ambiguously dark and disturbing videos released by the band Tool in the 90's (I think they're still performing, but with a slightly different line up).  I think most agree the acting in Saw isn't the best, Cary Elwes' performance the most flawed, and there's a good many plot holes, but I think the good outweighed the bad, and the end result was favorable.  I was a little disappointed that Glover and Potter's roles weren't more substantial, but the upside was the story moved at a brisk pace.  The movie had a really strong opening, and kept me interested throughout, although it did sort of peter out as it went along...I will say that not once did I look at the running time left to figure out how much more I had to sit through (I'll do this often with films that bore me).  Did I find the movie scary?  Not really, but it was tense, unsettling, and definitely creepy.  I like how things unfolded, as the audience starts out knowing exactly what the main characters do, which is very little, and then revelations present themselves, but even as we become more informed (more so than the main characters), what are we to believe?  One or two of these elements were easy to discern as a means to throw us off (especially those regarding the identity of the mysterious Jigsaw killer, as he was named), but for the most part, I found myself second-guessing my theories.  The sets for the film so clearly fit the dark nature of the material, especially the dilapidated bathroom where a majority of the story took place.  My favorite scene involved Adam, learning from a clue that there may be something of use in the toilet, reaching into the thick, brown, water in the bowl...I dunno about you, but I would've checked the tank first, as I think most know the best place to hide something in a toilet would be the tank, and not the bowl... Dr, Gordon then asks, ""Find anything?"", to which Adam replies, ""Nothing solid..."" Hee hee...he then realizes it's the tank he should be looking in, and admonishes himself appropriately.  No, this isn't a comedy, but it does have a few humorous moments that were integrated nicely to enhance an overall sense of realism.  I wouldn't call this a straight up horror film, but more of a crime thriller with horror elements.  The main element that really intrigued me was the idea of placing people in situations where they have the choice of doing nothing and dying, or doing something really dangerous and quite possibly lethal (to themselves or others) for the remote chance of surviving (You know, if the producers of that Fear Factor show had any cajones, they would more closely model their show on this concept...it'd be a ratings bonanza).  In the end, looking at the film for what it is, an inexpensive (under 2 mil, I think), quickly shot (18 days), glossy initial outing, I'd say it turned out very well, and is worth checking out for a few thrills.The anamorphic widescreen print looks great, with matching audio.  Special features include a short featurette titled `Sawed Off), rated and unrated version of the Cold Play video `Bite the Hand That Bleeds You', trailers and TV spots, a poster gallery, a commentary track with Wan and Whannell, and a cool, transparent case with an artwork overlay.Cookieman108By the way, if you dug this cinematic nugget, be on the lookout for the sequel, aptly titled Saw II,

It just seems that no matter how hard they try, movie execs can't seem to release a decent horror film, something gritty and disturbing and downright horrifying.  They just can't do it.And then there was Saw.This movie is amazing in the fact that it breaks down to a simple formula of twists and thrills, bypasses the special effects and CGI crap that pollutes too many scary movies these days and focuses on something that could take place, something that could really happen versus the faux thrills expidited by cheap ghost storys and sci-fi.  This is the type of movie that will leave you disturbed long after you watch it.  You'll think about it a week, two weeks, a month later while you lay awake and wonder if there really is a man that sick and twisted...Yes...He is out there...So by now EVERYONE knows the premise.  Two men wake up in a nasty restroom chained to oposite ends and theres a dead man in the center of the room.  They both have choices to make, clues to unravel in order to make it out alive.That's all I'm going to tell you...Trust me, if you haven't seen Saw by now you need to watch this movie.

873415,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B0006SSOHC,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[3, 4]","Oh, what this movie could have been.  I don't think the directing or acting was that bad.  But the script was too generic.  A little research was needed.  Let me explain:#1. A doctor would never say he had been electrocuted because he knows what the word means!  It means you are dead.  The average person does say that when they are shocked; doctors NEVER do, ever.#2. Why would the good doctor use the saw (removing...well, I don't want to give anything away)when he could have used his shirt to reach the cell phone on the floor?#3.  The twist of the movie is not really a twist at all.  I don't want to give away the plot, but it doesn't hold up as being a ""Wow, I never would have guessed that?"" movie - if that is really what the author was shooting for.  The viewer was not given enough information to make the shock value come out.#4.  The detectives would have discussed the ""other"" evidence in the case: hundreds of feet of razor-wire, timing devices, the safe, the candles, etc.  Why did none of this material lead them to a purchase location?  This needed to be explained, because there has never been a killer, in the history of killers, who has left so much material behind.  He had to buy or steal this stuff from some place.  And some of the material was so unique, like the contraption he strapped to the one woman's head, that they would have to be able to trace the origins.#5  I was sickened by another film where a person who has just been terrorized by an EVIL person doesn't pull the trigger when the tables turn.  I've seen thirty years of that ridiculous scenario.  When will Hollywood learn how dumb that is.  I would have shot the guy in the forehead until his brains became artwork on the carpet.Okay, all that said, the movie did have some good acting and some really creepy scenes.

Cary Elwes also chimes in a great performance especially at the end.  Danny Glover adds to the cast as a cop pursuing the killer.  the cast is amazing and supports the story well and director James Wan has written a great psycodrama of a movie.i would also like to address the reviewer Rosa La Luna who said that the movie Cube was ""far superior"".  Cube was a great move but comparing these two movies is like comparing apples and oranges.  Cube was not scary at all, and i doubt it wa smeant to be.  there was not one moment was i scared, curious how it ends but never was i scared like i was in Saw.

873417,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0006SSOHC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","Simply put, Saw is the best horror movie I've seen in years.  I know some people don't seem to like it, but this horror fan is just wallowing in the bloody effectiveness of this extremely dark, intelligent, gory masterpiece of a film.  It's such a thrill to see something certifiably different make its way to movie screens; these days, Hollywood horror filmmakers have gotten so lazy that they can't even make sequels of films - instead, they just remake old horror films that don't need remaking.  Frankly, I'm a little tired of watching teenagers get slashed up in the woods by rednecks and inbred mutants.  I want something new, something fresh, something bold, something ruthless in its execution, something that engages my intellect while assaulting my senses.  Saw fits the bill perfectly.As Saw moves toward its gory denouement, it unleashes a number of great surprises, and the ending is well-nigh perfect - I certainly didn't see it coming.  You may think you know what is going on, but I'll wager that you'll be mistaken.  Best of all, there's no deus ex machina plot device to ruin everything - i.e., as surprising as the final revelations are, everything comes together in a heartbeat to make perfect sense.  I really can't say enough about the script put together by Leigh Wannell and James Wan - it's bloody brilliant.  I love this movie.The Bad Man in Saw is downright sadistic; rather than merely hunt his victims down and kill them himself, he creates elaborate ""games"" that lead to painful deaths brought about by the participants themselves.  He chooses his victims carefully, selecting only those who are guilty of some ""crime"" or indiscretion that he feels should no longer go unpunished (and when one former victim won the game, he did in fact let her go - and in one twisted sense, she was better off as a result of having played the game).  The particular game at the centerpiece of the film (which is actually rather mundane compared to some of the killer's previous ones) pits two men together in a filthy underground room and challenges one player to kill the other within a certain time limit if he wants to keep his wife and daughter alive.  That would be Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes); his partner in torturous suffering is a young fellow named Adam (Leigh Wannell).  Both of them wake up in this room without knowing where they are or how they got there.  Our imaginative dark lord of sadism provides the two with some hidden clues and ""tools"" that do much to keep things really interesting.  Did I mention both men are chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room, and that there's a bloody dead guy lying in the middle of the floor?  Oh, how I wish I could tell you more about what happens, but I wouldn't dare deprive any Saw virgins out there from truly enjoying this magnificent film.I must admit that I expected to see nothing but gore in this movie - mindless, bloody gore.  Certainly, there's gore all over the place, but this is the exact opposite of a mindless thriller.

873419,A2GYX971VETQBV,B0006SSOHC,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[1, 5]","SAW is a good thriller: a film with a lot of potential, but lacking in follow-through.  On the one hand, the premise is very cool.  Two men wake up in a bathroom, chained to piping, completely unaware of where they are or why.  As the film progresses, these two men start to piece together their situation: they have been planted in this situation by a deranged madman, someone who enjoys placing his victims in life-or-death situations and forcing them to make horrific decisions.  It's a marvelous setup and the surprising conclusion is right on target and thrilling.Unfortunately, the film reeks of a small budget.  The acting, in particular, is quite poor.  Unlike SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SAW fails to explore its characters.  Instead, the madman's device becomes the center of the entire film and our poor actors get to scream and cry their way through 100 minutes.  Moreover, our madman is portrayed as a deranged person, complete with a secret lair and everything.  Unfortunately, we don't come any closer to understanding him by the end of the film than we did at the start.  He appears to be ""teaching"" his victims a moral lesson, but what that lesson is in his mind is completely obtuse.  Both SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS also have clever plot devices, deranged madmen, and the like.  But unlike SAW, they decide to spend most of their time revealing their characters instead of merely relying on the plot devices.  The result is a much more engaging, interesting, and ultimately satisfying thriller.  It may seem like a strange thing to say, but exploring the haunted games of a madman is not nearly as creepy as exploring the haunted depths of a madman's mind.In the end, SAW has a really cool plot device on its hand, but lacks the heart and complexity of other thrillers.  It's definitely worth a look and will thrill anyone who loves this genre.

873421,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B0006SSOHC,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[3, 8]","When you awake it is so dark you can taste it.You swim up through the darkness, struggling fitfully out of sleep, strangling, lungs clotted with the choking darkness, close around you and pressing down on your chest. You struggle out of one nightmare to awake in another: you're not in your own bed. The darkness is total: the stink of death rancid in your nostrils. You're on a cold, wet tile floor, but beyond that you can't see anything, can't find your way in the ink-black dark that covers you. You panic: your breath is fast and ragged, you whimper and cry out.Now: most nightmares are the worst when the lights are out; when the lights come on, you're snug, cuddled beneath the blanket of Normalcy and the Everyday. In ""Saw"", the nightmare begins when the lights come on.By now, everyone knows the legendary set-up of the deliciously sick piece of celluloid that is ""Saw"": Adam (screenwriter Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes, playing a guy named ""Lawrence"" if ever there was one) awake chained to pipes across from each other in a filthy industrial utility room. In the middle of this abbatoir lies the corpse of a man, face down in his own blood, a .38 revolver clamped in his dead hand. Their true whereabouts? Unknown. How they came there? Unknown. The someone---or something---that delivered them to such a state?Unknown.""Saw"" might pass itself off as a horror movie, but the fact is that this engine of death and destruction is a flick with more on its mind than splatter. This is a film about Crime and Punishment.In our enlightened age, we kill our killers with lethal injection. Think of that: those who kill children and bury them alive, hack the limbs off antique pensioners, those who scar and murder and rape and mutilate and defile---all of them are sent out of this vale of tears in a state of peaceful, drug-addled slumber. Some of you---myself included---would say this is a travesty: even the Death Penalty in our enfeebled land is hardly a true punishment tailored to the brutalities perpetrated by the worst of the worst.Well, then, rejoice in ""Saw"", for the killer---the man, or Creature, or being, or darksome thing that lurks behind the name and mask of the Jigsaw Killer---feels as we do: he is a believer in Justice. He is a believe in the ultimate Talmudic rite: let the Punishment fit the Crime.Dr. Gordon and Adam find their respective instructions, left on a tape muffled and distorted but wickedly clear: they have eight hours. Eight hours to kill the other man, to cut him down like a dog, to find the key, to escape the deathhouse, this charnel sewer. Eight hours: Fail, and for Adam, it is Death. For Dr. Gordon, it is death---and the death of Family as well (Mackenzie Vega and Monica Potter, both carrying their weight admirably).""Saw"" is a brilliant little piece of terror, perfectly economical, remarkably efficient at terrorizing its audience. It is more so for being entirely unpredictable: I found ""Saw"" to be the cinematic equivalent of drinking Scotch on the porch, outside, on a summer night: lifting the tumbler to your lips, only to find your mouth millimeters away from a fat, bloated, dying Black Widow spider, contorted with her death throes, larger than a piece of ice, floating, seething, dying in your drink.I have never seen a film---outside ""The Blair Witch Project""---so dependent on light and dark to evoke a mood. I have never seen a film so entirely capable and competent at conjuring up a mood of isolation, of wicked machination, of brutal death, solely by its use of light and dark. ""Saw"" immerses you in a charnel house sunk deep within the ground, well stocked with clues---indeed, whatever you think of this monster called the Jigsaw Killer, you must at least acknowledge his willingness to provide his victims with the means to their salvation.Watch ""Saw"" in the dark, all the lights off, preferably with a storm howling and pounding outside the window. For ""Saw"" is only slightly a serial killer movie: it tips its hat to ""Se7en"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"", but its dark, wicked, brutal art is born from far more truly from the monster movie. ""Saw"" is about a monster: a creature that crawls, writhes, plots, engineers, from the shadows.Director James Wan has pulled off what, by my lights, is the perfect horror movie: compactly edited, brutally effective, happy to spill blood in the service of its message, consumingly efficient and economic. If there is a scarier device in cinema than a puppet rolled out on a tricycle to gibber in the dark, I have yet to see it. Wan and Director of Photography David Armstrong use dark and light to evoke claustrophobia, fear's aphrodisiac, and spike the mixture with psychedelic images of horror and death.The acting throughout is solid and compelling. Much has been said about Elwes's overracting---but as you watch ""Saw"", you realize this is a film about surfaces, and the darkness, and lies, and deception that lies beneath. Yes, Dr. Gordon is over the top---and he has a reason to be. Elwes and Whannel carry their roles like champs, right down to the point where those rusty hacksaws become one-way tickets to the bright land of Normalcy. Danny Glover (Detective Tapp)pounds out the most engaging, riveting performance of his career, as a defrocked detective who can't let go.""Saw"" is a brutal, seedy, seething charnel-house of death and truth. Yes, yes---""Live or Die, make your Choice""---but if Jim Morrison was right about no one here getting out alive, how much of a choice do we have?JSG",5,Riddles in the Dark,1125532800,"09 1,

Only, instead of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, let's see if we can't get Cary Elwes and Danny Glover, both of whom are available for a slice of pie. Also, let's take the taut, inexorable logic of the original and turn it on its head... sorry, DROP it on its head, removing all wit and sense. Throw in a puppet and a dirty bathroom and BAM!

The director throws you into things in media res with Elwes and Some Dude awakening to their surprise in the aforementioned toilette, chained to some pipes that are probably non-functional, but sufficiently atmospheric in a Godsmack video kind of way. Naturally, questions abound. How did they get here? What diabolical madman would do such a thing? How come there's no toilet paper?

A killer who kidnaps victims to play his murderous games._ReviEw-It's the halloween weekend, folks (to this review date) , and you know what that means: candies, pumpkins, little kids in $8-costumes to disturb the neighbors for sugary treats, and alcoholic parties for hopeless teenagers.  Oh yeah, and crapload of atrocious new horror films to arrive out of the dark horizon.  However, there is a movie that's NOT so atrocious, which is ""Saw"", a disturbing film that has actually creep me out...in enthusiasm.  This movie may have a lot of blood and gore, but does it have the bones and brains to make it functional and apprehensive?Adam (Leigh Whannell) wakes up in a dark room, right from the get-go of this movie.  The room lights up, and realizes he's in a broken lavatory with Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) from the opposite side; both are constrained from their left leg being chained to exterior pipelines.  It freaks them out when both saw a special ""guest"" in the middle of the room, lying on a floor, with a gun on his hand, DEAD FROM A GUNSHOT WOUND IN THE HEAD!  (Suicide perhaps?)  Confined in a loo + Bloody Corpse = Panic!  After a good few minutes of normal psycho-hysteria, they found a tape in their pockets.  Each listened to tape from the recorder they grabbed from the dead guy, and it was spoken by The Jigsaw, a psychopath responsible for kidnapping three people to play in his sick little game; only one survived in one of his lethal challenges.  The Jigsaw has one game objective for one of these new victims: Dr. Gordon must either kill Adam before 6:00 PM, or face the murder of his wife and daughter, and both he and Adam with stay in that room until they both rot like turds.Both are in the worst-case scenario, even worse for Adam, since he's the target of the game, but nothing calms them down more than a flashback.  Dr. Gordon explains how he was a suspect in the Jigsaw investigation, run by two detectives (one of which is Danny Glover), and reminded himself how he got caught by the psycho, which later came to Adam's mind as well.  But reminiscing isn't exactly gonna help them in their situation.  From then on, it's all about them figuring out how to fool The Jigsaw's cynical game.  For the viewers who thinks they know ""Saw's"" whole story by its official website and trailers, unless you visit to various message boards, YOU HAVE SEEN NOTHING YET!  Believe me.""Saw"" is, by far, one of the bloodiest films I've seen in a long time.  Granted, I didn't vomit from the horrific scenes, but for those that have weak stomachs may not enjoy this film so much.  It has scenes of gratuitous violence, like in one scene where the female survivor stabbed a guy's stomach to get something from the inside, showing nothing but intestines.  The movie gets the right idea to depict the grueling details of some grotesque images; however, I admit that it also means that the movie is too reliant on the gross and gore factor, so the movie may not scare people as much as it sickens them.  There are highlights in this movie that may bring people chills, like in the scene where the ""Killer"", when he kidnapped Doc's family, is using a stethoscope on a little girl heart and listen to her heart beating faster and faster when he points a gun in her mother's head.  That was one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in all films of its type.Coming from a developing company called ""Twisted Pictures"", they sure know how the follow the company's name right for having the atmosphere of ""Saw"" to be just that: twisted; not to mention creepy and dark.  The movie excels for having that visual feel of disturbance, which kind of act it as a semi-""Silent Hill"" movie.  And it doesn't hurt for it to be a little snuff-ish by using over-the-top acting.  Their casts wasn't bad, although Cary and Leigh being hysterical can have people laugh hysterical.  As a horror movie, this was amazing.  But ""Saw"" was meant to be primarily as a thriller, which leads to some problems.  There are some plot devices (the which I can't spoil) that weren't quite put together, which makes this movie incoherent.  I felt the first half of the movie had a spastic pace, and ""Saw"" never really explain The Jigsaw's motivation behind his games.  Plus, the movie might make you nauseous by its camera effects.ThE FinAL WoRD| Gritty.  ""Saw""  can't beat ""Se7en"", but it wasn't trying to.  I kind of see this movie as a two-hour episode of ""Tales from the Crypt"", which fits the description of this movie: dreadful, unpredictable, and no hope.

873434,AFTEDMW813PAW,B0006SSOHC,D. Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;,"[0, 0]","From an admittedly gruesome but purely artistic viewpoint, this first Saw movie is the only 5 star and by far the best film of the series.  Sure, the premise is a bit far-fetched and unlikely, but a good movie can ask you to believe the unbelievable, if it's well made.  If movies did nothing more than reflect our everyday mundane lives, there would be no reason to escape to the theater to bury ourselves in fantasy.  But if that fantasy just so happens to include a little carnage and gratuitous violence to the point of inducing just the tiniest bit of innocent nausea, then grab a barf bag, smile and enjoy it!  I'm exaggerating now.  I'll spare the synopsis I'm sure you've seen about the two men chained to filthy bathroom pipes with a violent suicide victim between them.  Instead, I'll focus on what makes this a brilliant movie.  There is an actual premise to this movie, and an actual psychology as well.  It's difficult to imagine the main antagonist in this work, Jigsaw, could have the financial or mental (or any other necessary) resources to pull off the stunts in this movie.  But to imagine a nearly surrealistic vengeance in such an unlikely form of vigilanteism still holds a fascination for the average viewer with a typically human blood lust.  What Jigsaw does to his victims is a vengeance that we all wish at some point that we could take....and as Jigsaw says, ""I never kill people, I merely gives them the means by which they either kill themselves or survive.""  Of course, you should never try any of these stunts at home, kids...but there is a brutal realism, in the human emotions displayed by Jigsaw, and his victims.  His dream of 'helping people to appreciate the life that they too often take for granted' is taken too far to the extreme in this movie, and people should never go this far in real life, but in the fantasy of cinema, the sense of victimization of everyone involved is truly felt by the audience, even while watching someone inadvertantly slicing themselves open or hacking off a limb.  There is gruesome violence here.  There are blatant real emotions, self-preservation and testing of the human spirit in the extreme.  As always, this first movie opens and explains a premise, and all subsequent sequels destroy the beauty and carnage of the original...because with the explanations out of the way, parts 2-4 can focus on more special effects, violence and even less plausable violence scenarios.  This movie stands alone as a work of art...violent, bloody, grotesque art...but art none the less!  Parts 2-4 are good movies and a fun viewing experience, but this first movie keeps the human traps simple, more believable and less complex...leaving the complexities in the thin, flimsy study and testing of the fragile human spirit.

873435,AVCRD98TH48RN,B0006SSOHC,D. Knouse,"[6, 8]","I am completely baffled by the fact that this film ended up being intelligently written, well-acted, and totally unpredictable.  The only real negative I experienced during the film is that there are a few moments where I wanted the story to go a bit faster, the pace quickened for my own personal satisfaction, but as the final scene unfolded and a sinister grin crept across my face, all was forgiven.  I am shocked.  Once in a while a movie comes out that is destroyed by the critics and I have a serious time figuring out why.  The acting here is solid, lead by a cast of pros including Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, and Monica Potter.  The other cast members are all surprisingly good, particularly screenwriter/actor Leigh Whannell who plays the other man trapped in the room with Cary Elwes; and Makenzie Vega who plays the young daughter of Cary Elwes' character.  That little girl often shows up every other actor in the movie, and the cast is very strong besides.  The story begins with a man who awakens to find himself chained to a large steel pipe.  He is in an enclosed room with only one other occupant who is also chained on the other side of the room.  Essentially, this story starts in the middle for these two characters where they gradually figure out why they are there.  In the meantime, other characters are out there somewhere who are either wrapped up in the macabre happenings or are potential victims of the diabolical charade.  While this film is certainly no masterpiece, it does flirt with greatness time and again enough to merit a quality rating.  By the time the credits were rolling I was smiling with surprise and secretly cursing myself for ever listening to the so-called ""professional"" critics who put down this film.

873438,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B0006SSOHC,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 0]","Many people are either going to enjoy Saw or hate it, and both for the same reasons - those sick, twisted games you gotta play to shed blood (and usually more) to see how badly you want to live.  Not only did Saw raise the bar on horror, it practically started the whole ""gore"" horror sub-genre (thus leading to films like Hostel, and making it a rare find to not see a recent horror film focused more on gore than the classic horror scares.  Personally, I can't say I am in love with this film because of the gritty nature, but it is still scary entertainment to an extent nonetheless.  However, with questionable films such as these today, I still enjoy the pleasure of seeing if there is a positive message I can still hack out of this, and though it's certainly wrapped around in insanity, the message is clear - are you grateful to be alive?This is where Saw gets my praise for being very original.  It's certainly scary at times and packed with grit, but it also has a side of it that makes you think.  Kind of a mystery to be solved, and when the answer is revealed in the heightened climax, its quite rewarding cause no one could have ever seen it coming.  The story uses flashbacks and pieces them together like a puzzle up til the very end, and just when you thought you knew what the puzzle is going to look like, it turns out to be a whole other picture.  The traps in Saw also carry originality, putting people in near impossible situations to escape, but not impossible.  Our villain Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is no murderer, but he finds ways for people to kill themselves - which is usually the case.  The reason for the traps is explained as a game you must play (in Jigsaw's eyes) to test and see how much you desire life.  Generally those placed in the traps are not grateful to be alive, and these horrific games quickly put things in perspective.  Once you see these scenes, its enough to say ""Yes I am grateful.""The cast is an interesting mix for a horror film.  Danny Glover is probably the most famous actor associated with the film, but the script is somewhat limited for his role that any actor probably could have pulled it off.  Cary Elwes is also an interesting addition when I think back to his roles in Princess Bride and Men in Tights...his character is the main focus in this film and his acting may have been better suited in non-horror films.  Tobin Bell, while he gets very little screen-time as Jigsaw and even then he is usually wearing a cloak, he feels like a perfect cast (though I say this after watching the Saw sequals where he gets a lot more screentime). Tobin Bell is to Jigsaw like Anthony Hopkins is to Hannibal Lecter - you see the actor's face and that's the role he was born for.Overall, Saw brings a variety to a horror film, though really its much more than your basic horror film.  It focuses less on scares and more on what's truly scary - very disturbing scenarios that ask a simple question, and the mystery of events that is impossible to solve.Acting - 3Characters - 3.5Horror/Gore - 4.5Story - 4.5Overall - 4",4,Are you grateful to be alive?,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,3063,"['Many', 'people', 'are', 'either', 'going', 'enjoy', 'Saw', 'hate', 'same', 'reasons', 'sick', 'twisted', 'games', 'got', 'ta', 'play', 'shed', 'blood', 'usually', 'more', 'see', 'how', 'badly', 'want', 'live', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Saw', 'raise', 'bar', 'horror', 'practically', 'started', 'whole', 'gore', 'horror', 'sub-genre', 'thus', 'leading', 'films', 'Hostel', 'making', 'rare', 'find', 'not', 'see', 'recent', 'horror', 'film', 'focused', 'more', 'gore', 'classic', 'horror', 'scares', 'Personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'am', 'love', 'film', 'gritty', 'nature', 'still', 'scary', 'entertainment', 'extent', 'nonetheless', 'However', 'questionable', 'films', 'such', 'today', 'still', 'enjoy', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'positive', 'message', 'can', 'still', 'hack', 'certainly', 'wrapped', 'insanity', 'message', 'clear', 'are', 'grateful', 'be', 'alive', 'where', 'Saw', 'praise', 'being', 'very', 'original', 'certainly', 'scary', 'times', 'packed', 'grit', 'also', 'side', 'think', 'Kind', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved', 'when', 'answer', 'revealed', 'heightened', 'climax', 'quite', 'rewarding', 'cause', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'coming', 'story', 'flashbacks', 'pieces', 'together', 'puzzle', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'knew', 'what', 'puzzle', 'going', 'look', 'out', 'be', 'whole', 'other', 'picture', 'traps', 'Saw', 'also', 'carry', 'originality', 'putting', 'people', 'near', 'impossible', 'situations', 'escape', 'not', 'impossible', 'villain', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'murderer', 'ways', 'people', 'kill', 'usually', 'case', 'reason', 'traps', 'explained', 'game', 'must', 'play', 'Jigsaw', 'eyes', 'test', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'desire', 'life', 'Generally', 'placed', 'traps', 'are', 'not', 'grateful', 'be', 'alive', 'horrific', 'games', 'quickly', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'Once', 'see', 'scenes', 'enough', 'say', 'Yes', 'am', 'grateful', 'cast', 'interesting', 'mix', 'horror', 'film', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'actor', 'associated', 'film', 'script', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'role', 'actor', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'also', 'interesting', 'addition', 'when', 'think', 'back', 'roles', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Men', 'Tights', 'character', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'acting', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'non-horror', 'films', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'very', 'little', 'screen-time', 'Jigsaw', 'even', 'then', 'usually', 'wearing', 'cloak', 'perfect', 'cast', 'say', 'watching', 'Saw', 'sequals', 'where', 'lot', 'more', 'screentime', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'Jigsaw', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'see', 'actor', 'face', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'for.Overall', 'Saw', 'variety', 'horror', 'film', 'though', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'basic', 'horror', 'film', 'less', 'scares', 'more', 'what', 'truly', 'scary', 'very', 'disturbing', 'scenarios', 'ask', 'simple', 'question', 'mystery', 'events', 'impossible', 'solve.Acting', '3Characters', '3.5Horror/Gore', '4.5Story', '4.5Overall', '4']",N/A

Day ""ENIGMA""","[2, 2]","I wanted to start this review by sharing a few choice words toward the handful of individuals who said this was a bad movie, but better I think that I stay on the point of reviewing this movie. The mistake I think many had going into this movie with, is the belief that it was a horror movie in the genre of movies like HALLOWEEN, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, AND FRIDAY THE 13th, (which are played out and tired at this point)and for those of you that enjoy this particular type of horror, please dont waste your time on this movie. This movie is what I like to consider SMART HORROR, found in movies like SEVEN, or any one of the HANNIBAL, movies (where the flavor of the movie is built on suspense and the frightening thought that THERE REALLY ARE WACKED OUT SOCIAPATHS LIVING AMONGST US THAT REALLY DO COMMIT CRIMES LIKE THIS and that we, one day could become a victim to such an individual). For I am sorry to say, it sems unlikely that any of us will ever have to face the unkillable monsters found in Halloween, Nightmare, or Friday, for to me, as a child such movies were quite scary, but now as an adult, the fear factor of such characters are laughable at best.  Heck I'll be honest even when I went to the website [...] I was thoughoughly creeped out. I dont like to be a SPOILER as some are in their movie reviews so ill just ask a few questions (from the movie) to help you decide if youd like to see it: Would you be willing to kill another person to save yourself? Would you be willing to suffer amputation in order to save yourself and family? How would you handle being left alone to die? If your interest has been stirred by these questions then please check this movie out, I consider myself I true horror fan and must say this movie was well worth itP.S. to the greedy Hollywood moguls that are presently working on SAW 2 I beg of you dont and I repeat dont turn this into another worthless sequel (or number of sequels) that destroys an excellent concept like the first three movies I mentioned in this review",4,SEE-SAW,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,2026,"['wanted', 'start', 'review', 'sharing', 'few', 'choice', 'words', 'handful', 'individuals', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'better', 'think', 'stay', 'point', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'mistake', 'think', 'many', 'had', 'going', 'movie', 'belief', 'was', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'movies', 'HALLOWEEN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'ON', 'ELM', 'STREET', 'AND', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13th', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'tired', 'point', 'enjoy', 'particular', 'type', 'horror', 'please', 'dont', 'waste', 'time', 'movie', 'movie', 'what', 'like', 'consider', 'SMART', 'HORROR', 'found', 'movies', 'SEVEN', 'one', 'HANNIBAL', 'movies', 'where', 'flavor', 'movie', 'built', 'suspense', 'frightening', 'thought', 'THERE', 'REALLY', 'ARE', 'WACKED', 'OUT', 'SOCIAPATHS', 'LIVING', 'AMONGST', 'US', 'THAT', 'REALLY', 'DO', 'COMMIT', 'CRIMES', 'LIKE', 'THIS', 'one', 'day', 'could', 'become', 'victim', 'individual', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'unlikely', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'face', 'unkillable', 'monsters', 'found', 'Halloween', 'Nightmare', 'Friday', 'child', 'such', 'movies', 'were', 'quite', 'scary', 'now', 'adult', 'fear', 'factor', 'such', 'characters', 'are', 'laughable', 'best', 'Heck', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'even', 'when', 'went', 'website', '[', ']', 'was', 'thoughoughly', 'creeped', 'out', 'dont', 'be', 'SPOILER', 'are', 'movie', 'reviews', 'so', 'ill', 'just', 'ask', 'few', 'questions', 'movie', 'help', 'decide', 'youd', 'see', 'Would', 'be', 'willing', 'kill', 'person', 'save', 'Would', 'be', 'willing', 'suffer', 'amputation', 'order', 'save', 'family', 'How', 'would', 'handle', 'being', 'left', 'alone', 'die', 'interest', 'been', 'stirred', 'questions', 'then', 'please', 'check', 'movie', 'consider', 'true', 'horror', 'fan', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'itP.S', 'greedy', 'Hollywood', 'moguls', 'are', 'presently', 'working', 'SAW', '2', 'beg', 'dont', 'repeat', 'dont', 'turn', 'worthless', 'sequel', 'number', 'sequels', 'excellent', 'concept', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'review']",N/A
873449,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0006SSOHC,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[3, 5]","I tend to enjoy horror movies that are about real people, rather than the ones dealing with the supernatural. I loved ""The Ring,"" but that was because that was different. I hated ""The Grudge"" as I mentioned in an earlier review. ""Saw"" was about a psychopath killer, and it involved him and his sick twisted games to get his victims to kill other people. The one that is focused on here involved a saw, a gun, poison, and other such things. It is truely distubing, and there is never a joke to break the tension. The entire movie is one, big, dark, grim event, and I could see certain people not liking it. I saw one women gag in the theatre when I went, and even my father thought that it was disturbing, and no movie has ever really scared him. He called it the ""horror movie to end all horror movies,"" and I could see the desire to make a sequal next year.The second the movie starts it is dark. A young man named Adam wakes up in a small, dirty room. Across him is a doctor named Lawrence, and they are both chained to the wall, with a death guy in the middle of the room. The guy shot himself in the head, and the gun is still in his hands. They don't know how they got there, and why they are the ones there. They both have small envelopes in their pockets, and there is a tape player in the dead guy's other hand. They play their tapes, and learn that Lawrence must kill Adam before six o clock, or his wife and child will die and they will be left in the room to rot. They learn that there are clues around the room to help them get out, and they find two saws. They try to cut through the chains holding them to the wall, and discover that the man who trapped them there doesn't want them to cut through the chains, but he wants them to cut through their feet. Lawrence ponders why he is there, and realizes that it must be the same killer  that he was blamed resposible for. It's called the Jigsaw killer, and he finds victims to kill themselves. For example, he trapped one man in a room with a safe, a candle, and he is wearing underwear. He is covered in flammable liquid, and the combination to the safe is written on the wall. Inside the same is the key to get out. He has to use the candle to find the combination, without going on fire, except there are shards of broken glass all over the room. Another one involves a women trapped in a certain headgear, and when she gets up it'll trigger a timer. She has to go across the room, and cut open a man's stomach to get a key that is inside him, to unlock the headgear, otherwise it'll open her month forever, and she only has sixty seconds to do it all. It's actually really grim stuff. He was the prime suspect by Detective David Tapp, who is now going crazy trying to find the killer, after the killer ends the life of his partner and friend. As Lawrence and Adam try to figure out what is going on, they have to maintain the safety of his family, and also themselves.""Saw"" is a very disturbing movie, and it came out the perfect time. It's a good thing it didn't come out in ASeptember like it was supposed to, or it'll be following the same footsteps s ""Surviving Christmas,"" and then the movie wouldn't have worked as well. It is a much better Halloween treat than ""The Grudge,"" and this movie wasn't full of jump scenes. It was full of human reaction to fear, and it was intense from the beginning to the end. I was always wondering the fate of these people, and the ending was such a shock, I was amazed. It's one of those endings where it's obvious, and then they throw it an additional twist to throw you off. The only problem was the acting. The acting was terrible, especially by Cary Elwes, who played Lawrence. I recongnized him from ""Liar Liar"" and he was bad then. He's not really learning from him acting mistakes. Danny Glover was good, but when is he not. This is a very good movie, and I liked it.ENJOY!Rated R for strong grisly violence and language.",4,Very Disturbing. . .

873457,A23FPOXQ6HIN4J,B0006SSOHC,Evan Harris,"[1, 5]","Hype can be a dangerous thing. For a long time all I heard about this movie was how disturbing and relentlessy terrifying it was. Well i saw it finally and my expectations were not what I would say raised, but high enough to be slightly dissapointed. Don't get me wrong,I didn't hate it, it just didn't end up equaling the sum of its parts.The basic plot is this:two guys who seemingly have nothing to do with each other wake up in a room.They don't have any idea how they got there, they're chained by the ankle to opposite ends of the room, there's a dead body between them and to make matters even worse, they are taunted by a video moniter showing with some sort of handpuppet clown(piture Pennywise and Gonzo having a baby) who tells them this is all part of a game he's set up for them to teach them a lesson about some sort of evildoing that he knows about and they have to figure out how to escape or the consequences are going to be dire. Intercut with that are scenes of Danny Glover as an ex-cop fired for his obsession with Jigsaw(the puppet) and even after losing his job,still pursues him. In the Glover flashbacks we get treated to past victims of Jigsaw and the torments they endured.Overall, the movie had some nice horror sequences,some creative kills and an ending I didn't see coming, so Im really looking to give it 2 and a half stars, but i can't. the problems in the movie arise when you look at the fact that this movie is setting itself up to be a serious, disturbing look into the psyche and comes across as more B-grade than it pretends to be. Sort of an overhyped snuff film. In a serious horror movie, you're supposed to be afraid, or at least disturbed. Saw did neither of those things for me, it barely crossed th line into entertaining. Don't get me wrong, im all for senseless violence and gore, but when it tries to put on a nice dress when it really is Courtney Love morning after a bender underneath, well, she ain't foolin anybody. The perfomances as a whole take away something from the proceedings as well. Cary Elwes plays one of the men in the room and as I said before Danny Glover is the obsessed ex-cop whose investigation soon becomes intertwined with with Mr Elwes's consequence(does that even make sense?) and both men seem out of their element. Their performances are so overwrought and ""tension"" filled that theres never anywhere to go for them. Look, if the characters can't take you with them in a movie like this, you ain't going. Where are the levels? Both men verge on camp and they simply fall in line with everyone else in the movie, save Ronald Mcdonald on acid(aforementioned puppet).When an expressionless block with a mouth that can't do much more than move up and down can show more subtlety than you, you've got a problem. Also, alot of the fear in the movie depends on mounting tension. Part of what the men are given to help them figure out how to escape are saws(get it?) and the build-up through most of the movie is finding out who, if anybody, would be the one to give himself the lifetime 50% discount for all future Dr Scholls purchases and when that moment finally arrives, not only was it not tense, it was hysterical. Probably not what they were shooting for.Anyway, Its not horrible, I don't know that I would even call it bad, but it wasn't what it was cracked up to be. you could say that I never SAW what all the hype was about(HHAHAHAHAHAHA).

In fact, one would say that the tone of the movie has a slighly ""Se7enish feel.""The good part is that that doesn't take away from the excitement or the suspense. Along the way, the film educates you on the one holding them hostage and his method of killing. The Killer, apparently called Jigsaw, wants the victim's to figure out the puzzles of the death game that he has created. There are several ways to escape but all of them are either preconceived or pre-thout out ahead of time in where the chances of survival and escaping are both on a very jagged plane.I'd say that this movie finally captures what every other director was trying to do with modern day Horror. I'll go one step further and say that this movie Re-invented the Horror franchise. And, for a first try, debut film, these two filmakers really raise the bar higher than ever anticipated.I highly reccomend this film if you are a hardcore horror/thriller fan but also want the thinking that goes along with it, as with the Movie Seven.I saw this movie when it first came out around Halloween and let me tell you that this Franchise did something Newer, Bolder, and that they have invented a new Franchise for the Horror fans in need.

However, this film is not for the squeamish.The film revolves around a serial killer who doesn't kill people himself; but rather, places people in intricate situations which require difficult decisions to be made in order to stay alive.The victims selected are not the pillars of society. It's this collection of individuals, which is the key to the whole plot of this film and eventually the identity of the killer. These people are throwing away the one true thing the killer cherishes, and that's live itself. So they are forced to prove their right to life in an elaborate set of tests or die trying.I would categorize this film as a thriller; however, the killings do have a touch of gore to them. I love films that stretch the imagination and develop new and exotic ways to tell an age old story, and this film does just that.The film's title is a foreshadowing of things to come from almost the beginning of the film. Two complete strangers Carey Elwes and Leigh Whannell wake up in a dark, and dingy bathroom only to find themselves chained by their legs to separate walls of the room. While rummaging around the room, a sack is found and in it are two hacksaws. The hacksaws are not strong enough to cut through the chains which are binding our main characters, what do you suppose the hacksaws are to be used?At the same time, Danny Glover plays a cop also searching for our mysterious killer, commonly referred to as Jigsaw because of these complex games he forces his victims to play.Again, the gruesome murder scenes almost elevate this film to a horror flick.

873464,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B0006SSOHC,General Zombie,"[1, 2]","Over the last decade or so, little has excited the Hollywood establishment more than the 'Thriller', or 'Serial Killer Movie'. (Well not all thrillers involve serial killers, but virtually all the major recent ones do)  I generally don't watch these films.  Sure, 'Silence of the Lambs' was pretty good, and 'Seven' was good too, but most of these films just look tedious and formulaic, and what little I have seen has fulfilled these expectations. Now we have 'Saw', and I'm pleased to say that it isn't really a thriller, and leans more to the horror side of the spectrum.  Sure, there's a serial killer in the movie, and the visual style is massively indebted to Fincher, but at it's heart, 'Saw' is really just a low-budget horror film.(Only about a million dollar budget, shot in 2 1/2 weeks)  These sorts of films can't complete with major productions in terms of acting and production values, so they put all the emphasis on ideas and scenes.(Well, the good ones do, anyway)  So understand this all coming in- the acting isn't going to be up to major production standards, and the plot isn't going to be as developed or plausible.  If you can't get over those two things, you aren't going to enjoy this.  'Saw', however, makes up for it in other ways.  It's got frightful, intriguing ideas and interesting scenes and a strong, expressionistic (if derivative) visual style.  It may not all add up cleanly at the end, but the scenes are good enough that that doesn't really matter.Though I'm sure everyone already knows, the basic setup is this: Adam and Lawrence wake up in an old, abandoned bathroom.  They are each chained to pipes on the opposite sides of the room.  There is a corpse in between them, an apparent suicide victim, who is holding a tape player and a gun.  They soon learn that they are the victims of the Jigsaw killer, who places people in a elaborate games of death, from which they may be able to escape alive.  They will have to suffer, however.  In this case, Jigsaw requires that Lawrence kill Adam by 6:00, or else Jigsaw will kill Lawrence's family.  The rest of the movie is just their attempts to deal with this situation, and some flashbacks to help them figure out just what is going on.(They're more than a little disoriented, initially) This basic setup is more horror than thriller, as the police only play a very minor role, and there is very little investigation into the killer's life or identity.  They are simply common people in a life or death situation, who must escape.  In lots of ways, the basic plot is pretty Giallo-esque.(Italian thriller precursors which involved a crime investigation,but almost invariably placed style, atmosphere and set-pieces ahead of plot or plausibility)  It uses numerous giallo conventions: the protagonists are regular people, every character matters, the killer's motivation is very giallo-esque (can't be completely specific w/o giving too much away) most everything proves to be connected, and the mandatory twist ending is more of a ludicrous sick joke than a grand revelation. (Not to say that I don't like the ending. I like it a lot)  Naturally, this sort of film is even more convoluted and unlikely that you typical thriller, and I suspect it's just a reflection of sloppy writing rather than same grand scheme, but it reveals the general aesthetic of both these types of films: scenes and ideas first, plot second.Visually, the film is a combination of ultra grimy, sleazy settings with a few high-class but cold and dark places as well.  As I said before, it is massively indebted to David Fincher's work, but that's a very good style.  Well worth ripping off.  The intense griminess and stylization of visuals also sets it apart from most thrillers, as it is taken to such a point that the world no longer seems even remotely real. (Though some thrillers are like this. i.e. `Seven',) Sometimes Wan over does it a little, with some fast-motion-spinny-camera stuff that's just sorta silly, but most of the time it works.  There are some very weird visuals that are, once again, quite typical of independent horror and giallos while being foreign to mainstream thrillers.  For example, `Jigsaw' likes to use a disturbing little ventriloquist dummy as his avatar while communicating with his victims.  He can also be quite flamboyantly dressed, with a huge, shimmery red or black cloak and a bizarre mask.  There's really no explanation why he would choose to be like that, he just does, because the filmmakers thought it would be cool or scary.  Though the film is very dark and grisly it isn't extremely gory.  Much of the violence is shown fairly obscurely or not at all, but what happens is conceptually nasty enough that it is plenty effective even without being given a close, detailed view.  What gore there is is generally fairly well done, particularly considering the budget they had.As I keep saying, this film has great scenes, even if they doesn't always make all that much sense.  Most notably, the whole setup is just great, I think.  Convoluted and highly, highly unlikely, but great.  Some specifics:  A particularly effective scene is when we see the ordeal of Jigsaw's one surviving victim, who had to dig a key out a man intestinal track in order to remove a giant metal device from her heard, which is set to rip her jaws apart if she takes too long.  Similarly excellent is the scene where Adam is abducted, as he wanders about his powerless apart, randomly taking pictures to provide a small, brief bit of illumination.  And, the climax, while I cant go into specifics, is really very intense and grisly.  A very effective closing the the film.Despite what anyway may tell you, the acting in this film is perfectly serviceable.  No, it isn't first-rate, and they occasionally blow some lines, but most of the time it's at least passable.  And anyone who really has that big of a problem with the acting doubtless isn't much of a horror fan, so who cares what they think.Yeah, that's it.  Not terribly plausible, but I've never cared about that much anyway.  Virtually everything else works quite well.

I have not seen SAW's sequels (though I liked this one enough to see the others), but I can say that this movie is more in the SE7EN kind of vein than the torture porn flicks we've been subjected to over the last few years. Yes, it is quite often gruesome, graphic, and disturbing, but it is all accredited to a very clever and darkly interesting premise.We are introduced to our two protagonists (if they can be called that, as they have their vices) first, workaholic doctor Lawrence (Cary Elwes) and cocky youngster Adam (screenwriter Leigh Whannell), who awaken in a dark room resembling a larger version of a prison cell, each of them chained to pipes adjacent from each other. In the center is a dead body holding an unloaded gun with a gunshot wound to the head and a tape recorder. Adam and Lawrence each have tapes to be played on that recorder, on which a raspy voice, their captor, informs Lawrence that he must kill Adam by 6:00 that night, or he will kill Lawrence's wife and daughter. To further explain what could possibly be going on, Adam and Lawrence both tell certain stories about their past, leading to flashbacks where we are introduced to other key characters like policeman Det. David Tapp (Danny Glover) and his partner, Det. Steven Sing (Ken Leung), who are on the trail of the Jigsaw Killer, a sadistic serial killer who forces his victims to save their own lives through twisted puzzles and games. Lawrence believes this Jigsaw is their holder, and that Tapp believes Lawrence is somehow in cahoots with Jigsaw. More plot complications pile on top of each other, leading to the bloody, shocking finale, which whether you like it or not, is a doozy.Writer Whannell and director James Wan, both newcomers, showcase a great confidence towards filmmaking, as Whannell's writing is very fluid and engrossing (I'm not saying he's David Mamet, but for someone not much older than college age he's very talented) and Wan's direction points toward a long future in filmmaking. Elwes should have won some sort of horror acting award or at least award for best desperate screaming and wailing (something I can't quite say for Whannell, a much better writer than he is an actor, though he's more than adequate in his role).

Several reviewers have stated that it puts up one too many red herrings and, you know, maybe that's true, but frankly I love that stuff - I eat up Agatha Christy-type story lines. And this is somewhat in that vein - just extremely gory.A couple of guys who don't know each other wake up in a disgusting bathroom (I think it's the one that Ewan McGregor went toilet diving in Trainspotting...)chained to the walls. The corpse of someone who blew his own brains out lies between them. They can't free themselves unless one or both of them can saw off his leg using a saw provided by their tormentor (yes, they try it on the chains first to no avail).  Provided with piecemeal clues, the men try to devise a way out of their prison, only to find that if they don't do exactly as their tormentor has stated one of the man's family will be murdered.The cast includes Cary Elwes (Princess Bride and Twister), Danny Glover (do you really need help here?), Monica Potter, and a few unknowns (one of whom wrote the story).The acting is well above par for such a film. The film is sufficiently claustrophobic when it needs to be and expands outside to give us a bit of breathing room only to reel us back in for more.If you have a stomach for some gore and a few really good thrills, check this film out.",4,Gripping but gory thriller/horror film,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,1404,"['Saw', 'creepy', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'high', 'wattage', 'actors', 'deliver', 'tense', 'moments', 'Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'up', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'red', 'herrings', 'know', 'maybe', 'true', 'frankly', 'love', 'stuff', 'eat', 'up', 'Agatha', 'Christy-type', 'story', 'lines', 'somewhat', 'vein', 'just', 'extremely', 'gory.A', 'couple', 'guys', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'wake', 'up', 'disgusting', 'bathroom', 'think', 'one', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'went', 'toilet', 'diving', 'Trainspotting', 'chained', 'walls', 'corpse', 'someone', 'who', 'blew', 'own', 'brains', 'out', 'lies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'free', 'one', 'can', 'saw', 'off', 'leg', 'using', 'saw', 'provided', 'tormentor', 'yes', 'try', 'chains', 'first', 'avail', 'Provided', 'piecemeal', 'clues', 'men', 'try', 'devise', 'way', 'prison', 'only', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'exactly', 'tormentor', 'stated', 'one', 'man', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'murdered.The', 'cast', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Twister', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'help', 'here', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'few', 'unknowns', 'one', 'whom', 'wrote', 'story', '.The', 'acting', 'well', 'par', 'film', 'film', 'sufficiently', 'claustrophobic', 'when', 'be', 'expands', 'outside', 'give', 'bit', 'breathing', 'room', 'only', 'reel', 'back', 'more.If', 'have', 'stomach', 'gore', 'few', 'really', 'good', 'thrills', 'check', 'film', 'out']",N/A

It is no small task trying to legitimately engage and frighten audiences jaded by decades of mostly predictable and silly horror flicks. That ""Saw"" comes so close to succeeding on these fronts speaks volumes for its unexpected quality. Surely this film suffers from the usual horror movie flaws: overacting, a preposterous plot, dumb lines and gore that is far more disgusting than it is scary. But those who accuse ""Saw"" of being derivative -- specifically, a rip-off of the superior ""Seven"" with Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman -- simply misunderstand horror movies. What horror movie is NOT derivative, except for works like Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"", perhaps? All of the cult classics, from ""The Hills Have Eyes"" to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Last house on the Left,"" the motif never veers too far from its basic premise: group of friends goes on adventurous excursion, enjoys a fleeting taste of freedom,innocence and exhiliration, and is then led terribly astray by unforeseen circumstances. Despite the success that motif has occasionally delivered over the years, ""Saw"" relies on a far more complicated and meticulous story brimming with fascinating details and psychological inquiry. Some of the acting is predictably awful, and the script is not the most intelligent or sincere piece of writing -- but then how inteligent is it to expect something cerebral of a horror flick (Polanski aside)? I am not apologizing for ""Saw,"" for it needs no apology. The film really does speak for itself. It is not quite the classic it might have been and the plot can sometimes come close to falling from the threads that suspend it, but it is vastly superior to most of the mere kitsch and marketing that passes for ""horror"" today -- stuff like the recent Texas Chainsaw remake or ""Dracula 2000,"" which ranks as some of the worst filmmaking in cinematic history.

And it succeeds, on many levels.  Written by Director James Wan and actor (in this film) Leigh Whannell, SAW drags us into the darkened sewer where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) are chained to opposite sides of a filthy room, the centerpiece of which is a corpse recently dead by gunshot suicide.  Yet on this corpse is a tape recorder and after some otherworldly instructions, each man finds a tape on his person that gives instructions on how to take up the next hour and a half of grisly fantasy.It seems there are loonies out there whose sick minds seek retribution for being ignored or abused by the characters trapped in the sewer lounge.  Included in this m&eacute;lange are Dr. Gordon's wife (Monica Potter) and his daughter, medical and patient personnel from Gordon's oncology practice, and two detectives (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) exploring a serial killer bent on have victims kill themselves in bizarrely medieval methods.  It now seems the good doctor and Adam are the latest players in the sicko's trail and how all this works out is a cat and mouse chase and pulse-pounding (?thudding) run to the finish.  No, giving away the ending would weaken the effect of the story, so leave that alone.

I saw it last night and I think it is well almost worth the hype owing to the things that you have to explain to yourself rather than let the movie do it for you.The most possible reason for my curiousity for this movie is the amount of ridicule and disappointment people feel for Saw2. This movie was never released in my city but I had to wait and get a dvd from somewhere. It is a 100 minute film and just when your brain starts wondering what is going to happen next it hits with you two or three shocker moments. I must add that the music in the film adds to the tension and strange feeling of admirable awe it arose in me.WHO IS THIS MOVIE FOR?I wouldnt say this movie is for everyone because I am pretty sure a lot of people would find a few flaws and try to explain them to one another. Most people have a ""we want to hate a movie"" syndrome so it is defintiely not for those looking to ridicule. What really matters is the unique storyline and the sickness behind a brain that wants to teach you a lesson by playing with your life.WHAT WAS WEAK ABOUT THE FILM?The scenes involving the doctor cheating on his wife and the very poor enactment of a fight by the wife just before the doctor is leaving. Also the scene where he is on the laptop trying to look strangely passionate about his work. The detectives were silly too.

It certainly has its faults as does every movie but it is a genius horror movie compared to the rest of them.First off, most of what happens in the movie is effective. It opens with two men in a room, chained to posts. They don't know each other. Information is left telling them that one of them needs to kill the other in a certain amount of time or his family will be killed. Soon, they realize that they've been abducted by the Jigsaw Killer, a highly insane madman. Meanwhile, detectives are investigating his murders and are trying to find the newest victims before it's too late for them.The movie packs chills a plenty and some scenes will make you grossed out. For a horror movie, it's in the top 5 I've ever seen; for a regular movie, it still is a very good movie worth the watch.The ending has a huge twist that was geniously conceived and worth the watch alone. Everything clicks right though in this movie that is simply a must see. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel but I doubt that it will be able to surpass this movie.So this Halloween, rent Saw, check it out and then watch the sequel which I'm sure will be great.The ending in my opinion is one of the best ever in horror movies and really came out of nowhere and it will make you view the movie differently every time you will see it.Now for the real review...This movie is in my opinion better than all of the Hannibal movies. Why? Because this movie is very entertaining. It is obvious that it was a low budget movie but this plot is genius. The whole time, you're on the edge of your seat. You're like on a roller coaster ride..and when you think that it will slow down, it just keeps on going until at the end when the roller coaster just blows up. The ending is to me the best I've ever seen. Look how genius it is. Don't tell me any of you thought of it! Sure the Silence of the Lambs has better acting but really..this movie is splendid and really entertaining. I loved it and now own it because it's a one of kind movie regarded by most as your average horror flick but it's not..like Identity, this movie becomes more than a horror movie..it becomes an excellent movie..a smart thriller with great thrills and twists that is worthy to add to your collection. So please don't regard this as your typical so so horror movie that you might want to rent for Halloween.

Who'd ever believe that such a tiny movie would be the first to re-invent horror for the 21st century? Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell play Doctor Gordon and hapless jerk Adam, a mis-matched duo who wake up in a disgusting bathroom chained to the piping at either end of the expansive room. A dead body lies between, blood and gore on the floor around it. Doctor Gordon suspects that it is the work of the infamous ""Jigsaw"" - a madman known for subjecting lowlifes to brutal tests to prove their desire to live.A series of flashbacks follow which build a greater story around the plight of the two men, culminating in a climax that is still as unnerving now as it was nearly 10 years ago. Saw is a very clever film, but is let down by overly filtered cinematography, choppy editing that is full of stutter cuts, and a sound design that is bloated with far too many cheap stingers. The acting is a little weak at times too but considering the conditions, and the fact that there was no rehearsal at all so the footage you see is sometimes the first attempt by the actors to get it done means you can't judge it too harshly.The production design tries to emulate David Fincher's Se7en but ends up looking like a cheap 70s porno. But the whole film was shot in one big building, so you just can't pick faults. Like I said, what Wan managed to pull off with the time and budget he was given is nothing short of remarkable. The sequels were given more money to crazy with, but the first Saw movie should be viewed as a different entity.Love it or hate it, Saw is a major achievement for the fledgling writer/director pairing of Whannell and Wan.Saw is presented in a very drab and grainy 1.78:1 1080p picture on Blu-ray that reflects the harsh shooting restrictions. There was probably no time to set up and shoot more dynamic attempts at cinematography which gives the film a raw aesthetic, that fits the subject matter at the very least.

Lawrence is chained to a pipe too.  A third man has been killed and is lying on the floor.  The men don't remember how they got there.

If i say too much, the mysteries are already solved.  So im going to attempt to say as little aobut this movie as possible.  Anything that i think might be damaging to your enjoyment of the movie is marked with the regular ###sThis film messes with your mind.  A few times i had to think a bit ""Okay is this in the present?  The past?""  It switches times and places on you without much warning.  However even with the sometimes rushed feeling of the film, it still wasnt quick enough.  The more you learn the more you want to learn.  There came a point when i was highly impatient and couldnt stand the thought that the movie had as much time left as it did.  Everything that went on was interesting to me and compeled me to continue watching just to see how things turned out.  Sometimes i have a tendency to pause the movie to get up and get something to eat or drink or whatever.  But that didnt happen once this movie started!  I HAD to know what was happening so there was no way i was pausing anything!  The last twenty minutes or so (possibly half an hour?) are VERY intense.  I found myself wringing my hands more than once.The gore factor is there, but not overstressed.  In fact reading the trivia on Internet Movie Database it says they took out some of the more gross scenes to get their rating down to an 'R' from a 'NC17'.  It also says that they used some of the reharsal takes for the movie.  Must be why Cary Elwes sometimes annoys me.###The mystery is actually quite simple.  But its SO simple that it ends up being quite complex.  You overthink yourself and what might be going on.

Enjoy.A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.Saw ONE begins with THREE people trapped in an abandoned BATHROOM.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) game, ADAM STANHEIGHT (Leigh Whannell) and DR. LAWRENCE GORDON (Cary Elwes) have to prove their will to live, and their ability to COOPERATE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), DET. STEVEN SING (Len Leung), and rugged veteran DAVID TAPP (Danny Glover) are investigating as a team, but DAVID TAPP may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participants learn that ADAM may be an accomplice to their abduction, and their situation provides a choice between a SAW AND A LEG or guaranteed death.  To help their cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead the captives (aka life's perpetrators) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.Several previous murderous contraptions like the RAZOR WIRE MAZE (for a CUTTER), and the NAPALM/POISON/GLASS ROOM (for a HYPOCHONDRIAC) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the REVERSE BEAR TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S MIND, and on to Saw II.Jason Elin",5,Saw I - Bloody breath of fresh air,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,1847,"['consecutively', 'watching', 'entire', 'Saw', 'series', 'recent', 'weekend', 'LOVING', 'decided', 'single', 'review', 'modified', 'details', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'films', 'Enjoy.A', 'sadistic', 'sociopath', 'similar', 'one', 'Se7en', 'affinity', 'engineering', 'play', 'lethal', 'games', 'forcing', 'victims', 'unappreciative', 'life', 'existential', 'choice', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'engineering', 'machinery.Saw', 'ONE', 'THREE', 'people', 'trapped', 'abandoned', 'BATHROOM', 'Forced', 'play', 'killer', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'John', 'Jigsaw', 'Kramer', 'game', 'ADAM', 'STANHEIGHT', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'DR.', 'LAWRENCE', 'GORDON', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'have', 'prove', 'will', 'live', 'ability', 'COOPERATE', 'Meanwhile', 'DET', 'ALLISON', 'KERRY', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'DET', 'STEVEN', 'SING', 'Len', 'Leung', 'rugged', 'veteran', 'DAVID', 'TAPP', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'are', 'investigating', 'team', 'DAVID', 'TAPP', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'deep', 'law', 'increasingly', 'closer', 'ensnaring', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'participants', 'learn', 'ADAM', 'may', 'be', 'accomplice', 'abduction', 'situation', 'choice', 'SAW', 'A', 'LEG', 'guaranteed', 'death', 'help', 'cause', 'cryptic', 'clues', 'left', 'mini', 'cassette', 'tape', 'lead', 'captives', 'aka', 'life', 'perpetrators', 'towards', 'precipice', 'twisted', 'rehabilitation', 'potential', 'tomb.Several', 'previous', 'murderous', 'contraptions', 'RAZOR', 'WIRE', 'MAZE', 'CUTTER', 'NAPALM/POISON/GLASS', 'ROOM', 'HYPOCHONDRIAC', 'provide', 'horror', 'fodder', 'form', 'viscera', 'blood', 'spatter', 'other', 'traps', 'REVERSE', 'BEAR', 'TRAP', 'are', 'inserted', 'same', 'reason', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'always', 'took', 'ensign', 'Jones', 'away', 'parties', 'someone', 'situation', 'die', 'horribly', 'Climax', 'cliffhanger', 'are', 'quick', 'succession', 'flashbacks', 'provide', 'necessary', 'details', 'viewer', 'more', 'JIGSAW', 'MIND', 'Saw', 'II.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

Saw is a Seven clone but without the heart, soul or intensity of the original psychological thriller. Saw tries in every way to mimic the better aspects of Fincher's masterpiece, the ultra-quick cuts, the psycho who's fed up with the wrongs of society and the no win choice that the main character of this film is left with. Cary Elwes plays Lawrence, a middle aged surgeon who is married with a small daughter. Elwes just doesn't have the grit needed to pull off this grimy, dirty, angry role. He's too much of a pretty boy and you can see right through his rantings and ravings as ultra-scripted. The plot twists a number of times but the ending has to rank among the worst I've ever seen. It leaves the viewer angry and feeling hollow, besides this, lots of loose ends are never tied up. The premise is what drew me to the film certainly not the star power (or lack of star power for that matter) eventhough Danny Glover does play a cop in search of the killer.

And half of it actually is, but...""Saw"" promises a lot and almost makes good on it.  I adore the horror/serial killer genre -- the nastier, the better.  So the only real advice I have for these movies that bludgeon you with how dark it is instead of just riding the inherent dark wave provided within the story, is... please stop trying to be ""SE7EN.""  You just will not succeed.  ""SE7EN"" was all about story, and the grimy details and foul murders are what get all the kudos.  So don't build a movie around twisted situations, just let it evolve natch, you'll be surprised where narrative logic can take you.""Saw"" got made because of the cringe-inducing scenarios it offers, namely the various and unique machines and games this Nameless labotomy patient comes up with.  But as far as the twist upon twist within the nastiness, that's just drastically unoriginal, and the police pursuit nearing the end plays out more like an ""X-Files"" episode.Suspend most common sense logic, and this movie will probably work its way under your skin.  My problem is, I like my horror movies to reflect the actual horror and hatred of the everyday world.  The guy running this game has an agenda similar to that of John Doe in ""Se7en.""  He just hates the people who make him sick, i.e. everyone.  But you don't get to know enough about the guy to fear him, or even push for his eventual demise(?) or whatever restitution you may think this sicko deserves.  Guess it depends on how twisted each viewer is.There are some spots in here where the acting is just bad, and not the good kind of bad.  Usually, that'll slip you out of the suspension of disbelief (it does me), and then you start counting subsequent flaws that follow.  The twist-the-screw-a-notch-tighter ending is very effective until they throw in one minor detail from the beginning that again categorizes as just repetitive, then you get that moment that'll make you disappointedly say, ""Ah, c'mon.""The chief strengths in the movie (the impetus to give James Wan money to make it) are the sick and elaborately twisted details within the games he makes each person play.  Some of 'em will make you shudder and wince just sitting there.  (The girl with the headgear from Hell comes to mind.)  Then he blows it with that Rob Zombie, MTV-style camera-whirling and fraction-second editing that's become the trend du jour of horror films for the past ten years.

Every other day brought new photos, new links to trailers, new behind the scenes stories, and new conjectures all pointing to the incredible potential of this movie. Those insiders lucky enough to view the film before its general release spoke in reverent tones about the carnage we all would soon see with ""Saw."" They furthermore whispered words like ""giallo"" and ""Argento"" to describe the stylistic aspects of the movie. Needless to say I wanted to see this picture in the worst way after reading such high praise: I love films larded with gory carnage, love gialli, and think Dario Argento is one of the great horror masters of the modern age. Sadly, seeing ""Saw"" in the theater would not become a reality for me. In a tradeoff with my girlfriend that I will rue until the day I die, I agreed to attend a screening of the pedestrian ""The Forgotten"" instead of ""Saw."" I just got my revenge, however, by forcing her to watch the DVD edition of a film that I consider one of the best new horror films to come down the pike in quite some time.""Saw"" begins by introducing us to two characters who will come to dominate most of the film's screen time: Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). The two men awake to find themselves chained to pipes in a phenomenally grungy bathroom with little knowledge of how they got there or why they are there. Then they start discovering clues: a corpse clutching a tape recorder and pistol lies in a pool of blood in the center of the room, envelopes containing cassette tapes lie in their pockets, hacksaws soon turn up, and a camera watches them from behind a two way mirror. It's obvious someone with a sick sense of humor placed these guys in this room with a purpose in mind, and that purpose gradually comes to the fore with horrific implications. Dr. Gordon suddenly recalls a series of incidents a few months before involving a serial killer named Jigsaw, a killer whose victims perish in extraordinarily graphic ways. It turns out that this murderer isn't an average stalk and slash psychopath, however, but a cunning sadist who thinks his mission is to teach others the value of life. He does so by placing them in traps that require the subject to overcome their flaws in order to escape. Adam and Gordon are definitely caught up in Jigsaw's latest shenanigans.Most of what we learn in ""Saw"" comes from flashbacks from Adam and Gordon. We learn that a Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) and his fellow investigators on the force tried to pin the crimes on Dr. Gordon when they linked a piece of evidence to the good doctor. We also discover that Gordon has a lot of family problems with his daughter and wife. Heck, it isn't too long before we realize that nearly every major character--Tapp, Adam, Gordon, and a couple of others--possesses some secret that hints at the possibility that any of these guys could be Jigsaw. And we learn more about Jigsaw, his strange philosophy, his haunts, and his stomach churning props. This killer locked one of his victims, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), in a helmet that could tear her head apart and demanded she look for the key in the most unusual of places. He's a warped, warped individual, but he's also a guy who keeps his word. If his victim escapes from his scheme they are free to reenter society, hopefully with a better outlook on the importance of life. ""He helped me,"" claims Amanda, and it's disturbing to realize you understand exactly what she means.Jigsaw's philosophy is one of only a large number of massively disturbing elements in ""Saw,"" but it's one of the more interesting ones. People say his stance on life mirrors the film ""Seven,"" and perhaps that is so. I saw a greater similarity between Jigsaw's tortures and the scene in ""Fight Club"" where Tyler Durden uses the threat of death to force a young convenience store clerk to follow his dream of becoming a veterinarian instead of wallowing in apathy. The idea is to get people to wake up and start appreciating each and every day. If it takes a barbed wire trap or a bear trap helmet to bring the sheep to their senses, so be it. ""Saw"" offers us more than mere mental gymnastics, fortunately, including Cary Elwes hamming it up as the coolly aloof Gordon, a very creepy puppet used to great effect, and a scene with a flashbulb taken right out of the original ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre."" In fact, ""Saw"" rips off a lot of stuff from other classic horror films, but it does so in way that didn't bother me. Frankly, I like to see a movie paying homage once in awhile. What did surprise me was the gore, or lack thereof. This is the unrated cut? Where's the sauce? There are a few nasty surprises but ""Saw"" keeps most of the grue safely out of camera range. Pity.Extras on the widescreen edition disc disappoint. I kicked back before starting the behind the scenes feature, figuring that the whole thing would take twenty or thirty minutes to play out. It took TWO AND A HALF MINUTES! Then there's a music video and a short documentary about making the music video. The poster gallery and trailers section don't break new ground, nor does the commentary track from director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell. Who wants to bet a double dip special edition DVD will arrive in stores soon? Any takers? Nevertheless, ""Saw"" is definitely worth a watch; it's a fine film that blows away most of the mainstream horror coming out today.",4,"""He helped me""",1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,5534,"['six',

Many of today's horror films have left out much of the blood, but that is not the case with ""Saw"".Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) and Leigh Whannell (Adam) find themselves in a very dirty and unkept bathroom, each chained at opposite ends of the bathroom  to a pipe.  There is a dead man in the middle of the bathroom, lying in a pool of blood and clutching a tape recorder in one hand and a gun in the other.  After overcoming their initial shock, Lawrence and Adam decide that they must work together in order to get out alive. They begin to search the bathroom for anything that might help them escape, but the only items they find are two hacksaws that prove to be worthless in cutting through the chains that are holding each man to their respective pipes.  Each man discovers that they have a small cassette tape in their pockets.  After retrieving the cassette player from the dead man, Lawrence discovers that in order to survive, he must kill Adam before the clock on the wall reaches 6:00. Also, Lawrence finds out that his wife and daughter have been taken hostage, and they will be killed if Lawrence fails to kill Adam.  This sets off a desperate race against the clock to try to escape, as well as finding out the identity of their captor.  Will Lawrence and Adam survive?  Will Lawrence kill Adam?This movie is very good.  The plot is brilliantly conceived, and the twists and turns are definitely the highlight of the film.  A lot of good background information is provided in the flashbacks expreienced by Dr. Gordon.  The ending of the film was totally unexpected, and it will leave you spellbound.  I highly recommend this movie.  The plot is extremely well conceived and the story is teriffic.

873507,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0006SSOHC,J from NY,"[0, 1]","I wouldn't exactly call this ""horror"" as much as a crime film, since there's no supernatural element in at all.  Whatever Wan was originally going for with this strange little piece, it really is a double edged sword: while lacking the power of ""Seven"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"", it has a more interesting psychopath at the base of the events than any of them.  Although we never find out who the ""Jigsaw Killer"" really is or about his life (other than that he is dying), his ""morals"" are very existential and go above and beyond the dimestore psychology of such people we are offered in most movies: ""something in happened in his/her childhood, he/she is repeating the pattern, etc"".  Nothing like that.I was misled about this film: it does NOT take place in one room.  Most of the important parts which compose the real plottake place outside of the dirty utility room the men wake up in.  This is no cinematic experiment. Leigh Whannel, who wrote the film, plays Adam, one of the two who gets thrown in the proverbial pan along with Cary Elwes, who plays Dr. Lawrence Gordon.  One would think that if Whannel cared enough to write this very complex story, he would have done a much better of job of acting in it. At times the acting and one liners were so bad that you would think these guys were trying out for a part in a high school play.The real substance of the film lies elsewhere, though. The Jigsaw Killer is a particularly volatile and concealed psychopath with a point to prove more legitimate than most of his serial killer peers: he thinks people should appreciate life while they have it.  From this he reasons that putting them in the most horrendous situations (like locking a drug addicts' head into a time-bomb-vice and leaving her to find the key might make her appreciate her face more) might shock them out of their complacency.  I don't if this is what Wan was trying to do, but I found most of the ""protagonists"" so boring and annoying that you're just itching to know more about the killer--the only character who isn't one dimensional.Some of the symbolism is unforgettable: the really deranged puppet the killer has popping up at crucial moments, and the Samurai-esque costume he wears when on the attack.  The scene in which Danny Glover (who does little but sweat, obsess and get his throat cut) and his partner happen upon Jigsaw ""in the act"" and the aftermath is so sadistic and gruesome that some people in the theatre screamed.The ending, though, is the big shocker.  This isn't a masterpiece, but it approaches one.  Worth buying when it comes to DVD.",4,"Not perfect, but basically a good horror movie",1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,2586,"['would', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'call', 'horror', 'as', 'much', 'crime', 'film', 'supernatural', 'element', 'Wan', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'strange', 'little', 'piece', 'really', 'double', 'edged', 'sword', 'lacking', 'power', 'Seven', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'more', 'interesting', 'psychopath', 'base', 'events', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer', 'really', 'life', 'other', 'dying', 'morals', 'are', 'very', 'existential', 'go', 'above', 'dimestore', 'psychology', 'such', 'people', 'are', 'offered', 'most', 'movies', 'something', 'happened', 'his/her', 'childhood', 'he/she', 'repeating', 'pattern', 'etc', 'Nothing', 'that.I', 'was', 'misled', 'film', 'NOT', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'room', 'Most', 'important', 'parts', 'compose', 'real', 'plottake', 'place', 'dirty', 'utility', 'room', 'men', 'wake', 'up', 'cinematic', 'experiment', 'Leigh', 'Whannel', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'Adam', 'one', 'two', 'who', 'thrown', 'proverbial', 'pan', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Gordon', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'Whannel', 'cared', 'enough', 'write', 'very', 'complex', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'acting', 'times', 'acting', 'one', 'liners', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'would', 'think', 'guys', 'were', 'trying', 'out', 'part', 'high', 'school', 'play.The', 'real', 'substance', 'film', 'elsewhere', 'though', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer', 'particularly', 'volatile', 'concealed', 'psychopath', 'point', 'prove', 'more', 'legitimate', 'most', 'serial', 'killer', 'peers', 'people', 'should', 'appreciate', 'life', 'have', 'reasons', 'putting', 'most', 'horrendous', 'situations', 'locking', 'drug', 'addicts', 'head', 'time-bomb-vice', 'leaving', 'find', 'key', 'might', 'make', 'appreciate', 'face', 'more', 'might', 'shock', 'complacency', 'do', ""n't"", 'what', 'Wan', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'found', 'most', 'protagonists', 'so', 'boring', 'annoying', ""'re"", 'just', 'itching', 'know', 'more', 'killer', 'only', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'one', 'dimensional.Some', 'symbolism', 'unforgettable', 'really', 'deranged', 'puppet', 'killer', 'popping', 'up', 'crucial', 'moments', 'Samurai-esque', 'costume', 'when', 'attack', 'scene', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'who', 'little', 'sweat', 'obsess', 'get', 'throat', 'cut', 'partner', 'happen', 'Jigsaw', 'act', 'aftermath', 'so', 'sadistic', 'gruesome', 'people', 'theatre', 'screamed.The', 'ending', 'big', 'shocker', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'one', 'Worth', 'buying', 'when', 'DVD']",N/A

It is with great regret that I must inform all those curious souls who discern quality, that ""Saw"" is pretty much glorified trash.  It was a shock to see Danny Glover take part in this production, and a shame that even in this obscure flick, his part was reduced to the elemental obsessive cop personality.

Neither of them have any idea how they got there or why they would be there.In the course of trying to find a way to escape, they begin to discover clues and we start to learn about both characters via flashbacks. We all know they have a saw and that it won't cut through the chains, only their flesh. Is that the only possible way out? You know I can't answer that question. In fact, there's not much more of the story that I can really talk about safely.The only actor you've likely seen before it Danny Glover, and some of the other actors aren't quite up to par during some scenes. We know they are supposed to be expressing horror or terror in some scenes, but it sure looks like they are trying not to laugh. That's ok though, the situations and ideas behind this movie make up for those types of shortcomings. Special effects? Eh, not so hot. There are some really cool sets, but the blood/gore factor isn't nearly as high as we had hoped. You're gonna have to use your imagination on some things. Lack of a budget or purposeful decision by the director? I'm going with the lack of budget argument.One thing this movie does exceptionally well, and this is why it's getting 4 stars instead of 3, is setting you up on who the bad guy really is. They throw out some obvious fakers, and some subtle hints on others so you think you have it all figured out. Then WHAM, nope, wasn't that guy... what about?... WHAM... nope, not him, what about... you get the idea. Did I figure out the ending in advance? Yes, but not until right up til the end, and these days that deserves a boost in the ratings.This one isn't for the squeamish even though it's not as graphic as others would like you to think. I do recommend seeing it on the big screen, and if you take a date with you you can expect lots of arm squeezing and head ducking.

873522,A3116ITCY40DC6,B0006SSOHC,"John ""Ira""","[2, 5]","In a day, where many new age teen horror movies are being born. This is fresh air in dying lungs. The Grudge, the Ring and whatever pg-13 teeny horror trash flavor of the month is out lately; it can not hold a candle to the flame that has been the ""Saw"" franchise. I do enjoy this one slightly more than ""Saw 2"" simply because I really enjoyed the plot, two guys chained to the bathroom. There is the birth of the saw franchise. Leigh Whannel (Writer, Adam) and James Wan (Writer, Director) did a wonderful job, writing a horror movie that wore their influences on their sleeve yet showed their own present imagination. This movie (for better or worse in your opinion dear reader) shows prescence from such movies as Se7en and Cube (both films I enjoy) Another aspect I enjoy about this, is the atmosphere for which this film represents. It has a dark, grim and gritty atmosphere. The great select of which the scenes were shot at alongside the haunting musical composing of Charlie C. really help add to the darkness of this film. Even though, the plot has been discussed and picked at over again, I will do the same.The film begins with Adam, laying in a bathtub full of water, as he begins to wake up, the water drains from the tub and he pulls himself out. Only to find he has been chained in a bathroom with another man (Dr. Lawrence) and a dead man with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in another. So begins Saw. Throughout this film, we watch as Adam and Dr. Lawrence slowly stumble upon the sad truth as to watch has been done to them (and what could happen to them if they don't use their time wisely) and what could happen to their loved ones as well. As the story moves along Dr. Lawnrence is informed that his wife and child will be slain if he does not kill his new cellmate Adam. It is truly intense watching Dr. Lawrence slow spiral down the staircase of insanity as he finds of this outcome involving the murder of his wife and child. However, they do have help (unknowing to both sides) Detective David  Tapp (Danny Glover) has become obsessed with the Jigsaw case  and as time runs short for Adam and Lawrence, he quickly trys to come upon Jigsaw's new plan. However, we also see numerous flashback scenes involving Jigsaw's other ""play things"" Paul, Amanda and Mark. All whos outcome I will not spoil for you. In the end, it all comes down to one final gripping scene in which this all began. A dirty bathroom.This movie, means alot to me and is one of my all time favorites due to its message. It's one I think anybody could relate to. We're all human, we all have selfish moments in which we take for granted those we love, be it family, friends, signifigant other or whoever else. We all have extreme limits in which our body/mind will push ourselves to do extreme, violent and mind numbing acts to save ourselves and our loved ones. Many things in which we are rarely forced to do, due to the modern day society we live in. Jigsaw is a refreshing villian in a sense because he really isn't one. While obviously he is doing disturbing evil things, its not for the sake of doing disturing evil things. In fact their is a quote he made from Saw 2.""John: Seems to me that the knowledge of your sons impending death is causing you to act... Why is that we're only willing to do that, when a life is at stake?Eric Matthews: I've always loved my son, it has never changedJohn: No... no... It's changed now. You see, the knowledge of death... changes everything. If I were to tell you the exact date and time of your death... it would shatter everything.This sums up the Saw franchise very well. The knowledge of changeable pending death and our ability (or those which don't have it in some cases) to dig deep and do what has to be done to live another day. This is a unique and horror franchise and this is where it all started.

Cary Ewles wasn't that great either...okay, the acting in this movie isn't the best, but that isn't going to stop it from becoming a cult hit.so, is this dvd worth buying?  yes and no.  if you're into slasher movies and don't really care about plot holes or acting, then you will enjoy this movie and the extra features on the disc, mainly the commentary, which is mainly funny 'cause the two guys behind the movie just poke fun at their own creation the whole time.  if you DON'T enjoy violence (there really isn't that much actually shown, blood and guts i mean), then you probably won't like this.  if you fall into the second category, just rent it first.Saw is a decent attempt at something new, and it succeeds for the most part.  i hear Saw 2 is coming out this October (2005), and i can only hope that they learn some good cinematography in the meantime, cause all that hard rock crap was really getting on my nerves, and it really destroys any possibility of true...""horror"", if you will.  this dvd comes out tomorrow, and even if you've seen it in the theaters and liked it, rent it first, just to make sure it's worth owning and rewatching a million times before buying.  anyway, that's just my stupid advice.  i hope this helps at least one person.  sorry if not.",3,"cool case, decent movie, funny commentary",1108339200,"02 14, 2005",2005,3723,"['i', 'just', 'got', 'back', 'manager', 'house', 'already', 'dvd', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'how', 'got', 'already', 'anyway', 'i', 'watched', 'movie', 'theater', 'left', 'unhappy', 'decent', 'flow', 'parts', 'where', 'camera', 'hyperactive', 'crappy', 'rock', 'music', 'real', 'reason', 'were', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'camera', 'crappy', 'music', 'i', 'would', 'rate', 'movie', 'higher', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watch', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'i', ""'m"", 'right', 'dvd', 'pretty', 'good', 'deal', 'possibly', 'even', 'worth', 'buying', 'real', 'slasher', 'fans', 'cool', 'case', 'sadly', 'disc', ""n't"", 'really', 'saw', 'okay', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'damn', 'movie', 'here', 'plot', 'whole', 'thing', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'trapped', 'room', 'are', 'chained', 'pipes', 'big', 'ones', 'dead', 'guy', 'middle', 'room', 'apparently', 'blew', 'brains', 'out', 'gun', 'still', 'laying', 'hand', 'voice', 'intercom', 'system', 'men', 'what', 'do', 'goals', 'are', 'prisoners', 'doctor', 'Ewles', 'find', 'way', 'break', 'free', 'alotted', 'amount', 'ot', 'time', 'shoot', 'other', 'guy', 'dead', 'man', 'gun', 'can', 'use', 'saws', 'find', 'cut', 'ankles', 'get', 'free', 'probably', 'bleed', 'death', 'then', 'whole', 'flashback', 'world', 'serial', 'puzzler', 'people', 'try', 'get', 'appreciate', 'lives', 'will', 'die', 'whole', 'drama', 'involving', 'cops', 'doctor', 'family', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'get', 'pretty', 'typical', 'hint', 'originality', 'once', 'while', 'are', 'parts', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'chuckle', 'not', 'good', 'reasons', 'i', 'think', 'only', 'really', 'jumped', 'one', 'time', 'whole', 'movie', 'i', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', ""n't"", 'count', 'are', 'pretty', 'neat', 'aspects', 'movie', 'good', 'gritty', 'scenes', 'overall', 'Seven/Se7en', 'leftovers.anyway', 'pretty', 'funny', 'commentary', 'two', 'guys', 'wrote', 'movie', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'names', 'James', 'Wan', 'somebody', 'Leigh', 'something', 'one', 'was', 'movie', 'other', 'directed', 'understand', 'how', 'acting', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'when', 'talk', 'only', 'having', '18', 'days', 'shoot', 'movie', 'having', 'use', 'rehearsal', 'actual', 'footage', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'parts', 'movie', 'mainly', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'parts', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'how', 'bad', 'acting', 'Cary', 'Ewles', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'okay', 'acting', 'movie', ""n't"", 'best', ""n't"", 'going', 'stop', 'becoming', 'cult', 'hit.so', 'dvd', 'buying', 'yes', ""'re"", 'slasher', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'plot', 'holes', 'acting', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'extra', 'features', 'disc', 'mainly', 'commentary', 'mainly', 'funny', 'two', 'guys', 'movie', 'just', 'poke', 'fun', 'own', 'creation', 'whole', 'time', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'enjoy', 'violence', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'actually', 'shown', 'blood', 'guts', 'i', 'mean', 'then', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'fall', 'second', 'category', 'just', 'rent', 'decent', 'attempt', 'something', 'new', 'most', 'part', 'i', 'hear', 'Saw', '2', 'coming', 'out', 'October', '2005', 'i', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'learn', 'good', 'cinematography', 'meantime', 'cause', 'hard', 'rock', 'crap', 'was', 'really', 'getting', 'nerves', 'really', 'possibility', 'true', 'horror', 'will', 'dvd', 'out', 'tomorrow', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'theaters', 'liked', 'rent', 'first', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'worth', 'owning', 'rewatching', 'million', 'times', 'buying', 'anyway', 'just', 'stupid', 'advice', 'i', 'hope', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'sorry', 'not']",N/A

He is not a serial killer per se, but someone who puts people in situations where they kill themselves and others.  Each victim finds themselves in tense situation where they have to make hard decisions regarding what they will do to go on living.  The main story concerns two individuals who awaken in an abandoned bathroom chained and confused.  In the middle of the room is a dead body in a spreading pool of blood.  There is a gun and a tape player, both out of reach.  But each of the two men have found a cassette with the words Play Me on them.The to men discover the game they are part of.  If successful, one of them will be dead.  If not, certain loved ones will die instead.  There are rules to be followed.  As the two become more and more desperate, we learn more about them and the evil mind that has put them in this situation.  Although the two are the center of the story, we also get tied up with several other victims and the police investigation.  The action get more and more tense as the time limit is almost reached.  In the end the story delivers with a series of twists at the end that just leave you stunned.  A very good film.This two-disk edition has some interesting features including the original short film that was expanded into the current film.

But for every really solid effort in the horror genre there are about 10 terrible entries that give the genre a bad name, most of these inferior entries consist of sequels to average or above average horror movies that are made for nothing more than cashing in on the original film's success and hopefully making a little money before fading quickly from the public's memory. In 2004, amidst a crop of forgettable horror releases, one horror movie caught audiences completely by surprise with its in-your-face brand of terror that hadn't been seen in most horror films, with a surprisingly strong story that was full of twists and turns that would make any mystery fan happy, and a fairly solid cast of actors that didn't consist of fresh-faced teenagers that barely have any acting experience. The movie I'm referring to was the smash hit ""Saw"" from director James Wan (""Death Sentence""), and starring Danny Glover (`Lethal Weapon' series), Cary Elwes (""Robin Hood: Men in Tights""), and Monica Potter (""Along Came a Spider"").""Saw"" focuses on a deranged serial killer who feels that it is his mission in life to teach those who take life for granted a lesson by capturing them and forcing them to choose between fighting for their lives by surviving horrifying circumstances or giving up and dying. His latest victims are a successful doctor (Cary Elwes) and a young photographer (Leigh Whannell, who also wrote the screenplay). These two unwitting participants in the killer's twisted game must try to work together to solve the mystery of why they are being held captive, while determining the means of their escape from certain death. Meanwhile, a former detective (Danny Glover) is trying to put the pieces together regarding the last case he was working when he left the force, which unbeknownst to him is directly linked to the two captives who may soon become the latest victims of this methodical killer, with a simple message of, ""Live or die, make your choice.""This is one of those movies that I was a little mixed in my opinion of. The first time I watched ""Saw"" I didn't really care for it all that much, I thought that it was a better than average entry into the horror genre, but was trying too hard to cross genres with being a horror film and also a thriller in the vein of ""Se7en"". But after watching ""Saw"" for a second time, I feel it was a much better horror movie than I initially believed it to be, and was also an adequate mystery thriller that set itself apart from most horror films by actually having a decent story and not relying on some supernatural killer, that for some unknown reason audiences are intrigued by, to propel the movie forward. In fact, you barely even see the killer in this movie, which is even more surprising for a horror film these days, having a modern horror film that actually leaves its killer shrouded in mystery is unheard of, and was very much appreciated here.Now, some of you may be wondering where I came up with the comparison of ""Saw"" and ""Se7en"", well here it is. Both movies feature villains who feel it is their sole purpose in life to teach others a lesson about what they've done wrong in their lives. Both villains are patient, smart, and incredibly deranged in their view of the world, and feel completely justified in the pain they inflict upon their victims. I also feel that director James Wan was aware of this comparison, and purposely paid homage to ""Se7en"" with the use of the exact same type of notebooks that were used by the killer in the movie ""Se7en"" spread all over Danny Glover's apartment in this movie. With all the various types of notebooks out there why choose that same exact one, unless you were meaning for people to recognize it, and therefore draw comparisons. Now, James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell may not have intended for there to be as much comparison between the two films as I have seen, but the similarities are there all the same. With all that being said, I don't feel that ""Saw"" as a film, suffers from its similarity to ""Se7en"" (granted its not as strong of a mystery thriller as the latter, but it's adequate), the two films are different enough in their execution (no pun intended) that the similarity is nothing more than an obvious influence for their story.The actors were of a much higher caliber than one normally expects from horror films these days. Generally the cast of horror films consists of some of the newest actors Hollywood has to offer, and generally will focus heavily on talk of sex and feature plenty of nudity from its attractive leading ladies, thus ensuring plenty of teenagers (especially guys) will give the movie a generous box office return and maybe even repeat business. But, ""Saw"" went a different route by casting veteran actors such as Danny Glover and Cary Elwes, along with the not as well known Monica Potter to bring their characters to life. Most of the cast were very effective in their roles, even screenwriter Leigh Whannell as the other man trapped with Cary Elwes, was surprisingly good as an actor. But the weakest link in the acting chain was Cary Elwes. For an actor who has been around as long as he has, it's kind of a surprise that he's never managed to elevate his craft from anything more than that of an average actor who has a tendency to overact in his dramatic parts, but excels when it comes to comedy which is probably why ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" and ""The Princess Bride"" are the two biggest movies of his career. The decision to give Cary top-billing for this movie seemed odd, since he's not that big of a name, and from a talent perspective, I figured they would have given that honor to Danny Glover, but I'm not the one making those decisions.One more thing regarding this movie that also further set it apart from most movies of this genre is the lack of blood and gore that was actually seen in the film. Most horror films opt for putting as much blood and gore on the screen as they possibly can, leaving nothing to the imagination, and frankly most audiences are numb to it at this point. But ""Saw"" went with the approach of implied gore; yes, there were moments of bloodshed on the screen but not much more than what is shown in an all-out action movie. Although the blood and gore were implied, the film still delivers on the horror, by forcing the audience to envision in their heads what could have taken place onscreen. However, in place of actual blood and gore, the director and writer included plenty of disturbing traps and images, along with creepy music and quick, frantic editing, that gave the audience the impression that the film was much more violent and gory than it actually was which may cause some viewers to dislike the film due to an implied sense of an overabundance of gratuitous graphic violence.""Saw"" is without a doubt a very creepy horror film that delivers plenty of chills, but also gives audiences a solid story that will keep them guessing what will happen next. A word to parents, this is one horror film that's rating should definitely be heeded, as I don't feel that viewers under the age of 17 should see this movie without parental approval.""Saw"" is available in both rated R and unrated editions both contain violence and language.",4,Let the Games Begin...,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,7579,"['Horror', 'films', 'are', 'definitely', 'mixed',

This is just a culmination of 12 other movies, one that was good, some that were mediocre, some that were, well, not so good, but the end result is one of the worst movies ever made, it sucked. First off the whole feeling of the film is of one of those low budget, straight to video, serial killer, B movies. The lighting, anywhere else but the bathroom sucked, the acting was below par and frankly sucked, the short 45 sec. car chase scene, was one of the cheapest, cheesiest scenes I've ever seen in my entire life and frankly the editor and the director should be ashamed for having it in the finished product. I mean, just because you shoot a guy in a car with high speed film and make them move around so the finished product is herky jerky and chaotic looking, does not mean that its a cheaper alternative thats just as good, it in fact means that you've achieved to project yet another B grade effect, lending an amateurish prose for your film.The only reason that I gave this movie even a star, was because it does have a surprise ending. Not a thought provoking one like Se7en, which is thought invoking on many moral and ambiguous levels (which I think this director really tried to unsuccessfully imulate), no its just one of those endings where you go, ""Oh,"" and move one with your life and don't give it another thought, unless your retarded and in which case you'll still be talking about it a week after you saw it (in which case you'll inadvertantly talk thousands of intelligent people into watching this (...).

873539,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B0006SSOHC,Kaya Savas,"[11, 18]","MOVIE: Wow, what a horrible movie.  I really mean it.  I haven't seen a movie so bad in such a long time.  An interesting premise and a very well put trailer would lead you to believe that this movie follows in the footsteps of Se7en.  Let me tell you how much of a joke this movie is.  Well, here is the plot, two guys wake up in a bathroom chained up to the wall and are being tormented by the Jigsaw killer.  A madman who actually gets the victims to kill themselves.  Interesting? Yeah it is. So what wen't wrong? Well the number one problem here was the acting, oh my god the acting.  I am going to say it here and now that this movie had some of the worst acting I have ever seen in my life. That goes for you too Danny Glover, shame on you.  You wanna know how bad the acting was? The acting was so bad that the entire audience was laughing at the film's climax, which was supposed to be the tensest scene in the movie.  The dialogue was so utterly horrible, so laughable. This movie follows the same goddamn formula that every psychological thriller does, except here there is absolutely no point to it.  Every psychologocal thriller has a ""big twist"" at the end, it's a must, but when the twist is the stupidest thing in the movie that has no connection to any of the characters then your movie has failed.  I didn't guess the ending, I knew it was coming, but I didn't figure it out.  The only reason I didn't figure it out was that there were no clues for the audience to pick off of, the plot is so literal and meaningless that they forgot to throw in the meaningful dialogue and visuals. There is only one scene in the movie that would allow you to figure out the ending, but the way it was done was so the filmmaker's made sure that the audience wouldn't pick up on it.  When I go see a thriller I want the filmmakers to outsmart and outwit me so I get a big slap in the face when the end comes and I say to myself ""my god why didn't I see that in the first place"".  Saw is a case where the filmmakers are too stupid to make a witty and clever plot so they fill it up with gore.  When a movie has a scene where a guy trips on a wire to trigger 6 shotguns to fire onto his head you know that the filmmakers are too stupid to come up with anything else.  This was the biggest joke I have ever seen and I am pissed at myself for going into this movie thinking it would be good.  I'm pissed because I know that the movie's marketing campaign worked on me and I fell victim to it.ACTING: You would see better acting from a blind mime.BOTTOM LINE: Not scary, not disturbing, not fun to watch.  The audience knows exactly where the plot is going except they will have no idea who the killer is because the filmmakers won't allow it, that way they are sure that its a surprise for the audience at the end.

It reminded me of my idea of myself probably being a victim of some superhuman power that controls my life. I'm the creator of Superultramodern Science (SS) / Philosophy(SP) and the inventor of the NSTP (Non - Spatial Thinking Process) theory. The theory, sometimes in conjunction with some other ideas in SS, implies that (probably) space is a form of illusion to non-spatial mind, and the human beings, including everything apparently conscious, I see, and I ever saw and shall see, around could simply be zombies, i.e. mere spatial images with no corresponding states of consciousness. My life is therefore a game which shall end in my death at some age (hopefully because of old age). However, to avoid that sort of end I must change the nature of the game, the design of my life, by controlling my states of consciousness. And the way to do this might be meditation. While  watching the film I really thought that `saw is life...'. (However, it doesn't really make much sense to tell you this because if, by chance, you are conscious you would know that I'm wrong and if you are not conscious then there is no point in telling my ideas to a zombie as s/he is just a spatial image with no possibility of understanding anything.

These sources are either extrinsic or intrinsic.  Intrinsic motivation stems from within a person while the extrinsic source is influence generated by someone or something else.  Whether the source is external or internal it also presents a further division in needs and desires.  Needs being what a person requires to survive, and desires illustrates what a person wants.  Saw presents situations where human motivation is put to the test in regards to survival and the desire to live.  However, the situation that Saw presents comes at a dreadful price, which will undoubtedly terrorize the audience's own consciousness and perception of human needs and desires.The opening of Saw introduces two characters chained to heavy pipes in an abandoned bathroom at some unknown location where no one can hear them scream.  The room has intense lighting once the lights are turned on, which tosses no shadows of either character. In essence, it is a visual analogy for how their persona will be scrutinized by both parties, as the light will reveal everything.  Quickly one of the men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), questions why they are there because if someone desired them dead it could have been accomplished long ago.When the light is turned on for the first time, Adam (Leigh Whannell), discovered that he is not alone in the room, as between him and Dr. Gordon there is a corpse with a gun in it's hand and a tape recorder in the other.  It seems as if the corpse has blown away part of his own cranium with the gun in his hand.  Under the intense light the two chained men begin to search for ways of escaping, while they begin to discover small clues of what is expected out of them.It seems as if Adam is expected to kill himself, which he finds out through a tape that he finds in his own pocket.  Dr. Gordon discovers a similar tape and a bullet in his pocket that expresses anticipation in regards to Dr. Gordon who is expected to murder his new roommate.  The two men have a little more than six hours to find a solution to their deadly predicament.  During these six hours the audience is drawn into a number of flashbacks that provide information of how they were chosen to participate in this sick game.  It is also revealed that Dr. Gordon is aware of who the person is that has chained them in the unfamiliar room.Through Dr. Gordon it is disclosed that a serial killer that goes by the nickname Jigsaw has taken them hostage and chained them.  The killer himself has never actually killed someone, however, he has planned some truly grotesque schemes that have led to a tormenting death that has delivered pain of inconceivable magnitude.  The great extent to which the Jigsaw killer has planned his bizarre schemes will display a man with enormous amount motivation to seek some form of enlightenment in an outmost horrific manner.Saw dwells in the twilight land as it offers the audience a haunting journey that plunges deep into the darkness of the human psyche where nothing is sacred, as human motivation to live is skewed by an external source.  A mind to generate such horrors illustrates deep insights into psychology and human behavior, but it also displays the eccentricity of a creative mind.  James Wan and Leigh Whannell who created the story together offer a horror tale that evokes nightmares and difficult sleeping patterns in retrospect of the cinematic experience.The film had a good beginning theme, however, after about an hour and ten minutes the film seemed to begin slowly spiral downwards.  Nonetheless, Saw offers a truly ghastly film experience, which is built on good script and good mise-en-scene that helps enhance the terror in the story.  The camera work elevates the film, as it brings moments to the audience that will awaken feelings of revulsion and dismay.  In the end, do not expect a good night sleep, as Saw will haunt the mind for sometime after the end credits have been burnt into the retina of the audience.",3,Saw Will Interrupt Sleeping Patterns...,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,4067,"['nature', 'human', 'motivation', 'usually', 'two', 'different', 'sources', 'elicit', 'certain', 'behavior', 'sources', 'are', 'extrinsic', 'intrinsic', 'Intrinsic', 'motivation', 'person', 'extrinsic', 'source', 'influence', 'generated', 'someone', 'something', 'else', 'source', 'external', 'internal', 'also', 'further', 'division', 'needs', 'desires', 'being', 'what', 'person', 'survive', 'what', 'person', 'Saw', 'situations', 'where', 'human', 'motivation', 'put', 'test', 'regards', 'survival', 'desire', 'live', 'However', 'situation', 'Saw', 'dreadful', 'price', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'terrorize', 'audience', 'own', 'consciousness', 'perception', 'human', 'needs', 'desires.The', 'opening', 'Saw', 'introduces', 'two', 'characters', 'chained', 'heavy', 'pipes', 'abandoned', 'bathroom', 'unknown', 'location', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'scream', 'room', 'intense', 'lighting', 'once', 'lights', 'are', 'turned', 'shadows', 'character', 'essence', 'visual', 'analogy', 'how', 'persona', 'will', 'be', 'scrutinized', 'parties', 'light', 'will', 'reveal', 'everything', 'Quickly', 'one', 'men', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Gordon', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'questions', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'someone', 'desired', 'dead', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'long', 'light', 'turned', 'first', 'time', 'Adam', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'discovered', 'not', 'alone', 'room', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'corpse', 'gun', 'hand', 'tape', 'recorder', 'other', 'corpse', 'blown', 'away', 'part', 'own', 'cranium', 'gun', 'hand', 'intense', 'light', 'two', 'chained', 'men', 'begin', 'search', 'ways', 'escaping', 'begin', 'discover', 'small', 'clues', 'what', 'expected', 'them.It', 'Adam', 'expected', 'kill', 'out', 'tape', 'own', 'pocket', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'similar', 'tape', 'bullet', 'pocket', 'anticipation', 'regards', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'who', 'expected', 'murder', 'new', 'roommate', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'six', 'hours', 'find', 'solution', 'deadly', 'predicament', 'six', 'hours', 'audience', 'drawn', 'number', 'flashbacks', 'provide', 'information', 'how', 'were', 'chosen', 'participate', 'sick', 'game', 'also', 'revealed', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'aware', 'who', 'person', 'chained', 'unfamiliar', 'room.Through', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'disclosed', 'serial', 'killer', 'nickname', 'Jigsaw', 'taken', 'hostage', 'chained', 'killer', 'never', 'actually', 'killed', 'someone', 'however', 'planned', 'truly', 'grotesque', 'schemes', 'have', 'led', 'tormenting', 'death', 'delivered', 'pain', 'inconceivable', 'magnitude', 'great', 'extent', 'Jigsaw', 'killer', 'planned', 'bizarre', 'schemes', 'will', 'display', 'man', 'enormous', 'amount', 'motivation', 'seek', 'form', 'enlightenment', 'outmost', 'horrific', 'manner.Saw', 'dwells', 'twilight', 'land', 'audience', 'haunting', 'journey', 'deep', 'darkness', 'human', 'psyche', 'where', 'nothing', 'sacred', 'human', 'motivation', 'live', 'skewed', 'external', 'source', 'mind', 'generate', 'such', 'horrors', 'deep', 'insights', 'psychology', 'human', 'behavior', 'also', 'eccentricity', 'creative', 'mind', 'James', 'Wan', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'who', 'created', 'story', 'together', 'offer', 'horror', 'tale', 'nightmares', 'difficult', 'sleeping', 'patterns', 'retrospect', 'cinematic', 'experience.The', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'beginning', 'theme', 'however', 'hour', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'seemed', 'begin', 'slowly', 'spiral', 'downwards', 'Nonetheless', 'Saw', 'truly', 'ghastly', 'film', 'experience', 'built', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'mise-en-scene', 'enhance', 'terror', 'story', 'camera', 'work', 'film', 'moments', 'audience', 'will', 'awaken', 'feelings', 'revulsion', 'dismay', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'Saw', 'will', 'haunt', 'mind', 'sometime', 'end', 'credits', 'have', 'been', 'burnt', 'retina', 'audience']",N/A

It is one of the best suspense thrillers since ""Seven"" and ""The Silence Of The Lambs""! I mean that with personal consideration for the film. It is inventive, well-executed, and, also, well-budgeted, as its production budget cost $1 million to make the movie and it is one of the best-looking movies this year. The story revolves about two men trapped in an old bathroom. Dr. Lawrence Gordon, played by Cary Elwes, is an oncologist. Adam, played by Leigh Whannell, is an photographer. Lawrence figures out that a serial killer named Jigsaw, that was involved with an murder investigation run by Detective David Tapp, played by Danny Glover and his partner, Detective Steven Sing, played by Ken Leung. Jigsaw has, somewhat, kidnapped them, and Lawrence and Adam find out that they are apart of a murderous game that Jigsaw gives to the victims that he kidnaps. Lawrence, also finds out that his wife, Allison, played by Monica Potter, and his daughter, Diana, played by Makenzie Vega, has been kidnapped by the same killer, as well. Lawrence and Adam, find out that Lawrence has to kill Adam by 6:00 p.m., or else, Diana and Allison will die, as well as, Lawrence and Adam. This is one of the best independent films in recent history and of all time. It is better than ""The Blair Witch Project"". Cary Elwes (who was recently seen on screen this year as Edgar in ""Ella Enchanted"" (2004) & on tv in ""The Riverman"" as serial killer Ted Bundy), does an well-executed performance as Lawrence, an man wrought with hard hitting emotion. Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the screenplay and co-wrote the story with its director, James Wan), does an pitch-perfect performance as Adam. Danny Glover (well known as Roger Murtagh in the Lethal Weapon movies) is superb as Tapp. The directing by James Wan is excellent. The story by Wan and Whannell is brilliant and the screenplay by Whannell is brilliant, as well. This is the way that screenplays for suspense thrillers should be written. It is inventive and well thoughtout. The music by Charlie Clouser (a producer for the rock group Nine Inch Nails) is excellent. The casting by Amy Lippens is excellent. The cinematography by David A.

These films were ""Twisted"" ""Taking Lives"" and ""Godsend."" The first two films were recent serial killer dramas that were not only weak, but were also erroneously--almost sacreligiously- compared to the brilliant ""Seven"". ""Godsend"" kept me from seeing ""Saw"" because it shattered my faith in anything released by LionsGate Films. I had inklings of the mediocrity of the studio's output while watching ""The Vampire Clan"" and it was re-enforced later by ""Open Water,"" but it was also the studio that brought us the extraordinary ""Frailty"" which led me to believe that those films may have been just mis-steps.""Saw"" began to restore my faith from its opening scene. It showed me that low budget films could still be creepy without resorting to shaky camera work and natural lighting. In other words, not repeating ""Open Water""'s aquatic Blair-witchery. But everything falls apart in the end. As the title of this review suggests, it is the most disappointing ending since ""The Village,"" but for the opposite reason. Audiences of ""The Village"" willingly suffered through the painfully dull bulk of the film, fully expecting to be rewarded by an intricate and crystalizing twist, only to be disappointed. Conversely, viewers of ""Saw"" would have been content with a merely satisfactory ending, rather than one that strove to be unneccessarily convoluted, and was ultimately confusing.",4,"The most disappointing ending since ""The Village""/ Changed my mind after watching ""Saw 3"" Nearly perfect now",1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,1466,"['considered', 'seeing', 'Saw', 'theater', 'previously', 'released', 'films', 'kept', 'skeptical', 'films', 'were', 'Twisted', 'Taking', 'Lives', 'Godsend', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'recent', 'serial', 'killer', 'dramas', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'weak', 'were', 'also', 'erroneously', 'almost', 'sacreligiously-', 'compared', 'brilliant', 'Seven', 'Godsend', 'kept', 'seeing', 'Saw', 'shattered', 'faith', 'anything', 'released', 'LionsGate', 'Films', 'had', 'inklings', 'mediocrity', 'studio', 'output', 'watching', 'Vampire', 'Clan', 'was', 're-enforced', 'later', 'Open', 'Water', 'was', 'also', 'studio', 'brought', 'extraordinary', 'Frailty', 'led', 'believe', 'films', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'mis-steps', 'Saw', 'began', 'restore', 'faith', 'opening', 'scene', 'showed', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'creepy', 'resorting', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'natural', 'lighting', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'repeating', 'Open', 'Water', 'aquatic', 'Blair-witchery', 'everything', 'falls', 'apart', 'end', 'title', 'review', 'most', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'Village', 'opposite', 'reason', 'Audiences', 'Village', 'willingly', 'suffered', 'painfully', 'dull', 'bulk', 'film', 'fully', 'expecting', 'be', 'rewarded', 'intricate', 'crystalizing', 'twist', 'only', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Conversely', 'viewers', 'Saw', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'content', 'merely', 'satisfactory', 'ending', 'rather', 'one', 'strove', 'be', 'unneccessarily', 'convoluted', 'was', 'ultimately', 'confusing']",N/A

Secondly, If I had the choice of seeing this movie again, or bashing my head in with a big blunt object, I would grab the biggest rock I could find and smash away. This movie is a disgrace, and I'll tell you why I think this in a second. Before I go any further though, let me just say that this movie does have some very morbid and graphic torture scenes, and it does have a few good scenes to make you jump, but that's about it at the very least. Now, I hate this movie for so many reasons that I can't even keep count, but mostly because it wasn't what I expected it to be, or what they hyped it up to be on the previews. If you're looking for a horror or scary movie to watch this definitely isn't the movie for you, but if you need a good laugh it's perfect. Afterall, I laughed my head off because some of that stuff was so cheesy. I don't really think the budget was really the major problem because there have been some brilliant movies that had small budgets, but I do think this movie was just written terrible. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the concept of this movie, but what I can't appreciate is the shabby way they put this movie together, and then smacked us in the face with that horrible ending. I'm sorry to spoil the ending for you if you haven't been fortunate enough to see this movie, but I gotta say that having an old man that was already dying turn out to be the insane killer at the end was pure GENIUS! I wonder who's bright idea that was. I felt so cheated by the time the movie ended I just sat there looking at the credits going they can't be serious. For crying out loud, they could've just kept the hospital orderly the killer if that's the best that they could do, and even that was too far-fetched.

873555,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006SSOHC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 6]","When I went to go see ""Saw"" late last night I was thinking ""saw"" as the past tense of see and not ""saw"" as the noun (""a hand or power tool or a machine used to cut hard material and equipped usually with a toothed blade or disk"") or as the verb (""to cut with a saw""). What was I thinking? ""Saw"" is in the Grand Guignol of ""Seven"" and ""The Bone Cutter,"" and apparently had to make some last minute cuts to avoid getting saddled with a NC-17 rating. That alone with give you an indication of what first time director James Wan and first time writer Leigh Whannell were going for in ""Saw,"" even with only $1.2 million to make the film and 18 days to shoot it.Adam (Leigh Whannell), a young man, wakes up underwater in a dark room with a chain around his ankle. He is not alone, and when the light come on he finds himself is what appears to be a long abandoned public restroom. At the other end is Lawrence (Cary Elwes), who is also chained to a pipe. On the floor in between them, out of their reach, is the corpse of a man who apparently killed himself with a gun. In his hand is a tape recorder. After becoming oriented to his strange surroundings, Adam discovers a plastic bag in his pocket, containing an envelope. Inside is a key and a small cassette tape with the words ""Play Me."" Let the game begin.Beyond that you really do not want to know that much about this before you see it, and given the dreck that passes for horror thrillers in recent years ""Saw"" is worth the seeing in the theater. The last time I actually went to see a film in this genre in a theater was probably ""Hannibal,"" and I have not had any reason to regret being selective in this regard. However, this is not going to be a date movie, but one for hardcore fans of the genre who prefer their DVD editions to be the director's unrated cut of the film. ""Saw"" is a film that works more in the world of horror films than it does in the real world, but that is certainly part for the genre at this point.The entire film does not take place in the abandoned restroom, although that is main arena. Lawrence knows something about the ""Jigsaw Killer,"" who has been constructing elaborate dances of death in which his victims have to try and save themselves. Only one victim has survived to date (Shawnee Smith), so it is possible to get out of this alive, just extremely difficult and we are treated to a couple of examples of where it did not go as well. Investigating the case are a couple of detectives, Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung), and the chronology of the film gets skewed as the present and the past become confused. The game also involves more than the two men chained to the wall, because Lawrence's wife, Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter, Diana (Makenzie Vega) are part of it as well.During the film's endgame things are moving fast enough that you probably will not be able to figure out how it will all play out even though ""Saw"" overplays the obvious red herring card. The film pushes one of my least favorite buttons a couple of time, which is when somebody has a gun on the villain and does not blow them away. If there is one thing we have learned from all of these movies it is that hesitating when you have the bad guy in your sights is never a good thing. I especially go through the roof when a trained law enforcement officer is pointing the gun right at the killer and the killer still gets away (even Clarice Starling is guilty of this sin in ""The Silence of the Lambs""). So there is some heavy handedness to Whannell's script that hopefully will be replaced by something more elegant when he and Wan make their recently announced ""Saw 2"" sequel for 2005.But ""Saw"" is not an elegant horror film, although Wan gets points for keeping the most horrific moment of the film off screen (even though the rationale is small budget and not true aesthetic choice, which makes me fearful for what will happen when Wan and Whannell have a much bigger budget for the sequel). The ""Jigsaw Killer"" has a warped interest in having his victims better appreciate their lives, so getting out alive has to do not only with Lawrence and Adam solving the tasks they are given, but also with finding out some important things about each other. The important thing here is that the film's final scene is pretty horrific, even if the film cheats a bit to get to that point, and that even when the screen goes dark and the credits start to roll, Whannell keeps the horror going.",4,"The ""Jigsaw Killer"" plays another bloody little game",1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,4460,"['When', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'Saw', 'late', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'thinking', 'saw', 'past', 'tense', 'see', 'not', 'saw', 'noun', 'hand', 'power', 'tool', 'machine', 'used', 'cut', 'hard', 'material', 'equipped', 'usually', 'toothed', 'blade', 'disk', 'verb', 'cut', 'saw', 'What', 'was', 'thinking', 'Saw', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'Seven', 'Bone', 'Cutter', 'apparently', 'had', 'make', 'last', 'minute', 'cuts', 'avoid', 'getting', 'saddled', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'alone', 'give', 'indication', 'what', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'first', 'time', 'writer', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'were', 'going', 'Saw', 'even', 'only', '1.2', 'million', 'make', 'film', '18', 'days', 'shoot', 'it.Adam', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'young', 'man', 'up', 'underwater', 'dark', 'room', 'chain', 'ankle', 'not', 'alone', 'when', 'light', 'come', 'what', 'be', 'long', 'abandoned', 'public', 'restroom', 'other', 'end', 'Lawrence', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'who', 'also', 'chained', 'pipe', 'floor', 'reach', 'corpse', 'man', 'who', 'apparently', 'killed', 'gun', 'hand', 'tape', 'recorder', 'becoming', 'oriented', 'strange', 'surroundings', 'Adam', 'plastic', 'bag', 'pocket', 'containing', 'envelope', 'Inside', 'key', 'small', 'cassette', 'tape', 'words', 'Play', 'Me', 'Let', 'game', 'begin.Beyond', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'know', 'that', 'much', 'see', 'given', 'dreck', 'horror', 'thrillers', 'recent', 'years', 'Saw', 'seeing', 'theater', 'last', 'time', 'actually', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'genre', 'theater', 'was', 'probably', 'Hannibal', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'reason', 'regret', 'being', 'selective', 'regard', 'However', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'date', 'movie', 'one', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'genre', 'who', 'prefer', 'DVD', 'editions', 'be', 'director', 'unrated', 'cut', 'film', 'Saw', 'film', 'more', 'world', 'horror', 'films', 'real', 'world', 'certainly', 'part', 'genre', 'point.The', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'abandoned', 'restroom', 'main', 'arena', 'Lawrence', 'something', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer', 'who', 'been', 'constructing', 'elaborate', 'dances', 'death', 'victims', 'have', 'try', 'save', 'Only', 'one', 'victim', 'survived', 'date', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'possible', 'get', 'alive', 'just', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'are', 'treated', 'couple', 'examples', 'where', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'well', 'Investigating', 'case', 'are', 'couple', 'detectives', 'Tapp', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Sing', 'Ken', 'Leung', 'chronology', 'film', 'skewed', 'present', 'past', 'become', 'confused', 'game', 'also', 'more', 'two', 'men', 'chained', 'wall', 'Lawrence', 'wife', 'Alison', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'daughter', 'Diana', 'Makenzie', 'Vega', 'are', 'part', 'well.During', 'film', 'endgame', 'things', 'are', 'moving', 'fast', 'enough', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'will', 'all', 'play', 'out', 'even', 'Saw', 'obvious', 'red', 'herring', 'card', 'film', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'buttons', 'couple', 'time', 'when', 'somebody', 'gun', 'villain', 'not', 'blow', 'away', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'learned', 'movies', 'hesitating', 'when', 'have', 'bad', 'guy', 'sights', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'especially', 'go', 'roof', 'when', 'trained', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'pointing', 'gun', 'right', 'killer', 'killer', 'still', 'away', 'even', 'Clarice', 'Starling', 'guilty', 'sin', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'heavy', 'handedness', 'Whannell', 'script', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'replaced', 'something', 'more', 'elegant', 'when', 'Wan', 'make', 'recently', 'announced', 'Saw', '2', 'sequel', '2005.But', 'Saw', 'not', 'elegant', 'horror', 'film', 'Wan', 'points', 'keeping', 'most', 'horrific', 'moment', 'film', 'screen', 'even', 'rationale', 'small', 'budget', 'not', 'true', 'aesthetic', 'choice', 'fearful', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'Wan', 'Whannell', 'have', 'much', 'bigger', 'budget', 'sequel', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer', 'warped', 'interest', 'having', 'victims', 'better', 'appreciate', 'lives', 'getting', 'out', 'alive', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'Lawrence', 'Adam', 'solving', 'tasks', 'are', 'given', 'also', 'finding', 'out', 'important', 'things', 'other', 'important', 'thing', 'here', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'pretty', 'horrific', 'even', 'film', 'bit', 'get', 'point', 'even', 'when', 'screen', 'dark', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', 'Whannell', 'horror', 'going']",N/A
873556,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0006SSOHC,Lawyeraau,"[2, 7]","This film, which was shot in a scant eighteen days, is stunningly original in concept. I confess that I was totally riveted to the screen for the entire running time of the  film, as was my son. Edgy and somewhat surreal, the film clearly demonstrates that the director, James Wan,  can certainly do more with less, as the film was shot on a shoestring budget. Yet, he also knows that less is sometimes more, as he keeps the actual  amount of on screen gore to a minimum. In doing so, he forces a viewer's imagination to work overtime, which serves to create more suspense than a visual statement of the obvious.The plot is diabolically clever. It appears that a maniac is on the loose, placing people in fiendish situations that are truly matters of life or death, virtually ensuring that someone dies. The deaths occur in a highly unusual manner, indicative of a complex and maniacal mind at work. Detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung) are on the case and hot on this maniac's trail. When on the verge of his capture, however, everything goes wrong, and Detective Tapp becomes somewhat unhinged after a total debacle ensues.Meanwhile, Dr.  Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), who was himself a suspect in the case, suddenly finds himself in a filthy, ancient, cavernous bathroom, along with a young man  named Adam (Leigh Whannell). Both are chained to pipes in the wall and are disoriented and unsure as to how they got there. Between them and just beyond their reach lies an apparently dead man in a pool of blood, ostensibly killed with the gun that he still holds in his hand. Then, Dr. Gordon and Adam discover that a series of cryptic  instructions have been left for them to follow.  Each instruction clearly delineates just how precarious their position is.What follows is a mesmerizing cat and mouse game, replete with a number of twists and turns, that is sure to keep the viewer enthralled. This is certainly a plot driven, rather than character driven, film. Therefore, although some of the acting is not of the highest caliber, it matters not, as it is the plot, and not the individual characterizations, that are at the central core of this gripping film. Moreover, the plot is so creative and riveting, that some of its flaws become virtually insignificant in the overall scheme of things.  The screenwriter, Leigh Whannell, who also plays the part of Adam, deserves kudos for his complex and clever screenplay. He deserves less than that for his portrayal of Adam. Mr. Whannell should concentrate on screenplay writing, as it is there that his true gift lies.

Director James Wan and screenwriter/actor Leigh Whannel have concocted a somber and gory illustration of The Jigsaw Man, a serial killer who doesn't really kill his victims per se, just gives them options to avoid death.  From its stark opening in a really repulsive bathroom to its jawdropping finale in the same room, SAW weaves an intricate tale.  Cary Elwes gives an unusual performance, one that is at times wooden and unbelievable and at other times, so erratic and tense, he becomes frighteningly realistic.  Screenwriter Whannel as Adam, the other prisoner, also vacillates from sheer incredulousness to harsh believability.  Danny Glover is oddly cast as a police detective who has become obsessed with the case; Monica Potter has the brief role of Elwes' endangered wife.

Not because I was afraid it would be gross, but because I've long since lost any interest of watching horror movies with an audience; movie horror audiences tend to be loud, scream at stupid things, and otherwise just plain irritating to anyone who wants to actually, ya know...enjoy the movie.Someone finally lent me Saw (thanks Matt!), so my wife and I got the chance to see it. This becomes problematic when you talk about the film to other people.  ""Did you see Saw?"" ""I saw Saw.""  ""You saw what?"" ""I said I saw Saw."" ""Stop repeating yourself..."" You get the picture.Anyway, the plot begins with Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) waking up in a nasty-looking bathroom.  A dead guy is in the center, apparently having blown his brains out.  In one hand is a gun, in the other a tape recorder.  Eventually, our two protagonists discover they have a tape in their pocket, and a lot more in common than they think.The first half of the movie unfolds in flashbacks as Gordon explains who they're up against.  Their nemesis is the serial killer known as Jigsaw.  Only he doesn't technically kill people; Jigsaw makes his victims kill themselves or each other. Jigsaw is a genius on the level of a Batman villain, a master of puppeteering, trap making, and disguise.If you've seen Se7en, you've seen most of what Saw's all about: the dark blue/green lens, the ever-present filth and grime, the weary black detective (in this case, Danny Glover). The difference is that Jigsaw's violent morality plays are considerably more contrived.That said, this is a film that revels as much in the psychological horror of the human condition as it does in gore.  What are you willing to do to save your life?  And assuming you're a paragon of morality...what would you do to save the lives of your family? Finding out how our protagonists answer those questions is half the fun.The movie has its flaws.  For one, poor Elwes still sounds like a Brit pretending to be an American with an aristocratic accent.  Glover doesn't seem to have much to do but growl.  And Jigsaw is a diabolical genius with a lot of time on his hands.By far Saw's biggest problem is that it's just plain cheap. The supposed car chase looks like two guys pretending to drive cardboard vehicles while making ""vroom vroom!"" noises.  Blood looks like ketchup.  Weird cut scenes skitter away from anything of substance, cleverly disguising the poor special effects with blinding headaches.  That's what you get for a $1.2 billion budget and an 18-day film shoot.Still, Saw managed to surprise me with its ending.  There's so much going on and so many plot twists that I wasn't expecting the sudden revelation of Jigsaw's identity.Is it gross?  Not really.  Other than the thought of how disgusting some things are, the ""wet"" factor is it relatively mild.  Is it scary?  Definitely. There's enough gruesome traps and awful choices that one of them is bound to strike a nerve with every viewer, enough to make your skin crawl.  In that respect, Saw is a resounding success.See Saw.

But, it's actually nothing like that surprisingly. This is a fresh feel to a horror movie, probably seen before, but hasn't been done to death over the past few years.The movie starts off a bit confusing, but you pick up on whats going on. It starts off showing the two main actors, already stuck in their prison that the villain has placed them in. They're locked in chains, have no idea how they got there and don't know what is going on.

Also it follows a story of an ex-cop played by Danny Glover who is on the hunt for the ""Jigsaw"" killer.

873586,A300FZS4M8ZG7N,B0006SSOHC,miktek,"[1, 3]","Being a horror fan i have to say that this movie met any expectations i had and had a psycological impact that i have not experienced from a good horror film for some time.Overall production is slick and dark with great overtones of meance and horror, which is an achivement when one thinks that this is a very low budget flick with some  b to d grade actors (Glover and Ewles). Overall i thought the acting is good and though i agree that Ewles acting was limited i wonder if this is the fault of the director and pacing more than his overall acting ability.However, within the premise of the film and with so much else going on you really don't notice the acting faults unless your being quite picky.I find it remarkable that a film can be dripping with so much dread that you will find yourself contiually thinking "" what would i do"" and the charaters then do it and in many cases without success (though i don't know if i would have even attempt to climb through a container full of razor sharp wire, id think id rather stave too death but then desperate people do desperate things and one only truely knows what they would do if they were in that situation).The flashback of past crimes committed by the Jigsaw killer were quick but very effective and for a die hard horror fan like me , it still gave me the creeps to watch.Overall i though the plot was well developed  and easy to follow and the killer had way more meance to me than John Doe from Seven. And the ending for SAW is far less predictable than Seven. I guessed before the ending of Seven what would happen and i was right. There was too much build up to the ending . I knew when i saw the postal truck that it was gunna be his wife in a box and i then guessed that he would kill John Doe and i then guessed this was envy the final kill, all too predictable.However, SAW is one movie that i did not guess the ending correctly and was blown away (no matter how inconceivable the situation seems). Infact the ending did make sense to me because the killer is both mature and caultating and able to develop elborate plans to make his victims suffer. Meaning that he has the patience of a saint and is able to remain in control, cool calm and collective (and im sure there are killers out there like this , i mean there must be more serial killers than just the ones that get caught and are known to the public. It becomes a profession to a certain extent and with each kill they build there level of experience - so by the time yah over 40 and got away with it, you must be getting pretty good at the profession of killing and torturing). Therefore , it makes sense to me that he was able to do what he did. The ending, for me was a swift punch to the gut and even days after seeing it i think about it.The film is advertised as a thriller and it certainly has those elements but clearly it does fit into the world of horror more and this suits the overall film. Horror fans should get a kick out of it while the more mainstream audience should enjoy the thriller aspects but may be a bit let down by over anaylising the horror elements. The killer does come across as a bit indestructiable and the scene with the two cops in the killers lair does start to edge on stupid as they basically allow the guy walk out of the building ( i mean come on, at least shoot the guy in the leg to stop him from being so mobile) but once again try to remeber that the killer has prob spent all his life gaining control and patience to be able to pull off some really elborate kills and escapes.Overall, a very good horror/thriller that deserves more regonision than it gets and i look forward to seeing SAW 2 and finding out more about the man who likes to play games.*GAME OVER*",4,A great horror title !!!!!!,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,3731,"['Being', 'horror', 'fan', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'met', 'expectations', 'i', 'had', 'had', 'psycological', 'impact', 'i', 'have', 'not', 'experienced', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'time.Overall', 'production', 'slick', 'dark', 'great', 'overtones', 'meance', 'horror', 'achivement', 'when', 'one', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'b', 'd', 'grade', 'actors', 'Glover', 'Ewles', 'Overall', 'i', 'thought', 'acting', 'good', 'i', 'agree', 'Ewles', 'acting', 'was', 'limited', 'i', 'wonder', 'fault', 'director', 'pacing', 'more', 'overall', 'acting', 'ability.However', 'premise', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'going', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'acting', 'faults', 'being', 'quite', 'picky.I', 'find', 'remarkable', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'dripping', 'so', 'much', 'dread', 'will', 'find', 'contiually', 'thinking', 'what', 'would', 'i', 'do', 'charaters', 'then', 'do', 'many', 'cases', 'success', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'attempt', 'climb', 'container', 'full', 'razor', 'sharp', 'wire', 'id', 'think', 'rather', 'stave', 'too', 'death', 'then', 'desperate', 'people', 'do', 'desperate', 'things', 'one', 'only', 'truely', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'situation', 'flashback', 'past', 'crimes', 'committed', 'Jigsaw', 'killer', 'were', 'quick', 'very', 'effective', 'die', 'hard', 'horror', 'fan', 'still', 'gave', 'creeps', 'watch.Overall', 'i', 'plot', 'was', 'well', 'developed', 'easy', 'follow', 'killer', 'had', 'way', 'more', 'meance', 'John', 'Doe', 'Seven', 'ending', 'SAW', 'far', 'less', 'predictable', 'Seven', 'guessed', 'ending', 'Seven', 'would', 'happen', 'i', 'was', 'right', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'build', 'ending', 'knew', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'postal', 'truck', 'was', 'gunna', 'be', 'wife', 'box', 'i', 'then', 'guessed', 'would', 'kill', 'John', 'Doe', 'i', 'then', 'guessed', 'was', 'envy', 'final', 'kill', 'too', 'predictable.However', 'SAW', 'one', 'movie', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'guess', 'ending', 'correctly', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'matter', 'how', 'inconceivable', 'situation', 'Infact', 'ending', 'did', 'make', 'sense', 'killer', 'mature', 'caultating', 'able', 'develop', 'elborate', 'plans', 'make', 'victims', 'suffer', 'Meaning', 'patience', 'saint', 'able', 'remain', 'control', 'cool', 'calm', 'collective', 'im', 'sure', 'are', 'killers', 'there', 'i', 'mean', 'must', 'be', 'more', 'serial', 'killers', 'just', 'ones', 'get', 'caught', 'are', 'known', 'public', 'profession', 'certain', 'extent', 'kill', 'build', 'level', 'experience', 'so', 'time', 'yah', '40', 'got', 'away', 'must', 'be', 'getting', 'pretty', 'good', 'profession', 'killing', 'torturing', 'Therefore', 'sense', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'ending', 'was', 'swift', 'punch', 'gut', 'even', 'days', 'seeing', 'i', 'think', 'it.The', 'film', 'advertised', 'thriller', 'certainly', 'elements', 'clearly', 'fit', 'world', 'horror', 'more', 'suits', 'overall', 'film', 'Horror', 'fans', 'should', 'get', 'kick', 'more', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'should', 'enjoy', 'thriller', 'aspects', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'anaylising', 'horror', 'elements', 'killer', 'come', 'bit', 'indestructiable', 'scene', 'two', 'cops', 'killers', 'lair', 'start', 'edge', 'stupid', 'basically', 'allow', 'guy', 'walk', 'building', 'i', 'mean', 'come', 'least', 'shoot', 'guy', 'leg', 'stop', 'being', 'so', 'mobile', 'once', 'again', 'try', 'remeber', 'killer', 'prob', 'spent', 'life', 'gaining', 'control', 'patience', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'really', 'elborate', 'kills', 'escapes.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'horror/thriller', 'more', 'regonision', 'i', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'SAW', '2', 'finding', 'out', 'more', 'man', 'who', 'play', 'games', '*GAME', 'OVER*']",N/A

This is one of the best suspense horror movies in recent years, and hopefully SAW II will be no different.SAW tells the tale of a serial murderer known as the ""jigsaw killer"" who decides to kidnap two men, one is a doctor who is married to a beautiful wife and has children with her, while the other man seems very insignificant to us, not bearing any importance or meaning to us in the movie, except that he committed some kind of heinous act according to the the killer. Both of these men are put in dank room with dirty white walls and a mysterious body lying in the middle of the room (and we're to believe that it's dead). The doctor (played by Cary Elwes) is handcuffed by the ankle to a fixture, and the other man is handcuffed by his wrist, and this ultimately becomes the precursor of an evergrowing race to break free and stop the killer himself. The jigsaw killer is committing a series of grisly killings, all the while tormenting the two men he has trapped. The movie's tension builds and paramounts into a shocking and grisly climax that ultimately descends into the movie's surprise ending...you will never see this coming, trust me.

The only downside side is the acting by the two guys in the room chained to the pipes. The acting by the two is fairly good through the first half of the film, but it gets worse when they are in panic mode. The ending blew me away and easily makes up for the small flaws of the film.

A compelling sereal killer, some graphic violence, that creepy laughing clown ... how could you go wrong?For starters, the acting is awful. It's sad to watch Cary Elwes absolutely mail in a performance like this - he had such verve and charisma in ""The Princess Bride,"" but here he seems very ill-suited and even a little bored. Leigh Whannell is only slightly more convincing as his cell-mate. Danny Glover is Danny Glover. He's an effective character actor, and he could have been used to much greater effect here.Then the directing. This might just be my personal taste, but the nonstop MTV type sound blurts and quick-cut camera effect is badly overused in many movies, and it seems particularly inappropriate for the horror genre. It's been done before, and in ""Saw"" it manages to crush any atmosphere or suspense.And finally, the plot. ""Saw"" clearly draws its inspiration from ""Seven,"" with a little bit of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""The Cell"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" thrown in for good measure. The movie makes the mistake of being far more clever than it needs to be - tacking on badly contrived and unlikely twists to an already shaky plot.Note to Hollywood directors: A ""twist"" is only satisfying if it makes logical sense within the context of the picture. When you pull some minor non-character out of a totally unrelated scene and make him the most important player in the movie for no other reason than to surprise the audience, we won't care. And I didn't.But what annoyed me most about ""Saw"" was its self-serious attitude. A less proficient director probably could've turned this material into cheesy high camp. Instead, ""Saw"" is so heavy-handed and devoid of fun that I seriously considered turning it off midway through.Two stars for some graphic violence, a rarity in mainstream horror films these days.

873596,A2XVA2OGDYKKD,B0006SSOHC,Monsieur Valentine,"[6, 21]","This movie fails in so many ways.Firstly, Im not a big fan of serial killer movies, because the glorification of these monsters is quite frankly dangerous. Not that our society is incapable of differentiating reality from fiction, but for the odd few sick people (high on drug of choice) these graphically detailed manuscripts could incite all sorts of behaviour. It sickens me sometimes, to think the creators will reap financial rewards unimaginable, knowing that for a minority of people such encounters have been a real life event. Could you imagine yourself tied up and having to watch your child be abused.... where is the fascination... obviously there is a fascination... because the stories have spilled onto prime time 1-hour television...So two novices wanted to make a movie... and came up with the idea of doing the whole thing in a room in order to meet their budget. Its not the first time (even though they claim otherwise), the movie CUBE is loosely based on the same concept and in all fairness did a better job.They threw in Danny Glover and spent wisely in the advertising department. Now... this amateurish project has sweeped the box office.And so what do you get...The concept turns on itself. Thirty minutes into the movie... and your pleading for them to die already. You see the punchlines... and realise anything remotely intriguing about this movie was said and done along time ago, when you read a review in the newspaper, or saw a commerical on television, or preview on some talk show.Beyond the concept of two men in a room, the story keeps to the generic serial killer plot. Time is ticking... family is involved.. Cop's partner dies... Cop takes it personally... blah blah blah...And in the end... comes the twist everyone is waiting for... You know its going to come... and so what. Ever since SIXTH SENSE, majority of thrillers try so hard to hit us with a twist, and it disappoints everytime. And it seems, as we become more desensitised and cluey about twists, the plots have to become more unbelievable... and believe me... this one is unbelievable... to the point where its pathetically flawed.The dead guy, lying in between the two idiots was the murderer all that time... So either our beloved doctor is seriously incompetent or MR. SAW was able to hold his breath for 5hours.And the suspect was forced to tie up the doctors family (and enjoy it mind you), because he was another victim, posioned...Isnt that a little bit out of character... the way he hid in the girls closet... ""your mine!"", the way he waved to the camera ""I can see you""... this guy is supposed to be a victim!Sometimes I wonder... but then again...

The question was should she see Saw by the seashore?Actually, beyond some puns, I'm not positive of the merit of this movie.  It is clever, probably too clever for its own good.  The story focuses on a serial killer who puts his victims in elaborate traps which over a minimal chance of escape.  Two men wake up to find themselves chained in a dingy bathroom in an abandoned building.  The only means of freedom are some rusty hacksaws which are just sharp enough to cut off a bound foot.Through flashback, we are introduced to an obsessed detective who is pursuing this killer.  While bright enough to pick up tiny clues, he is also inept enough to wander into this genius killer's lair without a real plan or backup (beyond a single partner).  This allows the killer to get away and engineer his next trap.Fortunately, there are not very many of these ""dumb"" moments, and in reality, the biggest problem with the movie is its convoluted nature.  For most of the movie, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not, and knew it would come down to the inevitable final twist, which was neither good nor bad enough to generate any real reaction.One mark of a good movie is when you forget you're watching a movie:  with all the stylized direction and overly clever plotting, it's hard to get that absorbed in this film.  This is an interesting movie and not really a bad one, but it's also imperfect.  It also owes a lot to other movies, especially Seven, and you might be better off seeing those movies.  See Saw?

Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","Back in 2004, Lion's Gate released an ultra low budget yet very inventive horror film that spawned one of the most profitable horror franchises in the past decade.  The original Saw draws inspiration from older slasher and exploitation films with some great ideas of it's own.  Two, seemingly unrelated men (Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell) wake up in chains with a hacksaw between them.  They both are caught in a game weaved by a serial killer called Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) who claims to have their families captive.  In the meantime, a desperate cop (Danny Glover) is on the killer's trail, and it's safe to say that no one gets out of this in one piece.  It took me a while to check out Saw, as I'm not very much into what's considered modern horror movies.  However, it was good to see a new age horror film that takes advantage of the genre by offering up gallons of blood and gore to go along with stomach churning set pieces.  If there's anything bad to say about Saw, it's that the acting is very wooden, there's plenty of leaps in logic, and the first is definitely the best.  All in all, if you've never seen the original Saw, it's better than you might think, and definitely worth checking out, particularly for older horror fans missing that bite that the horror films of years gone bye were infamous for.",4,The beginning,1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,1323,"['Back', '2004', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'released', 'ultra', 'low', 'budget', 'yet', 'very', 'inventive', 'horror', 'film', 'spawned', 'one', 'most', 'profitable', 'horror', 'franchises', 'past', 'decade', 'original', 'Saw', 'inspiration', 'older', 'slasher', 'exploitation', 'films', 'great', 'ideas', 'own', 'Two', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'men', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'co-writer', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'wake', 'up', 'chains', 'hacksaw', 'are', 'caught', 'game', 'weaved', 'serial', 'killer', 'called', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'who', 'have', 'families', 'captive', 'meantime', 'desperate', 'cop', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'killer', 'trail', 'safe', 'say', 'one', 'one', 'piece', 'took', 'while', 'check', 'out', 'Saw', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'considered', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'However', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'new', 'age', 'horror', 'film', 'advantage', 'genre', 'offering', 'up', 'gallons', 'blood', 'gore', 'go', 'along', 'stomach', 'churning', 'set', 'pieces', 'anything', 'bad', 'say', 'Saw', 'acting', 'very', 'wooden', 'plenty', 'leaps', 'logic', 'first', 'definitely', 'best', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'Saw', 'better', 'might', 'think', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'particularly', 'older', 'horror', 'fans', 'missing', 'bite', 'horror', 'films', 'years', 'gone', 'bye', 'were', 'infamous']",N/A

As simple as that! We'll, that's what's not so simple is it. Could you do it?

The two are played against each other in a series of games in order to get the one to do the unthinkable. The story reveals that neither of them are in fact total strangers nor are they both entirely innocent.Written and Directed by first time ""nobodies"" - LEIGH WHANNELL & JAMES WAN : who believe me after this are going somewhere. Names will be in bright lights soon!JIGSAW is the warped psychopath pitting everyday people against the impossible in order to survive! Chances of making it - very slim unless you do what you'd never even dream of attempting.The film is very unsettling and most will battle to sit through it... but I highly recommend seeing it.It really is a MASTERPIECE and hopefully the already highly talked about sequel will keep the same pace and same originality and not conform to the basic sequel rules that turn so much of the garbage we see these days into the quickly forgotten.

Saw is NOT a horror film. It's a thriller. Horror films, by definition, involve the supernatural. Everyone got that clear?As far as the movie itself, Yes, it's bloody and a little shocking here and there, but as a whole, Saw is as lukewarm as the water in the tub. That the plot is a piece of Swiss cheese is secondary. The movie's biggest problem is the acting. Both Whannell (who should really stick to writing and let attempting to act go) and Elwes shamefully overact, chewing scenery almost non-stop. Even more maddening, when Elwes stops chewing, he underacts, as if he's reading from a cue card. He was always an average actor at best, and pretty much destroys any credibility he ever had here. Danny Glover looks like someone drugged him to do the film. The worst performance I've ever seen him turn in. And, a lot of the rest of the cast is mediocre, too. As far as the story goes, well... it's a movie. The problem is, if Wan and Whannell (sounds like a comedy team) would've tried to make the screenplay smoother, and Wan himself stopped trying to be so damn ""I went to film school"" artistic with all the unnecessary (they add exactly zero to the film) speed-ups and weird angles, this might've been a far more shocking and engrossing film. As it stands, far too may holes and unexplained or undeveloped areas. Overall, it's just weak. Finally,in a movie like this, when one of the major premises is gore, why not go for the whole thing instead of cutting away? Yet another example of a potentially terrifying,lasting film botched by poor handling. Makes you wonder what another director and writer might have done with it. Let someone who knows how to see Saw. See?PS: For those folks who considered this ""gripping,"" ""terrifying,""Intense"" or, God help us all, ""award-winning,"" you really need to see more movies made before 2000.

So what does this say about modern horror films, where the story (what little there is) is mostly regarded as the boring bit between kills?I also think that it's amazing the film turned out as good as it did.

Two men wake up in an old, isolated bathroom chained to pipes and with a dead body between them.  As they slowly start to figure out what's going on, they discover clues to a puzzle that they must get out of; if they don't in time, they'll die (in various ways).  It's all an elaborate scheme thought up by a serial killer named Jigsaw who's out to do something about people who don't appreciate their lives in the way he feels they should.The plot--and general creepiness and scare factor--are weakened once we start playing the ""flashback and twist"" game.  The doctor fellow knows who this killer is, because he used to be a suspect in the case... and thus the story gets told directly to us.  And from there the movie loses most of its power.  Instead of working out a great mystery over how this all came to be, we're just TOLD it (but with twists, see, because twists a good horror movie make).  Instead of being confined, literally, to this room to find all the clues, we're taken on asides to other characters, one of which was completely superfluous (Danny Glover's detective character... seriously, could have not been in the movie at all and probably wouldn't have changed anything).  And then we get some weird form of selective memory: ""Oh gee, I just now remembered what happened to me yesterday!  Now that it's important for the audience to know!""So it's definitely not what I would call the most tightly wound thriller, but the premise is a very good one.  Knowing the way sequels work (and the fact that there are two already), I doubt they'll pump much more strength into the loose ends of this first one, so it's a shame that this great idea turned out pretty mediocre.However, it was fun to watch anyway.  It made up for superfluousness by inventing even more crazy traps and characters.  One scene was so full of glurge it was ridiculous: *Spoilers* ""And did you?  Did you turn out a better person?""  ""*Cries* He saved me!""  *End spoiler* I believe these situations would do a lot more to permanently damage people's lives than make them realize how important life is.

I believe anything could be better than this 'film', even cutting myself to pieces and filming it would be more fun than this crap!Danny Glover stars in this. I had to check the main Amazon page to verify that sense I don't own this crap. Isn't that a shock in the rubber parts??!! To think at one time he was doing such GREAT work in classics like ""The Color Purple"" to sink to doing this. Wow, what a downfall!! I think Danny Glover needed the money. I was embarrassed for him! And, I thought he was embarrassing in ""Gone Fishin"", but this is the bottom of the barrel. This is unwatchable garbage.Yes, this is simply nothing more than mind rot at its most blatant! There is no plot, no psychology, no suspense, just gore-gore-gore-and MORE gore just for the sake of showing gore. And to think this film not only is a 'hit', but it has spawned sequels. Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be. If I wanna see someone being tortured, I'll visit youtube and watch some Iraq footage or something, but I really don't prefer to view someone being tortured just for shock value.This isn't 'horror', nor is it a 'film', but disgusting pieces of footage combined together to whet a poor filmmaker's egotistical fetishes and air them in public for all to see; and, what vile carnal garbage this is, at that. Bilge like this should be flushed down the toilet, along with the people who made it. I couldn't sit through more than 20 minutes of this crap. It isn't merely disgusting, it's PRETENTIOUS JUNK that's pretending to be ""art"", when in reality it has NOTHING to say or add to the world...except maybe provide viewing pleasure for people who get off on watching torture. And THAT'S scary. We've sunk pretty low. These are some sorry individuals who made this!The scariest thing is indeed the fact that so many people love this crap. Some are starting to call it ""torture porn"", meaning that it's pornography for people who love violence, not sex. I think that's an apt description.These movies are inhuman. People, mostly kids and young adults, are paying good money to enjoy watching inhuman acts. Society is becoming like ""Lord of the Flies"". And the people who are the sickest are the least likely to see it in themselves, apparently.I advise anyone with any common sense of decency to stay as far away from these trash 'snuff-porn for dummies' films as possible. They are a plague on our country, and people are sitting in theaters eating them up as they are eating their popcorn and being told 'this is ok to watch', brainwashed like mindless sheep. Treat this crap like AIDS or Typhoid Mary, for it is liken to a very scary virus that's overtaking theaters in place of what used to be great cinema.I read someone reviewing ""Hostel part 2"" saying that Hitchcock would love it.

873638,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B0006SSOHC,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[0, 2]","Fans of horror, rejoice! After the crapsome crap that's been spilling out of Hollywood like so much blood from an elevator for the last number of years, here is finally a movie with a lot of originality and some actual, honest-to-god shock moments!Although horror really isn't a fair genre in which to bracket 'Saw', seeing as how it's not really a scary movie, in the traditional sense of the term. No ghosts, no supernatural goings-on, no girls with long black hair crawling backwards out of the television, and nothing in the loft. Think of it more as a terribly effective thriller, set in a very grim environment.To synopsise the plot, two men wake up chained to opposite walls of a disused men's room. There's a corpse laying dead in the centre of the floor, with a cassette player in his hand. Our two protagonists find cassettes in their pockets, personally addressed to them. And from there, they must piece together the events that have led up to their capture, as well as find a way out of their predicament before six o' clock... or else!Leigh Whannell (Adam) and Cary Elwes (Dr. Lawrence Gordon) aren't great actors, so there's not a lot on offer for fans of carefully crafted performances. Some of the plot devices, too, feel a little familiar, once the movie gets going. And there's a lot of visual fluffing, in terms of flashy camerawork and overwrought flashback sequences. So what makes ""Saw"" work so well?Originality. The first thirty minutes of the movie are as affecting in their visual melancholia as they are in the amount of tension they succeed in building. Director James Wan's success in establishing the initial hopelessness and melancholia of the captives' situation is admirable, given that it's so simple. The story, too, is a more original version of a serial killer fable, and while the flashiness of the movie won't really cause you to mull over the nature of good and evil, there's certainly a strong backstory behind the events of the main film.Set-pieces are similarly original - think of a slightly less plausible version of 'Se7en' and you'll get an idea of what I mean. It's not a very gory movie, either, despite what you may have heard - but the imagery that Wan uses is very unsettling in places, and very effective because of this. And performance-wise, while the two leads won't win any oscars for this one, they're by no means bad actors, nor are they unsuccessful in setting out what the intend to do - personally, I was rooted to my seat from beginning to end, and, in a time where bad horror has made it nigh-on impossible for us to feel fear in the cinema anymore, that's no mean feat.All in all, ""Saw"" is highly deserving of praise for being a truly original and very effective movie. It's well-made, it's tense, and it's very compelling. While rental might be enough for most of us, the DVD extras are enough to warrant purchase, and all in all, I can recommend this one very highly.",4,4 Stars for a very valiant effort,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,2934,"['Fans', 'horror', 'rejoice', 'crapsome', 'crap', 'been', 'spilling', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'much', 'blood', 'elevator', 'last', 'number', 'years', 'here', 'finally', 'movie', 'lot', 'originality', 'actual', 'honest-to-god', 'shock', 'moments', 'horror', 'really', ""n't"", 'fair', 'genre', 'bracket', ""'Saw"", 'seeing', 'how', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'movie', 'traditional', 'sense', 'term', 'ghosts', 'supernatural', 'goings-on', 'girls', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'crawling', 'backwards', 'television', 'nothing', 'loft', 'Think', 'more', 'terribly', 'effective', 'thriller', 'set', 'very', 'grim', 'environment.To', 'synopsise', 'plot', 'two', 'men', 'wake', 'up', 'chained', 'opposite', 'walls', 'disused', 'men', 'room', 'corpse', 'laying', 'dead', 'centre', 'floor', 'cassette', 'player', 'hand', 'two', 'protagonists', 'find', 'cassettes', 'pockets', 'personally', 'addressed', 'there', 'must', 'piece', 'together', 'events', 'have', 'led', 'up', 'capture', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'way', 'predicament', 'six', 'o', 'clock', 'else', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'Adam', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Gordon', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'actors', 'not', 'lot', 'offer', 'fans', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'performances', 'plot', 'devices', 'too', 'feel', 'little', 'familiar', 'once', 'movie', 'going', 'lot', 'visual', 'fluffing', 'terms', 'flashy', 'camerawork', 'overwrought', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'what', 'Saw', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Originality', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'affecting', 'visual', 'melancholia', 'are', 'amount', 'tension', 'succeed', 'building', 'Director', 'James', 'Wan', 'success', 'establishing', 'initial', 'hopelessness', 'melancholia', 'captives', 'situation', 'admirable', 'given', 'so', 'simple', 'story', 'too', 'more', 'original', 'version', 'serial', 'killer', 'fable', 'flashiness', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'cause', 'mull', 'nature', 'good', 'evil', 'certainly', 'strong', 'backstory', 'events', 'main', 'film.Set-pieces', 'are', 'similarly', 'original', 'think', 'slightly', 'less', 'plausible', 'version', ""'Se7en"", ""'ll"", 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'mean', 'not', 'very', 'gory', 'movie', 'either', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'imagery', 'Wan', 'very', 'unsettling', 'places', 'very', 'effective', 'performance-wise', 'two', 'leads', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'oscars', 'one', ""'re"", 'means', 'bad', 'actors', 'are', 'unsuccessful', 'setting', 'out', 'what', 'intend', 'do', 'personally', 'was', 'rooted', 'seat', 'beginning', 'end', 'time', 'where', 'bad', 'horror', 'made', 'nigh-on', 'impossible', 'feel', 'fear', 'cinema', 'anymore', 'mean', 'feat.All', 'Saw', 'highly', 'deserving', 'praise', 'being', 'truly', 'original', 'very', 'effective', 'movie', 'well-made', 'tense', 'very', 'compelling', 'rental', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'most', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'enough', 'warrant', 'purchase', 'can', 'recommend', 'one', 'very', 'highly']",N/A

To compare this to ""Se7en"" is absurd; there's little or no comparison. Director James Wan's youthful zeal and excitement is beautifully executed, but nothing can compare to David Fincher's meticulous style.I was expecting another stupid slasher flick, and was pleasantly surprised to be presented with quite an original narrative that had me fascinated. I did NOT guess the ending, though I tried, because it was so well written and edited. The acting wasn't very good, though not totally unbelievable. After all, hysterical is an emotion that's hard to sustain for 98 minutes if you're an actor. James Wan's focus may not have been as precise as he'd wished, but I look forward to his next project.

Before um...I watched this movie in the theatre, and again when it came out on DVD, i have no idea why i saw it again. For starters, why did they call it ""saw"" ? Did they think just because of a vague reference, they could get away with it? Well... According to a few reviews, apparently they did. But they didn't get by me.The movie revolves around a serial killer who throws puzzles at his victims in which case with a lot of luck, will power, and the will to live, they could get through. The premise is, he doesn't kill people, he just forces them to kill themselves... It isn't all that. Good premise, bad writing of it.First of all, I don't take much issue with the name so much, as I take issue with the sheer stupidity of the writer who came up with this thing. I'll give them one star for originality, and one star for good cosmetic effects, the rest just isn't there.For starters, from the way the storyline [if you can call it that] is given, you can tell an amateur wrote the script and therefore, they should have made the story a little better, or wrote it a little more believable.For instance, the hack saws the two men get [maybe that's why they called it saw]. They have six hours to live, and they give up sawing through the chains after ten seconds... Record time for stupidity. Ok, ill give the one who broke his a break, but the other one who remained calm, could have gotten out if he sawed instead of jabbered. This was a huge turn off for me, and thus, the rest was just a bit of mindless plot that seemed to just be added at the last minute.

Since most of the story revolves around them, I don't give any sympathy to the characters.As for the movie itself, it had a few really cool scenes of people in hopeless situations, and a few jaw dropping views of solid gore, but once you got used to it... it wasn't anything special.If more thought went into this movie, and maybe they actually tried to make the name make sense, it might have been a good movie.

I'm still thinking about it a few days after I saw it. Especially the image of the character sawing off his leg and the state of mind he was in when he was doing it. Disgusting and disturbing.It's like the movie Phonebooth in the sense that the killer toys with his victims. Putting them through psychological distress and forcing them to make choices. It is not an extremely gory movie but it shows enough to have an effect. The movie is also atypical in the sense that it does not involve a parallel story of police detectives solving the 'jigsaw' crimes and eventually capturing the killer. In fact, the detectives either get killed or go mad and then get killed. The fact that the criminal isn't brought to justice in the end adds to the disturbing nature of the film.The movie misdirects on many occasions so that it can surprise you later. They give you quick glimpses of the killer, and just when you think you were clever enough to spot his face and figure out who he is, you get a surprise!

873643,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0006SSOHC,RMurray847,"[0, 1]","Word of warning to start things off:  NOT FOR KIDS!!!  Not only is the movie rated ""R,"" it is quite grizzly.  While not unusually ""graphic,"" it is unusually disturbing.  The creators have gone out of their way to concoct disquieting deaths and some pretty disquieting ideas.  It's the kind of movie where at the end you have to kinda wonder what kind of sick mind came up with this stuff.If you liked SE7EN, you might like this too.  That's the movie it's most often compared with, but that's not quite fair.  It's seedy, like much of SE7EN, but it doesn't have a Hollywood gloss on it. For all it's deranged ideas, SE7EN had a sheen of respectability brought to it by the presence of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow...all comfortable, well-known, attractive actors.  Not much of that in SAW!It deals with a serial-killer who isn't really.  The crazy person in this film concocts extremely elaborate ways to get his hostages to kill themselves.  One victim, for example, is told she can save herself by unlocking the huge device on her head, which, when a timer goes off, will essentially rip her head in half.  To unlock the device, she must retrieve the key from her cellmate.  Or rather, her cellmate's stomach.The killer watches all the shenanigans from lots of hidden cameras and such, and communicates in taped recordings that distort his voice.  We've seen all that sort of stuff before.  The cop who is chasing the bad guy (Danny Glover) is obsessed with his work, to the point where his sanity loosens and he loses his job.  Hardly original either.What DOES work in the film is the central scene (which feels almost like a play) where two men wake up in a most horrifically filthy abandoned public restroom somewhere.  They are chained around the ankle to thick pipes and cannot reach each other.  In the middle of the room lies a previous victim, a man who has apparently shot  himself in the head and left quite a mess on the floor.  Each man discovers a taped recording with instructions, telling them how to survive.  The main character, played by Cary Elwes (oh, how far the star of PRINCESS BRIDE has fallen), is a doctor who has been told that his wife and daughter are being held hostage, and that they can only have there freedom if Elwes kills his cellmate.  Oh, and each man has a hacksaw...not strong enough to cut the chains, but perfect for sawing off a foot to get free of the chains.  Nice, huh?Well, I have to admit that as the men acted out their little scenario throughout the film (the rest of the backstory is told in flashbacks) I was intrigued.  It carried a lurid fascination.  And the resolution of the film, while a bit pat, was surprising and twisty.  We think we know who the villain is...but do we?So, the pluses are there:  it's a compelling story (although we feel a little unclean watching it), has some surprises and has an over-the-top art direction and cinematography that is admirable in its fearlessness.On the down side: the acting is pretty uneven.  Glover really has nothing to work with and poor Elwes...in the past, he has done an American accent quite convincingly, but in this movie, it gets away from him time and again...lapsing into British pronunciations just enough to be quite distracting.  The young man who is the doctor's cellmate is played by screenwriter Whannel, and he comes across as a guy who's maybe done a little acting in college for fun...he's got energy, but no subtlety.  Monica Potter plays Elwes wife, and she's a cipher too.  The movie isn't terribly interested in its characters...just its situations.  And for the most part, that's good enough.  This is no SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  If the filmmakers aspired to that...they missed the boat.  If they aspired to achieve everything that the execrable FEAR DOT COM missed, then I think they did okay.  The movie shows some originality, but it feels a bit rushed.  No doubt the filmmakers were given a pretty tight budget and schdule.  Parts of it feel scotch-taped together...tug too hard and it'll all fall apart.  You don't want to think about this one too hard.Who to recommend it to:  filmgoers who don't mind being a little uncomfortable in exchange for some serial-killer / sicko thrills.  If you like stuff like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SE7EN and that ilk, you'll probably be okay with this film.  If you're squeamish, like your murders tidy, then stay away.  And again, if you're a parent, please keep your young kids away.  When I saw the film, there were about 10 little children in the audience, and I felt bad for them.  They'll remember (and dream about) the disturbing images...but won't actually understand what happened.",3,Promising but a bit amateurish,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,4670,"['Word', 'warning', 'start', 'things', 'off', 'NOT', 'KIDS', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'quite', 'grizzly', 'not', 'unusually', 'graphic', 'unusually', 'disturbing', 'creators', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'concoct', 'disquieting', 'deaths', 'pretty', 'disquieting', 'ideas', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'end', 'have', 'kinda', 'wonder', 'what', 'kind', 'sick', 'mind', 'came', 'up', 'stuff.If', 'liked', 'SE7EN', 'might', 'like', 'too', 'movie', 'most', 'often', 'compared', 'not', 'quite', 'fair', 'seedy', 'much', 'SE7EN', ""n't"", 'have', 'Hollywood', 'gloss', 'deranged', 'ideas', 'SE7EN', 'had', 'sheen', 'respectability', 'brought', 'presence', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'comfortable', 'well-known', 'attractive', 'actors', 'Not', 'much', 'SAW', 'serial-killer', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'crazy', 'person', 'film', 'extremely', 'elaborate', 'ways', 'get', 'hostages', 'kill', 'One', 'victim', 'example', 'told', 'can', 'save', 'herself', 'unlocking', 'huge', 'device', 'head', 'when', 'timer', 'will', 'essentially', 'rip', 'head', 'half', 'unlock', 'device', 'must', 'retrieve', 'key', 'cellmate', 'rather', 'cellmate', 'stomach.The', 'killer', 'watches', 'shenanigans', 'lots', 'hidden', 'cameras', 'such', 'communicates', 'taped', 'recordings', 'distort', 'voice', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sort', 'stuff', 'cop', 'who', 'chasing', 'bad', 'guy', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'obsessed', 'work', 'point', 'where', 'sanity', 'loosens', 'job', 'Hardly', 'original', 'either.What', 'DOES', 'work', 'film', 'central', 'scene', 'almost', 'play', 'where', 'two', 'men', 'wake', 'up', 'most', 'horrifically', 'filthy', 'abandoned', 'public', 'restroom', 'somewhere', 'are', 'chained', 'ankle', 'thick', 'pipes', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'other', 'middle', 'room', 'previous', 'victim', 'man', 'who', 'apparently', 'shot', 'head', 'left', 'quite', 'mess', 'floor', 'man', 'taped', 'recording', 'instructions', 'telling', 'how', 'survive', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'oh', 'how', 'far', 'star', 'PRINCESS', 'BRIDE', 'fallen', 'doctor', 'who', 'been', 'told', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'there', 'freedom', 'Elwes', 'cellmate', 'Oh', 'man', 'hacksaw', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'cut', 'chains', 'perfect', 'sawing', 'off', 'foot', 'get', 'free', 'chains', 'Nice', 'huh', 'Well', 'have', 'admit', 'men', 'acted', 'out', 'little', 'scenario', 'film', 'rest', 'backstory', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'intrigued', 'carried', 'lurid', 'fascination', 'resolution', 'film', 'bit', 'pat', 'was', 'surprising', 'twisty', 'think', 'know', 'who', 'villain', 'do', 'So', 'pluses', 'are', 'there', 'compelling', 'story', 'feel', 'little', 'unclean', 'watching', 'surprises', 'over-the-top', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'admirable', 'fearlessness.On', 'down', 'side', 'acting', 'pretty', 'uneven', 'Glover', 'really', 'nothing', 'work', 'poor', 'Elwes', 'past', 'done', 'American', 'accent', 'quite', 'convincingly', 'movie', 'away', 'time', 'again', 'lapsing', 'British', 'pronunciations', 'just', 'enough', 'be', 'quite', 'distracting', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'doctor', 'cellmate', 'played', 'screenwriter', 'Whannel', 'across', 'guy', 'who', 'maybe', 'done', 'little', 'acting', 'college', 'fun', 'got', 'energy', 'subtlety', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'Elwes', 'wife', 'cipher', 'too', 'movie', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'interested', 'characters', 'just', 'situations', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'enough', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'filmmakers', 'aspired', 'missed', 'boat', 'aspired', 'achieve', 'everything', 'execrable', 'FEAR', 'DOT', 'COM', 'missed', 'then', 'think', 'did', 'okay', 'movie', 'originality', 'bit', 'rushed', 'doubt', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'given', 'pretty', 'tight', 'budget', 'schdule', 'Parts', 'feel', 'scotch-taped', 'together', 'tug', 'too', 'hard', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'apart', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'one', 'too', 'hard.Who', 'recommend', 'filmgoers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'being', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'exchange', 'serial-killer', '/', 'sicko', 'thrills', 'like', 'stuff', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'SE7EN', 'ilk', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'okay', 'film', ""'re"", 'squeamish', 'murders', 'tidy', 'then', 'stay', 'away', 'again', ""'re"", 'parent', 'please', 'keep', 'young', 'kids', 'away', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'were', '10', 'little', 'children', 'audience', 'felt', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'dream', 'about', 'disturbing', 'images', 'wo', ""n't"", 'actually', 'understand', 'what', 'happened']",N/A

The production values are high and the acting is competantly well above the vast majority of similar creepshows. Decent amount of Grand Guignol for us gore-hounds of the world (please don't write to tell me which flicks are more gross as I already know and own most of them).I did not give this movie five stars for a small variety of reasons; the screenplay could have been tweaked a bit,  and certain characters are not really developed to fullest effect.  But I really enjoyed this movie:  I don't want to get picky.I do not view this as a ""horror"" movie in the classic sense,  but SAW should make you uncomfortable in the extreme.  Avoid the psychedelics for this one,  you crazy kids.As a mystery,  it's great.  A good mystery must very carefully hide the true answers,  all the while dropping sufficient clues to allow the viewer to slove the puzzle.  Saw succeeds perfectly and the misdirection is inspiring.  I felt as if I had been led around like a mouse in a maze of nightmares.  Usually I figure these things out but this one fooled me more than twice.So,  see this film and enjoy.

If anything, it added realism and made each of the scenes raw and disturbing in a surprisingly entertaining way.The only thing that brought this film down was the pace.  It seemed like the action dragged in a few places, especially when it came to the police's pursuit of Jigsaw.  It didn't hurt the film in the long run, though, especially when everything comes together for the surprise ending, which is bound to shock even the most seasoned horror fan.This is how horror should be done.

This movie is just trying to take advange ofanother little ""horror"" era that probably started with TheRing a few years ago. This is a rather predictable movie aseven my moronic brother in law seen who the ""killer"" was justshortly after he appeared in the film.The main focus on the movie is two guys with one being adoctor and the other guy gets paid to snoop and takepictures of other peoples business. The movie for the mostpart goes for shock value. Not that I mind, but it's justthat the movie isn't as deep/dark and scary as it wants tobe. There are a few original ideas like ""the head vice"" butfor the most part the movie just takes bits and pieces fromother movies of the genre and puts them together.I'd have to say the acting is the worst. Cary Elwes is justan aweful actor in this film. How could the director  allowsuch pathetic work? Did Cary just come THAT cheap? EvenDanny Glover was bad in this one! It is sad because eventhough it steals from other movies it could have been alotbetter. The acting and bits in pieces seem abit to rushed.And we can't forget the car scene.

The entire film appeared to be so eeriee and I needed to know what was going on.I must say this film was a heart- stopping thriller. They cut to the chase right at the beginning of the film with the main character Adam waking up in an old bathroom chained to a pipe and across the room from him is a doctor whom says he just woke up himself and he is chained to a pipe as well. In the middle of the floor between them is a corpse that shot himself. Which tells you whoever put them down there means lethal business. A series of clues they find in that one bathroom leads them to find out much about what is going to happen to them and it doesn't look good on either side. I won't give anything away because the movie is just full of surprises and the viewer should be as shocked as I was in every one of them.Why this film is only given a three? Well in some parts of the film they really try to scare you by making some scenes go really quick and I found that a little tacky. At the end once more they gave you a cliff- hanger and like I mentioned probably in many films I don't really like that but the ending is really good and may I add nauseating because the doctor does something very horrific and I don't even want to think on it. You can see it for yourself. Just don't be eating dinner while watching it.The gist of this film? You'll never guess the ending. You can sit here now and think on it as hard as I did throughout the movie but you'll never figure out the ending. It is beyond twisted and you'll just be sitting there at the end in deep shock.

This movie is classified as a ""horror"" movie but it is very very intense as well. There is no one running up stairs instead of out of the front door type of situations, only those who keep you on the edge of your seat. There have been many complaints on the acting, yes, some is a bit exaggerated but you can't help to think about what you would look like if you were in that situation.I was very impressed with the plot, considering most horror movies forget to add those in the mix of blood shed and screams. The movie will definitely leave you guessing and your heart racing. Don't be fooled by the room they are locked in, the entertainment value is ten times greater than when Tom Hanks got deserted on an island (Cast Away) and scuba divers got left in the ocean (Open Water).Overall this is one of the best horror movies I have seen. I believe it opens up a whole new world of opportunity for movies that can get to their viewer mentally. The scariest thing of all in this movie is that it can actually happen, unlike Jason coming back over and over.

No annoying harpies or pretty pictures of hell or tragically humanized vampires here, just an ingenious killer with an obscure motive.SAW dives right into the depths of the madness too, opening with our killer's current victims, two men chained on opposite ends of a filthy restroom, a body in the center clutching a cassette player and a handgun.  Each man is given a tape to play, which provides him with a nice dilemma to ponder during his captivity.  The background of the killer and the events leading up to the men's current situation unfolds nicely during narrated recollections and well-placed flashbacks, while the actual motive stays hidden underneath the obvious delight the killer derives from the simple pleasures of torture.Because SAW also brings to film an excellent `Whodunnit?', I am not going to elaborate on the storyline any further.  Suffice to say that Cary Elwes and Danny Glover give excellent performances (Elwes surprising me since I have only seen him in comedy roles), the photography is good, the killing methods tasty, the blood not really overdone but still dosed out well, and the plot sustainable.Lets face it fans, we don't go to horror movies to learn how to do decoupage, we go to get scared and grossed out.  SAW fulfills that primal hankering, leaving you to utter `blech' and `bravo' in the same troubled breath, and wondering what your punishment would be like under the careful ministrations of this psychopath.Aficionados of the genre are going to love SAW's mixture of gore, insanity, ingenious traps, and filth, while non-lover's of the theme should stick to `Sleepless In Seattle' and other such ilk.

This is the best directorial debut since QT's Resevoir Dogs (because it set the standard for stylish movies).  James Wan did a great job with a great script, and I hope to see many more films from him, esspecially in this genre, I think he would also make a good action film because of his fast paced no holds bar visions.  The story is original and creepy, but somehow realistic, and provides many shocking moments and memorable scenes, and the twist ending(which i wont ruin for you) was just amazingly shocking, and dare i say, it is just as good of a twist as anything from M. Night (the master of twist endings) if not better.  This is a very well crafted horror suspense drama, from the story to music to the performances to the cinematography to the... get the picture.  Just one little problem, the main character, Dr. Gordon, the guy who played him did a great job most of the time, but he kind of switched from good to bad, performance wise, like sometimes he would act cheesy and fake, and then he would totally pull the scene off perfectly, I just wish he was like that the whole time, but he gets the job done, more then decently.  I give it a 9 out of a 10, its very close to exorcist the beginning in my opinion, and even The Exorcist for that matter (see becuase im the only one in the world who likes the beginning as much as the original).  The sequel to this is already confirmed for next halloween, and since its going to be directed by Wan it should be just as good if not better.",5,"Live or Die, make your choice, and then see this movie...",1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,1594,"['o', 'wait', 'rephrase', 'see', 'movie', 'then', 'decide', 'want', 'die', 'not', 'just', 'kidding', 'best', 'directorial', 'debut', 'QT', 'Resevoir', 'Dogs', 'set', 'standard', 'stylish', 'movies', 'James', 'Wan', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'great', 'script', 'hope', 'see', 'many', 'more', 'films', 'esspecially', 'genre', 'think', 'would', 'also', 'make', 'good', 'action', 'film', 'fast', 'paced', 'bar', 'visions', 'story', 'original', 'creepy', 'somehow', 'realistic', 'many', 'shocking', 'moments', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'twist', 'ending', 'i', 'wont', 'ruin', 'was', 'just', 'amazingly', 'shocking', 'dare', 'i', 'say', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'twist', 'anything', 'M.', 'Night', 'master', 'twist', 'endings', 'not', 'better', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'horror', 'suspense', 'drama', 'story', 'music', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'get', 'picture', 'Just', 'one', 'little', 'problem', 'main', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'most', 'time', 'kind', 'switched', 'good', 'bad', 'performance', 'wise', 'sometimes', 'would', 'act', 'cheesy', 'fake', 'then', 'would', 'totally', 'pull', 'scene', 'off', 'perfectly', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'whole', 'time', 'job', 'done', 'more', 'then', 'decently', 'give', '9', '10', 'very', 'close', 'exorcist', 'beginning', 'opinion', 'even', 'Exorcist', 'matter', 'see', 'becuase', 'im', 'only', 'one', 'world', 'who', 'beginning', 'as', 'much', 'original', 'sequel', 'already', 'confirmed', 'next', 'halloween', 'going', 'be', 'directed', 'Wan', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better']",N/A

This resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of horror productions I watched each year. I am happy to say that ""Saw"" was reminiscent of the good old times. This is a movie that has an electrifying pace, plenty of gore, thrills galore and a clever plot.It all starts with two men chained on opposite ends of a filthy, rusty and generally disgusting bathroom. Between the two, there is a dead man with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. The two prisoners are clueless as to what is going on, with Dr. Lawrence Gordon being by far the calmer of the two, and Adam freaking out. Of course, at this point we are asking ourselves, what does the kidnapper want? But we do not have to wait long, and soon enough, the games begin. Adam finds a tape in his pocket, and Lawrence finds not only a tape, but also a key and a bullet. You can probably guess, but just in case, let me tell you that the key does not work on the locks that are keeping them chained.The point of the game is that Lawrence has to manage to kill Adam by 6 pm, or the psycho will kill his wife and daughter. At that time, we also find out that Lawrence has been a suspect in previous murders by this killer. We then get a combination of flashbacks to previous events related to this case, and the ordeal the two men are going through.The previous cases show us a very creative and twisted individual, who does not really kill his victims, but makes them kill themselves. In these scenes you will get a high dose of gore, so this movie is not for people that are even a little bit squeamish. If you like horror films though, I guarantee that you will be entertained through the duration of this movie and that your nerves are going to be seriously tested. There is only one reason I did not give this movie five stars; the acting. Both, Whannell and Elwes, deliver sub par performances, with exaggerated facial expressions that do not fit the mood of the film.

Although it shares many similarities with these movies, it still has too many plot holes and quite a few thing going against it to stand proud with those films. So why am I giving the film 4 stars? Because Saw offers one heck of a great time, that's why.The Jigsaw Man abducts his victims and gives them a challenge they need to meet in order to survive. When a doctor and a young photographer wake up chained in an old decrepit building, the only thing standing between them is cassette player and a saw. They find tapes in their pockets that they will need to play in order to understand the rules of the game; if the doctor isn't able to free himself and kill his partner in less than twenty-four hours, then his family will also be murdered (since they're handcuffed, there's only one real mean of escape... I'll let you figure it out for yourself).The film is shlocky and the performances (especially Elwes) are often laughable. But what the film delivers, it delivers it great. There are many very intense moments in this one, so many scenes that make you jump out of your seet of make you cringe that it's more than worth the price of the DVD. One flashback sequence in particular is incredibly disturbing and so horrifying you'll be holding your breath until it's over.  Forget about major plot holes (the surprise ending makes no sense at all). In fact, stop thinking and just enjoy the ride for what it is.Grimmy, atmospheric, dark and disturbing, Saw is a horror movie you'll want to watch with your hands covering your eyes.

873664,AWCDFMA7M6P6B,B0006SSOHC,shane2006,"[1, 4]","""Saw"" is a really creepy film that starts off creepy and ends creepy. The acting is good, until the doctor starts yelling out his wifes name too loud, then it gets hilarious. I cannot even remember the characters names, that is how unforgetable the characters were. The storyline, however, was the best part of the film. A murderer makes people go through obstacles that will end up the person in the predicament killing themselves just to survive. The film, though, was gross. An overweight man having to climb through a maz of barb wire. Then the detective later says, ""It cut him so deep that we found traces of stomach acid on the floor."" Nasty. The only character that I cared about was the doctor's wife and little girl because they did not deserve for that to happen to them. The doctor and the photographer who took pictures of the doctor were not the best characters, and the actor's who portrayed them did not do a good job. My favorite character, however, was the girl who had to cut the key out of a supposedly dead guys stomach to unlock the headset that was attached to her jaw. If she did not accomplish this, the headset was going to snap and break off her jaw, causing her death. The guy, though was not dead, and she had to murder him. It was extremely disgusting, though, when it showed her pulling out his intestines. At the end, though, the doctor has to cut off his foot to get away, and it even shows him start to cut. The murderer, though I will not give it away, was witty. I would have never guessed that it would be that person. The film, overall is getting three stars from me because the storyline was excellent, but I did not care if the main characters were to die or not.

This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out, because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watch.Almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare. The acting didn't make it scary, and the situations hardly made it scary, therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable.Not even the gore could've saved the plot, and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller Se7en.Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.Oh, did I mention poor acting? At first, Cary Elwes seems makes a convincing performance; however, this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears of laughter at this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and too played-out, although not as bad as the performance by Elwes, and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a writer for the movie.The end of Saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it, and that is what makes it a huge failure. It was an opportunity wasted, and I have no clue as to why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to take roles in this movie.I am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it. It was definitely not worth the $4, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot, it's that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury. I'll avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this: don't watch this movie.",1,This one belongs to the razzies....,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,2786,"['review', 'not', 'necessarily', 'expose', 'plot', 'movie', 'however', 'may', 'change', 'one', 'expectations', 'movie', 'thus', 'make', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Ever', 'rented', 'scary', 'movie', 'expecting', 'be', 'edge', 'seat', 'fear', 'instead', 'ended', 'up', 'howling', 'laughter', 'stupid', 'turn', 'plot', 'movie', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'opportunities', 'impress', 'actually', 'scare', 'viewer', 'was', 'cut', 'poorly', 'jumped', 'too', 'much', 'making', 'references', 'past', 'seem', 'more', 'like', 'excuses', 'why', 'plot', 'was', 'heading', 'particular', 'direction', 'writers', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'thought', 'how', 'potentially', 'excellent', 'plot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'carried', 'out', 'poor', 'construction', 'time', 'plot', 'discouraging', 'viewer', 'movie', 'increasingly', 'tiring', 'watch.Almost', 'worse', 'writers', 'having', 'abused', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'classic', 'thriller', 'was', 'fact', 'gradually', 'relied', 'cheap', 'tactics', 'scare', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'scary', 'situations', 'hardly', 'made', 'scary', 'needed', 'few', 'dark', 'scenes', 'things', 'jumping', 'out', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'Even', 'were', 'predictable.Not', 'even', 'gore', 'could', ""'ve"", 'saved', 'plot', 'gore', 'successful', 'thriller', 'Se7en.Speaking', 'Se7en', 'feel', 'Saw', 'tried', 'follow', 'Se7en', 'incredibly', 'fascinating', 'psychological', 'theme', 'failed', 'miserably', 'doing', 'so', 'was', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'analysis', 'plot', 'structure', 'surrounding', 'psychology', 'killer', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'tease', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'believe', 'far', 'that.Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'poor', 'acting', 'first', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'convincing', 'performance', 'however', 'completely', 'most', 'crucial', 'parts', 'plot', 'was', 'left', 'tears', 'laughter', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Razzie', 'performance', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'also', 'terrible', 'too', 'played-out', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'performance', 'Elwes', 'big', 'red', 'flag', 'Whannell', 'also', 'writer', 'movie.The', 'end', 'Saw', 'could', 'never', 'make', 'up', 'having', 'lost', 'entire', 'middle', 'what', 'huge', 'failure', 'was', 'opportunity', 'wasted', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'chose', 'take', 'roles', 'movie.I', 'am', 'mad', 'wasting', 'money', 'just', 'renting', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', '4', 'future', 'will', 'definitely', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'anything', 'having', 'do', 'Elwes', 'Whannell', 'James', 'Wan', 'big', 'tragedy', 'not', 'lacked', 'basis', 'plot', 'great', 'potential', 'storyline', 'was', 'thrown', 'away', 'poor', 'acting', 'added', 'insult', 'injury', ""'ll"", 'avoid', 'poor', 'puns', 'involving', 'title', 'just', 'conclude', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

Saw follows the trend, but there are more than a few reasons that this film breathes new life into a rapidly dying genre.This film places Adam and Lawrence in a single room.  Their objectives:  for one of them, it is to escape the room; for the other, it is to kill his fellow prisoner (otherwise, his family dies).  Following in the wake of Seven, this movie centers around the Jigsaw Killer (renowned for allowing his victims to find ways to kill themselves) and the puzzle that he presents the unlucky prisoners.  From start to finish, the movie unravels bit by bit, slowly revealing critical details of the plot surrounding the main characters, the killer, and several of the side characters as well.  Along the way, there are some truly memorable scenes (Adam's hunt for the murderer in the dark using his camera's flash) and more than one or two haunting images (a young woman who rips through a man's stomach to find the key needed to save her).Two constant themes with most films of this type are the intelligence of the villain and evil often being able to outwit good.  Both properties are well emphasized here.  I won't spoil anything, but I can also say with confidence that the ending is not happy, and it's definitely not what you'll be expecting.Though the acting is nothing spectacular and the movie was significantly underfunded, Saw entrances the viewer with a sweet, manaical storyline, an intricate cast of characters, and plot twist after unforgettable plot twist.  All in all, it ranks as one of the best films 2004 had to offer, resulting as a sinister combination of Seven and Identity.  It would be a true sin for any fan of psychological thrillers not to own this movie.",5,Morbidity at its Purest and Finest,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,1876,"['Thrillers', 'have', 'gone', 'gone', 'years', 'much', 'notice', 'great', 'film', 'were', 'dozen', 'more', 'lackluster', 'films', 'thrown', 'realm', 'apparent', 'purpose', 'Saw', 'trend', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'reasons', 'film', 'new', 'life', 'rapidly', 'dying', 'genre.This', 'film', 'places', 'Adam', 'Lawrence', 'single', 'room', 'objectives', 'one', 'escape', 'room', 'other', 'kill', 'fellow', 'prisoner', 'otherwise', 'family', 'Following', 'wake', 'Seven', 'movie', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer', 'renowned', 'allowing', 'victims', 'find', 'ways', 'kill', 'puzzle', 'unlucky', 'prisoners', 'start', 'finish', 'movie', 'unravels', 'bit', 'bit', 'slowly', 'revealing', 'critical', 'details', 'plot', 'surrounding', 'main', 'characters', 'killer', 'several', 'side', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'are', 'truly', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Adam', 'hunt', 'murderer', 'dark', 'using', 'camera', 'flash', 'more', 'one', 'two', 'haunting', 'images', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'stomach', 'find', 'key', 'needed', 'save', '.Two', 'constant', 'themes', 'most', 'films', 'type', 'are', 'intelligence', 'villain', 'evil', 'often', 'being', 'able', 'outwit', 'good', 'properties', 'are', 'well', 'emphasized', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'can', 'also', 'say', 'confidence', 'ending', 'not', 'happy', 'definitely', 'not', 'what', ""'ll"", 'be', 'acting', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'was', 'significantly', 'underfunded', 'Saw', 'viewer', 'sweet', 'manaical', 'storyline', 'intricate', 'cast', 'characters', 'plot', 'twist', 'unforgettable', 'plot', 'twist', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2004', 'had', 'offer', 'resulting', 'sinister', 'combination', 'Seven', 'Identity', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'sin', 'fan', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'not', 'own', 'movie']",N/A

This film skates the edge of ""trying to hard"", and in my opinion falls on the side of genuine. What I like is that this film is stepping in the right direction, away from teen horror flicks and the ""I'm a ghost and didn't know it"" flicks that seem to dominate the genre. One of this films strengths is that most of it plays out in a minimal environment, much like Reservoir Dogs, which places the focus of the suspense and horror on the character's actions, and helps keep the jump scares to a minimum. Like in Se7en, what is disturbing in this film is the choices the characters make and why, not just the environment they are in like in the Dawn of the Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes. I also think that most of the devices and situations are believable if not original. What I don't like is the reliance on the ""who dun it/surprise ending"" which I feel is five years past overdone and boring.

Well sorry to anyone who has the attention span of a rodent, but you actually have *gasps* think when watching this movie. Take you A.D.D. pills, sit down, and watch it again.Now that I'm done ranting, here's my review for the movie. Saw is brilliant, simply put. And to think, it was made in 18 days! Don't believe me? Watch the featurette, I think you'll change your mind. I won't bother explaining the plot, since I'd just be re-hashing what other people have said. This movie may not be as terrifying as, say, The Exorcist (the best horror movie EVER), but it's still awesome to watch, as you never lose interest and it really makes you appreciate life more. Like good taste said, all those emos out there need to watch this. There's plenty of realistic gore to keep your appetite of cinema blood satisfied (even though the guts of the guy Amanda was cutting through to get the key to her head lock were COMPLETELY cheesy), and at the same time, it leaves you with a powerful moral. So if you've given up on modern horror culture, check out Saw. It may not change your mind, but it's bound to entertain  you somehow.P.S. Check out Saw 2 as well.

In no way does this film disappoint, no matter what you are looking for in a film.Let's start with the story. Two young men--a doctor named Dr. Gordon, and a photographer named Adam--wake up chained to the wall in a dirty, old washroom. Neither of them know how they got there--and they don't know each other either. There is a slaughtered corpse between them eerily clutching a tape recorder and two tapes addressed to each of the men. The message is clear: one must find a way to kill the other by 6:00 that evening or they will both--along with Dr. Gordon's family--be killed.Before long, they realize they are now victims of the Jigsaw killer--a known serial killer who captures people who do not appreciate life and force them to hurt themselves or others in order to save themselves from a bloody, gruesome, brutal, torturous death. In a series of flashbacks, ze discover more about Jigsaw, and experience previous encounters his victims' have had. We learn of Gordon and Adam's past, an obsessed detective dedicated to finding Jigsaw, and a young drug addict named Amanda who survived Jigsaw's sick ""games"" and is now mentally scarred. As the story unfolds, it suddenly explodes into a brilliantly twisted psychological thriller that  will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll after the shock ending and even for some time after that. Lots of hardcore gore and an INCREDIBLY SCARY atmosphere accompany this much-above-average slasher flick.The acting is both great and dreadful at different times, but is always thoroughly realistic. Jigsaw is perfectly cast in his role. Adam was sort of an annoying character, but still managed to deliver, and Dr. Gordon seemed like some WAY overdramatic guy out of Star Trek, and was the only character in the small cast I was actually hoping to get killed.The directing and editing is absolutely nothing to rave about and is solely why I didn't give Saw 5 stars. The flashbacks are adequetly done, sometimes poorly, but unfortunately, for a super psychological horror film like Saw, that is a huge failure and deserves negative feedback. Very fortunately, the strong storyline and sheer terrifying simple atmosphere holds the film together.Overall--a very enjoyable movie watching experience, and it will scare the living daylights out of you if you watch it alone on a big screen with surround sound. Not one for the little kids however, as it is very violent in some select scenes (particularly the ending) but that shouldn't keep you from seeing it.

I enjoy films ala Event Horizon or Hellraiser (I and II) much more.This movie does very well keeping you guessing. Not until the very end does it reveal its cards. For that it kept my attention from stem to stern.The style of the movie - some of the quick cuts and shifting around in the story. They did it well for what they were trying to go for. For that, I'm not critical. Its just not my favored way to tell a story. I understood the story with no problems. I'm just no fan of ""flashback"" sequences when they are overused.The writers do a good job playing on our fears of confinement.  That dirty, nasty bathroom was a perfect scene to augment those fears.Overall, its a decent movie. A creative style killer who doesn't kill you, but mindf*cks you forcing you to do something that sickens you to live - I found that refreshing. The ending is most definetly not a ""feel good"" type either. For that it wins points too.

O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","One of the best new horror sagas to launch in the last fifteen years - and maybe one of the best horror sagas of all time - begins here, as ""Saw"" introduces the world to Jigsaw, one of the most original and deadly serial killers in movie history.Unseen for most of the movie and known only through electronically-distorted voice recordings, or through videotapes in which a disturbing little puppet speaks for him, Jigsaw kills no one directly, instead capturing his victims in brutal death-traps where they're challenged to figure out clues and ways to escape their fate - and to be able to survive the arduous tests and obstacles in their way.  In the case of the main victims in this first chapter of the series, two men slowly come to conciousness chained to sturdy metal pipes inside a run-down lavatory, to meet with the encouraging sight of a bloodied corpse lying face-down on the floor between them.  There are small cassette players within easy reach, and these have messages on them leading the men to their first and most obvious (though certainly not the most preferable) means of possible escape - a small handsaw that's insufficient to cut the chains but may be capable of slicing through other substances.Jigsaw is ingenious and ruthless, preying on his victims's paranoias, their guilts, suspicions about one another (in cases where more than one person occupies the same trap) and fears about their loved ones on the outside.  The angle of Jigsaw preying on those who he considers flawed and unappreciative of life, in order to teach them the value of being alive, is well-known; without commenting here on how this thread develops through the further entries, I found that in this opening chapter, that scenario rang hollow.  It is certainly Jigsaw's rationale, but it seemed only to be an excuse for the character to engage in his fiendish games.  And, oddly enough, it worked out to the betterment - the killer who's found the moral justification, at least in his own mind, to rid himself of any mercies or compassion and to engage in as much sadism as suits him.  This is just one viewer's interpretation, and only of what we see in this first movie; but here it makes Jigsaw very disturbing, very scary, and frighteningly believable.As the conclusion approaches, the twists begin to turn, culminating in a bloodchillingly shocking final realization.  An excellent beginning for a series that's, so far, providing one of the year's top movies each October.

It never feels quite sure of itself.  Saw is creepy now and then, when it's not beating you over the head with its creepiness.  It makes the movie Seven (a much better movie) seem downright wholesome, taking grimey ambiance to new lows.Where this film really fails is in communicating any sense of real urgency or in creating any sustained tension.  These failings are noticable immediately when we see how quickly our two ""protagonists"" adapt to their grim circumstance.

I've been hard-pressed to find a truly horrifying horror movie over the last few years, and finally they give us Saw. It was worth the wait. It's mentally thrilling as well as full of gore, particularly if you get the uncut version, which I wish I'd waited for but I'm just too impatient. The uncut version has a cooler cover but it also has more gore to it. After viewing the uncut version (which my best friend has) it was easy to see why they cut some of those scenes to make it more movie-friendly for those who are too squeamish. You'll have a lot of fun trying to figure out the game in this movie, and when the ending comes you'll be quite surprised. At least I was.

But the parallels are very obvious to anyone who's seen them.As 2 people wake up chained to the walls of a toilet of an abandoned factory with a corpse lying in the middle of the room, the expectable questions arise in their minds: ""How did we get here"". ""What's going on?"". ""Who is that corpse"". Soon they find out that they've become a central piece in the game of a psycho who's teaching them a lesson which they don't understand. We as viewers are given more clues to figure it all out than they have, but as the thread unreels we have a disturbingly lingering sense that what we are let to know is pure deception. Their choices? To either kill each other or free themselves by sawing off one of their chained legs.Sounds like this could get pretty gory, correct? Not really, as the main premise of the ""Saw"" is a purely mental one, in the sense that it's more aiming to be a sarcastic mindgame on the viewer rather than a cheap thrill gorefest. The violence is mostly implied and the violent scenes are actually few (keeping in mind what this could've become).The film succeeds with flying colours in its mission then, as noone will easily resist trying to find out who the evil game-maker is. But as the clues pile up and the atmosphere goes from dark to darker so do the twists. Speaking of twists, there are so many here that the script writer walks a very thin line actually. The storyline is in danger of tipping over any single minute but this is a job ultimately well done. Aside of one single plot mistake (albeit sizey)  that i spotted right at the very end, the rest of the film is actually rock-solid. And even this one mistake will be inevitably excused because ""Saw"" offers a tremendous ride throughout to those that like their minds tested.This is then the best asset of the film. It's not just a mere ""whodunnit"" flick but also a very stylistic dark film that will surely enter the pantheon of great thrillers in recent time.The atmosphere keeps being in heavy competition with the excellent plot and in the end noone really cares who wins that contest. You want to see the story unraveling and you become increasingly addicted to the darkness oozing out of the screen.On top of that, with the exception of Danny Glover, the main characters are wisely chosen to be 2 not known actors who do a more than just decent job delivering their parts. The dialogue is up to par with the rest of the film and overall ""Saw"" wins the bet with itself in highly convincing fashion.No need to get into the details of the plot here.

There are so many disconnects in logic and narrative throughout this movie but they are only apparent in retrospect, when the movie ends and you are shown what was ""really"" going on. First of all, the villain is first seen as an incapacitated patient with an inoperable brain tumor, but we are expected to believe that he can find the time, money and energy to organize and engineer the monumentally complicated traps in which he places his victims. And, no, you can't fake the neurological, opthalmological and laboratory manifestations of a brain tumor, and you sure as hell can't fake a massive brain tumor on your own MRI scan, so don't tell me this was all just part of the villain's plan. It's bogus and nonsensical.I mentioned the complicated traps. I mean they are WAY complicated. Every detail, every contingency, every nuance has been anticipated and thought out to the ten thousandth degree. The planning, the execution, the timing, the physical construction of the settings for the traps..hell, it would take months if not a year to put all this together. It simply rings false. It is not believable, and this inability to believe and trust in the story contaminates the viewer's enjoyment of the film. Now we come to a plot device that the writers fall back on several times during Saw, the ""slow acting poison."" We are asked repeatedly to believe that the characters are acting as they do because they believe they have ingested ""slow acting poison."" They act completely irrationally, violently, and become all caught up in these mega-complex scenarios all because they believe they are dying from ""slow-acting poison""? Doesn't anyone  go to the Emergency Room? Sorry, slow acting poison sounds like a lazy plot device from a second-rate high school play, not the engine that drives a major motion picture.Now, let's talk about the acting. Bad. Embarrassingly, amateurishly bad. Sometimes, especially when the actor who plays the doctor is speaking, the acting literally struck me like a satire of bad acting. I half-expected him to wink at the camera.Dammit, you may ask, why can't I just relax, suspend my critical faculties, and simply enjoy the movie for what it is, instead of condemn it for what it isn't? Here's why. This ain't that kind of movie. Yeah, when I watched the Exorcist, or the Omen, or the Shining, yes, those movies don't pretend that they are based in gritty reality and don't depend on our familiarity with serial killers, religious psychopaths and other wingnuts in order to obtain their scariness. This movie,like Seven, is grounded in the fact that the audience knows there are really creepy people in the world, and it is this connection with our own reality that is supposed to give the movie its power. Seven succeeded. This movie, however, fails. We can't suspend disbelief, like we do when we watch the Shining, but we are still jarred into disbelief by preposterous plot elements and wretched acting. The viewer is stuck, unable to believe, unable to suspend disbelief, waiting for the credits to roll.

873699,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0006SSOHC,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 4]","When I saw this movie in the theatres, I left thinking with mixed thoughts.  On one hand, this movie is incredibly raw and visceral.  It gets under your skin with its disturbing images and ideas.  On the other hand, we have the most horrible acting jobs by some very talented AAA actors.Danny Glover plays a cop who is tracking the Jigsaw killer.  Cary Elwes is playing one of the possible victims of said killer who finds himself locked in a dingy restroom with two people, one in the center of the room who apparently blew his brains out and another unfortunate soul locked on the other end of the restroom.It seems that the Jigsaw killer has been kidnapping people and finds ingenuously creepy ways for them to kill themselves.  He never really does the act of it, but makes it so that it's virtually impossible for one to survive.That is the premise for the movie, and I won't spoil anything else.  Part of the reason I liked this movie was because of the pacing.  I found the movie to be expertly paced, with mounting tension and a lot of dread.  You wonder how or even if the two victims will ever make it out alive.  The other reason I enjoyed the movie was the way it set up the past of former victims and current victims, even pulling in Danny Glover's character in interesting ways.  There is a thread that holds everyone together and I found it incredibly fascinating.One thing reviewers have aptly mentioned is the gore.  This movie was a few shots over the R rating and had to be scaled down.  It is not for the squeamish.  If you've seen Se7en, you'll understand a portion of what the movie has to offer.  It's actually very surreal like Se7en and I think that movie is the closest I can compare to Saw.So, we have great pacing, good actors, an interesting (if ultimately unplausable in some spoiler aspects which I won't mention) story, good gore and some nice suspence.  What holds it back?  The acting.  The acting is amateurish in spots and really detracts from at least two major scenes.  Where it really hurts the movie is at the climax.  This is supposed to be a fearsome, horrible, scary moment and instead I laughed because of Cary Elwes.  I hate to say it, but it really ruined what suspense had been building.My other complaint with the climatic moment involving the title stems from a very sudden change in the character.  You know it's going to happen because it's been talked about constantly.  Yet, the motivation for the character to do it seemed a bit forced.  I think it would have been much much more effective if we saw the GRADUAL drive towards the act, not an instant jump.  I think his character could have been more effectively developed.  But that is just a preference as a plot buff.My 4 star review, then, comes from the fact that the movie was done a very small budget.  They shot the entire movie in 18 days because they could not afford any longer.  That means that each scene was not really a ""final cut.""  Instead they had to go with first or second takes simply because of funding.  The acting becomes understandable under that constraint.In the end, this movie doesn't have many jump out, cheap scares.  It has a more subtle terror that gets under your skin and makes you look under your car and in your closet before you go to sleep.  It's terrifying in a non-normal Hollywood way.

873700,A3PCIH7XDZGLHL,B0006SSOHC,TheFracturedCritic,"[1, 3]","Lately it seems as though movies are just being thrown out into the open without much word or hype about them. You see a preview in the theatre one week, the next week you see it on TV a few times and two weeks later it's playing. Such was the case with Saw, a grizzly thriller about two men locked in a room and being forced to play a maniac's game to escape. I had in fact seen this movie previewed once in the theatre (which sparked my initial interest in it) and only once or twice on TV.So going into Saw I didn't expect much (something I've learned to do nowadays in order to be able to sit through some of the monstrosities Hollywood throws out at us) and suprisingly I came out, while a bit sick to my stomach, having seen what was one of the more suspenseful movies I'd seen in a while.Saw is the story of two men, Adam and Lawrence, kidnapped and then stuck in a room forced to participate in a maniac's game to escape. They are both given tapes to start off with that tell them what is going, the conditions of escape and that there are clues in the very room that they are in to help them out. Unlike Adam though, Lawrence's wife and daughter have been kidnapped and the only way to set them free is for him to kill Adam before six o' clock.Also thrown into the mix is Detective David Tapp, a cop who becomes obessesed with the 'Jigsaw Killer' (the name given to the twisted man who creates these games) and is convinced it is actually Lawrence who is behind these crimes.Now out all of the reviews I've read for this movie, I've seen it get a lot of reports. Sure this won't be the greatest movie you'll see all year and it probably won't stand out in your mind as much as many others you'll see this year will (other than the gritty violence and the tense scenes), but it still stands a well thought, well directed film. By far, though, the biggest downer this movie is the acting. It is absolutely horrible, but if you can look past that then you just might enjoy what you see (if you can stomach it).Instead of being a switch between two men stuck in a room and the events occuring with the other characters outside of it, the movie mixes it up some (and I believe this is one of it's major strong points). In between sequences of what's occuring in the present we see flashbacks of what the character's lives were like before and previous encounters of the Jigsaw Killer's madness. Since the two main characters are stuck in the room for the entire movie this formula was probably the only one they could've used to make the movie work like it did.If you're going for a grizzly psycological thriller, by far your best bet is Seven. However, Saw does provide some genuinely tense and scary moments. With a great ending and an intelligent and well though out plot, Saw definitely is one to catch in theatres. Not for the faint of heart and definitely not one for those can't stomach much, but if your up for it then I highly recommend it. For a flick that will probably require multiple viewings to grasp everything there is to offer, Saw definitely ranks high up there. With a few rough edges and potential to be a little more than what it was, I still give Saw a 7 out of 10 (or 4 stars).",4,Saw,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,3205,"['Lately', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'being', 'thrown', 'out', 'open', 'much', 'word', 'hype', 'see', 'preview', 'theatre', 'one', 'week', 'next', 'week', 'see', 'TV', 'few', 'times', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'playing', 'Such', 'was', 'case', 'Saw', 'grizzly', 'thriller', 'two', 'men', 'locked', 'room', 'being', 'forced', 'play', 'maniac', 'game', 'escape', 'had', 'fact', 'seen', 'movie', 'previewed', 'once', 'theatre', 'sparked', 'initial', 'interest', 'only', 'once', 'twice', 'TV.So', 'going', 'Saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'something', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'do', 'nowadays', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'monstrosities', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'suprisingly', 'came', 'out', 'bit', 'sick', 'stomach', 'having', 'seen', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'movies', ""'d"", 'seen', 'while.Saw', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'Adam', 'Lawrence', 'kidnapped', 'then', 'stuck', 'room', 'forced', 'participate', 'maniac', 'game', 'escape', 'are', 'given', 'tapes', 'start', 'off', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'conditions', 'escape', 'are', 'clues', 'very', 'room', 'are', 'help', 'out', 'Adam', 'Lawrence', 'wife', 'daughter', 'have', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'only', 'way', 'set', 'free', 'kill', 'Adam', 'six', 'o', 'clock.Also', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Detective', 'David', 'Tapp', 'cop', 'who', 'obessesed', ""'Jigsaw"", 'Killer', 'name', 'given', 'twisted', 'man', 'who', 'games', 'convinced', 'actually', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'crimes.Now', 'out', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'get', 'lot', 'reports', 'Sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'greatest', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'year', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'others', ""'ll"", 'see', 'year', 'will', 'other', 'gritty', 'violence', 'tense', 'scenes', 'still', 'well', 'thought', 'well', 'directed', 'film', 'far', 'biggest', 'downer', 'movie', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'can', 'look', 'then', 'just', 'might', 'enjoy', 'what', 'see', 'can', 'stomach', '.Instead', 'being', 'switch', 'two', 'men', 'stuck', 'room', 'events', 'occuring', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'mixes', 'up', 'believe', 'one', 'major', 'strong', 'points', 'sequences', 'what', 'occuring', 'present', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'what', 'character', 'lives', 'were', 'previous', 'encounters', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer', 'madness', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'stuck', 'room', 'entire', 'movie', 'formula', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'one', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'make', 'movie', 'work', ""'re"", 'going', 'grizzly', 'psycological', 'thriller', 'far', 'best', 'bet', 'Seven', 'However', 'Saw', 'provide', 'genuinely', 'tense', 'scary', 'moments', 'great', 'ending', 'intelligent', 'well', 'plot', 'Saw', 'definitely', 'one', 'catch', 'theatres', 'Not', 'faint', 'heart', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'much', 'up', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'flick', 'will', 'probably', 'require', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'grasp', 'everything', 'there', 'offer', 'Saw', 'definitely', 'high', 'there', 'few', 'rough', 'edges', 'potential', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'still', 'give', 'Saw', '7', '10', '4', 'stars']",N/A

The overall premise is very clever:  A young man (played by Whannell, who also wrote the film) and an established physician (a much heavier, less charismatic Cary Elwes than in previous works) wake up in a disgusting, polluted bathroom and have no recollection of how and why they wound up there.  They are chained to the walls and accompanied by only one guest-a dead man with his head blown off.  As the doctor and his youthful companion piece the puzzle together, they realize that they are being tormented by the infamous ""Jigsaw"" killer, a maniac who juxtaposes his victims within scenarios in which they have to choice between their own lives or the deaths of others.  The identity of the killer is unknown, but as the truth from both of the captured men seeps through, the film picks up momentum and unfolds to a rather incomplete, far-from-stanch climax.Danny Glover stars as the aging detective who was originally assigned to the ""Jigsaw"" case, but was unable to completely close the case.  Due to an increasingly devote fascination with the killer, the detective attempts to stop the evil murderer once and for all.  ""Saw"" does possess some pizzazz and intelligence, using Elwes and Co. as players in a strange and macabre game of chess; however, the film is too disjointed and acted with such mediocrity that it cannot be taken too seriously.

Nope.""Saw"" is a hack-job of a movie, cribbed from superior scripts like ""Se7en"" and ""The Cube,"" where victims get lured into totally illogical situations in some psychopath's attempt at teaching them a lesson. But ""Saw"" completely lacks ""The Cube's"" fascist police state backdrop or ""Se7en's"" gruesome moral bent. Instead, two random men, (writer/director Leigh Whannel and Cary Elwes) are trapped in some music video concept of a warehouse bathroom with a dead man, gun and tape deck between them. And things go downhill from there.Cary Elwes' acting is so strident that he becomes funny by the final act, as he simply just doesn't have the chops to portray that madness he's succumbing to. Danny Glover - obviously slumming it - turns into a hysterical twit as time rolls on. Whannel is so cardboard that you need only to look at his other credentials to understand how he got his part. Dialogue is beyond corny. And that's just the actors.When you get to the script, the continuity is howlingly laughable. Men step from bathtubs and are dry. Items removed from water are also dry.

It eventually turned out to be a far different film that I ever thought, being far more of a psychological thriller than the crazed, serial/slasher film that it seemed to be advertised as being.Saw opens with two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) being held captive in a dingy, grimy, foul, and mold infested bathroom.  The bathroom from hell, literally.  They are both chained by the ankle to pipes at opposite ends of the bathroom, neither one knowing how they got there or why.  Between them lies a corpse, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.  They each find a micro-cassette in their pocket as a voice ridicules them as to the reason they are held captive.  Gordon is told he must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife and child will be killed.  They also find two hacksaws...too weak to cut through their chains, Gordon realizes they are for cutting through their own ankles if the want to be free.Through flashbacks told by Gordon, we learn of a maniac called the Jigsaw killer.  He plays a deadly game with people, putting them in horrific traps with a small chance of escape where they usually end up killing themselves.  But who is he and why is he doing this?  We learn that Gordon himself was a suspect and investigated by detectives including Tapp (Danny Glover).  Tapp eventually is dismissed from the force when he becomes obsessed with Gordon after his partner is killed by the Jigsaw Killer.Saw is a heavy-handed thriller/horror.  The killer has his warped, moralistic reasons for doing what he does such as trapping a prostitute in a mask that will rip her face apart unless she locates the key for the trap inside the stomach of a corpse.  The Killer seemingly goes after victims who don't have a greater appreciation for life and this does somewhat give away a major plot surprise as James Wan simply was not subtle enough to handle it more deftly.Elwes and Whannell give fine performances as the two men driven to the edge of sanity by their ordeal and one wishes that more time was spent building the tension between the two, rather than with so many flashback scenes.  It is in this dark, dank cell where the movie is at it's best.  Being in a place like this would make anyone cringe and run screaming.  Being held captive there would be one's own private hell.If SaW is guilty of one thing it's perhaps that it tries to be a little to clever for its own good.  It tries to throw a few too many curve balls at viewers to throw them off the track but in doing so, allows one to basically eliminate every character from suspicion out of general principle.  And of course there's little doubt that the film was made with the idea of a sequel already planned.An effective thriller, more for the mood and settings than for the actual plot, but a well done effort.",4,"DIRTY, GRIMY, FILTHY AND ORIGINAL",1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,2956,"['fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'who', 'lot', 'industry', 'magazines', 'had', 'read', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'long', 'even', 'hit', 'theatres', 'eventually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'different', 'film', 'ever', 'thought', 'being', 'far', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'crazed', 'serial/slasher', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'advertised', 'being.Saw', 'two', 'men', 'Adam', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Gordon', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'dingy', 'grimy', 'foul', 'mold', 'infested', 'bathroom', 'bathroom', 'hell', 'literally', 'are', 'chained', 'ankle', 'pipes', 'opposite', 'ends', 'bathroom', 'one', 'knowing', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'why', 'Between', 'corpse', 'dead', 'self-inflicted', 'gunshot', 'head', 'find', 'micro-cassette', 'pocket', 'voice', 'reason', 'are', 'held', 'captive', 'Gordon', 'told', 'must', 'kill', 'Adam', '6:00', 'wife', 'child', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'also', 'find', 'two', 'hacksaws', 'too', 'weak', 'cut', 'chains', 'Gordon', 'are', 'cutting', 'own', 'ankles', 'want', 'be', 'free.Through', 'flashbacks', 'told', 'Gordon', 'learn', 'maniac', 'called', 'Jigsaw', 'killer', 'deadly', 'game', 'people', 'putting', 'horrific', 'traps', 'small', 'chance', 'escape', 'where', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'who', 'why', 'doing', 'learn', 'Gordon', 'was', 'suspect', 'investigated', 'detectives', 'including', 'Tapp', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Tapp', 'eventually', 'dismissed', 'force', 'when', 'obsessed', 'Gordon', 'partner', 'killed', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer.Saw', 'heavy-handed', 'thriller/horror', 'killer', 'warped', 'moralistic', 'reasons', 'doing', 'what', 'such', 'trapping', 'prostitute', 'mask', 'will', 'rip', 'face', 'apart', 'key', 'trap', 'stomach', 'corpse', 'Killer', 'seemingly', 'victims', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'life', 'somewhat', 'give', 'away', 'major', 'plot', 'surprise', 'James', 'Wan', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'subtle', 'enough', 'handle', 'more', 'deftly.Elwes', 'Whannell', 'give', 'fine', 'performances', 'two', 'men', 'driven', 'edge', 'sanity', 'ordeal', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'building', 'tension', 'two', 'rather', 'so', 'many', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'dark', 'dank', 'cell', 'where', 'movie', 'best', 'Being', 'place', 'would', 'make', 'anyone', 'cringe', 'run', 'screaming', 'Being', 'held', 'captive', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'own', 'private', 'hell.If', 'SaW', 'guilty', 'one', 'thing', 'perhaps', 'be', 'little', 'clever', 'own', 'good', 'throw', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'curve', 'balls', 'viewers', 'throw', 'off', 'track', 'doing', 'so', 'one', 'basically', 'eliminate', 'character', 'suspicion', 'general', 'principle', 'course', 'little', 'doubt', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'idea', 'sequel', 'already', 'planned.An', 'effective', 'thriller', 'more', 'mood', 'settings', 'actual', 'plot', 'well', 'done', 'effort']",N/A

The suspense builds throughout the movie and the death scenes are fairly chilling.  The ending is somewhat disappointing... It was the old ""last minute surprise twist"" ending that has been overused since season 2 of Scooby Doo.  I also felt it owed a bit too much to Seven, which is a superior film.  I noticed some reviewers complained about Cary Elwes' over the top performance... While I agree that it was over the top, I don't think it took anything away from the movie.  I felt that it even provided a little bizarre comic relief (especially towards the end).  I'm glad I saw it.  It was a nasty little serial killer movie with an above average plot and execution.  I don't think it's fair to say it's on the same level as ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Seven"".  However, it is in the same genre as those films.  It has more of a raw, dark psychological thiriller feel, as opposed to straight horror (like ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" - which is the best serial killer horror movie of all time, in my opinion).

873711,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B0006SSOHC,Tom Birkenstock,"[0, 3]","The original Saw opens up with an interesting premise. Two guys wake up in a room together...no, it's not that kind of movie! They're both chained to the wall and given a...wait for it, wait for it...SAW! Through the course of the film they have to follow various clues in order to find a way out of the room. There is also a countdown they have to worry about.The writers aren't able to make this premise fully work, and are forced to resort to flashbacks and a side story involving Danny Glover. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. First, because the flashbacks allow us to see Jigsaw's, the mysterious villain, more elaborate traps. Second, because you just can't complain when Murtaugh is on screen.The Jigsaw traps are clever, and involve barbed wire, someone getting burned to death, and a contraption that could potentially tear off someone's jaw. I won't get into too much detail for those of you who haven't seen this movie. I'll save the spoilers for later.There's a lot of nitpicking you could do on the first two-thirds of the film. For example, the flashback are supposed to be told by one character but include things he never would have seen or known about, the camera effects are annoying, and the surviving victim has a really dumb line. I was able to ignore these because it was an interesting premise and had potential. However, I was unable to ignore the last third of the film which had some of the laziest screenwriting I've seen in a while.**Spoiler Alert** **Spoiler Alert** **Spoiler Alert** **Spoiler...oh, you get the idea.Cary Elwes gets out of character at the end of the film. For most of the movie he's a calm and collected, but turns on the overacting button at the very end. This isn't all his fault because he has to sell certain actions that make no sense. Early in the film Elwes' character, Dr. Gordon, tells Adam, the other man in the room, to use his shirt to get an object out of reach. At the end of the film Dr. Gordon has to reach a cell phone in order to find out if his family is all right. Instead of following his own advice, he decides to cut off his own leg. I know everybody's been waiting for this the entire film, but does it have to be so contrived. The worst part is that he does take off his shirt, but instead of using it to get the phone he uses it as a tourniquet!One of the big surprises of the film is that the man who we've been lead to believe is Jigsaw is in fact merely being used by Jigsaw. It turns out that Jigsaw has given him a poison and won't give him the antidote unless he follows his instructions. We've seen this character before as an orderly at a hospital. Let me repeat that: he works at a hospital. So, instead of telling one of his coworkers that he's been poisoned, he decides to get involved with an elaborate scheme of kidnapping, and even goes so far as to try and kill someone. I know that if I was presented with those two choices I would definitely go for the latter.The single big surprise the filmmakers graciously leave for the end is the identity of Jigsaw. Jigsaw is actually a cancer patient we see for a total of three seconds during the movie. It also turns out that the dead body is not actually dead, but this same cancer patient who has been sitting there perfectly still for the entire movie. Whoa! You mean to tell me that extra number 37 was Jigsaw this entire time? No way! I should have guessed, it was right in front of me the whole time.I've seen better twist endings from a Scooby-Doo episode. That's not hyperbole either. If you want to see how it should be done check out The Usual Suspects or the original Scream. Those are surprise endings where you don't feel cheated.It's a real shame that the writers came up with such an original idea, but chose to get incredibly lazy for the last third of the movie. If you really want to see a well done horror film that actually uses one set, go check out Cube.

After all with its cheap 1.2 million budget you wouldn't think it would be possible for Saw to be the highest grossing franchise in horror history. Saw is labeled as horror but it's much more complex than that, there's a lot of psychology involved. For instance the main character John Kramer, known as Jigsaw because he removes a puzzle piece from the skin of his victims, is labeled as a serial killer but it goes deeper than that. Jigsaw chooses his victims very carefully, he selects persons because 1) they don't appreciate life or 2) they've done something really wrong. He is testing their will to live trough his ""games"" which are traps that often necessitate the victims to lose a body part or to go to extremes. You see, Jigsaw's goal is not to kill but rather to have the survivors enjoy life; it's a therapy he made. Saw puts photographer Adam and Doctor Lawrence in a disuse industrial bathroom both with their ankle chained, I the plot is now known enough that I don't need to explain what happens next.Saw became a phenomenon and in my opinion is one the best horror movie of the 2000s decade; it gave the horror genre a boost and inspired other movies.

A gratuitous, if often successfully creepy exercise in sadomasochistic filmmaking, Saw features some of the worst acting I have ever seen in a mainstream film with an experienced cast. That is the film's undoing. Making something that could've been geniuinely creepy absolutely laughable! How far would you go to save your own life? Prepare yourself for a gut-wrenching trip into the heart of terror with SAW, Lions Gate Films' gripping horror film starring Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter and Leigh Whannell. Obsessed with teaching his victims the value of life, a deranged, sadistic serial killer is abducting morally wayward people and forcing them to play macabre games for their own survival. Faced with impossible choices, each victim must struggle to win back his/her life, or else die trying...A young man named Adam wakes to find himself chained to a rusty pipe inside a decrepit subterranean chamber. Chained to the opposite side of the room is another bewildered captive, Dr. Lawrence Gordon Between them is a dead man lying in a pool of blood, holding a .38 in his hand. Neither man knows why he has been abducted, but instructions left on a microcassette order Dr. Gordon to kill Adam within eight hours. If he fails to do so, then both men will die; Dr. Gordon's wife, Alison and his daughter will also be killed. Recalling a recent murder investigation by a police detective named Tapp Dr. Gordon realizes he and Adam are the next victims of a psychopathic genius known only as ""Jigsaw."" With only a few hours left to spare, they must unravel the elaborate puzzle of their fate in the midst of mounting terror.

Let me say, color me impressed, this isn't your typical slasher series. Tobin Bell does a very creepy charecter, but he's a demented genius concerning what he thinks of in the series. This makes SCREAM look like Disney, I only have two complaints-the violence is very graphic, and doing 8 parts maybe overkill, no pun intended. However, I do look forward to the rest of them. A word of caution though, the images in these films will Not leave your mind easily, they could also cause nausea for anyone with a weak stomache, so if that's the case you may want to avoid them...like a disease.August 08,2010I've seen the whole series at least 4 times as of recent. I also recently purchased/watched the 2-disc uncut edition. Let me start by saying the uncut is not much different than the theatrical version-the twist never fails me either. The special features are plentiful unlike the first DVD edition. I do feel that Lionsgate should've retained the traditional clear case/dust cover treatment with the 2-disc. Are there any added scenes with the uncut version? Not really, dialogue is a little different in the end scene, but it doesn't ruin the story, I don't have the blu-ray edition yet but that may change. The plot of the whole series (to me, at least) is alot more impressivethan I ever expected, in part one-the game per se, involves two men shackled in an abandoned restroom and they're trying to figure out how and why they are there, the twist at the end makes my jaw drop every time.",4,"SAW...to experience or enjoy, that's the question.",1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,1664,"[""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'first', 'four', 'so', 'far', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'interest', 'series', 'started', 'months', 'people', 'trying', 'get', 'give', 'shot', 'Let', 'say', 'color', 'impressed', ""n't"", 'typical', 'slasher', 'series', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'very', 'creepy', 'charecter', 'demented', 'genius', 'concerning', 'what', 'series', 'SCREAM', 'look', 'Disney', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'complaints-the', 'violence', 'very', 'graphic', 'doing', '8', 'parts', 'maybe', 'overkill', 'pun', 'intended', 'However', 'do', 'look', 'forward', 'rest', 'word', 'caution', 'images', 'films', 'will', 'Not', 'leave', 'mind', 'easily', 'could', 'also', 'cause', 'nausea', 'anyone', 'weak', 'stomache', 'so', 'case', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'disease.August', '08,2010I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'whole', 'series', 'least', '4', 'times', 'recent', 'also', 'recently', 'purchased/watched', '2-disc', 'uncut', 'edition', 'Let', 'start', 'saying', 'uncut', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'theatrical', 'version-the', 'twist', 'never', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'plentiful', 'first', 'DVD', 'edition', 'do', 'feel', 'Lionsgate', 'should', ""'ve"", 'retained', 'traditional', 'clear', 'case/dust', 'cover', 'treatment', '2-disc', 'Are', 'there', 'added', 'scenes', 'uncut', 'version', 'Not', 'really', 'dialogue', 'little', 'different', 'end', 'scene', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'yet', 'may', 'change', 'plot', 'whole', 'series', 'least', 'alot', 'more', 'impressivethan', 'ever', 'expected', 'part', 'one-the', 'game', 'se', 'two', 'men', 'shackled', 'abandoned', 'restroom', ""'re"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'twist', 'end', 'jaw', 'drop', 'time']",N/A

873718,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006SSOHC,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","Director James Wan and writer (and star) Leigh Whannel met each other at Australia, where they developed their friendship.  They established friendship there, and made this film, which has been picked up the marverick indie company Lions Gate Films for Holloween release.Now, the premise is intriguing.  Two guys are chained (literally) to the walls of a filthy disused restroom, both apart from each other, and in between them lies an apparently dead body soaked in blood.  They cannot untie the chain, and the room is perfectly sealed.  It's the beginning of the game, set by the serial killer called 'Jigsaw.!And two guys, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Wannel himself) try to figure out how to get out of this place.  Obviouly the third person has hidden the clues there as to the escape, or the reasons for their predicament.  And they will see that if they fail to do something by the time appointed, they must stay there for the rest of their lives.Intersting, isn't it?  The film often gives very intense moments (which include gore and violence) but the sad thing is that the script cannot hold the initial tension for long.  If you imagine the film like 'Cube' (in which the camera does not leave the cubic areas), you are mistaken, for the camera goes out of it, to show us other characters like Danny Glover's cop who chases the murderer, or Monica Potter as poor doctor's wife.And that's the problem, for in spite of the occasional intense moments, the film fails to use its premise to the full.  It unwisely includes the incredible coincidences and unexplained (or inconvincing) motive of the character(s), especially that of the killer.  Frankly, I don't believe it.  Compared with this, the killer of 'Se7en' is more plausible.Plus the opinions will divide about the ending, which is full of impact, I admit, but after a while you might start to think, 'Can this person really do that?' or 'Is this person (I mean, the killer) capable of doing that, chaining the two perfectly heathy guys?'  Sorry, but I don't believe that either.Anyway, as a thriller, it is done with a certain flair for visuals, and the filmmakers' guts to tuckle the morbid material should not be dismissed.

Instead, it became the surprise horror hit of 2004, birthed a new killer icon--the Jigsaw Killer, prompted two sequels (so far), earned over $100 million worldwide, and revived the movie career of Cary Elwes.The film opens in a disgusting, dirty, disused, and probably diseased bathroom with two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) chained at opposite ends of the room to pipes by their ankles with an apparent dead man lying between them. The dead guy holds a tape player and a handgun and each of the men has a tape in their back pocket. They each play their tapes: one is threatened, but the other isn't. Dr. Gordon must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife and daughter will die. The men discover hacksaws in a toilet, but fail to cut through their chains. Time is running out. Meanwhile, Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) is hunting Jigsaw as the movie flashbacks to scenes showing some of Jigsaw's other victims. Jigsaw wears a giant puppet head and he never actually kills his victims himself. Instead, he forces them to kill themselves or to kill each other, the whole time watching his little ""game"" which he believes is a public service to set people free (think of a psychotic and murderous Tyler Burden from FIGHT CLUB). Put it all together and it makes for one bizarre movie.Personally, I found SAW to be better than I had expected it to. The idea of a gamemaster who doesn't actually kill anyone himself but lets them do what he wants them to, is an interesting concept. Danny Glover is a pleasure to watch on film and it was nice to see Cary Elwes again, even if his performance was terrible. There's a lot of blood and guts in the film, though much of it has been toned down through editing and lighting, yet there are some things that the filmmakers leave up to one's imagination.Overall, even though SAW is pretty much an average horror flick, it has enough sparks of originality to make it one cut above the rest.",4,A Cut Above the Rest,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,2125,"['unoriginal', 'script', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'limited', 'budget', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'twist', 'cop-out', 'ending', 'SAW', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'washed-up', 'horror', 'movie', 'Instead', 'became', 'surprise', 'horror', 'hit', '2004', 'birthed', 'new', 'killer', 'icon', 'Jigsaw', 'Killer', 'prompted', 'two', 'sequels', 'so', 'far', 'earned', '100', 'million', 'worldwide', 'revived', 'movie', 'career', 'Cary', 'Elwes.The', 'film', 'disgusting', 'dirty', 'disused', 'probably', 'diseased', 'bathroom', 'two', 'men', 'Adam', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'Dr.', 'Lawrence', 'Gordon', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'chained', 'opposite', 'ends', 'room', 'pipes', 'ankles', 'apparent', 'dead', 'man', 'lying', 'dead', 'guy', 'tape', 'player', 'handgun', 'men', 'tape', 'back', 'pocket', 'play', 'tapes', 'one', 'threatened', 'other', ""n't"", 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'must', 'kill', 'Adam', '6:00', 'wife', 'daughter', 'will', 'die', 'men', 'hacksaws', 'toilet', 'fail', 'cut', 'chains', 'Time', 'running', 'out', 'Meanwhile', 'Detective', 'David', 'Tapp', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'hunting', 'Jigsaw', 'movie', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Jigsaw', 'other', 'victims', 'Jigsaw', 'giant', 'puppet', 'head', 'never', 'actually', 'victims', 'Instead', 'kill', 'kill', 'other', 'whole', 'time', 'watching', 'little', 'game', 'public', 'service', 'set', 'people', 'free', 'think', 'psychotic', 'murderous', 'Tyler', 'Burden', 'FIGHT', 'CLUB', 'Put', 'together', 'one', 'bizarre', 'movie.Personally', 'found', 'SAW', 'be', 'better', 'had', 'expected', 'idea', 'gamemaster', 'who', ""n't"", 'actually', 'kill', 'anyone', 'do', 'what', 'interesting', 'concept', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'again', 'even', 'performance', 'was', 'terrible', 'lot', 'blood', 'guts', 'film', 'though', 'much', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'editing', 'lighting', 'yet', 'are', 'things', 'filmmakers', 'leave', 'up', 'one', 'imagination.Overall', 'even', 'SAW', 'pretty', 'much', 'average', 'horror', 'flick', 'enough', 'sparks', 'originality', 'make', 'one', 'cut', 'rest']",N/A

What was I waiting for?! ""Saw"" is the first of this amazing franchise in horror and it's a goody. It's fresh, smart and keeps you guessing. With a unique storyline complete with twists, surprises, puzzles and intense horror, ""Saw"" is movie that keeps you watching. As the story unfolds, you won't believe how the people are so linked together; having more in common then you can know. And you especially won't believe the ending! It is truly epic. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell did a great job with this film.In a downright disgusting bathroom, Adam (Leigh Whannell), a voyeur photographer, wakes up in a bathtub with his foot chained to a pipe. Across from him, foot also chained to a pipe is Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), a doctor. In the middle of the room lies the body of a man, a gun clutched in one hand and a tape player in the other. Adam and Lawrence each find a tape in their pocket and upon playing them, are met with the creepy recorded voice giving them the staggering situation: Lawrence must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife (Monica Potter) and daughter (Makenzie Vega) will die and Adam will either watch himself die or do something about it. The voice is that of the ""Jigsaw Killer,"" a psychopath who kidnaps people he feels are ungrateful and undeserving of their lives and hurls them into the thralls of bloody, mind-numbing, torturous, life-threatening games of traps, where they must find new appreciation for their lives by facing death. Adam and Lawrence are the newest pawns in Jigsaw's twisted charade, and clues to their ""game"" are around the bathroom.We first learn about Jigsaw through Lawrence's recollections of three other grisly ""games"" that were conducted. There's Paul, the suicidal man who comes face to face with razor wire. There's Mark, a man notorious for faking illness who finds himself covered in a flammable substance and needing a candle to help find a safe combination. Then there's Amanda, the drug addict who wakes up with a reverse bear trap hooked up to her head and jaws. To unlock it, she needs the key from inside the stomach of her dead cellmate. There is also one other Jigsaw trap that happens later on in the movie involving a man named Jeff. Jeff is sitting in a chair, his neck braced in place. A button is stepped on, which activates two drills coming at Jeff; one on each side of his head. According to Jigsaw, he is giving Jeff's life a purpose.But ""Saw"" also focuses around the detectives investigating the Jigsaw murders; detectives Steven Sing (Ken Leung) and detective David Tapp (Danny Glover). We see flashbacks of Tapp and Sing investigating Jigsaw traps, interviewing a possible suspect and talking with a Jigsaw survivor. Both are very committed to the Jigsaw case but Tapp becomes obsessed with it after an unfortunate incident. This obsession will ultimately lead him to someone else who is just as obsessed and desperate, but also dangerous.As the movie progresses, the intensity heightens as time ticks away for Adam and Lawrence. I've seen some reviews saying that the acting is either bad, or just ""okay."" I for one, actually liked the acting, especially from Cary Elwes as the drama builds. I thought he did a great job displaying the intense pain, desperation, anger and feeling of helplessness. I really got into the emotion he brings to the film. And you can feel the psychological madness within him as he prepares to make and conducts some dramatic decisions. Leigh Whannell brings a little levity to the movie as Adam. His sarcastic wit brings some choice phrases to the film amongst the horror. He has a calmness, yet you feel his helplessness as well. Monica Potter and Makenzie Vega aren't bad for acting either as they are held hostage in their home. And then there's Danny Glover, playing a pivotal role as the obsessed former detective. He does a great job with some thrilling scenes in the film.""Saw"" is a great horror movie will leave you questioning things every minute.

Most people that dislike it will say because it's too gruesome and twisted for them. That's understandable, because ""Saw"" is one of the definitive in the infamous but small, ""torture horror"" subgenre. So that explains why people would dislike it, but what about the people that like it?Well I, for one, loved this movie, and here's why: ""Saw"" is not just a movie about people getting thrown in a room and slicing their legs off with giant blades or else their friends will get decapitated. No, ""Saw"" is actually a lot more than just a ""torture"" horror film.If you manage to look past the gruesome violence of this movie, what lies beneath is actually a very intelligent crime film, like a really good episode of ""Law and Order"" or ""NYPD Blue"", just with harsher graphic content.This movie also shows us the villain's ideals. It tries to convince us that Jigsaw, the villain of the movie, is actually not a serial killer and just goes about showing people the value of life in his own, twisted way.A lot of the movie is also a flashback to the police-story behind it, whereas the present in the movie takes places where two guys are chained down and locked into a room, set to a timer.This ""Saw"" is actually a little less graphic than any of its following sequels, save for a gory headshot and sawing through your own ankle. But what this movie lacks in the heavier gore of its sequels, it makes up for in its exciting suspense and smart film-making.Overall, ""Saw"" is one of those movies that you have to give a chance before you decide whether you like it or not. I'm sure glad I gave it a chance, because it showed me that rumors and popular talk can trick you into thinking whether or not a movie is good, or something like that.But anyway, if you want a great horror movie, mixed in with some crime and thriller elements, give this a shot.

They are informed that in order to escape, the person has to saw their foot off to break free from the chain and shoot the other person. That's just the mere begining. The killer doesn't actually directly kill people. He puts them in scenarios where they end up killing themselves (for instance, a fat man has to escape through a barbwired path to escape, but failed due to blood loss from all the lacerations from the wiring).

The result: ""The evil dead"", a funny, sparkling and nasty little horrorflick with some powerhouse inventive camerawork, created mainly out of budget limitations.Just a few years back, young maverick director John Carpenter set new standards in the slasher genre with ""Halloween"", again a low budget film, with some intruiging cinematic techniques to go along. Go back again a few years and you stumble upon ""The Texas Chainsaw massacre"", again made by a young, inexperienced but extremely motivated crew on a shoestring budget, forcing all involved with the filmmaking into a creative kind of minimalism.Now, in the beginning of the new milennium there is again a small little horrorfilm, that oozes as much childlike, playful enthusiasm as it does gallons of blood. I admit, there is more special effects and blood splashes then in its predecessors and a more physical approach to the pain and suffering, but it's done with so much tongue-in-cheeck, that you are more than happy to go along with.The setting in ""Saw"" is in a quircky sort of way not much different then the classics I mentioned above: In ""Halloween"", ""The evil dead"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw massacre"" the protagonists are inside a house and the evil is out there and it is coming to get them. Going back to Roman Polanski's best work: you'll see the same: The frigide girl in ""Repulsion"" fights to keep intruders out of her house, as does the pregnant woman in ""Rosemary's baby"" when she slowly starts to realize that all other appartment inhabitants might not be as innocent as they seem.In ""Saw"" the two main characters find themselves in a filthy, abandonend bathroom like cellar. They are not, however, because they choose so, and this is immediately a different kind of approach. The young men are bound by physical chains and by a whole bunch of mental ones.Cryptic talk by a menacing, unseen maniac force them time and time again to reconcider the whole situation and slowly accept the fact that there is a hidden, underlying connection between the both of them, although from the start it is suggested that the two never met before.To put things even worse, only together they have a chance of getting out of this mess, but their stalker makes it very clear to them early on, that one of them has to die.And from there on, it only gets worse.Paranoia, blood, gutted humor, plot twists, sawed of limbs, buddy-movie-things, and mind bending puzzeling to go along, and all slick but juicyful put together with dazzeling camerawork, fast paced editing and chilly atmosphere, giving us the same feeling as the audience got when they saw the above mentionend grand daddy's in this genre.And, yes, ""Saw"", as fresh and young as it is, may still be a baby now, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if in ten years time, another new scary movie would come along, hinting with much delight at this one, making it an instand ""Another Great Granddaddy Of The Genre""",5,"Another ""Grand daddy"" is born",1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,3253,"['now', 'then', 'horror', 'movie', 'underground', 'made', 'fine', 'bunch', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'share', 'genuin', 'enthusiasm', 'genre', 'general', 'new', 'hot', 'ideas', 'particular.In', 'early', 'eighties', 'young', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'messed', 'around', 'woods', 'friends', 'camera', 'handful', 'nasty', 'demons', 'result', 'evil', 'dead', 'funny', 'sparkling', 'nasty', 'little', 'horrorflick', 'powerhouse', 'inventive', 'camerawork', 'created', 'mainly', 'budget', 'limitations.Just', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'young', 'maverick', 'director', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'set', 'new', 'standards', 'slasher', 'genre', 'Halloween', 'again', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'intruiging', 'cinematic', 'techniques', 'go', 'along', 'Go', 'back', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'stumble', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'massacre', 'again', 'made', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'extremely', 'motivated', 'crew', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'forcing', 'involved', 'filmmaking', 'creative', 'kind', 'minimalism.Now', 'beginning', 'new', 'milennium', 'again', 'small', 'little', 'horrorfilm', 'as', 'much', 'childlike', 'playful', 'enthusiasm', 'gallons', 'blood', 'admit', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'blood', 'splashes', 'then', 'predecessors', 'more', 'physical', 'approach', 'pain', 'suffering', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'tongue-in-cheeck', 'are', 'more', 'happy', 'go', 'along', 'with.The', 'setting', 'Saw', 'quircky', 'sort', 'way', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'then', 'classics', 'mentioned', 'Halloween', 'evil', 'dead', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'massacre', 'protagonists', 'are', 'house', 'evil', 'there', 'coming', 'get', 'Going', 'back', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'best', 'work', ""'ll"", 'see', 'same', 'frigide', 'girl', 'Repulsion', 'fights', 'keep', 'intruders', 'house', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'Rosemary', 'baby', 'when', 'slowly', 'realize', 'other', 'appartment', 'inhabitants', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'innocent', 'seem.In', 'Saw', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'find', 'filthy', 'abandonend', 'bathroom', 'cellar', 'are', 'not', 'however', 'choose', 'so', 'immediately', 'different', 'kind', 'approach', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'bound', 'physical', 'chains', 'whole', 'bunch', 'mental', 'ones.Cryptic', 'talk', 'menacing', 'unseen', 'maniac', 'force', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'reconcider', 'whole', 'situation', 'slowly', 'accept', 'fact', 'hidden', 'underlying', 'connection', 'start', 'suggested', 'two', 'never', 'met', 'before.To', 'put', 'things', 'even', 'worse', 'only', 'together', 'have', 'chance', 'getting', 'mess', 'stalker', 'very', 'clear', 'early', 'one', 'die.And', 'there', 'only', 'worse.Paranoia', 'blood', 'gutted', 'humor', 'plot', 'twists', 'sawed', 'limbs', 'buddy-movie-things', 'mind', 'bending', 'puzzeling', 'go', 'along', 'slick', 'juicyful', 'put', 'together', 'dazzeling', 'camerawork', 'fast', 'paced', 'editing', 'chilly', 'atmosphere', 'giving', 'same', 'feeling', 'audience', 'got', 'when', 'saw', 'above', 'mentionend', 'grand', 'daddy', 'genre.And', 'yes', 'Saw', 'fresh', 'young', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'baby', 'now', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'ten', 'years', 'time', 'new', 'scary', 'movie', 'would', 'come', 'along', 'hinting', 'much', 'delight', 'one', 'making', 'instand', 'Great', 'Granddaddy', 'Genre']",N/A
