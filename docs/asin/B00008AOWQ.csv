737682,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00008AOWQ,Allan M. Lees,"[27, 34]","The BBC's ""Walking With..."" series has been very high quality since its inception.  Great visual effects combined with clarity of exposition and just enough ""story-telling"" to enable most viewers to remain captivated while absorbing decent chunks of information.  This latest addition to the series maintains the general format of its forebears but, perhaps inevitably, is the least successful.It's difficult for humans to have any kind of realistic vision of themselves, so any series that tries to show how we evolved over the millenia (and some of the dead-ends along the way) is going to have problems. In this case there are simply too many gaps and too many leaps across those gaps with only the merest fig leaf of speculation to cover the chasm.  And there are some fairly odd assertions about what aspects of adaptation had which effects.Perhaps the most striking gap is that these episodes miss out on some of the most interesting conclusions we've been able to draw as a result of the last 6 years of genetic analysis.  So this series has an ""old"" feel even though it is recently made.  It also misses a lot of hard knowledge we've had for a long time, perhaps because it was too uncomfortable to include.  For example, the ape-men are shown being monogamous, whereas we know that in all societies at all times known to us, dominant human males have tried to form and keep harems, either explicity or illicitly.  Likewise we know a great deal about the necessity of violence in societies where wealth cannot easily be abstracted, and is thus easily stolen.  Aggression is the only defence - and of course greater aggression is the main tactic for theft.  Neither of these facts appears anywhere in the series, no doubt because we don't like seeing the uncomfortable truth about these aspects of our species.Other than that, the makeup and imitation of pre-human gaits etc. is superb and one or two points are interestingly non-obvious: for example, that the development of enlarged and highly visible whites in our eyes is most probably to enhance signalling, so we can detect subtle emotional states in others.All in all, worth buying but not watching more than once.",3,Somewhat disappointing,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,2178,"['BBC', 'Walking', 'series', 'been', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'inception', 'Great', 'visual', 'effects', 'combined', 'clarity', 'exposition', 'just', 'enough', 'story-telling', 'enable', 'most', 'viewers', 'remain', 'captivated', 'absorbing', 'decent', 'chunks', 'information', 'latest', 'addition', 'series', 'general', 'format', 'forebears', 'perhaps', 'inevitably', 'least', 'successful.It', 'difficult', 'humans', 'have', 'kind', 'realistic', 'vision', 'so', 'series', 'show', 'how', 'evolved', 'millenia', 'dead-ends', 'way', 'going', 'have', 'problems', 'case', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'gaps', 'too', 'many', 'leaps', 'gaps', 'only', 'merest', 'fig', 'leaf', 'speculation', 'cover', 'chasm', 'are', 'fairly', 'odd', 'assertions', 'what', 'aspects', 'adaptation', 'had', 'most', 'striking', 'gap', 'episodes', 'miss', 'out', 'most', 'interesting', 'conclusions', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'draw', 'result', 'last', '6', 'years', 'genetic', 'analysis', 'So', 'series', 'old', 'feel', 'even', 'recently', 'made', 'also', 'lot', 'hard', 'knowledge', ""'ve"", 'had', 'long', 'time', 'perhaps', 'was', 'too', 'uncomfortable', 'include', 'example', 'ape-men', 'are', 'shown', 'being', 'monogamous', 'know', 'societies', 'times', 'known', 'dominant', 'human', 'males', 'have', 'tried', 'form', 'keep', 'harems', 'explicity', 'illicitly', 'Likewise', 'know', 'great', 'deal', 'necessity', 'violence', 'societies', 'where', 'wealth', 'can', 'not', 'easily', 'be', 'abstracted', 'thus', 'easily', 'stolen', 'Aggression', 'only', 'defence', 'course', 'greater', 'aggression', 'main', 'tactic', 'theft', 'facts', 'anywhere', 'series', 'doubt', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'uncomfortable', 'truth', 'aspects', 'species.Other', 'makeup', 'imitation', 'pre-human', 'gaits', 'etc', 'superb', 'one', 'two', 'points', 'are', 'interestingly', 'non-obvious', 'example', 'development', 'enlarged', 'highly', 'visible', 'whites', 'eyes', 'most', 'probably', 'enhance', 'signalling', 'can', 'detect', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'states', 'others.All', 'worth', 'buying', 'not', 'watching', 'more', 'once']",Walking with Cavemen
737683,A2DAAPYZTJ9PZA,B00008AOWQ,C. Moon,"[18, 30]","Over the duration of the 'walking with' series, I've really come to question what validity it has.  I know that there is probably some merit in seeing recreations of what the earth's past may have been like, but all too often the actual educational value seems to get lost amidst the need to tell little stories about the animals in question.  This started with Walking with Dinosaurs and I didn't find it too annoying there, but there were plenty of times it didn't work.  Instead of documentary, it had turned dino-drama.  Now I can really enjoy the concept of a dino-drama, but trying to do that and be educational and do both well is a pretty tall order.  One might also wonder why they felt the need to tell a story with every episode but that becomes clear once you realize how expensive it must have been to make their characters.  It simply wouldn't be economical to show a creature for 30 seconds that you spent a load of money designing the cgi models for, puppets, etc.And now we come to Walking with Cavemen.  For some reason, the creators of the film still feel obligated to stick to prehistoric drama (and by now the novelty has more than worn off), while the quite educational 'making of' disc has been dropped entirely.Looking back on the whole series, one must accept that it's a sort of magic trick, all smoke and mirrors--but innitially, it works.  The problem is, by 'Cavemen' we can cleary see the man behind the curtain and the thing falls flat on its face.  The stories are, to be blunt, stupid.  The best acting in the world can't keep the costumes from looking rediculous, nor make the story convincing.  Ultimately, it's a bunch of people paid to run around in furry suits or naked (as in the later episodes) pretending to be pre-humans.  It worked in Kubrick's 2001, I don't know why it doesn't work here.With all that said, I would have enjoyed a good BBC special on human evolution.  The efforts of the team that made this series, the actors, etc. are very much appreciated, but I feel that while this may hook some of the kids, it does so at a great sacrifice.  Teaching science is ultimately about getting students to open their mind and question the world around them--that means that when we make assertions in a science program like Homo erectus not having a spiritual life, we actually provide some evidence.  Demonstrating the process of inquiry and deduction is more important than the costumes, more important than flashy cgi or creative cut-scenes.  It is the core of what a good education program should be about.  Instead, we have the creative presentation of content.  Just content.  Not science.If you follow that line of reasoning you might come to see why I've given this 2 stars.  This is a talented team working for the leaders in quality science programs.  I think they can do a lot better.",2,The BBC has done better,1063843200,"09 18, 2003",2003,2838,"['duration', ""'walking"", 'series', ""'ve"", 'really', 'come', 'question', 'what', 'validity', 'know', 'probably', 'merit', 'seeing', 'recreations', 'what', 'earth', 'past', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'often', 'actual', 'educational', 'value', 'get', 'lost', 'need', 'tell', 'little', 'stories', 'animals', 'question', 'started', 'Walking', 'Dinosaurs', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'annoying', 'there', 'were', 'plenty', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Instead', 'documentary', 'had', 'turned', 'dino-drama', 'Now', 'can', 'really', 'enjoy', 'concept', 'dino-drama', 'trying', 'do', 'be', 'educational', 'do', 'well', 'pretty', 'tall', 'order', 'One', 'might', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'felt', 'need', 'tell', 'story', 'episode', 'clear', 'realize', 'how', 'expensive', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'characters', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'economical', 'show', 'creature', '30', 'seconds', 'spent', 'load', 'money', 'designing', 'cgi', 'models', 'puppets', 'etc.And', 'now', 'come', 'Walking', 'Cavemen', 'reason', 'creators', 'film', 'still', 'feel', 'obligated', 'stick', 'prehistoric', 'drama', 'now', 'novelty', 'more', 'worn', 'off', 'quite', 'educational', ""'making"", 'disc', 'been', 'dropped', 'entirely.Looking', 'back', 'whole', 'series', 'one', 'must', 'accept', 'sort', 'magic', 'trick', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'innitially', 'problem', ""'Cavemen"", 'can', 'cleary', 'see', 'man', 'curtain', 'thing', 'flat', 'face', 'stories', 'are', 'be', 'blunt', 'stupid', 'best', 'acting', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'costumes', 'looking', 'rediculous', 'make', 'story', 'convincing', 'Ultimately', 'bunch', 'people', 'paid', 'run', 'around', 'furry', 'suits', 'naked', 'later', 'episodes', 'pretending', 'be', 'pre-humans', 'worked', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""n't"", 'work', 'here.With', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'good', 'BBC', 'special', 'human', 'evolution', 'efforts', 'team', 'made', 'series', 'actors', 'etc', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated', 'feel', 'may', 'hook', 'kids', 'so', 'great', 'sacrifice', 'Teaching', 'science', 'ultimately', 'getting', 'students', 'open', 'mind', 'question', 'world', 'when', 'make', 'assertions', 'science', 'program', 'Homo', 'erectus', 'not', 'having', 'spiritual', 'life', 'actually', 'provide', 'evidence', 'Demonstrating', 'process', 'inquiry', 'deduction', 'more', 'important', 'costumes', 'more', 'important', 'flashy', 'cgi', 'creative', 'cut-scenes', 'core', 'what', 'good', 'education', 'program', 'should', 'be', 'about', 'Instead', 'have', 'creative', 'presentation', 'content', 'Just', 'content', 'Not', 'science.If', 'follow', 'line', 'reasoning', 'might', 'come', 'see', 'why', ""'ve"", 'given', '2', 'stars', 'talented', 'team', 'working', 'leaders', 'quality', 'science', 'programs', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'better']",Walking with Cavemen
737684,A3UYVLBDDVZFP0,B00008AOWQ,Daniel A Goldman,"[0, 0]","This review is for &#34;Walking with Cavemen&#34; DVD. I would like to give this four stars for adults, one star for children and teenagers. So I settled on three stars.Is this appropriate for children? No. There are many scenes of full frontal nudity. Just look at the DVD cover. Inside the DVD, all those body parts are not hidden. Of course that is the reality of how our ancestors &#34;dressed&#34;. But it's ridiculous to show this in a high school science class or such. This is purely adult entertainment. So that's a problem with this DVD. It ideally should be suitable for educational purposes. But it's not, at least because of the nudity.Is this scientifically accurate? In many aspects, probably not. The &#34;story lines&#34; are extremely speculative and based on no apparent evidence. I think the producers and writers went way out on a limb with their imaginations. But they didn't have a choice. They couldn't hardly say &#34;we don't know&#34; as a scientist would. this DVD is more about entertainment, less about education.The DVD baldy states that Homo habilis making a stone hand tool was purely instinctual, the same as a bird building a nest. I think the reality is perhaps much more complex. The DVD fails to mention known gene mutations that are strongly suspected to have led to our language abilities. There was no mention of the actual fossils upon which these speculative reconstructions and &#34;story lines&#34; are based.Anything better for speculative stories about early humans? Of course, if you have not seen &#34;Quest for Fire&#34;, immediately dash out and see it! There are probably others.Will you (adult) enjoy this? Perhaps. I liked it, and watched the entire DVD. A lot of it is very entertaining to imagine how our distant ancestors might have lived. On the other hand, you might find a lot of it quite repulsive. A lot of the imagery is very graphic and disturbing. It almost makes one pine for the Garden of Eden, or wish our ancestors were like Raquel Welch in her furry cavewoman bikini. Unfortunately, we are faced with the grim reality of what really happened over millions of years as our ancestors struggled to survive.Is the acting good? For the most part, yes. It was obvious in the scenes with our earliest ancestors that human actors are not great at imitating ape-like movements. According to the &#34;movement director&#34; in the extra interview material, the somewhat artificial-looking movements were intentional. But I much preferred live actors to computer-generated fake-looking images. And I thought the acting was good enough in most of the &#34;story lines&#34;. I just doubted the truth of the story lines.What about the &#34;bonus materials&#34;? I found them pretty weak, mostly interviews with a few of the actors and workers on the project. It could have been a lot better.",3,"Entertaining, largely not scientific, inappropriate for children",1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,2847,"['review', '34', 'Walking', 'Cavemen', '34', 'DVD', 'would', 'like', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'adults', 'one', 'star', 'children', 'teenagers', 'So', 'settled', 'three', 'stars.Is', 'appropriate', 'children', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Just', 'look', 'DVD', 'cover', 'DVD', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'not', 'hidden', 'course', 'reality', 'how', 'ancestors', '34', 'dressed', '34', 'ridiculous', 'show', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'class', 'such', 'purely', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'problem', 'DVD', 'ideally', 'should', 'be', 'suitable', 'educational', 'purposes', 'not', 'least', 'nudity.Is', 'scientifically', 'accurate', 'many', 'aspects', 'probably', 'not', '34', 'story', 'lines', '34', 'are', 'extremely', 'speculative', 'based', 'apparent', 'evidence', 'think', 'producers', 'writers', 'went', 'way', 'out', 'limb', 'imaginations', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'could', ""n't"", 'hardly', 'say', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '34', 'scientist', 'would', 'DVD', 'more', 'entertainment', 'less', 'education.The', 'DVD', 'baldy', 'states', 'Homo', 'habilis', 'making', 'stone', 'hand', 'tool', 'was', 'purely', 'instinctual', 'same', 'bird', 'building', 'nest', 'think', 'reality', 'perhaps', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'DVD', 'mention', 'known', 'gene', 'mutations', 'are', 'strongly', 'suspected', 'have', 'led', 'language', 'abilities', 'was', 'mention', 'actual', 'fossils', 'speculative', 'reconstructions', '34', 'story', 'lines', '34', 'are', 'based.Anything', 'better', 'speculative', 'stories', 'early', 'humans', 'course', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '34', 'Quest', 'Fire', '34', 'immediately', 'out', 'see', 'are', 'probably', 'adult', 'enjoy', 'Perhaps', 'liked', 'watched', 'entire', 'DVD', 'lot', 'very', 'entertaining', 'imagine', 'how', 'distant', 'ancestors', 'might', 'have', 'lived', 'other', 'hand', 'might', 'find', 'lot', 'quite', 'repulsive', 'lot', 'imagery', 'very', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'almost', 'one', 'pine', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'wish', 'ancestors', 'were', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'furry', 'cavewoman', 'bikini', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'faced', 'grim', 'reality', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'millions', 'years', 'ancestors', 'struggled', 'survive.Is', 'acting', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'yes', 'was', 'obvious', 'scenes', 'earliest', 'ancestors', 'human', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'imitating', 'ape-like', 'movements', 'According', '34', 'movement', 'director', '34', 'extra', 'interview', 'material', 'somewhat', 'artificial-looking', 'movements', 'were', 'intentional', 'much', 'preferred', 'live', 'actors', 'computer-generated', 'fake-looking', 'images', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'most', '34', 'story', 'lines', '34', 'just', 'doubted', 'truth', 'story', 'lines.What', '34', 'bonus', 'materials', '34', 'found', 'pretty', 'weak', 'mostly', 'few', 'actors', 'workers', 'project', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better']",Walking with Cavemen

This topic is very difficult to do, especially with animation of human-like animals where we can be more critical than with dinosaurs.  The story lines are a bit tedious but interesting.  Still it is difficult to believe we can reconstruct the behavior of the apes and human predecents based on our current database.  I still think the effort is worthy.  The graphics are very well done, possible not appropriate for a young viewer.  In one scene the ""cavemen"" kill a hooved animal and then degut and eat it.

Or perhaps wonder what your geneological tree looked like in the middle ages?  Ever ponder what your forefathers were doing back in the time of the Greeks &amp; Romans of a few thousand years ago?  Or, back even further, what they were like a few million years ago?Well, it is the latter epoch that is covered by this DVD.  It is an overview of human evolution, 7 million years in the making.  It takes us from the dawn on man all the way up to about 140,000 years go;  long time ago for us, but mere seconds ago on a cosmic timescale.Along the way the documentary displays diverse humanoids, some of whom make it, some of whom don't.  It also demonstrates their interaction with long-extinct species of animals that were around the same time they walked the earth.I must caution that the DVD pulls no punches when it comes to showing the animalistic traits of primitive man.  The rites of courtship, hunting, eating and gutting of animals are all shown with uncompromisingly graphic demonstrations.  I would not recommend this video for young videos, nor would I suggest that anyone watch it while eating.  Some of it is not the most appetizing of images in the world.That said, it is quite remarkable to identify just how much we modern humans have in common with these early products of evolution.  If we look closely, we will see a lot of ourselves in them.The late astronomer Carl Sagan once remarked that, if the history of the universe were shrunk to the scale of a calendar year, all of humanity exists would exist in the last 10 seconds of that year.  This scientific expose is a glimpse into those 10 seconds.  As Stephen J.

This is in the process of being shown on TV at this moment in the UK and all I can say it is better than I expected.  Using real actors and actresses, amazing make-up and special effects, Professor Winston takes us through the lives and times of our remote caveman ancestors, starting with ""Lucy"" who was more ape than human and ending at a pathway that would eventually lead to us, Homo Sapiens.It is a fascinating insight to what might have been.  Of course a lot of what you will see on this DVD is supposition, mixed in with fact, fiction and a healthy dose of imagination.  We will never really know the whole truth of our Caveman ancestors as we only have bones, and cave paintings to rely on but to a certain extent this is enough and Professor Winston does try to give a plausible explanation as to how and why the human race left the trees and evolved into the people we are today.There are four episodes, First Ancestors, Blood Brothers, Savage Family and finally, The Survivors and each half hour includes a ""time-lapse"" so that we can rush through pre-history to the next journey of our evolving ancestors.Professor Winston is a pragmatic narrator who is able to put across a point without being condescending to the watcher, his humour is subtle and his understanding of the human mind is quite staggering.

The effects and makeup are well done and help to create an interesting and believable world where our earliest human relatives lived, hunted, fought, and died.I was very pleased with this series and would highly recommend it and the other ""Walking With..."" films to anyone interested in ancient life and anyone who wants to get a fascinating glimpse of what life might have been like for our ancestors over the course of 3 million years.",5,Excellent Series on the Origins of Mankind,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,939,"['BBC', 'Walking', 'Cavemen', 'fantastic', 'documentary', 'series', 'evolutionary', 'adventure', 'was', 'journey', 'earliest', 'hominid', 'ancestors', 'modern', 'humans', 'today', 'Using', 'latest', 'research', 'fields', 'antropology', 'evolutionary', 'science', 'series', 'highlights', 'several', 'key', 'steps', 'way', 'diminuative', 'ape-like', 'Australopithecus', 'afarensis', 'ultimately', 'Homo', 'Sapiens', 'Sapiens', 'showing', 'various', 'stages', 'physical', 'as', 'well', 'intellectual', 'advancements', 'effects', 'makeup', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'help', 'create', 'interesting', 'believable', 'world', 'where', 'earliest', 'human', 'relatives', 'lived', 'hunted', 'fought', 'died.I', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'series', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'other', 'Walking', 'films', 'anyone', 'interested', 'ancient', 'life', 'anyone', 'who', 'get', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'ancestors', 'course', '3', 'million', 'years']",Walking with Cavemen

Hutchinson ""&#34;I have always imag...","[29, 31]","I've read the negative comments on this installment of the ""Walking With"" series and can only partially agree with them.  The production could have been better, but I think we have become spoiled by watching computer generated animals done extremely well and realistic.  This version contains many human actors and thus the whole ""feel"" of the production is different.Also, not everything produced on Discovery is meant for children.  There are still many, many adults who wish to learn about the past and appreciate a more academic presentation then would occur if a show such as this were aimed at a more younger audience.  I guess it is taken for granted by a lot of the media that once one becomes an adult, all that matters are sports competitions and sitcoms.  This series thus was extremely refreshing to watch.That being said, I came away from watching ""Cavemen"" with a newfound respect for our ancestors.  All too often they have been portrayed as comical dimwits, running around with clubs and dragging women by their hair.  Now I realize this is actually very disrespectful and totally inappropriate. These very ancient ancestors managed to learn to survive some of the worst environmental conditions imaginable, grew more creative over time and with this creativity laid the foundations of modern civilization.  As stated in the series, the discovery of fire not only chased away the denizens of the night, but also provided an opportunity for homo sapiens to learn to create,to reflect, become more emotional creatures and allow for the development of higher brain functions.Neanderthals especially have had to bear the brunt of many a joke.  Although their species did not survive, they can hardly be termed a failure.  They too were resilient, developed the ability to exist during an Ice Age that we, even with all our modern conveniences, would be hard-pressed to endure.  They lost the race in the final stretch, yet their accomplishments are deserving of further study and a more accurate (and respectful) portrayal.It is no longer funny to see some dumpy looking, grunting renditions of distant homo sapiens.  This vision of them is not only misleading, but extremely far from the truth.  ""Walking With Cavemen"" made me realize that because of their temerity, strength and creative thinking, we can today enjoy a world whose origins rest with these long gone, but still amazing, ancient homo sapiens.

Want to know how they all fit together, which derived from which, and which apes went on to become modern men and which died out?  If so, then you should definite watch this documentary.  The story starts in Africa several million years ago and follows the evolution of our pre-historic ancestors as they evolve from apes to men.  The various groups of apes are played by actors, and we watch as they learn to interact (with their environment and each other) in progressively more complex manners, we learn the strengths and weakness of each group, and ultimately why some lived and some died.  I admit that I didn't know much about this subject prior to watching this video, only a few of the buzzwords (Lucy, neanderthal, etc.), but I found this to be both enjoyable and informative.  I was surprised to learn how many of our prehistoric ancestors didn't survive, their lines simply ending.  One thing that was repeatedly stated was that climate change drove many of the physical and cultural changes in the various pre-human apes.  Those who could adapt (and change) survived, those who didn't died, but climate change was the important driver for rapid change (i.e. evolution).  The acting is quite good, as are the costumes.  I think that the production team went to great lengths to differentiate the various types of pre-human apes so that the viewer can fairly easily follow the physical changes.  Bottom line is that this is a great documentary - I only give it four stars because I don't know how many people will want to add it to their permanent collection.
