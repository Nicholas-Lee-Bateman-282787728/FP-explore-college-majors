Now some 60 years later, I see this series as a function of its early-1950s era, with its burgeoning anti-Communism, its leftover jingoism from the war itself, its disdain for our European Allies, and its overt racism.  Thankfully the narration, which often avoids competing with the sheer impact of the visuals, is so transparent and dated that one can read through it to the substantive information it contains.Listen to how the score changes when referring to Japanese and Chinese. Listen to the paternalist words and tone describing our Allies.  Again, it's so obviously manipulative that one can see past it.  At least I could.Several video clips show up in later series (The World at War, Burn's The War, World War II in HD, et al.).  We tend to forget the heavy attention to video provenance these days; this series fails to note obvious reconstructions (both Japanese and US), and it re-uses several clips for effect but not for accuracy.It's easy for me to forgive these faults, so I give it 5 stars for having come when it did.  Others might not feel the same. For anyone wanting historical documentation, this is a must-have.

1578155,A13VWU7YKASALH,B008XJM7T2,Jeff,"[0, 0]","I have been reluctant to buy this series for a long time because of the many bad reviews that I have seen. One review complained about the video company's logo in the corner of the screen that you cannot make go away (no logo in this set). I recently discovered that the copyright on this series has expired. As a result, anybody can make their own dvd version of this series. When I saw how low the price was for this dvd set, I decided to go for it, even if the quality was off. Now that I've watched all the episodes, I consider it one of the best purchases that I've ever made. These are not restored episodes. They look just as scratchy as they did originally on TV. What can you expect, they were filmed under battle conditions. This series was originally supposed to narrated by the actor Robert Montgomery, but after he saw the film condition, he backed out of the project. He was replaced by Leonard Graves, an actor who was an understudy to Yul Brynner in the stage presentation of The King and I. The bonus disc is actually just a long commercial for other war series produced by this company. I found them to be boring and poorly done.  For example, in the Revolutionary War program they talked about slaves fighting in the Revolutionary War and they showed a picture of Frederick Douglass. In another part, they discussed the role of indians in the fighting and showed a clip of some 1930s vintage western movie in what looked like Monument Valley. The background music sometimes overpowered the narration. My advice is watch the bonus disc if you have nothing else to do. If you just want to throw away the bonus disc, the cost of the Victory at Sea series is still an incredible bargain. If you're young enough to have never known anything but high definition digital films, you probably will not like the series.

1578176,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B008XJM7T2,Russell Fanelli,"[15, 16]","Victory at Sea is a great documentary film about World War II as played out on the oceans and seas of the world. First, the war in the Pacific. The vastness of this largest of the world's oceans plays a major role in the unfolding story. The Japanese stretched their limited resources to the breaking point. Pearl Harbor needed to be a ""knockout"" blow to the United States and wasn't. In fact, it was the goad America needed to commit to the war. Once committed, the vast resources of this country were mobilized with astonishing speed and the fighting men and women of the United States were more than equal to the task of defeating what had been an invincible Japanese army and navy.The strength of Victory at Sea is that it shows us the ""up close and personal"" lives of the soldiers and sailors who sailed the ships, flew the planes, and assaulted the beaches of the dozens of South Pacific Islands the Japanese had conquered. The bravery of ""the greatest generation"" is undeniable and Victory at Sea shows us the men and women of America at their courageous best.The war in the Atlantic was dominated, at first, by the skilled German U-Boat submariners. For those who want to see what the war looked like from the German point of view, I highly recommend the great German film, Das Boot. Without the backing of the American fleet, England may well have lost the war, so effective were the Germans at destroying allied shipping.Dunkirk should have been a German victory which seriously damaged England's ability to continue fighting effectively. Instead, the English put every boat that could sail into the water to rescue their fighting men stranded across the English Channel. With this unexpected miracle and the incredible valor of the English airforce in the Battle of Britain, England bought time as America entered the war.Everything about this lengthy program is outstanding. Every bit of appropriate film has been reviewed and the most compelling sequences have been carefully spliced together to tell the story of Victory at Sea. Richard Rodgers' score is wonderful from beginning to end and always appropriately matched to the pictures we are watching. The narration makes clear the strategy and battle plans as the war is fought from the great naval victory at Midway in the Pacific to the spectacular landing at Normandy on the coast of France.  First time viewers have a real treat in store for them.",5,The greatest generation wins the victory at sea.,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,2417,"['Victory', 'Sea', 'great', 'documentary', 'film', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'played', 'out', 'oceans', 'seas', 'world', 'First', 'war', 'Pacific', 'vastness', 'largest', 'world', 'oceans', 'major', 'role', 'unfolding', 'story', 'Japanese', 'stretched', 'limited', 'resources', 'breaking', 'point', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'needed', 'be', 'knockout', 'blow', 'United', 'States', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'was', 'goad', 'America', 'needed', 'commit', 'war', 'Once', 'committed', 'vast', 'resources', 'country', 'were', 'mobilized', 'astonishing', 'speed', 'fighting', 'men', 'women', 'United', 'States', 'were', 'more', 'equal', 'task', 'defeating', 'had', 'been', 'invincible', 'Japanese', 'army', 'navy.The', 'strength', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'lives', 'soldiers', 'sailors', 'who', 'sailed', 'ships', 'flew', 'planes', 'assaulted', 'beaches', 'dozens', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Japanese', 'had', 'conquered', 'bravery', 'greatest', 'generation', 'undeniable', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'men', 'women', 'America', 'courageous', 'best.The', 'war', 'Atlantic', 'was', 'dominated', 'first', 'skilled', 'German', 'U-Boat', 'submariners', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'war', 'looked', 'German', 'point', 'view', 'highly', 'recommend', 'great', 'German', 'film', 'Das', 'Boot', 'backing', 'American', 'fleet', 'England', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'lost', 'war', 'so', 'effective', 'were', 'Germans', 'destroying', 'allied', 'shipping.Dunkirk', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'German', 'victory', 'seriously', 'damaged', 'England', 'ability', 'continue', 'fighting', 'effectively', 'Instead', 'English', 'put', 'boat', 'could', 'sail', 'water', 'rescue', 'fighting', 'men', 'stranded', 'English', 'Channel', 'unexpected', 'miracle', 'incredible', 'valor', 'English', 'airforce', 'Battle', 'Britain', 'England', 'bought', 'time', 'America', 'entered', 'war.Everything', 'lengthy', 'program', 'outstanding', 'bit', 'appropriate', 'film', 'been', 'reviewed', 'most', 'compelling', 'sequences', 'have', 'been', 'carefully', 'spliced', 'together', 'tell', 'story', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'score', 'wonderful', 'beginning', 'end', 'always', 'appropriately', 'matched', 'pictures', 'are', 'watching', 'narration', 'clear', 'strategy', 'battle', 'plans', 'war', 'fought', 'great', 'naval', 'victory', 'Midway', 'Pacific', 'spectacular', 'landing', 'Normandy', 'coast', 'France', 'First', 'time', 'viewers', 'have', 'real', 'treat', 'store']",N/A

I had expected that the series would not age well. The temptation for jingoism or for too much dramatic effect struck me as likely. But I continue to enjoy this classic series. The focus of the series: the war at sea.First, there is the sound track. The music was written by Richard Rodgers. There are some wonderful themes during the course of the 26 episode series. The series' theme song alone is a classic. Robert Russell Bennett arranged the music and conducted the then top notch NBC Symphony Orchestra (Arturo Toscanini's orchestra).Second, the use of war footage gives the series a genuineness and gravitas. The videos add greatly to the total effect. Leonard Graves is the narrator, and has a voice that works well in that role.There are 26 episodes, taking us from the war's outbreak (including Dunkirk, German U-boats, Pearl Harbor, etc.), to Midway to Gaudalcanal to D-Day to the Great Mariana's Turkey Shoot to the Philippines to Iwo Jima to Okinawa. . . . The war in the east and in the west are covered.Sometimes there is a bit of jingoism or overwrought descriptions of German and Japanese actions (there were despicable acts, indeed, but sometimes the script goes over the edge). However, this is not excessive and does not really detract from the series.This is still aging well as a concept and product.There are also extras: discussion of the Revolutionary War up to Iraq II. I watched the Civil War extra and turned it off (never to return) when they showed a picture of General Winfield Scott Hancock while speaking of General Winfield Scott's role as the top military commander for the Union. Before that, footage from old Civil War movies was used, some being not worth inclusion. If I heard correctly, the film got General P. G. T. Beauregard's initials wrong, too. Perhaps the other extras were much better.At any rate, an estimable series, still worth watching.",5,Victory at Sea still works well,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,2011,"['What', 'series', 'When', 'was', 'kid', 'watched', 'television', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'acquired', 'VHS', 'version', 'Now', 'DVD', 'had', 'expected', 'series', 'would', 'not', 'age', 'well', 'temptation', 'jingoism', 'too', 'much', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'struck', 'likely', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'series', 'focus', 'series', 'war', 'sea.First', 'sound', 'track', 'music', 'was', 'written', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'are', 'wonderful', 'themes', 'course', '26', 'episode', 'series', 'series', 'theme', 'song', 'alone', 'classic', 'Robert', 'Russell', 'Bennett', 'arranged', 'music', 'conducted', 'then', 'top', 'notch', 'NBC', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'Arturo', 'Toscanini', 'orchestra', '.Second', 'use', 'war', 'footage', 'series', 'genuineness', 'gravitas', 'videos', 'add', 'greatly', 'total', 'effect', 'Leonard', 'Graves', 'narrator', 'voice', 'well', 'are', '26', 'episodes', 'taking', 'war', 'outbreak', 'including', 'Dunkirk', 'German', 'U-boats', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'etc', 'Midway', 'Gaudalcanal', 'D-Day', 'Great', 'Mariana', 'Turkey', 'Shoot', 'Philippines', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Okinawa', 'war', 'east', 'west', 'are', 'covered.Sometimes', 'bit', 'jingoism', 'overwrought', 'descriptions', 'German', 'Japanese', 'actions', 'were', 'despicable', 'acts', 'indeed', 'sometimes', 'script', 'edge', 'However', 'not', 'excessive', 'not', 'really', 'detract', 'series.This', 'still', 'aging', 'well', 'concept', 'product.There', 'are', 'also', 'extras', 'discussion', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'up', 'Iraq', 'II', 'watched', 'Civil', 'War', 'extra', 'turned', 'off', 'never', 'return', 'when', 'showed', 'picture', 'General', 'Winfield', 'Scott', 'Hancock', 'speaking', 'General', 'Winfield', 'Scott', 'role', 'top', 'military', 'commander', 'Union', 'footage', 'old', 'Civil', 'War', 'movies', 'was', 'used', 'being', 'not', 'worth', 'inclusion', 'heard', 'correctly', 'film', 'got', 'General', 'P.', 'G.', 'T.', 'Beauregard', 'initials', 'wrong', 'too', 'Perhaps', 'other', 'extras', 'were', 'much', 'rate', 'estimable', 'series', 'still', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
