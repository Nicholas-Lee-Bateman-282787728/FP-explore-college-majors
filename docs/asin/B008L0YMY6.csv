Unfortunately, these great shots seem to get recycled over and over again. While the music is nice, the narration is stilted and dull at times. There is some historical information presented, but as others have mentioned, we need to see more of the park than a ranger turning over logs. There is almost no information on the beautiful byway, just a few shots of cars lined up. The most interesting part to me was the author featured who showed some of the nice views from differing hikes. While filmed in high definition, this comes out as rather amateurish. PBS, History and Discovery do this far better. There is a reason the price is so low, so is the content quality.
