1696799,A1GY4VWXY0747S,B00JLDT9OA,FredCritic,"[6, 7]","I loved this crazy movie. Woody Allen plays Murray, a 70-something used book store owner, whose business isn't bringing in the bucks like it used to.Allen needs another source of income and decides to become a pimp. So he recruits John Tuturro's character, Fioravante, as a gigolo, to charge women for sex (Tuturro is the sole member of Allen's stable).Tuturro plays a 50-something part-time flower shop worker who is also in need of some extra money. It was not easy for the Woody Allen character to sell Tuturro on the idea of becoming a gigolo, and you can understand his hesitation. Tuturro sort of looks like what you would think Eddie Haskell, of Leave It To Beaver, would look like in his 50's. Tuturro tells the Woody Allen character that he is not a beautiful man. Allen counters that neither is Mick Jagger, but look at all the women he gets. Tuturro counters that Mick Jagger is a millionaire celebrity rock star and that women don't pay him for sex.As the story progresses, we find out that the Woody Allen character lives in the same apartment with a black woman in her 40's and her three kind of nerdish young sons (they where thick glasses and checkered shirts and thin neckties). The kids seem to adore Murray, and they call him Poppa Mo (?!?!). The mother seems to get on quite well with Murray and is very protective of him. What exactly is going on in this arrangement is never explained in the movie, which makes it that much more intriguing and, somehow or another, that much more comical.At any rate, after an exceedingly funny scene where Allen and Tuturro decide what their pimp and gigolo cover names are going to be, they go to work. In another laugh riot of a scene, Allen is on the phone hustling up work for Tuturro. He manages to set up a ""date"" for Tuturro with his dermatologist, played by Sharon Stone (who looks better than ever in her mid-50's).Allen sets Tuturro's price at $1000 per trick, and Allen and Tuturro split the money 40/60. With Tuturro receiving 60 percent. How generous of the Allen character.After they start taking in some decent money, Allen decides to splurge a bit. In yet another funny-as-hell scene, Allen purchases a brand new couch to impress the black woman he lives with. Show her how he's coming up in the world. When the couch is delivered to their apartment, she can't help noticing how strange the couch is designed, with swirly q's and exclamation marks and pound signs. Allen notices her reaction and attempts to defend his choice by claiming that ""he was on acid"" when he purchased the couch.The movie continues on detailing Tuturro's sex-for-money encounters with women, until the movie slows down a bit when Tuturro is hired by an orthodox jewish woman to provide her with company.The woman has been widowed for a couple of years and is terribly lonely. She is as conservative as anyone could be; and somehow Tuturro's character, whom we know little about, identifies with her. They wind up opening one another up, and we can't help noticing the gigolo fade.I don't want to get into this film any more than I already have. But let me tell you about one more thing that I very much enjoyed about this film: It is beautiful to look at. It kind of looks like a typical Woody Allen film - bathed in warm tones, i.e., yellows, reds, and browns. Somehow or another that lighting strategy seems to help make the characters that much more human and vulnerable.In closing, let me say that this is a strange movie, indeed. It is essentially a comedy; but in addition, there are plenty of dramatic scenes that are very well written and performed and directed.I hesitated to give this five stars only because I felt that the relationship between Tuturro and the jewish woman could have been explored in more depth. That was my only qualm with the movie. Otherwise, a terrific movie from beginning to end.",4,This is a terrific crazy funny movie...,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,3862,"['loved', 'crazy', 'movie', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Murray', '70-something', 'used', 'book', 'store', 'owner', 'business', ""n't"", 'bringing', 'bucks', 'used', 'to.Allen', 'source', 'income', 'become', 'pimp', 'John', 'Tuturro', 'character', 'Fioravante', 'gigolo', 'charge', 'women', 'sex', 'Tuturro', 'sole', 'member', 'Allen', 'stable', '.Tuturro', '50-something', 'part-time', 'flower', 'shop', 'worker', 'who', 'also', 'need', 'extra', 'money', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'sell', 'Tuturro', 'idea', 'becoming', 'gigolo', 'can', 'understand', 'hesitation', 'Tuturro', 'sort', 'looks', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'Eddie', 'Haskell', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'would', 'look', '50', 'Tuturro', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'not', 'beautiful', 'man', 'Allen', 'counters', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'look', 'women', 'Tuturro', 'counters', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'millionaire', 'celebrity', 'rock', 'star', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'sex.As', 'story', 'find', 'out', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'lives', 'same', 'apartment', 'black', 'woman', '40', 'three', 'kind', 'nerdish', 'young', 'sons', 'where', 'thick', 'glasses', 'checkered', 'shirts', 'thin', 'neckties', 'kids', 'seem', 'adore', 'Murray', 'call', 'Poppa', 'Mo', 'mother', 'get', 'quite', 'well', 'Murray', 'very', 'protective', 'What', 'exactly', 'going', 'arrangement', 'never', 'explained', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'intriguing', 'somehow', 'much', 'more', 'comical.At', 'rate', 'exceedingly', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Allen', 'Tuturro', 'decide', 'what', 'pimp', 'gigolo', 'cover', 'names', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'go', 'work', 'laugh', 'riot', 'scene', 'Allen', 'phone', 'hustling', 'up', 'work', 'Tuturro', 'set', 'up', 'date', 'Tuturro', 'dermatologist', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'better', 'ever', 'mid-50', '.Allen', 'Tuturro', 'price', '1000', 'trick', 'Allen', 'Tuturro', 'split', 'money', '40/60', 'Tuturro', 'receiving', '60', 'percent', 'How', 'generous', 'Allen', 'character.After', 'start', 'taking', 'decent', 'money', 'Allen', 'splurge', 'bit', 'yet', 'funny-as-hell', 'scene', 'Allen', 'purchases', 'brand', 'new', 'couch', 'impress', 'black', 'woman', 'Show', 'how', 'coming', 'up', 'world', 'When', 'couch', 'delivered', 'apartment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'noticing', 'how', 'strange', 'couch', 'designed', 'swirly', 'q', 'exclamation', 'marks', 'pound', 'signs', 'Allen', 'reaction', 'attempts', 'defend', 'choice', 'claiming', 'was', 'acid', 'when', 'purchased', 'couch.The', 'movie', 'detailing', 'Tuturro', 'sex-for-money', 'encounters', 'women', 'movie', 'down', 'bit', 'when', 'Tuturro', 'hired', 'orthodox', 'jewish', 'woman', 'provide', 'company.The', 'woman', 'been', 'widowed', 'couple', 'years', 'terribly', 'lonely', 'as', 'conservative', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'somehow', 'Tuturro', 'character', 'whom', 'know', 'little', 'identifies', 'wind', 'up', 'opening', 'one', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'noticing', 'gigolo', 'fade.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'film', 'more', 'already', 'have', 'let', 'tell', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'kind', 'looks', 'typical', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'bathed', 'warm', 'tones', 'i.e.', 'yellows', 'reds', 'browns', 'Somehow', 'lighting', 'strategy', 'help', 'make', 'characters', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'vulnerable.In', 'closing', 'let', 'say', 'strange', 'movie', 'indeed', 'essentially', 'comedy', 'addition', 'are', 'plenty', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'performed', 'directed.I', 'hesitated', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'only', 'felt', 'relationship', 'Tuturro', 'jewish', 'woman', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'more', 'depth', 'was', 'only', 'qualm', 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'terrific', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A

Daniel Spratlin,"[1, 1]","What&#8217;s it about?A guy that gets talked into becoming a professional male escort by his cash-strapped friend.What did I think?The plot sounded dubious and the inclusion of Woody Allen left me extra concerned but I walked out of Fading Gigolo pleasantly surprised. It&#8217;s a light but intelligent comedy that I actually found delightfully charming.John Turturro (Transformers) wrote, directed and stars in a pic whose star power reflects the strength of a quirky but interesting script. Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara play almost predatory females who are looking for attention and a selfish satisfaction that makes their interactions with Virgil fascinating. Not only what they want from him, but also the way they treat him. And then we meet a quiet widow who I think we all fall in love with a bit including our hero. But can he have her? Especially given her devotion to the Jewish faith.One of the criticisms of this film is that Turturro is not an attractive man, especially odd given the profession he&#8217;s supposed to portray but I think that actually adds to this film. It&#8217;s about his quiet confidence and his attentiveness to the women&#8217;s needs, rather than a cheeky smile and six packs. He&#8217;s an unlikely but likable hero.Warm-fuzzy feelings and no, not THOSE kind &#8211; there&#8217;s actually very little in the way of nudity and sex scenes.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[5, 6]","When I went to see this movie I admit I had little expectation of it, with the subject matter of a middle aged fellow played by John Turturro randomly becoming a gigolo at the prompting of his older friend played by Woody Allen.I assumed incorrectly that it was a Woody Allen written and directed movie,  an understandable mistake if you see the movie, though it was both written and directed by John Turturro.What you may discover as you watch is a marvellous exposition of this story, with Sharon Stone, reminding us of how sexy she can be, and Sofia Vergara showing us how sexy she is, in flattering but not overly revealing lingerie.  Oh well.The story stems from a random conversation between Woody and a female friend who wants to be in a menage a trois, and you can imagine how it develops from there, but probably not how it actually develops in the movie. What impressed me was the subtlety of the piece, how well it was written, the understated performance of Turturro, who goes with the flow in every situation, it eschews comedy though it has its moments going for the more tender story at the heart.Fading gigolo takes on another dimension when Murray (Woody) persuades a grieving Rabbi's widow married into a particularly repressive sect, to get a massage from our lothario, which provides the pivotal moment in the movie, and a woman almost literallyfrozen by her grief begins to.......and this introduces the central performance of the movie by French actress Vanessa Paradis who brings a certain French chicness to the role, accompanied by a soundtrack reminiscent of those French movies from the sixties.  Really she steals the movie from everyone except Turturro with a simply brilliant and also subtle performance.  Far more is conveyed by fleeting facial expression and the character she plays, than any words that are actually uttered.Liev Shreiber plays a nosy neighborhood patrolman with a little too much interest in Murray's enterprises.If it was not for the fact that it says written and directed by John Turturro in the credits, I would have assumed it is a Woody Allen movie, as it has all the hallmarks of the types of movies Allen made years ago, with him playing a central character, so I found it to be a remarkable homage to the actor, writer, director by someone doing exactly the same.  Kudos for style, excellence, character, and story.If you like Woody Allen movies you will certainly this Turturro one about a fading gigolo.

As the movie opens, we see how Murray is having to close his venerable New York bookstore due to the changing times and shopping habits. Murray needs to find a way to make money, and when his dermatologist (played by Sharen Stone) confesses that she and her girl friend would like to try a threesome, Murray suggests Floravante. It's not long before Floravante's reputation as a ladies' man spreads. In a parallel storyline, Floravante makes the acquaintance of Avigal (played by Vanessa Pardis), a widow with six kids who is desperately lonely in her Orthodox Jewish community. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the writing/directing debut from well respected actor John Torturro. The idea for the story is not bad, but neither does it flow effortlessly. Is this movie a comedy? or something more serious? or both? Second, I don't remember when was the last time that Woody Allen acted in a movie he neither wrote or directed, but it surely has been decades. Here, Woody gets to play himself--albeit from 30 years ago, and the truth is that what once was super-funny, now comes across slightly irritating if not worse. Third, the movie for me was stolen by French actress Vanessa Paradis, who brings an outstanding performance as the widow suffocating under the strict rules of Orthodox Jews. Paradis is a mega-star in Europe and it's a shame we don't get to see her more often in American films (or on American theatre screens). Fourth, this is a New York movie all the way, and the set locations are in and of themselves a character in the movie, in particular Williamsburg in Brooklyn gets the spotlight. Last but certainly not least there is a delightful jazzy-sounding soundtrack to the movie, which is definitely worth checking out.In all, &#34;Fading Gigolo&#34; certainly isn't bad, but neither is it the &#34;special&#34; movie which Turturro surely had in mind when he was making this. I saw the movie last weekend at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington, DC and the late matinee screening I saw this at was nicely attended, without being close to a sell-out. If you lower your expectations for &#34;Fading Gigolo&#34;, you might even be surprised in a good way.
