792943,A1B5ERBAC41VMT,B00014K5MS,Alice Caldwell,"[4, 5]","This is a good movie. I have watched it over and over again.  There is a very strong message in it.  This girl was in a relationship with this guy for about a year; she cared very deeply for him but he didn't feel the same.  At his birthday party, that she prepared for him, she found out that he only thought of himself as far as the future which was not with her. I don't want to tell the movie but for me, it was an excellent movie with a very strong storyline especially for young ladies who put their lives on hold waiting for someone who does not have them on the mind for a future in marriage.  You are important, don't allow yourselves to be used by someone who does not think of you as a ""wife"".  This guy was on the rebound from his previous girlfriend who decided not to marry him.  So, while getting into a relationship with Nikki, he still had feelings for the other girl and was waiting to see if she would take him back.  You really need to see this movie.

When you are looking for something like that in the African American arena that can be difficult.  Yet, when I viewed this movie I found myself liking it, but at the same time wishing that the director and the actors had put more into it.  If there were more normal African American romances without the Jason's Lyric kind of mentality this movie would probably not been that good to me.  It is a simple love story kind of movie, and I would definately not pay more than about $7 for it.

This seemingly low keyed love story has a cast that will knock your socks off.  Get ready for this...Renee' Goldsberry (The Jackson's:  An American Dream), Terron Brooks (played Eddie Kendricks in The Temptations), Tico Wells (The Five Heartbeats), Chris Spencer (he has been all over the place), Rockmond Dunbar (Soul Food Series on Showtime), LisaRaye (The Players Club), Debbie Allen (from Houston and has done it all...acting/directing/choreography), Lou Myers (Different World) and Vanessa Bell Calloway (BET, Coming to America) bring this story to life.  The characters are unforgettable.Nicole has a lightbulb moment in her relationship with Robbie.  She realizes that his long term plans do not include her.  She runs off to sort things out and wait for him to chase after her.  Her roommate (LisaRaye) sublets her apartment to Brian (who is the adopted brother of Robbie and has been estranged from his family for several years).  Nicole and Brian both have personal issues to deal with.  In the midst of dealing with their own issues, they find love unexpectedly.  Both of them are working at a club called Toomie's which adds flavor, some really nice music and a few laughs to the movie.This is a cute, charming, heart warming, feel good kind of movie.

I agree with the reviewer who says that this romantic drama was just OK. I really didn't get a sense of chemistry between the main characters. Yet I do think the supporting cast did a very good job.  Rockmond Dunbar(Kenny, Soul Food) was very convincing as an egotistical, brazen star football player.  It was also good to see Tico Wells (Choirboy, Five Heartbeats)in a small role along with an array of other talented black actors that we know and love.One thing I think was great was the music.

This was such a sweet love story Nicole is in love with Robbie who is planning on a future without her.  She is distraught, and moves to another city to get a fresh start.  Her roommate Lisa informs her that she had to sublet the apartment, and her new roommate will be her ex's brother.  Nicole is not pleased, and begs her to tell Brian that he can't have the apartment.  Brian does not get the message, and he shows up at the apartment.  She tries to avoid him, but eventually she warms up to him.  There is an attraction, but she is really scared about allowing herself to be so vulnerable, but she can't deny the attraction.  They both have issues to resolve.  Her issue is dealing with her ex who is pursuing her now that she has left.  Her other issue is realizing that someone her ex told her was only a college friend is actually his ex fianc&eacute;.  The movie has a GREAT cast.  The chemistry between Nicole and Brian was really great!!  Rockmond Dunbar has a part in this movie, but his part in the movie did not totally make sense to me.
