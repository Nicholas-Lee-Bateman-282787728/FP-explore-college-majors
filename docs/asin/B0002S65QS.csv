844429,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0002S65QS,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 3]","Here we are in Berlin, when a meteor unexpectedly crashes into Europe, causing a global ice age and chaos.  Our protagonist is Tom Parker (Dean Cain), who was responsible for security at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.  Tom manages to get all sorts of key personnel onto the last plane leaving Berlin, but he inexplicably asks his wife and daughter to wait next to a wall while he gets onto the plane, whereupon some senior military person says, too bad, and smacks Tom around a little to prove his point.A few years pass by and it appears that someone has left a light on in Berlin, so the government decides they need to check it out.  Unfortunately, a super secret American satellite that someone set up to control only from Berlin destroys the plane carrying the team going to check out the activity in Berlin.  Obviously there is more than just a light on in Berlin, there is some insidious activity.  Further, the satellite is now positioned to take out the new government, and governments tend to get annoyed by things like that.  So, a second expedition is put together to stop the satellite before it can be recharged.  Of course Tom Parker is going with the expedition to see if his wife and child survived the cold and are waiting for him.The expedition gets to Berlin and gets two really cool snow tanks.  Of course there is the usual stupidity (every B science fiction movie has to have some stupidity of the plot stalls out) and one tank is lost right away.  Soon the second tank is lost when it is attacked and the budget costs for the obviously animated tanks goes down.It turns out that there are more than just a few people left in Berlin, and while their life is difficult, they seem to be doing reasonably well.  Of course, there are those who have decided that they are going to destroy some portions of the world to get revenge on those who abandoned them.  Then there is the person on the team who wants to destroy a different target altogether.  The plot gets convoluted in an attempt to distract you from its increasing implausibility.This movie is somewhat complicated, and suffers from the complexity.  There is the plot device (the meteor), but on top of the plot device are at least four other plots.  Unfortunately this movie does not have time to fully exploit all the various plots, so one plot I never so coming, and I thought to myself that throwing another, completely unrelated, plot into the mix was a bit bizarre.  I said, ""Huh?"" and shook my head.The good point of this movie was the snow tanks, though the animation was weak.  After that, this movie is essentially a low budget disaster film, rehashing the ""meteor hits the Earth"" theme once more, but not doing it nearly as well as other movies where the meteor hits or nearly misses (for example, ""Deep Impact"" or ""Armageddon"").  I suppose if you collect movies about global disasters, you should probably have this one in your collection, but be sure to set your expectations low.",2,How Many Movies Can You Make About a Meteor Hitting Earth?,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,2969,"['Here', 'are', 'Berlin', 'when', 'meteor', 'unexpectedly', 'Europe', 'causing', 'global', 'ice', 'age', 'chaos', 'protagonist', 'Tom', 'Parker', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'security', 'U.S.', 'Embassy', 'Berlin', 'Tom', 'get', 'sorts', 'key', 'personnel', 'last', 'plane', 'leaving', 'Berlin', 'inexplicably', 'wife', 'daughter', 'wait', 'next', 'wall', 'plane', 'whereupon', 'senior', 'military', 'person', 'too', 'bad', 'smacks', 'Tom', 'little', 'prove', 'point.A', 'few', 'years', 'pass', 'someone', 'left', 'light', 'Berlin', 'government', 'need', 'check', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'super', 'secret', 'American', 'satellite', 'someone', 'set', 'up', 'control', 'only', 'Berlin', 'plane', 'carrying', 'team', 'going', 'check', 'out', 'activity', 'Berlin', 'Obviously', 'more', 'just', 'light', 'Berlin', 'insidious', 'activity', 'satellite', 'now', 'positioned', 'take', 'out', 'new', 'government', 'governments', 'tend', 'get', 'annoyed', 'things', 'So', 'second', 'expedition', 'put', 'together', 'stop', 'satellite', 'can', 'be', 'recharged', 'course', 'Tom', 'Parker', 'going', 'expedition', 'see', 'wife', 'child', 'survived', 'cold', 'are', 'waiting', 'him.The', 'expedition', 'Berlin', 'two', 'really', 'cool', 'snow', 'tanks', 'course', 'usual', 'stupidity', 'B', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'have', 'stupidity', 'plot', 'out', 'one', 'tank', 'lost', 'right', 'away', 'second', 'tank', 'lost', 'when', 'attacked', 'budget', 'costs', 'obviously', 'animated', 'tanks', 'down.It', 'out', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'few', 'people', 'left', 'Berlin', 'life', 'difficult', 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'reasonably', 'well', 'course', 'are', 'who', 'have', 'decided', 'are', 'going', 'destroy', 'portions', 'world', 'get', 'revenge', 'who', 'abandoned', 'Then', 'person', 'team', 'who', 'destroy', 'different', 'target', 'altogether', 'plot', 'convoluted', 'attempt', 'distract', 'increasing', 'implausibility.This', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'complicated', 'suffers', 'complexity', 'plot', 'device', 'meteor', 'top', 'plot', 'device', 'are', 'least', 'four', 'other', 'plots', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'fully', 'exploit', 'various', 'plots', 'one', 'plot', 'never', 'so', 'coming', 'thought', 'myself', 'throwing', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'plot', 'mix', 'was', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'said', 'Huh', 'shook', 'head.The', 'good', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'snow', 'tanks', 'animation', 'was', 'weak', 'movie', 'essentially', 'low', 'budget', 'disaster', 'film', 'rehashing', 'meteor', 'Earth', 'theme', 'once', 'more', 'not', 'doing', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'movies', 'where', 'meteor', 'nearly', 'misses', 'example', 'Deep', 'Impact', 'Armageddon', 'suppose', 'collect', 'movies', 'global', 'disasters', 'should', 'probably', 'have', 'one', 'collection', 'be', 'sure', 'set', 'expectations', 'low']",Post Impact

So naturally, this movie was a ""Must-See"" for me.This movie was part of the Sci-Fi channel's original movie line-up and was financed by a German film company (hence most of the story revolves around a post-disaster Berlin). Not a negative, but definitely a cautionary sign, as Sci-Fi Pictures offerings seem to generally be more attempts to fill 2 hours of airtime than to offer high-quality original fare.Now technically, the movie has its short-comings (e.g. many of the special effects are so obviously animation that it jars you out of the moment - the visuals of a frozen Europe and a cold-climated North Africa are merely adequate) but this is not a fatal weakness.Acting is generally less than adequate. Dean Cain is almost decent in his leading role, but Nigel Bennett is a sad disappointment and Joanna Clark is totally out of her element (nice eye-candy, tho!)But to be fair to the actors, they had a very little with which to work. Some of the lines the actors must deliver are so over-the-top and cornball, that unintentional comedy ensues. The plot was paper-thin and soon developed more holes than a New York street after a snowstorm. The set-up is ok although logic is not it's strong suit (i.e. the justification for Dean Cain's characters involvement) but forgivable. However, the final 1/2 hour or so of the movie was so incredibly stupid, the motivation of the various antagonist so vague and well, cartoonish, that any postives of the first half of the movie are duly squandered.A movie to watch if you're stuck indoors during a blizzard, but not a keeper...",2,Watch Only In The Event of Being Snow-bound...,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,1708,"['love', 'End-of-The-World', 'disaster', 'movies', 'especially', 'ones', 'where', 'new', 'Ice', 'Age', 'Earth', 'Psychoanalysts', 'have', 'So', 'naturally', 'movie', 'was', 'Must-See', 'me.This', 'movie', 'was', 'part', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'original', 'movie', 'line-up', 'was', 'financed', 'German', 'film', 'company', 'hence', 'most', 'story', 'around', 'post-disaster', 'Berlin', 'Not', 'negative', 'definitely', 'cautionary', 'sign', 'Sci-Fi', 'Pictures', 'offerings', 'seem', 'generally', 'be', 'more', 'attempts', 'fill', '2', 'hours', 'airtime', 'offer', 'high-quality', 'original', 'fare.Now', 'technically', 'movie', 'short-comings', 'e.g', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'obviously', 'animation', 'moment', 'visuals', 'frozen', 'Europe', 'cold-climated', 'North', 'Africa', 'are', 'merely', 'adequate', 'not', 'fatal', 'weakness.Acting', 'generally', 'less', 'adequate', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'almost', 'decent', 'leading', 'role', 'Nigel', 'Bennett', 'sad', 'disappointment', 'Joanna', 'Clark', 'totally', 'element', 'nice', 'eye-candy', 'tho', 'be', 'fair', 'actors', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'lines', 'actors', 'must', 'deliver', 'are', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'cornball', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'ensues', 'plot', 'was', 'paper-thin', 'soon', 'developed', 'more', 'holes', 'New', 'York', 'street', 'snowstorm', 'set-up', 'ok', 'logic', 'not', 'strong', 'suit', 'i.e', 'justification', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'characters', 'involvement', 'forgivable', 'However', 'final', '1/2', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'motivation', 'various', 'antagonist', 'vague', 'well', 'cartoonish', 'postives', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'are', 'duly', 'squandered.A', 'movie', 'watch', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'indoors', 'blizzard', 'not', 'keeper']",Post Impact
