1033944,A2WFQNVRCE3KTL,B000KGGZW6,Nobody,"[2, 5]","If by some miracle you actually clicked on this without already knowing everything about it, well . . . what can I say that would do justice to this stupid thing?  It's a Doris Wishman film, so nothing needs to be said about the quality of the film, the dumb ""plot"" and so forth.  All you really need to know about are the bits where Chesty Morgan takes her clothes off and shows off her monstrous hangers.  I remember reading an interview once where she noted that not everyone went to see her act (depicted here) for her hooters, that she had nice legs as well.  Uh huh.So anyway, the first film is the best, there are more good parts, particularly a long bathroom and bathing scene, and the aforementioned footage of her stage act which is pretty good in a fleshy sort of way, if you're into that, and I am.  The second flick has fewer scenes, but it at least contains the comedic relief of her being a spy with a camera in one of her breasts.  No kidding.But if you're into busty women you already have the four minute clip of the good parts assembled from these films, so why would you want the whole useless thing?  If for some reason you're new to this, is it worth the [..] bucks?  I suppose, if you have zero access to places like usenet and don't know the meaning of the term ""website"".
