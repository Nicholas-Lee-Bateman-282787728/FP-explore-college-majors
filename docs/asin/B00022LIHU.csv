The main characters are Saul/Paul (Johannes Brandrup), Reuben (Thomas Lockyer), and Barnabas (G.W. Bailey).Directed by Roger Young, whose other religious TV film from 1999, ""Jesus"", I found really ghastly and blasphemous, in ""Paul, the Apostle"" the acting and writing are far superior, and it is not offensive in its treatment of the Lord.Shot on location in Quarzazate, Morocco and Malta, the cinematography by Giovanni Galasso is excellent, and it has a lovely score by Carlo Siliotto. The interiors and costumes are also good, and give a feel for ancient times.The DVD features no extras, and total running time is approximately 180 minutes.This is ""The Bible as entertainment"", and has some sections where scripture is recited and make for a few inspiring moments, but mostly it's simply a TV sword and sandal movie, with above average production values, and a lot of handsome, skilled actors.

I very much liked the presentation of his friendships with people who would eventually be his enemies after he was converted.

It is a visual-feast, action movie (80%) combined with pushing all the right Christian buttons (20%).  There is a nearly-dark 3-second breast shot, however, in this 3-hour movie, so Christian fundamentalists will freak out.  Moderate Christians, however, should be able to handle it.  (Hmmm... ""fundamentalist"", ""moderate""--where have I heard those terms before?)The ancient Christian and the present Islamist movements have some things in common.  Both involve colonizing the host and taking over from the inside.  Both have a propaganda component involving big payoffs to the faithful after death--although the Muslims with their 70-virgin ploy are more specific about what the payoff is.  Both use population expansion as a major tactic.  Both portray themselves as downtrodden victims.  Both operate in secret, although in the case of Muslims, the underground Islamist may be the same physical person as the above-ground moderate Muslim.However, the Christians used conversion of the leaders to clinch their takeover, whereas Muslims apparently plan to simply vote themselves into power when their numbers are large enough, an option not open to ancient Christians.  And the Christians took 300 years to complete their takeover, whereas estimates for a Muslim takeover are in the 50-year range.Whether thinking about any of this will enhance your experience of this movie, I can't tell; but it should provide some understanding of Muslims who also think that their religion is the one and only true faith.",3,a hybrid,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,1766,"['bought', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'recent', 'books', 'impending', 'takeover', 'Europe', 'Muslims', 'wanted', 'know', 'how', 'Christian', 'takeover', 'Roman', 'Empire.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'not', 'concerned', 'such', 'things', 'visual-feast', 'action', 'movie', '80', '%', 'combined', 'pushing', 'right', 'Christian', 'buttons', '20', '%', 'nearly-dark', '3-second', 'breast', 'shot', 'however', '3-hour', 'movie', 'so', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'will', 'freak', 'out', 'Moderate', 'Christians', 'however', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'Hmmm', 'fundamentalist', 'moderate', 'where', 'have', 'heard', 'terms', 'ancient', 'Christian', 'present', 'Islamist', 'movements', 'have', 'things', 'common', 'involve', 'colonizing', 'host', 'taking', 'over', 'inside', 'have', 'propaganda', 'component', 'involving', 'big', 'payoffs', 'faithful', 'death', 'Muslims', '70-virgin', 'ploy', 'are', 'more', 'specific', 'what', 'payoff', 'use', 'population', 'expansion', 'major', 'tactic', 'portray', 'downtrodden', 'victims', 'operate', 'secret', 'case', 'Muslims', 'underground', 'Islamist', 'may', 'be', 'same', 'physical', 'person', 'above-ground', 'moderate', 'Muslim.However', 'Christians', 'used', 'conversion', 'leaders', 'clinch', 'takeover', 'whereas', 'Muslims', 'apparently', 'plan', 'simply', 'vote', 'power', 'when', 'numbers', 'are', 'large', 'enough', 'option', 'not', 'open', 'ancient', 'Christians', 'Christians', 'took', '300', 'years', 'complete', 'takeover', 'whereas', 'Muslim', 'takeover', 'are', '50-year', 'range.Whether', 'thinking', 'will', 'enhance', 'experience', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'should', 'provide', 'understanding', 'Muslims', 'who', 'also', 'think', 'religion', 'one', 'only', 'true', 'faith']",N/A

First, the actor picked to play Paul is a ""hunk"".  Paul is reputed to be kind of homely.  Some scenes were so long & there was a good amount of bloodshead.  Yes, the Romans were vicious, but some scenes, it seemed were there just for ""shock & awe"".  For example, in one scene, we are told by the character dialoge that Paul had been released from a prison he was in by God.  Herod Antipas went to the prision and asked the guards who was guarding Paul & who was at the prison entrance.  Four guards stepped forward & Herod ordered one guard to kill the other, or the other would kill him.  The guard stabbed him in the abdomen.  ahe did that to another pair & finally, two remaining were ordered to kill a fifth guard - presumably Herod did this just because he could.  There was some erotic dancing in scenes.  The scene of Paul's encounter on the road to Damascus could have been wonderful, but it was terrible - it looked as if somebody put a clouded contact lens on Paul's eyes.  Then, when Anainias went to Paul to heal him, this could have been wonderful too.  In the Bible, wer're told somthing like scales fell from Paul's eyes.  That could have been done, easily, with all the special effects Hollywood has access to.  Paul made somthing like 4 journeys before he finally got to Rome.  The movie ends with Paul just seeig Rome at a distance!  Most of the other titles have helped me to learn about the characters, but this one really didn't.

821833,A6DMQ1ZU7YS9O,B00022LIHU,"Matthew Higdon ""California Chariot""","[27, 32]","GoodTimes' miniseries PAUL THE APOSTLE recounts for us the story of Saul of Tarsus, the Jew from Turkey, persecutor-of-Christians-turned-believer and herald of Christ, and cross-cultural missionary to the Greco-Roman world.The film breaks in at Jerusalem, around forty days after Jesus' resurrection. We see a Saul who at first shows sympathy toward persecuted Jesus-followers but, following `Pentecost' and the increasingly public proclamation made by its leaders, and compounded by pressure from a Sadducean priest named Ruben, he begins to have second thoughts and eventually changes his mind. We witness the stoning of Stephen, for which action Saul reluctantly accepts the killers' coats, and to which he does not appear to give hearty approval (despite Luke's statement to the contrary, if we take `Acts' as the source). When Saul becomes invigorated to stamp out the new Jewish sect, he proceeds on a written order from Herod (Acts has the high priest) to Damascus. His intention: to round up from the synagogues any such followers and take them back to Jerusalem as prisoners. As he approaches the city, a light knocks him off his horse, and Saul sees a very vague vision of Jesus, who tells him to go into the city and wait for further instructions. Ananias, after some prodding, visits and lays hands on Saul, who hurries off to be baptized. And on the heels of lengthy efforts to assuade the fears of believers both in Damascus and then Jerusalem, Saul (not long thereafter known as Paul) begins to gain their trust. The rest of the movie follows his communion with the early Christians, his evasion of Jewish and Roman authorities, and his missionary efforts to the wider world, for which he is rightly remembered as ""the Apostle to the Gentiles.""The movie looks authentic in its culture - especially in clothing - and desert landscape (it was filmed in Morocco). With respect to the former, Ruben's wedding to Dina makes an exception (ceremony, followed by dancing, and then intercourse) to the normal matrimonial tradition: at the end of the betrothal period, the husband takes the wife past a procession of celebrating friends, carrying her into the house, to consummate the marriage immediately. The film's dialogue is in English, and unfortunately a few of the characters don't appear very ethnically Jewish (blue eyes, green eyes, light brown hair). The miniseries recreates many of the events described in the New Testament book of Acts. In addition to the aforementioned ones, we see the arrest of Peter (Acts 12), the Council at Jerusalem (15), Paul's famous speech to the Athenians (17), the plot to kill Paul (23), his defense before Agrippa and the appeal to Caesar Nero (26), the storm and shipwreck on Malta (27), and Paul's visit to Rome (28). While there is a lot there, we are still left wondering: Where is Luke, or Silas, or Apollos? The movie, early on, combines statements from different speeches (Acts 2, Acts 3) into a single sermon. Later, it takes various statements from Paul's epistles and weaves them together, often indiscriminately, sometimes putting them in speeches, sometimes in writing. The film does well at getting the `Gospel' right. What Peter and John here preach is more or less substantially what the earliest Christians proclaimed: that Jesus of Nazareth is the risen Messiah and the world's rightful Lord.On the downside, acting and dialogue have turned out to be the miniseries' greatest weaknesses. Johannes Brandrup doesn't bring the intensity, the fervent ZEAL for the Law, that we would (and should) expect from the character of Saul. Ironically, Thomas Lockyer as Ruben is a much likelier picture of the historical Saul of Tarsus, emotionally and behaviorally. Saul tells us he is undeterred, and we see it ... a little. As a biographical picture, the film should have spent more of its first hour on showing us that zeal - Saul hunting down Christians - than so much of the other Christians' going about their way of life. Thus, when we finally get to the `conversion' experience, the transformation does not astound as it should. Nor do we truly sense any amazement on his part, that in all his zeal he had been quite wrong: the crucified Jesus of Nazareth was, after all, the Messiah. More than some of the acting seems frequently corny, cheesy, or contrived - with a few exceptions (the high priest, Herod). Equally poor is the screenplay, which possesses the same qualities, doesn't seem to know what to do with itself, and dances to various misconceptions of the popular level. From the perspective of history, certain persons, attitudes, and themes in this film have been implausibly rendered in a number of noteworthy cases.First, Peter appears to us - prior to the Spirit's arrival at Pentecost - as a fearful and very uncertain disciple. He asks John, at one point, whether the `mission is dead'. Place this after Jesus' resurrection (as the movie does), and the whole thing appears extremely improbable. After careful examination, post-Easter appearances or `sightings' (the specifics do not involve our present purpose) rather than the incident during Pentecost, provide the most plausible explanation for the disciples' motive to preach in Jesus' name, given the content of the proclamation, as well as the mission and shape of the early church. Jesus' resurrection would not, if absolved of his vocation and the pretext under which he was crucified, prove that Jesus was divine. BUT, if Jesus had laid claim to the messianic title, and been crucified as a would-be `king of the Jews', resurrection would function as the sign that God had vindicated and installed him as the true Messiah. There should be very, very little doubt that such an event would have put the fire, so to speak, back into his disciples' hearts and lives.Second, Paul's initial friendliness toward Christians seems to have been created out of whole cloth. There is no reason to suppose, biblically or historically, that Saul would have been favorably disposed toward Christians at any time prior to persecuting them. By his own admission, he was a Pharisee; from what we know of Pharisees we may say that Saul was of the Shammaite party. Placing him in a fuller context, this is what we have: Israel, perceiving her condition of captivity, desires national restoration. For Israel's god to do this, to free and prove her right, she must be found faithful, or she too would be swept away in the judgment befalling the surrounding nations. The `exile' must, then, continue until the nation repented and followed wholesale the prescriptions of the covenant (including especially Temple sacrifice and keeping Torah); when that happened, Israel's god would liberate her, and she would finally have the status and security promised her. With this at the forefront of their minds, at least some of the Shammaite Pharisees sought to make this come about - by whatever means necessary. Throw into such a community a local renegade sect that that brashly announced the exaltation of a man who spoke against the Temple and proposed serious modifications to Torah-observance ... and it becomes clear why a Pharisee, one such as Saul, would try to eradicate the group. By posing such an active threat (in his mind) to Israel's restoration - for which he and others were passionately and rigorously seeking - it was as though they were subverting Israel herself. Saul would not have dared to assist or consort with any Jesus-followers; they were apostates.Third (this is more clarification than correction), it seems clear that second-Temple Judaism was a religion, not about attaining salvation through moral efforts - as an historically-uninformed reading of the New Testament has led many to believe - but about remaining the people of God, of staying within the covenant, of observing Torah, in order to find favor with Israel's god ... in hope (for many Jews) that he would at long last act and bring Israel out of exile and into her proper dignity, into a new world in which furthermore it would become perfectly clear that Israel's god was God. Thus, when Paul `converted', he was not abandoning Judaism to propound a new religion. Rather, Jesus' death and resurrection had become the means by which Israel's God would fulfill Judaism's ultimate goal: the redemption of his people and creation from the sin and death that had corrupted them.Fourth, while Saul's former colleague Ruben may indeed have attempted to subdue the emerging Jesus-sect for teaching resurrection from the dead, he would not have been prone, as a Sadduccee, to pursue their destruction as a way of maintaining the sacred religious modus vivendi, Temple functions excepted. (Saul, as we have seen, would have worked to preserve Jewish religious identity on more covenantal and Torahic levels.) The occupational responsibility of the chief priests was often more civic than religious, as the Levites usually took most of the latter duties. The former, then, were more concerned with public order than with enforcing the priorities of Law and Covenant. That involved keeping a watchful eye on anyone preaching resurrection from the dead - which the Christians emphasized had begun with Jesus - because `resurrection' had notoriously served as motivation for faithful Jews to rise up and revolt against alien oppressors (here Rome) of the day.Fifth, the director makes the unwitting mistake of casting Paul's vision of Jesus as a subjective experience, with no referent corresponding to objective reality. Paul claims to have seen the real Jesus, really there (despite the fact that Luke doesn't make it apparent in Acts): we may infer this from the way in which Paul places himself within a list of eyewitnesses to a resurrected Jesus in 1st Corinthians 15. Paul mentions seeing Jesus in other writings too, though perhaps. The former mistaken assumption - that Paul's vision was of purely subjective substance - has in scholarly areas tended to give way to some understanding that what Paul had seen was a spiritual or heavenly (i.e. non-physical) Jesus. This, in turn, has routinely led scholars to think that, since this was how Paul saw Jesus, the disciples' post-Easter experiences must have been the same. The conclusion finally drawn out of these moves, erroneously from start to finish, is that Jesus was not bodily raised.Sixth, that the Roman military would have sought to have Paul killed (before AD 64) was not a feature of actual history. While Paul's gospel contained unmistakable counter-imperial overtones (if Jesus was Lord, then Caesar was not), the Romans themselves do not seem to have felt threatened by Paul's work or message, probably chiefly because he was not advocating open revolution, and emperor worship had not risen to levels of popular enforcement we have thirty to forty years afterward, in Domitian. Within Paul's time, the Romans had not yet figured out those unsettling political ramifications of the Christian Gospel. Rome's first official persecution of Christian comes in the 60s, when Nero blamed them for the capital city's great fire.Seventh, during the second-Temple period the term `son of God' could function alternately as shorthand either for the people Israel, or for the Davidic king: the Messiah. Only decades later did it come to employ trinitarian usage. Thus, in the beginning at least, when Jesus' first followers declared that he was the `Son of God,' they meant that Jesus was Israel's Messiah, and that is precisely what listening Jews would have heard, as opposed to `Jesus is God' (though early Christians came to figure this out as well) or `Jesus is a second God.' Nor would any such audience, chief priests included, have accused them of blasphemy - a charge reserved for anyone who would openly slander, or announce to share anything that was solely attributed to, Israel's god. Sedition possibly, but not blasphemy.Eighth, at one point we hear in the dialogue that the Sadducees don't believe in angels. Actually, the reference from Acts 23 to `angels' and `spirits,' (mentioned in such proximity to a disbelief in bodily resurrection) may refer instead to the intermediate state which, though following death, preceded the re-embodiment the majority of Jews expected for themselves, and to which revolutionaries especially looked forward.Ninth - and last of all - late in the movie one character mentions the ""end of the world"": a term that requires  some clarification. First-century Jews (and Christians, operating out of a Jewish framework) did not believe the ""end of the world"" was coming in the sense normally assumed by modern Western people. The current mainstream notion of God abandoning the physical world for a populated heavenly one, has in part as its origins certain Platonic categories espoused by later western theologians, such as Aquinas. When persons of Paul's time spoke of an `end' to the world they meant that history was nearing its intended climax, in which, as already mentioned - according to the classic and longstanding Jewish narrative - Israel's God would act to defeat the pagans and vindicate his true people, winning the decisive victory over evil and injustice, rebuilding the temple and attracting the Gentiles to Jerusalem to study Torah. We may call this the `Age to Come'. This was Israel's national hope, and it was for this that revolutionaries and would-be messiahs waged war on foreign oppressors and domestic traitors. Rome's effective failure to understand this hope, as well as Israel's steadfast determination not to lose sight of it, made the tiny Judean province exceedingly turbulent, troublesome.Of all its fallacies and ambiguities, the historical ones will go most unnoticed by average viewers. Despite its sincerity and admiration for Paul and the Christianity of his day, PAUL THE APOSTLE fails to deliver what could have been a far more inspiring and splendid portraiture.Sources include: N.T.

I didn't see any parts of the body you wouldn't want to see.  Unfortunately amazon.com is only selling the 2004 version as of 12/2005, but you can find it other places.  Look for UPC code ""018713502339"", that is the 2005 release.I'm greatly disappointed in the previews that you see right after you start the movie that you are FORCED to view.  These are not G rated previews mind you, I've never really watched them but I saw enough to know it was LOUD, there was an image of a dead guy, a scary guy with glowing eyes, and lots of fighting/violence.  You can't just skip over these either, the buttons to advance to the next chapter, and even go back to the main menu will not work.  Best you can do is fast-forward.  Terrible way to begin a biblical film!As far as the film itself, you can refer to the other reviews for the biblical inaccuracies.  However, I wanted to point out one thing.  The sound and video are NOT in sync, and I know it's the DVD because I've tried it in a few players.  You hear the actors talk a split second before their mouths physically move.

The movie fictionalizes Paul's early life to fill in the gaps left by the Bible.  That which is in the Bible is condensed to where it is half accurate.  Like I said, a typical Bible movie.  I did like the way the movie tried to contrast Saul with Paul to show what a difference Jesus made in his life.  They quoted a lot of his most popular passages as a voice over while he was traveling or preaching.  It was a good way to fill &quot;dead space&quot;.

821838,A1D60G5IR9U5Z0,B00022LIHU,Ryan Wilkes,"[3, 3]","I absolutely loved this movie!  I learned so much from watching it.  Many reviewers have complained about the very brief and very tastefully filmed nudity.  One reviewer called seeing a woman's breasts on what is her wedding night ""unholy"".  Huh?  Have none of you ever seen the Sistine Chapel?I approached this movie from the point of view of a recent convert to the Christian faith.  I was so impressed with the quality of the filmmaking.  The acting, the set design, the costumes, and the script are simply fantastic.  This is no low-budget B movie.  I don't know about you, but I sometimes find it hard to sit through a film that looks like it was done on the cheap.  It distracts me from the story and makes me very conscious that I'm watching a film.  The set design in ""Paul"" is so lush that I felt like I was transported back into the land of Roman Judea!Someone also complained about the dance scene.  Well, you could see more flesh taking a five second stroll on any beach in America during the summer.  The era in which these people lived was much more comfortable with sex and the body, and I think it would be dishonest to try and foist a Puritan sensibility towards the quotidien of life during the first century AD.  The dance scene that certain viewers are having such a problem with is actually used to point out the corruption and lasciviousness of Roman life that was creeping into the synagogues.  I guess some people just have a problem with any nudity in art, but I find that attitude to be rather silly, especially when the scenes were filmed as tastefully as these.  There was a problem with Hellenization that the rabbis during this time were fighting.  Some of the Jewish temples were converted into centers for worshipping the Greek deities.  The wrestling scene refers to this problem of Hellenization that the Rabbis were fighting.What is really amazing about this film is that it really humanizes Saul and shows what an amazing transformation he went through after his conversion (after he became Paul!):  for Christ to take a persecutor and and murderer of Christians as his twelth apostle just shows how awesome and beyond our comprehension the mysterious ways of God are.Also, unlike a lot of Hollywood type films about the Bible, this film takes the point of view of a believer.  It shows mystical, spiritual experiences.  It proclaims that Christ is God and is our Savior.  It shows the martyrdom of St. Stephen.  It shows how Satan works in diabolical ways in the hearts and minds of men and women to attack Christ and his Church.  This film wasn't made for really young children.  It was made for a more mature audience, and I found it to be a real blessing.
