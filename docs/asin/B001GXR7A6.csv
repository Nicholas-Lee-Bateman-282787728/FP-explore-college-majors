1198879,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B001GXR7A6,James Hiller,"[4, 4]","High school is a fruitful, feisty and furtive time in our lives. It's something we endure, some thrive, others wither and die, setting a course of their lives. Chris Lilley, comedian, spreads his special take on this time through the ""mockumentary"" format of his show ""Summer Heights High"".What impressed me most about his journey in this show is his creation of three absolutely complete and thorough characters. While they all somehow resemble each other, both in looks and in attitudes, they are extremely diverse, and there are times that you will love these people and hate them as well. His Mr. G, a flamboyant drama teacher who's ego cannot possibly fit in the staff room, puts on the musical of the year, about himself and a dead girl he never knew. Ja'Mie, a popular rich girl from a snobby school, spreads her charm (and lack of it) around the school with her gaggle of girls she's using to be in the popular crowd. And Jonah, a Polynesian student with a learning disability who's teased relentlessly for his race and struggles with culturally insensitive teachers.Lilley's performance through the show is remarkable as he inhabits and lives in the skins of his people. While designed as a comedy, and certainly rife with many comedic moments, what struck me, as a teacher, was the serious issues he covers and uncovers in these eight all too short episodes. Most impressively, is the character of young Jonah, who never really has a chance to excel between his disability and his lack of adult protagonists in his life, save one teacher who loves him for who he is. That story touched me deeply, and as the series ended, it was his story that resonates. How many Jonahs have we lost in our schools for precisely the same reason?Daring, risky, and occasionally on the edge between humor and inappropriateness, ""Summer Heights High"" is quite the show.

Chris Lilley's mockumentary is blindingly funny in his portrayal of three ghastly characters, who while being absurd and exaggerated for comic effect, do highlight many of the problems in schools these days.Of the three main characters (all played by Lilley, a triumph of method acting and makeup), Ja'ime, the self centered private school girl drags a little in her constant bitchiness and selfishness, as does Mr 'G' the effeminate drama teacher who puts on a show dedicated largely to himself. But the masterpiece of the show, I think, is Jonah, the delinquent Tongan 13 year old who begins by being a classic school bully 'punking' year 7s, but becomes a fully rounded character. We encounter his abusive father, begin to understand some of his emotional difficulties and some sort of emerging sensitivity as he responds well to one teacher (the subtle remedial English teacher Ms Palmer) and hopelessly to others - including Mr Patterson, head of student welfare, who embarks on a number of initiatives such as the doomed 'Polynesian Pathways' programme, aimed at helping islander students to find some sort of cultural identity through dancing ('This makes me look like a homo', is Jonah's predictable response).Summer Heights High is a fantastic comedy, but beneath lies a serious undercurrent of why society, and our public schools, are struggling to engage modern adolescents in learning.",4,hillarious egomania,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,1517,"['work', 'public', 'education', 'system', 'UK', 'can', 'relate', 'many', 'issues', 'documented', 'Summer', 'Heights', 'High', 'Chris', 'Lilley', 'mockumentary', 'blindingly', 'funny', 'portrayal', 'three', 'ghastly', 'characters', 'who', 'being', 'absurd', 'exaggerated', 'comic', 'effect', 'do', 'highlight', 'many', 'problems', 'schools', 'days.Of', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'Lilley', 'triumph', 'method', 'acting', 'makeup', ""Ja'ime"", 'self', 'centered', 'private', 'school', 'girl', 'little', 'constant', 'bitchiness', 'selfishness', 'Mr', 'G', 'effeminate', 'drama', 'teacher', 'who', 'show', 'dedicated', 'largely', 'masterpiece', 'show', 'think', 'Jonah', 'delinquent', 'Tongan', '13', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'being', 'classic', 'school', 'bully', ""'punking"", 'year', '7s', 'fully', 'rounded', 'character', 'encounter', 'abusive', 'father', 'begin', 'understand', 'emotional', 'difficulties', 'sort', 'emerging', 'sensitivity', 'well', 'one', 'teacher', 'subtle', 'remedial', 'English', 'teacher', 'Ms', 'Palmer', 'hopelessly', 'others', 'including', 'Mr', 'Patterson', 'head', 'student', 'welfare', 'who', 'number', 'initiatives', 'such', 'doomed', ""'Polynesian"", 'Pathways', 'programme', 'aimed', 'helping', 'islander', 'students', 'find', 'sort', 'cultural', 'identity', 'dancing', 'look', 'homo', 'Jonah', 'predictable', 'response', 'Heights', 'High', 'fantastic', 'comedy', 'beneath', 'serious', 'undercurrent', 'why', 'society', 'public', 'schools', 'are', 'struggling', 'engage', 'modern', 'adolescents', 'learning']",Summer Heights High
