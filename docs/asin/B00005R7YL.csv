But even for those of us who have mixed feelings about Disney Inc. and its business practices, this is an inspiring, and probably true-to-life biography of the man himself (who preferred to be called Walt).There is the usual mix of sugar and sweetness, but you'll also see the warts.What I found most fascinating is the wealth of old footage: home movies, Walt's early cartoons, how things operated in the early days of Disney Studios. His life certainly seemed to be charmed, be it in business or in love.Disney was the ultimate family man: it didn't seem to be an act. Sometimes he was an average Joe, preferring crackers and beans on business outings, while at other times, his excessive self-indulgence had a high wince factor (building his own railroad on his property just didn't strike me as charming).Surprisingly, he was a man who didn't believe in positive reinforcement for a job well done. In a way, he pioneered the mindset of today's corporations (that is, be thankful you have a job, and don't expect much in the way of compensation). Again, the self indulgence: Uncle Walt gets almost everything, and everyone else gets...just enough, no more, no less.This DVD is highly recommended.",5,Superb Biography,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,1245,"['Yes', 'Disney', 'fans', 'must-own', 'DVD', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Disney', 'Inc.', 'business', 'practices', 'inspiring', 'probably', 'true-to-life', 'biography', 'man', 'who', 'preferred', 'be', 'called', 'Walt', 'usual', 'mix', 'sugar', 'sweetness', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'warts.What', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'wealth', 'old', 'footage', 'home', 'movies', 'Walt', 'early', 'cartoons', 'how', 'things', 'operated', 'early', 'days', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'life', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'be', 'charmed', 'be', 'business', 'love.Disney', 'was', 'ultimate', 'family', 'man', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'act', 'Sometimes', 'was', 'average', 'Joe', 'preferring', 'crackers', 'beans', 'business', 'outings', 'other', 'times', 'excessive', 'self-indulgence', 'had', 'high', 'wince', 'factor', 'building', 'own', 'railroad', 'property', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'charming', '.Surprisingly', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'way', 'pioneered', 'mindset', 'today', 'corporations', 'be', 'thankful', 'have', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'way', 'compensation', 'Again', 'self', 'indulgence', 'Uncle', 'Walt', 'almost', 'everything', 'everyone', 'else', 'just', 'enough', 'more', 'less.This', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended']",Walt - The Man Behind The Myth VHS

Executively produced by Walt's grandson Walter Elias Disney Miller and narrated by Dick Van Dyke, it's a wonderful tribute to one of the most iconic men of the twentieth century.Van Dyke details the family history with never seen before home movies and photographs. It's a well balanced documentary with participation from the people who really knew Walt and who had worked on many of his creations. The famed ""Nine Old-Men"", the very animators who spent their whole lives at the studio,tell us why they were so devoted to a man who never offered personal praise.  You'll learn about the negative side too, the bitter 1941 animation strike, the accusations of racism and of Walt being anti-semetic, are also truely laid to rest. The birth of Disneyland, television and live-action are all included in this well paced two hour salute.Their are secrets to be learned, like how Mickey Mouse came about. How the animation process works, with plenty of footage from Disney classics to illustrate why they were the best and most inovative. Walt surrounded himself with good people, he was a master motivator and ideas man. But he was also human and that is well brought out, specially with his family.

I grew up watching &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, going to Disneyland more than six times in my life and visiting Walt Disney World once.  I buy Disney DVD's and other products from the Disney line. However, I knew a little about the man who created the &quot;magic&quot; and after viewing this outstanding DVD about the life of Walt Disney, I feel like I know him so much more.This is an account about the life and thoughts of the man who created a world where people are more happier today because of the dreams shared by Walt Disney.  The film begins with Walt's childhood in Missouri and California.  There are family films that are shown for the first time with the permission of the Disney family that show the love and warmth not only of Walt, but of his family and friends.The film also tells about his early workings in creating cartoon characters, working and paying his dues in the entertainment industry of the 1920's and finally with a bold stroke, creating his own studio where Walt could finally create much of the magic that we enjoy today.  The film also tells about the work and creation that went into full length animated movies such as &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Pinnochio&quot;, and other classic masterpieces.  Also shown is the vision that led to the construction of Disneyland and Walt's final dream...Epcot Center.The film also has moving interviews with intimate Disney family members such as Walt and Lillian's daughter Diane, grandson Walt Elias Disney Miller, grandaughters, grandnieces and grandnephews.  Close family friends such as Art Linkletter, Dean Jones, Ray Bradberry, and the late Buddy Epsen are interviewed as well as early live Disney stars such as Dean Jones.Each give a wonderful insight into Walt Disney and all still show loving devotion to him even 37 years after his death.Walt Disney definitely made the world a better place to live him and we can thank him for giving us a magical place to escape to everyday by watching the films, going to the amusement parks and so much more, because of his magical immagination.Every Disney fan will enjoy watching this DVD over and over again.Very highly recommended!!",5,The touching and definitive story about Walt Disney,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,2228,"['am', 'Disney', 'fan', 'plain', 'simple', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'quot', 'going', 'Disneyland', 'more', 'six', 'times', 'life', 'visiting', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'World', 'once', 'buy', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'other', 'products', 'Disney', 'line', 'However', 'knew', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'created', 'quot', 'quot', 'viewing', 'outstanding', 'DVD', 'life', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'feel', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'more.This', 'account', 'life', 'thoughts', 'man', 'who', 'created', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'happier', 'today', 'dreams', 'shared', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'film', 'Walt', 'childhood', 'Missouri', 'California', 'are', 'family', 'films', 'are', 'shown', 'first', 'time', 'permission', 'Disney', 'family', 'show', 'love', 'warmth', 'not', 'only', 'Walt', 'family', 'friends.The', 'film', 'also', 'early', 'workings', 'creating', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'working', 'paying', 'dues', 'entertainment', 'industry', '1920', 'finally', 'bold', 'stroke', 'creating', 'own', 'studio', 'where', 'Walt', 'could', 'finally', 'create', 'much', 'magic', 'enjoy', 'today', 'film', 'also', 'work', 'creation', 'went', 'full', 'length', 'animated', 'movies', 'such', 'quot', 'Snow', 'White', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bambi', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pinnochio', 'quot', 'other', 'classic', 'masterpieces', 'Also', 'shown', 'vision', 'led', 'construction', 'Disneyland', 'Walt', 'final', 'dream', 'Epcot', 'Center.The', 'film', 'also', 'moving', 'interviews', 'intimate', 'Disney', 'family', 'members', 'such', 'Walt', 'Lillian', 'daughter', 'Diane', 'grandson', 'Walt', 'Elias', 'Disney', 'Miller', 'grandaughters', 'grandnieces', 'grandnephews', 'Close', 'family', 'friends', 'such', 'Art', 'Linkletter', 'Dean', 'Jones', 'Ray', 'Bradberry', 'late', 'Buddy', 'Epsen', 'are', 'interviewed', 'as', 'well', 'early', 'live', 'Disney', 'stars', 'such', 'Dean', 'Jones.Each', 'give', 'wonderful', 'insight', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'still', 'show', 'loving', 'devotion', 'even', '37', 'years', 'death.Walt', 'Disney', 'definitely', 'made', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'live', 'can', 'thank', 'giving', 'magical', 'place', 'escape', 'everyday', 'watching', 'films', 'going', 'amusement', 'parks', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'magical', 'immagination.Every', 'Disney', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'DVD', 'again.Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",Walt - The Man Behind The Myth VHS
