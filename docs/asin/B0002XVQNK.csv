849573,ASGVCOD6F8SGW,B0002XVQNK,A. Tucker,"[14, 28]","Well I stand corrected.  I thought nothing would keep me from buying the two volume set of the second season of my favorite television show, Lost in Space, but I was wrong.  After seeing Fox release these volumes with absolutely NO extras I decided just to keep watching my VHS episodes.  It is absolutely unthinkable with all the extras available to them, not to mention a very cooperative cast, that they have given us NOTHING extra.  NOT ONE THING! Where are the promos?  Where are the commentary tracks? They sure aren't on these DVDs.  I thought the first season box set was skimpy enough but I bought it anyway in anticipation of what was to come.  Unfortunately NOTHING was to come.  I don't care if you relase the third season in one, two, or twenty sets Fox, if you don't put any extras on them I'm going to save my money for another company's products that include extras!",1,Forget it FOX!,1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,882,"['Well', 'stand', 'corrected', 'thought', 'nothing', 'would', 'keep', 'buying', 'two', 'volume', 'set', 'second', 'season', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'Lost', 'Space', 'was', 'wrong', 'seeing', 'Fox', 'release', 'volumes', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'extras', 'decided', 'just', 'keep', 'watching', 'VHS', 'absolutely', 'unthinkable', 'extras', 'available', 'not', 'mention', 'very', 'cooperative', 'cast', 'have', 'given', 'NOTHING', 'extra', 'NOT', 'ONE', 'THING', 'Where', 'are', 'promos', 'Where', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'sure', 'are', ""n't"", 'DVDs', 'thought', 'first', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'skimpy', 'enough', 'bought', 'anyway', 'anticipation', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'Unfortunately', 'NOTHING', 'was', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'relase', 'third', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'twenty', 'sets', 'Fox', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'extras', ""'m"", 'going', 'save', 'money', 'company', 'products', 'include', 'extras']","Lost in Space: Season 2, Vol. 2"

849576,A1475UMRVD1E6X,B0002XVQNK,Bob Siegel,"[10, 18]","As Season Two begins, something isn't quite the same as Season One. I'm not talking about the fact that the series is now in color( although, boy, you sure can see those paper boulders now)  I'm talking about the fact that the stories aren't quite as good and the feel is a little bit lighter.As the year moves forward, we begin to notice less science fiction stories and more fantasy. I do not mean Lord of the Rings quality fantasy,(the understatement of the century) but rather stupid singing Vikings, space cowboys,  well. you get the picture. (Mercifully I will not say much about the rock bottom episode with Penny and the dragon, that looked like a first grade school pageant and comes into a dead tie with the infamous vegetable people episode in Season Three)The show gets so stupid that many of the fans feel betrayed. Then, somewhere in the second half of the season it looks as if somebody at CBS got the message. The stories get better again(never as good as Season One, those days are gone) but better, with aliens that look like aliens and a usage of characters other than Dr. Smith, Will and the robot.(characters that I liked before they became too overdone and before Dr. Smith went from being an evil but eccentric villain and before the robot turned from a real robot to a creature that sings, laughs cries and make you feel embarrassed for even admitting that you watch the show.All in all, since it started out fair and ended up with an effort to return to the original magic, I am buying Season Two. Admittedly most of my reasons are nostalgic. I would be hard pressed to call any of this quality.But all the nostalgia in the world will not get me to buy Season Three. Although they traveled through space again on and off for the whole year and tried again to make the show science fiction, the truth is, it had gotten so stupid that the producers didn't seem to know how to get out of it.Bottom line: I love Lost In Space. But if I ever run for public office, I may have to employ a publicist who will ""categorically deny any ties to the series.""",3,Not Season One But At Least It's Not Season Three,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,2071,"['Season', 'Two', 'begins', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'Season', 'One', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'fact', 'series', 'now', 'color', 'boy', 'sure', 'can', 'see', 'paper', 'boulders', 'now', ""'m"", 'talking', 'fact', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'year', 'forward', 'begin', 'notice', 'less', 'science', 'fiction', 'stories', 'more', 'fantasy', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quality', 'fantasy', 'understatement', 'century', 'rather', 'stupid', 'singing', 'Vikings', 'space', 'cowboys', 'well', 'get', 'picture', 'Mercifully', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'rock', 'bottom', 'episode', 'Penny', 'dragon', 'looked', 'first', 'grade', 'school', 'pageant', 'dead', 'tie', 'infamous', 'vegetable', 'people', 'episode', 'Season', 'Three', 'show', 'so', 'stupid', 'many', 'fans', 'feel', 'betrayed', 'Then', 'somewhere', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'somebody', 'CBS', 'got', 'message', 'stories', 'get', 'better', 'again', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'Season', 'One', 'days', 'are', 'gone', 'better', 'aliens', 'look', 'aliens', 'usage', 'characters', 'other', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'Will', 'robot', 'characters', 'liked', 'became', 'too', 'overdone', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'went', 'being', 'evil', 'eccentric', 'villain', 'robot', 'turned', 'real', 'robot', 'creature', 'sings', 'cries', 'make', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'even', 'admitting', 'watch', 'show.All', 'started', 'out', 'fair', 'ended', 'up', 'effort', 'return', 'original', 'magic', 'am', 'buying', 'Season', 'Two', 'Admittedly', 'most', 'reasons', 'are', 'nostalgic', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'call', 'quality.But', 'nostalgia', 'world', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'buy', 'Season', 'Three', 'traveled', 'space', 'again', 'whole', 'year', 'tried', 'again', 'make', 'show', 'science', 'fiction', 'truth', 'had', 'gotten', 'so', 'stupid', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'it.Bottom', 'line', 'love', 'Lost', 'Space', 'ever', 'run', 'public', 'office', 'may', 'have', 'employ', 'publicist', 'who', 'will', 'categorically', 'deny', 'ties', 'series']","Lost in Space: Season 2, Vol. 2"
849577,A3H4TIVTTA5IBB,B0002XVQNK,Brian A. Wolters,"[11, 11]","Volume 2 of Lost in Space, Season 2 features some of the strangest and worst episodes of the entire series. The series was in full fantasy / adventure mode and most of this volume showcases this. Even with that said, there is a lot to like here.This volume opens with 4 stinkers yet in their own way, they are charming. From ""The Questing Beat"" through ""The Space Vikings"", we are treated to space fantasy at its most absurd. There is absolutely no real danger in these episodes and though they can be enjoyed for their own merit, you have to wonder how the series made it for a 3rd season.The rest of this volume is a mixed bag but we do have some highlights. ""Rocket to Earth"" is yet another close call in getting back to Earth with the always fun Al Lewis. ""The Cave of The Wizards"" features some genuine emotion from Smith toward his feelings for the Robinsons and a teaser about a possible lift off from the planet. And two great Robot episodes, ""Trip Through the Robot"" and  ""The Mechanical Men"".Despite some of the worst episodes of the series, Season 2 did continue to strengthen the bond between Will, Smith and the Robot, one of the best trios next to Kirk, Spock and Bones. With the aforementioned ""Cave of the Wizards"", we see that Smith was really more of a father figure to William at times more then his Dad. As a result, Judy and Maureen took a far back seat to everyone else with Penny being a distant third.Lost in Space Season 2, Volume 2 is the weakest of the two volume set.

849586,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B0002XVQNK,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[43, 43]","LOST IN SPACE began as a serious attempt at an exciting science fiction TV program. It was starting to degenerate into something quite different by the end of the first season and in the second season, the change was full blown. No longer was it a serious show. Indeed it was quite silly. ""Campy"" is the most common description.The change in format resulted in changed characters. Dr. Smith started out as a sinister but intelligent villain but is nothing like that in the second season. In fact, he has become the star of the show. He is venal, selfish and not very smart but he is lots of fun to laugh at. Will is the other star of the show. He was always depicted as exceedingly intelligent but he seems to have a soft spot for Smith and the Robot, the third of the first tier stars. The rest of the group are little more than background characters. Penny has a few prominent roles but Judy might as well not be there. Sometimes she utters less that a dozen words in the course of an episode.All of these stories are exceedingly silly and the ""science"" aspect is truly laughable. Pseudo scientific terms abound and are quite meaningless. All science fiction requires the suspension of disbelief but this series requires something more. It requires disbelief to be locked away safely where it has not the slightest possibility of intruding. In spite of this, the series works. It works because it does not take itself seriously. It is all done in fun and no one, even a child, could take any of it seriously. This is true in terms of story, special effects and, especially, aliens. Mostly, it is a vehicle to let Smith be a pain in the backside.This set includes the following episodes:The Questing Beast - a spacefaring knight in armor, complete with medieval camp, shows up looking for the questing beast. He takes Smith as a hostage and Will as his page. The basset hound wearing spectacles is a nice touch. The beast looks like a cross between a giant Muppet and Barney the dinosaur. She takes in Penny and gives lessons in elocution, manners and snobbish British etiquette. Will learns to be a cynic for a while and then everyone learns about chivalry, even Smith.The Toymaker - another intergalactic mail order catalog is found by Will and Smith.  Dr. Smith pushes the wrong buttons and becomes part of the catalog. Naturally, Will has to do the same thing. Meanwhile, a ""fissure"" threatens to crack the planet to pieces. It turns out that Will and Smith have been transported to the realm of a cosmic toymaker who thinks they are toys. When clerks from the store try to sort things out, chaos ensues. It's a normal episode.Mutiny In Space - Dr. Smith tries an experiment in rain making. In doing so, he destroys the weather station. He is ostracized as a result. As he wanders off in a huff, he finds a damaged spaceship captained by an admiral who acts like a vestige of the Nelsonian navy and dresses like a refugee from Wellington's army, complete with tricorne. Will and Smith get pressed into the service of the admiral who was the victim of a mutiny which saw him cast away in the first place. His treatment of his pressed hands threatens to incite another mutiny. Square rigged space ships? This is pretty screwy even for Lost in Space.The Space Viking - Dr. Smith is gifted with the gloves and war hammer of the Norse god, Thor. For Smith, these seem like the keys to satisfying his desires of avarice. This is especially true when a Valkyrie shows up to hail him as the most powerful of all. Unfortunately for Smith, and all around him, with power comes responsibilities such as battling frost giants and the like. He also comes between Thor and his wife, Brunhilde and a fight to the death is in order. Smith gets out of this by psychoanalyzing Thor into a babbling idiot. At least that part is realistic.Rocket to Earth - An itinerant magician happens upon the space family Robinson. The problem is that Dr. Smith is the only one who can see or hear him. This leads everyone, including Smith, to think he is going crazy. It helps that the magician is having fun making Smith go crazy. Eventually, Will and the robot figure out that the alien is real but not a very good magician. He does, however, have a space ship reputedly able to reach earth. That leads Smith to try and get a job as a magician's assistant so that he can get a ride to Earth. The technical term, I think, is ""sorcerer's apprentice"". Smith is not a very good magician either but it is not his magical skills that make him an attractive employee. It is his ""expendability"". He probably would have been expended had it not been that Will winds up on the same ship.The Cave of the Wizards - Smith gets amnesia and that makes his mind receptive to being taken over by an alien force. Another blow to the head restores his memory but not before he utters a wish to have his own ship in the hearing of the alien machine. The result is an imperfect replica of the Jupiter II. Meanwhile, it looks like the Robinsons finally have the real Jupiter II ready for launch but there is a narrow launch window. That window is threatened when the aliens who are controlling Smith set him up as their ruler. This is another one that pushes even more than usual at credibility.Treasures of the Lost Planet - Smith stumbles into a cave that seems to hold a pirate's treasure trove but is disappointed to find there is little of value. All he finds is a disembodied mechanical head. Meanwhile, Capt. Tucker, a space pirate from a previous episode shows up and Will has to rescue him from some other space pirates. It turns out that the head is the key to a great treasure. Gaining the treasure requires convincing the head that Smith is actually a craven, backbiting and untrustworthy pirate himself. It works.Revolt of the Androids - Verta, an android from the celestial department store and a previous episode shows up on the Robinson's planet. She is still striving to become more human but her particular line has been discontinued. As a result, she is ordered to be disassembled. Failing to see the justice in the situation she flees and a destroyer android is sent after her. While Verta is being sheltered by the rest of the family, Smith, Will and the robot hook up with the destroyer who is having mechanical difficulties. They are unaware of Verta's presence and try to fix him up. Smith wants to use the destroyer to gain access to the cave of a monster that hoards rubies. Typical Smith avarice. The plan to save Verta involves convincing the destroyer that she is human. She does this by giving him lessons in being a human. It degenerates into a robotic love fest.The Colonists - With as many visitors as they have, you would think that the Robinsons' marooned spaceship is located at Grand Central Station instead of some out of the way planet. In this episode, the family is trying to set up a series of communications relays when aliens destroy all of the equipment at once time. The source of the destruction is a princess from a race of women warriors and she does not like men. Furthermore, she has decided to claim the planet for colonists from her planet. The men from the Jupiter II are to provide the slave labor to make things ready. The women are to become members of the new society. Unfortunately, Penny seems to like the new regime. Smith, of course, tries to worm his way into the good wishes of the women.Trip Through the Robot - Smith manages to push the wrong button damaging the electrical system of the ship. Unfortunately, Smith had neglected to recharge the robot for a few weeks and now recharging him could further damage the ship and put everyone in danger. To prevent danger to the Robinsons, the robot wanders off to die alone. Will and Smith follow after him to try to find a solution but are unprepared for what they find. The robot has wandered into a ""dangerous area"" and collapsed from lack of power. A strange gas causes the prone robot to grow to a huge size and that is how he is found by Will and Smith. They come up with an idea to go into the robot and ""reverse the ions"" to shrink him back to normal size. The interior of the robot turns out to be a dangerous area. I sure don't remember anything like this from engineering school.The Phantom Family - While Dr. and Mrs. Robinson are off doing ""something else"" the family is attacked by an alien. Will happens to be out of camp at the time as well. When he gets back, he finds not his family but duplicates of his family. The alien wants Will to teach the duplicates how to be ""real people"" in exchange for getting his family back. Teaching the duplicates to be real is difficult except for the case of Dr. Smith. His duplicate is just as defective as the original and causes as much trouble. The duplicates are to be used by the alien to save his race. Since he is depending on Smith, his race is in trouble.The Mechanical Man - A race of miniature robots that look just like THE robot kidnap Smith and demand that the robot be released from slavery. They want him to serve as their leader. The robot is torn between loyalty to his own kind and loyalty to his ""Family"". As it turns out, Smith has more of the qualities that the little robots want than the big one does so a little bit of transference is in order. Its kind of fun to see Smith sucking up to the robot but this episode is at the extreme end of the silliness spectrum.The Astral Traveler - While trying to get out of a storm, Will and Smith duck into a cave for shelter. While there, Will finds a portal to a Scottish castle haunted by the friendly ghost of a laird executed for treason. After a brief tour, the portal reappears and will makes it back to his family. No one believes his story except for Smith who will, of course, grasp at any straw to get back to earth. In an attempt to prove the truth of his story, Will heads back to the cave and finds that the ghost has come through and is stuck on this side. He has also lost his status as a ghost and has a physical body again complete with gout. It is decided to send Smith through to arrange for a rescue party but things go wrong, as they usually do with Smith, and Will goes through as well. The ghost takes delight in tormenting Smith once he regains his ghostly properties.The Galaxy Gift - Another alien shows up and this one is being chased by other aliens with heavy ordnance. He befriends Penny offers him refuge in the Jupiter II. That hacks off the other aliens to no end. In return for her kindness, the first alien gives Penny a special amulet. It turns out to be the item that the second group wants and trouble ensues.The final disk has the ""Special Features"". It basically consists of a slideshow with audio interviews from Mom and Pop Robinson and Dr. Smith.",4,Silly but Fun,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,10772,"['LOST', 'IN', 'SPACE', 'began', 'serious',

849591,A2VG511JSFWQSM,B0002XVQNK,LIS Super Fan,"[0, 1]","As a long time Lost In Space fan...it was my favorite show as a child, I had purchased every season and volume except this one.  I know the show inside and out and knew that some of the campiest episodes were on this volume.  The earlier episodes featured some the best writing, acting and directing shown on TV.  Like most LIS fans (especially over 40), I too had wished the show remained true to the science fiction/family drama roots it started with.  But for some reason, the episodes on this volume were the ones that always popped into my head when remembering how I couldn't wait to rush home after school and check out the reruns for the umpteenth time.  ""Trip Through the Robot"", and ""Revolt of the Androids""- ""Crush, Kill, Destroy!"", are the high point of these episodes, but all the rest still have charm.  If you can sit through ""The Qwesting Beast"", you are a true diehard Lost In Space fan.  As was the case with most of season 2, Dr. Smith took center stage and was at his most devious, greedy self.  Surprisingly, Penny gets more screen time on this volume and that's a good thing.  She was always the most under-utilized of the Robinson family.  Will has some good moments and the Robot is always there to bail the family out of Smith's foibles.  The rest of the cast was pretty much in and out.  I bought this, knowing exactly what I was getting and my collection is now complete and ready to show to future generations.  I've even converted my wife who never watched the show when she was growing up.

849592,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0002XVQNK,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 3]","Season 1 of ""Lost in Space"" was presented as a single collection of eight DVDs.  Season 2 was split into two volumes.  Season 2 was originally shown in 1966-67, and though I no longer recall the contrast between ""Star Trek,"" which I watched contemporaneously with ""Lost in Space,"" and this show, the contrast had to be significant.  There are fourteen episodes on the four discs in this set, and none of them attempted any serious subject matter.  The second season disintegrated into pure camp.In spite of the silliness of these fourteen episodes, there are some moments of fun and ingenuity.  Hans Conried makes an appearance as a night chasing a dragon in ""The Questing Beast.""  This episode is enjoyable from beginning to end, and Will (Billy Mumy) learns a valuable lesson.  ""Treasure of the Lost Planet"" offers Albert Salmi in his second appearance in this series as a pirate.  The pirates are appropriately blood-thirsty and the search for the treasure casts Dr. Smith at his worst.  The ""Trip Through the Robot"" was hokey at best, but was still a lot of fun.  I kept wondering why everything in the robot was right side up though the robot was on its back.  Sean McClory is excellent as a Scottish ghost in ""The Astral Traveller.""  In the final episode of the season, ""The Galaxy Gift,"" we get to see John Carradine, who was an outstanding character actor, as an alien.You can count the number of science fiction television shows that left a lasting impression on viewers on your fingers.  As campy as ""Lost in Space"" sometimes was, it left an impression that is nearly as strong for many people as the impression that ""Star Trek"" left.  Of course ""Star Trek"" was a much bolder show, and tried to present some of the infinite possibilities that exist in the universe.  ""Lost in Space"" reached only a brief distance into the future and was the first non-animated television show that focused on a family of space pioneers.  There are plot holes galore.  Dr. Smith has to be one of the most obnoxious central characters in a television show ever.  And yet, I retain my fondness for this show.I think it is easy in this age of sophisticated digital effects and a chain of quality and classic science fiction television that extends back to at least the original ""Outer Limits"" to look down on ""Lost in Space"" as unworthy of appreciation.  However, the series was influential and it was memorable.  Had Irwin Allen been allowed to maintain the serious nature of the show, it is possible that ""Lost in Space"" would have been the landmark television show that ""Star Trek"" became.  I know I watched both, and I know I enjoyed ""Star Trek"" when it came out the year following the debut of ""Lost in Space.""  I considered myself lucky that two such wonderful shows were on at the same time.I look back on ""Lost in Space"" with fondness, and I enjoyed watching every single episode in this collection as well as those in season 1 and the first part of season 2.  I know I will enjoy the episodes in season 3.  Perhaps my fondness is all nostalgia.

849593,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B0002XVQNK,magellan,"[1, 2]","Lost in space came out when I was 13 years old, and although overshadowed by the much more sophisticated Star Trek a few years later, for the time it was state of the art as a sci fi TV series and I hardly ever missed a show. Also, I had a little crush on Penelope (played by Angela Cartwright) as no doubt did many other young teenage boys across the U.S.Lost in Space was the ultimate in sci-fi camp as it degenerated (or evolved, depending on your point of view) from the initial more serious episodes into a something that was sort of a combination of Swiss Family Robinson in space combined with the campiness of Gilligan's Island. Jonathan Harris's antics as he enlists the unwitting robot in various villainous but ultimately doomed schemes became an endless source of increasingly silly and cheesy plot ideas.I can't say I have a favorite episode, but I did like the one featuring Robbie the Robot from the movie, Forbidden Planet, and one episode features a very young Kurt Russell for all you Russell fans out there.I have to mention that I had the opportunity to meet the guy who was inside the robot at an event in Los Angeles last year, played by Bob May. Amazingly, 40 years later he still looked the same as in the original publicity photos. I wonder what the guy's secret was.Bob was pleased that I remembered that he (as the robot) had the biggest fan club of anyone in the show and received more fan mail than everyone in the cast combined. In fact, hundreds of fan clubs sprouted up across the U.S. devoted to the robot. :-)During the second season, the show got even campier and Dr. Smith even more dastardly and villainous and even more of a poltroon. Oddly enough, Jonathan Harris was a competent actor but his cheesy, unctuous, duplicitous, and overall unflattering persona on LIS is probably how he will be remembered. He deliberately cultivated the semi-British sounding, villainous baritone that became his trademark, but I don't recall anymore how he got the idea.In this part of the second season, guest stars like Albert Salmi, who I mostly knew from a couple of Twilight Zone episodes, Al Lewis (grandpa Munster), and John Carradine appear, offering some relief from the bland acting of the other members of the cast. Until this series came out I mostly remembered Guy Williams as the handsome, dashing Zorro in that series, but unfortunately he'll probably be remembered more for this one as will Jonathan Harris.By the way, people to this day still make fun of the Billy Mumy character, but he has had a successful career as a composer, especially for commercials, but his band also has a few hit singles, I have read. He also plays half a dozen different instruments. And oddly enough, he wrote the song made famous by Dr. Demento on his show, ""Dead Puppies,"" which is supposedly the top-rated Dr. Demento song. And he is the house composer for I think it's Allstate Insurance's commercials. Anyway, it's one of the big insurance companies.In the 1970s and 1980s, I recall seeing bumper stickers that said, ""Bring the Lost in Space Crew Back."" How many of you saw those at the time? Well, eventually they did bring sort of bring them back when they did the Lost in Space movie in the late 90s. :-)If you're an old Lost In Space fan like me yearning for some classic nostalgia from a simpler, more innocent time in our history, you'll probably enjoy having all the old LIS episodes on these DVDs.",4,True nostalgia from a less trouble time,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,3428,"['Lost', 'space', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', '13', 'years', 'old', 'overshadowed', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'Star', 'Trek', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'time', 'was', 'state', 'art', 'sci', 'fi', 'TV', 'series', 'hardly', 'ever', 'missed', 'show', 'Also', 'had', 'little', 'crush', 'Penelope', 'played', 'Angela', 'Cartwright', 'doubt', 'did', 'many', 'other', 'young', 'teenage', 'U.S.Lost', 'Space', 'was', 'ultimate', 'sci-fi', 'camp', 'degenerated', 'evolved', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'initial', 'more', 'serious', 'episodes', 'something', 'was', 'sort', 'combination', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'space', 'combined', 'campiness', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'Jonathan', 'Harris', 'antics', 'unwitting', 'robot', 'various', 'villainous', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'schemes', 'became', 'endless', 'source', 'increasingly', 'silly', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'ideas.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'favorite', 'episode', 'did', 'one', 'featuring', 'Robbie', 'Robot', 'movie', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'one', 'episode', 'very', 'young', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Russell', 'fans', 'out', 'there.I', 'have', 'mention', 'had', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'robot', 'event', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'last', 'year', 'played', 'Bob', 'May', 'Amazingly', '40', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'looked', 'same', 'original', 'publicity', 'photos', 'wonder', 'what', 'guy', 'secret', 'was.Bob', 'was', 'pleased', 'remembered', 'robot', 'had', 'biggest', 'fan', 'club', 'anyone', 'show', 'received', 'more', 'fan', 'mail', 'everyone', 'cast', 'combined', 'fact', 'hundreds', 'fan', 'clubs', 'sprouted', 'up', 'U.S.', 'devoted', 'robot', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'got', 'even', 'campier', 'Dr.', 'Smith', 'even', 'more', 'dastardly', 'villainous', 'even', 'more', 'poltroon', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Jonathan', 'Harris', 'was', 'competent', 'actor', 'cheesy', 'unctuous', 'duplicitous', 'overall', 'unflattering', 'persona', 'LIS', 'probably', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'deliberately', 'cultivated', 'semi-British', 'sounding', 'villainous', 'baritone', 'became', 'trademark', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'anymore', 'how', 'got', 'idea.In', 'part', 'second', 'season', 'guest', 'stars', 'Albert', 'Salmi', 'who', 'mostly', 'knew', 'couple', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Al', 'Lewis', 'grandpa', 'Munster', 'John', 'Carradine', 'appear', 'offering', 'relief', 'bland', 'acting', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'mostly', 'remembered', 'Guy', 'Williams', 'handsome', 'dashing', 'Zorro', 'series', 'unfortunately', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'remembered', 'more', 'one', 'will', 'Jonathan', 'Harris.By', 'way', 'people', 'day', 'still', 'make', 'fun', 'Billy', 'Mumy', 'character', 'had', 'successful', 'career', 'composer', 'especially', 'commercials', 'band', 'also', 'few', 'hit', 'singles', 'have', 'read', 'also', 'dozen', 'different', 'instruments', 'oddly', 'enough', 'wrote', 'song', 'made', 'famous', 'Dr.', 'Demento', 'show', 'Dead', 'Puppies', 'supposedly', 'top-rated', 'Dr.', 'Demento', 'song', 'house', 'composer', 'think', 'Allstate', 'Insurance', 'commercials', 'Anyway', 'one', 'big', 'insurance', 'companies.In', '1970s', '1980s', 'recall', 'seeing', 'bumper', 'stickers', 'said', 'Bring', 'Lost', 'Space', 'Crew', 'Back', 'How', 'many', 'saw', 'time', 'Well', 'eventually', 'did', 'bring', 'sort', 'bring', 'back', 'when', 'did', 'Lost', 'Space', 'movie', 'late', '90s', ""'re"", 'old', 'Lost', 'Space', 'fan', 'yearning', 'classic', 'nostalgia', 'simpler', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'history', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'having', 'old', 'LIS', 'DVDs']","Lost in Space: Season 2, Vol. 2"

There is a very touching moment where Doctor Smith tells Will(as he walks away) to not grow up too quickly.It is a heart felt moment and one you do not see very often on LIS.On the ridiculous side we have plots that involve a silly knight and a talking dragon,a ghost,a pirate,space vikings and a toymaker.We see the visits of actors Hans Conried, and in the last ep John Carradine.We also see the robot becoming more and more human,with his over acting,cat calls and jabs,usually at the expense of Dr.Smith.Jonathan Harris by now has become the star of the show.There isn't an ep he isn't in.The audience ate his performances up then and he still is absolutely hilarious with his sneakiness combined with his extreme cowardice.Even though you could hate him,you still couldn't/can't get enough of him.He made it look all too easy,and it shows just what a consummate actor he was.Included with this set are two audio interviews with cast members Williams and Lockhart together,and one with Harris alone.I especially recommend the latter,as you get a nice glimpse into the mind of Harris the actor.Lastly this is the last season with the same theme song and the ""same time,same station"" credits at the end of each ep.The last ep here gives us a glimpse at""next week's"" upcoming hijinks.Of course,as I previously mentioned in another LIS review, next week refers really to next season.But they re ran selected eps and the last ep of season two was run a week before season three was about to start.All in all I highly recommend this show,one the whole family can watch together.The show was getting less serious as the season rolled to an end(more tongue in cheek),but it was/is still enjoyable.",4,From the sublime to the ridiculous and back!,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,2251,"['Lost', 'Space', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'two', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'separate', 'snap', 'cases.Each', 'ep', 'scene', 'selection', 'option.The', 'picture', 'very', 'good', 'dates', 'was', 'filmed', '1967', 'usual', 'defects', 'associated', 'film', 'era', 'nothing', 'untoward.In', 'part', 'season', 'go', 'sublime', 'silly.There', 'ep', 'early', 'so', 'oddly', 'place', 'rock.Will', 'exposed', 'alien', 'knowledge', 'very', 'disillusioned', 'cynical', 'way', 'adults', 'behave', 'very', 'touching', 'moment', 'where', 'Doctor', 'Smith', 'tells', 'Will', 'away', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'too', 'quickly.It', 'heart', 'felt', 'moment', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'very', 'often', 'LIS.On', 'ridiculous', 'side', 'have', 'plots', 'involve', 'silly', 'knight', 'talking', 'dragon', 'ghost', 'pirate', 'space', 'vikings', 'toymaker.We', 'see', 'visits', 'actors', 'Hans', 'Conried', 'last', 'ep', 'John', 'Carradine.We', 'also', 'see', 'robot', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'human', 'acting', 'cat', 'calls', 'jabs', 'usually', 'expense', 'Dr.Smith.Jonathan', 'Harris', 'now', 'become', 'star', 'show.There', ""n't"", 'ep', ""n't"", 'in.The', 'audience', 'ate', 'performances', 'up', 'then', 'still', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'sneakiness', 'combined', 'extreme', 'cowardice.Even', 'could', 'hate', 'still', ""couldn't/ca"", ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'him.He', 'made', 'look', 'too', 'easy', 'just', 'what', 'consummate', 'actor', 'was.Included', 'set', 'are', 'two', 'audio', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'Williams', 'Lockhart', 'together', 'one', 'Harris', 'alone.I', 'especially', 'recommend', 'latter', 'get', 'nice', 'glimpse', 'mind', 'Harris', 'actor.Lastly', 'last', 'season', 'same', 'theme', 'song', 'same', 'time', 'same', 'station', 'credits', 'end', 'ep.The', 'last', 'ep', 'here', 'glimpse', 'next', 'week', 'upcoming', 'hijinks.Of', 'course', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'LIS', 'review', 'next', 'week', 'refers', 'really', 'next', 'season.But', 're', 'ran', 'selected', 'eps', 'last', 'ep', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'run', 'week', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'start.All', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'one', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together.The', 'show', 'was', 'getting', 'less', 'serious', 'season', 'rolled', 'end', 'more', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'still', 'enjoyable']","Lost in Space: Season 2, Vol. 2"

One of the reasons to watch old movies and TV shows is to see the differnt ways that actors of the past used to act. What we would regard today as stupidity was not regarded as such 20 or 30 years ago. About 20 years from NOW, our children and grandchildren will be watching the movies and shows we regard today as serious and think THEY are stupid.It is the very fact that Dr. Smith the Robot DO look ridiculous to us that is the very reason to watch the show. They are hilarious!It is not uncommon for a series to have it's most serious episodes on season one and the lighter episodes on seasons two and three. This is a tradition that goes way back. Even orchestra symphanies follow this pattern. The first part of a symphany is very serious business. The second is a little lighter. The third part is called the ""minuette"" which is the lightest part of the symphany. Then the fourth part is the finale.Star Trek TOS was very, VERY serious its first season. The second and third were far lighter with more comedy. That is the normal pattern of things.The second and third seasons of Lost in Space are wonderful.

The other gem is Revolt of the Androids, with its quirky android that has an infamous mantra of ""Crush...Kill...Destroy!""Some of the other episodes are dreadful but Dr Smith makes up for them everytime; Jonathan Harris injecting so much fun into his mischievous persona. I think the show lost its serious nature in the season but it became spacey and psychedelic so is a treasure of the 60s. Watch out for the creatures who look like fancy dress costumes, and look for cameos from some actors who did not know better.
