1438064,A1M6W196PK37RB,B0052T1EDQ,I'm Just Saying,"[6, 6]","This DVD is just candy for any John Pinette fan.  You just can't get enough of it.John is one of those rare comedians who can talk about a single theme year after year and yet has audiences holding their sides.  He talks a lot about food.  You just never know where he's going with it.  He is hilarious to say the least.Some of the topics in this one are the cake boss, Haggis in Scotland, Gluten story, the extended warranty, the toaster adoption and my favorite about the beavertail which he had to ice skate to get to....(I would say nay nay).  Why you ask, because a beavertail is fried dough covered in chocolate and M&Ms.;  and being John, he wanted one.....bad..... nuff said... bedlam ensues.......I couldn't wait to get my hands on this dvd, since I knew it was about a half hour longer than the Comedy Central special where they aired a condensed version of it in August 2011.  I hesitated to even watch the special on tv, because I knew I would be seeing John in person at the Sam's Town Casino in Tunica Ms. a few weeks later.  I couldn't resist.  I watched it all and was glad to hear some new material from John.  He is in rare form in this one.I have two of his previous DVDs(I say Nay Nay & I'm Starvin) which are most excellent in their own right.  If you have those and are wondering about this one, it's just as good and perhaps a bit longer in length. It's an excellent value for the dollars.It has some good extras. I especially enjoyed the part where he went outside a theater to meet some of his fans standing in the rain.  I can tell you from experience that he is most gracious when interacting with his fans.  There is not one bit of arrogance in him.John has become famous talking about buffets and as fate would have it, on the day of his show, I was walking out of the casino into the lobby area next to the players club and the buffet, and there is John Pinette coming in the door.  I'm sure I couldn't wipe the grin off of my face as I approached him and I know he could tell he had been spotted.  He smiled and we shook hands.  I told him I was a big fan and I didn't expect to run into him before the show.  I had brought my two DVD covers with me in the hope I could get them signed. There I was speaking to him and didn't have them with me(dang it).  When I told him this, without blinking I swear he raised his voice and said (as only he could).... ""YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I WOULD BE AT THE BUFFET!!!"" and gestured to the entrance to the buffet 30 feet from where we stood.  Needless to say, I was in stitches and somehow the autograph didn't matter anymore.  I had a story to tell that I would never forget.  He smiled again and we parted.Later that night, I went to the show with my dvd covers in hand hoping maybe I could catch him after the show.  Not only did he give us about an hour and forty minutes without hardly taking a breath so we could catch ours, I was in for another treat after the show.  We heard side splitting story after story. It was so funny.  That man ain't right!  He told some old stories and many new ones.  Some with a new twist which made them new again.  I was very entertained.After the show, John came out the side door beside the stage and came right out in front of the stage and greeted people, signed autographs and took pictures for about 30-45 minutes, at least. When he posed for pictures, he always made the people posing laugh, because he would go into character and say things like ""You Go Now"", or ""Get out of the line"", or ""How big is a small?"".  Everyone laughed.  It was like getting a whole other show experience.  Needless to say, I got my two dvds signed and personalized with an inscription.  It's a night I will never forget.  On one of my dvds, he wrote ""You go now!!!  Best Wishes"" and on the other one he wrote ""The small is small, Best Wishes.  If you don't know what those inside jokes mean, you haven't heard enough of John Pinette and you should buy all three of his dvds today.  I have rarely seen a celebrity more concerned with making sure every fan who wanted to get the chance to meet and greet actually got it.  He was in no hurry.  It was very refreshing and will only serve to further endear him to everyone who was there that night.  I can't say he does that every night, as I have only seen him once.  I am sure some crowds would be too large, but I bet it's a regular activity for him.  I think he really enjoyed it as much as the fans.  He's just super.For any on the fence about John Pinette, I would simply say this, experience his unique brand of raging comedy for yourself, whether on dvd or better yet in person.  Once you do that just once, I think you will be a fan for life.... as am I.  He's tops.  This DVD rocks.  Get it.",5,"John is a funny funny man, nice person too",1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,4738,"['DVD', 'just', 'candy', 'John', 'Pinette', 'fan', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'it.John', 'one', 'rare', 'comedians', 'who', 'can', 'talk', 'single', 'theme', 'year', 'year', 'yet', 'audiences', 'holding', 'sides', 'lot', 'food', 'just', 'never', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'hilarious', 'say', 'least.Some', 'topics', 'one', 'are', 'cake', 'boss', 'Haggis', 'Scotland', 'Gluten', 'story', 'extended', 'warranty', 'toaster', 'adoption', 'favorite', 'beavertail', 'had', 'ice', 'skate', 'get', 'would', 'say', 'nay', 'nay', 'Why', 'ask', 'beavertail', 'fried', 'covered', 'chocolate', 'M', 'Ms', 'being', 'John', 'wanted', 'one', '..bad', '..', 'nuff', 'said', 'bedlam', 'ensues', '.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'hands', 'dvd', 'knew', 'was', 'half', 'hour', 'longer', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'special', 'where', 'aired', 'condensed', 'version', 'August', '2011', 'hesitated', 'even', 'watch', 'special', 'tv', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'seeing', 'John', 'person', 'Sam', 'Town', 'Casino', 'Tunica', 'Ms.', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'watched', 'was', 'glad', 'hear', 'new', 'material', 'John', 'rare', 'form', 'one.I', 'have', 'two', 'previous', 'DVDs', 'say', 'Nay', 'Nay', ""'m"", 'Starvin', 'are', 'most', 'excellent', 'own', 'right', 'have', 'are', 'wondering', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'longer', 'length', 'excellent', 'value', 'dollars.It', 'good', 'extras', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'part', 'where', 'went', 'theater', 'meet', 'fans', 'standing', 'rain', 'can', 'tell', 'experience', 'most', 'gracious', 'when', 'interacting', 'fans', 'not', 'one', 'bit', 'arrogance', 'him.John', 'become', 'famous', 'talking', 'buffets', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'day', 'show', 'was', 'walking', 'casino', 'lobby', 'area', 'players', 'club', 'buffet', 'John', 'Pinette', 'coming', 'door', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'wipe', 'grin', 'face', 'approached', 'know', 'could', 'tell', 'had', 'been', 'spotted', 'smiled', 'shook', 'hands', 'told', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'run', 'show', 'had', 'brought', 'two', 'DVD', 'covers', 'hope', 'could', 'get', 'signed', 'was', 'speaking', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'dang', 'When', 'told', 'blinking', 'swear', 'raised', 'voice', 'said', 'only', 'could', 'YOU', 'SHOULD', 'HAVE', 'KNOWN', 'WOULD', 'BE', 'AT', 'THE', 'BUFFET', 'gestured', 'entrance', 'buffet', '30', 'feet', 'where', 'stood', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'stitches', 'somehow', 'autograph', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anymore', 'had', 'story', 'tell', 'would', 'never', 'forget', 'smiled', 'again', 'parted.Later', 'night', 'went', 'show', 'dvd', 'hand', 'hoping', 'maybe', 'could', 'catch', 'show', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'give', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'hardly', 'taking', 'breath', 'could', 'catch', 'was', 'treat', 'show', 'heard', 'side', 'splitting', 'story', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'man', 'ai', ""n't"", 'right', 'told', 'old', 'stories', 'many', 'new', 'ones', 'new', 'twist', 'made', 'new', 'again', 'was', 'very', 'entertained.After', 'show', 'John', 'came', 'out', 'side', 'door', 'stage', 'came', 'right', 'out', 'front', 'stage', 'greeted', 'people', 'signed', 'autographs', 'took', 'pictures', '30-45', 'minutes', 'least', 'When', 'posed', 'pictures', 'always', 'made', 'people', 'posing', 'laugh', 'would', 'go', 'character', 'say', 'things', 'Go', 'Now', 'Get', 'line', 'How', 'big', 'small', 'Everyone', 'laughed', 'was', 'getting', 'whole', 'other', 'show', 'experience', 'Needless', 'say', 'got', 'two', 'dvds', 'signed', 'personalized', 'inscription', 'night', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'one', 'dvds', 'wrote', 'go', 'now', 'Best', 'Wishes', 'other', 'one', 'wrote', 'small', 'small', 'Best', 'Wishes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'inside', 'jokes', 'mean', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'enough', 'John', 'Pinette', 'should', 'buy', 'three', 'dvds', 'today', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'celebrity', 'more', 'concerned', 'making', 'sure', 'fan', 'who', 'wanted', 'get', 'chance', 'meet', 'greet', 'actually', 'got', 'was', 'hurry', 'was', 'very', 'refreshing', 'will', 'only', 'serve', 'further', 'endear', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'night', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'night', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'am', 'sure', 'crowds', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'large', 'bet', 'regular', 'activity', 'think', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'fans', 'just', 'super.For', 'fence', 'John', 'Pinette', 'would', 'simply', 'say', 'experience', 'unique', 'brand', 'raging', 'comedy', 'dvd', 'better', 'yet', 'person', 'do', 'just', 'once', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'fan', 'life', 'am', 'tops', 'DVD', 'rocks', 'Get']",John Pinette: Still Hungry

Rivera,"[13, 19]","I first saw John while perusing my Netflix account, and I ran across his ""I'm Starvin"" special- I was in tears laughing the first time I viewed it, and I have watched it 5 times since, still laughing until I cry even though I know each time the material is a repeat venture. Obviously, when I saw his NEW DVD was out, I considered it a MUST-BUY!""Nay Nay"" was my reaction. Speaking of which, he doesn't use ""nay nay"" at all in Still Hungry. I understand he wants to keep things fresh and not hack his previous material, but this time around, the laughs were more forced than natural.My father hardly laughs at stand-up comedy. ""I'm Starvin"" gave my dad belly-laughs, 2 and 3 times around. He still requests to watch it with friends and family. When I told him I bought Pinette's new DVD, he was anxious to see it. He chuckled twice, the rest was silence, and there was a disgusted groan when John used the F-bomb. Just once.I commend John for his clean comedy. It's hard to do nowadays in the society that we live in. Heck, even Jeff Dunham lets things rip when on stage with ventriloquist dummies (although I must say that a dummy using language makes his act unique, and it's half the reason why his act is funny). It's okay to let things slip, but the context John used wasn't appropriate, and it was not part of a joke. I am not new to stand-up and I laugh at Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, Dave Chappelle, and countless other ""raw"" comedy acts, but John: I love you, man, but you could have done away with that on the DVD.Will I give John another chance?

1438070,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0052T1EDQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","I understand that comedy is subjective. Along with music, it is one of the harder categories of entertainment to judge because, oftentimes, it just comes down to a matter of taste.  But comedy DVDs have an additional stigma that other DVD choices don't face.  They have less replay value.  If you are a fan of a particular comedian and you follow them, you have to expect that you will hear some material that they've used successfully in the past.  The most common complaint I see leveled at comedy DVDs are that the jokes aren't fresh.  That's right, folks--every time a comedian steps up to the stage, his entire act isn't going to be newly devised and original.  And if you were going to tape a show for the general public to buy, wouldn't you use jokes and material that have proven popular and successful?  I would!That said, I was relatively unfamiliar with John Pinette.  I know his ""I'm Starvin'"" comedy special was something of a phenomenon, but I have yet to see it.  ""Still Hungry"" revisits many of the same themes that have made Pinette a sensation.  His comedy is centered around his life and the biggest bits are about identifiable subjects such as eating and shopping.  Pinette's shtick is that he loses his cool as people push mundane situations into intrusive nightmares.  His extended monologue about extended warranties may not be cutting-edge entertainment, but it is hilarious in its truthfulness.  So many times I found myself laughing and nodding in agreement.  That's his allure to me--I get where he's coming from.  Rarely has observational humor been so blisteringly real.  I'm a new fan.
