I loved the story of Beverly played brilliantly by Drew Barrymore who gets pregnant at age 15, and how her life as an aspiring writer and mother unfolds through many decades. Brittany Murphy is a hoot as Beverly's best friend, she steals every scene she's in. Steve Zahn is also wonderful, he never gets the respect he deserved as an actor, so underrated! This movie is based on a true story, I highly recommend this hearfelt and painfully honest look at motherhood, warts and all.

587663,AHT6KHGX5S4UY,B00005JKJS,"Amazon Customer ""Brent""","[9, 18]","The acting, cinematography, and overall filmmaking for this movie were fine.  What I fail to comprehend, however, is why this movie was even made in the first place.I found nothing special about Beverly Donofrio's life that would make me interested in hearing about it.  In fact, the fact that she wrote a book about her situation (having a kid while still being a kid)--a situation that is in no way unique in this country--is illustrative to me of the fact that she never did grow up.I'm not saying that this woman's life is not important, or that her struggles were not very real and tragic ones.  However, how are they different from what hundreds of thousands of women go through in life?  What supposedly makes her special?  I can think of nothing except the fact that she was a terrible, self-absorbed mother, whereas most mothers are willing to make sacrifices for their children.My life is nothing like Beverly Donofrio's was.  I did go to college, and received my Master's degree before getting married.  Then I had my family.  And you know what?  I still have to make sacrifices.  That's what being a mother is about.  Even though I got to do the things Beverly didn't get to do, there are still things I would like to do.  Like voice lessons, violin lessons, dance lessons, even own my owm business.  But I can't do these things, because if I did, I couldn't be a good mother.  But then, I guess it was different for her because she didn't love her son; she just resented him and the burden he was to her.  The only problem with her attitude is that, HE didn't make the choice to ruin her life--SHE did! And then at the end of the movie, she has the  nerve to declare &quot;I was a good mother!&quot;  Then I must be a saint.I usually judge a movie by whether it makes me a better person having watched it. Not only do I consider that this movie was a complete waste of my time to watch, but it actually took something away from my life and made me feel dirty and low. I could never recommend this movie to anyone.",1,Why should we care?,1085875200,"05 30, 2004",2004,2026,"['acting', 'cinematography', 'overall', 'filmmaking', 'movie', 'were', 'fine', 'What', 'fail', 'comprehend', 'however', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'first', 'place.I', 'found', 'nothing', 'special', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'life', 'would', 'make', 'interested', 'hearing', 'fact', 'fact', 'wrote', 'book', 'situation', 'having', 'kid', 'still', 'being', 'kid', 'situation', 'way', 'unique', 'country', 'illustrative', 'fact', 'never', 'did', 'grow', 'up.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'woman', 'life', 'not', 'important', 'struggles', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'real', 'tragic', 'ones', 'However', 'how', 'are', 'different', 'what', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'women', 'go', 'life', 'What', 'supposedly', 'special', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'fact', 'was', 'terrible', 'self-absorbed', 'mother', 'whereas', 'most', 'mothers', 'are', 'willing', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'children.My', 'life', 'nothing', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'was', 'did', 'go', 'college', 'received', 'Master', 'degree', 'getting', 'married', 'Then', 'had', 'family', 'know', 'what', 'still', 'have', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'what', 'being', 'mother', 'Even', 'got', 'do', 'things', 'Beverly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'are', 'still', 'things', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'voice', 'lessons', 'violin', 'lessons', 'dance', 'lessons', 'even', 'own', 'owm', 'business', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'things', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'mother', 'then', 'guess', 'was', 'different', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'son', 'just', 'resented', 'burden', 'was', 'only', 'problem', 'attitude', 'HE', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'choice', 'ruin', 'life', 'SHE', 'did', 'then', 'end', 'movie', 'nerve', 'declare', 'quot', 'was', 'good', 'mother', 'quot', 'Then', 'must', 'be', 'saint.I', 'usually', 'movie', 'better', 'person', 'having', 'watched', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'consider', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'watch', 'actually', 'took', 'something', 'away', 'life', 'made', 'feel', 'dirty', 'low', 'could', 'never', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone']",Riding in Cars with Boys
587664,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKJS,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","My wife loves this movie, and I have to say that I find it quite enjoyable myself.  Surprisingly, `Riding in Cars with Boys' is a decent dramatic comedy that touches the heart and pleases the viewer.  I say surprisingly because it never generated any buzz and thus became a forgotten film.  I love Drew Barrymore; I find her as talented as she is beautiful and I can't really get enough of her.  Here she shines brightly, as always, and adds layers to the film.  In fact, the acting across the board is extremely strong here and is a huge selling point.  The film has a few drawbacks; especially the ending, but there are enough highlights to make up for a few disappointing turns.The film tells the true story of young Beverly D'Onofrio who wound up pregnant at 15, married to a loser and living the life she never dreamed she'd live.  Beverly meets Ray after her failed attempt at seducing the handsome jock at a party turns embarrassing and humiliating.  Ray defends her and she is instantly smitten.  Of course we know what comes next, and once her parents find out she is pregnant she is forced to marry Ray.  Beverly wants to go to school, get her degree, become a writer; but being married and raising a child damper that drastically.  What makes things worse is when she discovers that her husband is abusing drugs and refuses to get help.  Beverly soon realizes that she has to help herself, and her son, and while things may not always be perfect she tries her hardest to make them work.Of course some of the facts have been tainted to add dramatic effect.  Beverly wasn't 15 when she gave birth to her son, she was 17; and she was not a high school dropout, as she is portrayed as in the film; but this is Hollywood and Hollywood likes to make things seem as hopeless as possible in order to garner the audiences deepest sympathies.  It works here.Barrymore is wonderful as Beverly, especially in her teenage years.  She develops a very believable and sympathetic character that is distressed, overwhelmed, overjoyed and scared all at the same time.  She has impeccable comedic delivery, but what makes her performance so warm and enjoyable is her ability to add the right amount of dramatic flare to her characters every action.  Steve Zahn was a total surprise for me.  I generally am not too impressed with his work but I found him to be flawless here; especially his `goodbye' scene with his young son.  I actually cried it was so touching.  Brittany Murphy has been on my radar for a while and she delivers yet again here as Fay, Beverly's best friend; and of course the likes of James Woods and Lorraine Bracco are nothing but brilliant; as to be expected.  Rosie Perez has a memorable cameo towards the end of the film as well.Adam Garcia is one of my disappointments.  His acting is decent but his narrative is annoying; in my opinion.  The narrative though is nothing compared to the jip I felt when the credits began to roll.  The film is so well constructed throughout, giving us a complete look at Beverly's life leading up to the conclusion and then it just lets go of everything without tying up those loose ends properly.  You can feel the tension between Beverly and her teenage son Jason throughout but in the final frames when he finally confronts her there is no real resolution.  They give it a very `Hollywood' resolution, painting a happy ending far too quickly for it to be believable or even understandable.  They could have easily added a good ten minutes or so to flesh that out.The ending aside, `Riding in Cars with Boys' is a very enjoyable ride.  I recommend this to any fan of Barrymore, for it's one of her finest turns, but also to any fan of the genre.  It is not the best of its breed but it is warm and touching and uplifting; a film that aspires to be great, settles on very good, and manages to be much better than expected.",4,Riding anywhere with Drew is always a joy...,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,3873,"['wife', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'find', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Surprisingly', 'Riding', 'Cars', 'Boys', 'decent', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'heart', 'viewer', 'say', 'surprisingly', 'never', 'generated', 'buzz', 'thus', 'became', 'forgotten', 'film', 'love', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'find', 'as', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'enough', 'Here', 'brightly', 'always', 'layers', 'film', 'fact', 'acting', 'board', 'extremely', 'strong', 'here', 'huge', 'selling', 'point', 'film', 'few', 'drawbacks', 'especially', 'ending', 'are', 'enough', 'highlights', 'make', 'up', 'few', 'disappointing', 'turns.The', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'Beverly', ""D'Onofrio"", 'who', 'wound', 'up', 'pregnant', '15', 'married', 'loser', 'living', 'life', 'never', 'dreamed', ""'d"", 'live', 'Beverly', 'meets', 'Ray', 'failed', 'attempt', 'seducing', 'handsome', 'jock', 'party', 'embarrassing', 'humiliating', 'Ray', 'instantly', 'smitten', 'course', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'once', 'parents', 'find', 'pregnant', 'forced', 'marry', 'Ray', 'Beverly', 'go', 'school', 'get', 'degree', 'become', 'writer', 'being', 'married', 'raising', 'child', 'damper', 'drastically', 'What', 'things', 'worse', 'when', 'husband', 'abusing', 'drugs', 'refuses', 'get', 'help', 'Beverly', 'soon', 'help', 'son', 'things', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'perfect', 'hardest', 'make', 'work.Of', 'course', 'facts', 'have', 'been', 'tainted', 'add', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'Beverly', 'was', ""n't"", '15', 'when', 'gave', 'birth', 'son', 'was', '17', 'was', 'not', 'high', 'school', 'dropout', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'Hollywood', 'likes', 'make', 'things', 'seem', 'as', 'hopeless', 'possible', 'order', 'garner', 'audiences', 'deepest', 'sympathies', 'here.Barrymore', 'wonderful', 'Beverly', 'especially', 'teenage', 'years', 'very', 'believable', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'distressed', 'overwhelmed', 'overjoyed', 'scared', 'same', 'time', 'impeccable', 'comedic', 'delivery', 'what', 'performance', 'so', 'warm', 'enjoyable', 'ability', 'add', 'right', 'amount', 'dramatic', 'flare', 'characters', 'action', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'was', 'total', 'surprise', 'generally', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'impressed', 'work', 'found', 'be', 'flawless', 'here', 'especially', 'goodbye', 'scene', 'young', 'son', 'actually', 'cried', 'was', 'so', 'touching', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'been', 'radar', 'while', 'yet', 'again', 'here', 'Fay', 'Beverly', 'best', 'friend', 'course', 'likes', 'James', 'Woods', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'are', 'nothing', 'brilliant', 'be', 'expected', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'end', 'film', 'well.Adam', 'Garcia', 'one', 'disappointments', 'acting', 'decent', 'narrative', 'annoying', 'opinion', 'narrative', 'though', 'nothing', 'compared', 'jip', 'felt', 'when', 'credits', 'began', 'roll', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'constructed', 'giving', 'complete', 'look', 'Beverly', 'life', 'leading', 'up', 'conclusion', 'then', 'just', 'go', 'everything', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'properly', 'can', 'feel', 'tension', 'Beverly', 'teenage', 'son', 'Jason', 'final', 'frames', 'when', 'finally', 'real', 'resolution', 'give', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'resolution', 'painting', 'happy', 'ending', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'be', 'believable', 'even', 'understandable', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'added', 'good', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'flesh', 'out.The', 'ending', 'aside', 'Riding', 'Cars', 'Boys', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'recommend', 'fan', 'Barrymore', 'one', 'finest', 'turns', 'also', 'fan', 'genre', 'not', 'best', 'breed', 'warm', 'touching', 'uplifting', 'film', 'be', 'great', 'settles', 'very', 'good', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'expected']",Riding in Cars with Boys

587669,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005JKJS,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Riding In Cars with Boys takes a relatively simple subject and really expands on it in order to show you how important it is. The subject being... how a woman who continues having her dreams crushed time and time again because of an unexpected teenage pregnancy is somehow able to eventually have those dreams come true... though not in ANY kind of way that she'd ever expect, haha.This film delivers in more excellent writing than I've seen in quite a long time. Brittany Murphy plays the role of her best friend who supports her no matter what, so in one scene Brittany's character gives a dramatic and impactful speech during a family party right after Drew finds out she's pregnant, and Drew's father has mixed feelings about his daughter as a result.Anyway, in that scene, Brittany's character stands up for Drew and explains to her family that Drew is still a beautiful human being and should *still* be a part of the family despite making a big mistake, and she deserves to be supported no matter what. This is a REALLY good piece of writing here, that's why I'm mentioning it. A really emotional moment to me personally.Just to clear things up, no, the film isn't actually about riding in cars with boys, haha. Talk about a boring subject if THAT were the case. In addition to Drew's character playing a teenager who gives birth to a baby boy, the storyline eventually develops into her character having to take care of her son. As a result, we see the progression of Drew go from a confused teenager to a struggling  adult, and her son who goes from a baby, to a child, to a young responsible adult.The guy who plays the father (Steve Zahn's character) plays the part of someone who's completely unreliable and a drug addict. He doesn't ever hit Drew's character during a fighting scene or anything like that- he's more like a loser with no motivation to keep his family together, so eventually things fall apart and he ends up leaving her.The conclusion of the storyline is really good. The film is mighty long around 2 hours and 10 minutes, but I recommend you keep watching it for the ending (that is, if you happen to find the rest of the film boring, the conclusion might save it for you because it's so touching).A great film with brilliant acting, and just a terrific job all around by everyone involved.",5,"wow, great movie",1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,2320,"['Riding', 'Cars', 'Boys', 'relatively', 'simple', 'subject', 'really', 'order', 'show', 'how', 'important', 'subject', 'being', 'how', 'woman', 'who', 'having', 'dreams', 'crushed', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'unexpected', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'somehow', 'able', 'eventually', 'have', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'not', 'ANY', 'kind', 'way', ""'d"", 'ever', 'expect', 'haha.This', 'film', 'delivers', 'more', 'excellent', 'writing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'role', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'matter', 'what', 'so', 'one', 'scene', 'Brittany', 'character', 'dramatic', 'impactful', 'speech', 'family', 'party', 'right', 'Drew', 'out', 'pregnant', 'Drew', 'father', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'daughter', 'result.Anyway', 'scene', 'Brittany', 'character', 'up', 'Drew', 'family', 'Drew', 'still', 'beautiful', 'human', 'being', 'should', '*still*', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'making', 'big', 'mistake', 'be', 'supported', 'matter', 'what', 'REALLY', 'good', 'piece', 'writing', 'here', 'why', ""'m"", 'mentioning', 'A', 'really', 'emotional', 'moment', 'personally.Just', 'clear', 'things', 'up', 'film', ""n't"", 'actually', 'riding', 'cars', 'boys', 'haha', 'Talk', 'boring', 'subject', 'were', 'case', 'addition', 'Drew', 'character', 'playing', 'teenager', 'who', 'birth', 'baby', 'boy', 'storyline', 'eventually', 'character', 'having', 'take', 'care', 'son', 'result', 'see', 'progression', 'Drew', 'go', 'confused', 'teenager', 'struggling', 'adult', 'son', 'who', 'baby', 'child', 'young', 'responsible', 'adult.The', 'guy', 'who', 'father', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'character', 'part', 'someone', 'who', 'completely', 'unreliable', 'drug', 'addict', ""n't"", 'ever', 'hit', 'Drew', 'character', 'fighting', 'scene', 'anything', 'that-', 'more', 'loser', 'motivation', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'so', 'eventually', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'up', 'leaving', 'her.The', 'conclusion', 'storyline', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'mighty', 'long', 'around', '2', 'hours', '10', 'minutes', 'recommend', 'keep', 'watching', 'ending', 'happen', 'find', 'rest', 'film', 'boring', 'conclusion', 'might', 'save', 'so', 'touching', 'great', 'film', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'just', 'terrific', 'job', 'everyone', 'involved']",Riding in Cars with Boys

The story is an excellent one, bad girl makes good.  I have not read the book, but it's definitely on my reading list!  Drew Barrymore playes Beverly D'Onofrio, a teenage girl with a flair for writing who, after a night of drunken partying, gets pregnant.  Unfortunately, the father of her baby is not at all someone she ever pictured herself being with.  In the course of one day, she sees all the potential she ever had--college, being a writer, living a normal teenage life, etc--evaporate when she chooses to marry Raymond to placate her distraught parents.  Her parents are less than supportive and each time she makes a bad decision, she pays dearly.  The story flashes back and forth between Beverly's story from the time she got pregnant and present day Beverly riding in the car with her 20 year-old son.  I won't tell you where they are going, it spoils some of the movie.  Inevitably, Raymond lets her and her son down and Beverly is left with making the hardest choice of all--to raise her son alone.

587675,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005JKJS,D. Litton,"[16, 23]","""Riding in Cars With Boys"" is touted as a human drama about ""a girl who did everything wrong but got everything right."" I'm no novice when it comes to matters of child care and raising a family, but what exactly did the film's protagonist/antagonist accomplish in the course of bringing up her son that could be considered the least bit inspiring or heartwarming, two traits the movie aspires to embody?Based on the memoir of the same name written by Beverly Donofrio, it begins by introducing us to a young girl who, as seen asking her father for a push-up bra for Christmas (she's only 11 at the time), is blossoming into womanhood at an early age. Early enough, in fact, to conceive her first child at age 15, become a high school dropout to marry a loser and discover that being a wife and mother isn't all it's cracked up to be, no matter how hard she tries to pretend she's content.Drew Barrymore plays Beverly between the age ranges of 15 and mid-30's, and strives hard for success. Her husband, a drunken slob played by Steve Zahn, is more of an obstacle than a helping hand, spending his time drinking and nursing a heroin addiction, all the while ruining her aspirations of breaking free and going to college to make a better life for herself and her son, Jason. She has a best friend, Fay (Brittany Murphy), who carried a child along with Beverly, but is supported by her upper-class family, while Beverly's father, played by James Woods, has disowned her.For a while, the material seems to carry some good potential, as Beverly tries ever-so-hard to make a success out of herself. She studies for her high school diploma, makes plans for the future, and starts to get her life on track, only to find her dreams crushed in the absence of now-departed Zahn. But no sooner do we start feeling sympathetic for her than she starts doing things like drying weed for money, and dabbling with Fay in illegal substances, a decision that nearly costs her Jason's life.Throughout much of the film, she looks at raising her son as more of a job than a joy, the result being a lack of emotional resonance from her character. Her careless nature in her child's upbringing leaves one to wonder just exactly what we are supposed to be feeling for such a person who blames their child for spilling the beans about their wrongdoings, which results in further unhappiness.The film attempts to counter these irresponsible acts by incorporating a present-day story, set in 1986, as Beverly and a 20-year-old Jason travel to see his father for one last time. Here, Beverly is cold and embittered, as is Jason, who feels his life has been overshadowed by his mother's carelessness in raising him. Supposedly, this is aimed at providing these two characters a chance at reconciliation; I'll let you be the judge of whether or not such a ploy works.Barrymore, putting on all the charm and endearing smiles she can muster, succeeds in portraying a variety of emotions and moods, even if Beverly is not worth the time getting to know. Zahn makes a lasting impression as her addict husband, and Woods is a knock-out as a father crushed by a shocking revelation from his daughter. But acting alone cannot keep one from wondering why ""Riding in Cars With Boys"" wants us to feel pity for someone who doesn't seem to learn from her previous mistakes.",2,A lack of emotional resonance.,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,3330,"['Riding', 'Cars', 'Boys', 'touted', 'human', 'drama', 'girl', 'who', 'did', 'everything', 'wrong', 'got', 'everything', 'right', ""'m"", 'novice', 'when', 'matters', 'child', 'care', 'raising', 'family', 'what', 'exactly', 'did', 'film', 'protagonist/antagonist', 'accomplish', 'course', 'bringing', 'up', 'son', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'least', 'bit', 'inspiring', 'heartwarming', 'two', 'traits', 'movie', 'embody', 'Based', 'memoir', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'introducing', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'seen', 'asking', 'father', 'push-up', 'bra', 'Christmas', 'only', '11', 'time', 'blossoming', 'womanhood', 'early', 'age', 'Early', 'enough', 'fact', 'conceive', 'first', 'child', 'age', '15', 'become', 'high', 'school', 'dropout', 'marry', 'loser', 'discover', 'being', 'wife', 'mother', ""n't"", 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'pretend', 'content.Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Beverly', 'age', '15', 'mid-30', 'hard', 'success', 'husband', 'drunken', 'slob', 'played', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'more', 'obstacle', 'helping', 'hand', 'spending', 'time', 'drinking', 'nursing', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'while', 'ruining', 'aspirations', 'breaking', 'free', 'going', 'college', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'herself', 'son', 'Jason', 'best', 'friend', 'Fay', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'who', 'carried', 'child', 'Beverly', 'supported', 'upper-class', 'family', 'Beverly', 'father', 'played', 'James', 'Woods', 'disowned', 'while', 'material', 'carry', 'good', 'potential', 'Beverly', 'ever-so-hard', 'make', 'success', 'herself', 'studies', 'high', 'school', 'diploma', 'plans', 'future', 'get', 'life', 'track', 'only', 'find', 'dreams', 'crushed', 'absence', 'now-departed', 'Zahn', 'sooner', 'do', 'start', 'feeling', 'sympathetic', 'doing', 'things', 'drying', 'weed', 'money', 'dabbling', 'Fay', 'illegal', 'substances', 'decision', 'nearly', 'Jason', 'life.Throughout', 'much', 'film', 'raising', 'son', 'more', 'job', 'joy', 'result', 'being', 'lack', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'character', 'careless', 'nature', 'child', 'upbringing', 'one', 'wonder', 'just', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'feeling', 'person', 'who', 'child', 'spilling', 'beans', 'wrongdoings', 'results', 'further', 'unhappiness.The', 'film', 'attempts', 'counter', 'irresponsible', 'acts', 'incorporating', 'present-day', 'story', 'set', '1986', 'Beverly', '20-year-old', 'Jason', 'travel', 'see', 'father', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'Here', 'Beverly', 'cold', 'embittered', 'Jason', 'who', 'life', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'mother', 'carelessness', 'raising', 'Supposedly', 'aimed', 'providing', 'two', 'characters', 'chance', 'reconciliation', ""'ll"", 'let', 'be', 'judge', 'not', 'such', 'ploy', 'works.Barrymore', 'putting', 'charm', 'endearing', 'smiles', 'can', 'muster', 'portraying', 'variety', 'emotions', 'moods', 'even', 'Beverly', 'not', 'time', 'getting', 'know', 'Zahn', 'lasting', 'impression', 'addict', 'husband', 'Woods', 'knock-out', 'father', 'crushed', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'daughter', 'acting', 'alone', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'one', 'wondering', 'why', 'Riding', 'Cars', 'Boys', 'feel', 'pity', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'learn', 'previous', 'mistakes']",Riding in Cars with Boys

This movie tells the story of a woman, who I did not care for at all, or have any sympathy for, named Beverly Donofrio.Bev, at age 15, makes a &quot;mistake&quot; that changes her life forever.In the meantime, she is ruthless about getting a college education and getting her book, same title as the movie, published.  While it is good to be ambitious, it is not good to be so darn selfish, irresponsible(even for age 15), and well, just plain mean.I found Bev to be a very unsympathic, rude, sometimes heartless and unfeeling person. Why was this film even made? Who should even care about this woman as she is just a total selfish, well, female dog for lack of a better word.  And why did I bother renting it?  I'll tell you...Yes, I squirmed in my seat a lot, and forced myself to watch the entire movie.  I did however, like the performance of Brittany Murphy, who plays Bev's best friend, Fae. She had her character down, and is a great young actress with a lot of potential. Murphy, and pretty much every other actor on the screen, totally outacted Drew.  I just don't think she is a good actress at all.  She had a very forced and unrealistic New York accent, also.  Both her and her character annoyed me beyond belief.There were some very poignant, and truly funny momments in this film between Bev and her family and friends.  It wasn't a total waste of time, but it wasn't great.  There are far better movies from 2001.James Woods, Lorraine Bracco, and Steve Zahn were all very good in their roles, and very believable.

587677,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKJS,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 5]","This inspirational film is based on an autobiographical book by Beverly Donofrio describing the trials and tribulations of her life growing up in the 1960's and `70's.  Donofrio also co-produced the film, so the final product is probably a reasonably close to the events as she hoped to have them conveyed.  Though I have not read the book, the reviews and reader comments seem to indicate that this was a sanitized version of her life, leaving out much of the decadence that followed the failure of her marriage.  Nonetheless, it is a stirring story about overcoming adversity, self imposed though it was, to triumph and fulfill her dream of getting a college education and becoming a published writer.Penny Marshall directs this film and turns what probably should have been a melodrama into a bittersweet comedy.  Marshall is excellent at presenting the human dynamic, and that is evident here.  This film is also an outstanding period piece, with meticulous attention to detail regarding period props, costumes and music.  This is all the more impressive when one considers that the story spans over 30 years and each period is rendered with near perfect precision.Marshall coaxes a polished performance out of Drew Barrymore, whose roles are normally confined to significantly lighter fare.  Barrymore breezes through the childhood scenes and gives a fine performance, but as the character ages, she becomes less effective and playing Adam Garcia's mother (Garcia is actually 2 years older than she is) she is barely credible.  Still, this is the most mature performance I've seen from Barrymore and it might be a gateway to more serious dramatic roles.The supporting acting buoys the film and makes Barrymore look that much better.  Brittany Murphy's performance as Fay is superlative, at times overshadowing the star with a vivacious and sincere portrayal of Bev's best girlfriend.  With each role, I am more impressed with the way Murphy throw's herself into her character and pours emotion into the frame.  I actually would have liked to have seen Murphy in the lead role as Bev, her performance was that strong.  Steve Zahn also shines as Bev's hapless husband.  Zahn gives us an endearing character that is as earnest as he is pathetic.  Adam Garcia brings forth a very believable teen Jason, torn between his need to have his own life and a dedication to the mother who torments him.This film has a lot going for it.  The story is compelling, the direction steady and the acting is generally well done.  Marshall may have introduced a bit too much levity considering the difficult challenges of Donofrio's life, but not to the point of trivializing the film.  I rated this film an 8/10.  It will have strong appeal to women, especially single mothers.",4,An inspirational story,1021334400,"05 14, 2002",2002,2763,"['inspirational', 'film', 'based', 'autobiographical', 'book', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'describing', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'life', 'growing', 'up', '1960', '70', 'Donofrio', 'also', 'co-produced', 'film', 'final', 'product', 'probably', 'reasonably', 'close', 'events', 'hoped', 'have', 'conveyed', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'reviews', 'reader', 'comments', 'seem', 'indicate', 'was', 'sanitized', 'version', 'life', 'leaving', 'out', 'much', 'decadence', 'followed', 'failure', 'marriage', 'Nonetheless', 'stirring', 'story', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'self', 'imposed', 'was', 'triumph', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'getting', 'college', 'education', 'becoming', 'published', 'writer.Penny', 'Marshall', 'film', 'what', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'melodrama', 'bittersweet', 'comedy', 'Marshall', 'excellent', 'presenting', 'human', 'dynamic', 'evident', 'here', 'film', 'also', 'outstanding', 'period', 'piece', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'detail', 'regarding', 'period', 'props', 'costumes', 'music', 'more', 'impressive', 'when', 'one', 'story', '30', 'years', 'period', 'rendered', 'near', 'perfect', 'precision.Marshall', 'polished', 'performance', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'roles', 'are', 'normally', 'confined', 'significantly', 'lighter', 'fare', 'Barrymore', 'childhood', 'scenes', 'fine', 'performance', 'character', 'ages', 'less', 'effective', 'playing', 'Adam', 'Garcia', 'mother', 'Garcia', 'actually', '2', 'years', 'older', 'barely', 'credible', 'Still', 'most', 'mature', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Barrymore', 'might', 'be', 'gateway', 'more', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'roles.The', 'supporting', 'acting', 'film', 'Barrymore', 'look', 'much', 'better', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'performance', 'Fay', 'superlative', 'times', 'overshadowing', 'star', 'vivacious', 'sincere', 'portrayal', 'Bev', 'best', 'girlfriend', 'role', 'am', 'more', 'impressed', 'way', 'Murphy', 'throw', 'character', 'pours', 'emotion', 'frame', 'actually', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Murphy', 'lead', 'role', 'Bev', 'performance', 'was', 'strong', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'also', 'Bev', 'hapless', 'husband', 'Zahn', 'endearing', 'character', 'as', 'earnest', 'pathetic', 'Adam', 'Garcia', 'forth', 'very', 'believable', 'teen', 'Jason', 'torn', 'need', 'have', 'own', 'life', 'dedication', 'mother', 'who', 'him.This', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'story', 'compelling', 'direction', 'steady', 'acting', 'generally', 'well', 'done', 'Marshall', 'may', 'have', 'introduced', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'levity', 'considering', 'difficult', 'challenges', 'Donofrio', 'life', 'not', 'point', 'trivializing', 'film', 'rated', 'film', '8/10', 'will', 'have', 'strong', 'appeal', 'women', 'especially', 'single', 'mothers']",Riding in Cars with Boys

Penny Marshall has done it again, directing a film that struck all the right cords in me...much like the movie ""Where the Heart Is"" ( A masterpiece itself-not to be missed).Drew Barrymore plays Beverly, a fifteen year old who spoils her father's (James Wood) life plan to have a perfect family by getting knocked up at the age of 15.  While her family ponders what to ""do"" with her, Beverly has a plan already in formation(She IS a talented and smart girl after all). She will get a job, finish high school, and go to college. Her parents don't want a family crisis or controversy, so they convince her to marry the father of her child instead(Steve Zahn), who is a washed-up drip of a loser, yet a willing father and husband.  Bev agrees, not wanting to cause her family any more grief.While this movie is meant to be dramatic, it offers some outright laughs during very intense scenes. At Beverly's wedding (she wears pink) her best friend Fran (The VERY talented Brittany Murphy from ""Girl Interupted"" and ""Don't Say a Word"") announces to the wedding crowd that she is also pregnant. Could Bev's father have a worse nightmare?Fran and Bev buddy up, sticking together through life's ""What have I done?"" moments...missing out on the prom, watching their friends go off to college, having babies together, and doing anything they can to make money and leave their small town.  They quickly realize their dreams of each giving birth to two girls( which they hope will grow up and be just like them), two pretty houses, and being best friends forever is not quite reality when there is no money, wandering husbands, and your water breaks.  ""How gross Mom!"" Bev shouts as real life intervenes.  -real life- Take 1.Drew plays a magnificent roll as a young mother who's character spans 20 years from the birth of her son. She is a convincing actress at every age.  While she may be a self-admitted irresponsible parent and make terrible life choices through the years, she is a good mother..despite the fact that she blames everyone, including her son for her misfortunes.I was particularly moved by the ending to this movie.

587685,A28ERDII8FZQQ9,B00005JKJS,J. Daniel,"[12, 14]","This wonderful movie by Director Penny Marshall asks the question: Are parents to blame for the wrong choices of their children?&quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot; involves wrong and right choices. Because the class &quot;Mr. Popular&quot; insults the class &quot;live wire&quot; consolation is given by the class &quot;drop-out&quot; and the &quot;live-wire&quot;, aptly played by Drew Barrymore is &quot;knocked up.&quot; What do you do about that in the late 1960's. You marry the class &quot;drop out&quot; and deal with the results usually unhappily.The results entail about 20 years of troubles, joys, disappointments, triumphs, and growing up experiences. This true story does not fail to satisfy. Barrymore is good, but so is James Woods as her caring but sometimes insensitive father (who may have saved himself a pile of troubles if he had just bought that bra she wanted for Christmas when she was 13.)It spans the live of Beverly Donofrio from age 15 to age 35. Drew Barrymore does a very good performance at all ages. I've never seen any of her other work compare to this performance.What we have here is a comedy-drama about relationships between parents and child and parent as child and child and best friends too. Touching and tender the movie is just right to bring back hilarious and not so funny memories of what it is like to and what happens to girls who go around, &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys.&quot; and, too, what it is like and what happens to boys who go aound &quot;Riding in Cars with...

After reading the ""critics"" I was expecting a rather cheesy tear-jerker with no heart or substance. Wrong, wrong, wrong...this one was a pleasant surprise, start to finish, and a totally charming movie.Based on the book of the same title, Riding in Cars with Boys is both heart-rending and humorous.  Drew Barrymore plays Beverly Donofrio, a youmg woman who becomes pregnant at 15 and is forced to live a life far different than what she'd hoped (or what her parents had hoped). James Woods is totally believable as her father, a man who tells Beverly she ""broke his heart"" when she became pregnant.But the real surprise here is the focus of the movie. Although supposedly the story of Beverly, the events are told from the point of view of her son and it is clear that her failures as a parent form much of the basis for this film. She is less than an ideal parent, resentful of her son's intrustion into her life and forced to cope with more than her share of hardships (her husband is a drug addict).As you can probably tell by now, this isn't exactly a family movie, so leave the kids at home.

Forced to put aside her dreams of college and becoming a writer, Beverly and Ray wed and then along comes Jason, their son.  Beverly finds herself still holding on to her dreams while trying to tame Ray into fatherhood and raise her baby boy.  Needless to say, the marriage does last but your children are always your children; thus the story focuses on Beverly and Jason.Anyone who has had a child at a young age, wed or unwed, can relate to this tale of lost dreams and life's struggles told from Jason's point of view.  Essentially, it is the tale of how young mothers and their offspring grow-up together; how they depend on and learn from one another.To me, the most touching part of this movie came with the confrontation between Beverly and grown-up Jason soon after Jason sees his father, Ray, after many years of absence from his life.

This one -Riding in Cars with Boys (Special Edition)- is one I saw some time ago.  I also read the book.  (After seeing the movie).Most writers can relate to someone who dreams of writing the way the character Beverly D'Onofrio does - it's kind of like breathing...you have to do it or else.Attaining her dream of a college education and writing that book take Bev (Drew Barrymore) longer than it does for the standard student - she has several obstacles, such as a teenage pregnancy - and in rearing her child alone (eventually), she flounders at times.  She is sidetracked by financial concerns as well.  But she never takes her eye off the prize.Steve Zahn plays her husband (soon to be ex), a heroin addict whose drug dependence almost pulls her down with him; Brittany Murphy plays her best friend and one-woman cheering squad.Coming from an Italian family with traditional values, it is surprising that Bev makes it at all, but, despite the family's initial shock and disappointment, her parents become very supportive.  This support helps keep her on track until she finally achieves her goals.  She finishes her book and finds a publisher - but not without some last-minute barriers that involve getting her ex-husband's ""waiver"" before the book can finally come to light.This is a good movie for New Year's Eve.

Not even a glimmer of ""It's not his fault that he was born.""Paradoxically, Drew Barrymore does a really great job of portraying an embittered and selfish young woman.I read once that Penny Marshall's motivation for the direction this movie takes was to avoid glamorizing teen pregnancy in any way. I think it's safe to say she's done that in spades, but she could have done that with a more tolerable protagonist.Such as, for example, reading the book it was based off of--now the author of that book did stupid stuff before and after her pregnancy, but eventually wakes up and realizes she can and should do better...for her kid and herself.

She reports in the book that she became pregnant at 17 rather than 15, as in the movie (and it's a little difficult accepting Drew Barrymore as a 15 year old.)Beverly wrote that she was a ""bad little Catholic girl"" and got herself into trouble in the old way that ""trouble"" was meant.  To make it worse, the father was an alcoholic drug addict.  As much as her own Catholic father disapproved of her unmarried pregnancy, he seems to disapprove of divorce even more after she's married the lug.Beverly's a smart girl, though, and one of the underlying themes of both the book and the movie are that she digs herself a hole that she climbs out of by virtue of her intelligence - specifically her ability to write the book about her life which became a bestseller.There is much angst.  As her son grows up she has not hidden from him her feelings that *HE* is the reason behind so much of her unhappiness.  (As if he chose his own conception and her teenaged pregnancy.)The real heart and soul of the movie is how these characters come to grips with their circumstances.  To say more would take away some of the pleasure.  James Woods is excellent as Beverly's disappointed father and Rosie Perez comes off as very convincing trailer trash as the current significant other of Beverly's first husband.  (As a side note I'm a little disappointed that Ms Perez doesn't get meatier roles - she was fantastic in ""White Men Can't Jump"" and I seem to see her cast over and over as a trashy woman who wants to get more than she's entitled to - as in this movie and ""It Could Happen To You"".)",4,Beverly D'Onofrio Saves Herself,1093996800,"09 1, 2004",2004,1663,"['Beverly', ""D'Onofrio"", 'wrote', 'book', 'based', 'life', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'became', 'pregnant', '17', 'rather', '15', 'movie', 'little', 'difficult', 'accepting', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Beverly', 'wrote', 'was', 'bad', 'little', 'Catholic', 'girl', 'got', 'trouble', 'old', 'way', 'trouble', 'was', 'meant', 'make', 'worse', 'father', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'drug', 'addict', 'As', 'much', 'own', 'Catholic', 'father', 'disapproved', 'unmarried', 'pregnancy', 'disapprove', 'divorce', 'even', 'more', 'married', 'lug.Beverly', 'smart', 'girl', 'one', 'underlying', 'themes', 'book', 'movie', 'are', 'hole', 'virtue', 'intelligence', 'specifically', 'ability', 'write', 'book', 'life', 'became', 'bestseller.There', 'much', 'angst', 'son', 'up', 'not', 'hidden', 'feelings', '*HE*', 'reason', 'so', 'much', 'unhappiness', 'chose', 'own', 'conception', 'teenaged', 'pregnancy', 'real', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'how', 'characters', 'come', 'grips', 'circumstances', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'pleasure', 'James', 'Woods', 'excellent', 'Beverly', 'disappointed', 'father', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'off', 'very', 'convincing', 'trailer', 'trash', 'current', 'significant', 'other', 'Beverly', 'first', 'husband', 'side', 'note', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'Ms', 'Perez', ""n't"", 'get', 'meatier', 'roles', 'was', 'fantastic', 'White', 'Men', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Jump', 'seem', 'see', 'cast', 'over', 'trashy', 'woman', 'who', 'get', 'more', 'entitled', 'movie', 'Could', 'Happen']",Riding in Cars with Boys

That's how good this movie is, you'll want to find out more about Beverley Donofrio, who wrote the book, and helped with the movie too.Drew Barrymore is an excellent actress, and she played the part of 'Bev' over a 20 year period really well. Although Drew makes a very doubtful 15/16 year old, she's more convincing throughout the rest of the movie. The movie is just one big laugh/cry, and you'll laugh at Steve Zahn's zany performance and cry at all the sad bits.Brittany Murphy also appears as Bev's best friend 'Fay' who also manages to get pregnant at the same time, and ends up a single mom. Brittany can really turn her hand at anything, and comes out with some hilarious lines. The one that sticks in everyone's memory is when she pretends to be Bev's parents when she confesses she's pregnant! ""My daughter's a tramp!"" During one of the scenes with Bev and Fay ""The End of the World"" is playing. This is the song that Brittany Murphy's character has playing during a key moment in Girl, Interrupted. The wedding scene was shot over a two day period, which required Brittany to cry the entire time. The first take was the one used in the film. It would have been nice for Brittany to appear towards the end of the movie, particularly as Jason is running off to be with Amelia. Instead, she just gets a mention.I wasn't particularly fussed about Adam Garcia playing Bev's 20 year old son, Jason in this. He was quite wrong for the part, considering he looks a lot older than the 20 year old he was supposed to be playing. But what was funny was the fact that Adam (who was 27 playing a 20 year old) was actually 2 years older than Drew (who was 25 playing a 35 year old) who played his mother! How weird is that!I can't wait to read about Beverley's experiences in the book. Apparently, only some ideas were used from the book - and they made Bev fall pregnant at 15, instead of 17 as it is in the book. The real life Beverly has a master's degree in creative writing. Drew is a high school dropout. The real Beverly and Jason D'Onofrio appear in the movie as guests at Beverly's wedding. They can be seen sitting directly behind Barrymore in the wedding scene. Apparently, what also is said in the book is that Beverly's parents did not force her to get married, they encouraged her to live with them so they could help support the baby instead of getting married. In the book, her parents were NOT supportive of her dream to go to college, which was a big part of the book that was left out. It was also Beverly's excuse for getting pregnant.Look out for Maggie Gyllenhaal in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her scene as Jason's girlfriend, Amelia, who was Fay's daughter; Desmond Harrington as Bobby and Logan Lerman as Jason (Age 8), who was also in The Butterfly Effect playing Evan at 7.At the end of the movie, and in parts throughout, it shows that Bev is now 36, and has written a book about her experiences. However, we never get to see how she managed to do this, and break away from all the bad things, which would have been good to see.This movie is getting some bad reviews, although I wouldn't believe them. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, sure, but guys, if you're gonna complain just cos your girlfriend dragged you to see this (like one reviewer has said) don't say that in the review. Believe me, you'll be single before you know it. Watch this movie.",4,"""I'm 22, that's nearly 30!""

No, this isn't all drama, which tends to lend to its authenticity. Life definitely has its quirky moments.

587705,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00005JKJS,Mike,"[2, 2]","""Riding in Cars with Boys"" (2001)About the only thing that attracted me to see Riding in Cars with Boys was the fact that I had seen every other movie at the theatre and my friends all wanted to see it. While I was expecting another melodramatic and boring ""woman-finds-strength"" movie, I was actually quite surprised by the quality and emotion involved in this movie.What really ""drives"" Riding in Cars with Boys, so to speak, is the amazing performance delivered by the cast. As I predicted from the previews, Drew Barrymore gives a brilliant portrayal of a confused and dreamy mother who does everything wrong but gets everything right (yes, that was the tagline). Barrymore proves to us she is maturing as an actress and it is surprising how well Barrymore carries this heavy drama. Steve Zahn, not an actor I know much about, but definitely enjoy watching, gives a heartbreaking and intriguing performance as the confused, stupid but totally in love husband. Zahn's scenes with Barrymore are very existent and believable. James Woods was neat and emotional in a supporting role, and Brittany Murphy is growing on me more every day... P>Morgan Ward's adaptation of Beverly Donofrio's fantastic biography is impressive. Ward keeps the pace up and the shocks come at good timing. This is not a nice little Barrymore movie either, it deals with themes such as drugs, sex, disappointment and adulthood in general. That surprised me highly. Anyway, Ward's script has a deep sadness to its story about a woman to wants to break free but has continuous boundaries she can't cross. The story also incorporates many funny moments, romantic back-stories and interesting and involving plot points to keep the audience enthralled with Donofrio's life.The movie does have some minor problems. I did find it a tad cheesy and sentimental in parts, and some of the scenes are sort of replayed in a different setting. I also felt quite disappointed with the ending, I wanted to see a bit more of the after-life, but these problems don't ruin the movie or anything.

587707,A3RINLIDX74QLP,B00005JKJS,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""","[7, 7]","I honestly wasn't expecting to be totally blown away by this movie. It didn't create much hype in theaters, and I only rented it now for two reasons - a friend recommended it, and I'm a fan of Drew Barrymore, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did, as I absolutely loved it. Based on the life of Beverly Donofrio, as written in her memoir (which I haven't read, and cannot compare the movie to), this film tells the story of a girl who gets pregnant at the age of fifteen. Through a series of flashbacks and narration by Donofrio's adult son, we see her struggle to raise her child while still growing up herself. She is determined to make a life for herself against all odds. And oh what odds they are!Guilted by her father into marrying the boyfriend who knocked her up, Beverly finds herself with a loving yet dim-bulb husband. He drinks excessively, routinely forgets things he should have remembered, shows up for work only when he feels like it, and ultimately succumbs to a drug addiction. Meanwhile, Beverly is estranged from her own parents, particularly her father, and is all alone save for her one loyal best friend. And when her friend is forced to move away, Beverly has only her son. And she was certainly not the best of mothers. When the tag line says &quot;She did everything wrong,&quot; it's no joke. But somehow the two of them are able to keep going, and Donofrio's story turns into one of the most inspirational and heartwarming I have ever seen.The entire cast was excellent, but Drew Barrymore was simply amazing. She must portray Beverly from the age of fifteen all the way up through thirty-six (a decade younger and a decade older than Barrymore herself at the time), and she does it beautifully. At each stage of the film, she nails down all the little nuances that define that partcular age. I think this is one of Barrymore's very best performances. Brittany Murphy also shines as Faye, Beverly's best friend. The two of them are a perfect match. Steve Zahn does an exceptional job as Ray, the husband. He manages to add a great sensitivity to his otherwise deadbeat character. Adam Garcia turns in a moving performance as the grown son, and James Woods does an excellent job as the father who truly does love the daughter who so disappointed him.The whole film has a great realism to it that is touching. These are real people. They have flaws, and make mistakes. Boy do they make mistakes! But we can relate to them, because we've all made mistakes. Donofrio's ability to keep going, to pick herself up and keep striding forward until she makes something of her life is truly inspirational. And not only that, but there is a real humor to the film. Through all her mistakes, Donofrio is able to laugh at the absurdity of it all, and I think this is a large part of what got her through.The DVD also has some nice extra features. In addition to audio commentary by Drew Barrymore, there is an HBO &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette in which we meet the real Donofrio and learn how her story was transfered onto film, and are given further insight into Donofrio's own life. There are also featurettes on the cars in the movie, the set for the house where Beverly and her son lived, and Donofrio's relationship with her son, as well as the theatrical trailers. This is a great story, and is executed to perfection. Even the soundtrack adds depth and feeling to the film. I'd highly recommend the movie to anyone, and intend to add it to my own collection.",5,"A moving story of mistakes, consequences, and perseverance.",1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,3491,"['honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'be', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'create', 'much', 'hype', 'theaters', 'only', 'rented', 'now', 'two', 'reasons', 'friend', 'recommended', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Based', 'life', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'written', 'memoir', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'movie', 'film', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'pregnant', 'age', 'fifteen', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'narration', 'Donofrio', 'adult', 'son', 'see', 'struggle', 'raise', 'child', 'still', 'growing', 'up', 'herself', 'determined', 'make', 'life', 'odds', 'oh', 'what', 'are', 'Guilted', 'father', 'marrying', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'knocked', 'up', 'Beverly', 'loving', 'yet', 'dim-bulb', 'husband', 'excessively', 'routinely', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'remembered', 'up', 'work', 'only', 'when', 'ultimately', 'succumbs', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Meanwhile', 'Beverly', 'estranged', 'own', 'parents', 'particularly', 'father', 'alone', 'save', 'one', 'loyal', 'best', 'friend', 'when', 'friend', 'forced', 'move', 'away', 'Beverly', 'only', 'son', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'mothers', 'When', 'tag', 'line', 'quot', 'did', 'everything', 'wrong', 'quot', 'joke', 'somehow', 'two', 'are', 'able', 'keep', 'going', 'Donofrio', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'inspirational', 'heartwarming', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'simply', 'amazing', 'must', 'portray', 'Beverly', 'age', 'fifteen', 'way', 'up', 'thirty-six', 'decade', 'younger', 'decade', 'older', 'Barrymore', 'herself', 'time', 'beautifully', 'stage', 'film', 'down', 'little', 'nuances', 'define', 'partcular', 'age', 'think', 'one', 'Barrymore', 'very', 'best', 'performances', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'also', 'Faye', 'Beverly', 'best', 'friend', 'two', 'are', 'perfect', 'match', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'exceptional', 'job', 'Ray', 'husband', 'add', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'otherwise', 'deadbeat', 'character', 'Adam', 'Garcia', 'moving', 'performance', 'grown', 'son', 'James', 'Woods', 'excellent', 'job', 'father', 'who', 'truly', 'love', 'daughter', 'who', 'so', 'disappointed', 'him.The', 'whole', 'film', 'great', 'realism', 'touching', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'flaws', 'make', 'mistakes', 'Boy', 'do', 'make', 'mistakes', 'can', 'relate', ""'ve"", 'made', 'mistakes', 'Donofrio', 'ability', 'keep', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'keep', 'striding', 'forward', 'something', 'life', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'humor', 'film', 'mistakes', 'Donofrio', 'able', 'laugh', 'absurdity', 'think', 'large', 'part', 'what', 'got', 'through.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'nice', 'extra', 'features', 'addition', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'HBO', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'featurette', 'meet', 'real', 'Donofrio', 'learn', 'how', 'story', 'was', 'transfered', 'film', 'are', 'given', 'further', 'insight', 'Donofrio', 'own', 'life', 'are', 'also', 'cars', 'movie', 'set', 'house', 'where', 'Beverly', 'son', 'lived', 'Donofrio', 'relationship', 'son', 'as', 'well', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'great', 'story', 'executed', 'perfection', 'Even', 'soundtrack', 'depth', 'feeling', 'film', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'intend', 'add', 'own', 'collection']",Riding in Cars with Boys

Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 0]","With true life stories you pretty much always know that you're probably going to be in for something a little bit cloying (exceptions being 'Heavenly Creatures' and 'Hilary And Jackie'), and this is often the case with this movie.  It stars Drew Barrymore as Beverly Donofrio, a woman who finds herself pregnant at fifteen by her good-for-nothing boyfriend Steve Zahn.  Her hopes of a bright future at NYU are crushed as she finds herself babysitting and changing diapers rather than working her way out of the smalltown life that she despises.We're in soap territory here and little really sets it aside from any other such made-for-TV movies apart from the stars, all of whom are spot on.  Barrymore again proves what a luminous actress she can be in a highly unsympathetic role where she plays someone who is not only self-obsessed but condescending of her very upbringing.  In addition, Zahn is one of the best new actors to have made himself known in a long time, as he manages to bring laughs alongside his disturbing portrayal of drug addiction.  There's also Brittany Murphy, an emerging young talent that should be given all the credit she deserves.However, if any movie is testament to the fact that the stars don't always make the film then this is it.  Apart from good (some may say brave) characterisation, especially of Beverly herself, this is something that aims to get the hankies out before the credits roll up and doesn't hide it.  There are several particularly cloying moments where we get a summary on love and the like and it is likely that some will find the lines given to Beverly's child completely unrealistic, bratty and irksome.

Sometimes Beverly got the feeling that her son was pulling her down more than he was uplifting and helping her, but by the end of the film, Beverly realizes that even though it was hard, Jason's birth was probably one of the best things to happen in her life.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a good, heartwarming, intelligent film with a great cast and great acting.

Though I was a little confused in the begining to how old she was.  Not until it was revealed that she was riding with her son and not a boyfriend did the clouds finally part-though it was pretty laughable given Drew Barrymore didn't even look twenty-five herself next to her ""son"".  However, for the most part, this film was interesting but I'm unclear the point of this journey.  When Bev gives the speech about how her son saved her, I'm not sure I believed her or believed that she believed it.  When did this revealation occur to her?

587713,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JKJS,Reviewer,"[7, 7]","The choices we make, the paths we choose and the way we live with those decisions is what makes up this thing called Life; and there are two ways to go at that point-- face up to what has happened-- what you've done-- and make the most of it, or spend the rest of your life feeling sorry for yourself and bemoaning the fact that ""they"" were the ones responsible for where you ended up.  And in ""Riding In Cars With Boys,"" directed by Penny Marshall, Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who walks that constantly narrowing fence of decision, slips up (as so many of us do!) and spends the rest of her life dealing with it.  The burning question:  Where will she place the blame; on herself?  Or on someone else--anyone-- perhaps even an innocent party, in an attempt to transfer that burden of lost hopes and dreams?  Ultimately, it becomes a matter of how you deal with the next decision in the wake of a bad one, which in the final analysis is the most important; because therein lies the true nature of one's character.Fifteen-year-old Beverly (Barrymore) is a smart kid, with aspirations of one day attending NYU and becoming a writer.  But it's 1965, she's not exactly the center of popularity and she has a crush on one of the varsity jocks who, of course, doesn't know she's alive.  But at a party one night, she musters up the courage to approach him; suffice to say, it does not go well.  As fate would have it, however (and, oh, fate will have it's way!), a drop-out named Ray (Steve Zahn) is on hand, sees what's happening and becomes her champion for the night.  And it's the night that changes her life forever.  As Pink Floyd once said, ""One slip, and down the hole we fall--""  And the real question becomes, once you're down that hole, what are you going to do about it?From a screenplay by Morgan Upton Ward, adapted from the novel ""Riding In Cars With Boys,"" by Beverly D'Onofrio, Penny Marshall delivers an affecting, and often poignant drama that addresses, not only the choices with which Beverly was faced, but makes a penetrating observation about the generation and era that so affected her decisions, as well.  The reaction of her police officer father, Leonard (James Woods), to her dilemma, for example, gives a context to the story that is most telling.  And it points up how so often ""where"" you are and ""when"" you are makes all the difference in the world, as far as how and why decisions are made, and moreover, how those decisions are perceived by others.  Marshall does an excellent job of presenting Beverly's story, lending a subtle, objective perspective to it that is effective and thought provoking.  She captures the period extremely well, sets a good pace and knows how to extract the kind of performances from her actors that makes it all work.  Additionally, most of the action takes place in the `60s, but is being viewed from 1986, and Marshall makes the transitions between the two time periods flawless.As Beverly, Drew Barrymore gives one of her best performances ever, creating a three dimensional character in which she captures and successfully conveys all the complexities of the individual, as well as the situations in which she finds herself.  She presents Beverly as intelligent, as a young woman coping with the consequences of a situation brought about by her own design who accepts the responsibility of her own actions, but who struggles against consciously placing the blame on others-- which is a quite natural tenet of human nature.  And the fact that Barrymore does not play her as a victim is a key element in the success of this film; it adds a depth to the character that makes Beverly entirely real and convincing.  It's a performance shaded with subtle tone and nuance, and most importantly, Barrymore fine tunes the various emotional levels of her character to a perfect pitch, hitting just the right note in any given situation, and it makes the story credible, and what she does believable.Also rising to the occasion with a terrific, memorable performance is Steve Zahn, as the hapless Ray.  This is a character who, even though based on a real person, could have easily fallen into caricature; but Zahn makes him real by getting into his skin and using the little things-- a glance, an expression, a reaction-- that gives Ray that necessary depth to make him convincing.  This is a guy you can feel for without necessarily liking; a guy you can admire for his innate humanness, but hate for his very human flaws.  It's a performance that is especially effective in the quiet, reflective moments, when you can actually see-- almost feel-- Ray's diminished mental capacity.  You can see it in his eyes; that pitiful, hopeless attempt to process information, but failing miserably because it is simply beyond the capacity of the facilities with which he was born.  And by establishing that cerebral chasm that exists between Ray and Beverly, it illuminates their basic differences and puts their whole situation-- especially Beverly's-- into succinct perspective.  And Zahn's performance is in no small part responsible for bringing that contrast to light, and making it work.Also turning in noteworthy performances are Adam Garcia, as Jason, and Brittany Murphy, as Beverly's best friend, Fay.  The additional supporting cast includes Lorraine Bracco (Theresa D'Onofrio), Rosie Perez (Shirley), Peter Facinelli (Tommy), Sara Gilbert (Christina) and Jordan Gelber (Kevin).  An insightful film that says much about individual capacity and the tenacity of the human spirit, ""Riding In Cars With Boys"" is well crafted and delivered entertainment that will be a transporting experience for some, while perhaps providing some guidance and inspiration to others.  In the end, it's a thoughtful, heart-felt meditation on life; a gift to all of us through the magic of the movies.",4,Outstanding Work by Barrymore and Zahn,1020902400,"05 9,

Drew Barrymore does an excellent job as Beverly, though her accent sometimes gets in the way and distracts.  Brittany Murpy is wonderful as her best friend Fay.....Murpy has been up to a lot lately and getting better and better as she goes.  The child actors that play Beverly's sons, Jason, are absolutely terrific and a joy to watch.  Steve Zahn plays her husband Ray, and he makes this character lovable, yet hateable at the same time, as Ray prevents Beverly from becoming what she truly wants at every turn.  But Beverly's character isn't that lovable at times either, as you see her not being the best mother to Jason.  It's fun to watch the time go by from the '60s to the '80s and how the characters change and grow with the passing years.

I also love some of Penny Marshall's films, most notably BIG, in which she displayed just the right light touch with the sentimental material.  However, these two formidable forces notwithstanding, this movie is a bloated mess.  Waaaaay too long, the painfully over-the-top diatribes mouthed by virtually all of the characters almost never sound real, especially as spoken by the young children.  Nearly every scene features the aforementioned cars, with boys (or fathers or boyfriends or...), and nearly every scene works for sudsy, soapy tears.  There is much more attention spent on the art direction of the sets, with their period-perfect detail, than there is on the formation of real characters.  The most unfortunate thing here is that the nugget of the supposedly &quot;true&quot; story has some genuine emotional weight -- that of a too-young woman caught at the wrong time in history to become pregnant at age 15.  Even so, it's ground that's been tread before, and much more deftly than it is here.  The film features a number of evocative pop tunes and a truly terrible new-age rhythmic backbeat of a score by Hans Zimmer.  The two stars are for Drew and for Steven Zahn, both of whom shine through some of the more painful moments with surprising depth.",2,C'MON....,1004313600,"10 29, 2001",2001,1363,"['love', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'warm', 'radiant', 'smart', 'genuinely', 'unique', 'screen', 'presence', 'also', 'love', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'films', 'most', 'notably', 'BIG', 'displayed', 'just', 'right', 'light', 'touch', 'sentimental', 'material', 'However', 'two', 'formidable', 'forces', 'notwithstanding', 'movie', 'bloated', 'mess', 'Waaaaay', 'too', 'long', 'painfully', 'over-the-top', 'diatribes', 'mouthed', 'virtually', 'characters', 'almost', 'never', 'sound', 'real', 'especially', 'spoken', 'young', 'children', 'Nearly', 'scene', 'aforementioned', 'cars', 'boys', 'fathers', 'boyfriends', 'nearly', 'scene', 'sudsy', 'soapy', 'tears', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'spent', 'art', 'direction', 'sets', 'period-perfect', 'detail', 'formation', 'real', 'characters', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'here', 'nugget', 'supposedly', 'quot', 'true', 'quot', 'story', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'weight', 'too-young', 'woman', 'caught', 'wrong', 'time', 'history', 'become', 'pregnant', 'age', '15', 'Even', 'so', 'ground', 'been', 'tread', 'before', 'much', 'more', 'deftly', 'here', 'film', 'number', 'evocative', 'pop', 'tunes', 'truly', 'terrible', 'new-age', 'rhythmic', 'backbeat', 'score', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'Drew', 'Steven', 'Zahn', 'whom', 'shine', 'more', 'painful', 'moments', 'surprising', 'depth']",Riding in Cars with Boys

While Ms. Barrymore may not be a good actress, she has a charm and charisma that make her worth watching. Most of the time.I honestly can't imagine who Riding in Cars with Boys will appeal to. I haven't read the book it's based on, so I'll be talking only about the characters, as portrayed in the movie. Barrymore's Beverly Donofrio is a horrendous, self-centered, self-important idiot, that makes the movie virtually unbearable to watch. She makes stupid choices, she blames others for her misfortune. She treats her child like a burden, she's a terrible mother, and basically, spends her time wondering why the world isn't willing to kowtow to her will, and make her life the Beverley-centric paradise she thinks it should be.That, in itself, makes the movie nigh-unbearable, but the various twists and turns the movie goes through, as well as the pathetically trite and inane resolution to the whole mother-son relationship is so gut-wrenchingly insipid that if I had paid to see this in the theater, I'd have thrown my soda at the screen and walked out. Something I'd never even *considered* before in my entire life.Maybe there's something that I'm missing. There seem to be a decent number of people who actually *like* this movie, but for the life of me, I can't figure out why.If you like human drama, if you like stories about *people*, then you'll probably hate this movie. As hard as it tries to be about something, about some redemption in this person's life - it's simply not. It's two hours of watching a vapid idiot whine about how life has screwed her over, then it ends with a nice little (and yet entirely nonsensical) sprinkle of sugar, that only serves to show us what a bitter and vile movie we just wasted the last two hours of our life on.I'd sell this disc, just to get it out of my collection, but that would mean someone else would probably end up watching it, and frankly, I'm just not that cruel a person.",1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,1024444800,"06 19, 2002",2002,2079,"['do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'go', 'way', 'see', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'tagging', 'GF', 'few', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'Ms.', 'Barrymore', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'actress', 'charm', 'charisma', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'Most', 'time.I', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'who', 'Riding', 'Cars', 'Boys', 'will', 'appeal', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'based', ""'ll"", 'be', 'talking', 'only', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'Barrymore', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'horrendous', 'self-centered', 'self-important', 'idiot', 'movie', 'virtually', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'stupid', 'choices', 'others', 'misfortune', 'child', 'burden', 'terrible', 'mother', 'basically', 'time', 'wondering', 'why', 'world', ""n't"", 'willing', 'kowtow', 'will', 'make', 'life', 'Beverley-centric', 'paradise', 'should', 'be.That', 'movie', 'nigh-unbearable', 'various', 'twists', 'movie', 'through', 'as', 'well', 'pathetically', 'trite', 'inane', 'resolution', 'whole', 'mother-son', 'relationship', 'so', 'gut-wrenchingly', 'insipid', 'had', 'paid', 'see', 'theater', ""'d"", 'have', 'thrown', 'soda', 'screen', 'walked', 'out', 'Something', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', '*considered*', 'entire', 'life.Maybe', 'something', ""'m"", 'missing', 'seem', 'be', 'decent', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'actually', '*like*', 'movie', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why.If', 'human', 'drama', 'like', 'stories', '*people*', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'hate', 'movie', 'As', 'hard', 'be', 'something', 'redemption', 'person', 'life', 'simply', 'not', 'two', 'hours', 'watching', 'vapid', 'idiot', 'whine', 'how', 'life', 'screwed', 'then', 'nice', 'little', 'yet', 'entirely', 'nonsensical', 'sprinkle', 'sugar', 'only', 'show', 'what', 'bitter', 'vile', 'movie', 'just', 'wasted', 'last', 'two', 'hours', 'life', ""'d"", 'sell', 'disc', 'just', 'get', 'collection', 'would', 'mean', 'someone', 'else', 'would', 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'person']",Riding in Cars with Boys

587722,A2VAISBX5T1SX8,B00005JKJS,SheLikesDVDs.com,"[3, 3]","A friend told me I would hate this movie. ""It was supposed to be funny,"" she said, ""but it was just awful. The character that Drew Barrymore plays is just a horrible, horrible mother.""And it's true. Bev Donofrio, the main character played by Barrymore and the woman who penned the memoirs behind this movie, is not a ""good"" mother. She's a real mother, who approaches much of her life from the same self-absorbed perspective that she had when she was 15 and became pregnant. She's dramatic, possessed of a sense of self-importance and smugness that would never put her in running for Mother of the Year. She has said horrible, heartless things to her baby boy and instilled him with the sense that his arrival ruined his mother's life. And yet she was able to raise him, build her life, and evolve-at least a smidge-into a better person.When children take on the role of adult in the parent-child relationship, the responsibilities of caregiving become blurred. That dynamic is at the heart of this film. Jason, Bev's son, recognizes early on that he has to take the burden of responsibility in their relationship. Bev is a teenager for the first five years of his life, locked into a marriage with the man who knocked her up. He's a sweet, charming, drug-using dunce who doesn't understand or support Bev's strident desire to get an education and change her life. Bev chose to marry him because of pressure from her own father, who rejects her for her mistakes and who is largely unable to show his love for her. She recreates the same relationship with her son, not realizing until the end of the movie that she has done so.But through it all, Bev remains a force of nature. She stumbled along in her self-absorbed way, but learned enough about how to see other people that she could understand her effect on the lives of others. The movie isn't so much about becoming the perfect mother, but more about finding a sense of self-acceptance and clarity, and sharing that enveloping sense of acceptance with the people who need to know you love them. It's comedic, dramatic, and scalding-a truthful, well-acted story of mothers, sons, fathers and daughters. I didn't hate this movie, as my friend predicted.

587723,A2RWHTNM5P3I8Y,B00005JKJS,Sheryl Katz,"[8, 12]","Once upon a time there was a rebellious, bright, funny, teenager named Beverly Donofrio.  She was trapped in a working class Catholic family in a suburban neighborhood in the 1960s, and the only way she could - in her befuddled and wrong-headed teenage way - figure out how to escape was to do what many other teens with underdeveloped judgment have done and will continue to do to get out - she got pregnant at 17, got married to a loser, and was divorced by 19.  She spent eight years on welfare, yet managed to raise her son, go to an elite eastern college, get a masters degree from Columbia, and become a successful writer.  She wrote a memoir that I consider a minor classic called ""Riding in Cars with Boys"" which signaled an important cultural shift in attitudes toward women, because it was the story of a ""bad"" girl who wasn't ashamed of it.  If this movie, which bears the title of that memoir, had retold the story told in that book, it could have been a great movie.Instead, what we get is a high concept TV movie of the week type story about ""babies having babies"" in which a 15 year old girl gets pregnant, marries the father who she's too dumb even to realize is a drug addict, stays married to him a number of years, develops a dysfunctional relationship with her son whom she is barely able to love, and ends up up being taken care of emotionally by her preppy, shallow ultimately emotionally confused son.  From everything I've seen in video interviews with Beverly Donofrio and her son, and from the book, and other articles I've read, this just isn't remotely her story or her character.I've read a lot of reviews that focus on how great Drew Barrymore was aging from15 to 35, and what a challenging role this was.  Well, I thought she did OK with the mess of a script and the character, but the script and character make no sense.  Why did she have to be 15?  In real life Beverly was pregnant at 17.  The real story is that Beverly  (who by all acccounts from life was  a loving if unconventional mother) managed, son in tow, to go to college and graduate school (not study for her GED - Beverly finished high school with her class) all the while on welfare (not working double shifts at the diner).  Why not tell that story - which is far more interesting than this silly moralistic tale - of the trials and failures of a teenage mother?  And if you remove the distracting framing device of having her confront her husband at 35, then you could have a role where the actress ages from 17 to 27, a lot less difficult to do.There is one superb performance in this movie, and that is Steve Zahn as the junkie husband and father.  But Drew Barrymore as Beverly Donofrio just seems to lack the edge, the funny, rebellious, in your face presence that Beverly Donofrio has.  I grew up with lots of bad girls just like her in an Italian neighborhood in the suburbs of a big city in the fifties and sixties.  Those girls had some real sass.  This girl portayed by Drew Barrymore just doesn't have that.  In fact, she seems too much like a ""nice"" girl and doesn't fit the situation.If you can set aside what this movie should have been and could have been and take it on its own terms, it is well made - the production values are good, the period evocations are effective, the settings are interesting, the use of cars as a character is well-done.  It's at least watchable on that level, and I also enjoyed the contribution by Lorraine Bracco as well as that of Steve Zahn (James Woods just gives me the creeps and I can't forget it in whatever role he's in).  I'm disappointed though that it's not a movie telling the story in the book.",3,Coulda Been a Contenda,1016928000,"03 24, 2002",2002,3651,"['Once', 'time', 'was', 'rebellious', 'bright', 'funny', 'teenager', 'named', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'was', 'trapped', 'working', 'class', 'Catholic', 'family', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', '1960s', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'befuddled', 'wrong-headed', 'teenage', 'way', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'escape', 'was', 'do', 'what', 'many', 'other', 'teens', 'underdeveloped', 'judgment', 'have', 'done', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'get', 'out', 'got', 'pregnant', '17', 'got', 'married', 'loser', 'was', 'divorced', '19', 'spent', 'eight', 'years', 'welfare', 'yet', 'managed', 'raise', 'son', 'go', 'elite', 'eastern', 'college', 'get', 'masters', 'degree', 'Columbia', 'become', 'successful', 'writer', 'wrote', 'memoir', 'consider', 'minor', 'classic', 'called', 'Riding', 'Cars', 'Boys', 'signaled', 'important', 'cultural', 'shift', 'attitudes', 'women', 'was', 'story', 'bad', 'girl', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'ashamed', 'movie', 'title', 'memoir', 'had', 'retold', 'story', 'told', 'book', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie.Instead', 'what', 'get', 'high', 'concept', 'TV', 'movie', 'week', 'type', 'story', 'babies', 'having', 'babies', '15', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'pregnant', 'father', 'who', 'too', 'dumb', 'even', 'realize', 'drug', 'addict', 'married', 'number', 'years', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'son', 'whom', 'barely', 'able', 'love', 'up', 'up', 'being', 'taken', 'care', 'emotionally', 'preppy', 'shallow', 'ultimately', 'emotionally', 'confused', 'son', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'video', 'interviews', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'son', 'book', 'other', 'articles', ""'ve"", 'read', 'just', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'story', 'character.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'focus', 'how', 'great', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'aging', 'from15', '35', 'what', 'challenging', 'role', 'was', 'Well', 'thought', 'did', 'mess', 'script', 'character', 'script', 'character', 'make', 'sense', 'Why', 'did', 'have', 'be', '15', 'real', 'life', 'Beverly', 'was', 'pregnant', '17', 'real', 'story', 'Beverly', 'who', 'acccounts', 'life', 'was', 'loving', 'unconventional', 'mother', 'managed', 'son', 'tow', 'go', 'college', 'graduate', 'school', 'not', 'study', 'GED', 'Beverly', 'finished', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'while', 'welfare', 'not', 'working', 'double', 'shifts', 'diner', 'Why', 'not', 'tell', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'silly', 'moralistic', 'tale', 'trials', 'failures', 'teenage', 'mother', 'remove', 'distracting', 'framing', 'device', 'having', 'confront', 'husband', '35', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'role', 'where', 'actress', '17', '27', 'lot', 'less', 'difficult', 'do.There', 'one', 'superb', 'performance', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'junkie', 'husband', 'father', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'just', 'lack', 'edge', 'funny', 'rebellious', 'face', 'presence', 'Beverly', 'Donofrio', 'grew', 'up', 'lots', 'bad', 'girls', 'just', 'Italian', 'neighborhood', 'suburbs', 'big', 'city', 'fifties', 'sixties', 'girls', 'had', 'real', 'sass', 'girl', 'portayed', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'fact', 'too', 'much', 'nice', 'girl', ""n't"", 'fit', 'situation.If', 'can', 'set', 'aside', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'take', 'own', 'terms', 'well', 'made', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'period', 'evocations', 'are', 'effective', 'settings', 'are', 'interesting', 'use', 'cars', 'character', 'well-done', 'least', 'watchable', 'level', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'contribution', 'Lorraine', 'Bracco', 'as', 'well', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'James', 'Woods', 'just', 'creeps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'role', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'not', 'movie', 'telling', 'story', 'book']",Riding in Cars with Boys

587725,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00005JKJS,S. Schell,"[1, 2]","One would think that the way the trailer for ""Riding in Cars With Boys"" is put together, you'd have a jolly old time watching it.  With Drew Barrymore heading the cast and Penny Marshall (A League of Their Own) directing, you've got even more reason to believe that you're in for a lighthearted and delightful feature.  For those prepared to rent this flick, plop down on their sofa with their popcorn, treats and soft drinks/beer and laugh it up, be warned - trailers can be VERY deceiving.By all accounts (and by my opinion only), ""Riding in Cars With Boys"" has to be the most humorless film I've seen in a while.  Sure, you say, ""the previews I've seen make it look pretty damn funny""...yet when one starts watching, they will gradually feel less enlightened and more despondent as events unfold.  For this movie to be categorized as a comedy is an error of grand proportion; it clearly belongs amongst the ranks of the drama genre, what with its story being based on the heart-wrenching autobiography of novelist Beverly D'Onofrio.The movie begins with a pre-teen Beverly unabashedly admitting to her policeman father Leonardo (Woods) that she ""can't wait to get breasts"", her desire to grow up far too tenacious.  Flash forward about three or four years to the throes of Beverly's adolescence - she is an aspiring novelist...with boobs.  Promptly jilted after soliciting the attentions of an arrogant jock at a rowdy house party, she retreats to an upstairs bathroom to let the tears of humiliation flow, unwittingly stumbling upon her future husband, a dim bulb named Ray Hasek (Zahn).  Ray becomes her personal hero when he beats the jock to a pulp and they later end up in a parked car with her best friend Fay (Murphy) and her boyfriend, laughing it up with cigarettes and booze.You can pretty much guess what happens at this point; with child at the age of 15 and no wedding ring on her finger to speak of, Beverly's father looks her dead in the eye after she confesses to her pregnancy and says gravely, ""You've ruined your life.""This is the movie's biggest understatement.At a loss of what to do, Beverly convinces herself that she is in love with Ray and decides to marry the brainless sperm donor, her wedding the most joyless celebration ever beheld.  To make matters worse, Fay confesses during a toast to the newlyweds that she is pregnant as well and the whole event becomes a festival of shame.The rest of the movie has Beverly trying like hell to make her dream as a novelist come true despite numerous hindrances.  It doesn't take long for this vicious cycle to get tiresome - watching Beverly fumble over and over again, try as she might, can make some people feel pretty frustrated (are you starting to get the picture?).  The film ends with her finally publishing her autobiography and making amends with her father, but don't mistake this for a happy ending - everything you've seen up to this point will more than convince you that this story is far from having a joyous denouement.The uplifting aspects are the performances of the movie's four leads (Barrymore, Zahn, Goldberg, Murphy).  I haven't been able to take Drew Barrymore seriously for a while regarding dramatic roles; after all, can you blame me for feeling this way when the most recent projects at the time crowding her extensive resume were ""Never Been Kissed"" and the overblown ""Charlie's Angels"" action films?  Watching her here, however, is a 180 turn - she conjures several emotional outbursts and is exceptional (this word is underlined, by the way).  Rarely have I seen such a fantastic outcome from her and this is what made me appreciate the movie most.  If you will see it for any reason, see it for Barrymore's finest performance yet.Ray is incorrigible and Steve Zahn does a flawless job.  However, a comedic actor of his skills needs to expand his horizons.  Brittany Murphy can't showcase even half of her gusto with the thankless role of Fay (half the time she looks like she's been chopping onions) and Sarah Gilbert is practically non-existent as Christine, her screen time amounting to no more than ten minutes.  This is the same girl who outshined everyone as the acerbic Darlene on the long-running TV sitcom ""Roseanne"" and she's relegated to the background.  She should be leading a film, not supporting it.Brash ""New-Yawker"" Lorraine Bracco can't sparkle either and James Woods, with what little he's got, manages to make Leonardo a delicate character - he's the only one out of the entire supporting cast to make a distinct impression.Bottom line: Though I feel personally that it is a mistake to tout this film as a comedy, it is nevertheless an affecting representation of D'Onofrio's struggle to overcome adversity.  If you're looking for a film that will give you a good laugh AND a good cry, ""Riding In Cars With Boys"" is a safe bet.",3,"Short On Humor, Long On Heartbreak",1228521600,"12 6,

If not, you'll probably just shake your head.  The problem with ""Riding in Cars with Boys"" isn't that it lacks charm or humor; the problem is that it suggests that charm and humor in a person should supplant good judgment, character and sensitivity--even when that person is responsible for someone else.  Drew Barrymore gives her standard perky performance as Beverly Donofrio, a headstrong girl who defies her blue-collar parents (James Woods and Lorraine Bracco in interesting bits) and quickly finds herself pregnant.  Opting for marriage to a soon-to-be-junky loser (played effectively by Steve Zahn), Bev struggles to get to college but not before developing an angry Martyr Complex about her son and dabbling in the drug trade.  The movie's flashback scenes between the now successful Bev and the brash young woman she once was are at times effective--she actually seems a bit smarter and more sensitive in her youth--but too often we're supposed to chuckle at her poor decisions rather than hold her responsible for them.  In fact, the film seems to dodge the tougher question of why we should care about Bev in the first place, as she simply drifts from one crisis to the next, especially when her now-grown son points out all of the psychological trauma being her son has caused.  I guess it's supposed to be all that nostalgic music and Bev's pluck or maybe that she's a single parent.  It's nice that things work out for her in the end--the film is apparently based on an autobiography--but viewers may be left with little sense that the character deserves success so much as fell into it.

587727,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKJS,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","I love Drew Barrymore, and this movie is good.  That should be the end of this review.  Or should have been.  I've been watching anything she is in, from ""Altered States"" to that dismally bad ""Freddy Got Fingered,"" and now this film came to Osaka yesterday.  Of course I went to the first show in the morning.The film turned out ... not so good.  This means, let me hurriedly say, that Drew Barrymore, who played the main  character, Beverley Donofrio, the writer of best-selling memoir of her life in turmoil, is so good; lovely bad-girl Drew, warmed my heart, with her sincere portrayal of the heroine's not-so-easy life-story.  She meets her future husband who later proves to be really attractive, but hopelessly irritating loser.  Being pregnant at the age of 15, Bev wishes to go to New York University, but instead ends up with raising her child (and a boy when she ""planned"" to have a girl), in her native town.But I said ""not good"" because, for all good acting, not least from this loser Steve Zahn, playing her husband with certain kind of charm -- yes, for all these good things, the film has too many faults by heavy-handed directions from Penny Marshall.  The light-hearted touch, I think, is the key to the sccuess of this type of film, if you look back at her previous career -- ""big"" ""Awakening"" and ""league of Their Own"" -- but instead, her way of guiding the whole story looks very clumsy; see, for example, too many flashbacks which deprives the film of the emotional involvement on the audience's side.  And some of the scenes just don't work, to illustrate, the one in which Bev's best friend Fay (Britterny Murphy, herself never better) sings the Shirelles hit song ""Soldier Boy"" for her boyfriend going to Vietnam.  Don't you think it's too obvious even if you know the song?But the best way to describe my point would be to check out the soundtrack, which includes in one party scene the songs by Sonny and Cher, James Brown, and Gerry and Pacemakers!  This incongruous combination surely is not fit for any occasion; though the material itself is good, the way of cooking (or arranging) is misguided.  Likewise, very often the film does not know how to tell its precious story, containing too many sketches of relations -- Bev and father, Bev and son, Bev and her best friend fay, and Bev and her husband.  I understand each story's value, but if the director had concentrated her narrative on three of them, not four, the result would be different.Again, the actors are all good though Adam Garcia from Australia just does not look like Bev's son, and Rosie Perez should have declined the role she had played many times before.  But OK, I stop complaining, because there are lots of good things, too.  The costumes and production designs are perfect, capturing the the atomosphere of the 1960s and 70s which is going to fade away now from our memories.  And when the director doesn't rely on cloying sentiments, the film delivers what it should with its good story and characters, especially the heart-felt relations between Bev and the people surrounding her.It is certain that the last scene with Drew Barrymore and James Woods as her father together singing Everley Brothers' song is the best part of the film, which alone deserves to be seen.  You many hate this term, but this is a real tear-jerker, and a good one at that.  And what's wrong with that?  No.  I say, I love it, but I just felt that the film, like its wordy title, takes a too long ride to reach there.",3,Splendid Drew (No Doubt about it!!) with a Weak Storytelling,1021766400,"05 19, 2002",2002,3498,"['love', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'movie', 'good', 'should', 'be', 'end', 'review', 'should', 'have', 'been', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'anything', 'Altered', 'States', 'dismally', 'bad', 'Freddy', 'Got', 'Fingered', 'now', 'film', 'came', 'Osaka', 'yesterday', 'course', 'went', 'first', 'show', 'morning.The', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'let', 'hurriedly', 'say', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'played', 'main', 'character', 'Beverley', 'Donofrio', 'writer', 'best-selling', 'memoir', 'life', 'turmoil', 'so', 'good', 'lovely', 'bad-girl', 'Drew', 'warmed', 'heart', 'sincere', 'portrayal', 'heroine', 'not-so-easy', 'life-story', 'future', 'husband', 'who', 'later', 'be', 'really', 'attractive', 'hopelessly', 'irritating', 'loser', 'Being', 'pregnant', 'age', '15', 'Bev', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'University', 'instead', 'up', 'raising', 'child', 'boy', 'when', 'planned', 'have', 'girl', 'native', 'town.But', 'said', 'not', 'good', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'least', 'loser', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'playing', 'husband', 'certain', 'kind', 'charm', 'yes', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'faults', 'heavy-handed', 'directions', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'light-hearted', 'touch', 'think', 'key', 'sccuess', 'type', 'film', 'look', 'back', 'previous', 'career', 'big', 'Awakening', 'league', 'Their', 'Own', 'instead', 'way', 'guiding', 'whole', 'story', 'very', 'clumsy', 'see', 'example', 'too', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'audience', 'side', 'scenes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'illustrate', 'one', 'Bev', 'best', 'friend', 'Fay', 'Britterny', 'Murphy', 'never', 'better', 'Shirelles', 'hit', 'song', 'Soldier', 'Boy', 'boyfriend', 'going', 'Vietnam', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'obvious', 'even', 'know', 'song', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'check', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'party', 'scene', 'songs', 'Sonny', 'Cher', 'James', 'Brown', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'incongruous', 'combination', 'surely', 'not', 'fit', 'occasion', 'material', 'good', 'way', 'cooking', 'arranging', 'misguided', 'Likewise', 'very', 'often', 'film', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'tell', 'precious', 'story', 'containing', 'too', 'many', 'sketches', 'relations', 'Bev', 'father', 'Bev', 'son', 'Bev', 'best', 'friend', 'fay', 'Bev', 'husband', 'understand', 'story', 'value', 'director', 'had', 'concentrated', 'narrative', 'three', 'not', 'four', 'result', 'would', 'be', 'different.Again', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'Adam', 'Garcia', 'Australia', 'just', 'not', 'look', 'Bev', 'son', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'should', 'have', 'declined', 'role', 'had', 'played', 'many', 'times', 'OK', 'stop', 'complaining', 'are', 'lots', 'good', 'things', 'too', 'costumes', 'production', 'designs', 'are', 'perfect', 'capturing', 'atomosphere', '1960s', '70s', 'going', 'fade', 'away', 'now', 'memories', 'when', 'director', ""n't"", 'rely', 'cloying', 'sentiments', 'film', 'what', 'should', 'good', 'story', 'characters', 'especially', 'heart-felt', 'relations', 'Bev', 'people', 'surrounding', 'her.It', 'certain', 'last', 'scene', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'James', 'Woods', 'father', 'together', 'singing', 'Everley', 'Brothers', 'song', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'alone', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'hate', 'term', 'real', 'tear-jerker', 'good', 'one', 'what', 'wrong', 'say', 'love', 'just', 'felt', 'film', 'wordy', 'title', 'too', 'long', 'ride', 'reach', 'there']",Riding in Cars with Boys

I could completely relate to Beverly's terror, guilt, despair, and struggles, as well as her unwavering commitment to her son, mistakes and all. I could relate to the working-class lifestyle, the penniless times, and feeling like I'd lost my own youth (I love the exchange where young Jason shouts ""I never get to play!"" and Bev fires back with ""Neither do I!""). I love the realistic touches from beginning to end, the awkward family exchanges, the wayward yet lovable best friend, the clumsy first romance, the cycles of despair and hope as life moves along. Barrymore is fantastic at every turn, she is convincing as a bright-eyed, naive 15 year old AND as a weary, struggling 30-something mom.

587729,A18M68DE1Y6W51,B00005JKJS,Wendy Kaplan,"[2, 2]","I never really thought of Drew Barrymore as a gifted actress, despite her famous name. After watching this movie, however, I stand happily corrected.With pathos, humor, sadness and rage--all without the histrionics of a lesser actress--Drew plays a brainy teenager with high aspirations who becomes accidentally pregnant by a boy she doesn't love in 1963. Since &quot;free love&quot; had not yet entered America's consciousness as an option, let alone a catch phrase, Drew's character has only one decent option: Marry the baby's father. In a comic scene laced with tears, Drew is brilliant as the unwilling bride, 15 years old, but already wise beyond her years as she faces a future of motherhood and a loveless marriage. Things get better when her dearest friend Fay gets accidentally pregnant as well, and for 9 months, at least, the two can be giggly teenagers again, sure they will each have girls who in turn will grow up as best friends. The fantasy ends when Drew's character gives birth to a boy--and real life begins.During the hellish years of her marriage, as the young woman struggles to raise her son and keep her head above water while her husband becomes addicted to heroin and alcohol, she never loses sight of her ultimate goal: to finish high school and go to college. The scene where she interviews for a scholarship while her young son slowly but surely spoils her chances, is a masterpiece.The film ends when Drew's character is 35, and her son (Andy Garcia, just wonderful) is 20. Will either of them ever be happy? Will Mom be able to let go and let her son live his life without guilt? Will she live up to her own high aspirations? The answer may be pat, but very, very pleasing. As always, Penny Marshall does a superb job of directing a story that could easily have fallen into a mushy tearjerker--but didn't. I recommend the film highly, and I applaud Drew Barrymore for a truly magnificent effort.",4,Drew Grows Up,1037059200,"11 12, 2002",2002,1927,"['never', 'really', 'thought', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'gifted', 'actress', 'famous', 'name', 'watching', 'movie', 'however', 'stand', 'happily', 'corrected.With', 'pathos', 'humor', 'sadness', 'rage', 'histrionics', 'lesser', 'actress', 'Drew', 'brainy', 'teenager', 'high', 'aspirations', 'who', 'becomes', 'accidentally', 'pregnant', 'boy', ""n't"", 'love', '1963', 'quot', 'free', 'love', 'quot', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'entered', 'America', 'consciousness', 'option', 'let', 'alone', 'catch', 'phrase', 'Drew', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'decent', 'option', 'Marry', 'baby', 'father', 'comic', 'scene', 'laced', 'tears', 'Drew', 'brilliant', 'unwilling', 'bride', '15', 'years', 'old', 'already', 'wise', 'years', 'future', 'motherhood', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Things', 'get', 'better', 'when', 'dearest', 'friend', 'Fay', 'accidentally', 'pregnant', 'well', '9', 'months', 'least', 'two', 'can', 'be', 'giggly', 'teenagers', 'again', 'sure', 'will', 'have', 'girls', 'who', 'turn', 'will', 'grow', 'up', 'best', 'friends', 'fantasy', 'when', 'Drew', 'character', 'birth', 'boy', 'real', 'life', 'begins.During', 'hellish', 'years', 'marriage', 'young', 'woman', 'raise', 'son', 'keep', 'head', 'water', 'husband', 'becomes', 'addicted', 'heroin', 'alcohol', 'never', 'sight', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'finish', 'high', 'school', 'go', 'college', 'scene', 'where', 'scholarship', 'young', 'son', 'slowly', 'surely', 'chances', 'masterpiece.The', 'film', 'when', 'Drew', 'character', '35', 'son', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'just', 'wonderful', '20', 'Will', 'ever', 'be', 'happy', 'Will', 'Mom', 'be', 'able', 'let', 'go', 'let', 'son', 'live', 'life', 'guilt', 'Will', 'live', 'up', 'own', 'high', 'aspirations', 'answer', 'may', 'be', 'pat', 'very', 'very', 'pleasing', 'always', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'superb', 'job', 'directing', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'fallen', 'mushy', 'tearjerker', 'did', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'applaud', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'effort']",Riding in Cars with Boys
