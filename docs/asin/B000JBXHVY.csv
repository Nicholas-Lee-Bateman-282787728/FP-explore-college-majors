1025907,A1PEIYVBP09WGU,B000JBXHVY,"B. Massey ""George""","[13, 15]","Despite me searching the net for years just to find even a few episodes of Captain N, bagging some chewed up videos, placing orders from dodgy sites that never arrived, obtaining nasty pirate copies and fake DVD's that barely worked, they've finally decided to release the series on DVD. And although I would have liked it to have been sooner, I suppose that it couldn't really have come at a much better time than this.For those that don't know, the N in Captain N, stands for Nintendo, and seeing as Nintendo have swiftly restored their rightful place on the top spot of the video game world with the DS and the Wii, this show once again has a place.The series, started in around 1991 was based around a kid called Kevin who got sucked through his Nes while playing Mike Tyson's Punch out, and found himself in Videoland, with the nes pad on his belt and the lightgun to get him through different worlds. His N team consisted of famous characters from Nes games such as Megaman, Kid Icarus and Simon Belmont from Castlevania. Seeing as the Wii has a device that allows you to download many of these old games, the series will make sense to even new generations of game players.Anyway, at the end of the day, none of that really matters. What matters is whether or not the series was any good, and seeing as this was made during a time when Children's cartoons were at there best, and it had Nintendo funding, it's no surprise that it was. Some of it is amazing. The animation dipped after the first season, eventually going almost completely by the very end, but the stuff on this set is all good, including some of the best moments I ever saw in a kids show. Check out the two parter when they fight Big Eye in Megaman's world, and the way that at the end of every episode they played massive songs from the time, such as Michael Jacksons Thriller during an episode in Castlevania. It's so well made that as they journey through video game to video game, it will make you wanna pick up a nes again and start playing through the games yourself. Fortunately, the Wii should mean that you actually can.So, to summarise, any Nintendo fan, any cartoon fan, buy this series. It was up there with Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters and others as one of the best kids shows going. If only they had released it when I was still 8 years old.",5,For those that don't know,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,2327,"['searching', 'net', 'years', 'just', 'find', 'even', 'few', 'episodes', 'Captain', 'N', 'bagging', 'chewed', 'up', 'videos', 'placing', 'orders', 'dodgy', 'sites', 'never', 'arrived', 'obtaining', 'nasty', 'pirate', 'copies', 'fake', 'DVD', 'barely', 'worked', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'decided', 'release', 'series', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'been', 'sooner', 'suppose', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'come', 'much', 'better', 'time', 'this.For', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'N', 'Captain', 'N', 'Nintendo', 'seeing', 'Nintendo', 'have', 'swiftly', 'restored', 'rightful', 'place', 'top', 'spot', 'video', 'game', 'world', 'DS', 'Wii', 'show', 'once', 'again', 'place.The', 'series', 'started', '1991', 'was', 'based', 'kid', 'called', 'Kevin', 'who', 'got', 'sucked', 'Nes', 'playing', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'Punch', 'found', 'Videoland', 'nes', 'pad', 'belt', 'lightgun', 'get', 'different', 'worlds', 'N', 'team', 'consisted', 'famous', 'characters', 'Nes', 'games', 'such', 'Megaman', 'Kid', 'Icarus', 'Simon', 'Belmont', 'Castlevania', 'Seeing', 'Wii', 'device', 'download', 'many', 'old', 'games', 'series', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'even', 'new', 'generations', 'game', 'players.Anyway', 'end', 'day', 'none', 'really', 'matters', 'What', 'not', 'series', 'was', 'good', 'seeing', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'Children', 'cartoons', 'were', 'best', 'had', 'Nintendo', 'funding', 'surprise', 'was', 'amazing', 'animation', 'dipped', 'first', 'season', 'eventually', 'going', 'almost', 'completely', 'very', 'end', 'stuff', 'set', 'good', 'including', 'best', 'moments', 'ever', 'saw', 'kids', 'show', 'Check', 'out', 'two', 'parter', 'when', 'fight', 'Big', 'Eye', 'Megaman', 'world', 'way', 'end', 'episode', 'played', 'massive', 'songs', 'time', 'such', 'Michael', 'Jacksons', 'Thriller', 'episode', 'Castlevania', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'journey', 'video', 'game', 'video', 'game', 'will', 'make', 'wan', 'pick', 'up', 'nes', 'again', 'start', 'playing', 'games', 'Fortunately', 'Wii', 'should', 'mean', 'actually', 'can.So', 'summarise', 'Nintendo', 'fan', 'cartoon', 'fan', 'buy', 'series', 'was', 'up', 'there', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'Ghostbusters', 'others', 'one', 'best', 'kids', 'going', 'only', 'had', 'released', 'when', 'was', 'still', '8', 'years', 'old']",Captain N The Game Master - The Complete Series

That being said, you do actually get enough for the price.  The other bad things, anyone that watches and is a fan of the games represented will notice, are that many of the characters are different.  Mega Man is green instead of blue.

I even pre-ordered my boxset in December of 2006. Well, unfortunately, you only get twenty-six episodes and they are just seasons one and two. I do hope that seasons three and four are realeased on to DVD very soon. Still, what I mentioned above about not having all the episodes isn't all bad. But, at least have lots of charactors in a show that deals with video games. For instance, The Super Mario Brothers, Toad, as well as King Koopa and his forces of evil, and the princess of the Mushroom kingdom if your going to talk about video land. Still, this isn't a bad DVD set if you love the classic Nintendo cartoons. This DVD set has no major violence. Lots of comic relief Thanks to Simon Belmont, and Duke Kevin's dog.

1025913,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B000JBXHVY,E. David Swan,"[5, 5]","Long before Pokemon hit the airways, during the late 80's early 90's, Nintendo had several cartoon series running including Super Mario, Zelda and Captain N. I never really got into the Mario cartoon and I doubt I watched a single episode of Zelda but Captain N made an indelible impression on my memory. The animation is fairly mediocre although it does improve over time. The plots are fairly basic and the characters diverge considerably from the source material. In particular Megaman (aka The Blue Bomber) is drawn green and squatty and talks with a speech impediment. And speaking of impediments Kid Icarus has a speech affect that gets oldicus real fasticus. Simon Belmont is an arrogant dimwit rather than a heroic vampire hunter and Donkey Kong is a straight rip-off of King Kong.Actually, the characters that I remembered most were Mother Brain's henchmen Eggplant Wizard and King Hippo. They were your typical mentally challenged underlings but somehow the shows creators managed to infuse them with enough charm and uniqueness that people still remember them two decades later. It's the small things like Hippo and Wizard that set this series apart. Captain N is definitely more than the sum of its parts. I'm not sure if Captain N would fall under the category of cult classic but it certainly says something that people still talk about the series this long after the show went off the air and there even exists a handful of websites devoted to Captain N that look as if some actual effort was put into them.When it gets right down to it Captain N is going to be vastly more appealing to that certain segment of society that grew up playing the original NES system and watched cartoons in the late 80's early 90's. For instance, unless you've actually played Paperboy the episode `The Invasion of the Paper Pedalers' isn't going to have much meaning. On the other hand I never played Bayou Billy or Puss N' Boots but still enjoyed those episodes. The DVD special features are barely worth mentioning but in the end I don't regret getting this collection one bit. I just happen to fit the target demographic perfectly. In the end you get every episode that matters for a very reasonable price. At 9  hours it's quite a bit of bang for your buck.",4,Great Retro Collection,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,2258,"['Long', 'before', 'Pokemon', 'hit', 'airways', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'Nintendo', 'had', 'several', 'cartoon', 'series', 'running', 'including', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Zelda', 'Captain', 'N.', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'Mario', 'cartoon', 'doubt', 'watched', 'single', 'episode', 'Zelda', 'Captain', 'N', 'made', 'indelible', 'impression', 'memory', 'animation', 'fairly', 'mediocre', 'improve', 'time', 'plots', 'are', 'fairly', 'basic', 'characters', 'diverge', 'considerably', 'source', 'material', 'particular', 'Megaman', 'Blue', 'Bomber', 'drawn', 'green', 'squatty', 'talks', 'speech', 'impediment', 'speaking', 'impediments', 'Kid', 'Icarus', 'speech', 'affect', 'oldicus', 'real', 'fasticus', 'Simon', 'Belmont', 'arrogant', 'dimwit', 'rather', 'heroic', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'straight', 'rip-off', 'King', 'Kong.Actually', 'characters', 'remembered', 'most', 'were', 'Mother', 'Brain', 'henchmen', 'Eggplant', 'Wizard', 'King', 'Hippo', 'were', 'typical', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'underlings', 'somehow', 'shows', 'creators', 'managed', 'infuse', 'enough', 'charm', 'uniqueness', 'people', 'still', 'remember', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'small', 'things', 'Hippo', 'Wizard', 'set', 'series', 'apart', 'Captain', 'N', 'definitely', 'more', 'sum', 'parts', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Captain', 'N', 'would', 'fall', 'category', 'cult', 'classic', 'certainly', 'something', 'people', 'still', 'talk', 'series', 'long', 'show', 'went', 'air', 'there', 'even', 'handful', 'websites', 'devoted', 'Captain', 'N', 'look', 'actual', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'them.When', 'right', 'down', 'Captain', 'N', 'going', 'be', 'vastly', 'more', 'appealing', 'certain', 'segment', 'society', 'grew', 'up', 'playing', 'original', 'NES', 'system', 'watched', 'cartoons', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'instance', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'played', 'Paperboy', 'episode', 'Invasion', 'Paper', 'Pedalers', ""n't"", 'going', 'have', 'much', 'meaning', 'other', 'hand', 'never', 'played', 'Bayou', 'Billy', 'Puss', 'N', 'Boots', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'barely', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'getting', 'collection', 'one', 'bit', 'just', 'happen', 'fit', 'target', 'demographic', 'perfectly', 'end', 'get', 'episode', 'matters', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', '9', 'hours', 'quite', 'bit', 'bang', 'buck']",Captain N The Game Master - The Complete Series

However, it isn't as perfect as I wanted it to be, but good enough to call my own.The only problems I find w/ the dvd set is: all the episodes are not there, an episode is edited heavily, cutting out 2 useful minutes of dialogue and action, and, lastly, an episode version or two of certain episodes are also missing.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I love Captain N, but I wanted it in all of its full glory so I can die happy.

1025916,AM4UVNWCW9NJE,B000JBXHVY,iansomniak,"[0, 0]","Kevin Keene was a teenaged video game fanatic with a messy bedroom.  Countless hours of his mundane life were frittered away amid the clutter as he pounded relentlessly on the big red buttons of his NES Advantage, stubbornly ignoring his nagging mother's incessant demands that he put down the joystick and clean up his pigsty.  Then, one fateful afternoon, Kevin's frivolous existence was instantly and radically changed, as the procrastinating gamer was suddenly pulled into the screen of his Sony television (along with his checkered curtains) in the middle of an epic Punch-Out fight.  His loyal canine friend, Duke, quickly jumped into the TV portal after him, and the two friends--now inexplicably transformed into cartoon characters--soon found themselves in the digitized realm known as Videoland, home of the pantsless redheaded angel-boy, Kid Icarus (who is afflicted with a most unusual speech impediment); the robotic mega-dwarf, Mega Man (who sounds like a chain-smoking chipmunk); the narcissistic vampire-hunting oaf, Simon Belmont; and, of course, her Royal Highnicus, the beautiful and vivacious Princess Lana.  Moments after Kevin's arrival, the bare-midriffed Princess presented the high school student with a Zapper gun and a Power Pad belt buckle and dubbed him Captain N, the Game Master.  She called upon the young earthling to defend Videoland in the kingdom's eternal struggle against the fiendishly grotesque jar of gray matter, Mother Brain (voiced by Levi Stubbs, Jr.), and her bumbling minions: the morbidly obese and perpetually shirtless King Hippo and the purple-skinned cyclops known as Eggplant Wizard.  Realizing that being the protector of a world populated by Nintendo characters would most assuredly free him forever of the daunting task of straightening up his room while simultaneously giving him an excuse to play video games 24-7, Kevinicus gladly accepted the jobicus.  As he and his N-Team cohorts warp from zone to zone blasting moglins and other assorted beasties into pixels, they encounter a myriad of NES legends like Donkey Kong; Link and Zelda; Bayou Billy (the Crocodile Dundee clone); Julio (the Paper Boy); Tetris World's Mayor Squaresly; and the elfin king of Faxanadu, a blue-faced Elvis impersonator called Melvis.Chronicled here on four fantasticus DVDs, are 26 of Captain N's marvelously entertaining 8-bit adventures.  The discs come in two slim cases enveloped in a shiny black and red cardboard slipcover.  Fans who are gifted with exceptional memories will notice that the popular songs played in the background of Season 1's episodes have all been replaced with an instrumental version of ""Mega Move""--a ditty that can be heard during ""The Feud of Faxanadu"" on Disc 4.  Be forewarned that this tune will be permanently stuck in your head by the time you've finished watching these DVDs.  Aside from this baffling musical censorship, this is a mega nice seticus maximus.  The audio/video quality is not too impressive, but I guess that's to be expected for a show that's nearly twenty years old.

1025918,A21G7YMX8M7Z4T,B000JBXHVY,Kevis Hendrickson,"[1, 2]","Captain N: The Game Master is a 90's animated television series that holds up well even after so many years since its debut on NBC. Back in these days, most kids woke up early on Saturday mornings to watch the best cartoons on TV with a large bowl of cereal in their laps. This cartoon was the creation of DIC Entertainment and Nintendo and was used as a platform to boost the popularity of what was the hottest videogame system in history at the time, the Nintendo Entertainment System.The show itself features a plethora of characters from Nintendo's arsenal of high profile old school games such as Donkey Kong, Kid Icarus, Mike Tyson's Punch Out, and Metroid, but also included third-party licensed game characters such as Simon Belmont, Mega Man, Tetris, Faxanadu, and Bayou Billy.For young fans of Nintendo's system (such as myself) it didn't get much better than getting pumped up watching Captain N during its 30-minute run before cranking up the NES to get our video game fix.This show is more comic-relief than drama and full of spoofs. But that's where the genius of this show lies. There is so much parody of 80's and 90's pop culture infused into this riot-filled show that it's really hard to watch Captain N with a straight face.The Tron-like plot of the show, however campy, is a lot of fun. 15-year old Kevin is having a blast playing Mike Tyson's Punch Out on his NES with his dog Duke beside him when he (and Duke) are suddenly sucked into his television screen and transported to the digital realm of Video Land, home of all his favorite video game characters. There Kevin learns that Video Land is under attack by the minions of the evil Mother Brain. He also discovers that he is the Game Master, the only one who can save Video Land from Mother Brain's tyrrany.Kevin soon joins forces with Team Nintendo which includes Princess Lana, Simon Belmont, Mega Man, Kid Icarus, and of course Duke! Armed with his trustee Nintendo blaster and control pad, Kevin takes on Mother Brain and her oafish servants The Eggplant Wizard, King Hippo, Count Dracula, and the evil Dr. Wily.Even though most kids today will be unfamiliar with the characters in Captain N, this zany show is still worth its salt and is entertaining to watch on its own merits, if not for pure nostalgia value. As a bonus for video game fans, the show's highlight features episodes with Link and Zelda from The Legend of Zelda games. This is a treat since Link's own animated series was prematurely canceled.My only gripe with Captain N: The Complete Series DVD is that it fails to include the third and final season of Captain N. That honor is given to the Super Mario World animated series DVD.With that said, I enjoy watching my Captain N DVD like nobody's business and have turned on all the young ones in my family to the show. I highly recommended this DVD to all connoisseurs of 80's and 90's animated television shows and video-game junkies like myself.",5,More fun than a barrel full of monkeys!,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,2944,"['Captain', 'N', 'Game', 'Master', '90', 'animated', 'television', 'series', 'up', 'well', 'even', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'debut', 'NBC', 'Back', 'days', 'most', 'kids', 'woke', 'up', 'early', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'watch', 'best', 'cartoons', 'TV', 'large', 'bowl', 'cereal', 'laps', 'cartoon', 'was', 'creation', 'DIC', 'Entertainment', 'Nintendo', 'was', 'used', 'platform', 'boost', 'popularity', 'what', 'was', 'hottest', 'videogame', 'system', 'history', 'time', 'Nintendo', 'Entertainment', 'System.The', 'show', 'plethora', 'characters', 'Nintendo', 'arsenal', 'high', 'profile', 'old', 'school', 'games', 'such', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'Kid', 'Icarus', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'Punch', 'Out', 'Metroid', 'also', 'included', 'third-party', 'licensed', 'game', 'characters', 'such', 'Simon', 'Belmont', 'Mega', 'Man', 'Tetris', 'Faxanadu', 'Bayou', 'Billy.For', 'young', 'fans', 'Nintendo', 'system', 'such', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'getting', 'pumped', 'up', 'watching', 'Captain', 'N', '30-minute', 'run', 'cranking', 'up', 'NES', 'get', 'video', 'game', 'fix.This', 'show', 'more', 'comic-relief', 'drama', 'full', 'spoofs', 'where', 'genius', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'parody', '80', '90', 'pop', 'culture', 'infused', 'riot-filled', 'show', 'really', 'hard', 'watch', 'Captain', 'N', 'straight', 'face.The', 'Tron-like', 'plot', 'show', 'however', 'campy', 'lot', 'fun', '15-year', 'old', 'Kevin', 'having', 'blast', 'playing', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'Punch', 'Out', 'NES', 'dog', 'Duke', 'when', 'Duke', 'are', 'suddenly', 'sucked', 'television', 'screen', 'transported', 'digital', 'realm', 'Video', 'Land', 'home', 'favorite', 'video', 'game', 'characters', 'Kevin', 'Video', 'Land', 'attack', 'minions', 'evil', 'Mother', 'Brain', 'also', 'Game', 'Master', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'Video', 'Land', 'Mother', 'Brain', 'tyrrany.Kevin', 'soon', 'forces', 'Team', 'Nintendo', 'Princess', 'Lana', 'Simon', 'Belmont', 'Mega', 'Man', 'Kid', 'Icarus', 'course', 'Duke', 'Armed', 'trustee', 'Nintendo', 'blaster', 'control', 'pad', 'Kevin', 'Mother', 'Brain', 'oafish', 'servants', 'Eggplant', 'Wizard', 'King', 'Hippo', 'Count', 'Dracula', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Wily.Even', 'most', 'kids', 'today', 'will', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'characters', 'Captain', 'N', 'zany', 'show', 'still', 'worth', 'salt', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'pure', 'nostalgia', 'value', 'bonus', 'video', 'game', 'fans', 'show', 'highlight', 'features', 'Link', 'Zelda', 'Legend', 'Zelda', 'games', 'treat', 'Link', 'own', 'animated', 'series', 'was', 'prematurely', 'canceled.My', 'only', 'gripe', 'Captain', 'N', 'Complete', 'Series', 'DVD', 'include', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'Captain', 'N.', 'honor', 'given', 'Super', 'Mario', 'World', 'animated', 'series', 'DVD.With', 'said', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Captain', 'N', 'DVD', 'nobody', 'business', 'have', 'turned', 'young', 'ones', 'family', 'show', 'highly', 'recommended', 'DVD', 'connoisseurs', '80', '90', 'animated', 'television', 'shows', 'video-game', 'junkies']",Captain N The Game Master - The Complete Series

1025922,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000JBXHVY,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[6, 6]","Of all the cartoons I remember from my youth, I honestly never thought that Captain N: The Game Master would ever see the light of day again.  Then again, considering the renaissance that Nintendo is going through thanks to the Wii and DS, maybe it's of little surprise that this old Nintendo cartoon would make it's way to DVD.  Originally airing in the late 80's/early 90's, when Nintendo was king of the console world (then again, they pretty much were the console world at the time), Captain N revolved around a California teenager lured into the interactive world of video games to combat evil.  Alongside him in battle are video game characters including Castlevania's Simon Belmont, Capcom's robot icon Mega Man, and even cult video game icon Kid Icarus.  As the show goes on, nearly every popular series to get it's start on the 8-bit NES is covered on Captain N; ranging from Tetris, Punch-Out (no Mike Tyson), Metroid, and even Zelda and Link (who had their own animated series too), and the series maintains a fun atmosphere throughout with a good amount of kid-aimed action.  Watching Captain N now though suffers the same fate as many cartoons from the era; they haven't aged all too well.  In the later episodes in particular, the animation (which was never really anything to write home about) seems to decline more in quality, and as a previous reviewer has already stated, not every episode in the series is here in this handsome DVD set.  That aside, there's an actual nice assortment of extras for old time fans with fond memories of the series, and it's good to see Captain N make his way to DVD.",4,Never thought I'd see the day...,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,1616,"['cartoons', 'remember', 'youth', 'honestly', 'never', 'thought', 'Captain', 'N', 'Game', 'Master', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'again', 'Then', 'again', 'considering', 'renaissance', 'Nintendo', 'going', 'thanks', 'Wii', 'DS', 'maybe', 'little', 'surprise', 'old', 'Nintendo', 'cartoon', 'would', 'make', 'way', 'DVD', 'Originally', 'airing', 'late', ""80's/early"", '90', 'when', 'Nintendo', 'was', 'king', 'console', 'world', 'then', 'again', 'pretty', 'much', 'were', 'console', 'world', 'time', 'Captain', 'N', 'revolved', 'California', 'teenager', 'lured', 'interactive', 'world', 'video', 'games', 'combat', 'evil', 'Alongside', 'battle', 'are', 'video', 'game', 'characters', 'including', 'Castlevania', 'Simon', 'Belmont', 'Capcom', 'robot', 'icon', 'Mega', 'Man', 'even', 'cult', 'video', 'game', 'icon', 'Kid', 'Icarus', 'show', 'nearly', 'popular', 'series', 'get', 'start', '8-bit', 'NES', 'covered', 'Captain', 'N', 'ranging', 'Tetris', 'Punch-Out', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'Metroid', 'even', 'Zelda', 'Link', 'who', 'had', 'own', 'animated', 'series', 'too', 'series', 'fun', 'atmosphere', 'good', 'amount', 'kid-aimed', 'action', 'Watching', 'Captain', 'N', 'now', 'suffers', 'same', 'fate', 'many', 'cartoons', 'era', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'too', 'well', 'later', 'episodes', 'particular', 'animation', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'decline', 'more', 'quality', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'already', 'stated', 'not', 'episode', 'series', 'here', 'handsome', 'DVD', 'set', 'aside', 'actual', 'nice', 'assortment', 'extras', 'old', 'time', 'fans', 'fond', 'memories', 'series', 'good', 'see', 'Captain', 'N', 'make', 'way', 'DVD']",Captain N The Game Master - The Complete Series

After much begging, my younger brother had both a Nintendo console and then a subscription to the tie-in magazine--but never the ultra-sugary breakfast cereal.This animated kids show was another (perhaps the last!) attempt to cash in on the Nintendo empire--and for what it was (cash cow) it actually was pretty good.A California teenager and his dog are somehow transported from his TV while playing video games (obviously Nintendo) into a parallel dimension where he discovers that those characters are both actually real and he is the Game Master. Considering how 'out of this world' the plot was, the series held up pretty well during it's original run.I never really figured out what game Princess Lana was supposed to come from in the Nintendo empire even though I was aware of video game characters. Several of the other characters in this series were culled from Nintendo's video game library.In a world where 'Buffy' perhaps now automatically springs into public consciousness with any connotation of the phrase 'vampire hunter' the Simon Belmont character might seem a little odd. However, he provides good-natured comic relief to viewing audiences. On another note, he also provides somebody for Kevin (who is supposed to be their team leader) to test his ideas off of. Simon is vain (he always carried a mirror around with him) but he is ultimately committed to getting his job done.Other members of the `good team' include Kid Icarus (Kid Icarus and Mega Man (Mega Man), but oddly Mario and Luigi were spun off into their own separate show. However, considering they were Nintendo's 'main' characters--they should have been on this team helping save Videoland. I would think that if the series animators had the room/time to include characters from the Legend of Zelda in guest spots in this series, then they apparently weren't worried about 'big toons' overshadowing little and/or new ones.Kevin and company are supposed to battle Mother Brain and other assorted badies from conquering Videoland, and then presumably taking over it.

1025926,AAJ9VIJDUZ35Z,B000JBXHVY,tvideo,"[1, 1]","This is a nice low cost set for those wanting a decent quality Captain N collection.The most annoying thing about this set is the DVD Menu.First off, every time you watch the DVD (unless using resume memory) you are FORCED to watch the entire introduction sequence to the Captain N Cartoon (ridiculous!). Though it is edited, it is not short enough and there is NO way to skip it since it is part of the menu!Secondly, all discs use the same obscure menu with non functioning buttons pointing to all discs. This is quite bizarre and poorly designed.The video is decent quality, they use double layer discs and put 5-6 episodes on a disc. The video is encoded w/ VBR (Variable Bit Rate) which unfortunately adds a ""pause"" to still shots (in order to save space) but overall isn't a major issue.The cartoon is just as corny as ever, very few games & characters represent their original Japanese content accurately, most (if not all) games and characters are beyond recognition until stated by the Cartoon.",3,"Bad Menu, rushed product, decent quality",1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,1003,"['nice', 'low', 'cost', 'set', 'wanting', 'decent', 'quality', 'Captain', 'N', 'most', 'annoying', 'thing', 'set', 'DVD', 'Menu.First', 'off', 'time', 'watch', 'DVD', 'using', 'resume', 'memory', 'are', 'FORCED', 'watch', 'entire', 'introduction', 'sequence', 'Captain', 'N', 'Cartoon', 'ridiculous', 'edited', 'not', 'short', 'enough', 'way', 'skip', 'part', 'menu', 'Secondly', 'discs', 'use', 'same', 'obscure', 'menu', 'non', 'functioning', 'buttons', 'pointing', 'discs', 'quite', 'bizarre', 'poorly', 'designed.The', 'video', 'decent', 'quality', 'use', 'double', 'layer', 'discs', 'put', '5-6', 'episodes', 'disc', 'video', 'encoded', 'w/', 'VBR', 'Variable', 'Bit', 'Rate', 'unfortunately', 'pause', 'still', 'shots', 'order', 'save', 'space', 'overall', ""n't"", 'major', 'issue.The', 'cartoon', 'just', 'as', 'corny', 'ever', 'very', 'few', 'games', 'characters', 'represent', 'original', 'Japanese', 'content', 'accurately', 'most', 'not', 'games', 'characters', 'are', 'recognition', 'stated', 'Cartoon']",Captain N The Game Master - The Complete Series
