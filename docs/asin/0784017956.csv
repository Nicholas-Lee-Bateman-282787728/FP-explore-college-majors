77863,A3ENQW5RR9WBDS,0784017956,Anna Bates,"[2, 2]","I recently purchased three videos with exercises aimed at getting one back into shape.  The other two were Startin' Simple Easy Aerobics and Fabulous Forever with Mirabai Holland.  This was one of the best of the three.  I haven't exercised for three years, and I am recoveing from knee surgery.  I found Denise Austin's Xtralite aerobics easy on my limbs and fairly easy to follow.  She is, as always, invigorating and inspiring to watch and follow.  My only concern is that people who have never done aerobics might have trouble following the routines.  She does not always explain the steps, and she assumes viewers know basics such as grapevine and ball-change steps. People who do not already know these things will probably feel frustrated the first few times they use the tape.  Austin also adds some hops and skips to the routine, which I can not do.  They are not mandatory, and I am not even sure she is aware that she does them.  But Denise is Denise -- energetic, bouncy and breathless.  I love her, and this tape has been a great help for me.",4,If you're a Denise Austin fan you'll love this one,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,1055,"['recently', 'purchased', 'three', 'videos', 'exercises', 'aimed', 'getting', 'one', 'back', 'shape', 'other', 'two', 'were', 'Startin', 'Simple', 'Easy', 'Aerobics', 'Fabulous', 'Forever', 'Mirabai', 'Holland', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'three', 'have', ""n't"", 'exercised', 'three', 'years', 'am', 'recoveing', 'knee', 'surgery', 'found', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'Xtralite', 'aerobics', 'easy', 'limbs', 'fairly', 'easy', 'follow', 'always', 'invigorating', 'inspiring', 'watch', 'follow', 'only', 'concern', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'aerobics', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'routines', 'not', 'always', 'explain', 'steps', 'viewers', 'know', 'basics', 'such', 'grapevine', 'ball-change', 'steps', 'People', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'already', 'know', 'things', 'will', 'probably', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'use', 'tape', 'Austin', 'also', 'hops', 'skips', 'routine', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'are', 'not', 'mandatory', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'aware', 'Denise', 'Denise', 'energetic', 'bouncy', 'breathless', 'love', 'tape', 'been', 'great', 'help']",Denise Austin - Xtralite:Beginner's Aerobics VHS
77864,A4QUF7E5CSWW6,0784017956,"Claire ""mscnach2""","[1, 2]","The low-budget production of this video puts an overall damper on it, but I still use the tape to get me moving.  It's a good half hour of lite aerobics, but still a challenge for the beginner exerciser, or for someone like me, who just has bad cardio and needs to build it up.  The music isn't anything great and she blabs more with positive drills like &quot;you're doing great, keep it up&quot;, than instruction which would be more helpful so you know what she's doing next.  The exercises are marching based so they're easy to do.  As I said before, it gets you off the couch and gets you moving.",3,"It will help get you off the couch, and get moving.",1020902400,"05 9, 2002",2002,601,"['low-budget', 'production', 'video', 'overall', 'damper', 'still', 'use', 'tape', 'get', 'moving', 'good', 'half', 'hour', 'lite', 'aerobics', 'still', 'challenge', 'beginner', 'exerciser', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'bad', 'cardio', 'build', 'up', 'music', ""n't"", 'anything', 'great', 'blabs', 'more', 'positive', 'drills', 'quot', ""'re"", 'doing', 'great', 'keep', 'up', 'quot', 'instruction', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'helpful', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'next', 'exercises', 'are', 'marching', 'based', ""'re"", 'easy', 'do', 'said', 'off', 'couch', 'moving']",Denise Austin - Xtralite:Beginner's Aerobics VHS

I did gym-dance several years ago and from there never stopped dancing, be it in the disco, creating choraographies, and so on, so I like things with a bit more pace, but this is just right to start out if you are out of shape (after having my daughter I ended up about 40 lbs too heavy) and want to get moving. It has prety simple moves, but not too simple that you won't be challenged. And if you do it regularly for a while, it will prepare you for some real stuff, like some serious cardio.I gave it 3 stars only because I have now not used it for a while, as it's not challenging anymore, plus Denise's constant chatter becomes a little annoying after a while...",3,Good workout if you are just starting to get in shape,996883200,"08 4, 2001",2001,701,"['was', 'first', 'exercise', 'video', 'did', 'gym-dance', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'there', 'never', 'stopped', 'dancing', 'be', 'disco', 'creating', 'choraographies', 'so', 'like', 'things', 'bit', 'more', 'pace', 'just', 'right', 'start', 'out', 'are', 'shape', 'having', 'daughter', 'ended', 'up', 'about', '40', 'lbs', 'too', 'heavy', 'want', 'get', 'moving', 'prety', 'simple', 'moves', 'not', 'too', 'simple', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'challenged', 'do', 'regularly', 'while', 'will', 'prepare', 'real', 'stuff', 'serious', 'cardio.I', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'only', 'have', 'now', 'not', 'used', 'while', 'not', 'challenging', 'anymore', 'Denise', 'constant', 'chatter', 'little', 'annoying', 'while']",Denise Austin - Xtralite:Beginner's Aerobics VHS

77867,A3RMDGXN8T6D1F,0784017956,Rebecca,"[20, 20]","Nice and short, as well as not too tough.  The steps she uses are NOT hard, and I am no dancer!  Even if they are a little difficult for you, it would only take a couple repeats of the tape to get them down.  I highly recommend this video for beginners, those who have fallen out of working out, and those who need to lose a lot of weight (talk to your doctor first, of course).Denise allows you to get a workout without killing yourself.  You feel your heart rate pick up and your muscles working, but you are not dying like you might be in an aerobics class.  This great combination makes me want to get up and do the tape again, as opposed to other tapes where I just think how boring and painful they can be and decide to watch TV instead.  After a while, though, this workout can get too easy, so you have to step up to the next level and buy a new tape.  But if you are pressed for time and need to get in a light workout where you won't be drenched with sweat, this video is great.  And, of course, Denise is her ever-enthusiastic self and does a fantastic job in motivating you to work harder.",5,Awesome Light Aerobic Workout,993859200,"06 30, 2001",2001,1101,"['Nice', 'short', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'too', 'tough', 'steps', 'uses', 'are', 'NOT', 'hard', 'am', 'dancer', 'Even', 'are', 'little', 'difficult', 'would', 'only', 'take', 'couple', 'repeats', 'tape', 'get', 'down', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'beginners', 'who', 'have', 'fallen', 'working', 'out', 'who', 'need', 'lose', 'lot', 'weight', 'talk', 'doctor', 'first', 'course', '.Denise', 'get', 'workout', 'killing', 'feel', 'heart', 'rate', 'pick', 'up', 'muscles', 'working', 'are', 'not', 'dying', 'might', 'be', 'aerobics', 'class', 'great', 'combination', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'do', 'tape', 'again', 'opposed', 'other', 'tapes', 'where', 'just', 'think', 'how', 'boring', 'painful', 'can', 'be', 'decide', 'watch', 'TV', 'instead', 'while', 'though', 'workout', 'can', 'get', 'too', 'easy', 'have', 'step', 'up', 'next', 'level', 'buy', 'new', 'tape', 'are', 'pressed', 'time', 'need', 'get', 'light', 'workout', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'drenched', 'sweat', 'video', 'great', 'course', 'Denise', 'ever-enthusiastic', 'self', 'fantastic', 'job', 'motivating', 'work', 'harder']",Denise Austin - Xtralite:Beginner's Aerobics VHS

First of all, Denise is standing near the ocean, which makes for a nice view, but the noise of the waves seriously interfered with the sound quality -- at times I couldn't even hear her!  Also, I found the choreography to be far too intricate for a beginner.  It was nearly impossible for me to keep up (granted, I'm no Ginger Rogers).  And last but not least: Denise looks great, but it would have been nice to have some other people there . . . maybe even some with more &quot;average&quot; bodies.",1,Disappointing,972950400,"10 31, 2000",2000,569,"['was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'video', 'number', 'reasons', 'First', 'Denise', 'standing', 'ocean', 'nice', 'view', 'noise', 'waves', 'seriously', 'interfered', 'sound', 'quality', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'hear', 'Also', 'found', 'choreography', 'be', 'far', 'too', 'intricate', 'beginner', 'was', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'keep', 'up', 'granted', ""'m"", 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Denise', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'other', 'people', 'there', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'quot', 'average', 'quot', 'bodies']",Denise Austin - Xtralite:Beginner's Aerobics VHS
