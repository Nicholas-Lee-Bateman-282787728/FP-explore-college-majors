There were two scenes that I had to just fast forward through because they lasted so long and were so dry, and then I just stopped the DVD altogether.2.  It was too much like the movie, ""the Brothers.""  Now had this been called, ""The Brothers (the Play)"", I could have gotten in to it.  But it wasn't so I couldn't.  There was the sexy light skinned guy getting getting engaged, there was the bitter black guy who didn't like black women, there was the super sexy player who could never commit, and the fat guy was the comic relief.  There was nothing original about this play and I hated it.  The 15-20 minutes that I saw of it anyway.3.  Someone said this was ""so real"", but no it wasn't! It was cliche matter of factly.4.  Allen Payne is pretty good actor but I don't think the stage is his forte.  He may need a little more practice at stage plays because he really wasn't that good here.Like someone else said, rent or borrow before you buy.

It was refreshing to see a stage production that wasnt effected by the Tyler Perry craze going on.  Sometime people want to be entertained without having to learn a moral lesson.  The lesson in the play was rivalent to majority of black people life styles.  I love the title song, and the ending was surpirsing and made you want more,I was almost thinking something else would happen.

1033967,A1K7DFLII50AGQ,B000KGGZYE,L. McCollum,"[1, 1]","This is a good play in my opinion. It has one or two slow points, but it's not enough to make you turn it off. It's a very good effort. Of course, I may be biased, but I love me some Je'Caryous productions! So I think it's real good! It is mostly drama with some humor splashed throughout. So anyone looking for non-stop laughs, don't buy it. But if you're looking for a dramedy that shows the trials and mistrials of relationships I recommend it.Derrick Reed quits his job in corporate America to publish his own magazine, Happily Single. After an interesting radio program Reed becomes involved with Angela Williams. The question during the play goes from ""Why do men cheat"" to ""Can a man ever stop cheating?"" During the course of the relationship Angela moves so she can start a fitness business and her friend-who-can't-be-trusted puts the moves on Derrick. Needless to say after a heated confrontation Derrick realizes that he was wrong and wants Angela back. But of course he wasn't thinking of what he was jepoardizing while he was stroking the other woman. Derrick will learn how it feels to be down on his knees during the sorriest day of his life, and we see what makes a man cry.To provide some contrast to Derrick & Angela, we have his friend Marc who doesn't date sistahs, and Tony with his baby-mama drama issues.For the hilarious factor we have comedian Lavelle Crawford playing another friend. He provides numerous instances of comic relief that will keep you laughing each time.",4,Good to See!,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,1495,"['good', 'play', 'opinion', 'one', 'two', 'slow', 'points', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'turn', 'off', 'very', 'good', 'effort', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'biased', 'love', ""Je'Caryous"", 'productions', 'So', 'think', 'real', 'good', 'mostly', 'drama', 'humor', 'splashed', 'So', 'anyone', 'looking', 'non-stop', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', ""'re"", 'looking', 'dramedy', 'trials', 'mistrials', 'relationships', 'recommend', 'it.Derrick', 'Reed', 'job', 'corporate', 'America', 'publish', 'own', 'magazine', 'Happily', 'Single', 'interesting', 'radio', 'program', 'Reed', 'involved', 'Angela', 'Williams', 'question', 'play', 'Why', 'do', 'men', 'cheat', 'Can', 'man', 'ever', 'stop', 'cheating', 'course', 'relationship', 'Angela', 'so', 'can', 'start', 'fitness', 'business', ""friend-who-can't-be-trusted"", 'moves', 'Derrick', 'Needless', 'say', 'heated', 'confrontation', 'Derrick', 'was', 'wrong', 'Angela', 'back', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'what', 'was', 'jepoardizing', 'was', 'stroking', 'other', 'woman', 'Derrick', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'be', 'down', 'knees', 'sorriest', 'day', 'life', 'see', 'what', 'man', 'cry.To', 'provide', 'contrast', 'Derrick', 'Angela', 'have', 'friend', 'Marc', 'who', ""n't"", 'date', 'sistahs', 'Tony', 'baby-mama', 'drama', 'hilarious', 'factor', 'have', 'comedian', 'Lavelle', 'Crawford', 'playing', 'friend', 'numerous', 'instances', 'comic', 'relief', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'time']",N/A
