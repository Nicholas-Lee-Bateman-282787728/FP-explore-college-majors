1062410,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,B000O5B4CO,Allen Bowers,"[1, 2]","I didn't actually know about this movie until I came accross it on ""On Demand.  Once I read the description and noticed that not only does it feature a psychotic,teen-slashing clown but also his name is ""Horny the Clown"" well that's when I came to the following 2 conclusions 1)I laughed hysterically at the idea, and 2)I'm there Dude! So anyway needless to say this movie was a quick sell with me, simply because I thought it was unique to see both a psychotic killer clown but also his original and unique ways of giving the main character Mackenzie hidden clues as to who's next!(the ouija board,the magic 8-ball, and the etcha-sketch) What made this movie enjoyable in particular besides Leighton Meester being one super-smokin' mad HOTTIE is how it's reminiscent to me of the 80's slashers that I grew up with.(Friday the 13th,Halloween,A Nightmare on Elm Street.You know the ones!) Such great franchises they've proven to be over the years. With some bad sequels attached! Also Horny is just plain funny! Since everyone else here at Amazon have done some great reviews already all that leaves me with is:  The chase scenes with Horny the Clown coming after Leighter Meester were indeed suspenseful, Horny's line where he shouts "" You're my girlfriend now, and I'm horny!"" cracks me up every time! Also it felt like a fond tribute to ""The Funhouse"" when Horny kills that snob couple in the funhouse/trick mirrors scene! That scene where one of Mackenzie's friends get her head nuked through the bottum of a microwave was one incomparably clever murder scene! My only criticizisms of this movie are that dreadful and annoying not to mention intrusive metal music and that whole unexplained thing with Horny possessing supernatural/demonic powers! Other than that definitely watch this movie for that sweet Hottie Leighton Meester and of course Horny the Clown!

1062415,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B000O5B4CO,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[3, 4]","This is one of those horror films that works because it is just so hysterical. There are more laughs in this film than in many comedies, and the ""cheese factor"" of the special effects makes it even more laughable.Leighton Meester is a very likable actress, no matter what she is in, and clearly she delivers in this role as a headstrong teenager who is a bit more sophisticated than the typical young girl in horror films. Her cast of well-intentioned but dim-witted friends are funny also. But the cameos and small roles are what makes this film. The Morgan Spurlock cameo is a nice touch, as well as some other characters such as the fast-food restaurant owner (John Gilbert), the fat rambling detective (Larry Joe Campbell), and the deranged janitor (Sean Whalen) are all funny and well-played.When it comes down to it, there are two types of movies in this genre: ones that take themselves WAY too seriously and fail because they try to be too ""smart,"" and there are the other films that succeed because they are so preposterous by their very nature that they make humorous situations out of the self-parody. This film falls into the latter category. There is plenty of gore, screams, off-color jokes, and funny one-liners. After all, when we go through a drive-thru, we're not looking for a five course meal. We're looking for a particular item or two that will satisfy our appetite at the time.

1062423,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B000O5B4CO,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","Our main character of this film is Mackenzie Carpenter (played by the beautiful Leighton Meester), who plays the role of your typical sneaky and rebellious teenage girl.  Drive Thru revolves around a demonic, killer clown named Horny who comes to town and begins  hacking Mackenzie's friends to death, one by one, with his signature meat cleaver. Horny has some sort of an obsession with Mackenzie and wants something from her, but she can't seem to figure out what. As the body count piles up, he stalks her and plays mind games with her by the day via 70's kitsch toys.Mackenzie's 18th birthday is just days away and the closer her birthday gets, the closer he gets to her. She ends up discovering that due to her mom's past involving the spirit of the man in the clown suit, that she and her dead friends share an unfortunate connection with Horny. Mackenzie realizes that unless she wants to become Horny's next victim, she must confront and defeat the demonic clown and send him back to hell's freak circus. The ending of the movie left room for a sequel which supposedly began production in 2010 but has yet to be released. No idea what the hold up is but I wish they'd go ahead and get it done because I'm anxious to see the sequel.Right off the bat, it needs to be said that this is NOT a strict horror movie! This is comedy mixed with horror, so expect some cheesy and comical kills and lines being said. If you want a clown horror movie that's all horror, I recommend Stephen King's IT or the 1976 film Clown Murders. Because this is a low budget movie, the effects of this movie are very cheap and the acting is average but the movie overall is enjoyable, nonetheless.

To me, this movie was pretty ironic being that my ""break food"" was either a Big Mac or a Double Cheeseburger meal. Anyway, to the point, I never thought that ""Drive Thru"" would be a horror/comical/slasher movie. The cast members were a little obscure but hella-good! Now, we have a beautiful teenage girl named Mackenzie played by Leighton Meester. She's the lead singer of her band. She plays her heart out towards her fans and afterwards she chills with her boyfriend and the rest of the group. The night begins when the teens smoke weed and laugh about the Ouja Board. They think it's a loved one contacting them, but they were wrong. Horny the Clown is the killer with a huge meat cleaver. He slices, he dices, and makes chicken strips in three different ways. He was the one that sent Mackenzie the message on the board. And it doesn't stop there. See, Horny had a real name, and it was Archie. He was just an original, shy teen. He was unpopular and became a mascot at a hella-burger restaurant. He had a crush on Mackenzie's mom when she was a teen. And because of that, her boyfriend hated him for it. So, he and his crew thought of a plan to play a prank on him. And when Archie is celebrating his b-day all by himself, they start by breaking in the place and teased him, somebody knocked him over, one thing lead to another and the crew left him to burn. Since then, nobody told a soul. After that, Horny was ressurected into a murdering hellspawn and now he goes after teen kids, making them pay for the sins of their parents. As for Mac, she has to be threatened and chased by him constantly. The things that Horny says are hilarious. The particular scene I like is when he scares the hell out of those stoners. He literally slices and dices them in the playroom. What a bloody mess! And about Larry Joe Campbell's character Crockers, I hated him. He was always bossy, stuffing his face with junk food and arrogant, too blunt and fat. Ms. Meester has a permanent purpose in movies. She has beauty, charisma, humour and style. Hopefully, after she's done with ""Gossip Girl"", she can start her acting career, for real. All in all, I liked this movie. It has everything a slasher fan could ask for. Be prepared to see it again if you have it on DVD, I wonder if they can sell a Special Edition, we need to see those bloopers again. I clap my hands to this one, great job well done.

I got an awesome idea for a movie! (takes a hit from his joint)MORON FILMMAKER #2: Yeah!? What!?MORON FILMMAKER #1: We should make a movie where a killer mascot of a drive-thru goes on a killing spree!MORON FILMMAKER #2: That's so awesome!That's at least how I think it went down, I could be wrong. But yeah, this is one of the stupidest slasher films I've ever come across. As a horror film it fails, as a comedy it isn't funny in the slightest. It even tries to be be political, and a slasher film is not the place to be shoving your politics down someone's throat.Mackenzie (Leighton Meester, of stuff, I really have yet to see her in anything that really says ""someone to look out for"") is an upper class stoner teen who acts like she's better than the other upper class teens because she and her friends are all hip and now. During a party, her friends play around with a ouija board (which they are confused by what it is, because after all young people don't know anything about non electronic stuff). Although we later see Mackenzie playing with a magic 8 ball, so I guess they're only familiar with certain older novelty items. Anywho, the ouija board moves on it's own to spell out a license plate number to a car belonging to a couple of idiot white guys trying to be gangsta (who probably produce the worst dialogue in the entire movie). The idiot gangstas are the opening kills by Horny the Clown, the mascot of local fast food restaurant Hella Burger. Sigh...in what universe would a restaurant be called that? And this place apparently opened in the 1970's, so I seriously doubt anyone would use that name back then. And Horny the Clown, sure that sounds like a character you want entertaining little kids. I get that it's supposed to be satire (at least I'm assuming they were going for satire), but you could've put a little more effort into the name and design even. Horny just looks stupid, and spouts off terrible one liners that would make Mr. Freeze from Batman and Robin role his eyes. Mackenzie and her friends are unlikeable jerks who judge other people for being supposedly stupid, when they themselves talk about idiotic crap and smoke a lot of pot. I'll give kudos that most of the special effects seem to be done practically, but that can't save this pile of nothing. And that's the biggest problem really, it's an incredibly dull film. The main reason I'm writing this is that I'm hoping my rating will bump this movie's average rating down a little.

What is funny here, the singer of the cheese band later accuses someone at a party of being ""Banana Republic"". Um, because she is just so punk rock and cool herself (sporting Blink 182 posters in her bedroom)Some murders take place that night by a guy in a clown suit by the name of Horny the clown.The hipster chick, Mackenzie, then plays with a Ouija board, starts talking to a magic 8 ball and using an Etch-A-Sketch to contact the killer. She also plays the album ""Highway To Hell"" backwards, for clues to the murders.There are some pretty funny commercials for the fast food restaurant placed throughout. I don't know if anyone caught this, but the HellaBurger manager is the dude that filmed the Super Size Me documentary, and he is pretty funny in his short scene.Anyways, it all unfolds as to why the clown is after Mackenzie.

That's right up my alley and sounds like alot of fun.  I live for that kinda stuff.  Problem is, the film's not quite sure about what it wants to be.  Sure, it's certainly got some laugh out loud moments(The Hellaburger tv commercials are great), and I've always loved killers that use horrible puns(when a character finds a dead girl in a freezer, Horny the Clown tells him ""she's just chillin'"").  The thing I didn't quite care for was that the directors at times seemed liked they actually were trying to make a scary movie.  Certain scenes seem to be done for honest to god, ass reaming suspense.  That doesn't mix too well considering the many intentionally tongue in cheek scenes we'd already been laughing at.  With a plot this silly, you'd might as well go tongue in cheek.  After all, it'd be nearly impossible to make a terrifying film about a guy called Horny the Clown.  And if you're gonna go tongue in cheek, you'd might as well do it all the way.  Also, in between rather quiet scenes of dialogue, the loud blasts of metalcore when the killer attacks will have you constantly monitoring the volume control if you're trying not to wake up the household/apartment building/neighborhood.
