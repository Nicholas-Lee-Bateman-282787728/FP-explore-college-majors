1232302,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001QY08BK,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Guns of the West 100 Movie PackThis package combines two separate 50 Movie pack collections ""The Way West"" and ""Frontier Justice"". You can see the reviews for each separate package. These monochrome western movies were very popular from the 1930s to the 1940s in theaters, and on television in the 1950s and 1960s. Most people over fifty remember them. They had a message: those who do right win in the end. Younger people may also find them entertaining and educational. These popular movies defended small ranchers against the big landowners who sought their lands (the movie ""Shane""). Others defended people against criminal gangs with ""collective security"". The right to keep and bear arms was well-recognized. Many were set in modern times and showed telephones, radios, and automobiles. Was it changing tastes or economics that caused their decline?The newer westerns changed from property conflicts to personal conflicts. ""High Noon"" was an example of personal conflicts (with a hint of business conflicts). One movie noted how an increase in settlers disadvantaged cattle men since they could no longer graze their cattle on publicly owned range land. Store owners could do more business with 500 families than 1,000 transient cowboys. This government land was given to homesteaders, people who would earn the land by working and developing it. One of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books told about homesteading on the prairie and pioneer life on the frontier. These dramas show life and culture as seen by Hollywood and accepted by their customers.These movies were popular before big corporations began to put small owner-operated stores and farms out of business. One way was to cut off small business owners from wholesale distributors. If banks ""red-lined"" small businesses they could not get the loans needed for running their business. There were no government loans for farmers and ranchers then. Many of these films were produced by small studios who operated on a low budget. They were threatened by big movie studios with their cartel of theaters. These movies were later shown on television to fill up their broadcast schedule (the way some older TV shows are recycled today). Many of the films were edited for television by reducing their running times to about 53 minutes. You can notice the loss of scenes in some of these movies.These movies had little padding and have more action than in some longer big studio productions. Some have songs and dances for entertainment. This collection has Roy Rogers' movies, the star who acted in a wide range of roles. Gene Autry was the best Singing Cowboy. The other stars are: Johnny Mack Brown, Buster Crabbe, James Newill, George O'Brien, Tex Ritter, and Bob Steele. Many other actors are little remembered today; some of them were real cowboys (Tim McCoy, Hoot Gibson) or rodeo riders (Ken Maynard). The formula of the ""Three Mesquiteers"" seems to have inspired the ""Range Busters"" and the ""Rough Riders"" (who played undercover investigators who fought gangs of criminals).",5,Western Movies from Many Years Ago,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,3034,"['Guns', 'West', '100', 'Movie', 'PackThis', 'package', 'combines', 'two', 'separate', '50', 'Movie', 'pack', 'collections', 'Way', 'West', 'Frontier', 'Justice', 'can', 'see', 'reviews', 'separate', 'package', 'monochrome', 'western', 'movies', 'were', 'very', 'popular', '1930s', '1940s', 'theaters', 'television', '1950s', '1960s', 'Most', 'people', 'fifty', 'remember', 'had', 'message', 'who', 'do', 'right', 'win', 'end', 'Younger', 'people', 'may', 'also', 'find', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'popular', 'movies', 'defended', 'small', 'ranchers', 'big', 'landowners', 'who', 'sought', 'lands', 'movie', 'Shane', 'Others', 'defended', 'people', 'criminal', 'gangs', 'collective', 'security', 'right', 'keep', 'bear', 'arms', 'was', 'well-recognized', 'Many', 'were', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'showed', 'telephones', 'radios', 'automobiles', 'Was', 'changing', 'tastes', 'economics', 'caused', 'decline', 'newer', 'westerns', 'changed', 'property', 'conflicts', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'High', 'Noon', 'was', 'example', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'hint', 'business', 'conflicts', 'One', 'movie', 'noted', 'how', 'increase', 'settlers', 'disadvantaged', 'cattle', 'men', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'graze', 'cattle', 'publicly', 'owned', 'range', 'land', 'Store', 'owners', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'business', '500', 'families', '1,000', 'transient', 'cowboys', 'government', 'land', 'was', 'given', 'homesteaders', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'earn', 'land', 'working', 'developing', 'One', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'books', 'told', 'about', 'homesteading', 'prairie', 'pioneer', 'life', 'frontier', 'dramas', 'show', 'life', 'culture', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'accepted', 'customers.These', 'movies', 'were', 'popular', 'before', 'big', 'corporations', 'began', 'put', 'small', 'owner-operated', 'stores', 'farms', 'business', 'One', 'way', 'was', 'cut', 'off', 'small', 'business', 'owners', 'wholesale', 'distributors', 'banks', 'red-lined', 'small', 'businesses', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'loans', 'needed', 'running', 'business', 'were', 'government', 'loans', 'farmers', 'ranchers', 'then', 'Many', 'films', 'were', 'produced', 'small', 'studios', 'who', 'operated', 'low', 'budget', 'were', 'threatened', 'big', 'movie', 'studios', 'cartel', 'theaters', 'movies', 'were', 'later', 'shown', 'television', 'fill', 'up', 'broadcast', 'schedule', 'way', 'older', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'recycled', 'today', 'Many', 'films', 'were', 'edited', 'television', 'reducing', 'running', 'times', '53', 'minutes', 'can', 'notice', 'loss', 'scenes', 'movies.These', 'movies', 'had', 'little', 'padding', 'have', 'more', 'action', 'longer', 'big', 'studio', 'productions', 'have', 'songs', 'dances', 'entertainment', 'collection', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'movies', 'star', 'who', 'acted', 'wide', 'range', 'roles', 'Gene', 'Autry', 'was', 'best', 'Singing', 'Cowboy', 'other', 'stars', 'are', 'Johnny', 'Mack', 'Brown', 'Buster', 'Crabbe', 'James', 'Newill', 'George', ""O'Brien"", 'Tex', 'Ritter', 'Bob', 'Steele', 'Many', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'little', 'remembered', 'today', 'were', 'real', 'cowboys', 'Tim', 'McCoy', 'Hoot', 'Gibson', 'rodeo', 'riders', 'Ken', 'Maynard', 'formula', 'Three', 'Mesquiteers', 'have', 'inspired', 'Range', 'Busters', 'Rough', 'Riders', 'who', 'played', 'undercover', 'investigators', 'who', 'fought', 'gangs', 'criminals']",Guns of the West 100 Movie Pack
1232303,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B001QY08BK,Annie Van Auken,"[14, 14]","MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT's GUNS OF THE WEST 100 MOVIE PACK is comprised of theirFRONTIER JUSTICE 50 MOVIE PACK(from 2007) and a more recent release,THE WAY WEST 50 MOVIE PACK.Prior to 2008, MCE multi-packs consisted of flip-discs. Their movies are now issued on single-side, dual layer DVDs. Thus, the first half of this set is flip-disc, the second, dual-layer. The collection's durable snapcase is the thickness of a 500 page book.Transfer quality of these unrestored films depends entirely on source material. None are pristine studio quality but rarely are they so bad as to be unviewable. Certainly, the price is right for such a large offering of less-common works.Several of the later Roy Rogers pictures in this collection were originally in ""Trucolor."" The b&w; copies here are probably dubbed from 16mm prints once used on early broadcast TV. Despite this source material limitation, ""Guns of the West"" remains an excellent choice for fans of vintage westerns. It's also a fine introduction for newcomers to the fondly recalled bygone era of western movies series.FOR A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL TITLES, INCLUDINGACTORS AND YEARS OF RELEASE, SEE COMMENT #1 BELOW.",4,100 six-shooters (600 shooters?) in MCEs western movie compilation,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,1173,"['MILL', 'CREEK', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'GUNS', 'THE', 'WEST', '100', 'MOVIE', 'PACK', 'comprised', 'theirFRONTIER', 'JUSTICE', '50', 'MOVIE', 'PACK', '2007', 'more', 'recent', 'release', 'WAY', 'WEST', '50', 'MOVIE', 'PACK.Prior', '2008', 'MCE', 'multi-packs', 'consisted', 'flip-discs', 'movies', 'are', 'now', 'issued', 'single-side', 'dual', 'layer', 'DVDs', 'Thus', 'first', 'half', 'set', 'flip-disc', 'second', 'dual-layer', 'collection', 'durable', 'snapcase', 'thickness', '500', 'page', 'book.Transfer', 'quality', 'unrestored', 'films', 'entirely', 'source', 'material', 'None', 'are', 'pristine', 'studio', 'quality', 'rarely', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'be', 'unviewable', 'Certainly', 'price', 'right', 'large', 'offering', 'less-common', 'works.Several', 'later', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'collection', 'were', 'originally', 'Trucolor', 'b', 'w', 'copies', 'here', 'are', 'probably', 'dubbed', '16mm', 'prints', 'once', 'used', 'early', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'source', 'material', 'limitation', 'Guns', 'West', 'excellent', 'choice', 'fans', 'vintage', 'westerns', 'also', 'fine', 'introduction', 'newcomers', 'fondly', 'recalled', 'bygone', 'era', 'western', 'movies', 'series.FOR', 'COMPREHENSIVE', 'LIST', 'ALL', 'TITLES', 'INCLUDINGACTORS', 'AND', 'YEARS', 'OF', 'RELEASE', 'SEE', 'COMMENT', '1', 'BELOW']",Guns of the West 100 Movie Pack

This boxed set offers some real gems for western fans.  While I could wish for a little better picture quality they're still very watchable.  I'm not sure if these could be restored to their original pristine condition or not.  I am sure if they were to be restored they would cost a lot more than what they are now.  Some people could afford a much higher price but I for one could not.  So I'm very happy with the set as is and would highly recommend it to everyone.,5,A trip down memory lane.,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,584,"['set', 'great', 'bringing', 'back', 'childhood', 'memories', 'Westerns', 'are', 'true', 'Americana', 'baseball', 'apple', 'pie', 'boxed', 'set', 'real', 'gems', 'western', 'fans', 'could', 'wish', 'little', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', ""'re"", 'still', 'very', 'watchable', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'be', 'restored', 'original', 'pristine', 'condition', 'not', 'am', 'sure', 'were', 'be', 'restored', 'would', 'cost', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'are', 'now', 'people', 'could', 'afford', 'much', 'higher', 'price', 'one', 'could', 'not', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'set', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone']",Guns of the West 100 Movie Pack
