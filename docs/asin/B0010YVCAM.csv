1128182,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B0010YVCAM,Amazon Customer,"[48, 53]","There have been two really great parts to the whole Highlander franchise: the original movie, and the TV series (especially from its second season on, when they introduced the concept of the Watcher organization, and wrote stories about a subgroup of Watcher who developed a religious fanatic-type fear and hatred of immortals, and started hunting them).  Both these version of the Highlander franchise featured great characters, marvellous flashbacks, interesting villains, and dealt with both the positive and negative aspects of immortality, such as unending youth and strength, and the experience of being able to see whole different ages, such as most people can only dream about, balanced off against the loneliness of watching everyone around you age and die, with only a handful of people with whom you can form lasting bonds -- and many of them are out to take your head.  It was thrilling stuff, and as the first movie and series proved, this concept was a rich source from which really great stories could be mined again and again.How sad then that with the exception of that first film, the makers of Highlander movies have failed so dismally.  This movie actually rivals ""Highlander II: the Quickening"" in sheer awfulness, and I hadn't believed that possible.  I had a terrible sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach when I found that this movie was set in a near future where society had broken down into chaos and anarchy.  Why on earth did the producers of this film choose to borrow an element from the worst movie in the entire franchise?  The villain was so ridiculous he wasn't even remotely menacing or scary.  What could EVER make anyone think a villain who yells ""Helloo Joe!"" as he sails through the air hit by a car (in a stupendously unrealistic stunt/special effect) would play well?  This was just one moment among many involving the villain that elicits unintentional laughter.  The guardian was so horrendously, cringe-inducingly bad that if the Kurgan were in this film he would have killed him for bringing villains into disrepute.And of course, on top of a poor story, a laughable villain, and the complete absence of any of the elements that made either the first film or the series a success, this movie suffers from a fault common to all Highlander films but the first: lack of continuity.  Why, if they are going to make these things, do they insist on disregarding everything that came before?  This is really frustrating to those fans who have delved into the world of the Highlander franchise and would like it to make at least some sense, and have some internal consistency.  It's hard to stay interesting in something when they keep changing the ground rules on you.But the above listed flaws barely scratch the surface of what it wrong with this movie.  I read that this was intended to be the first of a trilogy.  All I can say to that is that I hope not.  As much as I am irritated at the lack of consistency and continuity in the Highlander movies, if they're going to do any more, they need to retcon this abortion out of existence.  Having inexplicably copied concepts from the single worse installment of the whole franchise, they should also copy the follow up taken to that movie by the producers of the next one and write a new story that ignores this steaming pile of dog excrement and starts with a blank slate.",1,I wish I could give it no stars,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,3367,"['have', 'been', 'two', 'really', 'great', 'parts', 'whole', 'Highlander', 'franchise', 'original', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'especially', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'introduced', 'concept', 'Watcher', 'organization', 'wrote', 'stories', 'subgroup', 'Watcher', 'who', 'developed', 'religious', 'fanatic-type', 'fear', 'hatred', 'immortals', 'started', 'hunting', 'version', 'Highlander', 'franchise', 'featured', 'great', 'characters', 'marvellous', 'flashbacks', 'interesting', 'villains', 'dealt', 'positive', 'negative', 'aspects', 'immortality', 'such', 'unending', 'youth', 'strength', 'experience', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'whole', 'different', 'ages', 'such', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'about', 'balanced', 'off', 'loneliness', 'watching', 'everyone', 'age', 'die', 'only', 'handful', 'people', 'whom', 'can', 'form', 'lasting', 'bonds', 'many', 'are', 'take', 'head', 'was', 'thrilling', 'stuff', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'proved', 'concept', 'was', 'rich', 'source', 'really', 'great', 'stories', 'could', 'be', 'mined', 'again', 'again.How', 'sad', 'then', 'exception', 'first', 'film', 'makers', 'Highlander', 'movies', 'have', 'failed', 'so', 'dismally', 'movie', 'actually', 'Highlander', 'II', 'Quickening', 'sheer', 'awfulness', 'had', ""n't"", 'believed', 'possible', 'had', 'terrible', 'sinking', 'feeling', 'pit', 'stomach', 'when', 'found', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'near', 'future', 'where', 'society', 'had', 'broken', 'down', 'chaos', 'anarchy', 'Why', 'earth', 'did', 'producers', 'film', 'choose', 'borrow', 'element', 'worst', 'movie', 'entire', 'franchise', 'villain', 'was', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'menacing', 'scary', 'What', 'could', 'EVER', 'make', 'anyone', 'think', 'villain', 'who', 'Helloo', 'Joe', 'air', 'hit', 'car', 'stupendously', 'unrealistic', 'stunt/special', 'effect', 'would', 'play', 'well', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'moment', 'many', 'involving', 'villain', 'unintentional', 'laughter', 'guardian', 'was', 'so', 'horrendously', 'cringe-inducingly', 'bad', 'Kurgan', 'were', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'bringing', 'villains', 'disrepute.And', 'course', 'top', 'poor', 'story', 'laughable', 'villain', 'complete', 'absence', 'elements', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'success', 'movie', 'fault', 'common', 'Highlander', 'films', 'first', 'lack', 'continuity', 'Why', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'things', 'do', 'insist', 'disregarding', 'everything', 'came', 'really', 'frustrating', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'delved', 'world', 'Highlander', 'franchise', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'least', 'sense', 'have', 'internal', 'consistency', 'hard', 'stay', 'interesting', 'something', 'when', 'keep', 'changing', 'ground', 'rules', 'above', 'listed', 'flaws', 'barely', 'scratch', 'surface', 'what', 'wrong', 'movie', 'read', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'first', 'trilogy', 'can', 'say', 'hope', 'not', 'As', 'much', 'am', 'irritated', 'lack', 'consistency', 'continuity', 'Highlander', 'movies', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'more', 'need', 'retcon', 'abortion', 'existence', 'Having', 'inexplicably', 'copied', 'concepts', 'single', 'worse', 'installment', 'whole', 'franchise', 'should', 'also', 'copy', 'follow', 'up', 'taken', 'movie', 'producers', 'next', 'one', 'write', 'new', 'story', 'steaming', 'pile', 'dog', 'excrement', 'blank', 'slate']",Highlander 5

The original film was a classic, and the second film we don't really acknowledge. The third film was decent, and the fourth was just okay. But this one...I'm embarassed that 'Highlander' is in the title.Adrian Paul reprises his role of the Highlander Duncan MacLeod, who gave five (okay four good ones) seasons of stories to the character on ""Highlander: The Series."" What makes this movie so bad is the story, the effects, the acting, the visuals, pretty much just about everything. First of all, Highlander is about the sword. Half way through the movie Duncan tosses his sword aside and starts using two big knives to fight with instead. There was no point to this and it really made character cheap. When Joe Dawson is killed (a beloved character from the series), nobody really seems to care. There's no introduction to Joe, so if you haven't seen the series, you have no idea who this guy is and why it's important that he was killed.The story takes place in this strange post apocalyptic future where a band of international immortals try to discover why they are immortal. When you can look up into the sky and actually see the solar system aligning, you know there's issues with the story. It seemed like the only point to this story was to find a loophole to allow Duncan MacLeod to have children. That's the only point to the entire story.I could go on for days about how bad this film is, but why bother. Don't buy it, don't rent it, just get your fill of Highlander from all the other films (just watch #1 and #4) and hours of television and don't waste your time on this one.

1128185,A2SPVJ5NYCOY00,B0010YVCAM,Antoinette Avalon,"[6, 12]","This was not a bad movie.  It could probably stand on its own as a science fiction action movie if it was not a Highlander movie but the fact is that it was supposed to be and therefore I can see why die-hard fans appear to be rejecting it.  This review will be full of spoilers because I will be attempting to objectively point out the problems that I believe led to what appears to be a full scale rejection of the movie by Highlander fans while at the same time providing an overview of the movie plot.The story line I believe was intended to be very life affirming and highlighting Duncan MacLeod's virtues.  Unfortunately, the story line was not consistent with the mythology already created by the television series The Highlander.  We start the movie with the earth having fallen into a state that resembles the apocalypse with Duncan brooding and apparently aimlessly drifting, providing random acts of compassion in defending the weak without any of the fire we expect from Duncan MacLeod.  We learn Duncan's ""problem"" is his mortal wife left him.Understandably, the writers were looking for a reason for Duncan to be less than the man we remember so he can find himself again since that was to be a driving force in this story.  Unfortunately, Duncan brooding and falling into a depression over a woman leaving him is inconsistent with the Duncan MacLeod we know from The Highlander.  He didn't grieve this much when his wife Tessa was shot to death.  Moreover, the reason this woman leaves him is patently ridiculous.  In an apocalyptic world, this woman is so obsessed with having a baby she leaves Duncan because he can't give her a child.  This makes zero sense.  Even if somebody was insane enough to want to have a baby while the world is completely falling apart, there are always options and leaving the person you love over their inability to produce an heir is thinking one would have thought people would have left behind long ago.  The premise here is this woman would rather wander alone through the chaos in the streets than be with the man she loves because he can't produce a child.  Hello.  Who dreamed that one up?Nonetheless, the writers had a specific goal in mind with this one so they pressed forward and as I originally stated; if there was no mythology already in place one might be able to live with the ridiculousness of the events that lead to the hero and heroines separation.  With the mythology firmly in place, the movie is already getting off to a shaky start.We move along in the story to bring Duncan back together with his friend (and character much loved by the fans), Methos.  Methos is now part of a small band of immortals who believe in the source even though they have no idea what it is actually supposed to do or where to look.  The former watcher, Joe Dawson, likewise believes in the source and convinces Duncan to join Methos and his men in their search, even though Duncan himself doesn't believe in the source.  Enter Duncan's ex-wife, who is supposed to be having visions about the source and Duncan is firmly committed to seeing this quest through, only to insure his ex-wife's safety.To get this far in the story we have already had various graphically violent scenes; blood spurting, heads rolling down staircases, etc.  This is great action movie stuff but quite a bit more graphic than we are used to in Highlander films and it continues throughout the film.We move along in this quest and indulge in yet more violence.  Joe Dawson is killed by a powerful immortal who was altered by his contact with the source at some time in the past.  This immortal is doomed to defend the source and is physically altered and psychologically pure evil.  He is also the perpetrator of 50-75% of the violence in the movie.  Killing of key members of the cast is usually accepted as a mistake in ongoing stories and one would have thought the writers of Highlander material would have learned their lesson with the debacle created by the death of the much beloved character Richie towards the end of the Highlander television series.  Nonetheless, less than half way through the movie we kill off a principle.  Seems kind of like sequel suicide, doesn't it?We plough forward.  It turns out the closer the immortals come to the source they become more mortal.  Our resident defender of the source torments our heroes at every turn, curiously not appearing to be particularly affected as they grow closer to the source.  He brutally fillets (there's no other word for it, he slices him up like fruit; the writers do like the graphic violence in this movie) one of the immortals who dies from his wounds and doesn't come back to life, presumably because the immortals are mortal so close to the source.  Kudos to the writers here, they didn't behead the guy.  We've left lots of room for him to take longer than expected to regenerate and hop out of his grave.  He established himself quickly as a quite loveable immortal and his permanent loss would be a waste.  The only way we can resurrect good old Joe Dawson is if it turns out he really was an immortal and for some unforeseeable reason the others couldn't sense it.  It's still a viable way out but not consistent with the mythology . . . but since it's something the fans would LIKE I expect they'd accept that deviation.At any rate, what's left of our little band after the reenactment of Jack the Ripper is Duncan, Methos, an immortal priest and Duncan's ex-wife and they plough forward towards the source and presumably to the defeat of the defender of the source.Far fetched is the name of this game so our little band is then snatched up by cannibals and trussed up on display, awaiting their turn to be barbequed.  The defender of the source comes along and takes Duncan's ex-wife with him, says he's taking her to the source.  This miraculously goes unnoticed by their captors as does the fact that the scaffolding their victims are tied to has caught fire.Mythology for the Highlander well established Methos' love for Duncan MacLeod.  He risked life and limb multiple times for Duncan.  Methos had become a very enlightened and educated man, far exceeding what one might expect of a man 5000 years old who had lived for centuries with violence.  The fans love Methos as Duncan's right hand man.  Throughout this movie Methos shows uncharacteristic self centered behavior and a certain disregard of Duncan.  Towards the end this becomes so far out of character as to be ridiculous if one is attempting to string this story to the rest of the Highlander genre.  The immortal priest frees himself first when the fire burns through his ropes and he suddenly goes nuts and declares he has been chosen and runs off into the night leaving his comrades to their fate (seems a little far fetched coming from a man who until that moment had not come across as a radical).  Methos throws some insults after the retreating man and meanwhile Duncan frees himself and immediately sets about freeing Methos.  OK, HERE IT GETS REALLY OFF CHARACTER.  Methos tells Duncan, ""I would have left you."" as Duncan unties him.Away they go into the woods to rescue the woman and save the day and naturally the cannibals are in pursuit.  They don't get too far before they see the priest has been captured.  Methos advises Duncan to leave him but of course Duncan can't.  Another great battle ensues and once the dust settles Methos suddenly does a 180 and becomes the martyr.  He takes the horse of one of the fallen men and tells Duncan he wanted to be the one but Duncan is and extols upon Duncan's virtues then rides off to lure their pursuers off of Duncan so he can rescue his ex.  In Highlander mythology, Methos often had declared Duncan as the best there had ever been and too important to loose so while his helping Duncan towards the end is in character, the overall attitude leading up to that moment, including Methos wanting to be the one, really isn't.So off Duncan goes to rescue the damsel in distress (OK, that's normal for Highlander).  He arrives and an epic battle ensures (again, expected in Highlander).  Ultimately Duncan bests the defender (expected for Highlander) and refuses to kill him because he's ""done"" with killing (a typical Duncan MacLeod moment).  We've just had more moments consistent with the Highlander series in the last five minutes than we had in the entire movie!  Then, we wait, the source, it's happening!  You're not expecting THIS.  THE SOURCE!  It . . . allows Duncan's ex-wife to have his baby.  Yes!  This epic struggle made her conceive.  Why are you laughing?  :o)  I totally understand what the writers were going for.  An immortal has a child, they can't have children, it's a big deal but PLEASE.  We go to the ends of the earth, loose numerous lives, this power is so special it requires a defender and the unworthy can't touch it . . . because the source will allow a human woman to conceive an immortal's child.  It doesn't make any sense.  Is this child going to be the next messiah?  That's probably a storyline the writer's would be wise to avoid.Overall, without the background mythology of Highlander this film would probably be a decent science fiction action film although the source would have been more believable if it was something more like the implications in the original Highlander movie where Connor claims to be connected to all things, larger than life, full of knowledge and power.  That's something Duncan MacLeod could wield like no other with his strong sense of morality and character.  It would be great if it meant the end of the chopping off of heads or something noble like that.  So one immortal can have a baby seems a bit anticlimactic and one has cause for concern where the writers were planning to go with the next installment.If they plan on doing any more Highlander films it would be wise of the writers to go back to the original story and learn what made it beloved by its fans.  Write a movie that truly is in spirit with the noble creature that is Duncan MacLeod.  Make it a movie that can stand alone but respects the mythology that's already in place.  Embrace the human frailties of the immortals but remember they ARE immortal.  It's the strength of the immortals like Duncan and Methos that can embrace life and celebrate it in spite of the hardships immortality affords them that makes the Highlander interesting.  Anything else turns them into mere mortals and then they become like any other action hero.  Respect the original mythology; THAT'S the movie that will bring the audience home!",3,Attempting Objectivity Here,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,10582,"['was', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'could',

Now I really thought about this - and I cannot think of another way the story line could have possibly come to fruition, other than Duncan, the Immortal who cared for people as well as his fellow Immortals, to play out. He always wanted a child, was devastated when his two other true loves died, and of all the characters, he deserved his heart's desire. He deserved to be with the woman he loved and have an end in the future to his living - this immortality business made me really think how horrible that option would actually be.

1128198,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B0010YVCAM,Hound Dog,"[7, 8]","In late 2007, I was initially excited to find this direct-to-cable sequel on the Sci-Fi Channel to ""Highlander: The Series,"" with Adrian Paul (as MacLeod), Jim Byrnes (as Dawson), and Peter Wingfield (as Methos) all returning in their respective roles.  After both the box office failure of 2000's ""Highlander 4: Endgame,"" and Elizabeth Gracen's short-lived ""Highlander: The Raven"" tv series a decade ago, my curiosity was piqued to see how the ""Highlander"" franchise could be resurrected once more.Suffice to say, I was very disappointed (but not surprised) by the wretched outcome.  While consistent with ""Highlander""'s big screen history of choppy rock video-style editing and at times poor storyline coherency, this fifth installment, unfortunately, hits a new all-time low for the 22-year old franchise in both categories.  I won't go into this abysmal film's failures to any great extent (as other reviewers already have done so well), but let me say that ""Highlander: The Source"" completely wasted the opportunity of renewing hope that Adrian Paul's character would still lead the franchise into the future.Unfortunately, according to this movie, what the future really means is a cheap, dismal ""Road Warrior"" knock-off that abandons all of the previous swashbuckling grandeur, inventive time-traveling flashbacks, and exuberant romantic charm that creator Gregory Widen originally envisioned and which later made Adrian Paul's tv series endure for six years.  So why did the producers, including Mr. Paul, choose to pursue this radically different, albeit dubious, premise (i.e. ""Highlander"" meets ""Def-Con 4"")?My guess is at least part of the answer can be found in the virtually constant darkness depicted in the film.  The darkness wasn't just for ambiance's sake; rather, it was supposed to help disguise the low budget and deficient production values (such as the grade-Z screenwriting).  The movie, as a result, comes off like a mindless, goth-violent video game that appeals only to hard-core fans of sci-fi/fantasy schlock.  Sadly, it also pretty much chokes the remaining life out of ""Highlander""'s rapidly dwindling fanbase.Now, let me provide my take on the film's central theme: what really is the enigmatic source of immortality?  The film's final sequence is hardly a shocker, but presenting the idea of human reproduction as the ultimate answer reminded me of the mediocre 1989 ""Star Trek V""'s all too simplistic attempt to explain where God truly is.  In other words, it is beyond insulting to suggest to intelligent viewers that they don't already know the obvious ""source,"" but perhaps even more so, that the answer must still be spelled out for them.In summation, I would have much preferred a direct continuation of ""Highlander 4: Endgame,"" or even an improved reworking of ""Highlander 2: The Quickening""'s futuristic world.  The poorly-produced fifth ""Highlander"" film instead, much like the gloomy future Earth it depicts, makes Duncan MacLeod's prospects for a sixth installment seem far more grim (whether he is played by Adrian Paul or a successor).  If this indeed the end for Duncan MacLeod, at least the producers finally allow him to embark on real life's greatest adventure (parenthood).Movie Grade: F + (it seems fitting for what little spark this movie has).",1,Highlander: The Source (of a Truly Awful Movie),1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,3298,"['late', '2007', 'was', 'initially', 'excited', 'find', 'direct-to-cable', 'sequel', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Highlander', 'Series', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'MacLeod', 'Jim', 'Byrnes', 'Dawson', 'Peter', 'Wingfield', 'Methos', 'returning', 'respective', 'roles', 'box', 'office', 'failure', '2000', 'Highlander', '4', 'Endgame', 'Elizabeth', 'Gracen', 'short-lived', 'Highlander', 'Raven', 'tv', 'series', 'decade', 'ago', 'curiosity', 'was', 'piqued', 'see', 'how', 'Highlander', 'franchise', 'could', 'be', 'resurrected', 'once', 'more.Suffice', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'not', 'surprised', 'wretched', 'outcome', 'consistent', 'Highlander', 'big', 'screen', 'history', 'choppy', 'rock', 'video-style', 'editing', 'times', 'poor', 'storyline', 'coherency', 'fifth', 'installment', 'unfortunately', 'new', 'all-time', 'low', '22-year', 'old', 'franchise', 'categories', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'abysmal', 'film', 'failures', 'great', 'extent', 'other', 'reviewers', 'already', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'Highlander', 'Source', 'completely', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'renewing', 'hope', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'character', 'would', 'still', 'lead', 'franchise', 'future.Unfortunately', 'according', 'movie', 'what', 'future', 'really', 'cheap', 'dismal', 'Road', 'Warrior', 'knock-off', 'previous', 'swashbuckling', 'grandeur', 'inventive', 'time-traveling', 'flashbacks', 'exuberant', 'romantic', 'charm', 'creator', 'Gregory', 'Widen', 'originally', 'envisioned', 'later', 'made', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'tv', 'series', 'endure', 'six', 'years', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'producers', 'including', 'Mr.', 'Paul', 'choose', 'pursue', 'radically', 'different', 'albeit', 'dubious', 'premise', 'i.e', 'Highlander', 'Def-Con', '4', 'guess', 'least', 'part', 'answer', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'virtually', 'constant', 'darkness', 'depicted', 'film', 'darkness', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'ambiance', 'sake', 'rather', 'was', 'supposed', 'help', 'disguise', 'low', 'budget', 'deficient', 'production', 'values', 'such', 'grade-Z', 'screenwriting', 'movie', 'result', 'mindless', 'goth-violent', 'video', 'game', 'appeals', 'only', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'schlock', 'Sadly', 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'remaining', 'life', 'Highlander', 'rapidly', 'dwindling', 'fanbase.Now', 'let', 'provide', 'take', 'film', 'central', 'theme', 'what', 'really', 'enigmatic', 'source', 'immortality', 'film', 'final', 'sequence', 'hardly', 'shocker', 'presenting', 'idea', 'human', 'reproduction', 'ultimate', 'answer', 'reminded', 'mediocre', '1989', 'Star', 'Trek', 'V', 'too', 'simplistic', 'attempt', 'explain', 'where', 'God', 'truly', 'other', 'words', 'insulting', 'suggest', 'intelligent', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'obvious', 'source', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'answer', 'must', 'still', 'be', 'spelled', 'out', 'them.In', 'summation', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'direct', 'continuation', 'Highlander', '4', 'Endgame', 'even', 'improved', 'reworking', 'Highlander', '2', 'Quickening', 'futuristic', 'world', 'poorly-produced', 'fifth', 'Highlander', 'film', 'instead', 'much', 'gloomy', 'future', 'Earth', 'Duncan', 'MacLeod', 'prospects', 'sixth', 'installment', 'seem', 'far', 'more', 'grim', 'played', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'successor', 'indeed', 'end', 'Duncan', 'MacLeod', 'least', 'producers', 'finally', 'allow', 'embark', 'real', 'life', 'greatest', 'adventure', 'parenthood', '.Movie', 'Grade', 'F', '+', 'fitting', 'what', 'little', 'spark', 'movie']",Highlander 5

I only spent $1 to rent it, which was too much, not to mention 80 minutes of my life were wasted. If I owned this DVD, I would probably burn it and try hard to forget I ever watched it.  I thought Highlander the series, was a great show, with great storylines and outstanding actors and fight sequences.  This movie, lacking any quality, dosen't even resemble any of the previous episodes, except for misplaced dialog between the original characters of the series. Putting Duncan McCloed, Methos, and Joe Dawson in this movie setting and storyline, is like putting Clint Eastwood in a Conan the Barbarian Movie. This movie was so terrible, it may have destroyed the acting careers of otherwise excellent actors of the original series. Peter Windfield and Adrian Paul, what were you thinking... The Director should be shot, before he produces more crappy movies that may destroy the careers of otherwise good actors. The fight scenes in this movie were also terrible enough to be humorous.  Fights were show in fast motion that could only be described as Benny Hill meets the Albino from outer space. The ""bad guy"" known as the ""Guardian"" was so stupid, that I almost laughed myself into a comma watching him.  His scary calling card was ""Hellloooo"", WOW, how original! He talked like he just stepped off the short bus, and looked like a S&M Albino.  The storyline was so stale and uninteresting, that I almost fell asleep before half the movie was over.  I don't think the Director or writers of this movie ever saw a Highlander the Series episode ever, because Duncan and Methos were portrayed more like enemies, than good friends, and the storyline was like a cheap rip off of a already crappy movie called ""Highlander 2"". After watching this piece of trash, it almost ruins my opinions of the characters of the original highlander series, and makes me wish I could erase all memory of seeing the talented Adrian Paul, Peter Winfield, and Jim Byrnes trying to act through this unbearable, ridiculous, twisted lame excuse of a movie written and directed my untalented dullards.",1,"""Highlander The Worst"", would have been a better title!",1212710400,"06 6, 2008",2008,2230,"['reading', 'terrible', 'quite', 'humorous', 'expected', 'movie', 'be', 'real', 'piece', 'crap', 'guess', 'what', 'lived', 'up', 'only', 'spent', '1', 'rent', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'mention', '80', 'minutes', 'life', 'were', 'wasted', 'owned', 'DVD', 'would', 'probably', 'burn', 'try', 'hard', 'forget', 'ever', 'watched', 'thought', 'Highlander', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'great', 'storylines', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'fight', 'sequences', 'movie', 'lacking', 'quality', 'dose', ""n't"", 'even', 'resemble', 'previous', 'episodes', 'misplaced', 'dialog', 'original', 'characters', 'series', 'Putting', 'Duncan', 'McCloed', 'Methos', 'Joe', 'Dawson', 'movie', 'setting', 'storyline', 'putting', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Movie', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'terrible', 'may', 'have', 'destroyed', 'acting', 'careers', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'actors', 'original', 'series', 'Peter', 'Windfield', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'Director', 'should', 'be', 'shot', 'more', 'crappy', 'movies', 'may', 'destroy', 'careers', 'otherwise', 'good', 'actors', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'also', 'terrible', 'enough', 'be', 'humorous', 'Fights', 'were', 'show', 'fast', 'motion', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'Albino', 'outer', 'space', 'bad', 'guy', 'known', 'Guardian', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'almost', 'laughed', 'comma', 'watching', 'scary', 'calling', 'card', 'was', 'Hellloooo', 'WOW', 'how', 'original', 'talked', 'just', 'stepped', 'off', 'short', 'bus', 'looked', 'S', 'M', 'Albino', 'storyline', 'was', 'so', 'stale', 'uninteresting', 'almost', 'fell', 'asleep', 'movie', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Director', 'writers', 'movie', 'ever', 'saw', 'Highlander', 'Series', 'episode', 'ever', 'Duncan', 'Methos', 'were', 'portrayed', 'more', 'like', 'enemies', 'good', 'friends', 'storyline', 'was', 'cheap', 'rip', 'already', 'crappy', 'movie', 'called', '2', 'watching', 'piece', 'trash', 'almost', 'opinions', 'characters', 'original', 'highlander', 'series', 'wish', 'could', 'erase', 'memory', 'seeing', 'talented', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'Peter', 'Winfield', 'Jim', 'Byrnes', 'trying', 'act', 'unbearable', 'ridiculous', 'twisted', 'lame', 'excuse', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'untalented', 'dullards']",Highlander 5

Here they had a movie franchise of very loyal fans that would have watched almost anything with the name *Highlander* attached to it.  Somehow, they managed to destroy that.  This movie might very well be the guide to how to destroy a movie cash-cow.Since most of the people who have watched the last quartet of Highlander sequels are hardcore fans, it's no surprise that that's mostly who sought out the latest sequel.  And they decided, after a half dozen movies, to apparently target this movie towards people who know nothing about the Highlander story.  I liked the firstHighlanderbut I am more of a casual fan.  Regardless, I can see where hard-core fans are coming from with their low ratings.Recounting the plot is almost a complete waste of time.  Like all Highlander movies, the various immortals are in factions battling it out to be *the one*.  There are also some added story elements that involve the universe shifting for the ultimate showdown.  The story attempts to weave all the sub-plots of the prior movies and tie them all into the conclusion of the movie.Part of the intrigue with the original movie was the mystery and magic surrounding the premise.  After all it is a fantasy movie, albeit one with a deeper premise than others.  Explaining why and how there are immortals and why they battle each other for power is a hard sell.  Leaving some of those things unsaid allowed fans to *fill in the blanks*.Still, here not only have they decided to repeat lots of the back-story, to the point of nausea, they also decided that it was necessary to explain ALL the mysteries of the series and tie them in a neat little bow.Overall they alienate core fans with this technique in two ways.  First of all, many of the details of the series seem to be contradicted by some of what is done to conclude this movie. And second of all, all of the joy and mystery of the franchise has been eliminated by an oversimplified ending.  But even still, getting there is not enjoyable because the dialogue and plot development are sub-par.Another thing that makes this movie difficult to swallow are special effects that can only be described as lacking.  In fact, some of the make-up and costumes make some of these characters look more comical than immortal.  One of the characters (if you watch it, see if you can guess which one) looks as if he is wearing some kind of cheap wig.Like I said, I liked the first Highlander, but wasn't a religious follower of all the sequels.  The whole ""There can be only one"" theme seems to contradict the idea of six sequels to me.  Still, some of those follow-up movies weren't bad, even with new actors and other changes. But this one almost feels like a completely different group of people were involved at every step of the process.ConclusionIf you know nothing about Highlander or the back story and just want something to kill two hours with, this movie might satisfy your needs for mindless entertainment.  Those who are looking for unintended humor might find something to like here too, though it's not universally bad start to finish.If you are demanding and picky with sci-fi or fantasy movies and frequently notice when mistakes make it harder for you to accept the fantasy, you will probably want to avoid this.  And if you are a die-hard fan of the Highlander series, you definitely want to avoid this one.  Though it might be tempting to see it, it will only upset you.Avoid.",2,Highlander - The Source - How To Kill A Franchise,1226448000,"11 12, 2008",2008,3541,"['Highlander', 'Sourceis', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'studied', 'film', 'business', 'master', 'degree', 'programs', 'eventually', 'Here', 'had', 'movie', 'franchise', 'very', 'loyal', 'fans', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'almost', 'anything', 'name', '*Highlander*', 'attached', 'Somehow', 'managed', 'destroy', 'movie', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'guide', 'how', 'destroy', 'movie', 'cash-cow.Since', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'last', 'quartet', 'Highlander', 'sequels', 'are', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'surprise', 'mostly', 'who', 'sought', 'out', 'latest', 'sequel', 'decided', 'half', 'dozen', 'movies', 'apparently', 'target', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'Highlander', 'story', 'liked', 'firstHighlanderbut', 'am', 'more', 'casual', 'fan', 'Regardless', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'are', 'coming', 'low', 'ratings.Recounting', 'plot', 'almost', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'Highlander', 'movies', 'various', 'immortals', 'are', 'factions', 'battling', 'be', '*the', 'one*', 'are', 'also', 'added', 'story', 'elements', 'involve', 'universe', 'shifting', 'ultimate', 'showdown', 'story', 'attempts', 'weave', 'sub-plots', 'prior', 'movies', 'tie', 'conclusion', 'movie.Part', 'intrigue', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'mystery', 'magic', 'surrounding', 'premise', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'one', 'deeper', 'premise', 'others', 'Explaining', 'why', 'how', 'are', 'immortals', 'why', 'battle', 'other', 'power', 'hard', 'sell', 'Leaving', 'things', 'unsaid', 'allowed', 'fans', '*fill', 'blanks*.Still', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'decided', 'repeat', 'lots', 'back-story', 'point', 'nausea', 'also', 'decided', 'was', 'necessary', 'explain', 'mysteries', 'series', 'tie', 'neat', 'little', 'bow.Overall', 'alienate', 'core', 'fans', 'technique', 'two', 'ways', 'First', 'all', 'many', 'details', 'series', 'seem', 'be', 'contradicted', 'what', 'done', 'conclude', 'movie', 'second', 'joy', 'mystery', 'franchise', 'been', 'eliminated', 'oversimplified', 'ending', 'even', 'still', 'getting', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'development', 'are', 'sub-par.Another', 'thing', 'movie', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'lacking', 'fact', 'make-up', 'costumes', 'make', 'characters', 'look', 'more', 'comical', 'immortal', 'One', 'characters', 'watch', 'see', 'can', 'guess', 'one', 'wearing', 'kind', 'cheap', 'wig.Like', 'said', 'liked', 'first', 'Highlander', 'was', ""n't"", 'religious', 'follower', 'sequels', 'whole', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'theme', 'contradict', 'idea', 'six', 'sequels', 'Still', 'follow-up', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'new', 'actors', 'other', 'changes', 'one', 'almost', 'feels', 'completely', 'different', 'group', 'people', 'were', 'involved', 'step', 'process.ConclusionIf', 'know', 'nothing', 'Highlander', 'back', 'story', 'just', 'want', 'something', 'kill', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'might', 'satisfy', 'needs', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'unintended', 'humor', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'here', 'too', 'not', 'universally', 'bad', 'start', 'finish.If', 'are', 'demanding', 'picky', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'frequently', 'notice', 'when', 'mistakes', 'make', 'harder', 'accept', 'fantasy', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'avoid', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'Highlander', 'series', 'definitely', 'want', 'avoid', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'tempting', 'see', 'will', 'only', 'upset', 'you.Avoid']",Highlander 5

The other movies I've seen major scenes of and can safely say they aren't all that good. I still need to check out the TV series, as I hear it' s fun cheesy 90's show. I can say that I am a big fan of the first Highlander movie. It's not a perfect film by any means, but it's still a fun fantasy action movie. It helps that the story keeps it pretty simple and doesn't go into where the immortals come from (we've seen what happens when they try to explain where they came from). And while it gives me a chuckle to see Sean Connery playing an Egyptian who's pretending to be Spanish, and then we got French actor Christopher Lambert trying to do a Scottish Accent the movie still has a lot of heart to it. Part of that not only comes from the writing, but also the wonderful direction by Russell Mulcahy, and overall good performances by the cast (and we can all agree that Clancy Brown as the Kurgen is one of the most entertaining movie villains).And then there is The Source...What in God's holy name where these people thinking!? Seriously! It's as if they watched the original movies, hated it, and wanted to do all they could to drag it through the grime of the earth! I know so many others have said something like this, but I just had to vent my frustrations of how awful this movie is. Nothing about it makes sense! The whole planets coming so close to the earth is laughable, and it would cause horrific things to happen with this many planets that close to us. The acting is...uhhhhhhhggggg! The two worst characters in this entire mess are of course the Guardian and the priest guy Giovanni. Both have their own stupid look (Giovanni with his weird slicked hair and the Guardian who looks like Krato's retarded brother) and then there's just their personalities. First you go the Guardian, who is the least intimidating villain I have ever seen! He just mugs at the camera and says stupid one liners. Seriously, Jacob Kell was a better villain if only for the fact of how unintentionally hilarious Bruce Payne is. Giovanni is just an idiot! He is this cliched man of the cloth, talking about the newly mortal immortals dying because their faith isn't pure! Nothing against faith, but these are guys who know that non Catholic immortals have roamed the earth for eons now. The character Methos was one of the four horseman of the apocalypse! This whole ""He didn't heal because his faith wasn't pure"" just doesn't make sense in context with this series. The whole post apocalyptic setting just adds nothing to the story and the cannibal sub plot sounds like it would've made for a better movie. And I don't need to go into the raping of the Queen songs.And the ending is the most insulting of all! The prize is to have babies!? Sure, making life is all fine and dandy, but it is so empty and hallow in this situation. It's especially hallow when the character of Anna had no development and you never once cared if Duncan and her lived happily ever after. That they make it so all the fighting and sacrificing was totally pointless! That apparently it was all about just being pure of heart and some other Care Bears nonsense. There's also the fact that this Source was never mentioned in any of the movies or in the entire six year run of the TV show (I may have not seen the show yet, but I know that this whole finding the Source was made up for this pile of puke).

Durham ""Big Evil""","[76, 83]","If you thought the original cut of Highlander II was bad, just wait until you see Highlander: The Source, the fifth (and hopefully final) installment in the beloved series.  The Source begins sometime in the distant future (*yawn*) as Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), Methos (Peter Wingfield), Duncan's ex-wife Anna (Thekla Reuten), Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes), and a small band of immortals seek out ""the source"", which is said to be the origin place of the immortals.  Standing in their way is the demonic Guardian (Cristian Solimeno), who is supposedly an all-powerful immortal that picks off our heroes one by one, leading to the inevitable showdown between him and Duncan.  What ends up being the most infuriating about The Source for Highlander fans is how much the film ends up going against the mythology of the series, as well as Duncan and other character's motivations for seeking out ""the source"".  The Jabba the Hutt lookalike in the film doesn't exactly help things out either, and the film as a whole is just one big jumbled mess, thanks to the lackluster, sloppily edited direction from Brett Leonard (Lawnmower Man, Man-Thing), and a cover-themed edition of the original Highlander soundtrack to boot (the version of ""Who Wants to Live Forever?"" is more annoying than anything else) just all amount to the worst sequel the series has ever seen.  Adrian Paul seems to sleep through the film, and the ending is, well, see it for yourself if you're a Highlander fan, and decide which part of the film is the worst.  All in all, Highlander: The Source is beyond bad, and no matter how much of a Highlander fan you may be, this should be avoided.

White,"[4, 4]","This mess of a movie is a faux-cyberpunk version of the Highlander by way of a goth-metal adrenaline rush (throwing in some cannibals and Bugs Bunny routines for good measure). It comes to us from Lionsgate Films who have acquired the rights to the Highlander property and plan to use this movie as a starting point to relaunch the franchise. Based on what I've seen, though, it looks like they are more likely to sink it.This movie was actually completed in 2006 and a rough copy circulated in Europe early in 2007 to harsh reviews. Lionsgate spent some time retooling the movie then decided to forgo a theatrical release and instead premiere it on the Sci Fi Channel as a ""Sci Fi Original Movie"" (in place of the usual Saturday night critters-on-the-rampage fare). I never saw the rough cut, but I can't imagine how it could have been much worse than what made it to the final version.The movie takes place in the near future after civilization has collapsed. There is actually little elaboration on what brought about the collapse, this just provides the backdrop for several immortals' quest for the nebulous Source; supposedly the key to their power. Adrian Paul returns from the Highlander TV Series as Duncan MacLeod (and sleepwalks through the role) along with Peter Wingfield as Methos and Jim Byrnes as the Watcher Joe Dawson. They are joined by two immortals Zai Jie and Cardinal Giovanni as well as Duncan's latest girlfriend, Anna Teshemka. This group must do battle with another immortal, the Guardian, who I think is supposed to be guarding the Source and who looks like the cover of a bad heavy metal album come to life. The narrative of the movie is so disjointed and incoherent that I definitely lost track of the motivations driving each person to this Source thing. And by the end of the movie I didn't care and actually regretted my decision to stick it through to the ending credits.The Highlander movies have actually been a mixed bag at best. Even the first movie which launched the franchise was only good not great. It was the television series, which ran in syndication for six years starring Adrian Paul, which best represented the franchise. Now, this new attempt to relaunch the Highlander series is equally as misguided as the sequel to the first movie, 1991's dreadful Highlander: The Quickening.If you are jonesing for the adventures of the Duncan or Connor Macleod, go back and revisit the series or the first movie on DVD. But definitely don't waste your time with this poor excuse to milk a few more dollars out of the Highlander name.John J.

1128216,AWGPEXO9M8R7Q,B0010YVCAM,Stephen M. Sturgeon,"[1, 1]","The Highlander movies have always been something of a crapshoot. The first one was a classic. The second one was universally panned. The third you either loved it or hated it.The fourth (Endgame) was probably the only sequel that many would agree as being worthy of the original. At the very least it was better than the other sequels and seemed to get the movie's back on track to being something that's worthwhile.Unfortunately, The Source is a drastic step back. I would dare to say that it's even worse than Highlander 2 (a movie that I myself gave one star to in my review only because Amazon doesn't allow for less).What made this movie so bad that I would rate it as being worse than even the most panned Highlander film ever created?The photography has the color washed out much in the style of Crow II City of Angels. It's very hard to look at and gave me a headache just looking at it.The action just didn't work well. Most of the scenes with the Guardian were cat and mouse (pounce you're dead) scenes that had very little actual fighting. The few scenes that had actual sword fighting were mostly obscured in odd special effects that made the actors look like they were zipping around all over the place when in reality they were standing static with only the minimum of arm movement.This is a movie franchise that is based in sword fighting. The sword fighting should be well-choreographed fights that thrill the audience, not static shots with shadow trails that give the illusion of movement.The plot was also thin. It amounted to `follow her, she knows where to go.' `Let's go here.' Fight sequence. `Let's go here.' Fight sequence. Rinse, lather, repeat. You needn't worry about too many spoilers, because that's the whole movie right there.I was really hoping I'd enjoy this. After Highlander Endgame, I honestly thought that the franchise was finally going somewhere I could appreciate. But then they follow it up with this. I never thought I'd say this, but if this is all Hollywood is willing to give us from now on with the Highlander series, I'd just as soon they drop it.",1,Worst of the series (which is saying a lot),1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,2095,"['Highlander', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'something', 'crapshoot', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'classic', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'universally', 'panned', 'third', 'loved', 'hated', 'it.The', 'fourth', 'Endgame', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'sequel', 'many', 'would', 'agree', 'being', 'worthy', 'original', 'very', 'least', 'was', 'better', 'other', 'sequels', 'seemed', 'get', 'movie', 'back', 'track', 'being', 'something', 'worthwhile.Unfortunately', 'Source', 'drastic', 'step', 'back', 'would', 'dare', 'say', 'even', 'worse', 'Highlander', '2', 'movie', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'only', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'allow', 'less', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'would', 'rate', 'being', 'worse', 'even', 'most', 'panned', 'Highlander', 'film', 'ever', 'created', 'photography', 'color', 'washed', 'out', 'much', 'style', 'Crow', 'II', 'City', 'Angels', 'very', 'hard', 'look', 'gave', 'headache', 'just', 'looking', 'it.The', 'action', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'Most', 'scenes', 'Guardian', 'were', 'cat', 'mouse', 'pounce', ""'re"", 'dead', 'scenes', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'fighting', 'few', 'scenes', 'had', 'actual', 'sword', 'fighting', 'were', 'mostly', 'obscured', 'odd', 'special', 'effects', 'made', 'actors', 'look', 'were', 'zipping', 'around', 'place', 'when', 'reality', 'were', 'standing', 'static', 'only', 'minimum', 'arm', 'movement.This', 'movie', 'franchise', 'based', 'sword', 'fighting', 'sword', 'fighting', 'should', 'be', 'well-choreographed', 'fights', 'thrill', 'audience', 'not', 'static', 'shots', 'shadow', 'trails', 'give', 'illusion', 'movement.The', 'plot', 'was', 'also', 'thin', 'amounted', 'follow', 'her', 'where', 'go', 'Let', 'go', 'here', 'Fight', 'sequence', 'Let', 'go', 'here', 'Fight', 'sequence', 'Rinse', 'lather', 'repeat', 'need', ""n't"", 'worry', 'about', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'whole', 'movie', 'right', 'there.I', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'Highlander', 'Endgame', 'honestly', 'thought', 'franchise', 'was', 'finally', 'going', 'somewhere', 'could', 'appreciate', 'then', 'follow', 'up', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'say', 'Hollywood', 'willing', 'give', 'now', 'Highlander', 'series', ""'d"", 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'drop']",Highlander 5

This film finds immortal Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul of the ""Highlander"" TV series) and a band of Immortal warriors on a quest to find the Holy Grail of Immortality. It was originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films detailing the origins of the Immortals.The film as presented on this DVD is a decent effort. The plot and story are interesting, the acting is fine, and the visual effects are great. What messes the film up is the editing. This 86-minute version takes  a number of scenes out of the 94-minute Russian version, and those scenes are sorely missed. However, the interesting story elements and performances make up for a lot.As a ""Highlander"" fan, I enjoyed ""The Source,"" even though it is far from a perfect film. Hopefully, this will not be the final nail in the coffin for this franchise. While most fans will find it disappointing, it is definitely a unique and fascinating entry into the series.Movie/DVD Grade: B",4,A DECENT EFFORT.,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,1041,"['Highlander', 'Source', 'latest', 'installment', 'what', 'been', 'hit-and-miss', 'film', 'franchise', 'film', 'immortal', 'Duncan', 'MacLeod', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'Highlander', 'TV', 'series', 'band', 'Immortal', 'warriors', 'quest', 'find', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Immortality', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'first', 'trilogy', 'films', 'detailing', 'origins', 'Immortals.The', 'film', 'as', 'presented', 'DVD', 'decent', 'effort', 'plot', 'story', 'are', 'interesting', 'acting', 'fine', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'What', 'film', 'up', 'editing', '86-minute', 'version', 'number', 'scenes', '94-minute', 'Russian', 'version', 'scenes', 'are', 'sorely', 'missed', 'However', 'interesting', 'story', 'elements', 'performances', 'make', 'up', 'lot.As', 'Highlander', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'Source', 'even', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'franchise', 'most', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'disappointing', 'definitely', 'unique', 'fascinating', 'entry', 'series.Movie/DVD', 'Grade', 'B']",Highlander 5

I know one thing for sure though, there are many episodes from the series that were better than this film.  BUT with that being said, I get what the producers were trying to do by taking the HIGHLANDER mythology into a different direction.  I mean with all the stories that take place in the highlander mythos, it seems to me that with the exception of HIGHLANDER VENGEANCE, the highlander stories that take place in the future do not really do so well...Example?  Highlander 2! Highlander The Source, even the idea for shooting the sixth season taking place in the future was scrapped.  Although it looks good on paper, people don't seem to be interested on the life of an immortal living in the future.  We only care about their lives in the present or their place during history.  Anyway, I'm probably not gonna buy this dvd, cause I'm sure theres going to be a new cut coming out within the year or near FUTURE.  The story was mildly interesting, but if they continue with the two sequels after this, I might appreciate this film more.  But they need to hire some better writers...I mean, honestly im sure any real FAN could have done a better job.  The action was blah compared to ENDGAME.  There was too much with too little significance going on.  and... yea let's not talk about the ending cause i dont want to spoil it for anyone.  I did enjoy seeing Methos and Duncan on screen again.  People talk about how there shouldnt be any more cause it gets worse everytime.  But! I feel that we have to have another one...a REAL GOOD ONE to make up for the last....4 movies and Highlander the Raven....and dare i say it? the Animated series as well hahaha.
