1598814,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B009LRQUSO,Sheryl Fechter,"[10, 11]","This documentary all about the life of Bradford (Buddy) Clayman is truly a wonder to behold.  What is initially striking is just how personable Buddy is, with all he now must undertake just to get through one single day.  I felt honored to have been included into a snippet of his situation.People having something to say with this kind of rare honesty is not a situation that I ever really expect, it takes a bravery and candor that will and does lift it up.  His attitude toward his new-found life at age 47 is the glue that holds Buddy together in society with this type of severe mental illness.  I was amazed at each and every turn he made, with his therapist who suffers from the affliction of OCD himself, his friends, and with his parents' loving support.Buddy explains to one of his Dr.s (Sally Gever PhD) about what ""OC87"" means to him.  It is actually a state of mind when his Obsessive-Compulsive thoughts are overtaking him; ""out of control of everything"" is a dark and terrifying place for him.  He must constantly be aware of and talk himself through thought-processes that would come into our minds so quickly that we don't even notice them.  With Buddy, ""these words are a command"" (his therapist, Jonathan Grayson PhD, teaches him) and Buddy must choose an action in these terribly difficult times.  The film teaches all the different types and ways these thoughts are so intrusive.The group therapy sessions lend such valuable insight to experiences that people who suffer from mental illness go through everyday.  The kinds of things that can seem as easy as making a decision are difficult for some and impossible for others.  Feelings are forgotten as soon as a person leaves.  Remembering those feelings felt within the experience is impossible.  This is just a minor look into Asperger's Syndrome (Neuro-biologically based, Autistic-Spectrum Disorder), for Buddy, OCD and the former overlap at times.  Actor and friend Maurice Benard (""Sonny Corinthos"" of 'General Hospital'), weighs in about the Bipolar aspect of Buddy's illness.  They shared a ""breakdown"" on the exact date and ""feel a connection because of their shared struggle"".I am amazed with writer-filmmaker Buddy Clayman.  His documentary is brilliant and insightful also inspiring for this look into what it is to suffer such illnesses ... The Documentary is definitely personal; therefore, Thank you and Bravo Buddy!",5,"""...I Don't Feel I'm In Control At All - On This Project!"" - Buddy Clayman",1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,2403,"['documentary', 'life', 'Bradford', 'Buddy', 'Clayman', 'truly', 'wonder', 'behold', 'What', 'initially', 'striking', 'just', 'how', 'personable', 'Buddy', 'now', 'must', 'undertake', 'just', 'get', 'one', 'single', 'day', 'felt', 'honored', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'snippet', 'situation.People', 'having', 'something', 'say', 'kind', 'rare', 'honesty', 'not', 'situation', 'ever', 'really', 'expect', 'bravery', 'candor', 'will', 'lift', 'up', 'attitude', 'new-found', 'life', 'age', '47', 'glue', 'Buddy', 'together', 'society', 'type', 'severe', 'mental', 'illness', 'was', 'amazed', 'turn', 'made', 'therapist', 'who', 'affliction', 'OCD', 'friends', 'parents', 'loving', 'support.Buddy', 'one', 'Dr.s', 'Sally', 'Gever', 'PhD', 'what', 'OC87', 'actually', 'state', 'mind', 'when', 'Obsessive-Compulsive', 'thoughts', 'are', 'overtaking', 'control', 'everything', 'dark', 'terrifying', 'place', 'must', 'constantly', 'be', 'aware', 'talk', 'thought-processes', 'would', 'come', 'minds', 'so', 'quickly', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'Buddy', 'words', 'are', 'command', 'therapist', 'Jonathan', 'Grayson', 'PhD', 'Buddy', 'must', 'choose', 'action', 'terribly', 'difficult', 'times', 'film', 'different', 'types', 'ways', 'thoughts', 'are', 'so', 'intrusive.The', 'group', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'lend', 'such', 'valuable', 'insight', 'experiences', 'people', 'who', 'suffer', 'mental', 'illness', 'go', 'everyday', 'kinds', 'things', 'can', 'seem', 'as', 'easy', 'making', 'decision', 'are', 'difficult', 'impossible', 'others', 'Feelings', 'are', 'forgotten', 'as', 'soon', 'person', 'Remembering', 'feelings', 'felt', 'experience', 'impossible', 'just', 'minor', 'look', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'Neuro-biologically', 'based', 'Autistic-Spectrum', 'Disorder', 'Buddy', 'OCD', 'former', 'overlap', 'times', 'Actor', 'friend', 'Maurice', 'Benard', 'Sonny', 'Corinthos', ""'General"", 'Hospital', 'Bipolar', 'aspect', 'Buddy', 'illness', 'shared', 'breakdown', 'exact', 'date', 'feel', 'connection', 'shared', 'struggle', 'am', 'amazed', 'writer-filmmaker', 'Buddy', 'Clayman', 'documentary', 'brilliant', 'insightful', 'also', 'inspiring', 'look', 'what', 'suffer', 'such', 'illnesses', 'Documentary', 'definitely', 'personal', 'therefore', 'Thank', 'Bravo', 'Buddy']",N/A

Fortunately, I hid it well and was able to get married and have a family, but it is and always will be a life long struggle.  What inspired me the most was how rough Bud had it and now seems well on his way to deal with his illness and start the life he so much deserves.
