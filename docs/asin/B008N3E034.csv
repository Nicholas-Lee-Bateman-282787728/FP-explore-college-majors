Cooper,"[6, 6]","Having seen this movie on it's original release in the UK my immediate reaction was that it did not involve the viewer to the same effect as Cinerama.  The actual picture was much clearer than Cinerama with less distortion at the ""joining points"" but somehow the overall effect was only half as exciting as seeing the wonderful flight over America in This Is Cinerama.  Having said that, I have to say tha this BluRay edition is superb.  The overall picture and sound is wonderful and the restoration process has been mediculously done.  Extras are much better than the This Is Cinerama release so all I can say is BUY BOTH, if you remember these moves or only heared about them you will not be disappointed",5,Cimemiracle Vs.

1570877,A2TACQ7DUX63VL,B008N3E034,Bob,"[4, 5]","Cinema changed dramatically in the 1950s when television began taking over as the primary form of entertainment.  Movie studios and exhibitors began scrambling to find ways to bring people back to the theaters; they hadn't yet understood that their ticket buying audience shifted to the 15-30 years olds and it would be the late 1960s before the big studios would figure that out.  Still, the 1950s saw the standard movie frame change from Academy ratio 1:33 to 1 (original television mimicked this) to 1:85 to 1 (the current 16:9 ratio of HD television) and Cinemascope, VistaVision, Todd AO 70, Super Panavision, Ultra Panavision 65, Technirama, 3D and other wide screen aspect ratios try to make the movie experience bigger and better, and bring people back to cinemas.The granddaddy of all was Cinerama, a three element synchronized photography and projection system that captured a 150 degree field of vision.  This is Cinerama dazzled audiences with its life-like presentation.  Soon other films were produced and Windjammer was produced overseas in Cinemiracle, another three panel production and exhibition technique that was Cinerama's only rival.  It was spectacular in the cinema and was the star of the show, that's why I only give three stars.  The Smilebox presentation adequately mimics the experience but nothing at home can match the power of seeing it in theaters. And the film itself, well, it's not all that exciting to watch for two hours at home. It's an okay documentary and a time capsule from the past. It's well worth seeing, if not necessarily buying it.Do look for one of the most spectacular shots in film history though.  The camera is mounted on a submarine and as it surfaces the Windjammer is cruising along in the background, all captured in one shot.  It would make Stanley Kubrick proud.",3,A Time Capsule Into Yesteryear,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,1823,"['Cinema', 'changed', 'dramatically', '1950s', 'when', 'television', 'began', 'taking', 'over', 'primary', 'form', 'entertainment', 'Movie', 'studios', 'exhibitors', 'began', 'scrambling', 'find', 'ways', 'bring', 'people', 'back', 'theaters', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'understood', 'ticket', 'buying', 'audience', 'shifted', '15-30', 'years', 'olds', 'would', 'be', 'late', '1960s', 'big', 'studios', 'would', 'figure', 'out', 'Still', '1950s', 'saw', 'standard', 'movie', 'frame', 'change', 'Academy', 'ratio', '1:33', '1', 'original', 'television', 'mimicked', '1:85', '1', 'current', '16:9', 'ratio', 'HD', 'television', 'Cinemascope', 'VistaVision', 'Todd', 'AO', '70', 'Super', 'Panavision', 'Ultra', 'Panavision', '65', 'Technirama', '3D', 'other', 'wide', 'screen', 'aspect', 'ratios', 'try', 'make', 'movie', 'experience', 'bigger', 'better', 'bring', 'people', 'back', 'cinemas.The', 'granddaddy', 'was', 'Cinerama', 'three', 'element', 'synchronized', 'photography', 'projection', 'system', 'captured', '150', 'degree', 'field', 'vision', 'Cinerama', 'dazzled', 'audiences', 'life-like', 'presentation', 'Soon', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'produced', 'Windjammer', 'was', 'produced', 'overseas', 'Cinemiracle', 'three', 'panel', 'production', 'exhibition', 'technique', 'was', 'Cinerama', 'only', 'rival', 'was', 'spectacular', 'cinema', 'was', 'star', 'show', 'why', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'Smilebox', 'presentation', 'adequately', 'mimics', 'experience', 'nothing', 'home', 'can', 'match', 'power', 'seeing', 'theaters', 'film', 'well', 'not', 'exciting', 'watch', 'two', 'hours', 'home', 'okay', 'documentary', 'time', 'capsule', 'past', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'necessarily', 'buying', 'it.Do', 'look', 'one', 'most', 'spectacular', 'shots', 'film', 'history', 'camera', 'mounted', 'submarine', 'Windjammer', 'cruising', 'along', 'background', 'captured', 'one', 'shot', 'would', 'make', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'proud']",N/A

Being able to view this after reading so much about it is delightful. Hats off to David Strohmaier and all those who worked so hard to bring this film back for public viewing. It is a shame that Hollywood would not step in with their deep pockets and contribute to the restoration. According to David Strohmaier it would have taken upwards to one million dollars to restore the 3-strip negatives and since they did not have such a benefactor they had to work within the budget that was available to them. That being said it is unbelievable what they were able to do with a 35mm anamorphic print that included all three panels intact. The film lacks the sparkle and clarity of the restoration of How The West Was Won but one has to remember that they had to do the restoration within a certain budget. As others have pointed out the join lines in This Is Cinerama and Windjammer create certain problems inherit with the process. This was noted in the making of Windjammer documentary. So even back then they were aware of such issues. The upside is that the 3-strip process outshines 70mm in sharpness and clarity. Due to the fact that a 35mm anamorphic print was used in the restoration a lot of the crisp and sharp imagery does not exist. Even with the painstaking restoration done to the film there are flaws in the picture as one would expect but this is not a critical viewpoint...it's a salute to the hard work of the staff that restored this print making it available for a new generation to view...I for one enjoyed the entire disc with the trailer, the documentary and still shots. It was a sad not to hear of the sinking of the Pamir training vessel losing almost all hands. This made the film all the more endearing. I will say that compared to This Is Cinerama the join lines seem to blend better for the most part. Over all both restored films deserve a place in your library as a tribute to movie making and their contribution to film history.",5,A Very Entertaining Film!,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2029,"['youngster', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'see', '3-strip', 'Cinerama', 'film', 'Being', 'able', 'view', 'reading', 'so', 'much', 'delightful', 'David', 'Strohmaier', 'who', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'bring', 'film', 'back', 'public', 'viewing', 'shame', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'not', 'step', 'deep', 'pockets', 'contribute', 'restoration', 'According', 'David', 'Strohmaier', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'upwards', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', 'restore', '3-strip', 'negatives', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'such', 'benefactor', 'had', 'work', 'budget', 'was', 'available', 'being', 'said', 'unbelievable', 'what', 'were', 'able', 'do', '35mm', 'anamorphic', 'print', 'included', 'three', 'panels', 'intact', 'film', 'sparkle', 'clarity', 'restoration', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'one', 'remember', 'had', 'do', 'restoration', 'certain', 'budget', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'join', 'lines', 'Cinerama', 'Windjammer', 'create', 'certain', 'problems', 'inherit', 'process', 'was', 'noted', 'making', 'Windjammer', 'documentary', 'So', 'even', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'aware', 'such', 'issues', 'upside', '3-strip', 'process', 'outshines', '70mm', 'sharpness', 'clarity', 'Due', 'fact', '35mm', 'anamorphic', 'print', 'was', 'used', 'restoration', 'lot', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'imagery', 'not', 'exist', 'Even', 'painstaking', 'restoration', 'done', 'film', 'are', 'flaws', 'picture', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'not', 'critical', 'viewpoint', 'salute', 'hard', 'work', 'staff', 'restored', 'print', 'making', 'available', 'new', 'generation', 'view', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'entire', 'disc', 'trailer', 'documentary', 'still', 'shots', 'was', 'sad', 'not', 'hear', 'sinking', 'Pamir', 'training', 'vessel', 'losing', 'almost', 'hands', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'endearing', 'will', 'say', 'compared', 'Cinerama', 'join', 'lines', 'seem', 'blend', 'better', 'most', 'part', 'restored', 'films', 'deserve', 'place', 'library', 'tribute', 'movie', 'making', 'contribution', 'film', 'history']",N/A

1570883,AI4E5IFOT4QER,B008N3E034,James M. Shertzer,"[29, 31]","I was a teenager when I saw ""Windjammer"" in Cinemiracle at the Warner Cinerama Theater in Washington, D.C., in the late 1959. I had a seat in the balcony (which cost about $1.50 in those days) and remember the film vividly, especially the transition from 35mm and mono sound to widescreen. The stereophonic sound of wind started up on the surround speaker system (one speaker was right behind me!) as the the three-projection system started and curtains fully opened revealing the full screen. It put goosebumps on the spine and was a movie thrill I remember 50 years later.There were no surviving Cinemiracle prints of ""Windjammer"" in good shape for this restoration, as there were for ""How the West Was Won."" One reason - the Eastmancolor stock on which it was filmed has not held up at well as Technicolor. Considering the only print found capable of restoration on a modest budget was 35mm, squeezing all three panel on one film strip, the results are surprising good. Smilebox is nice but I wish, as with ""How the West Was Won,"" a non Smilebox version had been included as well, especially since ALL of the 2nd disc in the set is just a DVD of the Blu-Ray edition. Finally, it would be gratifying to know a part of the profits (if any) from this set will go to a full-scale restoration of the original three-strip elements. The supplementary materials really don't make clear if such a restoration is a possibility. All that's said is that such a restoration would have exceed the budget for this project.Some have mentioned the film's hokiness. More than 50 years later the film DOES seem hokier than I remembered it - but no more so than most films of the period. The film IS a little choppier than I remembered - and seems more amatuerishly directed. I am somewhat bothered by what's ""staged"" and was isn't. We learn a number of scenes of the young men in their ""clubhouse"" (including the scene of them learning of the fate of the Pamir) were staged on a set after the rest of the filming done. But I suppose it's a minor quibble.One thing that has definitely stood the test of time is Morton Gould's sweeping symphonic score. Such a pity he didn't do more film work. I've had two copies of the soundtrack LP (one mono, one stereo) and listened to them often over the decades. Gould's music kept the voyage of the Christian Radich fresh in my mind. It's so good it probably led me to recall the film being somewhat better than it really is.",4,A Satisfying restoration,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,2448,"['was', 'teenager', 'when', 'saw', 'Windjammer', 'Cinemiracle', 'Warner', 'Cinerama', 'Theater', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'late', '1959', 'had', 'seat', 'balcony', 'cost', '1.50', 'days', 'remember', 'film', 'vividly', 'especially', 'transition', '35mm', 'mono', 'sound', 'widescreen', 'stereophonic', 'sound', 'wind', 'started', 'up', 'surround', 'speaker', 'system', 'one', 'speaker', 'was', 'right', 'three-projection', 'system', 'started', 'curtains', 'fully', 'opened', 'revealing', 'full', 'screen', 'put', 'goosebumps', 'spine', 'was', 'movie', 'thrill', 'remember', '50', 'years', 'later.There', 'were', 'surviving', 'Cinemiracle', 'prints', 'Windjammer', 'good', 'shape', 'restoration', 'were', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'One', 'reason', 'Eastmancolor', 'stock', 'was', 'filmed', 'not', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'Technicolor', 'Considering', 'only', 'print', 'found', 'capable', 'restoration', 'modest', 'budget', 'was', '35mm', 'squeezing', 'three', 'panel', 'one', 'film', 'strip', 'results', 'are', 'surprising', 'good', 'Smilebox', 'nice', 'wish', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'non', 'Smilebox', 'version', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'ALL', '2nd', 'disc', 'set', 'just', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'Finally', 'would', 'be', 'gratifying', 'know', 'part', 'profits', 'set', 'will', 'go', 'full-scale', 'restoration', 'original', 'three-strip', 'elements', 'supplementary', 'materials', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear', 'such', 'restoration', 'possibility', 'said', 'restoration', 'would', 'have', 'exceed', 'budget', 'project.Some', 'have', 'mentioned', 'film', 'hokiness', 'More', '50', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'DOES', 'seem', 'hokier', 'remembered', 'more', 'so', 'most', 'films', 'period', 'film', 'little', 'choppier', 'remembered', 'more', 'amatuerishly', 'directed', 'am', 'somewhat', 'bothered', 'what', 'staged', 'was', ""n't"", 'learn', 'number', 'scenes', 'young', 'men', 'clubhouse', 'including', 'scene', 'learning', 'fate', 'Pamir', 'were', 'staged', 'set', 'rest', 'filming', 'done', 'suppose', 'minor', 'quibble.One', 'thing', 'definitely', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'Morton', 'Gould', 'sweeping', 'symphonic', 'score', 'pity', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'film', 'work', ""'ve"", 'had', 'two', 'copies', 'soundtrack', 'LP', 'one', 'mono', 'one', 'stereo', 'listened', 'often', 'decades', 'Gould', 'music', 'kept', 'voyage', 'Christian', 'Radich', 'fresh', 'mind', 'so', 'good', 'probably', 'led', 'recall', 'film', 'being', 'somewhat', 'better', 'really']",N/A

The film is also a part of cinema history as it was the last time that the  tragic  Pamir  training ship was  photographed shortly before it  capsised  at sea in a storm.There were only a handful of survivors. The music  of Windjammer is  truly unforgettable. See the film on the biggest TV screen that you can and be enveloped into another world and experience how things were back in the fifties.It was  truly the best of all the documentary films that were filmed in the 3  panel process. As there is almost no likelyhood of ever seeing the  film restored to its former glory we can  now at least,see it  on  bluray. It is probably the most wanted film in decades for  home  viewers  and now we finally have that chance to once again relive the memories of a bygone  era.If you don't already know, the  dvd and bluray are region free.",5,AT LONG LAST ON BLURAY AND DVD,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",2012,1084,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released.It', 'was', 'unforgettable', 'giant', 'Cinerama', 'screen.I', 'saw', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'lucky', 'get', 'video', 'Christian', 'Radich', 'society', 'when', 'sold', 'copies', 'brief', 'time', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'also', 'part', 'cinema', 'history', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'tragic', 'Pamir', 'training', 'ship', 'was', 'photographed', 'shortly', 'capsised', 'sea', 'storm.There', 'were', 'only', 'handful', 'survivors', 'music', 'Windjammer', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'See', 'film', 'biggest', 'TV', 'screen', 'can', 'be', 'enveloped', 'world', 'experience', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'back', 'fifties.It', 'was', 'truly', 'best', 'documentary', 'films', 'were', 'filmed', '3', 'panel', 'process', 'almost', 'likelyhood', 'ever', 'seeing', 'film', 'restored', 'former', 'glory', 'can', 'now', 'least', 'see', 'bluray', 'probably', 'most', 'wanted', 'film', 'decades', 'home', 'viewers', 'now', 'finally', 'have', 'chance', 'once', 'again', 'relive', 'memories', 'bygone', 'era.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'dvd', 'bluray', 'are', 'region', 'free']",N/A

1570891,A394P5LTQRTV2L,B008N3E034,S. Robinson,"[2, 2]","I'll get right to the review of this release. At first I was a little cautious about Windjammer. It was not the first of the Cinerama type films, that distinction being ""This Is Cinerama"" which has also been release in conjunction with WJ. Despite some hokiness WJ remains a stronger film.First the film elements, after being restored, are quite passable, but you will not find the image quality of the Blu-ray release of ""How The West Was Won"". The extent of the issues are that panels don't always match in brightness and in at least one very noticeable spot that the panels don't line up. When Pablo Casals is playing the left panel is too low; then it drops even more. Unfortunately, his right arm is the almost the only thing moving in the shot it crosses into the left panel and his hand appears dismembered. The film joints are much more noticeable than in HTWWW but I don't mind that. There are also many areas of over-exposed, blown-out highlights and some areas that are too dark.The color of the film appears like one would expect a typical photograph from the period. I would say it is aged looking. The Eastman stock used is not of the same quality as Technicolor which was used in ""This is Cinerama"".  According to the restoration documentary the 35mm negative, from which this print derives, was faded. You would not think so from this release. The colors have been intensified but not necessarily corrected. Also, surprisingly, the details that are missing from TIC print, which was derived from a larger 65mm print, are not much worse here.As for the film itself I would describe it as, well,  hokey. This was not supposed to be a Hollywood musical, but, early on we are treated to the sailors, who, with varied backgrounds, begin singing and playing instruments, apparently well rehearsed and with mature male low voices. I get the feeling that all were dubbed. Yes, there are more of this later on but it is tolerable. The narrator's inflection also greatly adds to the hokey feeling.Windjammer is in the same style as the other travelogues in the Cinerama style. But Windjammer has a bit of a story too, and unlike TIC, the segments don't last longer than they should. The photography is stunning especially that of the underwater scenes and the submarine.The score is by Gould is magnificent. It sounds great and I love it.The extras on the disk are extensive and very enjoyable. The set includes both a Blu-ray and a double sided DVD. Gorgeous booklet.Highly recommended!!!",5,Fantastic!!!,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,2495,"[""'ll"", 'get', 'right', 'review', 'release', 'first', 'was', 'little', 'cautious', 'Windjammer', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'Cinerama', 'type', 'films', 'distinction', 'being', 'Cinerama', 'also', 'been', 'release', 'conjunction', 'WJ', 'hokiness', 'WJ', 'stronger', 'film.First', 'film', 'elements', 'being', 'restored', 'are', 'quite', 'passable', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'image', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'extent', 'issues', 'are', 'panels', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'match', 'brightness', 'least', 'one', 'very', 'noticeable', 'spot', 'panels', 'do', ""n't"", 'line', 'up', 'When', 'Pablo', 'Casals', 'playing', 'left', 'panel', 'too', 'low', 'then', 'even', 'more', 'Unfortunately', 'right', 'arm', 'almost', 'only', 'thing', 'moving', 'shot', 'left', 'panel', 'hand', 'dismembered', 'film', 'joints', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'noticeable', 'HTWWW', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'areas', 'over-exposed', 'blown-out', 'highlights', 'areas', 'are', 'too', 'dark.The', 'color', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'typical', 'photograph', 'period', 'would', 'say', 'aged', 'looking', 'Eastman', 'stock', 'used', 'not', 'same', 'quality', 'Technicolor', 'was', 'used', 'Cinerama', 'According', 'restoration', '35mm', 'negative', 'print', 'was', 'faded', 'would', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'release', 'colors', 'have', 'been', 'intensified', 'not', 'necessarily', 'corrected', 'Also', 'surprisingly', 'details', 'are', 'missing', 'TIC', 'print', 'was', 'derived', 'larger', '65mm', 'print', 'are', 'not', 'much', 'worse', 'here.As', 'film', 'would', 'describe', 'well', 'hokey', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'musical', 'early', 'are', 'treated', 'sailors', 'who', 'varied', 'backgrounds', 'begin', 'singing', 'playing', 'instruments', 'apparently', 'well', 'rehearsed', 'mature', 'male', 'low', 'voices', 'get', 'feeling', 'were', 'dubbed', 'Yes', 'are', 'more', 'later', 'tolerable', 'narrator', 'inflection', 'also', 'greatly', 'hokey', 'feeling.Windjammer', 'same', 'style', 'other', 'travelogues', 'Cinerama', 'style', 'Windjammer', 'bit', 'story', 'too', 'TIC', 'segments', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'longer', 'should', 'photography', 'stunning', 'especially', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'submarine.The', 'score', 'Gould', 'magnificent', 'great', 'love', 'it.The', 'extras', 'disk', 'are', 'extensive', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'set', 'Blu-ray', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD', 'Gorgeous', 'booklet.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
