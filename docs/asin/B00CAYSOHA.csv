And Emily is even more beautiful in person than on the show.I am so enamored I watch three and four reruns of the show in succession that air almost daily. I can't get enough!!And I am very happy to hear they're going to explore the past personal issues with Sweets, as well as the other members. And can I say, he&#8217;s grown into quite a stud!This special really gave insight as to the inner workings of my favorite show. I can&#8217;t wait for the next editionAnd finally, the video quality was outstanding!!!!!

I am very disappointed that no one asked (or had a chance to ask) about an early episode where everyone was depressed - especially Brennan - and Angela, brilliant darling that she is, created an holographic Christmas Tree on the machine that is/was supposed to used to recreate bodies from bones (an identification tool, I believe).IF there was anyone in the audience who was going to ask that question, and did not get a chance, I both applaud and pity you.  THAT was one of my favorite scenes in an episode I WAS able to watch (while I could still afford cable!)...  It isn't that I'm &#34;all about Christmas&#34; at all - but that was one of the coolest things I've seen on tv in a long time... (of course, now I've dropped way behind and watch online...)Respectfully submitted to the writer who wrote Angelia doing the holographic tree !",5,Bones: Cast & Creators at Paleyfest,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,1037,"['ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'more', 'cancelled', 'tv', 'cable', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'group', 'was', 'most', 'satisfying', 'next', 'NICS', 'group', 'show', 'IS', 'favorite', 'BUT', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'one', 'asked', 'had', 'chance', 'ask', 'early', 'episode', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'depressed', 'especially', 'Brennan', 'Angela', 'brilliant', 'darling', 'created', 'holographic', 'Christmas', 'Tree', 'machine', 'supposed', 'used', 'recreate', 'bodies', 'bones', 'identification', 'tool', 'believe', '.IF', 'was', 'anyone', 'audience', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'ask', 'question', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'chance', 'applaud', 'pity', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'episode', 'WAS', 'able', 'watch', 'could', 'still', 'afford', 'cable', ""n't"", ""'m"", '34', 'Christmas', '34', 'was', 'one', 'coolest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tv', 'long', 'time', 'course', 'now', ""'ve"", 'dropped', 'way', 'watch', 'online', 'Respectfully', 'submitted', 'writer', 'who', 'wrote', 'Angelia', 'doing', 'holographic', 'tree']",Bones: Cast & Creators Live at PALEYFEST
