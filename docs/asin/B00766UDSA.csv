Also who and what other people would think she was, although she made no attempt to hide the fact that she was indeed a pre op Transsexual,that was her meal ticket,that's what set her apart from all the other beautiful women in New York,she was fabulous and all eyes were on her. She loved and craved the spotlight but at the same time she wanted to have a husband and a family like any other woman.Most wanted to gawk at her. She was so beautiful and so feminine that people especially men became so infatuated with her but she never knew if they really liked/loved her or the ""novelty"" that was Candy Darling.A feeling I knew all too well.""I will not cease to be myself for foolish people.

1526743,A1WI0A8JSAF2O7,B00766UDSA,Dennis Lee Cleven,"[2, 2]","""Beautiful Darling"" is a very poignant film. Candy Darling was discovered by Andy Warhol and she appeared in ""Flesh"" and ""Women in Revolt"" both directed by Paul Morrissey. Candy was biologically male but took estrogen which did increase her female appearance. She worked hard at being a woman more than Warhol's other two ""transvestite"" stars: Jackie Curtis and Holly Woodlawn. Candy was a transsexual but hesitated having a sex change. One reason may very well have been that she didn't have the money. Her idol was Kim Novak and Candy spoke like her and acted like her in many ways.Candy was intelligent and readings from her journals reveal her inner thoughts which were sometimes very sad because she was an outcast.Her very good friend, Jeremiah Newton, adds a great deal to the film. Others who share their memories of Candy include Holly Woodlawn, Paul Morrissey, Jayne County, Fran Leibowitz and several others. I only wish that there was more information on the other films she appeared that were not associated with the Andy Warhol Factory. This could have easily been a longer film. It left me wanting more. No mention is made that Candy had a half-brother from her mother's previous marriage who would have nothing to do with Candy.Candy Darling had a presence and she could have done cabaret like Holly Woodlawn and Jackie Curtis did in after Andy Warhol quit using ""transvestites"" in his films.This film is worth every cent! I also have ""Superstar in a Housedress"" about Jackie Curtis. The two films are ones I highly recommend. Candy Darling is worth remembering and, if you are unfamaliar with her, she is well worth learning about. She is utterly fascinating. Buy this documentary.

1526745,A3SHQXNOPZBJH,B00766UDSA,Robert Byrd,"[16, 17]","Having seen many of Paul Morrissey directed/Andy Warhol produced films like FLESH and TRASH, I was somewhat familiar with the performing side of transgendered glamour queen, Candy Darling.  But, after watching this fantastic documentary I realized that I knew nothing about the personal side of this beautiful, but very sad and lonely woman.  Candy Darling grew up in a cookie cutter suburb of New York around people who could just as well have been from another planet.  There was nothing in the life or routine of those early surroundings that inspired the slightest level of comfort or self-esteem in a boy who wanted to be a glamorous girl.  But, a move to New York in Candy's early teens changed everything, and eventually led her to the great heights of fame that she dreamed of.  Yet, through it all was a nagging loneliness that eventually consumed Candy and played a pivotal role in her desire to simply die when she was diagnosed with Lymphoma at age 28.  The nice thing about Candy is that her fame lives on through this very generous and affirming documentary.  In fact, the film proves that nothing works better at helping us understand those whose realities lie far outside the mainstream than witnessing a heavy dose of their vulnerable humanity.
