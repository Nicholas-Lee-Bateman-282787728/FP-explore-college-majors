1330285,A1W9JOFE6F89FB,B0038ASYTI,Amber MacDonald,"[4, 4]","My little ones had a blast with this kids yoga DVD, in fact they have done yoga a few times a week since receiving this DVD. I have found this product offers a little bit of everything. It has a interesting story to it, that keeps the little ones interested in what is going on. A great story is always a plus in our home with the kids. If there is a great storyline than my kids are all for it. The story offers cartoons about what animals they are portraying in the yoga moves and also they learn a little bit about the animals.The moves aren't overly hard just prefect for little ones to be able to do. Some of the moves in adult yoga videos' can be pretty hard until you get the hang of them. That is why I am so happy that the moves in the kids yoga dvd is just prefect for their age. Which allows them to really participate in the DVD and also at the same time staying limber and healthy.Another thing I found that I really loved about this was the fact that when my kids start to get a little hyper I just pop in the DVD and it really helps calm them down. With both of my kids having ADHD this is a great product for helping them calm down and focus.I have them do this about two or three times a week, as if I were doing my yoga. They sometimes just pick one story they want to do or sometimes they will do both.",4,My Kids Liked It But I Am Not Sure,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,1321,"['little', 'ones', 'had', 'blast', 'kids', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'fact', 'have', 'done', 'yoga', 'few', 'times', 'week', 'receiving', 'DVD', 'have', 'found', 'product', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'interesting', 'story', 'little', 'ones', 'interested', 'what', 'going', 'great', 'story', 'always', 'plus', 'home', 'kids', 'great', 'storyline', 'kids', 'are', 'story', 'cartoons', 'what', 'animals', 'are', 'portraying', 'yoga', 'moves', 'also', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'animals.The', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'overly', 'hard', 'just', 'prefect', 'little', 'ones', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'moves', 'adult', 'yoga', 'videos', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'hard', 'get', 'hang', 'why', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'moves', 'kids', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'just', 'prefect', 'age', 'Which', 'really', 'participate', 'DVD', 'also', 'same', 'time', 'staying', 'limber', 'healthy.Another', 'thing', 'found', 'really', 'loved', 'was', 'fact', 'when', 'kids', 'start', 'get', 'little', 'hyper', 'just', 'pop', 'DVD', 'really', 'calm', 'down', 'kids', 'having', 'ADHD', 'great', 'product', 'helping', 'calm', 'down', 'focus.I', 'have', 'do', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'week', 'were', 'doing', 'yoga', 'sometimes', 'just', 'pick', 'one', 'story', 'want', 'do', 'sometimes', 'will', 'do']",Storyland Yoga: Yoga for Kids and Families (ages 3 to 8)

A lot of yoga videos I've seen have either been really boring, too hard, or waaayy too out there to even take it seriously. With it being a kids Yoga DVD I was even more curious.We picked the ""Save the Whale"" workout video. There are several kids on the video sitting on the beach with their adult instructor, Ahmed Fahmy. They start out pretending to take a car ride to the beach with their electric cars. Ahmed Fahmy was very easy to listen to and the whole workout was easy and fun enough to keep Lee interested through out. You could also tell she was getting a great workout. I even got into it with her.Instead of using yoga terms Ahmed Fahmy used visual words like, surfing and swimming to help the child know what move to do next. There are also cartoon visuals to see the whale, mermaid and the beach allowing the child's imagination to soar even more.I LOVE this video. I love that it teaches to be kind to our planet, it teaches my kids healthy living and as a bonus the DVD comes in a cardboard case making it environment friendly. This video is not only for your child but you can enjoy it too.--------------I received this product mentioned above for free.

Maybe it's geared for a much younger audience because she was simply bored by it.  The instructor is personable and animated, but it just doesn't have enough activity and the main yoga seems to come at the very end.  I think it is more towards the age three audience (not for five and above).

They act out stories through yoga with two adventures to choose from. What a brilliant idea! I would love to see more like this. If there was a series of several episodes, I would buy it.

I love how they are not only learning the basic Yogic moves but they are also learning how to create a positive influence on our planet and our environment.I am quite impressed that a portion of all sales will go towards helping save the whales and the kids vs. global warming foundations!  I believe these are great values to encompass and pass along to our next generation.My kids had loads of fun imitating the animals, and listening to the stories that were being shared.  One of the was Condor Trek which runs about 23 minutes and Save The Whale which is about 18 minutes in length.  Each one of the stories shares an interesting topic that teaches children the importance of the planet!My kids enjoyed themselves and will play it before bed, especially my 6 y/o son who is big on exercising and building his muscles, but we don't call him Odin McBamBam for nothing...LOL  He liked how he was able to strengthen muscles that he doesn't normally work!!This DVD is recommended for children 3 thru 8 but I think adults who don't practise yoga would also find benefit from participating.

I bought this for my 2 and a half year old daughter, because she always wants to do my yoga dvds with me.  Since her attention span seems to be very short for it (a few minutes, then she's off doing something else), I thought having a story to listen to during the yoga would help.  I think it does, as long as I'm there guiding her through the moves and encouraging her.  I think when she's a little bit older, she'll enjoy it more.
