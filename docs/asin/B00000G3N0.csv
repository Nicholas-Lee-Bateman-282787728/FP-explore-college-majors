Shortly thereafter I found it was available on Amazon and decided to watch it. I was very surprised and impressed at the quality of the film. I definitely recommend it to fans of Samurai and Kaiju films.

501223,A25TUXM2LXYXOX,B00000G3N0,"""kaijuking54""","[6, 6]","Mixing elements of the jedai(samurai)film with elements of the kaiju(monster)film, Daimajin is a rousing adventure that is sure to appeal to fans of both types of films.  Set in medievel Japan, the film follows  the story of a boy and his sister, who are pursued by the man who had their  father murdered and then took over his kingdom.  Watching all of this is  the giant statue of Majin, a powerful spirit that can be invoked to right  wrongs and punish evil-doers.  The story moves along well, aided by good  performances by all of the actors, though it is perhaps a bit slow at  first.  Once Daimajin(&quot;dai&quot; meaning giant, &quot;majin&quot;  meaning spirit) revives, all hell breaks loose on the evil Lord and his  men.  The spfx are spectacular(immensely aided by the widescreen  presentation).  Functioning like a pounding funeral drum is Akira Ifukube's  magnificent score, one of his best non-Godzilla works.  This is a great  film that is thankfully no longer obscure.",3,The colossus of Japan.,961632000,"06 22, 2000",2000,986,"['Mixing', 'elements', 'jedai', 'samurai', 'film', 'elements', 'kaiju', 'monster', 'film', 'Daimajin', 'rousing', 'adventure', 'sure', 'appeal', 'fans', 'types', 'films', 'Set', 'medievel', 'Japan', 'film', 'story', 'boy', 'sister', 'who', 'are', 'pursued', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'father', 'murdered', 'then', 'took', 'over', 'kingdom', 'Watching', 'giant', 'statue', 'Majin', 'powerful', 'spirit', 'can', 'be', 'invoked', 'right', 'wrongs', 'punish', 'evil-doers', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'well', 'aided', 'good', 'performances', 'actors', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'slow', 'first', 'Once', 'Daimajin', 'quot', 'quot', 'meaning', 'giant', 'quot', 'quot', 'meaning', 'spirit', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'evil', 'Lord', 'men', 'spfx', 'are', 'spectacular', 'immensely', 'aided', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'Functioning', 'pounding', 'funeral', 'drum', 'Akira', 'Ifukube', 'magnificent', 'score', 'one', 'best', 'non-Godzilla', 'works', 'great', 'film', 'thankfully', 'no', 'longer', 'obscure']",Daimajin VHS
