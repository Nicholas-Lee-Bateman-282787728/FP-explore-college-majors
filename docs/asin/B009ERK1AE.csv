You don't need to have seen the original Montalbano series to understand or enjoy this series.  This can stand completely on its own. The really major difference is that this young Montalbano will just knock the women off their feet.  He is enormously good looking and appealing, The older Montalbano was attractive but nothing like this.If you know nothing of this fictional policeman: he is a police chief in a small town in Sicily. The cast of characters in this region are eccentric, lovable and downright laugh out loud funny.  but the crimes he solves are genuine. sicilians do murder one another feom time to time. the terrainis just gorgeous and this is a very unique place with a very unique people.

In this delightful backstory, set in the imaginary town of Vigata on the sea (I covet his house!!!) we meet the young Commissario, who is still bowlegged and utterly charming, but has a full mop of curly hair, and is heartthrobbingly gorgeous! (Che bellissimo!)The writers and directors have enhanced the plausibility of the entire story by giving us a real history to the established Montalbano series, introducing us to the younger versions of the denizens of the Questura that keeps a watchful eye on the territory between Vigata and Montelusa: Salvo Montalbano is mentored by Fazio's simpatico father; the younger Catarella is as endearingly misbegotten as the older Caterella; young Fazio, straight out of the police academy, is tack-sharp; and lady-killer Mimi Augello, with a full moustache, is full of himself.We meet the beautiful and usually absent Livia, a perfect match for young Salvo. We also discover exactly why she is absent most of the time, as Salvo  becomes consumed with investigating local petty crimes as well as spectacular murders. Their chemistry blends so well, that we can also understand why she puts up with him after so many years in the later series. We also learn the history of the estrangement between Salvo and his father; and we discover Salvo's continuing love affair with the characteristic cuisine of Sicily, and how Adellina with her succulent -arrancini-(rice croquettes) comes into his life.This series has everything: intriguing mysteries; glorious settings (It is shot around Ragusa); endearing characters (and every character, down to the cleaning ladies and shopkeepers, is individual rather than stereotypical), haunting Sicilian melodies, and a quirky sense of humor that is very Italian. It is full of gems that will have resonance for anyone who has lived in Italy and Sicily (e.g., special delivery letters sent from one end of Vigata that take five days to arrive at the other end of this very small town).I have not read the books, but the series has encouraged me to do so. To me, the only drawback to buying this Italian DVD--the image of which is sharp, the sound clear, the subtitles [expunged of salty language] well done--is the price, but it is definitely worth saving for!I strongly recommend ""Il Giovane Montalbano"" for anyone who loves Italy--and Sicily, of course.",5,To Die For!!!,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,2456,"['Young', 'Montalbano', 'see', 'why', 'girls', 'fall', 'Old', 'Montalbano', 'bullet', 'headed', 'bowlegged', 'utterly', 'charming', 'delightful', 'backstory', 'set', 'imaginary', 'town', 'Vigata', 'sea', 'covet', 'house', 'meet', 'young', 'Commissario', 'who', 'still', 'bowlegged', 'utterly', 'charming', 'full', 'mop', 'curly', 'hair', 'heartthrobbingly', 'gorgeous', 'Che', 'bellissimo', 'writers', 'directors', 'have', 'enhanced', 'plausibility', 'entire', 'story', 'giving', 'real', 'history', 'established', 'Montalbano', 'series', 'introducing', 'younger', 'versions', 'denizens', 'Questura', 'watchful', 'eye', 'territory', 'Vigata', 'Montelusa', 'Salvo', 'Montalbano', 'mentored', 'Fazio', 'simpatico', 'father', 'younger', 'Catarella', 'endearingly', 'misbegotten', 'older', 'Caterella', 'young', 'Fazio', 'straight', 'police', 'academy', 'tack-sharp', 'lady-killer', 'Mimi', 'Augello', 'full', 'moustache', 'full', 'himself.We', 'meet', 'beautiful', 'usually', 'absent', 'Livia', 'perfect', 'match', 'young', 'Salvo', 'also', 'discover', 'exactly', 'why', 'absent', 'most', 'time', 'Salvo', 'consumed', 'investigating', 'local', 'petty', 'crimes', 'as', 'well', 'spectacular', 'murders', 'chemistry', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'also', 'understand', 'why', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'series', 'also', 'learn', 'history', 'estrangement', 'Salvo', 'father', 'discover', 'Salvo', 'continuing', 'love', 'affair', 'characteristic', 'cuisine', 'Sicily', 'how', 'Adellina', 'succulent', '-arrancini-', 'rice', 'croquettes', 'life.This', 'series', 'everything', 'intriguing', 'mysteries', 'glorious', 'settings', 'shot', 'Ragusa', 'endearing', 'characters', 'character', 'down', 'cleaning', 'ladies', 'shopkeepers', 'individual', 'rather', 'stereotypical', 'haunting', 'Sicilian', 'melodies', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'very', 'Italian', 'full', 'gems', 'will', 'have', 'resonance', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'Italy', 'Sicily', 'e.g.', 'special', 'delivery', 'letters', 'sent', 'one', 'end', 'Vigata', 'take', 'five', 'days', 'arrive', 'other', 'end', 'very', 'small', 'town', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'series', 'encouraged', 'do', 'so', 'only', 'drawback', 'buying', 'Italian', 'DVD', 'image', 'sharp', 'sound', 'clear', 'subtitles', '[', 'expunged', 'salty', 'language', ']', 'well', 'done', 'price', 'definitely', 'worth', 'saving', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Il', 'Giovane', 'Montalbano', 'anyone', 'who', 'Italy', 'Sicily', 'course']",The Young Montalbano: Episodes 1-3

1595984,A3S4YVPGHSD5I8,B009ERK1AE,James Ellsworth,"[0, 0]","As with so many reviewers, we own all the 'Montalbano' DVDs...and we have read all the novels, too.  The now classic episodes (really each one is worthy of being a feature movie) were just about as perfect as cinema can get:  great locations, crystal-clear photography, casting that could not be better from star to character roles.  Plotting is always excellent.  These things continue in the new series.I think that many fans will admit that even the great Luca Zingaretti was almost getting too old to be believable in the role of a dedicated chief of detectives who couldn't commit to marriage.  Certainly, the wonderful actor who played Mimi Augello was beyond being the 'Lothario' of Camilleri's novels.  In some of the final episodes, the superb character actor who played the medical examiner and was the frequent foil for many exchanges does not appear to be in good health himself.  How could this franchise continue?My wife wanted more and bought this new series.  I was a bit skeptical but was almost immediately won over by the total experience.  The cover photo of the 'young Montalbano' does not begin to do justice to this young actor's talent.  He makes the role his own while subtly adopting a little of Luca Zingarelli's speech mannerisms and the script writing also helps him to form a firm connection.  Pacing is as good as ever and the stories have Montalbano still outsmarting the local Mafia families by 'working outside the box' of bureaucratic police procedures.  Character roles are still well-cast.  There are some different locations, too:  I was beginning to recognize a few too many places from story to story in the original series. Viewers can still expect to see some gratuitous female nudity in the episodes...but not so much as in the first series.  Perhaps Italian film conventions are changing?Best wishes to the current 'Montabano' team!

1595989,A2W4INU85BOHN6,B009ERK1AE,"Mark Pastin ""shank not""","[19, 21]","The Young Montalbano is a prequel to the very popular Detective Montalbano Italian mystery series. The Montalbano shows were originally aired in the United States on the MegaHertDetective Montalbano: Episodes 1-3z Networks in the Washington, D.C. area and quickly built a national cult following. Salvo Montablano is a Sicilian detective who works for the police as opposed to what the Italians call ""the flying squad"" and he is one of the great characters of detective fiction. Each of the Montalbano's is a movie in itself, with movie quality production in every sense. There is so much to love about these shows - acting, comedy, cinematography, script - that it is hard to know where to begin.Young Montalbano shows the early years of Detective Montalbano. When the actors in Montalbano became too expensive or weary of their roles, RAI could not think of substituting others. Followers of Montalbano  are too attached to the characters. So they came up with the Young Montalbano prequel. This sort of thing never works, and yet this time it does. The same qualities that made the original series so popular are evident here. Even though this is a prequel, the stories stand on their own. The common thread of quality through these shows is that the writer of the Montalbano books, on which the series are based, Andrea Camilleri, has stayed directly involved in the productions. He obviously loves and protects the characters.As good as the young Montalbano is, I think most viewers will wish that they had started with the original Montalbano series. If you haven't seen the original shows, a lot of the references in the Young Montalbano can not be deciphered. The whole Montalbano experience is wonderfully addictive.
