I think it was the most original and exhilarating moment I've ever seen on network television. This show had real courage (other episodes made fun of FOX and savaged Scientology (Doomsday Defense of Jose Chung - not sure if that was year 2 or 3)).

Olmo,"[16, 41]","The second season of Millenium, the series created by X Files creator Chris Carter, represents something of a quandary for any sensible person or persons who are aquainted with the first season of the series.  First off, if anyone bothers to remember the first season of Millenium, it was in fact your usual crime/drama show but with a spin.Its main protagonist Frank Black was NOT a psychic per se but he had a unusual uncanny ability to put himself in a killers head and see their eyes which gave him less then a desirable reputation and made him something of a outcast among his law enforcement peers.  Because of this ability which I doubt anyone would be happy to possess, it understandably has almost cost Frank his sanity and affected his relationship with his loved ones, that being his wife Cathrine Black and his young daughter Jordan.Turns out after a hiatus Frank was lured back into the crime fighting business by joining a organization called the Millenium Group. Now mind you in the first season this group was nothing more than former law enforcement personell who believed in some oddball things that normal police groups would'nt mess with but even though they bore no resemblence to how the group was portrayed after season one.First off like I said the regular show dealt with episodes dealing with demented murderers, serial killers and the like. However dark these episodes were they had nothing to do with the supernatural or ""The truth is out there"" sort of thing such as the ""X Files""  For all intents and purposes Millenium, at least the first season was a cop/drama/horror type of series with the main spin being Frank Blacks abilities to think and see what the killer(s) see and think.  The Millenium Group, represented by Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) was a group comprised of former law enforcement proffessionals who as it turned out just had a tad more resources for Frank to turn to for help  than your local Police or even FBI office.In season 2, Millenium degenerated into this weird cult kind of organization that was obsessed with the coming end of the world with the new Millenium (The year 2000) approaching hence the series name. Ofcourse as I have stated the Millenium group was seen as a bunch of mystics and soothsayers and cultist who had their own prophecies and the like regarding the ""end times"" and all sorts of things and i'll repeat it once more the Millenium Group in season 2 bore no resemblence of what they were introduced as in Season 1.Interestingly even the actor Lance Henriksen who protrayed Frank Black was extremely disappointed in the way the direction of the 2nd season was heading. He said when he learned of what the 2nd season of Millenium was supposed to be like he was aghast and disillusioned extremely.  He wanted it to follow the formular of the first season but he didnt know what to make of the new direction the series was taking with secret clubs, rites, end of the world, the supernatural and the like.Dont get me wrong I LIKED some of season 2 and when it comes out on dvd i'll buy it but just remember this series started out NOTHING like it ended. It went from above average crime/horror type of thingie to this ridiculous absurd science fiction type of thing that just got too too silly in the end. Its unknown why the formular was changed for Millenium after the first season but I guess someone at Fox thought a straight crime drama (Season 1) just wouldn't cut it so it became unfortunately what it became. Much to the chargrin of its lead actor who disapproved which should tell the so called ""fans"" something but I guess no one bothered to listen.  Geez, now let me see, I mean really if you wanted a tv series of that kind of nature, did'nt everyone already have the X Files for that?All in all Millenium the second season does have a few standout episodes such as ""Beware of Dog"" which is my favorite but all in all I would have preferred it stuck to being the very dark crime drama it was in the first season without spiraling downward into all this apocalyptic silliness but i'm just a consumer. What do  my views count for anyways?Oh well, just remember want to remember Millenium in its pure form? Just watch the first season and that should give you the main gist of what is was MEANT to be. Without all the OTHER stuff.  Thanks and take care.",3,"Millenium Second Season.

861524,A2EWA6WBOJO1QC,B000667HBS,"bdlion ""Have Gun Will Travel""","[9, 10]","Shifting from the bleak, horror-filled episodes of the first season, the second season of ""Millennium"" presented many changes, with mixed results.First, the emphasis went away from the gruesome killings to the personal travails of Frank Black, delving into his character and making him a richer personality. The focus on the arcane Millennium Group was also another change that created a ""mythology"" similar to that in the ""X-Files."" A new character, Lara Means, added more depth and a worthy ""partner"" for Frank Black.Gone were the interesting quotes which began each episode in season one (although a few episodes did have them), replaced by the episode titles after the intro. The fade-in with the dramatic tones which introduced the show after each chapter break was less prominant. Also missing from alot of episodes was Kathryn and Jordan Black, integral characters that balance the dark mood of the show.The first three discs mostly explore Frank Black's character and are for the most part enjoyable. With disc Four, there is a return to some of the darker and unnerving episodes from season one, beginning with ""The Mikado."" The two-part ""Owls"" and ""Roosters"" are also stand-out episodes.It would have been impossible to continue this series as nothing more than a graphic horrorfest exploring some of the scariest and realistic murders ever depicted on television. Wisely, Morgan/Wong, who took over the helm of Millennium after the sudden departure of Chris Carter, decided to focus on the Millennium Group, Frank Black's character, and on the supporting characters, especially Peter Watts. The result is mostly a welcome direction, with some episodes dragging, and others simply outstanding.Regardless, this season is highly watchable and trashes just about every show on television today. Skip those moronic ""reality"" shows, turn your brain on, and watch Millennium, still one of the most intelligent television shows created.",4,"""Your Gift is Like a Bad Christmas Present You Can't Return""",1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,1939,"['Shifting', 'bleak', 'horror-filled', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'Millennium', 'presented', 'many', 'changes', 'mixed', 'results.First', 'emphasis', 'went', 'away', 'gruesome', 'killings', 'personal', 'travails', 'Frank', 'Black', 'delving', 'character', 'making', 'richer', 'personality', 'focus', 'arcane', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'was', 'also', 'change', 'created', 'mythology', 'similar', 'X-Files', 'new', 'character', 'Lara', 'Means', 'added', 'more', 'depth', 'worthy', 'partner', 'Frank', 'Black.Gone', 'were', 'interesting', 'quotes', 'began', 'episode', 'season', 'one', 'few', 'episodes', 'did', 'have', 'replaced', 'episode', 'titles', 'intro', 'fade-in', 'dramatic', 'tones', 'introduced', 'show', 'chapter', 'break', 'was', 'less', 'prominant', 'Also', 'missing', 'alot', 'episodes', 'was', 'Kathryn', 'Jordan', 'Black', 'integral', 'characters', 'balance', 'dark', 'mood', 'show.The', 'first', 'three', 'discs', 'mostly', 'explore', 'Frank', 'Black', 'character', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'enjoyable', 'disc', 'Four', 'return', 'darker', 'unnerving', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'beginning', 'Mikado', 'two-part', 'Owls', 'Roosters', 'are', 'also', 'stand-out', 'episodes.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'continue', 'series', 'nothing', 'more', 'graphic', 'horrorfest', 'exploring', 'scariest', 'realistic', 'murders', 'ever', 'depicted', 'television', 'Wisely', 'Morgan/Wong', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'helm', 'Millennium', 'sudden', 'departure', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'decided', 'focus', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'Frank', 'Black', 'character', 'supporting', 'characters', 'especially', 'Peter', 'Watts', 'result', 'mostly', 'welcome', 'direction', 'episodes', 'dragging', 'others', 'simply', 'outstanding.Regardless', 'season', 'highly', 'watchable', 'trashes', 'just', 'show', 'television', 'today', 'Skip', 'moronic', 'reality', 'shows', 'turn', 'brain', 'watch', 'Millennium', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'television', 'shows', 'created']",N/A
861525,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000667HBS,C. Middleton,"[4, 5]","Millennium was one of the great television series of the 90's. Its dark and brooding lead character, Frank Black, ex FBI serial killer profiler, working for the mysterious Millennium Group, uses his gift of feeling, recognizing and relating to pure evil, is one of the most interesting characters in television history. Season 1 predominately focused on the solving of dastardly crimes, where local police used the expertise of Frank Black and the Group, with their high tech equipment and mysterious access to information on just about everything and everyone, to solve the crime. Season 2, however, set off in an entirely new direction, focusing on biblical prophecy, Masonic conspiracies, Gnostic scripture, and the inevitable arrival of the apocalypse.In the documentary of the making of season 2, Chris Carter discusses his lack of involvement due to other commitments, handing over the reigns to Glen Morgan and James Wong. Morgan and Wong are excellent writers, revealing that they certainly did their research into the esoteric traditions of the occult and Christian lore. Though the most interesting shows came from Glen Morgan's brother, Darin, in the episodes, ""Jose Chung's Doomsday Defence"" and "" Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me"". More than anything else, these particular episodes are social satires, parodies on New Age religions and the sad lives we lead in modern society. These shows were far removed from the Millennium's usual serious nature, and unfortunately managed low ratings at the time of their broadcast. In my opinion, however, these two episodes are the cleverest instalments in the entire second season.My favourite episode would have to be ""Anamnesis"", expertly written by Erin Maher and Kay Reindl, and directed by John Peter Kousakis. This episode, well before the publication of ""The Da Vinci Code"", addresses the legend of Mary Magdalene and the Holy Bloodline of the Grail. A little girl and her friends have witnessed the manifestation of Mary in their local church and the whole town is up in arms, claiming demonic possession. The little girl quotes lines from Gnostic scripture and owns a statue of the mysterious Black Virgin. Maher and Reindl truly did their research because the few lines that the little girl quotes in the film is actually from The Gospel of Mary Magdalene, word for word. This episode was made years before the current ""Da Vinci Code"" craze, which shows that Millennium was truly unto something.As the second season progresses, the Millennium Group start to unravel from within as there is a schism between two opposing philosophies, the Owls and the Roosters. These episodes begin the reveal the Masonic, cult-like nature of the Group, and Frank Black, separated from his family because of the group, begins to doubt their intentions. As the season draws to a close, everything picks up speed, leading to the last episode, ""The Time is Now"", where a deadly virus is spreading across the world. Is this the end of the world?The Complete Second Season includes six discs and 22 episodes, including an informative documentary about its making.

861526,A2BT578J4IZOK6,B000667HBS,"Craobh Rua ""Craobh Rua""","[9, 14]","Created by Chris Carter, ""Millennium"" first appeared on television in 1996. It stars Lance Henriksen as Frank Black, a former FBI Agent who specialised in profiling serial killers. Frank retired from the Bureau after suffering a breakdown and moved from Washington to Seattle. However, he didn't completely sever his ties with the world in which he once worked and joined a team of ex-law enforcement agents known as the ""Millennium Group"". During season one the group appeared happy to lend their expertise to whatever investigation required their help.With season one, Carter successfully created a murder-mystery show that was dark, could be disturbing and had a real sense of evil. Unlike ""The X-Files"", there wasn't anything 'unusual' about the show. Frank was not supposed to be a psychic, nor was his gift a form of telepathy - he was simply a very talented serial profiler who could put himself in the killer's head. However, for season two, Carter was a little too busy with the X-Files to take the same hands-on approach. As a result, Glen Morgan and James Wong were brought in as Executive Producers - the pair also wrote a substantial part of the season and changed the focus of the show entirely. If anything, season two became exactly what season one wasn't : rather than the dark murder-mystery show it had been, it morphed into a conspiracy-based, X-Files clone.As the show's central character, these changes have a direct impact on Frank - one of the key changes centres on his ability. With season two, Frank's gift becomes firmly established as some form of psychic ability that can be passed from one generation to another. Frank's thoughts and comments are, at times, so surreal that he almost becomes Fox Mulder with wrinkles. It's also revealed that he's a big fan of Bobby Darin. This wouldn't have been a problem, only for Morgan and Wong's insistence on including Darin's songs in the show - a distracting and slightly irritating decision. However, it's what Frank did at the end of the season's opening episode - ""The Beginning and the End"" - that really had me scratching my head. His actions, in my opinion, simply didn't tie up with the character that was established in Season One - most obviously when compared with his behaviour in Season One's ""The Thin White Line"".Season Two does reveal a great deal more about the Millennium Group. However, its role in providing consulting expertise to various law enforcement agencies now appears to be a front and it becomes a devious, manipulative organisation. As the season progresses, it focuses more on the Group's internal politics, and less on actual investigations - although, thankfully, Peter Watts now plays a greater role. A couple of new characters are also introduced. One, Lara Means, is essentially a female version of Frank - she is a Millennium Group candidate and has visions. Unfortunately, it seemed to me that none of the writers really had much of an idea what to do with her. Brian Roedecker, meanwhile, was an unnecessary and irritating addition and one that computer geeks everywhere will find offensive - think Jar Jar Binks without the merchandising potential.While Season One was consistently excellent, I could only describe Season Two as patchy. I enjoyed some of the episodes a great deal - ""The Curse of Frank Black"" and ""Midnight of the Century"" take a peek into Frank's past, the former also having a nice Hallow'een twist to it. ""Owls"" and ""Roosters"", which deal with a near-civil war within the Group, are two very good conspiracy-driven episodes. Some episodes could've been just as good, but were let down by slightly weak endings - for example, ""The Hand of Saint Sebastian"" (an episode also hampered by Roedecker) and ""The Mikado"" (at last - a serial killer !). Others, however, seem like scripts intended for The X-Files, with only minor changes being made for this show. ""Sirens"" sees Frank behaving like Mulder, with Lara Means playing the Scully role. Lara subsequently switches sides, playing the Believer in ""Anamnesis"", while Catherine plays the Sceptic. (First broadcast five years before a famous bestseller by Dan Brown was published, it avoids beginning with a list of 'facts'. Brown's fans should enjoy it, all the same). A word of warning though - ""Jose Chung's Doomsday Defence"" and ""Somehow Satan Got Behind Me"" are abysmal and are best avoided.Overall, I'd have to say I was a disappointed with season two. Morgan and Wong turned down an invitation to contribute to the 'making-of-season-two' documentary - a shame, as that might have helped me understand why the show changed so dramatically. Perhaps unfairly, I couldn't help comparing it with Season One. While ""this is who we are"" seems to have become a catchphrase for the Group's members, at times I couldn't help thinking ""but this is not who you should be"". If your likes include conspiracies and the X-Files, there'll probably be enough here to keep you happy. If, on the other hand, you're hoping for a continuation of the very dark murder-mystery show, you'll be disappointed.",3,One Is The All,1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,5067,"['Created', 'Chris',

He manages to get her back but pays a large price.  In killing the kidnapper, Frank now must live away from his wife and daughter.  And the yellow house, Frank's sanctuary from the evil of the world, the only good in his life, is now lost.We now delve deeper into the Millenial Apocolyptical overtones.  The actual Millennium group is not what Frank once believed.  Those trying to cease the comming time are the ones who are bringing it about.  The Group has many dark secrets that Frank must uncover (as well as evil men to stop) to hopefully stop this dreadful fate of the world.  In a world filled with men who are kidnapping children to save them from the end's destruction, a world where a woman is rasing an army for her liege, in a world where demons and angels are walking amongst us in the streets (unknown by most of us); this will not be an easy task.

861529,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B000667HBS,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 1]","The second season of ""Millennium"" takes a competely different turn than what Chris Carter had intended. The writers Glen Morgan and James Wong took control over the project when Chris Carter had so much in his hands (the continuation of ""The X Files"" TV series, and the ""X Files"" movie). Here, Morgan and Wong focused more on the Millenium Group and its religious & political origins, backgrounds, authoritarian leadership, etc. There are much fewer episodes that deal with serial killers and mass murderers, which is a bit disappointing to me (Season One is still my favorite season). When watching the second season, the atmosphere is similar to ""The X-Files,"" only this deals more of the cult rather than aliens and government conspiracies.But it's NOT a terrible season, really. The Millennium Group is quite interesting, and there is much more suspense here than in the first season. Lance Henriksen returns in his perfect portrayal of Frank Black, a man who has a gift of seeing into the minds of killers and madmen. Catherine Black, played by Megan Gallagher, is absent in many episodes, so it's sort of a loss. Kristen Cloke is no doubt a great actress, but the character she plays (Lara Means) is somewhat of an irritant in several episodes (""Monster,"" ""Anamnesis,"" and ""Midnight of the Century"".) but in other episodes she adapts well to the environment (""Owls and Roosters"" rings a bell). Terry O'Quinn returns as Peter Watts, and his chemstry with Frank becomes deeper and more sophisticated.Episodes that stand out are:* Beware of the Dog - you get a sense of what the Millennium Group is all about.* A Single Blade of Grass - Native American mythology is so fascinating.* The Curse of Frank Black/Midnight of the Century - Awesome Halloween and Christmas episodes; we delve into Frank's past in a creepy and beautiful way.* Luminary - Astrology and Astronomy are the central keys here.* The Mikado - FINALLY, an episode about a serial killer. This one, named ""Avatar,"" is similar to that of the notorious Zodiac Killer, and he uses the internet as his killing ground. Lost of tension here.* Owls/Roosters - A two-part episode that's also about the Millenium Group. Wagner's ""Parsifal"" is so refreshing to listen to here.* The Fourth Horsemen/The Time is Now - This is the finale to Season Two, and it's both tragic and scary. The Marburg Virus returns and the Millenium Group is the one that's letting it affect people all across the globe.The weakest episodes have to be ""19:19"" and ""Anamnesis."" The teenage characters of ""Anamnesis"" are completely annoying, and the religious overtone in both are a bit too much for me.Overall, this is a completely different atmosphere than in Season One.

861531,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B000667HBS,Flash,"[1, 1]","About half way through the episodes of Millenium Season 2, I started to become mesmerized by the progression of storytelling and imagery. By the end of the season, I had realized that when its at it's best, Millenium is even better than the X-Files!This season begins with the episode ""The Beginning and the End"" which is a resolution of sorts of the 1st season cliffhanger. Admittedly, the first handful of episodes thereafter are a bit flat and you start to wonder if the new creative team (Chris Carter is not creatively involved with Season 2) messed up everything that was good about Millenium in season 1.But then the show starts to hit its stride with the episode 19:19 (about a search for a busload of missng children) and then subsequently, the Millenium Group enters the picture in a much more prominent and mysterious way starting in ""The Hand of St. Sebastian"". The story arc the rest of the way is a thrill ride to the end, occasionally interrupted by some offbeat and quirky episodes (GOOD ONES: Midnight of the Century, Goodbye Charlie, Somehow Satan Got Behind Me. BAD ONE: Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense)Overall, I'd say that this season deals with Frank Black's (the main character) involvement with the mysterious Millenium Group. Gradually, he learns a little bit about who they are, what they believe and what they do. But he also learns of the committment that is expected of him to obtain full membership.The supporting cast in season 2 is excellent. The development of the Lara Means character (Frank Black's Millenium Group partner) is both interesting and surreal, and culminates in a 10 minute sequence at the end of the episode ""The Fourh Horseman"" that is downright mindblowing for how innovative it is.  It is probably the most distinctly avant-garde scene I've even seen in a TV show! For Peter Watts (played by Lost's Terry O'Quinn), the main issue is the conflict between his faith in the Millenium Group vs. the effects of the group's unrelenting methods to achieve its aims both on its members and the world at large. And then there is the Lucy Butler character, which I think is one of the most creepy and well done evil characters ever. The episode with Lucy Butler, ""A Room With No View"" is amazingly good.Yes, season 2 is different from season 1. It is stylistically different and it is atmospherically different. The story goes in a different direction, but in the end, it is every bit as good as season 1.",5,"Incredible!!!

861534,A3DFI6J9S1WBED,B000667HBS,G. B. Brown,"[6, 11]","Following up Season One of Millenium was a tough task.  Season One was dark, gruesome, gothic, even at times disturbing look at the human ability to believe in horrible things and then make them happen.  To my mind, the Pilot episode remains one of TV's most powerful and unusual hours.  Despite being 10 years old, it retains its shocking power.  Season Two didn't quite off the rails entirely but it lost much of the vision (and horror) that made Season One memorable.Everything wrong with Season Two is present in the first episode.  The dark imagery remains, but is stripped of its power.  The criminal is surprisingly shallow, his motivation remains oblique; there's no sense (unlike season one) of an individual driven by horrific and distorted but recognizably human motivations; he is bad for the sake of bad; the denouement of the episode feels more like a plot device than a reasonable if extreme response by the characters.And now the grand conspiracy:  Watching this season, I'm convinced that X-Files succeeded despite the conspiracy, not because of it.  Trying to build the same sort of conspiracy on Millenium drained too much energy and creativity - it sucked the air out of the room and left everything else gasping.  It ultimately misread what made the show great viewing - as viewers we didn't really care about the Millenium Group's machinations; we cared about Frank Black and his tenuous connections with other persons, and about the persons around him.  It was a character driven show.  Grafting conspiracy onto it reduced the characters to puppets of the conspiracy, not persons.  When the Millienium Group programmers set Frank's password as ""Soylent green is people"" it was obviously intended to be morbidly funny.  Unfortunately, it felt hopelessly geeky.

861538,A3SB58PKQOGHAK,B000667HBS,JD,"[10, 13]","Season Two of Millennium is a true masterpiece. Everything about this season (and all three seasons) is artistically stunning -  the writing, cinematography, acting and music are all perfect. The dark & brooding atmosphere of season one still remains but is now re-focused with a mystical/supernatural tone as implied by the shows title.  This change brought about by Wong and Morgan was a masterstroke and made the series infinitely more accessible to causal viewers - especially those who were turned off by season one's brutality.I have often felt that the ""Millennium"" itself had nothing to do with the physical destruction of the world, but rather, the collapse in collective ""saneness"" - the balance between perceived reality and actuality.  The disparity between the two becomes closer at the height of the Millennium and this show wonderfuly depicts the pure mainfestations of this imbalance - the rise in evil and its battle with the forces of good.Moving on to the main characters, we find that Frank Black is becoming a disillusioned soul who is now seriously questioning the agenda of the very people he works for.  His scepticism arises from the darkly covert and shadowy nature of the Millennium Group and its unorthodox ways of dealing with information.As a polar opposite to Frank's gift of criminal cognizance, we are introduced to a Millennium Group candidate and forensic psychologist - Lara Means. Lara, like Frank, is also a tortured soul who can sense the presence of evil but deviates from Frank in her ability to see angels as an ominous warning of danger.  Her character is fleshed out considerably in the later parts of this season and is given a highly dramatic sendoff at the seasons conclusion. Lara and Frank together form a working alliance and appear to enjoy and respect each others company when solving crimes.The most outstanding episodes in this Season are:  ""Monster"", ""The hand of Saint Sebastian"", ""The curse of Frank Black"", ""Midnight of the Century"", ""Luminary"", ""The Mikado"", ""Owls"", ""Roosters"", ""Anamnesis"", ""The Fourth Horseman"" & ""The Time Is Now"". All the other episodes are excellent although some of the more comedic ones - ""Jose Chungs Doomsday Defense"" & ""Somehow, Satan got behind me"" feel a little peculiar and out of place but still entertaining nonetheless.I can't finish this review without mentioning a truly astonishing and highly ingenious scene in ""The Time Is Now"" where Lara Means descends into insanity.  The scene is 9-mins long and is simply staggering in its imagery and intensity - a truly daring piece of TV which will never be seen again.The Millennium Season 2 DVD set is highly recommended for viewers who enjoy intelligent, thought-provoking TV.",5,A supremely fine season of a phenomenal show,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,2716,"['Season', 'Two', 'Millennium', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'Everything', 'season', 'three', 'seasons', 'artistically', 'stunning', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'music', 'are', 'perfect', 'dark', 'brooding', 'atmosphere', 'season', 'one', 'still', 'now', 're-focused', 'mystical/supernatural', 'tone', 'implied', 'shows', 'title', 'change', 'brought', 'about', 'Wong', 'Morgan', 'was', 'masterstroke', 'made', 'series', 'infinitely', 'more', 'accessible', 'causal', 'viewers', 'especially', 'who', 'were', 'turned', 'off', 'season', 'one', 'brutality.I', 'have', 'often', 'felt', 'Millennium', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'physical', 'destruction', 'world', 'rather', 'collapse', 'collective', 'saneness', 'balance', 'perceived', 'reality', 'actuality', 'disparity', 'two', 'becomes', 'closer', 'height', 'Millennium', 'show', 'pure', 'mainfestations', 'imbalance', 'rise', 'evil', 'battle', 'forces', 'good.Moving', 'main', 'characters', 'find', 'Frank', 'Black', 'becoming', 'disillusioned', 'soul', 'who', 'now', 'seriously', 'questioning', 'agenda', 'very', 'people', 'scepticism', 'darkly', 'covert', 'shadowy', 'nature', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'unorthodox', 'ways', 'dealing', 'information.As', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Frank', 'gift', 'criminal', 'cognizance', 'are', 'introduced', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'candidate', 'forensic', 'psychologist', 'Lara', 'Means', 'Lara', 'Frank', 'also', 'tortured', 'soul', 'who', 'can', 'sense', 'presence', 'evil', 'Frank', 'ability', 'see', 'angels', 'ominous', 'warning', 'danger', 'character', 'fleshed', 'out', 'considerably', 'later', 'parts', 'season', 'given', 'highly', 'dramatic', 'sendoff', 'seasons', 'conclusion', 'Lara', 'Frank', 'together', 'form', 'working', 'alliance', 'appear', 'enjoy', 'respect', 'others', 'company', 'when', 'solving', 'crimes.The', 'most', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'Season', 'are', 'Monster', 'hand', 'Saint', 'Sebastian', 'curse', 'Frank', 'Black', 'Midnight', 'Century', 'Luminary', 'Mikado', 'Owls', 'Roosters', 'Anamnesis', 'Fourth', 'Horseman', 'Time', 'Now', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'excellent', 'more', 'comedic', 'ones', 'Jose', 'Chungs', 'Doomsday', 'Defense', 'Somehow', 'Satan', 'got', 'feel', 'little', 'peculiar', 'place', 'still', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'finish', 'review', 'mentioning', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'highly', 'ingenious', 'scene', 'Time', 'Now', 'where', 'Lara', 'Means', 'insanity', 'scene', '9-mins', 'long', 'simply', 'staggering', 'imagery', 'intensity', 'truly', 'daring', 'piece', 'TV', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again.The', 'Millennium', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'intelligent', 'thought-provoking', 'TV']",N/A

It's what ""The X-Files"" was all about, as is season two of ""Millennium."" The show's conspiracy angle is fresh and gripping. They play up themes comparable to Dan Brown and his ""DaVinci Code"" almost five years beforehand. It was very surprising to see such a shady organization as the Millennium group turn religious and almost pious, but it works very well here.Chris Carter took a back seat for season two, leaving the reins to the creative team behind several episodes of ""The X-Files"" and ""Space: Above and Beyond"" Glenn Morgan and James Wong. They would deliver a breath of fresh air into the series. Some fans thought it was too big of a change, but not me. The writing and just overall production quality is greatly improved, which is why I believe it is the better out of the first two series.After a rather disappointing finale of season one where Catherine is taken in an airport (as an American I easily forget how normal airport security was before 9/11), Frank eventually finds out that the man who captured his wife is also the stalker taking all the Polaroids. He winds up killing him in front of Catherine, and this leads to a split of the family. Frank wearily continues his work for Millennium and Peter Watts. The two men become the main characters this season. Frank is given a much needed character boost by season two creative team Morgan and Wong and Watts' character is also revealed more and more throughout the episodes. This is great character development which I looked forward to and was very pleased to watch.My favorite episodes include a ghastly episode about a Zodiac-killer copycat, the owls/roosters arc, a Jose Chung episode, and the two holiday-themed episodes that show us a doorway to Frank's past. There are few weak episodes however, including ones involving virgin births, assisted suicide and surprisingly, the satire about Frank with the devils which had been praised. In my opinion, it may be the worst episode of the run. Still, season two of ""Millennium"" is definitely worth your money in my opinion.

It was called ""The darkest show on television"", with good reason-definitely not for the faint of heart.  It introduced the Group as former FBI agents who acted as private investigators for cases having to do with ""Millennium Fever"".  We rarely got to see any more of the Group than Peter Watts, who did an impeccable job-my favorite character in the show.  Season two continued the cliffhanger from season one, with the kidnapping of Frank's wife.  It was in this second year that we got to look inside the Group.  Their history paralleled that of the Freemasons, an ancient secret society with religious cult-like overtones.  We found out that the Group was putting Frank through special cases in order to teach him, to fully induct him into their membership.  These were people who were ostensibly trying to prevent the apocalypse, but in fact were orchestrating it.  Everyone has their favorite season.  But this second year was what appealed to me the most.  And when it comes to a season finale, none can compare with ""The Time Is Now"".  Originally it was to be the final episode.

861545,ATBADDXLX27EW,B000667HBS,kidnugget,"[18, 19]","I've already written a rave review of season one, so now I'll add a few notes on season two.  Season one of this show is a crime drama with a hint of conspiracy and spiritual darkness.  Season, two, however, pulls back the covers and lets you begin to see the real world of Frank Black.  Rumors abound that due to sagging ratings, Carter tried some new tricks to pull ratings to the show (a common and necessary evil of Hollywood mainstream television); this may be true, but either way, the changes in season two are wonderful.In seasons two, Frank's visions begin to make more sense to an audience, and the supernatural plays a much larger part in the story lines.  It's less about a retired profiler and more about stemming off the end of the world.  We begin to see our first demons and our first hints at the sinister machinations of ""The Group.""One Amazon review says that season two panders and plays to comedy.  I'm not sure what show this reviewer was watching.  I found season two to be at times so brutal it was difficult to watch (in a good way!).  As for an occasional comic foray in the series, I think that's called variety, and it is needed in any show.  The same feel and the same story arcs week after week are series suicide.  By showing a funny glimpse of the Millennial world every now and then, and by making Frank more human, the show gains a broader appeal.  It's not grim faced, tight lipped Frank Black the sketch from season one; it's Frank Black the person, now.Any review that looks at the world of Millennium and X-Files, a world of alien abductions, face-less alien rebels, and demons walking among us to secure the end times and says that the world has become ""increasingly fantastic and unbelievable"" obviously missed the point of the entire genre.  Bring it on.  Show us the strange.  That's the whole point.  We wanted to laugh a bit even in this grim world; we wanted to be shocked and see the demons instead of theorizing about them, we wanted some change and fresh story lines and questions raised about the nature of The Group.  And we got it in season two.If you liked season one, you'll love season two.  Actually, if you didn't like season one, you'll like season two also.

I don't care what they say.  This was one of the most riveting seasons in the history of television.  Henriksen and Terry O'Quinn (you know him as the enigmatic character Locke on the blockbuster series Lost) were brilliant.  The chemistry between these two was perfection in casting.  You never really knew just what Peter Watts' (O'Quinn) motives were.  I can't think of any turkey episodes in this season . It was full of spooky, mind-numbing paranoia.  The season's final episode ""The Time is Now"" has an absolutely jaw-dropping sequence of hallucinations based on the book of Revelations accompanied by the music of Patty Smith while Kristin Cloak's character Laura Means has her mental meltdown .  Very intense stuff!  The season is full of conspiracy possibilities involving everyone from the Knights of the Templar to Nazi war criminals hiding in South America, all trying to get their hands on relics such as the Spear of Destiny, the hand of Saint Sebastian,  and a piece of the cross upon which Christ was executed.  There is even a tell-tale Morley cigarette butt playing homage to The Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files.  Every sinister character you can imagine, including Lucy Butler a.k.a the devil appears in the second season.The episode with Charles Nelson Riley reprising his role of Jose Chung alone is worth the cost of the series.

X-Files creator Carter, stepped aside during pre-production of the season, and X-Files alumni Glen Morgan and James Wong molded the show into something different.  Morgan and Wong craft a surrounding mythology around the elements introduced in the first season, much like what was done on the early and brilliant seasons of the X-Files, and it pays off exceptionally.  The serial killers who were to have played pivotal roles in armageddon that populated the first season of Millennium were replaced by placing the focus on Frank Black's (Lance Henriksen) search for redemption, and just what the true intentions are of the sinister Millennium Group.  Frank's struggle to maintain a normal relationship with his daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) in the wake of the tragic events surrounding his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and the stalking ""Polaroid Man"" from season one.  Henriksen is ever perfect in the role he was born to play, proving that the actor, mainly known for his sci-fi film roles, is a very underrated actor.  The episodes range from darkly humerous to beyond chilling, culminating in a climax that opens the door for season three.  The real tragedy of it all however, is that season three would be the final season of Millennium before it's cancelation.  This is just another show which was prematurely canceled by Fox, just like Carter's other show Harsh Realm and Joss Whedon's Firefly suffered similar fates.

861558,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B000667HBS,Robert Blake,"[5, 5]","By the time ""Millennium"" rolled into its second season the series creator, Chris Carter, was forced out of his usual head production duties due to the simple fact that his other series ""The X-Files"" demanded his attention more (in part because by then it was already a cultural stamp), not to mention production on ""The X-Files"" movie was starting to roll and so Carter found himself having to work on a feature film in addition to his TV duties. Brought in to babysit were Glen Morgan and James Wong, the writing team behind such classic ""X-Files"" episodes like ""Tooms"" and ""Little Green Men."" It can be said that Wong and Morgan tried to bring some of what made ""The X-Files"" popular to ""Millennium,"" most notably the idea of shadow conspiracies and worldwide plots centered on truths the heroes don't really know and go through hell trying to find. Here the series takes a much different turn from what Season 1 was, which was more of an exploration of evil in the modern world and Frank Black's attempts to find peace at home with his family while catching some of the worst predators society has to offer. But Morgan and Wong don't completely turn the series around, all the apocalyptic poetry is still here as well as some gruesomely twisted serial killers and psychos. What Morgan and Wong really do add is a more epic sense of things, the episodes in season two really explore the darker sides of religion, faith and the sense that there will be an armageddon and it will happen sooner than we think. ""The Beginning And The End"" opens the season with great wit and style, Morgan and Wong brilliantly incorporate the passing comet of the time into the story, taking advantage of the superstitious lore that comes with such celestial events (which was not too far from the truth. The year in which the episode premiered, 1997, saw the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult). ""Millennium"" is one of the great thrillers ever to be produced on network TV, like no other show before it it perfectly mingled Biblical lore with true crime and questions and ideas we always have as a society. True, with Carter the show was grittier, darker and more violent, but Morgan and Wong brought a nice epic scope to the show, touching in spiritual themes many dramas today shy away from.

I had fears that the bonus features would not live up to the quality of the episodes and I was proven correct. The quality of the DVD picture and sound is excellent and the episodes still stand the test of time but I found the bonus features lacking. The participation  of Glenn Morgan and James Wong is suspiciously lacking. It would have been great to have their input and insight into such episodes as ""The Curse of Frank Black"" and ""The Time is Now"". Instead what is passed for commentary is the grumblings of Thomas J. Wright on ""The Hand of St Sebastian"". While entertaining at times, Wright's commentary deals primarily with the techinical aspect of shooting scenes and the like. The documentary on the making of Season Two is engaging but again it would have been nice to have the input of Morgan and Wong discussing why they decided to take the show in the direction that they did.

861560,A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z,B000667HBS,"Santeria ""Son of Tazz""","[4, 5]","An excellent season by any standard.The themes of the shows mostly take a look at the ""other"" side of the areas that any murder/-victim scenario shows.Specifically, the shows look at the Millennium group, the mythology around any event, and the growth/development of Frank Black.In fact, I would suggest that Frank's development is the fulcrum on which the story arc swings.There has been some criticism about the supernatural slant of the show, which is valid , however for myself I liked this, since I had felt that was what was going on in season 1, untilthe DVDs in season 1 showed me otherwise. So, maybe the producers who took the lead when Chris Carter was busy, picked up on this fairly obvious theme.The show which does not have any Frank Black, is the one where Catherine and Lara  work together to solve the case, an absolute showcase of the skills of both these wonderfulactresses.There are two commentaries of the shows, THE MIKADO,and THE HAND OF St SEBASTIAN ( where the commentary is somewhat disparaging of the other shows in general in season 2).The special features on Disc 6 are very enlightening; THE MAKING OF SEASON 2 gives a view/review of the key characters in the season, and the only key missing people are the ones who defined this  season, the lead producers. The VICTIMOLOGY feature is enlightening from the Season 1 viewpoint, and largely feels out of place in this  season's  paradigm. However, so long as you follow the main premise of this  season, it is another great pack of shows. It also has ""FrankBlack""  smiling and laughing, which in and of itself is strange, especially when one of the Demons on the Donut shop says that Frank looks like he should be taking a whole truck load of St John's Wort( SOMEHOW SATAN  GOT BEHIND ME).",5,The Flip Side of the Scene,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,1768,"['excellent', 'season', 'standard.The', 'themes', 'shows', 'mostly', 'take', 'look', 'other', 'side', 'areas', 'murder/-victim', 'scenario', 'shows.Specifically', 'shows', 'look', 'Millennium', 'group', 'mythology', 'event', 'growth/development', 'Frank', 'Black.In', 'fact', 'would', 'suggest', 'Frank', 'development', 'fulcrum', 'story', 'arc', 'swings.There', 'been', 'criticism', 'supernatural', 'slant', 'show', 'valid', 'however', 'liked', 'had', 'felt', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'season', '1', 'untilthe', 'DVDs', 'season', '1', 'showed', 'otherwise', 'So', 'maybe', 'producers', 'who', 'took', 'lead', 'when', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'was', 'busy', 'picked', 'up', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'theme.The', 'show', 'not', 'have', 'Frank', 'Black', 'one', 'where', 'Catherine', 'Lara', 'work', 'together', 'solve', 'case', 'absolute', 'showcase', 'skills', 'are', 'two', 'commentaries', 'shows', 'THE', 'MIKADO', 'THE', 'HAND', 'OF', 'St', 'SEBASTIAN', 'where', 'commentary', 'somewhat', 'disparaging', 'other', 'shows', 'general', 'season', '2', '.The', 'special', 'features', 'Disc', '6', 'are', 'very', 'enlightening', 'THE', 'MAKING', 'OF', 'SEASON', '2', 'view/review', 'key', 'characters', 'season', 'only', 'key', 'missing', 'people', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'defined', 'season', 'lead', 'producers', 'VICTIMOLOGY', 'feature', 'enlightening', 'Season', '1', 'viewpoint', 'largely', 'place', 'season', 'paradigm', 'However', 'so', 'long', 'follow', 'main', 'premise', 'season', 'great', 'pack', 'shows', 'also', 'FrankBlack', 'smiling', 'laughing', 'strange', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'Demons', 'Donut', 'shop', 'Frank', 'should', 'be', 'taking', 'whole', 'truck', 'load', 'St', 'John', 'Wort', 'SOMEHOW', 'SATAN', 'GOT', 'BEHIND', 'ME']",N/A

The writing is absolutely abominable and inexcusable. Chris Carter passed the show off to Morgan and Wong way too soon, and the show died far too soon a death because of it (the terrific season three simply couldn't bring back enough viewers, I presume). There are so many more bad (atrociously) episodes in this season than good, or even decent, that it is extremely difficult to justify its purchase, even to die-hard Chris Carter fans (meaning I own every other Carter-related DVD release (minus Harsh Realm)). My advice? Purchase and love season one. Skip season two and SPOILER: know that his wife dies from a virus that the millennium group released. Buy season three and love it. Trust me, you'll really struggle to sit through some of these episodes (namely the ""chung"" episode...what were they thinking? I lack the capacity to fully understand just how awful that episode is...), and there is just nothing redeemable in about half of them.

""Millennium"" was the Rodney Dangerfield of Fox--the show just couldn't get any respect when it stood in the shadow of the much more popular ""The X-Files"". After season one, the series found its footing with Black finally realizing that the mysterious Millennium Group wasn't the benevolent guys that they appeared to be on the surface. Once the series began to develop its own ""mythology"" it hit its stride.Lance Henriksen gives a much richer performance here in season two as he faces his own demons and those that threaten the white picket fence life he wants to lead. There are many stand out episodes here but ""Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense"", ""Somehow Satan Got Behind Me"", ""The Hand of St. Sebastian"", ""Monster"", ""Midnight of the Century"" (with the marvelous Darren McGavin), ""Roosters"", ""Owls"", ""The Curse of Frank Black"" and ""The Fourth Horsemen"" all rank up there with the best of ""The X-Files"" and ""Twin Peaks"". Each moves Black forward in some way making the character even more appealing and sympathetic.We get a featurette on the making of the second season. It's curious that writers/producers Morgan and Wong chose not to participate in the commentaries or the featurettes and that's too bad; the duo brought focus to the series and prevented it from turning into serial-killer-of-the week broadening the themes established by Carter and others during the first season. The strong season cliff hanger also is noteworthy as well but, again, we don't get much insight from the two people who contributed the most during season two. The ""Academy Group: Victimology"" featurette provided an inside view into the chilling world that surrounds people who do profiling for a living.The packaging and picture quality is, as usual, top notch. Fox has done a great job of putting this series out and at a much more reasonable price than ""The X-Files"". The third season would have its high points as well.

GREAT episode that reveals a lot of ""the group."" A MUST!!Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense ***** - This may be a love or hate episode because it often borders on humor (and brilliance). This reminds me of Wes Andersons works, like the Life Aquatic, totally surreal, and totally NOT for the masses.Midnight of the Century ***** - three fivers in a row!!? This is my fave, it is Christmas time and fuses so many different aspects of the show... and they ALL work. If more people had seen this one episode, this show would STILL be on TV.Goodbye Charlie ** - Has some interesting ideas but seems to fall back on Season Ones need for random serial killers, just kind of `eh'.Luminary ***** - Nice outdoors ep. Reveals a lot about Catherine and Frank, the ending is a bit odd though, well the near end when they leave Frank out in the woods? Great parallel story with Neptune and Pluto.Mikado *** - Liked this one. Not loved though. No Catherine and Jordan so the story shifts back to ""another criminal"", the ending is interesting though. This is ""the computer guys"" big chance and he was flat.The Pest House *** - Some good guest star performances do take up some of the slack behind a rather ho-hum (and unclear) story and script. Freddy meets Jason meets Michael Myers. Catherine and Jordan, again, MIA.Owls **** - Good ep dealing with the `Group'. Flashes of Catherine and Jordan and another solid performance by Lara Means. Great cliffhanger episode. A bit confusing as far as who's who takes away a star. (I must note that at this point in the series it's really interesting to see the original focal point of the show (Franks ""power"") being an almost ""side note"" making the characters first and foremost and to me that speaks volumes.Roosters **** - I'm starting to see why the show failed. Not because of the quality, but because of the pacing. The past 2 episodes have included enough material for at least 6. They seem to be pressing hard about the group, which doesn't bode well for a ""typical"" TV audience. Even watching these in a sort of rapid-fire format leaves me wondering huh-wha? From time to time. Great, but a bit fast.Siren **** - Very good guest star performances. Great soundtrack. A great scene of discomfort between Frank, Catherine,... and Lara. A surreal sequence in this is one of the better moments of Millennium, I only took off one star for the rather predictable climax.In Acadia Ego **** - 5 star performances hindered by a few problems I had with this. Franks lack of sympathy for the guard that was killed and the expression of complete sympathy for convicts on the run. Also, it was unclear to me why Frank let the convict walk into a ""suicide by cop."" Great message and ending though.Anamnesis: ** - I like the subject matter, but the performances by the teens involved, and even surprisingly by Catherine and Lara seemed forced and emotionless. Sad too because it was a real great opportunity for Catherine and Lara to go toe to toe and it never really worked.A Room With a View **** - Silence of the Lambs with a twist. Loved the subject matter and performances but mostly this will be a memorable show for me because of the counselors speech about ""Passing through the Numbers"". I've thought this same way for years and years. Watch this episode and learn what we have become; more accurately this is who we really are.Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me ***.5 - I liked this one. One of the ""humor-sodes."" A bit different, but with a nice direction. The only thing I fault it for is the prime opportunity to interject Frank and many of the Millennium cast into the mix and yet they don't, and the ending didn't feel finished.The Fourth Horsemen ***** - This is part one of the Season Two finale and while it may seem a bit of a stretch I love the direction of the show, totally cryptic and completely engaging. Cheers to Terry O' Quinn for helping create the series major tension. If this episode doesn't reach you, none of them will.The Time is Now ***** - Or the beginning of the end, depending on how you look at it. So much to say that I shouldn't. Sadly, I heard about the major spoiler for the ending of this episode in advance, but was still surprised to see it. I kept thinking ""No, they wouldn't... would they!?"" They did.Watching the small interview with the shows main components, I'm saddened that so many are on different pages with this second season, that is just about the only disappointing aspect for me... In fact, Glen Morgan and James Wong declined to appear, and that cuts me pretty deep. There must be some sort of major rift but at least I can my piece; Millennium: Season Two is one of the finest seasons in television... ever. I look forward to Season Three, despite what others say about it (I have seen none of it).",5,730 Days Left,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,6026,"['Season', 'III', 'Sept.', '6', '2005', 'must', 'say',
