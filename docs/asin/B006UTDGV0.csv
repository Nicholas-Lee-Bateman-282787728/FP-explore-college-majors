1520134,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B006UTDGV0,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","Haven't there been enough movies to prove that a group of college students investigating the supposed hauntings in an abandoned mental hospital with a history of violence is a terrible idea?  Yet every couple of months, another handful of them decide to check out the legends and prove or disprove them.  And every time, they all die.In this case it's John, Tess, Daniel, Brennan, Samantha and Blake, all looking to get a passing grade by going into the Odenbrook Sanitarium, a supposedly haunted hospital in which, years ago, everyone in the place committed mass suicide, and recording their findings for their group thesis project.The movie is presented as half-found footage and half not as we open with John in the hospital after his friends have been slaughtered in the hospital.  An investigator is there with him, trying to figure out if John is responsible or not, so together they watch the recovered footage.  Turns out, soon after getting to the hospital, John bailed, saying his sister had called and their grandmother needed someone to tend to her.Why did you lie, the agent asks, to which John replies, ""We just wanted to scare them.""  Because John and Tess believe in the paranormal, but the others in the group don't, so John was going to lock them in, then, late at night, make a lot of noises and scare them.  Only, John never showed up again until two days later, and by then it was much too late.Meanwhile, inside the hospital, Samantha gets mad at boyfriend Brennan and says she's leaving, then is never seen again.  The others, discovering they've been locked in, try to find a way out but find instead that their only exit is DEATH!  Tess is dragged away, Brennan is beaten to death, Daniel appears to have been hung in mid-air.  Finally, Samantha gets out, but is met by a locked gate just as John shows up.  He unlocks the gate just in time, but it's not really, because Samantha is yanked back inside, followed by John.So what happens, the investigator asks.  I saw the devil, John says, and he whispered something to me.PARANORMAL INCIDENT, written and directed by Matthew Bolton, isn't the worst of these kind of movies I've ever seen, but I wouldn't place it in the top five, either.It's not a terrible movie by any means.  The acting is decent, passable at least, and each character is given just enough backstory to feel more fleshed out than most teen ensemble movies in this category.The location is definitely creepy as hell, and the scares don't come across as cheap and clich&eacute;.  There are none of the standard cat in the window jump scares, at least.The found footage aspect is used to great effect by putting the viewer in the dark, cramped hallways and stuffy patients' rooms with the characters, which adds greatly to the mood of the film.The things that, for me, kept this movie from being really good were, first, the backstory feels unfinished.  Why did the patients all commit suicide?  What is really haunting the Odenbrook?Second, the hospital scenes with John and the investigator, while providing a very real part of the story that most of these found footage movies never tackle (usually because they end with no survivors), felt forced and silly, especially the ending which left way too many questions unanswered.  However, they didn't feel unanswered because the film was going for that vague, mysterious ending, it felt like they were things Bolton just hadn't bothered to think of answers for, not that satisfied him any more than they would have satisfied the viewer.The effects were decent enough but nothing to brag about, and in my opinion way too much of the movie was filmed with night vision.  But, really, those aren't factors that make or break the movie.  For me, it's those scenes afterward with John in the hospital, and that super weird and vague ending that feels tacked on, that keep PARANORMAL INCIDENT from being a better movie.  It's got all the requisite aspects, pretty people doing stupid things in the dark, getting drunk, college assignments, and a seedy, suspect location that no one has any right being in without some kind of supervision.  By all accounts, this should have been a no-brainer.  But, man, that ending.  Out of nowhere.  And it didn't make a lick of sense.Sorry, everyone knows that so much of what makes a great story depends on the ending, and this one didn't only get it wrong, it got it weird.  An unoriginal story with no resolution to the backstory and not even a hint of an explanation provided.  Not only is there no explanation, as is so often the case in these found footage ghost stories, but the end of this one sidesteps any sort of answer by asking even more questions.  And those questions don't even make any sense.  It was just silly and unnecessary and took me completely out of the movie and the experience.I tried to like this one, and I almost made it, but the bad choices by the writer/director kept it from reaching even mediocre status.",2,Paranormal Incident,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,4960,"['Have', ""n't"", 'there', 'been', 'enough', 'movies', 'prove', 'group', 'college', 'students',

The scariest part of this movie, is when theyre walking in and see a snake. The ending makes no sense whats so ever. It was as if they writer ran out of material. So he just pulled something out of his A*s. And if you had any doubt about it being a rip off of Paranormal Activity. They say the phrase ""Paranormal Activity"" ateast 5 times within the first 15mins. Look elsewhere.

Some clips on the early part of the film is a waste and pretty much does not have any significance to it other than a filler. The reason of the 3 star rating is due to the middle of the film where you will really get some chills. SPOILER ALERT!!! While they were looking for  a way out, it was freaking morning and bright, they did not even notice that the air conditioner in the window can be removed or dismantled. Only if they did not show that air conditioner unit then it would have made more sense.You'll pretty much enjoy the film until the end. The ending is jaw dropping. You'll forget that you have been watching a ""horror"" themed movie. The ending to me was like ""Say what?!?!?"". It was good until it became government experiment conspiracy kind of thing.An OK movie if you don't have anything to watch like I did. Amazon does not have a 2.5 stars so I chose 3 stars. My rating for this movie is really between ""I DON'T LIKE IT"" AND ""IT'S OK"".The Good: No background music much and even without that bgm in the background, it delivered a chill at some point.The Bad: The ending!
