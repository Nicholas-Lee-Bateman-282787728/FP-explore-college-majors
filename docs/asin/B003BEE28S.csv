However, this episode was absurd.Did you know that OJ Simpson was involved in a police chase on a Los Angeles highway while sitting in the back seat of white Ford Bronco?  You did?  Good.  Now, you don't need to buy this disk or watch this show--because that is as in-depth as you are going to get to the story behind this episode.The filmmaker has nothing to say--and does just that.  He says nothing.  In fact, nobody says anything.  It's just edited footage of the day with no commentary or analysis at all.  It is as enlightening as a commercial.There is much that could have been done with this idea--if only a competant filmmaker had been employed.",1,Absolutely awful,1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,777,"['30', '30', 'series', 'ESPN', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'have', 'been', 'couple', 'felt', 'were', 'not', 'too', 'strong', 'However', 'episode', 'was', 'absurd.Did', 'know', 'OJ', 'Simpson', 'was', 'involved', 'police', 'chase', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'highway', 'sitting', 'back', 'seat', 'white', 'Ford', 'Bronco', 'did', 'Good', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'buy', 'disk', 'watch', 'show', 'as', 'in-depth', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'story', 'episode.The', 'filmmaker', 'nothing', 'say', 'just', 'nothing', 'fact', 'nobody', 'anything', 'just', 'edited', 'footage', 'day', 'commentary', 'analysis', 'as', 'enlightening', 'commercial.There', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'idea', 'only', 'competant', 'filmmaker', 'had', 'been', 'employed']",N/A

Brett did an incredible job summarizing the day's events, from golf to World Cup soccer to NBA Finals basketball to baseball; then, super-imposing the OJ Simpson drama as it unfolded that day. A really incredible re-creation and dramatic summary of that day in history. Well done, and I recommend it.",4,Reality TV,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,391,"['remember', 'day', 'well', 'ESPN', 're-created', 'sports', 'drama', 'day', 'extremely', 'well', 'Brett', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'summarizing', 'day', 'events', 'golf', 'World', 'Cup', 'soccer', 'NBA', 'Finals', 'basketball', 'baseball', 'then', 'super-imposing', 'OJ', 'Simpson', 'drama', 'unfolded', 'day', 'really', 'incredible', 're-creation', 'dramatic', 'summary', 'day', 'history', 'Well', 'done', 'recommend']",N/A

A day in which almost all the major sports clashed and came together to create a memorable day in history.  One reviewer stated there were no interviews or voiceovers and there are not.  The documentary is from the point of view of a television viewer.  There are broadcasted bites and behind the scene bites and audio bites.  It all comes together to show the chaotic day that was June 17, 1994.On a personal note, my daughter was 17 days old.  And I remember sitting on the couch with her in New Jersey watching the New York Rangers parade on a local channel, ABC 7, and also the insanity that was the OJ Simpson Bronco chase.This documentary is a glorious look at the world of sports on a specific day in history.",5,Excellent Documentary,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,787,"['excellent', 'documentary', 'showing', 'one', 'day', 'sports', 'world', 'day', 'almost', 'major', 'sports', 'clashed', 'came', 'together', 'create', 'memorable', 'day', 'history', 'One', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'were', 'interviews', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'not', 'documentary', 'point', 'view', 'television', 'viewer', 'are', 'broadcasted', 'bites', 'scene', 'bites', 'audio', 'bites', 'together', 'show', 'chaotic', 'day', 'was', 'June', '17', '1994.On', 'personal', 'note', 'daughter', 'was', '17', 'days', 'old', 'remember', 'sitting', 'couch', 'New', 'Jersey', 'watching', 'New', 'York', 'Rangers', 'parade', 'local', 'channel', 'ABC', '7', 'also', 'insanity', 'was', 'OJ', 'Simpson', 'Bronco', 'chase.This', 'documentary', 'glorious', 'look', 'world', 'sports', 'specific', 'day', 'history']",N/A

Lots of things were going on that day - Game 5 of the NBA finals New York Knicks vs the Houston Rockets (Ewing vs Olajuwon - a rivalry started in college), Arnold Palmer's last tournament, the NY Rangers NHL championship, and the World Cup finals - Brazil vs Italy. Of course it was also the day of OJ Simpsons slow ride in his Ford Bronco. I remember the Rockets game being shown in a split screen or small box while reporters breathlessly nattered on about the OJ Simpson situation. Even the great Bob Costas joined in. As a Rockets fan I was quite annoyed at the time. There is a great game going on in the background.Interestingly in the wrap up the film's director goes on to point out that the Knicks lost their 3-2 edge and were not NBA Champions. Plus unintentionally humorous excerpts with losing coach Pat Riley. The typical pattern in such matters - usually one reports on who won, not who lost. Of course another typical pattern is that NY will get it's due in these media matters. Ha. Tha Houston Rockets! Akeeeeeeeeeeem! Take that Knicks. I hope you never win another one.",4,Pretty good - makes the point that the media is a lot of chattering yahoos,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,1127,"['June', '17th', '1994', 'decent', 'documentary', 'Lots', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'day', 'Game', '5', 'NBA', 'finals', 'New', 'York', 'Knicks', 'vs', 'Houston', 'Rockets', 'Ewing', 'vs', 'Olajuwon', 'rivalry', 'started', 'college', 'Arnold', 'Palmer', 'last', 'tournament', 'NY', 'Rangers', 'NHL', 'championship', 'World', 'Cup', 'finals', 'Brazil', 'vs', 'Italy', 'course', 'was', 'also', 'day', 'OJ', 'Simpsons', 'slow', 'ride', 'Ford', 'Bronco', 'remember', 'Rockets', 'game', 'being', 'shown', 'split', 'screen', 'small', 'box', 'reporters', 'breathlessly', 'nattered', 'OJ', 'Simpson', 'situation', 'Even', 'great', 'Bob', 'Costas', 'joined', 'Rockets', 'fan', 'was', 'quite', 'annoyed', 'time', 'great', 'game', 'going', 'background.Interestingly', 'wrap', 'up', 'film', 'director', 'point', 'out', 'Knicks', 'lost', '3-2', 'edge', 'were', 'not', 'NBA', 'Champions', 'unintentionally', 'humorous', 'excerpts', 'losing', 'coach', 'Pat', 'Riley', 'typical', 'pattern', 'such', 'matters', 'usually', 'one', 'reports', 'who', 'won', 'not', 'who', 'lost', 'course', 'typical', 'pattern', 'NY', 'will', 'get', 'due', 'media', 'matters', 'Ha', 'Tha', 'Houston', 'Rockets', 'Akeeeeeeeeeeem', 'Take', 'Knicks', 'hope', 'never', 'win', 'one']",N/A
