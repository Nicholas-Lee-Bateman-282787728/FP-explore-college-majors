While it tries vainly to be a Tennesee Williams type melodrama of secrets and forbidden love it really is just a showcase of bad acting and even worse storytelling. The husband's a closet case mope, the wife's a dim bulbed dope and the cowboy has the worst fake Southern accent outside of high school productions of ""Steel Magnolias"".  Scenes that are supposed to be high drama elicited laughs from the audience and if you can't see the ""surprise"" ending from a mile away, maybe it's just best that you lay off of movies for a while.

But I disagree about the acting... much better than in Brokeback Mountain, folks. If you gave it a chance, the performance by James Michael Bobby was nuanced, sensitive, sweet and vulnerable. He has... unfortunately... gone off the radar because of relentlessly negative reviews like the ones we've seen here. The reviewers don't in any way strike me as experts or cognoscenti [look it up]. They sound like the typical type of person who has failed and wants to blame their shipwreck on everyone else. If anyone knows how to locate Mr. Bobby, please put that in a review.

Nance,"[10, 10]","Let's say, hypothetically, you're sitting around with a bunch of your friends and all of you decide that you're going to purposefully make the absolute worst movie ever.  You would probably start with a weak opener like some married guy drives a sedan out into the desert to pick up a hooker with a heart of gold and then decides to drive said hooker back to his house and move the hooker into the guest room.  You would probably drop some gem of dialogue early in the movie to keep the audience guessing for about three seconds as to what the predictable plot twist is going to be.  Just for good measure you would probably use incredibly tired camera tricks like soft focus to let the audience know a character is good at heart but misunderstood or blue lighting to let the audience know there's a dream sequence featuring a flowy white dress or a gratuitous butt shot complete with a half profile of a guy looking over his shoulder in the moonlight all but saying ""come hither"".  You and your friends might also decide to have every character cry and embrace at the drop of a hat.  And finally, just to make sure your audience is completely disappointed, you'd make sure the cast doesn't even offer a decent contribution for the spank bank.  The movie that you and your friends would create would still be an Oscar winner compared to Cowboy Junction.I put the movie in and started watching it.  Within the first minute there's an awkwardly staged fight in the desert between all the rent boys that are waiting for johns on a dirt road (not quite sure how that was supposed to work).  I nearly stopped the movie there, but decided to give it five more minutes.  During that five minutes, a john magically shows, picks up one of the guys, somehow manages to engage in a sexual act (I'm not sure which one), embraces the boy during his emotional breakdown, and drives the boy back to his home and casually introduces him to his wife as the new ""handyman"".I just kept sitting there watching as the horrible-ness continued unfolding and promising myself I would only watch five more minutes.  Just when I thought ""this is as bad as it's going to get"", it would get worse.  I couldn't turn it off.  The whole time I was thinking, ""Surely, they meant for it to be this bad because there's no way they could have done this much wrong on accident.""I wish everyone in the world would watch the movie because I don't think you can fully appreciate how bad it is just by reading a review.  You need to experience it for yourself.My only reason for giving it three stars is I wish the distributors would rename the movie ""Cowboy Junction: The worst gay movie ever"" and market it as a parody of gay romance movies.",3,I wish everyone would watch it so we could all talk about how bad it is,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,2703,"['Let', 'say', 'hypothetically', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'around', 'bunch', 'friends', 'decide', ""'re"", 'going', 'purposefully', 'make', 'absolute', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'would', 'probably', 'start', 'weak', 'opener', 'married', 'guy', 'sedan', 'out', 'desert', 'pick', 'up', 'hooker', 'heart', 'gold', 'then', 'drive', 'said', 'hooker', 'back', 'house', 'move', 'hooker', 'guest', 'room', 'would', 'probably', 'drop', 'gem', 'dialogue', 'early', 'movie', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'three', 'seconds', 'what', 'predictable', 'plot', 'twist', 'going', 'be', 'Just', 'good', 'measure', 'would', 'probably', 'use', 'incredibly', 'tired', 'camera', 'tricks', 'soft', 'focus', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'character', 'good', 'heart', 'misunderstood', 'blue', 'lighting', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'dream', 'sequence', 'featuring', 'flowy', 'white', 'dress', 'gratuitous', 'butt', 'shot', 'complete', 'half', 'profile', 'guy', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'moonlight', 'saying', 'come', 'hither', 'friends', 'might', 'also', 'decide', 'have', 'character', 'cry', 'embrace', 'drop', 'hat', 'finally', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'audience', 'completely', 'disappointed', ""'d"", 'make', 'sure', 'cast', ""n't"", 'even', 'offer', 'decent', 'contribution', 'spank', 'bank', 'movie', 'friends', 'would', 'create', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'compared', 'Cowboy', 'Junction.I', 'put', 'movie', 'started', 'watching', 'first', 'minute', 'awkwardly', 'staged', 'fight', 'desert', 'rent', 'are', 'waiting', 'johns', 'dirt', 'road', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'was', 'supposed', 'work', 'nearly', 'stopped', 'movie', 'there', 'decided', 'give', 'five', 'more', 'minutes', 'five', 'minutes', 'john', 'magically', 'up', 'one', 'guys', 'somehow', 'engage', 'sexual', 'act', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'boy', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'boy', 'back', 'home', 'casually', 'wife', 'new', 'handyman', '.I', 'just', 'kept', 'sitting', 'there', 'watching', 'horrible-ness', 'continued', 'unfolding', 'promising', 'would', 'only', 'watch', 'five', 'more', 'minutes', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'as', 'bad', 'going', 'get', 'would', 'get', 'worse', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'thinking', 'Surely', 'meant', 'be', 'bad', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'wrong', 'accident', 'wish', 'everyone', 'world', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'how', 'bad', 'just', 'reading', 'review', 'need', 'experience', 'yourself.My', 'only', 'reason', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'wish', 'distributors', 'would', 'rename', 'movie', 'Cowboy', 'Junction', 'worst', 'gay', 'movie', 'ever', 'market', 'parody', 'gay', 'romance', 'movies']",Cowboy Junction
