Our rivers and lakes would empty of life as we know it, these eating machines would devour anything edible.  Eventually they would most likely destroy their food sources, and starve to death..  Unless they allowed the native species time to regenerate themselves, they would not survive.  Human beings would stand little chance against these monsters.  It is definitely a good thing that these monsters were rendered extinct, they could not co-exist with the species living today.

689417,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,B00005Y71O,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[3, 12]","For me, the appeal of a video on humungous crocodiles would be to actually see them in their glory, in their environment, in action.  The producers of this video chose not to travel back in time a few hundred million years with their cameras.  Perhaps that trip would have strained their budget.  Well excuuuuuse me.Since they took the lazy way out, and simply followed some present day archaeologists and croc-workers, the least they could have done was to offer us a mega-million dollar computer recreation of these supercrocs in action in their native environment.  But nooooooo.What we're left with is just those archaelogists and crocologists, and a clay sculpture of a supercroc that doesn't even eat people.  Where's the fun in that?  They could have at least had the clay croc with moveable jaws and have it eat a few of the extras.So we see some regular guys in the Sahara chipping away at bones in the sand and wimpily complaining about a little heat.  So it's 120 degrees out.  Big deal.  I can't feel it.  Bunch of gurly men.Then they ride crocodiles.  So they can measure their heads and bodies.  So they can determine the mathematical ratio between a croc's head and its body.  So they can estimate the body length of the supercroc whose skull they have found.  But mostly, so they can have the fun of riding crocodiles, and have something interesting to put on the video.  Yee hah!  Giddyup croc.Here are some of the interesting facts I learned from this video.  If you call a croc by its name it will come to you and beg for food like a cat.  Not that any cat or dog I ever had ever knew its name and responded to it.  I didn't own my pets.  They owned me.  Who was doing all the work?  Who was supplying the food?  Who was lazing around the house all day?  Think about it.  Just who is working for who?At one point, a guy stuck his arm into the mouth of a sedated croc, all the way in, and right to its stomach, and we get to see the inside of the croc.  It had a lot of worms in it.  Makes me wonder about you.  Do you have worms inside you as well?  I think you do.Why did he do that?  To recover a little machine he planted inside that very croc previously.  And what did he learn from that informative experiment?  I donno.  He didn't say.  What I learned from it is that I probably have worms in me.  Not as big as the worms in you though.I think I know why they didn't go back in time hundreds of millions of years to show Supercroc eating dinosaurs by the seashore.  It is because it is all just a question of scale.  What's the difference between a supercroc eating a dinosaur and a regular modern croc eating your high school math teacher?  Not a lot.  It's just a question of scale.

If this were not a National Geographic documentary, I'd still believe it was.Details about the Supercroc are amazing and its ability to eat dinosaurs fully believable. Sadly, there were too few details about the 40-foot long crocodile; instead, the viwer is given a documentary that seems to spend about 90% of its time in praise of the amazing abilities of the people involved in the fact-finding required to link the supercroc to today's remaining species of crocodile. All could have been covered by a few lines of commentary explaining that there was detailed research on the likely similarities of size (and predetory instincts) of present-day breeds of crocodile and the supercroc: however, that was not the case; so be it! But, to collect the required comparative data, the crocodile-hunting scenes seemed so lacking in safety for the people involved that I remain somewhat discomforted about why National Geographic endorsed such amateur displays (including one crocodile hunter stepping on the nose of a crocodile and looking very fortunate indeed not to have become a crocodile meal!).Praise is certainly due to the amazing sculpting of what the supercroc would have looked like in comparison to mere human beings but, overall, too much time was spent on looking at the self-glorification of the presenters rather than the awesome glory of the supercroc.",3,Too close to Spoof for comfort,1018656000,"04 13, 2002",2002,1441,"['first', 'few', 'minutes', 'give', 'impression', 'documentary', 'being', 'spoof', 'were', 'not', 'National', 'Geographic', 'documentary', ""'d"", 'still', 'believe', 'Supercroc', 'are', 'amazing', 'ability', 'eat', 'dinosaurs', 'fully', 'believable', 'Sadly', 'were', 'too', 'few', 'details', '40-foot', 'long', 'crocodile', 'instead', 'viwer', 'given', 'documentary', 'spend', 'about', '90', '%', 'time', 'praise', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'people', 'involved', 'fact-finding', 'required', 'link', 'supercroc', 'today', 'remaining', 'species', 'crocodile', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'few', 'lines', 'commentary', 'explaining', 'was', 'detailed', 'research', 'likely', 'similarities', 'size', 'predetory', 'instincts', 'present-day', 'breeds', 'crocodile', 'supercroc', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'so', 'be', 'collect', 'required', 'comparative', 'data', 'crocodile-hunting', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'so', 'lacking', 'safety', 'people', 'involved', 'remain', 'somewhat', 'discomforted', 'why', 'National', 'Geographic', 'endorsed', 'such', 'amateur', 'displays', 'including', 'one', 'crocodile', 'hunter', 'stepping', 'nose', 'crocodile', 'looking', 'very', 'fortunate', 'indeed', 'not', 'have', 'become', 'crocodile', 'meal', '.Praise', 'certainly', 'due', 'amazing', 'sculpting', 'what', 'supercroc', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'comparison', 'mere', 'human', 'beings', 'overall', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'looking', 'self-glorification', 'presenters', 'rather', 'awesome', 'glory', 'supercroc']",National Geographic - SuperCroc
