Both creepy and cute, arousing yet ridiculous, Inu X Boku SS is not a series for everyone.This DVD collection offers all 12 episodes from the series along with another ""episode"" that appears to be three shorts that I had never seen before.  The shorts do require that you see the series to fully understand but no one in the client-agent class of residents from this apartment complex is left out.  These shorts also touch upon later issues of the first manga series.Personally I found the English voice actors to be good but there were a few awkward moments when they spoke over each other and a voice seemed out of place; that's an issue for the English version director.  The subtitled version does not seem to have these issues.A very unusual romance with absurdity and a touch of kink makes this not for children but perhaps also not for every adult.
