The series has two of the most charming leads in a funny and tender love story, with a terrific supporting cast; great writing, direction and musical score, And unlike too many series with rushed endings, this one has a concluding episode that pulls everything together and satisfies the soul.

1618248,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00AX8U3KG,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","ROOFTOP PRINCE should be considered as one of a trio of Korean time travel movies with Dr. Jin and THE GREAT DOCTOR as the other two. All three are entertaining accounts of time travel between modern day Korea and the Korea of the Joseon age. ROOFTOP PRINCE begins as a tragedy with the murder of the Crown Princess of 300 years ago. The Crown Prince swears revenge on the unknown perpetrators and chooses three retainers to help him solve the crime. All three are subject to assassination and while escaping by leaping on horseback over a cliff, somehow are propelled into the future by landing on the rooftop of a building whose apartment is occupied by the reincarnation of his previous life's sister-in-law. The prince also meets the reincarnation of his princess who has no memory of their past life together. Though ROOFTOP PRINCE begins in tragedy, it soon enough morphs in a comic fish out of water tale. The prince and his trio of time traveling companions ooh and ahh their way through what to them is a magical mystery tour of computers, cell phones, traffic jams, and pizza. Along the way the plot alternates between the hilarity of adjusting to a colossal change in their lives to the serious business of overcoming the machinations of corporate baddies all the while trying to solve a three centuries old crime. Love is in the air as the prince finds himself falling for his former sister-in-law even as he discovers that his reincarnated wife is just the same bitchy backstabber that she always was but he did not know that until late in the film. The director wisely avoids the inevitable paradoxes of monkeying with the past to alter the present though the ending seems to suggest that True Love must triumph despite formidable odds. The trio who portray the retainers are distinctive in their own right and they have no problem learning the complexities of laptops and cell phones. The crown prince must learn that in the 21th century he simply cannot make things happen by issuing orders. The crown princess is a caricature of opportunism. The updated ex-sister-in-law is sweet but tough-minded. We in the audience do not care about the cavernous logical flubs because we have learned to care about their respective fates. Even the villains are more than one-dimensional cutouts. Thus, when we come to the end of the 20 episode series, we ponder the reality of unreality even after the credits have finished their run. A truly amazing film.",5,Comic Greatness With Tragic Undertones,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2459,"['ROOFTOP', 'PRINCE', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'trio', 'Korean', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'Dr.', 'Jin', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'DOCTOR', 'other', 'two', 'three', 'are', 'entertaining', 'accounts', 'time', 'travel', 'modern', 'day', 'Korea', 'Korea', 'Joseon', 'age', 'ROOFTOP', 'PRINCE', 'tragedy', 'murder', 'Crown', 'Princess', '300', 'years', 'ago', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'swears', 'revenge', 'unknown', 'perpetrators', 'chooses', 'three', 'retainers', 'help', 'solve', 'crime', 'three', 'are', 'subject', 'assassination', 'escaping', 'leaping', 'horseback', 'cliff', 'somehow', 'are', 'propelled', 'future', 'landing', 'rooftop', 'building', 'apartment', 'occupied', 'reincarnation', 'previous', 'life', 'sister-in-law', 'prince', 'also', 'reincarnation', 'princess', 'who', 'memory', 'past', 'life', 'together', 'ROOFTOP', 'PRINCE', 'tragedy', 'soon', 'enough', 'morphs', 'comic', 'fish', 'water', 'tale', 'prince', 'trio', 'time', 'traveling', 'companions', 'ooh', 'ahh', 'way', 'what', 'magical', 'mystery', 'tour', 'computers', 'cell', 'phones', 'traffic', 'jams', 'pizza', 'way', 'plot', 'hilarity', 'adjusting', 'colossal', 'change', 'lives', 'serious', 'business', 'overcoming', 'machinations', 'corporate', 'baddies', 'while', 'trying', 'solve', 'three', 'centuries', 'old', 'crime', 'Love', 'air', 'prince', 'falling', 'former', 'sister-in-law', 'even', 'reincarnated', 'wife', 'just', 'same', 'bitchy', 'backstabber', 'always', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'late', 'film', 'director', 'wisely', 'inevitable', 'paradoxes', 'monkeying', 'past', 'alter', 'present', 'ending', 'suggest', 'True', 'Love', 'must', 'triumph', 'formidable', 'odds', 'trio', 'who', 'retainers', 'are', 'distinctive', 'own', 'right', 'have', 'problem', 'learning', 'complexities', 'laptops', 'cell', 'phones', 'crown', 'prince', 'must', 'learn', '21th', 'century', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'things', 'happen', 'issuing', 'orders', 'crown', 'princess', 'caricature', 'opportunism', 'updated', 'ex-sister-in-law', 'sweet', 'tough-minded', 'audience', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'cavernous', 'logical', 'flubs', 'have', 'learned', 'care', 'respective', 'fates', 'Even', 'villains', 'are', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'cutouts', 'Thus', 'when', 'come', 'end', '20', 'episode', 'series', 'ponder', 'reality', 'unreality', 'even', 'credits', 'have', 'finished', 'run', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film']",Rooftop Prince Korean Drama DVD with English Subtitle (Ntsc All Region)
