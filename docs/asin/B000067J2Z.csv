I usually love giant animals on the attack movies, even fake looking ones but this is at the bottom of the barrel. When I got this I figured the Octopus is smaller than its giant counterpart so I was hoping for some really gruesome kills but instead I got ridiculously long attacks where the characters survive and all it is, is the rubber tentacles wrapping around them. I don't sense any pain or fear. This octopus just pops up from nowhere and attacks and usually fails. What made this even more stupid is the crappy acting and the focus on the Police characters, it hardly has anything to do with the less threatening Octopus. Boring and crappy, avoid it at all cost. Trust me I'm a person who likes Cemetery Gates so believe me, this is horrible",1,"Boring, Boring and more Boring!!!",1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,828,"['What', 'were', 'thinking', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'original', 'create', 'crap', 'usually', 'love', 'giant', 'animals', 'attack', 'movies', 'even', 'fake', 'looking', 'ones', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'When', 'got', 'figured', 'Octopus', 'smaller', 'giant', 'counterpart', 'was', 'hoping', 'really', 'gruesome', 'kills', 'instead', 'got', 'ridiculously', 'long', 'attacks', 'where', 'characters', 'survive', 'rubber', 'wrapping', 'do', ""n't"", 'sense', 'pain', 'fear', 'octopus', 'just', 'up', 'nowhere', 'attacks', 'usually', 'What', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'stupid', 'crappy', 'acting', 'focus', 'Police', 'characters', 'hardly', 'anything', 'do', 'less', 'threatening', 'Octopus', 'Boring', 'crappy', 'avoid', 'cost', 'Trust', ""'m"", 'person', 'who', 'Cemetery', 'Gates', 'believe', 'horrible']",Octopus 2: River of Fear
703319,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B000067J2Z,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","I've always thought the most important part of horror was in finding some way to relate to the audience. You have to make the horror seem plausible in their own daily lives. That way, you can more easily take them on the journey with you, because they relate to that situation. THEN you smack them in the face with the horror. And let's face it, how many of us are ever going to find ourselves in a submarine in the middle of the ocean? So when the makers of the original OCTOPUS went about crafting their sequel, they took the most logical step in insuring this time audiences would quake in fear at the terror wrought by the giant octopus: they brought the monster to us.OCTOPUS 2: River of Fear finds New York's Harbor Patrol investigating the murder of two tourists. Clues lead our officers, Nick and Walter (Michael Reilly Burke, THE COLLECTOR, and Fredric Lehne, ""Lost""), to a community of homeless living underground where the leader, Mad Dog, says he saw what killed those people and it wasn't human. It was an octopus.Walter, the soon-to-be-transferred uptown lead on the case doesn't want to hear about killer Octopi in his town, but Nick, the cop with the hunches, thinks there might be something to this story. So one night Nick and Walter are on patrol when Walter has to go into the water in search of a missing man. He's attacked and killed by the octopus, despite Nick's every effort to save his partner, but when Nick tries to convince the Captain the octopus is real, he's taken off the case.Enter Rachel Starbird (Meredith Morton, ALIEN FURY: Countdown to Invasion), assistant to the mayor, and the only person in town who'll give Nick the time of day. She's also the story's love interest, in case you couldn't tell. Nick takes Rachel underground in search of the giant octopus, and the two narrowly escape its clutches, but when they go back to the Captain and then try to convince the mayor to cancel the upcoming Fourth of July celebration, they're told to go get bent. Instead, Nick and his team decide to go into the water and take out this beast before it can do any more harm.Unfortunately, it does more harm anyway and, even though Nick is able to dispatch the rampaging creature, he's then left with a 20-minute rescue scene at the end involving Rachel and a school bus full of children trapped in one of New York's many tunnels I don't know the name of. It's all very exciting and nail biting. I could tell because there were lots of sparks flying near the water and the camera shook a lot, plus the music got really loud and Nick and Rachel kept shouting at each other to hurry up.This was not exactly what I had in mind a couple weeks ago when, reviewing the first OCTOPUS, I said maybe OCTOPUS 2 will be better. It wasn't. At all.Coming from the writers as the first OCTOPUS, the script for ""River of Fear"" is just as bad, maybe even worse, full of one tough cop line after another. In fact, if you can think of a bad clich&eacute; from any cop movie ever written, chances are it's in here.The plot is paper thin with absolutely no explanation offered as to why this octopus, which is bigger than a house, would be in the East River. They try to set up a number of conflicts and story complications, like Nick suspecting a Judge of being a drug runner--a joke that's played throughout the movie--plus the 3000+ boats that are about to fill the harbor when the fireworks start going off, but I don't think it would have mattered what level of complexity they were going for in the plot, the thing just didn't hold together at all.Maybe it's the acting. I know the effects certainly didn't help at all. Maybe it's just the idea of a giant octopus in New York harbor and only ONE PERSON, this cop whom no one believes, has seen it. I had an easier time believing Jason Vorhees had taken Manhattan than I did that this octopus was a threat. And now that the producers and writers have taken their beast to the big city, skipping half a dozen other sequel plot lines, they've already shot themselves in the foot with this franchise because the only thing left to do now is OCTOPUS 3: IN SPACE!!!Luckily, considering this mess came out 11 years ago and there's still no sign of a trilogy, maybe the world will at least be spared that particular indignity.Yossi Wein, the director of this movie, worked pretty steadily as a director from 1993 to 2003, but he's even more experienced as a cinematographer, which surprises me, because with credits like CYBORG COP II and AMERICAN NINJA 4: The Annihilation under his belt, you'd think OCTOPUS 2: River of Fear would be a sweeping panorama of intensity, full of nuance and symbolism, a veritable love letter to New York Harbor. Instead we get a finished product that's just a few dollars beyond being a made for TV movie. In fact, with a little editing, focusing on Rachel's struggles to maintain her identity as an artist in the fast-paced and giant-creature-ridden world of New York City politics, who suddenly finds love when the cop she's been hanging out with saves the city, this could have been a Lifetime movie.God help us.I don't think it's any secret now that I was very unimpressed with OCTOPUS 2: River of Fear. I had hoped for more after seeing the original, but if anything I'm even more biased AGAINST this franchise now. The idea of a giant octopus, with tentacles flailing and whatnot, is full of potential for true terror. But when the story, for lack of a better word, is as yawn-inducing as this, not to mention the overall production as shoddy, there's really nothing left to do but hang my head in shame for having subjected myself to them in the first place, and hopefully learn from this lesson and move on.",2,Octopus 2: River of Fear,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,5703,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'most',

703325,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000067J2Z,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Released in the US in January, 2002, ""Octopus 2: River of Fear"" is a sequel in name only. Whereas the original ""Octopus"" (2000) had a highly creative storyline involving terrorists, a submarine, a cruise ship and a bizarro-James Bond, ""Octopus 2"" takes the tried-and-true ""Jaws"" route. The setting here is New York City. A giant octopus decides to make the East River his home and people inevitably start dying. Two harbor patrol officers discover the cause of the deaths, but are ignored and ridiculed. The city is preparing for its biggest Independence Day celebration ever and the mayor doesn't want the officers' preposterous monster 'story' getting out and causing a mass panic.As you can see, the basic plot mimics ""Jaws (Widescreen Anniversary Collector's Edition)"" to a 'T.' Regardless, I was pretty impressed with the first half. You could tell the filmmakers and cast really put some thought and effort into making a quality Grade B creature feature, reminiscent of ""Kolchak - The Night Stalker."" Where ""Octopus 2"" takes a wrong turn is the last act, which morphs into a disaster film involving a school bus of kids and other vehicles trapped in a river tunnel. Not that it was a bad idea, especially since it gives evidence that the creators wanted to deviate from the basic ""Jaws"" plot, which I respect, but they failed to execute it. The last act seems rushed and sloppy, like the filmmakers were just trying to get the film done and over with, with almost zero effectiveness. In other words, they started with good intentions and quality vigor, but somewhere along the line they lost their focus or enthusiasm and decided to just go through the motions and collect their paychecks. It's unfortunate because the first half is a solid creature-on-the-loose flick in the manner of ""Kolchak.""For a good example of what I mean, check out the scene near the end where the monster -- thought to be dead -- rises up for another attack; this scene is so poorly presented it's hard to believe it was done by the same team that produced the first half.BOTTOM LINE: The first half is a well-done nature-runs-amok flick featuring a quality cast, particularly the two officers who investigate the killings and the mayoral worker who befriends them, but when the film attempts to morph into a disaster flick it inexplicably falls apart. Yet it's still worthwhile if you like movies along the lines of ""Kolchak.""The film runs 94 minutes.GRADE: First half: B Second half: D Overall: C",3,Well done first half falls apart in the last act,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,2481,"['Released', 'US', 'January', '2002', '2', 'River', 'Fear', 'sequel', 'name', 'only', 'original', 'Octopus', '2000', 'had', 'highly', 'creative', 'storyline', 'involving', 'terrorists', 'submarine', 'cruise', 'ship', 'bizarro-James', 'Bond', 'Octopus', '2', 'tried-and-true', 'Jaws', 'route', 'setting', 'here', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'A', 'giant', 'octopus', 'make', 'East', 'River', 'home', 'people', 'inevitably', 'start', 'dying', 'Two', 'harbor', 'patrol', 'officers', 'discover', 'cause', 'deaths', 'are', 'ignored', 'ridiculed', 'city', 'preparing', 'biggest', 'Independence', 'Day', 'celebration', 'ever', 'mayor', ""n't"", 'want', 'officers', 'preposterous', 'monster', ""'story"", 'getting', 'out', 'causing', 'mass', 'panic.As', 'can', 'see', 'basic', 'plot', 'mimics', 'Jaws', 'Widescreen', 'Anniversary', 'Collector', 'Edition', ""'T"", 'Regardless', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'first', 'half', 'could', 'tell', 'filmmakers', 'cast', 'really', 'put', 'thought', 'effort', 'making', 'quality', 'Grade', 'B', 'creature', 'feature', 'reminiscent', 'Kolchak', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'Where', 'Octopus', '2', 'wrong', 'turn', 'last', 'act', 'morphs', 'disaster', 'film', 'involving', 'school', 'bus', 'kids', 'other', 'vehicles', 'trapped', 'river', 'tunnel', 'Not', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'especially', 'evidence', 'creators', 'wanted', 'deviate', 'basic', 'Jaws', 'plot', 'respect', 'failed', 'execute', 'last', 'act', 'rushed', 'sloppy', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'film', 'done', 'almost', 'zero', 'effectiveness', 'other', 'words', 'started', 'good', 'intentions', 'quality', 'vigor', 'somewhere', 'line', 'lost', 'focus', 'enthusiasm', 'decided', 'just', 'go', 'motions', 'collect', 'paychecks', 'unfortunate', 'first', 'half', 'solid', 'creature-on-the-loose', 'flick', 'manner', 'Kolchak', 'good', 'example', 'what', 'mean', 'check', 'out', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'monster', 'thought', 'be', 'dead', 'up', 'attack', 'scene', 'so', 'poorly', 'presented', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'done', 'same', 'team', 'produced', 'first', 'half.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'first', 'half', 'well-done', 'nature-runs-amok', 'flick', 'featuring', 'quality', 'cast', 'particularly', 'two', 'officers', 'who', 'investigate', 'killings', 'mayoral', 'worker', 'who', 'when', 'film', 'attempts', 'morph', 'disaster', 'flick', 'inexplicably', 'apart', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'like', 'movies', 'lines', 'Kolchak', 'film', '94', 'minutes.GRADE', 'First', 'half', 'B', 'Second', 'half', 'D', 'Overall', 'C']",Octopus 2: River of Fear
