There is a limit to the punishingly sad story lines that can make it to film and this one clearly falls into that category.Jen (Piper Perabo) is a funky, grossly outfitted bleach blond who has returned home from Los Angles to care for her emotionally disturbed parents (Mark Dobies and Mary Beth Hurt) but she seems to outdo any manifestation of their mental abnormalities.  She is stuck in a meaningless relationship with a female animal activist (Heather Burns) and trying to stave off her ex-boyfriend (Seth Meyers) while walking among friends like Aunjanue Ellis, a druggie, Ajay Naidu, a Pakistani importer, and a cop Nick Scotti.  She is struck by a truck and becomes paralyzed and seems to want to get a grip on her life, but her 'friends' don't go along.  To say more would waste what little interest there is to glean from this tale.Those who have followed Piper Perabo's career may be hoping that this starring role may offer her the chance for a jump-start.  Sadly the script and atmosphere are so lacking that this film is probably one she will choose to not list on her resume.

It is the story of a young woman from a mentally ill family who seems either very dysfunctional or mentally ill herself. She has a few relationships with people she treats very poorly. She experiences a life-changing event and decides to value her relationships, but it appears to be too late. The movie ends in a very ungratifying, depressing way, consistent with the general tenor of the movie.The acting is poor, the plot skips all over the place, and several things make no sense at all. Worst of all, after watching it, I felt quite depressed, and I didn't beforehand.Definitely not recommended.*",1,Ker-plunk!

935320,AFUNA1LC6D5U5,B000AYELWY,Wyatt G,"[17, 17]","Wow, this movie was really really bad.  I'm a big Piper Perabo fan, thats why I made the mistake of buying this badly made, depressing film before renting.  She stars as Jen, a young woman with a bad attitude who just moved from LA back to NYC to live with her parents.  Her parents are both mentally ill and she spends most of her time tending to their needs.  Her social life is not very exciting either, she is constantly fighting off her ex boyfriend and ex girlfriend.  All of a sudden, she finds herself paralyzed after being hit by a truck.  Her bad attitude starts to change as she sees her old friends avoiding her once she is paralyzed.  She grows a heart of gold and tries to fix everything in her life, while those around her are suffering different issues, such as drug addiction and single motherhood.  With the exception of Perabo, the acting was ridiculous! No one in this film could act, especially Piper's ex girlfriend. The sequence of events were so unbelieveable and badly handled, I can't even begin to explain.  The ending is terrible as well.  This movie was actually categorized as a comedy? Thats funny, it's far from a comedy.  It is not only overly depressing, it also does not have a point.  Towards the middle of it, I thought maybe the point of it was ""believe in yourself and you can do anything"", then once it got ot the end, the point seemed more like ""all human beings are terrible, and life is not worth living"".  Thats what the ending really seemed to say.  Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this one, total waste of time.",1,Awful!
