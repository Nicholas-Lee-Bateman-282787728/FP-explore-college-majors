Even if a seller uses words like &#34;official&#34; or &#34;authentic&#34; you will still get a DVD that was burned on a computer with a lightscribe disk label and cover art that was printed on a 1997 bubble jet personal printer. The quality of the playback is fine. There are no special features or DVD menus (it just plays). For nearly $20, I'd say you really have to want this movie.With that said, DO you really want this movie? I remember enjoying it as a kid. Watching it now at 37, what was I thinking? It's not a great movie! The acting is horrible. The story is dumb, and pretty much a total downer for anyone who loved the original series. Tony was played by Wayne Rogers, who bastardized the role. The pink genie outfit was ugly and looked nothing like the original. The magic blink sound was changed to an awkward Tinkerbell chime. TJ was a total dweeb. Dr. Bellows didn't interact with anyone (he wasn't much more than a cameo). And the whole, &#34;I can't steer the space shuttle&#34; thing was just ridiculous.If you think you want to buy this one, I'd suggest watching it on YouTube first.

1610718,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B00AIA89OQ,Kasey G,"[26, 31]","Sony dusts off the first of two ""I Dream of Jeannie"" reunion movies for a MOD DVD-R release and while I love the original series, I can't say this one's worth revisiting. I should have known better since I did watch this when it aired in the fall of 1985 and all these years the only thing I remembered about it was that Jeannie's evil sister was always sporting a short spikey hairdo like Susan Clark in ""Webster"".At the time, Larry Hagman was busy with ""Dallas"" so the role of Tony Nelson went to poor Wayne Rogers (""M*A*S*H*) who has all the screen presence of a turnip here and zero chemistry with Barbara Eden. The plot has Tony about to retire from duty but when he agrees to go on another mission, Jeannie becomes furious and the two separate, she taking their pre-teen son Tony Jr. (MacKenzie Astin) with her. Her wicked sister figures largely into the plot as she constantly uses her powers to keep the two from reconciling. The most interesting thing about this travesty is seeing what ridiculous get-up Jeannie II will show up in next. **NOTE** Check the screen grabs in the Images section of this product to see all of them.When Jeannie is interviewed for ""Genie's Home Journal"" (the reporter is played by Dody Goodman), we are treated to clips from the original TV series. Also, the movie re-creates the famous opening scene from the pilot episode where Tony frees Jeannie from her bottle on the beach and she gratefully throws her arms around him rewarding him with a kiss. These things only make one want to turn this off and go back and watch the original. William Asher directed this and it should be noted that many of the stale sight gags are stolen directly from ""Bewitched"": the suitcase packing itself, levitating teapot, the party guests frozen in time and Jeannie II sitting on a lampshade.The familiar theme song morphs into a cheesy '80s synth version to stay ""current and hip"", but now seems more dated than the original. Haji has now become a flamboyant African-American gym bunny who runs a health club/aerobics studio in the movie's effort to stay oh-so-relevant to the mid-'80s.Only diehard fans of Barbara Eden should get this. It's a terrible, dull movie. If you want to see Barbara in something much more fun and entertaining, check out her 1974 thriller ""The Stranger Within"" instead.The video quality is terrific on the disc and it did play in my PC, but there are no subtitles or extras.TWO STARS.
