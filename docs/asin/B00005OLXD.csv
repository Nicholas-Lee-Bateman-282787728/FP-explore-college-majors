672655,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,B00005OLXD,csm,"[20, 21]","You can't go wrong with this video/dvd. The song &quot;Caroo, Caroo&quot; is worth the price of the dvd by itself. Hearing Morgan Crowley sing that is just incredible. It's just so very beautiful - so much so that my husband will be teaching it to his high school choir kids! I love the song &quot;And the World is One.&quot; It teaches all about Christmas over the world and the fact that it's hot in Australia during Christmas. Who knew? I sure didn't. You know, if it wasn't for the Wiggles, there would be so much more I wouldn't know. Honestly, I'm not an idiot but there's so much I never learned in school and college and I just can't believe some of the things they've introduced to very young children through their songs and videos. My child will be so much more educated that I was just from watching these guys. They are so good at what they do and really don't get on a parent's nerves. Plus, during vacation Bible school this year, my child was one of the few who knew how to get up and do the movements to the songs since he does so much with the Wiggles. He certainly wasn't shy like the rest of the children.If you're wondering what these guys are all about, this video is a great one to get. Your children will learn so many great things (nothing nasty here that you have to censor and believe me, I RESEARCH!), including self confidence, that you'll wonder what you did without them. They're comparing the Wiggles to Mr. Rogers and how much he did for kids. They're the only ones out there that are filling in the gap Mr. Rogers left according to me and Time Magazine. The original Christmas songs on this album are just beautiful and point to the real meaning of Christmas. They have fun, but they also teach the right lessons and I appreciate that. My child has been enthralled with these guys for the past year-and-a-half and there's no signs of stopping.One of the highlights of this album is &quot;the First Noel.&quot; Each Wiggle takes a verse and speaks it and it just really does something to you to hear. Kids may miss this part but wow, when Murray says his verse, he says it with such intent that it gives you goosebumps and makes you feel as if you were there at the Nativity. They use choir vocals for the chorus in between the spoken verses and that gal's voice is just amazingly beautiful! This is definitely a family favorite album and dvd - the cd is in the car most of the season! The first Christmas dvd is great too - I love that song &quot;Go, Santa Go!&quot; You know, you'll have folks wondering who's the kid in your house too once you bring these dvds into your home! They're just great!",5,Absolutely one of their Best!,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,2632,"['ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'video/dvd', 'song', 'quot', 'Caroo', 'Caroo', 'quot', 'price', 'dvd', 'Hearing', 'Morgan', 'Crowley', 'sing', 'just', 'incredible', 'just', 'so', 'very', 'beautiful', 'so', 'much', 'husband', 'will', 'be', 'teaching', 'high', 'school', 'choir', 'kids', 'love', 'song', 'quot', 'World', 'One.', 'quot', 'Christmas', 'world', 'fact', 'hot', 'Australia', 'Christmas', 'Who', 'knew', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'Wiggles', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'Honestly', ""'m"", 'not', 'idiot', 'so', 'much', 'never', 'learned', 'school', 'college', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'things', ""'ve"", 'introduced', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'songs', 'videos', 'child', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'educated', 'was', 'just', 'watching', 'guys', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'parent', 'nerves', 'vacation', 'Bible', 'school', 'year', 'child', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'up', 'do', 'movements', 'songs', 'so', 'much', 'Wiggles', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'shy', 'rest', 'children.If', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'what', 'guys', 'are', 'video', 'great', 'one', 'get', 'children', 'will', 'learn', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'things', 'nothing', 'nasty', 'here', 'have', 'censor', 'believe', 'RESEARCH', 'including', 'confidence', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'what', 'did', ""'re"", 'comparing', 'Wiggles', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'how', 'much', 'did', 'kids', ""'re"", 'only', 'ones', 'there', 'are', 'filling', 'gap', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'left', 'according', 'Time', 'Magazine', 'original', 'Christmas', 'songs', 'album', 'are', 'just', 'beautiful', 'point', 'real', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'have', 'fun', 'also', 'teach', 'right', 'lessons', 'appreciate', 'child', 'been', 'enthralled', 'guys', 'past', 'year-and-a-half', 'signs', 'stopping.One', 'highlights', 'album', 'quot', 'First', 'Noel.', 'quot', 'Wiggle', 'verse', 'speaks', 'just', 'really', 'something', 'hear', 'Kids', 'may', 'miss', 'part', 'wow', 'when', 'Murray', 'verse', 'such', 'intent', 'goosebumps', 'feel', 'were', 'there', 'Nativity', 'use', 'choir', 'vocals', 'chorus', 'spoken', 'verses', 'gal', 'voice', 'just', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'definitely', 'family', 'favorite', 'album', 'dvd', 'cd', 'car', 'most', 'season', 'first', 'Christmas', 'dvd', 'great', 'too', 'love', 'song', 'quot', 'Go', 'Santa', 'Go', 'quot', 'know', ""'ll"", 'have', 'folks', 'wondering', 'who', 'kid', 'house', 'too', 'once', 'bring', 'dvds', 'home', ""'re"", 'just', 'great']",The Wiggles - Yule Be Wiggling VHS
672656,A36PUHGHPB9EJP,B00005OLXD,Dudley Dooright,"[0, 0]","Seeking some variety in my 22-month-old daughter's Wiggles repertoire, I recently pulled this tape out of the closet even though it's the beginning of Spring.  I'm glad I did, because I'd forgotten how good it is.Like the best Wiggles videos, of which this is one, the strength of the songs and their delivery is consistent throughout.  There's enough variety to keep things interesting--such as the inclusion of the animated ""Jimmy the Elf""--but it manages to capture a mood at the same time.  A slightly glitzy, wacky, commercialized mood, yes, but this is The Wiggles we're talking about after all.Having a large collection of Wiggles videos in our home, I judge them from an adult standpoint on the ""Does it stick in my head afterwards"" measure.  And this collection passes the test with flying colors.  Hours after it ends, I find myself humming such songs as ""Just Can't Wait For Christmas Day,"" ""Doing A Dance,"" and most notably, ""Decorate the Tree,"" which stands right up there with ""Captain's Magic Buttons"" in terms of goofy Captain Feathersword fun.There are somber moments in the tape, too, giving the tape a good mix of Christmas fun and spirit.  If your home is like mine, you'll welcome this tape as one of the enjoyable parts of the season--regardless of what season it is.  In heavy rotation at the moment, I'm not even sure at this point if my daughter will let me put it away before Christmastime.  And I really wouldn't mind if she didn't.",5,One of the best Wiggles videos--even when it's not Christmas,1050624000,"04 18, 2003",2003,1459,"['Seeking', 'variety', '22-month-old', 'daughter', 'Wiggles', 'repertoire', 'recently', 'pulled', 'tape', 'closet', 'even', 'beginning', 'Spring', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'how', 'good', 'best', 'Wiggles', 'videos', 'one', 'strength', 'songs', 'delivery', 'consistent', 'enough', 'variety', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'such', 'inclusion', 'animated', 'Jimmy', 'Elf', 'capture', 'mood', 'same', 'time', 'slightly', 'glitzy', 'wacky', 'commercialized', 'mood', 'yes', 'Wiggles', ""'re"", 'talking', 'all.Having', 'large', 'collection', 'Wiggles', 'videos', 'home', 'judge', 'adult', 'standpoint', 'stick', 'head', 'afterwards', 'measure', 'collection', 'test', 'flying', 'colors', 'Hours', 'find', 'humming', 'such', 'songs', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Wait', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'Doing', 'Dance', 'most', 'notably', 'Decorate', 'Tree', 'right', 'there', 'Captain', 'Magic', 'Buttons', 'terms', 'goofy', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'are', 'somber', 'moments', 'tape', 'too', 'giving', 'tape', 'good', 'mix', 'Christmas', 'fun', 'spirit', 'home', 'mine', ""'ll"", 'welcome', 'tape', 'one', 'enjoyable', 'parts', 'season', 'regardless', 'what', 'season', 'heavy', 'rotation', 'moment', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'point', 'daughter', 'will', 'let', 'put', 'away', 'Christmastime', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'did', ""n't""]",The Wiggles - Yule Be Wiggling VHS

In fact Yule Be Wiggling was released on the same date in Australia, so it is fresh out of the press. I own all The Wiggles videos, including their other Christmas one, and this one is exceptionally good! It includes a 3D graphic world as in Toot Toot and Wiggly Playtime. The songs are all very good, all new, and well choreographed. The dances are really fun and festive, perfect for Christmas time or anytime really. My only complaint is in their more professional polished look, they left out most of the familiar smaller children we have seen in all their other videos, in favor of older dancers. It would be nice to see those kids years later and growing up. My baby is 14-month's-old now and has adored anything by The Wiggles since she was 2-month's-old. She took to this new one right off the bat. Of all The Wiggles videos the other Christmas one and Wake-up Jeff are my babies favorites, now we add Yule Be Wiggling to the list. A terrific magical holiday experience for the entire family! Fun, cute, catchy songs, wonderful dancing, and a 3D modeled environment that is very eye chatchy to watch!
