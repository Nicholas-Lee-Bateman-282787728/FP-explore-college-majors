1096398,A3EGYOY3419OZ5,B000UUX2R8,"Ezenwa Anyanwu ""The Prodigy""","[6, 7]","Captain N and the New Super Mario World is the best way to round off any possible collection for video game cartooning.  First, these two shows were far apart. Then, they were back-to-back with new seasons.  Now, they are side by side with their very own 30 minute show.  It's the last 7 eps of Captain N: The game master and 13 episodes showcasing the adventure in Super Mario World.  What I really like about this set is the ability to...wait for it....watch the episodes completely separate of each other.  You can watch both, or just Captain N or Mario World episodes.  Alas, there aren't many menu choices as their predecessors, but, the collection itself is more than enough to satiate your appetite.

I did accused the animators and their projects sexist because Princess Peach is disfigured in the entire series and i took this project as ""The series would be more kid-friendly if women characters were uglier"" and I thought that's cold. Now I know how the Afican-Americans felt when ""Coonskin"" came out in 1975 and I thought that movie was described ""dark and cold"". Last night, I've read a deal on a webpage about this show and I've now realized that ""The quality of the animation and writings suffered due to low budget"" and I thought that's really sad. This show would be a must for those that can handle bad quality.

The cartoon falls in the same category as the super show or the Zelda cartoon, where it can be perceived as being so bad it's good. Peach is not at her best in this one. I like that she has the red hair, but something about the way she is drawn makes her not very attractive.Captain N was really a bonus for me, although I find the show terrible no matter how you look at it.
