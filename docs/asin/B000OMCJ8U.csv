1064763,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B000OMCJ8U,Elisabeth,"[10, 10]","If you're new to the raw diet, this DVD is a great place to start as it is very thorough.  There's instructions of knife technique (from very basic slicing to more complicated slicing), on equipment to buy (what size, which brand), as well as many recipes to try (you can quickly select recipes to try from the main menu and the exact recipes are in the booklet included with the DVD).  The recipes Jennifer Cornbleet demonstrates how to make are:Breakfast-- fruit smooothie-- green juice-- granola with almond milkLunch-- garden soup-- pate served with crudites-- tomato stacks with pesto sauce-- sushiDinner-- ranch dressing for salad-- Mediterranean kale-- zucchini pastaDessert-- chocolate mousse tartThese recipes are enough to get the beginner started and they don't require any exotic, hard-to-find ingredients either.  The only ingredients you might have trouble finding are agave nectar and raw cacao powder.These recipes also don't require a dehydrator.  The only equipment you need for the majority of these recipes are either a blender or a food processor.  The green juice requires a juicer and the zucchini pasta requires a spiral slicer (but you can use a veggie peeler if you don't have a spiral slicer).While she's preparing the dishes, Cornbleet explains exactly what she's doing in a friendly and clear voice, which is a bonus.  Another bonus is at the end of the DVD, she tells you which supplies to pack when you're travelling so you won't be forced to abandon this diet when you're away from home.Highly recommended for the beginner.",5,Very thorough,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,1555,"[""'re"", 'new', 'raw', 'diet', 'DVD', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'very', 'thorough', 'instructions', 'knife', 'technique', 'very', 'basic', 'slicing', 'more', 'complicated', 'slicing', 'equipment', 'buy', 'what', 'size', 'brand', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'recipes', 'try', 'can', 'quickly', 'select', 'recipes', 'try', 'main', 'menu', 'exact', 'recipes', 'are', 'booklet', 'included', 'DVD', 'recipes', 'Jennifer', 'Cornbleet', 'how', 'make', 'are', 'Breakfast', 'fruit', 'smooothie', 'green', 'juice', 'granola', 'almond', 'milkLunch', 'garden', 'soup', 'pate', 'served', 'crudites', 'tomato', 'stacks', 'pesto', 'sauce', 'sushiDinner', 'ranch', 'dressing', 'salad', 'Mediterranean', 'kale', 'zucchini', 'pastaDessert', 'chocolate', 'mousse', 'tartThese', 'recipes', 'are', 'enough', 'get', 'beginner', 'started', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'exotic', 'hard-to-find', 'ingredients', 'only', 'ingredients', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'finding', 'are', 'agave', 'nectar', 'raw', 'cacao', 'powder.These', 'recipes', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'dehydrator', 'only', 'equipment', 'need', 'majority', 'recipes', 'are', 'either', 'blender', 'food', 'processor', 'green', 'juice', 'juicer', 'zucchini', 'pasta', 'spiral', 'slicer', 'can', 'use', 'veggie', 'peeler', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'spiral', 'slicer', 'preparing', 'dishes', 'Cornbleet', 'exactly', 'what', 'doing', 'friendly', 'clear', 'voice', 'bonus', 'bonus', 'end', 'DVD', 'pack', 'when', ""'re"", 'travelling', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'forced', 'abandon', 'diet', 'when', ""'re"", 'away', 'home.Highly', 'recommended', 'beginner']",N/A

It includes a range of meals and snacks from almond milk, smoothies and green juice to lunches, dinners and desserts.The production quality is top-notch.  The author is an obvious expert who seems to really enjoy sharing her knowledge.  And the foods she prepares aren't intimidating or time-intensive.There is a 12-page companion booklet which includes equipment suggestions, recipes and even travel tips for healthy eating on the road.  I would have preferred it be more comprehensive, but I guess that's what her original best-selling book is for.It's a great resource which will have you eating healthy and feeling fantastic.And if you're not already incorporating a lot of raw foods into your current diet, who knows?

I've watched it several times already.Jennifer Cornbleet did an amazing job of giving step-by-step directions. She started out with showing how to set up your kitchen---the equipment you will use and where to place them for easy access. She then goes on to prepare (from start to finish) a few of the recipes. She makes a few recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. She includes many timesaving tips and gives good advice to those of us who are just starting out on a raw food diet.The dvd arrived within the timeframe it was promised and in very good condition. The picture was clear and of good quality. If you are new to being &#34;raw&#34; this is the dvd for you. Jennifer shows her enthusiasm for eating raw food as she makes the meals look so appetizing and appealing. For the price of the dvd, it is well worth it to give it a try. It is a tiny investment that could pay off big time towards your health.
