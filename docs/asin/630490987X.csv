438986,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,630490987X,Genevieve Hayes,"[1, 1]","""Biloxi Blues"" is the second in the trilogy of autobiographical plays Neil Simon wrote about Eugene Jerome (the first being ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" and the third being ""Broadway Bound"", both of which have also been made into movies). This installment sees Jerome (Matthew Broderick) drafted into the army and forced to endure basic training with a group of men he has absolutely nothing in common with and an ""eccentric"" drill sergeant, Sgt. Toomey (Christopher Walken). Rather than taking the easy option and making all of these characters two-dimensional stereotypes, as a lesser writer would do, however, Simon gives each of his characters depth and makes his audience genuinely love and respect them, even Sgt. Toomey, especially Sgt. Toomey - and Christopher Walken is really great in this part. My biggest problem with ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"" was that I found Eugene Jerome to be too passive. Simon actually addresses this issue directly in this play/film (one character actually tells Jerome that he is too passive), and the play/film is all the better for it.One of the biggest problems with many films that are based on stage plays is that they have a static, stagey feel to them. ""Biloxi Blues"", however, does not have this problem. The screen adaptation (the screenplay is also written by Neil Simon) is so good that I spent the whole film trying to work out how this could possibly have been performed on stage.Ever since I was a child, I have always enjoyed the films and plays of Neil Simon (""Murder By Death"" was my favourite film from the ages of 5 to 12), but rewatching ""Biloxi Blues"" the other night, I reached the conclusion that this is my favourite Neil Simon play/film and furthermore, is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life.

When the film was made he lost out to an inferior Jonathan Silverman.A few years later he recreated Eugene Jerome at the Ahmanson and Broadway in the follow up Biloxi Blues.  This time they were wise when they made the film, they kept Broderick.Biloxi Blues is semi autobiographical look at Neil Simon's experiences during boot camp during WWII.  Eugene has never out of Brooklyn, New York.  He is now going to the heart of the bible Biloxi, Missouri.  He has gone from on strict environment run by his Jewish mother to a toll different strict environment run by his tough drill sergeant.  These changes in situation is the basis of this movie.Matthew Broderick has Eugene Jerome down pat.  His perfectly timed quips define Eugene.  Broderick has moved on to bigger and better things but Eugene Jerome will be his defining character.Christopher Walken personifies the over the top drill instructor.  Walken doesn't take the easy road with this role.  He let's you see his frustration with being safe at home when he really wants to be on the front lines.

I watched this film a lot in preparation for my own going off to basic training in 1991, and I must say that it worked.  I learned a lot about the ""tricks"" and mindgames that the drill sargeant tries to play on fresh recruits, creating animosities and divisions among the men until they learn to bond together against the common enemy (the drill instructor himself).Though set in WWII, its still highly relevant today, with an interesting mix of characters and attitudes, who haven't changed much even today.  I love the wit and Matthew Broderick is perfect for this role (I didn't like the first installment, ""Brighton Beach Memoirs"").  One of my favorite scenes is when the guys are comparing their fantasies to see who has the best one.  It later turns out that one of the guys' fantasies does come true, to give the drill instructor a taste of his own cruelty.Some of the funniest bits of dialogue I've ever seen occur at the brothel, when Rowhena (sp?) gives Matthew's character a lesson in love that he's sure to take with him where ever he goes.  His nervousness is real and amusing to watch, as he uses his wit to feel more comfortable about what he's doing.  The film goes along pretty interesting for the most part, but kind of slopes near the end, where it gets too serious for its own good.  Despite that flaw, I still haven't seen any other film specifically about basic training that comes even close to accurate and relevancy as this one.  So, anyone going off to boot camp, make sure you watch this one before you go and learn from it.

438998,A3T2XJA9C7GQII,630490987X,Peter C. Morrison,"[3, 3]","Biloxi Blues is one of Neil Simon's most moving comedies.  The famous Simon one-liners are built into the play in the person of Eugene Jerome  (played by Matthew Broderick as a thinly disguised Simon himself), whose voice-over narration is that of a comic writer looking back on the often excruciating experience of boot camp just before the end of World War II.Eugene quips, speaking in retrospect and in the character of the young recruit, but more often he expresses frustration, anger, anxiety, or regret, as he learns to cope with Americans from all over the United States, some of whom do not share his outlook or sense of values.There are formidable, sharply etched characters, besides that of Eugene Jerome.  Arnold Epstein, Eugene's highly principled friend, is loathe to compromise his values, even if it means isolation, humiliating punishments, and confrontation with the sergeant in charge.  Then there is Sgt. Toomey, brilliantly played by Christopher Walken.  He is one of Neil Simon's most astounding creations, based no doubt on an actual person or at least a combination of real-life encounters.  Toomey is by turns brutal, funny, just, solicitous, and troubled, a complex authority figure who almost runs away with the film.  The audience can easily share the sentiments of the group as expressed by Eugene, that when he leaves they sorely miss him.The two women, Rowena the hooker (played by Parker Overall) and Daisy the Catholic school girl (played by Penelope Ann Miller) would seem at first glance to be the classic ""virgin and whore"" dichotomy as an influence in the hero's life.  However, it is difficult, despite her profession, to categorize Rowena, whose patience, compassion, and understanding incline her more towards the ""heart of gold"" cliche, but who is a unique non-stereotypical character in many ways.  Through Rowena, Simon shares with us the tenderness as well as the hilarity sometimes connected with a boy's first time.Every minute of Biloxi Blues is well-crafted and well-acted.  I found myself laughing until the tears came one minute and choking back tears of joy, relief, and compassion the next.

Now he's a fanatical drill sergeant who is challenged with a whole new platoon of recruits that he must train for war in just ten short weeks.And in this movie, when you put these two characters together, you get a lot of havoc and military-like comedy, especially with the other soldiers of the platoon, like Pvt. Wykowski, who is an outspoken guy, but seems to know the wants and needs of his other friends, and Pvt. Epstein, a Jewish recruit who clearly states in this movie, ""The army has it's logic and I have mine.""Daisy Hanigan plays the Catholic girl who attends school in nearby Gulfport that has a run-in with Matthew Broderick.
