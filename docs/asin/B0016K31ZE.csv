Erland,"[10, 10]","The '07 release `Mama's Boy' delivers another fine, though surprisingly reserved performance by Joh Heder as Jeffrey, the insecure, hypochondriac, stay-at-home 29 year old who finds his world threatened when his Mother (Diane Keaton) decides to re-enter the dating scene. When new boyfriend Mert (Jeff Daniels), a life-affirming motivational speaker moves in Jeffrey's world begins to fall apart. Will he accept the newcomer into the family home with open arms or perceive him as a challenger and usurper of his Mother's affection?There's not a lot of surprises here but it's still an entertaining watch with a soundtrack infused with `The Smiths' and `Morrissey' that work perfectly with the on-screen action. Anna Faris is also quite good as Nora, a Courtney Love(ish) songstress who falls for the hapless Mama's boy caus Jeffery to re-evaluate his sheltered existence even further.If you're a big Jon Heder fan you'll definitely wan to had this one to your DVD collection, but thoroughly enjoyable even if you're not.My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.",3,"""The Seductive Sound Of The Astronomy Siren"" ~ Love, Second Chances And Growing Up",1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,1045,"['release', 'Mama', 'Boy', 'delivers', 'fine', 'surprisingly', 'reserved', 'performance', 'Joh', 'Heder', 'Jeffrey', 'insecure', 'hypochondriac', 'stay-at-home', '29', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'world', 'threatened', 'when', 'Mother', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 're-enter', 'dating', 'scene', 'When', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Mert', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'life-affirming', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'moves', 'Jeffrey', 'world', 'fall', 'apart', 'Will', 'accept', 'newcomer', 'family', 'home', 'open', 'arms', 'perceive', 'challenger', 'usurper', 'Mother', 'affection', 'not', 'lot', 'surprises', 'here', 'still', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'soundtrack', 'infused', 'Smiths', 'Morrissey', 'work', 'perfectly', 'on-screen', 'action', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Nora', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'ish', 'songstress', 'who', 'hapless', 'Mama', 'boy', 'caus', 'Jeffery', 're-evaluate', 'sheltered', 'existence', 'even', 'further.If', ""'re"", 'big', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'wan', 'had', 'one', 'DVD', 'collection', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'even', ""'re"", 'not.My', 'Rating', '-3', '1/2', 'Stars-']",Mama's Boy

(see title) Mama's Boy. When Mom decides it's time to start dating again, it puts a wrinkle in Jeffrey's otherwise comfortable pampered homelife. Then of course when the dating becomes serious, Jeffrey's life is turned upside down.There really is no way to give away spoilers because we've seen these movies playout thousands of times. Sure, maybe it's a different premise, but the plot points are so much on point, you could put a stop watch to them. Boy runs into problem, boy plots to defeat problem, boy messes things up, boy realizes the airs in his ways, boy corrects problem in about 5 minutes of film time and rides off into the sunset.It's not a bust out funny film, although I did a couple of times, and it's not a bad film. Anna Faris was cute. Jeff Daniels was funny. Jon Heder was well cast. Diane Keaton was solid as usual.

This is a boring film with a unlovable, loser protagonist and a potentially stellar supporting cast that is wasted on a useless plot.The producers of this film obviously thought that by presenting a cynical, selfish, spiteful version of Napoleon Dynamite they would entertain an audience, they failed. There is nothing redeeming in Heder's characters condescending, poor me attitude and yet he's surrounded by characters that seem to project some type of puppy dog aura on him just to stand being in the room with him. Ultimately there really is no character arc, everyone around him finally chews him out and he relents to behaving like a descent person.It's sad to see great comedic actors like Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris wasted in a movie like this, in fact, it would have been much funnier if Jeff Daniels were playing the lead...and the story were re-written...and it wasn't called Mama's Boy which sounds too much like Grandma's Boy.Just stay away from this film, you will not be entertained.",1,"Jon Heder, Begone!",1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,1066,"['be', 'fewer', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'films', 'more', 'Jared', 'Hess', 'films', 'boring', 'film', 'unlovable', 'loser', 'protagonist', 'potentially', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wasted', 'useless', 'plot.The', 'producers', 'film', 'obviously', 'thought', 'presenting', 'cynical', 'selfish', 'spiteful', 'version', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'would', 'entertain', 'audience', 'failed', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'Heder', 'characters', 'condescending', 'poor', 'attitude', 'yet', 'surrounded', 'characters', 'seem', 'project', 'type', 'puppy', 'dog', 'aura', 'just', 'stand', 'being', 'room', 'Ultimately', 'really', 'character', 'arc', 'everyone', 'around', 'finally', 'out', 'behaving', 'descent', 'person.It', 'sad', 'see', 'great', 'comedic', 'actors', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'wasted', 'movie', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'funnier', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'were', 'playing', 'lead', 'story', 'were', 're-written', 'was', ""n't"", 'called', 'Mama', 'Boy', 'too', 'much', 'Grandma', 'Boy.Just', 'stay', 'away', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'entertained']",Mama's Boy

We have the neurotic Jeffrey (Jon Heder) who lives with his mother, there's the motivational speaker Mert (Jeff Daniels) who talks in clich&eacute;s (""the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams""), the untalented aspiring singer Nora (Anna Faris) who only sings about how she hates big corporations, and of course Jeffrey's employer Seymour (Eli Wallach). The most normal character is Jeffrey's mother Jan (Diane Keaton). All the actors do a great job. Diane Keaton is one of my favorite actors, but here both Daniels and Heder steal scenes from her.These characters are given some hilarious moments but the script is a bit formulaic and after about one hour it turns into more of a drama than a comedy.
