The orchestra was superb and the children's choir was wonderful too. Domingo was young no more, neither was any of the other two. But their voice and singing was not aged at all. Very enjoyable.Having said that,  are we really that short of composer that there is no way we could make a proper trio or a duet out of these marvelous opera singers? Instead we only  have them sing solos or doing the same part all the time AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!Particularly so when Domingo is at the same time such a wonderful baritone singer.

I also just watched/listened to the Yule Log version which, imo, is also a holiday treasure, too (same concert).If you enjoy the kitsch of the Yule Log--and having it ""burning"" brightly during Christmas Eve and morning activities--this dvd solves the biggest problem of the Yule Log dvds--inconsistent music quality.This dvd and the ""Three Tenors Christmas--Yule Log"" are the same concert, but songs in a different order. Somehow, seeing a fireplace while you just LISTEN to the tenors minimizes many of the ""in concert"" problems that others have mentioned with the dvd--most notably, Pavarotti's struggles with English (and apparently minimal French and German), and his apparent emotional disconnect at times from the other two.Without the visual distraction of the dvd concert, the tenors' voices blend beautifully and the quality of the performances actually seems much improved. Of course, I enjoy Carreras' interesting personal blend of delicacy and fervor on stage (something which is lost without the ""performance"" dvd)--and Domingo's beaming warmth and intelligence that infuses every song. (Pavarotti's personal and musical self-assurance still shines through in the music without seeing him, perhaps even more so without the visual).DVD concert and Yule Log DVD are both so enjoyable.

I hugely enjoyed the concert, because when it comes to fine singers, you would have to go a long way to hear three better singers than these individuals.  I have no problem with the DVD, and while the song selection may be a little disconnected to some American viewers, they were all done well IMO.  The only quibble I might have is how in the work is Imagine by John Lennon a Christmas song?  While Domingo is and has always been my favorite of the three, I thought all of them did a very adequate job in their  performance.  While some reviewers are fond of constantly pointing out the late Pavarotti's shortcomings in English pronunciation, I advise them to try and sing in German, Italian, or Japanese, for that matter and sing it at that level before they complain.  Me, vocally, I can't hold a tune in a washtub, so I enjoy listening to three masters singing Christmas songs in a manner that will, hopefully, be remembered for a long time.

Even if they are the superstars of opera, they're not supernatural and to me it doesn't feel right to constantly compare a singer to his former performances. However, all three tenors are in good mood this evening and their singing is wonderful, so if you're looking for a dvd to put you in the right Christmas spirit, try this one.This concert is a mixture of solos and duets as well as all of them performing together. The repertoire spanning from traditional Christmas songs to more popular versions makes this dvd very enjoyable. There are beautiful renditions of the Spanish songs ""La Virgen lava pa&ntilde;ales"" and ""Feliz navidad"" where Carreras and Domingo obviously feel at home. I also love Carreras' rendition of ""Pregaria"". And ""Carol of the drum"" is one of my favourites. It's fun listening to ""I'll be home for Christmas"", ""Sleigh ride"" and ""Winter wonderland"". The two latter will probably make you start toe-tapping.It's true that Pavarotti's mastering of the English language isn't too good. He's actually giving some of these songs a whole new meaning, but shouldn't we forgive an old man for that? I find it amusing when he's singing ""I'll be home for Christmas, you can play on me..."". Or what about when he's singing ""I'll be home for Christmas, please have snow and MISTLE AND TOE......""  And the first time I watched this dvd and heard him calling HOO-HOO and saw Carreras' reaction to it, I just had to laugh. In my opinion this only adds to the charm of these three opera singers. The minor mistakes we hear them doing makes them only more approachable. And after all, it is a live concert - not a studio recording.I know what I'm going to do this Christmas. I'll light a lot of candles, possibly light the fire, get out all the Christmas candy and make myself a cup of hot chocolate before curling into a comfy chair and watching this concert.

The air is light and the old guys are obviously enjoying themselves more than in the paris concert the year before.Domingo is the clear best in this concert.  He is 100x better than the year before in paris.  He is sleak and younger looking; his voice not missing a beat.  The instrument is just as glorious as it was for the first 3 tenors concert.  He is getting up there in years and his voice shows no sign of going away.  He sings with a dark and soothing tone all night annd some of his performannces are really quite memorable; and understandable.  His english is charming and excellent.  Bravo Placido!Carreras sounds much better than he did in paris.  I might even go as far as to say that his middle range is more solid than in los Angeles in 1994; but his high notes weren't there in Vienna. It was refreshing to see him in this concert because he comes off as an artist; not as someone who was an artist before he blew out his voice and started wobbing his way through showy and glitzy galas playing off of his former talent.  The main difference is he stays within his limits;  he sings above the staff only twice all night and keeps away from his warbling fortissimo's as much as possible.  There is no doubt the voice that rocked opera in  the early eighties is gone; but he presented a charming, well rounded baritenor sound only slightly warbly.  His piano's are still graceful and his solo is surprizingly solid.  His reapearence on the opera stage in SLY appears to have brought his voice into a cohesive unit again.  He also looks much more charming with undyed hair.Pavarotti sounds like Pavarotti.  He sings a billion high notes and his tone is still spinning like a much younger man. Beyond his great sound the concert is a failure for him.  His pronuciaton is a mockery of english.  Words roll out of his mouth like drool which ruins the unbroken legato with which he usually sings.  This is expecially bad in the more classical nummbers like O holy night.  He also fails to bring the same amount of energy that the other two bring. But look at it this way:  His doing well for a man in his late 60's.  I know alot of them who are in nursing homes;  So its all relative.  I tip my hat to a sextagenarian popping off high notes with relative ease.The mood is light and the singing is fabulous.
