The combo of Cher, Winona Ryder, and Christina Ricci is phenomenal.  Bob Hoskins is great as Cher's love interest.  And the very cute Michael Schoeffling (he of Sixteen Candles fame--at least to us kids of the '80s) as the object of Winona Ryder's affection.  Great writing, plot, and characters.  These aren't some cartoony, 2 dimensional, cardboard cutouts.

148779,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792842405,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Teenage family crisis drama movies are really a dime a dozen, and sadly what you see in one you get in the other; there seems to be no originality.  That said, `Mermaids' feels like a breath of fresh air to the genre, coupling the familiar prose with some charming performances and some bite, thanks in large part to Cher's dynamic performance.  Sure, it's not the most original film, but it has enough going for it to be both memorable and entertaining.The film tells of the Flax family.  Mrs. Flax is a single mom dealing with her two young daughters Charlotte and Kate.  The youngest, Kate, is occupied with swimming while Charlotte, the young teen, is occupied with Jesus.  Yes, as an act of rebellion young Charlotte has decided to embrace Catholicism, despite being Jewish.  Her mother just allows this to roll off her back, hoping that her carefree attitude will help not to encourage her daughter's rebellion.  There is obvious resentment as Charlotte watches her mother act as if she were the teenager, flaunting her sensuality like it were her only attribute.  Every time her mother ends a relationship they move, and this angers Charlotte, but their latest home brings a sense of stability and self awareness that neither Charlotte nor her mother had felt before.When Mrs. Flax meets and falls for Lou Landsky, the local shoe guy, everything changes for the Flax girls.  They now have a stable man in their lives, but is that stability something they can handle?The acting really elevates this film, Cher, Ryder and Hoskins all delivering some of their finest work.  I am becoming a huge fan of Cher.  She repeatedly delivered very strong performances in the 80's and early 90's.  From her comedic work here as well as in `Moonstruck' to her dynamic dramatic performance in `Mask', this is yet another flawless performance that proves this woman had a lot going on.  Winona was also a wonderful actress in the early 90's.  Her consistently strong work in films like `The Crucible' or `Reality Bites' and `Little Woman' should not be forgotten just because she happened to shoplift a few years ago.  If any actress is in need of a comeback (and deserves one) I'd say it's this girl.  She had so much natural talent.  She is sublime here as well, holding her own against Cher.  I love me some Hoskins, like always, and here is yet another wonderfully complete performance.  He can do funny, he can do edgy, he can do scary...he can do anything and he continues to this day to impress me.The fact that Hoskins and Cher have such undeniable believable chemistry is a true testament to talent; you just want to pinch both of them they are so cute together!Sure, like I said, this is not a perfect example of originality (it is rather predictable when you think about it) but the character development is very strong and the performances really work to make this film above average in terms of genre.  It's wholly enjoyable and touching, and is a film one can watch again and again without ever getting bored.",4,Sweet and charming despite its familiarity...,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,3014,"['Teenage', 'family', 'crisis', 'drama', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'dime', 'dozen', 'sadly', 'what', 'see', 'one', 'get', 'other', 'there', 'be', 'originality', 'said', 'Mermaids', 'feels', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'genre', 'coupling', 'familiar', 'prose', 'charming', 'performances', 'bite', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Cher', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'Sure', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'film', 'enough', 'going', 'be', 'memorable', 'entertaining.The', 'film', 'tells', 'Flax', 'family', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'single', 'mom', 'dealing', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Charlotte', 'Kate', 'youngest', 'Kate', 'occupied', 'swimming', 'Charlotte', 'young', 'teen', 'occupied', 'Jesus', 'Yes', 'act', 'rebellion', 'young', 'Charlotte', 'decided', 'embrace', 'Catholicism', 'being', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'just', 'roll', 'off', 'back', 'hoping', 'carefree', 'attitude', 'will', 'help', 'not', 'encourage', 'daughter', 'rebellion', 'obvious', 'resentment', 'Charlotte', 'mother', 'act', 'were', 'teenager', 'flaunting', 'sensuality', 'were', 'only', 'attribute', 'Every', 'time', 'mother', 'relationship', 'move', 'angers', 'Charlotte', 'latest', 'home', 'sense', 'stability', 'self', 'awareness', 'Charlotte', 'mother', 'had', 'felt', 'before.When', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'meets', 'falls', 'Lou', 'Landsky', 'local', 'shoe', 'guy', 'everything', 'changes', 'Flax', 'girls', 'now', 'have', 'stable', 'man', 'lives', 'stability', 'something', 'can', 'handle', 'acting', 'really', 'film', 'Cher', 'Ryder', 'Hoskins', 'delivering', 'finest', 'work', 'am', 'becoming', 'huge', 'fan', 'Cher', 'repeatedly', 'delivered', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', '80', 'early', '90', 'comedic', 'work', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Moonstruck', 'dynamic', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'Mask', 'yet', 'flawless', 'performance', 'woman', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'Winona', 'was', 'also', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'early', '90', 'consistently', 'strong', 'work', 'films', 'Crucible', 'Reality', 'Bites', 'Little', 'Woman', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'just', 'happened', 'shoplift', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'actress', 'need', 'comeback', 'one', ""'d"", 'say', 'girl', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'natural', 'talent', 'sublime', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'holding', 'own', 'Cher', 'love', 'Hoskins', 'always', 'here', 'yet', 'wonderfully', 'complete', 'performance', 'can', 'do', 'funny', 'can', 'do', 'edgy', 'can', 'do', 'scary', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'day', 'impress', 'me.The', 'fact', 'Hoskins', 'Cher', 'have', 'such', 'undeniable', 'believable', 'chemistry', 'true', 'testament', 'talent', 'just', 'want', 'pinch', 'are', 'so', 'cute', 'together', 'Sure', 'said', 'not', 'perfect', 'example', 'originality', 'rather', 'predictable', 'when', 'think', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'really', 'work', 'make', 'film', 'average', 'terms', 'genre', 'wholly', 'enjoyable', 'touching', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'ever', 'getting', 'bored']",N/A

148781,A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y,0792842405,Ben Adam,"[3, 4]","A lightweight but enjoyable chick flick set in the Sixties starring Cher in the role of Mrs. Flax, a single mother who is forever moving from one place to the next every time one of her love affairs runs aground, or so tells her daughter Charlotte (Winona Ryder), whose narration appears here and there in the film to fill in the gaps when the plot would not normally explain itself. From the outset, the Flax family is a study in contrasts. Mrs. Flax (her first name is never disclosed in the film, which seems odd, as she is the most extroverted member of the family) is flirtatious to a fault. Charlotte, although her family is Jewish, is obsessed with Catholicism and the Catholic rite. Kate is totally involved in swimming and nothing else, hence the title of the film. Mrs. Flax wastes no time in striking up a friendship with Lou Landsky (Bob Hoskins), the shoe-store proprietor in the center of town, and that friendship quickly becomes intimate. Charlotte's obsessive pursuit of the celibate life of a nun is shaken when she meets a handsome man who works at the convent (Michael Schoeffling).The plot tends to meander somewhat in the latter part of the film, but the dialogue in the film is first rate, and somehow the acting keeps the film afloat. The pairing of Bob Hoskins and Cher might seem unlikely, but they are an amazing couple in the film. The sequence in which Charlotte discovers that she is not pregnant comes across as particularly amusing, especially considering who her mother is and how unlikely it would be that she would reach that age and be so naive; whether it is believable or not, it still gets a good laugh. The finale has little, if anything, to do with the film, but by then, who cares? It's just for the fun of it, and that's what this film is about: having fun.",3,A Fun Chick Flick with Many Good Moments,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1800,"['lightweight', 'enjoyable', 'chick', 'flick', 'set', 'Sixties', 'starring', 'Cher', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'forever', 'moving', 'one', 'place', 'next', 'time', 'one', 'love', 'affairs', 'aground', 'so', 'daughter', 'Charlotte', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'narration', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'fill', 'gaps', 'when', 'plot', 'would', 'not', 'normally', 'explain', 'outset', 'Flax', 'family', 'study', 'contrasts', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'first', 'name', 'never', 'disclosed', 'film', 'odd', 'most', 'extroverted', 'member', 'family', 'flirtatious', 'fault', 'Charlotte', 'family', 'Jewish', 'obsessed', 'Catholicism', 'Catholic', 'rite', 'Kate', 'totally', 'involved', 'swimming', 'nothing', 'else', 'hence', 'title', 'film', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'time', 'striking', 'up', 'friendship', 'Lou', 'Landsky', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'shoe-store', 'proprietor', 'center', 'town', 'friendship', 'quickly', 'intimate', 'Charlotte', 'obsessive', 'pursuit', 'celibate', 'life', 'nun', 'shaken', 'when', 'handsome', 'man', 'who', 'convent', 'Michael', 'Schoeffling', '.The', 'plot', 'tends', 'meander', 'somewhat', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'dialogue', 'film', 'first', 'rate', 'somehow', 'acting', 'film', 'afloat', 'pairing', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Cher', 'might', 'seem', 'unlikely', 'are', 'amazing', 'couple', 'film', 'sequence', 'Charlotte', 'not', 'pregnant', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'especially', 'considering', 'who', 'mother', 'how', 'unlikely', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'reach', 'age', 'be', 'so', 'naive', 'believable', 'not', 'still', 'good', 'laugh', 'finale', 'little', 'anything', 'do', 'film', 'then', 'who', 'just', 'fun', 'what', 'film', 'having', 'fun']",N/A

Cher is a talented actress, but that talent is truly displayed when she plays an unusual character. That is the case here. In this movie, she is Mrs. Flax, a woman with two daughters that is ahead of her time. Abandoned by her husband during the birth of her first child and having been impregnated by a guest at the hotel where she was working as a maid, Mrs. Flax stays in a location for a short time and then moves on. Given the time setting of the early sixties, it makes her very unusual.This is very hard on her children, particularly the oldest daughter Charlotte. Having been unable to establish roots, Charlotte's goal is to become a Catholic nun, even though she is Jewish. Throughout the early part of the movie, there are voiceovers of what is going through her mind as she encounters various forms of temptation. These voiceovers add a degree of seriousness and comedy to what is the very serious problems of a teenage girl. Kate is the youngest daughter and a great swimmer with Olympic hopes. She practices holding her breath in the bathtub, which makes for occasional humorous interludes.On a whim that is a stab on a map, they end up in a small town in Massachusetts, where Mrs. Flax meets Lou, a shoe salesman played by Bob Hoskins. Mrs. Flax and Lou hit it off immediately and they enter into an unusual romance. The degree to which Cher and Hoskins blend and play off of each other is amazing, it seems that their opposite actual personalities serves them very well as they play opposites on the screen.There are two high points in the movie. The first is the assassination of President Kennedy and the reaction of the people. This is very well done, the tenseness of the people surrounding television sets in stores and businesses and the looks on their faces. The second is when Charlotte is experiencing her first sexual encounter and Kate falls in the water and almost drowns. This brings all of their tensions and problems to the surface, where Charlotte finally expresses all of the frustrations about her life and admits that her father will not be coming back.Not by any means a great movie, this is one with many unusual twists and turns as people with problems try to cope and overcome them. It has the unusual aspect that you feel happy for Charlotte when she is engaging in sex for the first time, even though it clearly is the wrong thing to do at that time.",4,A quirky chick-flick,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,2516,"['wife', 'recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'called', 'quirky', 'chick-flick', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', 'Cher', 'talented', 'actress', 'talent', 'truly', 'displayed', 'when', 'unusual', 'character', 'case', 'here', 'movie', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'woman', 'two', 'daughters', 'ahead', 'time', 'Abandoned', 'husband', 'birth', 'first', 'child', 'having', 'been', 'impregnated', 'guest', 'hotel', 'where', 'was', 'working', 'maid', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'location', 'short', 'time', 'then', 'moves', 'Given', 'time', 'setting', 'early', 'sixties', 'very', 'unusual.This', 'very', 'hard', 'children', 'particularly', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Charlotte', 'Having', 'been', 'unable', 'establish', 'roots', 'Charlotte', 'goal', 'become', 'Catholic', 'nun', 'even', 'Jewish', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'are', 'voiceovers', 'what', 'going', 'mind', 'various', 'forms', 'temptation', 'voiceovers', 'add', 'degree', 'seriousness', 'comedy', 'what', 'very', 'serious', 'problems', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Kate', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'great', 'swimmer', 'Olympic', 'practices', 'holding', 'breath', 'bathtub', 'occasional', 'humorous', 'interludes.On', 'whim', 'stab', 'map', 'end', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'Massachusetts', 'where', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'Lou', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'played', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'Lou', 'hit', 'off', 'immediately', 'enter', 'unusual', 'romance', 'degree', 'Cher', 'Hoskins', 'blend', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'amazing', 'opposite', 'actual', 'personalities', 'very', 'well', 'play', 'opposites', 'are', 'two', 'high', 'points', 'movie', 'first', 'assassination', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'reaction', 'people', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'tenseness', 'people', 'surrounding', 'television', 'sets', 'stores', 'businesses', 'looks', 'second', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'experiencing', 'first', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'Kate', 'water', 'almost', 'drowns', 'tensions', 'problems', 'surface', 'where', 'Charlotte', 'finally', 'frustrations', 'life', 'father', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'coming', 'back.Not', 'means', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'many', 'unusual', 'twists', 'as', 'people', 'problems', 'try', 'cope', 'overcome', 'unusual', 'aspect', 'feel', 'happy', 'Charlotte', 'when', 'engaging', 'sex', 'first', 'time', 'even', 'clearly', 'wrong', 'thing', 'do', 'time']",N/A

148787,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0792842405,Dennis Littrell,"[24, 29]","Cher plays a free-spirited, uninhibited and saucy mother of two.  Charlotte (Winona Ryder) and Kate (Christina Ricci), who are about 15- and 8-years old respectively, are her daughters.  Cher's behavior and appearance is an embarrassment to Charlotte who is trying to think ""pure thoughts"" on her way to becoming a nun.  Ironically (considering Ryder's recent troubles) the part she plays has no interest in new clothes and even refuses new shoes, content with her old square boots that look like they were made in the former Soviet Union during the reign of Stalin.  This is a nice (but increasingly familiar) switch on the mother who is embarrassed by her daughter's precocious sexuality, and Cher and Ryder play their parts well.The story, from a novel by Patty Dann, begins with the trio moving into yet another town, this time somewhere in New England.  They are always on the run, so to speak, because Cher is afraid of commitment or of staying around long enough to lose her heart to some guy.  Enter predictably a man (Bob Hoskins) with the right stuff to win her over and a cute guy (Michael Schoeffing) to rearrange Charlotte's priorities.  Director Richard Benjamin plays it as a romantic comedy ... coming of ager with wit and charm.  Ryder is adorably cute as a conservative Christian miss goody two shoes who is always lecturing mom while Cher is voluptuous as the kind of woman who says yes, early and often, but underneath it all has strength and a kind of intuitive wisdom about herself and the people around her.  Little Ricci really is the mermaid since she likes to practice holding her breath under water.Part of the strength of the film is in the dialogue and the sharp repartee between Ryder and Cher.  My favorite line is from Charlotte who is always dialoging with God.  After seeing Schoeffing, who drives the school bus, and realizing what she is feeling, prays ""Oh please God, don't make me fall in love and want to do disgusting things!""",4,Cute and funny,1032393600,"09 19, 2002",2002,1966,"['Cher', 'free-spirited', 'uninhibited', 'saucy', 'mother', 'two', 'Charlotte', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Kate', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'are', '15-', '8-years', 'old', 'respectively', 'are', 'daughters', 'Cher', 'behavior', 'appearance', 'embarrassment', 'Charlotte', 'who', 'trying', 'think', 'pure', 'thoughts', 'way', 'becoming', 'nun', 'Ironically', 'considering', 'Ryder', 'recent', 'troubles', 'part', 'interest', 'new', 'clothes', 'even', 'new', 'shoes', 'content', 'old', 'square', 'boots', 'look', 'were', 'made', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'reign', 'Stalin', 'nice', 'increasingly', 'familiar', 'switch', 'mother', 'who', 'embarrassed', 'daughter', 'precocious', 'sexuality', 'Cher', 'Ryder', 'play', 'parts', 'story', 'novel', 'Patty', 'Dann', 'trio', 'moving', 'yet', 'town', 'time', 'somewhere', 'New', 'England', 'are', 'always', 'run', 'so', 'speak', 'Cher', 'afraid', 'commitment', 'staying', 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'lose', 'heart', 'guy', 'Enter', 'predictably', 'man', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'right', 'stuff', 'win', 'over', 'cute', 'guy', 'Michael', 'Schoeffing', 'rearrange', 'Charlotte', 'priorities', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'coming', 'ager', 'wit', 'charm', 'Ryder', 'adorably', 'cute', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'miss', 'goody', 'two', 'shoes', 'who', 'always', 'lecturing', 'mom', 'Cher', 'voluptuous', 'kind', 'woman', 'who', 'yes', 'early', 'often', 'strength', 'kind', 'intuitive', 'wisdom', 'herself', 'people', 'Little', 'Ricci', 'really', 'mermaid', 'practice', 'holding', 'breath', 'water.Part', 'strength', 'film', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'repartee', 'Ryder', 'Cher', 'favorite', 'line', 'Charlotte', 'who', 'always', 'dialoging', 'God', 'seeing', 'Schoeffing', 'who', 'school', 'bus', 'realizing', 'what', 'feeling', 'Oh', 'please', 'God', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'want', 'do', 'disgusting', 'things']",N/A

The eccentric 1960s soundtrack complements the eccentric family portrayed by Cher, Winona Ryder, and Christina Ricci. There are some delightful moments with Ricci, especially when she sticks a pumpkin on her head and chases her mother! The film's title might seem misleading, with Mermaids only being relevant in passing. Having thought about this, Hans Christian Andersen's story of The Little Mermaid has the main character having to return to sea and not be with her lover or she will lose her freedom to swim underwater, and I think this is the point that is being made here. Cher's character has always moved on from one town (and one boyfriend) to the next in order not to lose her freedom to do so. This reflects the prevailing view of women in 1960s western society in that it would be acceptable for men to do this, but for a woman it's a little scandalous. The film falls into the trap of a lot of period drama in that almost all the cars seem like well-kept 1963 vintage vehicles, with only Cher's car being dirtied down enough to look realistic. But they look great, so why worry? Bob Hoskins plays against type as a kindly American who changes the lives of the three girls and Winona Ryder is the focus of the family as a confused teenager who sometimes seems more down to Earth than her mother.

The story seems tentative and unfinished and the Cast often flounder trying to flesh out this mess.

Charlotte (Ryder) is an annoying teenager obsessed with the Bible and with not wanting to be like her Mother, who she perceives to be immoral. Ricci is too precious for words, but manages to be less insufferable than Ryder. Poor Bob Hoskins, who has a psuedo-relationship with Cher but then sort of fades away halfway through the film: he is far too good to be in this drivel. All of this leaves Cher playing a character that verges on self-parody and  she attempts to bring some excitement to the part by overacting to beat the band. Her big dramatic moments recall Sally Field's overdone graveyard scene in ""Steel Magnolias.""

Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[9, 10]","Mermaids is narrated by the angst-filled teenaged Charlotte Flax (Ryder), who is exasperated by the tendency of her mother (Cher) to move house (and state) as soon as the bin's full, or (more likely) as soon as her latest entanglement with a married boss starts to unravel. Mrs Flax, as Charlotte disparagingly refers to her mother Rachel, is a peripatetic soul, whose only answer to life's challenges is to leave them behind. For Charlotte, the only consolation to her most unsatisfactory lifestyle is her adoration of her little sister, Kate (Ricci), on whom she dotes. In spite of their Jewish origins, Charlotte is obsessed with the mysteries, icons and rites of the Catholic Church. Its rituals of penitence and martyrdom fascinate her and she can relate the history and grisly fate of each of the martyred saints in all their goriest detail.As we are introduced to the Flax girls, mother and daughter are embroiled in conflict again, as they find themselves in a new home and a new state, this time Massachusetts. The brooding teenager and her charismatic mother have very different priorities of need as they set up their new home. Charlotte needs grounding, Rachel needs distraction and action. Their conflict spills over as the family goes to buy shoes, particularly when Rachel does nothing to deflect the more-than-professional attention she receives from the shoe store owner, Lou Landsky (Hoskins). This particularly galls Charlotte, who carries a fantasy in her heart that the father she never knew will one day come back and complete her family and her longing.She regards her mother's acceptance of Lou's advances with disdain, whilst at the same time harbouring a guilt-ridden romantic obsession with young Joe Porretti (Michael Schoeffling) - a young local man with a past who works as a handyman at the nearby convent (perfect!).As they become more entrenched in this small town, Rachel and Lou spend more and more time together. He is besotted with Rachel, and becoming closer to the girls, none of which is really part of Rachel's game plan. She is reluctant to engage in any form of long term arrangement (even the meals she serves are finger food - in her estimation - anything else smacks too much of a commitment), and does not want to include anyone else in her family.The dilemmas and dramas of Rachel and Charlotte play out as the opposite extremes of a similar persona. Whilst Rachel is winsome, free-spirited and charismatic, and Charlotte is repressed, ultraconservative and introverted, both are utterly flamboyant and solipsistically theatrical. Each of them engage in outrageous flights of dramatic fancy that frequently have momentous impact on those around them whilst, in the main, they emerge relatively unscathed from their melodramatic follies.That is, until little Kate has a mishap of her own, with potentially devastating consequences. For the first time, neither Rachel nor Charlotte have control over their own destinies; and they do not handle it well. Whilst they wrestle with their guilt and grief by engaging in the blame-fest from hell, it's Lou who attends to the practical details.This is a stylish Hollywood set-piece that is better than average overall. The leads all turn in excellent performances, and whilst the conclusion was probably never in much doubt, it is a sufficiently engaging film to warrant lazy Sunday afternoon standby status. It bears watching more than once and is sufficiently quirky to maintain audience satisfaction.

Thankfully, my relationship with my mum is a lot better than the relationship between the two main characters, played fantastically by Cher & Winona Ryder. Sometimes the movie comes across as over ambitious: there's a little sister (Christina Ricci, in a very young role) and also two separate love stories run simultaneously with the mother-daughter theme.Christina Ricci is the shining star in this movie, she's very cute looking, although at one point she does look like ET! She seems to be left to the side a lot, as the main characters are Winona & Cher, but when Christina is in a scene with them, she steals the limelight firmly away. Hard to believe she was only 10 in this movie, and has since rumoured to have a breast reduction - although it could be through to (severe) weight loss.Winona was prefect to play this role. It concerns all the teenage angst you can possibly have in one movie, although the scene where she goes to the doctor thinking she's pregnant after one peck on the lips is positively cringe worthy. The climax in her & Joe's relationship with their drunken love making scene shows all the tenderness & pain of your first time, whether you're drunk or not.

148807,A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ,0792842405,Nicholas Stix,"[10, 14]","A gentle chick flick with a token male, Mermaids nominally stars Cher, but is really a dramatic coming out party for Winona Ryder. I'd forgotten how winsome (no pun intended) Hollywood's most notorious shoplifter could be.Mermaids is about a wandering ""family"" of mom ""Rachel Flax"" (Cher), and her daughters ""Charlotte"" (a teenaged Ryder) and ""Kate"" (a very young Christina Ricci). Following another of countless relationships gone bad, Rachel has moved the girls yet again, to a small town in New England, in the early 1960s. We are supposed to find the family endearingly eccentric, and though this shtick is forced, it works with Ryder's Charlotte, and early in the picture, with Cher's Rachel. Mermaids was made in 1990, when the ""eccentric""/""fish out water"" fad was heating up, beginning with Twin Peaks (and then Northern Exposure), etc., except that instead of a town full of eccentrics, here we get eccentrics in a staid town.Mom is supposedly a slut, but the locals do not make the family suffer for her ""loose"" behavior; indeed, the town's character is not fleshed out.As noted, Cher, who was then living off of her best actress Oscar for 1987's Moonstruck, gets top billing, but she basically bulls through her scenes on star power, and as the picture progresses, is on screen less and less. Her Rachel Flax neglects her daughters, who get into trouble in her absence. You might say that she neglects the viewer, too. How can a ""star"" be absent from the screen as much as she is? It's as if the director, Richard Benjamin, had a change of heart halfway through filming, and decided to shift the focus of the story. Or perhaps Benjamin, the third director - the others were Lasse Hallstrom and Frank Oz -- on a troubled production, was caught between two semi-rewritten, June Roberts scripts. (Some reports blamed Cher for the contretemps.)Whatever dramatic interest the movie generates is through Ryder, who herself replaced Emily Lloyd, who reportedly walked off with director #1, Lasse Hallstrom. To the degree that Mermaids functions as a movie, it is as the coming-of-age story of this demure yet blossoming Jewish teenager who wants to become a nun, and who when she gets her first kiss, thinks she is pregnant, bound for a virgin birth. And yet, such cutesy naivete doesn't fit the daughter of a mother who's been around the block as many times as Rachel Flax has.Bob Hoskins' character, ""Lou Landsky,"" pops up early in the picture, has an affair with Cher's Rachel, and apparently employs Charlotte (for one brief scene, at least) in his odd, mixed-use store. While the affair continues for the rest of the picture, Hoskins' character is dribbled away. I guess the production team decided, ""That's enough for the guy; this is a chick flick, not The Terminator."" But Mermaids sank at the box office.Mermaids has been identified as a coming-of-age story, but that is merely one of the many tossed-off themes in June Roberts' underdeveloped script.While entertaining, Mermaids is a movie with only one fully fleshed-out character and some nice scenes, but something less than a story.The Critical Critic, September 20, 2003",3,Neither Fish nor Fowl,1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,3138,"['gentle', 'chick', 'flick', 'token', 'male', 'Mermaids', 'nominally', 'Cher', 'really', 'dramatic', 'coming', 'out', 'party', 'Winona', 'Ryder', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'how', 'winsome', 'pun', 'intended', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'notorious', 'shoplifter', 'could', 'be.Mermaids', 'wandering', 'family', 'mom', 'Rachel', 'Flax', 'Cher', 'daughters', 'Charlotte', 'teenaged', 'Ryder', 'Kate', 'very', 'young', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Following', 'countless', 'relationships', 'gone', 'bad', 'Rachel', 'moved', 'girls', 'yet', 'again', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'England', 'early', '1960s', 'are', 'supposed', 'find', 'family', 'endearingly', 'eccentric', 'shtick', 'forced', 'Ryder', 'Charlotte', 'early', 'picture', 'Cher', 'Rachel', 'Mermaids', 'was', 'made', '1990', 'when', 'eccentric', '/', 'fish', 'out', 'water', 'fad', 'was', 'heating', 'up', 'beginning', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'then', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'etc.', 'instead', 'town', 'full', 'eccentrics', 'here', 'get', 'eccentrics', 'staid', 'town.Mom', 'supposedly', 'slut', 'locals', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'family', 'suffer', 'loose', 'behavior', 'indeed', 'town', 'character', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out.As', 'noted', 'Cher', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'living', 'best', 'actress', 'Oscar', '1987', 'Moonstruck', 'top', 'billing', 'basically', 'scenes', 'star', 'power', 'picture', 'screen', 'less', 'less', 'Rachel', 'Flax', 'daughters', 'who', 'get', 'trouble', 'absence', 'might', 'say', 'viewer', 'too', 'How', 'can', 'star', 'be', 'absent', 'screen', 'as', 'much', 'director', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'had', 'change', 'heart', 'halfway', 'filming', 'decided', 'shift', 'focus', 'story', 'perhaps', 'Benjamin', 'third', 'director', 'others', 'were', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'troubled', 'production', 'was', 'caught', 'two', 'semi-rewritten', 'June', 'Roberts', 'scripts', 'reports', 'blamed', 'Cher', 'contretemps', 'dramatic', 'interest', 'movie', 'Ryder', 'who', 'replaced', 'Emily', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'reportedly', 'walked', 'off', 'director', '1', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'degree', 'Mermaids', 'functions', 'movie', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'demure', 'yet', 'blossoming', 'Jewish', 'teenager', 'who', 'become', 'nun', 'who', 'when', 'first', 'kiss', 'pregnant', 'bound', 'virgin', 'birth', 'yet', 'such', 'cutesy', 'naivete', ""n't"", 'fit', 'daughter', 'mother', 'who', 'been', 'block', 'many', 'times', 'Rachel', 'Flax', 'has.Bob', 'Hoskins', 'character', 'Lou', 'Landsky', 'up', 'early', 'picture', 'affair', 'Cher', 'Rachel', 'apparently', 'Charlotte', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'least', 'odd', 'mixed-use', 'store', 'affair', 'rest', 'picture', 'Hoskins', 'character', 'dribbled', 'away', 'guess', 'production', 'team', 'decided', 'enough', 'guy', 'chick', 'flick', 'not', 'Terminator', 'Mermaids', 'sank', 'box', 'office.Mermaids', 'been', 'identified', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'merely', 'one', 'many', 'tossed-off', 'themes', 'June', 'Roberts', 'underdeveloped', 'script.While', 'entertaining', 'Mermaids', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'fully', 'fleshed-out', 'character', 'nice', 'scenes', 'something', 'less', 'story.The', 'Critical', 'Critic', 'September', '20', '2003']",N/A

Another thing I find amusing is that it is nice to recognize a director who once was a great actor who few remember becoming and even better director than he was an actor, and thats a major compliment because his effort here is astonishing, considering all the factors. In this case its Richard Benjamin who serves up a beautiful story here about a wayward mother(Cher) raising two daughters on her own(Ricci and Ryder). Chers character is always wanting to take her two daughters away from their reasonable lives by moving to some other part of the country, seemingly trying to escape bad memories she cant ever truly escape. Winona Ryder, wonderful as ever, battles within her self between her lusts for a handsome young man and her own complicated and delusional commitment to God. And it torments her. Yet Benjamin tenderly showcases this torment in strangely hysterical ways. Its indeed also Ryders commentary that gives much of the film its comedic flow, and its truly brilliant to say the least. Christina Ricci in an early role puts the icing on the cake as a cute young girl whos passion is for swimming. Bob Hoskins is the perfect available man who is simply irresistable despite his rather squatty appearance. Its his cheerful and carefree personality that makes him likable. Though by the end of the film he might not exactly get his wish, the movie plays the story in the end pretty much they way real life can be. In short this movie is one of those glorious and unusual stories that truly touches the inner soul.

The clarion-voiced Cher, of course, has been singing since the mid-60's, with her then-husband, Sonny Bono and without him, and has had many chart-topping hits; they had a widely popular television show in the 1970s.  The actress won an Oscar for ""Moonstruck,"" also made ""Silkwood,"" ""The Witches of Eastwood,"" and ""Mask.""""Mermaids"" is, without doubt, a chick flick.  It was orignally meant to be the Scandinavian director Lasse Hallstrom's American film debut; however, Cher didn't care for his work.  Neither did she care for Frank Oz's.  So it was directed by former actor Richard Benjamin.  Unfortunately, many sophisticates can't say ""Richard Benjamin,"" without, in the same breath, declaring ""tv sitcom.""  And when it's a chick flick too, well, the scorn.The movie also stars the  English Bob Hoskins, playing Lou Landsky, lusty, unlikely love interest to Cher's Mrs. Rachel Flax.  The child Christina Ricci made her debut as Kate, Mrs. Flax's younger daughter, born to swim.  Winona Ryder holds the camera as the older daughter, Charlotte, in heavy flirtation with Catholism although the Flaxes are Jewish.  Ryder was then a child star, more particularly a teenage star, until Angelina Jolie stole ""Girl Interrupted,"" out from under her, and she had her regrettable adventure in shoplifting.  Oddly enough, the English teenage star Emily Lloyd had been signed to play this part, but she was blond.  Cher, who evidently had a lot of say on this picture, thought viewers were unlikely to accept a blond as her screen daughter. So Ryder was  brought in, and Lloyd received a studio settlement.The picture's set in a lovingly recreated 1963, and treats the major world event of that year, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, with considerable discretion and grace.  Mrs. Flax is a hot-blooded single mother who gets herself into talked-about trouble with men, then moves on to the next randomly-selected town.  Her daughters just must get in the car.  We open with the Flaxes' relocation to a pretty Massachusetts coastal town, where Mrs. Flax and, this time, her older daughter, will meet men.  Kate will win swim meets.The cinematography gives us plenty of pretty.  The soundtrack's chock-a-block with early 60's hits.  Included on the soundtrack, for sure, is Cher's adaptation of ""The Shoop Shoop Song,"" initially made a hit by Little Eva; now far better known as ""It's In His Kiss,"" by Cher. The script's witty: in an often-quoted line, Flax dismisses one of her daughter's teachers as a guy who drives an Edsel.  Does ""Mermaids"" have the heart of a sitcom?  Well, it has heart, for sure-- it's really about family.  And I don't watch tv sitcoms, can't abide them, but I love this movie.  The final, touching scenes, where the Flaxes dance around their kitchen, setting the table to Jimmy Soul's irresistible ""If You Want to be Happy the Rest of Your Life, Never Make a Pretty Woman Your Wife,"" perfectly express the relaxed intimacy, and joy, of family life, and present us another moving, off-handed movie dance scene.",5,Another Moving Dance Scene,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,3190,"['Mermaids', '1990', 'starring', 'well-known', 'singer-actress-entertainer', 'Cher', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'came', 'along', 'heels', '1980s', 'clarion-voiced', 'Cher', 'course', 'been', 'singing', 'mid-60', 'then-husband', 'Sonny', 'Bono', 'had', 'many', 'chart-topping', 'hits', 'had', 'widely', 'popular', 'television', 'show', '1970s', 'actress', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Moonstruck', 'also', 'made', 'Silkwood', 'Witches', 'Eastwood', 'Mask', 'Mermaids', 'doubt', 'chick', 'flick', 'was', 'orignally', 'meant', 'be', 'Scandinavian', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'American', 'film', 'debut', 'however', 'Cher', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'work', 'did', 'care', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'was', 'directed', 'former', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'sophisticates', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'same', 'breath', 'declaring', 'tv', 'sitcom', 'when', 'chick', 'flick', 'too', 'well', 'scorn.The', 'movie', 'also', 'English', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'playing', 'Lou', 'Landsky', 'lusty', 'unlikely', 'love', 'interest', 'Cher', 'Mrs.', 'Rachel', 'Flax', 'child', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'made', 'debut', 'Kate', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'younger', 'daughter', 'born', 'swim', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'camera', 'older', 'daughter', 'Charlotte', 'heavy', 'flirtation', 'Catholism', 'Flaxes', 'are', 'Jewish', 'Ryder', 'was', 'then', 'child', 'star', 'more', 'particularly', 'teenage', 'star', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'stole', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'had', 'regrettable', 'adventure', 'shoplifting', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'English', 'teenage', 'star', 'Emily', 'Lloyd', 'had', 'been', 'signed', 'play', 'part', 'was', 'blond', 'Cher', 'who', 'evidently', 'had', 'lot', 'say', 'picture', 'thought', 'viewers', 'were', 'unlikely', 'accept', 'blond', 'screen', 'daughter', 'So', 'Ryder', 'was', 'brought', 'Lloyd', 'received', 'studio', 'settlement.The', 'picture', 'set', 'lovingly', 'recreated', '1963', 'major', 'world', 'event', 'year', 'assassination', 'President', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'considerable', 'discretion', 'grace', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'hot-blooded', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'talked-about', 'trouble', 'men', 'then', 'next', 'randomly-selected', 'town', 'daughters', 'just', 'must', 'get', 'car', 'open', 'Flaxes', 'relocation', 'pretty', 'Massachusetts', 'coastal', 'town', 'where', 'Mrs.', 'Flax', 'time', 'older', 'daughter', 'will', 'meet', 'men', 'Kate', 'will', 'win', 'swim', 'meets.The', 'cinematography', 'plenty', 'pretty', 'soundtrack', 'chock-a-block', 'early', '60', 'hits', 'Included', 'soundtrack', 'sure', 'Cher', 'adaptation', 'Shoop', 'Shoop', 'Song', 'initially', 'made', 'hit', 'Little', 'Eva', 'now', 'far', 'better', 'known', 'Kiss', 'Cher', 'script', 'witty', 'often-quoted', 'line', 'Flax', 'one', 'daughter', 'teachers', 'guy', 'who', 'Edsel', 'Mermaids', 'have', 'heart', 'sitcom', 'Well', 'heart', 'sure', 'really', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'tv', 'sitcoms', 'ca', ""n't"", 'abide', 'love', 'movie', 'final', 'touching', 'scenes', 'where', 'Flaxes', 'dance', 'kitchen', 'setting', 'table', 'Jimmy', 'Soul', 'irresistible', 'Want', 'be', 'Happy', 'Rest', 'Your', 'Life', 'Never', 'Make', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Your', 'Wife', 'perfectly', 'express', 'relaxed', 'intimacy', 'joy', 'family', 'life', 'present', 'moving', 'off-handed', 'movie', 'dance', 'scene']",N/A

Christina R's character is adorable and interesting. All characters are deeply probed and the movie is a joy to watch.",4,Very good film,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,246,"['Love', 'Cher', 'character', 'Winona', 'far', 'best', 'be', 'pure', 'lust', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'Christina', 'R', 'character', 'adorable', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'deeply', 'probed', 'movie', 'joy', 'watch']",N/A

It is essentially a mother and daughter movie. Think of it as Terms of Endearment but not nearly as well put together or as emotional. It takes place in the 1960's so the movie features a lot of old music - which was enjoyable and cute. The movie is about Charlotte, a 15 year old who wants to become a nun, Rachel, the wild mother who likes to fool around with men, and Kate, the younger sister. After breaking up with her boyfriend, Rachel decides to move her family somewhere else, this is always what she did in previous situations too. In this town, Rachel falls in love once again with the dorky Lou, and they experience some problems with him wanting to be too much of a father to her daughters. While this all goes down, Charlotte falls in love with the local hunk, Joe, and then feels guilty for her actions with him. Things start to get even more intense in the last thirty moments or so of the movie, when Charlotte risks Kate's life to be with Joe. It is here when the movie reaches climax and the lessons start to be learned.No material is really broken and this movie really does not set a new standard when it comes to romantic comedies or dramas. It is just okay, nothing more or less. No big laughs but a few consistent ones throughout. While I would not *highly* recommend watching this movie, if you do run across it at a cheap price or for free, you might as well give it a chance if there is not anything better. It is a cute movie and stars Cher and Winona Ryder, and I mean, who does not love Cher and Winona? They are so adorable and it is fun to see them on screen together.",3,I thought it was adorable!,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,1697,"['Mermaids', 'not', 'classic', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'go', 'quickly', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'essentially', 'mother', 'daughter', 'movie', 'Think', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'emotional', 'place', '1960', 'movie', 'lot', 'old', 'music', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'cute', 'movie', 'Charlotte', '15', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'become', 'nun', 'Rachel', 'wild', 'mother', 'who', 'fool', 'men', 'Kate', 'younger', 'sister', 'breaking', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'Rachel', 'move', 'family', 'somewhere', 'else', 'always', 'what', 'did', 'previous', 'situations', 'too', 'town', 'Rachel', 'love', 'once', 'again', 'dorky', 'Lou', 'experience', 'problems', 'wanting', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'father', 'daughters', 'down', 'Charlotte', 'love', 'local', 'hunk', 'Joe', 'then', 'feels', 'guilty', 'actions', 'Things', 'start', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'intense', 'last', 'thirty', 'moments', 'so', 'movie', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'Kate', 'life', 'be', 'Joe', 'here', 'when', 'movie', 'climax', 'lessons', 'start', 'be', 'learned.No', 'material', 'really', 'broken', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'set', 'new', 'standard', 'when', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'just', 'okay', 'nothing', 'more', 'less', 'big', 'laughs', 'few', 'consistent', 'ones', 'would', 'not', '*highly*', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'do', 'run', 'cheap', 'price', 'free', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'chance', 'not', 'anything', 'better', 'cute', 'movie', 'Cher', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'mean', 'who', 'not', 'love', 'Cher', 'Winona', 'are', 'so', 'adorable', 'fun', 'see', 'screen', 'together']",N/A
148817,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,0792842405,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","This is a great movie filled with likable characters, good acting and wonderful setting. Mermaids revolves around a single mom, Mrs Flax [played by Cher] who has the tendency to uproot her two daughters and move whenever the going gets tough. They end up in a town on the east coast and settle into a rather unconventional lifestyle, for Mrs Flax is quite an eccentric and quirky character, whose volatile relationship with her oldest daughter, Charlotte [well-acted by Winona Ryder] makes for great viewing [their on-screen chemistry as sparring mother & daughter is very believable]. Charlotte is passionate about Christ, and fantasises about a career as a nun, a bit odd since the Flax's are Jewish! The younger daughter Kate is played by an adorable Christina Ricci, who is a talented swimmer, and has her share of quirks too.Bob Hoskins plays Lou, the small-town shoe store owner who lusts after Mrs Flax...though both Lou and Mrs Flax hardly seem compatible, both physically and in terms of personality, Cher and Hoskins make it work, and they share great chemistry on-screen.The time setting for this movie is the 60s, and the sets and costumes are wonderful and authentic, reflective of the time period. An important historical event such as JFK's assassination is handled with sensitivity and decorum.The only grouse I have with this DVD release is the lack of any special features. Otherwise, this is a movie that will warm your heart, and make you laugh.",5,Charming movie about mother-daughter relationship,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,1465,"['great', 'movie', 'filled', 'likable', 'characters', 'good', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'setting', 'Mermaids', 'single', 'mom', 'Mrs', 'Flax', '[', 'played', 'Cher', ']', 'who', 'tendency', 'uproot', 'two', 'daughters', 'move', 'whenever', 'going', 'tough', 'end', 'up', 'town', 'east', 'coast', 'settle', 'rather', 'unconventional', 'lifestyle', 'Mrs', 'Flax', 'quite', 'eccentric', 'quirky', 'character', 'volatile', 'relationship', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Charlotte', '[', 'well-acted', 'Winona', 'Ryder', ']', 'great', 'viewing', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'sparring', 'mother', 'daughter', 'very', 'believable', ']', 'Charlotte', 'passionate', 'Christ', 'career', 'nun', 'bit', 'odd', 'Flax', 'are', 'Jewish', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Kate', 'played', 'adorable', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'talented', 'swimmer', 'share', 'quirks', 'too.Bob', 'Hoskins', 'plays', 'Lou', 'small-town', 'shoe', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'Mrs', 'Flax', 'Lou', 'Mrs', 'Flax', 'hardly', 'seem', 'compatible', 'physically', 'terms', 'personality', 'Cher', 'Hoskins', 'make', 'work', 'share', 'great', 'chemistry', 'on-screen.The', 'time', 'setting', 'movie', '60s', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'authentic', 'reflective', 'time', 'period', 'important', 'historical', 'event', 'such', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'handled', 'sensitivity', 'decorum.The', 'only', 'grouse', 'have', 'DVD', 'release', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'will', 'warm', 'heart', 'make', 'laugh']",N/A
