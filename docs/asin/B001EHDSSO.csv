1185830,A2A8ISLILUT82W,B001EHDSSO,"Srinivas Chavala ""Srinivas Chavala""","[1, 6]","Emma Roberts came along way from Addie Singer, the young student who wants to be a singer in Unfabulous and became a movie star.  Emma Roberts is an excellent actress, she has a long way to go, she's taking on serious movies.  If Emma wanted to get out of her nice girl image in Nickelodean to serious actress the movie twelve will be the one to do that.  Emma Roberts has the greatest resemblance of Shenae Grimes from 90210 and Avril Lavigne.  I don't know what guy she'll end up with when she's an adult, but I know what the character Addie Singer would want Emma Roberts would want for a guy that she wants to marry.  Perfect, the guy has to have a perfect job, perfect education, the perfect body, he has to be tough and rugged and has to do everything right perfectly.  I don't know if that's this is the guy Emma wants, but the character Addie Singer would know what Emma Roberts want in a guy, the guy has to be perfect.",5,who is emma roberts?,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,928,"['Emma', 'Roberts', 'came', 'along', 'way', 'Addie', 'Singer', 'young', 'student', 'who', 'be', 'singer', 'Unfabulous', 'became', 'movie', 'star', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'excellent', 'actress', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'taking', 'serious', 'movies', 'Emma', 'wanted', 'get', 'nice', 'girl', 'image', 'Nickelodean', 'serious', 'movie', 'twelve', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'do', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'greatest', 'resemblance', 'Shenae', 'Grimes', '90210', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'when', 'adult', 'know', 'what', 'character', 'Addie', 'Singer', 'would', 'want', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'would', 'want', 'guy', 'marry', 'Perfect', 'guy', 'have', 'perfect', 'job', 'perfect', 'education', 'perfect', 'body', 'be', 'tough', 'rugged', 'do', 'everything', 'right', 'perfectly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guy', 'Emma', 'character', 'Addie', 'Singer', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'want', 'guy', 'guy', 'be', 'perfect']",N/A
