Roma Downey was so good in that television show on CBS that I was gutted when it was cancelled. So whenever I got a chance to catch up with her screen work I rarely pass up on it. She stars in The Sons of Mistletoe (2001).Sensible businesswoman Helen Radke (Roma Downey) was supposed to be in the town of Mistletoe for only a few months, time enough for her to assess and settle her father's corporate assets. She didn't want to know anyone or feel an obligation to anyone. She never saw Jimmy Adams (George Newbern) coming or the nagging imposition he embodies.Jimmy Adams is the director of the Mistletoe Home for Boys. This foster home is a shabby establishment, maybe too tattered to house these boys taken in from as many as five counties. This foster home was founded thirty years ago, in part thanks to the benevolence of Ms. Radke's late father. This movie opens during the holiday season, which is traditionally when Ms. Radke's father would have given a sizable monetary pledge. With him gone, Jimmy turns to the daughter for a measure of largesse. But she's unimpressed, is unmoved by his plea. She sizes up his rumpled wardrobe and likens his look to that of a pizza delivery boy. More, she tells him it's not sound business practice to depend on one sole benefactor. Jimmy counters with: ""You come from a long tradition of blatant generosity.""And yet Helen has a point. Jimmy had always leaned heavily on old Mr. Radke's donations to tide the foster home over. But Jimmy's cheerful persistence has this erosive effect on Helen; it eventually wears down her resistance. I described Helen Radke as a ""sensible businesswoman,"" not a cold-hearted one. What Helen hasn't told Jimmy or anyone else in Mistletoe is that she's just sold the entirety of her father's business empire to a group of New York investors. There go the Radke Department Store, there go the Mistletoe Home for Boys.3.5 out of 5 stars. Add The Sons of Mistletoe to that pile of watchable holiday films. It's for the entire family. There's nothing offensive about it, other than that we're supposed to buy Doris Roberts as the town sheriff. I remember George Newbern primarily from theFather of the Bride 1 & 2films. Here, he gets to show more of a personality.But I came here to eyeball Roma Downey who in this film is, for whatever reason (a reason that works), a blonde. I think it's neat that, here and there, she slips up on her American accent and a bit of the Irish comes out. If the script had intended her character to be this calculating, mercenary creature, Downey failed miserably. As usual, she keeps it low key. The sense I get from how she plays her role is that Helen Radke is guarded and conflicted rather than mean-spirited. As we learn in time, part of the conflict roots from her separation from her father. It's what truly imperils the foster home. But, in true keeping with the holiday spirit, there isn't an obstacle too insurmountable, no catastrophic child beyond salvaging (and, yes, some of the foster kids are a handful), no hardened heart beyond thawing. And what's this? A Christmas miracle staged in the final act of a holiday movie? Why, it's as if Jimmy Adams, at the end of his rope, was - sorry, I have to say it - touched by an angel.",4,"""Hey, there she is!
