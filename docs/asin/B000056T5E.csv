570751,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B000056T5E,Ace-of-Stars,"[0, 1]","*To be fair, ''BW2: Book of Shadows'' was really not such a bad film...I, like many others, went to the theatre to view this film primarily out of curiousity -- hoping to get sort of a ''different interpretation'' of the theme of the first film, rather than expecting a true sequel. Those who were actually expecting a genuine sequel of ''Project'' were in for a major disappointment.The film itself was not quite the bomber most people make it out to be. I believe that audiences in general were turned off, as was I, by the film makers' bashing us over the head trying to remind us constantly that this film was based on a much more intriguing original production, while, at the same time, focusing all too heavily on elements that tried to give this movie sort of its own identity. It doesn't work.The only way to make this film even somewhat of an enjoyable experience is to completely disassociate it from the original film and to simply view it as you would a ''fictional'' story written around ''historical'' characters or settings. Or, if that doesn't quite appeal to your sense of logic, try rationalizing it all by considering the possibility that our group of ''witch hunters'' must have been eating some super-powerful wild mushrooms during their hike through the forrest or that they were experiencing a sort of collective hallucinatory madness resulting from their abuse of chemical substances.Perhaps if the makers of ''BW2'' had named their movie something along the lines of ''Hunt for the Blair Witch'' or ''Burkittsville'' and had just used any references to the ''Blair Witch Project'' simply as the motivational sub-plot of the film without trying to establish the existence of an actual Blair Witch and without attempting to tie the two films together, then it just MAY have gained wider acceptance. As it stands now, however, ''BW2'' does more to alienate those who have very high regard for ''Project.''It can still be an enjoyable film to watch, depending on how you best want to ''interpret'' it.If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest renting it first, then (if you're also familiar with the ''first'' film) play around with the different ''possibilities'' as to how this film could/should or Not ''fit'' into the ''Blair Witch'' continuity.*",3,B-Fair-2 ''Blair-2'',1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2267,"['*To', 'be', 'fair', 'BW2', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'was', 'really', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'film', 'many', 'others', 'went', 'theatre', 'view', 'film', 'primarily', 'curiousity', 'hoping', 'get', 'sort', 'different', 'interpretation', 'theme', 'first', 'film', 'rather', 'expecting', 'true', 'sequel', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'expecting', 'genuine', 'sequel', 'Project', 'were', 'major', 'disappointment.The', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'bomber', 'most', 'people', 'make', 'be', 'believe', 'audiences', 'general', 'were', 'turned', 'off', 'was', 'film', 'makers', 'bashing', 'head', 'trying', 'remind', 'constantly', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'much', 'more', 'intriguing', 'original', 'production', 'same', 'time', 'focusing', 'too', 'heavily', 'elements', 'tried', 'give', 'movie', 'sort', 'own', 'identity', ""n't"", 'work.The', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'film', 'even', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'completely', 'disassociate', 'original', 'film', 'simply', 'view', 'would', 'fictional', 'story', 'written', 'historical', 'characters', 'settings', ""n't"", 'quite', 'appeal', 'sense', 'logic', 'try', 'rationalizing', 'considering', 'possibility', 'group', 'witch', 'hunters', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'eating', 'super-powerful', 'wild', 'mushrooms', 'hike', 'forrest', 'were', 'experiencing', 'sort', 'collective', 'hallucinatory', 'madness', 'resulting', 'abuse', 'chemical', 'substances.Perhaps', 'makers', 'BW2', 'had', 'named', 'movie', 'something', 'lines', 'Hunt', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Burkittsville', 'had', 'just', 'used', 'references', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'simply', 'motivational', 'sub-plot', 'film', 'trying', 'establish', 'existence', 'actual', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'attempting', 'tie', 'two', 'films', 'together', 'then', 'just', 'MAY', 'have', 'gained', 'wider', 'acceptance', 'now', 'however', 'BW2', 'more', 'alienate', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'regard', 'Project', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'watch', 'depending', 'how', 'best', 'want', 'interpret', 'it.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'suggest', 'renting', 'first', 'then', ""'re"", 'also', 'familiar', 'first', 'film', 'play', 'different', 'possibilities', 'how', 'film', 'could/should', 'Not', 'fit', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'continuity', '*']",N/A

If the movie desrves one, or if a sequel doesn't even make sense, is of little importance. There is more money to be made. If ever there was a sequel that had no basis for being, and was a quick cash in on an incredibly successful first entry, it would be BW 2: Book Of Shadows. When the small, independent ""Blair Witch Project"" was released in 1999 and created a worldwide phenomenon, not to mention mega green at the box office, there was little doubt that we had not seen the last of the 'ol Witch. Released in 2000, and directed by acclaimed documentary filmmaker Joe Berlinger(who also co-wrote the almost transparent script), BW 2 pretty much sucked any of the integrity, scares, and terror the oringal(which I really liked)created. One reviewer below says that it's not ""cool just to trash this film"". Well, that's a comment better suited to the original film with it's tremendous backlash instead of this one. This one is getting such harsh reviews because people see how really bad it is. So, what we get is a hollow piece of film that has the distinction of being one of the most humanless and fright-less follow ups to a truly terrifying and original first movie. It didn't start out that way. The movie began pretty promisingly, actually. With it's video camera taped material in the beginning of the town of Burkitsville and it's locals(reminiscent of the original), and it's look at the pop culture phenomenon of the orginal movie(now seen as a movie in this one)with appearances by Jay Leno, Conan 'O' Brien, Andy Richter, and MTV's Kurt Loder, the film seemed like it could be a pretty cool, fun, and self irreverant look at the first film. Sadly, after these few opening minutes, the promise slipped to the bottom of the barrel and all hope was lost. The film then turns away from the documentary aspect, and goes back to a traditional looking film. We have tour guide Jeffrey, played by Jeffrey Donovan, an unstable soul who we learn was previously in a hospital, who takes four young college kids into the woods for a tour of the haunted woods. Most of these kids are a listless bunch with no real quality to them that would make you care if they lived or died. There is Tristen(Tristine Skyler), a pretty blonde having baby issues with her boyfriend Stephen(Stephen Barker Turner, a guy who at times with certain angles seemed like he could be a brother to Ralph Fiennes. Am I the only one who saw that?), a laid back type with what looks to be a nice sized goiter on the side of his neck. Then there is wicca Erica(Erica Leershen), and the movie's one saving grace, goth girl Kim(played by Kim Director), who is undeniably appealing and watchable. The only one in the movie to achieve such a fete. And yes, they are playing characters with their real names. The group falls asleep in the woods, and when they wake up, they can't recant the last five hours. And when they do wake-up, their equipment is demolished and papers are shredded, etc. What did they conjure up?. The movie looks pretty good, is shot well, and is mostly decently acted(except for the scene chewing actor who plays the sheriff), but the movie still fails because there is nothing here. It ends up as being nothing but hot air. The moodiness, eeriness, and all around psychological creep fest of the original film is nowhere to be found here. It's basically a handful of non relatable characters locked up in an abandoned broom factory while they slowly start to unravel at the hinges, and tries to be scary with images and scenes that don't have a scare in them. The orignal created true terror and fear, and this movie throws cliches up there and seems to think, ""Gee, a weird looking little girl, ghost kids in the street, isn't this neat and creepy?"". Scared yet?. Didn't think so. What is going on?. Is the witch after them?. What are these weird symbols appearing on their bodies?. Do you care?. No. It's all a bunch of hocum that does not ring out any thrills, chills, or fears. While the original implied most of it and made the viewer creep itself out in their own heads, this film never really asks much thinking from it's viewers. It doesn't even deliver the goods in the good 'ol fashion way. The only scary thing about this film was that the makers actually thought this would be a fitting follow up to the orginal.

570761,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000056T5E,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","As everyone is well aware by now, the original Blair Witch Project is completely different from the sequel.  I personally hated the original Blair Witch Project.  Though groundbreaking in the horror genre back in 1999, I felt it was absolutely  *brutal* to watch.  It was basically 3 teenagers walking through the woods with a video camera and constantly yelling and swearing at each other as they get lost and go around in circles.  That's boring to me.  There's nothing scary about such a thing (not to mention the entire concept concerning a legendary evil witch stopped being the main storyline point after the first 20 minutes and instead focused on the teens trying to find their car because they couldn't stand the eerie setting or the nightly animal sounds in the distance) and the ending is a laughable attempt at a frightening cliffhanger.Besides, I only live 20 minutes north of Maryland where the witch supposedly did her horrible deeds so I'm totally used to these particular type of woods and the creepiness that such a setting presents.  I guess city folks wouldn't be used to it however, so this film might startle them.  Me?  Not a chance.Anyway, the sequel removes ALL of those terrible ideas.  The most notable improvement is that there's actual writers and an actual *storyline* in Book of Shadows.  Yes my friends, this is what the first movie needed *desperately* (original or not- walking through the woods in a rainy setting with a video camera made for downright pathetically dull and awkward ""movie"" watching for me).  Book of Shadows focuses on a group of teenagers who go searching for clues pertaining to the witch, however there's actual suspense, direction, character development and writing involved so it actually GOES somewhere.I loved it.  It starts off rather clumsy with a distinct low budget feel thanks to the generic introduction and heavy metal music, but please stay tuned as it DOES improve quite a bit after about 10 minutes.  When the teens fall asleep in the woods, they wake up under EXTREMELY mysterious circumstances.  It's soon discovered (through spooky video tapes supplying the evidence) that while asleep in the middle of the night, a huge chunk of time unexplainably passed by and no one can figure out how it happened.  It's at this point when the suspense factor increases significantly.Each of the 5 characters are far from generic- they each have their own identity that enables them to stand apart from the other ones, and they all play a part in the fascinating storyline development.  A major improvement compared to the 3 kids in the original Blair Witch Project who could have easily been replaced by anyone and it wouldn't have made a difference at all.There's many different surprises that come and go throughout Book of Shadows, and most of them pertain to the video tapes.  Without spoiling the ending, things aren't quite what they appear.  You'll be wondering why the segments keep shooting back and forth from the building the teens are staying in to the investigation rooms in the police station.  There *is* a well put together explanation.You'll love the ending.  A lot of the focus centers around this one building and the dangerous walkway leading to it.  A lot of activity happens here that leads to the teens constantly questioning each others actions and memories.  Nobody is quite sure what's going on- lots of confusion on their part (not ours, thankfully- it's an easy plotline to follow).  For those who love ghosts or a good mystery, expect to witness some pretty cool special effects in addition to some major surprises.Overall, a million times better than the first Blair Witch Project, Book of Shadows is clearly a winner in the horror genre.",5,much MUCH better,1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,3729,"['everyone', 'well', 'aware', 'now', 'original', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'completely', 'different', 'sequel', 'personally', 'hated', 'original', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'groundbreaking', 'horror', 'genre', 'back', '1999', 'felt', 'was', 'absolutely', '*brutal*', 'watch', 'was', 'basically', '3', 'teenagers', 'walking', 'woods', 'video', 'camera', 'constantly', 'yelling', 'swearing', 'other', 'get', 'lost', 'go', 'around', 'circles', 'boring', 'nothing', 'scary', 'thing', 'not', 'mention', 'entire', 'concept', 'concerning', 'legendary', 'evil', 'witch', 'stopped', 'being', 'main', 'storyline', 'point', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'instead', 'focused', 'teens', 'trying', 'find', 'car', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'eerie', 'setting', 'nightly', 'animal', 'sounds', 'distance', 'ending', 'laughable', 'attempt', 'frightening', 'cliffhanger.Besides', 'only', 'live', '20', 'minutes', 'north', 'Maryland', 'where', 'witch', 'supposedly', 'did', 'horrible', 'deeds', ""'m"", 'totally', 'used', 'particular', 'type', 'woods', 'creepiness', 'setting', 'presents', 'guess', 'city', 'folks', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', 'however', 'film', 'might', 'startle', 'Me', 'Not', 'chance.Anyway', 'sequel', 'ALL', 'terrible', 'ideas', 'most', 'notable', 'improvement', 'actual', 'writers', 'actual', '*storyline*', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'Yes', 'friends', 'what', 'first', 'movie', 'needed', '*desperately*', 'original', 'not-', 'walking', 'woods', 'rainy', 'setting', 'video', 'camera', 'made', 'downright', 'pathetically', 'dull', 'awkward', 'movie', 'watching', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'group', 'teenagers', 'who', 'go', 'searching', 'clues', 'pertaining', 'witch', 'however', 'actual', 'suspense', 'direction', 'character', 'development', 'writing', 'involved', 'actually', 'GOES', 'loved', 'rather', 'clumsy', 'distinct', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'thanks', 'generic', 'introduction', 'heavy', 'metal', 'music', 'please', 'stay', 'tuned', 'DOES', 'improve', 'quite', 'bit', '10', 'minutes', 'When', 'teens', 'fall', 'asleep', 'woods', 'wake', 'up', 'EXTREMELY', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'soon', 'discovered', 'spooky', 'video', 'tapes', 'supplying', 'evidence', 'asleep', 'middle', 'night', 'huge', 'chunk', 'time', 'unexplainably', 'passed', 'one', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'happened', 'point', 'when', 'suspense', 'factor', 'significantly.Each', '5', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'generic-', 'have', 'own', 'identity', 'stand', 'apart', 'other', 'ones', 'play', 'part', 'fascinating', 'storyline', 'development', 'major', 'improvement', 'compared', '3', 'kids', 'original', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'replaced', 'anyone', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'many', 'different', 'surprises', 'come', 'go', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'most', 'pertain', 'video', 'tapes', 'spoiling', 'ending', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'appear', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'segments', 'keep', 'shooting', 'back', 'forth', 'building', 'teens', 'are', 'staying', 'investigation', 'rooms', 'police', 'station', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'explanation.You', ""'ll"", 'love', 'ending', 'lot', 'focus', 'centers', 'one', 'building', 'dangerous', 'walkway', 'leading', 'lot', 'activity', 'here', 'teens', 'constantly', 'questioning', 'others', 'actions', 'memories', 'Nobody', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'on-', 'lots', 'confusion', 'part', 'not', 'ours', 'thankfully-', 'easy', 'plotline', 'follow', 'who', 'love', 'ghosts', 'good', 'mystery', 'expect', 'witness', 'pretty', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'addition', 'major', 'surprises.Overall', 'million', 'times', 'better', 'first', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'clearly', 'winner', 'horror', 'genre']",N/A

Since the first movie, groups of supernatural devotees make nocturnal visits the the Union Cemetery and the surrounding woods hunting for the victims who'd disappeared while recording the Blair Witch Project.  The mental patient makes a good living off stealing the property from these unsuspecting hikers; the factory is full of stuff he sells on EBay.  He accumulates the merchandise he offers by stashing most of it in his living quarters at the run down factory.  He claims he was locked up in the padded room of the mental hospital at the time the first group vanished, leaving behind the video tapes which he hid under a rock wall.The first account was wo swird it had to be a hoax.  No one just disapperars (except Jimmy Hoffa) never to be found.  The bodies of the group killed in the followup were discovered.  The actors including Tristan Schyler moved in with this psycho and two of the girls were his victims in a ritualistic, drug-induced sex orgy.  The Elvira character, Kim Diamond, dressed all in black with black makeup like the devil worshippers who vamp East Town Mall and use the public computers to look at human sacrifices on the Internet.  She was responsible for the deaths of both girls, as she was involved in witchcraft and claimed to be possessed by Ellie.  The tapes tell the whole story of hysteria and false illusions, as the murders were brutal and the victims tortured in a Satanic manner -- all on tape.Finally, the police raid the factory and charge the mental patient and surviving video students from Montgomery College.  This is all wrong.  It was out-of-this-world (other-worldly) horrid in context and amateurish in the acting.  I did not look for the hidden images.

It does have a good idea, but the editing and story telling style just confuses and loses you. It might actually make those who hated the first appreciate it more.

The film opens on a high note, mocking the commercialization of the first film, and its more obsessed devotees. I thought that it was a very daring, clever move especially since we, the devotees of the first film, added to its great profit and success.Like many other recent flicks, this one leaves it upon you, the viewer to try to make sense of the events you are shown. And what bizarre things we do see-an owl crashes through the exfactory window, Trista turns around on her bed, the camera records events that none can remember...The characters in this film are all interesting, but not easy to understand. I especially liked the gothic type girl.Ultimately this fast paced film will leave you with more questions than answers, as you ponder the following: 1. The gothic/psychic girl has a momentary vision of Jeffrey in an electric chair-is he the reincarnation of the serial killer in the first film? 2. Is the Blair Witch even involved in the events that transpire? 3. Has Mass Hysteria indeed grasped the group? 4. Why does the group have no memory of those five hours? Pay Very close attention to the drunken scenes early in the film, and the possible hypothesis's served up. I think the key to drawing your own conclusions to this film lies there, if anywhere.Sure the film is gory, but luckily most of it is kind of dreamlike rather than in your face gore. I would highly recommend this film if you can appreciate a film for the artistic visual impact alone, and if your ok with drawing your own answers.

After the disappointing and comical ""Blair Witch Project"", Joe Berlinger adds his fascinating vision to the story of the Blair Witch.One of my biggest complaints about the original ""Blair Witch Project"", was its originality.  I mean, who wants to see a group of ""nobody kids"" filming a documentary in the woods?  Not me!  The shaky camera work often left me wondering - what's going on, why can't I see the witch?  How am I supposed to be scared if I can't see what's going on.The ending left me completely baffled.  First, you see the guy standing in the corner, then the camera falls to the ground and the movie ends.  What happened?!  It would have been so much scarier if you could have actually seen the witch fly out on her broomstick and kill the kids.  Now, THAT would have been scary.Joe Berlinger knows what it takes to make a great movie, and he shows his mettle with the astonishing ""Books of Shadows - Blair Witch 2"".  What I love most about this movie, is how Berlinger completely ignores every aspect of the original.  Gone is the horrible acting and flawed story of the first movie.  This time we have interesting characters and a complex story that keeps you guessing, right until the end.  In fact, I'm still trying to figure out what happened!This movie is most appreciated when viewed in the ""DVD"" format.  For those of you that are not familiar with the ""DVD's"" - they serve the same purpose as the old VHS tapes, but ""DVD's"" are smaller and easier to store.

I'd been told that it was going to be an actual horror movie version of the Blair Witch tales & show some actual spooks & such. Being a fan of schlocky horror movies, I figured that I'd be guaranteed to at least enjoy myself. Being a realist however, I waited for it to come out on rental. Good choice on my part.The movie surrounds a group of young adults who all decide to go to the site of the Blair Witch movie (which apparently is real in their world). Once there, they are supposed to have all sorts of spooky things happen to them. If this synopsis sounds brief, that's because it's pretty much the entire plotline of the film. The movie's big flaw is that it tries to hard to cash in on the hype of the previous film & the overly cheesy special effects.As far as what's bad with this film, well... where should I start? You have the stereotypical horror cliches, boring dialogue, bad continuity (when did the BW get the money to build a bigger house?) & bad directing put this movie past the point where it could have been a good cheese flick. The movie crew seemed to be more interested in publicizing that it was a sequel than trying to establish the movie on it's own. If done right, the film could've been watchable.

It's been on TV quite a few times and I remember watching it when I rented it but watching it recently I was surprised by how little I remembered of it. Walking around at the store, I noticed one of those patented gift sets where you can buy a set containing all the movies about a certain subject or filmmaker or franchise and sure enough there was a double-pack containing both Blair Witch films, a CD-Rom and a stick-man necklace. I thought I'd just review 2 since I haven't done that yet and found that while it's not Battlefield Earth or House of the Dead bad, there's a huge chunk of ""missed opportunity syndrome"" running rampant.The original was a mock documentary that was advertised as the real deal. The sequel pretends it really did happen so we have 2 researchers (Tristan and Stephen), a goth chick (Kim) an unbelievably sexy Wicca (Erica) and a former mental patient/director (Jeff) who attend Jeff's tour of the famous sites. Only things, naturally, turn creepy and find everything totalled and hours missing. They go to Jeff's house where things get even more twisted and videotapes show lots of things that go bump in the night.Cheesy story description I know but seriously, how else can I do it? As director Joe Berlinger says in the booklet, it would've been silly to continue the story of Josh, Mike and Heather since they're on and about and doing movies and TV shows so instead they have a story that pretends the movie was real, hence stuff like ""man that movie was so cool, we really connected"" or the trailer line ""cause I thought the movie was cool"". The one problem with the film was that it just didn't feel scary or suspenseful. Sure the story was interesting and the premise but nothing seemed to match the tent scene, the ending or even Heather's apology in the original.The acting is kind of hit-or-miss. We get scene-stealing Kim Director who thankfully isn't that brooding ""I love goth stuff, woo goth!"" that I sometimes see and we get the unbelievably hot Erica Leerhsen who's also a talent to watch but then we get Lanny Flaherty who's ridiculously over-the-top or Stephen Barker Turner who almost tries too hard.

All that is left are the videocassettes, hidden under a rock.  They go back to one guy's house (he is a local) and decide to watch the videos to see what happened.What happens next is part of one of the best genre films I have seen, and certainly one of the best horror sequels.  The acting is solid, and the discoveries are made in a well-done manner.  Very scary and surreal.  Even the discovery of who was in charge was done slowly and subtly.  I was surprised by every twist and turn and the director should be commended for making what could have been a simple slice-and-dice into a thought-provoking, well-written, scary film.One realizes at the end that the entire film is a commentary on the first one and the public's response to it.

I can only hope that few other people have had the misfortune of seeing this celluloid monstrosity twice.  One is hard pressed to say which is worse-the overdramatic acting or the hopeless script.  The promos promised to take us back into the woods, but we spend almost the whole movie knocking around an old abandoned warehouse converted into a home by the local psycho.  The four people making up the Blair Witch tour group are possibly even more annoying than the guide-a spooky-looking Goth girl with an attitude, a disbelieving writer and his seriously disturbed, recently impregnated girlfriend, and a hot redheaded Wiccan whose nude scenes are the only positive contribution any one makes to this film.  Then there is the constantly fuming Sheriff Craven yelling and cursing all the time, adding even more misery to the experience of the viewer.  The frequent time shifts between past and present serve only to make a nonsensical plot completely incomprehensible.  Don't count on a big finish; this thing just ends suddenly, as if the filmmakers ran out of money and had to shut down production all of a sudden.This DVD does feature a bunch of special features, but so did the Titanic, and we all know how that journey turned out.  The most important thing to keep in mind about this film is the fact that, despite its promises, it really has nothing to do with the Blair Witch.  Oh, they talk about her and show us Coffin Rock and the foundation of Parr's house and a few ghostly images of children, but The Book of Shadows does little more than parody everything that was so fascinating and innovative about the Blair Witch Project.

Reilly,"[2, 2]","I've been badmouthing this film since I saw it on the opening day of it's original theatrical run, and to tell you the truth, I hated it so much that if I didn't get it bundled together with the DVD of Blair Witch Project, I never would have watched it again. I'm sort of glad I did give it a second look, though. I think I've been somewhat unfair...Judged on it's own, setting aside preconceived notions and expectations of what a sequel SHOULD be, Book of Shadows ain't half bad. Certainly it was badly received, and killed off a potentially HUGE franchise, but the story it presents certainly is original. Rather than send another bunch of college students into the woods in search of either the Witch or the missing filmmakers from the original, we are presented with a group of 5 diverse people who are all obsessed with the FILM. Yup, rather than a straight sequel, Book of Shadows takes place in the ""Real"" world, where Blair Witch is just a movie.....The five go on a ""Blair Witch Hunt"" tour, staying in the ruins of killer Rustin Parr's house, and sometime during the night, their camera equipment is destroyed, and they can't account for a few hours of missing time. They DO find their videotapes, however, and return to their tour-guide's home to go over the tapes and see just what happened during those lost hours...Book of Shadows plays with the character's (And the viewer's) perceptions of what is and isn't real; Are these people really being persecuted by a malignant force, or has their belief in the power of the Blair Witch mythology driven them insane? Perhaps their belief has made the myth real...?The movie's style is miles apart from the original, opting for gruesome close-up's of knives going into stomachs, loud, mood-killing Marilyn Manson music, and often ham-handed dialogue, but for all that, it remains an intriguing story. Certainly anyone who loves horror movies has seen worse. I think Book of Shadows just couldn't win either way. If they hewed too closely to the original, it would have been dismissed as a rip-off. As it is, Director Joe Berlinger was castigated for straying too far....The DVD is interesting because it is half DVD, half CD, with the CD side featuring a few rock songs from the soundtrack, and Carter Burwell's entire score, which is EXCELLENT. The DVD side features commentary by the Director, a Godhead music video, a hidden theatrical trailer, huge cast & crew bios and filmographies, hidden clues to decipher the Witch's runes, ""The Secret of Esrever"" featurette, which is kinda cool, and a lot of fun easter eggs.

570780,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B000056T5E,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[3, 6]","I didn't know what to expect from the widely ridiculed ""Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows"", so I killed the lights and popped it into the DVD hopper while the wind howled outside and the trees scratched against the windows.Guess what? I was hugely entertained: ""Book of Shadows"" creeps and crawls and scratches on the windows, and it's a juicy, nasty, truly unsettling little horror film on its own terms. If you like, you need read no farther: just go rent this tasty little nugget of grue and give it a look.Still here? Great: I've got something that has been bothering me for years, and I've got to get it off my chest. Are all the Blair Witch Project groupies out of the room?Whew. Alright---I believe that many of the folks who made the groundbreaking and genuinely shivery ""Blair Witch Project"" a massive blockbuster hit were people who don't usually like horror movies. To them, the first ""Blair Witch Project"" wasn't a wallow in the horror-genre mud, it was more akin to an indie film: student filmmakers get lost in the Maryland woods, lots of shaky, dizzying camcorder shots, naturalistic dialogue, and tons of ambiguity. Was ""Blair Witch Project"" genuinely creepy-crawly unsettling, in a kind of ""There was an Old Woman who lived by the Cemetery"" way?Absolutely it was. But was it a full-blooded horror film? Decidedly not. And many---not all, but quite a few---of its fans would never have been caught dead or undead watching one of Blair's country cousins of the Horror genre: no ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Evil Dead"" for them, thank you. So when documentarian Joe Berlinger's little nugget of unadulterated spooky grue came out and didn't offer more of the same subtle spookhouse art, it was doomed by these 'fans' from the start.Consequently ""Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows"" was savaged and reviled, and as a result it took me about a year before I caught up with it on DVD. Imagine my surprise: far from the cobbled together trainwreck I was expecting, ""Blair Witch 2"" is an intelligent, superbly edited, competently acted little locomotive of a horror film in its own right, and Berlinger very properly hones in on the hype that resulted from the first movie and makes it his own.Berlinger takes up where the first film left off: in the wake of the discovery of the three doomed filmmaker's canisters buried beneath a derelict house in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, the Blair Witch has become a pop culture phenomenon, and a media circus and an army of the curious has descended on the little Maryland town. Jeff Patterson (played to a wild-eyed and fickle hilt by Jeffrey Donovan) is a local entrepreneur who heads up the ""Blair Witch Hunt"", conducting tours of the hills and haunts of the Witch and selling Blair Witch paraphernalia out of his house/factory, a 19th century broom factory (broom factory---get it? get it?).Patterson hooks up with four customers, all of whom want to go on the ""Blair Witch Hunt"": a young couple, a pretty pagan (played by Erica Leerhsen, who is the yummiest thing I've seen in horror movies---or anything else---in years), and a cynical Goth (also played tastily and effectively by Kim Director). The five traipse into the woods, Leerhsen naively performs a little ceremony at the ruins of old Rustin Parr's country house, the pack gives a rival group of German and Japanese tourists a hard time, and then everybody parties---perhaps a little too hardy.When the gang returns to the broom factory, Something Else follows them home. And though the Something Else is certainly not a cute little puppy, there's no question as to whether they can keep It.The rest of the film is a slick, hyper-kinetic, and often genuinely crawly descent into madness and horror, and for my money one of the finest little chunks of true terror cinema out there. The acting is competent, the effects are spot-on, and the atmosphere is never clear-cut---for the most part, the film manages to evoke a feeling of something unsettling going on just out of eyeshot, a palpable sense of wrongness. The sequence between Leerhsen and Stephen Parker (played phlegmatically by Stephen Turner, who eerily resembles a young Ralph Fiennes)---the one where they examine each other's 'rashes'---is one of the creepiest I've seen in years.Given all the hatred of ""Blair 2"", I'm not sure what fans of the first wanted: more shaky camera angles, and perhaps another pseudo-documentary? If you want that, go watch the original again. If you're up for some full-bore horror that hides under your bed and snatches your ankle with its grave-cold claw, then watch ""Book of Shadows"": just don't let your pet owl see it.JSG",4,"Hype,

The sad part is, it could have been so much better; and if director Joe Berlinger is to be believed, it would have been if it had remained under his control.  The story goes that he was pressured (read ""forced"") by the studio to add in scenes of gore and nudity that clashed with his vision in a misguided attempt to make the movie more profitable; I feel bad for the guy, but whatever the reason, the movie is just horrible, no two ways about it.  Blair Witch 2 retains little if any of the Blair Witch mythology of the original movie, and next to none of the suspense.  The one and only conceit that's even remotely clever, that of having the characters share their names with the actors who play them in an homage to the original, gets old really fast; unlike the first Blair Witch, where the actors were ad-libbing everything and therefore would want to use their real names to maintain the realism, the sequel is an obvious work of fiction, so what's the point?Which isn't to say that the movie is a complete loss.  The twist ending is clever, or at least it would have been in a different movie; the score isn't half bad, aside from the Marilyn Manson song at the very beginning (""Disposable Teens"" might make sense in this context, except all of the actors are obviously at least 20 years old), and the goth chick is fairly entertaining.  There's even a few in-jokes about the original film here and there.  Unfortunately, if you combined all of these things into a movie in their own right, you'd end up with an eight-minute-long film.I've read that Mr. Berlinger had never directed a feature film before, and has vowed to never attempt it again.  Can't say I blame him.  Unless you're a die-hard completist or you're feeling particularly guilty about something and looking for a way to flagellate yourself cinematically, avoid this movie in any way that you can.The DVD has a few extras, notably a mini-feature explaining the concept or ""Esrever.""  (It's ""Reverse"" backwards.  Get it?  Now that you got it, do you really want it?  Didn't think so.)  It's a little hazy, but the idea is that every so often, something about what's on screen--usually something in the background--will change in some subtle way, and the viewer is supposed to spot these and be consumed by the warm fuzzies at their own cleverness, I guess.  Since none of them have any real bearing on the plot, there's not much point except to kill an afternoon.",2,I feel guilty about saying this...,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,2481,"['Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'atrocious', 'movie', 'sad', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'director', 'Joe', 'Berlinger', 'be', 'believed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'remained', 'control', 'story', 'was', 'pressured', 'read', 'forced', 'studio', 'add', 'scenes', 'gore', 'nudity', 'clashed', 'vision', 'misguided', 'attempt', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'profitable', 'feel', 'bad', 'guy', 'reason', 'movie', 'just', 'horrible', 'two', 'ways', 'Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'little', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'mythology', 'original', 'movie', 'next', 'none', 'suspense', 'one', 'only', 'conceit', 'even', 'remotely', 'clever', 'having', 'characters', 'share', 'names', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'homage', 'original', 'old', 'really', 'fast', 'first', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'where', 'actors', 'were', 'ad-libbing', 'everything', 'therefore', 'would', 'want', 'use', 'real', 'names', 'maintain', 'realism', 'sequel', 'obvious', 'work', 'fiction', 'what', 'point', 'Which', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'complete', 'loss', 'twist', 'ending', 'clever', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'movie', 'score', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'aside', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'song', 'very', 'beginning', 'Disposable', 'Teens', 'might', 'make', 'sense', 'context', 'actors', 'are', 'obviously', 'least', '20', 'years', 'old', 'goth', 'chick', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'even', 'few', 'in-jokes', 'original', 'film', 'here', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'combined', 'things', 'movie', 'own', 'right', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'eight-minute-long', 'film.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Mr.', 'Berlinger', 'had', 'never', 'directed', 'feature', 'film', 'vowed', 'never', 'attempt', 'again', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'blame', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'completist', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'particularly', 'guilty', 'something', 'looking', 'way', 'flagellate', 'cinematically', 'avoid', 'movie', 'way', 'can.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'notably', 'mini-feature', 'explaining', 'concept', 'Esrever', 'Reverse', 'backwards', 'Get', 'Now', 'got', 'do', 'really', 'want', 'Did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'little', 'hazy', 'idea', 'so', 'often', 'something', 'what', 'screen', 'usually', 'something', 'background', 'will', 'change', 'subtle', 'way', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'spot', 'be', 'consumed', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'own', 'cleverness', 'guess', 'none', 'have', 'real', 'bearing', 'plot', 'not', 'much', 'point', 'kill', 'afternoon']",N/A

It seemed as though the writers and director went for the whole ""watch the movie and draw your own conclusions about what was really happened"" angle,  like in the movie ""Total Recall.""  One conclusion would be that the group had fed off of each other's obsessions with the ""legend,"" and some sort of mass hysteria caused them to commit murders which they later blocked out of their memory.  The other conclusion, of course, is that the Blair Witch possessed Tristen and manipulated the minds of the group and caused other supernatural stuff to happen.  The problem is that no matter which scenario you choose to accept as the explanation for what was really going on, the end result is still the same, a bad friggin' movie with...poor acting and characters you could [care] less about.  I mean really, the guy who plays the role of the detective has to be, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the worst actor in the United States of America, bar none!  He looked and sounded like he came right out of an episode of Scooby Doo or something.  And don't even get me started on Erica's character.  The only one who didn't completely overdue her role was Kim Director (and Kurt Loder).  I hope she's the only one to go on and have a career from this.  I thought the hidden images thing in the DVD was kind of tacky, but it did give the viewer something extra to do while watching the film (because god knows the acting's not going to hold your interest)as well as give it some replay value.  I didn't much care that it didn't have anything to do with the first Blair Witch movie, other than make reference to it as a movie.  In fact, I'm glad it didn't, because it would have tainted it by association.  I gave it 2 stars because I can see what they were trying to do with it, and if they had pulled it off it would have been a pretty darn good addition to the franchise.  But Sadly, poor dialogue and even worse acting ruined this objective.  I would rather have seen a movie about what happened to Ellie, set in the 18th century (or whatever century she supposedly lived) and then another sequel (or prequel) about Rustin Parr.

Here was this little indy movie, that made a ton of cash, was the water-cooler talk for the better part of a year, and was a truly unique film. Why try to top, or equal that? Of course, Hollywood saw a possible cash cow and a big studio jumped in and tainted the Blair Witch name. Now, I have to give the sequel credit in that it didn't just throw another group of kids into the woods and rehash the story from part one. The idea of Book of Shadows is actually a neat idea, but the execution of that idea was horrible. First of all, we are presented with such an annoying group of people to follow in Book of Shadows, I am immediately ready for the killing to begin. Seriously, I was praying Jason would come stumbling out of the woods with his hockey mask and machete to hasten the demise of this cast of characters that no one could relate to.

Anyone who thought that a sequel... ANY TYPE OF SEQUEL... to the 1999 blockbuster would be good should be checked into some kind of hospital somewhere and treated for chronic stupidity. 'Blair Witch' was the kind of film that could not be reproduced or followed-up. It was based on a concept that dictated against it. Any kind of follow-up would be unnecessary since all the damage was done in the first film. Had it not been sequelized, 'Blair Witch' would have gone down in history as a brilliant shot-in-the-dark. But leave it to Hollywood to ruin things. Here we have 'Book Of Shadows' a movie which not only hurts the good name of the first film but also does not feature a book of shadows. The film concerns a tour group lead into the Black Woods of Maryland in search of the Blair Witch. They encounter another tour group and a rather unconvincing fight ensues. When the morning comes they cannot recall what happened to them the night before. Their campsite is destroyed, camera smashed, paper strewn everywhere. They simply have no idea what happened to them. The rest of the film follows them as they try and piece together what happened to them by watching the footage from their cameras. It's an intriguing concept weighed down by stupid dialog and predictable characters (right down to the one psychic goth chick whose role in the film is simply to progress it when the writer gets stuck ie. 'What do we do?' GOTH CHICK: 'We have to watch the tapes in reverse'. 'How do you know?' GOTH CHICK: 'I just do'.). The performances in the film are all fair but only get real near the end. The last half-hour is strong stuff but by that time we just don't care anymore. We're waiting for something to happen along the way to wake us up. We miss the strategy, the dread, the innovative story-telling of the first film. Director/writer Joe Berlinger should know better. He is responsible for creating one of the best documentaries in recent memory, the brilliant 'Paradise Lost: The Child Murders At Robin Hood Hills' but to no avail (Berlinger finds room however to assert his views about the case explored in 'Paradise Lost' though... one character states 'Back where I come from people think you're a killer because you wear black'... nice plug Joe). This could have been interesting. It says something about violence in the media and explores obsession with urban legends. But the message (and plot) gets lost somewhere in the third reel. The DVD is nice, though, and contains a lot of the movie's soundtrack on one side of it. The only real extra is 'The Secret Of Eserver' which, when you watch it backwards, allows you to see things you could see if you watch the movie forwards anyway (???).

It had good atmosphere with natural sounds, it relied on what it doesn't show the audience to scare them, and it was nice touch that each camera are shot differently due to color and contrast; for better or worse, the faux-shockumentary had verisimilitude.  Bad news comes to play when the people who were not involved in the first movie and made a sequel that went completely in the wrong direction. ""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2"" is a mockery existence to the overall premise.Fairly enough, this sequel was off to a interesting start.  It showed a montage of actual clips based on MTV, late night shows, and critics praising about the first project, and afterwards showed a town that the film was apparently shot in that's backing in its success, with the locals chatting about how much attention they had.  As fake as the latter may be, the sequel could've worked from that: a faux-documentary displaying the aftermath of ""Blair Witch Project"" and the people's doubts of its authenticity until similarly strange occurrences happen to some of them; it would maintain its verisimilitude to a somewhat-creative direction.  But instead, it ignored all of its prior elements to make a boilerplate theatrical reenactment; aka 'based on real events', the same purported schlock that ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" pulled.The 'real' story was about a gang on a road trip to see the site of the Blair Witch, the leader being that guy from ""Burn Notice"".  The fool around at the site, making jokes, doing what stereotypes in horror films usually do when nothing scary happens and this is a mix of the '90s variety: the goth chick, the punk rebel, the concerned girl, the serious guy, and the Wiccan in lieu of the token black character but she follows the same pattern (""it's because I'm a Wiccan, right?""); the only thing is missing is the jock.  All's well and stupid during a drug/alcohol binge, until the next day weird stuff and mysterious forces are messing with their heads.Right then and there, the sequel followed the post-""Scream"", pre-remake attitude of horror (and noneof themwere good): frequent heavy metal/hardcore punk songs blasting on the soundtrack, edgy brooding emos and goths, and characters referencing existing movies and calling out on the fakeness of their situations.  ""Book of Shadows"" follows the typical formula to an incongruous degree, given that it demanded authenticity.  Actually, it didn't even follow the typical scare factors, the film relied heavily on psychological torture like abrasive violent clips that pop up on occasion.  The effect was interesting at first, but it's used so much that it got old; I don't even see the point of those outside of tomfoolery.  There's too little action to have any genuine scares, and it's too random and show-offy for it to be effective psychological horror; it didn't work on both sides.I was annoyed at how irrational the cast are, and how vague and undermined the story is (why is the goth chick clairvoyant and how come certain 'live footages' have cuts to certain angles?); for all I know that's happening in this movie, the drugs and alcohol they used drove them crazy.  Since the term ""Book of Shadows"" is more of a marketing subject since it was never mentioned in the film, and it's connections to the Blair Witch happened in intervals so the sequel is largely self-contained, the movie might as well be called ""Generic Late '90s Horror no.10-10-321"".

570792,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B000056T5E,D. Litton,"[1, 2]","&quot;Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2&quot; is a seriously confusing sequel to a movie that many have considered to set a new standard in horror filmmaking (notice I said many, and not myself). The images are grizzly and disturbing, the acting has mere moments of believability, and the body plot falls short of being climactic enough for its surprisingly satisfying ending. This movie is basic eye candy for those who could not stomach the documentary-style filming of the first film, and on that premise, it works quite well.I admired the first few minutes of the film, which plays on the predecessor's fame and how it gave people the initiative to explore the woods for themselves. We see newscasts, critics, and nighttime talk shows about the success of &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; which then segues into interviews of various Burketsville residents telling stories of how the town has become enamored with fans seeking out the site of the events of the film. The comedy in this is that &quot;Blair Witch 2&quot; portrays the events of the first film as being real, and believe it or not, the opening scenes are believable in this aspect.Which leads us into our plot, as a group of &quot;Blair Witch&quot; buffs journey into the woods to discover its secrets once again. The group is full of contrasting characters: there's Kim, the all-out Goth who seems to have insight into everything that happens, grad students Tristen and Stephen, who are on the hike to gather information for a book on the subject, Erica, the Wiccan witch who believes in all things nature-related, and Jeff, the tour guide who has capitalized immensely on the fame of the witch tale and the movie's fame. As they set up camp the first night, they become drunk and disoriented, until they are set upon by another tour group who opts to venture to Coffin Rock, the place where the first murders took place many years ago.Our group wakes up the next morning to shreds of paper falling from the sky, the destroyed work of the grad students, as well as finding that their cameras have been destroyed and the tapes hidden in exactly the same spot that the documentary was hidden. They all start pointing fingers until Tristen experiences a miscarriage, at which point she is rushed to the hospital. No one can remember the events of that night, nor do they know when they blacked out or why, which makes the shreds of paper and destroyed cameras quite mysterious. Retreating to Jeff's home, an abandoned broom factory where he creates his &quot;Blair Witch&quot; merchandise, they begin reviewing the tapes to try and figure out what happened, all the while experiencing grotesque images that leave them questioning what is reality and what is fantasy.There is a strong undercurrent of suspense that never really is resolved in this film, accompanied by one-second shocks and jumps that do provide a few thrills. But the plot never really lives up to that suspense, going from one mind-trip to another without allowing us to figure out the fine line between reality and delusion. Just when we think something major is about to happen, it is overpowered by hackneyed twists, ranging from the ramblings of the gone-mad Tristen to the arguing and pointing of fingers at the rest of the characters. What one sees, the others cannot, and while some of this is intense, the overall feel is one of confusion and incoherence.The film does have a bizarre array of gory images and suspenseful moments, though, which will please some horror buffs. Throughout the movie, the members of the group are haunted by images of bloody lust, death, ghostly apparitions and scenes of murder and mutilation. These scenes, while being extremely graphic, are not that hard to look at, and cinematography makes it easier on the eyes. These shots are done in nice, quick cuts to sharp turns on the soundtrack, taking on red hues and moving slower than normal. Some will argue that this is why the film loses its luster as a sequel to the first movie, because of the filming technique and the fact that they trade mystery for the gore and bloodletting. But instead of giving us a few noises in the night and three people running around in the woods screaming, this movie gives us everything in a stylish package.The fact that we never know why they are experiencing these visions and events is also quite nice, and does add some mystery to the picture. There are hints dropped in everyone's laps that lay blame on them, and then those hints are tossed out the window to give way to new hints, and so on. This may seem a bit redundant, but it does build nicely to the ending, which is mutely chilling and disturbing. It all makes you wonder about what has happened during this movie, which can be either satisfying or a let-down. I found that it did add a bit of mystery to the overall movie, while shocking us at certain, if few, moments.The acting leaves a little to be desired, though. The actors, Jeffrey Donovan, Erica Leerhsen, Tristen Skyler, Stephen Barker Turner, Kim Director, have their moments, but never make it in fully making the material come to life. Skyler's performance is lacking in scenes where she seems to be bordering on mass hysteria, where Leerhsen and Director try to make their characters appear frightened and fail. Turner does a good job playing out his role, while Donovan has nowhere to go but down. His character had been in an asylum prior to these events, which is probably why he has no emotional depth or feeling.On the basis of visuals that possess a certain intensity, &quot;Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2&quot; works. It gives us a non-stop parade of nightmarish dreamscapes and gruesome images that areas haunting as the subject matter. But the overall plot falls short, unable to live up to the ending or the ideas of the first film. In closing, this movie looks like it was made to satisfy non-fans of the original, and it does surprisingly well in achieving this.",3,"Visually interesting, lacking in acting and plot.",985737600,"03

My judgment is no doubt affected by that.Putting that aside, to the best of my ability, (I raised my rating by one level  to counteract my irritation), the movie might have taken off from the central plot idea (if the witch angle had been dropped), by emphasizing that fantasy can be manifest in behavior if repression of self-control mechanisms was accomplished by drugs (hypnosis or other mechanisms). That would not have been a new theme but it would have created a sensible film. Contrariwise, if the emphasis on external agencies of witchcraft had taken central place, then a good  case could be made for the transformations of behavior due to the influence of the Devil and other agents of Evil. That, too, is not a new theme, but there's still a lot of mileage left in it, when properly written.Whatever, the reasons, we had a garbage pail full of different themes which promoted only confusion, indifference, and a failed movie.

So what happened when Hollywood got its hands on it? ""Let's make a metafictional movie ABOUT the movie, except this one won't be scary, won't be a found footage movie, and will annoy the audience into committing random acts of violence!""Yes, ""Book of Shadows - Blair Witch 2"" -- which doesn't have the Blair Witch OR a Book of Shadows -- is possibly one of the most notorious bad sequels in movie history. And even if you appreciate it purely on its own merits, it ends up being a generic horror movie that repeatedly booga-boogas you with cheap cliched scares... and then explains nothing at the end.Tour group The Blair Witch Hunt, led by local guide Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan), is in the area where the Blair Witch supposedly killed the first film's makers. His group includes: Stephen (Stephen Barker Turner) a pretentious author; Tristen (Tristine Skyler), his pregnant doormat girlfriend; Kim (Kim Director), an obnoxious Goth; and Erica (Erica Leerhsen), a whiny irritating Wiccan who wants to be the Blair Witch's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. She's that stupid.But after a night of pot and booze, they wake up to discover that they have no memory of what happened, Stephen's notes have been shredded, and Tristen is having a miscarriage. When the group holes itself up in Jeff's spooky-old-factory home, they are haunted by strange visions and hallucinations -- and they soon discover that they may not be able to trust themselves.It's difficult to express in a mere plot summary just how ANNOYING this movie is. Not scary, annoying. The characters are annoying, the dialogue is annoying, and even the paranormal activity is intensely annoying -- things pop up and go ""boo,"" then vanish.  In fact, once you strip away the flimsy connections to the Blair Witch and just make this a standalone, it's just a painfully cliched horror movie.Yep. People drink, smoke pot, have sex, and then die in mysterious ways that are ambiguously handled. Director Joe Berlinger also films the movie in a choppy, time-hopping way that quickly reveals who isn't going to die... so bye-bye, suspense. The dialogue is devastatingly bad (""Ladies and gentlemen, that there is a naked woman!"") when Berlinger isn't making us nauseous with the sick-making camerawork. Of all the things from the first movie to preserve!And in case you were wondering if the Blair Witch appears here, or what the Book of Shadows is.... the answer is NO, YOU IDIOT. The Blair Witch is only mentioned in place of a mindless generic evil force that causes generic effects (a corpse girl saying Cryptic Things), and there is no book of any kind here.But the worst part is the characters.

Being enthralled by motion pictures, I've seen thousands of films in my time, and this was the first one in which I've ever fallen asleep. The drama was strained and mechanistic, the suspense was anything but suspenseful, and the dialog was akin to a second-rate episode of MTV's The Real World. I've certainly seen true dogs in my time -- End of Days, Hudson Hawk, and the ultra-boring My Dinner with Andre, to name a few -- but I'd rather watch all of these than have to sit through another showing of Book of Shadows.

The key device is an exploitation of our habits of seeing: That what we see on the screen is &quot;real.&quot;  Over and again, the film comments on itself by showing the viewer that what they see is not what they get (e.g., lost time in discovered footage is miraculously recovered when played in reverse, cuing the late eighties obsession with &quot;backward masking&quot;).  The schemes and shooting techniques are original and clever, and often highly entertaining.  The problem with this movie is the &quot;Hollywood&quot; problem--pre-screenings probably de-railed the original scripting time and time again until Artisan was comfortable with the product.  The end result is a smartly conceived sequal with poor delivery.  The films saving grace is the gothed-out Director, who is nothing short of mesmerizing.

570806,A3SP8WBIJMCMS5,B000056T5E,Gregory J. Bendokus,"[3, 6]","This review might make quite a few people upset here, but I really don't care.  This film is, quite simply, the most unfairly maligned movie of all time.  A lot of people in the film industry have a grudge against the first film in the series because it broke all the rules and was made for pennies.  Those bad feelings have predisposed everyone into instantly hating the sequel and I think that's just ridiculous - heaven forbid we judge the sequel on its own merits.  After reading most of the other whiny, spouting, hate-filled ""reviews"" on this site, I feel as if it's time for me to chime in here, as I've been watching this movie since its release.  I'd be willing to bet that most of the people who gave this one star in here haven't even seen the whole movie!  Anyway, I am not trying to change anyone's opinion but I can't resist offering my own:This is an excellent movie, folks.  I am, by no means, obsessed with the Blair Witch mythos and I realize that it's all fake, but I do know a good movie when I see one.  I can't understand for the life of me how someone can watch this movie and say that they don't like it.  I thought that the way these five arrogant kids were completely manipulated (by the Blair Witch or by themselves) and reduced to blubbering idiots was masterfully done.  I really think that most people who have watched this film simply ""don't get it"", which is sad.  Who killed Erica and locked her in the closet?  Was Tristine really channeling the Blair Witch?  Did Kim really kill the clerk in the store?  How did those police files get into Jeff's filing cabinet?  The genius of this film, in my mind, is that we really don't know WHAT the hell happened to these five people:  Did the Blair Witch possess Tristine and cause her to lead the others on a killing spree or was this all just what Stephen thought it was all along:  Group Hysteria?I enjoyed the story and loved the atmosphere that Berlinger has created, and I also thought the actors were just fine.  Well, almost all of them:  Stephen Barker Turner really didn't do a lot for me but I thought the emotions he displayed in his interrogation scene near the end of the film were fantastic, as I bought into his performance completely.  Erica Leerhson, besides being quite easy on the eyes, was convincing as a bratty self-centered Wiccan.  Kim Director was also excellent as the Goth character and is it just me or does this woman have the prettiest eyes you've ever seen in your life?  Tristine Skyler also wowed me with her 'transformation' near the end of the film.  That leaves Jeffrey Donovan and I felt that his performance was just brilliant, as I totally bought the emotions his character was going through and I think he has an excellent screen presence.  Also, the look on his face when he finds Erica in the closet is one of the scariest reactions I've EVER seen from ANYONE in a movie.  I'll be watching his career and look forward to seeing more of his work in the future.Don't get the wrong idea - I'm not saying that this film is a masterpiece, as it does have lots of room for improvement.  I wasn't crazy about the random images of gore placed in the film (against the director's wishes), Lanny Flaherty was WAY over the top as the sheriff, and the scenes in the beer store were just plain silly.  The problem here is that this is not really a ""horror"" movie, it's more of a psychological head f**k than anything, which is a type of movie I really enjoy.  You also need to think when you watch this, as a lot more is happening in the film than you may realize on the first viewing.  What I am saying here is that this film is IN NO WAY anywhere near as bad as people make it out to be.All I ask is that if you haven't seen this movie only because of the windbag, whiny ""it sucks"" reviews on this site, at least watch the thing once yourself before making any conclusions.

You can sense some hard work and a chance that it could have been better... but mainly I blame the Screenwriter for messing it up! So what has badly affected the movie?1. Extremely bad screen script! You waste most of the time trying to focus on what is happening because from the first ten minutes you keep seeing flashes from parts of the movie that took place prior and after where you at! And you fail to get the picture until the end.2. The suspense of the movie is ONLY in the first half hour (while in the woods) but afterwards; both suspense and thrill are lost.3. There is no scary OST in the film that can drive the thrill up.4. The actors fear and reaction was not convincing (except at the police station / at the end of the movie).5.

No, it's not that I'm so dumb I cannot understand it, it's actually that the film is so simple in it's conflictions that I am surprised everyone else hasn't seen right through it.Showing slight promise in the early scenes where mockumentary seems to taken to a higher, more sophisticated level than the first, the film quickly collapses into stupidness after about 30 minutes of mildly effective mystery.Basically, 5 idiots (one of them with a basketball sized goiter on his neck) try to figure out why the whole world went nuts over BWP back in 1999, rather than if the BW really exists or not. 2 of them are writing a book on mass hysteria, one is a tour guide with a dodgy (and totally unexplained) past, the other a witch, the other a Goth (?).After spending the night in the ruins of Rustin Parr's house they awake to find their camera's destroyed and their paperwork shredded. Was it the Blair Witch? Hardly, she's not real. Right? Don't look at me for answers, the film doesn't contain any.  In hoping that the audience would rather be confused than bored, any old crap is thrown at us to keep us in the dark.The original film was excused for this. It was a low budget independent movie and NOT a Hollywood film. BW2 IS a Hollywood film and fails on every basic level. Even the tiny, tiny irony in being called Book of Shadows, I believe, is a fluke/coincidence. Any other attempt at irony is purely textbook. Ooohhh mass hysteria!And if the Blair Witch ISN'T real (as this film repeatedly states) why are their physical impossibilities taking place? Why do they all go mad (mass hysteria my ass)? Why, if they are naked, do they conveniently have underwear on when it comes to frontal shots, but take them off for any other angle?

570814,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,B000056T5E,Jason N. Mical,"[0, 0]","Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, a slick, effects-ridden sequal to the innovative 1999 pseudo-horror film &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; takes more than a little suspension of disbelief and little-to-no knowledge of the first film.  Blair Witch 2 seems like it's caught in a bit of a flux; it fluctuates from horror film to suspense film to horror spoof to commentary on media spectacle without seriously delving into any of those categories.  Unfortunately, the lack of a point - and utter lack of believable characters - takes what could have been an interesting plot and drain it of all life (no pun inteded).The film opens as Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan), a twenetysomething Burkittsville, Maryland (the fictional setting of &quot;The Blair Witch Project) entrepeneur, prepares to lead a group of stereotypes into the woods to see the sights portrayed in the first film.  Among this collection are the skeptic (Stephen), his believer girlfriend (Tristine), a Wiccan with a serious persecution complex (Erica), and a supposedly psychic goth (Kim).  Interspersed throughout the opening - and the rest of the film - are scenes alluding to some horrible crime about to occur, and echoes of Jeff's past in a lunatic asylum.The group arrives at Rustin Parr's cabin, the location of the terrifying final scene in &quot;Blair Witch,&quot; which is now little more than a ruined foundation.  They settle in for a night of booze, dope, and Marilyn Manson and awake the next morning to find that cameras brought along to record &quot;unusual activity&quot; and other belongings were destroyed during the night.  Worse, there is a five-hour gap in everyone's memory and the local Sheriff suddenly seems very interested in asking the group about a series of brutal murders that occured the same night at Coffin Rock, another location famous in the first film.Blair Witch 2 continues in Jeff's house, a converted factory from the Civil War era.  Needless to say, the group experiences all kinds of strange manifestations, including dreams, ghosts, hallucinations, and all sorts of other stock paranormal activity.I'll say this about Blair Witch 2: it wasn't awful.  I've seen a lot worse.  Unfortunately, because of the stereotypical characters and poorly written dialogue (by the fifth time the Wiccan explained that witches are nature-lovers, not evil Satanists, I kind of wished Ash from the Evil Dead would have shown up and cut her in half with his chainsaw), the film lost a lot of the edge that made the first Blair Witch so entertaining.  On top of that, it was a little over-Hollywood-ized; any of the plot motivators, or even a combination of two of them, would have made much more fully developed film.  There is also a significant amount of plot holes, not the least of which is that anyone engaging in that much drinking and smoking in the middle of November in the woords is going to wake up missing a few hours of memory - it doesn't take a witch to cause that problem.  What we were left with is an entertaining experience, and certainly one that fans of the first film will want to see, but I wouldn't recommend it to the casual moviegoer.

[B+]There are many sequels that nobody expected, wanted, and were completely unwarranted.  Such movies include Sinister  (2012) and its inevitable upcoming sequel and the questionably titled The Last Exorcism Part 2 (2013).  Book of Shadows is such a movie.  Nobody could have figured how this story could possibly continue without simply regurgitating the same movie all over again with different actors.  Not the case with this one.  This was a thoughtful, well-crafted sequel which had its own feel, style and story.  It managed to continue the legend from the story arc of the original while proving to be a solid stand-alone film of its own.  It opens with a typical in-the-spirit-of-good-fun nonsense disclaimer:""The following is a fictionalized re-enactment of events that occurred after the releaseof The Blair Witch Project.  It is based on public records...[blah, blah, blah]""The Blair Witch Project (1999) was a shaky found footage movie.  Book of Shadows continues the legacy with paranormal investigation-style video analysis within a traditionally filmed movie.  Like its much more recent follower Grave Encounters 2 (2012), Book of Shadows opens with pop-culture acknowledging the fame of its predecessor (treated as a movie within the newer movie)--in this case using MTV News, late night shows, E! News and real news casts, followed by a brief documentarian approach with the testimony of Burkittsville locals.Jeffrey Donovan (Changeling, USA Network's Burn Notice) does a fine job as Jeff, a witch store propagandist with a troubled past and a painfully average mind living in Burkittsville.  He leads Blair Witch Tours and comes off as simple, easily manipulated and quite likably candid and enthusiastic.  We also get an introduction to how poorly he was treated in a psychiatric facility that operated under 1800s-like moral practices.Assembled for a Blair Witch tour, Jeff leads Erica the ""good witch"" Wiccan (Erica Leerhsen; Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Kim the psychic goth, and the overly academic couple Tristen and Stephen, who are investigating the Blair Witch legend and mass hysteria.I really enjoyed the soundtrack.  The opening credits have us soaring above the defoliated Fall woods in a late overcast afternoon to Marilyn Manson and a scene of campfire overindulgence is most perfectly complemented by Queens of the Stoned Age.  These add a good deal to the erratic, confusing, mysterious mood.  But the weird events, Jeff's past, Tristen's dreams and nervous breakdown, weird and disturbing visions, random clips of violent imagery, and (more than anything) strange discoveries while reviewing their recorded footage (after they all black out overnight) are what really drive this movie.The gore was weakly presented and the special effects, in general, were limited.  But special effects really didn't seem necessary for this movie anyway.  It was effectively driven by the mystery of the story which is slowly unveiled.Jeff is the focal point of an ensemble cast film. We see alternating scenes of the present, in the form of flash-forwards in which Jeff and the others are interrogated by coarse Sheriff Cravens, and the past, what we would call ""the main movie.""  As the movie ends see how the interrogations end.Some people may have thought this movie was dumb, but I find it a pleasant surprise; more of a great B-movie than a lousy major release.  We see what the characters see, we receive hints that things are not what they seem and that we're ""missing something,"" and soon we have the reveal stage during which we see what really happened.  At times you might even question what is ""really"" happening.Even seeing this movie a second time, I find it satisfying.  I hope you hear what harsher reviewers say, but see what I see so that you can enjoy this movie with me.",5,"Another great, low budget B-movie that was unfairly reviewed as a theatrical release, which it shouldn't have been.

You cannot expect a movie filmed in one style to have a profitable and enjoyable sequel the second time around filmed in a completely different style (even though the first 10 minutes of BW:2 is filmed in the documentary style as the first one was).  A different director this second time around also seems to contribute to the style of the second, and it doesn't help. The vision of the first is remade, revamped, and lost! The dialogue is also very foot in mouth, too scripted... I wasn't convinced. The groundbreaking techniques and audience participation of the first film are as lost as Josh, Heather, and Mike were in the woods! BW:2 is for the breast-fed audience who were unwilling to give in to suspension of disbelief in the first film.You either loved it or hated it. I loved BW:1, but find little to love about BW:2.

570831,AFD4IXYHTLBHS,B000056T5E,"Lenny Nero ""A Not Too Snobby Flick Lover""","[2, 3]","I actually found this flick to be a logical progression to the first movie, without being too much of a re-hash.  I also found the acting and direction to be quite competent.  I like the idea that I was left in the dark just as much as the characters are.  For me, it puts me in the shoes of the characters.  However, it can be easy to understand why some may not like it.  In my experiences, I haven't known too many people that have positive things to say about movies that aren't particularly easy to understand.  I'm not insulting anyone's intelligence here, because the movie does seem to have a desire to leave you in the dark and answer as few questions as possible.  By the end of the movie, it's easy to understand where some people might feel lost and underwhelmed by it's 180 degree-type of ending, which  seems to come out of left field.  I think that some people, like myself, can really get into this type of cinematic delivery, but then there are others that won't care for this kind of deliberate confussion.Since the style and delivery of this flick is radically different than the first one, it's really hard to say whether a fan of the first one would like this.  But I do think that this movie is well-made enough to sit through a viewing or two - I did personally find this movie to be a more entertaining watch on a second viewing, and I also found this movie's overall runtime to be more entertaining than the first movie.  I can deffinately understand how this movie can be a love/hate kind of flick, but I do think that some people may be pleasantly surprised by this offering.  I doubt a rental would kill too many people's pocket - Oddly enough, it would appear to be cheaper to just buy it used off of Amazon, so there really isn't much to lose by giving this movie a shot.On a side note - I often put this movie under the same breath as ""Session 9"".  Their digitalistic appearance, storytelling devices, and overall mood can sometimes be rather comprable to one another, in my opinion.  If you enjoy ""Session 9"", something tells me that you just might get some entertainment out of ""Book of Shadows"".",4,Not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2129,"['actually', 'found', 'flick', 'be', 'logical', 'progression', 'first', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'much', 're-hash', 'also', 'found', 'acting', 'direction', 'be', 'quite', 'competent', 'like', 'idea', 'was', 'left', 'dark', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'are', 'shoes', 'characters', 'However', 'can', 'be', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'experiences', 'have', ""n't"", 'known', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'positive', 'things', 'say', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'easy', 'understand', ""'m"", 'not', 'insulting', 'anyone', 'intelligence', 'here', 'movie', 'seem', 'have', 'desire', 'leave', 'dark', 'answer', 'few', 'questions', 'possible', 'end', 'movie', 'easy', 'understand', 'where', 'people', 'might', 'feel', 'lost', 'underwhelmed', '180', 'degree-type', 'ending', 'come', 'left', 'field', 'think', 'people', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'type', 'cinematic', 'delivery', 'then', 'are', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'kind', 'deliberate', 'confussion.Since', 'style', 'delivery', 'flick', 'radically', 'different', 'first', 'one', 'really', 'hard', 'say', 'fan', 'first', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'well-made', 'enough', 'sit', 'viewing', 'two', 'did', 'personally', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'second', 'viewing', 'also', 'found', 'movie', 'overall', 'runtime', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'first', 'movie', 'can', 'deffinately', 'understand', 'how', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'love/hate', 'kind', 'flick', 'do', 'think', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'offering', 'doubt', 'rental', 'would', 'kill', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'pocket', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'cheaper', 'just', 'buy', 'used', 'Amazon', 'so', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'lose', 'giving', 'movie', 'shot.On', 'side', 'note', 'often', 'put', 'movie', 'same', 'breath', 'Session', '9', 'digitalistic', 'appearance', 'storytelling', 'devices', 'overall', 'mood', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'rather', 'comprable', 'one', 'opinion', 'enjoy', 'Session', '9', 'something', 'tells', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'entertainment', 'Book', 'Shadows']",N/A
570832,ASSKHS3FV3J0H,B000056T5E,"Lillian Patterson ""Post-Postmodern Angster""","[1, 2]","It's very true that sequels rarely match the quality of the original film (in fact, we're often lucky if they're even WATCHABLE).  The original Blair Witch Project was an effective horror film.  While it didn't exactly scare me, it stayed with me, and I wouldn't ever go camping right after watching that film-no way!  But I had heard that the sequel was a horrible movie, and I only watched it after reading two reviews that praised the film.  But when I did watch it, I was utterly shocked.  Let's just say that I'm frustrated with all the people who told me that this was a terrible movie, because their comments almost kept me from watching one of the best horror films I've ever seen.The plot is fairly predictable-we've seen this all before.  A group of people agree to spend the night at a spot that's supposed to be haunted, cursed, etc. hoping to witness some supernatural phenomena.  They bring cameras to record such phenomena if it occurs.  Terrifying events ensue.  What sets this film apart is the strong sense of forboding that looms over the characters right from the beginning.  The atmosphere is perfect-you know that something is going to happen, something bad, but you don't know what.  And when it does happen, it's not what you expect (or rather, it doesn't happen the way you'd expect it to).  No horrible monsters jump out and kill the main characters, no, this film is into portraying a far more subtle, powerful evil.  The 5 main characters attempt to stay awake the entire night, but they awaken the next morning and discover that they've fallen asleep, and they don't remember what happened in the last 5 hours.  One of the characters lives at an abandoned broom factory (ha ha) and so the group meets there to view the footage they recorded during the night, in hopes of finding out what happened to them during those 5 hours.From the beginning, there are clues that things are not what they seem to be.  The greatest triumph of this film is that it leaves you puzzling over what happened-what is true and what isn't?  Exactly what role did the supernatural play in the events that unfolded after the group met that night in the woods?  Is it safe to assume, as one character states, that ""video doesn't lie""?In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of ""self-aware"" horror films (ha ha, look at us, we're poking fun at the horror genre`) and that's fine.  But I've missed truly scary horror films, films that portrayed evil as something truly bad-horrifying, powerful, and able to ruin lives.  This film captures that spirit perfectly.  Don't play around with evil, it'll get inside you, mess you up, and then kill you.  That's genuinely scary, that's what horror movies are supposed to do, and that's what this film does perfectly.  So don't listen to all the reviewers who hated this movie.  It's not for everyone, but many highly intelligent people enjoyed this film, and I would go as far as to say that it's even better than the original.",5,Utterly Shocked,1029196800,"08 13, 2002",2002,2982,"['very', 'true', 'sequels', 'rarely', 'match', 'quality', 'original', 'film', 'fact', ""'re"", 'often', 'lucky', ""'re"", 'even', 'WATCHABLE', 'original', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'effective', 'horror', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'scare', 'stayed', 'would', ""n't"", 'ever', 'go', 'camping', 'right', 'watching', 'film-no', 'way', 'had', 'heard', 'sequel', 'was', 'horrible', 'movie', 'only', 'watched', 'reading', 'two', 'reviews', 'praised', 'film', 'when', 'did', 'watch', 'was', 'utterly', 'shocked', 'Let', 'just', 'say', ""'m"", 'frustrated', 'people', 'who', 'told', 'was', 'terrible', 'movie', 'comments', 'almost', 'kept', 'watching', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'predictable-we', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'group', 'people', 'agree', 'spend', 'night', 'spot', 'supposed', 'be', 'haunted', 'cursed', 'etc', 'hoping', 'witness', 'supernatural', 'phenomena', 'bring', 'cameras', 'record', 'such', 'phenomena', 'Terrifying', 'events', 'ensue', 'What', 'film', 'apart', 'strong', 'sense', 'forboding', 'characters', 'right', 'beginning', 'atmosphere', 'perfect-you', 'know', 'something', 'going', 'happen', 'something', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'when', 'happen', 'not', 'what', 'expect', 'rather', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'horrible', 'monsters', 'jump', 'out', 'kill', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'portraying', 'far', 'more', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'evil', '5', 'main', 'characters', 'attempt', 'stay', 'awake', 'entire', 'night', 'awaken', 'next', 'morning', 'discover', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'asleep', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'last', '5', 'hours', 'One', 'characters', 'abandoned', 'broom', 'factory', 'ha', 'ha', 'so', 'group', 'there', 'view', 'footage', 'recorded', 'night', 'hopes', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', '5', 'hours.From', 'beginning', 'are', 'clues', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'film', 'puzzling', 'over', 'what', 'happened-what', 'true', 'what', ""n't"", 'Exactly', 'what', 'role', 'did', 'supernatural', 'play', 'events', 'unfolded', 'group', 'met', 'night', 'woods', 'safe', 'assume', 'one', 'character', 'states', 'video', ""n't"", 'lie', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'increasing', 'number', 'self-aware', 'horror', 'films', 'ha', 'ha', 'look', ""'re"", 'poking', 'fun', 'horror', 'genre', 'fine', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'truly', 'scary', 'horror', 'films', 'films', 'portrayed', 'evil', 'something', 'truly', 'bad-horrifying', 'powerful', 'able', 'ruin', 'lives', 'film', 'spirit', 'perfectly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'play', 'around', 'evil', ""'ll"", 'get', 'mess', 'then', 'kill', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'what', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'do', 'what', 'film', 'perfectly', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'reviewers', 'who', 'hated', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'many', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'people', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'would', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'even', 'better', 'original']",N/A

I can understand that some won't get it, that some will prefer the ""reality"" gimmick of the first film, and that it just won't be some peoples' cup of cinematic tea.  But the level of vitriol is simply astounding.Personally, I found this to be one of the more intelligent and interesting horror films that I have ever seen.  The concept of time being fluid in the woods near the old town of Blair was brought up subtly in the first film (actually, it was more prominent in the tie-in book).  This idea is played with extensively in this outing, and with some results that I found fascinating.  The question of how much the kids in the first film were being manipulated by the Witch is also explored, as is the legend of the Witch herself.  Some of these things are not dealt with in a simplistic, documentary fashion.  You have to work for what you get out of this film.The only real negative I could pinpoint was the actor who played the Sheriff.  He was simply awful, almost making me want to leave the theater during his first scene (something I've never done).  For some reason, however, he is the only one of the cast that I do NOT see torn apart in these reviews.  Odd...In short, do not expect anything like the original.  Try to view the film with an open mind and be aware of the subtext.  Reading both of the Blair Witch tie-in books is also a good idea.I don't expect that many will love the film as much as I did, but give it a try.

I like the characters, the feel of things, the way the story is developing and the constant use of the soundtrack.  Then, as the movie winds its way into ""scare"" mode, things start to stall and finally come to a screeching halt.  But back to the good points.  Kim Director is excellent as ""Kim Diamond"" the goth empath.  I also liked Erika Leerhsen as overbearing ""Wiccan Hottie"" and Jeffery Donovan as the slightly crazy Jeff Patterson (In an homage to the first Blair Witch, the main characters have the same names as the actors portraying them).  Tristan Skyler and Stephen B. Turner have taken a lot of flack on here for their portrayals of a researcher and his fiance, but they do the best with what they are given: the ""serious"" roles in the group of four people taking the inaugural trip on Jeff's ""Blair Witch Hunt"" tour of Burkittsville, MD, home of the Blair Witch.  Look for product placement galore: Shinerbock beer, Pete's Wicked Ale, Moosehead Beer.  The scenes at the convenience store are hilarious: the store only sells the above three beers!  Also, the weird little hidden things that the DVD touts as the ""Secrets of ESREVER!"" are interesting to try to find.The next two thirds of the movie is awful and not in a funny way.  I never stop being disappointed in what I see.  Much has been made of the movie ""operating at a higher level"" than a horror movie or suffering from its relationship to the original Blair Witch movie.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This movie was promoted as a ""real life"" documentary that had to be altered slightly to avoid a lawsuit from the families of the victims.  There was a made for TV movie called ""Shadow of the Bliar Witch"" released just before BW2 that played this up to the hilt: in it footage of the ""REAL"" Jeff Patterson and his ""REAL"" tour group are spliced in with ""REAL"" news footage from Burkittsville, etc., all in an attempt to make the viewer believe that BW2, like BW1, was based on real events.  So, everything was set up to make a movie IN the ""Blair Witch Mythos,"" but something bad happened along the way.  It's my opinion that writer/ director Joe Berlinger really dropped the ball in his work on this movie and he proves it in his comments in the DVD booklet.  He goes on and on about his ""vision"", etc., etc. and finally makes the statement that with BW2 he has ""embraced ambiguity."" In other words, he doesn't know what it means either.

ACTUALLY THE END TIES IT ALL TOGETHER AND SAVES THE FILM FROM BEING TOTALLY TONGUE IN CHEEK. I AM ONE OF THOSE HYPE-HATERS. I DIDN'T SEE THIS MOVIE UNTIL IT CAME OUT ON DVD. I WANTED TO HATE IT, BUT I CAN'T. IT BORROWS FROM ALL OF MY FAVORITE TYPES OF FILMS AND MAKES FOR ONE HELL OF A GROOVY CHEESEBALL RIDE . AS A SEQUEL TO THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT IT FAILS. AS A VERY FUNNY, SEXY, SILLY WITCH ROMP WITH A THOUGHT PROVOKING ENDING IT IS HARD TO BEAT. THE SCORE ON THE SECOND SIDE OF THE DVD IS VERY NICE AS WELL.

570843,A14J223PFWU89G,B000056T5E,Matt,"[1, 1]","To say this movie was a disappointment would be a colossal understatement. Truthfully, I didn't hold high hopes going into it but I've been surprised before. Needless to say &quot;Blair Witch 2&quot; was not one of those scenarios.My reasons for having faith in a sequel were the amazing legacy of its predecessor &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and the news that documentarian Joe Berlinger would direct this time around. Outside of those two things, however, the outlook looked pretty bleak. That's the one area in which this movie didn't disappoint.What's so bad about this movie? Answer: Whatta ya got. I couldn't possibly chronicle all of its sins in this space but what I will do is run down some of the more obvious ones. First of all there's the acting, which, say what you will about the first film, but this new cast makes Heather, Josh, and Mike look like Academy award material. Then there's the writing which is bad enough on its own but coupled with the acting it sounds even worse, if you can imagine such a thing. Now onto the plot, which is all over the board. There's no direction so in that respect playing chutes and ladders offers more structure. And lastly, it has a rushed feeling which is perceptible to everyone who watches it. It is painfully evident that &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; was pushed through production as fast as possible to insure that it made it to theaters before the gravy train that was the &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; came to a halt.In summation, there is absolutely no redeeming value to &quot;Blair Witch 2&quot;. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't even look at the lobby card.

570844,A3U5WICBZ0CUQ8,B000056T5E,Matthew C. Pinkerton,"[27, 34]","""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2"" may very well be the most maligned sequel of all time.  I have read more positive reviews for ""Airplane 2: The Sequel.""  I have heard more compliments handed out to ""Friday the 13th Part 2.""  There have been far more words of praise lavished like so much lumpy sausage gravy over ""The Matrix Reloaded.""  What gives?Actually, I think the answer lies in the very hype surrounding the first ""Blair Witch"" which this film so succesfully spoofs.  I mean, think about it.  You start out with an unexpected cultural phenomenon on the level of ""Star Wars.""  You wait barely a year before issuing a sequel (not nearly enough time for memories of the first film to become hazy, but plenty of time for the inevitable backlash against it to firmly take root in the popular psyche).  Then you have the audacity to release a film that not only pokes fun at the very people who are most likely to rush right out and buy a ticket for the opening night showing, but you make the film in a style completely different from the first film.  Whereas the original ""Blair Witch Project"" was groundbreaking and unique, ""Book of Shadows"" is groundbreaking and unique...  But in a very different way.Joe Berlinger is more than well aware of his roots and pulls no punches when it comes to honoring and lampooning them all in the same breath.  This is not to suggest that ol' Joe has gone the route of McG and is pandering with one hand while he smirks and winks the whole time.  ""Book of Shadows"" is far too subtle and made in too much good faith for that kind of nonsense.  Berlinger's point has more to do with questioning reality and fantasy and the complicated dance between the two which most of us take so much for granted.  What is the truth of the Blair Witch?  If it is only a story then how can it so deeply effect people and at what point is a story not merely a story any more?This is a question most people (at least in this country) tend to shrug off, but which, ironically, is a question that most people (especially in this country) need to start examining.  This is, after all, the native land of one Mark David Chapman who murdered a peace-loving cultural icon because he thought it was prescribed by a J.D. Salinger novel.  This is the place where hordes of people came out in protest over ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" because it was a story that did not live up to the other stories they had been told all of their lives.  This is still the same America where Charles Manson founded a faithful cult following willing to kill or die for him based upon a science fiction novel.  And this is the same country where three boys were jailed and await execution on the strength of a popular myth that says they look like (and therefore must be) witches.When is a story not a story?  What is the boundary between sanity and insanity?  Is it when fantasy begins to take precedence in the mind?  Here Berlinger confronts us with a whole town full of characters who have been washed away by a fiction.  You have tour groups roughing it out in the middle of nowhere hoping to find...  Something...  Anything.  You have townspeople who find their quiet way of life destroyed.  You have a sheriff driven to the point of vigilantism.  All in the name of a fiction.What Berlinger is trying to show us is how none of these responses are appropriate to the situation.  You cannot kill a myth simply by deconstructing it.  The amount of time and attention means that the myth has already won.  It has become just as much an obsession for the naysayer as it has for the fanatic and the results can be just as damaging either way.Want proof?  Well, not so very long ago, in a town quite close to where I reside, there was a little incident known as the Columbine Massacre.  In the days, weeks, months and years that followed, everyone began extending their index fingers in the direction of everyone else.  The vast majority of these fingers were leveled directly at popular culture.  The music of one Marilyn Manson was usually singled out for the greatest abuse.  Pundits and so-called experts appeared on television nightly to discuss the relative merits and demerits of Mr. Manson's wailings and shoot off (no pun intended) an opinion as to just how much, if any, blame should be laid at his feet.  Only months later did we learn, to our collective shock, that neither of the perpetrators of the Columbine killings was all that big a fan of Marilyn Manson.  Oops.  By then, however, it was too late.  The myth had taken root.  The pundits and so-called experts laughed all the way to the bank.  Mr. Manson rescheduled his canceled concert dates.  The so-called news networks stuffed yet more money in their collective coffers and none of us learned one damn thing.  We simply supplanted one fiction with another.  And the beat goes on.For this, if for no other reason, ""Book of Shadows"" deserves a second look.  Despite Mr. Roger ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" Ebert's gripes about how horribly this movie reflects on Berlinger's previous documentary efforts, I think a closer inspection will reveal just how wrong the portly one really is.  If you haven't seen it, then do yourself a favor.  Now that all the hype has died away, put on a fresh set of eyes and keep your mind open.  You're in for a fast-paced, stylish, genuinely scary ride with something more on its mind than simple shock value.",5,AFTER ALL THE HYPE HAS WORN AWAY...,1062633600,"09 4, 2003",2003,5412,"['Book',

570845,A152C8GYY25HAH,B000056T5E,Matthew Horner,"[1, 5]","Sequels have become a given in the last 20 years. A look at a list of the top-grossing movies shows that perhaps seventy percent of them have either spawned a sequel or are themselves sequels. So when the ultra low budget &#65533;The Blair Witch Project&#65533; became a smash hit, another movie on the subject became inevitable. Since a follow up movie is usually a retread by default, few people expect it to be as good as the original.What surprised many folks was just how bad a sequel &#65533;Book of Shadows&#65533; is. [By the way, there IS no book of shadows in the movie]. It begins as a promising mockumentary and looks as if it is going to be a satire of the original. It quickly fades into a predictable, by-the-numbers horror movie. At times it seems as if it has something it is trying to say, but any message is muddled by its confused editing and script. Example: If you were on a tour of the Blair witch location and had a miscarriage one morning, would you rejoin the group that afternoon?

570846,A3PR4ZSBDUL4EG,B000056T5E,"Matthew S. Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[3, 4]","""Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows"" is of course the sequal to the 1999 darkhorse smash hit ""The Blair Witch Project"".  And like many sequels it fails to live up to most of the original movie's fans expectations.  However, BW2 merits a closer look.  Director Joe Berlinger, the successful documentary filmmaker who shed light on the plight of the West Memphis 3 in his acclaimed ""Paradise Lost"" films, takes on the theme of illusion and reality in the gloomy Black Hills of Maryland where the first film's protagonists supposedly died while making a documentary film on the legend of the Blair Witch.  Berlinger has brought on a young cast of unknowns to explore the further depths of the human mind and its often unseen capability for credulity and violence.The film revolves around five strangers on a tour of the area around Burkittsville, MD, inundated with tourists in the wake of the first film's success.  The group is led by a entrepreneurial former mental patient who makes a living hocking Blair Witch memerobilia and stolen electronics equipment on the Internet.  Along for the ride are a pair of grad students working on a book about the Blair Witch mythos, an attractive young Wiccan who is out to stick up for her much-maligned beliefs, and a tough-talking Goth chick who ""thought the movie was cool"" and who seems to hide some latent psychic abilities.  Together they brave the same woods where the Blair Witch is said to have walked and, armed with a bevy of video equiptment, get drunk and stoned amidst the ruins of the same house where the original filmakers were said to have died.  After a run-in with a rival tour group, strange things start to happen, including miscarriages, sex, ghostly visitations, dancing naked girls, rampant paranoia, and...maybe...bloody murder.The question at the end of the film is...did this really happen?  And if so, who did it?  The theme of illusion (ie. film) vs. reality has been done before, but it is done here in an engaging and eerie atmosphere.  There really aren't alot of scares in this film, and judging from the director's own comments, there weren't meant to be.  This movie takes the idea that people can believe in something enough to make it real...perhaps that is the true scare.  Where is the line between fiction and reality?  Tristan and Stephen even argue the point as they camp out at the Parr ruins just before the bloody Bacchanalia ensues.  If these murders were real, who did it?  Was the Blair Witch responsible for reachign out from beyond the grave with her dark powers to force these people to kill?  Is there a Blair Witch in the first place?  Does it even really matter?  The true evil lies not in the supernatural, but in the dark recesses of the human mind.  Can a group of people, obesessed with a horror movie about a group of kids who die alone in the woods while searching for a legendary evil Witch, be driven to commit horrendous acts of violence and then delude themselves into believing it didn;t happen?  What is the effect of media on our perceptions of reality?  These are all questions Berlinger indirectly asks during this film.  That is not to say that this is a perfect movie by any means.  The script leaves much to be desired, the chracters are simple caricatures, and it seems to drag in its second half.  But I think this film is worth a look and deserves a little better than many of the reviews give it here.",4,Blair Witch 2: History or Hysteria?,1062633600,"09 4, 2003",2003,3413,"['Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'course', 'sequal', '1999', 'darkhorse', 'smash', 'hit', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'many', 'sequels', 'live', 'up', 'most', 'original', 'movie', 'fans', 'expectations', 'However', 'BW2', 'closer', 'look', 'Director', 'Joe', 'Berlinger', 'successful', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'shed', 'light', 'plight', 'West', 'Memphis', '3', 'acclaimed', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'films', 'theme', 'illusion', 'reality', 'gloomy', 'Black', 'Hills', 'Maryland', 'where', 'first', 'film', 'protagonists', 'supposedly', 'died', 'making', 'documentary', 'film', 'legend', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Berlinger', 'brought', 'young', 'cast', 'unknowns', 'explore', 'further', 'depths', 'human', 'mind', 'often', 'unseen', 'capability', 'credulity', 'violence.The', 'film', 'around', 'five', 'strangers', 'tour', 'area', 'Burkittsville', 'MD', 'inundated', 'tourists', 'wake', 'first', 'film', 'success', 'group', 'led', 'entrepreneurial', 'former', 'mental', 'patient', 'who', 'living', 'hocking', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'memerobilia', 'stolen', 'electronics', 'equipment', 'Internet', 'Along', 'ride', 'are', 'pair', 'grad', 'students', 'working', 'book', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'mythos', 'attractive', 'young', 'Wiccan', 'who', 'out', 'stick', 'up', 'much-maligned', 'beliefs', 'tough-talking', 'Goth', 'chick', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'cool', 'who', 'hide', 'latent', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'Together', 'brave', 'same', 'woods', 'where', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'said', 'have', 'walked', 'armed', 'bevy', 'video', 'equiptment', 'get', 'drunk', 'stoned', 'ruins', 'same', 'house', 'where', 'original', 'filmakers', 'were', 'said', 'have', 'died', 'run-in', 'rival', 'tour', 'group', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'including', 'miscarriages', 'sex', 'ghostly', 'visitations', 'dancing', 'naked', 'girls', 'rampant', 'paranoia', 'maybe', 'bloody', 'murder.The', 'question', 'end', 'film', 'did', 'really', 'happen', 'so', 'who', 'did', 'theme', 'illusion', 'ie', 'film', 'vs.', 'reality', 'been', 'done', 'done', 'here', 'engaging', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'alot', 'scares', 'film', 'judging', 'director', 'own', 'comments', 'were', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'movie', 'idea', 'people', 'can', 'believe', 'something', 'enough', 'make', 'real', 'perhaps', 'true', 'scare', 'Where', 'line', 'fiction', 'reality', 'Tristan', 'Stephen', 'even', 'argue', 'point', 'camp', 'out', 'Parr', 'just', 'bloody', 'Bacchanalia', 'ensues', 'murders', 'were', 'real', 'who', 'did', 'Was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'responsible', 'reachign', 'grave', 'dark', 'powers', 'force', 'people', 'kill', 'there', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'first', 'place', 'even', 'really', 'matter', 'true', 'evil', 'not', 'supernatural', 'dark', 'recesses', 'human', 'mind', 'Can', 'group', 'people', 'obesessed', 'horror', 'movie', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'die', 'alone', 'woods', 'searching', 'legendary', 'evil', 'Witch', 'be', 'driven', 'commit', 'horrendous', 'acts', 'violence', 'then', 'delude', 'believing', 't', 'happen', 'What', 'effect', 'media', 'perceptions', 'reality', 'are', 'questions', 'Berlinger', 'indirectly', 'film', 'not', 'say', 'perfect', 'movie', 'means', 'script', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'chracters', 'are', 'simple', 'caricatures', 'drag', 'second', 'half', 'think', 'film', 'look', 'little', 'better', 'many', 'reviews', 'give', 'here']",N/A

It takes a lot to get me to pull the trigger on a horror movie in mid-play, but that threshold was met and exceeded by the BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLAIR WITCH 2.You have to give the makes of this film some credit. With just two hours of incoherent, badly-written filmmaking, they managed to end any hopes Hollywood had for making a string of BLAIR WITCH movies. Not only that, but they actually drove the whole phenomenon which accompanied the first flick right out of the popular consciousness. I honestly haven't heard the words ""Blair Witch"" uttered aloud by anyone, anyone at all, since about 2001. And this movie came out in 2001. Coincidence?The concept here involves some fans of the original film, who take a guided tour in the same woods where the events of BW ""happened."" They make a camp, but wake up later with all their equipment wrecked or stolen, and no memory of the intervening five hours. The rest of the film takes place in an abandoned...sigh...broom factory where the fans have holed up. They begin to get paranoid, bleed and find that creepy BW symbol on their bodies when not screaming at each other. Not much happens, and nothing makes sense, but everyone is angry, and so was I when I realized how badly this movie sucked.Whether writer-director Joe Berlinger suffered a violent blow to the skull when he did both tasks, or simply has no feeling whatsoever for non-documentary film-making, or staggered off on some pretentious-artist trip, I've no idea. I just know there's a reason this sucker's in the bargain bin at your local Ballbuster.The last time I saw a sequel desecrate the original this badly was with the second MATRIX film. But that was just silly, stupid and boring. This throws in some additional ""qualities"", like having nothing whatsoever to do with the original and suffering from the delusion that continuity, order or a comprehensible storyline are necessary to make a successful movie, and you have a level of crappiness which is seldom achieved even on those bloodygodawful movies you see on the Sci-Fi channel.Let's face it. The first BLAIR WITCH movie wasn't actually very good, it was more like a clever student film, hitched to a brilliantly innovative guerilla marketing campaign, which itself happened to trundle into town at a time when the horror movie market was in a creative depression. Take away the gimmickry, and you have nonunion actors shreiking at each other in the woods. But at least the idea was cool. Here, there are no ideas, except to kick the crap out of the pinata of the original idea in the hopes it would cough out some candy. Sorry.

They find themselves then not remembering what happend the night they partied out in the blair woods, and try to remember what happend? but they have been touched by the Blair Witch, and delusions play on there mind! and the story gets intresting from there on.It might take a second time look to understand some parts? as it tends to skip from an event taking place afterwards, and then showing what happend after that, and then all coming into place in the end!

A favorite effect of the director is to quickly cut from the present to some weird, spooky imagery, but this effect is so overused(nearly every minute of the film, no exageration) that it loses any impact and quickly becomes tiresome.The characters are all relentlessly obnoxious, one dimensional stereotypes.  The dialogue is laughably banal, especially that of the townspeople and the redneck sherrif.  Is this the way people from L.A. think small town New Englanders look and act?  At times I had to wonder if the filmmakers were trying for a campy film.  Probably not.

A group of college students and a husband-and-wife professional ghost-hunter team take the maiden voyage, which finds itself in not-so-friendly competition with another guy who had the same idea, and is also on his maiden voyage. The first night, the crew camp out--but when they wake up the next morning after a night of drunken and drug-fueled revelry, they find that they weren't the only ones who blacked out--their everpresent video cameras have lost five hours of time. And during that five hours, the other crew of ghost hunters were brutally murdered. With Jeffrey and his charges the prime suspects, they retreat to the well-guarded house of Rustin Parr, supposedly the first victim of the Blair Witch's possession (and in whose basement the first film's unforgettable final scene takes place), and start dissecting the videotape they do have to try and figure out what happened that night.What makes it even more confusing is that, unlike the first film (let's face it, Joshua Leonard was the only person to come out of that movie with a career), Book of Shadows has a ridiculous cast. Stephen Turner (Seducing Charlie Barker). Erica Leerhsen (Mozart and the Whale). Kim Director (Inside Man). Tristine Skyler (Cadillac Man). Lanny Flaherty (Signs). The list goes on. Ironically, this may point to one of the potholes the movie hit--whereas Myrick and S&aacute;nchez specifically sought out inexperienced/first-time actors, the casting team for this movie went for already-established actors, which hamstrings the whole ""we have no idea who these people are"" gig. It's obvious Berlinger and co. still wanted to play on it, however, since they used the same tactic of having the actors use things close to their real names. It seems a little thing, but it shows that somewhere during the development process, a lack of thoughtfulness about the movie's direction crept in. And the finished product shows you just how dangerous that sort of thing can be. Barely coherent, unsure whether it wants to be a horror film or a mundane murder mystery, with odd moments that look as if they were shot by rank amateurs (that stand out far more in a film as otherwise well-shot as this one); it's presented nicely, but little else. *",1,Blair Witch 2: Boredom Bad-ohs,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,3288,"['Book', 'Shadows', 'Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'Joe', 'Berlinger', '2000', 'So', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'almost', 'universally-reviled', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'write', '3.9', 'rating', 'IMDB', '13', '%', 'critical', 'rating', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'scarier', 'anything', 'movie', 'know', 'figured', 'Joe', 'Berlinger', 'directed', 'movie', 'half', 'team', 'directed', 'Brother', 'Keeper', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'documentaries', 'How', 'bad', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'watching', 'discovered', 'had', 'been', 'asking', 'wrong', 'question', 'Instead', 'was', 'then', 'asking', 'how', 'director', 'proven', 'track', 'record', 'as', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'Berlinger', 'had', 'also', 'directed', 'least', 'one', 'episode', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'television', 'make', 'movie', 'awful', 'Plot', 'Jeffrey', 'Patterson', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'resident', 'Burkittsville', 'MD', 'scene', 'original', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'wake', 'film', 'publicity', 'start', 'tourism', 'service', 'group', 'college', 'students', 'husband-and-wife', 'professional', 'ghost-hunter', 'team', 'take', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'not-so-friendly', 'competition', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'same', 'idea', 'also', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'first', 'night', 'crew', 'out', 'when', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'night', 'drunken', 'drug-fueled', 'revelry', 'find', 'were', ""n't"", 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'blacked', 'out', 'everpresent', 'video', 'cameras', 'have', 'lost', 'five', 'hours', 'time', 'five', 'hours', 'other', 'crew', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'were', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'Jeffrey', 'charges', 'prime', 'suspects', 'retreat', 'well-guarded', 'house', 'Rustin', 'Parr', 'supposedly', 'first', 'victim', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'possession', 'basement', 'first', 'film', 'unforgettable', 'final', 'scene', 'place', 'start', 'dissecting', 'videotape', 'do', 'have', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'first', 'film', 'let', 'face', 'Joshua', 'Leonard', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'come', 'movie', 'career', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'ridiculous', 'cast', 'Stephen', 'Turner', 'Seducing', 'Charlie', 'Barker', 'Erica', 'Leerhsen', 'Mozart', 'Whale', 'Kim', 'Director', 'Inside', 'Man', 'Tristine', 'Skyler', 'Cadillac', 'Man', 'Lanny', 'Flaherty', 'Signs', 'list', 'Ironically', 'may', 'point', 'one', 'potholes', 'movie', 'hit', 'whereas', 'Myrick', 'S', 'aacute', 'specifically', 'sought', 'out', 'inexperienced/first-time', 'actors', 'casting', 'team', 'movie', 'went', 'already-established', 'actors', 'whole', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'gig', 'obvious', 'Berlinger', 'co.', 'still', 'wanted', 'play', 'however', 'used', 'same', 'tactic', 'having', 'actors', 'use', 'things', 'close', 'real', 'names', 'little', 'thing', 'somewhere', 'development', 'process', 'lack', 'thoughtfulness', 'movie', 'direction', 'crept', 'finished', 'product', 'just', 'how', 'dangerous', 'sort', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'Barely', 'coherent', 'unsure', 'be', 'horror', 'film', 'mundane', 'murder', 'mystery', 'odd', 'moments', 'look', 'were', 'shot', 'rank', 'amateurs', 'stand', 'out', 'far', 'more', 'film', 'otherwise', 'well-shot', 'one', 'presented', 'nicely', 'little', 'else', '*']",N/A

Zwick,"[0, 0]","As one who actually liked the original film (and, yes, I saw it long after the initial media hype had died down), I can&#8217;t say that I expected much from this newest addition to the franchise.  The first film was such a unique work stylistically that, even less than most films, it definitely did not cry out for replication.  Actually, this new film starts off rather well, choosing to acknowledge the reality of not only the original project but also the media ballyhoo and frenzy that attended it.  The film cleverly lampoons the cottage industry that sprang up around the first film, catering to tourists who descended in droves on the once-peaceful town of Burkittsville, Maryland, where the original fictional &#8220;documentary&#8221; was set.  Taking over the reins from the first film&#8217;s creators, writer Dick Beebe and writer/director Joe Berlinger create a scenario in which a group of fans, obsessed with the original film, embark on a &#8220;Blair Witch&#8221; tour that, naturally, turns out to be more than they bargained for.  By eschewing fancy special effects of any kind and hewing closely to the &#8220;reality&#8221; conferred by its documentary style approach, the original film managed to convey a real sense of mounting terror as the people involved became more and more terrified and confused by what was happening to them.  The makers of the sequel attempt to create essentially the same impact here but with far less effectiveness.  Part of the problem is that the demands made on a big budget studio production are obviously worlds apart from those made on a small independent film in which experimentation and imagination are often allowed - and even, at times, encouraged - to flourish.  As a result, the makers of the new film violate the very less-is-more credo that made the original film work in the first place.  Thus, as these new characters begin to spiral down into confusion, terror and madness, we are offered a plethora of quick cut glimpses of demons, ghosts, flashbacks etc. that are more distracting than terrifying.  We could believe what was happening to the characters in the original film because the single-camera technique made it all seem so plausible and real.  This film just feels like the typical stock horror film, filled with fancy techniques but little of the stuff that true nightmares are made of.More often than not, the viewer feels more like laughing at the silliness of the proceedings than gasping.  Eventually, even the dialogue seems to be providing an almost subconscious running commentary on the film itself as the characters yell out at various points such pearls of wisdom as &#8220;This is too weird&#8221; and &#8220;This makes no sense.&#8221;The story does a nice job at the end showing how what is captured on film or tape may not necessarily correlate with the facts of history.  And, I guess, we are also encouraged to read the film in two ways &#8211; as both a genuine horror story in which the Blair Witch is somehow exercising her supernatural powers or as a study of mass psychosis playing havoc with a group of emotionally off-kilter people.  Yet, in the long run, &#8220;Book of Shadows&#8221; just doesn&#8217;t seem worth the effort.  Any way you slice it, a horror film that doesn&#8217;t horrify has failed to live up to its calling.

Although it certainly was not in line with the 1st Blair Witch, it is a far superior movie with more re-watchability IMO. The story was great, the acting was believable, several scenes were creepy and even disturbing, plus the twists  were fun, all in all a great movie! From what I have heard from people over the years it isn't because part 2 departed from the feel of the original that more people didn't see this one. Quite the contrary, people have repeatedly told me they didn't see it because they assumed it would be *like* the original! Had it been widely known that it wouldn't be, I think the movie would have done much better. The original Blair Witch thrived due to its gimmick rather than its merit. Blair Witch 2 can survive on its merit alone with no need for a gimmick. I would have preferred it if 2 were a stand alone movie and had never been connected to the first Blair Witch, not because it detracts from Blair Witch 1, but because Blair Witch 1 detracts from (and sabotaged) Blair Witch 2.""Book of Shadows"" is nothing like the original Blair Witch movie, so if you didn't like the first one don't hold it against this one! This movie is a brilliant psychological thriller, and practically a spoof at the same time. Does that sound easy to pull off? Of course not, therefore a lot of talent is revealed in the doing.

Thats why , in the commentary by the director, he admits to using movies like THE SHINING, ROSEMARYS BABY, and JACOBS LADDER since they all play on a psychological perspective of events.At NO point in the Blair Witch 2 is the reference to the original film about ""missing documentarians""... one character says ITS A FILM( as in ""fiction"").If you like the supernatural side of the Blair Witch then DO NOT listen to the commentary by the director, and as a matter of course, the  selective scene commentary by Carter Burwell runs close to being cosmically useless.The studio clearly plays up the supernatural angle, and so at the end of the film, we have a little DVD trick called ""Secret of esrever""; the claim is all about secret supernatural messages.Anyways, its clear that the director is more spooked by the people he has chased in his own documentaries rather than the topic of a film franchise he was helming.What on earth were the execs thinking when they had this guy helm a goldmine project with some seriously spooky themes.To show how the Director was illustrating how deluded people have become, he talks about, and shows in his film, how 35mm filming shows the delusions, and Video footage, shows reality. At one point the commentary even talks about an article where a place had a serious delusion problem.What on earth makes the director think he is the one to disabuse us of some escapist stuff that brings a little fun. One can but hope he never gets an entertainment gig  again.Thankfully the studio gets, done about 5-6 weeks before release, recover some of the spookiness. Cuts that the director does not like.Anyway, the structure of the film is very well thought out. The commentary is enough to illustrate this, but it also shows how things have gone somewhat  awry. Very little of the ""Directors cut"" of the film is about anything supernatural  whatsoever. The director wanted an essay in mass delusion.Anyways, worth a watch at least... even if it does have a very reductionist director.",5,Seriously Developed; Studio-usly Scarey,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,2295,"['bought', 'version', 'Dual-Disc', 'called', 'DVD+CD', 'version.The', 'edit', 'see', 'theatrical', 'version', 'heavily', 'studio', 'based', 'Directors', 'Vision', 'one', 'examination', 'how', 'boundaries', 'film', 'reality', 'imagination', 'get', 'seriously', 'distorted', 'Thats', 'why', 'commentary', 'director', 'using', 'movies', 'SHINING', 'ROSEMARYS', 'BABY', 'JACOBS', 'LADDER', 'play', 'psychological', 'perspective', 'events.At', 'NO', 'point', 'Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'reference', 'original', 'film', 'missing', 'documentarians', 'one', 'character', 'ITS', 'A', 'FILM', 'fiction', '.If', 'supernatural', 'side', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'then', 'DO', 'NOT', 'listen', 'commentary', 'director', 'matter', 'course', 'selective', 'scene', 'commentary', 'Carter', 'Burwell', 'close', 'being', 'cosmically', 'useless.The', 'studio', 'clearly', 'up', 'supernatural', 'angle', 'so', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'little', 'DVD', 'trick', 'called', 'Secret', 'esrever', 'claim', 'secret', 'supernatural', 'messages.Anyways', 'clear', 'director', 'more', 'spooked', 'people', 'chased', 'own', 'documentaries', 'rather', 'topic', 'film', 'franchise', 'was', 'helming.What', 'earth', 'were', 'execs', 'thinking', 'when', 'had', 'guy', 'goldmine', 'project', 'seriously', 'spooky', 'themes.To', 'show', 'how', 'Director', 'was', 'illustrating', 'how', 'deluded', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'film', 'how', '35mm', 'filming', 'delusions', 'Video', 'footage', 'reality', 'one', 'point', 'commentary', 'even', 'talks', 'article', 'where', 'place', 'had', 'serious', 'delusion', 'problem.What', 'earth', 'director', 'think', 'one', 'disabuse', 'escapist', 'stuff', 'little', 'fun', 'One', 'can', 'hope', 'never', 'entertainment', 'gig', 'again.Thankfully', 'studio', 'done', '5-6', 'weeks', 'release', 'recover', 'spookiness', 'Cuts', 'director', 'not', 'like.Anyway', 'structure', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'commentary', 'enough', 'illustrate', 'also', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'somewhat', 'awry', 'Very', 'little', 'Directors', 'cut', 'film', 'anything', 'supernatural', 'whatsoever', 'director', 'wanted', 'essay', 'mass', 'delusion.Anyways', 'watch', 'least', 'even', 'have', 'very', 'reductionist', 'director']",N/A

Also, this DVD has one of the best director commentaries.  The reason: first, Berlinger goes in depth to the story and basically explains what's happening throughout each scene and describes to you the who, what, where, when, why and how in relationship to the characters and how it ties with the original movie.  Second, I know a lot of people dissed this movie in theatres but there is more to this movie than what they saw in the theatres and this DVD gives plenty of information without overloading the DVD with too many unnecessary &quot;extras.&quot;  I was really impressed by that since so many DVD's included way too many trailers and stupid featurettes and lame deleted scenes.  Third, based on the commentary-you can really see why the director did not want to add or subtract anything from this movie for the simple fact that it sits really well as it's own.

Cobb ""Shameless Reductionist""","[19, 26]","The negative reviews below and at IMDB almost dissuaded me from seeing Book of Shadows, but my girlfriend overruled me.  I was therefore rather pleasantly surprised (if one can be about a horror movie) to find that it was a quite reasonable sequel to The Blair Witch Project.  Like the first movie, it was more creepy and unnerving than horrifying.  There was a bit more blood than in the first, but not much, and less profanity.  The soundtrack was good (if you're into harsh rock), as was the cinematography.There were the usual problems with horror movies, like why are the characters so clueless, e.g. the psychic chick's ability was quite powerful when it didn't matter, and non-existent when it did.  The film also suffered from the usual hard-act-to-follow problem facing all sequels, but if it didn't offer anything new, neither did it fail to live up to the other's standards.  The characters were as ordinary as those in the first movie; on the one hand, you don't particularly care for them, but on the other, they're just normal screwed-up kids, and hardly deserve their sorry fate.What I don't understand are other reviewers' complaints about the Wiccan chick's stilted dialogue (of course she was affected, that's expected for a wannabe Wiccan), and the film's initial statement of being a &quot;reenactment&quot; (that was just to distinguish it from the first movie, which was actually &quot;real&quot; footage).  On the other hand, some other reviewers have mentioned that the film had good special effects--like what, the makeup?  There were minimal special effects, but good cinematography, if the two can be separated.Life being short, I would not put this movie on my must-see list, but I would say that most people who appreciate horror movies should appreciate this one.",3,A Decent Sequel,979948800,"01 20, 2001",2001,1793,"['negative', 'reviews', 'IMDB', 'almost', 'dissuaded', 'seeing', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'girlfriend', 'overruled', 'was', 'therefore', 'rather', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'find', 'was', 'quite', 'reasonable', 'sequel', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'creepy', 'unnerving', 'horrifying', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'blood', 'first', 'not', 'much', 'less', 'profanity', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'good', ""'re"", 'harsh', 'rock', 'was', 'cinematography.There', 'were', 'usual', 'problems', 'horror', 'movies', 'why', 'are', 'characters', 'so', 'clueless', 'e.g', 'psychic', 'chick', 'ability', 'was', 'quite', 'powerful', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'non-existent', 'when', 'did', 'film', 'also', 'suffered', 'usual', 'hard-act-to-follow', 'problem', 'facing', 'sequels', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'new', 'neither', 'did', 'fail', 'live', 'up', 'other', 'standards', 'characters', 'were', 'as', 'ordinary', 'first', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'other', ""'re"", 'just', 'normal', 'screwed-up', 'kids', 'hardly', 'deserve', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'are', 'other', 'reviewers', 'complaints', 'Wiccan', 'chick', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'course', 'was', 'affected', 'expected', 'wannabe', 'Wiccan', 'film', 'initial', 'statement', 'being', 'quot', 'reenactment', 'quot', 'was', 'just', 'distinguish', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'footage', 'other', 'hand', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'what', 'makeup', 'were', 'minimal', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'cinematography', 'two', 'can', 'be', 'separated.Life', 'being', 'short', 'would', 'not', 'put', 'movie', 'must-see', 'list', 'would', 'say', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'horror', 'movies', 'should', 'appreciate', 'one']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","It's true that ""Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2"" doesn't come close to the original, but it's also true that it's not nearly the piece of dreck it's reputed to be.  It's a solid movie that probably would have come off better if its script had been tweaked just enough so as to present this as a movie Similar to the original ""Blair Witch Project"" but not having any direct connection to it.  And that's because its biggest faults aren't in its inherent structure but in how short it falls of the first movie, and more importantly in how ineffectively it relates to the first movie.In ""Book Of Shadows"" the original ""Blair Witch Project"" is presented as having been the actual video camera footage of its characters released as a theatrical movie, and a whole cult of obsessed fans has sprouted up around it.  Naturally, the woods where the original events took place has become some sort of weird hybrid between a revered shrine and a mega-cool party place to the following's most, uh, Unhealthily obsessed adherents, and a number of them end up running into the same horrors as the characters from the first movie did.  Here's where the movie's greatest failing comes into play: it attempts to explain what ""The Blair Witch Project"" left unexplained and presented cryptic hints at, and, for me anyway, what ""Book Of Shadows"" seems to present as its explanations just falls so far short of the vague concepts the original hinted at.  It was a tall order to attempt to do this, and the cast and crew all do fully competent jobs, but it just didn't click.  Not to me, anyway.""Book Of Shadows"" is most effective in its earlier portions, when everything is still up in the air.  There are some cool enigmas presented early on (that you really have to look for to spot - very well done on that front), and it is a creepy experience right through, but in the end I had a sense of ""That's it?  THAT's really all it was about?""  I think it could have come off better either drawing to a close ten minutes earlier or extending on another half-hour or so and building up something bigger and more mysterious; or if not more mysterious then a revelation that hits with some kind of more powerful impact.I didn't actually dislike it; it's well done in every aspect except for the 'answers/unanswered' section of what and how much to explain, and even there I've seen much worse.  In its favor the movie Was a disturbing, often quite tense, experience, with effective gore and jolts, pretty good characterization, and fully effective performances on the part of the cast.  Given that I would have been more highly impressed if I'd seen it first - without the brilliance of its predecessor for it to try to live up to - or if it had been done differently enough to not be a Blair Witch movie at all and therefore to not have anything for its slightly lacklustre ending scenes to threaten to dilute, I'm giving it a three star rating anyway.  It's a good solid movie in its own right, and any dilution of the original's potency can be easily erased with a rewatch of the original, or simply walking the woods, recalling ""Blair Witch""'s freakiest moments, and waiting for a twig to snap somewhere and really set the mood.A fine effort considering the difficult job the filmmakers cut out for themselves.",3,"A Comedown, But Much Better Than Its Reputation",1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,3286,"['true', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'Blair', 'Witch', '2', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'original', 'also', 'true', 'not', 'nearly', 'piece', 'dreck', 'reputed', 'be', 'solid', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'better', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'tweaked', 'just', 'enough', 'so', 'present', 'movie', 'Similar', 'original', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'not', 'having', 'direct', 'connection', 'biggest', 'faults', 'are', ""n't"", 'inherent', 'structure', 'how', 'short', 'first', 'movie', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'ineffectively', 'first', 'movie.In', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'original', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'presented', 'having', 'been', 'actual', 'video', 'camera', 'footage', 'characters', 'released', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'whole', 'cult', 'obsessed', 'fans', 'sprouted', 'up', 'Naturally', 'woods', 'where', 'original', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'become', 'sort', 'weird', 'hybrid', 'revered', 'shrine', 'mega-cool', 'party', 'place', 'following', 'most', 'uh', 'Unhealthily', 'obsessed', 'adherents', 'number', 'end', 'up', 'running', 'same', 'horrors', 'characters', 'first', 'movie', 'did', 'Here', 'where', 'movie', 'greatest', 'failing', 'play', 'explain', 'what', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'left', 'unexplained', 'presented', 'cryptic', 'hints', 'anyway', 'what', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'present', 'explanations', 'just', 'falls', 'so', 'far', 'short', 'vague', 'concepts', 'original', 'hinted', 'was', 'tall', 'order', 'attempt', 'do', 'cast', 'crew', 'do', 'fully', 'competent', 'jobs', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'Not', 'anyway', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'most', 'effective', 'earlier', 'portions', 'when', 'everything', 'still', 'up', 'air', 'are', 'cool', 'enigmas', 'presented', 'early', 'really', 'have', 'look', 'spot', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'front', 'creepy', 'experience', 'right', 'end', 'had', 'sense', 'THAT', 'really', 'was', 'about', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'better', 'either', 'drawing', 'close', 'ten', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'extending', 'half-hour', 'so', 'building', 'up', 'something', 'bigger', 'more', 'mysterious', 'not', 'more', 'mysterious', 'then', 'revelation', 'kind', 'more', 'powerful', 'impact.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'dislike', 'well', 'done', 'aspect', ""'answers/unanswered"", 'section', 'what', 'how', 'much', 'explain', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'much', 'worse', 'favor', 'movie', 'Was', 'disturbing', 'often', 'quite', 'tense', 'experience', 'effective', 'gore', 'jolts', 'pretty', 'good', 'characterization', 'fully', 'effective', 'performances', 'part', 'cast', 'Given', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'highly', 'impressed', ""'d"", 'seen', 'first', 'brilliance', 'predecessor', 'try', 'live', 'up', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'movie', 'therefore', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'slightly', 'lacklustre', 'ending', 'scenes', 'threaten', 'dilute', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'anyway', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'dilution', 'original', 'potency', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'erased', 'rewatch', 'original', 'simply', 'walking', 'woods', 'recalling', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'freakiest', 'moments', 'waiting', 'twig', 'snap', 'somewhere', 'really', 'set', 'mood.A', 'fine', 'effort', 'considering', 'difficult', 'job', 'filmmakers', 'cut', 'out']",N/A

Think of this as just 'Book of Shadows', not a sequel...Joe B. is a smart filmmaker, and at least this movie offers us something than the usual slasher fare; There are some truly unsettling developments in this movie; The production, art design, and acting are much better than most. I was most impressed with the reactions of the characters during the final 15 minutes of the movie, when things really start to fall apart; One of the last scenes involves a certain character(this is NOT a spolier....)screaming that what he had just saw on tape was not what he had seen himself in person; His reaction was just like mine would have been, and it was pretty intense to say the least.

The director's approach was too minimal, and the studio's interference too ridiculous, making a movie ""neither fish nor fowl,"" not true to the director's vision or the studio's desire.

It was based on true police records of things that happened after &quot;The Blair Witch Project.&quot; About 5 &quot;obsesed movie fans&quot; going out into where the Blair Witch supposedly is. They black out and find the footage of what they were doing. When they all start to turn on each other, some of them get killed, and the remaining ones get arrested with fake video footage. And believe me, I tryed to keep it so I don't tell you the whole movie, so there is still a lot more in the movie itself. There are ghost images in outakes and in the feature itself, which was the part that really creeped me. The ghost images were supposed to be by the Blair witch, who we actually see in the movie. I'm not that stupid. Those images were real and couldn't have been made to form locks like a pentigram or show a face of a victim in the window.

From the hilariously bad acting to the horrible editing and the even worse directing, this movie was just plain and simply bad.  Sometimes I don't understand why good movies need sequels.  Yes, there have been darn good sequels like The Godfather, Lethal Weapon, and in my opinion the second Jaws.  If you are going to make a sequel, don't just make one to make one.  Spend a couple years on it, and actually make it a real movie by itself instead of taking everything that worked in the original and using in it.  Well, Blair Witch 2 took nothing from the original besides the premise.  Usually sequels go back to the same environment as the first, but this movie took a totally different approach.  That isn't such a bad idea, but it just didn't work.  Also, there are some very disturbing scenes, which I think added to the demise of the movie.  They had no establishing shot, which made it very hard to know what the heck was going on.  I really can't think of anything positive to say about this movie.  Overall, Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows is another typical sequel that fails in every way to entertain you and make you come away with a sense of time well spent.  1 Star",1,Just plain bad,983577600,"03 3, 2001",2001,1257,"['Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'way', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'hilariously', 'bad', 'acting', 'horrible', 'editing', 'even', 'worse', 'directing', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'simply', 'bad', 'Sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'good', 'movies', 'need', 'sequels', 'Yes', 'have', 'been', 'darn', 'good', 'sequels', 'Godfather', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'opinion', 'second', 'Jaws', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'sequel', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'one', 'make', 'one', 'Spend', 'couple', 'years', 'actually', 'make', 'real', 'movie', 'instead', 'taking', 'everything', 'worked', 'original', 'using', 'Well', 'Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'took', 'nothing', 'original', 'premise', 'Usually', 'sequels', 'go', 'back', 'same', 'environment', 'first', 'movie', 'took', 'totally', 'different', 'approach', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'idea', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Also', 'are', 'very', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'think', 'added', 'demise', 'movie', 'had', 'establishing', 'shot', 'made', 'very', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'going', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'positive', 'say', 'movie', 'Overall', 'Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'typical', 'sequel', 'way', 'entertain', 'make', 'come', 'away', 'sense', 'time', 'well', 'spent', '1', 'Star']",N/A

There are so many things wrong with this movie that I can not even begin to describe it.  Lets start with the plot.The story takes place one year after the first (Typical) and after a few interviews with the residence of Birkettsville we find out that they are taking the ingural tour of the Blair Witch Project.  From there we are overwhelmed with random scenes of violence, nudity, gore, and stupidity.  THere are around 8 killings which ranks up to a typical 80's slasher film.I don't even know who stars in thsi piece of trash.  Obviously peopl who can't act because it is that bad.The movie stole effect ideas primarily from Event Horizon, House on Haunted Hill, and Blair Witch 1 and it is easily obviouse that they stole effects ideas from other movies as well.To wrap things up simply avoid this movie, it is not worth the time or effort to sit through and watch.

It deals with events after the first movie, and with the consequences of the first movie, and that's the only thing that makes it a sequel to The Blair Witch Project. It has the same concept though- a bunch of people go into the woods and are really messed up by the forces of pure, dark evil ( oh, those wacky Wiccans ). I loved the Blair Witch Project. I thought it was the very best and the very scariest horror movie ever made. And this movie ? It was one of the most disturbing horror movies ever made. In it we see a miscarriage, insanity, bloodshed...Yes, we've seen these things before in movies. But... The Book of Shadows is different. It is deeply, deeply disturbing and unsettling. But it doesn't leave you feeling dirty or unclean.The Book of Shadows is also a lot smoother than the Blair Witch Project, and a lot slicker. The first movie was rough and erratic, bouncing and shivering its way along. This one slips and slides... not on the surface of your skin, but in your bone marrow. If you liked the original movie, you might despise this movie. You might hate every single second of The Book of Shadows. And if you didn't like the original movie ? You might love this one. And if you haven't seen the original movie ? You might also love The Book of Shadows. Or you might hate it. There's only one way to find out.
