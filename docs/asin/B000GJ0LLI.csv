1005052,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000GJ0LLI,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 2]","After a plethora of inspirational sports' movies, some of the masses may be getting tired.  Inspirational, like many, but more tightly woven than most, `Goal!  The Dream Begins' is a foot ahead of most sports' films. This time we're offered a different venue.  Soccer may not be a convincing viewers' choice, but most jock movies since `Hoosiers' know how to tell a good story.  This film excels at getting our attention, gives us believable dialogue that won't make most cynics cringe, and provides an underdog character we easily care about.Such is the trek of Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker) whom we see as a boy crossing the Mexican border with his family into the US as an illegal immigrant.  Narrowly escaping the border patrol, we poignantly see his father ordering him to leave his soccer ball behind and hurry up.  This practical tension sets up the family drama.  Fast forward ten years,  and we see him grown up, and his family is divided.  Living in Los Angeles, the Munez family must live on small means with manual labor and a paternal household where the mother has abandoned the family.  Santiago shares a bedroom with his much younger brother, and the grandmother gives everyone a boost with her devout presence.  As with so many sports' underdog movies, the father is against his son becoming a pro ball player.  Here it isn't clear whether he's a practical skeptic (like in 'The Greatest Game') or a jealous man.  We can't judge him too harshly, for he has his own dream coming to fruition:  his own construction business.One day Santiago is spotted by British soccer team manager, Glen Foy (Stephen Dillane),  who wants to acquire him to his UK team.  His dreams are truncated by his father, but fostered by the grandmother.  (Is there ever going to be a movie where the father supports his underdog son?  I'm sure there are already, but we are short of them.)  Anyway, great developments occur as he gets acclimated to his new English team, playing for New Castle.  His first practice is hardly stellar.  In the cold, English rains, he is out of his league.  The language barrier, which most Americans would struggle with, demonstrate a foreign English.  (Some colorful British expressions will be lost on the American audience.  Most did on me.)  Merciless teammates are intolerant of their foreign acquisition and give it to him for his lack of immediate progress in ethnic terms.  Jaime and Kevin round out the group and give him enough slack, with Foy's line of second chances, to deliver him a shot at his dream.  In the meantime, ""Santi,"" as he becomes known, fancies a beautiful nurse; one who brings out the best in him and is unwilling to consummate a relationship with a potential star.  ""It's not footballers I have a problem with.,"" she explains,  ""It's the fame.""  With Kevin's ego, Santi almost takes a plummet, but at least he survives.  Watch this beautiful movie, and see how well it all flies.`Goal!..` is easily a crowd pleaser, but it wins for craftsmanship and good form.  The acting is good, the editing is judicious, and the story weaves its way to the goal line.  (Alessandro Nivola, who plays Kevin, makes a special transformation from the passionate man, David in 'Junebug' to the egotistical soccer star, doing  more than changing accents.)  Music usually accentuates sports' movies well, but I have a particular affection for the special way the alternative music and the score pump adrenaline and weave sentiment into the various scenes.  'Goal!  The Dream Begins' wins on many levels.  (Excellent entertainment.)",4,'Goal!

1005053,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000GJ0LLI,A Customer,"[24, 26]","Slickly made and featuring a terrifically involving performance from its lead man Kuno Becker, Goal is the epitome of a your rags-to-riches fairy tale, a truly romanticized ode to improbable dreams. Thankfully, the direction and performances are good enough to get us through the progressively hackneyed storyline and a screenplay that seems intent to offer up almost every single clich&eacute; in the book.Illegally crossing into America as a child, Santiago Mu&ntilde;ez, grows up in the barrio of East Los Angeles, sure of only one thing - his indelible love of soccer and that one day he wants to do something with his talent. He supports himself by working as a kitchen hand in a Chinese restaurant and as a gardener for his blue-collar dad, Hernan (Tony Plana) who tells him to stop dreaming and focus on supporting his family.Glen Foy (Stephen Dillane) - a part-time talent scout and a former championship footballer with contacts in U.K. soccer world - spots Santiago playing and manages to persuade Erik Dornhelm (Marcel Iures), the German manager of Newcastle United, to give Santiago a tryout if he comes to the U.K.With the help of his kindly grandmother (Miriam Colon), who tells him ""to follow his dream,"" Santiago arrives in London, takes the train north and turns up unannounced on Glen's doorstep. Now in the cold and rainy Northeast England, Santiago has a month to prove himself worthy of playing alongside the cocky playboy David Beckham-like star Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola).Apart from the obviously clich&eacute;d look of the film - Los Angeles is filmed in shades of burnt out orange and the UK is constantly awash in rainy washed-out blue - the poor Santiago is faced with many hurdles and indeed looks like an exotic looking fish out of water as he fights to stay on the reserve soccer team and achieve his inevitable path towards football glory.The drama comes from the fact that he keeps mucking up. He's not used to playing in the rain and mud and there's the problem with his asthma that he keeps secret from Dornhelm and the attractive team nurse (Anna Friel) whom he has a crush on. He's on the team and then he's off the team, then there's a tragedy at home which forces him to rethink his priorities, and then he's faced with the inevitable moral choice of being an upright young man rather than party with the irresponsible Gavin.The stereotypical characters are all here - the conceited and uncaring agent, the kindly grandma, the love-interest nurse, the cheering coach, the nasty team member, the truculent father, the quietly supportive kid brother. The film starts off very strong - the best scenes are those set in Los Angeles - but the story steadily begins to hinge on contrived coincidences and eventually starts to look like one long training session.Becker is the main reason to see this film - he's an actor with a big future, a charming, ruggedly fine-looking presence, and even though his playing scenes are clearly doubled, we get a strong feel for the character both on and off the pitch.Of course, we do get caught up in it all as the film surges to its astonishingly predicable conclusion, which mainly tugs at the heartstrings because this fine cast has managed to earn our sympathy. Perhaps the next two installments of this story - yes, there's a Goal 2 and 3 soon to be released! - will generate a bit more invention and creativity and finally make this franchise of Santiago's journey, a story that we can truly root for.

Erland,"[5, 5]","Synopsis: Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker) is a twenty-something Hispanic illegal (or should I say ""undocumented alien"") living with his Grandmother, Father and little brother in downtown Los Angeles. He works with his Father as a gardener during the day, hustles as a bus boy in a Chinese restaurant in the evening and plays soccer in the park whenever he can fit it in. Santiago is a superior player but his talent and potential seems to be taking him nowhere until he comes under the scrutiny of an ex-professional English soccer player Gavin (Alessandro Nivola). After a couple of brief encounters between the two Gavin convinces Santiago to come to England and play for United, a first division team. If Santiago can pay for his own plane faire Gavin promises the boy a try-out. As you've already guessed Santiago makes the journey and gets his big opportunity. The only question is can he perform up to expectations?`The Goal' is an entertaining, inspiring sports film about seizing the day and having the courage to pursue one's dreams no matter what the cost. While it doesn't quite deliver the emotional impact of  `Rudy' or `Miracle,' it's still well worth the watch. Kuno Becker is good-looking and likeable in the role of Santiago, you'll find yourself rooting for him in no time.

It's the same rags to riches/Cinderella story, but with a football/soccer bent to it. Now depending on how the movie plays out, it could've been a very bad thing. But it wasn't.Goal! is about a young man, Santiago Munez, who wants to play football more than anything else. When an ex-scout sees him play & notices the sheer promise Munez has, he instantly tries to get him scouted & brought over to the UK to play professionally. Unfortunately setbacks such as poverty & an unsympathetic father stand in Munez's way. It's only after his grandmother raises the money that Munez travels to the UK... and promptly fails the promised tryout. Luckily for Munez, he's given another chance but is unaware that some of the biggest hurdles have yet to come.Like I said earlier, it would've been easy for this film to fail badly. The whole ""average Joe makes good"" thing has been done before in sports flicks. About 30 minutes into the film I couldn't help but think of 'Bend it Like Beckham'. But this film manages to pull off the Cinderella story spin well. I was able to relate to the character & I felt myself actually caring about whether or not he'd succeed, which is important for films such as this.This wasn't the greatest film I've ever seen in this genre (Beckham is far better), but it really was a nice film & I can predict that this will be a hit with many football fans & players.

1005066,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GJ0LLI,Grady Harp,"[11, 12]","Yes, this is another sports biography that offers a stage on which to play out the drama of the possibilities of dreams of the disenfranchised to become a reality.  There are many, many films like this one and will doubtless be more: something there is about the 'team spirit' in the identity crisis of whether or not the poor (financially) new guy will be able to make the physical grade that draws large audiences.  It is a formula and it often works despite weak structure and production values.In the case of GOAL! THE DREAM BEGINS the viewer can put aside the doubts as to whether the film can make it on its own: this little low profile movie is well written (Mike Jefferies's story adapted for the screen by Adrian Butchart), well directed by Danny Cannon who knows well how to integrate live sports scenes into the drama, and consistently well acted by a troop of excellent actors, beginning with the very vibrant, handsome, and charismatic Kuno Becker ('Lucia, Lucia', 'Imagining Argentina', 'Once Upon a Wedding', 'English as a Second Language'), a 28 year old Mexican actor with an assured future in the lead role of Santiago.  The supporting roles are classy contributions by the gifted Alessandro Nivola ('The Sisters', 'Junebug', 'The Clearing', 'Laurel Canyon', 'Love's Labour's Lost', 'Mansfield Park' etc), the very beautiful Anna Friel, Stephen Dillane, Marcel Iures, Tony Plana, Miriam Colon to mention only a few.The story is secondary: as a child devotee of soccer Santiago immigrates illegally into the US with his family, grows up in Los Angeles working as a gardener, a dishwasher and other menial tasks while he consumes his spare time with developing his unique talents for soccer.  Despite his father's insistence that he remain with the family business of gardening, Santiago is discovered by a scout on vacation from England, a bond develops and soon Santiago is off to Newcastle to pursue his dream of being a professional soccer player.  The rest is pretty obvious - the ups and downs of an asthmatic kid competing in the wild world of sports.  The star of the moment is Alessandro Nivola and despite the differences in their goals and social life they become friends who help each other in tender ways.  There is of course a love interest, telephone calls and encouragement form Santiago's grandmother, adjustments to life in the UK -all altering the road toward Santiago's eventually attained goal.The film is a bit lengthy (two hours) for the content, but then we understand this is the first of a trilogy, so get used to the story and the characters as they all remain constant for the next two installments. Whatever reservations you may have about sitting through another predictable sports movie just relax them: Kuno Becker alone is worth the time invested in this very fine little film.

""Goal!"" is the typical sports movie about an exceptionally talented young amateur who is given a chance to shine among the professionals and win the heart of the girl he loves. However, ""Goal!"" works this premise and makes it fresh and entertaining. Director Danny Cannon had complete support by FIFA and Newcastle United and it shows, he has created some of the most realist and remarkable football scenes in film.Kuno Becker is very good as Santiago, although at times he is overshadowed by other members of the cast. It seems as if he lacked some presence on screen. However, he is still young, and certainly will improve with the years. Alessandro Nivola steals the movie with his performance as Gavin, a notorious football star whose convoluted public life begins to take its toll in his performance in the field.Cannon's approach to the story may seem clich&eacute;d, but the movie is never boring nor tiresome. Sure, he follows every rule in ""Sport Movies Handbook"" but he does it with care, good eye and love for the sport. Just like sport movies should be done. The movie flows smoothly between remarkable football scenes and Santiago's struggle with his own personal demons. While at times it seems that both Cannon and Becker are more comfortable in sports scenes, the movie's dose of drama is well handled and completes an enjoyable experience. Even though it's frankly predictable most of the time, it transmits passion, emotions and a love for the game that few movies do. That's why ""Goal!"" can be considered a successful and important film. It is the first film about football soccer that transmits the emotions that have made the sport to be the most popular sport in the world. And that's got to be worth something.It may not be a perfect sports film; however, ""Goal!"" is the beginning of an adventure, and hopefully, of a new way to make football movies. This initial film of what is called the ""Goal! Trilogy"" delivers high energy entertainment for fans and non-fans of the sport.",4,"This may not be sparkling original, but it's well executed.",1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,2116,"['are', 'many', 'movies', 'sports', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'bad', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'category', 'Goal', 'typical', 'sports', 'movie', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'young', 'amateur', 'who', 'given', 'chance', 'shine', 'professionals', 'win', 'heart', 'girl', 'However', 'Goal', 'premise', 'fresh', 'entertaining', 'Director', 'Danny', 'Cannon', 'had', 'complete', 'support', 'FIFA', 'Newcastle', 'United', 'created', 'most', 'realist', 'remarkable', 'football', 'scenes', 'film.Kuno', 'Becker', 'very', 'good', 'Santiago', 'times', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'lacked', 'presence', 'screen', 'However', 'still', 'young', 'certainly', 'will', 'improve', 'years', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'movie', 'performance', 'Gavin', 'notorious', 'football', 'star', 'convoluted', 'public', 'life', 'take', 'toll', 'performance', 'field.Cannon', 'approach', 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'movie', 'never', 'boring', 'tiresome', 'Sure', 'rule', 'Sport', 'Movies', 'Handbook', 'care', 'good', 'eye', 'love', 'sport', 'Just', 'sport', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'movie', 'smoothly', 'remarkable', 'football', 'scenes', 'Santiago', 'struggle', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'times', 'Cannon', 'Becker', 'are', 'more', 'comfortable', 'sports', 'scenes', 'movie', 'dose', 'drama', 'well', 'handled', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Even', 'frankly', 'predictable', 'most', 'time', 'passion', 'emotions', 'love', 'game', 'few', 'movies', 'do', 'why', 'Goal', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'successful', 'important', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'football', 'soccer', 'emotions', 'have', 'made', 'sport', 'be', 'most', 'popular', 'sport', 'world', 'got', 'be', 'worth', 'something.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'sports', 'film', 'however', 'Goal', 'beginning', 'adventure', 'hopefully', 'new', 'way', 'make', 'football', 'movies', 'initial', 'film', 'what', 'called', 'Goal', 'Trilogy', 'delivers', 'high', 'energy', 'entertainment', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'sport']",N/A

1005075,A2O91YORQH16L5,B000GJ0LLI,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[0, 0]","I am not a football fan, although I had been to a real foot-ball stadium, & that was about thirty years ago. It was in Dortmund, West Germany, where I was undergoing factory training with O & K Orenstein Kopel AG.A German service engineer had invited me to watch a foot-ball match between the home team & a team from Munich, during one weekend. I can't recall who won, but to me that was the first & the last time I had seen a real foot-ball game.Since I am not a football fan, I don't watch the EPL or World Cup on television. In fact, I just don't understand why people can get so frenzy with watching foot-ball matches on television.The last time I had seen a foot-ball match on television was while watching the action movie, 'Escape to Victory'. It starred Sylvester Stallone & Michael Caine, plus a handful of real-world foot-ballers - Pele, Bobby Moore - I could not recognise the others.The movie was about a foot-ball match between a ragtag group of Allied prisoners & a German foot-ball team, which the Nazis had originally planned to promote as a propaganda event during WWII. To the chagrin of their German captors, the Allied prisoners had used the closing of the game as a brilliant escape with the spectators.Last night, after channel surfing, & also checking out the synopsis, I finally settled down to watch a movie entitled 'Goal! The Dream Begins'.Frankly, all the actors or actress in the movie were unknown, at least to me, with the exception of Tony Plana, whom I last saw as the prison warden in the action movie, 'Half Past Dead', opposite Steven Seagal, who played an undercover agent.In a nutshell, the movie traced the exploits of a young Mexican immigrant, Santiago Nunez (played by Huno Decker, a Latin American actor) from Los Angeles, working in the building maintenance crew with his divorced father (played by Tony Plana).He often dreamed of becoming an international foot-ball star. In fact, he spent most of his evenings in street-corner matches.One day, while dribbling with his ball, he was spotted by Glen, a visiting talent scout from UK, who was a retired foot-ball player with Premiership Club Newcastle United.Glen called his ex-boss/club manager, Erik, to inform him of his talent finding. Erik agreed to give the young man an opportunity, & Glen invited Santiago to come to UK.Santiago's hard-headed father was dead against the whole idea, as he believed that the entire family could only made it through hard-work by setting up their own building maintenance business. To discourage the son, the father even snatched part of the son's own meagre savings to pump into the new business.Fortunately, his grand-mother was supportive of his dreams, & managed to get him an air-ticket & some cash to fly to UK via Mexico city.Upon arrival, he got in touch with Glen, who invited him to stay in his private home. Glen then arranged for him to go for his ""screen test"" under the watchful eye of Erik.It was raining heavily that fateful day, & the foot-ball grounds were a muddy mess, & so poor Santiago flunked his first ""screen test"".Glen pleaded to Erik to give the young man a chance. Santiago got one month to prove himself.At this point, the movie traced his trials & tribulations as a rookie in the premiership club. As usual in most movies, he also got romantically entangled with a beautiful nurse. He also got teamed up with another newly recruited footballer, Gavin, from Germany.The latter was a night owl & party animal, who introduced him to the booze, the parties, the clubbing, & the women, often associated with the decadent lifestyle of foot-ball stars we read in the papers.Santiago (as well as Gavin) almost got kicked out of the club, if not for the unwavering support of Glen, the nurse/girl-friend, the coach, & of course, the club manager/boss, Erik, who truly saw the raw talent in the young man.It was quite fun to watch Erik showing the young man the importance of being a team player in a club, & sharing some important pointers about game discipline.I like one particular confrontation dialogue between Erik & Santiago, who uttered: ""The only one who can tell me I'm not good enough is you. And even then I may not agree with you.""Of course, the movie ended with a critical match in London, where both Santiago & Gavin finally demonstrated their natural ballistic prowess with their heads & legs.I have really enjoyed watching the movie. Despite some minor technical goofs here & there, & from an overall standpoint, it has been entertaining & warm to watch. Interestingly, David Beckham had a cameo role in the movie.For me, it also has many interesting learning points.In the course of pursuing our fondest dreams, one should always remember all the people who cared, especially those who have extended their encouragement &/or help in one way or another as we move forward.In the case of Santiago, his grand-mother, his mentor in the person of Glen, his girl-friend, his coach in the club, & of course, the club manager/boss, Erik, all played their contributing part in his journey to personal success.Even his hard-headed father, who often refused to acknowledge the son's phone calls whenever the latter had called home, had drilled into him the importance of standing up for himself, with no excuses whatsoever.In fact, the father was very proud of his son, when he happened to witness one of his son's foot-ball matches on television, while visiting a local pub in Los Angeles.This important fact was only made known to Santiago by the grandmother, after the father had died of a sudden heart attack on a job site.

If you belong to the first category, don't miss this film: it is not overly original, but it is pretty entertaining and dynamic, managing to transmit at least part of the energy and passion that we associate with soccer. In case you belong to the second category, it is high time you learn at least something about soccer, specially now that the 2006 World Cup is about to begin :)The plot is simple, but good. The main character is Santiago Mu&ntilde;ez (Kuno Becker), a young immigrant from Mexico that lives in Los Angeles. Santiago loves to play soccer, but works as a gardener with his father in order to earn money for his family. One day, a scout sees him in a game and is thoroughly impressed, so much so that he ends up offering Santiago a try out at an important English club, Newcastle United. Santiago is enormously happy, but his father isn't, because he thinks that Santiago is just being foolish. On the other hand, Santiago's grandmother and his brother are fully supportive of whatever Santiago decides to do. What will happen? Will Santiago be able to follow his dream? Of course, if you want the answers to those questions, watch this film!On the whole, I can say that ""Goal"" is a very well-made film about soccer, family, friendship and above all, the importance of following your dreams.

We've been here before but we've never been here before with the charismatic Kuno Becker.Becker is the real reason to see ""Goal"" and his arrival on the international film scene is on par with that of any important actor in the last few years. What is special about Becker is his seeming lack of attitude and supposed entitlement that so many of today's crop of young actors possess.Becker's Santiago is committed to his family, intelligent, wise, career-minded and generally a good guy. Of course, all of this can be attributed in part to the script but most of the success of this character and of this film can be placed on Becker's young shoulders. Becker imbues Santiago with a heartfelt sunny-ness and positivity that is infectious as well as emotionally open and available.""Goal: The Dream Begins"" is not an earth shaking film per se but it is a hell of  a lot of fun to watch.

Putting aside his status as an illegal immigrant, he saves his earnings so he can try out for a major soccer team.Then one day, a man from England sees him playing Soccer. He is impressed at how well Munez plays. After the game, he offers him the chance to go to England and try out for the team. His grandmother encourages thim to ignore his non-believing father and just go, offering him the money.While in the UK, Munez learns that it's not easy being a big-name soccer player. And he learns it the hard way- he has trouble playing in the rain, he has trouble with his severe asthma, and a death in the family causes some drama.This film is of course cliched and predictable- LA is depicted with an orange tint, England is depicted with a rainy, cold washed-out blue tint, the stereotypical characters all come into effect at one point, and the finale is predictable as hell. But the way the movie is done, it's done in a way that you wouldn't care about that- you;d just really be blown away by how amazingly well done it is. And I must say, if this movie doesn't make you wanna go to England, who knows what will.Do not miss this movie, even if you don't like soccer.

So given all that why did I enjoy this so much?First Kuno Becker gives a fine performance in the lead role as a young Mexican immigrant in Los Angeles who is spotted playing park football and ends up in the English Premier League. Second- The film is unusual in the dual settings of Los Angeles and Newcastle, UK. Third- The football sequences are well done and feature cameos by numerous big name players and the depiction of game day at St Jame's park in Newcastle is incredibly cool.Finally, for a soccer fan living in the LA area how can you not be drawn into a film that deals with both your hometown and your favorite sport.",4,Cliche filled -but very good anyway,1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,980,"['Most', 'sports', 'movies', 'fall', 'seen', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'category', 'Goal', 'fairly', 'typical', 'sports', 'movie', 'story', 'underdog', 'who', 'odds', 'make', 'big', 'even', 'get', 'girl', 'end', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'here', 'loving', 'grandmother', 'tough', 'father', 'conceited', 'superstar', 'stern', 'coach', 'adoring', 'younger', 'brother', 'So', 'given', 'why', 'did', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'First', 'Kuno', 'Becker', 'fine', 'performance', 'lead', 'role', 'young', 'Mexican', 'immigrant', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'who', 'spotted', 'playing', 'park', 'football', 'up', 'English', 'Premier', 'League', 'Second-', 'film', 'unusual', 'dual', 'settings', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Newcastle', 'UK', 'Third-', 'football', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'feature', 'cameos', 'numerous', 'big', 'name', 'players', 'depiction', 'game', 'day', 'St', 'Jame', 'park', 'Newcastle', 'incredibly', 'cool.Finally', 'soccer', 'fan', 'living', 'LA', 'area', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'drawn', 'film', 'hometown', 'favorite', 'sport']",N/A

But it's not something you need to rush out and see.Santiago is a Mexican kid you illegally comes to the US with his family.  While playing soccer in a park he gets noticed by a former scout from England who promises to get him a tryout with Newcastle United.  Of course there are obstacles for Santiago, including a lack of funds and a dad who just wants his son to give up on his dream and help him start his own lawn service company.  Santiago overcomes these obstacles, as well as some the film doesn't tackle--like how does he get a passport to get into England?If you think things are easy once he makes it to the tryout then you obviously haven't seen many sports films.  Santiago has several screw ups that almost prevent him from making the team.  The plot of the film is whether or not Santiago will overcome these extra obstacles (with the help of a girl and a player looking for redemption) and make it onto the field so he can triumph in a big game.Again, you can probably figure out where this one is going in the first five minutes, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.

1005097,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000GJ0LLI,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 13]","`Goal!' is part of the trilogy that will be concluded the next year, featuring the ambitious football player Santiago Munez. The likable hero is played by Mexican actor Kuno Becker who was impressive in `Lucia Lucia.' American actor Alessandro Nivola plays the role of the star player of Newcastle United Gavin Harris while from UK side Stephen Dillane, Anna Friel, and Sean Pertwee appear.As a little boy Santiago and his family moved to Los Angles illegally from Mexico. Now a grown-up and working with his father, Santiago is also a gifted soccer player in the local team and his talent is found by one English traveler Glen Foy (Dillane). Foy leaves his card, and tells Santiago that if he wants to be a professional football player, he should come to Newcastle, England.If I say Santiago really flies to this northeast industrial city, helped by his kind-hearted grandmother, it would not be a spoiler anyway because `Goal!' gives away where it is going from the very beginning. It treads well-known course of popular rags-to-riches story, and in spite of that formula - or because of that formula - the film works as enjoyable football version of fairy tale. Well, sort of. Of course, those who watches the football games in Europe every week would know that his success comes too easy, and these days the process of becoming a pro football player is more complicated. But I didn't hate the story.No, what I didn't like is not that part; it is the football sequences that are not convincing enough to me. Don't get me wrong here because the film captures the atmosphere of the pitch very well. However, despite the clever choice of Newcastle, and its powerful footages of the football games and its enthusiastic fans (and they are real ones as the film wisely secured the approval from every party involved, including FIFA), the scenes where Kuno Becker plays are obviously helped by editing and special effects. Becker does his best, and I like his character and his (too) straightforward approach to it, but the gaps between his scenes and those of the real game are too conspicuous.And there are cameos from real football players like Beckham and Zidane. It is surely amusing to see them delivering their lines rather awkwardly.Football, or soccer, is no stranger to films, and you may remember films like John Huston-directed `Victory,' `Mean Machine,' and of course `Bend it Like Beckham' with Keira Knightley  The city of Newcastle, its football team and its dedicated supporters can also be seen in `Purely Belter."" But as far as I can remember, `Goal!' is the first example of a film that takes up football game itself as the theme and presents it as entertainment. It is a success, but I cannot be sure whether the second one can keep up with the expectation of the fans now eagerly watching the World Cup worldwide.",3,Entertaining Rags-to-Riches Story,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,2831,"['Goal', 'part', 'trilogy', 'will', 'be', 'concluded', 'next', 'year', 'featuring', 'ambitious', 'football', 'player', 'Santiago', 'Munez', 'likable', 'hero', 'played', 'Mexican', 'actor', 'Kuno', 'Becker', 'who', 'was', 'impressive', 'Lucia', 'Lucia', 'American', 'actor', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'role', 'star', 'player', 'Newcastle', 'United', 'Gavin', 'Harris', 'UK', 'side', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'little', 'boy', 'Santiago', 'family', 'moved', 'Los', 'Angles', 'illegally', 'Mexico', 'Now', 'grown-up', 'working', 'father', 'Santiago', 'also', 'gifted', 'soccer', 'player', 'local', 'team', 'talent', 'found', 'one', 'English', 'traveler', 'Glen', 'Foy', 'Dillane', 'Foy', 'card', 'tells', 'Santiago', 'be', 'professional', 'football', 'player', 'should', 'come', 'Newcastle', 'England.If', 'say', 'Santiago', 'really', 'northeast', 'industrial', 'city', 'helped', 'kind-hearted', 'grandmother', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'spoiler', 'anyway', 'Goal', 'away', 'where', 'going', 'very', 'beginning', 'well-known', 'course', 'popular', 'rags-to-riches', 'story', 'spite', 'formula', 'formula', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'football', 'version', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Well', 'sort', 'course', 'who', 'watches', 'football', 'games', 'Europe', 'week', 'would', 'know', 'success', 'too', 'easy', 'days', 'process', 'becoming', 'pro', 'football', 'player', 'more', 'complicated', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'story.No', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'not', 'part', 'football', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'convincing', 'enough', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'here', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'pitch', 'very', 'well', 'However', 'clever', 'choice', 'Newcastle', 'powerful', 'footages', 'football', 'games', 'enthusiastic', 'fans', 'are', 'real', 'ones', 'film', 'wisely', 'secured', 'approval', 'party', 'involved', 'including', 'FIFA', 'scenes', 'where', 'Kuno', 'Becker', 'plays', 'are', 'obviously', 'helped', 'editing', 'special', 'effects', 'Becker', 'best', 'like', 'character', 'too', 'straightforward', 'approach', 'gaps', 'scenes', 'real', 'game', 'are', 'too', 'conspicuous.And', 'are', 'cameos', 'real', 'football', 'players', 'Beckham', 'Zidane', 'surely', 'amusing', 'see', 'delivering', 'lines', 'rather', 'awkwardly.Football', 'soccer', 'stranger', 'films', 'may', 'remember', 'films', 'John', 'Huston-directed', 'Victory', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'course', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'city', 'Newcastle', 'football', 'team', 'dedicated', 'supporters', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'Purely', 'Belter', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'remember', 'Goal', 'first', 'example', 'film', 'up', 'football', 'game', 'theme', 'entertainment', 'success', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'sure', 'second', 'one', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'expectation', 'fans', 'now', 'eagerly', 'watching', 'World', 'Cup', 'worldwide']",N/A
