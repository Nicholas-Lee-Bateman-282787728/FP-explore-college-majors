All of his children are successful and a little shallow. Suzy Amis has a field day as the &#34;wild child&#34; youngest daugther, who can't keep track of her very temporary male conquests during the course of the weekend. There are some amazing stars that fill out the fictional Rockwell clan; my favorite character is played by Kevin Spacey as a stand-up comic who has lost the ability to be funny. The best parts of the movie are Levi's (Lancaster's) interaction with his grandchildren (most notably a young and adorable McCaulley Caulkin during his &#34;Uncle Buck&#34; stage).

It should be a top choice in several categories: *facing the end of life* - - *intergenerational relationships* - -  *having one's dying wishes respected?**Rocket Gibraltar*  is so special that people who believe in its message must become evangelistic in the best sense of that word  - -  *go forth* to their friends and neighbors, urging them to watch & discuss.  Burt Lancaster is a marvel, portraying the grandfather facing death. He convinces his young grandkids (the youngest, Macaulay Culkin,  gives a wonderfully dear performance) that they can help give him his dreamed-of ""send-off"" . . . His idealism (romanticism, if you like) would never receive the approval of his adult children who are at the beach for a family celebration of their dad's 77th birthday.  Viewers don't have to agree with the father's desires, or his offsprings' reactions to learn a lot from this movie. The commotion of such gatherings is perfectly shown, and also the noisy busyness of their lives that overwhelms the loving but weary father.Death is an appropriate time for sadness, but even more for thoughtful gratitude.  Reviewer mcHAIKU  gives all available stars to *Rocket Gibraltar* as a movie to re-visit regularly.
