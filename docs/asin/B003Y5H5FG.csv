1374050,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B003Y5H5FG,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","For those who remember it, Tom Holland's 1985 vampire cult classic ""Fright Night"" is truly something special. Like most beloved cinematic nuggets, a remake was only a matter of time. Enter Craig Gillespie's ""Fright Night,"" a modern update of a story that encapsulated an era of horror movies, recalling a time when movie monsters were as much fun as they were frightening.  Boasting a solid cast with the likes of Anton Yelchin, David Tennant, Toni Collette, Christopher ""McLovin"" Mintz-Plasse and Colin Farrell, this remake starts off with the best of intentions, even if its execution leaves a little something to be desired.Built on the basic framework of Holland's original story, the details of this ""Fright Night"" are pretty familiar. Likeable yet slightly nerdy Charley Brewster (Yelchin) lives in the vanilla landscape of the suburbs (this time in the Las Vegas desert) with his single mother (Collette). Trouble comes to town when his neighbor, the charming Jerry Dandridge (Farrell), turns out to be a blood-thirsty vampire. In an effort to keep his mother -- as well as his hot-to-trot girlfriend (Imogen Poots) and his jaded former best bud ""Evil"" Ed (McLovin) -- out of danger, he teams up with washed-up vampire hunter/entertainer Peter Vincent (Tennant) and sets his sights on breaking into Jerry's bachelor pad and crashing his late-night party.Similar to 2011's ""The Thing"" prequel/remake, this incarnation of ""Fright Night"" seems to have most of the ingredients for a good time in place, but unfortunately suffers from a crippling feeling that this has been done already, only much better (admittedly a problem with most remakes). Even though this particular remake distances itself a bit from the original in certain aspects, it still hits the same basic beats as the original, which sucks a lot of the would-be intensity out of the room. Also, like the aforementioned ""Thing,"" this re-do boasts an awful lot of bad CGI blood and guts that may very well have looked fine in 3D, but which doesn't serve the film very well. On the upside, all the players on hand are game and the film moves at a relatively easy pace that builds its characters as it gives way to the obligatory chase scenes. There's also a cameo midway through the film that fans of the original film will relish. All the right components are in place for this film to be one of the least offensive (and, in turn, better) remakes in recent memory (and really, it is) but it doesn't quite fire on all cylinders, making for a film that works on the surface, but ultimately isn't a patch on its source material.In the end, ""Fright Night"" is a wholly unnecessary yet admittedly entertaining remake. When one thinks of modern remakes, there are worse efforts that come to mind. Forgiven its flaws, this re-telling of a true cult classic gets the job done with minimal damage. Those who consider the original to be sacred would be best advised to steer clear, but those seeking a fun vampire romp minus the glitter could do much worse. If nothing else, it will inspire anyone who watches it to dust off a copy of the 1985 original and give it a spin (some for the hundredth time, many for the first), and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.",3,"A Remake That Doesn't Completely, For Lack of a Better Word, Suck.",1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,3226,"['who', 'remember', 'Tom', 'Holland', '1985', 'vampire', 'cult', 'classic', 'Fright', 'Night', 'truly', 'something', 'special', 'most', 'beloved', 'cinematic', 'nuggets', 'remake', 'was', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Enter', 'Craig', 'Gillespie', 'Fright', 'Night', 'modern', 'update', 'story', 'encapsulated', 'era', 'horror', 'movies', 'recalling', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'monsters', 'were', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'were', 'frightening', 'Boasting', 'solid', 'cast', 'likes', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Christopher', 'McLovin', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'remake', 'best', 'intentions', 'even', 'execution', 'little', 'something', 'be', 'desired.Built', 'basic', 'framework', 'Holland', 'original', 'story', 'details', 'Fright', 'Night', 'are', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'Likeable', 'yet', 'slightly', 'nerdy', 'Charley', 'Brewster', 'Yelchin', 'vanilla', 'landscape', 'suburbs', 'time', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'desert', 'single', 'mother', 'Collette', 'Trouble', 'town', 'when', 'neighbor', 'charming', 'Jerry', 'Dandridge', 'Farrell', 'out', 'be', 'blood-thirsty', 'vampire', 'effort', 'keep', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'hot-to-trot', 'girlfriend', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'jaded', 'former', 'best', 'bud', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'McLovin', 'danger', 'up', 'washed-up', 'vampire', 'hunter/entertainer', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'Tennant', 'sights', 'breaking', 'Jerry', 'bachelor', 'pad', 'crashing', 'late-night', 'party.Similar', '2011', 'Thing', 'prequel/remake', 'incarnation', 'Fright', 'Night', 'have', 'most', 'ingredients', 'good', 'time', 'place', 'unfortunately', 'suffers', 'crippling', 'feeling', 'been', 'done', 'already', 'only', 'much', 'better', 'admittedly', 'problem', 'most', 'remakes', 'Even', 'particular', 'remake', 'distances', 'bit', 'original', 'certain', 'aspects', 'still', 'same', 'basic', 'beats', 'original', 'lot', 'would-be', 'intensity', 'room', 'Also', 'aforementioned', 'Thing', 're-do', 'awful', 'lot', 'bad', 'CGI', 'blood', 'guts', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'looked', 'fine', '3D', ""n't"", 'serve', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'upside', 'players', 'hand', 'are', 'game', 'film', 'moves', 'relatively', 'easy', 'pace', 'characters', 'way', 'obligatory', 'chase', 'scenes', 'also', 'cameo', 'midway', 'film', 'fans', 'original', 'film', 'will', 'relish', 'right', 'components', 'are', 'place', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'least', 'offensive', 'turn', 'better', 'remakes', 'recent', 'memory', 'really', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fire', 'cylinders', 'making', 'film', 'surface', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'patch', 'source', 'material.In', 'end', 'Fright', 'Night', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'yet', 'admittedly', 'entertaining', 'remake', 'When', 'one', 'modern', 'remakes', 'are', 'worse', 'efforts', 'come', 'mind', 'Forgiven', 'flaws', 're-telling', 'true', 'cult', 'classic', 'job', 'done', 'minimal', 'damage', 'who', 'consider', 'original', 'be', 'sacred', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'advised', 'steer', 'clear', 'seeking', 'fun', 'vampire', 'romp', 'minus', 'glitter', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'nothing', 'else', 'will', 'inspire', 'anyone', 'who', 'dust', 'off', 'copy', '1985', 'original', 'give', 'spin', 'hundredth', 'time', 'many', 'first', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong']",Fright Night
1374051,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B003Y5H5FG,Amanda Pike,"[20, 61]","Where to begin?The writer made the insult that she felt Horror movie hosts are irrelevant and that no one today would understand what one is. This both insults the audience and people like Elvira and the cast of MST3K. I guess she never heard of Nostalgia Critic, Rifftrax or Mystery science Theater 3000. Another insult to the audience.  This also diminishes the portrayal by the late, great, Roddy McDowall. She thinks people today would find Charley more relatable as a social climbing tool who abandons friends for popularity. Why?The script has the character Ed make a lame joke about sexuality.The script calls everything interesting (Peter's apartment) geekyAt ComicCon,  in front of Chris Sarandon (original Jerry Dandridge in 1985) the director of the remake admits he can't remember the plot of the original. He viewed this as a ""good thing"" because it meant he could go in fresh. This shows lack of respect for Tom Holland's film and original story.  Author D.L. Warner called this unprofessional.The director of this remake couldn't recall the plot but said he remembered having nightmares from the movie as a child. He wasn't a child when the original was made. I was 3 when the movie was made and I'm almost 20 years younger than this director. This implies he's mistaking Fright Night for another movie made in the 60s and has no real recollection of it at all. I felt bad for Chris Sarandon, it was like they slapped him in front of an audience.Peter Vincent's now and unrepentant alcoholic who makes a joke about being on the ""day wagon""  near the end of the script, and only works up the courage to help drunk.  They forgot (or don't know) he was originally a nod to Peter Cushing and Peter Vincent. There is no growth for Peter Vincent.Nearly all the effects are bad CGI. Amy doesn't flinch when the windshield is smashed in front of her face. She just screams on cue.There are no nods to classic Hammer movies, as was the purpose of the original.I like the Vampires of Anne Rice, Bram Stoker, Dan Curtis, Richard Matheson and Let the Right one In. They were all different.  They weren't made boring, contrived, over-used serial killers!1985 Jerry enjoyed the hunt with cat-like instincts but there was still a human side. He tried to get Charley to look the other way. He grieved for a lost love.  Yet no humanity in this remake.  Ironic that he lost many of his powers and yet he's now more inhuman. In the remake he's a two dimensional serial killer, lacking depth or vampiric superiority.Ed says (with lines written for the trailer) that Jerry's not brooding or love-sick. He's ""The shark from Jaws.""  I don't want Jaws!  I want vampires! People have forgotten vampires can be terrifying AND seductive. Hollywood has a polarized idea that vampires can only be mindless killing machines or vegetarian Twilight rejects.  Vampires are more frightening when they have hints of humanity because it makes you uncomfortable when they do something malicious. This Jerry has no humanity.He lacks the powers of the original Jerry; the abilities to turn into a bat, mist, wolf, control weather, and enthrall . He's gained new limitations; not being able to be photographed, which doesn't even make sense because there are NO mirrors in digital cameras!He's stripped of all the powers that made him mysterious. He no longer acts like a thousand-year-old predator. He's clumsy where a teenager can find the serial killer.  ow is it this vampire wasn't found by police?Dandridge should be a vampire, not the typical ""Serial killer du jour."" He should be timeless. This guy feels...  dated. At one point Ed compliments how modern Jerry is.  He has his minion call him sir instead of master.  It's the first thing you're taught in creative writing class: Show, don't tell. Telling us he's modern is not the same as his BEING modern. And how does saying sir instead of master prove anyone is modern? The concept of masters still exist today.In the original movie Jerry was a 1000-year-old being trying to survive and he felt like he might have been a thousand.  Now he just feels like some cliche serial killer.  If they wanted a serial killer why make him a vampire at all? What was the point of removing all his powers?  Rremakes are supposed to upgrade characters, not downgrade them.  It feels as` if the many explosions (which should be investigated) were meant to distract us from just how powerless these vampires are.These vampires are like the Buffy vampires except with large mouths. She made this a Buffy Fright Night.  The original was a Dracula Fright Night. And it's just not the same. You strip powers and add more limitations and it takes away the mystique and the sense they are up against an ancient predator.Why would Jerry risk so much exposure blowing Charlie's house like that? There is always an investigation when a residential home explodes, no matter the excuse.Jerry in the original had Dracula's powers. This one is weak, can't even shape-shift or show up on camera.  New limits and less powers.  A vampire blowing a gas line and doing a car chase isn't a vampire.  It's a bad action movie villain you'd see against Arnohld.It doesn't make sense that Jerry Dandridge doesn't show up on camera. It's a digital camera. There are no mirrors in digital cameras, and besides in the original Fright Night movies the vampires COULD show up on camera. In Fright Night 2 one actually took over Peter's show.This should be ordinary people fighting ancient evil, not ordinary people fighting Jeffrey Dhomer...I like my monsters to have powers and not mimick cliche criminal archetypes because Hollywood thinks 'supernatural' isn't in anymore.

1374054,A2VFBU6CVZ2QUR,B003Y5H5FG,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","Saw this last night in the theater. Don't let the fact that it's a remake scare you into not watching it (as most remakes are infamously horrid). Overall I found the movie entertaining and fun to watch. I LOVED the original Fright Night and it's sequel but it is so dated now it's hard to watch without cringing at the cheesy '80s hairdos, clothing, and lack of technology. I loved this new version because it poked fun at everything we take for granted today, everything that is silly about our society, and even gets in a few digs at the original movie with some well-placed tongue-in-cheek lines from the original.The story line is different from the original but I liked the changes a lot. Colin Farrell makes a good, and pretty sexy, vamp! He plays the role of Jerry well and is very creepy. I don't like the fact that the writers kept the whole ""face-morphs-into-a-demon"" thingie, though. It's just weird and not very original (and definitely not sexy). Also, there wasn't as much romance in the film as there was in the original. In the original, the Amy character is the spitting image of Jerry's long-lost love so when he goes after her the story kind of makes more sense. In the new version Amy is all about Charlie. There's no portrait of her previous incarnation in Jerry's house and Jerry just goes after her to increase his ""tribe.""From the trailer one got the sense that Jerry was really out to get Charlie in some way but the whole destruction of Charlie's life seems to be more incidental in the new film, like it could have been any high-school kid Jerry chose to pick on.I have to say, I LOVED the new Peter Vincent! 1. Hot, with and without the ""Vincent persona."" 2. Not an old fogey like in the original (sorry Roddy McDowall). 3. Still makes the same change from coward to courageous as in the old version. Sigh. And tight leather pants do help! Mmm. The writers also gave Peter more of a reason to be a vampire hunter in this film but you almost don't connect him with the opening scene until the very end. The connection could have been made earlier. Also, no explanation as to why Jerry didn't kill Peter when Peter was younger. Weird.I liked the actor chosen to play Charlie's buddy Ed/Evil but you don't really get to see him too much in this version of the story. The friends' back-story is fuller than in the original movie though and you really get a feeling that Ed wants revenge on Charlie for slighting him.Special effects: Ok. Nothing spectacular except the fangs which, when not mega-demony looked exactly how I picture vampire fangs to be, sharp as all hell and retractable but not ginormous, kinda catlike. I did not see this in 3-D so take that into account.Some silly continuity problems that made me go duh! 1. Midway through the film Charlie learns that these kinds of vampires make their nests underground, yet when he busts into Jerry's house for the final showdown, Charlie wastes all this time checking out the top two floors of the house before going down to the basement.... Burning that kind of daylight when you're hunting a vamp is kinda stupid. 2. Closer to the beginning of the film, Ed/Evil is being chased by Jerry and he decides to run UPSTAIRS to escape... sigh. When the heck are movie-writers going to stop using this daft ""go-upstairs-to-get-away-from-the-bad-guy"" routine. You would think the escapee would want to remain on the ground floor! Gah! And, Ed falls into a pool (a pool) and is cornered there by Jerry. Don't get me wrong, it makes for a pretty cool underwater bite scene, but you can't get out of a pool and run? God! It's not quicksand!Car-chase scene: kinda lame. I think it would have been better in 3-D. In the original, Jerry could fly, so why the heck do they have him chasing Charlie and friends in a truck this time?I do love how they made Jerry just randomly go around biting all of Charlie's friends though. He doesn't even bother to cover up some of his kills. His inhumanity rally gives him the jollies and makes his character much more slick and vampire-like. He acts like a true predator. The Jerry in the original film was more cautious and had a Renfield-like buddy to help him out during the day. I'm not sure why this helper character was done away with in this film but I think it was a pretty good choice.

He did a great job in the original Chuckie movie to.  The thing that gets me with a lot of these newer films, is that they are extremely dark.  I find that much of the action is happening during the darkest moments and you can't really see what is going on.  There weren't that many great special effects scenes either.  You'd think they would have much better special effects being that this is almost 2012.  All they did was try to make it a bit more trendier.  Trendy is ok, but this movie just seems low budget or something.  Don't get me wrong.. I'm not saying the 80's version was perfect, but it just seemed a lot more watchable and likeable.  A lot of the movies now just computer animate.  I'd like to see a bit more creative genius, than all the computer animation and dark action.  I will admit that I am a bit vison impaired, but I found myself asking my husband what was happening much of the time.  It just wasn't as enjoyable to me as the original.

1374056,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B003Y5H5FG,Arch Stanton,"[1, 1]","I'm not trying to diss the actresses here (I've liked Toni Collete when she's playing basically the same role in several other movies, and the girlfriend has some good scenes), but everyone who's seen a horror film will know the horrible stereotypes that these women fall into. They are useless. Completely useless. Horror isn't the only genre to have its little stereotypes, but it's certainly the one that has the hardest time rising above them. I'm not sure why this should be the case except inasmuch as people have to act extremely irrationally to set up the most frightening scenes. But horror movie females have the worst time. They are always shrill and emotional, they never listen to the main character, and they generally start crying and breaking down in the most obnoxious ways at the worst possible moments. It's a stupid and sexist stereotype, and worse it's extremely annoying. They are obviously there only as a crutch for the main character so that the screenwriters can put him in situations which any sane man would avoid.This film features a particularly egregious example of that. No, I don't blame the women for not believing the lead initially. He sounds crazy and he knows it. But once they are attacked by the vampire they get even worse. He just tried to blow their house up, then he hurled a bike at their car, yet the mother can't think to drive more than twenty miles per hour down a highway in the middle of the desert. When she realizes they're being chased she continues at the same speed and keeps telling her son that the man chasing them can't be a vampire. It doesn't matter woman! There's a crazy man trying to kill you! Whether he's a vampire or not is irrelevant. When someone wants you dead you get away fast. Simple. You certainly don't:A. Drive slowly and let him pass you.B. Just sit there when he blocks the road in front of you.C. Faint.She does all of these and it's beyond infuriating. I understand that you need to set up some sort of set-piece for the vampire's sheer awesomeness, but why can't you do it in a way that doesn't make everyone involved look like they're dumber than a bag of bricks. Nobody could possibly be that stupid, so kindly present us with some characters we can actually emphasize with. The girlfriend is significantly better (as well as actually having a character) but she then manages to get separated from her boyfriend in the middle of a rave. I get that they needed to get separated so he could rescue her, but again: believability. You shouldn't be getting abducted in the middle of a crowd and have nobody notice. I also doubt that a teenager can go into a store and buy a crossbow, then just walk down the street with it and have noone notice. When watching a vampire movie I don't want the vampire to be the most rational person there. It's not like there aren't any good women in horror movies. Ripley from Alien is one of the best and she's extremely rational. But horror films keep sticking with mindless bimbos and it has gotten really old.This is especially unfortunate because the guys in this are great. Colin Farrel makes a great vampire, and David Tennant gets to play a stagey magician. The two younger actors are Anton Yelchin (Checkov) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (McLovin'). I've liked Yelchin ever since he was a kid, and Mintz-Plasse has impressed me by playing just about every variation on nerd in existence. That's not me being sarcastic, most actors who play nerdy kids have only one way of presenting it and that's why they don't last. All of these actors are good, but they can't rescue it from the stupidity that ensues whenever one of the women is onscreen. Yelchin's character does some stupid things, but he does some smart things too and his final battle is actually clever enough for me to forgive a lot. But it doesn't make up for the rest of the film. The women in this film are dumb, which isn't the fault of the actresses but the writers. Some stereotypes really need to die, because they are quite capable of ruining what looked like a promising movie.So basically the scorecard is this:Good: Male leads, vampire effects, overall plot, character development.Bad: Female leads, plot details, believability.",3,At Its Best When There Are No Women Around,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,4220,"[""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'diss', 'actresses', 'here', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'Toni', 'Collete', 'when', 'playing', 'basically', 'same', 'role', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'girlfriend', 'good', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'who', 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'know', 'horrible', 'stereotypes', 'women', 'fall', 'are', 'useless', 'Completely', 'useless', 'Horror', ""n't"", 'only', 'genre', 'have', 'little', 'stereotypes', 'certainly', 'one', 'hardest', 'time', 'rising', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'case', 'except', 'inasmuch', 'people', 'have', 'act', 'extremely', 'irrationally', 'set', 'up', 'most', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'horror', 'movie', 'females', 'have', 'worst', 'time', 'are', 'always', 'shrill', 'emotional', 'never', 'listen', 'main', 'character', 'generally', 'start', 'crying', 'breaking', 'down', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'ways', 'worst', 'possible', 'moments', 'stupid', 'sexist', 'stereotype', 'worse', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'are', 'obviously', 'there', 'only', 'crutch', 'main', 'character', 'screenwriters', 'can', 'put', 'situations', 'sane', 'man', 'would', 'avoid.This', 'film', 'features', 'particularly', 'egregious', 'example', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'women', 'not', 'believing', 'lead', 'initially', 'crazy', 'are', 'attacked', 'vampire', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'just', 'tried', 'blow', 'house', 'then', 'hurled', 'bike', 'car', 'yet', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'drive', 'more', 'twenty', 'miles', 'hour', 'down', 'highway', 'middle', 'desert', 'When', ""'re"", 'being', 'chased', 'same', 'speed', 'telling', 'son', 'man', 'chasing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'vampire', ""n't"", 'matter', 'woman', 'crazy', 'man', 'trying', 'kill', 'vampire', 'not', 'irrelevant', 'When', 'someone', 'dead', 'get', 'away', 'fast', 'Simple', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'Drive', 'slowly', 'let', 'pass', 'you.B', 'Just', 'sit', 'there', 'when', 'road', 'front', 'you.C', 'Faint.She', 'infuriating', 'understand', 'need', 'set', 'up', 'sort', 'set-piece', 'vampire', 'sheer', 'awesomeness', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'way', ""n't"", 'make', 'everyone', 'involved', 'look', ""'re"", 'dumber', 'bag', 'bricks', 'Nobody', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'stupid', 'so', 'kindly', 'present', 'characters', 'can', 'actually', 'emphasize', 'girlfriend', 'significantly', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'actually', 'having', 'character', 'then', 'get', 'separated', 'boyfriend', 'middle', 'rave', 'get', 'needed', 'get', 'separated', 'so', 'could', 'rescue', 'again', 'believability', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'abducted', 'middle', 'crowd', 'have', 'nobody', 'notice', 'also', 'doubt', 'teenager', 'can', 'go', 'store', 'buy', 'crossbow', 'then', 'just', 'walk', 'down', 'street', 'have', 'noone', 'notice', 'When', 'watching', 'vampire', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'vampire', 'be', 'most', 'rational', 'person', 'there', 'not', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'women', 'horror', 'movies', 'Ripley', 'Alien', 'one', 'best', 'extremely', 'rational', 'horror', 'films', 'keep', 'sticking', 'mindless', 'bimbos', 'gotten', 'really', 'old.This', 'especially', 'unfortunate', 'guys', 'are', 'great', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'great', 'vampire', 'David', 'Tennant', 'play', 'stagey', 'magician', 'two', 'younger', 'actors', 'are', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Checkov', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'McLovin', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'ever', 'was', 'kid', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'impressed', 'playing', 'just', 'variation', 'nerd', 'existence', 'not', 'being', 'sarcastic', 'most', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'nerdy', 'kids', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'presenting', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'stupidity', 'whenever', 'one', 'women', 'onscreen', 'Yelchin', 'character', 'stupid', 'things', 'smart', 'things', 'too', 'final', 'battle', 'actually', 'clever', 'enough', 'forgive', 'lot', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'rest', 'film', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'dumb', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actresses', 'writers', 'stereotypes', 'really', 'need', 'die', 'are', 'quite', 'capable', 'ruining', 'what', 'looked', 'promising', 'movie.So', 'basically', 'scorecard', 'Good', 'Male', 'leads', 'vampire', 'effects', 'overall', 'plot', 'character', 'development.Bad', 'Female', 'plot', 'details', 'believability']",Fright Night

I simply love the original with Chris Sarandon, the totally most handsome vampire ever.  I liked all of the original cast members as well, straight down to Charlie Brewster's Mom.This remake with Colin Farrell was more sinister and evil in this film.  It was quite dark and a little humorous.  He was more of a rugged, brutal, killer.  It  didn't appear that there was a love interest in this movie for him.  Just kill, kill, and more kill.  Motivation was, ""I need Blood to Survive and I want it Now"".I wasn't too fond of Evil.  His friendship with Charlie seemed a little strained.  I felt that Charlie was trying to do something different with his life, which didn't include Evil.  Evil seemed to resent Charlie and his new friends.  The new Peter Vincent was weird and I guess added a more modern feel to the character.  They even included more interaction with Charlie's Mom.  Amy still loved Charlie, but I found her a little boring.  She was not as perky as the original Amy for me.  Though Jerry went after Amy, their connection was different from the original movie.Though I did not expect this movie to be as the original, I did not like some of the story line as much.

It's soulless Hollywood trash with none of the flavor or fun, all the life has been squeezed out leaving just another generic teen horror movie no one will remember. And Instead of nerds being the heroes like in the original, we get beautiful 90210-type people saving the day (of course). Worse, nerds in this movie are treated like worthless losers to be cast aside in order to get ahead in life. Gone are the homages to classic vampire movies and TV horror hosts, replaced by soulless Las Vegas D-bag magicians.Is the new Fright Night unwatchable? No, it's just not very good, like almost everything coming out of Hollywood these days. Even the special effects suck, being really lame CGI. The FX were a million times scarier and gorier in the 80s version!

1374061,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003Y5H5FG,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Fright Night is an okay vampire move.  Truthfully, I never found vampires the least bit frightening- walking around in the dark and sneakily biting people on the neck isn't really scary to me.  It's basically about a teenage boy and his girlfriend constantly running from a much bigger relentless vampire.The good news is that there's a couple segments in Fright Night that are actually really good- the one where the victim, his girlfriend and mother attempt to drive away from the vicious pursuit of the vampire but constantly find themselves struggling to do so due to a sudden speed increase of the vampire who's able to catch up to the vehicle in time to wreak havoc.  I never realized vampires possessed such speed.  Anyway I loved this scene a lot.  I also like the one near the end when the girlfriend opens her mouth abnormally wide preparing to bite down on her boyfriend's face.  This scene is going to give me nightmares!  And I suppose the scene with the teenage boy catching himself on fire and being slammed around by the vampire inside a dark room is pretty suspenseful.I was unaware that vampires need an invitation to enter homes- this is a new piece of information I wasn't aware of.  Unless this aspect is just an exclusive pertaining to *this* particular vampire film.  Also, the amount of blood from all the neck bites is relatively frequent.  I admire it.Much of the storytelling is unforgivably bland and boring, especially the entire first half.  Talking, talking, talking.  It closely resembles a teenage drama.

1374063,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B003Y5H5FG,blackaciddevil,"[0, 1]","As many of you know, Fright Night-originally- was a 1985 American Horror film that was directed by Tom Holland. Loved by fans, it told the story of Charley Brewster who's a young high school boy who discovers that his next door neighbor is a Vampire. Realizing this,  Charley turns to his hero: Peter Vincent to help him get rid of the problem. Because Charley won't look the other way(so to speak), his next door neighbor intends on taking Charley down and taking his girlfriend away from him and making her a Vampire. That's when things got interesting.Course, this ain't the 1985 film...it's the 2011 remake(reimagining, whatever you choose to call it). Basically, The central plot of the movie is, exactly, the same. However, if you're coming into this thinking it's a scene for scene remake of the original, &lt;grins an evil grin> you're in for a real eyeopener.Take one part From Dusk til Dawn, one part Blade, one part '85 Fright Night(of course) and shake extremely well and the end result is our new 2011 remake. While this movie does have some humorous moments to it, for the most part- it's played seriously with our Vampire, Jerry, being a vicious unfeeling bloodsucking spawn. Heck, even Chris Sarandon(the 1985 film's antagonist) makes an appearance. I really enjoyed it myself.What I didn't like about the movie, however, is how it gets straight to the point(almost expecting you to know certain things from the '85 film). By the time you get invested and get to know all the characters in the movie, it's over. Maybe it was intended to be this way, maybe not. Either way, I kinda frowned on that aspect.Otherwise, Fright Night is one of those remakes that does the original proud. There are very few out there in a time of constant remakes that have actually been able to do that. &lt;Thumbs up>",4,"Fright Night.....""Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!""",1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,1812,"['many', 'know', 'Fright', 'Night-originally-', 'was', '1985', 'American', 'Horror', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'Loved', 'fans', 'told', 'story', 'Charley', 'Brewster', 'who', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Vampire', 'Realizing', 'Charley', 'hero', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'help', 'get', 'rid', 'problem', 'Charley', 'wo', ""n't"", 'look', 'other', 'way', 'so', 'speak', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'taking', 'Charley', 'down', 'taking', 'girlfriend', 'away', 'making', 'Vampire', 'when', 'things', 'got', 'interesting.Course', 'ai', ""n't"", '1985', 'film', '2011', 'remake', 'reimagining', 'choose', 'call', 'Basically', 'central', 'plot', 'movie', 'exactly', 'same', 'However', ""'re"", 'coming', 'thinking', 'scene', 'scene', 'remake', 'original', 'lt', 'evil', 'grin', '>', ""'re"", 'real', 'eyeopener.Take', 'one', 'part', 'Dusk', 'til', 'Dawn', 'one', 'part', 'Blade', 'one', 'part', 'Fright', 'Night', 'course', 'shake', 'extremely', 'well', 'end', 'result', 'new', '2011', 'remake', 'movie', 'have', 'humorous', 'moments', 'most', 'part-', 'played', 'seriously', 'Vampire', 'Jerry', 'being', 'vicious', 'unfeeling', 'bloodsucking', 'spawn', 'Heck', 'even', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', '1985', 'film', 'antagonist', 'appearance', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'however', 'how', 'straight', 'point', 'almost', 'expecting', 'know', 'certain', 'things', ""'85"", 'film', 'time', 'get', 'invested', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'movie', 'over', 'Maybe', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'way', 'maybe', 'not', 'way', 'kinda', 'frowned', 'aspect.Otherwise', 'Fright', 'Night', 'one', 'remakes', 'original', 'proud', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'there', 'time', 'constant', 'remakes', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'lt', 'Thumbs', 'up', '>']",Fright Night

This is not even close to the spirit of the original Fright Night nor does it bring anything new thats awe inspiring that would make it at least a serious attempt to scare us in whole new different ways. While the original had a buildup, kid noticing weird new tenant and helper moving coffin into basement, Charly spying new tenant with hooker in the buff, tenant opens mouth exposing fangs,suddenly his eyes roll upward to Charlies window and his very long fingernail pull the shades down,all these with a real creepy eerie soundtrack playing,just one of the real creepy haunting moments.  Something funny is going on here. He spies, calls the cops and no one beleives him, not even his friends take him seriously. This took about almost 30 minutes to accomplish. In this remake we hear about a vampire being in town in the first 5 minutes. 15 minutes later Evil Ed, Charleys scoffing outcast friend who barely has role of any substance here is turned, while in the original he tried with Charleys girlfriend and Peter Vincent to prove that Charley basically is in need of helpCollin Farrell seemed like he was told it would be a comedy, the boozy happy go lucky next door neigbor. The original Dandridge was a subdued threat covered by a gentlemanly charm, charming while Collins is a smug beer swilling shmuck if you really wanna know what acts like. Wow, thats real inventive, the vampire who not being invited in hangs at the door borrowing beer.Most of the time its Farrel acting more like a homicidal maniac then a vampire. Blow up the house to get in. Blow up the house you blow up Charly so what do you care if you can enter or not. The car chase scene with an appearance by the original real vampire Chris Sarandon was lame. Borrowed from 1978s the Body Snatchers where Kevin McCarthny spoofs his role in 1956 movie running down the street being chased by the Pod People still yelling your next. Now that was a great moment. Sarandons appearance was just a paycheck.And Peter Vincent? HAHAHAHAHA. Midori swilling Magician who is about as helpful as salt on a wound, his screen time thankfully was limited as well. Well its not his fault that it was the late great Roddy McDowell who played Peter Vincent, a role that would have been perfect for Peter Cushing as well I thought, though at this time Cushing was ill it would have been great to see Hammers Vampire killer doing it American style, but I digress. This was also a fine build up as Charley first approaches a now dated pink slipped Vampire Killer who does a marvelous job trying to get away and into his car from Charley whom he starts to fear as being a lunatic.Amanda Bearse role though it wasnt a neccesity, they could have used the time with the chick Charlie loved and developed another angle to the story and be creative. And then their is the climax of this movie that was just short of retarded, Dandridge living in an unfinished house without any stucco yet on the wallboarding and keeping his victims in the walls in layers of earth. And the face change?  Give the originals hellishly great makeup job they did on Sarandon.But I see either all the vulgar and tasteless fan kids and studio stooges have written in to up this trashes Amazon score.

FRIGHT NIGHT returns to the big screen in the 2011 remake, which unfortunately leaves much to be desired. Unlike Tom Holland's 1980's cult classic, which modernized the vampire mythos while paying homage to the films of the 50's and 60's, the only things this new version seems concerned about is looking cool and selling copies of the soundtrack. The plot has been slightly restructured in the first half to provide enough surprises for returning audiences as to keep things fresh, but the unnecessary escalation of action and computerized effects leads to a major let down in the second half. Careless screenwriting also leaves us with countless questions, since there do not appear to be any consequences for any of the characters' actions (particularly when no one can be bothered to investigate Charley's house fire or how and why he arrived at the hospital in a car that was stolen from a dead man). Filmmakers Craig Gillespie and Marti Noxon appear to have no interest in telling a convincing story or building suspense, and instead focus on being teen-edgy and hip.

It's a simple rule really. Take the basic premise of the film you are re-making, keep basic elements the same, and then make your own damn movie! Think about it. Some of the best horror film remakes in recent memory (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead, Piranha) all follow this rule. They pay ""respects"" to there origins, but for the most part are farely original. This one is no different.The story is about a high school boy named Charlie, who recently has climed the social ladder at school with help from his new friends, who are tools, and his smokin'-hot girlfriend. But when his new neighbor Jerry moves next door, all hell breaks loose. You see, Jerry (played wonderfully macho by Colin Farrell) is a vampire hell-bent for blood who will do anything it takes to get it. But when Charlie recieves help from his girlfriend and his new found magician friend Peter Vincent (played like a cross between Chris Angel and Aldous Snow), Jerry might have more on his plate then he can handle.All in all, this was a very refreshing and suprising remake that deliciously blends humour with horror.

But unlike the Conan reboot, Fright Night hits it out of the park. I confess to never having seen the original Fright Night, so I'm a tabula rasa so far as preconceptions of what Fright Night should be. I can't tell you how well the new Fright Night stands up to the original. What I can tell you is that this new Fright Night alternates perfectly between funny and thrilling. Starring Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell, Imogen Poots, David Tennant and Toni Collette, Fright Night is long on talent and short on filler. It moves at a brisk pace until it turns on pacing afterburners (in a good way!) about halfway through.Anton Yelchin plays Charley Brewster. He and his single mom, Jane, played by Toni Collette live in Las Vegas and in a nod to the real world the economy is weak resulting in dozens of foreclosed, empty houses. So when whole families disappear from the neighborhood, it's only natural to think that the former occupants fell on hard economic times and lost the family home. But Charley's best friend, Ed, knows better. Ed knows that all the missing kids at school and empty houses in town are the work of Vampires. Queue Jerry, played by Colin Farrell. He's Charley and Jane's new next door neighbor. Y'know, a guy who works nights and sleeps during the day. A lot of people work nights at Vegas casinos. Besides, a vampire named Jerry? That's like naming a vampire Bill, Erik or PamWell just like Erik Northman, Jerry is of the species homo vampiricus badassicus. He will not be throwing pebbles at your window and sharing chaste kisses with you in the woods. He will however, be flipping your car over and trying to disembowel you. Colin may be the scariest character named Jerry in all film history. At the start of the movie it's a quite, subtle menace, but it isn't long before Jerry cuts loose and the movie shifts gears from fun comedy to all out thrill ride. Fright Night, like 30 Days of Night reminds us that vampires need not be angst ridden and insecure. They EAT PEOPLE! And it's awesome.I don't know whether Fright Night is a good remake, but it is a great movie. It is full of laughs but has fantastic thrills too. After seeing what vampires named Jerry are capable of, let's all of us hope what happens in Vegas truly stays in Vegas.FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.",4,"Fang-tastic, Fun and Freaky",1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,2482,"['Review', 'Hollywood', 'recycling', 'movies', 'cranking', 'out', 'remakes', 'reboots', 'prequels', 'so', 'fast', 'Fright', 'Night', 'just', 'one', 'TWO', 'remakes', 'released', 'same', 'week', 'August', 'Conan', 'reboot', 'Fright', 'Night', 'park', 'confess', 'never', 'having', 'seen', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', ""'m"", 'tabula', 'rasa', 'so', 'far', 'preconceptions', 'what', 'Fright', 'Night', 'should', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'well', 'new', 'Fright', 'Night', 'up', 'original', 'What', 'can', 'tell', 'new', 'Fright', 'Night', 'perfectly', 'funny', 'thrilling', 'Starring', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Fright', 'Night', 'long', 'talent', 'short', 'filler', 'brisk', 'pace', 'pacing', 'afterburners', 'good', 'way', 'halfway', 'through.Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Charley', 'Brewster', 'single', 'mom', 'Jane', 'played', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'live', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'nod', 'real', 'world', 'economy', 'weak', 'resulting', 'dozens', 'foreclosed', 'empty', 'houses', 'So', 'when', 'whole', 'families', 'disappear', 'neighborhood', 'only', 'natural', 'think', 'former', 'occupants', 'fell', 'hard', 'economic', 'times', 'lost', 'family', 'home', 'Charley', 'best', 'friend', 'Ed', 'better', 'Ed', 'missing', 'kids', 'school', 'empty', 'houses', 'town', 'are', 'work', 'Vampires', 'Queue', 'Jerry', 'played', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Charley', 'Jane', 'new', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', ""Y'know"", 'guy', 'who', 'nights', 'sleeps', 'day', 'lot', 'people', 'work', 'nights', 'Vegas', 'casinos', 'Besides', 'vampire', 'named', 'Jerry', 'naming', 'vampire', 'Bill', 'Erik', 'PamWell', 'just', 'Erik', 'Northman', 'Jerry', 'species', 'homo', 'vampiricus', 'badassicus', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'throwing', 'pebbles', 'window', 'sharing', 'chaste', 'kisses', 'woods', 'will', 'however', 'be', 'flipping', 'car', 'trying', 'disembowel', 'Colin', 'may', 'be', 'scariest', 'character', 'named', 'Jerry', 'film', 'history', 'start', 'movie', 'quite', 'subtle', 'menace', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Jerry', 'cuts', 'loose', 'movie', 'shifts', 'gears', 'fun', 'comedy', 'out', 'thrill', 'ride', 'Fright', 'Night', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'vampires', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'angst', 'ridden', 'insecure', 'EAT', 'PEOPLE', 'awesome.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Fright', 'Night', 'good', 'remake', 'great', 'movie', 'full', 'laughs', 'fantastic', 'thrills', 'too', 'seeing', 'what', 'named', 'Jerry', 'are', 'capable', 'let', 'hope', 'what', 'Vegas', 'truly', 'Vegas.FTC', 'Advisory', 'purchased', 'own', 'tickets']",Fright Night

1374083,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B003Y5H5FG,David J. Brown,"[94, 121]","Okay, I am a HUGE Fright Night fan.  I even enjoyed Fright Night part II, despite it's weak spots(less threatening and interesting villains, semi-rehash plot line).  The original Fright Night has all the things I love about that special time called the 80's in horror; boisterous special effects, tongue firmly in cheek, monsters, and really great make up effects and ever evolving visual effects.  It was a love letter to Hammer vampires and a send up of the 80's slasher trend that dominated the era and knocked over the traditional monsters.  I had heard about this remake several years ago and was aghast.  Nobody wanted Hollyweird to stay away from Fright Night more than me.  I was so shocked that the remake turned out to be not only good, but surprising, and totally fun.Now I know some horror fans, fanboys in general really, automatically hate something when it's remade, and hate something when the remake changes or rearranges things from the original.  Let me warn you purists nerds out there right now, this thing changes all the characters around with the exception of 'Evil' Ed Thompson.  He's the same, and played quirkily by Christopher Mintz Plasse(Mc'Lovin).  Jerry Dandridge is no longer a semi-tragic seducer, but a cold predator with motives only a supernatural predator could understand, but the movie is goodly enough to let us in anyway.  Peter Vincent(the biggest change in character in the remake) is no longer an older, washed up, Hammer-esque horror movie star with a cheap late night horror show, but now a Chris Angel inspired Vegas magician whose show revolves around the occult and especially gothic vampire imagery.  Charley Brewster is no longer the nerd next store, but rather a reformed nerd who is a status seeker, trying desperately to hide his old nerd ways to his new 'cool' friends, and super hot girlfriend Amy.  Amy is still the most thankless role, but she gets a bit of fleshing out before the third act and truly comes off sympathetic.Now, like the Halloween remakes, I'm sure most will be upset by the revamped Peter Vincent, but I quite enjoyed the concept and David Tennant's performance.  He's crude, drunk, and hiding some secrets from Charlie that the film will reveal.  They did a good job of connecting Vincent to the main vampire plot this time out.  One of the weaker spots of the original film was the logic behind Charlie going to a known actor for help killing a vampire.  It never made a whole lot of sense, but it was fun anyway.  In this version there's some logic there and a brilliantly over the top set piece that takes place in Vincent's Apartment in Vegas.In the original film Charlie Brewster was your basic straight man.  He had to play the auidience and the stalwart hero to root for.  The cool bit about this character in the original is that writer/director Tom Holland made him a horror hip nerd(long before Scream's Randy).  In the remake we find that Charlie is ashamed of his nerd past and he is seeking cool status in high school.  He's not very likeable at the out set.  His old nerd best friend Evil Ed informs him that one of their old chums has gone missing and possibly murdered, and Charlie just wants to hear none of it and be left alone.  You're not rooting for Charlie.  That's until he makes his first selfless act for a stripper neighbor entangled in a Jerry Dandridge trap.  Charlie has a full blow arch in this film.  I really enjoyed them taking the vanilla out of the vanilla hero in this remake.Oh, Jerry, my favorite vampire of the 80's this side of David Bowie and Kiefer Sutherland.  In the original Chris Sarandon's performance is brilliant and as written the character is better than the one presented here.  That's just a fact.  Jerry in the original seems tragic, but willing to do what he has to do to survive and to keep his secret.  This may seem like sacrilege to most fans but I was never a fan of the plot point in the original of Charlie's girlfriend Amy being the reincarnation of Jerry's long lost love.  It's too contrived and convenient and really unnecessary to the story at the end of the film.  Amy gets used basically as the bait for Charlie and Peter to come after Jerry into his trap.  In this film Jerry is pure predator.  Now one must understand why this was done.  In my opinion this film was not competing with the original portrayal of Jerry, but rather all the recent tragic, weepy, romantic vampires that have come along from True Blood, Vampire Diaries and most especially Twilight.  The writer of this film Marti Noxon(staff writer for Buffy the Vampire Slayer the series for years) was trying to create the ultimate anti-Twilight vampire in all his rated R glory. Colin Farrell is an excellent choice for this and his performance manages to be unshowy but rather subverssive.  He has a great scene where he threatens Charlie in between the lines after Ed goes missing(which unlike the original film is in the first 15 minutes so that doesn't count as a spoiler).  He's truly menacing and perfect for this role.  Plus, as a bonus original film's Jerry(Chris Sarandon) shows up for a funny cameo that had me cheering when I recognized his face.Anton Yelchin is a young actor I feel should be looked for.  This is his second starring role after Charlie Bartlet and he manages to earn our sympathy and complete a delicate arch from douche bag to hero.  He's quite good and look forward to him, and people who aren't generically good looking, in the youth crowd of actors getting more leads like this in bigger and better projects.  He manages to give us the pathos, comedy, and shear fear that this role requires, and sometimes in the same scene.  ""See look, creepy vampire hand!"", is one of his funniest lines and silliest and he manages it without looking or sounding stupid.Imogen Poots his quite effective in the film too, despite her having the most underwritten role.  She comes off not like a bimbo but as an average teenage girl, who just happens to be impossibly gorgeous.  I would like to see her in meatier roles with more to do beyond being the hero's reason for going into the dragon's lair after being kidnapped.Now onto Evil Ed, the most popular character from the first film.  Now Stephen Geoffreys isn't a great actor, but he imbued that part with something totally original and unexpected of the genre at the time.  I take nothing from his role in that film.  He was great.  Hell, the concept of a painfully nerdy kid becoming a new all powerful vampire is still a great quirky concept that no one has really done since or before.  In this we get Mintz-Plasse playing basically a toned down version of McLovin.  But it's more than that.  He manages to play the hurt of losing his best friend to the status of high school realistically, and his ultimate revenge manages to be harrowing, funny, and silly all in great effect.  Is he as memorable as Geoffreys in the original?  No, not even close, but he pulls off the roles requirements and I'd imagine for people who haven't seen the original, or don't even know that this is a remake, his character will hold some surprises for them.  The only thing I really want to complain about when it comes to this character and his role in the plot involves his demise by Jerry.  I don't mind that it happens WAAAAAY earlier in this film, but rather how the drama plays out.  In the original it's quite emotional how Jerry pulls Ed into his arms promising a world where no one will ever pick on him again, and quite scary how Jerry chases him in the alley.  In this film, while Jerry' dialogue is similar, it just doesn't have the same impact and pathos.  It's there but not quite as good.Toni Collette shows up in the film as Charlie's mom.  Her part has been beefed up from the previous film.  I really liked her and her role as the stakes for Charlie gets raised.  People accuse roles like this being thankless when big name and very talented actors like Colette take them, but I disagree.  She performs a function and does it really well.  Is the part small, and not very deep?  Yup, but it feels layered and you care about her almost instantly because of Colette.  Here's a good litmus test, if a lesser actress had played the 'thankless' role of Mrs. Brewster how would the film have turned out?  This isn't Shakespeare but it should be take seriously regardless and the final film benefits from it in totality.Now there is one thing that disappointed me about this remake; the vampires don't really have monster transformations.  In the original film Steve Johnson's make up effects for the vampires various monsterous visages were quite impressive if totally over done by the decade's end.  Jerry turns into a monsterous bat, Ed turns into a wolf, etc.  In this film the vampires do get ugly when they get mad, but it's just a slight bat-like visage and some major gnarly claws.  It was done by Howard Berger of KNB effects and the make ups are quite good, but they are enhanced with digial effects, very good digital effects by the way.  When Jerry goes full blown monster for the closing moments of the film it is mostly CGI.  Sorry, guys, but for some reason when Amy's jaw grows large and filled with jagged teeth in the original it was done well by make up effects, but the remake need to be aided by CGI.  Why?  Is it more effective?  Not really.  At the end of the day, digital or make up, I still know I'm looking at an effect.  I just admire make up effects more than CGI.  That's just me.The basic plot points and reasons for this story are the same as the original but tweaked, rearranged and give different back stories.  This is what I think remakes should do.  Make a good films for the virgins of the franchise but also surprise, hopefully pleasantly, the old fans.  This film does that in spades.  I can't really reveal what those tweaks and twists that might surprise old school fans are due to them being major spoilers.  I will say, without too much detail, that Jerry's ultimate plan has more to do with than just drinking blood for survival.  It's a great twist to the vampire lore, and leaves room for a third act surprise that had me squirming and widening my eyes with glee.  Peter Vincent gets the same treatment, although his new twist is easily figured out, at least to me, but it was very satisfying and gave him a logic of more dramatic weight that the first film really didn't need or have.  It works.I know my horror nerd membership card may get revoked, but I really loved this remake.  No, not more than the original, but as close to it as possible for a story I've seen once told already.  This is how remakes should be done in my estimation.  Don't recreate the wheel, but rather tweak it and turn it down a different road to get to the same end.  See this movie, new or old fan, you are going to get something out of it.  If you're a fanboy and just can't deal with anything about your original film being changed or tweaked, just avoid it and save yourself the headache and us your bitching rants.PS: I saw this is in 2D.  I really don't care about 3D and the low box office returns for 3D films is diminishing(just like it did in the 50's and in the 80') its appeal to studios, so I imagine I will have to deal with having to go to different theaters just to see a damn movie in glorious 2D much less in the future.  It's a horror film, set mostly at night, mostly in dark areas, so why would one want to make it muddier and darker by slipping on 3D glasses?  I wouldn't and don't.  Although, this film does have actual 3D intended shots, and was shot in actual 3D, I just didn't see the point of the gimmick beyond taking the audience out of the film which was a semi-serious horror film.  Plus, some of the shots that are big 3D shots really screw up the flow of the edit and manage to take you out of the movie even if you're watching it in 2D.  One that sticks out is a shot of a vampire monster hand coming through the bottom of a car.  The shot is held to long obviously for 3D effect.  Things are flung at the camera several times too, but there's really no good reason this straight horror film is done in 3D.",5,"""Welcome to Fright Night...for real......again.""",1313884800,"08 21,

1374087,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003Y5H5FG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","While there are some who may remember the 1985 horror film ""Fright Night"" written by Tom Holland, and its sequel in 1988, with many remakes of popular horror films happening more and more, what happens if the task of writing a screenplay is given to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" writer Marti Noxon?Let's just say that while not a horror/slasher type of film, you do get the humor that was quite prevalent in those popular TV series that Noxon was involved with and also the feeling of a homage to the Scooby Gang than redoing the same kind of film that was released in '85.  And director Craig Gillespie doing something different than his previous films ""Lars and the Real Girl"", ""Mr. Woodcock"" and the TV series ""United States of Tara"".Also, unlike the earlier film's, this latest adaptation would benefit from better visual effects but also a change in storyline compared to the original film.  Where the original focused on a horror fan of the TV series ""Fright Night"" and an actor who played a vampire killer, there are differences that keep the original 1985 film original and this 2011 version is a different type of film that uses the character's names, modernizes the storyline and is essentially a different film.While the film wasn't a major hit in the box office, it did receive many positive reviews from film critics.  And for fans of ""Buffy the Vampire"" and ""Angel"", because of Noxon's involvement, there was a little homage to those series in the film, as well as to the original film that made fans interested and entertained.  And also to ""Doctor Who"" fans who love David Tennant's work as the doctor and want to see him play the vampire hunter, Peter Vincent.VIDEO:""Fright Night"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The Picture quality is fantastic!  There are a lot of detail's that can be seen, from the detail on the clothing, the weapons, the blood on the characters.  Plenty of detail can be seen in this film from Amy's blue eyes, the detail on the CG of Jerry's vampire face, the edges and contour of Peter Vincent's collection and more! Also, it helps to have a talented cinematographer, Javier Aguirresarobe (""The Others"", ""Twilight: New Moon"", ""The Twilight Saga: Elclipse"", ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") working on the film.  Javier does a wonderful job in capturing the action sequences with complete efficacy!Skin tones are natural, black levels are deep and no artifacts, banding (especially during the more fire and red intensive scenes) or traces of DNR.  This is an awesome looking film on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Fright Night"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), English 2.0 DVS, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  What an immersive soundtrack!  I was so happy to hear the rear surrounds being used in this film, I was very impressed!  While the film starts out with a lot of dialogue and is crystal clear through the center channel and also ambient effects and music through the front channel, the movie builds with noises from glass being broken, to the scream of Doris but once you get into the action sequences featuring Charley, Amy and his mother being pursued by Jerry, the film becomes immersive!From the sounds of a motorcycle hitting the back window, Jane running straight into Jerry and the vampire trying to come from below in order to kill his victims or the scrape of metal as it hits the pavement.  From this point on to the film, the film is so immersive because of the continual action sequences that I really enjoyed this lossless soundtrack.  Action kept going and going, ambiance via the club or crowds is heard clearly.  If anything, audio quality like the video is fantastic!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Fright Night"" comes with the following special features:Peter Vincent: Come Swim in My Mind - (2:09) An interview with Peter Vincent (the character played by David Tennant).The Official ""How to Make a Funny Vampire Movie"" Guide - (8:04) Craig Gillespie, Marti Noxon and the producers and cast talk about necessary things to have in a vampire film.Deleted & Extended Scenes - (4:51) Featuring five deleted scenes: Ride to School, Neighborly, Once a Freak Always a Freak, Midori & Kerosene and Back at the Penthouse.Squidman: Extended and Uncut - (2:58) Featuring the extended, uncut version of the squidman home video that Charley and his friends took when they were younger.Bloopers - (3:23) Outtakes from ""Fright Night"".Kid Cudi - ""No One Believes Me"" Music Video - (5:21)EXTRAS:""Fright Night"" comes with a slipcover case and DVD with feature film and special features.  The DVD is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) aspect ratio - enhanced for 169 televisions.  Audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital, English 2.0 DVS, French, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:While I'm not so fond of '70s and '80s horror films because they still continue to scare the hell out of me... ""Fright Night"" is one of those horror films that may have some scares but by no means is it a horror, slasher film or anything that is overly grotesque.In fact, when I found out that Marti Noxon wrote the screenplay and that Craig Gillespie was directing, I wasn't thinking of horror film.  Knowing Noxon's style of writing for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and the ""Angel"" TV series, she is a writer that tries to bring together comedy, horror but also gives things a more stylish presentation for today's viewers.  While Craig Gillespie is also a character driven director and both working together was actually quite effective.In some ways, minus Joss Whedon and the fact that fans have wished on a real ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" movie since the TV series had ended, this 2011 version of ""Fright Night"" almost felt like an extension of those series.  A homage to those Whedon TV series that a lot of us grew up watching way before ""Twilight"" and the other countless vampire related films and TV series that are currently ongoing.And I can easily say that because Marti Noxon wrote the screenplay, was a major incentive of me wanting to watch this film because I knew I was not going to have a bloody horrorfest but a film that will be action-packed and entertaining!  While it will be quite subjective for those who saw the original 1985 film and this 2011 version of which is better and which is not, I'm more on the latter side, that I enjoyed this 2011 film a lot!First, Colin Farrell does a fantastic job of playing the antagonist, Jerry the vampire.  You know that he is the bad boy that the women are going to fall for and also the actor does a great job of playing the villain!  Anton Yelchin looks like the underdog.  As Charley, a kid we don't expect much from in defending his family, yet himself from a vampire attack, so you root for the underdog.  Especially for his girlfriend Amy (played by Imogen Poots) and his mother Jane (Toni Collette).But also having David Tennant (which alone will have ""Dr. Who"" fans excited) as the vampire hunter, Peter Vincent was a big plus!  Especially to have Tennant play this bombastic character, so different from Roddy McDowall's 1985 performance.  If anything, Tennant made this rude and aggressive character his own.But also to having this film set in Las Vegas to help explain the Peter Vincent, Vampire Hunter show and also why Jerry has blacked-out windows (because people in Las Vegas work at nights and sleep during the day), works well for this film.But one advantage that the 2011 version film has its technology and it's talented crew behind it.  Aside from Gillespie and Noxon, for cinematography, you have ""Twilight: New Moon"" and ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"" cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe, art director Randy Moore (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"", ""The Mask""), costume designer Susan Matheson (""The Kingdom"", ""The Town"", ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby""), production designer Richard Bridgland (""Resident Evil"", ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator""), Set decorator K.C. Fox (""Speed"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"") and many more.  DreamWorks Pictures really tapped into a talented crew for this 2011 version of the film.As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality and lossless audio is fantastic!  I wish there was an audio commentary but you still get a good number of special features included with this Blu-ray release.  And also, with this Blu-ray release, you get a DVD feature of the film, so since this will be released before Christmas, something people can watch during those long travel commutes or during winter vacation.Overall, ""Fright Night"" is not so much of a horror film.  If you have watched a ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Angel"" episode, you know it's about comedy, its characters and of course, these characters trying to survive from vampires.  While the original definitely had hints of a sequel toward the end, this 2011 film did not. But then again, with so much interest in vampire films and vampire television shows, I wouldn't be surprised if more ""Fright Night"" films would be made.If so, I hope it retains the same type of vibe as the 2011 version as I do love what Marti Noxon has brought to the original screenplay.  Especially with so many horror films coming out each year, it's great to have something not too banal in which you have a vampire film that is not all about the horror but a screenplay that manages to have fun and not having main characters dying off like other films.Overall, ""Fright Night"" is an enjoyable, entertaining action-based, vampire film, it may not be scary enough for others...but for those who want to laugh and also enjoy the characters of the film, this one is for you!",4,"Blu-ray: Marti Noxon injects some of that ""Buffy the Vampire""/""Angel"" humor into ""Fright Night"" and I

It was released in that pergatory period for movies (early to mid-August) and it was at the theater and then--poof--gone.  That's a real shame because I enjoyed the movie.  The original, which I did enjoy more than the reboot, went more for comedy than actual horror.  ""Fright Night"" was a long-in-the-tooth local production hosted by Peter Vincent, fearless vampire killer (*nudge/nudge, wink/wink*).Colin Farrell plays Jerry Dandridge in the redo.  His character is not comedic; heck, he's not even all that friendly.  He is evil and he's in town to do evil things.  Following the plot of the original, he moves into the house next to Charley (Anton Yelchin) and his mom--sans his ""goon"" from the first picture.  He has not come to this suburb of Las Vegas to make friends and give ""warm-fuzzies"" to people.  He has come to repopulate his kind and he wastes no time in doing so.  And he's on to Charley quicker than a duck on a June-bug.  The director (Craig Gillespie) didn't waste time on having a love story between Jerry and Charley's girlfriend, which I rather enjoyed.  Jerry saw her as simply another meal.I don't quite understand why this version was publicized as a ""remake,"" because it was almost an entirely different story.  What worked in the first picture, wouldn't have necessarily worked in this one.  It was a different take and I enjoyed it.  Check it out.  The movie is rated R.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","I have a confession to make, which will probably get me stoned by an angry mob: I never really liked the original ""Fright Night.""Now, I'm not saying that I hated it or that it was bad, but its campy style just didn't appeal to me. So perhaps it's not surprising that -- without nostalgia goggles -- I found myself thoroughly enjoying the remake that eventually got made. And a lot of that is due to Colin Farrell's brilliant performance as a laid-back, casually creepy vampire-next-door.Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is understandably annoyed when his estranged friend ""Evil"" Ed Lee (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) claims that his new neighbor Jerry (Farrell) is a vampire. Then Ed vanishes, and Charley discovers -- by breaking into Jerry's basement -- that his new neighbor is indeed a vampire. Unfortunately, Jerry also knows that Charley knows that he's a vampire.Who can Charlie turn to for help? Why, Doctor Who! No, seriously. David Tennant is in this movie as a leather-clad, foul-mouthed Vegas stage magician who ALSO happens to be a vampire expert. But when Jerry destroys his home and kidnaps his girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots), Charley decides to take the fight to the vampire.Colin Farrell is a big part of what makes ""Fright Night"" a good movie -- he acts mellow and laid-back all the time, often chuckling to himself as if the humans' struggles are just an amusement to him. But he never descends into camp cheese. Even ordinary, un-vampirey dialogue is somehow underlaid with menace when he speaks it (""Catch you later!"") -- how often do you see a vampire who can sound scary just asking for beer?It's also really nice to see vampires that aren't misunderstood sad-eyed woobies who just need love. These vampires are vicious, malevolent and apparently possessed by an evil force -- the only moment when you feel sorry for them is when they briefly revert back to their human minds.In fact, the movie actually reminds me a bit of the classic ""Dracula"" -- you've got Evil Ed as Lucy, Jerry as Dracula, Amy as Mina, Vincent as Van Helsing and Charley as a composite of all the other male characters. There's lots of tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Don't do anything I wouldn't do. That doesn't narrow it down. That's like, mini-golf and sushi"") and some bloodily hilarious moments (the battle between Evil Ed and Charley).Biggest problem: the CGI for the vampire faces is pretty horrible.None of the rest of the cast are QUITE as brilliant as Farrell, but they are all pretty good -- Yelchin is pretty convincing as an ex-nerd who is now trying to be non-""dweeby"" enough for his hot girlfriend, and Mintz-Plasse gives a deliciously warped performance as Evil Ed (who seems to have a bit of a crush on Charley). Toni Colette and Poots are also quite good, although Colette's character seems kind of superfluous.And David Tennant... oh, David Tennant. He completely steals the scene whenever he's onscreen, cussing up a storm and slouching around in very tight leather pants. Not only is he sexy, but he's uproariously funny (""Midori me!"").Normally remakes annoy me, but the remake of ""Fright Night"" ended up being one of the better vampire movies I've seen -- bloody, funny and weird.",4,"""And I seriously am so angry you think I read Twilight"".",1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,3188,"['have', 'confession', 'make', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'stoned', 'angry', 'mob', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'hated', 'was', 'bad', 'campy', 'style', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'So', 'perhaps', 'not', 'surprising', 'nostalgia', 'goggles', 'found', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'remake', 'eventually', 'got', 'made', 'lot', 'due', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'laid-back', 'casually', 'creepy', 'vampire-next-door.Charley', 'Brewster', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'understandably', 'annoyed', 'when', 'estranged', 'friend', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'Lee', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Jerry', 'Farrell', 'vampire', 'Then', 'Ed', 'vanishes', 'Charley', 'discovers', 'breaking', 'Jerry', 'basement', 'new', 'neighbor', 'indeed', 'vampire', 'Unfortunately', 'Jerry', 'also', 'Charley', 'vampire.Who', 'can', 'Charlie', 'turn', 'help', 'Why', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'No', 'seriously', 'David', 'Tennant', 'movie', 'leather-clad', 'foul-mouthed', 'Vegas', 'stage', 'magician', 'who', 'ALSO', 'be', 'vampire', 'expert', 'when', 'Jerry', 'home', 'kidnaps', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'Charley', 'take', 'fight', 'vampire.Colin', 'Farrell', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'Fright', 'Night', 'good', 'movie', 'mellow', 'laid-back', 'time', 'often', 'chuckling', 'humans', 'struggles', 'are', 'just', 'amusement', 'never', 'camp', 'cheese', 'Even', 'ordinary', 'un-vampirey', 'dialogue', 'somehow', 'underlaid', 'menace', 'when', 'Catch', 'later', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'vampire', 'who', 'can', 'sound', 'scary', 'just', 'asking', 'beer', 'also', 'really', 'nice', 'see', 'vampires', 'are', ""n't"", 'misunderstood', 'sad-eyed', 'woobies', 'who', 'just', 'need', 'love', 'vampires', 'are', 'vicious', 'malevolent', 'apparently', 'possessed', 'evil', 'force', 'only', 'moment', 'when', 'feel', 'sorry', 'when', 'briefly', 'revert', 'back', 'human', 'minds.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'actually', 'bit', 'classic', 'Dracula', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'Lucy', 'Jerry', 'Dracula', 'Amy', 'Mina', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Charley', 'composite', 'other', 'male', 'characters', 'lots', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'dialogue', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'narrow', 'down', 'mini-golf', 'sushi', 'bloodily', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'battle', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'Charley', '.Biggest', 'problem', 'CGI', 'vampire', 'pretty', 'horrible.None', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'QUITE', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Farrell', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Yelchin', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'ex-nerd', 'who', 'now', 'trying', 'be', 'non-', 'dweeby', 'enough', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'deliciously', 'warped', 'performance', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'who', 'have', 'bit', 'crush', 'Charley', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'Poots', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Colette', 'character', 'kind', 'superfluous.And', 'David', 'Tennant', 'oh', 'David', 'Tennant', 'completely', 'scene', 'whenever', 'onscreen', 'cussing', 'up', 'storm', 'slouching', 'around', 'very', 'tight', 'leather', 'pants', 'Not', 'only', 'sexy', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'Midori', '.Normally', 'remake', 'Fright', 'Night', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'better', 'vampire', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bloody', 'funny', 'weird']",Fright Night
1374094,AMMXFNJSKJUQ,B003Y5H5FG,ElectricMelody,"[1, 3]","**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 8/23/11**Fright Night was not a movie I was planning to see a few weeks ago. But then I started hearing such great things from critics and others that I had to give it a whirl. Plus, each year around this time there seems to be a supernatural-type film that makes no money at the box office but becomes a personal favorite (last year it was the brilliant Let Me In, still one of my favorite movies of the past few years, and before that it was Jennifer's Body). I was hoping this would follow suit, even though I knew nothing about the original. I was going into this one cold. Honestly, that's kind of how I left the theater, too.The main frustration I had with the film is that it kept reeling me in only to let me down. It was like the peaks on a roller coaster. One moment I'd be all excited, the next I'd be slouched back in my seat, daydreaming. To compare similar movies, in 2007 Disturbia managed to keep me hooked throughout. It's a hard thing to do. The problem with this one is that tension isn't allowed to build because the big reveal/mystery is pretty much spoiled in scene one. We know the creepy neighbor's a vampire, so what follows is basically your standard teen suspense film.However, the action sequences are frequently inspired, particularly an encounter on a dark Vegas highway and a scene in the middle of the film that, without giving too much away, subverts audience expectations and ends with a wonderfully sick surprise (and I'm not easily surprised). Colin Farrell makes an incredibly unnerving villain, and when he--and others--vamp up, they look pretty damn awesome. These aren't your friendly, sparkly vamps. There's a constant danger surrounding the film. The supporting cast, filled with familiar faces, is pretty strong too.I was less impressed with the casting of the lead.

1374102,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003Y5H5FG,Grady Harp,"[1, 9]","Confession: this viewer has not seen the original 1985 version of FRIGHT NIGHT and is not a fan of the interminable line of vampire movies that flood the screens year after year.  So why watch FRIGHT NIGHT 2011?  Seeing the names of fine actors such as Colin Farrell, Toni Colette, +/- Anton Yelchin suggested this might not be a bad movie if those actors committed to it.  And perhaps it is partly due to the fact that lack of exposure to this genre creates the problem of deciding why some people find these films funny while other find them frightening. So, preface over.  Given the virginal approach to this vampire film, this viewer finds it silly, poorly written, self indulgent - and  an unexplainable waste to talent.Tom Holland is recycled by Marti Nixon and the updated Las Vegas suburb community form is handed to director Craig Gillespie.  The 'plot' centers on the presence of one Jerry (Colin Farrell, subtle acting at first and then falls apart) as the resident vampire next door to Century 1 Realtor Jane Brewster (Toni Collette) and her nerdy son Charley (Anton Yelchin).  Charley's equally nerdy friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is convinced that Jerry is a vampire and carries crosses and stakes etc in preparation for meeting him (an early taste treat for Jerry, Ed becomes a ridiculously distorted mad man).  The two lads are mocked by fellow classmates Mark (Dave Franco, brother of James Franco) and Ben (Reid Ewing) and teased by the very beautiful Amy (Imogen Poots).  Kids go missing and soon Charley becomes a believer and form there on out it is a detective game to rout out Jerry.  Charley, once convinced that Jerry is indeed a vampire, seeks guidance from the alcoholic scare-showman Peter Vincent (David Tennant) who has secrets of his own.  Of course it is evident that it will turn out just fine, but getting there (to the end) is a tedious bore.  The musical score is by Ramin Djawadi and the cinematography (thankfully mostly in the after hours dark vampires so need) is by Javier Aguirresarobe.Perhaps this is funny to some and perhaps it is frightening to others: after all there is a faithful cult of addicts who run to the theaters whenever one of these vampire flicks is released.

1374103,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B003Y5H5FG,GratedTopping,"[3, 6]","This is the first movie I've rented/streamed online from the Amazon website. $1.99 was just fine: cheaper, of course, than a DVD rental or seeing it in the theatres. Nevertheless, I'm disappointed in the flick and didn't have fun with it.Here are some various thoughts:- I think it's fine that Peter Vincent was a magician/illusionist....but I was very-much hoping that that would be a part of it in someway. I was picturing a creative illusion or trickery that, in some way, fooled at least one of the vampires and led to its demise. I think that would have been awesome. Even though that didn't happen, lil' Petey's just a foul mouthed jerk and totally unlikable. A full-of-himself, ignorant, gross, alcoholic worm -- the worst part of the flick and totally opposite of the awesome Roddy McDowell and his distinguished representation of Mr. Vincent.- My favourite part here was actually quite tame: when Jerry was wanting Charlie's beer, but he couldn't come into the house since he wasn't invited. Charlie was 'testing' him...and Jerry couldn't even stick his hand in the doorway to reach for the beer, making it more obvious that something was amiss.- Jerry causing the house of the Brewster's to explode because he couldn't get invited in (and nobody in the neighbourhood noticing). Give me a break. As well, the Brewster's didn't even seem to care much afterwards that they lost everything!- Amy is just eye-candy, as is the mom. For the women in the audience, Jerry would be as well...but they are all disposable characters that are boring and smile too much.- Ed (aka 'Evil') was just a normal nerd and within the first few minutes he comes out and tells Charlie that Jerry is a vampire. It was better when Charlie was trying to convince 'Evil' and others that there was a a vampire living next to him. What about Ed's evidence? I saw Charlie checking it out on the Ed's computer after Ed was killed -- but it seemed to show nothing of interest. Ed should have had more of a part, as he was kinda cool to this nerd.- They say that Chris Sarandon (the original Jerry in the 1985 version) made an appearance but I didn't notice. Oh well. 12.21 UPDATE: He's the driver who pulled-up to see what was going on and was bitten by the new Jerry Dandrige. I had no clue; of course he didn't look like he did over 25 years ago, yet he didn't sound the same either.- Dandrige was duller than a lone razor in a barber shop. He didn't change form into a bat or wolf, which vampires did in the original; had no scary/appropriate voice; died fast and boredme even faster. Well, at least he still eats the apples. An apple a day keeps the dentist away (that's how the saying should go, as I've learned that's more accurate). Does he go to a nighttime dentist if there's such a thing? Do vampires get cavities? That's one question I'd love to have answered and another expectation that was a letdown in this flick. (Don't be ridiculous and take that serious).- Charlie 'gearing-up' was cool and his idea which came to fruition at the end was pretty-cool. It was the only thing of originality. I liked how it ended Dandridge and it was worthwhile -- yet it all happened too quickly and there wasn't much suspense. The CGI looked like garbage, too, throughout the flick and some of the other vampire's endings were very ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer""-like (of course, being written by Marti Noxon as well, I think that would be expected).Anyway, ""Welcome to 'Fright Night'...for fake."" should be the tag line for this. Go ahead and rent it online. It can be passable at occasional moments, but I didn't enjoy it. CGI is not good for this re-imagining and non-computer effects would have been better.

1374108,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003Y5H5FG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","As if the housing mortgage dilemma isn't enough of a bummer, here come the vampires to further sabotage the property values. A pervading sense of isolation informs the opening moments of FRIGHT NIGHT as the camera sweeps into a shot of a desolate Vegas suburban sprawl entirely surrounded by desert. It's an unsettling image. It sets you up for the terrifying stuff later on.This is a neighborhood in which blackened or boarded up windows are common sights, what with foreclosing as the new norm (hey, thanks, economy) and many residents in the community who tend to work night shifts and sleep during the day. So what's another house with darkened windows? Teenager Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) doesn't think twice of his new next-door-neighbor, Jerry Dandrige (Colin Farrell), who keeps strange hours and has unsightly dumpsters and debris decorating his lawn. But then people start vanishing, and it's at this point that Charley's estranged nerd chum, Ed Lee (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), begins accusing Charley's charming new neighbor of being a vampire. All of a sudden, Charley, who always did stress out too much, has a new thing to worry about. Especially since Jerry seems to be eyeing his single mom (Toni Collette) and his hot girlfriend (Imogen Poots).Let us not talk falsely now. This remake doesn't hold a candle to the original. Yep, I'm one of them what loves the 1985 version, and so the most telling points for me are that this, er, revamp dispenses with the original's more subtle touches and that Tennant's Peter Vincent doesn't have as many showcase moments as did McDowall's Peter Vincent. And there are several missed opportunities, I think. Sin City itself, Las Vegas, for instance, could've been featured more prominently as a secondary character, that old den of decadence. I can't think of any other place so well suited for vampires. In that sequence in Peter Vincent's posh apartment which has Charley and Amy fighting for their lives, it's practically wasteful how Peter Vincent's collection of vampire-slaying paraphernalia wasn't employed near enough in taking out the undead. And Jerry, our 400-year-old monster, does seem to have an odd way of keeping a low profile. He's supposed to be trying to blend in. What he does after the Brewsters wouldn't invite him in is pretty over the top and something that's bound to attract glaring attention. So that didn't make sense.But those are the quibbles. What are the good bits? I thought the acting was solid all across, although Yelchin may be getting too old to play high schoolers. Colin Farrell submits a more scruffy, more feral bloodsucker than did Chris Sarandon, although he's just as charming. It's a different take, that's all, and not a bad one, at that. (By the way, Sarandon shows up in a cameo as a victim.) Farrell exudes this shady vibe. There's a very well done scene in which Jerry is standing right outside the open doorway of Charley's house, waiting for Charley to lend his a six-pack of beer. It's apparent that he's waiting for Charley to ask him in, but Charley at this stage has got the wind up, is starting to put the pieces together. You can feel that aura of menace just start to build and emanate from Jerry as he realizes that he's not going to get an invite after all. It's one of the best scenes in the film. Meanwhile, David Tennant makes the most of his showy role, playing the boozy and indifferent Las Vegas stage magician who's boned up on vampire methodology. He's fun to watch and his Peter Vincent is very different from his Doctor Who role. But he's no Roddy McDowall. For that matter, when it comes to playing Evil Ed, Christopher Mintz-Plasse doesn't have the impact of a Stephen Geoffreys.I do recommend FRIGHT NIGHT the remake. There are pretty good scares, although, as in the original version, it flirts with the tongue-in-cheek stuff. This plays right in the wheelhouse of screenplay writer Marti Noxen, who used to pen episodes of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Maybe the highest compliment I could pay this FRIGHT NIGHT is that it sort of recaptures that cool LOST BOYS vibe. Not that I'm saying this is as good as THE LOST BOYS. But if you see this playing on cable, stop and look. At least these vampires don't have sparkles.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Bloopers (00:03:25 minutes)- Kid Cudi ""No One Believes Me"" Music Video (Uncensored Version)- the Squid Man sequence - Extended & Uncut (00:02:56 minutes)",4,"""He's not broody or lovesick or noble.

I apologize if I failed.)This is an excellent adaptation of the original 1985 version, while managing to avoid some of the clich&eacute;s that showed up in that movie. It does fall prey to some of the newer clich&eacute;s, of course, but the loss of his necromantic Renfield from the first movie script was a definite improvement. As was the removal of the whole &#34;reminding him of a woman he loved&#34; nonsense.The characters are memorable and relatable. I got to marvel at Tennant's range in a way that I would never have expected, as I've only seen him in Doctor Who before this. (IF I'm honest, getting to see what else he could do was part of the draw for this movie.) I fell in love with the very geeky recasting of Ed - frequently referred to as &#34;Evil&#34; in the 1985 version. And Amy was - gasp, choke - actually fairly intelligent and insightful when it came to exactly what she wanted in her relationships.The vampires are actually vampires. You see examples of super strength, hearing and such. There is no &#34;hiding&#34; of his capabilities from his victims or from people that actually knew he was a vampire.And, the change from &#34;aging TV star&#34; to &#34;Vegas Magician Star&#34; was an excellent idea. Let's be honest, after all, not many TV shows are actually made in the cities that they are broadcast from. Widespread syndication is a wonderful thing in that it allows us to see and share comments on shows with people all over the country, but it ruined the plot from the first movie when it became the standard for even late-night television. (I'll not get into other syndication drawbacks. Very off topic.)In short, I loved it. I bought it. I will watch it again. (And again.

Considering how many stories feature romanticized bloodsuckers, or ones that sparkle in sunlight instead of turning to ash, it's such a delight to get a film that gives us charming, but exceedingly dangerous vampires who aren't afraid to seduce you and those you love before sinking their fangs into your flesh.""Fright Night"" follows the story of Charley, a typical teenager living out in Las Vegas with his mother.  Life is simple:  he goes to school, has geeky friends, and a nice girlfriend.  But when his classmates start disappearing, Charlie soon realizes that a man named Jerry, while charming and handsome, is actually a vampire who's out to suck as much blood as he can, and has set his sights on the people Charlie cares about most.  The only problem?  Jerry happens to be Charley's neighbor.What makes ""Fright Night"" so effective is that it's an effective blend of horror and action.  While there's plenty of stabbings, shootings, and stuff getting thrown about, there's also some very effective horror moments:  Jerry is a charming and charismatic, but at the same time, he's different from other classic vampires in that while some of the traditional anti-vampire charms work, others don't, which lends the film a good sense of tense mystery, as we don't know what, if anything, will harm or kill Jerry.  And while the action and horror compliment each other really well, and carry the film from beginning to end, there is a nice dash of humor to be found in David Tennant's performance of Peter Vincent, a stage performer who's a great mix of charisma and over the top theatrics.Overall, ""Fright Night"" is a refreshing take on the Vampire mythos:  With it's strong cast, effective blend of horror and action, and a touch of mystery, it makes for a surprisingly well done film, and a breath of fresh air in a genre that's been sucked dry by vampire overload.",4,A bloody good time,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1978,"['When', 'one', 'look', 'vampires', 'media', 'days', 'wonder', 'manage', 'stand', 'out', 'Considering', 'how', 'many', 'stories', 'feature', 'romanticized', 'bloodsuckers', 'ones', 'sparkle', 'sunlight', 'instead', 'turning', 'ash', 'such', 'delight', 'get', 'film', 'charming', 'exceedingly', 'dangerous', 'vampires', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'seduce', 'love', 'sinking', 'fangs', 'flesh', 'Fright', 'Night', 'story', 'Charley', 'typical', 'teenager', 'living', 'out', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'mother', 'Life', 'simple', 'school', 'geeky', 'friends', 'nice', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'classmates', 'start', 'disappearing', 'Charlie', 'soon', 'man', 'named', 'Jerry', 'charming', 'handsome', 'actually', 'vampire', 'who', 'out', 'suck', 'as', 'much', 'blood', 'can', 'set', 'sights', 'people', 'Charlie', 'most', 'only', 'problem', 'Jerry', 'be', 'Charley', 'neighbor.What', 'Fright', 'Night', 'so', 'effective', 'effective', 'blend', 'horror', 'action', 'plenty', 'stabbings', 'shootings', 'stuff', 'getting', 'thrown', 'about', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'horror', 'moments', 'Jerry', 'charming', 'charismatic', 'same', 'time', 'different', 'other', 'classic', 'vampires', 'traditional', 'anti-vampire', 'charms', 'work', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'film', 'good', 'sense', 'tense', 'mystery', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'anything', 'will', 'harm', 'kill', 'Jerry', 'action', 'horror', 'compliment', 'other', 'really', 'well', 'carry', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'nice', 'dash', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'David', 'Tennant', 'performance', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'stage', 'performer', 'who', 'great', 'mix', 'charisma', 'top', 'theatrics.Overall', 'Fright', 'Night', 'refreshing', 'take', 'Vampire', 'mythos', 'strong', 'cast', 'effective', 'blend', 'horror', 'action', 'touch', 'mystery', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'genre', 'been', 'sucked', 'dry', 'vampire', 'overload']",Fright Night

1374114,A3OWYPKRZE96E3,B003Y5H5FG,Jake Shore,"[38, 52]","I have long lamented the fact that vampires, one of the great antagonists of literature and mythology, have been so poorly translated to film.  Since 1922's Nosferatu, you can count the number of good vampire movies on one hand.  What's worse is how the portrayal of vampires has transformed from the embodiment of pure evil, to sympathetic vagabond, and now, sexy hero.In 1985, before this idiotic evolution, Fright Night was released in theaters.  The movie centered around a high school kid, Charlie, who comes to realize that a vampire, a fellow by the name of Jerry, has moved into the house next door.  When he tries to convince his girlfriend and best friend, they laugh at him.  But his insistence begins to worry them, so they enlist the help of Peter Vincent, an aging star of a recently canceled late night horror show, played by Roddy McDowall (Cornelius from Planet of the Apes).  His friends hope this vampire ""expert"" will prove to Charlie that their neighbor is no creature of the night. When Mr. Vincent realizes Jerry really is a bloodsucker, he eventually helps Charlie exterminate the creature.  Chris Sarandon (Prince Humperdinck of ""The Princess Bride"") gives a great performance that is both charming and malevolent as the evil neighbor.  The movie is a little dated, with 80s styles and music, but it's still among the best of the genre.  And it blends humor and horror as well any film ever has.The folks over at DreamWorks apparently felt this formula would work again in 2011. And since Hollywood is loathe to produce original material these days, a remake was in order.  This remake works largely because of timing.  In an era where vampires have become cute, misunderstood teen idols, audiences are ready for vampires who are just ruthless monsters, unencumbered by guilt or angst over their existence.The new Fright Night takes place in Las Vegas; an ideal place for a vampire to blend in because of its transient population that works all night and sleeps all day.  Overall, the remake has a superior cast.  Colin Farrell takes over as the not so friendly neighbor, Jerry.  Although I think he's a good actor, I have to say that I have long suffered from an acute case of Colin Farrell fatigue caused by his appearance in one out every three movies released from 2002-2006.  But Farrell is up to the challenge.  His Jerry is a sadistic and unrelenting killer.  He lacks the elegance and panache of Sarandon, but is every bit as charming.  Anton Yelchin (Chekov in the new Star Trek) plays Charlie, a kid who is trying hard to distance himself from his nerdy past and nerdy friends in order to win the affection of a pretty girl.  This time, Peter Vincent is a Vegas magician and narcissistic drunk hilariously brought to life by David Tennant (Doctor Who).  The movie has a few good scares and more than few good laughs.  If I was a movie critic, I would say it's ""wickedly funny.""Fright Night moves fast, running from scene to scene, rarely slowing down for anything, which is too bad because its best scenes happen when the movie slows down to build the tension.  One such scene occurs when Jerry tries and tries to get a suspicious Charlie to invite him into the house.  Another when Charlie attempts to rescue one of Jerry's victims.  But the movie prefers a sprinters pace, so it can feel a little rushed at times.  There is also a few scenes with annoying CGI blood that's squirts at the camera intended for the 3D version.  But none of this keeps Fright Night from being a highly enjoyable date movie, quite possibly the most fun I've had at the theater this year.

Peter Vincent (David Tennant) is being advertised on television performing his shows at the Hard Rock Casino. The house appears to be quiet with the dog walking around.Suddenly a teenage boy, Adam (Will Denton), is being thrown out the bedroom door. He is frantic. He is trying to get away from something. The dog just stands there and watches him.Adam goes back into the bedroom. We see two people dead. Their neck has been ripped open. He takes a gun from under the mattress. The creature is back in the room.Charlie (Anton Yelchin) likes girls. He is secure. He likes Amy (Imogen Poots). A new neighbor has moved in next door, but what is it with the dumpster and concrete?Charlie is annoyed by Evil Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and is not returning his calls. Nick and Adam did not show up for school. Evil Ed has also noticed they have disappeared.Charlie's mom (Toni Collette) is getting to know the new neighbor, Jerry (Colin Farrell).Evil Ed is worried about Adam and looks in his home. He proceeds to tell Charlie that his next door neighbor is a vampire. Charlie becomes irritated at Evil and doesn't believe him. When Evil brings up Amy, Charlie violently pushes him down on the ground.Evil Ed will soon find out he is right about Jerry.Also in the cast: Dave Franco, Rick A. Ortega Jr., Lisa Loeb. Remember singer Lisa Loeb (""Stay (I Missed You)""?Chris Sarandon who played ""Jerry Dandridge"" in the originalFright Night(1985) makes a surprise appearance.Actually filmed in Albuouerque, New Mexico. Shots of Las Vegas were inserted.Score recorded at Sony Pictures and Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage.Can you believe this movie was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures?I did not like this version of Fright Night (2011). This ""Charlie"" was too abusive to his friend Evil Ed. The original ""Charley"" played by William Ragsdale in the originalFright Night (1985) [Blu-ray] was funny.This ""Amy"" of 2011 does not appeal to me. The original ""Amy"" of 1985 played by Amanda Bearse was cute, had morals, possibly a virgin.This Evil Ed was acceptable, but who can ever compare with the performance of fragile ""Evil"" Ed played by Stephen Geoffreys who was perfect for the role.David Tennant took some getting used to as The Vampire Killer. I know him from his role as ""Dr. Who"" (2005-10). They had him play ""Peter Vincent"" as a rock 'n' roll-Las Vegas showman type.The original ""Peter Vincent"" was played by the well known Roddy McDowall in Fright Night (1985) andFright Night Part II(1988). Vincent was an actor, horror tv show host and actually could kill a vampire.I'm a big fan of the original Fright Night (1985), so watching this 2011 version, shows me how much times have really changed and how being young has changed.I liked the surprise appearance of Chris Sarandon and some of the special effects I have never seen before. Good acting from Colin Farrell. However, I did not like this 2011 version.Followed by the direct-to-DVD sequel,Fright Night 2 (Blu-ray Combo Pack)(2013).Fright Night(1985) still rules!",1,"Awful remake, but some effects interesting.",1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3143,"['Saw', 'Fright', 'Night', '2011', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'Demand.Rated', 'R', 'Running', 'Time', '1', 'hour', '45', 'mins.We', 'are', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Nevada', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'David', 'Tennant', 'being', 'advertised', 'television', 'performing', 'shows', 'Hard', 'Rock', 'Casino', 'house', 'be', 'quiet', 'dog', 'walking', 'around.Suddenly', 'teenage', 'boy', 'Adam', 'Will', 'Denton', 'being', 'thrown', 'out', 'bedroom', 'door', 'frantic', 'trying', 'get', 'away', 'something', 'dog', 'just', 'watches', 'him.Adam', 'back', 'bedroom', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'dead', 'neck', 'been', 'ripped', 'open', 'gun', 'mattress', 'creature', 'back', 'room.Charlie', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'girls', 'secure', 'Amy', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'new', 'neighbor', 'moved', 'next', 'door', 'what', 'dumpster', 'concrete', 'Charlie', 'annoyed', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'not', 'returning', 'calls', 'Nick', 'Adam', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'school', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'also', 'noticed', 'have', 'disappeared.Charlie', 'mom', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'getting', 'know', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Jerry', 'Colin', 'Farrell', '.Evil', 'Ed', 'worried', 'Adam', 'home', 'tell', 'Charlie', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'vampire', 'Charlie', 'becomes', 'irritated', 'Evil', ""n't"", 'believe', 'When', 'Evil', 'up', 'Amy', 'Charlie', 'violently', 'down', 'ground.Evil', 'Ed', 'will', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'right', 'Jerry.Also', 'cast', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'Rick', 'A.', 'Ortega', 'Jr.', 'Lisa', 'Loeb', 'Remember', 'singer', 'Lisa', 'Loeb', 'Stay', 'Missed', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'played', 'Jerry', 'Dandridge', 'originalFright', 'Night', '1985', 'surprise', 'appearance.Actually', 'filmed', 'Albuouerque', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Shots', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'were', 'inserted.Score', 'recorded', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Scoring', 'Stage.Can', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'distributed', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Pictures', 'did', 'not', 'version', 'Fright', 'Night', '2011', 'Charlie', 'was', 'too', 'abusive', 'friend', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'original', 'Charley', 'played', 'William', 'Ragsdale', 'originalFright', 'Night', '1985', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'was', 'funny.This', 'Amy', '2011', 'not', 'appeal', 'original', 'Amy', '1985', 'played', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'was', 'cute', 'had', 'morals', 'possibly', 'virgin.This', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'was', 'acceptable', 'who', 'can', 'ever', 'compare', 'performance', 'fragile', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Geoffreys', 'who', 'was', 'perfect', 'role.David', 'Tennant', 'took', 'getting', 'used', 'Vampire', 'Killer', 'know', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Who', '2005-10', 'had', 'play', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'rock', 'n', 'roll-Las', 'Vegas', 'showman', 'type.The', 'original', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'was', 'played', 'well', 'known', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'Fright', 'Night', '1985', 'andFright', 'Night', 'Part', 'II', '1988', 'Vincent', 'was', 'actor', 'horror', 'tv', 'show', 'host', 'actually', 'could', 'kill', 'vampire.I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', '1985', 'so', 'watching', '2011', 'version', 'how', 'much', 'times', 'have', 'really', 'changed', 'how', 'being', 'young', 'changed.I', 'liked', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Good', 'acting', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'However', 'did', 'not', '2011', 'version.Followed', 'direct-to-DVD', 'sequel', 'Fright', 'Night', '2', 'Blu-ray', 'Combo', 'Pack', '2013', '.Fright', 'Night', '1985', 'still', 'rules']",Fright Night
1374116,A1CFJ70GFMBGZJ,B003Y5H5FG,"jamespen ""none""","[6, 10]","This is such an amateur, gutless typically tepid Hollywood remake. The film spends way too much time superficially developing the vapid relationship between the lead character and his popular girlfriend. The lead character, Charlie, is made to be a phony who would turn his back on his best friend just to be popular. The lead character's best friend, Ed, is not nearly as unique as he was in the original. Most disappointing, is the fact that Ed's story arc is not handled with any psychological or deep-emotional impact as it was in the original Fright Night. Colin Ferrell does a good job as Jerry, but his character is written without any dimension. Like almost every character in this film Ferrell's character feels as if he has no past. He's just an idea on a piece of paper. David Tennent does a good job with his interpretation of Peter Vincent but the character in this remake is way too pretentious and cowardly, and Tennant's performance isn't charming enough to make the character endearing to the audience. The original Peter Vincent may've been pretentious and cowardly, but Roddy McDowell's performance, along with Todd Holland's original vision, made Peter Vincent someone you wanted to cheer for. Lastly, the special effects are completely unconvincing. You'd think when they saw how fake some of the special effects looked they would've said, ""Maybe we should work on that some more.""Like it is with many remakes, the heart and soul is missing from the remake of Fright Night. Everything about the original seemed lovingly produced.  Unlike the original, this film just feels like another movie that the participants will likely forget just as quickly as this summer's movie-going audience forgot it.

1374118,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B003Y5H5FG,Jason,"[4, 10]","To remake the original Fright Night, widely considered a fan favorite by both horror fans and non-fans alike, is a difficult endeavor to accomplish.  The original was cleverly done, but had subject matter gravitas when good eventually met evil.  Fright Night redux, while a decent movie in its own right, fails in this regard, instead making a slicker, hipper version that takes advantage of contemporary actors who, for the most part, don't fill the shoes of their predecessors.  Both stories are essentially the same: A vampire named Jerry (Sarandon (1985)/Farrell (2011)) moves into a quiet neighborhood right next to Charley Brewster (Ragsdale/Yelchin), a teenage boy whose girlfriend is out of his league (Bearse/Poots), and best friend nicknamed Evil (Geoffreys/Mintze-Plasse) is the quintessential nerd.  Charley seeks the help of his friends, family, and famous vampire killer Peter Vincent (McDowall/Tennant) to stop Jerry from sucking the town dry.A character comparison between the two movies is unfair.  None of the actors save Imogen Poots is an upgrade to the former.  Colin Farrell broods and delivers lines slowly, but he lacks the sophistication of Chris Sarandon.  Mintze-Plasse can never shake off the McLovin moniker, and is a far cry from the oddity that was/is Stephen Geoffreys (who, judging from his IMDB page, now holds the camera for male-on-male adult films).  Yelchin is a fine young actor, but doesn't exude the spineless jellyfish that made Ragsdale's performance so perfect.  And to compare David Tennant to Roddy McDowall is downright offensive.  With that said, the film did have some upside.The story deviations allow for a sequel with bite, but without completely desecrating a film so many love.  A minor modification with one character's back story, a much quicker entry into the second act and subsequent tension (nearly no build up or character development, just straight into vampire huntin'), and an interesting extension to vampire lore without getting all glittery and sparkly, all help the remake's uniqueness.  Sort of.  While Sarandon may have been more sinister, there is no doubt that Farrell looks more dangerous.  Farrell's version of Jerry is one that doesn't look prissy, just stalking prey with the famed seduction skills of vampires; instead, lethally quick attacks and superhuman strength serve as killing instincts ferocious enough to get a National Geographic voiceover.  It may be cultural, or a sign of the times, but all the characters except McLovin are tougher, edgier, and can realistically be thrown into a confrontation.Naturally, the special effects were vastly improved.  Expected.  I'm not a big fan of 3D, and the add-ons for this film appear to be monetarily driven (read: minimal and underwhelming), so I am fairly certain the 2D version of this film will suffice.  Having said that, there is plenty of blood splatter, stakes through the heart, and human-to-vampire-to-human transformation to distance this film from the original.  Avoiding the cheesy bat from the original was a big upgrade.Overall I was entertained but not overwhelmed.  Much better than other blasphemous remakes that have been made in recent years (looking at you Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan), but still lacking originality or a true reason for the remake.",3,Trite Night,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,3298,"['remake', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', 'widely', 'considered', 'fan', 'favorite', 'horror', 'fans', 'non-fans', 'alike', 'difficult', 'endeavor', 'accomplish', 'original', 'was', 'cleverly', 'done', 'had', 'subject', 'matter', 'gravitas', 'when', 'good', 'eventually', 'met', 'evil', 'Fright', 'Night', 'redux', 'decent', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'regard', 'instead', 'making', 'slicker', 'hipper', 'version', 'advantage', 'contemporary', 'actors', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'fill', 'shoes', 'predecessors', 'stories', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'vampire', 'named', 'Jerry', 'Sarandon', '1985', '/Farrell', '2011', 'quiet', 'neighborhood', 'right', 'next', 'Charley', 'Brewster', 'Ragsdale/Yelchin', 'teenage', 'boy', 'girlfriend', 'league', 'Bearse/Poots', 'best', 'friend', 'nicknamed', 'Evil', 'Geoffreys/Mintze-Plasse', 'quintessential', 'nerd', 'Charley', 'help', 'friends', 'family', 'famous', 'vampire', 'killer', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'McDowall/Tennant', 'stop', 'Jerry', 'sucking', 'town', 'dry.A', 'character', 'comparison', 'two', 'movies', 'unfair', 'None', 'actors', 'save', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'upgrade', 'former', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'broods', 'delivers', 'lines', 'slowly', 'sophistication', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'Mintze-Plasse', 'can', 'never', 'shake', 'off', 'McLovin', 'moniker', 'far', 'cry', 'oddity', 'Stephen', 'Geoffreys', 'who', 'judging', 'IMDB', 'page', 'now', 'camera', 'male-on-male', 'adult', 'films', 'Yelchin', 'fine', 'young', 'actor', ""n't"", 'exude', 'spineless', 'jellyfish', 'made', 'Ragsdale', 'performance', 'so', 'perfect', 'compare', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'downright', 'offensive', 'said', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'upside.The', 'story', 'deviations', 'allow', 'sequel', 'bite', 'completely', 'desecrating', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'love', 'minor', 'modification', 'one', 'character', 'back', 'story', 'much', 'quicker', 'entry', 'second', 'act', 'subsequent', 'tension', 'nearly', 'build', 'up', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'straight', 'vampire', 'huntin', 'interesting', 'extension', 'vampire', 'lore', 'getting', 'glittery', 'sparkly', 'help', 'remake', 'uniqueness', 'Sort', 'Sarandon', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'sinister', 'doubt', 'Farrell', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Farrell', 'version', 'Jerry', 'one', ""n't"", 'look', 'prissy', 'just', 'stalking', 'prey', 'famed', 'seduction', 'skills', 'vampires', 'instead', 'lethally', 'quick', 'attacks', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'serve', 'killing', 'instincts', 'ferocious', 'enough', 'get', 'National', 'Geographic', 'voiceover', 'may', 'be', 'cultural', 'sign', 'times', 'characters', 'McLovin', 'are', 'tougher', 'edgier', 'can', 'realistically', 'be', 'thrown', 'confrontation.Naturally', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'vastly', 'improved', 'Expected', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', '3D', 'add-ons', 'film', 'appear', 'be', 'monetarily', 'driven', 'read', 'minimal', 'underwhelming', 'so', 'am', 'fairly', 'certain', '2D', 'version', 'film', 'will', 'suffice', 'Having', 'said', 'plenty', 'blood', 'splatter', 'stakes', 'heart', 'human-to-vampire-to-human', 'transformation', 'distance', 'film', 'original', 'Avoiding', 'cheesy', 'bat', 'original', 'was', 'big', 'upgrade.Overall', 'was', 'entertained', 'not', 'overwhelmed', 'Much', 'better', 'other', 'blasphemous', 'remakes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'recent', 'years', 'looking', 'Jaden', 'Smith', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'still', 'lacking', 'originality', 'true', 'reason', 'remake']",Fright Night

1374121,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B003Y5H5FG,Jean-ren Leroux,"[0, 2]","I wouldn't normally take time to talk about this movie but I'd like to make a point about something that saddens me within Hollywood and that is: the darn endings.You have a story that is not original but is still fun and enticing. You have characters that are functioning as archetypes but are still engaging and charismatic. You have the  technical aspect of the film that is, as far as I can see, first rate. The creators obviously had fun and seemed to be honest about the simple pleasure they wanted to share with us. Everybody, it's plain to see, has given their best and a bit more in order to entertain us. The actors, in particular, are way better than what would normally be expected for that kind of product. Even the score is better than average. Plus, the writers are dealing right away with some plot twists in order to move forward instead of stretching them endlessly until the end. And as far as being a remake, the movie was even surprising at some point with some changes here and there, especially in the point of view about who believes what.But there you have it. All of this is wasted on the fact that a darn product from Hollywood has to last about two hours and needs to have a big ending with lots of special effects. In this case, what the creators had set up was very promising. But it was too much for 120 minutes. At some point, they needed to conclude and wrap up everything in a big fiery conclusion. What had taken a long time to install now needed to be rush to the end. As soon as Jerry the vampire arrives in Vegas, the rest of the movie is sadly lost in a whirlwind of special effects and over the top story devices all made to conclude the story with a bang! Therefore, a character well drawn like Jerry Dandridge, who says: ""What were you thinking, Charley? That you would just going to walk in here with your little crossbow, and put to bed four hundred years of survival?"" is left to die like a debutant almost right after saying that great line!And because everything needs to be rushed, characters are starting to make no sense. For example, Charley is trying to tell his mom about vampires but he has no time to explain... cause the story needs to move along. And he gets upset that she does not believe him! Furthermore, he's scared that his neighbor (Jerry the vampire) might kill her but he tells his mom to trust him and that she simply should not talk to jerry... and he gets out! Without further explanations!So what do you have? A great pop corn movie, promising and better than average, but that is sadly botched away by an over the top ending and a need to wrap up everything real fast. The well drawn characters are therefore becoming stupid and the great setting up of the story is wasted. A common trend in Hollywood.They should take example on how the rest of the world, especially the Europeans, are finishing their movies in general. I'm not talking about the rest of their cinematography, their philosophy and how they construct their narratives. Just the end.

Dull, by-the-numbers, and banal action sequences attempt to carry the day through special effects what wit and skilled directing did in the original.I understand why Tennant did the film.

I really like the original Fright Night with Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowell.  Now that was a great combination against each other!  This is a great udate of that movie.  Colin Ferell is a great Jerry Dandridge and he doesn't try to copy the original Jerry.  However, his Jerry is just as vicious and there is no reference to a past love like the original.  This Jerry Dandridge (2011 style) is just plain vicious.  He just wants to suck your blood dry and then throw you out like yesterdays garbage, and better yet he wants to make some victims into Vampires as well.  The scene is not set in Los Angeles like the original, but in Las Vegas.  The hero Charley Brewster (portrayed excellently by Anton Yelchin) is in with the ""cool kids"" of his high school.  Unfortunately, one of his best friends is the geeky ""Evil Ed"" played by Christopher Mintz Plasse who tries to warn Charley that there is something BAD ""in the air"".  Charley's girlfriend is beautiful played by Imogen Poots as Amy.  This time Jerry Dandridge doesn't look at her as a resemblance of a past love, but as a potential Vampire to harass Charlie. Also, this Jerry doesn't have an assistant like the original Jerry did in 1985.I am sure you all know the details of the movie so I wont get into that.  It is great that Chris Sarandon makes a suprize cameo in the film, unfortunately well...I won't spoil that suprize.  This has great special effects and this time Peter Vincent is alot more bizare than that played by Roddy McDowell.  That is okay because David Tennant plays Vincent with great flourish, though you find out he has a family past with Jerry Dandridge.  Okay, that is all I am going to say about the plot.  Overall, what a great movie this is and I can't wait to watch it over again.

I wasn't sure if a reboot had any chance to work. After seeing it today, I have to admit that I am very impressed overall.Colin Farrell's Jerry Dandridge was much more menacing than expected. Although we do find out more about this Jerry than Chris Sarandon's, Colin's isn't suave and has no humanity - he's just a cold killer.Charley Brewster, his mother, Amy and Evil Ed (now Lee instead of Thompson) are better developed and more believable in the 2011 version.David Tennant's performance as Peter Vincent is a highlight of the film. His knowledge of vampires and collection of artifacts and weapons is pretty substantial. My only disappointment with this Peter Vincent is that he didn't find his faith, which was what the original was all about to me.The story has been brought out of the 80s, and hopefully will appeal to modern audiences who wouldn't appreciate the original like those of us who saw it in theaters.Lots of suspense, and the action barely pauses once it starts. Of course, the special effects are much better than the original (really glad they kept the huge vampire mouths - they still creep me out!), and the 3-D was well-done and fun.If I had a choice of which Jerry I'd rather live next to, it would definitely be Chris Sarandon's.

Abrams perfected the formula with Star Trek, and Matthew Vaughn followed suit, adopting a very similar tone with X Men: First Class. These are electric, exuberant reboots which exude youth and gloss. Fright Night, in theory, only manages to snuggle alongside two of these other films on a loose basis. But it's not until proper viewing that it becomes clear that all of these films are built upon very similar foundations; they may not be neighbors, but they certainly share the same suburban neighborhood.Well, fair enough. I can dig this new scene, if only for the fact that its approach has resulted in a provocative, acceptably tense vampire movie that respects the lore and retains the sex symbol attractions without adhering to Twilight's rules. A little bit of this has to do with Gillespie's brash directing, but the rest of the charm owes itself to Colin Ferrell, who seems despicably confident in a role like this. His hip, lax attitude is a refreshing take on the everyday vampire; there's not a drop of teenage angst to be found, here, folks, and that even applies to the rest of the cast.Upcomer Yelchin shows range as the cry wolf kid who takes vampire killing matters into his own hands, Poots (what an unfortunate last name) who was encouraging in her past role in 28 Weeks later, doesn't disappoint, and Mintz-Plasse is Mintz-Plasse. The surprising inclusion of David Tennant is an odd choice that almost pays off, but his pompous, pseudo Russel Brand tendencies seem out of place before the credits start to role. For all of its style and humor, the suspense often feels like the black sheep stuck on the outside. Gillespie is clearly eager to get to the money shots, with hardly fifteen minutes going by before Jerry claims his first victim on the big screen.It works for its strong moments of intensity but, for what it's worth, this is a giddy date movie if there ever was one, and you'll do well to find your scares elsewhere. I was initially hard pressed in justifying a remake for a film that so fully embodies the term ""cult classic"", to the point where, I'd suspect, at least half of the audience thought of this as a standalone. But it's difficult to argue with things done right, even if they don't stay true to their roots. The original Fright Night is a self-conscious classic that undoubtedly inspired the likes of ""Scream"". All that Gillespie's new take will likely recall is a thankful - if forgettable - alternative to the vampire scene of present, but if anything' worth your time anymore, it's something new.",3,Fright Night,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2604,"['Well', 'certainly', 'love', 'spunky', 'reboots', 'days', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'perfected', 'formula', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'followed', 'suit', 'adopting', 'very', 'similar', 'tone', 'X', 'Men', 'First', 'Class', 'are', 'electric', 'exuberant', 'reboots', 'exude', 'youth', 'gloss', 'Fright', 'Night', 'theory', 'only', 'snuggle', 'alongside', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'loose', 'basis', 'not', 'proper', 'viewing', 'clear', 'films', 'are', 'built', 'very', 'similar', 'foundations', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'neighbors', 'certainly', 'share', 'same', 'suburban', 'neighborhood.Well', 'fair', 'enough', 'can', 'dig', 'new', 'scene', 'only', 'fact', 'approach', 'resulted', 'provocative', 'acceptably', 'tense', 'vampire', 'movie', 'lore', 'sex', 'symbol', 'attractions', 'adhering', 'Twilight', 'rules', 'little', 'bit', 'do', 'Gillespie', 'brash', 'directing', 'rest', 'charm', 'Colin', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'despicably', 'confident', 'role', 'hip', 'lax', 'attitude', 'refreshing', 'take', 'everyday', 'vampire', 'not', 'drop', 'teenage', 'angst', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'folks', 'even', 'applies', 'rest', 'cast.Upcomer', 'Yelchin', 'range', 'cry', 'wolf', 'kid', 'who', 'vampire', 'killing', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Poots', 'what', 'unfortunate', 'last', 'name', 'who', 'was', 'encouraging', 'past', 'role', '28', 'Weeks', 'later', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'surprising', 'inclusion', 'David', 'Tennant', 'odd', 'choice', 'almost', 'pompous', 'pseudo', 'Russel', 'Brand', 'tendencies', 'seem', 'place', 'credits', 'start', 'role', 'style', 'humor', 'suspense', 'often', 'black', 'sheep', 'stuck', 'outside', 'Gillespie', 'clearly', 'eager', 'get', 'money', 'shots', 'hardly', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'going', 'Jerry', 'first', 'victim', 'big', 'screen.It', 'strong', 'moments', 'intensity', 'what', 'worth', 'giddy', 'date', 'movie', 'ever', 'was', 'one', ""'ll"", 'do', 'well', 'find', 'scares', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'initially', 'hard', 'pressed', 'justifying', 'remake', 'film', 'so', 'fully', 'term', 'cult', 'classic', 'point', 'where', ""'d"", 'suspect', 'least', 'half', 'audience', 'thought', 'standalone', 'difficult', 'argue', 'things', 'done', 'right', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'true', 'roots', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', 'self-conscious', 'classic', 'undoubtedly', 'inspired', 'likes', 'Scream', 'Gillespie', 'new', 'take', 'will', 'likely', 'recall', 'thankful', 'forgettable', 'alternative', 'vampire', 'scene', 'present', 'anything', 'time', 'anymore', 'something', 'new']",Fright Night

1374137,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003Y5H5FG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[12, 17]","Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a normal teenager living in Las Vegas, Nevada with his mother (Toni Collette). Their new neighbor, Jerry (Colin Farrell), is a mysterious man who works all night and sleeps during the day. As Charley leaves for school with his girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots, you're reading this name correctly), his mother comments about the dumpster sitting in front of Jerry's yard. Charley pays little attention to it. Once at school, Charley is approached by his former friend `Evil' Ed (Christopher Mintze-Plasse) who believes that Charley's new neighbor is a vampire. People have been turning up missing in the area and a woman was recently attacked by a man who tried to bite her. Ed is convinced, but Charley is unable to accept that the charismatic man next door could possibly be a vampire and dismisses Ed's ramblings. When Charley eventually becomes suspicious himself, his research yields that Ed's claims were correct. Intending to keep his mother and girlfriend safe, Charley enlists the help of a magician and self-proclaimed vampire expert Peter Vincent (David Tennant) to help him destroy Jerry before Jerry destroys everything around him.This summary may sound vaguely familiar, because Fright Night is the latest example of the Hollywood remake machine remaking every film they can. Based on a 1985 film that already spawned a 1988 sequel and is considered one of the better horror films of that decade, this film takes a different approach in remaking a film that some consider a classic and is more of a reimagining than a remake. Fright Night respects the source material enough to not just create a carbon copy of it, retaining the tone/concept of Tom Holland's original rather than the specifics of the plot. The chronology of the story has been altered, with events from the original taken out and new ones put in and the film has done away with certain elements of the original story. Meanwhile, some returning characters have retained their basic function in the plot but have been completely reimagined. Obviously, this has a much more modern feel but that doesn't mean it's the studios attempt to appeal to Twilight fans. The original is very much a product of the 1980s, while this latest version is very much a product of the 2010s. In updating it this way, it simply continues staying true to the original film. It's rare to see a Hollywood remake stick so close to the source material while straying so far from it and it's even rarer when the old story is replaced with a new one of equal strength. The idea of rewriting Fright Night as opposed to copying the original by-the-numbers, works for and against this new version. The 1985 film has its cult following and fans will be angered that the remake (exists and) has strayed from their beloved original. Meanwhile, open-minded people who come to this film without bias will appreciate the feeling that they're seeing a new film. As a remake, Fright Night is a worthy one. Taken on its own terms, it's very good film too. This is the surprise of the summer.The 2011 Fright Night is better than the 1985 Fright Night that inspired it. While it lacks some of what made the original special and does away with elements that made some audiences interpret it as something deeper than a typical-horror/comedy, it improves upon the imperfections of the original substantially and has few imperfections of its own. The character `Evil' Ed, as played by Stephen Geoffreys in 1985, met with polarized reactions. On one hand, the character was a fan favorite and considered one of the best aspects of the film, but, on the other hand, he's considered by many (including this viewer) to be one of the most annoying characters to ever grace the screen. It wasn't the character, but the performance that elicited such strongly opposed reactions. It succeeds only in that it's memorable, but few performances have made me so frustratingly annoyed. Roger Ebert called Pauly Shore the ""cinematic equivalent of long fingernails, drawn very slowly and quite loudly over a gigantic blackboard."" This describes how I feel about Geoffreys. While Mintze-Plasse doesn't create a performance as memorable and his `Evil' Ed character (only referred to by the moniker once) is substantially altered, he's immediately less annoying and has much less screen-time. Mintze-Plasse is forever cursed to be remembered as McLovin', but he uses that to his advantage by allowing the audience to make their associations and then going somewhere different with the character. This is the darkest he has gone with a performance and it works. In the 1985 version, Amy was much more of an object of desire for both Charley and Jerry, but was played by Amanda Bearse, the actress best known as Marcy D'Arcy from Married...With Children. While Amy is more personally involved in the plot this time, her character is not lusted over to the extent she was in 1985. I like Bearse, but she was not convincing as the object of a teenager's desire let alone a much older vampire. The new Amy is much more attractive and convincing than Bearse was. The only thing this new version is missing that the old version really benefitted from was Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent. McDowall was the highlight of the original film and made Vincent such a sympathetic character. I do miss McDowall, although David Tennant plays a completely remodeled version of the character and does a splendid job, but more on that later...The script by Marti Noxon (with a story credit going to Tom Holland, who is also credited with the `based on' portion leading me to think he may have had some involvement with this new story) is very well-written, with a strong respect and debt to the original film. The comedy/horror tone is preserved, but the time-specificity is updated well without becoming too overbearing with current pop-culture references. Some characters, such as Jerry's assistant, are done away with but characters like Amy and Charley's mom are much more developed and involved this time around. I applaud Noxon for rewriting Peter Vincent successfully, as I had very little hopes when I heard what was done with the character. Additionally, Noxon stays true to the characters, which was very important in the original film. People, myself included, felt emotionally invested in their plight and that remains true here.Fright Night is paced very well and draws you in, but descends into a CGI-heavy action film towards the end of the second act. It's obligatory for a film like this and it doesn't sacrifice the story or characters for the sake of mindless special effects, but the story is most successful when it deals with character interactions. The early scenes, especially the new ones, are marvelously handled. The scene where Charley first enters Jerry's home is suspenseful and exciting, with a surprisingly shocking climax. It's a great-looking film, which I can't emphasize enough. The film was shot in 3D, but the entire thing looks wonderful with some incredible exterior shots (which I suspect are CGI). Director Craig Gillespie currently has a track record of one well-received and one horribly-received film, but he proves here to be quite the director. Finally, the score by Ramin Djawadi is an effective film score that complements the action onscreen very well.The acting, for both a horror film and remake, is very impressive. Yelchin is a convincing Charley and it's easy to really relate to the character and the situation he's found himself in. David Tennant plays Peter Vincent for the first several minutes as a Criss Angel/Russell Brand hybrid, but eventually transitions the character into someone the audience can root for. He establishes a completely different persona from McDowall yet stays true to the heart of the character and gives a very entertaining performance. The real star however is Farrell as the smokingly charismatic, diabolical Jerry. Clearly having a lot of fun here, devouring the scenery with a performance that is unbelievably charismatic and effectively creepy, Farrell brings flamboyancy to the role, treating it seriously without being afraid to have fun with it. Think of Heath Ledger as the Joker basically, although don't expect Farrell to collect any awards. It's absolutely fascinating to watch him and it restores faith in an actor that hasn't had such a prominent role in the limelight for the last few years.Also featuring a terrific ""Hey-I-know-that-dude"" cameo from an original player in the 1985 version, Fright Night is a tense, intense, and very entertaining film that goes far and beyond expectations; a fine example of a remake and a sturdy film on its own. It's never dull, it delights in over-the-top blood and gore, and it never takes itself too seriously. While it's not quite a ""horror"" film and it's contrivances keep it from being perfect (much like the original), I can't imagine seeing a more enjoyable horror film this year.GRADE: A-*Due to theatre manipulation, I was forced to see the film in 3D. If you like 3D to be gimmicky, there were moments that were quite impressive.

1374138,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B003Y5H5FG,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 5]","That is a play on the tagline of The Original Movie. The Fright Night remake which is better acted than the original better effects & in all instances is better than the original. IF YOU ARE HIGH! I know that's mean & rude but that's how I feel. I'm going to tear this movie a new a  s  s hole. This was just another pointless remake just like The Halloween remake just like The Nightmare On Elm Street remake & so many others. As I have always said we all have our likes & dislikes when I hate on a movie it's not against the fans of that movie it's against the movie. This is a rant so don't leave mean & rude comments or I will reply in kind if I mispell things in this rant well it's a RANT. I don't hate every remake. I like The Thing from 1982. The Blob from 1988, The Fly from 1986. Even remakes made the past few years like Dawn Of The Dead, The Hills Have Eyes & The Friday The 13th remake. Before I rant on this pos let me tell  you 2 ideas that would've made this unique. Todd Farmer had a script that would've had Tom Atkins & Jamie Lee Curtis star in incresingly bad remakes of Fright Night they work The Horror Convintions & Jamie Lee would've been written as a money hungry coward. Jerry Dandridge's assistant Billy would've fought Derek Mears at a Horror Convintion. The structure would've been the same as the original but would've had different situations that were diffent & more violent. Charley would tell Tom Atkins what he saw Tom Atkins would've been amused & just played along cause he had nothing better to do. Another script would've taken place where Fright Night is just a popular movie the main character believe's a Vampire lives next door he wouldn't seek out the help of anyone named Peter Vincent. He would seek out the help of Chris Sarandon who played Jerry Dandridge in the original Fright Night who would know better if there is a Vampire next door. If you wonder why this got rejected everyone in the board room loved the ideas I think they were brillant. Head Executive Of Screen Gems Clint Culpepper the same studio who gave us The Prom Night remake which is a CW version & an insault to the original & The Stepfather remake said ""Duh I don't get it."" Yeah but you thought that The Prom Night remake was an awesome idea you dips  h  i  t. It's The Clint Culpepper's of the world why movie quality is down from the 80's & 90's they should be cleaning out the toilet's at the studio not making the decison's Dreamworks had a hand in this movie at 1 time they wanted to make it family friendly which explains the low body count & cartooney gore. Anyway let's get to this Teeny Bopper version of Fright Night. Made on a budget of $30 million made $18 million in The US. internationally it made $23 million so worlwide it made $41 million but it was a bomb cause do you know how much extra money goes into the marketing & advertising & the gross share of money among theaters. Directed by Craig Gillespie he directed Mr Woodcock & Lars & The Real Girl on top of directing episodes of Untited States Of Tara. He had about as much credibility directing a horror film as George Tillman did directing a action movie. It stars Anton Yelchin as Charley Brewster, Colin Farell as Jerry Dandruff I mean Dandridge I say that cause he has the hair cut that's straight out of Twlight. David Tennant as Peter Vincent, Toni Collette as Jane Brewster she was on that show UST so that's how she got the job. Imgoen Poots as Amy peterson & Christopher Mintz Plasse as ""Evil Ed"". Story is Jerry Dandridge kills this family. Then you have a joke orf an opening where Fright Night pops up it just looked so cheap. So you have The CW version of Fright Night that takes place in The Suburbs Of Las Vegas so they can relate to The CW crowd. Your introduced to Charley Brewster & his Mom Jane & Charley's Girlfriend Amy that looks straight out of The CW & their relationship isn't believeable. Charley's Mom looks straight out of The CW. I mean when I was growing up not very many of the kids I knew had hot Mom's they looked like real Mom's even in the older horror movies most of the Mom's looked like real Mom's they weren't hottie's. Charley is just so unlikeable he turned his back on his friend Evil Ed to be popular & hang out with the cool kids & be a tool. The kid at the beginning that is killed was friends with Evil Ed Charley used to hang out with them. Your introduced to Jerry Dandridge who looks like an older version of the lead dork in The Twlight movies he has the pale skin & the hair cut. You haved Evil Ed tell Charley that his neighbor is a Vampire. I was like wtf it didn't make sense. They take a stab at Twlight which I'm thinking this movie has a villain that looks straight out of Twlight. You also have homage after homage like Jerry eating an apple like in the origina. Evil Ed talks smack about Charley's girlfriend & calls him out on why he's became jerk. Charley shoves Evil Ed & tells him ""You know when my life started getting better is when I stopped being friends with you.""So I'm suppose to root & care about this a  s  s hole. Wouldn't have been bettter if Evil Ed was the lead since he seems to know about Jerry being a Vampire & Charley is unlikeable there is no likeable characters& I will say until the day I die ""When I don't care about the characters I don't care about the movie."" There's a scene where Jerry asks Charley for some beers & Colin Farrell in this scene just kept talking & talking & I was like dude STFU. Charley seeks out the help of Peter Vincent who is a Magican & an expert in the occult & that makes him an expert in Vampires & his parents were killed by Jerry Dandridge & he doesn't help Charley. You have them do another homage to the original where Charley is looking out the window & not paying attention to Amy & he falls asleep & wakes up when he hears screams from next door. Jerry leavs the house so Charley breaks into his house he picks a lock to get in he looks up how to pick a lock on his i phone the director needs to google how to direct. Charley finds these secret rooms he finds this lady from next door. Jerry returns wow that was a quick trip. Jerry bites her . Charley tries to rescue this chick when they get outside the girl dies due to the sunlight. Which that was the quickest turn from human to vampire & she died in a horrific CGI effect. Later on you have Jerry go to their house Charley won't let him in so Jerry digs us a gas line & sets the house on fire they get out of there. Jerry throws a motorcycle into the back of the van. The effect of the motorcycle going into the back of the van is really shoddy CGI. Everytime taht Jerry rams the van with his truck & the glass breaks in the van in a cartoon CGI effect. Jane runs Jerry over & he hides under the van. You know what this reminded me of the episode of The Simpsons where Side Show Bob hid under the car. He starts punching holes under the van they stop the van. Then you have scene that made me mad as fire you have Jerry in his Vampire form which is done in some horrible CGI he kills a motorist played by Chris Sarandon the original Jerry Dandridge. To say were the new Fright Night I seriously wanted to find Craig Gillespie & yell the right act at him cause this movie is an insault to the original.  & The CGI for Jerry's Vampire form is awful. You mean to tell me that practical effects can't be done anymore cause they can I've seen direct to DVD movies on $5 & $10 million budgets do it. Practical effects like the make up effects blood squibs can all still be done. They just don't do it cause there lazy. Jane takes a Century 21st sign & stabs Jerry in the back was that suppose to be funny or suppose to be a moment to make you yell yeah get him. Either way it fell flat. Was Century 21st sponsering this movie btw.  Jane faints I don't know how or why she did. They have Charley act sorry for the way he treated all his old friends which I didn't buy just like I didn't buy Charley & Amy's relationship in this movie.  Perter Vincent calls Charley they go to his place. Then you have Evil Ed come in to try & kill Peter Vincent now the original Peter Vincent was afraid of The Vampires nut his reactions felt real & he had great moments like when he fights Evil Ed in the original or when he kills Evil Ed in the original or when he fires that gun at Billy or helps Charley fight Jerry Dandridge in the original. Even in Fright Night II Peter Vincent has more to do than Peter Vincent in the remake plus you had Roddy McDowall who was great. Charley & Amy kill Evil Ed. Jerry chases after them all the way to a Night Club like in the original Jerry puts Amy under a trance & bites her like in the original. I'd rather watch the original. Cause when they constanly referance & homage a previous movie I'd rather watch the original. Charley goes off buys stuff to kill Vampires when he suits up it's not cool like Alice in NOES 4 it's laughable it's like The Ghostbusters version of a Vampire Killer. I'm going to skip ahead basically Peter Vincent fires a shot gun at Jerry Dandridge & he can't shoot to save his life. Charley puts on a fire suit sets himself on fire & when he puts on the mask Anton Yelchin looks so goofy I just paused & laughed at it. I mean this dude is on fire for over a minute I don't think a fire suit can last that long you'd probably be a crispy critter. Anyway Charley catches Jerry on fire he burns up in a atrocious CGI effect then Charley puts the stake into his chest & he dies in some of the worst CGI i have ever seen. Charley & Amy get it on at Peter Vincent's place & I'm glad this movie was over. The cast was terrible imo. There was nobody to root for. They got picked cause they had pretty faces not on acting ability. I'm tired of this CW look in horror movies. Jerry Dandridge looks like a Twlight dork. The CGI is atrocious. The score is forgettable by Ramin Dsueadi it has nothing on the great scores from Fright Night 1 & II. I'm glad this movie tanked I doubt there's going to be a Fright Night 2 Electric Boogaloo. Craig Gillespie you should be ashamed. Anton Yelchin  I don't blame him for doing bad in this movie I blame the writing. Colin Farrell was horible & he went on to ruin another classic Total Recall which was another reamke that he's done & it tanked. Toni Collette was bad. Imogen Poots replace the T with a P & that sums up what I thought of her perfomance. Dabid Tennant wasn't any good & The Peter Vincent character was pointless in this movie. Christopher Mintz Plasse was ok. Just watch the original & part II this movie just blows.",2,If you like carbon copies then you'll love The Fright Night remake 3.5/10,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,10576,"['play', 'tagline',

The link is in my profile. I'll just give you a quick rundown.I'm a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan of the original film. I even sorta like the sequel to it. Its one of the best Vampire movies to have ever been released. That being said, it is pure horror/comedy. Its not 100% serious at times, so if you don't like your vampire/horror films like that you might not enjoy the original. . .The only thing going for this remake is Colin Farrel as a sexy vampire and unfortunately they didn't play up to that enough, so even he couldn't save the movie from being pretty crappy.The entire beginning was rushed.

In addition, a cross floats to 35%, a rock flies out to 40% and on 3 separate occasions burning embers reach a maximum of 40, 45 & 50%.IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:As you would expect with a vampire movie, there are many dark scenes. Dim lighting is not a friend to 3D so on occasion, you may find yourself straining to see the action. The depth is slightly inconsistent from scene to scene but it is said to be a variation that this film maker intended.If you like vampire/gore movies, this makes a good addition to your 3D collection.ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:On my system, in addition to some slight ghosting, 9 scenes had easily noticeable crosstalk and in 2 of them, double images were very distracting. However I still found this film very enjoyable.(crosstalk varies from system to system)3   starMY 3D RATING = GOOD to VERY GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different.

Anton Yelchin (Star Trek)was reformed dweeb Charlie Brewster, playing the distracted would-be hero perfectly to type. Mintz-Plasse (McLovin) is good as Evil Ed, In this case Charlie's ex-sidekick now that Brewster is dating out of his league. Their classmates are disappearing, Ed is already wary of vampire goings-on and tries unsuccessfully to bring Charlie in on it.In the New Orleans papers they only got 2 stars, they (like some Amazon reviewers) clearly didn't get it... It was superbly done, perfect balance of tones, while being just enough of a tribute to the original ( in fact there's an obvious cameo ad well)  but totally it's own film.

This one is better. While the original used more comedy, this one is darker, more horror and appropriate. It's well acted by the entire cast including the teens which you expect to find mediocre acting - not in this. They rise graciously to the challenge.

It could have stood on it's own. Many, many liberties were taken with the plot and subplots, sequences and character specific actions that really changed the story... but not enough to stand on it's own. There were too many similarities and yet too many differences to give it a true spot in hollywood vampire history.If you liked the original I daresay you'll be very disappointed in this version. They didn't stay true to the plot. They really didn't even do an update or polishing of the original. They also didn't introduce new characters and the characters they have did not fully match the characters in the original.In the original, the 'discovery' phase of the story was slow with doubts by Charlie. It wasn't his friend who made the discovery, in fact, his friend laughed at him. This version cuts to the issue in the first ten minutes... and I'm sure that has to do with running length of the movie.The Peter Vincent character was nowhere near the original whatsoever. Huge disappointment. They totally left out his questioning of faith that was in the original.In the original, the vampire had an assistant. This version had none. Not a huge loss, but definitely lost some scenes without him.The whole vampire legend/lore was lost. They highlighted some points like wooden stakes and holy water and how to kill one, but they left out the hypnotic quality of their personality and the changing into a bat. Another disappointment.So why one star? Colin Farrel was very good in his role and so was Toni Collette. The cameo by Chris Sarandon was nice and humorous.In my opinion, they should have picked up where the original left off. Nobody has done that yet. At the end of the original you hear his friend's laughter coming from the house next door... which obviously meant he was still alive (?). Part two gave you a whole new group of vampires and didn't really connect to the original. I think a part 3 with the friend who's still alive would work.I think the original had a great story, well played out, well acted and left it open for a sequel, which nobody picked up on.

He seems like a great guy at first, but there's something not quite right -- and everyone, including Charley's mom, doesn't notice.

1374152,A3TMS14RL9Q0R1,B003Y5H5FG,"K. Sommerfield ""Slasher Studios""","[7, 15]","Going into the remake of ""Fright Night"", I was a bit apprehensive. The original is my favorite vampire film of all time and I just felt that deep down they were going to find some way to mess up the remake. Then the trailers came in (everything looked solid, if a bit underwhelming), then the reviews came in (75% in just about perfect for a horror film), and then the reaction from fans came in--They didn't mess it up! I couldn't wait to watch the remake. I sat down in my seat eager for the movie to start as I put on my 3D glasses and was ready for the wild vampire ride to begin.The film starts quite promising. We are given a skyline shot of houses in the suburb. The kind of suburb where everyone owns the same car, the same house, and the same two kids. And then BAM, three killings before the opening credits can even hit the screen. I was ready! This is going to be the remake to end all remakes! Sadly, it was not to be. The plot is generally the same as the original with a few small changes. Teenager Charley Brewster guesses that his new neighbor Jerry Dandrige is a vampire responsible for a string of recent deaths. When no one he knows believes him, he enlists Peter Vincent, a self proclaimed vampire killer and Las Vegas magician, to help him take down Jerry.What doesn't work about this movie? Well, aside from a few stylish touches...pretty much everything. Gone is the old, charming horror host Peter Vincent and in is a Midori chugging whorish magician. Ugh. Gone is the beautiful shot and exciting club scene in which Jerry seduces Charley's girlfriend Amy (it's here, but the less said about the ""new"" version of this scene the better). Gone is Jerry's homo-erotic relationship with his best ""friend""/roommate. Hell, that character isn't even IN this film. What's added?

1374154,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B003Y5H5FG,LadyLestat,"[21, 28]","While I don't share the same enthusiasm as others when it comes to this film that doesn't mean that I didn't like it at all. I appreciate the fact that they tried something new, but I couldn't help but feel like I could have been watching any other vampire movie besides Fright Night. I am an 80's baby, so I grew up a big fan of this movie, and if it were left up to me personally I don't think they should have even bothered with a remake. Remakes only show how unoriginal and uncreative Hollywood has become. With that said, let's discuss what I didn't find interesting, and that's the angle they took with this Peter Vincent. While I appreciate that they tried to make him a modern day version of Roddy McDowell let's keep it real. This guy was more like a rock star than a vampire hunter, real or fake, in my own opinion. You barely see this guy besides on television, and when Charlie finally looks the guy up he does absolutely nothing besides run and hide until the end of this movie. The other Peter Vincent had a more active role in finding out about who Jerry Dandrige really was and helping Charlie defeat him even though he was afraid in the original film. I also have a slight problem with the ""Evil Ed"" they had this time around. Come on, how in the hell can they arrange it to where he finds out about Jerry before Charlie because he's been following Jerry around town with night vision goggles and camcorders. Is that the best they could come up with? That part was not believable to me that ""Evil"" would just know to follow Jerry because he is a vampire and then warn Charlie about it only to be bitten in practically the beginning of the movie. There was really no build up to that point, Ed just knew about Jerry, and it just is what it is I guess. Frankly, and it's just my opinion, but I don't think that part was thought out too well. On top of that, I guess they totally decided to axe Jerry's daytime companion and watchdog that was Jonathan Stark in the original movie. I really hate to be the person that only dewells on the original because I dislike it when other people tend to harp on that fact. Plus, it only makes it harder to accept the new characters and storylines, but by this being one of my favorites it was very important to me that it was done right, and in my opinion it fell short in certain areas. In the original film Charlie's curiosity and spying is what got him in hot water with Jerry.Now, let's discuss what I did find interesting, and that is I liked the brief Chris Sarandon cameo. I liked the fact that Charlie's mom played a bigger role in this film because you barely remember that she is a part of the story in the first film because her screen time and dialogue was very short. I also think that Colin Farrell made a worthy vampire because he was all about the killing. It's not secret that the man is extremely easy on the eyes, so the sexiness oozes from his pores without him even trying to be sexy, but I do think they tried to make him more terrifying than seductive which is rare for vampires these days. I sort of like the Amy better than Amanda Bearse this time around, but I couldn't help but think she didn't have a real role in this movie besides playing the hot piece of tail in this movie. The original Amy was more involved in the meat of the story than this chick.Overall, the movie did seem a bit rushed, but it was fun to watch. I think that if you don't the mistake of doing what I did, and that was constantly trying to see some type of resemblance to the first film then you will like it.",3,It was o.k!,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,3565,"['do', ""n't"", 'share', 'same', 'enthusiasm', 'others', 'when', 'film', ""n't"", 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'tried', 'something', 'new', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'other', 'vampire', 'movie', 'Fright', 'Night', 'am', '80', 'baby', 'grew', 'up', 'big', 'fan', 'movie', 'were', 'left', 'up', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'have', 'even', 'bothered', 'remake', 'Remakes', 'only', 'show', 'how', 'unoriginal', 'uncreative', 'Hollywood', 'become', 'said', 'let', 'discuss', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'interesting', 'angle', 'took', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'appreciate', 'tried', 'make', 'modern', 'day', 'version', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'let', 'keep', 'real', 'guy', 'was', 'more', 'rock', 'star', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'real', 'fake', 'own', 'opinion', 'barely', 'see', 'guy', 'television', 'when', 'Charlie', 'finally', 'guy', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'besides', 'run', 'hide', 'end', 'movie', 'other', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'had', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'Jerry', 'Dandrige', 'really', 'was', 'helping', 'Charlie', 'defeat', 'even', 'was', 'afraid', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'slight', 'problem', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'had', 'time', 'around', 'Come', 'how', 'hell', 'can', 'arrange', 'where', 'out', 'Jerry', 'Charlie', 'been', 'following', 'Jerry', 'town', 'night', 'vision', 'goggles', 'camcorders', 'best', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'Evil', 'would', 'just', 'know', 'follow', 'Jerry', 'vampire', 'then', 'warn', 'Charlie', 'only', 'be', 'bitten', 'practically', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'build', 'up', 'point', 'Ed', 'just', 'knew', 'Jerry', 'just', 'what', 'guess', 'Frankly', 'just', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'part', 'was', 'thought', 'out', 'too', 'well', 'top', 'guess', 'totally', 'decided', 'axe', 'Jerry', 'daytime', 'companion', 'watchdog', 'was', 'Jonathan', 'Stark', 'original', 'movie', 'really', 'hate', 'be', 'person', 'only', 'original', 'dislike', 'when', 'other', 'people', 'tend', 'harp', 'fact', 'only', 'harder', 'accept', 'new', 'characters', 'storylines', 'being', 'one', 'favorites', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'was', 'done', 'right', 'opinion', 'fell', 'short', 'certain', 'areas', 'original', 'film', 'Charlie', 'curiosity', 'spying', 'what', 'got', 'hot', 'water', 'Jerry.Now', 'let', 'discuss', 'what', 'did', 'find', 'interesting', 'liked', 'brief', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'cameo', 'liked', 'fact', 'Charlie', 'mom', 'played', 'bigger', 'role', 'film', 'barely', 'remember', 'part', 'story', 'first', 'film', 'screen', 'time', 'dialogue', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'also', 'think', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'made', 'worthy', 'vampire', 'was', 'killing', 'not', 'secret', 'man', 'extremely', 'easy', 'eyes', 'sexiness', 'pores', 'even', 'trying', 'be', 'sexy', 'do', 'think', 'tried', 'make', 'more', 'terrifying', 'seductive', 'rare', 'vampires', 'days', 'sort', 'Amy', 'better', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'time', 'around', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'role', 'movie', 'playing', 'hot', 'piece', 'tail', 'movie', 'original', 'Amy', 'was', 'more', 'involved', 'meat', 'story', 'chick.Overall', 'movie', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'rushed', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'constantly', 'trying', 'see', 'type', 'resemblance', 'first', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'like']",Fright Night
1374155,A2T049UQONS0OY,B003Y5H5FG,Larry VanDeSande,"[0, 0]","Fright Night (2011) is a remake of the1985 classicstarring Roddy McDowall, Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse. It's the story of a young man with a vampire living next door who recruits a fictitious vampire slayer to rid himself and his friends of the problem.As remakes go, this one if pretty fair, maintaining interest throughout the film for the most part. A-list actor Colin Farrell somehow agreed to play the lead (the vampire) in this B movie and does well with his part. Taking liberal cues from Christian Bale's performance inAmerican Psycho, Farrell tries to be horrific, campy and psychological in his role with lots of shifting eye stunts and half-actions. He's fairly believable (as believable as one can be playing a vampire) and generally carries his part well. While probably not as effective as Sarandon from the 1985 version, Farrell nonetheless carries the film.The rest of the cast -- Anton Yelcher as Charlie Brewster, the neighbor; Toni Collette as his mom, Jane; and David Tennant who recreates McDowall's role as the vampire slayer -- are not nearly as good. Yelcher emotes a lot of the time, Collette seems disaffected as mom, and Tennant is way over the top playing a Las Vegas entertainer/vmapire expert. None of the three are particularly gripping in comparison to the 1985 film. Charlie lacks the naivete Ragsdale brought to the part and no actor will ever portray the Vincent character with the self-doubt, charm and camp the late McDowall brought. Also, Chris Sarandon, so effective as the 1985 vampire, plays a small, inconsequential role.With what is typical for horror films in the new century -- too much gore, somewhat disbelievable computer-generated graphics, and action substituting for performance -- there's little question the 2011 version is inferior to the 1985 film. Still, there aren't many vampire movies released these days, even in our copycat epoch, so any new vampire movie is worth seeing for fans of the horror genre. While this movie won't sway the general moviegoer to rent or own it, any horror acolyte should give it a look.",3,A fair remake with a good lead,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,2096,"['Fright', 'Night', '2011', 'remake', 'the1985', 'classicstarring', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'William', 'Ragsdale', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'vampire', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'fictitious', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'rid', 'friends', 'problem.As', 'remakes', 'go', 'one', 'pretty', 'fair', 'maintaining', 'interest', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'A-list', 'actor', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'somehow', 'agreed', 'play', 'lead', 'vampire', 'B', 'movie', 'well', 'part', 'Taking', 'liberal', 'cues', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'performance', 'inAmerican', 'Psycho', 'Farrell', 'be', 'horrific', 'campy', 'psychological', 'role', 'lots', 'shifting', 'eye', 'stunts', 'half-actions', 'fairly', 'believable', 'as', 'believable', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'playing', 'vampire', 'generally', 'part', 'well', 'probably', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'Sarandon', '1985', 'version', 'Farrell', 'nonetheless', 'film.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'Anton', 'Yelcher', 'Charlie', 'Brewster', 'neighbor', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'mom', 'Jane', 'David', 'Tennant', 'who', 'McDowall', 'role', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'lot', 'time', 'Collette', 'disaffected', 'mom', 'Tennant', 'way', 'top', 'playing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'entertainer/vmapire', 'expert', 'None', 'three', 'are', 'particularly', 'gripping', 'comparison', '1985', 'film', 'Charlie', 'naivete', 'Ragsdale', 'brought', 'part', 'actor', 'will', 'ever', 'portray', 'Vincent', 'character', 'self-doubt', 'charm', 'camp', 'late', 'McDowall', 'brought', 'Also', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'so', 'effective', '1985', 'vampire', 'small', 'inconsequential', 'role.With', 'what', 'typical', 'horror', 'films', 'new', 'century', 'too', 'much', 'gore', 'somewhat', 'disbelievable', 'computer-generated', 'graphics', 'action', 'substituting', 'performance', 'little', 'question', '2011', 'version', 'inferior', '1985', 'film', 'Still', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'vampire', 'movies', 'released', 'days', 'even', 'copycat', 'epoch', 'so', 'new', 'vampire', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fans', 'horror', 'genre', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sway', 'general', 'moviegoer', 'rent', 'own', 'horror', 'acolyte', 'should', 'give', 'look']",Fright Night

The remake isn't particularly scary or atmospheric and not all of the performances work. Fright Night is a dark vampire tale about a guy (Charley) who discovers his neighbor is a vampire. Colin Farrell's performance was good but we note many women like Chris Sarandon as well. The absolute worst character was Peter Vincent. David Tennant is miscast here and nowhere near as good as Roddy McDowall's performance. Peter Vincent, the vampire hunter, is reduced to a Vegas sideshow wearing a lot of fake makeup. Charley isn't nearly as charming here and his girlfriend is an absolute bag. Evil Ed wasn't the dedicated method actor from the original either. The movie isn't terrible but it grossed only half of its budget in the US which is always the kiss of death. The movie struggled to find its audience because it isn't scary enough for a horror movie nor does it have the charm of the original. The soundtrack and comedy don't quite blend the way they did in the 1985 version. I must admit horror-comedy is extremely hard to do but the original was rewarded with a Saturn Award for Best Horror.

Too much cgi without any real makeup looks pretty bad often and yet this is what we get.  I love david tennant though , in spite of this bad revamping of the original he is still great in it.

1374174,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B003Y5H5FG,Nathan T.,"[1, 4]","I'm going to skip directly to my list of likes and dislikes about the movie. Overall it was a fun watch. It wasn't a great movie in any sense of the word since the whole vampire subject has been done and redone over and over thousands of times. This movie did not add anything new, you basically just watch it for the action and the laughs, which were alright.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!Likes:- I love how the mom didn't fit into the typical stereotypical skeptical mom role that many movies portray the parents and other adults as. I'll explain. You know how movies have parents and adults being in denial and skeptical when their kids bring up subjects that make the kids seem like they're going crazy? And the parents or adults don't believe them and in the end get killed for it? Like the scene during the movie when the main character explains to his mom about the vampire next door. Now if she opened the door and they got killed for it, you would probably have thrown your hand up in the air and yell out ""aw man, you should've listened to him!"" Thankfully in this movie, even though the mom was skeptical, she does end up trusting her son more and did not open the door. I loved her character overall, she had an enjoyable personality.- I was glad to see that the main character's girlfriend remained a good person throughout the movie. What gave me skepticism was when the main character and his ex best friend were investigating the disappearance of one of their other friends. His 'past' best friend said how they use to bad mouth her and call her a sl*t behind her back. So my impression was that the main character gave up his identity to hang out with people that are stereotypically portrayed in similar movies as cool, popular people that have a bad, unfaithful, basically not so cool personality deep inside in relation to their opposite counterparts in which there are nerdy or not so cool people that are actually the ones with a more solid personality and morals overall. So throughout the movie, I was predicting that she would cheat on the main guy with the vampire and eventually get killed because of that, I was preparing myself to hate her. However, it never happened and I actually find myself attracted to her in the sense that she was generally a cool girl with a good head on her shoulders. I kept thinking ""wow she's a keeper"". And yes I know how my sentence sounds like but I'm just trying to be straightforward with my thoughts so bare with me.- I do like the humor and the other characters overall. There were no specifically obnoxious characters or scenes in the movie. Everything possibly negative was toned down or taken out. The movie contained a decent amount of action to make you stay alert. There were no horrendously unbearable obvious flaws.DISLIKES:1. I was not too fond of how, about 15 minutes into the movie the ex best friend yells out ""your neighbor is a vampire"". It sort of came out of nowhere, usually movies like these have a period in the movie where they investigate and then it'll be something like ""ahhh haa! Just as I thought, he IS a vampire!"" The main character eventually investigates his ex best friend's house, but it doesn't seem to explain why the guy originally thought the neighbor was a vampire. Like he video taped it but why did he start doing so? It just sort of came out of nowhere. I just felt like it took a bit out of the story. I would have preferred that but am open minded enough to take in what the movie had to offer, just a personal preference.2. Nothing new added to the whole subject on vampires. The movie was extremely predictable if you think about it. Guys find vampire, vampire tries to kill them, they kill vampire. No good twist or anything. They did remain relatively faithful in terms of vampire weaknesses that you normally see in most vampire movies.OVERALL:Fun movie, just nothing new and definitely nothing to ADD to the dying movie industry that seems to lack more and more in creativity and originality. The movie industry that seems to rely too much on remakes or remakes of remakes or ideas that's already been done to death. I gave this movie 4 stars because it entertained me, but overall, it's not a superb movie in any sense of the word. It was watchable, but definitely not memorable. You get a few laughs, you go home, then it's pretty much forgotten.

Colin Farrell is a disappointment in therole that Chris Sarandon played to perfection as the original ""vampirenext door"" type with a lot more sexual heat than Colin exhibits in anunderplayed style. And even back in 1985, the special effects were alot more horrifying than those employed here which represent CGI at itsworst.But most of all, the entire script has made drastic changes in thestory that ""for better or worse"" are strictly for the worse. Fans ofthe original film will hardly recognize what has been done to thestory, much less the characters.However, Toni Collette as Brewster's mother and Imogen Poots as hispretty girl friend are excellent, given what material they have to workwith, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse gets some comic relief from the EvilEd character that he becomes after ""the bite."" In this case, his EvilEd is much less effective than the one in the original film.So many of the key scenes are played in virtual darkness, making itimpossible to see what is actually going on at important moments in theaction sequences.

Things begin to go from bad to worse as Charlie's mother (Toni Collete) and gorgeous girlfriend (Imogen Poots) get caught in the crossfire, leading him to seek out the assistance of horror illusionist Peter Vincent (David Tennant) as things reach a bloody climax.

I have to say, this was a weird, disappointing movie. I actually wanted to turn it off after Jerry chases them and tries to kill the mom, Charlie, and his GF. You can tell they were trying to make the characters have depth, but all you see is this facade of ""care about this character"" without any real reason to. I never even really got why Charlie would get involved, because he didn't care about his friends that got killed.. maybe only because Jerry talked to his mom? The overly CGI vampire teeth and morphing was very distracting as well. (I rather hate it when movies make vampires totally morph). And David Tennant's moments and humor were far too brief.Overall, if you generally like vampire movies, maybe check this out to see for yourself, but I for one did not enjoy it.

1374183,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B003Y5H5FG,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[1, 5]","What the world needs now is hardly another Vampire Movie.For the duration of this millenium our cultural channels have stuffed with fanged bloodsuckers. Precocious, teenaged vampires direct from central casting, Beverly Hills 90210. Leather-clad, Matrixey cyber-vampires. Cute, oscar-winning child-stars growing up and fighting vampires in the deep south. Dystopian, fractured society vampires from Sweden. Vampire spoofs. It's all been done, literally to death. In recent times none, I would argue, summon up a tenth of the gothic splendour of Dracula or Nosferatu. Yet still they come.Just when you thought the genre really had been sucked dry, there comes Fright Night. Fresh blood? Well, it's a remake. You're getting a bit ""meta"" if that could count as a novel angle. And, anyway, it can't: Dracula has been remade so many times even he's lost count: talk about undead.Colin Farrell and his cohorts, if they are striving for something new and not just trying to catch the last sparks of a departing comet, have their work cut out. Fright Night is a comedy horror: a genre neither fish nor fowl that was popularised in the eighties by films like - well, Fright Night.What they present is: fine. If this were performance appraisal, I'd say ""meets expectations. Good corporate citizen, safe pair of hands, nice approachable chap, collegiate, talented, works hard. Escalates appropriately.""It's well acted, edited and scripted. Farrell enjoys himself; Dr. Who`s David Tennant has a ball as a louche and pathetic vampire hunter. It's moderately funny (largely when those two are on screen), but not uproarious. But it isn't tense, is never frightening, and has the sex appeal of a dentist's waiting room.And that, in a 2011 vampire movie, isn't enough.As we walked home, we saw a Bugatti Veyron was parked outside a local hotel. Seeing that was a kick. Seeing Fright Night wasn't. Now you don't need to be a Veyron to turn heads, but if, in late 2011, you want to make a splash as a vampire movie, you can't be a Mondeo. Fright Night is a Mondeo. Excellently designed, brilliantly supply chained, well constructed, reliable, and okay. No-one's dream car, though, and certainly no-one's idea of a nightmare.Much of the film feels like it is going through the motions. The genre has a well determined sequence: Charley, our hero (Anton Yelchin) stumbles on a villain's grim secret. No one will believe him. He warns his friends but they are seduced by the bad guy. They vilify and reject him. Villain flourishes. Seemingly too late, his message gets home. Cue final reel: wall-to-wall zombie killing. This exposition is rushed. Charley's mother (Toni Collette), a single mom, has a golden opportunity to flirt with hunky vamp (Farrell) who's moved next door. But she doesn't.Other opportunities for cleverness are skipped: in early exchanges Charley's improbably foxy girlfriend (the pretty but, er, bloodless Imogen Poot) picks up a copy of Wuthering heights from his bedside table and flips through it wantonly. They discuss it briefly (him: it's boring. Her: oh, no: it's quite sexy). Cue an extended riff about Wuthering Heights, right? Farrell as Heathcliff (you could even get in some knowing digs about Colin Firth)? Wrong. Wuthering Heights is tossed aside and gets no further mention.As we wandered home wondering out loud about what commercial (let alone artistic) imperative led them to make this film, why they didn't make more of Wuthering Heights, it struck me that what they could have done is just done Wuthering Heights, set in Vegas hinterland (the way Emma was done LA style in Clueless). That would have been cool: it is a cool story, and one which hasn't been filmed recently, as far as I can recall.Oh well: opportunity missed.Olly Buxton",3,Meets expectations. Safe pair of hands.

So please forgive me when I wasn't that thrilled to see a remake of yet another 80's classic this time starring McLovin. The problem though was that this remake was actually a blast from beginning to end. Both Colin Farrell and McLovin were great! I couldn't believe I made it through the movie let alone enjoyed it. So get ready for some entertaining cinema.So to begin, the architecture remains the same from the original Fright Night. But has been updated with some newer special effects, story and more relevant comedy. Some characters were also tweaked a bit for a more 2010ish vibe. None of these changes are bad or annoying and some actually improve certain parts. It had a great blend of the right amounts of comedy and horror and didn't really go overboard with either. Not going to bother going into the plot as I'm hoping by now most of you have seen the original. So this isn't your usual remake that has been coming down the pike.

1374191,A2UQF0BCL4I75O,B003Y5H5FG,POD JAWS,"[1, 2]","In other words it sucked fangs big time at the box office in the U.S. pulling in only $18 million out of its $30 million budget. But it wasn't the only failure with money at the remakes/prequels box office in the year of 2011... Movies such as Conan: The Barbarian and The Thing, both truly entertaining and superb films didn't even cover the budget and Final Destination 5 pulled in almost the right amount. Fright Night was such a well thought out movie. It was a modern and extremely well done remake than not even David Tennant nor could Collin Farrell save from the Box Office!Plot: Jerry Danridge has moved next door to a peaceful family, Jane (Mother) and Charlie (Son) Brewster. They are very acceptant of him but when Charlie learns some information from his ex best friend Evil Ed Thompson that Jerry is in fact a vampire, He mocks him..... That is until Ed doesn't show up to school the next day... that makes him a little suspicious..... Hearing Jerry talk about how he'd better mind his own business.... He gets a bit worried then what sets it all off when he hears/sees his next door neighbor Doris meet a gruesome death! He soon seeks help from T.V. celebrity star Peter (Douchebag) Vincent... who immediately calls Charlie crazy and tells him to leave.... The big question lies within the original trailer (which mostly does cover the plot) ""What would you do if you accidently discovered that the house next door was being occupied by something not human, no one believes you, not your mom, not your girlfriend, not even the police, it knows that you know, you'll do anything to protect yourself. but it'd do anything to protect it's secret!""Review: What a perfect remake... It is able to create something new while still maintaining the old in a ""Modern"" fashion. It has everything, Actors who act like today's society and not something just written down on a piece of paper they acted like they wanted to and did it perfect. It's got gore and blood, salty language, the only thing there wasn't in this remake was the sex scene which I felt was a breathe of fresh air mainly because most horror movies have at least one or two sex scenes in which this one would rather work on a real and secure level while still being different from the rest. This is how vampires should be not like Evil Ed described as fruity or love sick but they should be like the shark from ""Jaws"" or even the ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex from ""Jurassic Park"". Hell, it could even be as bad ass as Freddy Kruger with all the one liners Jerry Preformed such as ""don't need an invitation if there is no house!"" But I believe the greatest advantage this film had over the original was the blood and gore!Acting: Pure fun! And full of passion about each line that came out was perfect there were no bad actors in this film! Not even the security guard or the body guards were bad.... this is one of those films where there were no bad actors... well maybe some drunk/fowl mouth actors (such as Peter Vincent) but even he was great at acting!Gore: As I said before the gore was a great advantage over the original! We get grisly bites, a nasty severed arm, lots of blood splatter, throat slashing, some gory dead bodies and more! Beat that Ed to the Ward!Bottom Line: An indestructible, superb remake that will always have a place in my collection/heart! It deserves all the money it can get. it was just epic and genius! It definitely needs a sequel!Rated R for bloody horror violence, and language including some sexual referencesIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 7For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5",5,M-O-D-E-R-N = Monstrous Overachiever Doomed Economically Rightful Numbers,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,3599,"['other', 'words', 'sucked', 'fangs', 'big', 'time', 'box', 'office', 'U.S.', 'pulling', 'only', '18', 'million', '30', 'million', 'budget', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'failure', 'money', 'remakes/prequels', 'box', 'office', 'year', '2011', 'Movies', 'such', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Thing', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'superb', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'cover', 'budget', 'Final', 'Destination', '5', 'pulled', 'almost', 'right', 'amount', 'Fright', 'Night', 'was', 'such', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'modern', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'remake', 'not', 'even', 'David', 'Tennant', 'could', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'save', 'Box', 'Office', 'Plot', 'Jerry', 'Danridge', 'moved', 'next', 'door', 'peaceful', 'family', 'Jane', 'Mother', 'Charlie', 'Son', 'Brewster', 'are', 'very', 'acceptant', 'when', 'Charlie', 'information', 'ex', 'best', 'friend', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'Thompson', 'Jerry', 'fact', 'vampire', '..', 'Ed', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'school', 'next', 'day', 'little', 'suspicious', '..', 'Hearing', 'Jerry', 'talk', 'how', ""'d"", 'better', 'mind', 'own', 'business', 'bit', 'worried', 'then', 'what', 'off', 'when', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Doris', 'gruesome', 'death', 'soon', 'help', 'T.V', 'celebrity', 'star', 'Peter', 'Douchebag', 'Vincent', 'who', 'immediately', 'Charlie', 'crazy', 'leave', 'big', 'question', 'original', 'trailer', 'mostly', 'cover', 'plot', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'accidently', 'discovered', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'was', 'being', 'occupied', 'something', 'not', 'human', 'one', 'not', 'mom', 'not', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'even', 'police', 'know', ""'ll"", 'do', 'anything', 'protect', ""'d"", 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'secret', 'Review', 'What', 'perfect', 'remake', 'able', 'create', 'something', 'new', 'still', 'maintaining', 'old', 'Modern', 'fashion', 'everything', 'Actors', 'who', 'act', 'today', 'society', 'not', 'something', 'just', 'written', 'down', 'piece', 'paper', 'acted', 'wanted', 'did', 'perfect', 'got', 'gore', 'blood', 'salty', 'language', 'only', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'remake', 'was', 'sex', 'scene', 'felt', 'was', 'breathe', 'fresh', 'air', 'mainly', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'sex', 'scenes', 'one', 'would', 'rather', 'work', 'real', 'secure', 'level', 'still', 'being', 'different', 'rest', 'how', 'vampires', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'Evil', 'Ed', 'described', 'fruity', 'love', 'sick', 'should', 'be', 'shark', 'Jaws', 'even', 'ferocious', 'Tyrannosaurus', 'Rex', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Hell', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'bad', 'ass', 'Freddy', 'Kruger', 'one', 'liners', 'Jerry', 'Preformed', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'invitation', 'house', 'believe', 'greatest', 'advantage', 'film', 'had', 'original', 'was', 'blood', 'gore', 'Acting', 'Pure', 'fun', 'full', 'passion', 'line', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'perfect', 'were', 'bad', 'actors', 'film', 'Not', 'even', 'security', 'guard', 'body', 'guards', 'were', 'bad', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'were', 'bad', 'actors', 'well', 'maybe', 'drunk/fowl', 'mouth', 'actors', 'such', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'even', 'was', 'great', 'acting', 'Gore', 'said', 'gore', 'was', 'great', 'advantage', 'original', 'get', 'grisly', 'bites', 'nasty', 'severed', 'arm', 'lots', 'blood', 'splatter', 'throat', 'slashing', 'gory', 'dead', 'bodies', 'more', 'Beat', 'Ed', 'Ward', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'indestructible', 'superb', 'remake', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'place', 'collection/heart', 'money', 'can', 'get', 'was', 'just', 'epic', 'genius', 'definitely', 'sequel', 'Rated', 'R', 'bloody', 'horror', 'violence', 'language', 'including', 'sexual', 'referencesIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '7For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '5']",Fright Night

There are so many things I disliked about this movie I don't really know where to begin.The movie just jumps in with little story, or character development.  The diologue is lame with ridiculous, unnecessary, sexual references every other line.  The neighborhood setting is boring, with cookie cutter houses.  The plot has holes big enough to drive a fleet of trucks through.  Young kids are missing and the cops only show up briefly in one scene.  Come on!  Evil Ed, Peter Vincent, and even Charlie Brewster are horribly written characters.  Jerry Dandridge never met a neck he didn't like.  I mean, he could have just brutally killed some of his enemies, not sucked every single one.  Stupid!  I only liked two things about this movie: Colin Farrell, and the cameo with Chris Sarandon.  Farrell plays the villan well, even with his lousy diologue, and really projects menace and evil.  It was also good to see Chris Sarandon again, even if his scene was mediocre.Both the original Fright Night, and the sequel Fright Night 2, are much better movies.

That being said, I wasn't expecting anything out of the Fright Night remake, except for a cameo by Chris Sarandon. I was however pleasantly surprised, as the young cast was better than expected. For those who don't know the story, it is a classic vampire tale. Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a normal teenager, whose life revolves around High School and his beautiful girlfriend. Everything is perfect until an old friend tells him that his new neighbor is a vampire. At first Charley doesn't believe him, but the more he watches, the more he realizes that something isn't right. Anton Yelchin opposes Colin Farrell, and while he might not have the name recognition, he easily outshines the veteran actor. Yelchin has a cult following among fans of teen movies, after strong performance in films like Charlie Bartlett and Middle of Nowhere. As with most teen idols, his popularity is not just about his looks, it comes from his smooth relaxed style of acting, that people can relate to. Yelchin's characters are always real and honest, the kind of guy audiences can easily relate to, and that's what makes him as good as he is. Yelchin has help in this film from an all-star cast that includes, Farrell, Toni Collete, Christopher Mintz-Plasse-Mclovin, Dave Franco, and of course the original vampire, Chris Sarandon.

And his name is Jerry (Colin Farrell, obviously enjoying the role).A remake of the cult film made in 1985 directed by Tom Holland (who went on to make ""Child's Play""), the 2011 version of ""Fright Night"" refuses to be taken seriously. Not that this is a comedy (though occasionally humorous, not too overtly so), but if you are looking for a very scary movie, this is not the one for you. Despite the merciless nature of the vampire, the film's tongue-in-cheek approach in mixing laughs with scares tends to make the film itself less scary than some might expect.Imogen Poots plays Charley's girlfriend and Toni Collette Charley's mother. Their roles are rather thankless ones, compared to Charley's hapless friend Ed, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and a scenery-chewing Las Vegas magician and vampire expert Peter Vincent (David Tennant).Set in and around Las Vegas, the isolated suburban location is effectively captured by cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (known for ""The Others"" and yes, the ""Twilight"" series).

I personally have never seen the original, so I can't say. However, I enjoyed this rendition & felt it lived up to its expectations as a modern day chiller. It was suspenseful, hilarious at times, & tastefully done. I think all of the actors did a pretty good job in their portrayals. David Tennant (Dr. Who) was a pleasure to watch. And Colin Farrell was as well, for obvious reasons. I thought he was a fantastic vampire. Menacing, self-involved, & pure evil such as they are in historical works of fiction. Real vampires don't sparkle...I think that the main problem fans of the original have is that there wasn't quite enough gore. Get over it. I don't think it's written anywhere that a movie requires carnage & gore to be thrilling. Bottom-line, if you're a fan of vampire flicks like I am, give this one a try & don't be so stuffy about it if you've seen the original.

1374236,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B003Y5H5FG,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","...to make it worthwhile.The original ""Fright Night"" from 1985 was a fun horror film with a half-serious, half-campy vibe. Its strengths were a great story, an excellent (and hideous) vampire, Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent and an entertaining air. There was a quasi-remake in 2008 called ""Never Cry Werewolf"", which (obviously) traded the vampire for a werewolf; it was a quality remake with the variation of a female protagonist (Nina Dobrev) and Kevin Sorbo in the McDowall role.This 2011 official remake features Colin Farrell as the vampire. It has the same plot, but there's enough variation in the details to make it a quality remake. Instead of the Los Angeles area (or an Eastern city in ""Never Cry Werewolf""), this one takes place in a small desert community outside Las Vegas (and was shot in Vegas and New Mexico). I can't say that Farrell is a better vampire than Chris Sarandon (or the werewolf in ""Never Cry Werewolf"", Peter Stebbings), but he's just as good in his own unique way, although the F/X aren't as good when the vampire morphs into its most hideous self.Anton Yelchin shines as the teen who is astonished to discover that a vampire is living next door. Seriously, Yelchin is a surprisingly excellent protagonist. Toni Collette as his mother and Imogen Poots as his girlfriend offer strong support. These three take the material seriously and are contrasted by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who takes a campy approach, and Colin, who opts for lower camp like Sarandon in the original.The weak point of the original was Amanda Bearse (""Marcie"" from Married With Children). Don't get me wrong, she was her typical fun, likable self, but she didn't cut it as a hot female protagonist (then again, maybe the filmmakers weren't shooting for that). Poots, Collette and Sandra Vergara as Ginger -- Peter Vincent's babe -- deliver the goods here. However, David Tennant isn't anywhere near as strong in the McDowell (or Sorbo) role. Why? Because Peter Vincent in the remake is just a sad alcoholic who's hiding out as a Vegas entertainer, trying to drown out his grief. Tennant's fine in this role, but the character, as-written, isn't as strong.In any case, 2011's ""Fright Night"" is an entertaining horror flick. It's not actually scary due to the semi-goofiness, but it's very amusing and thrilling.The film runs 106 minutes.GRADE: B+",4,Different enough from the original...,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,2350,"['make', 'worthwhile.The', 'original', 'Fright', 'Night', '1985', 'was', 'fun', 'horror', 'film', 'half-serious', 'half-campy', 'vibe', 'strengths', 'were', 'great', 'story', 'excellent', 'hideous', 'vampire', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'entertaining', 'air', 'was', 'quasi-remake', '2008', 'called', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'obviously', 'traded', 'vampire', 'werewolf', 'was', 'quality', 'remake', 'variation', 'female', 'protagonist', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'McDowall', 'role.This', '2011', 'official', 'remake', 'features', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'vampire', 'same', 'plot', 'enough', 'variation', 'details', 'make', 'quality', 'remake', 'Instead', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'Eastern', 'city', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'one', 'place', 'small', 'desert', 'community', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'was', 'shot', 'Vegas', 'New', 'Mexico', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Farrell', 'better', 'vampire', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'werewolf', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'Peter', 'Stebbings', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'F/X', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'when', 'vampire', 'morphs', 'most', 'hideous', 'self.Anton', 'Yelchin', 'shines', 'teen', 'who', 'astonished', 'discover', 'vampire', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'Seriously', 'Yelchin', 'surprisingly', 'excellent', 'protagonist', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'mother', 'Imogen', 'Poots', 'girlfriend', 'offer', 'strong', 'support', 'three', 'take', 'material', 'seriously', 'are', 'contrasted', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'who', 'campy', 'approach', 'Colin', 'who', 'opts', 'lower', 'camp', 'Sarandon', 'original.The', 'weak', 'point', 'original', 'was', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'Marcie', 'Married', 'Children', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'typical', 'fun', 'likable', 'self', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'hot', 'female', 'protagonist', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'filmmakers', 'were', ""n't"", 'shooting', 'Poots', 'Collette', 'Sandra', 'Vergara', 'Ginger', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'babe', 'deliver', 'goods', 'here', 'However', 'David', 'Tennant', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'near', 'strong', 'McDowell', 'Sorbo', 'role', 'Why', 'Peter', 'Vincent', 'remake', 'just', 'sad', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'hiding', 'out', 'Vegas', 'entertainer', 'trying', 'drown', 'out', 'grief', 'Tennant', 'fine', 'role', 'character', 'as-written', ""n't"", 'strong.In', 'case', '2011', 'Fright', 'Night', 'entertaining', 'horror', 'flick', 'not', 'actually', 'scary', 'due', 'semi-goofiness', 'very', 'amusing', 'thrilling.The', 'film', '106', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B+']",Fright Night
