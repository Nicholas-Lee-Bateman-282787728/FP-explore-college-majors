Unfortunately, if you're looking for an explanation as to why Jeffrey Dahmer murdered and how then this movie won't answer any of those. This movie was solely based on his younger days and his struggles with being homosexual and his dysfunctional relationship with his dad.It didn't answer any of my questions: How many victims were there? How did he choose his victims? How was he able to get away with drugging and raping so many men in one club? How was he able to lure so many young men to his home? Why did he feel the need to rape men who were willing to engage in consensual intercourse? Why did he let one of his victims escape? Why did he feed on his victims?Out of curiosity, I Googled him and his crime scene photos came up, just a warning, these images will scar you for life !!!!",2,Not enough answers...,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,864,"['watching', 'movie', 'was', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'Unfortunately', ""'re"", 'looking', 'explanation', 'why', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'murdered', 'how', 'then', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'answer', 'movie', 'was', 'solely', 'based', 'younger', 'days', 'struggles', 'being', 'homosexual', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'dad.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'How', 'many', 'victims', 'were', 'there', 'How', 'did', 'choose', 'victims', 'How', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'drugging', 'raping', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'one', 'club', 'How', 'was', 'able', 'lure', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'home', 'Why', 'did', 'feel', 'need', 'rape', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'willing', 'engage', 'consensual', 'intercourse', 'Why', 'did', 'let', 'one', 'victims', 'escape', 'Why', 'did', 'feed', 'victims', 'curiosity', 'Googled', 'crime', 'scene', 'photos', 'came', 'up', 'just', 'warning', 'images', 'will', 'scar', 'life']",N/A

This set features 3 Dvd's. Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy and Ed Gein.Dahmer Review- One man 17 Bodies , 957 Years , His story is finally told. This Dvd stars Jeremy Renner as Jeffrey Dahmer. He gives an excellent performance as a teenage Dahmer and Young man. Dahmer dares to explore the truth of a man many called an abomination of nature. These Dvds are inspired by life events. This dvd will take you into the twisted personal pain that led him to do some of the most extreme cases of human cruelty. This one was well acted but i was hoping for more information at the end. The begining was great, describing Jeffrey's early years but i was hoping they would show where they found the bodies at the end and maybe a bit of the trial. But other than that its good.Ted Bundy- Charismatic and Handsome but a monster inside. Starring Michael Reilly Burke who does a fantastic job as The young Republican Serial Killer Bundy. I almost believed it was the real Bundy. Bundy was virtually Undetectable and changed the mass murderer profile forever. Step inside the mind of the psychotic madman and ask yourself, if it were to happen again would you seem him coming?Ed Gein- ''Before there was the term serial killer, there was ''Ed''. This one was horrific. After seeing this video I always wondered why Eddie Gein was considered one of the most gruesome serial killers in history. After all he killed only 2, which wouldn't make him a serial killer since 3 is the lucky number. Just the overall weirdness and the extremes he went to is disturbing. He is a truly unique serial killer. He is the inspiration for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho and other horror movies. The things he did and the extent of his weirdness is unparalleled by most. The story looks back on Ed's Life and contains some real clips from when Ed was caught back in the 1950's. Ed is played by Steve Railsback who gives an excellent and haunting performance as Ed. The mother of Ed, Carrie Snodgress was great as well. Noone will ever forget the True Story Of Ed Gein.Recomended for True Crime lovers or anyone interested in learning more about their lives, Why they did what they did orwho they were I highly Recomend these DVD'S.

706591,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B0000694X6,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[2, 4]","Getting this out of the way early; Jeremy Renner puts on a stellar acting performance, perfectly falling into the role and merging into him to give him the right amount of discomfort and pathos, even in cases where he's not committing crimes but doing such mundane things as talking about fish or ordering a drink.The rest of the film, though, is a mess.  If they were attempting to merge different points in Dahmer's life, ""Memento"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" style, they made it too incomprehensible.  There's no real sense of past and present, and no real sense of while movies like Pulp Fiction and Memento pulled off their lack of linear storytelling spectacularly, this one has virtually nothing connecting each scene; they just happen in their own contained universes, and never overlap save for the presence of the Asian boy's corpse in one scene.As to the character of Jeffrey Dahmer himself, you need only look up brief examples of what he did, not just in terms of rape, torture, killing, and necrophilia, but the things he did in his life, the things he's said, and his personality traits depicted through these actions.  The Jeffrey Dahmer in the film bears little to no resemblence to the real Dahmer.  He's creepy and offputting, but he's meek to an incredible degree, and incredibly buffoonish when it comes to the actual thing that made Dahmer famous/infamous; he always fumbles his attempts to overpower or outsmart someone, and ends up screwing up and looking stupid, or else resorting to brute force in order to overpower someone and kill them.In fact, we never see any of his crimes beyond killing two people, and attempting to rape, but, as mentioned before, screwing up buffoonishly.  Scenes with his father and grandmother appear to have some meaning, but they never follow up on them in any meaningful way.  They're just there for some reason; as filler, or to show off such awkward moments as trying to convince his father not to open an old box that belonged to him to find his old ring, because he's hidden a dismembered head inside.There's another scene in which his grandmother calls him over to help get a crow out of her house, and he eventually catches the bird, and stares down at it with a crazed expression.  This scene leads into another, and has absolutely nothing to do with it.  It appears, it contributes nothing in the way of character or story development, and it's never explained or returned to again.If the director was going for a stylish, visual piece, they forgot to realize that the images are largely disconnected from the plot.  Or what little there is of the plot; I honestly don't think there is any plot beyond ""Jeffrey Dahmer doing things and behaving sympathetically""",1,Muddy and incoherent,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,2715,"['Getting', 'way', 'early', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'stellar', 'acting', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'falling', 'role', 'merging', 'give', 'right', 'amount', 'discomfort', 'pathos', 'even', 'cases', 'where', 'not', 'committing', 'crimes', 'doing', 'such', 'mundane', 'things', 'talking', 'fish', 'ordering', 'drink.The', 'rest', 'film', 'mess', 'were', 'attempting', 'merge', 'different', 'points', 'Dahmer', 'life', 'Memento', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'style', 'made', 'too', 'incomprehensible', 'real', 'sense', 'past', 'present', 'real', 'sense', 'movies', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Memento', 'pulled', 'off', 'lack', 'linear', 'storytelling', 'spectacularly', 'one', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'connecting', 'scene', 'just', 'happen', 'own', 'contained', 'universes', 'never', 'overlap', 'save', 'presence', 'Asian', 'boy', 'corpse', 'one', 'scene.As', 'character', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'need', 'only', 'look', 'up', 'brief', 'examples', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'terms', 'rape', 'torture', 'killing', 'necrophilia', 'things', 'did', 'life', 'things', 'said', 'personality', 'traits', 'depicted', 'actions', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'film', 'little', 'resemblence', 'real', 'Dahmer', 'creepy', 'offputting', 'meek', 'incredible', 'degree', 'incredibly', 'buffoonish', 'when', 'actual', 'thing', 'made', 'Dahmer', 'famous/infamous', 'always', 'attempts', 'overpower', 'outsmart', 'someone', 'up', 'screwing', 'up', 'looking', 'stupid', 'else', 'resorting', 'brute', 'force', 'order', 'overpower', 'someone', 'kill', 'them.In', 'fact', 'never', 'see', 'crimes', 'killing', 'two', 'people', 'attempting', 'rape', 'mentioned', 'screwing', 'up', 'buffoonishly', 'Scenes', 'father', 'grandmother', 'appear', 'have', 'meaning', 'never', 'follow', 'up', 'meaningful', 'way', ""'re"", 'just', 'there', 'reason', 'filler', 'show', 'off', 'such', 'awkward', 'moments', 'trying', 'convince', 'father', 'not', 'open', 'old', 'box', 'belonged', 'find', 'old', 'ring', 'dismembered', 'head', 'scene', 'grandmother', 'help', 'get', 'crow', 'house', 'eventually', 'bird', 'down', 'crazed', 'expression', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'nothing', 'way', 'character', 'story', 'development', 'never', 'explained', 'returned', 'again.If', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'stylish', 'visual', 'piece', 'forgot', 'realize', 'images', 'are', 'largely', 'disconnected', 'plot', 'what', 'little', 'plot', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'plot', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'doing', 'things', 'behaving', 'sympathetically']",N/A

Very boring because of repetitious killing scenes, all of whose endings were totally predictable. Dahmer was obnoxious and despicable in the manipulative way he operated. The violence and the sex WAS gratuitous and disgusting.The story had a beginning without a middle or an end. It just meanders from one killing to another. Dahmer's psycho babbling was pointless as he attempts to analyze one of his potential victims. I saw nothing about his childhood that may have contributed to his madness. The scenes with his father when he was a teen were not credible because the father was a one-dimensional bad dad who, we're supposed to believe, created this Frankenstein son by dominating him and invading his privacy. Nonsense. This is a superficial conclusion and surely an oversimplification of a highly complex problem. We never find out the many causes that effected such inner hatred and vengeance that it erupted into such canabilistic violence. So many guys have had overbearing dads--but how many turned out to be a Dahmer?This movie is just another sensationalistic attempt to exploit a killer who committed a series of ghastly, gruesome murders and offers neither understanding nor insight into his true motives. Dahmer is unclear and thus unsympathetic. Furthermore, the movie gave no information on how Dahmer was caught, tried, convicted, and imprisoned, and the circumstances leading to his murder in prison.I wasted my money buying this. I threw my copy in the trash can--I wouldn't even donate it to Good Will (because that would be bad will) or to the Public Library.The actor playing Dahmer was just FAIR, showing a limited range of understanding and expression of the depth of the character's internal dissension.

I don't like the subject and, frankly, the DVD's cover art screams ""don't rent this movie.""But I stumbled onto it on TV one night without realizing what it was (during the scene in which the crow gets loose in the house) and quickly became absorbed.No, the movie offers no answers about the real-life serial killer, it doesn't present a straight-forward biography and it's relatively light on gore.But what it does have is a thoughtful script and restrained-but-intense direction by David Jacobson, a challenging structure (it's basically a relay race of flashbacks and flashforwards) and great performances by Jeremey Renner, Bruce Davison, Matt Newton and especially Artel Kay&agrave;ru as a deceptively simple boy toy.I love a good horror movie but few contemporary films scare me.  I'd much rather be creeped out than grossed out. This one got under my skin in weird ways -- especially the scenes in which we know a murder is about to happen but... when???, or the sequence in which Dahmer's father demands again and again to know what's inside the locked box in his son's closet (and we *don't* want him to open it).Many reviewers here seem disappointed by what this movie is.  And perhaps Jacobson should've called the movie and his main character something else if he wasn't going to make a detailed portrait of an actual person.

I believe that the movie was to show some insight to Dahmer's motives and they were somewhat successful on that (of course we'll never be able to completely understand).

Dahmer is no exception; in fact, it is worse than the others.  I'm afraid I can't buy into any of the artsy-fartsy, pseudo-intellectual spin this film gets in some quarters.  Quite frankly, all I saw was a really bad movie.  I simply don't see how you can present any kind of story about Jeffrey Dahmer without at least alluding to the fact that the man freaking ate his victims.  All the psychological nonsense this movie throws your way with its endless flashbacks and fictionalized recreation of dialogue and events is patently useless because it ignores the most telling and significant of his psychological problems.  My problem is not the fact that this film is really just a character study of a troubled young man; rather, it's the fact that it's a very bad character study.I'm afraid I really have nothing good to say about this film.  I wasn't really impressed by Jeremy Renner's performance as Dahmer, I despised the constant flashback loops (which I consider the sole domain of weak directors) throughout the story, and I thought the ambiguous ending pretty much encapsulated everything that was wrong with the entire film.  This is a film almost wholly lacking in substance.Obviously, with the whole cannibalism thing totally off the table, this film barely registers on the blood and gore meter.  I don't have a problem with that, especially since I was already well aware of the exceedingly disturbing nature of Jeffrey Dahmer's murderous acts.  I do have a problem with the fact that this film really only hints at the scope and depravity of all the murders.  If you already know a good bit about Jeffrey Dahmer, you won't learn anything new in this film.  If you know nothing about Dahmer going in, you won't know much more about him at the end - but you may think you have some insight into his character.  That, in my opinion, is the crux of this film's many problems.",1,"Style over substance makes this ""character study"" a psychological exercise in futility",1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,2026,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'recent', 'films', 'based', 'lives', 'prolific', 'serial', 'killers', 'Bundy', 'B.T.K.', 'etc', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'Dahmer', 'exception', 'fact', 'worse', 'others', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'artsy-fartsy', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'spin', 'film', 'quarters', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'saw', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'can', 'present', 'kind', 'story', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'least', 'alluding', 'fact', 'man', 'freaking', 'ate', 'victims', 'psychological', 'nonsense', 'movie', 'way', 'endless', 'flashbacks', 'fictionalized', 'recreation', 'dialogue', 'events', 'patently', 'useless', 'most', 'telling', 'significant', 'psychological', 'problems', 'problem', 'not', 'fact', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'character', 'study', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'rather', 'fact', 'very', 'bad', 'character', 'study.I', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'say', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'impressed', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'performance', 'Dahmer', 'despised', 'constant', 'flashback', 'loops', 'consider', 'sole', 'domain', 'weak', 'directors', 'story', 'thought', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'pretty', 'much', 'encapsulated', 'everything', 'was', 'wrong', 'entire', 'film', 'film', 'almost', 'wholly', 'lacking', 'substance.Obviously', 'whole', 'cannibalism', 'thing', 'totally', 'table', 'film', 'barely', 'registers', 'blood', 'gore', 'meter', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'especially', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'aware', 'exceedingly', 'disturbing', 'nature', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'murderous', 'acts', 'do', 'have', 'problem', 'fact', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'hints', 'scope', 'depravity', 'murders', 'already', 'know', 'good', 'bit', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', 'anything', 'new', 'film', 'know', 'nothing', 'Dahmer', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'more', 'end', 'may', 'think', 'have', 'insight', 'character', 'opinion', 'crux', 'film', 'many', 'problems']",N/A

Unfortunately, that left me feeling disappointed. I know that movies based on real life still have a fictional element to it, but there was so much that could have been captured on film that didn't even make the screen!The movie tends to flash back and forth from the time Jeff was a teenager, to the last night he killed, and was then caught. The reason that I gave it some stars was because the flashbacks were very interesting, and gave insight into his home life and how controlling and suspicious his father was. I also liked the conversation Jeff had with the ""hitchhiker"" after they smoked out. He was trying to convince the guy why you should be open-minded and not just follow what everyone else does. (Get a job, marry some woman, resent each other, be bored the rest of your life.) He was being very manipulative and trying to convince the guy there would be no difference in sleeping with a man than with a woman if the lights were out.Sadly, the movie was not well focused. It mostly concentrated on the times Jeff went to gay clubs and drugged men to have sex with them. Also, it seemed that some of the information was wrong. The reason the public seemed so interested in this case was because of the cannabilism. There was only one part of the movie that included it, but it showed nothing, he just had a head in a box.The ending was also bad.So much could have been done with this movie!!

I had remembered little about him -- other than he murdered and ate humans. I had read a book about him, so when 'Dahmer' was released straight to video I absolutely had to see it. After watching it, I felt sick. The film was done tastefully, gore-wise, but as far as fact-based, it wasn't really there. The story skips around back and forth, if I hadn't read the book 'The Millwauke Murders,' I would've been lost. One of my stars goes to actor Jeremy Renner (National Lampoon's Senior Trip) who did a fabulous job with the characterization of Dahmer, but the script is what fails. I understand that you can't have a picture (especially fact-based) with all the gore, due to the tragedy the families went through, but you've got to come up with something better than this. The film mostly focused on Dahmer's homosexuality and him drugging and raping innocent men. Another star goes to the plot evolving around a loving father -- who supported his son even after all that happened. Two stars is all I'm giving this film -- and even at that, I'd still avoid the film and read a book on the psyche of a serial killer.

In fact, the film never even touches on much of the graphic and grisly deeds committed by Dahmer --- there's no vat of acid, there's no cannibalism, there's no body parts in the refrigerator.Instead, the film is more of just a grim character study - through numerous flashbacks we see a young teenaged Dahmer already troubled with a fascination with death.  His father, played by Bruce Davison, tries to help his son, but even at such a young age, Jeffrey has already gone over the edge.  Why else would he keep a severed head in his closet?Cutting back and forth from past events to the present, the film focuses on several key moments in Dahmer's life, but leaving out many others and rearranging the timelines.  We see a teenaged Dahmer killing and dismembering (mostly off-screen) the teenaged ""hitch-hiker"" (here, just a guy walking down the street) in one flashback (probably the grisliest part of the film) and see Dahmer drugging guys at a bar before graduating to his ""drilling technique"", but that's about it for horrific moments.  The present day stuff is mostly Dahmer seducing and trying to kill one black guy he picked up at a knife shop...but the seduction  goes on way too long and doesn't really end up anywhere (and it isn't even what actually happened).  The juxtopistion between present-day and flashbacks works OK for the most part, but after a while, the film just loses it's momentum because both timelines become too fractured.  And there is simply not enough horror in the story.  Not that the film needs gore and blood and sleaze....but the way it is, it could almost play like the story of any mentally-challenged guy off the street.  The filmmakers have made an admirable attempt at a mature, somber and respectable depiction of a grisly serial-killer's life...but this IS the story of a GRISLY serial killer so to avoid most of the GRISLY details make it all just seem very trite in the end.Jeremy Renner is very good as Dahmer, both in present day and uncannily looking much younger as a teenager in the flashbacks (with the help of large wire-rimmed glasses and slouched shoulders).  Obviously chosen for his resemblance to the real Dahmer, Renner still manages to convey a vulnerability, charm and underlying menace in the role.  But unfortunately, this Dahmer has barely killed anyone, his apartment is clean as can be (one clean corpse in the bed), and apparently he has no craving for human flesh since there is absolutely no hint at cannibalism.  And don't expect any wrap-up or conclusion to the tale --- it's not here.  What we are left with is simply a sanitized and piece-meal view of a troubled mind.  It's definitely worth a look for the acting alone and some grim depictions of this psychopath's life, but don't go in expecting anything more than that.  It's really neither an art film nor an exploitation film - so what audience is this for anyway???The upcoming DVD from ""First Look"" appears to be another one of their bare-bones (no pun intended) discs and it will only offer a Full-Frame version of the film.

Actually this exploration of the bizarre life of Jeffrey Dahmer is more an exploration of a mind descending into serial killing, mutilation, and cannibalization - a mind that just happened to be housed in a gay man- than it is a Hollywood Horror movie.  Jeremy Renner surveys this tough role with all the little nuances that bring us into the mechinations of the serial killer's psyche, never making him win our approval, but at the same time offering a canvas of life incidences that somehow make us approach understanding of why this could happen.  If we never study horrific deeds, we will never be able to treat or prevent them.  Renner makes Dahmer a rather straight forward, obsessed young man, a youth who craves physical affection yet can only find it by relying on drugging his love interests. Pathetic on all levels.  Much of what this film reveals is that the beginnings of Dahmer's illness were confined to the available sex clubs which are actually out there.  Then the seductions broaden and we are shown how he gradually overcame his conquests and descended into mayhem.  The victims we meet are likeable young men and the acting level is rather high in these difficult cameos. We are spared most of the sick and grizzly details of these murders and it is to the director's credit not to inundate us with that.  The filming and the music and the lighting is all macabre and in keeping with the subject matter.  In short, this is a 'psychobiography' of one of the last century's gruesome serial killers, but it is presented in a way that encourages thought rather than repulsion.

Swanson,"[3, 3]","While the creators obviously did their research regarding the series of events that was Dahmer's life, they failed miserably at depicting the man as one with true Antisocial Personality. There were obvious misunderstandings of the disorder throughout the entire movie. For example, in a scene in which Dahmer is ""trying"" to dismember a victim, he is shown being hesitant, disgusted, and almost vomiting. This is obviously not accurate, as Dahmer's profile fits one that is (and has been since childhood) fascinated with death, torture, and especially dissection. This scene is therefore showing Dahmer as someone without ASPD, in fact just by these reactions it is showing him as someone who is not wanting to kill or dissect. Shortly after disposing of the body, they show him sobbing and clutching the victim's jacket. What made them even think they should be incorporating an ounce of empathy into this character? (Granted, this scene was his ""first kill,"" but I still stand by my belief that someone with his history would have reacted more with fascination than any kind of disgust, and that there most certainly would not have been any kind of regret.)Overall, I think what they were trying to do here was to get inside the killer's mind to show you some reason as to WHY he did what he did. There were other instances that did show an interesting perspective, but the problem is there is absolutely no rhyme or reason for these people's motives. You cannot just humanize them into a character of a movie with the same emotions and feelings as everyone else, because it's not true. And yet I feel that is what they've tried to do here.With that being said, the alternative is somewhat unthinkable - a movie inside the mind of a serial killer as disturbed as Dahmer, without any display of empathy or emotion, might be unbearable for the audience, so I am not sure what the medium is.The overall pace of the movie was erratic, going from flashbacks to present moment, and I found myself often having trouble keeping up with which victim was which and which situation was which. In the end, they didn't even show what eventually led to his capture. The movie was never really concluded.

Rodney was completely fictional.  In one scene we see Jeffrey only has 2 pills left which would mean his standard method of drugging would not work with Rodney.

I remembered, as a teenager, how it was such a big deal when Dahmer was arrested.  So, I was looking forward to a gruesome account of how he had came to be.  He was charged on 17 counts of murder.  However, he was actually convicted on 15 of them, totally some 937 years in prison.Instead, like one reviewer put it, this was like ""pre-Dahmer"" and it certainly felt that way.  Plus, not everything in this film was accurate as there was a disclaimer saying so.  So, if you're not familiar on Dahmer and his crimes, then you won't know which is true and which isn't.*Dahmer* paints this serial killer as a lonesome gay chocolate factory worker in Milwaukee.  However, Dahmer likes his men to be totally submissive.  In order for them to be submissive, he'll have them drugged and then killed.The problem is that we don't really see how or where he murders them, except 2 of them.  We see, in flashbacks, how he seduced his (first?) victim.  Then, we see how he seduced Khamtay.  Khamtay was the only person who gave suspense in this entire film.  You see, Khamtay escaped from Dahmer's apartment and begged for help.  However, when the police arrived so did Dahmer, from work.  After some smooth talking, the police gave Khamtay back to Dahmer to his death.  Last, we see the drama between Dahmer and Rodney.  In real life, Rodney is supposed to be Tracy, who was the second and last victim to escape from Dahmer.However, we do not see that here.  Instead, we see that Rodney is interested in Dahmer.  Dahmer is interested but conflicted.  Every time that Dahmer wanted to kill Rodney, he stopped.So, we do not really see the real portrayal of Dahmer in this film.  Instead, we see flashbacks of his teen years and young adulthood where Dahmer struggled against the authority of his religious father.  I guess that is supposed to explain why Dahmer came to be as this serial killer.  We see his run-in's with the police but gets away with it every time.  We see how he drugged men at the local gay bar and in his apartment.  And that's just about it.Honestly, it was a waste of time.

Though it fudges some of the facts in order to present a more sympathetic view of famous killer, undermining its credibility as a biography, the film works very well on dramatic terms.  From its creepy / cheerful opening sequence (Patsy Cline crooning as chocolate Santas roll off the production line) to its haunting final image, ""Dahmer"" delivers the dramatic goods while avoiding, for the most part, outright gore.The film cleverly juxtaposes flashbacks to Dahmer's early life with the meeting of Dahmer and his (intended) last victim.  This allows the viewer to contemplate Dahmer's slide into madness, with special attention paid to the contrast between the confusion and pain of his teenage years with the seemingly emotionless monster he became.  The grim tone is leavened by flashes of black humor, but not to the detriment of the serious subject matter.Jeremy Renner, in the title role, was excellent.  Renner really caught the flat, affectless delivery of someone who knows he's a monster, and has gone to great lengths (mostly alcoholic) to block out his sense of morality.  He got that creepy look in the eyes, the combination of ""little boy lost"" and ""great white shark"" we can see in Dahmer's trial photos.  Renner was especially good as the teenage Dahmer.  Aside from looking startlingly young, he displayed a touching vulnerability and helplessness even as he commits and covers up his first murder.Bruce Davison as Jeffrey's father Lionel Dahmer was quite good, and came off as concerned, sympathetic, and completely ineffectual.  Artel Kayaru as ""Rodney"" (who takes the place of the real-life Tracy Edwards, who escaped Dahmer and alerted the police) gives an outstanding debut performance.  His vibrant persona provides a wonderful contrast to Dahmer's phlegmatic manner.I did feel that the movie was lacking in several areas.  Some of the transitions between past and present were confusing, but once I clicked with the film's rhythm it didn't bother me.  Rodney's motivations were obscure - why he would return to the apartment of a man who just tried to strangle him?  The denoument was abrupt, relying on a sudden cut to the standard ""Jeffrey Dahmer was charged with 16 counts of murder..."" title card.There was a lot glossed over that could have added insight to Dahmer's psyche.  For instance, his latchkey kid's fear of abandonment (the incident when he came home to find his mother and brother moved to Ohio could have been proved telling!).  Or his fear of castration, brought on by testicle surgery, or his fascination with dissecting animals.  Dahmer's army years, an attempt at ""normalcy"" ending with a discharge for alcoholism, may also have been worth at least a mention.There were also many, many atrocities that were never referred to.  Dahmer's apartment was notorious for its rank odor, but neither of the men Dahmer brings home mentions this.  The vats of acid, the heads in the freezer, the painted skulls and drawer full of Polaroids are never seen.  His cannibalism is never even alluded to.  In fact, the film seemed to be at pains to portray him as less of a ghoul and more of a misunderstood monster.Aside from the dishonesty of such an approach, as a longtime horror fan, I missed the grisly details.  With such a solid dramatic structure and good performances, I felt the filmmakers could have painted with a much redder brush and lost none of their integrity.  Unfortunately for us gore-hounds, however, the production team decided to err on the side of good taste.  No pun intended.  (Well, maybe just a little bit.)Last but not least, I was very disappointed tbat the DVD contains only the full-screen version of the film.

Director David Jacobson wanted to explore the mind of a serial killer without gore or blood, and he is to be commended. His attempt to humanize Dahmer is admirable, though the film lacks focus. As I know it, Dahmer was diabolical in his methods, a lot more than the film shows. He had vats of acid in his apartment to aid in his disposal of bodies. The film left off at a time when his killing spree was at its peak (hoping for a sequel?), and there was no indication of his capture and trial and eventual incarceration on charges of mental instability (Duh). NOTE: The smell in the apt buiding was so bad, they finally tore it down. As an Indie, it was fine in handling this atrocious subject with dignity and true quality. As history, you can only be left baffled and confused. One of his victims, Joe Bradehoff, was my friend.

It made its point from the perspective of how the crimes were lead into, and where they stemmed from, but it didn't give graphic detail of his real crimes against nature.

And this didn't just stem from people, he had a fascination for this from animals at an early age the evolved to people, mainly the ones he sought sexual gratification, but could only fulfill them in his sick demented way of handling life by killing them during the act of sexual pleasure, even torturing.

Overall, it's a very well done movie.'Dhamer' covers Jeffrey's life prior to his 'splurge', so to speak.  It's a development study.  The script makes use of Dahmer's close run-in's with police that were blown off, like getting caught trying to return a victim to his house, getting caught drugging drinks in a gay bar, and an incident in his youth with a garbage bag in the back of his mothers car that *wasn't* grass clippings.The movie makes strong use of flashbacks and scene-skips, but it works to an advantage on film.  Jeremy Renner plays both younger and older Dahmer, and the make-up/photography is excellent in making this work on-screen.  To some, the movie may seem paceless, but it's absorbing nonetheless.  It did seem to end too soon, too much left out; but for the time frame of Dahmer's life it did a good job.Some interesting notes of my own would be the writer's reference to the Christian cross as a torture device, like worshiping an electric chair or a guillotine.  To a serial killer, this would make sense.  It brings up interesting social issues for a young gay man, but I honestly don't credit Dahmer with having much debative intellect.  Serial killers are normally creatures of immediate sensation, not debative thought.  They live 'in the now' and often believe that other people are simply 'items' in their world and not beings with thought processes; like them.  Others are a study, not a reality.I strongly doubt Dahmer felt any revulsion the first time he cut, killed, dismembered, or ate any of his victims.  It would have been merely interesting to him.  In the real world, you can't use reason to reach unreasonable people.  They cannot hear it.All in all, I suggest renting before buying, and keep in mind its more of an artistic study than a horror movie.

706633,A3JAFLALR0S8CR,B0000694X6,Sean Patton,"[4, 4]","This is a macabre and spectacularly disturbing portrait of one of America's most reviled killers. While the film does skim over some of the more gory aspects of Dahmer's murders, it makes a very strong statement on his mental and social illnesses.Jeremy Renner (who I first saw in National Lampoon's Senior Trip, of all things) masterfully portrays Dahmer in both a linear &quot;present-day&quot; story line and a series of very well edited flashbacks. His nervousness and almost frantic urgency while in the company of the living is chilling when contrasted with his calm with the victims post-mortem. The supporting cast is also top-notch. Through their performances we see a domineering father, a blind-sided grandmother and truly fearful and confused cast of victims.The sets, lighting and cinematography also lend to the eerie tones in Dahmer. From the red lighting in Dahmer's bathroom as he crushes pills with a water glass, to the strobe effect in the seedy club he frequents, the audience is forced into an emotional response to each setting and the events that transpire in them.Overall, the film does a nice job of getting into the head of a nefarious maniac. Even if it is ambiguous with a lot of the details of Dahmer's killings, it will make you think twice about accepting a drink in a bar, and wonder what the handsome, seemingly harmless boy next door is really up to.",4,"A Disturbing, if Somewhat Glossy, Portrait",1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,1385,"['macabre', 'spectacularly', 'disturbing', 'portrait', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'reviled', 'killers', 'film', 'skim', 'more', 'gory', 'aspects', 'Dahmer', 'murders', 'very', 'strong', 'statement', 'mental', 'social', 'illnesses.Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'first', 'saw', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Senior', 'Trip', 'things', 'masterfully', 'Dahmer', 'linear', 'quot', 'present-day', 'quot', 'story', 'line', 'series', 'very', 'well', 'edited', 'flashbacks', 'nervousness', 'almost', 'frantic', 'urgency', 'company', 'living', 'chilling', 'when', 'contrasted', 'calm', 'victims', 'post-mortem', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'top-notch', 'performances', 'see', 'domineering', 'father', 'blind-sided', 'grandmother', 'truly', 'fearful', 'confused', 'cast', 'victims.The', 'sets', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'also', 'lend', 'eerie', 'tones', 'Dahmer', 'red', 'lighting', 'Dahmer', 'bathroom', 'pills', 'water', 'glass', 'strobe', 'effect', 'seedy', 'club', 'audience', 'forced', 'emotional', 'response', 'setting', 'events', 'transpire', 'them.Overall', 'film', 'nice', 'job', 'getting', 'head', 'nefarious', 'maniac', 'Even', 'ambiguous', 'lot', 'details', 'Dahmer', 'killings', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'accepting', 'drink', 'bar', 'wonder', 'what', 'handsome', 'seemingly', 'harmless', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'really', 'up']",N/A

""horror buff""","[1, 2]","As a owner of such films such as Ted Bundy, Ed Gein, Gacy and interviews of many natorious serial killers, I must say that Jeff Dahmer is definetly the most DISTURBED serial killer to date. This movie is not a true serial killer flick. It focuses on Jeffery's lifestyle and doesn't truly explain to us the reason this man turned into a ruthless killer. Jeremy Renner does a good job portraying Dahmer in this film. You look at Dahmer and would never suspect that while working in a chocolate factory by day, he was a murderer by night. Dahmer was a loner who would pray on young men, usually dark skinned. We see Dahmer pick up a young man while shopping. Dahmer offers to buy this young man a pair of shoes with an ulterior motive. Dahmer would lure these young men to his apartment by offering then $50 or $100 dollars to pose for pictures for him. Unaware of what lied ahead, these young men would agree and once in the privacy of Dahmer's apartment, he would usually give them a drink which was heavily drugged ultimately rendering his victims helpless. We see him perform a labotomy on one victim. We also see scenes with his father. Dahmer at that time was living with his grandmother and stole a manniquen from a local store which was found by his father and grandmother in his closet. Dahmer's explanation was that it was just fun to have stolen it but we know that the manequin was used by Dahmer so he could sleep with it and fondle it. We see him go to bars where he would drug young men by buying them drinks and slipping in his deadly cocktail drug and take these young men to a back room of the bar to have sex with them while they were knocked out. This is not a bloody, gory film. At one point, we do see Dahmer hack up the body of a  young man he has killed. Dahmer would have to get himself intoxicated in order to dismember the bodies. He then puts the body in garbage bags and was on  his way to a local dump to dispose of the body when he was pulled over by a policeman who saw him swerving in the road. Dahmer was able to talk his way out of it saying that he was just adjusting his rearview mirror. The policeman saw the garbage bags in the back of Dahmer's vehicle and inquired about them but smooth Dahmer explained that he couldn't sleep and was on his way to the local dump to dispose of trash. The policeman did not search the bags and let Dahmer go. Dahmer was finally caught when one would be victim escaped from Dahmer's apartment and went to local authorities. From that point on the police went to Dahmer's apartment and found a crime scene like no other. There were body parts, a huge drum with 3 torsos in it, and remains of other victims. The smell was awful...and Dahmer was arrested and convicted of killing 17 young men and was sentenced to 957 years in jail. Dahmer does not deny anything and admits to the killings and admits to even eating some of his victims, making him a cannibal. The town of Milwaukee could now breath a sigh of relief. As we all know, 2 years after being in jail for serving a ""life"" sentence, Dahmer was killed in a bathroom by another inmate. He was beat in the head and pronounced dead upon arrival at the local hospital.

Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes may have been just as shocking as Gacy's, but Dahmer was of a completely different personality, one that doesn't really equate to film. Unlike Gacy, Dahmer was really shy and introverted, avoiding interacting with people that he wasn't planning on killing. The movie version of Dahmer's was honestly as boring as a Horror film could get. Much of it shows Dahmer alone in his apartment, torturing his victims, and much of the time, there isn't even any dialog!

I had hang-ups with this guy as well, very afraid to see the film. I was glad most of the violence was implied. One scene I found interesting was where one of his victims tried to show him some compassion, and he tries to strangle him. A strange thought went thru my mind: if he'd have given anyone the chance, could he have been shown love, or was he too far gone? Every friend I ask this say it was too late, all he cared about was the control. I've seen alot of serial killer movies-I'm fascinated by Dahmer though because his upbringing wasn't exactly out of the ordinary-broken family/home, delved into alcoholism, but his dad tried to reach out to him, and he closed himself off.

706641,A96JD9312DHWC,B0000694X6,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[8, 9]","From 1978 until 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer lived a life that became the focal point of worldwide media interest Amongst the most well-documented portions of this were the acts of creating lobotomized sexual slaves, of keeping trophies of victims in various states of decomposition all around his home, and of having the mysterious ""blue barrel"" that was used for disposal in his home. Some of the lesser-known facts were that he worked in a Chocolate shop, that he had been arrested before because he had sexual contact with a minor, and that his family life was something that had been strained. When reading about him in the book his father's book wrote, (A Father's Story by Lionel Dahmer), you could see some of the ingredients that went from ""deviant sexual impulses"" and ""aberrant drug use""  and spiraled into something that nightmarishly consumed 7 people before the police finally intervened.This is the story of some of that and of his younger years combined, with extreme liberties taken.One of the things that made this movie different than a lot of other movie was the fact that it didn't focus on blood and gore as much as it did on the characterization of Dahmer. Jeffrey Renner does a great job doing that portrayal, keeping the awkward charm attributed to Dahmer and yet still giving Dahmer a methodical approach that seems cold and disjointed. The movie starts in the middle of Dahmer's killing spree and doesn't really offering conjecture as to why he does everything he does. It does offer the viewers little glimpses into Dahmer's life in a round-about way, however, putting together a portrait of what Dahmer was like. It begins with Dahmer manning the chocolate production line, and from follows Dahmer as he starts looking for people that suit his needs. The first he finds is one of his most well-known, the 14year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone, and goes into how he lured the boy into his home and how the police had intervened but had done nothing in the end. That seemed to be something typical with Dahmer and related something about him and his victims; he was white and was good at choosing words and his victims were minorities and were oftentimes ignored. Along the way the movie also backtracks in the film and shows us the first murder Dahmer participates in, a hitchhiker names Steven Hicks, and shows us how the words ""I didn't want him to leave"" came into play there. It also explores his homosexuality, the way he drugged people to make them compliant, and the way his brutality escalated.Remembering that this movie is a work of fiction, this movie could be interesting to a number of people depending on what you want to watch. Since it is about a serial killer the topic is well-known, and if the thought of a Dahmer movie appeals to you then it appeals to you. I personally thought it was well done, again taking liberties, but that is to be expected.",4,"""I didn't want them to leave""",1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,2884,"['1978', '1991', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'lived', 'life', 'became', 'focal', 'point', 'worldwide', 'media', 'interest', 'Amongst', 'most', 'well-documented', 'portions', 'were', 'acts', 'creating', 'lobotomized', 'sexual', 'slaves', 'keeping', 'trophies', 'victims', 'various', 'states', 'decomposition', 'home', 'having', 'mysterious', 'blue', 'barrel', 'was', 'used', 'disposal', 'home', 'lesser-known', 'facts', 'were', 'worked', 'Chocolate', 'shop', 'had', 'been', 'arrested', 'before', 'had', 'sexual', 'contact', 'minor', 'family', 'life', 'was', 'something', 'had', 'been', 'strained', 'When', 'reading', 'book', 'father', 'book', 'wrote', 'Father', 'Story', 'Lionel', 'Dahmer', 'could', 'see', 'ingredients', 'went', 'deviant', 'sexual', 'impulses', 'aberrant', 'drug', 'use', 'spiraled', 'something', 'nightmarishly', 'consumed', '7', 'people', 'police', 'finally', 'story', 'younger', 'years', 'combined', 'extreme', 'liberties', 'taken.One', 'things', 'made', 'movie', 'different', 'lot', 'other', 'movie', 'was', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'blood', 'gore', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'characterization', 'Dahmer', 'Jeffrey', 'Renner', 'great', 'job', 'doing', 'portrayal', 'keeping', 'awkward', 'charm', 'attributed', 'Dahmer', 'yet', 'still', 'giving', 'Dahmer', 'methodical', 'approach', 'cold', 'disjointed', 'movie', 'middle', 'Dahmer', 'killing', 'spree', ""n't"", 'really', 'offering', 'conjecture', 'why', 'everything', 'offer', 'viewers', 'little', 'glimpses', 'Dahmer', 'life', 'round-about', 'way', 'however', 'putting', 'together', 'portrait', 'what', 'Dahmer', 'was', 'Dahmer', 'manning', 'chocolate', 'production', 'line', 'Dahmer', 'looking', 'people', 'suit', 'needs', 'first', 'one', 'most', 'well-known', '14year-old', 'Konerak', 'Sinthasomphone', 'how', 'lured', 'boy', 'home', 'how', 'police', 'had', 'intervened', 'had', 'done', 'nothing', 'end', 'seemed', 'be', 'something', 'typical', 'Dahmer', 'related', 'something', 'victims', 'was', 'white', 'was', 'good', 'choosing', 'words', 'victims', 'were', 'minorities', 'were', 'oftentimes', 'ignored', 'way', 'movie', 'also', 'film', 'first', 'murder', 'Dahmer', 'hitchhiker', 'names', 'Steven', 'Hicks', 'how', 'words', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'came', 'play', 'there', 'also', 'homosexuality', 'way', 'drugged', 'people', 'make', 'compliant', 'way', 'brutality', 'escalated.Remembering', 'movie', 'work', 'fiction', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'number', 'people', 'depending', 'want', 'watch', 'serial', 'killer', 'topic', 'well-known', 'thought', 'Dahmer', 'movie', 'appeals', 'then', 'appeals', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'again', 'taking', 'liberties', 'be', 'expected']",N/A

Now before I go into a review of the DVD let me first warn all the viewers who are expecting a gorefest that you will be disappointed. THere are no references to cannibalism or any real vivid murders and very little blood. WHat this movie is really about is Jeffrey Dahmer the person. The film starts with Dahmer in Milwaukee picking up a young Asian. By this time Dahmer is already a serial killer. Then the film shifts back to the teenage Dahmer and his relationship with his father. Renner is convincing in both roles. The film brilliantly focuses on Dahmer's first murder which is the high point of the movie. Dahmer's first murder was as a teenager and his victim was a college wrestler who is hitchhiking his way to school. Dahmer jokes with his victim, feeds him, drinks with him, but then when the victim decides to leave Dahmer kills him because he can't bear to be alone. I think that basically is why Dahmer was a killer, he just didn't know how to fit in socially. One scene in particular really is heartbreaking. After his first murder he just breaks down sobbing. Renner's performance in this scene is simply incredible. He just breaks down and bawls like a child who has just lost his mom. As a viewer I felt crushed by this scene and it made me understand a little about what was behind this heinous murderer. The film ends with the teenage Dahmer simply walking off into the woods alone. His first murder complete, his future atrocities in front of him. But it is Jeremy Renner who makes this movie great, I can't think of another actor who could have done as good a job portraying Jeffrey Dahmer.
