877228,A3C54XWT93R2WY,B00076ONVO,"Been around this block, several times over","[0, 0]","Saw it on Netflix, and certainly would have bought it had it been available at a reasonable price: but NOT at the cost of $175 to $500 for a new copy of the dvd, and $66 to $150 for a used one.However, speaking of the film itself, it is an outstandingly acted and presented tale-- in fact, an outstanding ""cautionary"" tale regarding the assumption that all child kidnappings have to do with sexual perverts and their sick needs (with hated groups like gays falsely thrown under the suspicion bus for good measure).  We must learn to seek truth in the face of tragedy, and not just use tragedy as an outlet for the verification of our easiest-to-come-by prejudices and dreaded fears-- and this movie teaches that very effectively.What the movie never goes into (because of the point at which it ends) is how the supposedly highly experienced NYC lieutenant detective (played by Judd Hirsh), who claims to have learned so much from his many experiences with kidnappings, is ever going to explain to his superiors and the press  how his repeatedly rushing to judgment had kept him off the mark so many times for so long.  Experience, in other word, can blind a person as well as open one's eyes.Still, in the end, the detective (largely because of his identification with the grieving mother, as a fellow parent of a little boy) was able to forego all the face-saving impulses in order to go look for and find the child someplace where he had over and over again dismissed repeated indications, which says a lot about that character which could not as readily be said for many other real-life, pressured-for-results law enforcement officers, forensic specialists, and district attorneys caught in similar investigative mistakes made as a result of having given in to their biases and other self-serving concerns.The problem that sort of thing raises is not only that the innocent get blamed, but that the guilty go free to repeat their crimes upon other victims.  As a clinician-administrator in a state psychiatric hospital, I can tell you that we investigate fully all allegations made by patients regardless of how ""crazy"" the patient might be believed to be, using the notion that one never knows until he has looked into it if this could be the one time the patient expressed truth in his ravings.This movie makes that point with just enough creative subtlety to make the end come across as genuinely plausible-- hence the lesson for us all who have been honored with the task of bearing the public trust, but who might be inclined to jump to conclusions before looking more deeply (because or our own obsessive-compulsive need for certainty, or to appear to others very good at what we do).  I urge making this film available in a good quality dvd at a more reasonable price, for it is a true gem which the public (as inclined as it is so often to credit sensationalistic journalism as necessarily correct because they see it in print) should see and learn from.

All these and more positive adjectives would be appropriate, for this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And I've seen it enough times (including in a theater when it first came out) that I've lost track of how often. And each time I see it I'm on the edge of my seat in anticipation of what is going to happen next.Judd Hirsh gives a great portrayal of a congenial yet dogged detective who has been hired to search for a missing boy. Seemingly every lead (and there aren't very many of them) winds up in a dead end. Thankfully, he doesn't give up.Kate Nelligan, in what is perhaps her best performance, plays the part of the distraught but determined mother who says goodbye to her son Alex one morning as he leaves for school and seemingly vanishes in thin air. Although without any good reason to hope, she refuses to give up and clings to her belief that Alex is alive and that some day she will be reunited with him.If you have never watched this movie, do so.
