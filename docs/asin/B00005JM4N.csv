From the beginning the viewer is barraged with an onslaught of exaggerated political humor. However, the movie is funny and has its moments. There were so many things in this movie that were just so unrealistic. I know that it's a comedy, but some of the stuff here is just too much.Head of State is about an African-American man named Mays Gilliam who is alderman of the 9th ward in Washington, D.C. Not that part of D.C. that we all imagine-the idealistic, majestic buildings of Congress and the memorials-but the ghetto. Gilliam is basically a low-level politician. At the beginning of the movie we find him being a hero by saving a woman who is in a house that's going to be detonated. After that his fortune as politician fails and he's kicked out of his office and evicted, plus his fiance splits with him.Meanwhile, deep in the bureacratic offices of Congress, there are some big political changes in the Democratic Party after their candidate dies in a crash. The head of the party looks for a scapegoat to run for president so that he could lose. Somehow, and in an act of sheer coincidence, they stumble upon Gilliam. They pick him to be president and the rest is the movie where Gilliam tries to win office.This movie is supposed to be a comedy, but most of the comedy is too obvious. Chris Rock is the main attraction in this movie, and he does have many funny quotes. The movie as a whole has lots of hilarious dialogue. The movie is basically a spoof and a satire of the political system today, and I think it does that job well. They poke fun at many of the recent political events. Chris Rock has many memorable phrases. When he runs for president he quickly becomes the most unconventional one. He ditches the prepared speeches and starts talking impromptu and from the heart, using some vulgar language while he's at it. This movie did have many funny moments, though, and it's good for a few laughs. Bernie Mac stars as the running mate with Chris Rock, and together they form a hilarious team. I think this movie is funny and worth seeing, but I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you're a serious Chris Rock and Bernie Mac fan, otherwise, just go rent it.",4,Stupid comedy but funny,1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,2199,"['movie', 'stupid', 'beginning', 'viewer', 'barraged', 'onslaught', 'exaggerated', 'political', 'humor', 'However', 'movie', 'funny', 'moments', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'know', 'comedy', 'stuff', 'here', 'just', 'too', 'much.Head', 'State', 'African-American', 'man', 'named', 'Mays', 'Gilliam', 'who', 'alderman', '9th', 'ward', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Not', 'part', 'D.C.', 'imagine-the', 'idealistic', 'majestic', 'buildings', 'Congress', 'memorials-but', 'ghetto', 'Gilliam', 'basically', 'low-level', 'politician', 'beginning', 'movie', 'find', 'being', 'hero', 'saving', 'woman', 'who', 'house', 'going', 'be', 'detonated', 'fortune', 'politician', 'fails', 'kicked', 'office', 'evicted', 'fiance', 'splits', 'him.Meanwhile', 'deep', 'bureacratic', 'offices', 'Congress', 'are', 'big', 'political', 'changes', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'candidate', 'dies', 'crash', 'head', 'party', 'scapegoat', 'run', 'president', 'so', 'could', 'lose', 'Somehow', 'act', 'sheer', 'coincidence', 'stumble', 'Gilliam', 'pick', 'be', 'president', 'rest', 'movie', 'where', 'Gilliam', 'win', 'office.This', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'most', 'comedy', 'too', 'obvious', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'main', 'attraction', 'movie', 'have', 'many', 'funny', 'quotes', 'movie', 'whole', 'lots', 'hilarious', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'basically', 'spoof', 'satire', 'political', 'system', 'today', 'think', 'job', 'well', 'poke', 'fun', 'many', 'recent', 'political', 'events', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'many', 'memorable', 'phrases', 'When', 'president', 'quickly', 'most', 'unconventional', 'one', 'prepared', 'speeches', 'talking', 'impromptu', 'heart', 'using', 'vulgar', 'language', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'good', 'few', 'laughs', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'running', 'mate', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'together', 'form', 'hilarious', 'team', 'think', 'movie', 'funny', 'worth', 'seeing', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', ""'re"", 'serious', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'fan', 'otherwise', 'just', 'go', 'rent']",N/A

And there may be some relevance to that (Pootie Tang, anyone?). But one movie that doesn't fall into that category is Head of State.Basically the movie is about Democratic President-elect Brian Lewis (Nick Searcy)'s biggest competitor unexpectedly dying in a plane crash, leaving the Democratic party needing someone to take his place at the last second -- but someone who is sure to be a sure loser. The Democrats choose as their prospect Washington D.C. alderman Mays Gilliam (Rock). Mays' advisors Martin Geller (Dylan Baker) and Debra Lassiter (Lynn Whitfield -- still sexy after all these years) intend to have everything planned so that the race will look legit to Mays but will still be seen as a losing proposition to everyone on Lewis' team. But things start to change when Mays decides that he wants more control over his own campaign, and especially when he brings in his brother Mitch (Bernie Mac).This is overall a great movie, and it's especially impressive because I believe it was Chris Rock's directorial debut. I gave the movie four stars because the scenes with Mays' crazy (ex-)girlfriend Kim (Robin Givens), though funny, were a bit overdone.

Levine,"[1, 4]","Chris Rock is funny as a local aldrman who gets tapped to run for president when his party's candidate for both president and vice president are killed. He is put up for the purpose of losing but nobody tells him he's a stooge. In his plain talking naivitee, he begins to hit home and his campaign gather's momentum. The problem I have with this movie is that the premise is too far fetched. Obviously, good satire is somewhat far fetched. However, here, all the situations are so unreal and impossible that it becomes difficult to determine what is being spoofed. A good example of the type of comedy that is a great spoof is the classic movie Airplane.  It is all a bunch of silly antics and crazy site gags. However, it is always clear what is being spoofed: diasaster movies of the Airport and Airport 1975 genre. Maybe the classic political spoof of all time is Dr. Strangelove. In that movie, the situations are surreal at times but, there is a certain grounding in political reality for the satire to attach itself too. The silliness in Head of State is, often hilarious, but it isn't connected to anything as a spoof so it loses a little of it's punch. Not only was he the star, but Chris Rock also wrote the movie. Perhaps it would have hit the mark more if Rock knew a little more about the workings of national politics so that there would have been something concrete to satirize.

The peopled involved in the party wanted to use Mays in order to improve their chances at the next presidential election, but what they didn't expect (outside Obama) was Mays bringing the house down and reaching out to the people. America's about to break some noise once Mays use his skills to call house parties, turning a classy limo into a tricked-out tourbus, and having TNA sponsoring him.""Head of State"" is not what I call a satire, nor would I call a coy attempt at political intrigue. It is a farce, a cartoony circus built around a comedy sketch made to be a feature-length movie; this is Chris Rock's world, and he don't give a hoot how he wants to show it. As much as I wanted to hate how over-the-top this movie is...it actually works. Such a tone didn't work for ""Pink Cadillac"" because it didn't fit Clint Eastwood's demeanor and its jokes were half-hearted, but Chris Rock knows how to mainstay comedy for the entire duration and keep it on-the-level.The film's silly, but not excessively so; okay, it IS excessive, but not to the point where it's irritating. It succeeded in maintaining a limit to how far it can be over-the-top, and it does so by one key element: Timing. Rock as the director knows when to keep a joke short, especially when something inane happens like the gay political rally scene; I did chuckle at a couple of quick cuts he made about himself. Mays's ex-wife named Kim (played by Robin Givens) is hilarious because her tone of voice when she yells reminded me of Rita Repulsa; she would be a character I would get sick of quickly and thankfully Rock kept her character in very short bursts.It's crazy, but it's consistently crazy. Just about everyone is unrealistic but it helps the film's favor; in fact, the worst character in the film is Mays's love interest because she's too normal (though to be fair, she wasn't quite one-dimensional). The cast may be zany, but they are likable, especially Dylan Baker as Mays' adviser because his character doesn't act like a common white-collar guy; Bernie Mac (lord bless him, but not for his films like ""Mr. 3000"") made a lively performance as Mays' brother Mitch, and I do like how he slaps his way to the white house.  There's nothing vulgar or offensive about the whole film, and in the most sincerest gratitude I can possibly make, there's not a single blatant 'black' joke in the mix; it does have race-oriented jokes, but nothing groan-worthy, and any tension going on between Mays and his rival candidate is mainly out of experience.""Head of Space"" is a film made for Chris Rock fans, and while I'm not a fan of his material, it is pretty decent.

What a brash and insightful comedy!  Chris Rock stars as Mays Gilliam, a young D.C. alderman who captivates his audiences once he decides to earnestly contend for the presidency.  Made in 2003, when President Obama was still an Illinois state senator, ""Head of State"" not only foreshadows Obama, but also such issues and social ills as video game violence, school shootings, and the call for increased gun control.  Alongside the humor, there is a serious tone about America's problems and her ineffective political solutions.  The hilarity escalates when Bernie Mac, of happy memory, enters in as Mays' jive-talking brother Mitch, recruited as his running-mate when no one else accepts.  Together they blitz the opposition, which consists of a bigoted, two-term vice president and his abused lackeys.  The campaign peaks on the eve of election day with the one and only debate.

612711,A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T,B00005JM4N,Jed Shlackman,"[1, 1]","Chris Rock wrote and directed this film, in which he is the main star.  Rock's character is a down-on-his luck alderman in D.C. who gets dragged off the street by political operatives to be a U.S. Presidential candidate after the party nominee dies in a plane crash.  The idea is to have the Rock character's candidacy draw minority voters to the party to help the party's candidate win the subsequent election in 4 years.  It is expected that the Rock character will be handily defeated by the stuffy, elitist, conservative candidate of the opposition party, the current vice president.  However, Chris Rock hijacks his campaign from the political manipulators, brings his brother (Bernie Mac's role) onto his ticket, and speaks his mind like a typical Chris Rock stand-up routine at campaign stops, resonating with regular folks.  There are some good satirical jokes in the film, and Rock plays his part smoothly.  Some parts are pretty silly and demeaning, such as Rock's brother's standard greeting of giving people a Mike Tyson-style jab, and Rock saying that people need to knock their kids unconscious to teach them to behave well.  Robin Givens plays a pretentious, gold-digging ex-girlfriend, who stalks Rock's character pretending to be a fiance after he gains notoriety as the candidate.  That role is ideal and well acted by Givens.  Overall, this was a clever movie, and Chris Rock fits the role of anti-establishment candidate much better than Warren Beatty as &quot;Bulworth,&quot; which was also a political satire.

There is some of that in the actual movie, but there is quite a bit more as well.The movie actually follows Mays Gilliam (Chris Rock) as he becomes a candidate for President and all through the race.  Mays starts out just working for the Democratic Party in Washington D.C., but when the original nominee is killed in a plane crash, the Party leaders decide to nominate someone who can't possibly win the election but could win minority support for the Party: a working class black man with low level political experience.  Naturally, nobody tells Mays this and he believes that he actually has a chance.  It takes a little time for Mays to get his bearings, but he begins to run his campaign his way (meaning: in a decidedly urban and ethnic manner).  Mays is a down to earth, honest man, who is more at ease talking with the men working at a fundraiser than he is with a Union Boss.I was a little surprised that Rock's biting political humor was mostly absent from the movie.  Yes, during a couple of his speeches and political rallies he got to sound off a little bit, but there was a lot less than I expected.

Yet, in true Chris Rock style, there's always a very practical and poignant message beneath the laughter. So, in the tradition of Norman Lear with All in the Family, my hat's off to Mr. Rock. Okay, here goes my personal side of politics (in a country that professes freedom of speech yet silences those who disagree): The movie story line draws a lot of its inspiration from the G.W. Bush Administration. But, for me, the ""prophetic"" part of this movie is what appears to be the scenario playing out during the 2012 election. In the case of the protagonist in Head of State, the president elect is being put in his position only to fail so that he can be blamed for the mess he inherited.

612720,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JM4N,Lawyeraau,"[4, 5]","This political comedy/satire was directed by, produced by, and co-written by Chris Rock. Quite frankly, while some of it was funny, it was funny-stupid, not funny-sharp or funny-edgy. Even fans of Chris Rock will be a little disappointed, as this supremely talented comedian has yet to find his mark in films. Despite some funny moments, the film fails to deliver fully on its promise.The premise of the film is simple. A low level, grass roots, Washington D.C. politician, Alderman Mays Gilliam (Chris Rock), gets an opportunity of a lifetime, when the two presidential aspirants of an unspecified political party each get killed in plane crashes. Chosen for his high potential to lose the election, thereby setting the stage for another politician to win in a future election, Mays Gilliam at first follows the directives scripted by his campaign handlers, Debra Lassiter (Lynn Whitfield) and Martin Geller (Dylan Baker).Dissatisfied, however,  with his new image and with his campaign's lack of message, Mays Gilliam decides to let his hair down and be himself. Moreover, since no other politician wishes to associate him or her self with Mays Gilliam and run as his vice-president, Mays selects his bail bondsman brother, Mitch (Bernie Mac), to be his running mate. Despite a commanding lead for the presidency by incumbent vice-president Brian Lewis (Nick Searcy), Mays Gilliam starts giving him a run for his money, giving future political hopeful and mastermind, Senator Bill Arnot (James Rebhorn), a bad feeling.Of course, there is a love interest in the film. Lisa Clark is lovely as the cute-as-a-button Tamala Jones, the down to earth, hard working store clerk who loves Mays for himself. There is also a former girl-friend, the beautiful Kim (Robin Givens), who keeps coming after Mays in hopes of becoming first lady. She is sort of a funny, running gag through the film. Then there is the gorgeous Nikki (Stephanie March), who is part of a cadre of  super whores on staff to keep the sexual peccadilloes of politicians in-house.Unfortunately, not even the considerable talents of the gifted supporting cast can turn dross into gold. While the film does have its funny moments, they are almost all of the funny-stupid variety, locking into the lowest common denominator. The funniest moments occur when Nick Searcy, Robin Givens, or Stephani March are on screen. The least funny moments are when Mays and Mitch punch each other in greeting, a running gag that is simply not funny. Bernie Mac has his funny moments in the film, but they are few and far between. This gifted comedian deserves better, as does Tracy Morgan, who has the thankless role of Meat Man, another running gag that fails to inspire many laughs. Chris Rock also gets his share of laughs but is ultimately done in by his own script.As comedy, this film has its moments. As political satire, it loses sight of the prize. Despite its stellar supporting cast, the film misses the mark. A lightweight script and heavy handed direction by Chris Rock himself do nothing to help this venture. The film provides some laughs but not as many as one would expect. Chris Rock is a most talented comedian, sharp and edgy. I only hope that he will find the right vehicle in which to showcase his considerable talents. This is not the one. Rent this moderately enjoyable comedy rather than buy it.",3,IT HAS ITS MOMENTS...,1062892800,"09 7, 2003",2003,3364,"['political', 'comedy/satire', 'was', 'directed', 'produced', 'co-written', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'funny-stupid', 'not', 'funny-sharp', 'funny-edgy', 'Even', 'fans', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'supremely', 'talented', 'comedian', 'yet', 'find', 'mark', 'films', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'deliver', 'fully', 'promise.The', 'premise', 'film', 'simple', 'low', 'level', 'grass', 'roots', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'politician', 'Alderman', 'Mays', 'Gilliam', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'opportunity', 'lifetime', 'when', 'two', 'presidential', 'aspirants', 'unspecified', 'political', 'party', 'get', 'killed', 'plane', 'crashes', 'Chosen', 'high', 'potential', 'lose', 'election', 'thereby', 'setting', 'stage', 'politician', 'win', 'future', 'election', 'Mays', 'Gilliam', 'first', 'directives', 'scripted', 'campaign', 'handlers', 'Debra', 'Lassiter', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'Martin', 'Geller', 'Dylan', 'Baker', '.Dissatisfied', 'however', 'new', 'image', 'campaign', 'lack', 'message', 'Mays', 'Gilliam', 'let', 'hair', 'down', 'be', 'Moreover', 'other', 'politician', 'wishes', 'associate', 'self', 'Mays', 'Gilliam', 'run', 'vice-president', 'Mays', 'bail', 'bondsman', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'be', 'running', 'mate', 'commanding', 'lead', 'presidency', 'incumbent', 'vice-president', 'Brian', 'Lewis', 'Nick', 'Searcy', 'Mays', 'Gilliam', 'giving', 'run', 'money', 'giving', 'future', 'political', 'hopeful', 'mastermind', 'Senator', 'Bill', 'Arnot', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'bad', 'feeling.Of', 'course', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'Lisa', 'Clark', 'lovely', 'cute-as-a-button', 'Tamala', 'Jones', 'down', 'earth', 'hard', 'working', 'store', 'clerk', 'who', 'Mays', 'also', 'former', 'girl-friend', 'beautiful', 'Kim', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'who', 'coming', 'Mays', 'hopes', 'becoming', 'first', 'lady', 'sort', 'funny', 'running', 'gag', 'film', 'Then', 'gorgeous', 'Nikki', 'Stephanie', 'March', 'who', 'part', 'cadre', 'super', 'whores', 'staff', 'keep', 'sexual', 'peccadilloes', 'politicians', 'in-house.Unfortunately', 'not', 'even', 'considerable', 'talents', 'gifted', 'supporting', 'cast', 'can', 'turn', 'dross', 'gold', 'film', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'almost', 'funny-stupid', 'variety', 'locking', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'funniest', 'moments', 'occur', 'when', 'Nick', 'Searcy', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'Stephani', 'March', 'are', 'screen', 'least', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Mays', 'Mitch', 'punch', 'other', 'greeting', 'running', 'gag', 'simply', 'not', 'funny', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'gifted', 'comedian', 'deserves', 'better', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'who', 'thankless', 'role', 'Meat', 'Man', 'running', 'gag', 'inspire', 'many', 'laughs', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'also', 'share', 'laughs', 'ultimately', 'done', 'own', 'script.As', 'comedy', 'film', 'moments', 'political', 'satire', 'sight', 'prize', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'mark', 'lightweight', 'script', 'heavy', 'handed', 'direction', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'do', 'nothing', 'help', 'venture', 'film', 'laughs', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'most', 'talented', 'comedian', 'sharp', 'edgy', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'find', 'right', 'vehicle', 'showcase', 'considerable', 'talents', 'not', 'one', 'Rent', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'rather', 'buy']",N/A

Though he initially follows his handler's orders, Gilliam soon starts doing things in his own outspoken way, which upsets the party leaders who chose him, since they only chose him so he could lose.Chris Rock is a smart, fast-talking comedian and I keep wondering when the academy will figure out he could host the Oscars. Here he plays his usual persona, more or less, in a movie where some of the edges are rough and others are serrated. We keep getting these movie fantasies where political candidates say what they think, are not afraid to offend, cut through the crap and take stands.The film works on the most part, but it isn't as smart or funny as it wants to be. It's enjoyable on the most part, with funny performances by Chris Rock and Bernie Mac (as his brother and running mate), but it desperately needs that 'smart ass edge' it lacks.

612730,A3713PP4MADKED,B00005JM4N,"Nick Watkins ""Nick Watkins""","[0, 0]","""Head of State"" is not a must-see movie, nor is it the typical Chris Rock movie. Rock wrote, directed, and stars in this political comedy (way different from his usual black comedies, which are usually a lot funnier), which might have overloaded him a bit. The jokes aren't like those that were as hilarious in his past movies, but there are a few funny moments, such as the ""Electric Slide"" scene. But it just doesn't add up.This movie is about a man by the name of Mays Gilliam, who is elected to run as president when the man who was supposed to run before him died in a head on plane collision (from talking on the phone, of course). He accepts, very sketchy at first, but becomes more and more comfortable with his position of president...of the Untied States...of America...North America, as soon as he gets inspiration from his big brother (Bernie Mac) to express himself his own way, instead of reading what overs have prepared for him to say. Later on in the movie (a little too late, sadly), Mac joins his brother in the election as position of Vice President, and together they finally get Gilliam's challenger to face them off in a debate.If you want to enjoy this movie enough to give it a even""3"" rating, you have to realize it's a movie, and a comedy at that. In a previous review, someone said that it was ridiouclus that the elderly people at the party instantly knew how to do what he called the Electric ""Fly"".

The movie is an incredibly transparent attempt on his part to spread a soft and cuddly political agenda, which amounts to ""the rich need to have more money taken so that 'workers' can be given more, rather than needing to worry about working hard and putting the American Dream to work for them.""I disagree with that attitude, but even if we accept it as gospel, the construction of this movie is so poor as to totally negate any political message.  It wants to be a lighthearted romantic fantasy (which is certainly fine) and it wants to be a hard-edged political satire (which is fine too).  However, these two styles, especially when neither is very well done, combine VERY awkwardly.1) There is a ""romance"" that is easily the lamest and least involving in years. He meets this girl at a convenience store and on the night of the presidential election, they play cute together. She seems to have no problem calling him or seeing him, even though he's surrounded by security.  I guess his secret service detail will let anyone in to see him just on their say-so.2) Chris Rock himself is a terrible actor. It's finally official...after the disasters of DOWN TO EARTH and BAD COMPANY, there is no longer any question. He can be a funny, in your face comedian, but it all turns to oatmeal on screen.3) There's a scene early on when Rock, as the new candidate, is supposed to be meeting some rich folks at a fundraiser. He dances with his girl for about four seconds, and then suddenly, everyone can dance the electric slide. It's ridiculous, because most of the rest of the movie is constructed to be a traditional movie, not one that goes off on nearly surreal flights-of-fancy, and yet we're expected to believe all these VERY old, uptight donors are suddenly moved to dance to rap music. It's awkward, to say the least.  We've certainly seen similar scenes in other movies before, but there is usually a build-up to the uptight folks loosening up.  They get drawn in to the excitement, the beat, whatever.  In HEAD OF STATE, they go from catatonic to fully engaged in about two seconds flat.4) Bernie Mac, the only funny thing in the movie, is hardly in it at all. For a satire of our political system, his character is the only one that REALLY satarizes and has fun with our system. He's funny...he needs his own movie.5) The movie's tempo drags. I found myself looking at my watch.6) The usually solid Dylan Baker is even pretty bad.I would advise saving my money, and staying far away from HEAD OF STATE!!

Zwick,"[0, 1]","**1/2 Though fun at times, ""Head of State"" is really just a pale imitation of ""Bullworth,"" with Chris Rock as the ""candidate of the people"" who ends up running for President of the United States.  Unlike ""Bullworth,"" however, this film seems less serious in its intentions, opting for a junior high-level vision of presidential politics that robs the film of much of its satirical purpose and bite.Rock, who both directed and co-wrote the film (with Ali Leroi), plays a good-hearted Washington D.C. alderman named Mays Gilliam who, after its own candidate is killed in an airplane crash, is tapped by a major political party (presumably the Democrats, though it is never actually specified) to run for office against a popular Vice Presidential incumbent.  As with ""The Producers,"" the idea here is to find a candidate who is guaranteed to lose the election so that the field will be wide open for a more ""likely"" winner in the 2008 election.  The nave, trusting Mays, of course, doesn't know this and believes he is actually running to win.""Head of State"" provides a few good laughs, but the film, as a whole, feels woefully unimaginative and predictable.  Gilliam's brand of touchy-feely populism sounds as phony and contrived as the hot air bellowing of his conservative rival.  Even though the film is obviously intended as satire, we still need to be able to believe that Gilliam is providing at least a halfway plausible alternative for the concept to have any real point or purpose.  Instead of tweaking the audience and making us squirm - as any good satire should - the movie strokes our ego, allowing us to feel smug and self-congratulatory as we wallow in our own moral righteousness.  Unfortunately, this is what tends to happen when satirists operate in a blatantly commercial venue like this one.  With ""Bullworth,"" Warren Beatty seemed far more willing to push the envelope and risk the commercial consequences.Rock still isn't much of an actor and his skills as a director could use some honing as well.  There are some funny bits early on in the film, but after awhile, the premise, since it isn't being exploited to its utmost effectiveness, simply burns itself out.

612742,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00005JM4N,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[14, 14]","Chris Rock does an excellent job writing directing and co-producing Head of State. It's a hilarious comedy with a lot of heart and a lot of soul. Well-written, intelligent and extremely clever, Rock's comedy stays true to its African-American roots while making commentary about the sad state of the current political process in America. Perhaps in his own way Rock is trying to send a message to politicians to express real ideas, speak from the heart.In Head Of State Chris Rock plays a struggling Washington D.C. Alderman who gets no respect. Constituents don't appreciate the aspiring politician, and his girlfriend (Robin Givens) dumps him leaving him with unpaid bills and a repossessed car. The next day his boss (Keith David) fires him. He thinks things are turning around when the Democratic Party recruits him to run for President. The jokes on him; the Democratic party knows it can't win against the popular two-term Republican vice president in 2004, so they decide to trot out Rock's character as a filler candidate until the 2008 election. They don't believe a black candidate has a chance, but the alderman believes in himself.The campaign is dull until a pep talk from his brother (Bernie Mac) at a Chicago campaign stop. Soon Chris changes campaign tactics and decides to be real. The more he's true to his Black self the more his poll numbers start to go up. This is when the movie really takes off. When Rock's Alderman starts saying what he feels instead of what he's rehearsed, the campaign starts to come to life. All of a sudden this underdog has a chance. All of a suddent the woman who dumped him wants him back, but the candidate has his eyes on a hardworking gas station worker (Tamala Jones)As the alderman's polls numbers start to go up, the incumbent candidate starts to worry about the underdog, Rock's campaign manager's worry about controlling him. But he still believes in himself. He hits a snag after a school shooting, but with the help of his brother decides to challenge the incumbent to a debate. Things come to a head when the two candidates debate. Rock's character is full of energy and new ideas, and he eventually goes on to embarrass the uninspired jargon-spouting incumbent. In the end he wins the presidency becoming the head of State, and gets the girl who works at the gas station.I really enjoyed this movie; I feel guilty about missing this one in theatres because this movie made me laugh and smile so much in two hours. I got give Chris Rock props for creating a film with a positive message and writing black characters in this movie that are intelligent and hardworking. In this ""Gangsta"" era it's rare to see a movie focusing on regular working class black folks. More props to Chris for making a movie with quality production values. A lot of black filmmakers don't take time to focus on crucial details like cinematography, casting and editing. Paying attention to those often ignored film elements transforms Head of State from a good screenplay into a great movie.Besides Rock's hilarious and intelligent portrayal of the presidential candidate underdog, there are some great performances here from the supporting cast. Rock writes well-developed characters for all his cast, not just himself. Bernie Mac steals the few scenes he's in and has great chemistry with Rock; they feel like brothers. Robin Givens is hilarious as the gold-digging ex in her pitiful attempts to win back her man. Givens has the best performance of her career; I never thought she could be so funny. Lynn Whitfield literally disappears from the screen and becomes the campaign manger. She must have channeled Condelezza Rice for this performance. This woman is extremely underrated; she needs to be the lead in more films! (Cough*Halle Berry's upcoming Nefertiri* Cough) Tamala Jones is sweet as the love interest.Head of State is a Shawn James five star essential video. Pick this one up along with Eddie Murphy's The Distinguished Gentleman, CB4, and The Great White Hype for your black cinema night.

The players in Gilliam's life include: Mitch Gilliam, his unsophisticated older brother who becomes his running mate; Kim, his ex-girlfriend who had once dumped him, but who now has a sudden change of heart as she sees a chance at becoming First Lady; Martin Geller, his campaign manager; Lisa Clark, the woman who truly believes in Gilliam; and Debra Lassiter, the woman who doesn't have faith in his candidacy, and is serving as his reluctant advisor. Chris Rock delivers some funny moments in this movie. It's still perfectly watchable though with both Rock and Bernie Mac doing a good job.",3,Head of State (Widescreen Edition),1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,869,"['Mays', 'Gilliam', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'neighborhood', 'Alderman', 'be', 'red-lined', 'job', 'untimely', 'death', 'party', 'frontrunner', 'Gilliam', 'plucked', 'obscurity', 'thrust', 'limelight', 'party', 'nominee', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'players', 'Gilliam', 'life', 'include', 'Mitch', 'Gilliam', 'unsophisticated', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'running', 'mate', 'Kim', 'ex-girlfriend', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'dumped', 'who', 'now', 'sudden', 'change', 'heart', 'chance', 'becoming', 'First', 'Lady', 'Martin', 'Geller', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Lisa', 'Clark', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'Gilliam', 'Debra', 'Lassiter', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'faith', 'candidacy', 'serving', 'reluctant', 'advisor', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'still', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'Rock', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'doing', 'good', 'job']",N/A

The comedy about unknown black guy (Chris Rock) becoming a president could be very funny but unfortumately, it wasn't funny at all. The jokes are all based on 'black guys/white guys' cliches that have been already played many times. Chris Rock is a great stand-up comedian but I yet to see a movie with him that was worth watching. Not recommended, unless you are a die hard Chris Rock' fan.",2,Lame!,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,430,"['movie', 'was', 'disappointment', 'comedy', 'unknown', 'black', 'guy', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'becoming', 'president', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'unfortumately', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'jokes', 'are', 'based', ""'black"", 'guys/white', 'guys', 'cliches', 'have', 'been', 'already', 'played', 'many', 'times', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'great', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'yet', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'Not', 'recommended', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'fan']",N/A
