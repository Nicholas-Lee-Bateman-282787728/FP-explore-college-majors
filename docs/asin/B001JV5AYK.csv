1206812,A14MOU9MF0NNVB,B001JV5AYK,"Angela ""Angel""","[1, 1]","SPOILER ALERT!!!Samuel L. Jackson plays Able, a bad cop who can't stand his new neighbors who happen to be an interracial couple. He has a real problem with their relationship (his black wife apparently cheated on him with a white guy, and that really stuck in his craw), and he has no qualms about letting them know; he cuts their air conditioning unit lines, slashes their tires, shines security lights into their bedroom at night and hires someone to break into their house, etc. All these acts are not met without retaliation, but the new neighbors just can't seem to shake the bad cop because, as Able puts it, ""I am the po-lice!"" It's a frustrating movie, and having a neighbor like Able would certainly make me want to pack my bags and flee the premises. Definitely a fun suspense film, but there wasn't much else to the plot aside from the terrorizing that was shown in the previews. The film tried to be more about the couple being a family, but I didn't really care about them so much as I cared about how they were going to defeat Able in the end. And the end wrapped up too quickly. I thought there would be a little bit more of a happily-ever-after deal. Good for a rental.",3,Extremely pesky neighbor...predictable Samuel L.

1206813,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001JV5AYK,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","What a well made, exciting, action-packed suspense Lakeview Terrace is!This movie completely lives up to the hype, and THEN some.  Any time I watch a thriller of *this* magnitude, I can't help but smile when the film is over and just sit back, reflect, and appreciate all the time and effort that was put into it.It also helps that Samuel L. Jackson completely nails his role as the troublesome neighbor.  Every time he speaks, you're always waiting for something rude to come out of his mouth, or getting ready to hear something odd about his choice of words and mannerisms.  Just some kind of indication that the two neighbors are going to have a dispute with each other sooner rather than later.Then again he makes a good point in one scene- if your trees or bushes are hanging over the fence and into your neighbors yard, and your neighbor feels the need to trim the tree or bush, and you happen to have a problem with them taking action... wouldn't you have no choice but to place blame on yourself?However, the kind of fragile relationship the two neighbors have in this movie goes WAY beyond simple trees and bushes.  This is just pure anger and special hatred.  You know, it's ""special"" because these two neighbors have a distinct eye-twitchingly kind of hatred toward each other.I'm not so sure the final scene makes sense though.  Without spoiling the conclusion... wouldn't the police department be more inclined to side with one of their own partners instead of a strange man holding a gun and calling the shots?  This goes for any workplace, not just the police department- you'd side with the people you know, NOT some complete stranger holding a gun.  At least, I would.  Then again, I've never been put in a situation that Samuel L. Jackson's character and his neighbor were in, but the fact remains the police department weren't aware of the rocky relationship between the two neighbors.Overall, this is how action movies should ALWAYS be- exciting, unpredictable, and just adrenaline-rushing from beginning to end.",5,love thy neighbor,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,2032,"['What', 'well', 'made', 'exciting', 'action-packed', 'suspense', 'Lakeview', 'Terrace', 'movie', 'completely', 'up', 'hype', 'THEN', 'Any', 'time', 'watch', 'thriller', '*this*', 'magnitude', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'when', 'film', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'reflect', 'appreciate', 'time', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'it.It', 'also', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'completely', 'role', 'troublesome', 'neighbor', 'time', ""'re"", 'always', 'waiting', 'something', 'rude', 'come', 'mouth', 'getting', 'ready', 'hear', 'something', 'odd', 'choice', 'words', 'mannerisms', 'Just', 'kind', 'indication', 'two', 'neighbors', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'dispute', 'other', 'sooner', 'rather', 'later.Then', 'again', 'good', 'point', 'one', 'scene-', 'trees', 'bushes', 'are', 'hanging', 'fence', 'neighbors', 'yard', 'neighbor', 'need', 'trim', 'tree', 'bush', 'happen', 'have', 'problem', 'taking', 'action', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'choice', 'place', 'blame', 'However', 'kind', 'fragile', 'relationship', 'two', 'neighbors', 'have', 'movie', 'WAY', 'simple', 'trees', 'bushes', 'just', 'pure', 'anger', 'special', 'hatred', 'know', 'special', 'two', 'neighbors', 'have', 'distinct', 'eye-twitchingly', 'kind', 'hatred', 'other.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'final', 'scene', 'sense', 'spoiling', 'conclusion', 'would', ""n't"", 'police', 'department', 'be', 'more', 'inclined', 'side', 'one', 'own', 'partners', 'instead', 'strange', 'man', 'holding', 'gun', 'calling', 'shots', 'workplace', 'not', 'just', 'police', 'department-', ""'d"", 'side', 'people', 'know', 'NOT', 'complete', 'stranger', 'holding', 'gun', 'least', 'would', 'Then', 'again', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'put', 'situation', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'neighbor', 'were', 'fact', 'police', 'department', 'were', ""n't"", 'aware', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'two', 'neighbors.Overall', 'how', 'action', 'movies', 'should', 'ALWAYS', 'be-', 'exciting', 'unpredictable', 'just', 'adrenaline-rushing', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A

This is where things really gets scary and the audience become very angry.  Things start to escalate out of control and darken at this point.

1206821,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001JV5AYK,Chris Pandolfi,"[20, 24]","Don't think for one second that director Neil LaBute and screenwriters David Loughery and Howard Korder didn't know what they were doing. ""Lakeview Terrace"" is not merely a disturbing thriller about a black cop that hates his neighbors for being an interracial couple; it's an intelligent, thought-provoking examination of race relations in general, strengthened by its atypical cinematic approach to racism. How different would the reaction to this film be if the roles were reversed, if it told the story of a racist white cop that hated his black neighbor? It would most likely be ignored, because goodness knows we've seen such movies before. ""Lakeview Terrace"" is refreshing in its willingness to look at things from a largely unseen perspective, which in turn gives the audience more to think about. What a mature turn for LaBute, who completely missed the mark with his God-awful 2006 remake of ""The Wicker Man.""It should be noted here that Lakeview Terrace, a suburb of Los Angeles, is where Rodney King was beaten and arrested by the police in the spring of 1991. This is obviously not a coincidence on the filmmaker's part, and neither is the fact that the story is ambiguous in its social commentary. Essentially, LaBute expects up to make up our own minds about who's right and who's wrong. Granted, it seems pretty clear-cut throughout the film; LAPD officer Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson) goes to great lengths to destroy the lives of his new next-door neighbors, and he does so because the husband, Chris Mattson (Patrick Wilson), is white and the wife, Lisa (Kerry Washington), is black. Turner begins slowly, dropping a series of subtle hints. His security lights, for example, come on in the middle of the night, and they shine directly into the Mattsons' bedroom. As the film progresses, his hostility escalates into full-blown psychological warfare.I'm making this sound far too simple. Turner is not merely an evil man; as both a cop and a single father, he's seen his fair share of injustice. To elaborate would give too much away, but rest assured, he has very definite reasons for hating his neighbors, for wanting to not only get them out of Lakeview Terrace, but also to drive a wedge between them. Chris and Lisa are introduced as a lovey-dovey couple happy to be first-time homeowners. But it isn't long before tensions begin mounting. Example: Chris is hesitant to start a family even though Lisa is eager. He has legitimate reasons for wanting to wait; they just moved in, after all, and they need time to settle into their new lives. In spite of this, one can't help but believe it has nothing to do with settling in. While not directly stated, it may, in fact, have to do with raising biracial children. This, as it turns out, is a source of tension between Chris and Lisa's father, Harold (Ron Glass), who never seems to address his son-in-law without a great deal of effort.Is it possible that Chris and Lisa were never meant to be together? Did they fall in love for all the wrong reasons? Again, none of this directly stated. But considering the way they're now treating each other, it seems very likely that they're rethinking some of the decisions they've made. Lisa thinks their biggest mistake was moving to Lakeview Terrace, not just because their neighbor is unfriendly, but also because she's away from her family and her friends. Chris, determined to prove himself as both a husband and a man, refuses to leave the neighborhood. This paves the way for the film's last twenty minutes, which, on the surface, unfolds in much the same way as an ordinary thriller. Below the surface lies miscommunication, grief, and a lifetime of hard feelings, none of which make it easy to determine who represents good and who represents evil. I say this because, when the climactic final battle between Chris and Turner begins, we immediately see that both men are pointing guns at each other.The most interesting moments in ""Lakeview Terrace"" occur within the first ten minutes, when Turner and his children meet at the breakfast table. His young son, Marcus (Jaishon Fisher), comes downstairs wearing a Lakers jersey. Turner wants him to take it off because it displays the number twenty-four, which is Kobe Bryant's number. He's made it abundantly clear that from now on, they're giving all their support to Shaq. Why? Is it because of Bryant's highly publicized extramarital affair? Immediately afterwards, he scolds his fifteen-year-old daughter, Celia (Regine Nehy), for not using correct English. Is he encouraging his children to be the best they can be, or is he controlling them because improper speech reminds him of someone he hates?While these questions are never answered, they still add a tremendous amount of depth to the story, solidifying Turner as a man holding a grudge against the world. I have no doubt that some audiences will see things from his point of view; when life hurts you a few too many times, hatred is completely understandable. On the same token, I'm sure that many will have no sympathy for him at all. Some will see him as a heartless monster preying on an innocent couple. Both arguments are valid. You should take them into consideration when watching ""Lakeview Terrace,"" a taut, suspenseful human drama that will make you uncomfortable no matter what side you take. My hope is that it will start a line of communication. If it doesn't lead to peace, then maybe it will lead to an understanding. Of all the things noticeably absent from ""Lakeview Terrace,"" a line of communication is the most important.",4,Hate Thy Neighbor,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,5572,"['Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one',

I just do not like the way the religious group (not Christian or Muslim) who controls Hollywood are now trying to make it appear as if the black man is not the victim of racism, but the racist himself!I know this sort of thing is the latest thing in race relations, to call blacks raciss against whites when we all know the opposite is the standard.  That is my problem with the theme.  On the acting side, the white husband was cast wrong.  He and his wife never seemed like they were together or in love.  He also did not act or look like a guy who would want a black woman or listen to old school hip-hop.  I just was not convinced on his part.The girl who played Jackons's daughter was cute and it was good to see Ron Glass out there since I thought he had died.  It is still a good movie that you already know how it will build up.  I just don't like the portrayal of a black man as a 24 hour racist.

This film has such a housewarming. Another way to warm a house is with a loving couple inside. This film focuses on such a loving couple, a white man and a black woman. Patrick Wilson is Chris Mattson, and Kerry Washington is his wife, Lisa. They move into a house in suburban Los Angeles.It's a good neighborhood. But, most unfortunately for the couple, their next-door neighbor is LAPD Officer Abel Turner, extremely well played by Samuel L. Jackson. Turner seems to be experiencing a meltdown after twenty-eight years on the police force. He has endured the loss of his wife in a traffic accident, and he has come to suspect that his wife was having an affair with her employer.He's very harsh as he tries to control his rebellious teenage daughter. And, on top of it all, he hates interracial couples. There's some explanation offered for his prejudice, but basically Turner is a man with a lot of hate inside. He makes his new neighbors aware of his hatred for their relationship in both subtle and very in-your-face ways. He doesn't want them in the neighborhood and is determined to drive them out.The suspense centers on the question: Is Turner an eccentric officer on the edge, or has he crossed the line and become dangerously psychotic? Jackson brilliantly builds this suspense.Chris Mattson has a hard time believing that Turner is truly evil and hopes that he will turn out to be a good cop. Wilson effectively captures Mattson's ambivalent feelings about his weird neighbor. Washington skillfully portrays Lisa, who wants to have a baby, but is frustrated by Chris's reluctance.Yet another way that a house can be warmed is literally, by a fire. And this film has a brushfire closing in on the neighborhood!I found the ending to be a bit of a stretch, but the film was highly entertaining.",5,Housewarming,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,1933,"['are', 'various', 'ways', 'keep', 'house', 'warm', 'One', 'traditional', 'housewarming', 'new', 'neighbors', 'are', 'invited', 'film', 'housewarming', 'way', 'warm', 'house', 'loving', 'couple', 'inside', 'film', 'loving', 'couple', 'white', 'man', 'black', 'woman', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Chris', 'Mattson', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'wife', 'Lisa', 'move', 'house', 'suburban', 'Los', 'Angeles.It', 'good', 'neighborhood', 'most', 'unfortunately', 'couple', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'LAPD', 'Officer', 'Abel', 'Turner', 'extremely', 'well', 'played', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Turner', 'be', 'experiencing', 'meltdown', 'twenty-eight', 'years', 'police', 'force', 'endured', 'loss', 'wife', 'traffic', 'accident', 'come', 'suspect', 'wife', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'employer.He', 'very', 'harsh', 'control', 'rebellious', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'top', 'interracial', 'couples', 'explanation', 'offered', 'prejudice', 'basically', 'Turner', 'man', 'lot', 'hate', 'inside', 'new', 'neighbors', 'aware', 'hatred', 'relationship', 'subtle', 'very', 'in-your-face', 'ways', ""n't"", 'want', 'neighborhood', 'determined', 'drive', 'out.The', 'suspense', 'centers', 'question', 'Turner', 'eccentric', 'officer', 'edge', 'crossed', 'line', 'become', 'dangerously', 'psychotic', 'Jackson', 'brilliantly', 'suspense.Chris', 'Mattson', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'Turner', 'truly', 'evil', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'cop', 'Wilson', 'effectively', 'Mattson', 'ambivalent', 'feelings', 'weird', 'neighbor', 'Washington', 'skillfully', 'Lisa', 'who', 'have', 'baby', 'frustrated', 'Chris', 'reluctance.Yet', 'way', 'house', 'can', 'be', 'warmed', 'literally', 'fire', 'film', 'brushfire', 'closing', 'neighborhood', 'found', 'ending', 'be', 'bit', 'stretch', 'film', 'was', 'highly', 'entertaining']",N/A

Jackson stars in this deliciously-shaded thriller set in the diverse and seeming tranquility of an upscale Los Angeles suburb. Abel Turner (Jackson) is an iron-fisted, near-psychotic rogue LA cop, an embittered (and sometimes racist) widower left with the unenviable task of raising two teenagers.  A young, attractive and apparently happy interracial couple (Patrick Wilson and the smoldering Kerry Washington) move in next door and unwittingly set off Abel's poisonous campaign of intimidation and escalating terror.  Director Neil Labute is keenly interested in the sometimes twisted mash-up of 21st century social relationships, particularly as they relate to race and class. As usual, Labute--whose previous credits include the viciously unsettling ""In the Company of Men"" (where two misogynist businessmen play a devastatingly cruel practical joke on an attractive deaf woman)--gets under a viewer's skin, illustrating, for example, several large and subtle pitfalls that confront mixed-race couples--no matter how well-adjusted--as they navigate various social terrain.  Although marred by some predictable suspense-thriller genre conventions and coincidences (not to mention the conveniently wrapped-up ending), ""Lakeview Terrace"" consistently hold's one's attention as it effectively probes social tensions that lie just beneath a deceptively calm and placid surface.

1206825,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001JV5AYK,Dave. K,"[2, 3]","LAKEVIEW TERRACE**** Out of 5Release Date- September 19th, 2008Running Time- 110-MinutesRating- PG-13Screenplay- David Loughery & Howard KorderDirector- Neil LaButeStarring- Samuel L. Jackson, Patrick Wilson, Kerry Washington, Ron Glass, Regine Nehy, Jaishon Fisher and Jay HernandezLakeview Terrace is pretty much your standard suspense thriller that really doesn't offer anything new; the concept of someone terrorizing a young couple is something this genre has seen before plenty of times as well as in the horror genre and the fact the villain is a police officer is also hardly original. But despite the lack of original ideas and despite the clich&eacute;s Lakeview Terrace manages to work well despite these problems. The biggest complaint it seems from the audience is the ending. But my question is what were you expecting? You should know ahead of time how the movie will end and it's not like the movie is going down one path than delivers the clich&eacute;d ending. Again you should know ahead of time how it will all play out.The major thing I liked about Lakeview Terrace is the movie doesn't come across as preachy. The idea of an interracial couple isn't going to sit well with a lot of people, and while I have no problems with it I see as your life and you be with whoever makes you happy regardless of race or religion or whatever. But I don't watch a movie to be preached to even if I agree. And while I do believe cinema has a lot of power and can even change someone's life I don't think someone who is hateful will just stop after watching a movie.The screenplay by David Loughery & Howard Korder is overall well written, but it just lacks original ideas. Like I said we've seen this concept done plenty of times and the writers aren't really able to offer anything new. But despite that Lakeview Terrace is mostly well written and the main characters Chris Mattson played by Patrick Wilson and Lisa Mattson played by Kerry Washington are both likeable and sympathetic even if their characters are clich&eacute;d. There are some attempts to flesh the characters out and it sort of works, but more due to the actors than the writers. There was potential with Abel Turner played by Samuel L. Jackson and while the character does work I can't help, but feel more could have been done with him. But despite these problems the script works and in the end gets the job done.Director Neil LaBute does a solid job even if he follows the typical format of this type of movie. He never really injects much originality in the movie and pretty much does it by the books, but the pacing is good and there is some decent suspense even if we the audience know how things will play out. I would have liked to have seen Neil LaBute try and throw some twists in there, but in the end he gets the job done and delivers a well made and enjoyable movie.The actors really make this movie a lot better than it should have been and bring a lot more to their characters than the writers had on paper. Patrick Wilson delivers a solid performance and is quite sympathetic and Kerry Washington is excellent, but while she is good enough actress it's her charisma that shines here. She's a really likeable actress and has a lot of charisma and here in helps elevate her character. As for Samuel L. Jackson this guy is always great. He has this amazing on screen presence and always shines no matter how good or bad the movie.I would have liked to have seen more done with the Abel Turner character, while we do learn a little about him we don't learn enough. Obviously he has a problem with Chris and Lisa being married, but was it racism or was more of a guy with a lot of problems? Again he's clearly not happy with a black woman being married to a white man, but to me the character just came across as more of a guy just lashing out rather than being racist. And what was Abel like before the death of his wife? Did that send him over the edge or was he always like this? I do think these things are important to address and they never really are.The only other complaint I have is the marriage between Chris and Lisa starts off strong, but with increasing pressure starting with Lisa's father and than Abel problems arise in their marriage. And those problems are them being an interracial couple. But it's quite clear from the start Lisa's father had a problem with it and it's just weird how now all of a sudden race is a problem. Like I said their relationship was rock solid, but chips away through the movie; we never see them when they are first together or anything, but one has to assume being in an interracial marriage they probably dealt with this in the past, but now all of a sudden puts a strain on their relationship.Despite the problems with Lakeview Terrace it's a highly enjoyable movie and while it offers nothing new to this genre it works despite that. While this doesn't come highly recommended it is worth a look for sure.The Blu-ray has an excellent transfer and sound quality; the extras are the same as the DVD. The only difference is the BD has the BD Live. The behind the scenes are brief, but offer a good look at the movie also included are deleted scenes and an audio commentary track from Neil LaBute and Kerry Washington.",4,Despite the cliches

Patrick Wilson does what he can with the material, and while he makes a good rival for Jackson, I would love to see what a more capable actor like Edward Norton could do with the material.

It has been done before in several film and now Sam L Jackson gets a shot on playing a bad guy.  First, Sam's character isn't evil.  He is actually a loving father, unfortunately he gets a kick out of being an authority figure.  He is a blue collar guy who has a white collar couple (yuppies) move next door and he seems to have a real problem with that.What I did like, is the husband's take on the whole black and white couple thing and how he felt being under society scrutiny as if he has something to prove.I bought this blu-ray because I am a Sam L Jackson fan, the movie looks interesting and it is interesting, and just because it's a typical thriller (in my book) doesn't mean its not enjoyable.  It is.  The disc comes with some special features and the one I watched were the deleted scenes.  You can tell why they were deleted.  Some gave away too much too early and one particular scene, if kept in, wouldn't make sense.  Lakeview Terrace is not a movie that needs to be seen on blu-ray.  There are no special efx shots, or not real big majestic scenery scene, but since I have a blu ray, and a fan of Sam L, I decided to get it.  This is a recommende rental in my book.

1206853,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001JV5AYK,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 9]","How far would you allow someone to push you before you begin to return in kind? That is the basic plot of ""Lakeview Terrace"" starring Samuel L. Jackson and Patrick Wilson. It's a story of two men who find themselves locked in what seems like an unending battle of one-ups upon each other. For those of you that love movies and have seen your fair share of them, you may be thinking, ""Didn't Sam Jackson already do a film just like this several years ago with Ben Affleck?"" The answer is yes, and the film was ""Changing Lanes"". So, what could possibly make an actor of Samuel L. Jackson's caliber want to do a virtual retread of a film he already did, especially when said film was quite good, albeit depressing. The only reason I can think of is that ""Lakeview Terrace"" could be viewed as a movie with more of a commercial appeal than the former, but if that is the primary reason (aside from the considerable payday Sam undoubtedly walked away with), was this endeavor a worthy one?""Lakeview Terrace"" focuses on a young couple (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington) as they begin to settle into what appears to be their dream home in the most ideal of neighborhoods. Everyone in the neighborhood seems pleasant, and as an added bonus they discover they have an officer of the LAPD (Samuel L. Jackson) living just next door. But, as the newlyweds quickly discover things may appear too good to be true, as their man of the law neighbor soon begins interfering in their daily lives in some very intrusive and increasingly creepy ways. The only question is how far will this couple allow themselves to be pushed before they choose to fight back?If I were in charge of creating a film, and had even the slightest glimmer of hope that said film could become a hit, there would be a few aspects of the film that I would want to make sure were in perfect working order before I would even begin production. For starters, the script must be top-notch. Without a solid backbone to base the movie off of, what hope does one have of crafting a movie that will entertain audiences and keep them talking about the experience for days to come? Second, the casting must be ideal. If the cast doesn't work well, it doesn't matter if the script is Shakespeare or a modern classic, it will fall flat if not handled with the proper care from those speaking the dialogue. Lastly, I would try as hard as I could to keep my movie as original as possible (a feat that is harder and harder to accomplish these days), or at least avoid using tired, old clich&eacute;s and predictability so that the audience will stay interested in what I'm putting on the screen. In the case of ""Lakeview Terrace"" some of these items were utilized to a degree of success, while others either failed miserably or seemed to be completely ignored.As far as the story goes, ""Lakeview Terrace"" was well-paced, with a good story that features plenty of suspenseful moments to keep the thrill-factor up for a majority of the film. Writers David Loughery (the upcoming film ""Obsessed"") and Howard Korder (""Stealing Sinatra"") have managed to take a decent premise (albeit one that has been used quite often in films), and imbue it with a hefty dose of tension to keep the audience paying attention; however, the characters are either far too clich&eacute;d or just plain unlikable to really invest ourselves in. Despite a fairly well-paced story, the movie fails in the end because I just didn't care about the main characters at all; and for a movie like this to succeed I believe you have to be able to choose a side in the conflict or else what's the point.In regards to the cast, each member did well with their respective roles, even if some were overtly unoriginal and tired. For Samuel L. Jackson the part probably seemed good in conversation, but I have to think that after reading the script he should have been able to figure out that his character and the one-ups in the movie have already been done before with much greater success in previous films. Truthfully, I'm surprised he even signed on due to the fact that the basic plot for the movie is nothing more than an updated and sleeker version of his previous work on ""Changing Lanes"". Whatever his reasons, at least Sam did a good job in the role, as he usually does; and surprisingly he actually delivers a more restrained performance than most, a slight change of pace for one of his many characters.Alongside Sam Jackson we have Patrick Wilson as the new husband next door. Prior to this film I had seen Patrick in the movie ""Little Children"" opposite Kate Winslet (""Titanic"") and I have to say that not only did I hate that film, but I also couldn't stand Patrick's character either. Something about him is irritating to me, I don't know if it's his demeanor or presence or what, but I have a hard time actually liking any character he plays. So for this movie I did my best to suspend my loathing of Patrick, in hopes of becoming invested in his character in order for the story to work better. It turns out this was a wasted effort because the script only devotes a small amount of time early on in the film to making him seem like a likeable person, before he begins to retaliate against Sam's character, while at the same time becoming insensitive and mean to his wife.Speaking of Patrick's onscreen wife, Kerry Washington does a nice job in the role, and is really the one likeable person out of the main characters. Surprisingly, her part seems very limited despite being onscreen for a decent amount of time throughout the movie; it's just that the writers don't seem to give her all that much to do except be mistreated by the other two characters in the film. What's strange about her character, is that she is established at numerous times throughout the movie as a fairly strong-willed, opinionated woman, lending to the school of thought that she wouldn't put up with too much crap from anyone. However, over the course of the film she never once stays truly angry about anything going on around her. While her character may be the most likeable in the story, she is also the most unbelievable in terms of what she puts up with from not only her neighbor, but also from her husband. A man who supposedly loves her, yet never seems to show any kind of remorse regarding things he has said and done. So for her to put up with all that without fighting back on her own, seems like a bit of a stretch given her character's basic make-up.""Lakeview Terrace"" should have been a great thriller, and many of the necessary components were in place to make it so; however, the unlikable characters, somewhat unoriginal story, and characters for that matter, diminished any chances of me truly enjoying the movie. As for the film's director, Neil Labute, this was a better effort than his previous work, the dismal ""The Wicker Man"" remake, but still not a great movie, so better luck next time.""Lakeview Terrace"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.",2,How Much Abuse Will You Take Before You Fight Back?,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,6986,"['How', 'far', 'would', 'allow', 'someone',

Jackson as tyrannical neighbor and cop Abel Turner, embodies the manifestation of what most of present day society likes to believe is an anachronism, a relic of a past generation wholly incapable of adaptation and acceptance of belief systems that contradict his experiences. From the moment Abel espies his new next door neighbors, Chris and Linda Mattson (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington) a young interracial couple only interested in establishing a solid foundation to their recent marriage, it is evident the best that can be hoped for is strained association. Abel holds court with an iron fist completely devoid of the silk glove in all of his interactions and relationships; with his two children, with his fellow cops and most especially, as the self-ordained caretaker of the cul-de-sac.For the three quarters of the film, Jackson's character grows increasingly dislikeable and threatening  while the Mattsons' also face some customary encumbrances that may confront any newlywed couple but compounded by the additional factors of ethnic distinctions and the intrusive neighbor. Ron Glass, in a supporting role as Linda Matteson's father, adds context where one can see that Turner's beliefs are not necessarily foreign to his generational peers. Yet, as the film progresses it unfortunately follows a path that leads to only one possible outcome, one that belies what the viewer has come to understand about Turner and his motivations.As usual Kerry Washington is absolutely alluring but the script does not offer much to work with as far as acting range and expressiveness are concerned.

Jackson has always been one of my favorite actors and his performance here is both interesting and fun to watch. It's a good thriller and cautionary tale as well as a riveting examination of the tensions that can easily arise and escalate between neighbors, and how you just never can tell that the person living next door to you could turn out to be the neighbor from hell.The story takes place in modern-day Los Angeles in the titular suburban subdivision of Lakeview Terrace amid the backdrop of some larger-than-usual, massive brushfires in the L.A. area. Chris (Patrick Wilson) and Lisa Mottson (Kerry Washington), an interracial, self-indulgent yuppie couple, have just moved into their posh, new starter home on Lakeview Circle within the neighborhood. Little do they know what they've gotten themselves into. Their new next-door neighbor is tough-as-nails, veteran LAPD officer Able Turner (Jackson), who seems friendly and amiable enough, yet still somehow has a subtly menacing quality about him. He's an ever-vigilant, suburban watchdog commando who makes constant, nightly foot-patrols of his neighborhood and whose house is equipped with super-bright, baseball-stadium-worthy floodlights installed in both the backyard and side of the house ---- right across from the young couple's upstairs bedroom. Able strongly disapproves of Chris and Lisa's interracial relationship (particularly their nighttime lovemaking sessions in the backyard pool) and its possible negative influences on his teenage daughter and son ------- so much so that he goes to extreme lengths to sabotage it, intimidate them into moving and generally make their lives as new neighbors hell. Able begins by grilling Chris about he and Lisa's amorous antics and all but threatens him to pack it up and leave the neighborhood. The tensions between neighbors mount slowly, until it escalates into a game of nasty, sly, passive-aggressive head games and pyschological one-upsmanship between Chris and Able, which occasionally borders on the comical side. There's lots of social commentary about race, class and tolerance throughout and how even the most well-meaning among us can have misinterpretations of each. The plot is somewhat formulaic and is comparable to several other movies ---- most notably 1992's Unlawful Entry ---- but director Eric Labute's direction is so well executed and the performances from the entire cast so nicely done that the film manages to hold the viewer's interest up to the end. Samuel L. Jackson's turn as Able Turner is hard, intense, funny, ever-watchable and it's evident Jackson was having a good time with the role. Look for the scene with Able as a guest at Chris and Lisa's housewarming party where he manages to create a tense atomosphere by verbally intimidating the other guests, running away with the conversation and even getting Chris in trouble with Lisa by intentionally blabbing about Chris's cigarette butts left around his property. The movie boasts many funny quotes and Jackson drops a lot of crisp, racially-charged dialogue throughout, most of it directed at Patrick Wilson's white character of Chris. In an early scene, where Able while on one of his nightly foot patrols encounters Chris in his car listening to rap music while having a smoke that, ""you can sit here in that car all night and listen to that music until 8:00AM and you'll still be white."" Hilarious. It all leads up to a tense, terrorizing and thrilling finale.An above-average, riveting domestic thriller that was very entertaining in a simple, purist-type way. I guess the moral of the story is that if you're a young, liberal, interracial couple, don't move in next door to Able Turner. I found it to be a pretty enjoyable matinee movie for the fall season where you feel like you've had a good time and gotten your five bucks worth afterward when you walk out of the theater.",3,"A Tense, Riveting Thriller And A Definite Must-See!!",1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3960,"['have', 'say', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'performance', 'here', 'interesting', 'fun', 'watch', 'good', 'thriller', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'as', 'well', 'riveting', 'examination', 'tensions', 'can', 'easily', 'arise', 'escalate', 'neighbors', 'how', 'just', 'never', 'can', 'tell', 'person', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'could', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'neighbor', 'hell.The', 'story', 'place', 'modern-day', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'titular', 'suburban', 'subdivision', 'Lakeview', 'Terrace', 'backdrop', 'larger-than-usual', 'massive', 'brushfires', 'L.A.', 'area', 'Chris', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Lisa', 'Mottson', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'interracial', 'self-indulgent', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'posh', 'new', 'starter', 'home', 'Lakeview', 'Circle', 'neighborhood', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'what', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'new', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'tough-as-nails', 'veteran', 'LAPD', 'officer', 'Able', 'Turner', 'Jackson', 'who', 'friendly', 'amiable', 'enough', 'yet', 'still', 'somehow', 'subtly', 'menacing', 'quality', 'ever-vigilant', 'suburban', 'watchdog', 'commando', 'who', 'constant', 'nightly', 'foot-patrols', 'neighborhood', 'house', 'equipped', 'super-bright', 'baseball-stadium-worthy', 'floodlights', 'installed', 'backyard', 'side', 'house', 'right', 'young', 'couple', 'upstairs', 'bedroom', 'Able', 'strongly', 'Chris', 'Lisa', 'interracial', 'relationship', 'particularly', 'nighttime', 'lovemaking', 'sessions', 'backyard', 'pool', 'possible', 'negative', 'influences', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'son', 'so', 'much', 'extreme', 'lengths', 'sabotage', 'intimidate', 'moving', 'generally', 'make', 'lives', 'new', 'neighbors', 'hell', 'Able', 'begins', 'grilling', 'Chris', 'Lisa', 'amorous', 'antics', 'pack', 'up', 'leave', 'neighborhood', 'tensions', 'neighbors', 'mount', 'slowly', 'game', 'nasty', 'sly', 'passive-aggressive', 'head', 'games', 'pyschological', 'one-upsmanship', 'Chris', 'Able', 'occasionally', 'borders', 'comical', 'side', 'lots', 'social', 'commentary', 'race', 'class', 'tolerance', 'how', 'even', 'most', 'well-meaning', 'can', 'have', 'misinterpretations', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'formulaic', 'comparable', 'several', 'other', 'movies', 'most', 'notably', '1992', 'Unlawful', 'Entry', 'director', 'Eric', 'Labute', 'direction', 'so', 'well', 'executed', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'so', 'nicely', 'done', 'film', 'hold', 'viewer', 'interest', 'up', 'end', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'turn', 'Able', 'Turner', 'hard', 'intense', 'funny', 'ever-watchable', 'evident', 'Jackson', 'was', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'role', 'Look', 'scene', 'Able', 'guest', 'Chris', 'Lisa', 'housewarming', 'party', 'where', 'create', 'tense', 'atomosphere', 'verbally', 'intimidating', 'other', 'guests', 'running', 'away', 'conversation', 'even', 'getting', 'Chris', 'trouble', 'Lisa', 'intentionally', 'blabbing', 'Chris', 'cigarette', 'butts', 'left', 'around', 'property', 'movie', 'many', 'funny', 'quotes', 'Jackson', 'lot', 'crisp', 'racially-charged', 'dialogue', 'most', 'directed', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'white', 'character', 'Chris', 'early', 'scene', 'where', 'Able', 'one', 'nightly', 'foot', 'encounters', 'Chris', 'car', 'listening', 'rap', 'music', 'having', 'smoke', 'can', 'sit', 'here', 'car', 'night', 'listen', 'music', '8:00AM', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'white', 'Hilarious', 'up', 'tense', 'terrorizing', 'thrilling', 'finale.An', 'above-average', 'riveting', 'domestic', 'thriller', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'simple', 'purist-type', 'way', 'guess', 'moral', 'story', ""'re"", 'young', 'liberal', 'interracial', 'couple', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'next', 'door', 'Able', 'Turner', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'matinee', 'movie', 'fall', 'season', 'where', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'had', 'good', 'time', 'gotten', 'five', 'bucks', 'worth', 'afterward', 'when', 'walk', 'theater']",N/A

The new generation of Americans who got used to flash their intimate feelings in public without weighing the consequences of inflaming others versus the old generation that viewed intimate feeling too sacred to be advertised in the open. Between the two generation ran a link of racial and class feud. The Black police officer took the law in his own hand and succeeded in may instances to solve complex social problems with big heart and little or no adherence to the standards of his profession. The law turned into a lethal tool by which he destroyed his own family and came very close to ruin his neighbor's. The new resident of Lakeview Terrace unaware of the protective and intrusive nature of their neighbor and police officer triggered his deep seated anger on their liberal expression of their emotion, that was perceived as a threat to the raising of his children,The conflict that led to the death of two people was fueled by both parties' impatience with trivial issues in their neighborhood. The police officer who was able to restrain his kids from sneak-watching of neighbors intimate expression of feeling failed and instead perceived his neighbor and mixed couple as a threat to his family's moral upbringing. The new neighbor was too edgy with demanding their old neighbor to turn his lights off, keep the noise down, and refrain from working in his own backyard.The movie is a great story on dealing of neighbors, avoiding devastating social conflicts with the least restraint of not inflaming others, and on the overzealous abuse of power by those entrusted to enforce the law.

1206873,A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ,B001JV5AYK,Negative Comments,"[21, 25]","There's an inherent problem with making a movie of this kind: unless you're a creative genius of your time, these sorts of movies have the potential to turn real generic, REAL fast.Reminiscent of Denzel Washington fromTraining Day, we see Samuel L. Jackson play an overly aggressive cop with an agenda, with the movie focusing on the problems he's causing for his new neighbors. A completely realistic situation that can take place anywhere. Problem is, because a movie like this is completely character driven, after you have the nice slow build up to the climax, once the tension snaps, you're relegated to basically a generically default final act of the movie where ""the bad guy finally comes out of the proverbial shadows and literally chases the hero."" (i.e.Disturbia,The Glass House). It's a shame too because the buildup on this was very good. Samuel L. Jackson was really scary here, he played that bullying, obsessive character perfect. The only acting problems I saw were 2-3 moments from Kerry Washington where her sad face was done poorly, with overly done lip quivers and facial movements (similar to Kirsten Dunst's crying scenes from the Spider-Man movies, except done in a BAD way).With a movie like this, you pretty much have these possible outcomes:1) the generic, semi-predictable ending (like we got here).2) tragic ending with hero dying at the end.3) an unpredictable twist coming out of left field (this has the potential to be very good or very bad).4) a Great ending.Unfortunately we usually get number one, since they wanna give the satisfying, safe, effective, tried and true, Hollywood ending.

1206874,AZFZ9ETUCBJTM,B001JV5AYK,Patrick,"[3, 3]","This was overall a really good movie. I found the majority of the plot to be original and creative. You basically have Samuel L. Jackson playing a neighbor who at first seems to be a good cop and family man that just likes his privacy but he quickly shows himself as something worse. Everyone knows the story so I'm not going to give everyone the 1000th summary of the movie. Basically I found myself at first thinking Jackson's character was a pretty decent guy and by the time the movie was over I was shocked at the dark side to this character. What started out as a minor dislike for his neighbors eventually turned into a hatred for them. No matter what they did, he wanted them out of that house and he would go to great lengths to make sure that happened.This was one of Samuel L's best acting performances ever in my opinion. He does a great job of having you believe he's a good family man one minute and a crazy lunatic of a neighbor the next. It was interesting to see how he would react to different things the neighbors were doing and how far he would go. The movie certainly kept you guessing through most of it. The one downside for me as others have said was the ending which seemed predictable and bery un-original. A better ending and this movie would be a 5 star movie.

The first few confrontations, with subtle hints of racism and hostility, are carefully worded and brimming with tension.

I would have much preferred a ""Changing Lanes"" (also starring Jackson) type ending where the characters realize how stupid they're being and quit before resorting to Hollywood violence.

Jackson stars as the neighborhood-watchdog-from-hell in ""Lakeview Terrace,"" a sociological thriller with racial overtones.  Jackson plays Abel Turner, an LAPD officer and widower with two kids who doesn't much cotton to the fact that an interracial couple has moved into the house next door.  He makes his disapproval felt almost from the start - first, subtly, through thinly disguised racist innuendo, then more blatantly, through acts of vandalism and out-and-out violence.  At first, the couple, Chris and Lisa Mattson, try looking beyond all the hostility that is being hurled at them by this clearly unstable individual, but as Abel ratchets up the frequency and ferocity of his attacks, Chris and Lisa are forced to take a more proactive stand against him.  As ""Crash"" attempted to point out a few years back - much less successfully in my opinion - racial tensions run high even in a supposedly liberal ethnic melting-pot like Los Angeles.  Add to that the perpetual threat from out-of-control brushfires in the area and it becomes clear that suburbia hasn't borne witness to this much trauma and havoc since that hapless family found itself sharing quarters with a houseful of uninvited spooks in ""Poltergeist.""  And, like that film, ""Lakeview Terrace"" shows just what happens when the American dream of home ownership suddenly and unexpectedly turns into a nightmare of epic proportions.Directed by Neil LaBute, ""Lakeview Terrace"" is to be commended for its willingness to even broach such a touchy subject in the first place - let alone make the African-American character the perpetrator of the racism rather than the victim of it.  Luckily, Jackson brings a soul-cringing realism to the character that helps to counteract some of the more sensationalistic, over-the-top elements that creep into the David Loughery/Howard Korder screenplay especially towards the end.  For, indeed, the movie is at its sharpest and most compelling in the early stages, when Abel is still attempting to hide his evil beneath the veneer of at least some degree of social acceptability.  But once that veneer is stripped away, the movie wanders off into the areas of incredibility and melodrama and becomes considerably less intriguing as a result.Going beyond the racist angle, the movie also raises the troubling question of just who one is supposed to turn to for help when the very source of one's grievance just happens to already be a fully-entrenched member of the law-enforcement community.Jackson gets some very fine support from Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington, who make us empathize with the couple and the ordeal they are being put through.  Moreover, the screenplay makes an effort to add some complexity and depth to each of the various characters who could easily have remained two-dimensional stereotypes in less gifted hands.  Only in the final half hour or so does the movie go completely off the rails into overwrought silliness.

I can't decide on which character I'd hate to live next to more because Denzel surely did his thing, but Samuel L. Jackson was another rough cop, except to top off his arrogant and abusive thoughts of criminals, he's racist too. When Abel (the name irony caught me) Turner realized that the two Black folks on the block were father and daughter instead of husband and wife and the ""mover"" turns out to be the sista's husband, you could just smell the Archie Bunker in him coming out. Only his views weren't comedic. He was flat out hostile. Police lights, vandalism, physical abuse, etc. I can't think of a worse neighbor to have, and Jackson played the hell out of his role. Samuel L. Jackson has a gift for having a full scene with just the expression on his face. He doesn't even have to open his mouth, and you can tell how he's feeling by the way he tilts his head, squints his eyes, and that cool dip walk that he has always had. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I'll probably go see it again just to watch the havoc he creates.My only complaint, which isn't really a complaint, is the couple were so incredibly NOT street smart. When the ""evidence"" was found, I wanted to scream at the screen as soon as the ""evidence"" was used to catch the ""criminal."" It's not often that I want to yell at movie screens. I don't usually get that wrapped up, but I stomped my feet, slapped my forehead, and sighed a lot through the entire last scene because only two people with 0% street smarts would react like that to the ""secret."" However, the characters played their role to the tea and that's exactly how someone who isn't used to this type of situation would react. If I say anymore, I'll give away the ending.

1206890,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001JV5AYK,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 1]","Samuel L. Jackson has been in over 100 movies and proven himself as an entertainment icon. He has played both heroes and villains with charismatic gusto and rampant enthusiasm. In Lakeview Terrace he portrays the primary antagonist Abel Turner with a truly gleeful menace, but unfortunately the screenwriters have allotted such an elaborate back-story and copious amounts of piteous moments to this vicious manipulator that it's very evident the audience is supposed to sympathize with him. Herein lies the problem as Turner's descent into madness becomes so psychotic that such empathy is quickly lost.When interracial couple Chris (Patrick Wilson) and Lisa Mattson (Kerry Washington) move to an idyllic suburban neighborhood, they hope for peace, quiet, and a fresh start on building a family. What they don't expect to find is their racist, sarcastic, condescending, ruthless, grammatically correct and politically incorrect next door neighbor Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson) - who also happens to be a cop. With the law on his side and a sadistic grudge in his heart, Turner sets about antagonizing the Mattsons with increasingly violent tactics. Having nowhere to turn and an understandable obstinacy, Chris and Lisa fight back with mind games and diversionary methods, but little do they know the monster they've unleashed inside the unstable police officer...Sometimes it's hard to root for the ""good guy."" It's even harder when the antagonist is portrayed in such a way that the audience is supposed to sympathize with him. Lakeview Terrace does just that by offering us the full spectrum of disgruntled police officer Abel Turner's life, complete with two children and the stresses of his day job. We're given such an involving examination of his daily predicaments and hardships that we feel obligated to provide our empathy. Too bad he's a complete psycho and his ability to think rationally is rapidly disappearing. As the story veers towards its inevitable conclusion, the full weight of the situation dawns on us, but the film conveniently ends before the real tragedy surfaces, leaving the audience to ponder who, if anyone, actually triumphed from the whole calamitous confrontation.While Samuel L. Jackson is entertaining in just about everything he's in (entertaining, not exceptional) Lakeview Terrace runs dry with both its lengthy duration and the fact that its storyline is almost identical to 1992's Unlawful Entry. It's a mortifying thought to be unable to turn to the police for help - unfortunately we've already been through that fear with Kurt Russell and an equally impressive Ray Liotta in Jackson's role. Granted that Unlawful Entry is relatively obscure, but originality points still can't be rewarded. Additionally, the film includes so many unnecessary subplots that the audience practically begs for the drawn-out conclusion - repeatedly pounding themes into the viewer's mind accounts for frustration, not character development. Plus, many of the subplots are left unresolved or purposely forgotten in the hopes that the audience will focus squarely on the crisis at hand, but they still linger after both the expected conclusion and the rolling credits. Lakeview Terrace does provide thrilling moments and a villain who loves his merciless taunts, but contemplate the real value of the lessons learned and you might negate the fun you've had.- The Massie Twins",2,Lakeview Terrace Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,3397,"['Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'been', '100', 'movies', 'proven', 'entertainment', 'icon', 'played', 'heroes', 'villains', 'charismatic', 'gusto', 'rampant', 'enthusiasm', 'Lakeview', 'Terrace', 'primary', 'antagonist', 'Abel', 'Turner', 'truly', 'gleeful', 'menace', 'unfortunately', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'allotted', 'elaborate', 'back-story', 'copious', 'amounts', 'piteous', 'moments', 'vicious', 'manipulator', 'very', 'evident', 'audience', 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'Herein', 'problem', 'Turner', 'descent', 'madness', 'becomes', 'so', 'psychotic', 'such', 'empathy', 'quickly', 'lost.When', 'interracial', 'couple', 'Chris', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Lisa', 'Mattson', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'move', 'idyllic', 'suburban', 'neighborhood', 'hope', 'peace', 'quiet', 'fresh', 'start', 'building', 'family', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'racist', 'sarcastic', 'condescending', 'ruthless', 'grammatically', 'correct', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Abel', 'Turner', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'cop', 'law', 'side', 'sadistic', 'grudge', 'heart', 'Turner', 'antagonizing', 'Mattsons', 'increasingly', 'violent', 'tactics', 'Having', 'nowhere', 'turn', 'understandable', 'obstinacy', 'Chris', 'Lisa', 'fight', 'back', 'mind', 'games', 'diversionary', 'methods', 'little', 'do', 'know', 'monster', ""'ve"", 'unleashed', 'unstable', 'police', 'officer', 'hard', 'root', 'good', 'guy', 'even', 'harder', 'when', 'antagonist', 'portrayed', 'such', 'way', 'audience', 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'Lakeview', 'Terrace', 'just', 'that', 'offering', 'full', 'spectrum', 'disgruntled', 'police', 'officer', 'Abel', 'Turner', 'life', 'complete', 'two', 'children', 'stresses', 'day', 'job', ""'re"", 'given', 'involving', 'examination', 'daily', 'predicaments', 'hardships', 'feel', 'obligated', 'provide', 'empathy', 'Too', 'bad', 'complete', 'psycho', 'ability', 'think', 'rationally', 'rapidly', 'disappearing', 'story', 'veers', 'towards', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'full', 'weight', 'situation', 'film', 'conveniently', 'real', 'tragedy', 'surfaces', 'leaving', 'audience', 'ponder', 'who', 'anyone', 'actually', 'triumphed', 'whole', 'calamitous', 'confrontation.While', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'entertaining', 'just', 'everything', 'entertaining', 'not', 'exceptional', 'Lakeview', 'Terrace', 'dry', 'lengthy', 'duration', 'fact', 'storyline', 'almost', 'identical', '1992', 'Unlawful', 'Entry', 'mortifying', 'thought', 'be', 'unable', 'turn', 'police', 'help', 'unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'already', 'been', 'fear', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Jackson', 'role', 'Granted', 'Unlawful', 'Entry', 'relatively', 'obscure', 'originality', 'points', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'Additionally', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'subplots', 'audience', 'practically', 'drawn-out', 'conclusion', 'repeatedly', 'pounding', 'themes', 'viewer', 'mind', 'accounts', 'frustration', 'not', 'character', 'development', 'many', 'subplots', 'are', 'left', 'unresolved', 'purposely', 'forgotten', 'hopes', 'audience', 'will', 'focus', 'squarely', 'crisis', 'hand', 'still', 'linger', 'expected', 'conclusion', 'rolling', 'credits', 'Lakeview', 'Terrace', 'provide', 'thrilling', 'moments', 'villain', 'who', 'merciless', 'taunts', 'contemplate', 'real', 'value', 'lessons', 'learned', 'might', 'negate', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

But, you never really figured out where Abel was coming from, he was bad, then he was good, then he was homicidal.  I give it two stars for the majority of Sam's performance.But, I have a large problem with movies where the people in it won't help themselves.  None of us are perfect - we all make mistakes.  But when the protagonists do stupid, stupid things, time and time again, it drives me batty and ruins whatever connection I have with a movie.  This generally happens in almost every horror movie released these days and many suspense flicks such as this one.I wont get into the specifics for those of you who havent seen it, but lets just say while Jackson's antics are extreme, they probably arent completely unjustified for these inconsiderate neighbors.It escalates, and when it does, the typical final confrontation breaks out.  Always, categorically, does the protagonist manage to incapacitate the bad guy only partially, THEN PROCEED TO LEAVE HIM ALONE!  Guess what happens?!?  The bad guy gets back up and chaos ensues.

1206892,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001JV5AYK,trebe,"[0, 0]","Versatile Samuel L. Jackson, is almost always worth watching, in anything he appears in.  In Lakeview Terrace (2008), Jackson is Abel Turner, a LAPD police officer, who has some issues with his new neighbors, who happen to be an interracial couple.  New to the neighborhood are Lisa Mattson (Kerry Washington), who is African American, and from Oakland, and her husband Chris (Patrick Wilson), who is from Chicago, and is white.  Unfortunately, there will be trouble between these neighbors.  But how extreme will it get?Able Turner is a man with some prejudices, and as a cop and single father of two, he has concerns about neighborhood security, and who is living next door.  The Mattson's are just trying to settle in as smoothly as possible, but being observed cavorting naked in their pool, by Able and his kids, creates some unintended waves.Turner's security floodlights, aimed into their windows are a small bother, and Chris tries to be reasonable, and talk things out.  He is shocked, when Able advises him that maybe he is living in the wrong place.  Still trying to be friendly, the couple invite the Turner's to their housewarming party, but after Able insults other guests, things really start to get testy.  Matters escalate, and the animosity grows, leading to an overly dramatic confrontation at the fence between the properties.Life gets more complicated, as the Mattson's discover that Lisa is pregnant, and officer Tuner gets a little too theatrical during an arrest, and then again poolside at the Mattson's.  It is clear that Abel is unstable and driven by an inner demon, and he finally goes too far.  As raging brushfires threaten to destroy Lakeside Terrace (where is the lake by the way?), the madness we have all been expecting, is finally unleashed.  That the conclusion is overplayed and not very credible, is not a big surprise, but it does keep the film from being really special.A commentary track by director Neil LaBute (Nurse Betty) and Kerry Washington, is rather thoughtful, mainly accentuating the positives.  The film features the Mattson's almost exclusively in their home, but the deleted scenes feature a few looks at Chris and Lisa on the job, as well as two versions of a confrontation between Abel and Lisa.Lakeside Terrace builds momentum, and then heads someplace dark.  To maintain a PG-13 rating, the level of violence is toned down.  Jackson, Washington, and Wilson all give good performances.  Able Turner is an exaggerated cartoonish character, and his reasons for resenting his neighbors is perhaps too simplistic, but it is still interesting to see just how twisted matters get, and how others react to him.  We may live in enlightened times, where Barack Obama could be elected President, and interracial marriage is commonplace, but not so long ago, such was not the case.",3,"racially charged and rather predictable, but the strong performances make it worth a look . . .",1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,2828,"['Versatile', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'almost', 'always', 'worth', 'watching', 'anything', 'Lakeview', 'Terrace', '2008', 'Jackson', 'Abel', 'Turner', 'LAPD', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'issues', 'new', 'neighbors', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'interracial', 'couple', 'New', 'neighborhood', 'are', 'Lisa', 'Mattson', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'who', 'African', 'American', 'Oakland', 'husband', 'Chris', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'who', 'Chicago', 'white', 'Unfortunately', 'will', 'be', 'trouble', 'neighbors', 'how', 'extreme', 'will', 'get', 'Able', 'Turner', 'man', 'prejudices', 'cop', 'single', 'father', 'two', 'concerns', 'neighborhood', 'security', 'who', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'Mattson', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'settle', 'as', 'smoothly', 'possible', 'being', 'observed', 'cavorting', 'naked', 'pool', 'Able', 'kids', 'unintended', 'waves.Turner', 'security', 'floodlights', 'aimed', 'windows', 'are', 'small', 'bother', 'Chris', 'tries', 'be', 'reasonable', 'talk', 'things', 'out', 'shocked', 'when', 'Able', 'maybe', 'living', 'wrong', 'place', 'Still', 'trying', 'be', 'friendly', 'couple', 'invite', 'Turner', 'housewarming', 'party', 'Able', 'insults', 'other', 'guests', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'get', 'testy', 'Matters', 'escalate', 'animosity', 'leading', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'fence', 'properties.Life', 'more', 'complicated', 'Mattson', 'discover', 'Lisa', 'pregnant', 'officer', 'Tuner', 'little', 'too', 'theatrical', 'arrest', 'then', 'again', 'poolside', 'Mattson', 'clear', 'Abel', 'unstable', 'driven', 'inner', 'demon', 'finally', 'too', 'far', 'raging', 'brushfires', 'threaten', 'destroy', 'Lakeside', 'Terrace', 'where', 'lake', 'way', 'madness', 'have', 'been', 'expecting', 'finally', 'unleashed', 'conclusion', 'overplayed', 'not', 'very', 'credible', 'not', 'big', 'surprise', 'keep', 'film', 'being', 'really', 'special.A', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Neil', 'LaBute', 'Nurse', 'Betty', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'rather', 'thoughtful', 'mainly', 'accentuating', 'positives', 'film', 'Mattson', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'home', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'feature', 'few', 'looks', 'Chris', 'Lisa', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'versions', 'confrontation', 'Abel', 'Lisa.Lakeside', 'Terrace', 'momentum', 'then', 'heads', 'someplace', 'dark', 'maintain', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'level', 'violence', 'toned', 'down', 'Jackson', 'Washington', 'Wilson', 'all', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'Able', 'Turner', 'exaggerated', 'cartoonish', 'character', 'reasons', 'resenting', 'neighbors', 'perhaps', 'too', 'simplistic', 'still', 'interesting', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'twisted', 'matters', 'get', 'how', 'others', 'react', 'may', 'live', 'enlightened', 'times', 'where', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'could', 'be', 'elected', 'President', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'commonplace', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'such', 'was', 'not', 'case']",N/A
