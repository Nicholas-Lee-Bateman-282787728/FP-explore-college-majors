(btw, the answer is &quot;Maybe because they fear death.&quot;  Both sweet and tart, it has just the right blend of humor, melancholy, and true love.  Cher is at her best here as Loretta Castorini, a widow who falls in love with the younger brother of her fiance, Nicholas Case and Danny Aiello respectively--both equally amazing in these roles.  Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia round out the case as Loretta's parents.  Feodor Chaliapin Jr. is priceless as Loretta's dog-doting grandfather and catch John Mahoney before he became &quot;Frasier&quot;'s dad.My favorite scene is the where Loretta first meets Johnny at the bakery.

From the widowed character Cher plays that longs for a married life and almost ends up with the wrong guy, to the Mom  (Olympia Dukakis) that looks for a single answer to a big question (Why do  men chase women?).  Every character plays both their practical side and  their romantic side.  This was the heart of the movie. We all opt for the  practical, but hope for the romantic (moonstruck).

Cher has had a hugely successful career in music; she was well-known with Sonny, but it was her solo career that seemed more successful. But Cher wasn't about to be successful in just the music business; Cher wanted to be successful as an actress as well. Cher has starred in a wide load of movies, such as 'Chastity', where she played the title role, 'Silkwood', where she played Dolly Pelliker, 'Mask', where she played Florence 'Rusty' Dennis, 'Suspect', where she played Kathleen Riley, 'The Witches Of Eastwick', where she played Alexandra Medford, etc. But it was her role as Loretta Castorini in the romantic comedy, 'Moonstruck' that made her another one of today's best actresses.Taking place in New York City in 1987, Cher playes Loretta Castorini, a lonely Italian widow, who is longing for her Prince Charming to sweep her up off her legs and get her out of her misery. Loretta goes to dinner with her best friend, Johnny Cammareri (played by Danny Aiello). Johnny surprisingly proposes to Loretta, and she happily accepts. Although Loretta likes Johnny a lot because he is her best friend, she knows for a fact that she does not love him. After dinner, Loretta drives Johnny to the airport, for he is flying to Sicilly to be by the side of his dying mother. Before he boards the plane, Johnny gives Loretta the number to his brother's place, and tells her to invite his brother to the wedding. The two lived their lives without seeing or speaking to each other for five years, due to an accident. Loretta assures Johnny that she'll do so and goes home to tell her mother and father, Rose and Cosmo Castorini (played by Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia). Loretta wakes up the next morning, with a phone call from Johnny, asking if Loretta had called his brother yet. Loretta informs Johnny that she'll do so when she hangs up with Johnny. She calles Johnny's brother, but his brother sounds very bitter about Johnny getting married first. Loretta walks down to where Johnny's brother works. Ronny Cammareri is Johnny's brother and he works in a little bread factory, who is still miserable after losing his hand in a bread chopper. He feels Johnny was responsible since, Ronny was using the chopper to chop up some bread for Johnny. Loretta takes Ronny back to his place and begins to explain the truth to Johnny's misery. But the two wind up sleeping together.The next morning, Loretta wakes up the next morning only to find Ronny by her side and flips out. She realizes that what she did was wrong, for she is still engaged to Johnny. But Ronny finds himself having fallen madly in love with Loretta... literally. Ronny invites Loretta to the opera, telling her that he loves her dearly and loves the opera dearly. He then says that if he could be with the woman he loves for one more night and to spend the night with the woman he loves by attending a show he loves dearly, he would promise not to bother Loretta again. Loretta goes to the Met, where she meets up with Ronny. The two sit through the opera, very much enjoying the show. Loretta seemed to have enjoyed very much, until she finds her father with a woman and that woman is not her mother. Ronny and Loretta go back to Ronny's place. Loretta does not want to be unfaithful, since she has been unfaithful to Johnny already once. But she knows that she does not love Johnny, for she is madly in love with Ronny and, for the first time, really sees that Ronny is love with her. Will Loretta leave Johnny for Ronny, or will she stay with Johnny?

I love the grandfather and his five dogs who howl at the moon mainly because I am a huge dog lover.  Actually, in some ways the grandfather is my favorite character, he is only around for comic relief, but he really makes me laugh almost every time he is in a scene, especially in a very tense moment at almost the very end of the movie where no one is talking, and he says: &quot;Someone tell a joke.&quot;  I love how this movie is like a snapshot of a traditional type Italian family.  Italian is a beautiful sounding language and, even though I have almost no idea what the words mean, I love listening to the characters talk in Italian.  Luna is a much more beautiful sounding word than moon.  I love Olymphia Dukakis in the role of the mother; she is just wonderful.  Nicholas Cage is a mad man in this movie-but his character is hilarious.  My favorite scene with him is after the opera where he is trying to convince Loretta that she should chose him over his brother.  The arguments that he uses are both logical and illogical at the same time.  I love it when Loretta (Cher) describes Ronny (Cage) as the wolf who chewed off his own hand to escape the trap of loving the wrong woman--because Ronny is a very wolfish-like character.  The only other movie I have seen with Cher in it is Mask.  She did just as good, if not better, in this comedic role as she did in her dramatic role in Mask.

Cher plays a young widow who lives with her extended Italian-American family in New York. Her day job is not too exciting: she works in a funeral parlor. And by night, she works equally hard to get her middle-aged beau, Johnnie, to marry her. Not for love, mind you--she believes that love died with her deceased husband--but for security.Of course the plot thickens, to include Johnnie's extremely eclectic but surprisingly sexy younger brother, played to the hilt by Nicolas Cage. The brother, a baker, has lost a hand in a work-related accident, and nurses a longtime grudge against Johnnie, whom he blames for causing the mishap. Cher gets herself involved in the feud--and finds herself swept away in a mad love affair.The supporting cast is superb. Olivia Dukakis is Cher's acerbic and still-attractive mother, the doyenne of the traditional Italian home. The late Vincent Guardino, a plumber with grandiose delusions about his sexual attractiveness, gives a bravura performance as the father with a wandering eye.At the end of this unpretentious movie, which makes no claim to philosophical depth, the viewer is left with a big smile and a feeling of warm pleasure. I have viewed this movie countless times, and it never fails to delight me.",5,Bella!
