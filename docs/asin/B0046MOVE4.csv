The mega-suspense end deserves a writing award for Simon Burke.First one must overcome seeing Michael Kitchen as antagonist (NOT THE WONDERFUL MR. FOYLE'S WAR HERE.) A ten-year younger Kitchen plays nasty lawyer Steven Vey superbly. In the dialogue Vey admits he's ""a devious, immoral, hypocrite."" 3 hours later, after the story ends, you will agree with him, even though his ailing mother does not.An adopted ex-con seeking his real dad, his pals, a raped secretary (Caroline Catz-`Doc Martin), & her flat-mate Tanya all get caught up in conspiracy connected to the appointment of Vey as judge. Secrets and the unknown create a woven maze of actions and intents on everyone associated. Who will die or live becomes independent of the group's individuals to control. Masterful complexity of events set into motion due to individual decisions. It all began with a bottle.Quite different, but excellent executed roles, by the pre-`Foyle's War' Kitchen, as well as the pre-`Doc Martin' Catz. ""THE GUILTY"" proves the depth and diversity of acting ability of this famous pair between 1992-2011. This double feature length, 2-DVD set, will grip and knot every nerve. It is British unrated, but definitely adult (NO KIDS) due to graphic violence, content, 1 breast visual, and it's not your feel-good moral finale.

Steven Vey (Michael Kitchen) is a London attorney who is about to be promoted to a judge. But in a night of drunken madness, he sexually assaults, Nicky (Caroline Catz), one of the secretaries in his office. At first you think he might be at least slightly redeemed as he seems to feel remorse for his actions. But eventually he shows his true colors and has her fired in order to protect himself. At first Nicky is too afraid to do anything about it, but once she sees he is promoted to judge, she knows she can't stand idly by. She confronts him and gives him the option of stepping down from his position or she will go to the police and the papers.In the meantime, ex-con Eddy Doyle (Sean Gallagher) learns that Steven Vey is his real father and goes out in search of him. Along his way, he befriends Nicky and her room mate. When he finally finds his father, Steven pulls him into a conspiracy that could lead to murder. Eddy is horrified by what his father asks him to do and at first has no idea that it involved Nicky. But one of his friends is so desperate to make enough money to pay off the mobsters that are after him that he is ready to do anything and Eddy may not be able to stop him.""The Guilty"" runs for about 200 minutes.

Though married, Vey has eyes for a young secretary in his office. She is sufficiently flattered by his flirting that the two end up one evening after work at her apartment. Sensing that she has allowed things to go too far, she tries to end their evening together, but Vey is not about to be rebuffed, and he proceeds to force himself on the young woman. Not long after this incident, Vey receives a coveted appointment to the bench. The young woman, wanting some sense of justice but believing that she would have little chance of getting it in court, contacts Vey with an offer: if he resigns his judgeship, she will remain quiet about what he did to her; if he does not, she will go public.The stage is set for a promising drama, which makes what follows all the more disappointing. First, the story shifts from London to Birmingham and to a young petty thief, Eddy Doyle. Doyle learns from his mother that the man he thought was his father is actually his adoptive father, that his biological father is a man by the name of...  Steven Vey! Learning this, Doyle is off to London to try to locate Vey. In what follows, the story goes off the rails, at least it did for me, because of the coincidences the writers invoke to intersect the paths of Doyle and Vey and of Doyle and the young lady who was Vey's victim. If you are tolerant of these preposterous twists, then you will probably be as impressed with this mini-series as others here are.

1387876,A1QM7NGKJNX1RP,B0046MOVE4,Paul L. McKaskle,"[1, 1]","Two actors who have become well known in the US (at least by watchers of British TV on PBS stations) are Michael Kitchen in Foyle's War and Caroline Catz in Doc Martin.  Impressed by both, I looked to see what other movies each had made and discovered both were in this film, ""The Guilty"" a 201 minute mini-series shown on British TV almost 20 years ago--which has only recently been released on DVD.  Kitchen was well established in Britain by 1992 (the date of the film) but, except for a small role as a receptionist in a single episode of a long running sitcom, it was Catz's first film-she was 22 years old.The movie is simply terrific-gripping until the very end and though there are some spoilers in reviews and commentary on Amazon.com, very suspensful throughout.  I can't remember when my wife and I were last so engrossed in a movie and I am amazed that it hasn't been a smash hit--it surpasses anything Alfred Hitchcock has filmed.  (It did get some awards in Britain when it was shown there on TV back in 1992.)  The acting throughout is excellent.  Kitchen has the same mannerisms and low key acting that make him such a compelling Foyle-though of course he is playing a role which is almost the polar opposite in terms of character.  Catz is equally accomplished, and one has a foretaste of her excellent acting as Louisa Glasson in Doc Martin.  Her career after this movie and until Doc Martin consisted mainly of being a police officer in a series of detective serials, a few episodes of ""The Bill"" and ""The Vice"" and being the co-star police detective in a three season program ""Murder in Suburbia"" all well known in Britain but not familiar to most American audiences.  I'm surprised that her performance in ""The Guilty"" didn't turn her into an international star overnight.One reviewer disliked it because Michael Kitchen's moral character was so different than in Foyle's War.  Yes, it is, but to me it only shows what a versatile actor he is.  I don't think that should be held against the movie.  A couple of others have commented on the unusual number of coincidences necessary to drive the plot forward.  I agree, and more than once I muttered that only if one of the characters had spoken up about what they knew, the situation might have turned out for the better.  But, I don't think of this as a defect-it simply allowed the complexity of thoughts and motives of the leading characters to be fully developed.I'd give ""The Guilty"" twenty stars if possible.
