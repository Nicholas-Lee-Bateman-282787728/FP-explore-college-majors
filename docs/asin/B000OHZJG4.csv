Along with ""The Snake Pit"" (set in a mental institution) it set the standard for so many ""incarcerated women"" films to follow, as well as for numerous parodies (most notably, the stage produciton, ""Women Behind Bars."" which featured Divine as the sadistic matron). For decades I've wondered why it has not been made available in video format. Better late than never.

1063941,A2H80RTEIALU4Q,B000OHZJG4,Beth Harmon,"[1, 1]","Eleanor Parker portrays Marie Allen, an innocent and unwilling accomplice in a robbery and finds herself sent to prison doing 1 to 10. She's a fish out of water with the other hardened, more experienced female inmates. She finds herself at the mercy of the brutal head matron, Evelyn Harper (Hope Emerson). But she does find a sympathetic soul in the warden, played by Anges Moorehead (of TV's Bewitched) and even befriends a couple of other, more gentler inmates.Unfortunately, Marie suffers many a loss and disappointments during her time in jail, which drastically changes her and sets her up for her tragic destiny.This is probably the best women's prison ever made. Most women in jail stories, especially in the 70's and 80's, have the gals incarcerated either raped or pimped out to fellas on the outside. This movie was made in 1950 and imprisonment with the female gender was taken a bit more seriously back then, at least in Caged.Parker is great in this and so is the rest of the cast. You really feel sorry for Marie and you end up really fearing for her when you see what becomes of her in the end.

1063942,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000OHZJG4,Byron Kolln,"[6, 7]","CAGED was written with great insight by Virginia Kellogg, who posed as an inmate in a real women's prison in order to gain true authenticity for the subject.  The results still speak for themselves.  With no overly dramatic pretense or campy stunts, CAGED is a powerful character study about the transformation of one young woman, forced into prison for a crime she barely committed.Marie Allen (Eleanor Parker, ""Detective Story"") is arrested and sent to jail as an accomplice for a gas station robbery.  Her unemployed husband, in bad need of money, was shot and killed in the attack.  Once inside the prison, Marie learns that she is two months pregnant--and there will be no sympathy for the jailbird mother.  Sadistic head Matron Harper (Hope Emerson) makes Marie's life a misery, forcing the expectant mother to spend hours scrubbing the floors.  Marie's only salvation lies with the kindly superintendent Mrs Benton (Agnes Moorehead), and the possibility of getting an early parole.  But with Matron Harper on the warpath, Marie's chances of escaping her hell are as bleak as the jailhouse walls...Eleanor Parker's amazing, Oscar-nominated performance is the icing on the cake for this riveting movie.  Her transformation from naive innocent to hard-boiled jailbird is a marvel to witness.  Observe the way her body language and the tone of her voice changes during the film.  CAGED also features some of the most talented actresses of the period (Lee Patrick, Ellen Corby, Betty Garde, Jan Sterling, Jane Darwell and Olive Deering), all free from makeup and the glamorous trappings of regular Hollywood fare.Nothing about this film seems false or calculated.  The characters are very real and fleshed-out, everyone has their own story to tell.  You'll be able to find new aspects and angles each time you watch it.  The minimalist score is provided by Max Steiner.  CAGED is a rare gem that deserves to be rediscovered.The DVD includes the trailer.

John Cromwell offers muscular direction and there are some truly sinister and effective moments, notably from an imposing actress who plays prison officer Evelyn Harper  -  it's her show and she's rivetting in it. The lead is played by Eleanor Parker who despite being nominated for an Oscar gives a mannered, unconvincing and uneven performance, overacting and touching her hair at every turn. In this she's a girl turned sour by the prison system. Amongst the penitentiary inmates there features more than one awful, over-the-top theatrical and bitterly irritating performance  -  Ellen Corby's is the worst of them. The rest of the girls give solid, entertaining performances in a script which by now sounds archaic.

I can not emphasize enough how spectacular Eleanor Parker is in the lead role. This lady definitely deserved her Oscar nomination in 1950, and the only way to really understand this praise is to watch the film and ""behold"" her performance. It's absolutely incredible and will haunt you for years.Ms Parker is well supported by perhaps the greatest cast ever assembled for a ""prison"" film. Agnes Moorehead, Jan Sterling, Jane Darwell, Ellen Corby and especially Hope Emerson as the evil, head-guard Evelyn Harper,and Betty Garde as Kitty Stark, the tough leader of the prisoners. They are extremely impressive in their very demanding roles.This film is also a huge eye-opener about how crooked politics, neglect and dire human conditions used to saturate America's prisons.

Eleanor Parker is Marie Allen, a 19 year old who was somewhat innocently involved in her husband's botched armed robbery attempt (he is killed). Marie is sentenced to prison and mixed in with a lot of hardened criminals, an evil corrupt matron (Hope Emerson), and a few loonies to boot. It also turns out that Marie is pregnant; what a place to have a baby! Ruth Benton (Agnes Moorehead) runs the facility, and understands that mixing first-time offenders with hardened criminals is a bad formula; however, all of her attempts to improve the system fall on the deaf ears of the Board of Directors who only look at dollars and cents and have no desire to fix the system. Eleanor Parker gives a standout performance as Marie; watching her go from a scared naive girl to a hardened prisoner is amazing...at first it's difficult to believe that Parker could have been cast as the evil Baroness in ""The Sound of Music,"" but watching her performance and transformation, it is not difficult to understand what a talented actress she was. Both Parker and Emerson were nominated for Oscars for this film (as was the script). Moorehead, Ellen Corby, Jane Darwell, and Betty Garden also give standout performances. This film was directed by John Cromwell, a very noted director of the day. Nothing low-budget here; it's really a shame that this has been stuck in a ""Cult Camp Classic"" series, as I feel it does this film a disservice. Don't look for a happy ending, either; this film doesn't have one. It is meant to be a condemnation of the prison system at the time and this film does not go easy on its topic.

1063949,A5CWLYXR7HOVJ,B000OHZJG4,Duane,"[2, 2]","I loved reading all the excellent reviews of this movie, and don't have much more to add.  I too first saw this back in the early 70's on the late show, and it immediately became one of my favorite movies.  I'm glad it is finally on DVD, but wish there were more special features.To those unaware, the 70's tv movie 'Born Innocent' (starring Linda Blair as a young innocent girl thrown into the harsh juvenille system) is a remake of 'Caged'.  It was considered very controversial when it was shown (and it was banned after its first showing) because it was blunt when it came to the topic of lesbianism, and because of a brutal rape scene.  Of course, the 1950's 'Caged' could only imply of lesbianism (""Think it over sweetie, and get this through your head. If you stay in here too long, you don't think of guys at all.  You just get out of the habit"".  Even Elvira Powell--who smiles suggestively at the young, pretty Marie as she asks ""What's your name?  How'd you hurt your hand?""--was supposed to only be interested in Marie because she wanted her to join her gang).Great movie!!

1063950,A1UG6WRMB4I50K,B000OHZJG4,Edward,"[2, 2]","The sadistic head matron Evelyn Harper doesn't care how many times she is suspended. She pulls a few strings with her friends on the prison administration board and always gets her job back.Newly married 19 year old Marie Allen is found guilty of being involved in an armed robbery pulled off by her husband.  For this, she received a sentence of 1 to 15 years in the woman's state prison.  Marie has no previous criminal convictions and is naive to prison life.  On top of that, she finds out she is pregnant during the prison medical examination.  Life quickly becomes difficult for her in prison.  The kinder warden Mrs. Benton tries to make things easy for the pregnant Marie giving her an easy job in the laundry.  The sadistic matron Evelyn Harper has no mercy for Marie as quickly overrides Mrs. Benton and assigns Marie to scrub floors on her hands and knees.When Marie gives birth she wants her mother to take the baby, but her step father wants nothing to do with her.  The mother is forced to side with her husband due to her age, health, and financial reasons.  The baby is born in prison but taken away from Marie.Along with the complications of her personal life, Marie is targeted by the Queen Bee, Kitty Stark as a candidate for a booster (shoplifter).  Marie declines all of these offers and makes it clear that she is not going to become involved in such activities.  Meanwhile, Kitty's worst enemy, Elvira Powell, an even more influential Queen Bee is imprisoned and tries her hand at Marie.  Once again, Marie sticks to her position and refuses Powell's offers.As her time in prison goes by, the naive Marie turns into a more callous inmate.  Some of this is due to her involvement in a prison riot, shaving of her hair to a buzz cut by Harper, and solitary confinement.Maries only goal in prison is to be paroled, but to have this happen, she needs to have a job in place before her release.  Someone makes this happen for her, but you will have to watch Caged! for yourself to find this out.Caged! is from 1950 and is a really great movie that is full of great old time actresses.  These include a young Agnes Moorehead, Ellen Corby, and Jane Darwell just to name a few.  It's a fast moving movie that is worth watching many times.

1063951,A315I4RKNVTUYJ,B000OHZJG4,"Harlem Champ ""Harlem Champ""","[1, 1]","I first saw Eleanor Parker in the powerful ""Detective Story"" with Kirk Douglas. After seeing her in a few more films, like ""Man with the Golden Arm"" (another brilliant film) i deemed her as a pretty""good"" actress, even though she always seemed to play a fragile character...or maybe it was her deer-eyed look that created my perception of her as typecast.In this film Eleanor shattered that perception and proved to me she was a great and versatile actor. I wasn't sure how strong or convincing her characters transformation would be from the wide eyed innocent to a seasoned con.. but it happened and when she crossed over into that cold world, (as 95% of inmates do after doing time) she was brilliant, a Ms. Parker i've never seen before.Caged blew my mind. Perhaps one of the most emotional prison films i have ever seen.  Who would have thought that a film made in 1950 could contain such overt actualities about women in prison; sexuality,  hard-knocks, the systematic failure of Amerikkkan penal institutions, and the cycle of crime that they nurture. There were moments in this film, both subtle and in your face that made me uncomfortable.The faces of the actresses captured on film were stark and powerful, of course partially credited to the Directors close-ups of them and also the group shots of the women, but more so these intense actresses faces, some whom i have seen in films before, others not.. but this film was filled with faces of women who could have surely been stars. This is a brilliant example of acting carrying you through a film, no special effects or CGI. The black and white tone captured the pain and emotion of the convicts.. and the superb camera angles, close ups, pan-outs and wide shots were amazing, praises to the Director, those who did the lighting and whoever else participated in the creation of the atmosphere.This film reminded me of many of the downtrodden, scarred women i have seen and known in my life, minus those who were Black and Latino women which were absent in this film for some odd reason especially since Warner was known for having black actors and extras in their films since the 40's. But regardless of that flaw of the film people of any color or walk of life will be able to connect to these women, and when looking deeply into the characters we forget about them being solely white women, we just see human pain. At times just the looks on their faces almost brought me to tears, honestly.Caged was brilliantly directed, acted and written. Every single woman's performance in this film was stunning, even those who had only one or two lines. This is NOT what the front of this  DVD states as a ""Cult-camp"" classic...emphatically not, this is a powerful film that upon viewing for my first time today moves to the top of my collection.See this film.

1063952,A1YJ2M23KYI2X7,B000OHZJG4,"Hernando DeSoto ""Hernando""","[1, 2]","SPOILER ALERT! This is a very old film and fans of this film are familiar with the plot, so I don't think there's any harm done by commenting on it.The Title of this review is a line of dialogue spoken by Marie Allen near the end of the film just after Evil Prison Matron Evelyn Harper is ""Forked: to death.This has been boxed as a CULT CAMP CLASSIC?Really? Well, If you say so, I guess it is a cult film. So is SUNSET BOULEVARD. ALL ABOUT EVE? WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? Unfortunately, WB has boxed it as a CULT CAMP CLASSIC along with TROG and a forgotten Lana Turner film, neither of which is in the same league as this film.CAMP? Well, how could it not be with some of the finest character actresses of Hollywood's Golden Era playing assorted thieves, prostitutes, murderesses and madames, some with same-sex tendencies. Remember, these were the Eisenhower years.CLASSIC? Yes. This was certainly not the first women's prison melodrama ever made but it is far and away the best, having been parodied in REFORM SCHOOL GIRLS and WOMEN BEHIND BARS. Carol Burnett even spoofed this picture on her show. CAGED remains the best film of its kind ever madeJohn Cromwell, you may remember, directed Bette Davis in OF HUMAN BONDAGE and here he directs ELEANOR PARKER to an Academy Award Nominated performance in the best script she was ever handed, written by the legendary Virginia Kellog. His style here is Film Noir, dark and claustrophobic.ELEANOR PARKER plays 19 year-old Marie Allen, a terrified young woman whose only real crime was being poor and falling in love with a desperate young man. With no money and nowhere to go, and unbeknownst to Marie who waits in the car, he attempts to hold up a gas station. He is dead before this film begins. Marie has fallen through the cracks of an insensitive system. Will she ever escape her CAGE? Marie relates this story to a prison matron doing intake.HOPE EMERSON is the prototypical tough prison matron here just the way that Margaret Hamilton was the prototypical Wicked Witch. Hope is the ""Woman you love to hate"" and HOPE also was Oscar Nominated. Not too long ago, a noted gay writer appeared on TCM with Robert Osborne and described Hope's character, Evelyn Harper as a ""Lesbian"". What nonsense. One scene shows Evelyn going out on a date, dressed up for the evening, looking like the world's frumpiest drag queen. She stops by the women's cell block to ""rub it in"" and says ""The guy I'm goin' out with has a room over the garage where he works"". JAN STERLING quips ""If that's what dames are wearin' these days, I'm glad I'm in here"". Evelyn Harper is a Sadist and an opportunist looking to feather her nest at the expense of the prisoners and taking pleasure in torturing them. She's just a Brute.AGNES MOOREHEAD plays the prison warden, a woman of good and noble intent trying vaiantly and against impossible odds and corruption to change the system for the better. When did Agnes not give a great perfomance?The Under-appreciated LEE PATRICK (The Maltese Falcon, Now Voyager, In This Our Life) plays a Madam hiding in plain sight in the prison so that she won't have to testify against the mob big-shots that support her. She has eyes for young Marie. This is a daring portrayal for its day and age. Lee deserved an AA nomination, too.BETTY GARDE (Remember her from the Classic Twilight Zone Episode THE MIDNIGHT SUN (with Lois Nettleton)? Here, she is Queen Bee of the inmates at the beginning of the picture until she is displaced and degraded.GERTRUDE HOFFMAN (""Mrs. O'Detts on My Little Margie"") is great as a ""Lifer"" doomed to live out her days in prison.ELLEN CORBY (""The Waltons"") is comic relief (with the highest billing I have ever seen her get) as a woman who has shot her abusive husband to death. ""It's all the judges' fault I'm here. He should have stopped me last time when I only winged the guy"".OLIVE DEERING delivers one of her usual excellent performances as a woman who is ""flopped back"" one too many times with tragic results.JAN STERLING is a ""C.P."" (Common Prostitute). Interestingly, JAN would also appear in ""WOMEN'S PRISON"" with Ida Lupino a few years later. I guess Some women never learn.CAGED is an indictment of the Prison System as something corrupt, dangerous and devoid of rehabilitation. It is filled with unforgettable performances, snappy dialogue and tense situations.

Eleanor Parker is AWFUL (as she was in just about everything) but here she ""acts"" with a capital ""A!""  Unbelievably, she got an Oscar nomination, but I guess that was pretty much par for the course back then for glamorous stars who a) played mute (Jane Wyman), b) played prostitutes (Shirley Jones) or c) shaved their heads (Parker).Parker's tranformation from innocent good girl to hardened criminal is heavy handed, remarkably fast, totally unnuanced and hysterically funny!Don't miss this ""so bad it's good"" classic!UPDATE 02/02/13: In defference to comments made on the above review, I recorded ""Caged"" off of TCM and gave it another shot. I must admit that the film itself is better than I remembered it being -- it does have a few effective moments, due largely to a really fine supporting cast. But my opinion of Parker's performance remained unchanged.

She delivers a complex and memorable performance as a young, pregnant prison inmate. Her Oscar competition in 1950 was staggering: Gloria Swanson for Sunset Boulevard, Bette Davis and Anne Baxter for All About Eve and the winner, Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. Agnes Moorehead does an excellent job as a sympathetic but ineffectual warden, but the performance you will never forget goes to Oscar-nominated Hope Emerson, who dominates every one of her scenes as the cruel and sadistic prison matron. Lee Patrick appears as the a wealthy and influential prison inmate lusting for the Eleanor Parker character. Betty Garde, Jan Sterling, Gertrude Michael, Ellen Corby, Olive Deering and Jane Darwell are excellent in supporting roles.

Little did I know then how much I would come to love this movie and to make it one of my favorites years later. The acting is stellar. Eleanor Parker plays Marie Allen, a scared 19 year old woman expecting a child who has never had a police record before. She learns quite a lot about being incarcerated within a few months. Agnes Moorehead's performance as Mrs. Ruth Benton, the superintendent of the women's prison, is fabulous (Agnes would be on Bewitched 14 years later). Mrs. Benton is very warm, cordial, and willing to help Marie out. Hope Emerson plays Evelyn Harper, the mean spirited, harsh, and hostile matron who rules her group of women with an excess amount of strictness as well as an iron fist. I am so glad to see that this movie is finally out on DVD, though it should have been released much sooner, but, better late than never. There aren't much for special features, except for the trailer, which is a nice addition to the DVD, as well as subtitles. The quality of the audio and video is sharp and clear. The dialog is excellent, and there is some comedy and drama mixed together, and yes, there are some moments that are disturbing to the casual viewer. Highly recommended for anyone who is into older films from the 40s and 50s. Now that this movie is on DVD, there is no need to wait around for it to come on TV anymore. Get this movie on DVD and toss out the old VHS that you recorded sometime ago. A++!!!UPDATE: I just found out a short while back that this movie has been discontinued on DVD.

This 1950 film makes no attempt to obscure its social agenda, which is to promote an overhaul of the American prison system, a system which the filmmakers felt created and protected criminality as much as it punished it. To this end, we visit a women's prison, where a clean-cut, pleasant young woman who made one mistake will be compelled by circumstances to embrace a life of crime. Corruption, physical abuse, and the mixing of first offenders with hardened criminals are the ills that infect the prison and victimize inmates who might otherwise go straight.19-year-old Marie Allen (Eleanor Parker) has been convicted as an accessory in an ill-fated hold-up that left her husband dead. Delicate, scrupulously polite, pregnant, and terrified, Marie arrives at the State Women's Prison to serve her time. The progressive prison Superintendent Ruth Benton (Agnes Moorehead) is sympathetic to the plight of first offenders but struggles constantly just to obtain adequate funding to run the facility. Marie is placed under the authority of sadistic, corrupt prison matron Harper (Hope Emerson), who keeps her job through political connections. Marie is determined not to misstep and be paroled in 10 months, but everything and everyone work against her.We never lose sight of the fact that Marie is ""caged"" -by bars and walls, and by corruption, selfishness, and misguided paternalism. The claustrophobia, noise, and humiliation of the prison environment are present in every scene. I don't know how widespread the behavior in ""Caged"" was in American prisons circa 1950. But it's interesting that the film doesn't only attack the obvious sources of trouble -corruption and political apathy - but also condemns the self-righteous, well-meaning parole board, who deem the horrible prison environment preferable to freedom for a young woman with ""no favorable home conditions and no beneficent influences on the outside."" Accurate or not, ""Caged"" is very hard-hitting and presents Marie's loss of autonomy with frightening empathy.The DVD (Warner 2007): Picture and sound quality are good.

The brutality of prison life will change her life forever.

It is grim from start to finish, I don't understand why it is called a ""camp classic"", this film is far from camp.  When Harper shaves Marie's hair off for punishment, and physically pushes her into the solitary cell, that is not camp by a long shot.  That scene alone in itself, was very shocking and anyone who thought that was camp needs help! In one of Eleanor Parkers early interviews, she stated that it was her real hair being shaved off, and after the scene was done, it took her awhile to feel normal again, as she was so into the role. She remarked on how everyone got along so well with one another.  She said Hope Emerson was such a wonderful woman, how they would all gather around the piano and sing songs. I enjoyed the scene where Harper is in her room, she kicks the radiator because her room is so cold, she goes and reaches underneath her mattress, and pulls out a bottle of booze.  She takes a swig, and places it back underneath the mattress.  The bell rings and she steps outside to turn on the lights in the bullpen, and she yells, ""Pile out you tramps, this ain't no upstairs delicatessan, time for count!!!!"" One scene, when the women go to chow, and are standing in front of their food at their eating tables, Harper blows a whistle for them to sit down, and another whistle blow for them to start eating.

A good blooper in the film is when after the riot in the bullpen over a cat, Marie holds the cat and says ""its dead"" and you can see the cat still moving (wonder if they sedated it)  In the 80's this film was remade as ""Reform School Girls"" the similarities are amazing, including the new ""Harper"".

For one, her mother and stepfather put a nail in the coffin by not taking her young son that was born in prison, and then not allowing her to come home to start fresh. I believe if she did, she could have had a better support team and became more productive. To be honest, they only threw the book at her because the husband died in the robbery and she drove the car albeit reluctantly. Then she ends up in prison, folks calling her a tramp, disregarding her multiple times even though she's pregnant and dumb and she looks like a deer caught in the headlights don't help. but in spite of that, the ladies there were good and kind to her. The matron over them Harper(Hope Emerson)was a self centered, trifliing, ineffective, matron who only dealt with you only to take care of herself. Agnes Moorehead was Mrs Benton, the warden, who was more caring but since she had to deal with Harper and couldn't get her fired due to her political connections. She tried tooth and nail to get the things she needed in the prison but all she got was major arguments as to why they should keep Harper and a whole bunch of double talk that don't do nothing. So...nothing is solved. When Parker goes up for her parole, trying to keep straight and because her parents wouldn't take her back, they deny her parole even though she went through some harsh stuff while in prison and Benton spoke up on her behalf. When the lifer, Millie, who don't even speak up much because she's in bed and don't have much to say to folks, when she spoke up and told her when she was up for parole once again what she should do and play it straight,at the same time,she happened to see a bunch of ladies in fur coats passing through, and one lady looked at her and she back at the woman and she went straight to the other lady,Kitty(Lee Patrick) who was treating the ladies with cute gifts and such and hooked up with her. And she gets hard and this time makes parole, and even though Benton spoke to her and begged her to see to reason and play it safe, she sticks with Kitty and her guys, goes out of the prison, walks to the car where the men bring her in and one of them openly feel up on her while going in the car and they pull off.",4,might be low key but it packs a punch,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,2397,"['**SPOILER', 'ALERT***I', 'saw', 'movie', 'once', 'years', 'back', 'never', 'forgot', 'why', 'because', 'young', 'lady', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'break', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'folks', 'telling', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'one', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'put', 'nail', 'coffin', 'not', 'taking', 'young', 'son', 'was', 'born', 'prison', 'then', 'not', 'allowing', 'come', 'home', 'start', 'fresh', 'believe', 'did', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'support', 'team', 'became', 'more', 'productive', 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'threw', 'book', 'husband', 'died', 'robbery', 'drove', 'car', 'albeit', 'reluctantly', 'Then', 'up', 'prison', 'folks', 'calling', 'tramp', 'disregarding', 'multiple', 'times', 'even', 'pregnant', 'dumb', 'deer', 'caught', 'headlights', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'spite', 'ladies', 'were', 'good', 'kind', 'matron', 'Harper', 'Hope', 'Emerson', 'was', 'self', 'centered', 'trifliing', 'ineffective', 'matron', 'who', 'only', 'only', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'was', 'Mrs', 'Benton', 'warden', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'caring', 'had', 'deal', 'Harper', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'fired', 'due', 'political', 'connections', 'tried', 'tooth', 'nail', 'get', 'things', 'needed', 'prison', 'got', 'was', 'major', 'arguments', 'why', 'should', 'keep', 'Harper', 'whole', 'bunch', 'double', 'talk', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'nothing', 'nothing', 'solved', 'When', 'Parker', 'up', 'parole', 'trying', 'keep', 'straight', 'parents', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'back', 'deny', 'parole', 'even', 'went', 'harsh', 'stuff', 'prison', 'Benton', 'spoke', 'up', 'behalf', 'When', 'lifer', 'Millie', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'up', 'much', 'bed', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'folks', 'when', 'spoke', 'up', 'told', 'when', 'was', 'up', 'parole', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'play', 'straight', 'same', 'time', 'happened', 'see', 'bunch', 'ladies', 'fur', 'coats', 'passing', 'one', 'lady', 'looked', 'back', 'woman', 'went', 'straight', 'other', 'lady', 'Kitty', 'Lee', 'Patrick', 'who', 'was', 'treating', 'ladies', 'cute', 'gifts', 'such', 'hooked', 'up', 'hard', 'time', 'parole', 'even', 'Benton', 'spoke', 'begged', 'see', 'reason', 'play', 'safe', 'Kitty', 'guys', 'prison', 'walks', 'car', 'where', 'men', 'bring', 'one', 'openly', 'feel', 'up', 'going', 'car', 'pull', 'off']",Caged!
1063967,A2U974OZOVRT7A,B000OHZJG4,Tom Without Pity,"[3, 4]","This is a review for the WB film  CAGED! (1951) directed by John Cromwell, a film concering Marie Allen,played by Eleanor Parker. Marie is  a nineteen year old sentenced to do time for helping her late husband in a small time armed robbery. The husband is killed and Marie is left holding the bag, sentenced to a woman's prison for convicted felons, all of them seemingly much more experienced and hardened than she is.  Marie also discovers that she is pregnant and has to have her baby behind bars, a less than ideal circumstance.As Marie learns her way around the prison and meets the inmates, we see through her eyes the various social rankings among the population and also learn about the matrons and officials, which ones are decent people and which ones are not. Most notably among the prison matrons is Harper, played by Hope Emerson, a giant of a woman who's disposition towards an inmate depends on how much the inmate can share with her, be it either status or money.  Like in many other corrupt  government and business situations, the fix is in if you can afford it. The warden, played by Agnes Moorehead and her cohorts seem to be decent but ineffective sorts who have lost control of the more aggresive Harper.But eventually Harper oversteps her bounds and has a former big wheel inmate, Kitty Stark played by Betty Garde,  beaten to a pulp thus displeasing the new Queen of the cellblock,  vice queen Elvira Powell played by Lee Patrick.  Eventually, during a lights out riot, Harper is stabbed to death by Kitty Stark who winds up on death row although there is little sympathy expressed by anyone for the late Matron Harper, and deservedly so.Finally, after one rejection at a parole hearing and fearing she'll never get out of prison without pull, Marie Allen joins up with vice queen Elvira Powell and has her way out of prison greased by the fixers, but we see the price Marie will have to pay when she's met at the prison doors by a couple of smooth talking types who say they will treat her right.After Marie walks out the prison doors, the warden tells a clerk to keep Marie's file active, she'll be back.CAGED! seems to be saying that it doesn't matter what you do after you go to prison, your path is set by either the government or the  organized  crime outfits if they think they have a use for you.CAGED! is a really well done film, believable from beginning to end.  A great cast, practically all women and all of them up to their roles.  A movie you will watch more than once.I give CAGED!

1063968,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000OHZJG4,Westley,"[1, 1]","Eleanor Parker stars as Marie Allen in 1950's ""Caged.""  Marie comes from a poor family but never had trouble with the law; however, she married young and her husband, in an act of desperation, holds up a gas station for $40.  Her husband is killed in the robbery, and Marie, who drove the getaway car, is given 1-15 years in prison.  When she arrives at the prison, she's a naive scared 19-year-old girl.  When she leaves, she's a hardened woman who is likely to become a repeat offender.  What happens in between makes up the bulk of the plot, as the women react to being ""caged.""By today's standards, ""Caged"" is pretty tame, verging on unrealistic; however, for a 1950s movie, ""Caged"" is remarkably gritty, and it's often considered to be the granddaddy of women's prison movies.  Fortunately, the movie also provides very good character sketches of the different women in Marie's prison block.  The acting is uniformly good, with Parker scoring her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.  Her progression from innocent waif to bitter criminal is quite believable and effective.  Hope Emerson also received an Academy Award nomination for her supporting turn as Evelyn Harper, the scheming prison matron who taunts the women.  Ellen Corby (probably best known as Grandma Walton) has fun in her role as a shifty murderess.  The film also features Agnes Moorehead as the sympathetic superintendant; I usually love Moorehead, but she's a tad boring here.The women in prison genre has been done many times since ""Caged,"" often in a more sensationalistic style.  Nevertheless, the movie is interesting and well worth watching.  Some of the lines are great fun.  Hope Emerson's matron character has some of the best, including when she tells the cell block, ""Line up, you tramps.  This ain't no upstairs delicatessen.""  I also laughed out loud when Marie says at the death of one of the characters, ""Kindly omit the flowers.""

1063969,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B000OHZJG4,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[3, 3]","It's difficult to praise this film more than it's been by other reviewers, but I think I can add something I suspect most people don't catch.Though ""Caged"" is, in the great Warners tradition, an attack on ""the system"" that corrupts (more or less) innocent people who deserve better, it is important to note /why/ Parker's character, who's been trying to maintain her innocence through most of the film, even as she's hardening, moves over to a life of crime. It occurs when she gazes at a young, wealthy woman taking a tour of the prison. The woman is wearing beautiful jewelry and a deluxe fur coat. We see in that moment her lust for material things that even a warning from the oldest woman in the prison -- a murderer who's wasted forty years of her life for nothing, and would rather be cleaning dirty dishes than being locked in a prison -- cannot undo. In short, though she has been unjustly brutalized, Parker's character ultimately /chooses/ to be a criminal, because of an overwhelming desire for the things that society says are the mark of ""success"".The final scene is particularly effective, with a wise-ass Parker getting into a car full of gangsters, the sudden confusion and fear on her face revealing that she knows she might not have made the best choice.Unlike most of the other films in this four-box series, ""Caged"" has no running commentary, though it deserves one.
