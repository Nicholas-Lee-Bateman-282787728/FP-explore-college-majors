1537999,ADEVBXUS0RSIR,B007TWKH50,"Alain B. Burrese ""Author, Speaker, Mediator, ...","[15, 15]","""Facing Violence: 7 Things Every Martial Artist Must Know"" with Rory Miller is not a program full of techniques.  Nor will it enable you to take out 27 ninjas that jump you in a back alley.  (First, ask yourself what the heck are you doing in an alley with 27 ninjas out to do you harm?)  The DVD won't necessarily make you a better fighter, and it certainly isn't a ""Self-defense curriculum"" or the ""Ultimate Self-defense"" program.  So why watch this DVD?  What will you get from it?First, you'll get a lot if you pay attention, think about what Miller discusses, and implement his ideas into your overall self-defense strategies and training.  Second, watch this DVD because Miller knows what he's talking about and addresses a lot of things that aren't mentioned in most self-defense and martial art training DVDs.This DVD is a companion to Miller's book of the same title.  Both the DVD and the book ""Facing violence"" cover seven important things any martial artist or person wanting to know about self-defense must consider when dealing with real fights, real attacks and real violence.  These seven areas are: 1) Legal and ethical implications  2) Violence dynamics  3) Avoidance  4) Counter-ambush  5) Breaking the freeze  6) The fight itself  7) The aftermath.Much of the DVD is lecture format.  Some of the material is better in written form, such as the legal considerations, so Miller doesn't go into as much depth here.  Miller has a group that he teaches to, and they interact with Miller, and thus is makes this DVD more like being in a live seminar with Miller.  In fact, Miller does teach these seminars.  At times, it takes on the appearance of a live program and not the rehearsed ""DVD programs"" that many of us are used to.I hope that some won't become bored with some of the lecture format and talking.  Again, as I mentioned, there is much more talking and lecture than action and techniques.  But this stuff is important!  You need to listen to this.  You need to pay attention.  And you need to let these lessons sink in to help you be better prepared to face actual violence.Miller is not the most polished or dynamic speaker.  You'll hear some ums and ahs, and you'll hear some profanity.  He's not real animated and his voice is rather quiet.  However, what he does have is a lot of hard-won knowledge that he shares honestly.  He sincerely delivers the information in this program to help people avoid if possible, and survive if necessary, when dealing with the real-word violence found in today's streets.No, this isn't the normal self-defense DVD, it's something different.  It's a program I strongly recommend people watch and learn from to help with their martial art and self-defense training.  If you are a self-defense instructor, you must be including these seven areas in your teaching.  If you aren't, you are doing a disservice to your students.  This DVD, together with the book of the same name, you'll be much better prepared to face real violence, and you'll be a much better self-defense instructor.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, author of the 2 Disc self-defense DVD ""Streetfighting Essentials.""",5,Important information for all self-defense instructors and anyone else training for self-defense,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,3136,"['Facing', 'Violence', '7', 'Things', 'Every', 'Martial', 'Artist', 'Must', 'Know', 'Rory', 'Miller', 'not', 'program', 'full', 'techniques', 'will', 'enable', 'take', 'out', '27', 'ninjas', 'jump', 'back', 'alley', 'First', 'ask', 'what', 'heck', 'are', 'doing', 'alley', '27', 'ninjas', 'do', 'harm', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'better', 'fighter', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Self-defense', 'curriculum', 'Ultimate', 'Self-defense', 'program', 'So', 'why', 'watch', 'DVD', 'What', 'will', 'get', 'First', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lot', 'pay', 'attention', 'think', 'what', 'Miller', 'implement', 'ideas', 'overall', 'self-defense', 'strategies', 'training', 'Second', 'watch', 'DVD', 'Miller', 'what', 'talking', 'lot', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'most', 'self-defense', 'martial', 'art', 'training', 'DVDs.This', 'DVD', 'companion', 'Miller', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'DVD', 'book', 'Facing', 'violence', 'cover', 'seven', 'important', 'things', 'martial', 'artist', 'person', 'wanting', 'know', 'self-defense', 'must', 'consider', 'when', 'dealing', 'real', 'fights', 'real', 'attacks', 'real', 'violence', 'seven', 'areas', 'are', '1', 'Legal', 'ethical', 'implications', '2', 'Violence', 'dynamics', '3', 'Avoidance', '4', 'Counter-ambush', '5', 'Breaking', 'freeze', '6', 'fight', '7', 'aftermath.Much', 'DVD', 'lecture', 'format', 'material', 'better', 'written', 'form', 'such', 'legal', 'considerations', 'so', 'Miller', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'much', 'depth', 'here', 'Miller', 'group', 'interact', 'Miller', 'thus', 'DVD', 'more', 'being', 'live', 'seminar', 'Miller', 'fact', 'Miller', 'teach', 'seminars', 'times', 'appearance', 'live', 'program', 'not', 'rehearsed', 'DVD', 'programs', 'many', 'are', 'used', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'become', 'bored', 'lecture', 'format', 'talking', 'Again', 'mentioned', 'much', 'more', 'talking', 'lecture', 'action', 'techniques', 'stuff', 'important', 'need', 'listen', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'need', 'let', 'lessons', 'sink', 'help', 'be', 'better', 'prepared', 'face', 'actual', 'violence.Miller', 'not', 'most', 'polished', 'dynamic', 'speaker', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'ums', 'ahs', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'profanity', 'not', 'real', 'animated', 'voice', 'rather', 'quiet', 'However', 'what', 'have', 'lot', 'hard-won', 'knowledge', 'shares', 'honestly', 'sincerely', 'information', 'program', 'help', 'people', 'avoid', 'possible', 'survive', 'necessary', 'when', 'dealing', 'real-word', 'violence', 'found', 'today', 'streets.No', ""n't"", 'normal', 'self-defense', 'DVD', 'something', 'different', 'program', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'people', 'watch', 'learn', 'help', 'martial', 'art', 'self-defense', 'training', 'are', 'self-defense', 'instructor', 'must', 'be', 'including', 'seven', 'areas', 'teaching', 'are', ""n't"", 'are', 'doing', 'disservice', 'students', 'DVD', 'together', 'book', 'same', 'name', ""'ll"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'prepared', 'face', 'real', 'violence', ""'ll"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'self-defense', 'instructor.Reviewed', 'Alain', 'Burrese', 'author', '2', 'Disc', 'self-defense', 'DVD', 'Streetfighting', 'Essentials']",Facing Violence

1538001,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B007TWKH50,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[1, 1]","""Facing Violence"" is a very good guide to preparing for all aspects of a violent encounter, not just the physical aspects but also the ethical, legal, and even emotional fallout. The instructor, Rory Miller, is an experienced Corrections Officer and martial artist, and it is very clear that he is not a stranger to the judicious use of force in his career working in the prison system.First of all, it is important to know that this is not a purely action centric fighting video. To be sure, there is plenty of training and fighting instruction but there is also a lot of lecture based instruction that imparts very good information that goes above and beyond ""how to fight"", but it does come across somewhat dry. The video is divided into sections covering ""Legal and ethical implications"", ""Violence dynamics"", ""Avoidance"" (usually the best option), ""Counter-ambush"", ""Breaking the freeze"" (the mental freeze before acting), ""The fight itself"", and ""The aftermath"". The slow motion training and parts of the fight practice sections were new to me and will be integrated into my training sessions.It should be noted that even though this DVD is great on its own, you will get more out of it by reading the companion bookFacing Violence: Preparing for the Unexpected, since it is referenced throughout the video.

Einbinder ""dutchman59""","[2, 2]","Facing Violence by Rory Miller demonstrates real-life scenarios where a person can get caught in a fight and the consequences that comes along with that. The DVD teaches how to defend oneself and more importantly how to try to avoid these situations.Rory explains how knowing Martial Arts will not necessarily help in actual street or bar fighting. The explanation is simple that in practice, one learns to hold back in hitting someone. This might cause the person involved in a fight to automatically hold his strike. The essence of this is to not go into a fight merely because you are a trained martial artist.He also explains the consequences in the aftermath of a fight where there may be legal or civil actions taken against you. This can become costly and even with legal charges pressed against you, even without being the instigator of the fight. Neither is a very good situation to find yourself.Rory tells how actual events can happen anywhere, such as a bar, a school, in the street. This DVD demonstrates what could happen, how to react and how to survive both physically and legally.I highly recommend this DVD for being informative, instructional and passing on good commons sense regarding street fighting. The seven chapters are clearly presented, have a lot of information and the demonstrations are very life-like.This DVD is highly recommended for just about anyone's viewing with the admonition to practice avoidance more than anything else.

Everyone who has ever done martial arts training and thinks it might be useful as self defense needs to watch this.This DVD is about the transition from martial arts training to being prepared mentally and physically for real world self defense. The dojo is a safe place to practice. The bar or street can be a completely different environment. In the dojo you train with people who are helping you improve technique without getting injured. In the bar or street you encounter people who want to hurt you, steal from you, cripple you. Different places and different approaches are needed if you want to survive.Rory Miller will show you why the techniques you have learned in the dojo are not going to protect you. For example, he has participants demonstrate a standard martial arts knife defense. Then he shows you why they will not work if you get ambushed by someone who wants to hurt you and who hides the knife behind their back until they are 6 inches from you. You have to learn how the bad guys think and act.He also talks to you about how to deal with the police and the legal system after you have ""won"". Here is a hint: the bad guys will often claim that you attacked them. The police will often assume that the person who is standing at the end of the fight (hopefully you) is the criminal who initiated it. Even if you are not charged in a crimal court, you also have to be prepared to be sued in cival court to pay the expenses and damages suffered by the person who actually attacked you. Just because you won the fight does not mean that you have survived financially. He also talks about the medical consequences of your fight and the physical and mental therapy you may need to recover.Most martial arts training involve what can best be described as ""training exercise techniques"" that are designed to build your fitness levels and teach your muscles how to do certain techniques. You block, then move and then counter attack. Too slow. You need to proactice single step techniques that combine the 3 steps into a single move. The exercise techniques are not even used after you get a black belt level and do free fighting exercises. They are strong. But too slow so you abbreviate them. Rory Miller describes the different approaches needed to survive violence in the real world.Having praised the DVD, I have to mention some of the limitiations. First, it is just too shor to completely cover the subject. Several times he tells you to go read his book for more information. I am going to do that next. Finally, while he does tell you to develop and practice a single reflex technique that will give you a few seconds if you are ambushed, none of the reflex techniques he suggests would have protected you from that guy with hidden knife.",5,This is for everyone who has trained in the martial arts,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2883,"['Very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'not', 'perfect', '2', 'hours', 'instruction', 'demonstations', 'practice', 'ideas', 'Everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'done', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'might', 'be', 'useful', 'self', 'defense', 'watch', 'this.This', 'DVD', 'transition', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'being', 'prepared', 'mentally', 'physically', 'real', 'world', 'self', 'defense', 'dojo', 'safe', 'place', 'practice', 'bar', 'street', 'can', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'environment', 'dojo', 'train', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'helping', 'improve', 'technique', 'getting', 'injured', 'bar', 'street', 'encounter', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'hurt', 'steal', 'cripple', 'Different', 'places', 'different', 'approaches', 'are', 'needed', 'want', 'survive.Rory', 'Miller', 'will', 'show', 'why', 'techniques', 'have', 'learned', 'dojo', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'protect', 'example', 'participants', 'demonstrate', 'standard', 'martial', 'arts', 'knife', 'defense', 'Then', 'why', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'get', 'ambushed', 'someone', 'who', 'hurt', 'who', 'knife', 'back', 'are', '6', 'inches', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'bad', 'guys', 'think', 'act.He', 'also', 'talks', 'how', 'deal', 'police', 'legal', 'system', 'have', 'won', 'Here', 'hint', 'bad', 'guys', 'will', 'often', 'claim', 'attacked', 'police', 'will', 'often', 'assume', 'person', 'who', 'standing', 'end', 'fight', 'hopefully', 'criminal', 'who', 'initiated', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'charged', 'crimal', 'court', 'also', 'have', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'sued', 'cival', 'court', 'pay', 'expenses', 'damages', 'suffered', 'person', 'who', 'actually', 'attacked', 'Just', 'won', 'fight', 'not', 'mean', 'have', 'survived', 'financially', 'also', 'medical', 'consequences', 'fight', 'physical', 'mental', 'therapy', 'may', 'need', 'recover.Most', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'involve', 'what', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'training', 'exercise', 'techniques', 'are', 'designed', 'build', 'fitness', 'levels', 'teach', 'muscles', 'how', 'do', 'certain', 'techniques', 'block', 'then', 'move', 'then', 'counter', 'attack', 'Too', 'slow', 'need', 'proactice', 'single', 'step', 'techniques', 'combine', '3', 'steps', 'single', 'move', 'exercise', 'techniques', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'used', 'get', 'black', 'belt', 'level', 'do', 'free', 'fighting', 'exercises', 'are', 'strong', 'too', 'slow', 'abbreviate', 'Rory', 'Miller', 'different', 'approaches', 'needed', 'survive', 'violence', 'real', 'world.Having', 'praised', 'DVD', 'have', 'mention', 'limitiations', 'First', 'just', 'too', 'shor', 'completely', 'cover', 'subject', 'Several', 'times', 'go', 'read', 'book', 'more', 'information', 'am', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'Finally', 'tell', 'develop', 'practice', 'single', 'reflex', 'technique', 'will', 'give', 'few', 'seconds', 'are', 'ambushed', 'none', 'reflex', 'would', 'have', 'protected', 'guy', 'hidden', 'knife']",Facing Violence

1538009,AEE52GO98PFOL,B007TWKH50,Tyr Shadowblade (TM),"[17, 17]","Although there is also a book of the same title, this DVD discusses certain topics in great detail which the book only touches upon, and as this information is extremely valuable it is important that you get the DVD in addition to the book.One of those topics is ""articulation wars,"" in which Rory gives several examples of how important it is to watch what you say to responding officers immediately after the incident.  Massad Ayoob and a few other instructors have addressed this topic in the past, but never in such detail nor from such a realistic and relevant perspective.  The most important things you need to know are: 1. Officer Friendly is not ""on your side""; and 2. If your attacker is an experienced criminal he will know the magic words and linguistic tricks that will paint himself as an innocent victim and you as the aggressor.  These are facts, and very few instructors talk about it because, to be perfectly frank, most instructors have never actually been in that situation since very few have ever been in an actual fight outside of training.  Fighting is a complex thing which does not end with the physical altercation.  Nope.  When Officer Friendly arrives on the scene, he doesn't know what happened and will be relying upon witness statements as well as both sides of the story . . . and an experienced criminal's story will be well rehearsed and very convincing, whereas you will likely be highly adrenalized and blurting out all sorts of damaging and potentially incriminating information that will be taken down verbatim and used as evidence against you.  The criminal will lie, as will all his friends, and they will all say the same thing: they weren't doin' nuthin' wrong and you attacked them for no reason.  Rory demonstrates how easy it is for an honest citizen to unknowingly incriminate himself simply by speaking freely to the police.  It is so important for you to meditate upon certain phrases to use in response to police questioning, as well as certain points which need to be clarified and other statements which might make it appear as if you somehow violated the law.  Surprisingly, this is one of the most important aspects of self defense as what you say at that moment will likely determine if you are going to be arrested and prosecuted . . . yet it is rarely addressed at all.Another topic is the difference between ""social violence"" which is common dominance based aggression committed by amateurs, usually over hurt feelings and drunken stupidity, which over 90% of all self defense training addresses - and ""predatory violence"" which is committed by career criminals who have practiced their technique and know exactly how they are going to strike without warning and take you out of commission instantly so they can rob you.  Very few instructors discuss predatory violence at all, because it is a scary subject as the attacks tend to be extremely brutal and very difficult to defend against as they are ambushes rather than a traditional fight.  Rory reinforces that a predatory criminal is experienced, skilled, and far more dangerous than a barroom brawler - and the attack will be completely different, and if you have no idea what to expect you will not be able to defend against it.  A predator has no intention of ""fighting"" anyone - he just wants to hurt them so badly that there will be no ""fight"" - and he is not going to square off against you like your training partner does, but will suckerpunch you and beat you repeatedly, possibly with a weapon, until you stop moving.  That is what you need to be prepared to face, not a flurry of ineffective roundhouse punches after an exchange of insults.A third topic is that of ""breaking the freeze,"" which is extremely important as, like Rory says, it happens to everyone and seems to be a hardwired natural reaction to sudden danger.  I have rarely heard anyone discuss this at all, yet it is vital.  Rory goes into great detail about different types of freezes and how to prepare for it and overcome it.Again, the DVD goes into great detail about several essential topics that were briefly addressed in the book, and it is vital that you be familiar with this material.  I have seen dozens of self defense videos and this is, by far, the best - even though it does not discuss moves or techniques at all.  Technique is secondary to proper mindset, and as Rory says, he doesn't want to teach you how to fight like him - every student needs to discover what moves feel right for them rather than copying some instructor.  Very good advice about how blindly copying technique will make you an inferior fighter, and how most common sparring methods are setting you up to fail in an actual fight.  Absolutely brilliant instruction.  Rory is the best instructor I have ever seen . . . and I have seen all the top rated guys over the past two decades.  This DVD gets my highest recommendation.",5,FACING VIOLENCE,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,4898,"['also', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'DVD', 'certain', 'topics', 'great', 'detail', 'book', 'only', 'information', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'important', 'get', 'DVD', 'addition', 'book.One', 'topics', 'articulation', 'wars', 'Rory', 'several', 'examples', 'how', 'important', 'watch', 'what', 'say', 'responding', 'officers', 'immediately', 'incident', 'Massad', 'Ayoob', 'few', 'other', 'instructors', 'have', 'addressed', 'topic', 'past', 'never', 'such', 'detail', 'such', 'realistic', 'relevant', 'perspective', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'need', 'know', 'are', '1', 'Officer', 'Friendly', 'not', 'side', '2', 'attacker', 'experienced', 'criminal', 'will', 'know', 'magic', 'words', 'linguistic', 'tricks', 'will', 'paint', 'innocent', 'victim', 'aggressor', 'are', 'facts', 'very', 'few', 'instructors', 'talk', 'because', 'be', 'perfectly', 'frank', 'most', 'instructors', 'have', 'never', 'actually', 'been', 'situation', 'very', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'actual', 'fight', 'training', 'Fighting', 'complex', 'thing', 'not', 'end', 'physical', 'altercation', 'Nope', 'When', 'Officer', 'Friendly', 'scene', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'will', 'be', 'relying', 'witness', 'statements', 'as', 'well', 'sides', 'story', 'experienced', 'criminal', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'rehearsed', 'very', 'convincing', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'highly', 'adrenalized', 'blurting', 'out', 'sorts', 'damaging', 'potentially', 'incriminating', 'information', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'down', 'verbatim', 'used', 'evidence', 'criminal', 'will', 'lie', 'will', 'all', 'friends', 'will', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'were', ""n't"", 'doin', 'nuthin', 'wrong', 'attacked', 'reason', 'Rory', 'how', 'easy', 'honest', 'citizen', 'unknowingly', 'incriminate', 'simply', 'speaking', 'freely', 'police', 'so', 'important', 'meditate', 'upon', 'certain', 'phrases', 'use', 'response', 'police', 'questioning', 'as', 'well', 'certain', 'points', 'need', 'be', 'clarified', 'other', 'statements', 'might', 'make', 'appear', 'somehow', 'violated', 'law', 'Surprisingly', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'self', 'defense', 'what', 'say', 'moment', 'will', 'likely', 'determine', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'arrested', 'prosecuted', 'rarely', 'addressed', 'topic', 'difference', 'social', 'violence', 'common', 'dominance', 'based', 'aggression', 'committed', 'amateurs', 'usually', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'drunken', 'stupidity', '90', '%', 'self', 'defense', 'training', 'predatory', 'violence', 'committed', 'career', 'criminals', 'who', 'have', 'practiced', 'technique', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'strike', 'warning', 'take', 'commission', 'instantly', 'can', 'rob', 'Very', 'few', 'instructors', 'discuss', 'predatory', 'violence', 'scary', 'subject', 'attacks', 'tend', 'be', 'extremely', 'brutal', 'very', 'difficult', 'defend', 'are', 'ambushes', 'rather', 'traditional', 'fight', 'Rory', 'predatory', 'criminal', 'experienced', 'skilled', 'far', 'more', 'dangerous', 'barroom', 'brawler', 'attack', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'defend', 'predator', 'intention', 'fighting', 'anyone', 'just', 'hurt', 'so', 'badly', 'will', 'be', 'fight', 'not', 'going', 'square', 'off', 'training', 'partner', 'will', 'suckerpunch', 'beat', 'repeatedly', 'possibly', 'weapon', 'stop', 'moving', 'what', 'need', 'be', 'prepared', 'face', 'not', 'flurry', 'ineffective', 'roundhouse', 'punches', 'exchange', 'insults.A', 'third', 'topic', 'breaking', 'freeze', 'extremely', 'important', 'Rory', 'everyone', 'be', 'hardwired', 'natural', 'reaction', 'sudden', 'danger', 'have', 'rarely', 'heard', 'anyone', 'discuss', 'vital', 'Rory', 'great', 'detail', 'different', 'types', 'freezes', 'how', 'prepare', 'overcome', 'it.Again', 'DVD', 'great', 'detail', 'several', 'essential', 'topics', 'were', 'briefly', 'addressed', 'book', 'vital', 'be', 'familiar', 'material', 'have', 'seen', 'dozens', 'self', 'defense', 'videos', 'far', 'best', 'even', 'not', 'discuss', 'moves', 'techniques', 'Technique', 'secondary', 'proper', 'mindset', 'Rory', ""n't"", 'want', 'teach', 'how', 'fight', 'student', 'discover', 'what', 'feel', 'right', 'rather', 'copying', 'instructor', 'Very', 'good', 'advice', 'how', 'blindly', 'copying', 'technique', 'will', 'make', 'inferior', 'fighter', 'how', 'most', 'common', 'sparring', 'methods', 'are', 'setting', 'fail', 'actual', 'fight', 'Absolutely', 'brilliant', 'instruction', 'Rory', 'best', 'instructor', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'seen', 'top', 'rated', 'guys', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'DVD', 'highest', 'recommendation']",Facing Violence
1538010,A1XFI340SHOS5K,B007TWKH50,Zenpony,"[4, 4]","Rory Miller makes it very clear that the quality of defending against violence is very different than training martial arts.He has very strong opinions and some strong language too. (should not be a problem for adults, but I would not play this DVD for young children.) He makes it very clear from the opening frame that violence can be unexpected and like nothing you train for in the gym or dojo. He invites a student up to introduce himself to the camera and then sucker punches him to make a point.Even before reading the book and watching the DVD, I knew in my heart that 15 years of martial arts training is still nowhere near what I need to defend myself against violence. Luckily,my little world has been fairly peaceful. Not so for many others, and we should all be prepared. You can push your thumb into an orange for practice, but can you push it through a human's eye? You would shoot an attacker raging at you with a huge butcher knife and you are cornered with no place to escape. But if that attacker were 15, or 12 or 8, or a woman, a pregnant woman, kids in the room, your kids in the room?  Mr. Miller puts a real face on violent situations.He plays out how to defend yourself in the courts after you have defended yourself against a live attack. It is an important point, maybe you survive an attack, but spend your fortune and spend years of your life in jail because a jury does not believe it was self defense.Perhaps you have trained for decades in a deadly martial arts. For decades you have pulled punches and kicks, choke holds and strikes because you do not want to injure your students or training partners. Your groin strike hits the thigh so you don't disable the groin. Now what happens in a violent situation? You have trained to miss, so your reaction is trained to miss.This DVD and the companion book clearly shows that violence is different animal and you need a different mindset to defend against it.Buy both the book and the DVD, and recommend them to your friends and students, it may save a life.",5,Violance is a different animal,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,2037,"['Rory', 'Miller', 'very', 'clear', 'quality', 'defending', 'violence', 'very', 'different', 'training', 'martial', 'arts.He', 'very', 'strong', 'opinions', 'strong', 'language', 'too', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'problem', 'adults', 'would', 'not', 'play', 'DVD', 'young', 'children', 'very', 'clear', 'opening', 'frame', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'unexpected', 'nothing', 'train', 'gym', 'dojo', 'student', 'up', 'introduce', 'camera', 'then', 'sucker', 'make', 'point.Even', 'reading', 'book', 'watching', 'DVD', 'knew', 'heart', '15', 'years', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'still', 'nowhere', 'what', 'need', 'defend', 'violence', 'Luckily', 'little', 'world', 'been', 'fairly', 'peaceful', 'Not', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'should', 'be', 'prepared', 'can', 'push', 'thumb', 'orange', 'practice', 'can', 'push', 'human', 'eye', 'would', 'shoot', 'attacker', 'raging', 'huge', 'butcher', 'knife', 'are', 'cornered', 'place', 'escape', 'attacker', 'were', '15', '12', '8', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'kids', 'room', 'kids', 'room', 'Mr.', 'Miller', 'real', 'face', 'violent', 'situations.He', 'out', 'how', 'defend', 'courts', 'have', 'defended', 'live', 'attack', 'important', 'point', 'maybe', 'survive', 'attack', 'spend', 'fortune', 'spend', 'years', 'life', 'jail', 'jury', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'defense.Perhaps', 'have', 'trained', 'decades', 'deadly', 'martial', 'arts', 'decades', 'have', 'pulled', 'punches', 'kicks', 'choke', 'strikes', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'injure', 'students', 'training', 'partners', 'groin', 'strike', 'thigh', 'do', ""n't"", 'disable', 'groin', 'Now', 'what', 'violent', 'situation', 'have', 'trained', 'miss', 'reaction', 'trained', 'miss.This', 'DVD', 'companion', 'book', 'clearly', 'violence', 'different', 'animal', 'need', 'different', 'mindset', 'defend', 'it.Buy', 'book', 'DVD', 'recommend', 'friends', 'students', 'may', 'save', 'life']",Facing Violence
