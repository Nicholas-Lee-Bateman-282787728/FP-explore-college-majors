But now that it was a movie, they were mostly based on these 4 women. I get annoyed when its all about Carrie. She has 3 other great friends that deserved more movie time. That movie was more like about Carrie, it all evolved around her. I loved the series, but the last 2 movies were all about Carrie. I loved seeing Charlotte and Samantha. But Mirandas scenes were as always...boring. Wished they showed more of the guys in the flicks. The guys who loved these women, supported them. I loved the parts not always involving Carrie. When they arrived in Abu Dahbi, Carrie makes a big deal out of Charlotte not using her Married last name. And Carrie uses ""Bradshaw""like shes supposed to be the one to use the maiden name.

But it was really clearly that they are not 30 or something anymore, so having to see this successful woman behave like crazy teens.. ahh.. I just wasn't ready for that. I always like how they were friends, and supportive of each other. After the last episode of Sex & the city, I just couldn't understand why Carrie so successful and brilliant just couldn't fit in Paris.. and why Samantha with all her sex driven just couldn't get satisfy or at least be wise enough to know that love was knocking her door and she was ready for it. The true is that you never go back to Big.. he has his time, he lose it. So yes I give it try to this movie, I enjoy the beginning, it was nice to see them together, but eventually I got tire of their behavior. They have it all, but can't get enough of it?!

1309901,A14H1F5YCUEU4J,B002ZG98Z0,Andrew Budgell,"[0, 4]","My verdict? Not much sex, hardly any city.After reading some of the reviews (most of which weren't pretty) prior to Friday, I was expecting the worst. But it wasn't that bad.I felt that the problem lied in the transfer of locale from Manhattan to Abu Dhabi. When I heard that part of the film would take place there, I thought it would be along the lines of the Mexican respite the ladies take in the original film. However, I suspect that filming abroad seemed like a good way to prevent the photographers that pervade the outdoor filming in Manhattan from spoiling any of the film's secrets. I believe some decoy scenes were even shot in the first film for that very reason. Buut Sarah Jessica Park always said that the fifth lady on Sex and the City was New York. Here she is all but missing entirely and in turn the film loses a lot of the dynamic that made the original HBO series--and even the 2008 film--work on so many levels.Instead what we have is a film that is essentially a parade of costume changes, one that shallowly looks at the cultural differences between women in the East and West. (What results from this is a couple of cringe worthy scenes where Samantha can't believe how oppressed Eastern women are, which, in the end, leads to the notion that women, no matter what part of the world they're from, have more in common than then they do differences.)Also, Cynthia Nixon's character, Miranda, is underutilized this time. While she showed growth in the first film, this round she makes the decision to quit her job early on in the film and that's where it ends for her. Being thousands of miles away from New York, she (and we, the audience) doesn't really get the gravity of her situation, and don't see her reconcile her new life.But for all of the negatives (and there are many), there are a number of positives, too. A good friend of mine said that he felt the best part of the film was Charlotte's character. I think I agree. Here it is Charlotte's opportunity to grow. I won't spoil it for you, but these scenes involving the mother of two are some of the most poignant in the entire film.This weekend there was a bit of an upset at the box office when Shrek the Third bested Sex and the City 2 for the top spot at the box office. I think that speaks more on the power of family films than any disenchantment with the Sex and the City franchise. After all, the latter's fan base is fiercely loyal, and a couple of bad reviews aren't going to deter them from catching up with their favourite girlfriends.Even though this film was largely disappointing, I still hope that they can learn from their mistakes and film a third one.",2,"Not Much Sex, Hardly Any City",1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2654,"['verdict', 'Not', 'much', 'sex', 'hardly', 'city.After', 'reading', 'reviews', 'most', 'were', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'prior', 'Friday', 'was', 'expecting', 'worst', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad.I', 'felt', 'problem', 'lied', 'transfer', 'locale', 'Manhattan', 'Abu', 'Dhabi', 'When', 'heard', 'part', 'film', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'there', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'lines', 'Mexican', 'respite', 'ladies', 'take', 'original', 'film', 'However', 'suspect', 'filming', 'abroad', 'seemed', 'good', 'way', 'prevent', 'photographers', 'pervade', 'outdoor', 'filming', 'Manhattan', 'spoiling', 'film', 'secrets', 'believe', 'decoy', 'scenes', 'were', 'even', 'shot', 'first', 'film', 'very', 'reason', 'Buut', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Park', 'always', 'said', 'fifth', 'lady', 'Sex', 'City', 'was', 'New', 'York', 'Here', 'missing', 'entirely', 'turn', 'film', 'lot', 'dynamic', 'made', 'original', 'HBO', 'series', 'even', '2008', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'many', 'levels.Instead', 'what', 'have', 'film', 'essentially', 'parade', 'costume', 'changes', 'one', 'shallowly', 'cultural', 'differences', 'women', 'East', 'West', 'What', 'results', 'couple', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'scenes', 'where', 'Samantha', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'oppressed', 'Eastern', 'women', 'are', 'end', 'notion', 'women', 'matter', 'what', 'part', 'world', ""'re"", 'have', 'more', 'common', 'then', 'do', 'differences', 'Also', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'character', 'Miranda', 'underutilized', 'time', 'showed', 'growth', 'first', 'film', 'round', 'decision', 'quit', 'job', 'early', 'film', 'where', 'Being', 'thousands', 'miles', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'audience', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'gravity', 'situation', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'reconcile', 'new', 'life.But', 'negatives', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'number', 'positives', 'too', 'good', 'friend', 'mine', 'said', 'felt', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'Charlotte', 'character', 'think', 'agree', 'Here', 'Charlotte', 'opportunity', 'grow', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'scenes', 'involving', 'mother', 'two', 'are', 'most', 'poignant', 'entire', 'film.This', 'weekend', 'was', 'bit', 'upset', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'bested', 'Sex', 'City', '2', 'top', 'spot', 'box', 'office', 'think', 'more', 'power', 'family', 'films', 'disenchantment', 'Sex', 'City', 'franchise', 'latter', 'fan', 'base', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'couple', 'bad', 'reviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'deter', 'catching', 'up', 'favourite', 'girlfriends.Even', 'film', 'was', 'largely', 'disappointing', 'still', 'hope', 'can', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'film', 'third', 'one']",N/A

I liked (and defended) your work on the first Sex and the City movie.

They're nothing like any of us anymore.  They're aliens in this film, and worse, they're insensitive, condescending, ""ugly American"" aliens.I ignored the bad reviews and went to the theater and watched the film twice to try to determine just why it bothered me so much the first time, and the thing is that I just can't relate to what these girls have become in the movies -- shallow, overly materialistic, WHINING, and NOTHING like anyone I know.

It looked like her original face was made of latex and then melted over a gas stove and stretched. Sweetheart--you're too OLD to have long dark two-toned hair. You're also too old to be that thin. SJP had the sex appeal of a dried-out stalk of wheat in this movie. Her character, Carrie, is unrecognizable now. The imperfect bubbly cute Carrie has been replaced by this humorless stretched out elitest shrew. She's the kind of woman now that Carrie would not have liked in the series. She's awful to everyone in the movie--condescending to the other characters. In fact, all of them are incredibly rude to ""lesser"" people--servents, foreigners (they're only foreigners after all!).Worst things (for me):-Samantha's wardrobe. WHY do they insist dressing Kim Cattrall like a bad drag queen version of Joan Crawford? She has a lovely figure and they always stick her in these ridiculous hard-edged power suits with enormous shoulder pads.-Samantha also got the honor of saying the worst line of the movie ""Lawrence of my labiaaaa!"" which was embarrassing to witness-Miranda was tolerable, except when she lowered the window of the car in the desert, screeching like she was at a sports bar at the goat herders at the side of the road--just culturally tin-eared and disrespectful and they seemed to rush to herd back the goats who were startled, glaring at this over-privileged moron in a $400,000 Mercedes-Charlotte gets camel toe. Oh goody. More vulva jokes! Really? Does Charlotte have to be humiliated in some scatalogical way now in every movie? The spoiled entitled American idiocy of her holding out her phone yelling about reception on top of the camel was also atrocious. Again, completely disrespectful and something Charlotte of old would NEVER have done-Carrie's prudish covering up of Samantha at every turn, but she shows up to meet Aiden (after hilariously kohling her squinty tired-looking eyes to even smaller proportions) in a thigh-baring cleavage-revealing top and skirt.-Mr. Big, the true virile man's man, posing like a ponce-y English Noel Coward in brown satin pajamas holding a teeny tiny teacup and saucer.-They ask Samantha what she's eating, even though most normal people, and particularly supposedly sophisticated people from New York City have known what HUMMUS is since like 1991.I was a huge SATC fan, and I enjoyed the first movie, but this movie was the kind of irritating where you want to kick something or drink.

The two movies that have come out since were just unnecessary and really added little to the franchise except disenchantment for most of us fans.A nod to the 2009/2010 recession was given in this production in that they talked about it though you would hardly know it since all of our gals and their friends seem to live extraordinarily wealthy life styles.  Take-out from a Japanese fusion restaurant and Liza Minnelli performing at a wedding is hardly cutting costs. (Okay, I get it - we don't want to see our girls shopping at Costco or eating Hamburger Helper.).

Carrie still wants to live it up like a 20 year old (which she's not anymore) and go out while Big is quite content on staying home with take out and a black and white movie. They have a brief discussion about having children (which thank goodness it was brief because I have decided now that these two should NOT procreate)Miranda has a new boss at her firm that is a sexist pig and she up and quits. This is not the Miranda I grew to know and love, that Miranda would have stood up for herself!Charlotte oh ""whoa is me"" Charlotte...Still a happily married mother of 2 (a 2 year old Rose and 6 year old Lily) who INSISTENTLY whines that her girls are driving her crazy. I seriously wanted to shove a pacifier in her mouth! She hires a beautiful nanny which adds to the annoyance that is Charlotte in this film she becomes an insecure little wuss.Samantha is TRYING to stop menopause through every pill, cream, trick known to man. WISE UP Samantha, its going to happen! Through her friendship with Smith (who'd a thought that one after their ending in the first movie?)and a fellow P.R. person she gets an all-expenses paid trip to Abu Dhabi (on a note: the film was banned from filming on location in U.A.E. and shot in Morocco) for her and the girls where the real trouble begins...Carrie (and by some oddly convenient twist of fate) runs into Aidan. This was the BIGGEST letdown of all...there was much hype that when John Corbett signed on for this film and he has MAYBE a combined 10 minutes of screen time. They share ONE kiss after dinner and Carrie falls apart for much of the remainder of the movie about how/if she should tell Big. There was SUCH potential there gone down the drain.Samantha gets caught making out on a beach with a well to do Dane and she is detained until released with help from the man who brought her there (he also subsequently cancels their meeting and all paid expenses)En route to hurry back to the hotel to pack the foursome cause a near riot when (in trying to lure Charlotte away from black marketers) the contents of Samantha's purse spill out (including condoms) She makes VERY obscene gestures to the male crowd causing a bigger stir. (This was another problem I had...I found the film HIGHLY disrespectful to the Muslim culture which is the last thing we needed to do in today's society)Thankfully the girls are saved by some ""rebel"" Arab women who share their love of fashions.Bottom line...A exceedingly disrespectful film to the Muslim culture (when its the last thing we SHOULD be doing), these women are going around in clothes and living in apartments most of us only DREAM of affording (are they immune to the floundering economy or something? It just depressed me even more knowing how unrealistic that was) A HUGE missed oppurtunity with John Corbett returning, and lastly, these just were not the girls I watched and fell in love with every week.Sarah Jessica Parker says there is the possibility of a third film while Chris Noth said the critics beat the film to death and he doubts there will be a third film-sorry SJP but I have got to go with Chris on this one!",1,The BIGGEST Letdown In Sequel History,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,3596,"['fan', 'show', 'Sex', 'City', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'when', 'heard', 'sequel', 'had', 'been', 'green', 'lit', 'ordered', 'not', '10', 'minutes', 'watching', 'film', 'bubble', 'busted', 'open', 'had', 'truly', 'hoped', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King', 'back', 'helm', 'film', 'would', 'NOT', 'fall', 'victim', 'sequel', 'curse', 'did', 'find', 'favorite', 'foursome', '2', 'years', 'first', 'film', 'left', 'Carrie', 'Big', 'are', 'married', 'living', 'fabulous', '5th', 'Ave.', 'apartment', 'Carrie', 'still', 'live', 'up', '20', 'year', 'old', 'not', 'anymore', 'go', 'out', 'Big', 'quite', 'content', 'staying', 'home', 'take', 'out', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'have', 'brief', 'discussion', 'having', 'children', 'goodness', 'was', 'brief', 'have', 'decided', 'now', 'two', 'should', 'NOT', 'procreate', 'Miranda', 'new', 'boss', 'firm', 'sexist', 'pig', 'up', 'quits', 'not', 'Miranda', 'grew', 'know', 'love', 'Miranda', 'would', 'have', 'stood', 'up', 'herself', 'Charlotte', 'whoa', 'Charlotte', 'Still', 'happily', 'married', 'mother', '2', '2', 'year', 'old', 'Rose', '6', 'year', 'old', 'Lily', 'who', 'INSISTENTLY', 'girls', 'are', 'driving', 'crazy', 'seriously', 'wanted', 'shove', 'pacifier', 'mouth', 'beautiful', 'nanny', 'annoyance', 'Charlotte', 'film', 'insecure', 'little', 'wuss.Samantha', 'TRYING', 'stop', 'menopause', 'pill', 'cream', 'trick', 'known', 'man', 'WISE', 'UP', 'Samantha', 'going', 'happen', 'friendship', 'Smith', 'who', 'thought', 'one', 'ending', 'first', 'movie', 'fellow', 'P.R', 'person', 'all-expenses', 'paid', 'trip', 'Abu', 'Dhabi', 'note', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'filming', 'location', 'U.A.E', 'shot', 'Morocco', 'girls', 'where', 'real', 'trouble', 'begins', 'Carrie', 'oddly', 'convenient', 'twist', 'fate', 'Aidan', 'was', 'BIGGEST', 'letdown', 'was', 'much', 'hype', 'when', 'John', 'Corbett', 'signed', 'film', 'MAYBE', 'combined', '10', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'share', 'ONE', 'kiss', 'dinner', 'Carrie', 'apart', 'much', 'remainder', 'movie', 'how/if', 'should', 'tell', 'Big', 'was', 'SUCH', 'potential', 'gone', 'down', 'drain.Samantha', 'caught', 'making', 'out', 'beach', 'well', 'do', 'Dane', 'detained', 'released', 'help', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'also', 'subsequently', 'meeting', 'paid', 'expenses', 'En', 'route', 'hurry', 'back', 'hotel', 'pack', 'foursome', 'cause', 'near', 'riot', 'when', 'trying', 'lure', 'Charlotte', 'away', 'black', 'marketers', 'contents', 'Samantha', 'purse', 'spill', 'including', 'condoms', 'VERY', 'obscene', 'gestures', 'male', 'crowd', 'causing', 'bigger', 'stir', 'was', 'problem', 'had', 'found', 'film', 'HIGHLY', 'disrespectful', 'Muslim', 'culture', 'last', 'thing', 'needed', 'do', 'today', 'society', 'Thankfully', 'girls', 'are', 'saved', 'rebel', 'Arab', 'women', 'who', 'share', 'love', 'fashions.Bottom', 'line', 'A', 'exceedingly', 'disrespectful', 'film', 'Muslim', 'culture', 'when', 'last', 'thing', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'doing', 'women', 'are', 'going', 'clothes', 'living', 'apartments', 'most', 'only', 'DREAM', 'affording', 'are', 'immune', 'floundering', 'economy', 'something', 'just', 'depressed', 'even', 'more', 'knowing', 'how', 'unrealistic', 'was', 'A', 'HUGE', 'missed', 'oppurtunity', 'John', 'Corbett', 'returning', 'lastly', 'just', 'were', 'not', 'girls', 'watched', 'fell', 'love', 'week.Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'possibility', 'third', 'film', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'said', 'critics', 'beat', 'film', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'third', 'film-sorry', 'SJP', 'have', 'got', 'go', 'Chris', 'one']",N/A
1309914,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG98Z0,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 13]","With the possible exceptions of my reviews for ""Fanboys"" and ""Mamma Mia!,"" I don't think anything I've written has been as universally despised as my 2008 review for ""Sex and the City,"" a film I described as, ""one of the longest two-and-a-half hours I've spent at the movies this year, and that's mostly because it didn't need to be two-and-a-half hours."" I went on to say that it was, ""as over-inflated as the characters themselves, some of the most annoying, artificial, selfish women ever conceived of."" Oh, but I made some people mad. And I'm going to do it again. That's because I'm up against a dedicated fan base, which now has ""Sex and the City 2"" to cherish. Just like before, the intended audiences will leave the theater with big, dopey grins on their faces, as if they downed more than a few particularly heavy Cosmopolitans.But what are people like me left with? What about those who aren't deluded into thinking that shameless consumerism and shallow ideals qualify as escapism? Shouldn't movies in some way have all audiences in mind and not exist in a closed universe? ""Sex and the City 2"" - just like its predecessor - is nothing more than an in-joke for the fans, one that confuses inane sitcom dialogue with genuine wit, trivialities with compelling emotional drama, and tasteful fashion with gaudy displays of fabric and color. It also mistakes featherbrained fashionistas with authentic comedic personalities, our four friends possessing little if any redeemable qualities that would make them seem like actual people. I've been told that ""Sex and the City"" is a fairy tale. I don't think so. ""Hansel and Gretel"" is a fairy tale; this is daydreaming run amok.The plot involves Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), and Charlotte York (Kristen Davis) going on an all-expenses-paid trip to the emirate of Abu Dhabi, the result of Samantha's fateful meeting with a wealthy sheik who wants publicity for his hotel. They fly on the sheik's private airline and are provided with first class cabins so luxurious, they're like miniature rooms. Once they arrive at the hotel, they're placed in $22,000-a-day suites and given access to all sorts of excessive amenities, including their own private butlers. Once they settle in, they decide to take a tour of the city's market district. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that they strut around the city, wearing clothing so bright and tacky, it's as if they survived an explosion at a textile mill.Now, what exactly is the theme here? Apparently, it's the institution of marriage, although I find that hard to believe given how unrealistically it's explored. Consider the central conflict: Carrie and her husband, Mr. Big (Chris Noth), are in a rut because she prefers nights out on the town and he prefers to sit on the couch and watch black and white films on their big screen TV. I think the real problem here is that there isn't a problem. If he were having an affair, or if she was neglecting her children, okay, then there would be a problem. But he's been faithful, and they have no children, and they live in an apartment most of us can only dream of living in. So what it really boils down to is that Carrie is needlessly nagging her husband, a man so unbelievably boring he can't even raise his voice beyond a monotone hum.This theme is also explored with Charlotte, who finds herself on the verge of motherhood burnout and in need of a break. I find this odd given the fact that her children are raised almost entirely by their nanny; the closest we get to a meaningful moment between mother and children is a scene in which they bake dozens of cupcakes, cheapened by Charlotte's yakking on the phone at the same time. The moment is ruined when the older girl plants her dye-stained hands on her mother's rear end, leaving prints on her vintage Valentino. Here's a piece of advice: If you're going to bake with young kids, who are naturally inclined to be messy, you probably shouldn't be wearing expensive designer clothing.As for the nanny, she's an Irish bimbo who never wears a bra, a plot point that doesn't faze Charlotte until it's so helpfully suggested that it might lead to an affair with her husband. She then spends the rest of the film neurotically trying to reach him on her cell phone, despite the eight-hour time difference.Other touches, like Samantha's hormonal treatments to maintain her overactive sex drive, are just juvenile attempts at menopause humor. An early scene at a gay wedding, designed to look like the set of an MGM musical, is an overblown spectacle of tiresome stereotypes. It's not at all helped by the inclusion of Liza Minnelli, who, as far as I know, has no credentials for performing a marriage ceremony. And I was especially turned off by a scene late in the film of Muslim women revealing that they wear designer clothing underneath their burqas. This isn't a feminist statement - it's an indecent example of materialism. Much like the film as a whole; ""Sex and the City 2"" is all style and no substance, an airy, superficial, petty display of glitzy excess. There's nothing to be gained by watching movies like this.",2,Materialism Goes Middle Eastern,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,5204,"['possible', 'exceptions', 'reviews', 'Fanboys', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'do',

The show was amazing. I've seen every episode of all six seasons numerous times, and I've seen the first film three times now, and thought it was incredibly perfect.I can't believe that most guys don't like this show. It's about four beautiful women learning from, thoroughly discussing, and actually having - lots of sex! What's not to like? Yeah there is a lot of sappy relationship stuff in there too - but most guys are in or want to be in relationships with women just like these. Maybe that's the key - they don't want to relive it on a T.V. show? I've personally learned so much from the show and I think women everywhere would agree with me in saying that most guys could pick up a hint or two from it as well. Man, I hope I don't get beat up by fellow dudes after writing this review!So why does the sequel fail to live up to the show and its predecessor? This movie is vastly far from the others in numerous ways. To find the two most blatant examples of what's missing, you need look no further than the title: SEX and the CITY; where are they? The majority of the film takes place in the Middle East, far away from our beloved New York, and where is all the sex? We get a measly two poor attempts at sex scenes, both of which involve only one of our gals. Why???And where are the intimate issues between the couples? Where are Carrie's well narrated writings of problems in her friend's relationships? Charlotte is jealous of the big breasted nanny? That's the best you could come up with, seriously? Where are the scenes of the four gals discussing their relationships, particularly at high class New York restaurants and cafes? And Steve and Harry are in the movie for maybe 30 seconds total! And we finally get Samantha single again, and she can't `be herself' because she's in the Middle East? LAME!Sex and the City 2 is basically a weak unnecessary wedding for an opening, followed by a boring look at the married life of Big and Carrie, followed by an extremely unrelenting sequence in the Middle East that went on and on and on! What happened here? This film could not have felt any further from Sex and the City if it tried to. Were it to be an original idea all on its own, perhaps it would have been somewhat tolerable. But for true die-hard Sex and the City fans like me, it's a disappointment to say the absolute least.The film opens with re-introducing Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon), which was done well. We see some humorous clips of how they all met in New York back in the `80s.I perked up in my seat as I thought the film was going to take the most obvious approach one would do with such an idea; have the first 10 minutes take place back in the `80s, while creating the conflict for the rest of the movie, taking place in the present. Why didn't they do this? Instead, they were only showing us the girls in `80s style fashion for a quick little moment of enjoyment, before they plant us in the middle of a ridiculous wedding sequence that went on for way too long. And why are these two characters getting married in the first place? When did they stop hating each other and fall in love?In addition to the wedding, there were several moments in the film that went on and on and were poorly edited. This one is written and directed by the same guy who brought us the first flick (Michael Patrick King) as well as several of the television episodes; so why did he veer so far from his usual path with this movie?One scene in the film I did like took place between Charlotte and Miranda. No other characters are in it with them, and they spill their guts to one another about the day to day struggles of marriage and being mothers. It was funny and heartfelt at the same time and was very well acted by both stars - but it didn't feel like Sex and the City. As nice as this was, we would rather have had or at least also had our traditional scene between Carrie and Miranda, where they share a personal moment. It's not found here.I've listened to interviews from all four women and Michael Patrick King and I get what they were attempting to do with this film. They wanted to just have fun and be a little ridiculous. They wanted to show the girls off on an adventure away from the city, and not have to worry about being too serious. While they did pack quite a few genuine laughs in here, the film is often too quirky and cheesy. Nearly the entire trip to the Middle East irritated me. I kept waiting for them to return to the Big Apple and close the film with some of the delicious originality that made me fall in love with the franchise... but it never happened.Michael Patrick King is on the fence as to whether or not he is going to do a third installment. He basically says that he's up for it if the fans are. As disappointed as I was with Sex and the City 2, I'm not giving up on him or these characters. If they stick to their original roots that we all enjoyed in the first picture and the show, then they can close this series on a good note.Michael Patrick King - sir, if you are reading this, it's very simple what we want to see in the third movie; two words, that can be found in this movie's title.

It's Sex and the City and the costumes in the movie were nothing short of stunning. Also, I love the fact that they went to the Middle East. The cinematography was breath taking! I loved the arabian nights scenery.  Did you not get enough NYC during the six seaons of the the show and the first movie? I thought changing the location was a great idea.

With that as a backdrop, for me, SATC2 was a huge disappointment.  It has its moments, to be sure.  I found myself laughing really hard several times at some of the lines (""Holy Mother of God, what's with the gut?""), but overall, this is just a very weak movie.  The writing is lame and the plot is boring.  And whose idea was it to take the show that was defined by its location out of New York City and take it to the UAE?  Whosever it was has, in my opinion, damaged the franchise with what has to be the dumbest idea to manifest itself in a major film release in a while.  Maybe it was time to retire it anyway.  Personally, I'm still a big enough fan to give them another chance.  I just hope they get a fresh writing and production team next time - and, please take it back to New York City where it belongs.  Any time you have a core team of actors that gelled as well as this one did, the fan base always gets a feeling of coming home in just seeing the characters come to life again with new material, and I got that feeling from this movie as well (and hope to get it again with a better follow-up).

Eichholz ""bsnmsn""","[1, 1]","OK, let me state that I loved the series and enjoyed the first movie ( except for that terrible wedding look for the Carrie character ). Moving along, the story was completely ridiculous, with the exception of The Charlotte and Miranda Late Night Heart To Heart. I had hoped the writers would flesh out the characters' lives and and show some growth and maturity in all the relationships, but they took the easy way out, sometimes moving in a "" let's wrap this up "" direction. The character of Carrie was totally annoying. She spent the series in a desperate search for her great love and learning nothing, apparently. The Samantha character is a bit too long in the tooth to be playing The Eternal Vamp and seems mired in Porkys', bad make up, worse hair and clothing. The only saving grace was Charlotte and Miranda - both ladies appearing to grow in substance and in their relationships. The storyline was totally unbelievable, even for this fan of SATC. To show Samantha melting down so fast because of menopause and being unable to have access to supplements didn't ring true and her behavior was way over the top. Especially in the Middle East, which bought into most unfortunate stereotypes. The wedding ? Oh, please. It also played into every possible gay stereotype. I knew the writers didn't have a clue about the characters when I caught the response from the Anthony character about his ethnicity. When asked why he was allowed a certain behavior, it was ok, because he said he is Italian. In the series, the Anthony character made a point of noting he was not Italian, but Sicilian. Maybe it's nitpicking, but this sort of mistake almost defines the mistakes in this movie. While I would welcome another SATC movie, I would hope the writers and stylists use common sense, taste and figure out that these are characters we have watched and we know.",2,There's No City In This Movie,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,1860,"['OK', 'let', 'state', 'loved', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'terrible', 'wedding', 'look', 'Carrie', 'character', 'Moving', 'along', 'story', 'was', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'exception', 'Charlotte', 'Miranda', 'Late', 'Night', 'Heart', 'Heart', 'had', 'hoped', 'writers', 'would', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'lives', 'show', 'growth', 'maturity', 'relationships', 'took', 'easy', 'way', 'sometimes', 'moving', 'let', 'wrap', 'direction', 'character', 'Carrie', 'was', 'totally', 'annoying', 'spent', 'series', 'desperate', 'search', 'great', 'love', 'learning', 'nothing', 'apparently', 'Samantha', 'character', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'tooth', 'be', 'playing', 'Eternal', 'Vamp', 'mired', 'Porkys', 'bad', 'make', 'up', 'worse', 'hair', 'clothing', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'was', 'Charlotte', 'Miranda', 'ladies', 'appearing', 'grow', 'substance', 'relationships', 'storyline', 'was', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'even', 'fan', 'SATC', 'show', 'Samantha', 'melting', 'down', 'so', 'fast', 'menopause', 'being', 'unable', 'have', 'access', 'supplements', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'behavior', 'was', 'way', 'top', 'Especially', 'Middle', 'East', 'bought', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'stereotypes', 'wedding', 'Oh', 'please', 'also', 'played', 'possible', 'gay', 'stereotype', 'knew', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'characters', 'when', 'caught', 'response', 'Anthony', 'character', 'ethnicity', 'When', 'asked', 'why', 'was', 'allowed', 'certain', 'behavior', 'was', 'ok', 'said', 'Italian', 'series', 'Anthony', 'character', 'made', 'point', 'noting', 'was', 'not', 'Italian', 'Sicilian', 'Maybe', 'nitpicking', 'sort', 'mistake', 'almost', 'mistakes', 'movie', 'would', 'welcome', 'SATC', 'movie', 'would', 'hope', 'writers', 'stylists', 'use', 'common', 'sense', 'taste', 'figure', 'out', 'are', 'characters', 'have', 'watched', 'know']",N/A

SATC has always been primarily just a fun, guilty pleasure to me.  Sure, there have been meaningful subplots to all the stories, but it is first and foremost a comedy.  They pulled out all the stops for the opening wedding scene in this one, and it was a delight. Yes, it was a little cringe-worthy having Liza play a gay wedding, but c'mon, what movie starts with a big 'ol gay valentine to the audience like this?!  The audience in the theater at the sneak preview that I attended was, by and large, comprised of exquisitely dressed women.  I felt like I was tagging along for the party, and was so happy to hear all of the ladies exploding with laughter when Minnelli came out and did ""Single Ladies.""  It set the tone for a great time at the movies...As fluffy as the installments in the series and these two movies can be, there is always a lot of heart in each production.  The storyline about how couples define their relationships really spoke to me.  I've had a long-distance relationship for 13 years--due to circumstances, and am too well aware of how many people view my situation when I describe it.  The equivalent of ""How do you hold up?"" greets nearly every conversation I have with people who have more traditional relationships.  It was refreshing to see the SATC girls take on what defines a relationship--the two people having it!!Let's hope there will be a third installment of the movie series because SATC has always been, at its core, about bringing people together for fashion, laughter, and irreverence, with a side of wistfulness.  I think maybe some people have begun to expect too much from our girls...let's not try and make the series something that it never was!!",4,Fun with a little meaning on the side...,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,1794,"['honestly', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'drubbing', 'film', 'got', 'reviewers', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'SATC', 'always', 'been', 'primarily', 'just', 'fun', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Sure', 'have', 'been', 'meaningful', 'subplots', 'stories', 'first', 'foremost', 'comedy', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'opening', 'wedding', 'scene', 'one', 'was', 'delight', 'Yes', 'was', 'little', 'cringe-worthy', 'having', 'Liza', 'play', 'gay', 'wedding', ""c'mon"", 'what', 'movie', 'big', ""'ol"", 'gay', 'valentine', 'audience', 'audience', 'theater', 'sneak', 'preview', 'attended', 'was', 'large', 'comprised', 'exquisitely', 'dressed', 'women', 'felt', 'was', 'tagging', 'along', 'party', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'hear', 'ladies', 'exploding', 'laughter', 'when', 'Minnelli', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'Single', 'Ladies', 'set', 'tone', 'great', 'time', 'movies', 'As', 'fluffy', 'installments', 'series', 'two', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'always', 'lot', 'heart', 'production', 'storyline', 'how', 'couples', 'define', 'relationships', 'really', 'spoke', ""'ve"", 'had', 'long-distance', 'relationship', '13', 'years', 'due', 'circumstances', 'am', 'too', 'well', 'aware', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'view', 'situation', 'when', 'describe', 'equivalent', 'How', 'do', 'hold', 'up', 'greets', 'nearly', 'conversation', 'have', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'traditional', 'relationships', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'SATC', 'girls', 'take', 'what', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'having', 'Let', 'hope', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'third', 'installment', 'movie', 'series', 'SATC', 'always', 'been', 'core', 'bringing', 'people', 'together', 'fashion', 'laughter', 'irreverence', 'side', 'wistfulness', 'think', 'maybe', 'people', 'have', 'begun', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'girls', 'let', 'not', 'try', 'make', 'series', 'something', 'never', 'was']",N/A
1309929,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B002ZG98Z0,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[6, 11]","After a time, all fictional characters that live in the world of the celluloid fantastic where reruns and `on demand' services allow frequent re-acquaintance overload enter an audience immunization state that suggests that nothing they do--no matter how horrendously outrageous--will phase their fans or viewers.Think of Hannibal Lector who in ""The Silence of the Lambs (Criterion Collection Spine #13)"" raised goose bumps on the skin of anyone who watched his tongue flicker in and out while he uttered that famous line about fava beans and Cianti.  Later in ""Hannibal (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" even as he ratchets open Ray Liotta's skull to partake of slices of lightly saut&eacute;ed grey matter, exposure of the character and Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of him transmuted into someone more acceptable--an American Icon that was well-loved. More screen appearances materialized--""Red Dragon - Collector's Edition"" and ""Hannibal Rising (Unrated Widescreen Edition)."" In effect, the media saturation of Hannibal Lector sanitized him to the point of audiences becoming immune to him--warm and fuzzifying him even though he still engaged in some of the most despicable acts that anyone could or should imagine.  We love the character, but the weak storylines were there to just showcase our loved one--not to give us a film that was memorable--except for the travelogue views of Florence in `Hannibal'--or furthered his story in a way that was as compelling as that in our first encounter.Now the girls of the SATC franchise--Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte--whose roles are currently reprised in this 2010 film ""Sex and the City 2""--two years after the first ""the Movie"" version (Sex and the City: The Movie (Special Edition))--certainly have little in common with Hannibal Lector--or do they?  They are, forgive the pun, man-eaters.  However, their episodic escapades, ranking an eleven or twelve on the promiscuity scale of one to ten, at one time revolutionary for television as was Lector's first horror-inducing appearance in ""TSOTL"" now seems as campy and typically American as Liza Minelli's cameo at the gay wedding of Stanford and Anthony.  The only reaction warranted is a bit of a jaw drop, a shake of the head and then no matter how zany, crazy, corny, spoofy or over-the-top, acceptance.  As with the now cuddly Hannibal, the Fab Four can no longer surprise or repel us.  They have become full-fledged members of Americana and we have to like them the way we love mom and apple pie.And we do, qualities of forever friendship between women who do not back bite each other or fly off never to be seen again in jealous rages present the exception to the almost oxymoronic idea of the female friendship rule.  Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte purport different mindsets and sensibilities that in the real world may not gel with the synergistic tolerance depicted in the series.  That's why millions of women love these characters--none of them takes a backseat to one another; they all coexist even if it is in the Utopian world of the girl-pal support genre.  When on the screen, the foursome compels the female viewer to climb into the scene and bask in the reflective light of iconic friendships that they will never have, as they simply do not exist.  Our egos, coupled with the very nature of humanness, make this impossible.Now, of course, my comments contain relevancy only for those who are fans of the show.  Few people outside that subset of rom-com lovers would have any use for this particular adventure that features over two and a half hours dedicated to the terrible twos associated with questions arising in the two year old Big/Carrie marriage merger featuring Carrie's ennui regarding the predictable direction of her childless-by-choice union, Charlotte's inability to cope with her two daughters and a rather buxom nanny, Miranda's invisibility at her firm and Samantha's menopausal need for hormone replacement.Changing the venue from New York City to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates suggests writer and director Michael Patrick King looked at this film as an extended episode where the girls need to get out of Dodge a la Thelma and Louise and do the obligatory once-a-season road trip.  Showcasing another `city' for `the city' may poke a hole in the balloon of fan expectation.  However, I pose this question for these filmmakers with such elaborate budgets: Rather than a foreign city, why not an American city that could have used the publicity to interject some needed stimulation to the flagging economy through an SATC tourism campaign?  As in all such films that feature beautiful locales, Marrakesh which doubles for Abu Dhabi oozes with opulence and an oasis of splendid eye-candy--a $22K a night hotel suite, chauffeured Maybachs and Mercedes, individual man servants for each of the gals, enough food to feed a third world country, dazzling views of the Arabian desert and world class soccer players without their shirts.  Escapist? For sure, why else would we watch it?  But why not an escape to New Orleans, San Francisco, Seattle or any US city that could capitalize on the film's marketing efforts?Designer Patricia Field again costumes the women in extravagant and sometimes tasteless outfits that make you wonder if she doesn't understand the concept of growing older donning elegant couture that accentuates the savvy and sophistication needed to know when not to wear something blatantly unattractive.  Sarah Jessica Parker (Halston Heritage's new creative hire) as Carrie Bradshaw Preston preens with an extensive wardrobe of Middle Eastern themed harem pants and turbans that quite frankly characterized her as eccentric rather than chic.  When she is not wearing gracefully draped Halston American Heritage, Carrie's odd desire for the unconventional snore-free relationship filters into her wardrobe choices.  The Yohji Yamamoto hat she wears on the plane keeps viewers guessing, ""Is it a nest for the bird she wore with the Vivien Westwood bridal gown?"" as does the lavender taffeta floor length lining she pairs with a ""J'adore Dior"" vintage tee.  Who would wear such a combo with four-inch heels while shopping in a foreign souk? Samantha's (Kim Cattrall) red dress by the Blonds featuring silver mace-like bulbs on each shoulder seems reminiscent of the padded 80s gone ballistic.  Poor Kristin Davis (Charlotte) and Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) wear a sherbet smorgasbord of all the right clothes for their age group and body type, but somehow manage to get ignored in favor of the more eclectic Parker and age-defying Cattrall.  All in all, most of these fashions seemed subtitled Mismatched Scheherazade; the presentation, especially the little runway stomp in the desert more a slow-motion, hair whipping-in-the-sirocco trailer for a new series season rather than a sequence in a film.For those who are going to complain that the film contains little realism in the face of recession, think back to the 30s when most of the country faced depression, big stars flaunted furs, dripped with diamonds and supported maids and butlers galore. SATC2 doesn't take itself seriously, so why should we?  Sit back and watch the extravaganza, but beware that the script is devoid of any main storyline.  Carrie & Co. quip back and forth with each other and their men, punning shamelessly they epitomize a sour wit that relies on brand name recognition and other accoutrement of privileged life. Unfortunately, other than Samantha hawking her natural hormone replacement solutions and Charlotte confessing that motherhood can be exhausting (even with help-OMG!), our four favorite fashion oracles have little to offer in terms of real time wisdom other than a genuine love for each other.We still love them no matter what they do--Samantha's suicidal shooting of the bird amidst a hostile grouping of gallibaya clad men while in the spice market comes quickly to mind with an eye roll that reminds me that these characters have become iconized like the diabolical Hannibal Lector as symbols of our American culture.  And we, as a mainstream audience &lt;groan>, will defend them to the death.Bottom line? In SATC2, director and writer, Michael Patrick King, allows fans of the HBO series to go on the ultimate road trip with their favorite foursome. Surrounded by all fluff and no substance, Carrie and the gang age but don't seem to garner much wisdom; they want instead to stay sexy in any city whether they can pull it off or not.  Whatever they do, these characters have stood the test of still having staying power for over a decade, allowing the audience the vicarious indulgence of all things slick, opulent and simply outrageous.  This character recognition and acceptance into the American hall of TV legends seems to give the filmmakers carte blanche, putting the group in more and more outrageous situations that require desperate means and a good sense of humor to undo.  The film's plot meanders, not down a street called Straight but, in the middle of Abu Dhabi where some pretty silly and sometimes disrespectful comments regarding Middle Eastern mores overshadow and downplay the gal's over-brandishing of their celebrated and presumed sexual freedom.  For those who idolize the series, SATC2 provides another adventure with characters they love.  For those who don't, realize that some folks do; don't get offended, just see another film or read a good book.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Terrible Twos,1275004800,"05 28,

1309932,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B002ZG98Z0,Douglas King,"[14, 17]","Oh dear.For the record, I liked the ""Sex and the City"" show, which chronicled the lives of four single (mostly 30-something) women in New York City. Although the women were all successful upper-class types, which allowed for the show to feature plenty of fashion and frivolity, the characters were always portrayed as human beings who had real problems that made them relatable. The show ended gracefully after, I think, 7 seasons, without wearing out its welcome as so many TV shows do, and allowing the characters to seem to be embracing more mature relationships and lifestyles.Flash forward five years, and viewers were presented with the first SATC film. It was a commercial success, but creatively, I found it to be redundant and mediocre. Flash forward two more years, and the second SATC film goes far past redundant and is just plain offensive.The main characters, once upper-class yet relatable, are now ridiculously spoiled and self-centered. Carrie, once a free spirited columnist, now lives in a posh penthouse with her husband, John. Carrie's biggest problem is that John wants to stay home and have take-out after work, instead of accompanying her to a premiere. Also, she is upset that John gave her a big screen TV for their anniversary instead of a piece of jewelry. Poor, poor Carrie. Charlotte is now married to an attorney with two children. Not only does Charlotte not have to work outside the home, but she also employs a full-time nanny. Yet in Charlotte's most emotional scene, she cries about how overwhelming motherhood is. I'm sure all the single, working-class mothers in the audience could feel her pain. And then we have Samantha. Samantha's character has always struggled to accept herself for who she is - a successful woman who was just not meant for a conventional monogamous relationship. Sadly, in this film, her character has become a parody, not an icon of empowerment. She's outraged when a salesperson at a boutique suggests that a dress is perhaps age-inappropriate, and then wears the dress to a red carpet event where she runs into Miley Cyrus, wearing the same dress. And this is supposed to suggest what, exactly ... that's it's empowering for a woman over fifty to still be trying to dress and behave like a teenager?Somehow, the film makes some excuse for the four, downtrodden heroines to take a free trip to Abu Dhabi. As if the film weren't already offensive enough, now the girls are off to the Middle East, where they expect another culture to embrace their materialism and brash sexuality, and are shocked when it doesn't. Oh, and Aidan shows up for no apparent reason, other than to rehash a storyline that was supposedly resolved 7 years ago.Please, please, please, stop beating this dead horse.",1,Offensive,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,2751,"['Oh', 'record', 'liked', 'Sex', 'City', 'show', 'chronicled', 'lives', 'four', 'single', 'mostly', '30-something', 'women', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'women', 'were', 'successful', 'upper-class', 'types', 'allowed', 'show', 'feature', 'plenty', 'fashion', 'frivolity', 'characters', 'were', 'always', 'portrayed', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'had', 'real', 'problems', 'made', 'relatable', 'show', 'ended', 'gracefully', 'think', '7', 'seasons', 'wearing', 'out', 'welcome', 'so', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'do', 'allowing', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'embracing', 'more', 'mature', 'relationships', 'lifestyles.Flash', 'forward', 'five', 'years', 'viewers', 'were', 'presented', 'first', 'SATC', 'film', 'was', 'commercial', 'success', 'creatively', 'found', 'be', 'redundant', 'mediocre', 'Flash', 'forward', 'two', 'more', 'years', 'second', 'SATC', 'film', 'far', 'past', 'redundant', 'just', 'plain', 'offensive.The', 'main', 'characters', 'once', 'upper-class', 'yet', 'relatable', 'are', 'now', 'ridiculously', 'spoiled', 'self-centered', 'Carrie', 'once', 'free', 'spirited', 'columnist', 'now', 'posh', 'penthouse', 'husband', 'John', 'Carrie', 'biggest', 'problem', 'John', 'stay', 'home', 'have', 'take-out', 'work', 'instead', 'accompanying', 'premiere', 'Also', 'upset', 'John', 'gave', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', 'anniversary', 'instead', 'piece', 'jewelry', 'Poor', 'poor', 'Carrie', 'Charlotte', 'now', 'married', 'attorney', 'two', 'children', 'Not', 'only', 'Charlotte', 'not', 'have', 'work', 'home', 'also', 'full-time', 'nanny', 'Charlotte', 'most', 'emotional', 'scene', 'how', 'overwhelming', 'motherhood', ""'m"", 'sure', 'single', 'working-class', 'mothers', 'audience', 'could', 'feel', 'pain', 'then', 'have', 'Samantha', 'Samantha', 'character', 'always', 'struggled', 'accept', 'who', 'successful', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'meant', 'conventional', 'monogamous', 'relationship', 'Sadly', 'film', 'character', 'become', 'parody', 'not', 'icon', 'empowerment', 'outraged', 'when', 'salesperson', 'boutique', 'dress', 'perhaps', 'age-inappropriate', 'then', 'dress', 'red', 'carpet', 'event', 'where', 'Miley', 'Cyrus', 'wearing', 'same', 'dress', 'supposed', 'suggest', 'what', 'exactly', 'empowering', 'woman', 'fifty', 'still', 'be', 'trying', 'dress', 'behave', 'teenager', 'Somehow', 'film', 'excuse', 'four', 'downtrodden', 'heroines', 'take', 'free', 'trip', 'Abu', 'Dhabi', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'already', 'offensive', 'enough', 'now', 'girls', 'are', 'Middle', 'East', 'where', 'expect', 'culture', 'embrace', 'materialism', 'brash', 'sexuality', 'are', 'shocked', 'when', ""n't"", 'Oh', 'Aidan', 'up', 'apparent', 'reason', 'other', 'rehash', 'storyline', 'was', 'supposedly', 'resolved', '7', 'years', 'ago.Please', 'please', 'please', 'stop', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse']",N/A

1309935,AXAJXJZUL2J5P,B002ZG98Z0,D. Scott,"[5, 5]","Sex and the City 2 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I have the entire series on DVD, and I can happily watch episode after episode, but I had to take several breaks from this movie to make it all the way through.  It's nearly 2.5 hours of torture.If you, too, enjoyed the series and feel like you should watch SATC2 just so that you've seen it...don't!  You will be missing NOTHING!  I wasn't a fan of the first film, but at least it had a few redeeming moments.  SATC2 has absolutely nothing worthwhile.  I would prefer to pretend it never existed.Can women in their 40s and 50s still be sexy and fashionable and fabulous?  Absolutely!  Are the ladies any of these things in this movie?  Not for a moment!  They look like old, old women (much older than they really are) trying to pretend they are in their early 20s.  Their makeup is clown-like and their clothes consistently unflattering.In the original series, I could relate to some aspect of each of the women's characters.  That's a large part of what made the show appealing to me.  But in this movie, there is absolutely nothing about any of them that I relate to.Charlotte going crazy because her kids are too much for her?  Sure, I have kids and I get that.  But she has a nanny and doesn't work.  When she needs a break from the kids, what's stopping her?  And she's worried about the nanny bouncing around in skimpy, see-through tops in front of her husband?  Why wouldn't Charlotte request that she dress a little more conservatively for her KIDS?Samantha is having a hard time with menopause, so she's taking desperate measures to keep herself young?  Um, haven't we already been there with Samantha?  And didn't she already get past that?  And did the writers really INTEND to imply that menopausal women will turn into vulgar, foul-mouthed, desperate wretches if left unmedicated? Because that certainly seems to be the takeaway message.  Samantha was always over-the-top, but in SATC2 she's positively repulsive.Miranda can't figure out how to balance home and work?  Um, again, haven't we already covered that?  And with her patient, successful husband and wonderful nanny, was it really that hard for her to figure out that she could just switch jobs?Carrie resents Big because he's gotten boring and wants to lie on the couch in the evening and watch TV?  Yet again, this is a topic already covered.  Remember the episode where Carrie wanted to go out and Aidan just wanted to sit at home and eat fried chicken in bed?  Now she has a doting husband and a wonderful life with plenty of exciting things going on.  Is it really so bad that Big wants to veg out and watch the Discovery Channel a couple of nights a week?  Are we really supposed to feel sorry for her?All the big ""problems"" in the movie are hardly vexing, and certainly won't induce any soul searching.  But for 2.5 hours you will have to sit there and be aghast at how very awful this movie is.  When it is over, you will think, ""There's 2.5 hours of my life I'll never get back.""

It reminds me of that episode of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" where Eddie and Patsy go to Morocco, intending to indulge in drugs, sex and decadent luxury.But while that episode was intended to MOCK aging fashionistas, ""Sex and the City 2"" instead tries to glorify them -- which is kind of annoying in a massive recession. The entire movie is basically a dragged out travelogue of a sparkly idealized Middle-East where the main characters can prance around in designer clothes, unencumbered by an actual plot or real problems.It opens first with a flashback to when the four protagonists met, followed by a wildly kitschy gay wedding (swans, choirs, Liza Minnelli) for two guys who have nothing to do with the rest of the movie.Instead we're treated to the woes of the main characters -- Sam (Kim Cattrall) is desperately staving off menopause, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is dealing with a sexist boss, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) has discovered that marriage isn't one long honeymoon, and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is struggling with a sexy nanny and the discovery that raising kids involves some self-sacrifice. Boohoo.So they do the logical thing: They go to Abu Dhabi, Carrie runs into an old boyfriend, and eventually they cause a culture clash... in the Middle East. SHOCK. Yes, that's pretty much the entire story.""Sex and the City 2"" is the worst thing a sequel can be -- totally superfluous. The ""Sex and the City"" series has never really been plot heavy, since it's all basically vicarious enjoyment of someone else's surreally luxurious life... but this movie is the cinematic equivalent of hearing someone ramble about their vacation, while being tortured by their photos.The entire movie is a tacky flurry of celebrity cameos (Miley Cyrus? Penelope Cruz?), designer dresses and painfully contrived problems (an old boyfriend who JUST HAPPENS to be in the same city as Carrie!). It's bad enough when we have to hear the women whining about real life intruding on their lives, but once they get to Abu Dhabi it becomes brain-numbing -- think cliche slapstick, lame dialogue and every Arab stereotype under the desert sun.Moreover, the movie feels DATED -- there are mentions of the recession the U.S. is mired in, but everybody is still wallowing in obscene luxury (only two vast apartments, oh woe!).

1309943,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,B002ZG98Z0,F. Gentile,"[8, 10]","I would like to preface this with a plea to Michael Patrick King: PLEASE stop making sequals to one of the greatest shows ever on HBO before you make me and many others start hating our ""girls.""  I have been a fan of the original series since it started, enough to buy the entire series and watch it from beginning to end at least twice a year. When the first movie came out, i was cautiously looking forward to seeing it, and after having done so, i can't say that I felt it was something I needed to see, but wasn't necessarily bored or offended either. I recently bought ""Sex 2"" months and months after its theater run, which gives an indication of my eagerness to see it. I regretted having done so. It was lousy. LOUSY script, totally unworthy of a series that had such a history of often brilliant  and always entertaining writing. I am not remotely into the ""chick flick"" genre, but ""Sex"" the series witty writing turned it into so much more than that. In ""2"",  there IS no witty writing, nor any story. It has all the look, albeit glitzy and over the top with production costs i'm sure, of a film made to make quick bucks on its weekend run, and subsequent quick bucks in rentals. Also missing was the  charm that made us fall in love with our ""girls"" to begin with. They are now spoiled materialistic unsatisfied brats that are never without designer frocks and stilettos, even when walking around their ridiculously opulent NYC pads. They may be wearing Manolo's, but having gained the world, their souls are missing. Their elitist and totally unrealistic (to but a few) lifestyles are nothing but obnoxious in this film. Perhaps Mr. King equates all this spoiled so-called glamour as equivilant to Fred and Ginger dancing off to Rio to cheer up the soup line folks in the depression, but fantasy is one thing,  in- your- face extravagance with characters we feel nothing for is another. It doesn't work. When our girls were looking for love and that perfect guy, they were characters that people could still identify with, and still deeply human. Now, as seen in this film,  it's like watching aliens. Speaking of aliens, the long time costume designer who looks like Betsy Johnson's mother on crack should be forced to wear the Jaclyn Smith collection for the rest of her life for creating the monstrosities the ladies wear in this film. She has succeeded in making our lovely girls look as unattractive as possible, sometimes bizarrely so. I have always defended Sarah J.P's distinctive and charming physical appearance, and took offense when she was criticised for not having the generically acceptable cookie cutter bland looks that American's seem to favor. Well, in this film, she has been made to look so atrocious that it's hard to defend. In the one particular get up she wears to Stanford's and Anthony's obnoxiously opulent, charmless, loveless wedding, she is wearing some sort of headdress that makes her look like  one of the gargoyles climbed down from The Dakota and crashed the reception,  she looks unbelievably unattractive. WHAT were these people thinking? And..the gay wedding. What one expected, after the initial shock of seeing the unlikely pairing of Stanford and Anthony, was a touching ceremony perhaps,  always with some humor, of course. That was a missed opportunity, and all we got were two obnoxious, materialistic queens who seemed to be making a business arrangement, making sure to leave an amendment for ""cheating.""  Throwing in the ultimate celebrity gay collectable, Liza Minelli, doing a cover of ""Single Ladies""  only makes it more improbable, and her performance is just plain creepy.  But, back to the ""fashion."" ...""Carrie"" said in the original series at one point..""It's time for ladies our age to cover it up.."" and the producers should have taken heed to that advice. Seeing Kim Catrell, an attractive lady who is obviously not 25 anymore, dressed in tacky body baring clothing that only accentuates her maturing body, is not enticing and only distasteful. Completely unflattering, and to be blunt, she  looks simply like an aging , desperate hooker, whom we should pity, when you don't want to slap her. All the girls (other than the Miranda character) are also the victims of some overzealous make-up fairy, they all look like drag queens, with make-up by ""Home Depot""...and look much older than their actual years...they border on hideous. All I will say about their obnoxious behaviour in the Arab Republic is that it is offensive in more ways than one can keep track of. They do try and wrap it all up in the end with Carrie supposedly realizing what's really important, but by then, it's too late to salvage this mess, and the viewer only wants to  ""Escape From New York."" This is a completely atrocious movie and a sad legacy for a series that had such charm, heart, and evoked such affection from so many people. All the best shows, Mary Tyler Moore, Six Feet Under, and many others, usually were lucky, and knew when to quit. Unfortunately, the ""Sex & The City"" powers that be did otherwise. So...As I did with any of the sequals after ""Aliens""...this one too will go in the trash where it belongs, and will be conveniently forgotten, leaving me to remember those adorable ladies as I would like to, not as they were portrayed in this piece of gilded garbage.

Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Big (Chris Noth) are married, but Big is more interested in watching TV than living the New York high life with Carrie. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is at the top of her professional game, but in need of lots of ""vitamins"" to keep the symptoms of menopause at bay. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is now a mom of two less than perfect children who are driving her crazy and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) hates her job at the law firm where she has worked like a dog to make partner. So the girls all go on the ultimate road trip - a one week all expenses paid trip to Abu Dhabi. I had high expectations of a great film. But something strange happened on the way to the Middle East.The sparkle that these characters once had didn't show up much and the whole movie seemed forced from beginning to end. As I sat there wondering what was missing, I realized that the characters were swallowed up by a storyline that went for fun over substance. The events were all so over-the-top that the characters were not allowed any space to develop. Even the clothes got lost in the backdrop of Abu Dhabi. Every so often I would see glimpses of the sparkle, like when Miranda got Charlotte drunk so she could admit that motherhood ain't all roses or when the girls karaoke to the girl power song of all time or when Samantha finally had it out with the uptight men of Abu Dhabi, but those moments were far too few.After two and a half hours, I left the theater thinking this movie just did not do the characters or the clothes justice. It was a cute movie, but I was so hoping for more. It's a shame really.

1309945,A2BPDFR58H9575,B002ZG98Z0,Galina,"[1, 7]","After watching the first movie Sex and the City (2008) two years ago, I wrote in my review that ""I wished Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda happy lives but I would not want another reunion. Their stories have been told."" Well, somebody decided that their stories still were worth exploring, and Sex and the City 2 hit the screens. I did not expect much but thought that the biggest, most glamorous, exotic, and outrageously soaked in the decadent luxury film with four defying age and laws of gravity Manhattan fashionistas best friends could be fun. And indeed, the Abu Dhabi scenes (filmed in Morocco) that take the central part of the movie are spectacular. The super star hotel where four friends were staying which I assume supposed to be Emirates Palace, the most expensive hotel ever built, is most certainly the star of the movie, THE PALACE where the luxury of the Arabian fairy tales combined with the efficiency and quality of services would satisfy the most jaded guest if he/she can afford $22,000 per night or has luck to stay as a guest of a Abu Dhabi's sheik. As always, the fashion site of Sex and the City is colorful, creative, and chic even if sometimes it looks totally out of place and silly. The dresses, bags, purses, accessories, shoes (salivates), the stunning jewelry designed to resemble the eastern patterns are all breathtaking. The problem is that the lavish abundance of all things glamorous could not hide the cruelty and weigh of time towards the foursome, and most sadly - to Carrie Bradshaw. I don't know what happened to Sara Jessica Parker's face - the plastic surgery went wrong or her makeup artist on the set held a serious grudge against her but watching her close-ups was a true torture. Parker may not have been a classic beauty in the past but she used to more than compensate with the charm, gentle voice, gorgeous hair, sparkling big eyes - something unique she had that made her cute and deservingly won her the part of Carrie Bradshaw in the hit HBO series. It is not the problem that even the most fashionable attractive women grow older and change as time goes by but Carrie Bradshaw has been a quintessential ""girl"", an embodiment of eternal femininity and desire. In the Sex and the City 2, she was the most attractive while hiding under the covers of the mid-eastern women clothing and stopping the taxi in the same exact fashion as Claudette Colbert in the B/W classic It happened one night. In the latest Sex and the City entry, her looks even contradict with the plot lines. Who would blame Mr. Big for wanting to spend two days a week apart from her to help the marriage work? Who would believe Aidan, who made a surprising appearance in the Abu Dhabi the same day Carrie was there, when he kept repeating in awe how great she looked? I did not. Ironically, both men looked great and have not changed a bit since the days of the show. Another thought came to my mind - for the film with sex and the City in its title, it has very little of both. If anything, the streets of New York City were missed. Of four women, only Samantha still was interested in sex (when she was able to gulp all the medications to fight with menopause), and often in the very wrong places.I don't regret having seen the film in the theater. Two of my friends and I went to the Cinema Cafe on Wacky Wednesday, and the tickets were only $3.50. The movie was fun while it lasted but in the end once again I want to wish four friends the happy lives and to say goodbye to them.

But those tidbits get buried in the embarrassingly extravagant production that reeks of misspent funds attempting to make the show a crowd pleaser.  It didn't work in the theaters and it doesn't seem to work on DVD.  It is especially sad to watch this self-indulgent film because there are some really fine actors involved.  Not only is the original quartet of high flying comediennes intact - Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall. Kristin Davis - but the leftover men - David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Jason Lewis, Chris Noth, John Corbett - are also pulled into the redux, each appearing a bit tired of the attempt to update what had been a good show.There is no real story: after an insulting wedding of tow gay men, Samantha is invited to Abu Dhabi  for a PR swing and of course she takes her girlfriends along, each of whom is having conflicts in their marriage or mothering status. The trip simply allows for the constant costume changes that are appallingly grotesque to be shown in contrast to the social mores of the Arab Emirates (burka wearing women contrasting with the flamboyant quartet) and many lessons on how to identify the old 'ugly American' tourist.  But of course, the trip's influence on the ladies makes them appreciate what their lives are truly like in New York...la la la.There are very brief appearances by Liza Minnelli, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz, Miley Cyrus, Tim Gunn etc that only seem to underscore the expensive budget of this Redux. If the viewer is able to get past these obstacles and hear the tiny bits of advice for women a la Carrie Bradshaw Preston's journalism, this can be an entertaining evening.

Well, they are not seeing it right (daft women).The majority of your sisters can easily enjoy something so smelly and sugar coated at the same time; like cream mixed with putrid; that forces their brains to heave with terror until the end, like an angry toilet, waiting to die. They will never understand that this colossal piece of nonsense paralysis all mental powers and turns all our sisters and daughters into prancing mannequins; who's only ground of existence is to enrich The Man.

Like a fetishistic spell excreted out of Oprah's bum, this Hollywood pap is a bone tossed to females and the females mistake it for their fellow sister! They even wheeled on Liza Minnelli for god's sake; I thought she was dead! And the gay clich&eacute;s found in here are the most absurd, uncaring and thoughtless misuse of gay people since man first put finger to pen. The depiction of both men and women are horrid, like a turd I think. Yes the cast are women, but look like old men dressed up as women, which is confusing, and I don't think you can get a metaphorical orgasm from shopping, no matter how clever the marketing, I reckon women are smarter than this (I don't really).

Lewis,"[2, 5]","The ""Sex in the City"" movies (and the HBO series) are excellent cultural documents of post-Giuliani gentrified Manhattan if looked at as satirical commentaries on a certain class of silly women of a certain age, and a particular type of equally silly, female-identified gay men who emulate them. The characters are excellent representatives of mindless consumerism that thinks of itself as stylish and cutting edge, of people incapable of sustaining a meaningful relationship who think of this as being independent, of shallow sexual antics that disguises itself as sexual empowerment, and of the class-aggressiveness of the professional middle classes (with a faint whiff of racist exclusion manifest by the papacy of non-white faces in a majority-minority city) that masquerades as urban sophistication. It captures these realities of contemporary Manhattan perfectly, to which may be added similar scenes in Washington, D.C., Centre City Philadelphia, the Castro in San Francisco and several other trendy urban environments. The film itself is of course silly, but that's beside the point. It is a major artifact of the current moment in big city America, the way ""The French Connection"" captured the urban decay and grittiness of the 1970s. Anyone interested in this phenomenon should definitely see this film, then take a stroll though the far west side of Chelsea, or Login Circle in Washington, or down Market in Phili, et. al. It'll be enlightening as well as a good laugh; just make sure you're laughing at these scenes and people and not with them.",5,Gentrified Manhattan in the Flesh,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,1558,"['Sex', 'City', 'movies', 'HBO', 'series', 'are', 'excellent', 'cultural', 'documents', 'post-Giuliani', 'gentrified', 'Manhattan', 'looked', 'as', 'satirical', 'commentaries', 'certain', 'class', 'silly', 'women', 'certain', 'age', 'particular', 'type', 'equally', 'silly', 'female-identified', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'emulate', 'characters', 'are', 'excellent', 'representatives', 'mindless', 'consumerism', 'stylish', 'cutting', 'edge', 'people', 'incapable', 'sustaining', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'who', 'think', 'being', 'independent', 'shallow', 'sexual', 'antics', 'sexual', 'empowerment', 'class-aggressiveness', 'professional', 'middle', 'classes', 'faint', 'whiff', 'racist', 'exclusion', 'manifest', 'papacy', 'non-white', 'majority-minority', 'city', 'urban', 'sophistication', 'realities', 'contemporary', 'Manhattan', 'perfectly', 'may', 'be', 'added', 'similar', 'scenes', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Centre', 'City', 'Philadelphia', 'Castro', 'San', 'Francisco', 'several', 'other', 'trendy', 'urban', 'environments', 'film', 'course', 'silly', 'beside', 'point', 'major', 'artifact', 'current', 'moment', 'big', 'city', 'America', 'way', 'French', 'Connection', 'captured', 'urban', 'decay', 'grittiness', '1970s', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'phenomenon', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'film', 'then', 'take', 'stroll', 'far', 'west', 'side', 'Chelsea', 'Login', 'Circle', 'Washington', 'down', 'Market', 'Phili', 'et', 'al', ""'ll"", 'be', 'enlightening', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'laugh', 'just', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'laughing', 'scenes', 'people', 'not']",N/A

If it's got more bored and wondering when on earth this thing will end at any point in the movie then I'm not too happy.That's the problem I have with the first movie -- a lot of drama (actually, TOO much drama) early in the film and then it tones down into this depressing period and the pace is so darn slow at that point that I just can't wait for the end to be over.  Honestly, even though I know what happens its hard for me to even watch that movie because of that dragging period in the middle.Thank goodness that this movie doesn't have that.  There's no extreme ridiculous drama that involves breakups or extreme depression.  It's just a simply ""hang out with your girlfriends kind of movie"".  Plus, you get to go with them on a trip to the middle east AND you get to see Aidan!  And no, I didn't find Aidan coming in ridiculous... just a nice extra touch.  I also didn't find it culturally insensitive either (and this is coming from someone who has lived abroad).  It simply expresses the culture from an American female perspective... I wouldn't really expect much different.  It can (and does) happen the other way around too. I don't see any egocentricity in it, honestly.What I honestly really did like was Charlotte and Miranda having their problems with the life of being a mother (Miranda struggling to balance it with work and Charlotte simply handling the stress of her youngest crying constantly).  I felt it just really expressed the reality of it and then showed the need to take some time out and spend it with your girlfriends when everything's going crazy.That being said, I also liked Carrie and Big's discussion about possibly taking two days off a week to go do their own thing without each other.  It's new, it's different, it's very non-conventional, yet it's also a very very real possibility in current and future marriages to keep things working and to have that ""sparkle"".Overall, I really liked this movie because it had a good even pace throughout and because the topics that came up were real... and can encourage one to contemplate on they want their marriage to really be.",5,"Contrary to others opinions, I liked this movie more than the first one!",1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,2168,"['When', 'movies', ""'m"", 'generally', 'pace', 'got', 'more', 'bored', 'wondering', 'when', 'earth', 'thing', 'will', 'end', 'point', 'movie', 'then', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'happy.That', 'problem', 'have', 'first', 'movie', 'lot', 'drama', 'actually', 'TOO', 'much', 'drama', 'early', 'film', 'then', 'down', 'depressing', 'period', 'pace', 'so', 'darn', 'slow', 'point', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'end', 'be', 'Honestly', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'hard', 'even', 'watch', 'movie', 'dragging', 'period', 'middle.Thank', 'goodness', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'extreme', 'ridiculous', 'drama', 'breakups', 'extreme', 'depression', 'just', 'simply', 'hang', 'out', 'girlfriends', 'kind', 'movie', 'get', 'go', 'trip', 'middle', 'east', 'AND', 'get', 'see', 'Aidan', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Aidan', 'coming', 'ridiculous', 'just', 'nice', 'extra', 'touch', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'culturally', 'insensitive', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'abroad', 'simply', 'culture', 'American', 'female', 'perspective', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'much', 'different', 'can', 'happen', 'other', 'way', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'egocentricity', 'honestly.What', 'honestly', 'really', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'Charlotte', 'Miranda', 'having', 'problems', 'life', 'being', 'mother', 'Miranda', 'struggling', 'balance', 'work', 'Charlotte', 'simply', 'handling', 'stress', 'youngest', 'crying', 'constantly', 'felt', 'just', 'really', 'expressed', 'reality', 'then', 'showed', 'need', 'take', 'time', 'out', 'spend', 'girlfriends', 'when', 'everything', 'going', 'crazy.That', 'being', 'said', 'also', 'liked', 'Carrie', 'Big', 'discussion', 'possibly', 'taking', 'two', 'days', 'week', 'go', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'other', 'new', 'different', 'very', 'non-conventional', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'real', 'possibility', 'current', 'future', 'marriages', 'keep', 'things', 'working', 'have', 'sparkle', '.Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'even', 'pace', 'topics', 'came', 'up', 'were', 'real', 'can', 'encourage', 'one', 'contemplate', 'want', 'marriage', 'really', 'be']",N/A

1309967,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,B002ZG98Z0,Jody,"[9, 14]","SATC has never disappointed.  I've liked some characters and plot lines better than others, and I really didn't like the first SATC movie very much, but no matter how I've felt about the stories, the writing has been tight, the plotting elegant, and the acting wonderful.  That said, I loved SATC2. Really. Funny, campy and endearing, it pulls out all the stops on everything that's made SATC so good and its fans so loyal and added a few things that were unexpectedly sweet.Seriously folks, this movie is almost worth seeing for the opening scene alone when we get the backstories about how our favorite BFFs first met and we get to see them in their 1980s incarnations.  This lasts but a moment though, and then the ladies in their current, sleekly confident personas are gathering to go pick out wedding presents for former enemies Stanford and Anthony who are OMG getting married in Connecticut because it's legal there.  The second reason to see this movie is for the wedding.  It's high camp, just what you'd want if you were Anthony and Stanford and just when Samantha says, ""Could this wedding be any ---er?"" out comes Liza Minelli. Ahahahaha. In other news, the wedding provides an opportunity to find out what everyone's been up to for two years.Uh oh.  Each of our girls is having a crisis. Two years into their marriage, Carrie is distressed because all Big wants to do is stay home, eat takeout and watch TV.  Not only that, but he thinks he needs two days off a week to do whatever he wants. Carrie's not quite certain how she feels about that but is pretty sure it's a good thing they never sold her apartment. Sidebar:  Big has a last name.  It's Preston.  Charlotte is finding out that motherhood is just plain exhausting, even with a nanny and speaking of the nanny, she's worried that Harry is going to go all Jude Law on her.  Samantha is horrified because she seems to have lost interest in her favorite pastime and is applying so many creams and taking so many vitamins it's amazing she has time to work. Miranda's boss at the law firm (played by the hilarious Ron White) is so opposed to hearing anything she has to say he actually puts his hand up to cut her off when she tries to speak at meetings.  Things ain't rosy for anyone.Enter salvation in the form of Samantha's previous squeeze Smith who's just finished filming a movie in Abu Dhabi.  He brags all over the place to the Sheikh about how much Samantha did for his career and the Sheikh thinks, hmmm. Maybe this Samantha Jones can put Abu Dhabi on the map.Say what?Anyway the Sheikh offers to send Sam and her three bffs to his 'hood for a week, all expenses paid.  Let the fantasy vacation commence.  It does.  The only thing is--of all the spice souks in all the world, Aidan just happens to walk into Carrie's.  They have dinner.  Uh oh. Oh dear.  What will happen?  Things are looking up, extremely up, for Samantha, until her hot date with a hot architect or something like that turns extremely ugly in a slapstick kind of way.  Miranda and Charlotte get to spend some quality time together discussing motherhood and of course there's shopping, fashion (some more successful than others) and camels. I can't say more without spoilage, and not for anything would I ruin this movie for anyone.What's endearing about SATC2 and why I liked it better than the first one is because it contains elements everyone can relate to, much more than either the series or the first movie.  This is a SATC of the bad economy, ageism (Miley Cyrus' cameo is priceless) and coping with the ennui of everyday life.  It's not afraid to poke fun at itself and does so with clever dialogue and plot twists.  It's an ambitious movie--at just under two and a half hours, it had better have a lot to say--and it delivers.  It's thoughtful and if some of the plot elements are a bit thin, that's OK because suspending disbelief has always been an essential component of enjoying SATC.  (How did those women eat and drink so much and stay so thin?) The nice thing is that it has a happy ending, everyone's life is better, problems resolved and best of all, everybody's still friends.  If you're not a fan of SATC, don't go see this movie.  If you are, you'll love the inside jokes, the familiar characters and the shoes.",5,"Slyly sassy, and sorta sweet.

For me, the first half of this movie - while 'the girls' were still in NYC - worked. The story lines established there for each of them felt character-relevant and age-appropriate: Carrie - working to define a childfree new kind of marriage for herself and Big, Miranda - struggling with work/life balance and an authoritarian boss, Samantha - facing (or facing down) menopause, and Charlotte - dealing with the challenges of motherhood. The gay wedding scene was a little over the top for me, and many of the character comments too, but the show always had that over-the-top, slightly slapstick element at times, so I could let it slide.Once the girls went to Abu Dubai though, it was all downhill. Why, why, why? And who, who, who thought this was a good idea? The setting (and plot) were just too unreal, the girls got whiny and started feeling false, Carrie's meet-up with Aiden was beyond absurd, and some of the commentary on middle eastern culture, and especially the role of women, didn't ring true and made me squirm in discomfort.

When the first movie came out, I saw it on the big screen, and thoroughly enjoyed it. That said, I have to say that this sequel, left me unsatisfied on many levels.First Level: Samantha's character (that unconventional, brave, brassy creature we all loved) has morphed into a crude, desperate caricature of a menopausal woman, and talk about being unsatisfied, the writers of S&C2; beat to death the point that Samantha ""can't get no satisfaction.""  There is a scene at the end of the movie that makes poor Kim Cattrall seem crazed and totally out of control. (Remember when that's what society thought of ALL menopausal women?) Insulting.Next level: Carrie. Once cute and quirky, but still insightful, this character now seems to be aging ungracefully, and also somewhat desperately. More whine than shine, and the insight into relationships that made us love her have evaporated into the dry desert air.Final level: Charlotte and Miranda's characters in the film were no longer the stable ones, but instead, suddenly immature and somewhat silly.Other quick points: It was nice to see the girls together again. The scenery was great. Fashion not so great, and too young for the women wearing it.Story line not even close to believable.I really wanted to love this movie, and I'd still recommend it to die-hard fans (just for old-times sake), but for other viewers, it may fall far short of your expectations.",3,Sex and The City 2-Much,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,1520,"['was', 'fan', 'Sex', 'City', 'series', 'saw', 'episode', 'even', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'watch', 'again', 'When', 'first', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'said', 'have', 'say', 'sequel', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'many', 'levels.First', 'Level', 'Samantha', 'character', 'unconventional', 'brave', 'brassy', 'creature', 'loved', 'morphed', 'crude', 'desperate', 'caricature', 'menopausal', 'woman', 'talk', 'being', 'unsatisfied', 'writers', 'S', 'C2', 'beat', 'death', 'point', 'Samantha', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'satisfaction', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'poor', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'seem', 'crazed', 'totally', 'control', 'Remember', 'when', 'what', 'society', 'thought', 'ALL', 'menopausal', 'women', 'Insulting.Next', 'level', 'Carrie', 'Once', 'cute', 'quirky', 'still', 'insightful', 'character', 'now', 'be', 'aging', 'ungracefully', 'also', 'somewhat', 'desperately', 'More', 'whine', 'shine', 'insight', 'relationships', 'made', 'love', 'have', 'evaporated', 'dry', 'desert', 'air.Final', 'level', 'Charlotte', 'Miranda', 'characters', 'film', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'stable', 'ones', 'instead', 'suddenly', 'immature', 'somewhat', 'silly.Other', 'quick', 'points', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'girls', 'together', 'again', 'scenery', 'was', 'great', 'Fashion', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'too', 'young', 'women', 'wearing', 'it.Story', 'line', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'believable.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'movie', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'just', 'old-times', 'sake', 'other', 'viewers', 'may', 'fall', 'far', 'short', 'expectations']",N/A

The wealth and materialism exhibited and glorified is nauseating really. So nauseating in fact that you cannot possibly take it seriously. The girls are obscenely wealthy, have equally obscenely wealthy life styles and there is not one person in this movie who is real. It seems like in the world of Sex and the City, there are no ordinary people - everyone is a page out of ""Vogue"" magazine.Carrie has exactly what she wanted with Big, who somehow lost his spunk ever since he confessed his loyalty to her at the end of the series. He is docile and quiet and acts like a neutered, obedient pet who just nods agreeably every time. It is kind of pathetic actually. Carrie herself has not accomplished anything really. All she seems to have been doing over the years is shopping and going to movie premieres and high-society parties. Charlotte is the same spoiled brat who makes cookies in vintage Valentino skirts and can always find something to whine about - even when she both objectively and subjectively got everything most people could only dream of. Miranda has lost a lot of her edge and cynicism, which made her interesting and endearing and instead she has turned into Charlotte. Urgh. The only one who hasnt changed and still has the morals of a pornstar after a 600 man gangbang, is Samantha. But she too is annoying at best and has turned into a caricature of herself, juts like all of the characters. None of the thoughtfulness, wit, and vulnerability we got to know and love all these years. It seems like the writers just picked a few themes (like fashion, shoes, the extravagant life-stlye, the man-chasing etc) and blew them up into gigantic circus-sized objects and written a story around them. Everything and everyone is faker than the silicon and Botox drowning Hollywood.Sex and the City was always a champion for the single gals, the power of single, successful women who know what they want and are not willing to compromise it so they fit under some label. Yet in what has become the conclusion to their stories, they all got a man (except for the one who never wanted one) - and did what they had to to finally fit under the label; which basically tells me that all the talk about not needing a man and being an independent woman was just that: talk until the waiting period is over and they all have a man, so that life and happiness can finally begin. Yipeee...That being said, I must admit I dont understand people who dump on this movie, somehow expecting depth, a plot and character development. Come on. This movie is about materialism and the best clothes, friends, houses, china and vacation spots a man's cold hard cash can buy. That's what it's always been about. Even the writers admit that no real-life person could afford Carrie Bradshaw's lifestyle and couture choices. Four dollars a word in a 250 word column and shopping Manolo Blahnik's at 600 a pop every week? Come on. They never made a secret of that. Michael Patrick King in the DVD commentary for Season 4 said they often show close-up shots of the shoes because they know that's what the audience wants to see - straight or queer. So give me a break and stop trying to make of this movie what it isn't.I watch it for the sheer aesthetic pleasure of it all and so should anyone else. It is entertaining, like a live fashion show in Milan and as a fashion aficionado myself, I was delighted with the fashions, styles and coutures presented. If you expect some awesome movie with an actual story and believable characters, or a message even, then skip this one. The audience for this movie are funky women who love fashion and gay men who love watching these funky women sport these fashions. This movie is not social commentary of any kind or is about anything really. Its superficiality and materialism, the main protagonists of this movie, are hidden under nothing but a thin veneer of fake and misplaced emotional struggles by a bunch of narcissistic, supremely fake, vain and vacuous individuals.",3,"Dumb, Uncreative, Superficial -  Two Dimensional Characters Posing as real People in Improbable Situations",1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,4172,"['Sex', 'City', '2', 'just', 'predecessor', 'one', 'end-less', 'commercial', 'haute-couture', 'kind', 'lifestyle', 'be', 'found', 'Lifestyle', 'Rich', 'Famous', 'wealth', 'materialism', 'exhibited', 'glorified', 'nauseating', 'really', 'So', 'nauseating', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'take', 'seriously', 'girls', 'are', 'obscenely', 'wealthy', 'have', 'equally', 'obscenely', 'wealthy', 'life', 'styles', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'movie', 'who', 'real', 'world', 'Sex', 'City', 'are', 'ordinary', 'people', 'everyone', 'page', 'Vogue', 'magazine.Carrie', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'Big', 'who', 'somehow', 'lost', 'spunk', 'ever', 'confessed', 'loyalty', 'end', 'series', 'docile', 'quiet', 'acts', 'neutered', 'obedient', 'pet', 'who', 'just', 'nods', 'agreeably', 'time', 'kind', 'pathetic', 'actually', 'Carrie', 'not', 'accomplished', 'anything', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'shopping', 'going', 'movie', 'premieres', 'high-society', 'parties', 'Charlotte', 'same', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'who', 'cookies', 'vintage', 'Valentino', 'skirts', 'can', 'always', 'find', 'something', 'whine', 'even', 'when', 'objectively', 'subjectively', 'got', 'everything', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'Miranda', 'lost', 'lot', 'edge', 'cynicism', 'made', 'interesting', 'endearing', 'instead', 'turned', 'Charlotte', 'Urgh', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'changed', 'still', 'morals', 'pornstar', '600', 'man', 'gangbang', 'Samantha', 'too', 'annoying', 'best', 'turned', 'caricature', 'herself', 'juts', 'characters', 'None', 'thoughtfulness', 'wit', 'vulnerability', 'got', 'know', 'love', 'years', 'writers', 'just', 'picked', 'few', 'themes', 'fashion', 'shoes', 'extravagant', 'life-stlye', 'man-chasing', 'etc', 'blew', 'up', 'gigantic', 'circus-sized', 'objects', 'written', 'story', 'Everything', 'everyone', 'faker', 'silicon', 'Botox', 'drowning', 'Hollywood.Sex', 'City', 'was', 'always', 'champion', 'single', 'gals', 'power', 'single', 'successful', 'women', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'are', 'not', 'willing', 'compromise', 'so', 'fit', 'label', 'become', 'conclusion', 'stories', 'got', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'never', 'wanted', 'one', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'finally', 'fit', 'label', 'basically', 'talk', 'not', 'needing', 'man', 'being', 'independent', 'woman', 'was', 'just', 'talk', 'waiting', 'period', 'have', 'man', 'life', 'happiness', 'can', 'finally', 'begin', 'Yipeee', 'being', 'said', 'must', 'admit', 'dont', 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'dump', 'movie', 'somehow', 'expecting', 'depth', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'Come', 'movie', 'materialism', 'best', 'clothes', 'friends', 'houses', 'china', 'vacation', 'spots', 'man', 'cold', 'hard', 'cash', 'can', 'buy', 'what', 'always', 'been', 'Even', 'writers', 'admit', 'real-life', 'person', 'could', 'afford', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'lifestyle', 'couture', 'choices', 'Four', 'dollars', 'word', '250', 'word', 'column', 'shopping', 'Manolo', 'Blahnik', '600', 'pop', 'week', 'Come', 'never', 'made', 'secret', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Season', '4', 'said', 'often', 'show', 'close-up', 'shots', 'shoes', 'know', 'what', 'audience', 'see', 'straight', 'queer', 'So', 'give', 'break', 'stop', 'trying', 'make', 'movie', 'what', 'watch', 'sheer', 'aesthetic', 'pleasure', 'so', 'should', 'anyone', 'else', 'entertaining', 'live', 'fashion', 'show', 'Milan', 'fashion', 'aficionado', 'was', 'delighted', 'fashions', 'styles', 'coutures', 'presented', 'expect', 'awesome', 'movie', 'actual', 'story', 'believable', 'characters', 'message', 'even', 'then', 'skip', 'one', 'audience', 'movie', 'are', 'funky', 'women', 'who', 'love', 'fashion', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'love', 'watching', 'funky', 'women', 'sport', 'fashions', 'movie', 'not', 'social', 'commentary', 'kind', 'anything', 'really', 'superficiality', 'materialism', 'main', 'protagonists', 'movie', 'are', 'hidden', 'nothing', 'thin', 'veneer', 'fake', 'misplaced', 'emotional', 'struggles', 'bunch', 'narcissistic', 'supremely', 'fake', 'vain', 'vacuous', 'individuals']",N/A

1309998,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B002ZG98Z0,M. Bullions,"[7, 12]","Let me start out by saying, that I am a Sex and the City fanatic. A Carrie Bradshaw groupie. A Sex and the City nut. So, when I awoke on the morning of May, the twenty-seventh, in the year two thousand and ten, I knew I was in for a treat. Reading the early critical pans didn't particularly bother me, since I have faith in the genius writer-director Michael Patrick King, and my longtime love for these four iconic characters. I was happy to hear that the movie was going to be a little longer than your average chick-flick, since the first one was as well. I knew in a time frame of 145 minutes, a fabulous story built on love, friendship and adventure could be fabulously executed. I was excited to see how these girls were doing, not only in their lives, but by means of fashion. I was psyched to see each character's 50+ wardrobe changes. I can't help but be slightly materialistic when it comes to this series, that built itself on timeless style and elegance.So, when I arrived at the sold-out theater for the 7:05 evening show, with my tickets pre-ordered, I was told to wait in a line that went around the theatre. As I was talking to nuts like myself, about what we expected in the film, I noticed a general feeling of excitement and happiness, that our two-year wait for an update with these legendary characters was finally over.And let me tell you, my friends, I wasn't disappointed. I, for one, believe that these ladies, and these filmmakers can do no wrong. There were a few things that I would have done differently, but that goes for any film. The Sex and the City films do what a good film is supposed to do. You don't have to get yourself in the mood for this film, because, as you watch it, it puts you in the proper mindset, and feeling that it is trying to convey, and you feel as if you're catching up with an old group of friends who you haven't seen in far too long.Sarah Jessica Parker, once again, owns the role of Carrie, who has been happily married for the past two years, to Mr. Big (Chris Noth), and while still being very in love, they realize that such a dramatic change (marriage) can really change who you are in more ways than one. One thing I liked, in particular, about this one, are the marriage squabbles that Carrie and Big suffer through, are not unrealistic, (she wants to go out; he wants to stay in), and they're relatable for much of the audience, and these characters still seem like real people, who are still grounded in reality.Cynthia Nixon's Miranda seems alot different in this film, than she was in the first one. She was the hard-headed cynic, through most of the series, and the first film, but in this one, she quits her job, and seems alot more bubbly and effervescent, which is a worrisome change, but it makes sense, through all the misery she encountered in the previous installments, that it's about time this character was happy.Kristin Davis' Charlotte seems alot different in this film as well, which, isn't a case of sloppy writing, but a situation of character growth, and change. She's now a mother of two, a six year old Lily, and two-year-old Rose. She is extremely exhausted in her new life. She has an attractive nanny who she's terrified her husband will cheat with, which leads her to things like locking herself in the closet, and crying. The character of Charlotte, in the series, wanted nothing more than a normal life, of being a wife and mother, but she wanted true love, and happiness. Now, motherhood has thrown her for a curve-ball, and her life has changed, which happens to us all.However, Kim Cattrall's Samantha, is exactly the same. After dumping her boyfriend Smith, of five years, she's back in her fabulous life, that she knows and loves. As a fan, you want a happy ending for Samantha, but you know that she's not going to stay with it for very long, because she isn't meant to. In this one, she's suffering, taking forty-four supplements a day, to essentially fight off menopause, which is something that much of the audience can relate to, obviously, and her timeless antics are never-ending, and Cattrall once again steals the show as the most overzealous one of the bunch.In the film, Samantha takes all four girls on an all-expenses paid vacation to Abu Dhabi, where a hotel owner wants Samantha as their PR representative. This sequence is much better than the Mexico sequence in the first one, because it kind of has to be. This sequence is much longer than that one, and there's surprisingly alot of fun to be had, even in the desert. A scene where all four girls are walking across the Sahara dunes, with a variation of the theme song, playing in the background, gave me a feeling that I'll never forget. In this sequence, there also is a very memorable scene in which all four ladies sing a karaoke cover of Helen Reddy's ""I Am Woman"" in an Abu Dhabi nightclub. It's fun, and silly, and completely exhilarating. One of my only problems with this one, is that too much of it is set in Abu Dhabi. The series always referred to New York as its ""fifth lady"", and it felt like they were in the middle east for too much of the film.Another thing that bugged me was, the first film had an ending with all four ladies at a nightclub, and it felt permanent. This one has a good enough ending, but a different ending. I wanted an ending similar to the first one, which makes me hope that this isn't the last we'll see of these girls. There's still much more of them to be seen, and I dearly hope that we'll be able to see them AT LEAST one more time on the big screen.",5,Very satisfying for fans of the series!,1277856000,"06 30,

1309999,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B002ZG98Z0,Melissa Niksic,"[172, 213]","""Sex and the City 2"" has nothing on the HBO series and isn't nearly as good as the first film. However, as a huge fan of the franchise, I still enjoyed it because I got to see the girls on the big screen.This film picks up two years after the first ""SATC"" movie. Carrie and Big are married and still living in NYC, but Carrie's afraid they're in a bit of a rut. Meanwhile, Samantha is struggling with menopause, Miranda's irritated with her new boss, and Charlotte's kids are driving her crazy. When Samantha lands an all-expenses paid trip for all four girls to enjoy a week of luxury accommodations in Abu Dhabi, all four women are thrilled at the chance to escape from reality for a little while. During the trip, Carrie is shocked to run into her ex-fiance, Aidan, in the middle of a Middle Eastern marketplace. How will this chance encounter affect her relationship with Big? Watch the movie to find out.Here are some of the pros and cons of the movie. (Warning: I'm going to go into some spoilers that weren't included in the movie trailers.)PROS+ It's another ""SATC"" movie! If you love the girls, you will enjoy this movie at least a bit. How could you not?!+ Although there was some Big/Carrie drama, it was refreshing that everything stemmed from Carrie's behavior this time. For once, Mr. Big didn't do something massively awful to screw the relationship up, which was refreshing to see.+ The gay wedding was super over-the-top and ridiculous, but very funny to watch. It was also hilarious to see who was getting married (I won't spoil that surprise for you!).+ Yes, some of the Abu Dhabi scenes were a little much, but I loved the luxury hotel scenes, and when Samantha started flashing condoms and screaming ""Bite me!"" to an angry mob of religious men, I wanted to applaud.+ The girls get up and sing karaoke! And they do a good job! Who knew Kim Cattrall could sing so well?!+The biggest pro for me...THANK GOD the film didn't feel the need to give Carrie and Big a freakin' baby. I am so sick and tired of society telling people that they need children in order to lead happy and fulfilled lives. Carrie and Big have a great relationship, a gorgeous home, and a rich life together. My husband and I are also child-free, and we get so many odd reactions from people when we have to explain that not having kids is our choice. I could very much relate to that scene with Carrie, Big, and the other married couple at the gay wedding, and I'm so glad the producers handled this issue the way they did.CONS- Unlike the first ""SATC"" movie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda really took a backseat to Carrie in this film. Their respective subplots were all glossed over and were mainly used as filler material, which was disappointing.- With the exception of Mr. Big, the other supporting characters like Steve and Smith only had about two minutes of screen time each, which was another bummer.- The girls are still sexy and the clothes are still great. I love Kim Cattrall and I think she's gorgeous, but Samantha is supposed to be 52 years old now, and some of her outfits and makeup kind of made her look like a drag queen. It was very sad. Women can be sexy at any age, but that doesn't mean they can pull off any and every look.- Another character that wasn't featured in the film as much as it should have been was New York City! The city itself was such a central focus of the series and of the first movie. I don't think this film did it justice at all.- I enjoyed the gay wedding, but Liza Minnelli singing Beyonce's ""Single Ladies"" was too much. Seriously. All through the number, I kept whispering, ""Make it stop!""- We all know that ""SATC"" is all about over-the-top fashions, but this movie took things  a new level of extreme. On several occasions when Carrie stepped out in a crazy ensemble, everyone in the theatre could be heard muttering, ""Seriously?!""- Why did Aidan have to show up?! Sorry, but I have always been on Team Big. I though this Middle Eastern run-in was super unrealistic.

Newman,"[6, 9]","I read some of the critical reviews and the one theme that seemed prevelent is that this movie is 2 and a half hours and seems like you can't wait for it to end.  I never felt that way about this film and actually enjoyed the movie up until the very end.Even the wedding at the beginning was a lot of fun with Carrie being forced to wear a tuxedo because she is the best ""man"" at Stan's wedding to Mario Cantone.  Our question gets answered that we thought they hated each other but as they got older, they were left with no one else but each other.Goofy Charlotte seems to be happy with her nanny and her children until Samantha tells her to watch out because the nanny doesn't wear a bra which makes Harry very happy.  All of a sudden Charlotte's world is thrown upside down and every second she is fixated on Harry possibly cheating with the nanny.There are some really funny parts to the film like Samantha thinking she is not too old for a dress to Smith's premiere that Miley Cirrus also wears.  The girls get whisked of in the luxury of a private jet that each seem to get their own virtual apartment in.  They end up in the UAE at one of the most impressive hotels on the planet with their own private butlers and cars.Carrie and Big (John) have become a ""bored"" married couple and try to find ways to rekindle what they had even if it means Big will stay at Carrie's old apartment by himself a couple of days a week.Just about all the characters from the HBO show make a appearance in the movie including Carrie's old flame Aiden (but what happened to Jennifer Hudson?).  Will Carrie end up going to Aiden or will she be able to work out her issues with Big?Then we have Miranda being treated badly by her boss who puts his hand in her face at meetings while giving away her clients to a male lawyer.  She is so involved with this abusive boss's work demands that she has all but forgotten anything her son has at school.The movie is full of some enjoyable minor characters such as Carrie's private butler who works real hard so he can purchase a plane ticket to see his wife every three months.  We also see how veiled Moslem women can eat french fries.Don't believe the critics.

Not sure if non-fans will ""get it"" and at 2 1/2 hours long, it may drag a bit for them. It didn't drag for me at all. Loved seeing the many many outfits...some beautiful, some ridiculous (Carrie's petticoat with the ""J'Adore Dior"" t-shirt)...but all fun fun fun to see.I was amazed at the frank commentary in the movie re: women's status. Samantha literally and figuratively gives the conservative Arabian culture the finger because of the people's disapproval. Samantha's slutty American expression of her sexuality (or even a man and woman touching hands in public) is certainly forbidden there, where our girls are shocked and amazed that the Arabian women have to ""lift their veils to eat French fries...lift, fry. Lift, fry.""Quibbles: I hated the muted music that runs through every dialogue scene, like a Disney movie for grownups, with mood music constantly in the background. With the exception of Big, all the familiar men in our girls' lives had almost cameo appearances, with a ""I'm Here for The Big Reunion!"" kinds of looks on their faces.

They had to make up ways to get all the important supporting characters in just to make fans happy.Who bought the Stanford & Anthony wedding?  Nope.  Said in the movie they did NOT like each other in the series, you can buy  them becoming friends because they were friends with the girls.  Then the over the top wedding?Made up reasons to bring Smith (Jerry) and Adian back.  Bringing in 15 minutes about up Cyrus.  NO BUSINESS IN THE FILM.Carrie & John storyline.  Wrong to have a TV in the bed room, this was the best they could do?The reason Samantha  got the free trip?  She was NOT sleeping with any of the men to get it so another do NOT buy the story line.  They did NOT like Los Angeles but loved the Middle East  until the Samantha storyline.Then they came up with seen a million times so called plot twists before they got out of the Middle East.The much talked about ""flashback"".  Not worth the VERY BRIEF camera time.Film too long.The storyline with Charlotte's nanny.  WHO OTHER THAN TO GET A STORY IDEA WOULD LET THEIR NANNY DRESS LIKE THAT ON THE JOB?  No one.

I like the characters themselves, not just the fashion. I thought the first movie concentrated too much on the clothes and not the people. I thought so much of the last one focused on the clothes...they never did that in the show too frequently. The fashion was there then, but it wasn't really the point. Okay, the Lucy Liu Birkin bag episode, the Blahnik Sedaraby shoe shame, maybe the Roberto Cavalli shredded dress, the ruined Louboutins, the scrunchie...the items were prominently featured, but they didn't really focus on them too too much over the story.This film did seem to focus more on the interplay of the girls rather than the objects, I liked that. The wedding at the beginning seemed like it didn't really fit at all....almost like I was watching one episode of the show, then the movie begins. I did miss ""the City""...I mean, much of the film is the girls in Abu Dhabi, which was fun for a while, but....meh. I wasn't sure if they were trying to make us LIKE the UAE, or dislike it (but I certainly don't want to go there now!) Still, I mostly wanted the girls AND New York.Overall, I did think there was more interaction with the girls, and I liked that. The story was unusual and even seemed forced at times. I never really thought Aidan went together very well, so it was odd to bring him back. And the behavior of each girl seemed too ""themselves"" even too much of their own stereotypes, they never seemed to break out of that much...which is when it gets interesting (like when Charlotte gets a little wild or Miranda gets emotional, etc.) But for some reason, they seemed like more like the girls I knew and loved all those years ago.

I couldn't wait for this mess to end and practically ran out of the theater.  After producing such a gem of a tv series it is utterly perplexing to think that Michael Patrick King had anything to do with such a  horrible picture.  The characters have been damaged - ruined.It is a real shame that there was no ""city"" in the movie.  Hello!  the name of the movie - Sex and the City - why would you need to have the girls trek out to the Middle East - to avoid the city???  I still can't wrap my head around it.Anybody hear of a plotline?  Practically essential for any good movie - well, I couldn't find anything that even remotely resembled a storyline.  To sum it all up - nothing happened - the end.  There were such excellent opportunities here - watching Carrie navigate married life.

I'm a fan of the original HBO series and even though that show didn't exactly do much for empowering women, it was still a guilty pleasure of mine. After all, there's nothing wrong with girls enjoying fashion, makeup, fabulous lifestyles in fabulous places, and MEN... Even if some negative stereotypes separating the genders were still enforced even if the show supposedly broke boundaries.The first movie was unnecessary, in my opinion, and this second movie is even less necessary. And yet, I willed myself to see them both -- it's just something one has to do if you're a fan of the show, and the makers of these films were definitely banking on the original fan base to sell this mess. It's clear the writers are different for this movie compared to the original show, because even though Carrie is just as lame with her stupid puns (which she THINKS are so clever) in this movie, the ""wittiness"" in these movies is more just for the sake of having some jokes rather than having the witticisms be part of Carrie's personality.*** spoilers ***I thought it was inconsistent with the characters' personalities that Steve would cheat on Miranda and they'd break up. I don't know if other people think differently, but that's just the way the movie hit me.

Nothing shocking, though it tries to be. It's just all familiar, tired ground, and not interesting.-- and the karaoke scene!

The show wasn't afraid to explore taboo subjects.  Carrie Bradshaw played the part of ""Tour Guide"" in both asking the tough questions and taking the audience on a fun journey to find answers.  That being said, this movie completely missed the mark.  First, as many other posters have pointed out, there is no plot.  There's no burning question that Carrie is searching to answer.  Second, the girls have an opportunity to visit a country that has a very different view of women...and what could have made for a prime writing opportunity for Carrie, was completely ignored.  In reality, the government of Abu Dhabi wouldn't even let them film in their country...How different and interesting would it have been for the four of them to enter this country whining about the ""stress"" of children, nannies and TVs in the bedroom...only to realize that in Abu Dhabi, basic freedoms enjoyed by women in the West are not available to them?  How might they have viewed their lives and husbands afterward?

1310029,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002ZG98Z0,RMurray847,"[0, 3]","As with the first Sex and the City film, Sex and the City II is more or less ""review-proof.""  The films are made for fans that are already well-immersed in the characters from the TV series, and these fans are just as interested in seeing what everyone is up to and what they're wearing as they are in a coherent plot or deeper meanings.  For fans of SATC, more is more.So I guess this makes SATC2 a big success.  It's nearly two and a half hours long.  It features more costume changes than ever, and it takes its decadence to a whole new level.  Yet the franchise is starting to feel forced and flaccid.  Seeing SATC2 was like visiting a favorite old restaurant and realizing that the dish you used to love just isn't quite the same anymore.  The ingredients are all there, but they haven't been prepared quite right or with any loving attention.Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) is still married to ""Big"" (Chris Noth), and it's been about 2 years.  He wants to start settling in to a quieter, domestic life (he enjoys cuddling on the sofa watching old B&W; movies) but she wants to continue to lead an active, late-night social life.  She throws the equivalent of a hissy-fit, and poor Big just can't seem to do anything to make her happy.  For the first time, Big is more sympathetic than whinny Carrie.  Carrie has always been a difficult character to like, because even though she is big-hearted and witty and sparkly...she's also always been the most damagingly selfish girl of the bunch.Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is having trouble being appreciated at work.  Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is feeling overwhelmed by a particularly terrible two-year-old, and threatened by a particularly buxom nanny.  Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is grappling with menopause.So when the opportunity arises for ""the girls"" to get away from it all for a bit by taking a trip to Abu Dhabi (all expenses paid at a luxury resort that makes any luxury suite we've ever seen in a Las Vegas movie look like a dump)...off they go in a swirl of silk and cotton.  Minor complications ensue as each works out their issues while wearing some ridiculous costumes.  (I think it must be a law now that Miranda cannot be allowed to wear anything even remotely flattering.)Time for disclosure.  I'm a 46 year old man...not exactly the normal target audience.  But my wife and I watched the series together...and to be honest, I've always enjoyed it.  While it's hardly my favorite show of all time, I didn't have to have my arm twisted to see the films either.  So perhaps my reactions are skewed.  But I get the appeal of SATC.  I've enjoyed the sharp writing, the interesting characters and the feeling of NYC being a true character too.So, how did SATC2 fall short?  First of all, sending them to Abu Dhabi absolutely felt more than a little like the series was ""jumping the shark.""  Although many amusing things happen, it's as though ""The City"" held no more inspiration for the filmmakers.  In the first film, the girls escape to Mexico...but it feels wrong.  They are having a difficult time and being away from the city adds to that sense of dis-ease...and makes those scenes successful.  Going to the desert feels a little like the season when Lucy Ricardo and company went to Europe...a transparent effort to keep up the ante.  Heck, SATC2 even has a major wedding scene that takes place in Connecticut.Also, Carrie is more annoying than usual.  Can't she see how perplexed and hurt she has left Big?  Charlotte's problems seem quite petty (her two-year-old cries all the time like an infant...those aren't the terrible twos...if my two year old carried on that way, I'd take her to the hospital)...and they feel like they were written by a man who doesn't understand domesticity and child-rearing.  The best they could come up with was a sexy Irish nanny who doesn't wear a bra and making Charlotte fearful that her husband would stray.  Like anyone who knows the show believes Harry would do that!  Miranda quits her job...and that's about it.  Never has she been given a more minor role than in this film.  She is hardly one-quarter of the action...perhaps one-tenth.  And Samantha's antics seem more desperate.  And that sort of sums up the film.  These actresses...all lovely...are now being asked to act and behave much younger than they are.  And the cracks show.  It's not just that the layers of pancake makeup can't hide the lines around Parker's eyes...it's that there is simply no way that women with the experiences these four have had would act in the ways they do.  They've always been outrageous, yes.  But they now frequently lean towards being cartoonish.The series now feels caught in another generation.  To me, the best example comes early on.  Everyone is attending a gay wedding, and guess who performs the civil ceremony?  Liza Minelli!  That's fairly random, but worth a laugh.  Later, she performs (and we're asked to believe that she would do this) at the reception, by singing and dancing Single Ladies for Beyonce...replicating the signature choreography from the video.  Too bad this joke has already been thoroughly played out...the football players on Glee already did it.  The female chipmunks in the latest Alvin and the Chipmunks film did it.  And even Beyonce herself spoofed it with the male members of Saturday Night Live.  So including this bit in the film feels like a grab for hipness by a filmmaker caught in the `90s but trying to seem ""up on what the kids are doing these days.""In the end, I think the film simply doesn't speak to anything real anymore.  I'd still go see another sequel, because I have enough goodwill for the original series...but they'd better step up their game and refocus on what really makes the series work on more than a superficial level.  Because with SATC2, ""superficial"" was all we got.",3,2.5 stars rounded up to 3 because of my past affection for the series.,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,5834,"['first', 'Sex', 'City', 'film', 'Sex',

Your favorite characters all make an appearance in this film and you've been loyal thus far... For the non-fans, this may not be that interesting for you, and for some a bit upsetting as well.Let's start off with the good.New York City baby!!! The film starts and ends where we love it - New York, where Carrie starts her ever expected narration of the going's on in her life and that of her friends (cue awesomely bad 80's fashion - loved it!!).  We then move onto Connecticut where everyone gets together for the wedding of the century - that of Anthony and Stanford (best gay friends of Charlotte and Carrie respectively).  You have to experience the wedding for yourself.  I really feel I'd be robbing you if I went into any real detail about it, though I believe most of you know it's quite extravagant, Liza makes an appearance, and it is indeed fun to watch.It's there that we see a bit of conflict within the lives the girls had so desired and ultimately got:  Charlotte and her family life, Miranda and her work life, Samantha and her love of herself, and Carrie with the love of her life, Big.  Charlotte is dealing with new mother issues (side note, it kills me how much trouble mothers with nannies have, despite having a nanny!!) and the subsequent guilt, Miranda is dealing with a male chauvinist boss at work, Samantha is fighting the effects of age, one vitamin at a time, and Carrie is coming to terms with compromise and what it means to be married.That's a lot to take in huh?  Well, thanks to Samantha and her connect with Smith (Jason Lewis) Samantha gets the opportunity of a lifetime, visit one of Abu Dhabi's premiere resorts all expenses paid and bring her best girl friends along!  Given the issues at home, all the ladies (with the exception of Charlotte who is brewing up some nanny issues) jump at the chance to go.And we're off to Abu Dhabi... Now here's where things get dicey with this movie and where those with strong opinions regarding political correctness will definitely have a problem.  I mean, I had a bit of a problem and I'm not the most politically correct person, at least not when it comes to comedy.  I'm all for fantasy, but I'm still unsure about how I felt about it in this setting.  Flat out, our ladies of New York, do not belong in Abu Dhabi - at least, not as they usually are.  And why do we love them?  Because of who they are!! They do and say what we'd often love to do and say in our lives.  But the kind of freedom they enjoy is not legal in Abu Dhabi!!  Forget about what is considered appropriate and what's not, simple things we do in our normal everyday interactions (hugging, holding hands, etc..) are illegal in Abu Dhabi, man!!! So it just didn't work.  During a conversation I had about the movie, another very relevant fact came out as well.  Samantha was there ultimately for business and as an astute business woman, you think she would have exercised some restraint for a potentially lucrative business deal.  Yet another truth about our girls that wasn't well represented here. And in all honesty, it is really difficult to watch the so-called woman's lib scene in this movie when the reality would have ended so, so differently.  I can't even talk about it without giving away key info on the film (and I hate ruining films for people), aside from the fact that I doubt such disrespect would be shown...What was good about Abu Dhabi?  The colors, the scenery, the settings, the crazy fashions and Charlotte.  Kristin Davis was given some good moments in this film.So, see it.

The plot (if you can call it that), is that these four woman walk around, complain about nothing and then go on a trip to, literally, the middle of nowhere and then run around like it's a madcap slapstick comedy romp (um.... how is this like the show?). King makes characters that have hated each other (Stanford and Anthony) for six seasons (and the film!) marry. There are useless cameos (Miley Cyrus, Penelope Cruz, Liza Minnelli in a god awful scene) and the most outrageous set design and costumes that physically swallow the actors. It all makes for great misdirection for anyone trying to find anything meaningful (the show and first film were full of fantastic dramatic, comedic and character moments). How is anything of this even remotely linked to the show? It's like I just watched a random movie that happened to contain a bunch of Sex and the City characters. This film is a complete and total insult to a well deserved legacy in pop culture. There is no drama. No emotional hook. No conflict. Nothing remotely compelling... maybe thats why 2 thirds of the film takes place in a desert. Carrie Bradshaw is married for goodness sake, don't we all want to see how she adjusts to that!?

Actually its demeaning to women in general. It's unfavorable in its view of marriage and motherhood especially. Just awful.

I started to think that she was angry about her role and it was showing on film...if so, she had every right to be. Towards the end she actually looks a lot better but even so, the girls need to hang it up now, it's pretty much over after this one. The actress who plays Samantha looks horrid, puffy and botoxed to the nth degree -and the hair....the way she's dressed -I'm sure the clothing costs mega bucks but GHOD most of the fashions are so ugly -I can see why people can't wear those outfits twice. Samantha is an embarrassment, I couldn't imagine having her as a friend, constantly in heat and going through menopause/aging denial. The only one who seems to have held up nicely is Miranda.

I was rolling my eyes when Carrie met Aidan, her old flame, again in Abu Dhabi...how stupid is that. As I stated earlier, the movie made me kind of uneasy in its portrayal of older women -it's like the director just decided to turn on the characters and just bring them down to a really bad level or something and just kill off SATC once and for all.

If your a fan of the franchise and love Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda you will have a fondness for the movie. The fact that the producers have continued the series on the big screen shows they want to feed the apetite of ""Sex and the City's"" loyal fans who followed the series for six years on television and who went to the theatre in droves to see the first film. Unfortunately, critics and fans alike have stated this sequel is far inferior to the original. The problem really begins with the issue of not using beautiful New York City as the movie's backdrop. As everyone knows New York was as much a character in the series and the first film as the female leads, but in this outing the girls go to the Middle East, in Abu Dhabi, where Samantha takes the girls along when she goes there to do PR work. While there the bulk of the film takes place as the girls have a culture shock with the muslim world with the way they dress and the way the carry on.Another problem was with the cameo appearances of certain celebrities. Who cares if Miley Cyrus or Penelope Cruz are in the film for brief appearances? The film could have afforded even bigger stars to appear, with the kind of budget HBO set aside: $100,000,000. Liza Minnelli is fun to watch as the singer at Carrie's gay friend's wedding, Sanford, but I have to admit watching her do Beyonce's ""Single Ladies"" was like watching a train wreck on a collision course. It would have been more appropriate if Liza had done one of her own standards in this scene, but it was not to be.It was nice, however, to see Aiden back in the series as Carrie's long-lost boyfriend, but nothing much comes out of his appearance.The stories are pretty simple too: Carrie is dealing with marriage to Big; Samantha is going through menopause; Charlotte is having trouble with her kids; and Miranda deals with a sexist boss. Yes it was fun to see ""my girls"" again, but I wish the writers could have spent more time on the story instead of emphasizing the importance of glamour especially during this day in time of the recession.""Sex and the City 2"", despite its downfall in its script, still performed very well at the boxoffice in its first weekend of release grossing over $82,000,000. This signifies that a third installment will most certain be on its way to theatres.

1310052,A376GITYM7MQ6J,B002ZG98Z0,Thiago Sardenberg,"[6, 8]","I had never really given the TV series a chance before I saw the first movie in theatres, a couple of years ago. I was surprised by how much I liked the film, as it was both fun and dramatic. It was balanced, much like life itself, and contrary to other movies of the genre that depict an idealistic view of the characters and the situations. That movie had the glitter, but it had the ugliness as well.Then I felt like watching the TV series. Bought the first season and before I knew it I was finishing up season 6, in less than a couple of months. I was hooked. It was clever, it was modern, it was funny, and mainly it featured importantic discussions on relationships and current issues, that most of us can all relate to.I was glad to know that the first movie wasn't the end, because now I was a fan. So, with a completely different perspective, I went to see the second movie-- this time I knew exactly who these characters were, where they were coming from, where they're likely to be headed to.Still, I was surprised. This movie, again, stays away from the obvious. It is SO funny. Hilarious, really. My friends and I were laughing out loud throughout the movie. For me, SATC had never been that funny - it was always fun, but seldom was it really funny - and I was glad to find this other layer lying underneath.The movie played with our expectations, and I guess for a lot of people that was a problem. They didn't expect [A] & [B] to get married; they didn't expect [C] to cheat on [D]; they didn't expect to see such a light, uncompromised side of [E]; they didn't expect a lot of things. But again, that's how life works, in unexpected ways that carry us to places we would never see coming. I embraced the movie with open arms and would even say I prefer this one to the one that made me fall for the SATC characters in the first place.Do hope they eventually make a 3rd one!",4,"Extremely underrated!

1310053,A33BOYMVG3U58Y,B002ZG98Z0,TV Critic,"[9, 14]","Following the drama-filled storylines of the first Sex and the City movie with Big ditching Carrie at the altar and Steve cheating on Miranda, writer/director Michael Patrick King made it clear that in the sequel he wanted the girls to have fun. Much like the overindulgence and excesses of the big studio films made during the Great Depression in the 1930's, Sex and the City 2 follows a similar note by letting the audience escape America's current economic downturn and enjoy the decadence and glamour of an exotic vacation in Abu Dhabi.Those going into this film expecting substance may be disappointed. While there is a clear story and theme among the four women, the film lacks the weight of the first film. The first film explored Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha's separate lives, the sequel's focus is on the women as a group. Taking a vacation to Abu Dhabi allows the audience to enjoy these women together for much of the film while still exploring what is going on in their personal lives.Without giving too much away, tradition is the overall theme of the film. The film begins with a non-traditional marriage of Carrie's gay bff, Stanford, marrying Charlotte's gay bff, Anthony. The wedding leads to the introduction of the four main storylines in the film. Carrie is pondering the traditions of marriage and the roles that a wife and husband play. Charlotte struggles with the life of traditional motherhood that she always dreamed of. Miranda's professional life is turned upside down with a chauvinistic boss. Samantha is having a hard time maintaining her sexual appetite and lifestyle with the onset of menopause and later on, the restrictions placed on her sensuality while in Abu Dhabi.Having the women on vacation in Abu Dhabi is the perfect place to explore tradition. In a place where a woman's role is still very restricted, the Middle East helps the ladies explore their lives and see that even in America some of these archaic expectations for women are still prevalent. One part in particular that I found interesting is that while Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha realize that America may not be as forward-thinking as we tend to believe, they come across a group of women in Abu Dhabi who secretly are breaking away from the traditions that they are expected to maintain, however, they carefully conceal it under their hijabs and burqas. It was a fun way to show the two worlds colliding.This film has a sophistication and layer in it about gender roles that I don't think many of the mostly straight, male critics understood (There is a reason why King chose to have the ladies sing ""I Am Woman."" Look beyond the glitz of the scene and at the actual thematic elements of the song.). Majority saw the film as the girls being spoiled and going on an unrealistic and unnecessary trip to the Middle East. Yet they failed to see the commentary that King was making with the exploration of these modern New York City women in a world where a woman's sexuality is frowned upon.Overall, I enjoyed the film. This sequel was appropriate because it explored what happens after marriage. In films, it's so easy to end on a marriage, but that's not where the story ends. This film explores Carrie and Big after the wedding and how the non-traditional Carrie handles it. This is a fun movie and made more for laughs than anything else. It's over-the-top at times and overindulgent always (gratuitous costume changes and Liza Minnelli singing `Single Ladies' comes to mind). However, this film is a romp, it has a modern feel of the road pictures made in old Hollywood with characters taking lavish trips and getting themselves into high jinx trouble. This film is one that you can sit back and enjoy and escape, the way Michael Patrick King intended.",5,"Fun, Decadent Escapism",1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,3781,"['Following', 'drama-filled', 'storylines', 'first', 'Sex', 'City', 'movie', 'Big', 'ditching', 'Carrie', 'altar', 'Steve', 'cheating', 'Miranda', 'writer/director', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King', 'made', 'clear', 'sequel', 'wanted', 'girls', 'have', 'fun', 'Much', 'overindulgence', 'excesses', 'big', 'studio', 'films', 'made', 'Great', 'Depression', '1930', 'Sex', 'City', '2', 'similar', 'note', 'letting', 'audience', 'escape', 'America', 'current', 'economic', 'downturn', 'enjoy', 'decadence', 'glamour', 'exotic', 'vacation', 'Abu', 'Dhabi.Those', 'going', 'film', 'expecting', 'substance', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'clear', 'story', 'theme', 'four', 'women', 'film', 'weight', 'first', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'explored', 'Carrie', 'Miranda', 'Charlotte', 'Samantha', 'separate', 'lives', 'sequel', 'focus', 'women', 'group', 'Taking', 'vacation', 'Abu', 'Dhabi', 'audience', 'enjoy', 'women', 'together', 'much', 'film', 'still', 'exploring', 'what', 'going', 'personal', 'lives.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'tradition', 'overall', 'theme', 'film', 'film', 'non-traditional', 'marriage', 'Carrie', 'gay', 'bff', 'Stanford', 'marrying', 'Charlotte', 'gay', 'bff', 'Anthony', 'wedding', 'introduction', 'four', 'main', 'storylines', 'film', 'Carrie', 'pondering', 'traditions', 'marriage', 'roles', 'wife', 'husband', 'play', 'Charlotte', 'life', 'traditional', 'motherhood', 'always', 'dreamed', 'Miranda', 'professional', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'chauvinistic', 'boss', 'Samantha', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'maintaining', 'sexual', 'appetite', 'lifestyle', 'onset', 'menopause', 'later', 'restrictions', 'placed', 'sensuality', 'Abu', 'Dhabi.Having', 'women', 'vacation', 'Abu', 'Dhabi', 'perfect', 'place', 'explore', 'tradition', 'place', 'where', 'woman', 'role', 'still', 'very', 'restricted', 'Middle', 'East', 'ladies', 'explore', 'lives', 'see', 'even', 'America', 'archaic', 'expectations', 'women', 'are', 'still', 'prevalent', 'One', 'part', 'particular', 'found', 'interesting', 'Carrie', 'Charlotte', 'Miranda', 'Samantha', 'realize', 'America', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'forward-thinking', 'tend', 'believe', 'come', 'group', 'women', 'Abu', 'Dhabi', 'who', 'secretly', 'are', 'breaking', 'away', 'traditions', 'are', 'expected', 'maintain', 'however', 'carefully', 'conceal', 'hijabs', 'burqas', 'was', 'fun', 'way', 'show', 'two', 'worlds', 'colliding.This', 'film', 'sophistication', 'layer', 'gender', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'mostly', 'straight', 'male', 'critics', 'understood', 'reason', 'why', 'King', 'chose', 'have', 'ladies', 'sing', 'Am', 'Woman', 'Look', 'glitz', 'scene', 'actual', 'thematic', 'elements', 'song.', 'Majority', 'saw', 'film', 'girls', 'being', 'spoiled', 'going', 'unrealistic', 'unnecessary', 'trip', 'Middle', 'East', 'failed', 'see', 'commentary', 'King', 'was', 'making', 'exploration', 'modern', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'women', 'world', 'where', 'woman', 'sexuality', 'frowned', 'upon.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'sequel', 'was', 'appropriate', 'explored', 'what', 'marriage', 'films', 'so', 'easy', 'end', 'marriage', 'not', 'where', 'story', 'film', 'Carrie', 'Big', 'wedding', 'how', 'non-traditional', 'Carrie', 'fun', 'movie', 'made', 'more', 'laughs', 'anything', 'else', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'overindulgent', 'always', 'gratuitous', 'costume', 'changes', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'singing', 'Single', 'Ladies', 'mind', 'However', 'film', 'romp', 'modern', 'feel', 'road', 'pictures', 'made', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'characters', 'taking', 'lavish', 'trips', 'getting', 'high', 'jinx', 'trouble', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'escape', 'way', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King', 'intended']",N/A

My mom got into the reruns, and I bought her the entire series on DVD for her birthday or Christmas or something. It's still in the box. Unopened. My first real exposure to SATC was when the first movie came out. I really enjoyed it and vowed I would watch the DVDs so I would understand what came before the movie. Um, haven't quite gotten around to it yet. So... here we go with SATC 2.SATC2 takes place two years after the first.  Carrie and Mr. Big are ""between hot sex and a baby."" She wants to go out on the town, he wants to sit on the couch and watch TV. Miranda is having issues at the law firm. Charlotte is having a couple of nanny issues (you'll get that if you see the movie). Samantha is, well... Samantha: chasing the ever elusive fountain of  youth. So when she meets Shiek Mahmoud at a premiere and he invites her to one week in Abu Dhabi (which has a pretty happenin' nightlife), all expenses paid, the girls decide they're all ready for a week of decadence.Ah, Abu Dhabi. Even the flight over was decadent, the hotel suite was incredible, the karaoke bar was over the top. There was a lot of fallout in real life about the SATC girls throwing all that skirt-wearin' sexuality around Abu Dhabi , so those scenes were actually filmed in Morocco. The ladies quickly notice and are concerned about the native women who are covered head to toe with the veils and robes. This opens the discussion of how men in America don't really want women to have a voice.Of course, Samantha manages to majorly offend the natives in ways that are supposed to be funny but mainly come across as Ugly American. And who does Carrie just happen to bump into on the other side of the world? Her ex, Aiden. Hmm, what to do, what to do...SATC had its moments but it was not as funny as I had expected and hoped. As long as the movie was, it had no huge plot twists and, I was left wondering what the point was. I suppose it was about learning to appreciate what you have. I give this movie two out of five stars.The soundtrack includes the great ""True Colors"" by Cyndi Lauper and ""Empire State of Mind"" and a fun remake of ""Rapture"" by Alicia Keys.

SATC 2 is much more light-hearted, funny and less Carrie-centric than the first one. SATC 1 was a real downer, and the whole story centered on how Carrie's wedding went awry because of contrivances such as the little girl's misplacement of her cell phone, Mr. Big's nervousness, and Carrie's addiction to designer wedding dresses. I also didn't like the underlying message of the first film, which is, if a guy feels too intimidated by a fancy wedding, forgo your fantasies and get married at City Hall to make him happy. Hello, what about a compromise?The second one is more of an ensemble piece, with lots of laughs arising from Samantha, the Irish nanny, Liza Minnelli, culture clash, etc. Maybe for some fans it's too funny, since they prefer the soap opera aspects of the first one. For me, the fun spirit of the 2nd is worth watching repeatedly any day over watching Carrie cry her eyes out again over Mr. Big.",4,More Fun Than the First Movie,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,992,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'SATC', '2', 'much', 'more', 'light-hearted', 'funny', 'less', 'Carrie-centric', 'first', 'one', 'SATC', '1', 'was', 'real', 'downer', 'whole', 'story', 'centered', 'how', 'Carrie', 'wedding', 'went', 'awry', 'contrivances', 'such', 'little', 'girl', 'misplacement', 'cell', 'phone', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'nervousness', 'Carrie', 'addiction', 'designer', 'wedding', 'dresses', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'underlying', 'message', 'first', 'film', 'guy', 'feels', 'too', 'intimidated', 'fancy', 'wedding', 'forgo', 'fantasies', 'get', 'married', 'City', 'Hall', 'make', 'happy', 'Hello', 'what', 'compromise', 'second', 'one', 'more', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'lots', 'laughs', 'arising', 'Samantha', 'Irish', 'nanny', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'culture', 'clash', 'etc', 'Maybe', 'fans', 'too', 'funny', 'prefer', 'soap', 'opera', 'aspects', 'first', 'one', 'fun', 'spirit', '2nd', 'worth', 'watching', 'repeatedly', 'day', 'watching', 'Carrie', 'cry', 'eyes', 'out', 'again', 'Mr.', 'Big']",N/A
