What sets it apart is the wonderful heartfelt acting by a stellar ensemble cast and the intelligent, astute writing. The characters are fully brought to life and made real.The writing and acting have such depth and nuance that you'll laugh with recognition and nod your head as every true note is hit.Sela Ward deservedly received her share of awards from her role, but Billy Campbell -- who is just as exceptional -- unfortunately did not. But again, this is an ensemble cast, and every one shines.When DVDs first came out, I did not expect to be buying television shows in the format. But ""Once and Again"" shows why the format is so perfect for this medium: You get to see the whole arc of a show's season at your own pace, and the quality of the image is perfect. If only there were some extras -- but then, ""Once and Again"" stands on its own.Season 2 came out on DVD long after this set, and season 3 has yet to be released.

Rarely has television see a presence as luminescent as Sela Ward--I am beyond thrilled that she is back on TV in ""House"".  The story of two broken families trying to pick up the pieces and find happiness again is done so well it is almost heartbreaking.  Adults+children are given mature storylines+allowed to excel--especially Julia Whelan+Evan Rachel Ward.  Ward especially is as revelation--more so in season 2 where she is given as story line that should have won her an Emmy.  Shows like this are the reason TV was created.

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[8, 8]","Distinct from the scandal-happy nighttime soaps like Melrose Place or The OC, the nighttime melodrama has safer, more character-oriented stories to tell, and for the past twenty years, no one's been better at bringing the nighttime melodrama to the screen than the Herskowitz/ Zwick pairing that created Thirtysomething, My So-Called Life, and Relativity before coming up with their best show in 1999 with Once and Again.  Told with delicate humanity and enough intricate drama to become at first a guilty pleasure (I was a 17-year-old guy in high school when I started watching), and then just a pleasure, a rich and rewarding multi-character drama that was remarkably sure of itself right from its first episodes.  The show was inventive in its highly self-conscious - but also highly effective - use of the in-show interview with the character, black-and-white scenes of catharsis that really did seem to be eminating from the characters' subconsciouses.  But what worked so well in Once and Again was its ordinariness - the plain, unfussy performances by Julia Whelan as gawky teen Grace, Marin Hinkle's alluring work as sister Judy, Jeffrey Nordling and Susanna Thompson as the exes, and especially Sela Ward as Lily, whose tough and graceful work seemed to be earning every possible acting award for a while.  The show hit some creative dry patches in their second season - perhaps the reason season 2 has yet to come to DVD - but as concluded in its third season, it proved to be a resonant and cosy beacon of pure ol' drama at its best.  The fact that that season can't be seen is a shame, but until then, I'm happy to say I can watch the episodes of the first season over and over.",5,And where are seasons 2 & 3??,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,1690,"['Distinct', 'scandal-happy', 'nighttime', 'soaps', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'OC', 'nighttime', 'melodrama', 'safer', 'more', 'character-oriented', 'stories', 'tell', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'one', 'been', 'better', 'bringing', 'nighttime', 'melodrama', 'screen', 'Herskowitz/', 'Zwick', 'pairing', 'created', 'Thirtysomething', 'My', 'So-Called', 'Life', 'Relativity', 'coming', 'up', 'best', 'show', '1999', 'Once', 'Again', 'Told', 'delicate', 'humanity', 'enough', 'intricate', 'drama', 'become', 'first', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'was', '17-year-old', 'guy', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'then', 'just', 'pleasure', 'rich', 'rewarding', 'multi-character', 'drama', 'was', 'remarkably', 'sure', 'right', 'first', 'episodes', 'show', 'was', 'inventive', 'highly', 'self-conscious', 'also', 'highly', 'effective', 'use', 'in-show', 'interview', 'character', 'black-and-white', 'scenes', 'catharsis', 'really', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'eminating', 'characters', 'subconsciouses', 'what', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'Once', 'Again', 'was', 'ordinariness', 'plain', 'unfussy', 'performances', 'Julia', 'Whelan', 'gawky', 'teen', 'Grace', 'Marin', 'Hinkle', 'alluring', 'work', 'sister', 'Judy', 'Jeffrey', 'Nordling', 'Susanna', 'Thompson', 'exes', 'especially', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'Lily', 'tough', 'graceful', 'work', 'seemed', 'be', 'earning', 'possible', 'acting', 'award', 'while', 'show', 'hit', 'creative', 'dry', 'patches', 'second', 'season', 'perhaps', 'reason', 'season', '2', 'yet', 'come', 'DVD', 'concluded', 'third', 'season', 'proved', 'be', 'resonant', 'cosy', 'beacon', 'pure', 'ol', 'drama', 'best', 'fact', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'shame', 'then', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'can', 'watch', 'episodes', 'first', 'season']",Once and Again - The Complete First Season

600393,A10BWW5GU19AD,B00005JLFY,Jeff Wiley,"[11, 11]","There are very few shows in my lifetime that I have been fiercely loyal to, but the now defunct `Once and Again' without question, topped that short list.I will admit that my lifelong crush on actress Sela Ward was my main interest in this series, originally.  Single, with no kids, and in my late 20s during O&A;'s debut, I was far out of ABC's target demographic for this show.  I didn't expect to like the show very much, but I got sucked in not because of Sela, but because the show was nothing less than fantastic.Superbly acted and superbly written, ABC never gave this show a chance to find its audience, and it bounced around from time slot to time slot until it's all too early demise.  Even the best shows need to be pitched correctly to viewing audiences to have a chance.  The premise of the story is of Rick Samler and Lily Manning, two fortysomething single parents who re-enter the adult dating scene after their divorces. They fall head over heels for one another, and find that life and love in the (then) late 1990s is far different than what they remember.  Adding children, careers, parents, and ex-spouses to the mix just adds different layers of complications and challenges for Rick and Lily.Most shows `jump the shark' at some point during their lifetimes.  While some could argue that the hostage episode in S2 was that point for O&A;, I disagree.  Once and Again always presented two kinds of television : good, and better.  The stories and characters could fill you with hope, heartbreak, or both every week almost without fail.  And best of all - everything about this show was real.  Very little, if any, suspension of disbelief was required.Perhaps the best thing I can say about O&A; is that it is the only show that I was so passionate about saving, that I sat down and wrote a letter to ABC, asking them to reconsider their canceling of it (as part of an organized campaign with other fans).  While the campaign wasn't successful, the release (finally) of the series on DVD will allow those who loved this show then to enjoy it forever, as well as allow those who didn't get to view O&A; during its run to discover it, and they too, might find out why we who followed this show from the beginning understood that this was just a beautiful story.",5,Came because of Sela Ward.

This was unlike any show I had seen before. I actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families. Once and Again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love. It goes much deeper than that. Once and Again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well. But then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well. With the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell) and how their ex's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children. Once and Again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today. Even thought it's time on television was short Once and Again showcased the acting talents of Sela Ward and Billy Campbell and launched the careers of Shane West and Evan Rachel Wood.

600397,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLFY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 9]","I do not know if I can take another television series created by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick.  When they came out with ""thirtysomething"" in 1987 it was like watching our lives on TV.  I can still remember all the married couples that talked about how they recognized themselves in the myriad machinations of Michael, Hope and the gang.  Then in 1999 they came back with ""Once and Again,"" and all I can is that I hate to think what would have happened if I was not already where the characters ended up in the third season, because if I was still in first season mode when this aired it would have been way too painful.  In fact, I would maintain that there will always be moments from this series that will threaten to rip off the scabs, twist the knife, or at least keep you up all night because they hit too close to home for those who have been involved with a divorce.You might have heard originally the idea with ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was for Mary Richards to be divorced, and they could not get that idea to fly because the networks thought audiences would think Laura had divorced Rob Petrie.  But divorces are so painful, despite their regularity on soap opears, that there have been other concerns with having a show that is about divorce.  ""Once and Again"" is more about life (and love) after divorce, and the series dodges a major bullet by making sure the principle couple to be are already divorced and separated respectively when they first meet and sparks start to fly despite the train wrecks that are their lives.  This television series might be too painful to watch for some (I want to be Rick but I know I am a lot closer to Jake and that conclusion certainly hurts), but that is what happens with shows that are real rather than merely being considered reality programming.The fortysomethings in the main spotlight are Lily Manning (Sela Ward), who kicked her husband Jake (Jeffrey Nordling) out of the house for having an affair, and architect Rick Sammler (Bill Campbell), who has been divorced for three years from Karen (Susanna Thompson).  Lily works part-time at a bookshop with her sister, Judy Brooks (Marin Hinkle), while Jake runs the restaurant once owned by Lily and Judy's father, and Karen is a lawyer.  Both ex-couples have two children.  Living with Lily are Grace (Julia Whelan), an awkward high school freshman, and young Zoe (Meredith Deane), who has the ability to ask the pointed question at the wrong moment.  Living with Karen but frequently visiting Rick are Eli (Shane West), a high school junior who plays basketball and has some sort of learning disability, and Jessie (Evan Rachel Wood in the role that first got out attention), who is smart, thin, and working on her black belt in tae kwan doe.Lily and Rick meet at the high school when Grace has an injured ankle and Eli has academic problems, and from the start the couple find they are embarrassments to their children (""Pilot"").  Rick is clearly smitten and Lily is surprised to find herself enjoying a relationship with another man (""Let's Spend the Night Together""), which is not easy when she finds herself working with his ex-wife at a school carnival (""The Scarlet Letter Jacket"") and her sister clearly disapproves of the guy (""Liars and Other Strangers"") and his involvement in Lily's life (""A Dream Deferred"").  Meanwhile the kids have resorted to parallel euphemisms: Lily is ""The Mom"" and Rick is ""The Dad"" and have to deal with their own teenager crises in terms of sprained ankles (""The Ex-Files""), out of control parties (""Outside Hearts""), and the revolving door of adolescent affection (""Sneaky Feelings,"" ""Daddy's Girl"").  Then there are the ups and downs of the love lives of both Judy (""The Mystery Dance"") and Karen (""Cat-in-Hat""), in the wake of Lily and Rick's romance, as well as Jake's ongoing involvement with young Tiffany (Ever Carradine) becoming painfully clear to Grace (""Letting Go"").There is a major subplot in the first season regarding Lily's father, Phil (Paul Mazursky), who shows up for ""Thanksgiving"" expecting things to be patched up between Lily and Jake, who is clearly more like a son than a son-in-law, to Lily's absolute frustration.  Add to the interpersonal complications, which includes Lily's brother Aaron (Patrick Dempsey), the escalating financial problems of Jake that are putting the house that Lily and her daughters live in at risk (""Mediation""), and force Lily to go out and fin a job (""My Brilliant Career"").  As for Rick, Herskovitz and Zwick introduce him to a new circle of hell when who else but familiar face by Miles Dentrell (David Clennon), who has relocated to the Chicago area from Philadelphia.  The conceit of the series was the use of black-and-white ""interview"" segments where the characters admit to themselves things they would never say aloud.  This matters on ""Once and Again"" because getting these characters to say what they are thinking without being prompted by anger or fear is often difficult and our feelings towards Grace, Judy and Karen are tempered because of these moments where their pain becomes most clear.  The season ends with an indication that the genesis for this series might have been the romance between Lily and Rick, but that what it is really going to be about in the next two seasons is how these two families become one, while maintaining tangible links to the families they were in the past (""A Door, About to Open"").",5,Herskovitz and Zwick bring the drama of divorce to prime time

I cannot express in words how disappointed I am that I no longer have this beautiful show to move me, inspire me, thrill me and uplift me. The powers that be at ABC have to be concerned with running a business and somehow, I understand that, but what I do not understand is how a network so bereft of creativity could have let this gem go because it wasn't getting the boffo numbers they would have liked. This show was no metaphor for real life, it was, instead, indicative of what real life is like for many of us. What performances on television or film could match those of this cast: the talented and gorgeous Sela Ward, the incredibly moving Susanna Thompson, the dynamic Evan Rachel Wood, Marin Hickle, Billy Campbell, a perfect Julia Whelan, Shane West, Meredith Deane, Jeffrey Nordling, Ever Carradine and Patrick Dempsey...this is a roll-call of excellence. Let's just hope we can get the 2nd and 3rd seasons on DVD as well. It is the perfect goodbye for a family that was forced to leave us way, way, way too soon.

600401,A38QX8P4F7MKJ0,B00005JLFY,Mr. Dude Man,"[27, 27]","""And so my course is clear: to go through life pretending to have done and seen things that have hardened me -- made me aloof and unreachable.  Which works, until I need to ask a stock boy where they keep their corn meal.  Then the facade crumbles, and it's clear that I'm not a weathered loner who's seen too much; just a pasty Midwesterner who can't find the flour aisle.""- Mike Nelson, 'Movie Megacheese''Once and Again' is about people like this, people who live in America's fly-over country, have never been homeless, are not famous, don't fight crime or work in hospitals, don't shop in SoHo or Beverly Hills.  In real life, they vastly outnumber the homicide detectives, criminals, trauma surgeons, and island castaways who comprise such a disproportionate percentage of the central characters on television dramas.  Why?  Two reasons:  (1) Most TV writers think they're boring and lack the insight and skills to write about them in ways that viewers will find interesting.  (2) When a show that deals with this kind of material makes it on the air, it depends on large numbers of viewers in order to remain in production.  Most television viewers gravitate to sex, violence, and suspense (and combinations thereof), and they are addicted to heightened reality.  They do not have the patience for character studies, and that's why 'Once and Again' lasted only three seasons.  One imagines that it was able to go that long because small but loyal numbers of viewers are actually bored by explosions, artificial suspense, and mindless exhibitionism.Now we have 'Once and Again' on DVD.  I doubt there's ever been more genuine gratitude among fans of a TV show regarding its release on video.  Sure, there are a lot of great shows on DVD, but they're usually high-rated products that stand to do a lot of volume on DVD and are no-brainers from a marketing perspective.  (A lot of lousy ones make it to DVD, too, but does anyone really care about those?)  We spent a long time wondering if 'O&A;' would ever meet polycarbonate, then, later, believing that Season One would remain alone there.  That would have been a shame.As good as the first season is as a stand-alone, it improves dramatically on subsequent viewings after seeing the second and third seasons.  In the opening scene of the series, Lily Manning wakes her daughters in a middle-class home in a Chicago suburb.  Beautiful morning sunlight streams through the windows.  It's probably easy to dismiss it and think, ""Okay, so what?""  When you watch it after, say, ""Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight?"" from Season Two, you'll be prepared to understand.  In Episode 5, ""There Be Dragons,"" Jessie slips out of a movie outing with friends to take a walk by herself.  She wanders around a mall looking at things, watching people, thinking.  There's a wealth of suggestions on what's going through her mind, given the context of events in the episode.  Watch it again after seeing ""The Sex Show"" from Season Three, and you'll find yourself filling in things that could not be suggested on network television in the earlier episode.What holds it all together and makes it so compelling is that 'Once and Again' isn't afraid to let all the main characters be smart, decent people.  There are no moments of convenient stupidity that are allowed only because suspense must be maintained.  People sometimes behave questionably or lash out angrily at one another, but it's seldom a surprise, because it usually happens under circumstances under which you'd expect it from the character.  It's never a cop-out, either, because not a single main character in the series is one-notish.  The strength of the actors is critical, because they are required to render subtle shadings and quick revelations that are necessary to make many scenes work but cannot be written into dialog.Fiction differs from reality in that it has had a narrative imposed on it by a writer, thus it is usually better able to illuminate human truths that are missing from an episode of 'Fear Factor' or 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'  When you watch a television series in its original broadcast (or under other circumstances in which each episode is new to you), you can't know the full scope of the narrative that is taking shape in the minds of the writers, and they can do only so much to clue you in -- otherwise it just wouldn't be cool.  This is no less true of 'Once and Again.'  After you've seen every episode, going back and watching them over is synergistic.  You can stand outside the constraints of the moment and understand where it really fits in the arc of the story, an omniscient third person.  Would that we could do the same with our own lives.  The other function of fictional writing is to provide dialog.  (Would you want the contestants on 'Survivor' writing the dialog for the movie about your life?)  'Once and Again' is full of zingers, both dramatic and comedic, especially in the first season.  Judy, Grace, and Zoe get most of the funniest lines, but the rest of the cast -- and sometimes even walk-ons -- have their share, too.  Funny, ironic, and insightful, dialog like this works in several levels, and seeing them all springing to life at the same time is the real charm of 'Once and Again.'",5,"Pasty Midwesterners are

Herskovitz and Zwick of famed ""thirtysomething"", ""My So Called Life"", and ""Relativity"" fame brought this to the screen and it was a true gem. It's basic premise was Lily, 40, just about to go through a divorce, with two girls, and the in's and out's of it all including, and mostly what the storyline dealt with dating again and finding love. There were secondary stories with the ex's and sisters and families and the kids. It dealt with everything that was and is now, and echoes most of our lives that we are living out there.Upon hearing the cancellation of the show, the viewers pulled an all out campaign to save it....to no avail.  But with these upcoming editions on DVD Once and Again is sure to live on in our hearts and minds for everyone to watch and learn and dream.This show was a true work of art and most fans look forward to the next show that the creators put together. When they put the three seasons out on DVD, hopefully with extras for all us true fans that worked hard to keep the show on the air, I would recommend giving this show a chance, it truly is a gem.",5,Wonderful television series,1025222400,"06 28, 2002",2002,1128,"['Excellent', 'series', 'had', 'three', 'year', 'run', 'Herskovitz', 'Zwick', 'famed', 'thirtysomething', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'Relativity', 'fame', 'brought', 'screen', 'was', 'true', 'gem', 'basic', 'premise', 'was', 'Lily', '40', 'just', 'go', 'divorce', 'two', 'girls', 'including', 'mostly', 'what', 'storyline', 'dealt', 'dating', 'again', 'finding', 'love', 'were', 'secondary', 'stories', 'ex', 'sisters', 'families', 'kids', 'everything', 'was', 'now', 'most', 'lives', 'are', 'living', 'out', 'hearing', 'cancellation', 'show', 'viewers', 'pulled', 'out', 'campaign', 'save', 'avail', 'upcoming', 'editions', 'DVD', 'Once', 'Again', 'sure', 'live', 'hearts', 'minds', 'everyone', 'watch', 'learn', 'dream.This', 'show', 'was', 'true', 'work', 'art', 'most', 'fans', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'show', 'creators', 'put', 'together', 'When', 'put', 'three', 'seasons', 'out', 'DVD', 'hopefully', 'extras', 'true', 'fans', 'worked', 'hard', 'keep', 'show', 'air', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'show', 'chance', 'truly', 'gem']",Once and Again - The Complete First Season
600405,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLFY,Robert Moore,"[0, 1]","I did not see ONCE AND AGAIN when it was originally broadcast and have only recently watched Season One after borrowing the DVDs from a friend who is a huge fan.  I also have Season Two to watch, as well as Season Three on tapes.  For years she has anxiously expressed hopes that Season Three will finally be released on DVD.  Sadly, the first two seasons are now out of print.  In every way O&A; seems to be suffering unwarranted abuse on DVD.  Its fans are unable to obtain the third season on DVD and would be fans are unable to experience it for themselves, unless -- like me -- you have a friend who is a big fan.Although a couple of things bugged me about O&A;'s first season, as a whole I found it delightful.  It is vastly better than the frequently offensive thirtysomething, which was not only offensive to women but passionately hated by many people (the only happy women were ""nesting"" women, while single, career-minded women were frequently punished by life for their presumption of desiring more than domestic bliss).  I know the show has its fans, but I know of few shows that has aroused as much out and out hatred as thirtysomething.  I bring this up because there is significant overlap between the creators and production staff of that show and ONCE AND AGAIN.  This was, to be honest, the main reason that I held off for so long in giving O&A; a chance.As anyone who has seen the show knows, ONCE AND AGAIN focuses on two people around 40 who meet and fall in love, as well as on their families, including kids and exes.  There is no real story in Season One apart from the interaction between the various characters.  Luckily, it is a great set of characters that as a viewer I quickly came to like a lot.  Sela Ward is splendid as Lily, the soon-to-be-divorced mother who meets divorced Rick, who is just as appealingly played by Bill Campbell (who most recently was seen on TV in THE 4400 as the enigmatic Jordan Collier and who endeared himself to me when he went on a public campaign to get a guest role on my favorite TV series [and evidently his favorite as well] BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, even offering, to the chagrin of his agent, to work for free -- that didn't work out but we'll see if he shows up on the new BSG prequel CAPRICA).  There are no real weak links on the show.  Those characters we don't like we are supposed to not like.  Most we do.  The on surprise for me is that Evan Rachel Wood, who I knew first came to some prominence on this series, has such a small role in Season One.  My friend the O&A; fanatic assures me that she becomes more important in the series.I'm truly surprised that this show did not manage to stay on the air.  It is not merely better than thirtysomething, it is much better than a show it somewhat resembles but it about to go into its fourth season, BROTHERS AND SISTERS.  But I long ago had to acknowledge that I have no clue as to what will or will not be a hit on American TV.  I find the entire CBS schedule to be nothing less than a horror story, while almost all of the shows I love are either on cable (where their low ratings are not a major issue, like MAD MEN, BREAKING BAD, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) or on one of the major broadcast networks, where they live perpetually imperiled lives (like DOLLHOUSE, CHUCK, PUSHING DAISIES, TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, or ELI STONE).  So while at the end of watching Season One of this excellent series I am surprised that it didn't succeed, I remain grateful that at least I will get to enjoy two more.",5,An absolutely splendid family drama,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,3533,"['did', 'not', 'see', 'ONCE', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'have', 'only', 'recently', 'watched', 'Season', 'One', 'borrowing', 'DVDs', 'friend', 'who', 'huge', 'fan', 'also', 'have', 'Season', 'Two', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'Season', 'Three', 'tapes', 'years', 'anxiously', 'expressed', 'Season', 'Three', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Sadly', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'now', 'print', 'way', 'O', 'A', 'be', 'suffering', 'unwarranted', 'abuse', 'DVD', 'fans', 'are', 'unable', 'obtain', 'third', 'season', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'fans', 'are', 'unable', 'experience', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'big', 'fan.Although', 'couple', 'things', 'bugged', 'O', 'A', 'first', 'season', 'whole', 'found', 'delightful', 'vastly', 'better', 'frequently', 'offensive', 'thirtysomething', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'offensive', 'women', 'passionately', 'hated', 'many', 'people', 'only', 'happy', 'women', 'were', 'nesting', 'women', 'single', 'career-minded', 'women', 'were', 'frequently', 'punished', 'life', 'presumption', 'desiring', 'more', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'know', 'show', 'fans', 'know', 'few', 'shows', 'aroused', 'much', 'out', 'hatred', 'thirtysomething', 'bring', 'up', 'significant', 'overlap', 'creators', 'production', 'staff', 'show', 'ONCE', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'was', 'be', 'honest', 'main', 'reason', 'held', 'off', 'so', 'long', 'giving', 'O', 'A', 'chance.As', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'show', 'ONCE', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'focuses', 'two', 'people', '40', 'who', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'families', 'including', 'kids', 'exes', 'real', 'story', 'Season', 'One', 'apart', 'interaction', 'various', 'characters', 'Luckily', 'great', 'set', 'characters', 'viewer', 'quickly', 'came', 'like', 'lot', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'splendid', 'Lily', 'soon-to-be-divorced', 'mother', 'who', 'divorced', 'Rick', 'who', 'just', 'appealingly', 'played', 'Bill', 'Campbell', 'who', 'most', 'recently', 'was', 'seen', 'TV', 'THE', '4400', 'enigmatic', 'Jordan', 'Collier', 'who', 'endeared', 'when', 'went', 'public', 'campaign', 'get', 'guest', 'role', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', '[', 'evidently', 'favorite', 'as', 'well', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'even', 'offering', 'chagrin', 'agent', 'work', 'free', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', ""'ll"", 'see', 'up', 'new', 'BSG', 'prequel', 'CAPRICA', 'are', 'real', 'weak', 'links', 'show', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'are', 'supposed', 'not', 'like', 'Most', 'do', 'surprise', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'who', 'knew', 'first', 'came', 'prominence', 'series', 'small', 'role', 'Season', 'One', 'My', 'friend', 'O', 'A', 'fanatic', 'assures', 'more', 'important', 'series.I', ""'m"", 'truly', 'surprised', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'manage', 'stay', 'air', 'not', 'merely', 'better', 'thirtysomething', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'go', 'fourth', 'season', 'BROTHERS', 'AND', 'SISTERS', 'long', 'ago', 'had', 'acknowledge', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'will', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'hit', 'American', 'TV', 'find', 'entire', 'CBS', 'schedule', 'be', 'nothing', 'less', 'horror', 'story', 'almost', 'shows', 'love', 'are', 'cable', 'where', 'low', 'ratings', 'are', 'not', 'major', 'issue', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'BREAKING', 'BAD', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'one', 'major', 'broadcast', 'networks', 'where', 'live', 'perpetually', 'imperiled', 'lives', 'DOLLHOUSE', 'CHUCK', 'PUSHING', 'DAISIES', 'TERMINATOR', 'SARAH', 'CONNOR', 'CHRONICLES', 'ELI', 'STONE', 'So', 'end', 'watching', 'Season', 'One', 'excellent', 'series', 'am', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'remain', 'grateful', 'least', 'will', 'get', 'enjoy', 'two', 'more']",Once and Again - The Complete First Season
600406,A2AIPWIP3VZT8N,B00005JLFY,Robert Toombs,"[8, 8]","""Once and Again"" is a prime example of what serialized dramas on television do best: dig in deep.  If this had been a movie based on the same premise--two divorced parents meet and fall in love and try to merge their families--there are whole oceans of emotion and conflict that would have to be glossed over or condensed just to fit into a two-hour running time.  But in an hour-long TV show that goes on for a few years, there's time to give everything the space it needs.  Thus you end up really sinking into the characters' experiences, and they become like members of your own extended family.  You almost feel as if you're experiencing these difficult moments yourself.  But to do this, a show has to be strong in every category: writing, directing, acting, everything.  ""Once and Again"" scores strongly across the board.Others are raving about the kids on the show (Evan Rachel Wood in particular looks like she's turning into a really-truly movie star) and the much-lauded work of Sela Ward.  But Billy Campbell--who I had never liked until this show--is wonderful: his performance is subtle and deep, as his character goes through probably the worst trials of anyone's.  But there are also the supporting and guest actors, like the marvelous Marin Hinkle as Lily's sister, plus Steven Webber doing the best work I've seen from him in years, and David Clennon reprising his Miles Drentell character from ""thirtysomething.""The black-and-white segments, by the way, are not arty affectations, they are key to why the show works.  The entire premise of the series might be boiled down to ""past choices affecting the present,"" and the B&W; segments are almost always about something from a character's past that is directly relevant to what we're seeing them experience in the present of that episode.  Without these interview-style cutaways, the show would have been saddled with endless cumbersome flashbacks; but as is, you get important context on where the character is coming from without wasting too much time, so that each episode can move along at a brisk pace.",5,What Television Does Best,1123804800,"08 12, 2005",2005,2074,"['Once', 'Again', 'prime', 'example', 'what', 'serialized', 'dramas', 'television', 'do', 'best', 'dig', 'deep', 'had', 'been', 'movie', 'based', 'same', 'premise', 'two', 'divorced', 'parents', 'meet', 'fall', 'love', 'try', 'merge', 'families', 'are', 'whole', 'oceans', 'emotion', 'conflict', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'glossed', 'condensed', 'just', 'fit', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'hour-long', 'TV', 'show', 'few', 'years', 'time', 'give', 'everything', 'space', 'Thus', 'end', 'up', 'really', 'sinking', 'characters', 'experiences', 'become', 'members', 'own', 'extended', 'family', 'almost', 'feel', ""'re"", 'experiencing', 'difficult', 'moments', 'do', 'show', 'be', 'strong', 'category', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'everything', 'Once', 'Again', 'strongly', 'board.Others', 'are', 'raving', 'kids', 'show', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'particular', 'looks', 'turning', 'really-truly', 'movie', 'star', 'much-lauded', 'work', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'Billy', 'Campbell', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'liked', 'show', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'subtle', 'deep', 'character', 'probably', 'worst', 'trials', 'anyone', 'are', 'also', 'supporting', 'guest', 'actors', 'marvelous', 'Marin', 'Hinkle', 'Lily', 'sister', 'Steven', 'Webber', 'doing', 'best', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'David', 'Clennon', 'reprising', 'Miles', 'Drentell', 'character', 'thirtysomething', 'black-and-white', 'segments', 'way', 'are', 'not', 'arty', 'affectations', 'are', 'key', 'why', 'show', 'entire', 'premise', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'boiled', 'down', 'past', 'choices', 'affecting', 'present', 'B', 'W', 'segments', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'something', 'character', 'past', 'directly', 'relevant', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'experience', 'present', 'episode', 'interview-style', 'cutaways', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'saddled', 'endless', 'cumbersome', 'flashbacks', 'get', 'important', 'context', 'where', 'character', 'coming', 'wasting', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'so', 'episode', 'can', 'move', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace']",Once and Again - The Complete First Season
