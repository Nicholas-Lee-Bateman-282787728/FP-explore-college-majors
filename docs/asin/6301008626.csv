It uses over 200 locations in the Holy Land, many actors from the region, and is based on portions of the Gospel of Luke.This is the film used by over 1,500 denominations and missions to evangelize, and it has been translated into 877 languages and shown to over five billion people in 228 countries, and is an excellent ""tool"" for this purpose, because it is simple and at the same time very powerful and moving.British actor Brian Deacon is a wonderful Jesus, with a soft but manly voice and perfect enunciation, making the words of Jesus come to life in a very special way.Others of note are Niko Nitai as Simon Peter, Rivka Neuman as Mary, Talia Shapira as Mary Magdalene, and the part of John the Baptist (played by Eli Cohen) is short, but physically the closest I have seen on film to what I imagine the real John looked like.Richard Kiley narrates as Luke, and also listed as narrator is Alexander Scourby.Directed by John Kirsh and Peter Sykes, it has some terrific passages; one of my favorites is the storm at sea (Luke 8:22-25), which is very effective, and the cinematography by Mike Reed, and the locations, a pleasure to watch.The film ends with an invitation to salvation, and with it the promise of ""a full, abundant life, filled with purpose and meaning"", and with a quote from Revelation 3:20: ""Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him"".Total running time is 83 minutes.",5,a powerful film for missionaries,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,1566,"['Taking', 'five', 'years', 'research', 'produce', '1979', 'film', 'meticulous', 'recreation', 'time', 'Jesus', '200', 'locations', 'Holy', 'Land', 'many', 'actors', 'region', 'based', 'portions', 'Gospel', 'Luke.This', 'film', 'used', '1,500', 'denominations', 'missions', 'evangelize', 'been', 'translated', '877', 'languages', 'shown', 'five', 'billion', 'people', '228', 'countries', 'excellent', 'tool', 'purpose', 'simple', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'powerful', 'moving.British', 'actor', 'Brian', 'Deacon', 'wonderful', 'Jesus', 'soft', 'manly', 'voice', 'perfect', 'enunciation', 'making', 'words', 'Jesus', 'come', 'life', 'very', 'special', 'way.Others', 'note', 'are', 'Niko', 'Nitai', 'Simon', 'Peter', 'Rivka', 'Neuman', 'Mary', 'Talia', 'Shapira', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'part', 'John', 'Baptist', 'played', 'Eli', 'Cohen', 'short', 'physically', 'closest', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'what', 'imagine', 'real', 'John', 'looked', 'like.Richard', 'Kiley', 'narrates', 'Luke', 'also', 'listed', 'narrator', 'Alexander', 'Scourby.Directed', 'John', 'Kirsh', 'Peter', 'Sykes', 'terrific', 'passages', 'one', 'favorites', 'storm', 'sea', 'Luke', '8:22-25', 'very', 'effective', 'cinematography', 'Mike', 'Reed', 'locations', 'pleasure', 'watch.The', 'film', 'ends', 'invitation', 'salvation', 'promise', 'full', 'abundant', 'life', 'filled', 'purpose', 'meaning', 'quote', 'Revelation', '3:20', 'Behold', 'stand', 'door', 'knock', 'man', 'hear', 'voice', 'open', 'door', 'will', 'come', '.Total', 'running', 'time', '83', 'minutes']",N/A

It is very accurate and if one reads the gospel along whilst watching the film one will see that they have done a great job. As with any film there are however problems. For instance, the music sounds on the cheap and sometimes the editing feels less then professionally done. Brian Deacon is very good in the role as Jesus and he plays the role with conviction. The ending is not that great and they could have left it out. Even so it was a quite good film.

242629,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6301008626,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","There are many films about our Lord and Savior out there, and they usually offer something different.The 1977 &#34;Jesus of Nazareth&#34; offers a harmonious composition of the 4 Gospels as well as educated speculation. You need 6 1/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.Mr. Gibson's &#34;The Passion&#34; (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)This is a great version if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal &#34;Jesus of Nazareth,&#34; or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense &#34;The Passion.&#34;This film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the &#34;Gospel According to Luke.&#34;  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.Alright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.I'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read &#34;Luke,&#34; you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in &#34;Jesus of Nazareth.&#34; But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.The sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in &#34;The Passion.&#34; But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.Like I said, if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal &#34;Jesus of Nazareth,&#34; and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,&#34; this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.Another thing I should point out is that &#34;The Passion&#34; is NOT child friendly. &#34;Jesus of Nazareth&#34; is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of &#34;The Passion.&#34; But 6 1/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from &#34;Luke.&#34; And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in &#34;The Passion.&#34;Another thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written &#34;Good News Bible.&#34;I like &#34;Jesus of Nazareth&#34; and &#34;The Passion.&#34; And I can suggest this film as well without reservation.",5,"Beautiful Masterpiece, Yet Child Friendly Too.",1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,3168,"['are', 'many', 'films', 'Lord', 'Savior', 'there', 'usually', 'offer', 'something', 'different.The', '1977', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', '34', 'harmonious', 'composition', '4', 'Gospels', 'as', 'well', 'educated', 'speculation', 'need', '6', '1/2', 'hours', 'watch', 'well', 'time.Mr', 'Gibson', '34', 'Passion', '34', '2004', 'was', 'interesting', 'want', 'see', 'just', 'what', 'extent', 'Jesus', 'suffered', 'also', 'give', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'credit', 'underlining', 'mass', 'not', 'only', 'reenactment', 'Last', 'Supper', 'also', 'sorrowful', 'events', 'Good', 'Friday', 'glorious', 'events', 'Easter', 'Sunday', 'far', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'child', 'friendly', 'version', 'great', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '6', '1/2', 'hours', 'watch', 'phenomenal', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'up', 'brutal', 'intense', '34', 'Passion.', '34', 'film', 'kept', '2', 'hour', 'length', 'tradeoff', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'ONLY', '34', 'Gospel', 'According', 'Luke.', '34', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'everyone', 'felt', 'obligated', 'point', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'best', 'scenes', '4', 'Gospels.Alright', 'subject', 'hand', 'film', 'Mary', 'being', 'visited', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'thing', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'help', 'keep', 'film', '2', 'hours', 'narration', 'used', 'explain', 'shift', 'event', 'event.I', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'have', 'read', '34', 'Luke', '34', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'follow', 'can', 'however', 'say', 'film', 'done', 'beautiful', 'style', 'dignity', 'not', 'overdone', 'Brian', 'Deacon', 'Jesus', ""n't"", 'play', 'role', 'same', 'intensity', 'Robert', 'Powell', 'did', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth.', '34', 'Deacon', 'role', 'gentle', 'dignity', 'real', 'feeling', 'beauty', 'lessons', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'fierceness', 'Jesus', 'frustrations', 'Robert', 'Powell', 'did', 'can', 'feel', 'frustration', 'when', 'annoyed.The', 'sorrowful', 'Good', 'Friday', 'scenes', 'are', 'certainly', 'nowhere', 'as', 'brutal', 'ones', '34', 'Passion.', '34', 'still', 'get', 'idea', 'how', 'much', 'Jesus', 'suffering', 'glorious', 'events', 'Easter', 'Sunday', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done.Like', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '6', '1/2', 'hours', 'watch', 'phenomenal', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'quite', 'up', 'brutality', ""'The"", 'Passion', '34', '1979', 'Brian', 'Deacon', 'film', 'perfect', 'alternative.Another', 'thing', 'should', 'point', 'out', '34', 'Passion', '34', 'NOT', 'child', 'friendly', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', '34', 'middle', 'certainly', 'nowhere', 'brutality', '34', 'Passion.', '34', '6', '1/2', 'hours', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'children', 'One', 'great', 'thing', 'film', 'Brian', 'Deacon', 'really', 'child', 'friendly', 'lessons', 'are', 'there', 'drawn', 'accurately', '34', 'Luke.', '34', 'suffering', 'Good', 'Friday', 'there', 'not', 'overdone', '34', 'Passion.', '34', 'thing', 'film', 'good', 'children', 'most', 'footage', 'taken', 'simply', 'also', 'beautifully', 'written', '34', 'Good', 'News', 'Bible.', '34', 'like', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', '34', '34', 'Passion.', '34', 'can', 'suggest', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'reservation']",N/A

242631,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6301008626,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[19, 22]","It is impossible to overestimate the important of this 1979 film, for it has made an impact in even the most primitive regions of the earth, places where men and women are only now hearing about Jesus for the first time.  This definitive, rigorously scriptural movie version of the life of Jesus Christ has been seen by over five billion people around the globe, reaching 236 different nations in over 800 languages.  It has helped win innumerable souls to Christ all over the world, and even now, under the aegis of Campus Crusade For Christ, local churches and individuals are coming together in an effort to send a free copy of the movie to every home in the United States.  The movie was a dream over three decades in the making, with five years of pre-production work preceding the seven-month filming that took place in 1978 at a multitude of sites in Israel.  Intense efforts, involving the collaboration of numerous scholars from the whole gamut of Christian churches, went into making Jesus as accurate as it could possibly be - from vintage pottery to historically accurate costuming to sufficient cinders residing behind burning torches, every effort was made to take the audience back to Jesus' time.  It is a non-denominational Christian film; while some churches might quibble about an omission here or a suggestion there, this movie is the story of Jesus and not the story of any particular kind of Christian religion.The movie is based solely on the Gospel of Luke, and the dialogue you hear is taken straight out of the Bible.  Jesus says nothing in this film that He does not say in Luke's account of his life.  Naturally, every facet of Jesus' life could not be covered here, but the movie does a superb job of showing us who Jesus was and how He lived, taught, suffered, and died for the sins of all humanity.  Brian Deacon does a superb job playing Jesus, and Niko Nitai truly shines in his portrayal of Simon Peter.  At times, the film does seem to jump from one scene to another rather quickly, but this goes back to the authenticity upon which the film was founded.  In a sense, Jesus' ministry was spent walking toward Jerusalem and His death on the cross, so we see Jesus and his disciples walking almost continuously; furthermore, Jesus' teachings, as recorded in Luke's Gospel, are a collection of parables and religious instruction originating from many different events in the life of the Savior.  Jesus took His message to the people instead of letting the people come to Him.The suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.  Even non-Christians will be impressed by the commitment, scrupulous attention to detail, and cinematic mastery that went into the making of this film.",5,The most widely viewed film of all time,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,3287,"['impossible', 'overestimate', 'important', '1979', 'film', 'made', 'impact', 'even', 'most', 'primitive', 'regions', 'earth', 'places', 'where', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'only', 'now', 'hearing', 'Jesus', 'first', 'time', 'definitive', 'rigorously', 'scriptural', 'movie', 'version', 'life', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'been', 'seen', 'five', 'billion', 'people', 'globe', 'reaching', '236', 'different', 'nations', '800', 'languages', 'helped', 'win', 'innumerable', 'souls', 'Christ', 'world', 'even', 'now', 'aegis', 'Campus', 'Crusade', 'Christ', 'local', 'churches', 'individuals', 'are', 'coming', 'together', 'effort', 'send', 'free', 'copy', 'movie', 'home', 'United', 'States', 'movie', 'was', 'dream', 'three', 'decades', 'making', 'five', 'years', 'pre-production', 'work', 'preceding', 'seven-month', 'filming', 'took', 'place', '1978', 'multitude', 'sites', 'Israel', 'Intense', 'efforts', 'involving', 'collaboration', 'numerous', 'scholars', 'whole', 'gamut', 'Christian', 'churches', 'went', 'making', 'Jesus', 'as', 'accurate', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'vintage', 'pottery', 'historically', 'accurate', 'costuming', 'sufficient', 'cinders', 'residing', 'burning', 'torches', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'take', 'audience', 'back', 'Jesus', 'time', 'non-denominational', 'Christian', 'film', 'churches', 'might', 'quibble', 'omission', 'here', 'suggestion', 'there', 'movie', 'story', 'Jesus', 'not', 'story', 'particular', 'kind', 'Christian', 'religion.The', 'movie', 'based', 'solely', 'Gospel', 'Luke', 'dialogue', 'hear', 'taken', 'straight', 'Bible', 'Jesus', 'nothing', 'film', 'not', 'say', 'Luke', 'account', 'life', 'Naturally', 'facet', 'Jesus', 'life', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'covered', 'here', 'movie', 'superb', 'job', 'showing', 'who', 'Jesus', 'was', 'how', 'lived', 'taught', 'suffered', 'died', 'sins', 'humanity', 'Brian', 'Deacon', 'superb', 'job', 'playing', 'Jesus', 'Niko', 'Nitai', 'truly', 'portrayal', 'Simon', 'Peter', 'times', 'film', 'seem', 'jump', 'one', 'scene', 'rather', 'quickly', 'back', 'authenticity', 'film', 'was', 'founded', 'sense', 'Jesus', 'ministry', 'was', 'spent', 'walking', 'Jerusalem', 'death', 'cross', 'see', 'Jesus', 'disciples', 'walking', 'almost', 'continuously', 'furthermore', 'Jesus', 'teachings', 'recorded', 'Luke', 'Gospel', 'are', 'collection', 'parables', 'religious', 'instruction', 'originating', 'many', 'different', 'events', 'life', 'Savior', 'Jesus', 'took', 'message', 'people', 'instead', 'letting', 'people', 'come', 'Him.The', 'suffering', 'Jesus', 'handled', 'quite', 'well', 'here', 'clearly', 'portraying', 'horrific', 'nature', 'death', 'crucifixion', 'making', 'disturbing', 'enough', 'scare', 'young', 'children', 'do', 'see', 'scourging', 'Jesus', 'driving', 'nails', 'wrists', 'feet', 'director', 'seemed', 'set', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'scenes', 'powerful', 'film', 'won', 'innumerable', 'souls', 'world', 'tell', 'someone', 'Jesus', 'one', 'thing', 'show', 'person', 'such', 'captivating', 'format', 'film', 'exactly', 'who', 'Jesus', 'was', 'how', 'suffered', 'died', 'sins', 'humanity', 'powerful', 'missionary', 'tool', 'Even', 'non-Christians', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'commitment', 'scrupulous', 'attention', 'detail', 'cinematic', 'mastery', 'went', 'making', 'film']",N/A

They leave out so many years and do not fully explain or dramatize very important details.  Filmed in Israel.

The producers of this movie did painstaking research for many years, and they sought to be accurate in the little details, not only of the clothing and village life, but the ways the people talked and recited the prayers.  The filmmakers sought and succeeded in making a very accurate depiction of the life of Christ as taught in the Holy Bible.The Jesus Film has been seen by over 4.7 billion people in 236 nations and thousands of people have accepted Christ as their personal Savior through this remarkable movie.  More people have watched this movie than any other movie in history. It is based on the Gospel of Luke and sticks very closely to the biblical text. (There is very little outside interpretation or extraneous material.)  This is its most valuable asset.  Watching this movie is like taking a picturesque tour of the Gospel of Luke.Brian Deacon is a charismatic and believable Jesus. He speaks with authority.  He also displays different emotions -- he smiles and treats children with great affection; he is stern toward the religious leaders and hypocrites.  He also displays sadness and grief.  Brian Deacon also looks like a man in his 30's, which Jesus was when He began His earthly ministry after being a carpenter for so many years.Many of the familiar scenes are depicted in this movie (The Birth, the Baptism, the Teachings, Healings, Trials, Suffering, Death and Resurrection).  There are certain scenes in the Gospel of Luke which are  depicted in this movie which don't appear in other Jesus films except the Gospel of Matthew - Visual Bible (e.g. The Transfiguration,  The healing of the Gadarene demoniac;  Jesus' praying in Gethsemane and sweating drops of blood, then being strengthened by the angel).What is so useful about this movie is that it is dubbed very precisely in so many languages.  This particular DVD features the spoken languages of English, Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portugese, Mandarin (Chinese), and Spanish.  The subtitles are done in English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic.  If you look at the wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary of how the movie was dubbed, you'll see that they selected trained experts to read the text in the native language and they timed it to the milli-second to make it precisely right.  So, when Jesus speaks, it looks and sounds as if He is speaking the native language.There are wonderful Special Features in this DVD:Besides Direct Scene Access, there is a documentary of Knowing Jesus Personally, where the gospel message is presented and the teachings of Jesus are explained.  There is the Behind-the-Scenes look at how the film was made.  There is also a Tribute to Jesus from people like George Bush, Larry King, David Copperfield, Billy Graham, Mother Theresa, and others.There is also a bonus DVD of the story of Jesus for Children.Even though the acting may not be up to par as Hollywood, they do a good enough job.  The biggest plus of this movie is how faithful it is to the biblical text. An added plus at the end of the film is a complete and clear presentation of the Gospel message.I bought several copies of this DVD for my friends and church members and they have found it very useful.  I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.

Not every event in the film is in Luke's gospel or vice versa.  But I enjoy this film nonetheless.It is filmed in the Holy land and most of the actors are like those you see in that land.  The acting is excellent.  I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children.  Not like today, where people claim that ""they are for the children"" but then vote for politicians who saddle the children with an unbearable debt.  At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks ""who acted as this man's neighbor?"" and a small child answers.  In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.In the film you will often hear background voices.  For example there is the occasion where a poor old lady deposits two small copper coins into the Temple treasury, since all she had were those two coins.  As she is doing this, you can hear people in the background commenting, in cockneyed accents, ""only a mite?"" ""can't she give more?"" ""it's very little.""

Throughout the movie, Jesus speaks in parables to teach his followers truth. He calls his disciples and empowers them to convey God's messages to a wider audience.Jesus' Miracles in this movie included the Feeding of the 5,000, Calming the Storm, Raising Jairus' Daughter, and giving site to the blind. The Last Supper is portrayed and then the Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus starts to make this movie more dramatic. This movie very briefly touches on all the trials and then draws you into the emotional aspects of Jesus' Crucifixion.

This is very well-made film, and the actors give some excellent performances.  ""Jesus"" makes a great complement for Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" as one film is about the suffering of Jesus and His death on the cross for the remission of our sins, and the other is about His life, ministry & teachings.  ""The Story of Jesus for Children"" follows the story of the Christ through the eyes of children living during the time of Jesus' ministry.  One of the kids is the son of a Pharisee who thinks Jesus is a charlatan and instructs his child to stay away from his friends who do believe in Jesus.  This production is a great tool for parents who want to show their children who Jesus is.  ""The Jesus Film"" is a great DVD set, and a must-have for your DVD library whether you do believe in Jesus or not.

It has the power to truly change lives. Brian Deacon shines as Jesus. The things that detract from the film are mediocre acting by most of the supporting cast and some choppy editing. Other than this, a truly mesmerizing movie experience. But the best film version of the Gospels is the 2000 Miniseries version starring Jeremy Sisto (I also here that Mel Gibson's film ""The Passion"" is really good, but I won't decide until I see it this Easter).Note: This is the 120 Minute Version.

As cinema, it's just plain dull; the photography is washed-out (as it was even when the film was new), the zoom lens is overused, and the special effects, minimal as they are, get really cheesy.  Everything is exposition, and it's not terribly competent exposition at that.Some continuity gaffes create unintentional hilarity.  For example, when Jesus dips his head in the water for a total-immersion baptism, his hair never seems to get wet.  (This is a miracle we haven't read about, folks.)Extras are fun, including a short documentary about the Jesus Film Project, which carts this particular film all around the world as an evangelical tool.  Especially surreal is an hour-long compendium of pious testimonials from such luminaries as George Bush XLI and David Copperfield (huh?).The soft but adequate full-frame transfer on this DVD doesn't leave out any significant information -- I suspect the film was shot open matte.  But many of the compositions are so inept that you'll swear they were cropped at the sides anyway.Catholics beware: This film presents a very Protestant-American Jesus, with its emphasis on a ""personal relationship with God"" and other faith concepts that Mother Church could find potentially heretical.
