Every so often you stumble upon something or someone who is so unique (or just does the format so much better than it's ever been done before) that you know you are witnessing something you will never see again.Mr. Cohen interviews people (most are well known) as one of his alter egos.  As Ali G. (the hiphop wannabe who still lives with his grandmother - try to imagine a British Kevin Federline with no Britney money) his questions are beyond stupid, as Borat the reporter from Khazakhstan his questions are in-your-face offensive, racist, and sexist but somehow we Americans are more forgiving to this strange man from a country most have never heard of, and last but not least, Bruno, the gayest piece of Eurotrash there ever was.We are treated to interview after interview from Pat Buchanan to Andy Rooney to real estate agents to a minister who claims he can convert gay people to straight.  They have no idea who they are really talking with and two things amaze me.  One is that Mr. Cohen never breaks character and the other is to see their reactions to some of the questions.  This DVD also puts Americans to the test exposing us warts and all to what we really think.My challenge to describe Sacha Baron Cohen as anything other than a ""genius"" at the beginning of my comment should also include a challenge to watch this only once.

923610,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,B000A88ESW,David Bonesteel,"[3, 3]","The success of the ""Borat"" movie has boosted the popularity of British comedian Sascha Baron Cohen in the United States.  This series dates to the time when he had only a cult following, but his nerve and talent for improvisation is on full display.  In order to conduct interviews of unsuspecting subjects, who think they are going to meet a serious journalist, he adopts the personas of Ali G, the confused white wannabe rapper with a flair for malapropisms, Borat, the journalist from Kazahkstan whose disarmingly friendly, ingratiating manner masks his anti-Semitism and hatred of women, and Bruno, the flaming Austrian fashion reporter who regularly and innocently makes assumptions about the sexuality of his subjects, leading to some uncomfortable encounters.  These are all brilliant comic performances.  He is always funny, even though he sometimes comes off as a bit of a bully when he is making fun of people who seem harmless.  However, the show reveals its genius when he has an opportunity to skewer a worthy target, such as the celebrity makeover artist who freely speculates on Jesus Christ's potential as a male model and the members of a private Texas hunt club who are proud of killing endangered species and lament that they are not allowed to hunt Jews.

As a result, he's able to get away with things that would be impossible relatively soon after.  His bogus interviews with celebrities and non-celebrities alike are equally hilarious.  He pulls out his three now-famous characters: white gangsta rapper, Ali G; endearingly bigoted and clueless Borat; and the faaaaabulous Bruno.  All have their unique appeals, and I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favorite.  It's mind-boggling that Cohen's targets can't quickly figure out they're getting punked, but I think that's a symptom of how much certain people are affected by TV cameras.I know some people find him tiresome today, as I did to a degree after the ""Bruno"" film, but viewing ""Ali G"" brings back the laughs that made me love Cohen in the first place.

So think about comparing the price of the individual first and second season releases before investing inDa Compleet Seereez. The DVDs arrived earlier this week, my older son and I watched all 12 episodes in two nights, and we laughed out loud like it was the first time we ever saw the show. Well, actually it was the first time my son saw the show, and he got his first lessons in Socratic Irony.The Ali G character is funny, and remember it is this series that also introduced theBoratandBr&uuml;nocharacters to the US as well. Sacha Baron Cohen takes his characters, puts them in interview mode with unassuming real people--often famous people--that believe they are actually participating in some kind of talk show. And the result is usually hilarity. The funniest part being the reaction to each character by the people that he is duping. Cohen's Ali G character (a stereotypical hip-hop, British ghetto banger TV host), Borat (a Kazakhstani reporter naive to US culture), and Br&uuml;no (a stereotypical gay mannerismed TV host) have the same modus operandi....And that modus operandi is Socratic Irony; Cohen's characters deliberately feign ignorance in order to expose weakness in the commitment that people have to being so politically correct that they almost always seriously (attempt to) answer the ridiculous opinions and questions that Cohen's characters come up with. Hence, his victims look equally stupid.The only victim that I ever saw that had enough intelligence to quickly walk out of the situation without any regard to whether or not he was offending a Cohen character (Ali G) was Donald Trump.Even if you were a fan of this show almost 10 years ago now, trust me when I say that if the last time you saw the show (like me) was when it was on HBO, you will enjoy watching these episodes again today just as if it were the first time you were seeing them.If you've never seen this show: Check. It. Out. But don't be fooled into being offended by any of the Cohen characters. They are not real; the man behind the mask really isn't that stupid. He's trying to make YOU look stupid.
