I mean they could have shown him going off to marry, or being gun down, but no.However, these Gunsmoke seasons are well package, short on extra features, but with great video and sound and even sub-titles!

Festus was very good ( as a fur trader and his other bit parts) but in the latter episodes he kinda gets on my nerves like some stated Dillon was on for a few minutes then others took over.

Chester is being ""phased out"" and Festus is being ""phased in"". (Dennis Weaver left the show after season 9.) Also, you can see where Matt Dillon also started being on the show less and less. In many of these episodes it's almost just a walk on.  (I'm sorry Gunsmoke just isn't the same without Matt Dillon.)I'm still debating on whether I will purchase season 10. I may get season 10 and then stop. I do like the character of Festus (but I preferred Chester). But season 10 is still in B/W, and as the show progressed through the years, Matt Dillon is barely on the show.This volume has English subtitles for the hearing impaired.
