875710,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B0006Z2NB8,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[0, 0]","Based on a script of Pier Paolo Passolini this film would be regarded as the Italian version of Rashomon. A Roman prostitute has been brutally murdered in a park near the Tiber River and in order to forward their investigation, the police corner a handful of people who were in the park at the time. As they separately tell their versions of why they were there and what they did, their narrations do not necessarily match the images on the screen that do reflect the truth.But the film works out as one of the last brilliant gems of the Italian Neo-Realism. The miserable existence of this bunch of people, hopeless and terribly anguished who just live for the very moment with plans or illusions of a better life.Although the movie is a mite dated, it works due its powerful message.

875711,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B0006Z2NB8,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","Bertolucci, while a cinephile, had spent very little time on actual movie sets before making this film at age 21.It's a Rashomon like exploration of the murder of a prostitute.  We see various men being questioned by police in astylized way - we never see the questioner, only the witness, sitting in a pool of harsh light.  We hear the man beginto tell what he did or saw on the fateful day, while cutting to images of his actual experience, often at odds with whatwe hear him telling the police.  By the end of the film we get a picture of what happened that night for each of thesemen and the woman who was killed.  Beautifully photographed, with an excellent sense of composition, it's a prettystrong little film.There are weak spots; the acting is variable at best, in a few cases cringe-inducingly over the top.  Also, much of thedialogue was evidently post recorded, so even though the actors are Italians speaking Italian, their mouths are sometimesout of sync with their voices, and the dialogue often has a tinny artificial quality.But quibbles aside, the film has a haunting quality that marks the start of a great film-maker's career, and makes thiswell worth seeing.",4,An impressive and audacious debut,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1179,"['Bertolucci', 'cinephile', 'had', 'spent', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'actual', 'movie', 'sets', 'making', 'film', 'age', '21.It', 'Rashomon', 'exploration', 'murder', 'prostitute', 'see', 'various', 'men', 'being', 'questioned', 'police', 'astylized', 'way', 'never', 'see', 'questioner', 'only', 'witness', 'sitting', 'pool', 'harsh', 'light', 'hear', 'man', 'beginto', 'tell', 'what', 'did', 'saw', 'fateful', 'day', 'cutting', 'images', 'actual', 'experience', 'often', 'odds', 'whatwe', 'hear', 'telling', 'police', 'end', 'film', 'get', 'picture', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'thesemen', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Beautifully', 'photographed', 'excellent', 'sense', 'composition', 'prettystrong', 'little', 'are', 'weak', 'spots', 'acting', 'variable', 'best', 'few', 'cases', 'cringe-inducingly', 'top', 'Also', 'much', 'thedialogue', 'was', 'evidently', 'post', 'recorded', 'so', 'even', 'actors', 'are', 'Italians', 'speaking', 'Italian', 'mouths', 'are', 'sometimesout', 'sync', 'voices', 'dialogue', 'often', 'tinny', 'artificial', 'quality.But', 'quibbles', 'aside', 'film', 'haunting', 'quality', 'start', 'great', 'film-maker', 'career', 'thiswell', 'worth', 'seeing']",La Commare Secca
875712,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0006Z2NB8,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[13, 14]","Death suggests the ultimate end for an individual and it often travels together with fear stemming from awareness of the unknown destination after the heart ceases to beat.  The destination after death has been taught by religious leaders for several millennia and frequently the tales after death include those of devils, demons, and other scary creatures that embed fear in the listeners.  Tales told in regards to life after death reveal, as many religious leaders have suggested, that the destination is based on the choices made while alive.  Thus, these choices better have a moral direction where the person abides to the rules of the society, or consequences might be dire when the heart halts.  However, when death arrives to a poor soul those who live must deal with the remains of the deceased, which heavily will affect the destination thereafter.Bernardo Bertolucci's tale La Commare Secca opens with the camera in a tilted lower angle on a bridge while the sound of a car swooshes by, as some pages are thrown over the edge of the bridge.  The camera pans with the pages that drift with the wind, which gives the audience a good view of the Tiber river and the apartment complexes across the river.  Increasingly the wind speeds up the movement of the falling pages as they blow along the man-made river bank.  The pages appear to be newspaper pages as they get stuck in the high grass.  Some pages struggle to get free from the grass as the wind keeps tearing at them.  Slowly the panning camera moves out of focus and then back into focus as it's attention is aimed at the drifting pages.  Suddenly the camera stops it's panning motion, and playfully soothing music appears in the background.  The camera has discovered a body, a dead body of a woman laying face down in the grass as the pages drift over her body.  The camera zooms out and gives the audience another view of the river while keeping the body of the woman in the lower right corner of the framed image, which is followed by the title.The story that Bertolucci depicts is based on a story by the late artist, philosopher, and filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini, and he gives the story an honest portrayal.  Brilliantly Bertolucci begins with the audience discovering the body, not a character in the story, but through the camera the audience is making a macabre discovery of what seems to be a murder.  Newspaper pages give the bizarre discovery a true, yet grotesque analogy of the situation, as the dead woman is not the only story, but her story is surrounded by numerous similar stories.  Yet, the dead woman's story manifests itself through the presence of her body.An investigations follows the discovery of the dead woman, as the police begin to question suspects for information that could lead to the capture of the murderer.  The interrogations of the suspects are filmed in the perspective of the audience, as if the viewer were the cross-examiner or present in the room.  Several suspects are brought in for questioning such as a young unemployed man, a freeloader, a soldier, a drifter, and two teenagers.  In the cross-examination the suspects are asked who they are, how old they are, where they come from, where were they before they ended up in the vicinity of the murder, and why they were at the area of the murder.  Each person gives a detailed description after they are more or less cooperative with the police.  The narrative accounts from the suspects are displayed as flashbacks to the audience, as the audience is allowed to make their own judgment based on the accounts.The suspects all are given the opportunity tell their story, but they are never free from suspicion from the audience or the police.  Being in the wrong place at the wrong time has burdened all suspects with an internal fear of merely being under suspicion, as they are all aware of the seriousness of the situation.  There is also more fundamental power at work, the power of moral enlightenment provided by a catholic upbringing.  In some it is more evident than others, as some of the suspects have a dubious background and former experiences with law enforcement.  In addition, the suspects know all too well that being in a park at night is often connected with some immoral or indecent act.  The stories within the story give the audience several insightful perceptions of the 1960s Italian lifestyle and culture and also on human interaction.  This enhances character development in the film, which is essential as it will eventually lead to how the audience perceives each character -- guilty or not.La Commare Secca was Bertolucci's first feature which he framed poetically as each scene provides more than what meets the eye.  This visual poetry, which could be seen in the opening scene offered the world great promise of his talent.  He later made films such as Il Conformista (1970), 1900 (1976), and Sheltering Sky (1990), which are all wonderful films.  The organization of the flashbacks in La Commare Secca brings a vivid visual expression of the story in it's entirety, as the characters avoid everything connected with the bestial act.  This is thanks to Bertolucci's understanding of human behavior in Italian culture, which is heavily influenced by the Catholic Church and family.  In addition, the film has strong influences of Pasolini, which was desired by the producer.  Ultimately, Bertolucci leaves the world with a cinematic experience that is visually stunning and brave, as it will leave the viewers thinking for some time.",4,Bertolucci's First Cinematic

875713,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,B0006Z2NB8,Richard J. Brzostek,"[1, 1]","The grim reaper is the icon of death; he is a figure that is feared all over the world, as his only goal is to take life away. However, The Grim Reaper isn't a horror movie, but more of an Italian murder-mystery. Although the title and opening sequence are morbid, the rest of the story isn't gruesome.The story begins with a woman's body being found under a bridge. The police are investigating her murder and interview men who were in the park the night she was killed. All of them are shady characters and they tell their stories about their lives just before the murder. The flashback stories we see are mostly about lovers and would-be lovers, but as nearly all of them have a degree of money problems, so they all appear potentially suspicious.What I liked the most about the movie was when the stories get to the park. We see the same place, just from various viewpoints. The further we get into the movie, the more we see the personal stories of everyone that was in the park that night. The park has a surreal feeling to it - as if it was a place where time stands still and lives on and on in the stories that are told about that night. As we watch the stories that have little to do with anything violent, we are always reminded that there is a murder among those at the park. We swing back and forth between the problems people face in everyday life to the realization there is a killer among the people. The Grim Reaper keeps its viewer guessing as we take in the details of the people who were a witness, if not the murder itself, to the location of a murder.",5,an Italian murder-mystery,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,1573,"['grim', 'reaper', 'icon', 'death', 'figure', 'feared', 'world', 'only', 'goal', 'take', 'life', 'away', 'However', 'Grim', 'Reaper', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'Italian', 'murder-mystery', 'title', 'opening', 'sequence', 'are', 'morbid', 'rest', 'story', ""n't"", 'gruesome.The', 'story', 'woman', 'body', 'being', 'found', 'bridge', 'police', 'are', 'investigating', 'murder', 'interview', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'park', 'night', 'was', 'killed', 'are', 'shady', 'characters', 'tell', 'stories', 'lives', 'just', 'murder', 'flashback', 'see', 'are', 'mostly', 'lovers', 'would-be', 'lovers', 'nearly', 'have', 'degree', 'money', 'problems', 'appear', 'potentially', 'suspicious.What', 'liked', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'stories', 'get', 'park', 'see', 'same', 'place', 'just', 'various', 'viewpoints', 'further', 'get', 'movie', 'more', 'see', 'personal', 'stories', 'everyone', 'was', 'park', 'night', 'park', 'surreal', 'feeling', 'was', 'place', 'where', 'time', 'still', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'night', 'watch', 'stories', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'anything', 'violent', 'are', 'always', 'reminded', 'murder', 'park', 'swing', 'back', 'forth', 'problems', 'people', 'face', 'everyday', 'life', 'realization', 'killer', 'people', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'viewer', 'guessing', 'take', 'details', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'witness', 'not', 'murder', 'location', 'murder']",La Commare Secca

Then when speaking of his own work - he says that it was as if all his efforts were in vain - as the critics judged it as a copy of Pasolini. This judgement is very unfortunate - despite the fact that the story was written by Pasolini and the class of people to which it pertains is Pasolini's beloved lower class - this film has a radically different feeling from anything Pasolini ever did.I am kind of a bit unsure as to whether this film rates 4 or 5 stars - certainly it is the work of a very young director and lacks the fine tuning of later Bertolucci films.
