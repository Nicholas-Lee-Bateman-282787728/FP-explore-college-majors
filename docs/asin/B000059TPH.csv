574945,A2XFA2HIIKS5G2,B000059TPH,Bentley,"[8, 8]","Helen McCrory did an exceptional job in capturing the majesty and the desperation of Anna Karenina.  The ""vaults"" of Tolstoy joined two characters Levin and Anna in their unbridled passion for life with much different end results and paths.  I cannot imagine anyone else capturing more the essence of Tolstoy's major female protagonist than Helen McCrory did.Stephen Dillane did a fabulous job in the role of Alexei Karenin and Kevin McKidd perfected the character of Count Vronsky .  I think that Stephen Dillane's interpretation of Alexei was so superb that it surprised me; and I gained such a depth of understanding for this character because of his portrayal; much more than in reading the novel which I loved.At first, I wavered because I did not feel that Oblonsky was cast properly; but despite the difference in appearance; this role was executed perfectly.  I cannot understand how Douglas Henshall was cast as Levin with his thick Scottish brogue but even that was overlooked as you got more and more into the story.The acting was that good.  I would recommend this highly.  This gripped me from beginning to end.  And after seeing how Anna was treated during the ballroom scene at Betsy's, you understand the double standard that existed then and in some ways is still with us today.For such a long novel, this rendition was perfectly paced and executed brilliantly.  Very enjoyable.  You will not regret taking the time to watch this series.

Anna is rather ordinary looking, while the Anna of Tolstoy's novel is strikingly beautiful!! I like McKidd as an actor, but as a Russian Count?

574947,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B000059TPH,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[6, 7]","If you follow my reviews, you know I felt the 10 hour 1977 version with Nicola Pagett (Anna), Eric Porter (Karenin), and Stuart Wilson (Vronsky) was a phenomenal masterpiece. (10 hours, and not one dull moment.)Even though I did not expect this version to be as good, I did like Stephen Dillane as Horatio in Mel Gibson's ""Hamlet."" And I thought he would be a good Karenin.Onto the subject at hand. The basic plot line is this. Anna starts out as an angel like character when she tries to reconcile her brother Steva and his wife Dolly. (Steva was cheating on her.) She reconciles them, but problems arise.Without meaning to do so, she breaks Kitty's (Dolly's sister's) hopes of a marriage with Vronsky (Kevin McKidd) because Vronsky finds Anna attractive. At first, she resists Vronsky. (She is after all married and has a son.)However, she later finds she feels the same way towards Vronsky. This leads to her ruining her reputation with a scandal and losing her son. (She can't even go out in public eventually.) And to top it off, she starts going mad which gradually destroys her relationship with Vronsky.Overall, these people did a decent job of putting this into 4 hours. But if you have seen the 1977 10 hour version, you probably will miss a lot of the subtle unfolding of events as well as characters gradually revealing different layers of themselves.While Nicola Pagett is Anna to me, Helen McCrory does a fairly decent job in Anna's transition from an angel to a psychotic mess.Stuart Wilson is Vronsky to me. But I did like Kevin McKidd. Like Stuart Wilson, McKidd convincingly portrays Vronsky's journey from a lustful passionate unlikable stalker, to someone who finds out he really loved the wrong person, to knowing that what he has done was wrong, and then finally a physically and emotionally worn out sympathetic character.Eric Porter is Karenin to me. But I do like how Stephen Dillane did Karenin. He seems to bring out an interesting angle. Anna says Karenin has no feelings, but Dillane proves her wrong. Karenin DOES have feelings. It's just that while Anna and Vronsky are controlled by their feelings, Karenin tries to control his feelings. (Not exactly a horrible thing. Notice he's the only one of the 3 who never tries to kill himself.) But that he suffers from the events of the story is evident.One strange thing is that unlike Porter /Pagett, Stephen Dillane is not obviously older than Anna. Dillane is still a really sympathetic Karenin; but I'm sure some viewers wouldn't have found Anna's choice to leave Karenin in this version such an understandable choice.Overall, it's an alright 2nd best version if you don't have 10 hours to watch the best version.",3,The Story Really Needed the 10 Hours,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,2693,"['follow', 'reviews', 'know', 'felt', '10', 'hour', '1977', 'version', 'Nicola', 'Pagett', 'Anna', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Karenin', 'Stuart', 'Wilson', 'Vronsky', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'masterpiece', '10', 'hours', 'not', 'one', 'dull', 'moment', 'Even', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'version', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'did', 'like', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Horatio', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Hamlet', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'Karenin.Onto', 'subject', 'hand', 'basic', 'plot', 'line', 'Anna', 'out', 'angel', 'character', 'when', 'reconcile', 'brother', 'Steva', 'wife', 'Dolly', 'Steva', 'was', 'cheating', 'problems', 'arise.Without', 'meaning', 'do', 'so', 'Kitty', 'Dolly', 'sister', 'marriage', 'Vronsky', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'Vronsky', 'Anna', 'attractive', 'first', 'Vronsky', 'married', 'son', 'However', 'later', 'same', 'way', 'Vronsky', 'ruining', 'reputation', 'scandal', 'losing', 'son', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'out', 'public', 'eventually', 'top', 'off', 'going', 'mad', 'gradually', 'relationship', 'Vronsky.Overall', 'people', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'putting', '4', 'hours', 'have', 'seen', '1977', '10', 'hour', 'version', 'probably', 'will', 'miss', 'lot', 'subtle', 'unfolding', 'events', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'gradually', 'revealing', 'different', 'layers', 'themselves.While', 'Nicola', 'Pagett', 'Anna', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'Anna', 'transition', 'angel', 'psychotic', 'mess.Stuart', 'Wilson', 'Vronsky', 'did', 'like', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'Stuart', 'Wilson', 'McKidd', 'convincingly', 'Vronsky', 'journey', 'lustful', 'passionate', 'unlikable', 'stalker', 'someone', 'who', 'out', 'really', 'loved', 'wrong', 'person', 'knowing', 'what', 'done', 'was', 'wrong', 'then', 'finally', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'worn', 'out', 'sympathetic', 'character.Eric', 'Porter', 'Karenin', 'do', 'how', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'did', 'Karenin', 'bring', 'out', 'interesting', 'angle', 'Anna', 'Karenin', 'feelings', 'Dillane', 'wrong', 'Karenin', 'DOES', 'have', 'feelings', 'just', 'while', 'Anna', 'Vronsky', 'are', 'controlled', 'feelings', 'Karenin', 'control', 'feelings', 'Not', 'exactly', 'horrible', 'thing', 'Notice', 'only', 'one', '3', 'who', 'never', 'kill', 'events', 'story', 'evident.One', 'strange', 'thing', 'Porter', '/Pagett', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'not', 'obviously', 'older', 'Anna', 'Dillane', 'still', 'really', 'sympathetic', 'Karenin', ""'m"", 'sure', 'viewers', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'Anna', 'choice', 'leave', 'Karenin', 'version', 'understandable', 'choice.Overall', 'alright', '2nd', 'best', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '10', 'hours', 'watch', 'best', 'version']",Masterpiece Theater: Anna Karenina VHS
574948,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B000059TPH,Carlisle Wheeling,"[1, 1]","Up to this point, I have never read Tolstoy's book, and the only versions of Anna Karenina I've seen are the one with Sophie Marceau and this version as presented by Masterpiece Theater.  While handsomely done, the under 2-hour version with Marceau was too short to tell an effective enough story of a huge book.  Some people here would rather see the 10-hour version, but that's a little too long for someone who can't even dedicate themselves to a marathon of TV series on DVD.  I sat through this entire movie yesterday, and was quite pleased.My simple take on this classic story is that Tolstoy was showing the comparison between the corrupt affair between Anna (Helen McCrory) and Vronskey (Kevin McKidd) and the faithful, strong love between Constantine (Douglas Henshall) and Kitty (sorry, didn't catch the actress's name).  The basic essence is that being devout and faithful is always a better alternative than the tragedy that befalls the former couple.  Everyone seems to interpret it in their own way, which is what a good story is all about.True, Karenin (Stephen Dillane) was cold and worried about appearances, but he was basically right in standing firm against his adulterous wife and her lover.  Vronskey should have known better than to chase a married woman with an 8 year-old child, so I immediately didn't care for him.  ""You don't love him,"" he exclaims to her when she first rebukes him.  So, what does that have to do with the price of eggs?  He's a homewrecker, and she's just as bad for finally giving in.  Their selfishness cost them both so much, and it simply wasn't worth it.  I actually felt sorry for Karenin, especially when she told him she hated him.  Who wants to hear that?  You may question his motives for not granting her a divorce, but I was on his side simply due to principal.  Besides, it was disgusting the way the two of them were romping all over and having a high old time until they lost their social standing.Some people have criticized Douglas Henshall's Scottish accent, but how many other classic productions contain actors who are nowhere near the nationality of the characters they play?  Valmont is full of English and American actors.  I could go on with its cousin Dangerous Liasons, Cousin Bette, Cherie, Amadeus, etc., but the point is moot.  He did a fine and sensitive job as the once wild but reformed Constantine, and his selfless, faithful devotion to Kitty was an enjoyable side to the story, as was Kitty's equal reciprocation.This movie was haunting and exceptionally well acted.  There was just one problem with it:  Anna Karenina was supposed to be beautiful.  No offense to Helen McCrory, but that woman isn't anything close to the description.  Her acting was superb, but she looks too old to play the character, and she reminds me a bit of what Dixie Carter would have looked like had she not gotten plastic surgery.  Also, toward the end of the story, I was admittedly getting sick of her husky voice shrieking away as she sank into paranoid dillusions about whether Vronskey loved her or not.  Like another reviewer here stated, I was starting to get itchy for that train scene.  Other than that, this was a splendid movie, and it haunted me after I finished watching it last night, it's still doing its job today, and that's a definite positive in a world of movies you forget not long after they're done running.  Let this version of Anna Karenina haunt you too, because it's more than worth the 4 hours of your time.",4,Haunting and Thought Provoking Story.,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,3495,"['Up', 'point', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Tolstoy', 'book', 'only', 'versions', 'Anna', 'Karenina', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'one', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'version', 'presented', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'handsomely', 'done', '2-hour', 'version', 'Marceau', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'tell', 'effective', 'enough', 'story', 'huge', 'book', 'people', 'here', 'would', 'rather', 'see', '10-hour', 'version', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'dedicate', 'marathon', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'sat', 'entire', 'movie', 'yesterday', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased.My', 'simple', 'take', 'classic', 'story', 'Tolstoy', 'was', 'showing', 'comparison', 'corrupt', 'affair', 'Anna', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'Vronskey', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'faithful', 'strong', 'love', 'Constantine', 'Douglas', 'Henshall', 'Kitty', 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'actress', 'name', 'basic', 'essence', 'being', 'devout', 'faithful', 'always', 'better', 'alternative', 'tragedy', 'former', 'couple', 'Everyone', 'interpret', 'own', 'way', 'what', 'good', 'story', 'about.True', 'Karenin', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'was', 'cold', 'worried', 'appearances', 'was', 'basically', 'right', 'standing', 'firm', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'lover', 'Vronskey', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'chase', 'married', 'woman', '8', 'year-old', 'child', 'immediately', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'when', 'first', 'So', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'price', 'eggs', 'homewrecker', 'just', 'bad', 'finally', 'giving', 'selfishness', 'cost', 'so', 'much', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'actually', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Karenin', 'especially', 'when', 'told', 'hated', 'Who', 'hear', 'may', 'question', 'motives', 'not', 'granting', 'divorce', 'was', 'side', 'simply', 'due', 'principal', 'was', 'disgusting', 'way', 'two', 'were', 'romping', 'having', 'high', 'old', 'time', 'lost', 'social', 'standing.Some', 'people', 'have', 'criticized', 'Douglas', 'Henshall', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'classic', 'productions', 'contain', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'nowhere', 'nationality', 'characters', 'play', 'Valmont', 'full', 'English', 'American', 'actors', 'could', 'go', 'cousin', 'Dangerous', 'Liasons', 'Cousin', 'Bette', 'Cherie', 'Amadeus', 'etc.', 'point', 'moot', 'did', 'fine', 'sensitive', 'job', 'once', 'wild', 'reformed', 'Constantine', 'selfless', 'faithful', 'devotion', 'Kitty', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'side', 'story', 'was', 'Kitty', 'equal', 'reciprocation.This', 'movie', 'was', 'haunting', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'acted', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'beautiful', 'offense', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'woman', ""n't"", 'anything', 'close', 'description', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'character', 'bit', 'what', 'Dixie', 'Carter', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'had', 'not', 'gotten', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Also', 'end', 'story', 'was', 'admittedly', 'getting', 'sick', 'husky', 'voice', 'shrieking', 'away', 'sank', 'paranoid', 'dillusions', 'Vronskey', 'loved', 'not', 'reviewer', 'here', 'stated', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'itchy', 'train', 'scene', 'Other', 'was', 'splendid', 'movie', 'haunted', 'finished', 'watching', 'last', 'night', 'still', 'doing', 'job', 'today', 'definite', 'positive', 'world', 'movies', 'forget', 'not', 'long', ""'re"", 'done', 'running', 'Let', 'version', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'haunt', 'too', 'more', '4', 'hours', 'time']",Masterpiece Theater: Anna Karenina VHS
574949,AB34G6VKP28L,B000059TPH,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[3, 3]","I had never read Tolstoy's novel on which this is based, nor knew much about the story prior to picking this up from the library one rainy afternoon. Much to my astonishment, I loved it. It is more than just a lavish costume drama (although the exquisite costumes and painstaking attention to detail will make any woman swoon with delight), it is also a passionate glimpse into love and lust, revenge and forgiveness, innocence and carnality.The first time through I was swept up in the primary story of the lovers. Anna's passionless marriage to Alexei leads her to fall hard and fast for the romantic, sweet-talking Count Vronsky. But on a second viewing (no less than two days later, I just could not stay away from it!) my attention was diverted by Levin's romance with Kitty. It is a film that is almost too much to take in all at once, because it is so deep and complex in its emotions. One thing I appreciated was that none of the characters are one-dimensional. Anna is deeply emotional and following her heart causes her to self-destruct. Alexei Karenin by contrast is restrained to the point of seeming cold, but it is evident from a perfectly nuanced performance that he ISN'T cold, and he DOES care, he just hides most of his emotions beneath the surface.Admittedly, I do not much care for the casting of the main lovers, but the rest of the extended cast are brilliant, particularly Stephen Dillane as Alexei. In the span of a handful of scenes, I came around to liking him much more than the ""passionate lover,"" Vronsky. One of the finest moments comes at Anna's sickbed, when husband and lover are both in attendance. The beautiful writing and tremendous performances -- calm detachment from Alexei, and passionate grief from Vronsky -- make it mesmerizing.I also appreciate that in spite of ""sexing up"" the adulterous aspect, the film refrains from being too explicit. What seems to be important here is motivations and emotions rather than purely physical connections, which makes it unlike many other stories in the genre. Minus a minor flub over the Russian Church performing a marriage ceremony in Latin, it is in all respects ""almost perfect.""How do I know?

574956,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B000059TPH,Howard M. Kindel,"[5, 5]","No matter how faithful a film is to the book it's based on, one crucial element will always go begging: the words with which it's written.  A great novel is as much a triumph of language as it is of plot, character, dialogue and setting; but while these elements lend themselves to visualization, the grace and elegance of the writing do not.  Remove the style and what remains would be like an opera without the music.  The essence of the novel gets lost in transition to any other medium.So in setting about to watch an adaptation of a great novel, one should first take up the book and, following Scottish philosopher David Hume's advice ""commit it to the flames.""  Otherwise it will haunt you throughout the entire film because you'll find yourself attempting the impossible task of comparing the two.If you then add in the Platonic view that a work of art is a copy of a copy, then a work in translation becomes a copy of a copy of a copy, and a film becomes - well, it's enough to make your head spin.  See why it's so much easier to just take the film on its own merits?  And this Masterpiece Theatre production of ""Anna Karenina"" has sufficient merits to be considered a great film.It captures the soul of a particular time and place with great economy and considerable subtlety, rendering the events surrounding Anna's love affair with Count Vronsky and the inevitable consequences of that affair plus parallel stories of other characters' romantic endeavors in just under four hours.  Its somber tone and undercurrent of impending doom follows Anna like a doppelganger from her very first appearance, even stalking her amidst the lively, sumptuous balls she attends, like a dark cloud hanging over her every activity.If acting is bringing a character to life, then Mary McCrory's performance as Anna Karenina is nothing less than superb.  It's clear from her very first appearance that Ms McCrory the actress is slightly older and slightly less beautiful than the character.  Yet when she comes alive at the Ball, in Count Vronsky's company, she transcends her own physical presence to become a stunningly beautiful woman.  This degree of acting goes well beyond walking, talking, emoting and being made-up for the role, to the level of actually being the character.  Mary McCroy's artistry makes it clear that Anna's eventual decline proceeds from something deep within her which her affair with Count Vronsky merely precipitates but doesn't create; her Anna Karenina is destined for destruction whether she ever meets Vronsky or not.Kevin McKidd may seem a bit wooden as Count Vronsky - but is that an acting flaw or a truer rendition of the character?  Given Vronsky's upbringing by the cold, calculating social climber Countess Vronskaya would he not have effected a cold, indifferent facade, that even in the throes of great emotion still manages to conceal his deeper self?  And though we're not given much detail of Konstantin Levin's upbringing, his fluid, open facade - especially as effected by Douglas Henshall - offers the perfect contrast to Vronsky's exterior, just as his sense of life perfectly contrasts Vronsky's.  But it's Stephen Dillane's rendition of Prince Alexei Karenin, Anna's husband, that gives the finishing touch to everything that happens.  He's neither uncaring nor unfeeling, though he's made to become indifferent to his wife's plight through the machinations of the truly sinister Countess Lidia Ivanova, who manages to drive a wedge between not only husband and wife but mother and son as well.It's important to bear in mind not merely the period Tolstoy was writing about but the period in which he was writing.  There are pronounced themes throughout European literature of the late Victorian era - such as the troubling search for honesty as a counterweight to the deep hypocrisy of the period - which infuse the works of Chekhov, Ibsen, Hardy, Flaubert and others as well as the works of Tolstoy.  Which begs the question: would a real Anna Karenina of the period Tolstoy was writing about have endured the same fate as his heroine by discarding all the hypocritical trappings which a more worldly woman, such as Princess Betsy, surrounded herself with - or was this trait Tolstoy gave Anna a product of his thinking at the time he wrote the book and totally alien to an actual woman of that earlier period?  Not that it makes any difference as far as the film goes; but it does give pause for thought about the central character of the book upon which the film is based.",5,Mr. Hume Saw It Coming,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,4521,"['matter', 'how', 'film', 'book', 'based', 'one', 'crucial', 'element', 'will', 'always', 'go', 'begging', 'words', 'written', 'great', 'novel', 'as', 'much', 'triumph', 'language', 'plot', 'character', 'dialogue', 'setting', 'elements', 'lend', 'visualization', 'grace', 'elegance', 'writing', 'do', 'not', 'Remove', 'style', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'opera', 'music', 'essence', 'novel', 'lost', 'transition', 'other', 'medium.So', 'setting', 'watch', 'adaptation', 'great', 'novel', 'one', 'should', 'first', 'take', 'up', 'book', 'following', 'Scottish', 'philosopher', 'David', 'Hume', 'advice', 'commit', 'flames', 'will', 'haunt', 'entire', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', 'attempting', 'impossible', 'task', 'comparing', 'two.If', 'then', 'add', 'Platonic', 'view', 'work', 'art', 'copy', 'copy', 'then', 'work', 'translation', 'copy', 'copy', 'copy', 'film', 'well', 'enough', 'make', 'head', 'spin', 'See', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'just', 'take', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'production', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'sufficient', 'merits', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'film.It', 'soul', 'particular', 'time', 'place', 'great', 'economy', 'considerable', 'subtlety', 'rendering', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Anna', 'love', 'affair', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'inevitable', 'consequences', 'affair', 'parallel', 'stories', 'other', 'characters', 'romantic', 'endeavors', 'just', 'four', 'hours', 'somber', 'tone', 'undercurrent', 'impending', 'doom', 'Anna', 'doppelganger', 'very', 'first', 'appearance', 'even', 'stalking', 'lively', 'sumptuous', 'balls', 'dark', 'cloud', 'hanging', 'activity.If', 'acting', 'bringing', 'character', 'life', 'then', 'Mary', 'McCrory', 'performance', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'nothing', 'less', 'superb', 'clear', 'very', 'first', 'appearance', 'Ms', 'McCrory', 'actress', 'slightly', 'older', 'slightly', 'less', 'beautiful', 'character', 'when', 'alive', 'Ball', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'company', 'own', 'physical', 'presence', 'become', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'degree', 'acting', 'well', 'walking', 'talking', 'emoting', 'being', 'made-up', 'role', 'level', 'actually', 'being', 'character', 'Mary', 'McCroy', 'artistry', 'clear', 'Anna', 'eventual', 'decline', 'proceeds', 'something', 'deep', 'affair', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'merely', ""n't"", 'create', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'destined', 'destruction', 'ever', 'Vronsky', 'not.Kevin', 'McKidd', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'wooden', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'acting', 'flaw', 'truer', 'rendition', 'character', 'Given', 'Vronsky', 'upbringing', 'cold', 'calculating', 'social', 'climber', 'Countess', 'Vronskaya', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'effected', 'cold', 'indifferent', 'facade', 'even', 'throes', 'great', 'emotion', 'still', 'conceal', 'deeper', 'self', ""'re"", 'not', 'given', 'much', 'detail', 'Konstantin', 'Levin', 'upbringing', 'fluid', 'open', 'facade', 'especially', 'effected', 'Douglas', 'Henshall', 'perfect', 'contrast', 'Vronsky', 'exterior', 'just', 'sense', 'life', 'perfectly', 'Vronsky', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'rendition', 'Prince', 'Alexei', 'Karenin', 'Anna', 'husband', 'finishing', 'touch', 'everything', 'uncaring', 'unfeeling', 'made', 'become', 'indifferent', 'wife', 'plight', 'machinations', 'truly', 'sinister', 'Countess', 'Lidia', 'Ivanova', 'who', 'drive', 'wedge', 'not', 'only', 'husband', 'wife', 'mother', 'son', 'well.It', 'important', 'bear', 'mind', 'not', 'merely', 'period', 'Tolstoy', 'was', 'writing', 'about', 'period', 'was', 'writing', 'are', 'pronounced', 'themes', 'European', 'literature', 'late', 'Victorian', 'era', 'such', 'troubling', 'search', 'honesty', 'counterweight', 'deep', 'hypocrisy', 'period', 'infuse', 'works', 'Chekhov', 'Ibsen', 'Hardy', 'Flaubert', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'works', 'Tolstoy', 'Which', 'question', 'would', 'real', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'period', 'Tolstoy', 'was', 'writing', 'about', 'have', 'endured', 'same', 'fate', 'heroine', 'discarding', 'hypocritical', 'trappings', 'more', 'worldly', 'woman', 'such', 'Princess', 'Betsy', 'surrounded', 'was', 'trait', 'Tolstoy', 'gave', 'Anna', 'product', 'thinking', 'time', 'wrote', 'book', 'totally', 'alien', 'actual', 'woman', 'earlier', 'period', 'Not', 'difference', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'give', 'pause', 'thought', 'central', 'character', 'book', 'film', 'based']",Masterpiece Theater: Anna Karenina VHS

I very much agree with the positive reviews of this film.It is a difficult task to present Tolstoy's epic work in a few hours.  The characters are three-dimensional and brought to life from the book into this film.  The characters are believable.  They are not stereotypes of Tolstoy's characters.  They are the same characters you would bring to life in your imagination from reading the book.Helen McCrory does an exceptional job of performing a difficult character.  She portrays a woman of strength and passion.  She is very seductive, yet portrays a woman who is the pinnacle of nineteenth century morals and character.  Until she meets Count Vronsky.Vronsky is well-portrayed by Kevin McKidd (Rome: The Complete Series).  McKidd is a Shakespearean actor who has a presence, on the screen, for portraying military figures.  He is very convincing in this role as an ambitious young cavalry officer in pursuit of Anna.One of the most delightful vignettes in this version is the portrayal of Konstantin and Kitty.  The screenwriter, the director, and the actor did an superb job of brining Konstantin to life.  He is a landed aristocrat, yet, the kind of guy who would have a beer with you, and, let's his dog sleep on the bed.  Kitty is portrayed by the emminently lovely and graceful Paloma Baeza.Far From the Madding Crowd [VHS];The Way We Live Now).  She is sweet and you can't help but smile when she finally agrees to marry Konstantin.  Their bethrothal is one of the most romantic and tender moments I have seen in film.This may not be a definitive film of Tolstoy's great work.

I only rated it a 4 star as I felt that Helen McCrory for me is not quite ""Anna"" and did not exacly capture the essence of her as portrayed in Tolstoy's book. Whilst the book is huge and takes a lot of reading, it remains one of my all time favourite classic novels with Anna as my tragic heroine, therefore I could be biased.  The DVD is of excellent quality with good image and sound and the cinematography is excellent capturing both the opulence of Tsarist Russia and the bucolic peacefulness of the countryside.  Vronsky was appropriately as dashing, handsome, irresistable and passionate as Karenin was cold, haughty, humourless and unforgiving.  Performances overall were excellent with the supporting cast capturing the times, the mores of the day, the gossip of society and the eventual freezing out of Anna whilst forgiving Vrosnky's determined pursuit and Karenin's vindictiveness resulting in this woman to seek her ultimate and final end. It is as good a version as I have ever seen, even though for me Vivian Leigh is still the most beautiful ""Anna"" on film.

It is faithful to Tolstoy's novel, yet updates the dialog in its effort to be more realistic.  Melodrama is exchanged for raw emotion in its place.  The run time is lengthy enough to do justice, yet more digestible than the BBC version.  All the important pivot points, themes and foreshadowing are here as well as the emphasis on social, gender and class issues.  More natural moments of passion and humor are injected to ensure the piece has life and support the realistic bent.This version is exceptional and realistic, but here are some reasons it is not complete for me:  The actors for the central pair Anna and Vronsky are less compelling than some films.  Vronsky is more manly here than any version I have seen, but less aristocratic or dashing.  Anna is terrific, but her charm and appearance do not inspire for me the devotion and sacrifice required.  In real life attraction is a tricky thing so I would still say this is realistic.  The production as a whole has a less epic feel by design.  Despite its virtues, it is not my favorite.BRIEF COMPARISONS TO OTHER EDITIONS with links to the product  (this list is not comprehensive and I apologize if a favored version is not represented.  I already watched nearly 24 hrs of video not counting research and writing!)  This list is not in order of precedence and each version has merits.  You can see slightly more detailed versions of my reviews like the paragraph above by going to each product page.1977 BBC Mini SeriesAnna Kareninawith Nicola PagettThe Gold Standard of adaptations even after so many years.  Despite the 70's BBC acting style, this version has aged well with tremendous faithfulness to the book and ideas behind it.  Performances are melodramatic to today's audience, but so good they are relevant.  It is still my favorite rendition.  You must be up for nearly 10 hrs worth of story though.1948Anna Kareninawith Vivien Leigh and Keiron MooreClassic black and white is a different style and shouldn't be compared too critically with modern adaptations.  It has the charm of a golden age of cinema.  Leigh is perhaps still the most elegant Anna and Kieron Moore the most dashing Vronsky after all this time.1997 Bernard Rose versionLeo Tolstoy's Anna Kareninawith Sophie Marceau and Sean BeanMost visually stunning of the traditional adaptations, gorgeous cinematography and recognizable stars galore.  Despite all the stars, acting is uneven and accents all over the place.  Choppy story flow.  Still one of my favorites!1985 TV MovieAnna Kareninawith Jacqueline Bisset and Christopher ReeveShortened or edited version is somewhat lifeless though the flow is less choppy than other adaptations.  Badly in need of a restoration in video/sound quality and return of the lost footage not found in any copies I know of.2012 Art film by Joe WrightAnna Kareninawith Kiera KnightlyThis is not for Tolstoy traditionalists!

574963,AITI12BBKCYG9,B000059TPH,"N. Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[15, 17]","Helen McCrory literally embodied the role of the ill-fated Anna Karenina in this production.  Her journey from the pinnacle of High Russian society to the depths of despair as an outcast was captured by Ms. McCrory exceptionally well.Stephen Dillane and Kevin McKidd also expertly deliver, playing Alexei Karenin and Alexei, the Count Vronsky, respectively.  Dillane's portrayal of the icy, unfeeling Karenin was superb; even more so was McKidd's steamy, passionate reading of the enamoured Vronsky.I was also well pleased with the performances of dear old, always-in-period-pieces Amanda Root, and familiar faces with Paul Rhys and Paloma Baeza, all delivering excellent performances.However, the role of Levin (Kitty's eventual husband), played by Douglas Henshall, worked my last Tolstoy-loving nerve.  Actually, I was relatively unimpressed with the fact that the entire cast, while portraying Russian nobility and speaking about journeying to St. Petersburg and Moscow, spoke with upper-crust British accents.  I believe well-developed Russian, or at least SOME version of Eastern-European, accents for the cast would have heightened the atmosphere of the Russian background in which the story is set.  Mr. Henshall's ridiculously thick Scottish brogue -- dripping  moss-covered syllables as he mumbles on about rubles and vodka and the czar (?!?!) -- simply defied both logic and validity.I think his role could have been much better cast.Overwhelmingly, however, ""Anna"" remained very true to the novel, and I think, despite his undoubted confusion over the accents of the actors, Mr. Tolstoy himself would consider this adaptation a credit to the world were he able to view it for himself.",4,Rapturous Anna,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,1696,"['Helen', 'McCrory', 'literally', 'embodied', 'role', 'ill-fated', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'production', 'journey', 'pinnacle', 'High', 'Russian', 'society', 'depths', 'despair', 'outcast', 'was', 'captured', 'Ms.', 'McCrory', 'exceptionally', 'well.Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'also', 'expertly', 'deliver', 'playing', 'Alexei', 'Karenin', 'Alexei', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'respectively', 'Dillane', 'portrayal', 'icy', 'unfeeling', 'Karenin', 'was', 'superb', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'McKidd', 'steamy', 'passionate', 'reading', 'enamoured', 'Vronsky.I', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'pleased', 'performances', 'dear', 'old', 'always-in-period-pieces', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'familiar', 'Paul', 'Rhys', 'Paloma', 'Baeza', 'delivering', 'excellent', 'performances.However', 'role', 'Levin', 'Kitty', 'eventual', 'husband', 'played', 'Douglas', 'Henshall', 'worked', 'last', 'Tolstoy-loving', 'nerve', 'Actually', 'was', 'relatively', 'unimpressed', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'portraying', 'Russian', 'nobility', 'speaking', 'about', 'journeying', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Moscow', 'spoke', 'upper-crust', 'British', 'accents', 'believe', 'well-developed', 'Russian', 'least', 'SOME', 'version', 'Eastern-European', 'accents', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'heightened', 'atmosphere', 'Russian', 'background', 'story', 'set', 'Mr.', 'Henshall', 'ridiculously', 'thick', 'Scottish', 'brogue', 'dripping', 'moss-covered', 'syllables', 'rubles', 'vodka', 'czar', 'simply', 'defied', 'logic', 'validity.I', 'think', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'cast.Overwhelmingly', 'however', 'Anna', 'remained', 'very', 'true', 'novel', 'think', 'undoubted', 'confusion', 'accents', 'actors', 'Mr.', 'Tolstoy', 'would', 'consider', 'adaptation', 'credit', 'world', 'were', 'able', 'view']",Masterpiece Theater: Anna Karenina VHS
574964,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B000059TPH,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[2, 4]","I'll say up front that if you want to see a fine production of Anna Karenina, then acquire the following older BBC mini-series version:Anna Karenina (1977) - The Complete MiniseriesAs for the mini-series film under review here, there appears to be a notable dose of modernistic thinking injected into the magnificent original story and it's almost as if the producers said to the director and cast, ""Tell the story but no Tolstoy please!"" In other words, focus on the sexual innuendos and keep the pacing wholly consistent throughout. As I watched I actually pondered whether the director had actually read the book which is not so much a story of love as it is a saga of life. The historical Russian context and the appurtenant detritus of the various scenes and sets have been largely obliterated.When one sits through a spot-on film production of Anna Karenina [there are multiple versions], the typical viewer is emotionally inspired to alternate between hugging and strangling Anna -- in this instance only the latter comes to mind. Our traditional paradigms of most of the characters have been un-artfully manipulated. While the screenwriters knew better than to actually tamper with Tolstoy's core story they still rejected the essential spirit of his magnificent novel. Had they somehow *improved* it, one could say okay -- but they didn't fulfill this near-impossible task in any sense.The central tale involves Anna Karenina [the Russian female extrapolation of the surname *Karenin*], the high-profile wife of a significantly-ranked St. Petersburg government official [Karenin], and their young son. Anna travels by train south to Moscow to pay a casual visit to her brother, Steva, who has (unknown to Anna at the time) just been caught in a lustful affair with the family governess and whose much angered wife is now ready to leave him. Anna manages to quickly smooth it all over subsequent to her arrival in Moscow but it's there that she encounters, and is quite taken with, a dashing young military officer, Vronsky, the latter being practically affianced to Steva's young and naive sister-in-law. The sister-in-law gets dumped (she's devastated) and Anna cannot bring herself to send the handsome and amorous Vronsky on his way -- quite the opposite. Karenin is soon apprised of the disgraceful relationship between his wife and Vronsky and the affair soon blossoms into the most talked-about scandal in St. Petersburg.There are a couple of sub-plots as well (although not nearly as many as there are in the original novel.) Steva continues to stumble along as the amiable man-about-town and his good friend from country, Levin, falls in love with the (soon to be rejected) sister-in-law but his offer is inopportunely declined when he proposes to her. Of course, once she is rejected by Vronsky and publicly humiliated by Anna's ostentatious behavior with her newfound paramour at a dance-soiree, Levin doesn't look so bad to her in retrospect... but that opportunity appears to be lost for good. Levin also has a tubercular, drunken brother whose political views and failing health become quite a personal burden for him.I've revealed no spoilers here - all this melodrama simply establishes the lengthy and intricate story which follows. But a central focus of the original story, and a very integral one, has been totally cast aside: the fact that Anna is a morphine addict which is much of what drives her often irrational behavior. I suppose that the film-makers opted, with an eye to appearing somewhat more trendy, to allow viewers to believe that she is simply bi-polar.The cinematography of this film is pretty much first class -- it's all film and not videotape, which is the singular shortcoming of the other mini-series I previously mentioned. However, the filmscore of original music is, in the context of this yarn, horrific. There's nothing Russian about it and this soundtrack could have been more logically applied to any episode ofThe Sopranos: The Complete First Season.The casting was largely very off-center, the character of Steva being the single major exception. This brings me to the strangest facet of the film: I anticipated that, this being a *Masterpiece Theater* entry, all the characters would have British accents instead of Russian ones and I'm wholly okay with that caveat; however, these actors spoke with multiple, mixed accents - British, Irish, and American! I've never encountered that strange nuance before in a period story which is supposed to take place entirely in a specific country. And with the exception of Steva, these folks didn't come off as Russian in any other sense, accents aside.Kevin McKidd [Vronsky] isn't nearly as smooth or as flamboyant as he should be and he presents the appearance of the stereotyped Irishman. The actor playing Levin comes off as Irish as well but in his case, appropriate make-up could have easily overcome this incongruity. Levin, a man of agriculture, had all exceptionally well-groomed, impeccably sanitary-looking serfs and muzhiks, all beautiful people. As an aside, Levin's agricultural aspect was played down entirely which was an incredibly important aspect of period Russian culture (and of the original story too.)Stephen Dillane's character [Karenin] was far too amiable, not nearly as Dickensian as he should have been presented -- he was also cast entirely too young as *old* Karenin was supposed to have a young wife [Anna], thereby contrasting their age differences. We're supposed to generally despise Karenin [except at one particular point in the story] but at times he even appears to suggest a warm and sympathetic personality, a fact which substantially diminishes the overall drama. Helen McCrory [Anna] represented the pinnacle of casting missteps. She's simply not as remarkably stunning as Anna has to be in order to drive the story effectively. Attractive yes, but she's nothing exceptional here and this is a genuine shame because a shrewd make-up session could have entirely gratified the essential expectations of Tolstoy fans.I can hardly blame the cast for the bulk of these bungles as the problems chiefly center upon feeble casting and failed script-writing. The unremarkable sets and locations simply add to the burden of both the actors and the cinematographer(s).And I suppose that the culmination of these multiple issues is what will separate the various evaluators of this contemporary two-part mini-series. The numerous Tolstoy fans will generally be let down while most others, especially those who have yet to experience the great joy of reading the original work, will likely say it's an okay film -- and it *is* an okay film in a generic, unspectacular sort of way. If you prefer to experience the Hollywood-type commercialized touch in film-making, punctuated with an emphasis on fairly mild carnal interludes, then you might well enjoy this movie quite a lot. I just thought that the producers, screenwriters, and the director failed utterly to make hay with all the more latent opportunities with which Tolstoy had armed them.Don't get me wrong about this mini-series. I wholly understand and agree with the concept that one cannot make a film straight from a novel -- it simply doesn't work. But if you wish to see a poster example of a sterling screenplay extracted from a renowned classic Russian novel then watchDoctor Zhivago (45th Anniversary Edition)and you'll see how a screenwriter, a composer, a director, and his slate of actors can collaborate effectively to generate a masterpiece. For me, this version of *Anna Karenina* was clearly worth watching on a one-time basis but, even though I now own the DVD, I do not anticipate giving it a second viewing anytime soon.",3,"Disappointing Pop Culture version, not much Tolstoy here (details)",1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,7725,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'up', 'front', 'want', 'see', 'fine', 'production', 'Anna',

574965,ANJU1CVG15TO7,B000059TPH,"Victor J. Banis ""Victor J. Banis""","[0, 0]","Notwithstanding its soap opera heart, Anna Karenina is one of the great books, a literary masterpiece. And great actresses - especially great screen actresses, have always wanted to play the title role. Alas, the novel&#8217;s length and the subtleties of Tolstoy writing make it difficult to do well within the time frame of a theatrical movie &#8211; usually no more than a couple of hours -  with the result that one gets no more than a skeleton plot, and a superficial glimpse of a woman who is fascinating and complex in the novel, and comes across shallow and selfish in the movies. Actresses as great as Greta Garbo and Vivian Leigh have seen their films founder on these implacable rocks.No one would accuse Helen Mccrory &#8211; star of this Masterpiece Classic production &#8211; of being in a league with the afore-named screen actresses, but she is by any reckoning a better-than-competent actress and both she and director David Blair benefit from the greater running time- nearly 4 hours -  this production affords them. Physically, McCrory is right for the part &#8211; Anna is a woman who must seem beautiful &#8211; after all, Vronsky falls in love with her very nearly at first sight &#8211; but it is more important that her looks be arresting rather than conventionally beautiful &#8211; again, Garbo, with that wonderfully sculpted face, but who was far from conventionally pretty &#8211; springs to mind. Anna is a woman altogether too full of life, living in a society rigidly bound by convention &#8211; it&#8217;s entirely likely that if Vronsky hadn&#8217;t come into her life when he did, someone else would have brought about the tragedy that eventually befalls her. McCrory captures this aspect of Anna&#8217;s personality quite convincingly.In typical Masterpiece fashion, this is a lush production - sets and costumes are splendid, and director Blair manages to capture the look and feel of czarist Russia. The acting is fine across the board, with Kevin McKidd a stunningly handsome and entirely convincing Count Vronsky.In the end, this production falls short of Tolstoy&#8217;s brilliant look at love versus passion &#8211; a perhaps inevitable fate for any filmed attempt &#8211; but it is a noble effort, and well worth the watching.",4,excellent adaptaton,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,2269,"['Notwithstanding', 'soap', 'opera', 'heart', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'one', 'great', 'books', 'literary', 'masterpiece', 'great', 'actresses', 'especially', 'great', 'screen', 'actresses', 'have', 'always', 'wanted', 'play', 'title', 'role', 'Alas', 'novel', '8217', 'length', 'subtleties', 'Tolstoy', 'writing', 'make', 'difficult', 'do', 'well', 'time', 'frame', 'theatrical', 'movie', '8211', 'usually', 'more', 'couple', 'hours', 'result', 'one', 'more', 'skeleton', 'plot', 'superficial', 'glimpse', 'woman', 'who', 'fascinating', 'complex', 'novel', 'shallow', 'selfish', 'movies', 'Actresses', 'as', 'great', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'founder', 'implacable', 'rocks.No', 'one', 'would', 'accuse', 'Helen', 'Mccrory', '8211', 'star', 'Masterpiece', 'Classic', 'production', '8211', 'being', 'league', 'afore-named', 'screen', 'actresses', 'reckoning', 'better-than-competent', 'actress', 'director', 'David', 'Blair', 'benefit', 'greater', 'running', 'time-', 'nearly', '4', 'hours', 'production', 'Physically', 'McCrory', 'right', 'part', '8211', 'Anna', 'woman', 'who', 'must', 'seem', 'beautiful', '8211', 'Vronsky', 'love', 'very', 'nearly', 'first', 'sight', '8211', 'more', 'important', 'looks', 'be', 'arresting', 'rather', 'conventionally', 'beautiful', '8211', 'again', 'Garbo', 'wonderfully', 'sculpted', 'face', 'who', 'was', 'far', 'conventionally', 'pretty', '8211', 'springs', 'mind', 'Anna', 'woman', 'altogether', 'too', 'full', 'life', 'living', 'society', 'rigidly', 'bound', 'convention', '8211', '8217', 'entirely', 'likely', 'Vronsky', 'hadn', '8217', 'come', 'life', 'when', 'did', 'someone', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'tragedy', 'eventually', 'McCrory', 'captures', 'aspect', 'Anna', '8217', 'personality', 'quite', 'convincingly.In', 'typical', 'Masterpiece', 'fashion', 'lush', 'production', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'splendid', 'director', 'Blair', 'capture', 'look', 'feel', 'czarist', 'Russia', 'acting', 'fine', 'board', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'stunningly', 'handsome', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'Count', 'Vronsky.In', 'end', 'production', 'short', 'Tolstoy', '8217', 'brilliant', 'look', 'love', 'versus', 'passion', '8211', 'perhaps', 'inevitable', 'fate', 'filmed', 'attempt', '8211', 'noble', 'effort', 'well', 'watching']",Masterpiece Theater: Anna Karenina VHS

While Helen McRory may not be as conventionally pretty as many other actresses who played Anna, her acting is spot on, and she's closer to the character as envisioned and described by Tolstoy. The other characters are cast very well, and few liberties are taken with the plot. Aside from the now-dated 1977 BBC miniseries, this is the version which spends the most time on the Levin-Kitty storyline, as it should be. The main reason I deduct a star is that it some of it inevitably felt like a breeze-through the book's themes - as no adaptation can truly capture the depth of the original novel.",4,Best adaptation yet,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,863,"['Anna', 'Karenina', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'book', 'having', 'watched', 'number', 'Russian', 'English-language', 'adaptations', 'including', '2012', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'film', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'consider', '2000', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'version', 'most', 'faithful', 'watchable', 'Helen', 'McRory', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'conventionally', 'pretty', 'many', 'other', 'actresses', 'who', 'played', 'Anna', 'acting', 'spot', 'closer', 'character', 'envisioned', 'described', 'Tolstoy', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'few', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'plot', 'Aside', 'now-dated', '1977', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'version', 'most', 'time', 'Levin-Kitty', 'storyline', 'should', 'be', 'main', 'reason', 'deduct', 'star', 'inevitably', 'felt', 'breeze-through', 'book', 'themes', 'adaptation', 'can', 'truly', 'capture', 'depth', 'original', 'novel']",Masterpiece Theater: Anna Karenina VHS

The story centers around Anna and her shameful affair with Count Vronsky. This miniseries actually tells the full novel in depth, other than the 1997 theatricle release starring Sean Bean.
