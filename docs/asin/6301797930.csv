He shares no sceanes with Clift and Martin till the very last minute but, you have to remember that this story was taken from a novel by Irwin Shaw an author much in the same vein as Jackie Collins and other romanticist types. So views very much like reading a novel but just condensed down to movie format.I liked ""The Young Lions"" but I feel it could have been a tad better.",4,Young Lions,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,505,"['Very', 'interesting', 'teaming', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'fact', 'marlon', 'Brando', 'almost', 'second', 'thought', 'shares', 'sceanes', 'Clift', 'Martin', 'till', 'very', 'last', 'minute', 'have', 'remember', 'story', 'was', 'taken', 'novel', 'Irwin', 'Shaw', 'author', 'much', 'same', 'vein', 'Jackie', 'Collins', 'other', 'romanticist', 'types', 'So', 'views', 'very', 'much', 'reading', 'novel', 'just', 'condensed', 'down', 'movie', 'format.I', 'liked', 'Young', 'Lions', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tad', 'better']",N/A
266615,A2SHF3F8N7HGS3,6301797930,"Allen Eaton ""aleaton3""","[37, 44]","The film is very enjoyable.  The music score is one of the best dramatic pieces ever composed for a war film.  My article focuses on the real events of the transition from novel to screenplay.  Marlon Brando was active in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950's.  With THE YOUNG LIONS, he wanted to pursue a ""can't we just get along?"" approach to a different issue: American/German relations in the wake of WWII.  To this end, he changed the character of Christian Diestel from Irwin Shaw's original portrait of a sadistic, sex-crazed thug into an idealistic Tutonic knight, whose purity of action is destroyed by the reality of the Nazi system.  Brando was actually apologizing for the average German's participation in Hitler's war.  Brando's vision is epic, attempting to rise above petty squabbles.  He was trying to see the ""larger historical impact"" of war in general, and how idealism can be led so tragically astray.  Brando met Shaw in France during location shooting and was surprised to find out that Shaw didn't even know his novel was being filmed.  Shaw hated the Germans and wanted to keep them down with stern military occupation.  Brando disagreed and wanted to debate the topic on television, but this never came about.  Shaw's Christian Diestel isn't even an officer, just a sargeant.  He possesses  no lofty idealism.  He probably wouldn't know what the word meant.  When we first meet him, before the war, he is arranging for a local man to peep in on Margaret Freemandle, an American tourist, as she changes her clothes in her Alpine hotel room.  Hardly the charming ski instructor that Brando represents.  The ending of the novel was so drastically changed on screen as to be unrecognizable.  In the film, Brando's character is finally demoralized, his ideals shattered.  He decides to turn himself in to the Americans and face his own, and his country's, crimes (he has just come from a Nazi concentration camp on the verge of being captured by American troops).  He breaks his machine gun on a tree and stoically marches down the hill.  He is spoted by Michael (Martin) who shoots him.  Brando falls down the hill and eventually falls into a pond and drowns.  Noah (Clift) is unharmed and returns to wife and child as the film ends.  In the novel, Christian is hiding in a foxhole as Michael and Noah wander through the forest.  Christian shoots and kills Noah.  He would do the same to Michael, except that his machine gun jams.  Michael walks up to him and puts his rifle to Christian's head.  All Christian can do is grin and say, ""Welcome to Germany.""  Michael kills him.  Which version is better?  Shaw's novel is a personal memoir.  The Germans were the bad guys - totally evil and without redemption.  The film is Brando's vision of tolerance for all races and creeds.  Brando was a major star in 1958 and his vision dominated.  Take the film story as is or leave it.  The DVD is a good, widescreen presentation of the movie.  Yes, a commentary track is definately in order.",3,book to screen adaptation,1071878400,"12 20, 2003",2003,3006,"['film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'music', 'score', 'one', 'best', 'dramatic', 'pieces', 'ever', 'composed', 'war', 'film', 'article', 'real', 'events', 'transition', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'was', 'active', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', '1950', 'THE', 'YOUNG', 'LIONS', 'wanted', 'pursue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'along', 'approach', 'different', 'issue', 'American/German', 'relations', 'wake', 'WWII', 'end', 'changed', 'character', 'Christian', 'Diestel', 'Irwin', 'Shaw', 'original', 'portrait', 'sadistic', 'sex-crazed', 'thug', 'idealistic', 'Tutonic', 'knight', 'purity', 'action', 'destroyed', 'reality', 'Nazi', 'system', 'Brando', 'was', 'actually', 'apologizing', 'average', 'German', 'participation', 'Hitler', 'war', 'Brando', 'vision', 'epic', 'attempting', 'rise', 'petty', 'squabbles', 'was', 'trying', 'see', 'larger', 'historical', 'impact', 'war', 'general', 'how', 'idealism', 'can', 'be', 'led', 'so', 'tragically', 'astray', 'Brando', 'met', 'Shaw', 'France', 'location', 'shooting', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'Shaw', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'novel', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'Shaw', 'hated', 'Germans', 'wanted', 'keep', 'down', 'stern', 'military', 'occupation', 'Brando', 'disagreed', 'wanted', 'debate', 'topic', 'television', 'never', 'came', 'about', 'Shaw', 'Christian', 'Diestel', ""n't"", 'even', 'officer', 'just', 'sargeant', 'lofty', 'idealism', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'word', 'meant', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'war', 'arranging', 'local', 'man', 'peep', 'Margaret', 'Freemandle', 'American', 'tourist', 'clothes', 'Alpine', 'hotel', 'room', 'Hardly', 'charming', 'ski', 'instructor', 'Brando', 'ending', 'novel', 'was', 'so', 'drastically', 'changed', 'screen', 'be', 'unrecognizable', 'film', 'Brando', 'character', 'finally', 'demoralized', 'ideals', 'shattered', 'turn', 'Americans', 'face', 'own', 'country', 'crimes', 'just', 'come', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'verge', 'being', 'captured', 'American', 'troops', 'machine', 'gun', 'tree', 'stoically', 'marches', 'down', 'hill', 'spoted', 'Michael', 'Martin', 'who', 'shoots', 'Brando', 'down', 'hill', 'eventually', 'pond', 'drowns', 'Noah', 'Clift', 'unharmed', 'returns', 'wife', 'child', 'film', 'novel', 'Christian', 'hiding', 'foxhole', 'Michael', 'Noah', 'wander', 'forest', 'Christian', 'shoots', 'kills', 'Noah', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'Michael', 'machine', 'gun', 'jams', 'Michael', 'walks', 'up', 'rifle', 'Christian', 'head', 'Christian', 'can', 'do', 'grin', 'say', 'Welcome', 'Germany', 'Michael', 'Which', 'version', 'better', 'Shaw', 'novel', 'personal', 'memoir', 'Germans', 'were', 'bad', 'guys', 'totally', 'evil', 'redemption', 'film', 'Brando', 'vision', 'tolerance', 'races', 'creeds', 'Brando', 'was', 'major', 'star', '1958', 'vision', 'dominated', 'Take', 'film', 'story', 'leave', 'DVD', 'good', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'movie', 'Yes', 'commentary', 'track', 'definately', 'order']",N/A

Ultimately, we sit through an overlong story to reach an all-too-obvious denouement. You just know the three main characters will eventually cross paths and that when they do someone will die. So who will it be? Consider the choices:1.) An undersized but tough Jewish-American soldier who must fight discrimination even within his own platoon.2.) His friend, a Broadway singer, wiseguy, slacker and physical coward.3.) The German lieutenant who loyally serves the Fatherland, but isn't too sure why.Brando's mediocre Dutch Uncle accent is reason enough to paint a big bullseye on his chest.This one's definitely popular, so maybe it's just my peculiar tastes. I'll indulge in a t&egrave;arjerker now and then and always enjoy a good war movie, but for me, never the twain shall meet. I especially don't like being bored, marking time till THE END appears.

It's certainly the most purely dramatic storyline, and the most complete.

Wong,"[0, 0]","I saw this film many times, once in the theater, then on TV and then on video--and this episodic, long film still holds up for 2 reasons: Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. It was also the breakthrough that singer Dean Martin needed to break away from his Martin/Lewis association where he was constantly belittled by the critics for having little talent outside of being ""handsome"" or straight man for Lewis. In fact he took the role for practically nothing just to work alongside these 2 giants of Method acting.  Brando of course dominates with his role of the disillusioned German soldier who slowly realizes that the war is a futile gesture.  Quite bit difference from the callous, sadistic soldier Shaw painted in his novel--but definitely an improvement. And Cliff is no less heartbreaking as Noah Ackerman who's forced to face bigotry from his fellow soldiers but finds friendship with Michael Whitacre (Martin) a song and dance man who's forced to face his own cowardice by his relationship with a WAC (Barbara Rush).

This is by no measure a ""classic"" war film, because that label would rank it up there with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""Tora-Tora-Tora,"" and many others through which the ""classic"" standard was developed.Given, this COULD have been, and perhaps should have been a great film, but it is full of flaws, and unfortunately three of them are the acting of three pretty fair actors.  The adaptation from the book was basically ineffective, and thus rendered the movie an almost painfully plodding experience.  It is far too long, and opportunities to deliver a powerful message on war itself were lost.  Frankly, the obvious efforts to render this an idealistic classic failed.In terms of the acting, none of the three central characters were presented effectively, and perhaps not even believably.  Part of the problem was that Brando, Clift, and Martin were not challenged, and at times actually seemed to be disinterested in anything but reading their lines.  Because of his inexperience, Dean Martin can be forgiven, but Clift and Brando were extremely weak in their portrayals of the characters, and again, appreared to be merely going through their lines.The best part of the entire film was the musical score, which was exceptional.  Naturally, if the ""...best part of the film..."" was the music, the prosecution rests when it comes to further elaboration on the qualities - or the lack thereof - of the film.  On a purely personal note, I had some trouble with what I perceived as an attempt to portray Brando's German officer character as an even ""cuddly Nazi,"" and the director took the attempted idealism a bit too far.",2,"By no measure a ""classic"" war film",1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,1751,"['Having', 'very', 'large', 'collection', 'war', 'films', 'lot', 'shelf', 'compare', 'contrast', 'one', 'measure', 'classic', 'war', 'film', 'label', 'would', 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Longest', 'Day', 'Tora-Tora-Tora', 'many', 'others', 'classic', 'standard', 'was', 'developed.Given', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'full', 'flaws', 'unfortunately', 'three', 'are', 'acting', 'three', 'pretty', 'fair', 'actors', 'adaptation', 'book', 'was', 'basically', 'ineffective', 'thus', 'rendered', 'movie', 'almost', 'painfully', 'plodding', 'experience', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'opportunities', 'deliver', 'powerful', 'message', 'war', 'were', 'lost', 'Frankly', 'obvious', 'efforts', 'render', 'idealistic', 'classic', 'failed.In', 'terms', 'acting', 'none', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'were', 'presented', 'effectively', 'perhaps', 'not', 'even', 'believably', 'Part', 'problem', 'was', 'Brando', 'Clift', 'Martin', 'were', 'not', 'challenged', 'times', 'actually', 'seemed', 'be', 'disinterested', 'anything', 'reading', 'lines', 'inexperience', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Clift', 'Brando', 'were', 'extremely', 'weak', 'portrayals', 'characters', 'again', 'appreared', 'be', 'merely', 'going', 'lines.The', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'exceptional', 'Naturally', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'music', 'prosecution', 'when', 'further', 'elaboration', 'qualities', 'lack', 'thereof', 'film', 'purely', 'personal', 'note', 'had', 'trouble', 'what', 'perceived', 'attempt', 'portray', 'Brando', 'German', 'officer', 'character', 'even', 'cuddly', 'Nazi', 'director', 'took', 'attempted', 'idealism', 'bit', 'too', 'far']",N/A

Also, I believe I have avoided spoilers in these comments.  I enjoyed the movie, but I wholeheartedly encourage you to read the book, as they differ in significant ways.  The struggles within the characters are more important and engrossing than the combat which can be translated to film.  Many&#8230; if not most&#8230; of the general locations and events in the book are shown onscreen, but much more happens in each of these places than the film depicts. Michael's time in England and that prior to reuniting with Noah in France was minimal in the movie, but is significant in the book as the authors wartime experience mirrors closest that of this character.  In the book I was surprised to find out (and this is accurate) that from Dover you can see trucks on the french shoreline road, and that artillery in France can easily pound that part of costal England. If you see the film first, be aware that the book is much darker and morally less clean.  I understand why the scriptwriters changed what they did, but it does detract from the brutal truthfulness of the book.  Even the ending is changed in minimal but very, very significant ways.  I was glad to see that my favorite part of the book, Cpt Green's &#34;I will tell you what I will guarantee&#34; speech, made it into the movie, but even that is more poignant in the book where the complainant is not the local mayor, but a representative of fellow camp inmates.  In the book, when Christian is riding the motorcycle in the desert with Captain Hardenberg, it is Cpt Hardenberg who is driving and fully in charge of the developing situation, but I guess in the movie, Marlin Brando could not be seen as just being along for the ride&#8230; especially having filmed The Wild One just five years before.  Anti-Semitism in the Army is only hinted at in the movie, but is absolutely central to Noah's stateside experience in the book; his barracks window is not dirty by accident.

After a short while, I learned that the German side of the story was much more interesting (its dialogue, fighting scenes, etc.). The American side of the story was mostly annoying except for the last 30 minutes. I shortened up the movie by fast forwarding through most of the American parts (except for the last 30 minutes or so).The American side of the story was disappointing to me; the only fighting scenes for the Americans were during the last 30 minutes. On the American side, most of the movie is about the 2 men getting drafted, their girls, boot camp, their girls again, boot camp again...all during the first 2 hours and 15 minutes of the movie.I thought Marlon Brando did a wonderful job as the German officer. Throughout the movie, we see him question his German superiors, being disgusted with some of his orders, and slowly recognizing the horribleness of the Nazis. By the end of the movie, he had had enough.I didn't read the book, so I'm not sure if the movie follows the book.

266629,A276M3NSIY9B82,6301797930,Harry Brewer,"[0, 0]","The Young Lions was based on the Irwin Shaw novel of the same name BUT the novel & the film are NOT the same. The Young Lions has an exceptional cast that stars Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift & Dean Martin. The supporting cast includes Hope Lange, May Britt & Barbara Rush as the love interests. In lesser roles the cast includes some people that were familiar: Maximilian Schell, Lee Van Cleef, Parley Baer, Arthur Franz, L.Q. Jones, John Banner & Vaughn Taylor.Unfortunately, the film does NOT equal the star power. The film occurs mostly during WWII but it's not really a war film. It's more about personal relationships during a very trying time. There are some action sequences but not many.It's the character of Christian Diestl (Marlon Brando) that's changed the most from the novel. The film presents as a loyal German, a nationalist, who becomes disillusioned due to the war. He's idealistic & sympathetic but by the end he realizes he has compromised his values. The casting of Brando led to the change in character of Diestl; Brando is good in the role but he's reserved in his character though there are occasional emotional outbreaks.Noah Ackerman (Montgomery Clift) is a Jewish American who's shy & idealistic. Upon joining the Army he finds himself a victim of prejudice from his own countrymen. Clift, much like Brando, became a major star in his first film role. Brando in his first film, The Men (1950) received top billing. Clift's first film, Red River (1948), received second billing due to the fact it starred John Wayne. It was with his second film, The Search (1948), that he would receive top billing.Michael Whiteacre (Dean Martin) is an American entertainer on the verge of stardom. He's an unwilling participant & tries to avoid the draft, he even admits to being a coward. In contrast to Brando & Clift, Martin wasn't considered a great actor though he had more experience in film. He was already a veteran of 17 films as a co-headliner or very close. I say 17 films that doesn't include cameos. I'm not sure if Some Came Running was before or after The Young Lions (I'm going with after) so this film was most likely his first role that was non-comedic. It is my impression that Martin held his own against the two giants of acting that he co-starred with in this film.The film is 167 minutes & much too long. It's essentially two different story lines; one with Brando & the other with Clift & Martin. None of the three participants are in a scene together except for one of the final ones but there isn't any dialog between them. I know this film received major accolades in its day but as you can tell from the reviews there are a lot of differences in opinion. It was nominated for 3 Academy Awards (Best B & W Cinematography, Best Drama or Comedy Score & Best Sound) but didn't take any of them home. Edward Dmytryk was nominated for Best Director by the Directors Guild of America but didn't win it.The audio & video are in excellent shape &, except for trailers, there aren't any real bonus features.",3,The Young Lions,1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,3038,"['Young', 'Lions', 'was', 'based', 'Irwin', 'Shaw', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'BUT', 'novel', 'film', 'are', 'NOT', 'same', 'Young', 'Lions', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'May', 'Britt', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'love', 'interests', 'lesser', 'roles', 'cast', 'people', 'were', 'familiar', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'Lee', 'Van', 'Cleef', 'Parley', 'Baer', 'Arthur', 'Franz', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'John', 'Banner', 'Vaughn', 'Taylor.Unfortunately', 'film', 'NOT', 'equal', 'star', 'power', 'film', 'mostly', 'WWII', 'not', 'really', 'war', 'film', 'more', 'personal', 'relationships', 'very', 'trying', 'time', 'are', 'action', 'sequences', 'not', 'many.It', 'character', 'Christian', 'Diestl', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'changed', 'most', 'novel', 'film', 'presents', 'loyal', 'German', 'nationalist', 'who', 'disillusioned', 'due', 'war', 'idealistic', 'sympathetic', 'end', 'compromised', 'values', 'casting', 'Brando', 'led', 'change', 'character', 'Diestl', 'Brando', 'good', 'role', 'reserved', 'character', 'are', 'occasional', 'emotional', 'outbreaks.Noah', 'Ackerman', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Jewish', 'American', 'who', 'shy', 'idealistic', 'joining', 'Army', 'victim', 'prejudice', 'own', 'countrymen', 'Clift', 'much', 'Brando', 'became', 'major', 'star', 'first', 'film', 'role', 'Brando', 'first', 'film', 'Men', '1950', 'received', 'top', 'billing', 'Clift', 'first', 'film', 'Red', 'River', '1948', 'received', 'second', 'billing', 'due', 'fact', 'starred', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'second', 'film', 'Search', '1948', 'would', 'receive', 'top', 'billing.Michael', 'Whiteacre', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'American', 'entertainer', 'verge', 'stardom', 'unwilling', 'participant', 'tries', 'avoid', 'draft', 'even', 'being', 'coward', 'contrast', 'Brando', 'Clift', 'Martin', 'was', ""n't"", 'considered', 'great', 'actor', 'had', 'more', 'experience', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'veteran', '17', 'films', 'co-headliner', 'very', 'close', 'say', '17', 'films', ""n't"", 'include', 'cameos', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Came', 'Running', 'was', 'Young', 'Lions', ""'m"", 'going', 'so', 'film', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'first', 'role', 'was', 'non-comedic', 'impression', 'Martin', 'held', 'own', 'two', 'giants', 'acting', 'co-starred', 'film.The', 'film', '167', 'minutes', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'essentially', 'two', 'different', 'story', 'lines', 'one', 'Brando', 'other', 'Clift', 'Martin', 'None', 'three', 'participants', 'are', 'scene', 'together', 'one', 'final', 'ones', ""n't"", 'dialog', 'know', 'film', 'received', 'major', 'accolades', 'day', 'can', 'tell', 'reviews', 'are', 'lot', 'differences', 'opinion', 'was', 'nominated', '3', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'B', 'W', 'Cinematography', 'Best', 'Drama', 'Comedy', 'Score', 'Best', 'Sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'home', 'Edward', 'Dmytryk', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Director', 'Directors', 'Guild', 'America', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'it.The', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'excellent', 'shape', 'trailers', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'bonus', 'features']",N/A

In this film based on the novel by Irwin Shaw, Brando plays a Nazi officer who is in the new word of the month, ""conflicted"" by what the Germans are doing. There is one scene, for example, where he disobeys an order by his superior officer played by Maximillian Schell to kill a soldier. Even though this film is shot in black and white, it is obvious that the makeup people have died Brando's hair light blond, something that doesn't quite work with his dark eyes and eyebrows. While this is certainly not his best performance, watching the greatest American actor of his generation in always mesmerizing.Montgomery Clift, who plays a Jewish American GI, is not Brando, however. Although I know that many people rave about Clift's acting abilities he often leaves me cold with his strange wall-eyed stares as he does here in much of the movie although he gets better as the film progresses. A very young Dean Martin as a performer who gets drafted, Hope Lange and Barbara Rush are in the film as well.The action begins with grand panoramic snow skiing scenes in Bavaria; then the action moves to New York, North Africa, Paris and London. There are two stories here-- that of the American soldiers and Brando and the German troops-- that never come together until the very end of the movie.Filmed in 1958, ""The Young Lions"" is a bit dated and had to conform with the then standards of decency so there is a lot of deep kissing here but with everybody keeping their clothes on.

That the director had the confidence to cast Dean Martin as one of the leads is impressive in itself.  At this point, Dean Martin had only made one other movie since splitting up with Jerry Lewis - a dud comedy called ""10,000 Bedrooms"".  But the casting works.  Martin is very good in his part as one of two American GIs in Europe during WWII, along with Montgomery Clift.  Brando surprised me.

Stars Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift and Dean Martin.Marlon is a young German watchmaker who always dreamed of being a doctor - but the strict caste system of europe has held him down. While he realizes the Nazis are a bit extreme, he hopes they will help to bring opportunity to all people.Dean is a young Broadway god who loves the wine, women and song. When he's drafted, he tries to get out of it, to maintain his easy going life. He runs into Noah (Clift) at the draft board - a young, poor Jewish man who has no family and only a simple job at Macy's. The two hang out and Noah falls in love with a quiet Vermont girl.The movie is truly an epic as it spans the entire war, from its quiet start to its brutal end. Along the way we realize that there is good and bad on all sides. Marlon's character tries to make a stand for what is right, but is told repeatedly that a good German soldier follows orders. He falls in love with a French widow. Noah is repeatedly beaten on (both emotionally and literally) for being a poor Jew by those whose side he is on. His future father in law only reluctantly accepts him, and his squadron mates steal his money and fight him. Dean refuses to marry his long time sweetheart and does his best to avoid any risks.While some might say the story is a cliche, perhaps this is only because the story is so TRUE. It is always good to be reminded just how rough a war really is, and how there are no real &quot;bad guys&quot; and &quot;good guys&quot;. There are only brave men and women who try their best and grow along the awy.Although filmed in black and white, you do get some lovely Bavarian landscapes at the beginning, when Marlon is a ski instructor.

Although the screenplay holds pretty well in going back and forth among the characters, and does have some good character development, it is rather contrived and full of cliches which make it fizzle out particularly near the end.The character of Clift as a Jewish American is an interesting one but the story already becomes somewhat heavy handed when his character marries a WASP woman with a reluctant anti-semitic father who has a change of heart.  Although Martin played his character reasonably well as the entertaining bon vivant, he essentially plays himself and so there's nothing too unique about his performance.  Brando is the philandering German soldier with a heart.  A patriotic German, he's not a party member, and begins to realize that being a Wermacht soldier can involve some pretty unsavory tasks.  The most ludicrous scene is near the end when Brando is fleeing from the front in Normandy and stumbles into a concentration camp and its commandant rambling about his orders to speed up the extermination process.  There's only one problem, there were never any concentration camps in France during any part of the German occupation.Overall, this film is far too long and too dull for what it offers which is nothing but cliche after cliche.  This film is overrated and definitely not Brando's best film.  A better WWII film with Brando as a German is 'Morituri' co-starring Yul Brynner.

And honestly, a great many young and old Germans shared a belief in that promise. Our ""good"" German sees combat in France and North Africa before ending his career in the West against the Americans played by Clift and Martin. Their encounter underscores the painful truth about war, which is men kill men with whom in other circumstances they might have been friends.There is also an interesting connection between Brando's German and Martin's American as they share an interest in the same American woman.One of the most interesting scenes in the movie takes place early on as Brando's German has dinner with a comrade and his comrade's two French female friends. The French woman paired with Brando's German takes the opportunity to slam the Boche and as Brando accepts her withering attack, the camera pans to show two SS Officers beginning to show interest in the goings on at Brando's table.

I received this movie and watched it before I had ever read the book. The book is fine, but the movie is so much better. The film and the novel are very different, hardly having anything in common. Here are some of the differences:1). In the novel, Dean Martin's character Michael Whiteacre is married. In the film, not so. He's got a girl, but they're not married.2). In the novel, Montgomery Clift's character Noah Ackerman meets his wife at a party that he and a friend, who is not even mentioned in the movie, give at their apartment. In the movie, Dean introduces them.3). In the novel, Marlon Brando's character Christian Diestl turns out as the war goes on to be cold-blooded, enjoying what he does. In the movie, his character is more symapathetic and doesn't like what is being done.4). In the novel, Montgomery's character fights ten men after they stole the money which he was going to use to buy his wife a birthday present with. In the movie, it was only a handlful, about four to five at most. Though, in the novel and the movie he does get his rear beat repeatedly and only wins the last fight.5). And the biggest difference is that Montgomery's character dies in the novel, but in the movie lives to return home to his wife and daugther (which in the novel had been a son).There are other differences, but those are the most noticable. Marlon Brando does a wonderful job portraying a German who believes in his country, but who begins to doubt the way that Hitler and the Nazis' are going about it, because even though he is a German soilder, he is not a Nazi (which is another difference between the novel and the movie). Montgomery Clift is heartbreaking as the Jewish man that not only has to fight to survive the war, but who has to also fight to survive the cruel antisemitic treatment he receives from his fellow men. Most importantly about this film, however, or at least to me, this is the movie that showed everyone that Dean Martin could act; that he could make it without Jerry Lewis. After the failure of his first movie without Jerry, he made this film and received hardly anything for doing so; he did this because that was the only way they would give it to him. He did an amazing job as the man who's not afraid to admit that he's scared and he doesn't want to die--that he's a coward, but in the end triumphs.I loved every minute of it.

What separates The Young Lions from more standard fare is the smoldering performance of Marlon Brando as a conflicted German Officer. The story follows the ultimately intersecting paths of Brando's character with two american GIs rather stereotypically played by Dean Martin and Montgomery Clift. For the first two thirds of the film these stories are developed in tandem. Brando is shown as a Bavarian ski instructor who becomes an officer. Scenes in Paris and the North African front give him the opportunity to flesh out his character.Overall this is a very well done film for it's day. I add that caveat because it is in some places a bit dated, particularly in the romantic scenes.

They are both ""hard heads,' determined to live by their own special code of honor... The chief difference is that Noah is not alone... Throughout the film, he is accompanied by a friend, who has a number of reasons to be against the war... Also Noah gets the girl of his dreams... He even marries her...'The Young Lions' retains its impact as one of the better films made about war... The combat scenes are limited in scale but brilliantly staged and photographed, with good direction of a complex script and a masterly musical score by Hugo Friedhofer...Director Dmytryk never misses an opportunity to underline how war comes into collision with the destinies of people... When Brando encounters May Britt - as the wife of his superior officer, Maximilian Schell - she is the perfect image of Nazi vices: Corrupt, hedonistic, and, of course, condemned along with the rest of the decadent Germans... Her hazardous beauty is used as counterpoint to Brando's enthusiasm and beliefs: She represents all that is bad and immoral while he is everything noble and pure...Dmytryk is less awkward depicting the relationship between Clift and Lange: Their Love is a natural condition... They belong together... Like Robert E. Lee Prewitt, Clift's Noah is ill-at-ease socially... When he meets Lange, his reaction is clear, spontaneous, purposeful, direct... He begins to babble a lot to make an impression on her, because, as he tells her later, ""I was afraid that if I was myself you wouldn't look at me twice."" But Hope was gracious enough to attend the guy... The young nice girl has at last found her favorite kind of hero...Clift, who finds himself standing up for his rights and for principles he did not even know he had, pared his lines to the minimum needed to convey the essence of Noah Ackerman... The prison sequence is a clear and simple proof of it... The emotional urgency of the young couple is communicated through looks, small gestures, and soft and tender words of love and caring...Nominated for Best Cinematography, Best music and Best Sound, Dmytryk's motion picture is a moving and eloquent statement of how war collides with the destinies of people and hurls them into a maelstrom...",4,An eloquent statement with a masterly musical score ever composed for a war film...,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,2315,"['More', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'exists', 'Clift', 'Noah', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Prewitt', ""'From"", 'Here', 'Eternity', 'are', 'hard', 'heads', 'determined', 'live', 'own', 'special', 'code', 'honor', 'chief', 'difference', 'Noah', 'not', 'alone', 'film', 'accompanied', 'friend', 'who', 'number', 'reasons', 'be', 'war', 'Also', 'Noah', 'girl', 'dreams', 'even', 'Young', 'Lions', 'impact', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'made', 'war', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'limited', 'scale', 'brilliantly', 'staged', 'photographed', 'good', 'direction', 'complex', 'script', 'masterly', 'musical', 'score', 'Hugo', 'Friedhofer', 'Director', 'Dmytryk', 'never', 'opportunity', 'underline', 'how', 'war', 'collision', 'destinies', 'people', 'When', 'Brando', 'May', 'Britt', 'wife', 'superior', 'officer', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'perfect', 'image', 'Nazi', 'vices', 'Corrupt', 'hedonistic', 'course', 'condemned', 'rest', 'decadent', 'Germans', 'hazardous', 'beauty', 'used', 'counterpoint', 'Brando', 'enthusiasm', 'beliefs', 'bad', 'immoral', 'everything', 'noble', 'pure', 'Dmytryk', 'less', 'awkward', 'depicting', 'relationship', 'Clift', 'Lange', 'Love', 'natural', 'condition', 'belong', 'together', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Prewitt', 'Clift', 'Noah', 'ill-at-ease', 'socially', 'When', 'Lange', 'reaction', 'clear', 'spontaneous', 'purposeful', 'direct', 'babble', 'lot', 'make', 'impression', 'because', 'later', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'twice', 'Hope', 'was', 'gracious', 'enough', 'attend', 'guy', 'young', 'nice', 'girl', 'last', 'found', 'favorite', 'kind', 'hero', 'Clift', 'who', 'standing', 'up', 'rights', 'principles', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'had', 'pared', 'lines', 'minimum', 'needed', 'convey', 'essence', 'Noah', 'Ackerman', 'prison', 'sequence', 'clear', 'simple', 'proof', 'emotional', 'urgency', 'young', 'couple', 'communicated', 'looks', 'small', 'gestures', 'soft', 'tender', 'words', 'love', 'caring', 'Nominated', 'Best', 'Cinematography', 'Best', 'music', 'Best', 'Sound', 'Dmytryk', 'motion', 'picture', 'moving', 'eloquent', 'statement', 'how', 'war', 'destinies', 'people', 'hurls', 'maelstrom']",N/A

I haven't read Shaw's novel, but it's clear that he wrote the story from three separate points-of-view.  Interior monologues are one of the great strengths of the novel and a great weakness of big-screen movies.  Unless thoughts and emotions are translated into interesting action most - not all - movies quickly grow stagnant.Which is more or less what happens here.  Director Edward Dmytryk had an interest in and a solid reputation with this type of material.  One of the first movies to deal with anti-semitism head-on was his film ""Crossfire,"" which preceded ""Gentleman's Agreement"" by a few months.  In ""Crossfire"" Dmytryk hedged his bets by wrapping the message around an engaging murder mystery.  In THE YOUNG LIONS it seems Dmytryk is trying to bring life to an internalized story by casting the two great Method actors Clift and Brando.  It kind of works in Clift's case and fails with Brando, who remains a cipher throughout.  Oddly enough, good old singer-turned-actor Dino Martin comes across the best.

266662,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6301797930,T O'Brien,"[0, 0]","Based on a novel by Irving Shaw, The Young Lions is a rare WWII movie in that it tries to tell the story of both sides, German and American, through three separate characters.  Christian Diestl is a young lieutenant in the German army, an idealistic German and not a Nazi, who begins to question his beliefs has the war takes a turn for the worse and he sees what war brings out in people.  Noah Ackerman is a loner who meets a young woman and falls in love, marrying her days before heading off to boot camp.  Ackerman must deal with the anti-Semetic prejudices of many people around him when all he wants to do is prove himself.  Mike Whiteacre is a Broadway singer and an admitted coward who is fed up with being drafted.  With a run time of just under three hours, the characters are given a chance to develop and grow in a believable way as the war begins in the late 1930s and continues as the tide turns in Europe.  Some scenes will have a lasting impact, Diestl walking through bombed out Berlin, Diestl talking with a SS commandant of a concentration camp, and the liberation of the same camp by the Americans.  This isn't an action movie, but the battle scenes are well-done and very tense.  An all-around solid movie that doesn't get the respect it deserves.Leading a great cast, Marlon Brando gets top billing and the most screen time as Christian Diestl, the idealistic young German officer trying to come to terms with what the war is actually about.  Brando gives one of his best, if not most well-known, performances as Diestl.  In a role somewhat similar to his part in From Here To Eternity, Montgomery Clift gives an excellent performance as Noah Ackerman, a Jewish soldier with his bride and baby girl at home while he deals with prejudices from his own Army.  Dean Martin is solid as Mike Whiteacre, a Broadway singer trying to overcome his deepest fears.  All three of the main leads make their characters believable and likable, something that can be hard to do with a war movie.  The supporting cast is excellent as well including Hope Lange, Barbara Rush, May Britt, Maximillian Schell, Lee Van Cleef, Arthur Franz, Parley Baer, Dora Doll, and Hal Baylor.The DVD presents the movie in a beautiful widescreen presentation that really shows off the black and white cinematography, which earned the movie an Oscar nomination.  A theatrical trailer is included along with trailers from six other Fox war movies, including Halls of Montezuma and Guadalcanal Diary.

266663,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6301797930,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 7]","Heavily diluting Irwin Shaw's doorstop novel about two American soldiers and one Nazi whose paths gradually converge over the years from 1939-45 into an expensive but mostly not very good, often surprisingly studiobound CinemaScope soap opera, 1958's The Young Lions delivers a lot less dramatic weight than you'd expect from a film featuring both Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift.The two stars only encounter each other in the film's last couple of minutes and don't even share a scene, but there's little doubt that if they did it would have been Brando who would have walked away with it, and not just because he has the most interesting character. Despite looking every inch the blonde Aryan ubermensch, his Christian is a much more sympathetic creation than the character in Shaw's novel, here a somewhat nave believer in the Nazi Party who is gradually disillusioned and destroyed by the brutality he sees in service that takes him from Paris to North Africa and, ultimately, a near-abandoned concentration camp. In the novel Christian remained an unrepentant Nazi to the end, killing Clift's Jewish soldier before being killed himself, but the novel changes him from bully into victim in what would become the clich&eacute;d screen image of `the good German' who doesn't realise what the Nazis really are until it's too late (a change that infuriated Clift). Yet Brando, playing his part softly, manages to convince in a way his co-star never does, especially in his early scene when he tries inarticulately to explain to an American girl why he thinks the Nazi Party is a good thing for Germany.Sadly there's no doubting that the film's biggest liability as far as casting goes is Montgomery Clift, delivering one of the worst and most inappropriately amateurish performances you'll ever see from a great actor. Even allowing for the effects of the accident that left half his face paralysed, he's hopelessly miscast despite the role being reduced to little more than a variation of his From Here to Eternity persona: looking much older and frailer than his years, it's impossible to believe he's the young A-1 soldier other characters talk about. It's hard to tell whether he genuinely improves in the second half of the film or you just get used to the array of clumsy mannerism and inflections he adopts: certainly his last big speech is a painful bit of curiously underpowered overacting. Knowing that Clift felt it was his finest screen work and was certain it would land him an Oscar only makes it seem all the more painful. By contrast, Dean Martin's less prominent role as a Broadway star pulling strings to stay out of the front line who befriends him is much more convincing. Maximilian Schell, sounding curiously like a young Alan Arkin, also makes an impression as Brando's ruthless immediate superior, as does Parley Baer as Christian's bon vivant friend.George Stevens had tried to make the film years earlier, and he'd probably have done a better job of it than Edward Dmytryk who, post-blacklist, directs like a man who isn't taking any chances and who doesn't want any trouble. It's very much an old-school, rather stolid production for much of the running time, with limited location work in Europe and stock newsreel footage mixing less than convincingly with overfamiliar standing sets on the 20th Century Fox backlot.There are moments when the picture briefly sputters into life: a sequence of triumphant Nazi soldiers swarming over the steps of the Sacre Coeur in Paris like flies on a sugarlump as they take tourist photos of each other; an uncomfortable walk through a small town as Clift's prospective father-in-law who has never even met a Jew is forced to face his own anti-Semitism; Brando walking through the decimated streets of a blitzed Berlin; and an encounter with a self-justifying concentration camp commander who prides himself on being a good soldier (a scene somewhat compromised by half of his dialogue being dubbed by a French actor and the rest played in his own thick German accent). Certainly there is enough to make the film worth watching despite the not always convincing romantic subplots - Dean Martin and Barbara Rush's being particularly confused and underwhelming - but nowhere near enough to make the film live up to its potential, let alone become the `most revered film of this generation' that the film's laughably hype-heavy trailer promised.Aside from trailers for other Fox war films (including a bizarre DVD trailer for Tora! Tora! Tora! designed to make it look like Pearl Harbor!) the only extra is that over the top original trailer for the film, which spends almost as much time promoting producer Al Lichtman as it does the

266664,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6301797930,Wuchak,"[10, 10]","""The Young Lions"" is a black & white 1958 WWII drama featuring Marlon Brando, Dean Martin (in his film debut) and Montgomery Clift.THE PLOT: The film attempts to show the German, American and French sides of the war. Brando stars as a young German officer who becomes increasingly disillusioned with Hitler's regime and the world war he started. Martin plays a worldly Broadway musician who struggles with cowardice. Montgomery Clift's character is a poor, naive Jewish American who falls in love with Hope Lange and fights the anti-semitic guys in his platoon.VARIOUS HIGHLIGHTS: I'm a huge fan of Marlon Brando and his performance in this film illustrates why. Brando is utterly captivating! 'Nuff said. Most reviewers note that Brando's German storyline is more interesting than the two American story lines, which is true, but repeat viewings grant the viewer more appreciation for the latter.There are three incredibly gorgeous women featured in the picture: Barbara Rush, May Britt and Liliane Montevecchi. Rush is Martin's marriage-minded gal, who flirts with Brando early on; Britt plays the luscious sexpot wife of Brando's captain (Maximilian Schell); and Montevecchi performs as a French girl who initially insults Brando (because he's a German occupant) yet ultimately falls for his charm.It should be pointed out that ""The Young Lions"" is not a war action film, but rather a powerful war DRAMA. Yes, there's quite a bit of action (France, Northern Africa, etc.), but the emphasis is on the characters and their stories. The climax involves a horrified and utterly disillusioned Brando, leaving a strong impact.FINAL WORD: If you're looking for a mindless action flick this is not the one to see. This perhaps explains some of the less-than-stellar reviews. Yet, make no mistake, ""The Young Lions"" is without a doubt a WAR film. It's also a masterpiece of cinematic art, not to mention one of Brando's most mesmerizing performances.GRADE A",5,Outstanding War DRAMA (with Some Action),1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,1951,"['Young', 'Lions', 'black', 'white', '1958', 'WWII', 'drama', 'featuring', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'film', 'debut', 'Montgomery', 'Clift.THE', 'PLOT', 'film', 'attempts', 'show', 'German', 'American', 'French', 'sides', 'war', 'Brando', 'young', 'German', 'officer', 'who', 'increasingly', 'disillusioned', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'world', 'war', 'started', 'Martin', 'worldly', 'Broadway', 'musician', 'who', 'cowardice', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'character', 'poor', 'naive', 'Jewish', 'American', 'who', 'love', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'fights', 'anti-semitic', 'guys', 'platoon.VARIOUS', 'HIGHLIGHTS', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'performance', 'film', 'why', 'Brando', 'utterly', 'captivating', ""'Nuff"", 'said', 'Most', 'reviewers', 'note', 'Brando', 'German', 'storyline', 'more', 'interesting', 'two', 'American', 'story', 'lines', 'true', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'grant', 'viewer', 'more', 'appreciation', 'latter.There', 'are', 'three', 'incredibly', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'featured', 'picture', 'Barbara', 'Rush', 'May', 'Britt', 'Liliane', 'Montevecchi', 'Rush', 'Martin', 'marriage-minded', 'gal', 'who', 'Brando', 'early', 'Britt', 'luscious', 'sexpot', 'wife', 'Brando', 'captain', 'Maximilian', 'Schell', 'Montevecchi', 'performs', 'French', 'girl', 'who', 'initially', 'insults', 'Brando', 'German', 'occupant', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'charm.It', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'Young', 'Lions', 'not', 'war', 'action', 'film', 'rather', 'powerful', 'war', 'DRAMA', 'Yes', 'quite', 'bit', 'action', 'France', 'Northern', 'Africa', 'etc', 'emphasis', 'characters', 'stories', 'climax', 'horrified', 'utterly', 'disillusioned', 'Brando', 'leaving', 'strong', 'impact.FINAL', 'WORD', ""'re"", 'looking', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'not', 'one', 'see', 'perhaps', 'less-than-stellar', 'reviews', 'make', 'mistake', 'Young', 'Lions', 'doubt', 'WAR', 'film', 'also', 'masterpiece', 'cinematic', 'art', 'not', 'mention', 'one', 'Brando', 'most', 'mesmerizing', 'performances.GRADE']",N/A
