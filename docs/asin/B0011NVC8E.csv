I use disc 1 as one workout and disc 2 as another workout, on alternating days (similar to the 45/45 split workout, which is one of my favorites).  WOW!  The workouts are challenging and effective!  I originally bought this DVD to add  an additional 10 or 20 minutes to other workouts, which I may do in the future, but for now,  I'm getting great results using it as two complete workouts.  Each workout takes about an hour+- and I would say that  they are high intermediate to advanced workouts.  I strongly recommend this DVD!  I hope that Gilad will make a 60/60 split routine workout and some more 45/45 split workouts...  This is the perfect system/formula.",5,challenging and fun!,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,693,"['great', 'workout', 'DVD', 'use', 'disc', '1', 'one', 'workout', 'disc', '2', 'workout', 'alternating', 'days', 'similar', '45/45', 'split', 'workout', 'one', 'favorites', 'WOW', 'workouts', 'are', 'challenging', 'effective', 'originally', 'bought', 'DVD', 'add', 'additional', '10', '20', 'minutes', 'other', 'workouts', 'may', 'do', 'future', 'now', ""'m"", 'getting', 'great', 'results', 'using', 'two', 'complete', 'workouts', 'workout', 'hour+-', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'high', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'workouts', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'hope', 'Gilad', 'will', 'make', '60/60', 'split', 'routine', 'workout', 'more', '45/45', 'split', 'workouts', 'perfect', 'system/formula']",Gilad: 15 Targeted Express Workouts

1131905,A26MVLLMLG3Q8B,B0011NVC8E,"Avid Reader ""Karen""","[15, 15]","This DVD set is a great buy for both workout quality and quantity. The DVD is well chaptered and you can go right to the specified workout and the workout starts right away. For some good ideas on how to use these DVDs, go to Gilad's website, click on Express Workouts and you can download 8 week rotations for beginner and intermediate.Workouts: Don't be fooled by the 10 minute workouts - you will fatigue the muscle worked during each workout. The cardio workouts are fun and easy to follow and they will warm you up to do the resistance training, but they will not qualify as cardio workouts. I especially liked the core workouts. You will see some of Gilad's usual ab routines, but he throws in some Pilates and yoga exercises and works the back which many core workouts ignore. These were pretty thorough core workouts for 10 minutes.Setting: Not Gilad's usual setting, but who can argue with an ocean view in Hawaii?Music: Typical of Gilad's shows, the music is not exciting but not distracting or annoying.Crew: There are different people working out in each section. There are always 2 people (both men and women) working out with Gilad who are always demonstrating perfect form.Equipment Needed: You only need dumbbells for these workouts and a little space in front of your TV.Instructor: Gilad is the best! He is positive and encouraging without being over the top or irritating. His cueing and explanation of proper form is excellent as always. He was a little more down to business and not as light hearted as he is on Fit TV.I have used these DVDs over and over because there is no dread factor with these workouts and I know I am getting a good workout.",5,Great resistance exercises!,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,1669,"['DVD', 'set', 'great', 'buy', 'workout', 'quality', 'quantity', 'DVD', 'well', 'chaptered', 'can', 'go', 'right', 'specified', 'workout', 'workout', 'right', 'away', 'good', 'ideas', 'how', 'use', 'DVDs', 'go', 'Gilad', 'website', 'click', 'Express', 'Workouts', 'can', 'download', '8', 'week', 'rotations', 'beginner', 'intermediate.Workouts', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', '10', 'minute', 'workouts', 'will', 'fatigue', 'muscle', 'worked', 'workout', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'are', 'fun', 'easy', 'follow', 'will', 'warm', 'up', 'do', 'resistance', 'training', 'will', 'not', 'qualify', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'especially', 'liked', 'core', 'workouts', 'will', 'see', 'Gilad', 'usual', 'ab', 'routines', 'Pilates', 'yoga', 'exercises', 'back', 'many', 'core', 'workouts', 'ignore', 'were', 'pretty', 'thorough', 'core', 'workouts', '10', 'minutes.Setting', 'Not', 'Gilad', 'usual', 'setting', 'who', 'can', 'argue', 'ocean', 'view', 'Hawaii', 'Music', 'Typical', 'Gilad', 'shows', 'music', 'not', 'exciting', 'not', 'distracting', 'annoying.Crew', 'are', 'different', 'people', 'working', 'out', 'section', 'are', 'always', '2', 'people', 'men', 'women', 'working', 'out', 'Gilad', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'demonstrating', 'perfect', 'form.Equipment', 'Needed', 'only', 'need', 'dumbbells', 'workouts', 'little', 'space', 'front', 'TV.Instructor', 'Gilad', 'best', 'positive', 'encouraging', 'being', 'top', 'irritating', 'cueing', 'explanation', 'proper', 'form', 'excellent', 'always', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'down', 'business', 'not', 'light', 'hearted', 'Fit', 'TV.I', 'have', 'used', 'DVDs', 'over', 'dread', 'factor', 'workouts', 'know', 'am', 'getting', 'good', 'workout']",Gilad: 15 Targeted Express Workouts

1131912,A32HAMICRE52M,B0011NVC8E,Pippa Lee,"[59, 59]","Like other reviewers of Gilad's products, I was introduced to his no-frills aerobics workouts back in the nineties. I used to tape his ""Bodies in Motion"" and his sister's ""Basic Training"" workouts to use over the weekends. As my level of fitness improved, I moved on to other instructors. Then, life got more complicated. Knees became weaker and yoga replaced jogging and jumping.  For quite a number of years my Gilad tapes laid in the back of my closet collecting dust.  A couple of months ago, however, and while I was looking for a way to get some much needed aerobic conditioning without killing my knees, I rediscovered Gilad again.Any  time-deprived fan of Gilad will appreciate ""Express Workouts.""  I certainly am.  This 2-DVD set features 15 workouts that are under 10 minutes each. I can combine different segments to fit my schedule and to concentrate on the body parts I need to strengthen. DVD 1 features an 8-minute warm up and then individual segments meant to tone and work the back, chest, arms, shoulders, buns, hips and tights.  You'll need a set of weights if you're doing DVD 1.DVD 2 contains seven workouts. The first one, ""Dynamic Moves"" is a low impact workout. The moves (twists, squats, etc.) will certainly be familiar to those who have used other Gilad's DVDs.  The second segment, ""Strength & Balance"" is a yoga-inspired workout.  ""Basic Cardio 1"" is another low impact routine using grapevines, jump rope and boxing movements. ""Cardio 2-Challenge"" continues with the boxing and martial arts inspired movements. If you have done ""Gilad's Elite Forces Fat Burning Workout,"" you should have no problem doing both cardio segments back to back.  The fifth segment, ""Compound Strength"" combines lunges with biceps and triceps work.  In the final two segments, ""Core Foundations"" and ""Core Challenge,"" Gilad targets the abdominal area by doing crunches, roll ups and backstrokes.As always, Gilad is excellent in his emphasis on form. What I miss from this DVD, however, was the synergy he and his exercise mates had in the earlier programs.  It made those old ""Bodies in Motion"" workouts on the beach lively and full of fun to watch and follow. Still, I recommend ""Express Workouts"" to anybody who is starting a fitness program and to those who'd like to mix and customize their workouts to fit time availability, mood or need.",4,Good Job!,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2350,"['other', 'reviewers', 'Gilad', 'products', 'was', 'introduced', 'no-frills', 'aerobics', 'workouts', 'back', 'nineties', 'used', 'tape', 'Bodies', 'Motion', 'sister', 'Basic', 'Training', 'workouts', 'use', 'weekends', 'level', 'fitness', 'improved', 'moved', 'other', 'instructors', 'Then', 'life', 'got', 'more', 'complicated', 'Knees', 'became', 'weaker', 'yoga', 'replaced', 'jogging', 'jumping', 'quite', 'number', 'years', 'Gilad', 'tapes', 'laid', 'back', 'closet', 'collecting', 'dust', 'couple', 'months', 'ago', 'however', 'was', 'looking', 'way', 'get', 'much', 'needed', 'aerobic', 'conditioning', 'killing', 'knees', 'rediscovered', 'Gilad', 'time-deprived', 'fan', 'Gilad', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Express', 'Workouts', 'certainly', 'am', '2-DVD', 'set', 'features', '15', 'workouts', 'are', '10', 'minutes', 'can', 'combine', 'different', 'segments', 'fit', 'schedule', 'concentrate', 'body', 'parts', 'need', 'strengthen', 'DVD', '1', 'features', '8-minute', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'individual', 'segments', 'meant', 'tone', 'work', 'back', 'chest', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'buns', 'hips', 'tights', ""'ll"", 'need', 'set', 'weights', ""'re"", 'doing', 'DVD', '1.DVD', '2', 'contains', 'seven', 'workouts', 'first', 'one', 'Dynamic', 'Moves', 'low', 'impact', 'workout', 'moves', 'twists', 'squats', 'etc', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'familiar', 'who', 'have', 'used', 'other', 'Gilad', 'DVDs', 'second', 'segment', 'Strength', 'Balance', 'yoga-inspired', 'workout', 'Basic', 'Cardio', '1', 'low', 'impact', 'routine', 'using', 'grapevines', 'jump', 'rope', 'boxing', 'movements', 'Cardio', '2-Challenge', 'boxing', 'martial', 'arts', 'inspired', 'movements', 'have', 'done', 'Gilad', 'Elite', 'Forces', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Workout', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'doing', 'cardio', 'back', 'back', 'fifth', 'segment', 'Compound', 'Strength', 'combines', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'work', 'final', 'two', 'segments', 'Core', 'Foundations', 'Core', 'Challenge', 'Gilad', 'abdominal', 'area', 'doing', 'crunches', 'roll', 'ups', 'backstrokes.As', 'always', 'Gilad', 'excellent', 'emphasis', 'form', 'What', 'miss', 'DVD', 'however', 'was', 'synergy', 'exercise', 'mates', 'had', 'earlier', 'programs', 'made', 'old', 'Bodies', 'Motion', 'beach', 'lively', 'full', 'fun', 'watch', 'follow', 'Still', 'recommend', 'Express', 'Workouts', 'anybody', 'who', 'starting', 'fitness', 'program', 'who', ""'d"", 'like', 'mix', 'customize', 'workouts', 'fit', 'time', 'availability', 'mood', 'need']",Gilad: 15 Targeted Express Workouts
