1678066,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00GEKO51U,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","As a man, I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that I&#8217;ve spent quite a few hours of my life lingering in the shower long after I was done getting cleaned up.  It&#8217;s just a part of being a guy.  One thing I&#8217;ve never done (well, I won&#8217;t say never) is tended to particular duties in a public place.  While you may say that a sperm bank isn&#8217;t public, it is a place where everyone knows what you are doing behind that closed door.  I have a hard time with that.True story:A few years back (quite a few) when my wife and I were attempting to start our family, we visited a fertility doctor and of course the first thing they did was hand me a plastic container and pointed to a small room in the corner of a bigger room that was full of women sitting at desks, all of the desks regrettably facing that small room.  I walked over there and had a very pretty young woman point to a box of &#8216;magazines&#8217; and tell me to make sure I didn&#8217;t get any saliva in the cup.  Not sure what she thought I was going to do in there all by myself, but honest to god she told me that.  Leaving that room and facing all of those women while I was holding this plastic cup in my hands (because I didn&#8217;t see the paper bag next to the sink that I was supposed to put it in) was really&#8230;well, there are no words truthfully.I&#8217;m not a shy man by any means, but that was awkward.How Vince Vaughn managed to do that 600+ times is beyond me.Yup, &#8216;Delivery Man&#8217; tells the story of David, a single man with responsibility issues who is trying to commit to his girlfriend and his job when he finds out that the sperm bank he donated to hundreds of times (under the name &#8216;Starbuck&#8217;) made a really big &#8216;oops&#8217;.  That &#8216;oops&#8217; has made David a father of over 500 kids, and 142 (random number) have decided that they want to know who he is.  Of course, he is under no obligation to divulge his identity, since it is confidential, but he finds himself being sued by these kids and after taking an interest in them, he starts to get all paternal.I don&#8217;t know why, but I have a real soft spot for Vince Vaughn.  I always have.  I remember being a kid and being drawn to him, and this was back in the 90&#8217;s when he thought that he could make it as a dramatic actor.  Thankfully, his career got a second wind (or maybe it was a first wind) when he realized he was far better suited for comedy, and I still remember how the world was kind of taken aback by the way he so causally floated across the screen next to Pitt and Jolie in 2005&#8217;s &#8216;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&#8217;.  It was like a rebirth of sorts, and since then his career has been hotter than expected.  YES, Vaughn plays the same character in every single film, but he&#8217;s so natural and endearing in each of these movies that I find myself compelled to see them all.  Sure, they don&#8217;t always work as a whole, but he usually works, regardless of the film.&#8216;Delivery Man&#8217; is a very dumb movie.  So much of this film makes no sense in retrospect, but it is handled so well that it almost doesn&#8217;t matter.  I could sit here and poke at every plot-hole or dumb twist (that whole section with the addict daughter was ridiculous) and yet why should I bother.  Vaughn is funny, charming and endearing and by the end of the movie you are completely satisfied with his happy ending.  Sometimes that is all that matters.",4,Vaughn&#8217;s oats have been sewn&#8230;,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,3471,"['man', 'think', '8217', 'safe', 'assume', '8217', 'spent', 'quite', 'few', 'hours', 'life', 'lingering', 'shower', 'long', 'was', 'done', 'getting', 'cleaned', 'up', '8217', 's', 'just', 'part', 'being', 'guy', 'One', 'thing', '8217', 'never', 'done', 'well', 'won', '8217', 't', 'say', 'never', 'tended', 'particular', 'duties', 'public', 'place', 'may', 'say', 'sperm', 'bank', 'isn', '8217', 'public', 'place', 'where', 'everyone', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'closed', 'door', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'that.True', 'story', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'few', 'when', 'wife', 'were', 'attempting', 'start', 'family', 'visited', 'fertility', 'doctor', 'course', 'first', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'hand', 'plastic', 'container', 'pointed', 'small', 'room', 'corner', 'bigger', 'room', 'was', 'full', 'women', 'sitting', 'desks', 'desks', 'regrettably', 'facing', 'small', 'room', 'walked', 'had', 'very', 'pretty', 'young', 'woman', 'point', 'box', '8216', 'magazines', '8217', 'tell', 'make', 'sure', 'didn', '8217', 'get', 'saliva', 'cup', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'there', 'honest', 'god', 'told', 'Leaving', 'room', 'facing', 'women', 'was', 'holding', 'plastic', 'cup', 'hands', 'didn', '8217', 'see', 'paper', 'bag', 'sink', 'was', 'supposed', 'put', 'was', 'really', '8230', 'well', 'are', 'words', 'truthfully.I', '8217', 'm', 'not', 'shy', 'man', 'means', 'was', 'awkward.How', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'managed', 'do', '600+', 'times', 'me.Yup', '8216', 'Delivery', 'Man', '8217', 'story', 'David', 'single', 'man', 'responsibility', 'issues', 'who', 'trying', 'commit', 'girlfriend', 'job', 'when', 'out', 'sperm', 'bank', 'donated', 'hundreds', 'times', 'name', '8216', 'Starbuck', '8217', 'made', 'really', 'big', '8216', '8217', '8216', '8217', 'made', 'David', 'father', '500', 'kids', '142', 'random', 'number', 'have', 'decided', 'want', 'know', 'who', 'course', 'obligation', 'divulge', 'identity', 'confidential', 'being', 'sued', 'kids', 'taking', 'interest', 'get', 'paternal.I', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'why', 'have', 'real', 'soft', 'spot', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'always', 'have', 'remember', 'being', 'kid', 'being', 'drawn', 'was', 'back', '90', '8217', 's', 'when', 'thought', 'could', 'make', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'Thankfully', 'career', 'got', 'second', 'wind', 'maybe', 'was', 'first', 'wind', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'suited', 'comedy', 'still', 'remember', 'how', 'world', 'was', 'kind', 'taken', 'aback', 'way', 'so', 'causally', 'floated', 'screen', 'next', 'Pitt', 'Jolie', '2005', '8217', '8216', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', '8217', 'was', 'rebirth', 'sorts', 'then', 'career', 'been', 'hotter', 'expected', 'YES', 'Vaughn', 'same', 'character', 'single', 'film', '8217', 'so', 'natural', 'endearing', 'movies', 'find', 'compelled', 'see', 'Sure', 'don', '8217', 'always', 'work', 'whole', 'usually', 'regardless', 'film.', '8216', 'Delivery', 'Man', '8217', 'very', 'dumb', 'movie', 'So', 'much', 'film', 'sense', 'retrospect', 'handled', 'so', 'well', 'almost', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'matter', 'could', 'sit', 'here', 'poke', 'plot-hole', 'dumb', 'twist', 'whole', 'section', 'addict', 'daughter', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'why', 'should', 'bother', 'Vaughn', 'funny', 'charming', 'endearing', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'happy', 'ending', 'matters']",Delivery Man

Now available on Blu-ray, DVD, Digital and On-Demand, Delivery Man is a heartwarming comedy that delivers just that. Having come across many mixed reviews on this film, I was anxious to see what this was all about. In this film David Wozniak (Vince) is a delivery man for the family meat business with a huge debt on his shoulders. I thought the movie did have a slow start but later felt it was related more to David's boring life.The movie kept sexual innuendos to a minimum which I really liked when taking other similar comedies into consideration. This film also takes on an artistic form, as David (Vince) decides to visit some of his offspring and views them for who they are without judgement or prejudice. Even during most of these discoveries, David works very hard at keeping his emotional distance. At one point, Vince refers to his now pregnant girlfriend as his real life. A conflicting scene which really pulls at the heartstrings of the viewer.Vince Vaughn was great in this film, he is a simple guy with a major problem, and such is life sometimes. In the end David was torn between saving himself or doing what he thought was the right thing. My husband and I both enjoyed this film and thought it was just adorable. If people were expecting a film like Vince Vaughn in &#34;Wedding Crashers,&#34; I can see why maybe they would be disappointed. This film moved really fast and I never felt like I was not entertained. I would highly recommend this movie to any one who likes light heartwarming comedy.A complimentary copy of this film was received.

Vince Vaughn finds himself in a movie with a farcical premise, but the director gives him nothing to do but be all serious.  This should not be an all-serious movie.  (Dear lord, there's even a kid in a wheelchair who can't speak.)  I swear, I think sometimes I live on a different planet where what seems like a hilarious concept to me here on Planet Earth is &#34;touching&#34; and &#34;heartfelt&#34; to everyone else on Mars.  I would remind everyone of Josef Stalin's famous quote about death: &#34;One death is a tragedy; one million is a statistic.&#34;  The application here would be: &#34;A sperm donor's child searching for his or her father is drama; 533 children doing the same thing is farce.&#34;  It's like they turned Ron Burgundy into Hamlet, or something.Sidebar question: who did Vaughn owe money to?  Never explained in the movie.  Along with taking the diametrically wrong approach to their story, the writers couldn't even competently plot their story.  If they thought detailed explanations of Vaughn's money troubles would distract us from the main action, they were mistaken.  Vaughn owes 100 Large to thugs who rough him up, and later rough up his elderly father.  Seems like an important clue to Vaughn's character.  Actually, though, it turns out to be a plot contrivance for later in the film when a large amount of money is at stake, enabling Vaughn to make a Moral Choice about his dilemma.  Pro tip for the screenwriters: just have the guy owe back-taxes, if you need him to have money troubles.  So much simpler.Back to the main plot.  The writers don't know what they're talking about.  1) Donor anonymity has been guaranteed since forever; a case like the one presented here probably wouldn't pass a judge's smell-test.  2) Donor anonymity is also rapidly becoming a thing of the past with the advent of DNA testing and simple Google searches.  Are the filmmakers seriously telling us that a couple hundred tech-savvy 20-year-olds can't find out who their father is?  Well, maybe the story was originally written 20 years ago or something.  Well, today such a story is obsolete.I started to give this movie 2 stars, but the more I write and think about it, the more contemptuous I feel about it.  1 out of 5, sorry.  This was bad.  I feel for Vaughn, who's clearly trying to stretch himself a bit -- it's been at least 15 years since he's played anyone besides just himself.  Wrong vehicle, though.

1678112,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00GEKO51U,FNDNreview,"[2, 6]","For years now, we&#8217;ve seen Vince Vaughn play the role of the charismatic smart aleck.  He was a smooth talking mediator in Wedding Crashers, a bad boyfriend in The Break-Up, and quite possibly the laziest of all athletes in Dodgeball:  A True Underdog Story.  Love him or hate him, he&#8217;s certainly been consistent playing the same old character in his roles.  While he is still highly enjoyable and obviously a gifted entertainer, his flare is no longer enough to sell movie tickets or justify home video purchases.  It was only a matter of time before he starred in one too many roles, all portraying the same tiresome character, before things went stale.  And, even though his newest film, Delivery Man, is an average addition to his resume, it provides more than enough evidence that Vaughn needs to move on to a more challenging genre in acting.Ken Scott writes (with Martin Petit) and directs Delivery Man, a remake of the 2011 Canadian comedy, Starbuck (which was also directed by Scott).  The film stars Vince Vaughn as David Wozniak, a down-on-his-luck character that is basically coasting through life.  Upon meeting David, it&#8217;s quickly pointed out that he&#8217;s not someone that can be heavily relied upon &#8211; for his job, running errands, or providing support for his girlfriend, Emma (Cobie Smulders).  He works for his father&#8217;s meat company, delivering meat to customers &#8211; at least that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s supposed to be doing when he&#8217;s not growing pot in his apartment or ducking debt collectors.Upon returning to his apartment one day, David is paid a visit by a lawyer that informs him that he&#8217;s the father of 533 children, many of whom have petitioned the court to identify their father.  As it turns out, after making many, many donations as sperm donor (under the alias Starbuck), the clinic used his sperm for nearly all of their clients.  The lawyer also gives him a packet with the biographies of each of the children that is named in the pending lawsuit.  Naturally, his best friend and on-again, off-again lawyer, Brett (Chris Pratt) recommends that he not look at the bios &#8211; but does David listen?  Well, it wouldn&#8217;t be much of a movie if he did.Naturally, David takes it upon himself to start following a select few of his children, just to see what they&#8217;re like and learn what they&#8217;ve done with their lives.  Of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be a Vince Vaughn film without a little bit of sports in it, so the first of his children that he visits is an NBA basketball player, named Adam (Dave Patten).  Next up, there&#8217;s Josh (Jack Reynor), a coffee shop employee with aspirations of being an actor.  Then, David acts as a pizza delivery man to visit his daughter, Kristen (Britt Robertson), who turns out to be a troubled drug abuser that recently got a job at a department store.  Finally, there&#8217;s Viggo (Adam Chanler-Berat), who discovers David&#8217;s identity as his father, but simply wants to keep all of his father&#8217;s attention for himself.From there, this film focuses on the court proceeds and the predicament surrounding David paying his debts vs. revealing his identity to his children.  It would be nice to say there&#8217;s more to this story than meets the eye, but sadly there&#8217;s very little substance here.  Like many films these days, if you&#8217;ve seen the movie trailer, you&#8217;ve already received about 90% of the plot, and it shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to imagine how this film turns out.  After all, nine times out of ten a Vince Vaughn film will send you home with a smile on your face, or depending how judgmental you are about him &#8211; a begrudging frown.Obviously, Delivery Man is a comedy, and there are a few brief moments of humor &#8211; but they don&#8217;t come from Vaughn, they come from supporting cast member Chris Pratt.  Sadly, his character spends nearly the whole film preaching to Vaughn&#8217;s character about not doing anything stupid, yet Pratt&#8217;s character eventually commits about the dumbest possible act in the history of lawyering.  The act in question is funny, but would be best described as downright stupid and unbelievable.  To be honest, his lines aren&#8217;t really even that humorous, just silly.  However, for the moviegoers that enjoy tame PG humor as opposed to the unfiltered sex talk that you&#8217;d find in a recent film like We&#8217;re the Millers, Delivery Man will be much more to your liking.Overall, Delivery Man is the definition of an average comedy with more of the same from Vince Vaughn.  He&#8217;s just as entertaining as he was in his previous ten films.  Vaughn has more charisma than possibly anyone else in Hollywood, but he needs to take on a drama or maybe even a horror movie to change things up a bit. While this film does provide a clever concept, the endless array of punch-lines only solidify it as being nothing more than a petty, witless attempt at making a moderately compelling piece of entertainment.  You can only call so many movies &#8220;entertaining&#8221; for so long before you come to the realization this particular statement is just the nicest way you can think of to call a movie boring or uneventful.  Never the less, Vaughn&#8217;s fans should check this out at their leisure, while everyone else should feel free to add it to a list of movies to rent &#8211; eventually.GRADE:

Lane ""professional audience member""","[40, 49]","Maybe I'm a purist... but we soooo loved ""Starbuck,"" the Canadian original of this movie, that we were pretty hostile when we heard about this remake. This time we're in luck. Writer/director Ken Scott (""Starbuck"") used Martin Petit's original screenplay as his source, so we know this beloved script is in good hands, AND they didn't exaggerate or overplay anything as so often happens in American remakes. Whew!Briefly, a young man made over 500 anonymous donations to a sperm bank a couple of decades ago because he was paid for each contribution (wait until you figure out how he used the money). Then, through a technical bungle, his were the only donations used for a year. Now, 142 of his offspring have filed a class action lawsuit to identify their father.Here is the cast:*  Vince Vaughn (""Couples' Retreat"") David really needed the money back when he lived next door to the sperm bank, now he's a delivery man for his father's butcher shop, kinda going nowhere, but happily contented and blithely unaware of that former bungle.* Chris Pratt (""Zero Dark Thirty"") is Brett, our hero's best friend. He washed out of legal practice but wants to defend David and help him maintain his anonymity. Since the news hit the tabloids about that lawsuit, Starbuck has become a punch line!* Cobie Smulders (""Safe Haven"") is Emma, the woman in his life. Now that this cop is pregnant, she is having second thoughts about David's ability to be a good father. She thinks she would be better off going it alone.This has a very, very large cast: we meet David's father and two married brothers, and then, when he takes a peek in the envelope that identifies all the parties to the lawsuit, we meet a number of those offspring. The casting director for this one did a great job!Rated PG-13, we see absolutely no sweaty bodies, hear no gunshots, endure no vehicular mayhem and suffer through no blowie uppie stuff. (See my original review of ""Starbuck"" on JayFlix.net for any other comments.)This film is absurd, heartwarming, funny and great entertainment.

1678138,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00GEKO51U,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Every comedic actor will eventually receive a role that changes the way he or she is perceived by their audience. These roles are typically very different from their past work, and the film itself doesn't necessarily have to be good to show that the role could potentially lead to a lot of growth down the line. I personally can't remember the last time I have ever seen Vince Vaughn give a performance like the one I witnessed in Delivery Man, which is why I think this is one of those roles for him. Unfortunately, the film itself never completely executes on either the comedic or the emotional side of the story, but there is still a lot to love if you decide to give it your time.Vaughn takes on the role of David Wozniak, a delivery man for his father's meat company, and someone who is about to have his life changed forever. As a young adult hurting for money, David donated sperm 693 times over the course of a few years. Unfortunately, there was a mix-up at the sperm bank, and only his sperm was used for a few months, which resulted in him &#34;fathering&#34; 533 children. Today, 142 of them want to know who their father is, and they are taking their case to court because they believe their right to know their father's identity exceeds his right to anonymity.Aside from this highly unlikely situation, the main issue with Delivery Man is the constant absence of information. In addition to having to deal with the 142 children looking for him, David is also being pursued by thugs, to whom he owes $80,000, and his girlfriend, Emma (Cobbie Smulders), is pregnant. Although this debt is a constant area of discussion throughout the film, the viewer never learns why David owes them money, or even who &#34;they&#34; are. The audience is essentially told to accept the fact that it's just another problem in David's life, when really it was just sloppy writing.Then there is Emma, who is nonexistent for majority of the film. The viewer only sees her briefly in the beginning, maybe once or twice about halfway through, and she appears a few times in the final act. To be fair, Emma is worried about whether or not she wants David to be a part of the baby's life because he is kind of failing at his own, but she never seemed to care about any of that the few times we see them together. Honestly, the worst part about this scenario is that Cobbie is criminally underused. Her work on How I Met Your Mother shows that she can make you laugh, but Emma felt like more of an afterthought, which didn't allow Cobbie any time to truly shine.That's not to say that Delivery Man is deprived of comedic material, however. It just seems like it was reserved more for the male performers, and as a whole it kind of took a back seat to the more emotional side of the story. Although Vaughn may be the big name in this one, he only had a few laugh out loud moments throughout the entire film. Instead, it was Chris Pratt who delivered a majority of the laughs. Pratt plays Brett, David's friend and lawyer. He has yet to really prove himself as a legitimate lawyer, and he is also the father of four children, which is why he insists on helping David with this case.I think the main reason Pratt was so enjoyable is because all of his lines felt natural and authentic. There was never a moment where he stuttered out of character, and the scene where we meet Brett is arguably one of the funniest moments in the movie, which brings me to my next point: he works extremely well with Vaughn. Whether they were providing laughs or having a serious moment about the case, the two of them bounced off of each other in a way that resembled genuine friendship. I've only seen Pratt in a few roles, but he has a long career ahead of him if he can get himself in a starring position.All of this is only half of the experience, though, because Delivery Man is constantly trying to make you connect emotionally. Unfortunately, as previously stated, it fails to do so more than it succeeds. Don't get me wrong, there are numerous scenes that are very sweet, and even a little heartwarming, but their emotional impact is lessened by the pace in which we move from child to child. David attempts to get a glance at as many of these children as possible, and maybe even provide some assistance, even if it is something minor like taking out the trash, but a few seconds here and there don't allow you enough time to really care about any of them.Overall Score: 6.9/10 - Delivery Man probably won't be considered one of Vaugn's best, but there is something to be said about his ability as an actor after watching this film. His comedic side is kept on a leash for majority of the film's running time, and seeing Vaughn be stoic and introspective was a surprisingly nice change of pace. In addition, Pratt provided a lot of laughs, and whenever we got to see David interact with a child for more than a few seconds it always managed to put a smile on my face. Although it may be littered with flaws, I would still recommend a viewing just to see Vaughn step out of his comfort zone.",3,"6.9/10 - Vaughn is surprisingly tender, but the script needs

I really enjoyed Delivery Man, although I have never been a huge fan of Vince Vaughn and I acknowledge some gaping holes in its plausibility (mostly related to the apparent absence of any of the 500 plus offsprings' parents other than David Wozniak, and a complete failure to acknowledge that something other than David's DNA made these kids what they are).  No matter how many faults he has (and David has many lapses of judgment) he learned from his father (and presumably his mother) one of the essentials of parenting - to see the positive in your children.For many years I have had a book called ""Onions in the Stew"" by Betty MacDonald.  It was an autobiographical story that included an anecdote from a friend who said something to the effect that the secret of dealing with children was to look for something positive to say, even if it was only to compliment them on their neatly tied shoes (I think another part of this secret involved the consumption of alcohol, but that's neither here nor there).  Try it, it does work.Many funny scenes ensue when David begins to make contact with his children (the sport parent behavior at the NBA game was one of the best I thought - ""why aren't they putting him in?"" is a classic).Bottom line, the movie is at the very least a reminder about the possibilities in all of us and the importance of the parent who is willing to look for and nurture them.  The pride of a parent who can see skills and abilities in their child that they themselves lack (and I am not talking about basketball here) is also a beautiful thing to see and I thought that this was actually very well expressed by not only David Wozniak but by his own father.",4,Learning from dad,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,1739,"['watched', 'plane', 'do', 'most', 'movies', 'more', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Delivery', 'Man', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'acknowledge', 'gaping', 'holes', 'plausibility', 'mostly', 'related', 'apparent', 'absence', '500', 'offsprings', 'parents', 'other', 'David', 'Wozniak', 'complete', 'failure', 'acknowledge', 'something', 'other', 'David', 'DNA', 'made', 'kids', 'what', 'are', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'faults', 'David', 'many', 'lapses', 'judgment', 'learned', 'father', 'presumably', 'mother', 'one', 'essentials', 'parenting', 'see', 'positive', 'children.For', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'had', 'book', 'called', 'Onions', 'Stew', 'Betty', 'MacDonald', 'was', 'autobiographical', 'story', 'included', 'anecdote', 'friend', 'who', 'said', 'something', 'effect', 'secret', 'dealing', 'children', 'was', 'look', 'something', 'positive', 'say', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'compliment', 'neatly', 'tied', 'shoes', 'think', 'part', 'secret', 'involved', 'consumption', 'alcohol', 'here', 'there', 'Try', 'work.Many', 'funny', 'scenes', 'ensue', 'when', 'David', 'make', 'contact', 'children', 'sport', 'parent', 'behavior', 'NBA', 'game', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'thought', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'putting', 'classic', '.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'very', 'least', 'reminder', 'possibilities', 'importance', 'parent', 'who', 'willing', 'look', 'nurture', 'pride', 'parent', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'skills', 'abilities', 'child', 'lack', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'basketball', 'here', 'also', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'see', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'expressed', 'not', 'only', 'David', 'Wozniak', 'own', 'father']",Delivery Man

The plot follows David (Vince Vaughn) who delivers meat to businesses; his struggle is having a stable family for himself. His girlfriend has is pregnant but does not let him be the father. David then finds out there are 533 children who are his biological children due to his past donations to a donor bank. He decides to visit each of the children to see where they are now. But these children are not kids; they are all in their late teens. He decides to make a meeting date where all 533 children can come visit each other. He creates the name Starbuck as the name of the mystery father. These children then demand to know who their father is but the law of the court denies the release of father. The ending is bitter sweet, thus you have to watch this movie.The moral of the story is to keep close people closer to you because they might help you. During the movie there are many scenes devoted to show what condition each child is presently enduring. From a musician to a beauty stylist all the children have different careers which are so important on effecting David&#8217;s emotional connection to each child. One child keeps David continuously visiting, the child with special needs. The child is in a care center and has no one visit until David comes. During the movie, David and special needs child create a family sense and warmth. This part of the movie stuck with me and really pulled my heart strings.Overall the movie emphasizes on the importance of family. Furthermore, it also gives the audience the message of caring for other people you might not know. The comedy is apparent in this movie, but the jokes were a bit for adults. I rate this age range from 13 and above, due to the story and the adult jokes. I give this movie 4 star out of 5 because of the strong themes but awkward adult humor.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST!

A man donates sperm over 600 times in the span of 33 months, and because of limited supplies at the sperm bank and the potency of his semen, he ends up fathering a total of 533 kids.  If that wasn&#8217;t enough, a class action suit is filed on behalf of around 142 of his children who would like to know the identity of their father.  Presented with the identities of 142 of his children, Vince Vaughn&#8217;s character sets out on a mission to get to know his children a little bit, all the while not revealing his true identity.  Some parts were funny, some were series, but none of them were even remotely believable.

Nothing to brag about to the choir but Vince Vaughn's performance as an estranged and enthusiastic man (David Wozniak) in the American remake of the film, Starbuck or Delivery Man, is what keeps the film going.Some of the things that made a draw for me over the overhyped, overrated, and annoying Hunger Games: Catching Fire was Delivery Man's closeness (as rumoured by Ken Scott, the director behind the original and this remake) to the original, Vaughn being a funny stand-alone comedian even without a posse or Owen Wilson, and the idea that I would get some of the American jokes better than the exclusively French-Canadian/Quebecois ones.Nevertheless, it is the story of practically a schmuck and loner who wants to lend a helping hand and his persona captures it well and good performances all round from the encounters Wozniak meets. However, the film does suffers on the corners a bit by starting off too suddenly with the biological father of 533 children case with the mysterious intruder and the pregnant wife toward the end (as I do not support or believe in marriage or childbearing when you know the world is overpopulated and the divorce rate is 50%+). It felt encouraging to know the similarity paved for its remake (which are forms of filmmaking I have hang-ups about) and how the sperm donor concept would work out for comedy without it being a raunchfest (a la Hangover).I wish there would be more of Vince Vaughn's crazy antics and humour present here but this film is commendable and believable enough in a way like he was in The Internship, a pretty good high-concept comedy that was lambasted and mocked by antics unfortuntately. While the film is fine and watchable from the start, it does suffer from things that are personal and possibly the whole idealism element and happy ending did not give it the edge it needed given Vaughn's persona.Still, considering how much Catching Fire will fill up the auditoriums, why not pay $10.50 to go see Delivery Man (or see the original on Netflix) or even Philomena, another comedy-drama of epic proportions, instead.""",3,"Don't let the ""remake"" word fool you.
