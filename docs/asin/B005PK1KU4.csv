1497051,AS2OYX8PB544P,B005PK1KU4,Cesar A. Fernandez,"[2, 14]","The African American community has a lot to offer the world of arts and entertainment, but someone please tell me why most independent African American media releases have such cheaply made cover art? One may argue that there isn't enough budget, and that the piece can speak for itself, but I disagree. I know people who use Photoshop as a HOBBY and can produce better, more professional looking images. The picture of Michelle Williams is actually from the cover of her album ""Unexpected"". You're telling me they couldn't take a few snapshots specifically for this play's promotion? That font has been used in every horror/thriller movie in the last twenty years, and that background looks like something out of the 90's. If you're going to put your play out on DVD, take the time to hire (or find cheaply, IT CAN BE DONE) someone who can represent your work in a polished, up-to-standards way. I have not seen the play, so my review is in no way a reflection of the actual work, but appearance is everything, so if they want people to buy this (seemingly overpriced) DVD, at least make it look like it's worth $20 and not some bootleg at the corner store. If they didn't put any time or money into the DVD cover, I can only imagine how amateur the quality of this filming and editing must be. I wanted to buy this, but now I'm going to have to think it over. I DO NOT want to pay twenty dollars for something that is not up to our technical standards of 2011. The gay community puts out a lot of low-budget, independent work, but it seems that they are more likely to make the best use of their budget rather than let it hinder them. David E. Talbert needs to start making sure that his work is more properly represented, because no one will take him seriously if he keeps this up.",2,What is with the DVD cover?!,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,1784,"['African', 'American', 'community', 'lot', 'offer', 'world', 'arts', 'entertainment', 'someone', 'please', 'tell', 'why', 'most', 'independent', 'African', 'American', 'media', 'releases', 'have', 'such', 'cheaply', 'made', 'cover', 'art', 'One', 'may', 'argue', ""n't"", 'enough', 'budget', 'piece', 'can', 'speak', 'disagree', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'use', 'Photoshop', 'HOBBY', 'can', 'produce', 'better', 'more', 'professional', 'looking', 'images', 'picture', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'actually', 'cover', 'album', 'Unexpected', ""'re"", 'telling', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'few', 'snapshots', 'specifically', 'play', 'promotion', 'font', 'been', 'used', 'horror/thriller', 'movie', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'background', 'something', '90', ""'re"", 'going', 'put', 'play', 'out', 'DVD', 'take', 'time', 'hire', 'find', 'cheaply', 'IT', 'CAN', 'BE', 'DONE', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'represent', 'work', 'polished', 'up-to-standards', 'way', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'play', 'review', 'way', 'reflection', 'actual', 'work', 'appearance', 'everything', 'so', 'want', 'people', 'buy', 'seemingly', 'overpriced', 'DVD', 'least', 'make', 'look', 'worth', '20', 'not', 'bootleg', 'corner', 'store', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'time', 'money', 'DVD', 'cover', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'amateur', 'quality', 'filming', 'editing', 'must', 'be', 'wanted', 'buy', 'now', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'think', 'DO', 'NOT', 'want', 'pay', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'something', 'not', 'up', 'technical', 'standards', '2011', 'gay', 'community', 'out', 'lot', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'work', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'make', 'best', 'use', 'budget', 'rather', 'let', 'hinder', 'David', 'E.', 'Talbert', 'start', 'making', 'sure', 'work', 'more', 'properly', 'represented', 'one', 'will', 'take', 'seriously', 'up']",David E.

1497052,A3LXAXRICA0XW6,B005PK1KU4,~Chase,"[2, 2]","I of course have seen all of Tyler Perry's plays and absolutely love them, I stumbled across ""Love in the Nick of Tyme"" and watched it one evening and really enjoyed it. This play had just been released as well so I decided to grab it. This play is really good. I enjoyed the story of it and the twists that Talbert displays at the end. Of the 2 plays I have seen of him, they both were romance or marriage related. So I'm assuming that is his favorite genre.Video quality on this was really good, I really really enjoyed the amount of detail on the stage play, and the lighting, and camera scenes that was used. The DVD layout is really nice and fancy as well.The singing in here is pretty awful in my opinion. It's more of a sound issue to me than a actor issue. The sound just isn't there, the music drowns out the person to me, and I can't feel the song as much as you should be able to. Maybe they needed background singers or something. But Michelle Williams voice is just way to chipmunkish for me. I LOVED HER SONG, but just not her singing it. Character Moody was not as funny as he should have been, when you see the character it just makes you laugh so hard, but thats about the only laugh you will get from him. My last small complaint is that there is SO MUCH SEXUAL INNUENDO. Like cmon, it's funny and cool at first, but it just never ends. I'm not even a church going person, but cmon talbert, grow up some. (Actor jacking off a shotgun to imitate masturbation....)Anyway, Love in the Nick of Tyme is alot better IMO, I can still say I will check out some more Talbert plays in the future, and some of his old ones that I have not seen. At 20 years in doing this, he may have fell off with his primes being some of the older plays, So i'll check them out first.",4,Great Play to a newcomer of Talbert Plays,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1776,"['course', 'have', 'seen', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'plays', 'absolutely', 'love', 'stumbled', 'Love', 'Nick', 'Tyme', 'watched', 'one', 'evening', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'play', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'as', 'well', 'decided', 'grab', 'play', 'really', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'twists', 'Talbert', 'end', '2', 'plays', 'have', 'seen', 'were', 'romance', 'marriage', 'related', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'favorite', 'genre.Video', 'quality', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'really', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'amount', 'detail', 'stage', 'play', 'lighting', 'camera', 'scenes', 'was', 'used', 'DVD', 'layout', 'really', 'nice', 'fancy', 'well.The', 'singing', 'here', 'pretty', 'awful', 'opinion', 'more', 'sound', 'issue', 'actor', 'issue', 'sound', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'music', 'out', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'song', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'Maybe', 'needed', 'background', 'singers', 'something', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'voice', 'just', 'way', 'chipmunkish', 'LOVED', 'SONG', 'just', 'not', 'singing', 'Character', 'Moody', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'see', 'character', 'just', 'so', 'hard', 'thats', 'only', 'laugh', 'will', 'get', 'last', 'small', 'complaint', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'SEXUAL', 'INNUENDO', 'cmon', 'funny', 'cool', 'first', 'just', 'never', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'church', 'going', 'person', 'cmon', 'talbert', 'grow', 'up', 'Actor', 'jacking', 'off', 'shotgun', 'imitate', 'masturbation', 'Anyway', 'Love', 'Nick', 'Tyme', 'alot', 'better', 'IMO', 'can', 'still', 'say', 'will', 'check', 'out', 'more', 'Talbert', 'plays', 'future', 'old', 'ones', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '20', 'years', 'doing', 'may', 'have', 'fell', 'off', 'primes', 'being', 'older', 'plays', 'So', 'i', ""'ll"", 'check', 'out', 'first']",David E.

So we are so happy that we ordered this movie.. This was so good! We own several of David E Talbert's other plays which we love..So now we really can not wait until we receive this play in the mail as we want to watch this over again. The plot was so awesome and so was the singing and acting.. We could not get enough of this play..Well if you don't purchase this one, you will miss out.. This play was made and performed with such excellence.Waiting on our's in the mail!******Update******12/21/2011Whew we have watched this play over so many times! That I had to come back and make an update... We are so enjoying the quality of this play. I love the message, the acting, the scenes and as far as the singing goes, I can not complain. I think Michelle Williams did as well as she was going to do. Maybe acting is more of her talent (All I know is that the song make me your number one, I would love to have that song on an album with Michelle Williams as the artist of the song. That song was so awesome and she did an excellence job!).Over all, if you miss this play just because of the singing, you will miss out on the message, and the talent of David E Talbert. This will make a great gift, I wish that I would have ordered more.. But now I have a great gift idea, along with a great movie night for couples and just a girls movie night.The emotions in this play are so reality, and I love the way that this play delivers the wisdom of the elders... Whew! This play even has some suspense in it and twist and flips.... The humor is also great.. For some good family entertainment, you can not ask for more.. I did not want the play to end!We support this play and will continue to support his work..The behind the scenes bonus features is also awesome and worth viewing. For me this play was and is reality... How often do you see beautiful African American couples successful and playing roles that are not full of violence... And as far as Moody... Whew bring it on... Keep Moody in the plays, We would love to see him and this whole cast in a sequel or just another subject matter with this very talented cast. Ann Nesby.. Whew....... How can anyone say anything negative about this play with all this great talent! Keep up the excellence that you so bring in all of your plays!We now have all of his books and all of his plays except for the ones that have not been released. Keep up the great work and thanks for providing good family entertainment! Keep them coming!Just in time for the holidays or anytime! So happy we placed this order! So much talent! Watch this with your husband and watch the forgiveness, temptation, strife, lessons, the time not spent at home, and the redemption, the storms of relationships.. this is reality... look at the divorce rate in the African American community we marry less but have the highest divorce rate.. (something to think about).....The grass is not greener on the other side... as it has to be mowed and trimmed just as well and it also is dormant during seasons and it withers, so if you want some powerful lessons, great music... This is for you! i mean the music has Brent Jones how could you not like what Brent Jones puts out...and many more music talents!This play is great food for thought, I would love to see this as a movie!Now back to more watching over and over, roll on the floor laughs, and inspiration!Enjoy! We sure are.. Sing Ann Nesby! Michelle Williams! Amen Clifton Powell! Whew!********6/9/2012****updateWe are still watching this and it is still funny, roll on the floor laughs, and entertaining! We have shared this play with our family and they love it as well.. We can not wait on the soundtrack to this play to come out!Moody is still funny even several months later from when we first saw this play..If you have not purchased this play, you are missing out.update 12/26/2012! Still watching! And yes this play is still that great! If you have not seen this play you are missing out! Everyone that I have told about this play loves this play and people who know about this play love this play! I have and can watch this over and over and over it really is that great!

Don't want to give too much of the story line away in this review, but overall a good watch.

My favorite character was Mr. Wilkinson.  He was downright hilarious.Now the guy who Michelle cheated with in the play was rather weird.  I usually like Brian White but I did not care for his performance in this play at all.  They actually made Brian look so pathetic.Other than that, the play was okay and had a good storyline and there were a lot of funny parts to enjoy amongst the cast such as the husband (Clifton Davis) in his reference to Brian's plumbing and him trying to find a woman.  Michelle's mother and Mr. Wilkinson and Michelle's friend.  But Brian's parts ruined it for me.The play was enjoyable and would be nice to keep in your collection.",3,Funny,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,798,"['Overall', 'play', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'great', 'casting', 'really', 'did', 'Michelle', 'performance', 'Everyone', 'played', 'part', 'pretty', 'good', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Wilkinson', 'was', 'downright', 'guy', 'who', 'Michelle', 'cheated', 'play', 'was', 'rather', 'weird', 'usually', 'Brian', 'White', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'performance', 'play', 'actually', 'made', 'Brian', 'look', 'so', 'pathetic.Other', 'play', 'was', 'okay', 'had', 'good', 'storyline', 'were', 'lot', 'funny', 'parts', 'enjoy', 'cast', 'such', 'husband', 'Clifton', 'Davis', 'reference', 'Brian', 'plumbing', 'trying', 'find', 'woman', 'Michelle', 'mother', 'Mr.', 'Wilkinson', 'Michelle', 'friend', 'Brian', 'parts', 'ruined', 'me.The', 'play', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'keep', 'collection']",David E.
