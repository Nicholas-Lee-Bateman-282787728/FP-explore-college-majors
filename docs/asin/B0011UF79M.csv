1132685,A2M6LX7CGZIED1,B0011UF79M,"Elizabeth K. ""Elizabeth""","[11, 12]","First of all, let me reiterate that Murder She wrote is my favorite TV series. As I have said in past reviews, the show defied Hollywood Standards by creating a heroine ( Jessica Fletcher) over 50. The character has incredible depth, and is incredibly well written and perfectly performed by Angela Lansbury. The character is inspirational for everyone, showing how a widow has a second chance at life after having lost her husband.Nonetheless, Seasons 1-7 are MUCH better than 8. If you are a fan of the series and have seen 1-7, you'll notice how 8 has been revamped with a more Miami Vice feel; the music has been sexed up a bit ( they go back to how it was done in previous series come season 9, which is available on Netflix). The writing is also much weaker, save one or two strong episodes ( of course, the Cabot Cove ones!).Then, Angela's character moves to New york for a good part of the series, and while in previous series the New York episodes were very strong, they were weak in 8. It was really a let down. But possibly the worst part was that the character ( Jessica Fletcher) had a different, much more metropolitan feel.See, what makes this TV show is how Lansbury's character is so complex, as she is a small town woman who is highly educated but doesn't let the pomp and circumstance of the glitzy literary world change her spirit. That's what makes the show: how genuine and compassionate the lead character is.But in 8, it's different.Season 9 ( which again you can get on Netflix) they return to the 'old fashioned' music and traditional style of writing; nonetheless, 1-7 reign supreme.If you are looking for an inspirational, well-written and groundbreaking show, Murder She Wrote ( with all its fantastic characters and guest stars) is for you!!",3,"Murder she wrote is the best TV show ever, but season 8 is not as strong as the previous series ( 1-7)",1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,1771,"['First', 'let', 'reiterate', 'Murder', 'wrote', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'said', 'past', 'reviews', 'show', 'defied', 'Hollywood', 'Standards', 'creating', 'heroine', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', '50', 'character', 'incredible', 'depth', 'incredibly', 'well', 'written', 'perfectly', 'performed', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'character', 'inspirational', 'everyone', 'showing', 'how', 'widow', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'having', 'lost', 'husband.Nonetheless', 'Seasons', '1-7', 'are', 'MUCH', 'better', '8', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'have', 'seen', '1-7', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'how', '8', 'been', 'revamped', 'more', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'feel', 'music', 'been', 'sexed', 'up', 'bit', 'go', 'back', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'previous', 'series', 'come', 'season', '9', 'available', 'Netflix', 'writing', 'also', 'much', 'weaker', 'save', 'one', 'two', 'strong', 'episodes', 'course', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'ones', '.Then', 'Angela', 'character', 'moves', 'New', 'york', 'good', 'part', 'series', 'previous', 'series', 'New', 'York', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'strong', 'were', 'weak', '8', 'was', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'possibly', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'character', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'had', 'different', 'much', 'more', 'metropolitan', 'feel.See', 'what', 'TV', 'show', 'how', 'Lansbury', 'character', 'so', 'complex', 'small', 'town', 'woman', 'who', 'highly', 'educated', ""n't"", 'let', 'pomp', 'circumstance', 'glitzy', 'literary', 'world', 'change', 'spirit', 'what', 'show', 'how', 'genuine', 'compassionate', 'lead', 'character', 'is.But', '8', 'different.Season', '9', 'again', 'can', 'get', 'Netflix', 'return', ""'old"", 'fashioned', 'music', 'traditional', 'style', 'writing', 'nonetheless', '1-7', 'reign', 'supreme.If', 'are', 'looking', 'inspirational', 'well-written', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'guest', 'stars']",N/A

Murder She Wrote has always reminded me of Agatha Christie's Miss Marpel.  Maybe not as cunning as Miss Marpel but just as enjoyable and fun! Season Eight is no exception! It doesn't disappoint. Angela Lansbury brings J.B. Fletcher to life giving her not only strong intelligence but a motherly quality that few who come in contact with can resist. I have throughly enjoyed season 8 and highly recommend it to anyone who loves a mystery.",5,"Murder She Wrote, a Good Choice",1209081600,"04 25, 2008",2008,522,"['have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Mystery', 'stories', 'Such', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'always', 'reminded', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Miss', 'Marpel', 'Maybe', 'not', 'as', 'cunning', 'Miss', 'Marpel', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'fun', 'Season', 'Eight', 'exception', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'J.B.', 'Fletcher', 'life', 'giving', 'not', 'only', 'strong', 'intelligence', 'motherly', 'quality', 'few', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'can', 'resist', 'have', 'throughly', 'enjoyed', 'season', '8', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'mystery']",N/A

What I find is so funny is that when she is back in Cabot Cove she has the typewriter/xcomputer in the kitchen on the kitchen table rather than ona comuter Desk and she lives in a big house and when she is in New York she has a computer Desk  and a kitchen table and uses the table as a table where is the computer when in Cabot Cove and she is entertaining.

CSI in the various incarnations may be accurate, and delve into the how and why people died, but the joy can be quickly lost.TV viewers reveled in Murder She Wrote from 1984 to 1996, and again in TV movies up to 2003 (the Celtic Cross).  Her portrayal of a mild mystery novelist with a flair for solving murders caught on from the first episode. The 8th season includes Jessica moving to New York City (in Bite the Apple) to take a teaching position and expands her backyard of influence.  Gone are the bike rides and stable cast from the previous years, but her travels to Hollywood in ""Incident in Lot 7"", to Europe to promote her books, to Mexico for research (""Day of the Dead"") and back to Cabot Cover for another mystery turned this series into a true international favorite.The 22 episodes included keep you thinking....""I know, Jessica will find out"", just like an hour of low key entertainment should.Long live Murder She Wrote.Tim Lasiuta",5,Queen Jessica the 8th!,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,1078,"['Murder', 'Wrote', 'BestJessica', 'Fletcher', 'always', 'welcome', 'break', 'real', 'life', 'crime', 'investigations', 'see', 'TV', 'today', 'CSI', 'various', 'incarnations', 'may', 'be', 'accurate', 'delve', 'how', 'why', 'people', 'died', 'joy', 'can', 'be', 'quickly', 'lost.TV', 'viewers', 'reveled', 'Murder', 'Wrote', '1984', '1996', 'again', 'TV', 'movies', '2003', 'Celtic', 'Cross', 'portrayal', 'mild', 'mystery', 'novelist', 'flair', 'solving', 'murders', 'caught', 'first', 'episode', '8th', 'season', 'Jessica', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Bite', 'Apple', 'take', 'teaching', 'position', 'backyard', 'influence', 'Gone', 'are', 'bike', 'rides', 'stable', 'cast', 'previous', 'years', 'travels', 'Hollywood', 'Incident', 'Lot', '7', 'Europe', 'promote', 'books', 'Mexico', 'research', 'Day', 'Dead', 'back', 'Cabot', 'Cover', 'mystery', 'turned', 'series', 'true', 'international', 'favorite.The', '22', 'episodes', 'included', 'keep', 'thinking', 'know', 'Jessica', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'hour', 'low', 'key', 'entertainment', 'should.Long', 'live', 'Murder', 'Wrote.Tim', 'Lasiuta']",N/A

1132711,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0011UF79M,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","I have been a faithful fan of Murder She Wrote, and of Angela Lansbury for a couple of decades now. Every season offers a wonderful collection of interesting plots, credible acting by the cast and interesting choice of locales, be it in Cabot Cove, Maine [J.B. Fletcher's hometown] or other places. In Season 8, Ms Fletcher makes a move to New York, where she feels she will be better able to stay in touch with her publisher, as well as teach a class in criminology to college students. This is also the season where Ms Fletcher finally gives in to the superiority [or should I say the convenience] of modern technology and gets a personal computer to help her in getting her writing done.The stories remain fresh - one of the strengths of this series. Though it seems remarkable that Ms Fletcher's character always seems to be unwittingly embroiled in murders, espionage, etc - Ms Lansbury's amazing screen presence and credible acting make it all believable. There are some recurring co-stars as well - Dr Seth Hazlitt, Sheriff Mort Metzger, and even MI6 agent Michael Haggerty. The guest stars also add a lot to enhance the storylines - such as David Soul [of Starsky and Hutch fame], the guy who played Highlander etc.All in all, I love all the seasons of MSW, and Season 8 is as enjoyable as the previous seasons. It is fun, entertaining, and intriguing. Hope to see Season 9 out on DVD soon. All hail J.B.
