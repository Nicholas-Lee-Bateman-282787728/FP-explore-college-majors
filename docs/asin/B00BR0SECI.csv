The stories are not particularly good - though there were a few exceptions. Too many shows concern fighting against idians. Cheyenne is supposed to live among indians (cheyennes, obviously), but in every second show we see him killing them. There are some very noble indians, though, but usually they are renegades from reservations. Reservations were terrible places, so it is just natural that they escaped and fiought. I find myself hoping that indians will win, but always are disappointed. This series is also very studio-bound and it shows. It begins to bother though it was not uncommon in those days.
