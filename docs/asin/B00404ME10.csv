1378799,A3CSCNUKKKTK6G,B00404ME10,Cameron Chase,"[1, 3]","Orny Adams was a struggling comedian who made an appearance in the 2002 documentary ""Comedian"" that centered on Jerry Seinfeld's return to standup comedy.  At that time, Orny was hungry, poor, cocky, insecure, neurotic and just getting discovered.  His performance was promising but uneven.  In the special features of that film, he left the East Coast and became a faceless comedy writer in Los Angeles.  It is a wonderful bookend to see him reemerge as a standup comedian - but this time his performance is tighter, the pacing is impeccable, his delivery is edgy and his comfort on the stage is palpable.  At one point in his performance, he flubs one of his lines - multiple times - and laughs it off and turns it into a joke.  Physically, he looks better than he did in 2002, which should be of some comfort to those of us fearing the encroaching years.  His observations are timely on everything from fat kids to store receipts, cat food and citing the 3rd Amendment. The 3rd Amendment?  After watching this film, I actually practiced the line: ""You're infringing on my Third Amendment rights."" Don't be a nerd and google it. Just watch the video.",4,"A solid, entertaining performance",1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,1152,"['Orny', 'Adams', 'was', 'struggling', 'comedian', 'who', 'made', 'appearance', '2002', 'documentary', 'Comedian', 'centered', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'return', 'standup', 'comedy', 'time', 'Orny', 'was', 'hungry', 'poor', 'cocky', 'insecure', 'neurotic', 'just', 'getting', 'discovered', 'performance', 'was', 'promising', 'uneven', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'left', 'East', 'Coast', 'became', 'faceless', 'comedy', 'writer', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'wonderful', 'bookend', 'see', 'reemerge', 'standup', 'comedian', 'time', 'performance', 'tighter', 'pacing', 'impeccable', 'delivery', 'edgy', 'comfort', 'stage', 'palpable', 'one', 'point', 'performance', 'flubs', 'one', 'lines', 'multiple', 'times', 'off', 'joke', 'Physically', 'better', 'did', '2002', 'should', 'be', 'comfort', 'fearing', 'encroaching', 'years', 'observations', 'are', 'timely', 'everything', 'fat', 'kids', 'store', 'receipts', 'cat', 'food', 'citing', '3rd', 'Amendment', '3rd', 'Amendment', 'watching', 'film', 'actually', 'practiced', 'line', ""'re"", 'infringing', 'Third', 'Amendment', 'rights', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'nerd', 'google', 'Just', 'watch', 'video']",Orny Adams: Takes the Third

But it picked up.  It was more than funny enough, so I kept going.  His delivery is perfect.  His material is great.  His originality might get 4 out of 5, but he is truly a master of the craft.  Overall, he deserves a 5 out of 5.
