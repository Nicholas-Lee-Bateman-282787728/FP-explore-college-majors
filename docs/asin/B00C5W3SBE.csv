I am now wowed by movies that are special but with much smaller armies listed in the credits and with subtle special effects.  This movie has lots of digital sequences, and has several armies in the credits.  I have to say they are well executed.  They are not surprising, but they are fun.  The movie is enjoyable.I have struggled to determine what I consider to be missing.  I think it is that, ultimately, this is a story based on the imagination of L. Frank Baum.  It certainly captures Baum's imagery and story, and it does so with Baum's evident desire to ""soften"" violence.  That it does this by softening any moral is the problem.  What does the Wizard really learn?  What about the witches?  What does any of the characters learn?  There are probably as many opinions as there are viewers.So, viewing the movie is fun, enjoyable, and in keeping with what modern critics of L. Frank Baum think.But, critics have never understood Mr. Baum.  I will say this: he could deliver dead-on sarcastic wit with such kindness and in so few words, most people miss his point entirely.

Acting is mediocre at best, and the plot is silly and very thin. In my opinion small children will love some of the fantasy characters, but some of the bad guy monsters may be too intense and menacing for little kids. One of the good guys, the monkey character, has a very odd, almost threatening face, although his behavior is always good. What could have been the saving grace for this film in terms of its value for parents watching it with their kids, never got off the ground. This was the introduction of the porcelain, miniature china doll character. This sequence started with a beautiful, heart-warming scene, but it fizzled out within five minutes, much to the dismay of all of us watching the film. The writers and directors could have done more with this porcelain china doll character but instead simply relegated her to the background as the story continued. When she initially appeared it seemed that she would be the embodiment of love, care, innocence, human warmth, and protection of the little ones, but, sadly, it never came to be.

1641861,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00C5W3SBE,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 6]","When you sit back and think about it, making &#8216;Oz the Great and Powerful&#8217; was not only a really risky move, but a rather stupid one.  First of all, &#8216;The Wizard of Oz&#8217; is one of the most beloved films OF ALL TIME.  It is probably the most famous, popular and well known film ever made and has legions of fans of all ages.  It is reference possibly more than any other film, quoted more than any other film and immortalized throughout the years in the hearts and in the mind&#8217;s eye of many, many, many people.  Latching yourself to any resemblance of the film is cause for instant and unavoidable scrutiny.  But then you have another factor, the &#8216;Wicked&#8217; factor.  While &#8216;The Wizard of Oz&#8217; is beloved by film buffs, &#8216;Wicked&#8217; is beloved by the theater crowd, and the film buffs have been salivating at the mouth for YEARS waiting for &#8216;Wicked&#8217; to come to the big screen.  Cinephiles have pondered who would star in the film, how they could film it, who would get the big musical numbers, and quite frankly we can all agree that the story development in &#8216;Wicked&#8217; trumps &#8216;The Wizard of Oz&#8217; and so taking it on could result in something unforgettable.Why on earth would you decide to make an &#8216;Oz&#8217; movie and NOT make that movie &#8216;Wicked&#8217;?I was skeptical from the moment I saw James Franco was cast in this, since he&#8217;s become one of those actors I have no time for anymore.  I love how he started his career as this degrading presence most film lovers tried to avoid only to have his status shift during the 2008-2010 years when he latched onto better directors and for a brief moment we thought we had a real talent on our hands, and now he&#8217;s turned into this pretentious slab of annoying that we all wish would just go away.And yes, I thought he was brilliant in &#8216;Spring Breakers&#8217;.With &#8216;Oz the Great and Powerful&#8217;, I was ready for a disaster.  I think what makes this particular disaster so upsetting though is that the opening sequence is so magically perfect that I started to get my hopes up.  Sadly, the minute that the film gains color and thrusts us into Oz the film falls apart faster than the tickets sold to Justin Timberlake&#8217;s last tour.  You could liken this to Burton&#8217;s disastrous &#8216;Alice in Wonderland&#8217;, and the comparison would be obvious and understandable, but I&#8217;m almost tempted to say that &#8216;Alice&#8217; was a better film.  I mean, &#8216;Alice in Wonderland&#8217; is already kind of a camp classic and one that lends itself to interpretation.  What Raimi and company do here though is completely desecrate a classic that shouldn&#8217;t have been so poorly deconstructed.  It&#8217;s almost offensive how much they&#8217;ve twisted the original story and stomped all over what could have been perfect.THIS STORY HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN!  WHY REWRITE IT?!?!While I can fault it forever for NOT being &#8216;Wicked&#8217;, I should try and look at it for what it is, which is the story of the wizard himself.  But really, is it?  I mean, the film seems very uninterested with that particular character, making him nothing more than a self-centered and arrogant idiot who has a strange tinge of redemption in the finale (which felt ripped from &#8216;Inglourious Basterds&#8217;) and was made completely forgettable (and nearly loathsome) thanks to Franco&#8217;s ridiculous performance (which was all sorts of perfect theatrics in the opening sequence but lost all manipulative charm once the film actually started).  No, this is really the story of the witches, which is why I fault it for NOT being &#8216;Wicked&#8217;.  The main focus here is on a hammy Rachel Weisz, and out of her depth Mila Kunis and a &#8216;dead behind the eyes&#8217; Michelle Williams (I love Williams as an actress, but this was Razzy worthy).This retelling of the story we already know has become a joke, and one that isn&#8217;t fun to laugh at.Like &#8216;Alice in Wonderland&#8217; before it, this is technically uneven as well.  Many of the special effects and production design elements are admirable and even really, really good and yet so many of them are also so overproduced that they appear inauthentic and ugly.  Emerald City is a dazzling delight, until you walk inside a building and that fake green color coats the walls and looks trashy.

1641872,A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL,B00C5W3SBE,"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman""","[3, 7]","Oz fans: how well do you remember the thrilling world of the original 1939 film?  Was your favorite part the amazingly realized world of L. Frank Baum's novel, done entirely without CGI?  Perhaps it was the gentle, subtle, Carroll-like satire it had?  Or maybe Judy Garland's career-defining performance as Dorothy?  How would you see all of that come together again in a new Oz film?  Assuming you answered ""Heck, yeah!"", the good news is that Oz: The Great and Powerful has all of that.  The bad news is that it contains a significantly smaller dose of each.To its credit, the film is not a thin parody of the classic it was based on.  Many reboots of beloved films often take on a slightly cynical bent, paying lip service to their inspiration, but also putting on a thinly-veiled mockery of it.  ""Isn't it cute how innocent and earnest these old movies used to be?"", they seem to ask.  Director Sam Raimi (The Spiderman Trilogy) thankfully avoids this entirely - the new Oz is clearly in love with the old.  This is seen no clearer than in the opening ten minutes - the film begins in black-and-white in a 4:3 aspect ratio, before becoming a fully colored fullscreen when the story reaches Oz.  Not only does this mirror the first film, but it also acts as an effective homage to Hollywood's golden age.We're quickly introduced to our hero, Oscar ""My friends call me Oz"" Diggs.  Oscar is a sleazy stage magician, who happens to moonlight as a heartbreaker.  Likeable, right?  Unfortunately, James Franco is neither charming enough to make us like him despite this, nor is he particularly convincing at it anyway.  He over-acts when he should under-act, and he does it a lot.  Ironically, Franco is at his most convincing when playing his stage magician persona, where his hammy performance is actually intended.  After wishing to become a great man (incidentally, something you should never do if you don't want the General Film Law of Protagonist Motivations to suck you into a dangerous adventure), Oscar is brought to Oz in a spectacular sequence by tornado.  The cinematography here is wonderful, quickly immersing us in the fantastic world of Oz without being disorienting or overwhelming.Oscar meets the witch Theodora (played by Mila Kunis), and quickly learns he is prophecied to be a wizard come to save Oz from destruction.  The opportunistic conman that he is, Oscar accepts this title, and, bafflingly quickly, manages to romance Theodora.  While Mila Kunis is an excellent actor, she's clearly out of her element in the land of Oz, and later plot developments only serve to make this more obvious.  While saying more would venture into spoiler territory, the film destroys the potentially interesting character developments she begins to go through in an uninteresting second-act twist.And that is largely the source of the film's problems.  Raimi's vision of Oz is spectacular, and the supporting cast is strong, but Franco and Kunis simply aren't the likeable main cast a film like this needs.  Judy Garland provided an excellent role in the first Oz, not just because of the skill of her performance, but because the audience identified with her.  She was a stranger in a very strange land, just like the audience, and that helped to center the movie.  Oz: The Great and Powerful, unfortunately, does not have its own Judy Garland.  Franco simply comes off as a charicature at times, and Kunis has been forced into a role that doesn't suit her.In the end, it's a coin toss whether any one movie-goer will find this to be a worthwhile Friday night.  I enjoyed it, but that may have been from comparing it to the even more mediocre Jack the Giant Slayer.  This is a very visual movie, and begs to be seen in 3D.  Otherwise, it's most likely a rental.IMPORTANT NOTE: While I viewed and enjoyed the film, I did not purchase a DVD copy for myself, and thus cannot comment on the quality of the tangible item.

1641916,A1ERNG8ZJCW5CB,B00C5W3SBE,Bridget Schabron,"[1, 1]","I have to admit, I'm not one of those in my generation that thrives on the internet and other gadgets like tablets and  smart phones (though I do use a cell phone a lot), so maybe it's just part of my semi-old-fashioned take on some things that prevented me from fully appreciating the storm of special-effects used in this movie.  I liked the black and white start to the movie, and the sudden transition to color in Oz, but I believe the computerized effects were majorly over-used.  First, before I incur sneering from someone who is a fan and is in the tech world, I, too, am heavily involved in the tech world currently, including doing programming.  And I like special effects&#8212;especially compared to some goofy costumes and other effects that were used back in the day.  But special effects have their limit&#8212;over-used, just like a character in a movie who can throw in funny one-liners, can become just plain annoying.  Pretty soon I felt like I was watching a computer-animated movie, like A Bug&#8217;s Life, but worse than that (I like computer animated movies, but I like live-action movies when that&#8217;s what I expect), the computer effects actually managed to distract me from the plot line.  It&#8217;s like an artist who is so enthralled with being able to do one kind of stroke, or paint one certain object (like a dog) well, that they focus too much on that and ruin the rest of the painting, or make all their paintings look too-alike for someone who wants a variety, yet likes the artist&#8217;s style.*Spoiler alert here*  Second, aside from the background and scenery and sometimes computer-animated characters, I was a bit disappointed in character development, and sometimes what felt like a lack of reasoning for why a character acted the way they did, as well as it taking too long for the main character, Oz, to morph into a moral guy.  Now, I do believe that the directors/screenwriters/etc. did a good job for reasoning why the first witch that Oz meets eats the apple her sister provides.  But why is that first mean sister so mean in the first place?  And how does she manage to trick the other sister; though that sister is a bit nave, is she really dumb, too?  And besides that, I was actually depressed by the fact that the sister who becomes the wicked witch of the west went from a charming, happy, go-lucky, nave girl who quickly develops a crush on Oscar &#8220;aka&#8221; Oz, into a terribly wicked person who hates Oz and wants to destroy him and her own good sister, even to the shock of the first mean sister.  I guess I&#8217;m the sort of person who always hopes that even the bad characters will show remorse at some point (such as Darth Vader in Star Wars).  I do like how the good sister, who remains good, really sees through Oz unlike her nave sister, yet still thinks he can be a good guy and help stop her mean sister.  And I would be lying if I said I didn&#8217;t like the romance, more obvious at the end, between the good sister and Oz.Overall, The Great and Powerful Oz is fun to watch and has a happy ending that includes the a few clever tie-ins to the beginning characters in Kansas (I recall something about a trained monkey&#8230;), similar to the good old Wizard of Oz movie.  But it sometimes gets you lost in computer-effects and may disappoint you as well&#8212;I mean, gosh, shouldn&#8217;t someone who&#8217;s nave and only sees the best in people still be good at the end?  It stinks, in my opinion, that she is the one who seems to be the meanest at the end, with no hope of changing back in sight (unless the screenwriters for subsequent films intend to pull a Darth Vader moment at some point, unlike what is shown in The Wizard of Oz).  Perhaps I just feel sorry for her in this movie, unlike in The Wizard of Oz, because I saw how she was before.Maybe the plot parts I don&#8217;t like actually come from Frank Baum, the writer of the Oz books, and not the screenwriters, I don&#8217;t know.Anyway, this review is getting too long and could turn into a screenplay itself of how I would have liked the story to go, if I keep on going.

Disney usually uses iTunes for their Digital Copies (which the product information does not say)I dislike iTunes digital movies for these reasons!...#1 Redeeming an iTunes Digital Copy takes forever!! Up to an hour and a half sometimes where as Redeeming UV UltraViolet(superior format) or CinemaNow Digital Copies takes under 1 minute!!!#2 Also, You cannot watch iTunes on your TV without buying an iTunes TV box. More money to spend. Where as UltraViolet UV has a TV app on most all blu ray players now that can be watched with merged free accounts with VUDU or CinemaNOw common apps on all Blu Ray Players. If you have a SmartTV the apps are already on your media Hub. Vudu is also on Roku Boxes but CinemaNow app is not on Roku Box yet.#3 These free Vudu & CinemaNow apps allow you to watch all your Digital  movies on any media device or phone in a cloud. I think its like 6 devices at a time can use the app and you can invite friends to merge their UV movies account with yours for sharing!  Also with these 2 apps you can also download your Digital Copies onto your devices at anytime to watch without WiFi connection for traveling. So iTunes Digital Copies are inferior because they are limited to where you can play them. Its very convenient to have my Digital movies on Vudu or CinemaNow so I don't always have to insert the hard BluRay or DVD disc into my player, I can just turn the player on and click on the app, select from all my digital movies then hit play to enjoy it without moving from my couch or bed!!!.... Check Best Buy or Target as they at times will offer a different Digital Copy format than iTunes for the same movie. I will always look for the UV UltraViolet or CinemaNow Digitals over iTunes!NOW  lets get to the movie as a production... I will keep it fairly short because it upsets me at how bad this movie was!Horrible acting across the board. James Franco bland, lifeless and no depth as well as the forced acting with all the witches! The storyline was all over the place, remedial dialog, pointless boring underdeveloped characters(that china doll?...sweet but pointless) poor pacing & a recycled score by Danny Elfman who I just love but no effort was put into an original sound for this epic flop.I was so excited for this movie but it was so boring and uninspiring. It was beautiful looking though with lots of color and beautiful set design but that was the only good quality of this movie in addition to the opening credits which were very cool but that is it. Opening credits and colorful set production don't make a movie good on their own. Disappointed all around. Bummer it could have been awesome!When leaving the theater I met someone that worked on the film who did the set design overseas and he told me that Johnny Depp was to play Oz but he backed out. Depp would have made all the difference for the character Oz but still the script is very weak.If you plan to buy this movie then get the 3D version. It will distract you a little from the horrible production as a whole. The only part I liked were a couple of the 3D effects but not sure how it will come off on a home 60"" 3D tv.Overall the film was a horrible disappointment and a flop. I am looking forward to Warner Brothers reboot of the Wizard of Oz with Robert Zemeckis directing and a possible Robert Downey Jr. playing Oz. Since Warner Brothers has the original rights to the Wizard of Oz, they restricted Disney in many ways of duplicating anything from the original movie which is why so many viewers who loved the original Wizard of Oz were disappointed with OZ The Great & Powerful. Many restrictions from Warner Bro. were including the Witches shade of green, to her nose shape & wart along with all the other characters clothes etc... Even the ruby red slippers will not look the same in the Disney versions... I think Warner Brothers will destroy Disney with their Wizard of Oz remake by a long shot since they own the rights to the original and have the freedom to duplicate classic fan favorites from the film to having liberty to do whatever they want.... I feel Warner Brothers OZ will be superior!  But for now I am passing on buying this movie!",1,OZ The Weak  & Floppable... Don't Buy!

I was kind of excited because I love Wizard of Oz (and even the creepyReturn to Oz); I also was enticed by the cast. I knew there would be some differences due to copyright issues that Disney had to work around but overall it seemed like a fitting prequel.The problem? Not enough character and plot development. Now they did advertise it as being modified from its original format to fit the airplanes' screen size but also edited for content. I wonder how much they edited out because this was like a short story compared to the depth and development in the aforementioned Oz movies.==SPOILER ALERT (and not really much of one but eh, be warned)===You start out in a small town with a magician (Oz) who pulls a Dorothy and winds up in Oz (city). Before the tornado, he meets Michelle William's character and they have some kind of back story but it is so brief that it doesn't truly connect the two of them before he gets transported. Then he gets to Oz, has a mild introduction of a relationship with Mila Kunis' character. Then meets her sister. Then meets Glinda (Michelle Williams). Then fights the ""evil"" (Mila Kunis/Rachel Weisz) and then the movie is over. THEN THE MOVIE IS OVER. I just told you the same story in less than an paragraph. If that's any indication to the entertainment you'll get from the movie, then run with it.It gets a 3 star only because it wasn't horrible. It just wasn't good. Or great.

So I decided to move south from Washington State to the sunshine in California.  There may not be a Yellow Brick Road in the city in which I now live -- I haven't checked on Google Maps yet, however -- but at least it's sunny about 300 days a year.  That's surely better than raining 300 days a year.My ""new"" house was built in 1938, or probably the same year that ""The Wizard of Oz"" was being filmed.  The bad things about an older house:  it's creaky and it constantly needs work.  The good things:  it has charm and it was built to last, unlike the houses built today.  And this is about exactly how I'd compare the original ""Wizard of Oz"" with ""Oz:  the Great and Powerful.""  The latter just doesn't have much charm, while the former was overflowing with it.  And this prequel will most likely be almost forgotten in only a few years, while people will be talking about the original through the next century.Oh, I did really like Michelle Williams, of course.  She's always good.  The only problem that I usually have with her in a movie:  I actually think about Heath Ledger the whole time.  I'll bet the same might go for her.  He definitely died before his time, and he had several roles where he was terrific.  And I really liked the little porcelain doll here as well; she seemed to have more humanity than almost any of the other humans in this picture.But while watching, I started thinking about the potential that this film had, and I thought about how much this film owed to the original ""Oz"" to be good.  I would argue that ""The Wizard of Oz,"" while surely not being perfect -- no film ever is or will be perfect -- was probably a masterpiece.  And I started thinking about how the producers could have almost guaranteed that this film would have been great.  So let's go back in time and remake this film right this time . . . .1.  Make Tim Burton the director.  This film either needed to be lighter or darker, and I think that Mr. Burton would have gone the latter route but simultaneously given it more humanity, as he always does.  2.  Put Johnny Depp in the main role.  You can put him in almost any lead male role and it'll be better.  3.  Keep Michelle Williams in it.  She's always good to great.  4.  Beg Charlize Theron to play the Wicked Witch.  Pay her whatever she wants.  She was terrific in, well, every role she plays.  But she was doubly terrific in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" as the Meanest Person Ever.  5.  Make Patton Oswalt the monkey.  6.  Finally, producers, just get the hell outta Mr. Burton's way and let him make the picture!But unfortunately, we don't have a time machine so we will be ""stuck"" with this, although it has a few moments here and there.  It seemed to be influenced by ""Willy Wonka"" (the original) and ""Mary Poppins.""  And I somewhat liked the themes:  Deception, Greed and Redemption.  Oh, and ""Dance with the One Who Brung Ya'.""Not a total disaster.  But you know what?

""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" was looking to change that. Disney originally had the rights to ""The Wizard of Oz"" but sold them to Samuel Goldwyn, who in turn sold it to Louis B. Mayer, who created the original film. Now, it has run full circle and Disney brings us ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"", a prequel that explains the origin of the man who became Oz.Oscar Diggs, played by James Franco, is a circus magician in early 20th century Kansas. He's a shallow man. He's an arrogant man. He's a womanizer (they took a few liberties there). So when his time in the circus comes to an abrupt halt and his hot air balloon finds the heart of a Kansas tornado, he finds Oz, just the same way that Dorothy did. We go from black and white to vivid, 3D animation color. We've come a long way since 3-strip Technicolor.The beauty and 3D of the entire film are exceptional. The best part of the film was the realization of the Land of Oz like we didn't get in the original. Sure, they traveled the yellow brick road for part of the film, but we also get to see places inside the Emerald City that we could only imagine before. We get to see off the beaten path places in the land of Oz. We get to meet a little China doll girl who was the only survivor of a China doll city that was destroyed by the witch's monkeys. The imagery of the film is top notch. The effects that bring the witches to life and Oscar's friends are none short of brilliant.Bottom line though, if you're slapping 5-stars on this movie, your standards are way too low. We deserve better as paying customers. As I've seen a lot in recent months and years, the script doesn't match the visuals. The script is sluggish and dull, including the one pathetic attempt at tapping into the musical that the original was. ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" doesn't even come close to achieving the magic of the first. The movie is unrealized and hastily thrown together, a money making venture.The writers and creators took a strange course that to me, proved very costly. Oscar a.k.a. Oz, is a ladies man. He woos nearly every woman he meets. The three women, Theodora,Evanora and Glenda are all smitten with him. Consequently, there's a lot of kissing. Not only is it hard to believe James Franco to be this person, it plays out like a television soap opera, cheapening and distracting the audience from what they truly came to see.""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" is a so-so way to escape for a few hours. I especially like the characters that Oz meets along the way; the China Girl and Finley the flying bellhop monkey. Yet, too much time was wasted building up emotional relationships with three different women and that left the scenes with the witches doing their nasty evil, in the sparse category. You'd think with something like this, Hollywood would have taken more time to make sure it wasn't just a visual treat and would have left sexual attraction on the cutting room floor.",3,Too much KISSING and not enough WITCHING,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,3160,"['hard', 'believe', 'technology', 'resources', 'have', 'movie', 'industry', 'days', 'movie', 'released', '1939', 'still', 'reigns', 'supreme', 'others', 'same', 'vein', 'try', 'duplicate', 'true', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'was', 'looking', 'change', 'Disney', 'originally', 'had', 'rights', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'sold', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', 'who', 'turn', 'sold', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'who', 'created', 'original', 'film', 'Now', 'run', 'full', 'circle', 'Disney', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'prequel', 'origin', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'Oz.Oscar', 'Diggs', 'played', 'James', 'Franco', 'circus', 'magician', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'Kansas', 'shallow', 'man', 'arrogant', 'man', 'womanizer', 'took', 'few', 'liberties', 'there', 'So', 'when', 'time', 'circus', 'abrupt', 'halt', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'heart', 'Kansas', 'tornado', 'Oz', 'just', 'same', 'way', 'Dorothy', 'did', 'go', 'black', 'white', 'vivid', '3D', 'animation', 'color', ""'ve"", 'come', 'long', 'way', '3-strip', 'Technicolor.The', 'beauty', '3D', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'exceptional', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'realization', 'Land', 'Oz', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'original', 'Sure', 'traveled', 'yellow', 'brick', 'road', 'part', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'places', 'Emerald', 'City', 'could', 'only', 'imagine', 'get', 'see', 'off', 'beaten', 'path', 'places', 'land', 'Oz', 'get', 'meet', 'little', 'China', 'doll', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'survivor', 'China', 'doll', 'city', 'was', 'destroyed', 'witch', 'monkeys', 'imagery', 'film', 'top', 'notch', 'effects', 'bring', 'witches', 'life', 'Oscar', 'friends', 'are', 'none', 'short', 'brilliant.Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'slapping', '5-stars', 'movie', 'standards', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'low', 'deserve', 'better', 'paying', 'customers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'recent', 'months', 'years', 'script', ""n't"", 'match', 'visuals', 'script', 'sluggish', 'dull', 'including', 'one', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'tapping', 'musical', 'original', 'was', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'achieving', 'magic', 'first', 'movie', 'unrealized', 'hastily', 'thrown', 'together', 'money', 'making', 'venture.The', 'writers', 'creators', 'took', 'strange', 'course', 'proved', 'very', 'costly', 'Oscar', 'a.k.a', 'Oz', 'ladies', 'man', 'woos', 'nearly', 'woman', 'three', 'women', 'Theodora', 'Evanora', 'Glenda', 'are', 'smitten', 'Consequently', 'lot', 'kissing', 'Not', 'only', 'hard', 'believe', 'James', 'Franco', 'be', 'person', 'out', 'television', 'soap', 'opera', 'cheapening', 'distracting', 'audience', 'what', 'truly', 'came', 'see', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'so-so', 'way', 'escape', 'few', 'hours', 'especially', 'characters', 'Oz', 'way', 'China', 'Girl', 'Finley', 'flying', 'bellhop', 'monkey', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'wasted', 'building', 'up', 'emotional', 'relationships', 'three', 'different', 'women', 'left', 'scenes', 'witches', 'doing', 'nasty', 'evil', 'sparse', 'category', ""'d"", 'think', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'time', 'make', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'visual', 'treat', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor']",N/A

1641981,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00C5W3SBE,C. Sawin,"[5, 13]","Set in Kansas in 1905, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" introduces Oscar Diggs (James Franco), also known as Oz, a traveling magician with Baum Bros Circus. Oscar is also a professional con artist, but doesn't give nearly enough credit to his loyal assistant Frank (Zach Braff). Oscar has always dreamt of being a great man, but his lack of ethics and morality and extremely greedy intentions have always held him back. He is accidentally thrown into the Land of Oz where he meets Theodora (Mila Kunis), her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), their rival Glinda (Michelle Williams), a living China Girl (Joey King), and a talking flying monkey in a bell hop suit named Finley (Zach Braff). The prophecy has foretold that a wizard who shares the name of the land will come to save everyone from the clutches of The Wicked Witch. Even though everyone in Oz believes him to be that wizard Oscar can't find the courage to tell everyone the truth.""The Wizard of Oz"" is in dire need of a revisit. It was something that was seen at a very young age. Not much is remembered other than having a fear of flying monkeys and trying to get a glimpse of that urban myth of one of the munchkins hanging themselves on set and the sequence supposedly making it into the final print of the film. Judging ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" as a stand-alone film was the only option since it had been so long.You can go ahead and welcome Danny Elfman back to a Sam Raimi film. This is Elfman's first collaboration with Raimi in nearly nine years and it's Elfman's score that helps bring that circus theme to life. The opening credits are particularly eye-catching and immediately establish that carnival-like atmosphere. The fantasy adventure begins in black and white and is presented in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen). It opens with the Baum Bros traveling circus and you witness some of the tricks Oscar has up his sleeve. The tornado sequence is done really well as the debris flying around makes full use of the 3D effect and the organ that passes by is a little unsettling in a good way. Once Oscar makes it to Oz, the film transitions to color and the aspect ratio changes to 2.35:1 (widescreen). The moments when Oscar is witnessing the colorful and wondrous Oz for the first time may be the highlight of the film. Personally speaking, those particular moments are really influential; someone being taken out of their element and placed in a strange new world is just amazing and reminiscent of ""Alice in Wonderland"" in a way.The film hits its peak once Oscar arrives in Oz. Oscar meets Theodora (Kunis) and saves Finley (Braff) who becomes Oscar's life servant because of it. After meeting Evanora (Weisz), Oscar sets out to the Dark Forest to break the staff of The Wicked Witch and become king. They meet a little China Girl (King) who decides to tag along after Oscar fixes her broken legs. Finley is the best character of the film. He's hilarious nearly every time he opens his mouth. The Dark Forest is also really creepy and the flying baboons are even more terrifying than their relatives.Everything is progressing smoothly until Glinda (Williams) is introduced. Just because she's The Good Witch doesn't mean she has to be so lame and boring. All she really does is make fog and bubbles. The film suddenly takes a dive into really cheesy territory at this point, too. The special effects seem a bit too overzealous at times as witches probably shouldn't fly around and shoot fireballs or electricity from their hands as often as they do. Mila Kunis is kind of awkward as The Wicked Witch. She's believable as Theodora, but once she transforms it almost seems like she's trying too hard. Her constant squawking and bizarre and rigid hand movements make her seem more like a giant parrot than anything else. Rachel Weisz is mostly satisfying as Evanora until she starts shouting at everyone near the end of the film. Then her voice suddenly starts cracking more often than the Squeaky Voiced Teenager on ""The Simpsons.""If you're planning on seeing this in theaters, the 3D is utilized quite well and used rather frequently so it's worth the money. Hats are thrown, a strong man bursts through a door, the debris in the tornado, snow, hummingbirds, water fairies, gold coins, and spears all jump out at you. It's certainly the best use of 3D so far this year, but it doesn't exactly have much competition just yet.""Oz the Great and Powerful"" does stumble about halfway through and never really recovers from its trip into incredibly campy territory.

1642001,A3QU74B9N0830G,B00C5W3SBE,Dan Thompson,"[3, 10]","In ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" a prequel to the 1939 classic, Sam Raimi presents us with a visually striking wonder that boasts a talented cast and magic-filled story. The basis synopsis involves a traveling magician and confidence man named Oscar Diggs (nicknamed Oz and played by James Franco) who dreams of doing more than entertaining small audiences in small towns. His dreams include not only being a ""good man"", but a ""great one."" During a violent storm in Kansas in 1905, the magician is magically transported to the magical land of Oz, a realm in which his arrival indicates he's part of a grand prophecy that foretells his slaying of the Wicked Witch.There's no doubt that Raimi is a master of the visual arts, as is seen on display here. The vibrant colors and sweeping, majestic landscapes are beautiful and a real treat to look at. Not to mention the incredible opening sequence that really set the visual tone for the rest of the film. I didn't see ""Oz"" 3D but I've heard from others the movie makes great use of the technology.Unfortunately, in spite of the terrific art direction and special effects, there's something lacking in the story Raimi was trying to tell. Perhaps that's due to flaws in the script but there's definite inconsistencies in the tone and a couple gag-out-loud lines of dialogue that take away from the sense of wonderment in the film. At times the movie is a suspense-filled mystery, shrouded by dark overtones and shadowy characters that, frankly, I would be a little nervous to bring a little one to. At others, it's a fun-loving family film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Mix in a few overly long dialogue scenes and you get a very uneven story that doesn't quite know where to go.On the positive side, while there may be problems with the overall story, there's nothing wrong with the cast. Say what you will about James Franco but the actor knows how succeed with what he's given; he smiles and charms in his role as the title magician and, in my opinion, was a great casting choice. Equally enjoyable are the witches that Oz encounters, namely Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams). Weisz in particular seems to enjoy her evil role and Williams is regal as ever as the good witch. The two standout members of the cast for me, however, belong to Zach Braff, who plays Oz's assistant in the prologue, and later on voices the flying monkey Finley, and Joey King who voices the delicate yet feisty China Girl.

To try and produce a movie tied in with that classic would be a formidable challenge for anyone.

As I reflected on the movie I later came to feel it was better than I was initially willing to give it credit for and began to feel it had merit on its own.I believe once one is over the initial adjustment period with the movie that it will wear reasonably well; I'm actually looking forward to watching it again since I've had some time now to digest what it was trying to say.

It certainly has its moments and parts of it were rather enjoyable, but at times it felt somewhat disconnected.

The dialog floats somewhere between being incredibly earnest and a parody of fairytale storytelling.  But aside from Rachel Weis, who is kind of decent, the actors lack the gusto to sell such precious presentation.  Mila Kunis in particular sounds out of place with her husky voiced faux New Yorker affect.  Here she's expected to portray a quintessentially naive girl turning into the epically evil Wicked Witch, and as you might expect she fails at both.  Aside from those human performances, the film has several highly annoying CGI characters who look and sound like the rejects from some straight to video Shrek sequel.

1642026,AXKV0W2E2RR6A,B00C5W3SBE,DemonessOfDeathValley,"[0, 0]","Overall, this IS a good film. But if you're expecting something that follows the original to the letter, you're gonna be disappointed, or pleasantly surprised, depending on your expectations. It's not the complete book adaptation that Return to Oz was. But it's not the happy musical either.First, I'd like to explain why I only gave it four stars.James Franco as the Wizard - In the beginning, he seems to be ok in the role. But much like Judy Garland's performance. It seemed that the script was perhaps written for someone else. In the original film, the script was written for Shirley Temple but her studio wouldn't allow her to do the movie. While Garland's performance is iconic to the original and she brought a kind of melancholy yearning to the role that the more 'cutesy' Temple never could have, it was clear that the role had been written for another actress, a younger one. In the case of Franco, he has a sort of Old Hollywood, pretty boy look, especially when made up for the Wizard. No doubt the reason that he was chosen. But some of his facial expressions seem forced, as if he had been told, 'look more like (insert name of actor really wanted)'. This is not so obvious in the black and white portion of the film, where I thought that maybe Disney did it intentionally, but there are times that it seems a little bit too 'forced'. But it's very obvious in the color portion. There are times when he tries to give that smile that is reminiscent of Johnny Depp in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or his kind of disgusted look from Sleepy Hollow. The projection of Franco's voice seems a bit forced as well, and he has a kind of 'modern' quality that I don't believe was intentional.Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch - She has a kind of grotesque beauty, the same that Margret Hamilton had as the witch. While she doesn't have Hamilton's 'plain jane' type look. She has a more obvious, dark beauty. In the witch makeup, she does look believable. However...her hysterical shrieking, gets old. The first time, it's warranted. Then after that, it's like 'oh she's shrieking again...' I feel that a more quiet approach would have suited some of the instances better. Such as when the Wizard tells her that she may return to the Emerald City should she find goodness again, if she'd looked back and stoically said 'Never' perhaps with a little shake of her head and then laughed. It would have been more believable. But instead she shrieks it and flies off. It's also obvious that she's the voice of Meg in Family Guy. She has that same sarcasm in both Family Guy and That 70s Show, which detracts from her portrayal as the witch. Her costume doesn't fit her character. It's a more modern design, while her character suggests a more traditional or perhaps totally different design. Again, like with Franco's entire character. The witch's costume looks as though it were designed for someone else.The clash of accents - There's a lack of congruity with the accents. First, there's the English accent of Rachel Weisz, while her portrayal of Evanora was very good. She was one of the few completely believable characters that was consistent throughout the film and seemed to be comfortable in her role. The more 'california or modern' accent of her sister seems out of place. As does the lack of the ethereal voice of Glinda. She has a quietness about her, but not the more 'angelic' voice. James Franco has a kind of flat tone to his voice, so he doesn't sound as though he's from Kansas nor does he have the rolling r's or the grand quality that the actor in the original had. Had he put that 'grandness' in his voice during the black and white portion, I feel it would have at least added something.A childlike quality- This film is rated PG and some of it seems overly childish. No doubt because it is Disney and it was taken into consideration that a stronger rating would no doubt have hurt ticket sales since parents would have wanted to bring children. However, I feel that the overly brightness of the flowers and some of the sets in the initial arrival in OZ are a bit over the top. While the flying monkies of the witch have been turned into flying baboons that rip people to shreds. Then you have the cute little china doll running around, but she has a miniature knife in one part. It's an imbalance of the darkness and light. One thing seems overly childish while another seems overly dark.A very suspicious Tim Burton quality - This movie has a very Burtonesque quality. Which at first made me smile. But as the film progresses, it's more forced. As if it were done by a fan or someone that was trying to give it a Tim Burton look. I think that maybe that was the problem. Danny Elfman does the music which is very suspicious since he does the music for nearly all of Tim Burton's films. There are certain suspect set designs and the opening sequence made me expect to see Burton's name SOMEWHERE on this film. However, it's not. In watching the film a second time, the Oz character as well as Theodora almost seem as though they might have been written for Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. The wicked witch's costume looks as though it were designed with Carter in mind, not Kunis. Which to me is very suspect.Now that the cons are out of the way, here are the prosWelcome deviations from the original - Normally when a film like this one comes along, it's either a welcome new film or a sad knockoff. I feel this one is the former. Because instead of making blatant references to the original and having a bunch of knock off music or characters, this film does stand alone. In the fact that there are parallel characters in the black and white sequence that are in the color sequence as well. But these character's names and look is different. For example a reference is made to a 'John Gale' not Henry. And all of the main characters in Oz are not showcased in the black and white sequence. Noticeably missing from the black and white portion, are Evanora, Theodora, Knuk and the master Tinker. Which to me suggests that this is not a 'dream' as was the case with Dorothy's trip to Oz. The only characters that are from the black and white portion are Glinda who plays a woman named Annie that is obviously in love with Oz and he returns that love but is unwilling to admit it or settle down. His assistant Frank, who's Oz counterpart is a talking, flying monkey named Finlay. And the little china girl who is obviously the girl in the wheelchair at his show. He couldn't help the girl in the wheelchair walk. But he fixed the china girl's legs. Symbolic of something he couldn't do in the 'real world'. Glinda is Glinda the Good from the SOUTH, not north. At times, there are musical portions that almost sound like Somewhere Over the Rainbow, but not quite and almost sound like portions of the original score, but not quite.Absence of cheesy costumes - For 1939, the costumes were very appropriate in the original. But if they'd been referenced in this one it would have been a disaster. For example, having a kind of ball gown pink dress for Glinda or the large wand with a star at the end would have seemed childish. As would the over use of green in the costumes of the Emerald City Denizens. There is a use of deep green tones in the Emerald City clothing. But not the bright green over the top costumes. There's a kind of steampunk quality instead, that makes it very visually appealing.No song and dance numbers - There's really only one song sung in the entire film. And it's cut short. Another welcome deviation from the original.The absence of the original title characters - There is a lion, there are scarecrows and there are munchkins. But there's no Tin Man. No dancing scarecrow, no Lollipop Guild or Lullaby League. Which was very refreshing in my eyes.",4,"Good movie, but there are some cons",1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,7801,"['Overall', 'good', 'film', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'something', 'original', 'letter',

1642027,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00C5W3SBE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","Since the 1930&#8242;s, Walt Disney had wanted to make a film inspired by the 1900 American novel ""The Wizard of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum.Unfortunately for Disney, with the success of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"", it gave Samuel Goldwyn the idea that films about fantasy would do well in the U.S. and thus he acquired the rights and re-sold it to Louis B. Mayer in 1938.  And this would result in MGM developing the musical adaptation ""Wizard of Oz"" in 1939.Walt Disney would later revisit Oz with an idea to create a musical during the 1950&#8242;s with the Mickey Mouse Club titled ""The Road to Oz"" but the plan was dropped.  Another Disney opportunity to revisit Oz as a live-action film did happen in 1985 titled ""Rainbow Road to Oz"", but at that time, Disney films were not doing that well in the box office.  Disney would lose the film rights to the OZ books and the books were reverted to public domain.But for screenwriter Mitchel Kapner, having read the sixth novel in the series ""The Emerald City of Oz"", Kapner wanted to explore the origins of the Wizard of Oz and so, Kapner tried to present it to other studios but to no avail.  But Walt Disney Pictures decided to give a film adaptation a chance and Sam Raimi (""Spider-Man"" films, ""Darkman"", ""Army of Darkness"") was hired to direct ""Oz the Great and Powerful"".The film would star James Franco (""127 Hours"", ""Spider-Man"" films), Mila Kunis (""Black Swan"", ""That 70&#8242;s Show"", ""Family Guy""), Rachel Weisz (""The Mummy"" films, ""The Fountain"", ""Constantine""), Michelle Williams (""Shutter Island"", ""My Week with Marilyn"", ""Dawson's Creek"") and Zach Braff (""Scrubs"", ""Garden State"", ""Chicken Little"").The film would become a box office success, earning over $490 million.  And now ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray + DVD+Digital Copy, Blu-ray + Digital Copy and DVD + Digital Copy courtesy of Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in June 2013.VIDEO:""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio, 1:33:1 at the beginning of the film).  I can honestly say that ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is one of the best looking Blu-rays I have seen in 2013.  Colors are vibrant, skin tones are natural, CG elements manages to look convincingly real and world of Oz with its lush green mountains, colorful flowers, clouds, high above Oz and seeing the environments during the day and even the look of the city during night with fireworks, flames, etc.  This film looks amazing!There is so much to be impressed about with this film.  Close-ups of the characters show great clarity and detail, CG clouds to characters like Finley and even China Girl look fantastic close up!  Even the make up design on Mila Kunis as the wicked witch is impressive!  The mouth movements are perfectly aligned with what the character is saying and the film including production and costume design (as well as makeup design) are wonderful highlights to this film.During my viewing, I saw no artifacts or banding, no crush and nothing negative when it comes to picture quality.  If anything, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!AUDIO:""Oz the Great and Powerful"" won me over with picture quality but how is the lossless soundtrack?  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HDMA, English .1 and 2.0 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, this film is immersive.  The soundtrack for its many action sequences along with Danny Elfman's music makes the soundscape so immersive with audio well utilized, LFE happening during the action sequences and I was impressed! From the scene where Oz arrives in Oz during the beginning of the film sounds amazing but once you get to the chase scene, soldier marching or even the plan enacted by Oz, audiophiles should be pleased by this active, immersive lossless soundtrack!Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Oz the Great and Powerful"" comes with the following special features:Disney Second Screen - Explore the film on your iPad and make magic with Finley and Oz's Bag of Tricks.  Plus: Journey into the Fantastic Land!Walt Disney and the Road to Oz - (10:13) A featurette about how Walt Disney had wanted to do an Oz film since making his first animated film.  Despite trying to attain the rights to make a film, he tried to make a make an Oz musical in the '50s titled ""Rainbow Road to Oz"" featuring the Mickey Mouse gang.My Journey in Oz by James Franco - (21:43) James Franco documents a typical day on the set of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" featuring interviews with Director Sam Raimi and the cast.China Girl and the Suspension of Belief - (5:26) The making of the china Girl, how they made China Girl using a marionette and the voice behind the character.Before Your Very Eyes form Kansas to Oz - (11:02) The art of oz and how award winning production designer Robert Stromberg added his own unique touch to ""Oz the Great and Powerful"".Mila's Metamorphosis - (7:43) Mila Kunis and makeup designers transforming the actress to the wicked witch.Mr. Elfman's Musical Concoctions - (7:13) Danny Elfman talks about his working relationship with Sam Raimi and creating the music for the film.Bloopers - (5:06) Bloopers from ""Oz the Great and Powerful"".EXTRAS:""Oz the Great and Powerful"" comes with a slipcover and this version comes with a Blu-ray, DVD (widescreen 2:40:1 (beginning of feature film is 1:33:1), English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, English 2.0 Dolby Digital, Subtitles: English SDH, French and Spanish) and Digital Copy of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:Like many people who have watched the classic ""Wizard of Oz"", anything made after this film based on ""Oz"", many would like to dismiss it.But for fans of the 1985 film ""Return to Oz"", despite it not doing well in the box office, fans of the L. Frank Baum books were supportive of the Disney live-action film because it was a faithful adaptation of the novel.Since 1985, so much has changed when it comes to technology and recreating worlds.  And with the 2013 Disney film, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", it gave director Sam Raimi and writers Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire to create a film, with a skillful and talented crew to recreate the world of Oz and give us a visual feast but also a storyline that the young and old can easily be entertained.  But I felt the film captured the fantasy and its efficacy lies in the fact that the world of Oz can look so gorgeous in the film, even though it may have been created via CG and the talent were acting around a blue screen.From the visual appearance of Finley, the flying monkey or China Doll, just the smallest details when it came to textures and detail, I was in awe by what was created.  Production design, costumes were magnificent and sure, the talents were superimposed on CG backdrops but it was well-done. It was convincing and it looks so amazing on Blu-ray!James Franco managed to play Oz...the magician, conman and womanizer with brashness, humor but also bringing dignity to the character.  Mila Kunis did a wonderful job of portraying the wicked witch Theodora, but I would have loved to see the character of Theodora in much more pain before her transformation into the vile, green witch...which would be known as the Wicked Witch of the West.As for Evanora, Rachel Weisz has done a wonderful job of playing an antagonist with amoral affection to her sisters but I was waiting to see if the film would make a correlation to the magic shoes which would become part of the Wizard of Oz.And Michelle Williams as Glinda, also known as the Good Witch of the South in the novel.  The moralistic and caring character played with gentleness similar to her glistening and radiant version portrayed in the Wizard of Oz.  Primary difference is that Glinda was accused of crimes she did not commit and is a bit unsure of herself, while the later version of herself is calm and self-assured.This leads me to wonder if Disney plans on making a trilogy or more films based on L. Frank Baum's novels especially with ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"", the second book.  One that introduces the scarecrow and tin man but features a new protagonist named Tip and the witch of the North, Mombi.  It would be a great tie-in to the films of showing how the scarecrow and tin man came to be and possibly introducing the character known as Ozma.With the box office success of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", I would only hope that Disney does continue the story of Oz, as it would provide a very good connection to ""The Wizard of Oz"".As for ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", I was hooked by the film's visuals but the storyline was fascinating and I was entertained but also wanted to see the origin of the witches and Glinda the Good and of course, Oz.For parents, personally I think the original ""Wizard of Oz"" had more frightening elements than ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" but I can see some younger children being spooked by seeing how the Wicked Witch came to be or perhaps the scary look of the evil flying monkeys.  But ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a wonderful family film that both young and old can equally be entertained.The Blu-ray release was magnificent as colors were vibrant, detailed and I saw no hint of any artifacts or banding, the picture quality was perfect.  The lossless audio was immersive and will no doubt make audiophiles happy.  And as for special features, you do get a good number of them included on this Blu-ray release.  I have been spoiled by magnificent Disney releases on Blu-ray that  I was hoping to see more when it comes to special features.  Especially with audio commentary tracks or just lengthier featurettes, so I felt the Blu-ray release could have had more special features included.I know there are people who have issues with the Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy being released separately.  While some companies choose to include their Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray 2D films together, Disney chooses to keep them separate but that's their decision and perhaps for future releases, they may consider people's pleas of releasing one release versus two separate releases.Overall, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a gorgeous, thrilling and captivating film that has potential for even more sequels within the world of Oz.  I'm confident to say that ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is one of the most beautiful films I have seen on Blu-ray for 2013 and also to have a complimenting lossless soundtrack that is immersive.""Oz the Great and Powerful: Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy"" is highly recommended!",5,"(4.5 stars) ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a gorgeous, thrilling and captivating film!",1372896000,"07 4,

1642028,ATA980NJ3OSZT,B00C5W3SBE,Dennis at Holy Apostles,"[0, 2]","Ever wonder what the 1939 ""Wizard of Oz"" would have been like if first choices W.C. Fields (as the Wizard) and an 11-year-old Shirley Temple (as Dorothy) were cast? Now we have some idea with ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" the 2013 prequel. No, we don't have Dorothy. But even she might have been upstaged in a 1939 version centered on W.C. Fields. Instead, we have been spoiled by a mature-voiced Judy Garland singing her iconic ""Over the Rainbow,"" along with the less-intrusive Frank Morgan as the Wizard. Had the 1939 film not been so good, I think more reviewers might have enjoyed this prequel for what it is.James Franco, like Fields would have been, is a sleazy operator as the Wizard. He does improve as the going gets tough, but even his friends still think he will fly the coop rather than risk his life in a showdown with two wicked witches. To his credit, he uses early 20th century technology to put on a dazzling performance that wins the day for the people of Oz. Other, more endearing characters include the china girl, the flying monkey, and the chief tinker. The three witches are well played and help set up the coming remake of the ""Wizard of Oz.""

In this film outing, Disney has revamped the franchise and created a prequel setting up how the Wizard ended up in Oz.  The movie is a mess.I honestly have not witnessed such poor acting in a big budget film, it is painful.  I can only assume they were coached in some odd way to present that comes across as stiff and unnatural.  Marco and Kunis in particular or just awful.  Mila Kunis gets a little better after her ""transition"" but all around poor performances.The film plods around with some dizzying special effects making for nice eye candy.  Typical of every Disney film, there is a ten minute segment which seems like an amusement ride (balloon crash).They plot line is so hacked that it feels like an endless montage of movies that have been done before.  Guy looking to find himself, gets thrust into overwhelming situation - check.  Helpless people waiting for ""special person"" to come save their sorry butts - check.  Super evil has overwhelming hordes of troops - check.  Witless hero rallies unlikely army and launches assault into certain doom - check.  Braveheart style troop speech - check and check.  Attack falls into disarray and everyone loses faith - check.  Hero pulls it out and saves day - check.  Refund please.In the end, my worst beef is that the movie just isn't any fun.  It is too dark for youngsters and I think would bore anyone who is over 12.  Not much of an audience left.  The one bright part of the entire movie is the China Town/China Girl.  An endearing moment in an otherwise rancid movie.Hollywood has become the disappointment factory in recent years and I cannot honestly understand why $200 million doesn't buy a decent writer or director.  Every time I see one of these mindless movies which no heart, inspiration or sense of humor.

It looked like the actors stood in front of a blue screen and read their lines. And that balloon crash was too long and boring. Same with the stupid flowers.I did like the idea of filling in the Wizard's back story. There were some wonderful nods to the original Oz (the books, not the famous movie) -- Baum circus, friend's name is Frank, including the china girl and the Quadlings, the emerald glasses, etc --  but all in all, a horrible insult. It was trite (black and white at the beginning, really? And a tornado? Again? Green witch?

As a prequel, this movie shouldn't exist (kind of like The Matrix, parts 2 & 3). There are so many reasons why The Wizard of Oz stands on its own, and doesn't need a back story. However, being that they chose to go there, here are a few reasons why this film falls short.For starters, Raimi attempted to replicate the feel of the original film's flow (black and white to color, Kansas characters showing up as Oz characters), and did so poorly--it felt more like copy catting, than an homage. Then there was the land of Oz. Here Raimi failed to capture the quaint fairytale environment of Oz, and instead decided to make it look like epic Whoville, from Ron Howard's horrible re-telling of How The Grinch Stole Christmas. The environments are extremely CG, with no organic texture, just a lot of bright colors and ""3D.""And the Wicked Witch--ugh, what a disappointment. First of all, I don't recall Margaret Hamilton wearing a bustier in the original, but maybe she ditched the Playboy Bunny look, when she realized she had no chance with the Wizard. I don't have a problem with the idea of the witch starting out as a befuddled, attractive young girl, who gets duped into the ""dark arts"" by her psychotic sister, but if you're going to go that route, casting an actress who can actually act wicked is a good place to start (Mila Kunis can't act AT ALL, so that should've been a red flag from the outset).There are a lot of little things I'll forgo mentioning, because I really don't have time to pick the movie apart, and I actually don't hate this film, it's just not memorable. The bottom line is this: there are certain classic, landmark films which SHOULD NEVER be re-made, re-booted, or expounded upon, and The Wizard of Oz is one of those films. But, if you just HAVE to see this movie, then go in expecting it to not live up to the 1939 original, and you might not be let down by such a large degree.",3,"Neither Oz, nor Great & Powerful--Discuss.",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,2084,"['Had', 'been', 'standalone', 'movie', 'mention', 'Oz', 'would', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'line', 'summer', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'like', 'Pirates', 'better', 'prequel', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'exist', 'kind', 'Matrix', 'parts', '2', '3', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'own', ""n't"", 'need', 'back', 'story', 'However', 'being', 'chose', 'go', 'there', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'short.For', 'starters', 'Raimi', 'attempted', 'replicate', 'feel', 'original', 'film', 'flow', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'Kansas', 'characters', 'showing', 'up', 'Oz', 'characters', 'did', 'so', 'poorly', 'felt', 'more', 'copy', 'catting', 'homage', 'Then', 'was', 'land', 'Oz', 'Here', 'Raimi', 'failed', 'capture', 'quaint', 'fairytale', 'environment', 'Oz', 'instead', 'decided', 'make', 'look', 'epic', 'Whoville', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'horrible', 're-telling', 'How', 'Grinch', 'Stole', 'Christmas', 'environments', 'are', 'extremely', 'CG', 'organic', 'texture', 'just', 'lot', 'bright', 'colors', '3D', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'ugh', 'what', 'disappointment', 'First', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'wearing', 'bustier', 'original', 'maybe', 'ditched', 'Playboy', 'Bunny', 'look', 'when', 'realized', 'had', 'chance', 'Wizard', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'idea', 'witch', 'starting', 'out', 'befuddled', 'attractive', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'duped', 'dark', 'arts', 'psychotic', 'sister', ""'re"", 'going', 'go', 'route', 'casting', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'wicked', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'AT', 'ALL', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'red', 'flag', 'outset', 'are', 'lot', 'little', 'things', ""'ll"", 'forgo', 'mentioning', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'pick', 'movie', 'apart', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'memorable', 'bottom', 'line', 'are', 'certain', 'classic', 'landmark', 'films', 'SHOULD', 'NEVER', 'be', 're-made', 're-booted', 'expounded', 'upon', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'HAVE', 'see', 'movie', 'then', 'go', 'expecting', 'not', 'live', 'up', '1939', 'original', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'such', 'large', 'degree']",N/A

While it would be impossible to completely capture the ambiance of the original WIZARD OF OZ, I still found OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL to be an enjoyable prequel. Good props and special effects, but it's hard to recreate Munchkinland, the Emerald City, and all the rest without making them seem like mere parodies of their originals. OGP has a solid plot-line, but again, it just needs something more, and I'm not, alas, sure what that something is (more development and explanation of the whole mythos of OZ, with a few flashbacks, perhaps?) The makers of this film had a lot to pack into 130 minutes, and some of the scenes are a bit hurried. It may also have been a mistake to echo Dorothy's later plight so closely, with the Wizard following the road to true OZ, picking up cohorts along the way. {Still, the little china girl is quite endearing.}As many have noted, Rachel Weisz truly steals the show as Evanora (the Wicked Witch of the East), who, interestingly enough, turns her sister Theodora (WW of the West, languidly played by Mila Kunis) green by giving her an apple of the same color reminiscent of the fatal fruit in Genesis. There are several other eccentricities of plot like this, and I would have welcomed a few more.Thematically speaking, it's not completely baked, but there's nevertheless a lot  to ponder if you're into it: the mirrors and bubblegum hoakum of the ""Wizard"" contrasted with the varying yet authentic powers of the witches, good, evil, and how the knowledge of same can make them what they are, etc. I've noticed a number of complaints about the lack of a truly good central character, but this lack is one of the biggest reasons why I like it. Everyone (not the least of which are the two wicked witches) has attractive, sympathetic qualities, and everyone (most of all, perhaps, the ""Wizard,"" but even Glinda the good witch) has their own little selfish agendas. If these aspects of the film interest you, I recommend reading Gregory Maguire's excellent novel,Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (Wicked Years), if you haven't already.Anyhoo, there are all sorts of reasons for liking and disliking this film, which is a good quality in itself. Although really young children may have some trouble following it, kids of all ages who aren't prone to ruthless over-analysis should  enjoy OGP pretty well just for the ride it gives.",4,"""I know I'm not the wizard you wanted, but I may just be the wizard you need""",1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,2477,"['Repeatedly', 'hearing', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'quite', 'while', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'completely', 'capture', 'ambiance', 'original', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'still', 'found', 'OZ', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'AND', 'POWERFUL', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'prequel', 'Good', 'props', 'special', 'effects', 'hard', 'recreate', 'Munchkinland', 'Emerald', 'City', 'rest', 'making', 'seem', 'mere', 'parodies', 'originals', 'OGP', 'solid', 'plot-line', 'again', 'just', 'something', 'more', ""'m"", 'not', 'alas', 'sure', 'what', 'something', 'more', 'development', 'explanation', 'whole', 'mythos', 'OZ', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'perhaps', 'makers', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'pack', '130', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'hurried', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'mistake', 'echo', 'Dorothy', 'later', 'plight', 'so', 'closely', 'Wizard', 'following', 'road', 'true', 'OZ', 'picking', 'up', 'cohorts', 'way', 'Still', 'little', 'china', 'girl', 'quite', 'endearing', 'many', 'have', 'noted', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'truly', 'show', 'Evanora', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'East', 'who', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'sister', 'Theodora', 'WW', 'West', 'languidly', 'played', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'green', 'giving', 'apple', 'same', 'color', 'reminiscent', 'fatal', 'fruit', 'Genesis', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'eccentricities', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'welcomed', 'few', 'more.Thematically', 'speaking', 'not', 'completely', 'baked', 'nevertheless', 'lot', 'ponder', ""'re"", 'mirrors', 'bubblegum', 'hoakum', 'Wizard', 'contrasted', 'varying', 'yet', 'authentic', 'powers', 'witches', 'good', 'evil', 'how', 'knowledge', 'same', 'can', 'make', 'what', 'are', 'etc', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'number', 'complaints', 'lack', 'truly', 'good', 'central', 'character', 'lack', 'one', 'biggest', 'reasons', 'why', 'Everyone', 'not', 'least', 'are', 'two', 'wicked', 'witches', 'attractive', 'sympathetic', 'qualities', 'everyone', 'most', 'perhaps', 'Wizard', 'even', 'Glinda', 'good', 'witch', 'own', 'little', 'selfish', 'agendas', 'aspects', 'film', 'interest', 'recommend', 'reading', 'Gregory', 'Maguire', 'excellent', 'novel', 'Wicked', 'Life', 'Times', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'Wicked', 'Years', 'have', ""n't"", 'already.Anyhoo', 'are', 'sorts', 'reasons', 'liking', 'disliking', 'film', 'good', 'quality', 'really', 'young', 'children', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'kids', 'ages', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'prone', 'ruthless', 'over-analysis', 'should', 'enjoy', 'OGP', 'pretty', 'well', 'just', 'ride']",N/A

Not a small feat considering the HUGE shoes it's trying to fill. The Wizard of Oz is one of the most well known and beloved films of all time.The story of how Oz came to be as we've know him all our lives is both a loving tribute to the original, but a refreshingly new take of the classic giving us all we could ask for, a new look at this magical land and a story that pleasingly fills in gaps in the original and breathes new life into the story.The cast is pretty much perfect blending together new and old. Franco playing the title character as a fast talking con artist/magician a charlatan/shyster of sorts is well suited for the role and by the end of the film I was cheering him on. Kunis, Weisz and Williams play the three witches with both nods to the original characters and offering us some new insight on what they may have been like in their younger days.I loved the way the film starts in full screen sepia tone and then goes to color like the original of course now the color sequence turns the film to grand widescreen presentation only making the change all the more dramatic. I'm a fan of the original(who isn't?) , but I must say this film will sit right along side of it and I may visit this prequel more often than the original ..especially since I've seen the original countless times.I haven't seen the 3D version and wish now that I had gone to the theater to see it. The Blu Ray looks fabulous and the detail to the land of Oz looks breathtaking. The China Doll from China Town is a stand out as one of the characters from a place in the book that didn't make the original movie. I can't see how any fan of the original wouldn't like this film, it offers what all remakes or continuations of films should offer something new without taking away anything from the original!My only gripe and reason for not giving this a 5 star rating is that the video release is filled with greed. To offer the DVD, Blu Ray and 3D Blu Ray on separate releases only is just ridiculous! If you want to recoup some sales in the home theater market then give consumers a reason to buy it!

It shares a number of themes and visuals with the older movie, including the nicely done black and white introduction that transitions into the stunningly colorful Land of Oz.The story beings in 1905 Kansas with a small-time circus magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco), Oz for short.  Oz is a con man, a charlatan, and a cad, but he might also be a man who wants to be better.  A balloon ride into a tornado dumps Oz in the Land of Oz.  There, he meets the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis), and learns that he is the fulfillment of a prophesy that a wizard would come from the skies to save the Land of Oz from an evil witch.Oz travels to the Emerald City, where he meets Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and is bribed into going after a third witch, the allegedly evil Glinda.  Along the way, he picks up as traveling companions the more or less helpful flying monkey Finley and a little girl made of china.  He will confront Glinda (Michelle Williams), only to find that he has been misled about the true state of affairs in Oz.  A reluctant Oz will be asked to help set things right.  Oz might not be the wizard they expected, but he might be the wizard they need.  The end is frightful and suspenseful, as Oz pits his illusions and misdirection against the real magic of the witches...James Franco does a nice job as a guy who allows himself to be talked into doing the right thing.  Michelle Williams does an equally nice job as the witch who sees Oz as he is, yet believes in the person he could become.

It has nothing on the prequel to the classic movie ""The Wizard of Oz,"" which came out almost 75 years after the original.Unfortunately, it's easy to see why ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" turned out to be a massive disappointment. It tries to coast on all the recognizable people and things from the original ""Wizard of Oz,"" in the hopes that you won't notice the tacky CGI, the lackluster acting and the plot composed almost entirely of cliches. In other words... pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.While escaping an angry husband, stage magician/con-man Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs (James Franco) escapes in a hot-air balloon and is sucked into a tornado. Of course, he arrives in the widescreen, Technicolor paradise of Oz.He is is quickly hailed by the witch sisters Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz) as the legendary wizard who will save them all by killing the Wicked Witch. Oz is more than happy to oblige, since success means he will become king of the Emerald City AND get a Scrooge McDuck vault filled with treasure. So he sets off to kill the Wicked Witch.Turns out Evanora is the true Wicked Witch, and the witch he's pursuing is the Good Witch Glinda (Michelle Williams). And with Evanora -- along with the newly-transformed, very angry Theodora -- preparing to assault Glinda's domain, Oz has to come up with a plan to defeat a pair of powerful witches, with an army of Tinkers, Munchkins and Quadlings. Can a wizard triumph without any magic?When you peel away the pyrotechnics and CGI, ""Oz The Great And Powerful"" doesn't have a lot of substance. It's yet another story about a con-man-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in Hollywood?) who is called upon to become a hero and reform himself. Every single aspect of this story is painfully predictable -- you can guess exactly what will happen all the time.In short, ""Oz"" feels sort of like a marshmallow peep: sweet and brightly colored, but empty of actual substance. And after consuming it for awhile, you start to feel a little queasy.It doesn't help that Sam Raimi's signature style is nowhere to be found -- it's smothered in a vast sea of giant CGI flowers and glossy, fake-looking panoramas. The movie is crammed full of unnecessary CGI (why do the evil witches FLY everywhere?) and references to things from the original movie... and yet, strangely, no ""ruby slippers"" origin story. There are also a couple of comic-relief sidekicks (a china girl and a talking monkey) who are inserted just for the comic relief -- and instead they make this rambling movie feel about twice as long as it actually is.But there are a few saving graces -- mostly James Franco and Rachel Weisz. Franco is oddly convincing (if a bit hammy) as a white-smiling wastrel who aspires to ""greatness,"" but who isn't such a bad guy after all. And while Weisz's character is OBVIOUSLY evil right from the start, she brings a brittle, charming energy to her character's outright evilness.On the other hand, Kunis is relentlessly awful. At first she's a simpering, prancing little girl just experiencing her first crush. But after her transformation, she shows her evilness by glaring at people and making your ears bleed with her screeching. Leave the screeching, posing and scenery-chewing to Margaret Hamilton.Williams is almost as bad. She plays the connivingly saccharine Glinda as a doe-eyed, sentimental damsel who seems pathetically weak and stupid compared to the powerful Wicked sisters. Seriously, she even gets captured by a pair of flying monkeys WHILE HOLDING HER WAND. Even Oz seems more magical than she does.""Oz The Great and Powerful"" tries to dazzle you with CGI and charm you with comic relief, but it doesn't flesh out a pitifully underdeveloped plot.",2,The great and powerful...

More like ""backside"" story.The quality is dreadful and I doubt seeing it on DVD will change that nasty experience - this looks like it was made for the SyFy Channel.

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[3, 9]","In book form, the marvelous land of Oz, like many fantasy worlds designed to appeal to children, is long on magic and short on sex.  In the books, L. Frank Baum takes pains to emphasize that in Oz, you can be just what age you want to be, and Ozma, Glinda, Dorothy, etc. prefer to stay kids.  Unlike Harry Potter, they sidestep puberty; however, in the latest ""Oz,"" movie, the witches are hot to trot, and lust exists alongside childlike wonder (an uneasy combo at best).  Imagine ""Oz"" as a CGI-heavy Sweet Valley High complete with mean girls, nice girls and a guy who really isn't worth all the fighting over him, and you have ""Oz: The Great and Powerful.""So would this version make Baum gyrate in his grave?  Well, if the seriously traumatic ""Return to Oz,"" hadn't already given him a workout back in 1985, I'd say yes, but in comparison ""Oz: The Great and Powerful,"" is pretty tame.  James Franco plays Oscar Diggs, a compulsive liar, ladies' man and showman, who travels with a Kansas circus circa 1900.  In order to avoid the consequences of his actions, he hops a hot air balloon and crashes in Oz, where he is believed to be the long-awaited savior who can defeat the ""Wicked"" Witch  (really Michelle Williams, who is blond, angelic and looks as if she's just swallowed a lemon) and rule Oz.  In reality, Michelle is the Good Witch, and the two sisters who rule the Emerald City (Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis) are Evil (they`re brunette, see).  Oz doesn't have any genuine magic, but he sure knows how to put on a show, and will this be enough for good to triumph?  That's a tough one, folks.I enjoyed the movie, though. Franco comes off like an amiable big brother who's been coerced into taking part in his kid sisters' play, and the supporting cast does a decent job with a so-so script. The effects are truly - magical?  Well, more or less.  By the way, here's an idea for the sequel.  Back in Kansas, Franco is incarcerated in a mental hospital and threatened with a lobotomy if he doesn't stop prattling about Oz.  Then he hears a knock, and in comes a hot blonde nurse who looks familiar - and helps him escape. Well, maybe we don't need to equate imagination with mental illness again and scar another generation of kids.

It managed to more than make back its production cost and will be followed up by the inevitable sequel. Sam Raimi's prequel to the 1939 classic now hits Blu-ray and DVD, giving audiences either another chance to see it for the first time or give it a second look in the comfort of their own homes.In ""Oz: The Great and Powerful,"" a crooked circus magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) is swept away to a magical land. Upon arriving, he is mistaken as the mystical wizard who is foretold to be the deliverer of its people from the grasp of an evil witch (Rachel Weisz). In order to free them from her clutches, he must steal her magic wand. Oscar embarks on a dangerous journey to find the witch. He's accompanied by a flying monkey (Zach Braff) and a china doll (Joey King) on his adventures through the whimsical and dangerous land.As I said in my earlier theatrical review, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" uses every aspect of the original ""Wizard of Oz"" movie it can legally get away with. You don't see any ruby slippers and the Wicked Witch's skin is a different tone of green, but believes me that's about all that's missing. The Wizard's Throne Room and even his fiery appearance to others will remind you of the 1939 film.It's obvious from the beginning of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" that Director Sam Raimi has one goal in mind. He wants to create something new out of the framework of the original film. Raimi wants his movie to be looked at as the ""official"" prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz."" Although it's technically ""unofficial,"" the filmmaker was successful in his attempt.The cast of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" deliver energetic performances. Some critics have shared their unhappiness with James Franco and Mila Kunis in their respective roles, but I found both of them to be taking their characters seriously. Everyone in the film seems intent on helping Raimi bring his vision of Oz to life as an homage and worthy follow-up to the 1939 classic.The CGI for ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" could be better. Much of it looks artificial and animated. At the same time, this could be the intent of Raimi to possibly give it a dreamlike or unrealistic look. The colors used throughout the film are vibrant and lend a sort of cheerful air to the film.""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is presented in 1080p High Definition Widescreen (2.40:1). However, the beginning plays in 1.33:1 and black and white to mimic how the 1939 film started and then turned to color. The picture is clean and shines brightly with all the lush greenery Oz travels through and shiny gold he's inherited as the Wizard.

1642091,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00C5W3SBE,FNDNreview,"[8, 17]","Directed by Sam Raimi (Spider-Man, The Evil Dead), Oz: the Great and Powerful stars James Franco as Oscar Diggs (Oz), a mediocre circus magician that is swept up in a Kansas tornado and dropped in the Land of Oz.  After his arrival in Oz, Oscar is told by three different witches that he&#8217;s the prophesized wizard that&#8217;s meant to restore order to the Land of Oz and defeat The Wicked Witch of the West (Mila Kunis) and her evil sister, The Wicked Witch of the East (Rachel Weisz).  With the help of the Good Witch, Glinda (Michelle Williams), Oz must find a way to restore order and defeat the evil witches before they enslave the good people of Oz.  Zach Braff and Joey King lend their voices for the film, while Tony Cox and Bill Cobbs also serve in supporting roles.Despite the fact this film relies too much on CGI (and we will get to that), not everything is bad about this new re-imagination of Oz.  In fact, it&#8217;s quite the enjoyable film &#8211; starting with the cast.  Now, he&#8217;s no Judy Garland, but James Franco is a surprisingly good fit for the role of Oscar Diggs (The Wizard), with his sly charm and ulterior motives.  This is a character that hasn&#8217;t found his way yet, but he&#8217;s clearly searching to be something more than he is &#8211; a relatable trait for many of us.  As far as the rest of the cast goes, Michelle Williams has always done a tremendous job of playing the &#8220;girl next door,&#8221; so she fits in perfectly as the innocent, good witch.  On the other hand, both Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis made for two incredibly lackluster witches.  Kunis does her best Wicked Witch of the West impression, but falls so far short of the mark that you can&#8217;t help but hope she&#8217;s recast in the event of a sequel (which already has a green light, if the box office numbers are promising).Casting aside, the visual effects were just downright disappointing and overused.  The colors were beautiful, but they just didn&#8217;t flow properly with this fairy tale.  Perhaps, that&#8217;s just the classic Wizard of Oz holding me back.  Yes, this film was a perfect candidate for 3D, with all of its wild flowers and flying monkeys, but having an abundance of CGI ALWAYS takes away from the story &#8211; not to mention it&#8217;s uncomfortable to see an actor (Franco) trying to imagine tiny CGI water fairies biting your leg.  Don&#8217;t feel bad Mr. Franco, this is one of the biggest problems in film today.  In any event, the film&#8217;s beginning (20 minutes or so) was the most notable due to the throwback black and white 4:3 aspect ratio.  For a few minutes there, it actually felt like Kansas in 1905.Even though this film is entertaining, the film itself currently stands for everything wrong in the land of movies.  By no means is this film an outstanding achievement of any kind, but it does manage to throw in a few references to the classic film.  Unfortunately, the film serves only one purpose:  to feed the money-hungry Hollywood beast by using the good name of The Wizard of Oz.  If nothing else, perhaps watching Oz: the Great and Powerful will inspire a new generation to watch one of the greatest films of all-time, the 1939 version of The Wizard of Oz.Overall Film Grade:  C+FNDNreview.com",3,"'Oz' entertaining, but no classic",1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,3273,"['Directed', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'stars', 'James', 'Franco', 'Oscar', 'Diggs', 'Oz', 'mediocre', 'circus', 'magician', 'swept', 'up', 'Kansas', 'tornado', 'dropped', 'Land', 'Oz', 'arrival', 'Oz', 'Oscar', 'told', 'three', 'different', 'witches', '8217', 's', 'prophesized', 'wizard', '8217', 'meant', 'restore', 'order', 'Land', 'Oz', 'defeat', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'evil', 'sister', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'East', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'help', 'Good', 'Witch', 'Glinda', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Oz', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'restore', 'order', 'defeat', 'evil', 'witches', 'enslave', 'good', 'people', 'Oz', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Joey', 'King', 'lend', 'voices', 'film', 'Tony', 'Cox', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'also', 'serve', 'supporting', 'roles.Despite', 'fact', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'CGI', 'will', 'get', 'not', 'everything', 'bad', 'new', 're-imagination', 'Oz', 'fact', '8217', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'film', '8211', 'starting', 'cast', 'Now', '8217', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'James', 'Franco', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'fit', 'role', 'Oscar', 'Diggs', 'Wizard', 'sly', 'charm', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'character', '8217', 'found', 'way', 'yet', '8217', 'clearly', 'searching', 'be', 'something', 'more', '8211', 'relatable', 'trait', 'many', 'As', 'far', 'rest', 'cast', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'always', 'done', 'tremendous', 'job', 'playing', '8220', 'next', 'door', '8221', 'perfectly', 'innocent', 'good', 'witch', 'other', 'hand', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'made', 'two', 'incredibly', 'lackluster', 'witches', 'Kunis', 'best', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'impression', 'so', 'far', 'short', 'mark', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'hope', '8217', 's', 'recast', 'event', 'sequel', 'already', 'green', 'light', 'box', 'office', 'numbers', 'are', 'promising', '.Casting', 'aside', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'just', 'downright', 'disappointing', 'overused', 'colors', 'were', 'beautiful', 'just', 'didn', '8217', 'flow', 'properly', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Perhaps', '8217', 'just', 'classic', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'holding', 'back', 'Yes', 'film', 'was', 'perfect', 'candidate', '3D', 'wild', 'flowers', 'flying', 'monkeys', 'having', 'abundance', 'CGI', 'ALWAYS', 'away', 'story', '8211', 'not', 'mention', '8217', 'uncomfortable', 'see', 'actor', 'Franco', 'trying', 'imagine', 'tiny', 'CGI', 'water', 'fairies', 'biting', 'leg', 'Don', '8217', 'feel', 'bad', 'Mr.', 'Franco', 'one', 'biggest', 'problems', 'film', 'today', 'event', 'film', '8217', 'beginning', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'was', 'most', 'notable', 'due', 'throwback', 'black', 'white', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'few', 'minutes', 'there', 'actually', 'felt', 'like', 'Kansas', '1905.Even', 'film', 'entertaining', 'film', 'currently', 'everything', 'wrong', 'land', 'movies', 'means', 'film', 'outstanding', 'achievement', 'kind', 'manage', 'throw', 'few', 'references', 'classic', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'purpose', 'feed', 'money-hungry', 'Hollywood', 'beast', 'using', 'good', 'name', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'nothing', 'else', 'perhaps', 'watching', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'will', 'inspire', 'new', 'generation', 'watch', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'all-time', '1939', 'version', 'Wizard', 'Oz.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'C+FNDNreview.com']",N/A

Of course, this movie is attempting to follow in some big shoes, as it is difficult to compete with the orginal classic that so many of us have grown up with and loved over the years.  Still, it is fascinating to return again to the Land of Oz and see more of it than ever before.Oz (his stage name) is, of course, the magician who will eventually become the famed Wizard of Oz.  The beginning of the movie gives some of his background and plays off the ""Wizard of Oz"" by being in smaller-frame and black and white.  Once we get to Oz, however, the screen expands and the colors are fabulous...all you could expect.  There are also shades of people he knows back in Kansas as Oz picks up companions along the way, and makes a few nasty enemies, including our favorite green-skinned Wicked Witch.Loved the tornado scene, even though this is one of the changes made from the original story.  Despite these changes, Oz does pay homage to a certain extent to the original, and offers some insights into how things got to where they are (there are hints of the scarecrow and a potential clue about the cowardly lion), but some of the plot was a shade too simplistic and predictible.As a lover of Oz, this movie is a plus all the same...and I wouldn't be without it.  But as a stand-alone movie it doesn't work as well.  Perhaps, the choice in actor for the lead character might have been better, because I must admit that he didn't seem capable of carrying this movie in light of the special effects and the far more dramatic characters of the Witches and the land of Oz itself.Could have been a great movie if the characters had been given as much work as the special effects.

Denick,"[1, 2]","Imagine my surprise, when I sat down to watch this movie with no notion of what it was about (prequel, reboot, sequel, remake?), only to find a delightgfully funny precursor to the events of the classic ""Wizard of Oz"". But what's far more surprising is that Raimi has taken this golden opportunity and done something that simply boggles the mind- he has created a companion piece to 1993's low budget cult classic (and Bruce Campbell's most famous movie), ""Army of Darkness"". This is utterly hilarious for so many reasons, I don't even know where to begin or how to properly describe the majesty of this elaborate joke.(MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW)Raimi duplicates several iconic scenes, which shall not be mentioned here, for fear of major spoilers, though I can safely reveal that some of these involve gunpowder and winged creatures. He even goes so far as to throw in some of the old AOD lines, such as ""Hold... hold...!"" during another scene which I cannot detail any further, again for fear of spoilers. Additionally, the stories are remarkably similar, insofar as we have a displaced outsider arriving in a strange land, being hailed as a savior, exposed as a fraud, and then relying on his wits and resourcefulness to lead a ragtag force against an army of overwhelming strength and evil... an army of ""darkness"", one might even say. Heck, he even gets Danny Elfman to compose the original score for Oz (the same musician who wrote AOD's brilliant soundtrack), and he sneaks Bruce Campbell into the movie, as a final nod to his old school fans.However, Raimi by no means shorted the Oz fans or its enormous legacy (in my humble opinion, anyway). He did fine justice to the Oz legacy, paying homage to that immortal source, while modernizing it and adding his own, humorous flair. James Franco is perfect as the young, irreverent, charming, and highly flawed Oz, bringing this story to life in a way that is nothing short of magical. Diehard fans of the classic may be disappointed (which is inevitable when tackling such an old, revered piece), but I honestly feel that if you go into this movie with an open mind, an open heart, and a willingness to laugh at all things silly, you will have a wonderful time.",5,Surprise!

A few shots within a scene would have good 3D depth but other shots seemed flat. If I paused the movie, the frame lost its 3D appearance. I have never had that happen with another video. The first views of the Emerald City looked like it was painted on a large canvas. No 3D depth at all. Mila Kunis' character seemed unemotional even when saying &#34;the prophecy is true&#34;. She did improve later on in the film. There were many blatant violations of the Laws of Physics. I do not mean things like flying critters and such. I do not want to spoil the plot but several things happen that would require people to be visible to the &#34;enemy&#34; prior to them &#34;surprising the enemy&#34;. Also, a projected image on a screen/cloud cannot &#34;see&#34; someone moving in front of them. So the projected person looking down to their left would not be able to see the movement, yet the character interacts as if they ARE seeing what is happening in front of their face. This is commonly done on TV shows with a person on a laptop screen seemingly &#34;looking&#34; at people to one side of the computer as if the they could see them. They can only see where the camera is aimed. In this occurance, people standing all around the cloud screen are seeing exactly the same image no matter where they are relative to the projector. That can't even happen with a hologram much less traditional movie projection.There was a lot of talk of killing as if it was no big deal. Characters eagerly joined up without understanding why the intended victim SHOULD be killed. There were a couple of funny moments but the major theme was of impending doom and annihilation. I never understood what caused the feud between the Main characters in the first place. But obviously killed people was the ONLY solution. As in the Batman Movies, OZ the Great and Powerful is starkly different  from the original Wizard of OZ. The original Batman TV show and Wizard of Oz were fun, happy and comical. Their Movie incarnations are dark, dreary and full of evil. I long for the days of happy characters having fun and adventures on the big screen. Positive role models.

How was a Kansas carnival magician declared ruler of a city and how did the wicked witches... well, become wicked? The problem with a prequel is that everyone is limited by the knowledge of what is coming. You know Glinda and the Wizard will live. Heck you know the witches will live until someone drops a farm house on one of them so there isn't a lot of tension that way.Oz is a charlatan and a con man who the audience knows has to find a core of goodness with in him in order to turn and make a stand. The problem is the first half of the film, before he starts thinking of someone other than himself is almost painful to watch with the leads massively overacting as if they are giving stage performances in a holiday panto instead of on a movie screen. By the 2nd half of the screen you do start to care about the characters but by then you are so worn out by the 1st half that you almost resent it-why couldn't you have done this well earlier?Parts of the film were clearly designed to show off the 3d effect in the sort of way we're coming to realize is trying to make up for poor quality story telling and once you've twigged on to that point you're not so much going `wow! "" and ""Ooh"" as you are ""Ok we get it , get on with it!"" A great deal of this does work well and looks good but the director should have had more attention on his actors and less relying on the effects.The two effects that do work well are also the best and most consistent characters- the china doll and a flying monkey. Likewise the one character you feel sorry for, even as she overacts, is Mila Kunis' witch because you know what her fate will be and resent how she's maneuvered into it.In the end this is neither good nor bad, it just is and I guess after so much hype and hope, the final feeling was one of disappointment at the missed opportunity.",3,Disappointing,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,2136,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'having', 'missed', 'theatres', 'having', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'DVD', 'anticipation', 'made', 'disappointment', 'even', 'worse.Written', 'prequel', '1939', 'wonderful', 'wizard', 'OZ', 'out', 'explain', 'how', 'world', 'discovered', 'Dorothy', 'Gale', 'came', 'be', 'How', 'was', 'Kansas', 'carnival', 'magician', 'declared', 'ruler', 'city', 'how', 'did', 'wicked', 'witches', 'well', 'become', 'wicked', 'problem', 'prequel', 'everyone', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'what', 'coming', 'know', 'Glinda', 'Wizard', 'will', 'live', 'Heck', 'know', 'witches', 'will', 'live', 'someone', 'farm', 'house', 'one', 'so', ""n't"", 'lot', 'tension', 'way.Oz', 'charlatan', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'audience', 'find', 'core', 'goodness', 'order', 'turn', 'make', 'stand', 'problem', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'thinking', 'someone', 'other', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'leads', 'massively', 'overacting', 'are', 'giving', 'stage', 'performances', 'holiday', 'instead', 'movie', 'screen', '2nd', 'half', 'screen', 'do', 'start', 'care', 'characters', 'then', 'are', 'so', 'worn', 'out', '1st', 'half', 'almost', 'resent', 'it-why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'well', 'earlier', 'Parts', 'film', 'were', 'clearly', 'designed', 'show', 'off', '3d', 'effect', 'sort', 'way', ""'re"", 'coming', 'realize', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'poor', 'quality', 'story', 'telling', 'once', ""'ve"", 'twigged', 'point', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'wow', 'Ooh', 'are', 'Ok', 'get', 'get', 'A', 'great', 'deal', 'work', 'well', 'good', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'attention', 'actors', 'less', 'relying', 'effects.The', 'two', 'effects', 'do', 'work', 'well', 'are', 'also', 'best', 'most', 'consistent', 'characters-', 'china', 'doll', 'flying', 'monkey', 'Likewise', 'one', 'character', 'feel', 'sorry', 'even', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'witch', 'know', 'what', 'fate', 'will', 'be', 'resent', 'how', 'maneuvered', 'it.In', 'end', 'neither', 'good', 'bad', 'just', 'guess', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'hope', 'final', 'feeling', 'was', 'one', 'disappointment', 'missed', 'opportunity']",N/A

You can literally watch this film and the other in succession and it won't seem like a break in continuity, visually or otherwise.There is no feeling that anyone behind the scenes of this new film had the misguided notion to make you forget what came before. You can love this movie and also still hold the MGM one in the highest regard. This is a prequel, so you can watch the `39 film after it and they'll both fit together nicely.On Blu-ray, Oz the Great and Powerful glows like the Emerald City. And though is might have seemed overlong to some in theaters, it does not seem that way in the home environment. Like MGM's Oz, I think this film will become a home re-watching favorite.Since Oz the Great and Powerful seems to have been an big international success, the best thing is that sequels might give us more glimpses into an Oz that has usually been only in Baum's 14 books. More, more, more!I would love to have had an audio commentary among the bonus features, but features are still in abundance, especially on the Blu-ray.These bonus features are on the DVD and the Blu-ray:* Walt Disney and the Road to OzOriginal Mouseketeers Doreen Tracey and Bobby Burgess, along with historians Les Perkins, Howard Green and myself trace the story of the Disney connections with Oz from the `30s to today, particularly focusing on the film spectacular that Walt never completed: The Rainbow Road to Oz, using rare artifacts seen publicly for the first time here.* BloopersA good feature for parents of small children who might be frightened at the Wicked Witch, since this shows how they are all actors pretending and can act silly in costume.Blu-ray Exclusive Features* Mr. Elfman's Music ConcoctionsDanny Elfman takes you through the process of scoring Oz the Great and Powerful, which he calls one of the best experiences of his career.* Mila's MetamorphosisAnother way to show children that the Witch is make believe and the lady playing her is really still a nice person.* China Girl and the Suspension of DisbeliefI loved the China Girl! She had a nice Rankin/Bass and Bil Baird look, and an attitude much like our little five year old cousin Lydia. Also, the China City is one of several sections in Baum's book that never made it to the big screen.* Before Your Very Eyes: From Kansas to OzProduction Designer Robert Stromberg shows how the film is as much done in classic Hollywood style with real sets and effects in addition to green screen, and most importantly, how his enthusiasm for such Disney classics as Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, Pinocchio and Bambi infused the look of Oz the Great and Powerful.Other features, depending on which package you choose:* Second ScreenFollow Finley and the magic tricks through the entire movie with select iPads.* Digital CopyUsing the enclosed code, you can add points to your Disney Movie Rewards and download a complimentary copy of the movie to your computer or smart phone.",5,"Franco, Kunis, Williams...and even Walt Disney himself journey to Oz",1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,3523,"['film', 'ever', 'been', 'completely', 'successful', 'financially', 'critically', 'revisiting', 'Land', 'Oz', 'grand', 'shadow', '1939', 'classic', 'still', 'strong', 'hearts', 'fact', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'done', 'so', 'become', 'international', 'hit', 'small', 'accomplishment.Garland', 'Oz', 'indelibly', 'inscribed', 'popular', 'culture', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'Rather', 'foolishly', 'try', 'replace', 'minds', 'reinvent', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'builds', 'fondness', 'story', 'remarkably', 'skillful', 'way', 'melds', 'nicely', 'other', 'version', 'can', 'literally', 'watch', 'film', 'other', 'succession', 'wo', ""n't"", 'seem', 'break', 'continuity', 'visually', 'feeling', 'anyone', 'scenes', 'new', 'film', 'had', 'misguided', 'notion', 'make', 'forget', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'can', 'love', 'movie', 'also', 'still', 'hold', 'MGM', 'one', 'highest', 'regard', 'prequel', 'can', 'watch', '39', 'film', ""'ll"", 'fit', 'together', 'nicely.On', 'Blu-ray', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'glows', 'Emerald', 'City', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'overlong', 'theaters', 'not', 'seem', 'way', 'home', 'environment', 'MGM', 'Oz', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'become', 'home', 're-watching', 'favorite.Since', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'international', 'success', 'best', 'thing', 'sequels', 'might', 'give', 'more', 'glimpses', 'Oz', 'usually', 'been', 'only', 'Baum', '14', 'books', 'More', 'more', 'more', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'had', 'audio', 'commentary', 'bonus', 'features', 'features', 'are', 'still', 'abundance', 'especially', 'Blu-ray.These', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', '*', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Road', 'OzOriginal', 'Mouseketeers', 'Doreen', 'Tracey', 'Bobby', 'Burgess', 'historians', 'Les', 'Perkins', 'Howard', 'Green', 'trace', 'story', 'Disney', 'connections', 'Oz', '30s', 'today', 'particularly', 'focusing', 'film', 'spectacular', 'Walt', 'never', 'completed', 'Rainbow', 'Road', 'Oz', 'using', 'rare', 'artifacts', 'seen', 'publicly', 'first', 'time', 'here', '*', 'BloopersA', 'good', 'feature', 'parents', 'small', 'children', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'frightened', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'how', 'are', 'actors', 'pretending', 'can', 'act', 'silly', 'costume.Blu-ray', 'Exclusive', 'Features*', 'Mr.', 'Elfman', 'Music', 'ConcoctionsDanny', 'Elfman', 'process', 'scoring', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'one', 'best', 'experiences', 'career', 'Mila', 'MetamorphosisAnother', 'way', 'show', 'children', 'Witch', 'make', 'believe', 'lady', 'playing', 'really', 'still', 'nice', 'person', '*', 'China', 'Girl', 'Suspension', 'DisbeliefI', 'loved', 'China', 'Girl', 'had', 'nice', 'Rankin/Bass', 'Bil', 'Baird', 'look', 'attitude', 'much', 'little', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'cousin', 'Lydia', 'Also', 'China', 'City', 'one', 'several', 'sections', 'Baum', 'book', 'never', 'made', 'big', 'screen', '*', 'Very', 'Eyes', 'Kansas', 'OzProduction', 'Designer', 'Robert', 'Stromberg', 'how', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'done', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'real', 'sets', 'effects', 'addition', 'green', 'screen', 'most', 'importantly', 'how', 'enthusiasm', 'such', 'Disney', 'classics', 'Snow', 'White', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Pinocchio', 'Bambi', 'infused', 'look', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful.Other', 'features', 'depending', 'package', 'choose', '*', 'Second', 'ScreenFollow', 'Finley', 'magic', 'tricks', 'entire', 'movie', 'select', 'iPads', '*', 'Digital', 'CopyUsing', 'enclosed', 'code', 'can', 'add', 'points', 'Disney', 'Movie', 'Rewards', 'download', 'complimentary', 'copy', 'movie', 'computer', 'smart', 'phone']",N/A

I mean, the movie doesn't even have a release date yet.If very few or, better yet, NO pre-orders for the 3d are placed, the studio will forget this idea.

1642133,A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B00C5W3SBE,"Jacki ""Jack Mueller""","[14, 28]","The Sam Raimi team does not deliver a film that follows the mythology found in the Oz books.  Nor does the Raimi team deliver a film that captures the darkness and scariness found in the novels.  This is sad because even the silent films from the 1910s capture more of the darkness found in those stories.  And one would expect the director of the original ""Evil Dead"" to be able to deliver a dark Oz film, but ""Return to Oz"" from 1985 retains its crown as being the best film to capture the books' darkness and to follow their mythology.""Oz the Great and Powerful"" pays tribute to the 1939 film by following its mythology and only incorporating a few elements of the Oz novels.  What results is a film that is too light hearted with a poor storyline.  If the mythology from the books had been followed, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" would have been darker with a strong story of saving Oz from oppressors.  Anyone who has read the Oz book knows though L. Frank Baum wrote children's stories, Oz stories are dark, scary, and several of the film adaptations would receive PG-13 ratings.  But ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" ignored the books' mythology.  So for people who are looking for a fantasy that is dark and full of skirmishes, read the Oz novels and hope another film reboot will make such a delivery.After months of interviews where Raimi stated he reviewed the Oz novels as sources of back story for this new film, one would have expected ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" to be more original in its delivery and less of a copy of the 1939 film.  This does not occur, and its delivery is pretty much a copy of that film.  ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" goes from black and white to color, introduces Kansas characters that will later be re-imaged in the Land of Oz, focuses too much on 3-D aspects, and has female characters that are too passive.  One would expect the portrayal of women to be passive during the 1930s, but in the 2010s one expects women to be aggressive and to display self reliance as they make intelligent decisions.This misrepresentation of Oz women is nothing new.  The 1939 film did a horrible job at accurately portraying female characters.  Judy Garland played Dorothy as being too scared and dainty.  It was not until 1985 that Dorothy Gale's personage was given justice by the actress Fairuza Balk.  She accurately displayed Dorothy Gale's lack of fear, ability to command others, and willingness to take risks in order to carry out her objectives.  It of course helped that Fairuza Balk had actually read the Oz books and that allowed her to accurately portray Dorothy.  All the women in that film displayed courage and headstrong attitudes while obtaining their goals.  And that is just how L. Frank Baum describes those women.Unfortunately, the women in this new Oz film are not represented in such a manner.  Most of them are represented as having to consent with a man before making any decisions.  Or they do not portray the personage L. Frank Baum describes in his novels and thus misrepresent important characters.  Particularly the portrayal of Glinda is very disappointing.  She is not as clever or as self determined as she should be and in the film she is captured way too easily.The only character to accurately depict personalities from the Oz books is China Girl and that allows her to steal the scene on numerous occasions.  China Girl is very intelligent, knows how to manipulate others so she may obtain her desires, talks back, and does not scare easily.  Computer generation of China Girl is excellent and is far above any other use of computer for the film.  Any other time computer generation is used, it screams fake.  The winged monkeys only look neat from a far away distance because close-ups depict them as too cartoonish.Aside from the fact that mythology from the Oz novels does not depict the Land of Oz for this film, the most disappointing depiction in the film is the birth of the Wicked Witch of the West.  Mila Kunis acts wonderfully, but that does not help her with poor makeup used to portray the witch nor does her acting help represent the witch as being self reliant.  SPOILER: the witch is born due to a man breaking her heart and L. Frank Baum would never have written the witch in such a manner.  The witches L. Frank Baum writes about were always wicked, are independent, are clever tricksters, and are willing to kill those who oppose them.An accurate representation of the Wicked Witch of the West would have involved her always being wicked but taking human form as a way to trick the wizard into trusting her.  From the onset, the Wicked Witch of the West would have been plotting to kill the wizard and would have enchanted creatures and plant life to kill him as he journeyed to Glinda.  Not only does this representation not occur, the representation of the Land of Oz does not even depict the presence of Kalidahs, giant spiders, killer crows, or killer wolves.  One wonders if those skirmishes will ever make into an Oz film.The acting for the film is good, but that does not help save the film's storyline.  Back story is given through dialogue but it is unclear about how the witches conquered the Emerald City.  The back story explains the need for a wizard to end oppression but the oppression is not accurately represented.  The audience does not know why the witches are oppressing the people, nor do they witness it, and they only see the aftermath.  There should have been scenes depicting the Emerald City in ruins and a lot more scenes displaying the people's devastation and demands for a new ruler.  But this depiction does not occur and one must actually read the Oz novels to truly comprehend why a wizard is needed to rule the Emerald City.In conclusion, the Raimi team has failed to deliver a good Oz film and should not make another.  A director and film team is needed who actually incorporate the mythology and personages from the Oz books.  This will give the films better storylines and of course make them dark with several scary scenes and plenty of skirmishes.  Until that happens, one wonders if the next Oz films:Will have Dorothy Gale obtain silver slippers?Will the Wicked Witch of the West say her infamous command: ""peck out their eyes and rip them to pieces""?Will Mombi be forced to reveal she has kidnapped and hidden Princess Ozma?Will Glinda use her army to recapture the Emerald City from an insurgency?Will the Schoodlers capture Dorothy and her companions in order to eat them?And can fans of the books truly enjoy new Oz films or will they be left to only treasure the novels and the ""Return to Oz"" film?Answers to these questions are very unclear because it can now be declared that the latest film reboot of the Oz stories is not following the novels' mythology.  A reboot that is true to the world of L. Frank Baum would actually require a first film that tells the story of four wicked witches conquering the Land of Oz and hiding its true heirs.  A second film would depict the process of the wizard and Glinda removing two of the witches from power and founding the Emerald City.  A third film would be an adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and films that follow would keep depicting stories where the Emerald City faces numerous insurrections and invasions which require Glinda to find the lost heirs of Oz.One can hope the next Oz films will shift more into the books' mythology thus creating films that are dark and will just be teetering at receiving a PG-13 rating.  Anyone who has read The Wonderful Wizard of Oz knows that a true film adaptation would be rated PG-13.  Fingers crossed, in hopes that film will at least depict Dorothy Gale in the same manner L. Frank Baum describes her.  Dorothy needs to be a plain looking preteen or a young looking teenager who is clever, does not scare easily, and talks back with some attitude.Three candidates come to mind that could pull off a good Dorothy Gale.  The 2010 version of ""True Grit"" reveals that actress Hailee Steinfeld would give justice to the character.  Her portrayal of Mattie Ross in ""True Grit"" demonstrates Steinfeld has the skill to assume the personage of Dorothy Gale because the characters of Mattie Ross and Dorothy Gale are quite similar.  Another candidate is actually Joey King.  Her portrayal of China Girl in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is so good; it is not out of the question to have Joey King play Dorothy.  Finally there is Chlo Grace Moretz.  Her portrayal of the comic book character Hit Girl demonstrates that Moretz has the skill to act tough and brave, as well as be sarcastic during times of peril.  All of those character traits are crucial to accurately portraying Dorothy Gale.Only time will tell if Dorothy Gale and other characters from the Land of Oz and the Land of Ev are going to be represented in a manner that is true to the Oz books.  One can hope that if the Raimi team is not going to make such an attempt, other film makers will with another reboot.  When that happens, perhaps book fans will finally get to see the Mouse Queen save Dorothy and her companions and witness the Cowardly Lion confront the Kalidahs.  It has been one hundred and thirteen years since The Wonderful Wizard of Oz depicted these skirmishes and book fans are still waiting to see them in an Oz film.",1,"Sorry Book Fans, Wait for Another

Never in his wildest dreams (and I'll bet his were pretty wild) could he have imagined such a mind-bending, visual orgy! We are treated to a combination of PG-rated, Computer Generated overkill, truly scary flying monsters (waaaay worse than those flying monkeys in the original), a pep talk on teamwork and a lovely homage to the MGM classic (the title sequence and the first scenes set in a two-bit Kansas carnival are in black and white).As you probably already know, this prequel shows how a cheesy con man became the man behind the curtain.We see:* James Franco (""127 Hours"") is Oscar Diggs, otherwise known as Oz, who is described as a ""small-time magician with dubious ethics."" I liked his Scrooge McDuck dive into that tempting pile of gold.* Zach Braff (""Garden State"") is our hero's sidekick, both as a much-abused human assistant in the black and white carnival and as a (cute but much-abused) flying monkey instructed to ""Show up. Keep up. Shut up!"" in Oz.* Mila Kunis (""Black Swan"") eventually becomes Theodora, the Wicked Witch of the West. They worked it out so her profile is the same as Margaret Hamilton's in the original.* Rachel Weisz (""Agora"") is Evanora, a witch I don't recall from the earlier movie, but I'm sure she must be in the Baum series. Somehow I skipped reading them when I was a child.* Michelle Williams (""My Week With Marilyn"") is Annie, a young woman our hero is infatuated with in Kansas, but when she shows up as Glinda in Oz, he is confused.* Bill Cobbs (""The Muppets"") is the handyman/tinkerer who becomes essential to The Plan.* Joey King (""Ramona and Beezus"") is the little crippled Kansas girl in the wheelchair (sad), and in Oz, the China doll with the broken legs (get it?).This is entertaining and colorful, but those flying beasts have fangs, the two evil witches shoot flaming missiles from their hands and the balloon ride is pretty scary.

Frank Baums book THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ, and I loved the MGM version as well though manychanges were made to the story.  In the book, OZ is a real place, not a dream.  But the marvelous production by MGM was so gooda person cannot quibble over little changes.  Magical, surreal, beautifully filmed and acted, and a wonderful cast as well.  I thoughtBert Larr really stole the film; funny, loveable and yet heroic,  In my opinion this film, now owned by Warner Bros, was MGMs finesthour (or should I say 2 hours).  Warners even talked about a remake with the original script.  I do not suggest that, but perhapsadded Oz tales from later books could be done.This new film is good, well photographed, good special effects and the cast was ok though I thought the witches were rather sexy.But I only gave it three stars because first it suffers from what all pre-sequels suffer with and that is we already know what is goingto happen in the future.  There are no surprises in this one, though the settings of Oz are quite beautiful.  I know they were tryingto be faithful to the MGM version yet updating  the original with motion pictures new technologies.  That works ok, but I still thinkthere was not enough originality in the story.

I know it is unfair to compare it to the original, but if you are going to make a prequel to the &#34;wizard of oz&#34; about the wizard, it needs to at least have the same fun into transporting you to the another land. James Franco does a good job as the man behind the curtain, but he seems to be too laid back to be a good enough con artist/show man. His lack of wonder at being in a completely magical land and the lack of growth he displays from being a flim-flam man to becoming the great and powerful oz seems rushed. Michelle Williams, who plays Glenda - the good witch, seems to be the only one who had fun with her role. I thought her playing good witch would be a one note as we all know the bad guys are more interesting. But as the good witch, she is at once naive and wise, showing that while Oz is not what she wanted, he is what she has to work with and sees the good in him. Conversely, Rachel Wiesz and Mila Kunis as the wicked witches would have more opportunity to expand and play up their roles, but their performances were uninspired, lacking any real threat just part of the explanation of how the wizard and they came to be. It seems the best lines/heart were left to Zach Braff as his assistant in both lands and the little china girl. Their scenes along with Michelle Williams' were the only ones that pulled you into the movie. Also, the other citizens of Oz were also there as scenery and to move the plot, Rami did not take to opportunity to introduce us to a another wondrous group like the munchkins.

It's beautifully photographed with some amazing special effects, including the sequence in which several of the characters travel via giant soap bubbles, and the scene in which the Wizard fits together the pieces of a broken china doll.  The sets are amazing.  It's clear that no expense was spared in the making of this film ... and yet, on some level, it fails to achieve the emotional resonance of the earlier film.I think that ""Oz, the Great and Powerful"" suffers because we, as the audience, don't really have a central character to root for.  In the 1939 film, the main focus was on Dorothy and her quest to return home; in the prequel, we don't have a genuine hero or heroine.  The wizard is a bit of a greedy scoundrel throughout most of the film (and a womanizer to boot); the China Doll and the Monkey are just sidekicks, and none of the witches, not even Glinda the Good, is ever vulnerable enough to inspire much sympathy or concern.  And so, without that one lovable lead character, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is reduced to a visually splendid but emotionally aloof blockbuster.

I don't know if this followed the ""origin"" story of the Wizard that was in the books but I had no real problem with it.  The ""twist"" involving the three witches was actually intriguing to me as unfamiliar as I am to the original material... if it had anything to do with the original material.  The witches' story is easily the most interesting part of the plot and had the best execution.Unfortunately the weakest part of the film was the casting of James Franco.  He seemed supremely uncomfortable with whatever he was trying to project.  It was hard for me to suspend my belief that cameras and a lighting crew were surrounding him.  It's difficult to root for his transformation, supposedly the core of the plot, because you can't really figure out when it's happening.  Someone Matthew McConaughey-esque, who can play a flawed but deep rogue, would have been much better.I like Danny Elfman but his musical themes have a very identifiable signature.  From the first few notes to the ending all I kept thinking was ""Corpse Bride"".  Another minor gripe of mine was Mila Kunis.  I think she did fine for acting but she might have used some voice coaching to temporarily get rid of her accent (originally Ukrainian but kind of reminds me of Northeast I-95 corridor... somewhere).Again a CGI character brought in one of the most endearing performances.

(This is to say that to enjoy this movie on any level, one has to suspend a belief in any connection between the original and whatever this film is. If you don't, the problems are magnified.) Among the stellar cast, only Franco seems at home in his role while Williams, Weiss, and Kunis uncomfortably ham it up. Sure, you could expect Braff to ham it up since he's here, but this only served to further tarnish the original's good name. Over and over I could not fathom why they all agreed to do this film. As far as the SFX are concerned, this film boasts mediocre effects which harmed the film by being so widely utilized. It would have been better to use fewer effects and make them top-notch rather than blind us with color saturation from beginning to end. Of course, all the razzle is meant to distract us from the fact that there is no dazzle to the story.

Just a quick review of this movie...Oz The Great And Powerful (2013) is a prequel to The Wizard Of Oz (1939). This is just an &#34;OK&#34; movie. The acting is mediocre. The musical score is just run-of-the-mill, nothing spectacular. The CGI special effects are plentiful. TOO plentiful. And once again, like so many modern movies, the CGI looks so fake, like a video game. CGI was meant to make things look more real. Instead, it seems to be having the opposite effect. While there are quite a few well done scenes, this movie falls flat in its ability to grab this reviewer. The characters are just sort of &#34;there&#34; and I never really cared much for any of them. In contrast, in The Wizard Of Oz, the focus was on the well being of Dorothy and her friends in Oz. The Wizard Of Oz was character and story driven and that's what makes it have a powerful and lasting impact on so many people. The special effects used were state-of-the-art for the time period, but they were inserted to help tell the larger story. In contrast, the special effects in Oz The Great And Powerful seem to be inserted so they can be on display, something to look at and be dazzled by. That's the case with so many movies these days - I always notice that whenever a scene comes on that contains CGI special effects, it seems that there's a little pause while the effects are on the screen, as if to say, &#34;Hey audience, check out what we did with our computer. Aren't you impressed?&#34; This seems to be the case, rather than having a special effect on screen that naturally flows with the scene. I must say, however, that some of the atmosphere in this movie was well done, particularly scenes showing the Emerald City, sunlight, clouds, nighttime, etc. I didn't like the Wicked Witch Of The West in this movie. She seemed so different compared to Margaret Hamilton in the original movie and I couldn't visualize this woman fitting the image of the older Wicked Witch Of The West that we all know from The Wizard Of Oz. I also didn't like the wizard in this movie. He seemed so different compared to Frank Morgan, who is THE Wizard Of Oz. Michelle Williams was OK in her role, nothing great.I remember seeing the preview for this movie in the movie theater a few years back and my first thought was that the makers of this movie are deliberately doing a PREQUEL to The Wizard Of Oz instead of a straight remake, because they're probably afraid (and rightfully so) to do a remake. Instead, they're doing a prequel, and if it does well at the box office and gets good reviews, then the makers of this movie will basically ask the general public if it's OK to go ahead and do a remake of The Wizard Of Oz. In other words, the makers of Oz The Great And Powerful are tip-toeing their way to making a remake of The Wizard Of Oz. Whether or not a remake is made remains to be seen. Based on the mediocre reviews this movie has gotten, I think a remake is unlikely, but you never know. I hope a remake never happens. There's only one The Wizard Of Oz.I recommend seeing this movie once if you're curious.",3,We're off to see the...,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,3190,"['pixels', 'wonderful', 'pixels', 'Oz', 'full', 'description', 'plot', 'etc.', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'Just', 'quick', 'review', 'movie', 'Great', 'Powerful', '2013', 'prequel', 'Wizard', 'Oz', '1939', 'just', '34', 'OK', '34', 'movie', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'musical', 'score', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'plentiful', 'TOO', 'plentiful', 'once', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'movies', 'CGI', 'so', 'fake', 'video', 'game', 'CGI', 'was', 'meant', 'make', 'things', 'look', 'more', 'real', 'Instead', 'be', 'having', 'opposite', 'effect', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'well', 'done', 'scenes', 'movie', 'flat', 'ability', 'grab', 'reviewer', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'sort', '34', '34', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'much', 'contrast', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'focus', 'was', 'well', 'being', 'Dorothy', 'friends', 'Oz', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'was', 'character', 'story', 'driven', 'what', 'have', 'powerful', 'lasting', 'impact', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'were', 'state-of-the-art', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'inserted', 'help', 'tell', 'larger', 'story', 'contrast', 'special', 'effects', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'seem', 'be', 'inserted', 'can', 'be', 'display', 'something', 'look', 'be', 'dazzled', 'case', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'days', 'always', 'notice', 'whenever', 'scene', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'little', 'pause', 'effects', 'are', 'screen', 'say', '34', 'Hey', 'audience', 'check', 'out', 'what', 'did', 'computer', 'Are', ""n't"", 'impressed', '34', 'be', 'case', 'rather', 'having', 'special', 'effect', 'screen', 'naturally', 'scene', 'must', 'say', 'however', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Emerald', 'City', 'sunlight', 'clouds', 'nighttime', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'movie', 'seemed', 'so', 'different', 'compared', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'original', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'visualize', 'woman', 'fitting', 'image', 'older', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'know', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'wizard', 'movie', 'seemed', 'so', 'different', 'compared', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'who', 'THE', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'was', 'OK', 'role', 'nothing', 'great.I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'preview', 'movie', 'movie', 'theater', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'makers', 'movie', 'are', 'deliberately', 'doing', 'PREQUEL', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'instead', 'straight', 'remake', ""'re"", 'probably', 'afraid', 'rightfully', 'so', 'do', 'remake', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'doing', 'prequel', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'good', 'reviews', 'then', 'makers', 'movie', 'will', 'basically', 'ask', 'general', 'public', 'OK', 'go', 'ahead', 'do', 'remake', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'other', 'words', 'makers', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'are', 'tip-toeing', 'way', 'making', 'remake', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Whether', 'not', 'remake', 'made', 'remains', 'be', 'seen', 'Based', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'gotten', 'think', 'remake', 'unlikely', 'never', 'know', 'hope', 'remake', 'never', 'only', 'one', 'Wizard', 'Oz.I', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'once', ""'re"", 'curious']",N/A

It takes even more skill to craft something remotely worthy of such a classic. I think of the novels Scarlett, a sequel to Gone With the Wind, and Cosette, a sequel to Les Miserables, and shudder. The news of a film prequel to The Wizard of Oz struck me as a blow to fond memories of a childhood classic. I was completely uninterested and ready to write it off until I found out the director's name--Sam Raimi.Raimi is famous for directing the Tobey Maguire Spider-man movies, though he has had a long history of horror, fantasy, drama, and comedy film making. Often, all in the same film. He has a distinctive and imaginative style. If anyone could pull off another Oz movie, it would be him....or Stephen Spielberg.Oz the Great and Powerful tells how Oscar Diggs came from a traveling circus in Kansas to the land of Oz. He runs a magic show for the carnival and wants to be a great flimflam artist but he can't make it to the big time. He tells a girl in Kansas who wants to marry him that he doesn't want to be a good man, he wants to be a great man. She wants a good man but he's not interested in small town life. After his fateful balloon ride, Diggs is mistaken for the prophesied wizard who will defeat the wicked witch and become the just and benevolent ruler of the land of Oz. Diggs is, of course, no wizard, but he is a man of great ambition, and the fabulous wealth of Oz is a great temptation to him.The story follows a rather predictable arc, especially for anyone who has seen the original film. Nevertheless, the movie is full of invention and visual splendor, perfectly suited to Raimi's cinematic style.The actors are fairly good, though James Franco as Oz gives only an adequate performance in what should be a star-making larger-than-life role. It is a devilish hard mark to hit and I don't know who would have done a better job blending the ambition and the heart that are required for the role.Overall, the movie is a joy to watch and I am sad that I didn't see it in the theater in its full glory. I watched it on a plane and want to watch it again on a bigger screen with better sound.

I think the appeal in theme here is Oz being someone defeating the odds, overcoming substantial villains and winning the hearts of practically everyone without having any 'wizardly' powers whatsoever, in fact being just a plain ordinary person like you or I.  And of course, showing a lot of ordinary people how they can achieve perhaps extraordinary goals despite their weaknesses, etc.Michelle Williams I thought was perfect for her role (Glinda the Good) and really hit the mark, Rachel Weisz also played a strong part as ""Evanora""..... however I felt like Mila Kunis was just too young, sounded like a high schooler (and that level of acting really).  She dropped even further as she became the black hatted Wicked Witch of the (West?) and began to rant more like a bratty teenager yelling at her boyfriend or dad.  James Franco of course being the young Oz, was pretty good but also a bit too immature for my liking and between the two they sort of leant an air of a Disney kid tv series.There was a bit of confusion as to who was which witch, especially with there only being three and really this was a pretty major part of the whole Wizard of Oz tale they for some reason didn't choose to play out accurately.  I mean we were looking to connect the dots after all North, South, East West to the 'sequel' but they just didn't add up.Nevertheless, the story kept you watching and the ending was good.  Whoever did the opening credits deserves some credit also, pretty exceptional work.  They almost set the bar too high.I'm tempted to sum up the movie as ""watch three hot babes fight over guy smiley while a CGI rendered monkey and a dwarf provide comic relief"", but it deserves better than that, its a movie worth seeing and some people, depending on your taste may like it a lot.But you can't help but wonder if they had recast a couple people, if just maybe this good film could have been a great one.",3,"Well done, good storyline, some weak characters",1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,2059,"['really', 'kids', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'geared', 'nostalgic', 'adult', 'did', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'storyline', 'plenty', 'tale', 'charm', 'think', 'appeal', 'theme', 'here', 'Oz', 'being', 'someone', 'defeating', 'odds', 'overcoming', 'substantial', 'villains', 'winning', 'hearts', 'practically', 'everyone', 'having', ""'wizardly"", 'powers', 'whatsoever', 'fact', 'being', 'just', 'plain', 'ordinary', 'person', 'course', 'showing', 'lot', 'ordinary', 'people', 'how', 'can', 'achieve', 'perhaps', 'extraordinary', 'goals', 'weaknesses', 'etc.Michelle', 'Williams', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'Glinda', 'Good', 'really', 'hit', 'mark', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'also', 'played', 'strong', 'part', 'Evanora', 'however', 'felt', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'young', 'sounded', 'high', 'schooler', 'level', 'acting', 'really', 'dropped', 'even', 'further', 'became', 'black', 'hatted', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'began', 'rant', 'more', 'bratty', 'teenager', 'yelling', 'boyfriend', 'dad', 'James', 'Franco', 'course', 'being', 'young', 'Oz', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'also', 'bit', 'too', 'immature', 'liking', 'two', 'sort', 'leant', 'air', 'Disney', 'kid', 'tv', 'series.There', 'was', 'bit', 'confusion', 'who', 'was', 'witch', 'especially', 'only', 'being', 'three', 'really', 'was', 'pretty', 'major', 'part', 'whole', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'tale', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'choose', 'play', 'out', 'accurately', 'mean', 'were', 'looking', 'connect', 'dots', 'North', 'South', 'East', 'West', ""'sequel"", 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up.Nevertheless', 'story', 'kept', 'watching', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'did', 'opening', 'credit', 'also', 'pretty', 'exceptional', 'work', 'almost', 'set', 'bar', 'too', 'high.I', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'sum', 'up', 'movie', 'watch', 'three', 'hot', 'babes', 'fight', 'guy', 'smiley', 'CGI', 'rendered', 'monkey', 'dwarf', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'better', 'movie', 'seeing', 'people', 'depending', 'taste', 'may', 'like', 'lot.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'had', 'recast', 'couple', 'people', 'just', 'maybe', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'one']",N/A

Proceed with caution.The story of of Dorothy and friends traversing through the land of Oz is one that has stood the test of time. Whether you are young or old, a movie enthusiasts or not, The Wizard of Oz is a tale that you are likely to have seen. But what happened before Dorothy landed in this strange world and set out to take down the evil Wicked With of the West? Was she always so wicked? And what about Oz? Where did he come from? These are all the questions that Oz the Great and Powerful attempts to answer and it does so pretty successfully. Through vibrant colors and a new group of likable characters, Oz the Great and Powerful reopens this world that captured the hearts of many in hopes of providing some backstory while at the same time appealing to people of all ages.After the disastrous attempt at recreating the world of Wonderland back in 2010, I found that I was very skeptical going into Oz the Great and Powerful. To say that I was pleasantly surprised with the end result would be a bit of an understatement. Once the film starts the viewer is greeted with a tiny box in the middle of the screen sporting some beautiful black and white visuals. This throwback lasts for about 20 minutes as we meet Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs (James Franco) and learn a bit of his backstory and who he is as a person. This black and white segment ends with Oz getting sucked up into a twister (I smiled) and finding himself in the land of Oz. Upon meeting Theodora (Mila Kunis), Oz is sent to take down Glinda (Michelle Williams); who he's told is the wicked witch.Oz quickly finds out the truth about Glinda as she tells him who she is and what her place is in the land of Oz. Along with Finley (Zach Braff) and China Girl (Joey King), Oz sets out to find the truth about this mystical land and attempts to help these people through lies and deceit - they believe him to be ""the great wizard"". The story progresses and we see how the Wicked Witch of the West came about and we also get to see the third sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), the Wicked Witch of the East. Filled with heartfelt moments and a handful of references to the 1939 film, there's a lot to love about this origin story. However, the end result is far from perfect.My biggest problem with Oz the Great and Powerful is that everything seems a little premature. The story, the visuals, the script; none of it feels completely polished. While the film is filled with beautiful environments and bright colors, nothing seems real. Now I know that sounds weird when addressing a film about a mystical land full of witches and munchkins, but it's true. From the moment Oz found himself in this world I suddenly felt disconnected. No longer did I feel as engaged as I was moments earlier because the entire thing is one obvious green screen. There was clearly a lot of time and effort put into making this world come alive; I just wish the same effort could have been put into making it feel like something I could physically inhabit.While both the story and script have their fair share of surprises, they too could have used a little more time to develop into something truly spectacular. At times I found that the characters became predictable, as did the dialogue and some of the scenarios we found ourselves in. You have the selfish Oz who gains a heart by the end of the film, the obviously evil Evanora who turns out to be the real antagonist, and many other obvious character outcomes. The dialogue, while strong for majority of the film, gets pretty corny in some areas. Most of it comes from either Theodora or Oz himself, but none of the characters are exempt from saying something stupid at one point or another.With that said, Oz works so well because it has charm. You meet Finley and China Girl - I found it weird that she wasn't given an actual name - pretty early in the adventure and they were honestly my two favorite characters. Finley was probably there more for comedic effect for the younger viewers, but he really helped balance out the obnoxious personality of Oz. While his reasons for assisting Oz were a bit cliched, his presence was appreciated as he helped add a little heart to a situation when Oz became a bit too much for me to handle. China Girl was just an adorable character in general and hearing her little feet clacking when she walked made my heart melt. Also, the animations for both of these characters was very well done, as was the make-up for the Wicked Witch of the West.Performance wise the cast was kind of mixed. James Franco gave another Franco performance, but I think it was the character of Oz and his dialogue that really turned me off. Mila Kunis gave another one of her inconsistent performances that ranges from really good to just plain awful. Rachel Weisz was ok, but nothing breathtaking or extremely memorable. If anyone really delivered it would be Michelle Williams. She was the perfect Glinda and she was probably given one of the strongest roles in the film. Just an all around great performance from her.Overall Score: 7.5/10 - In short, Oz the Great and Powerful is solid. It's gorgeous to look at, borrows from some of the same elements found in the original, and once again we're given a nice, diverse cast of characters. However, as a whole the movie is inconsistent with itself. It never really reaches its stride because majority of the time it seems unable to find its footing. It constantly stumbles and it would have greatly benefited from some more time and polish. Still, it's a nice experience and one I would recommend to any family or fan of the original.",4,7.5/10 - Good,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,5620,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed',

Colorful special effects although at times they seemed a bit to cartoony and green screen-ish.  The story line was good although I thought a bit slow especially at the beginning.Although James Franco does an ok job as the wizard but is it just me or do you think like I do that Johnny Depp, who is known for playing quirky characters, would have brought more to the role and been a better fit?  As I watched the movie, I just wondered what could have been if Depp had played the character in his own whimsical way.  Maybe Disney thought he was in too many of their movies or something but imagine what it could have been.  No matter how hard the wizard tried to make me believe in him, I just couldn't without seeing Depp in the role.Oz is not a bad movie, just not great as it could have been.

1642213,A2ARM6AHTM0QGF,B00C5W3SBE,karenina delta,"[0, 0]","I always tell everyone that I grew up in a family of bookworms. Hence my name is from my Mom's favorite novel. ButWhat most dont know is that my childhood is also filled up with breat adventure movies - The Oddyssey, The NeverEnding Story, Land Before Time, Fern Gully, An American Tale, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonerland and my all-timefavorite The Wizard of Oz.I know the story was based on a book by L. Frank Baum, although Ive never read one. And that 1939 movie with JudyGarland is a timeless classic. And now when all things classic are being recycled, I wasn't suprised that Oz willbe one of them. So it is a prequel to the timeless Oz every child grew up watching. And I'm glad they did becauseit wasnt murdered, butchered even like those old movies being re-vamped. It was given justice and it kinda shedthe light for everyone to meet the real Wizard, very much human but worked on to be 'great' and 'powerful'.First time Ive seen it, I got entertained. Sam Raimi did a great great job with the special effects. I like theidea that it was black-and-white in the real world and then, all cinemascope and colorful as soon as the Wizardreaches Oz. The story is very simple. A carnival magician/ con-man/ heartbreaker had to leave the circus forgetting into trouble. The balloon he was riding got stuck in a hurricane. During the 'bumpy' ride, he promised tochange his ways, be a good man, blah blah. As if heard by the Heavens, his balloon safely touched down in Oz andhe was left unharmed. Thats when he started meeting witches, mystical animal, etc. And is bound to save a Kingdomfrom an evil Wicked Witch.The second time I watched it. I was not there to be entertained anymore. I put my thinking cap on. And refused tobe distracted by the breath taking view of Oz.The characters in Oz were mere representations of Oscar Diggs' failed relationships in real life. The witches werepast lovers. Glinda the Good and the woman he left at the Circus were even played by Michelle Williams, howobvious could that be. The bell-hop-clad monkey Finley is his carnival assistant Frank, 'who just wanted hisfriendship' and little china girl was the same girl who asked the Magician to make her walk. And he did make herwalk. In Oz, if that counts.Let's talk about the Wizard. I was a bit doubtful when I first heard that James Franco was to play the Wizard ofOz. James Franco is obviously at the pinnacle of his career. The wizard being a ladies' man, not too serious aboutlife or even at his craft. After watching Franco in This is the End, the role fits him perfectly. Creepy.Mila Kunis is a gem. I love, love, love the transformation of her character from the beautiful innocent witchTheodora to the green wartsy broom-flying Wicked Witch. I was hoping she would sing Defying Gravity any moment.She may not have sung but she delivered indeed. Her voice was sweet as a pretty witch but was so angry when sheturned green. So why green? Emerald City? The Wizard's favorite color? Green-eyed monster? Could be. Green becauseit's the color of decay. And as her sister Evanora, the real Evil witch, said, &#34;That's your heart witheringaway...&#34;There were twists - who's the real evil bitch I mean, witch among the three. There was also romance. And action -the 'war' between Evanora's Army and the good citizens of Emerald City from tinkers, farmers to munchkins. But myfavorite part was when Oz took on his 'ethereal form' and fooled the enemies, his greatest trick ever. And I guessthat's where the heart of the movie is. The city believed in him. Glinda was able to see right through him butnevertheless, still believed in him. And he delivered. Not by magic, or curse, or spells like a real wizard wouldbut he used what he knows best. And he drove the enemies away. At the end of the day, he still got the resultsthey wanted.Im not really a critic.

Although it is the same basic story-line as the original,there are some differences.  Dorothy and ToTo do not exist and no house falls on a wicked witch.  Since there is no Dorothy, there are no ruby slippers either.  And, of course, the beautiful song ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" is non-existant.Our story begins in Kansas 1905, where con-man ""Oz"" travels the country with his magic shows. He barely scrapes by with the change he makes but he dreams that someday he will be great.  He also is a ladies-man, schmoozing every pretty face he sees.  Running for his life, he hops on a balloon, cuts the rope, and laughs heartily as he escapes--until he sees everyone on the ground running.  He turns to see himself being sucked into the funnel of a tornado.  As you already know, he lands safely in the land of OZ where the adventure begins as he meets Theodora and travels to the Emerald City to fulfill the prophecy of the land and save the people from the evil witch.The movie seemed suitable for children (unless they are very young and might have witch nighmares).  It actually seemed a lot more tame than the original movie.  I saw plenty of children in the 6 and 7 year old range at the theater.  Adults and children all seemed to enjoy the movie.  There are some cool computer-graphic imaging and anamatronics.  Although I saw this in 2-D and it was great, it was also available in 3-D.

His acting and voice acting were nothing short of amazing.The rest of the star studded cast fell greatly short, especially Mila Kunis. Throughout the first portion of the movie it seemed like the director told her to whisper throughout every scene so that the audience wouldn't know how bad of an actor she really is. Sidebar: Normally I like her, but she really seemed out of her element, especially in the beginning of the movie. As it progressed, she seemed to have a better grasp of things. None of the main actors were all that convincing and I found myself bored at several points of the story because of this.Synopsis:James Franco plays the shady wizard OZ, whose main goal is to trick his audience using all of his questionable techniques he has available. He is brought to the land of Oz in a tornado and expected to help settle the unrest that is happening. Not being a real wizard, he uses his bag of tricks (literally) to help him on his journey. He meets up with a ragtag group of friends along the way (much like Dorothy) and  uses their special skills to help him defeat the wicked witches.The movie had a lot to live up to being associated with an incredible franchise. Unfortunately, it was simply another overhyped, CGI based flick that strayed way too far away from its roots. Many of the actors were clearly unfamiliar with CGI work as many scenes seemed strangely awkward. Hollywood needs to realize that a name will only take you so far, you need to have content to back it up.

1642225,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00C5W3SBE,Kenya Starflight,"[1, 1]","When I saw trailers for this movie, I admit to being extremely hesitant about watching it.  There were a number of reasons for this, the first and foremost being that sequels/prequels/remakes of any movie are always a crapshoot, and trying to update or add to a classic film such as ""Wizard of Oz"" is even riskier.  And despite ""Wizard of Oz"" having its own set of flaws (it's admittedly trippy and corny, and the special effects, while phenomenal for their time, show signs of age), it's still a beloved classic by many, so any attempts at a re-imagining or addition to the tale would be met with skepticism and scrutiny.  The fact that I'm a huge fan of the ""Wicked"" musical, which has it's own take on the land of Oz and the backstories of some of the classic characters, didn't help either.  But I decided to give the film a chance anyhow.The verdict?  This film looks gorgeous and acting is decent, but a bad script bogs everything down and is bound to give many viewers headaches.""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" follows Oscar Diggs, a sleight-of-hand magician traveling with a second-rate circus through rural Kansas.  Something of a womanizer and egomaniac, he dreams of doing great things... but even he isn't prepared for destiny to come crashing down on him when a tornado sucks him into the fantastic land of Oz, where two witches immediately declare him the king of their world.  At first Oscar is thrilled, but the witches tell him his newfound throne comes with a price -- to rule Oz he must fulfill a prophecy and destroy the Wicked Witch who killed the previous king, and thus save Oz.  Armed with only his wits and parlor-magic tricks, and with the aid of a sour-tempered Munchkin and a wisecracking flying monkey, Oscar sets out to defeat the witch... only to find out that who's wicked and who's on his side isn't clear, and that he may end up becoming a pawn of more malevolent forces.Perhaps this film's greatest strength is in its appearance.  The visuals are GORGEOUS, with vibrant colors, imaginative creatures and scenery, good special effects, and beautifully rendered costumes.  Oz looks every bit the marvelous land I imagined from the books, with its own surprises and its own dangers, but it also pays visual homage to its predecessor in many ways.  And in a few areas it even manages to improve on the old film -- the evil flying monkeys (more like bat-winged baboons in this incarnation) are obviously CGI, but they're genuinely terrifying in this film, instead of being people in goofy costumes.The acting in this film is decent as well, and the actors do the best they can with the script they've been given.  James Franco does a superb job at playing Oscar Diggs, and his performance somehow reminds me of Robert Downey Jr.'s rendition of Tony Stark in Ironman -- an arrogant playboy who gradually develops a heart and a sense of honor as the film progresses, and something of a gadgeteer genius.  Rachel Weisz is obviously having too much fun as the villainess, and Mila Kunis is genuinely heartbreaking, creating a sympathetic character even in her most over-the-top moments.  Michelle Williams is incredibly bland in comparison, but then, she isn't given much to work with in this rendition of Glinda the Good.  And the supporting cast has some great moments, most notably Joey King as a China Girl (no, not a stereotypical Chinese girl, an actual girl made of china -- it makes sense in context).But the script is what brings this movie down.  The actors do their dogged best to bring the characters to life, but they're given very little to work with.  James Franco plays an excellent copy of Tony Stark, but that's just what it feels like -- a copy of something we've already seen before.  The ""trickster becomes a hero"" plot has been done before, and while old plots can be given a fresh twist and done again, it felt like this movie didn't bring anything new to the table.  And it becomes difficult to root for Franco when he womanizes everything in a skirt, treats his friends like dirt, and does precious little to redeem himself by film's end.The three witches suffer the most, however -- they're all cardboard cutouts instead of interesting characters, and while it's interesting to see the two wicked witches play Oscar as a pawn in their game of power, it becomes tiring when said games descent into a love triangle.  Mila Kunis does manage to bring some pathos to her role, and was on the verge of becoming a decent character... but the filmmakers decide to throw all that out the window and use a combination of magic and ""jilted lover"" clich&eacute;s to abruptly turn her into a villain.  And after seeing a far more realistic and heartbreaking fall to darkness for this villainess in ""Wicked,"" her turn to evil in this movie felt like a bad joke.This movie feels like a fantasy version of ""Avatar"" in my mind -- gorgeous to look at and with some interesting ideas, but with a tired plot and uninteresting characters to go along with it.  I'd watch this film again, but only because of the visuals and the valiant efforts of the actors to salvage something from the script.  In the meantime, I prefer ""Wicked"" as my ""Wizard of Oz"" prequel of choice, thank you...",3,Gorgeous visuals can't save a lackluster script or flat characters,1376438400,"08 14,

I never read the books, therefore I'm going with the ""Wizard Of Oz"" movie. However I do research, and what I found stated that ""L. Frank Baum himself wrote from an in-universe standpoint, many fans of the series treat the books as if they were true, known among the fans as the ""Oz as History"" standpoint. Any confusion or contradiction between the different versions of their histories is said to be the fault of the historian making an honest mistake, of the editors for removing parts which they did not consider suitable for the child audience, of the characters involved who reported the incidents in question back to the historian, or explained by the concept that many alternate versions of Oz exist simultaneously.""This prequel, ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" fits perfectly as can be expected. By this I mean, everyone is dead and gone that had anything to do with the ""Wizard Of Oz movie."" Besides that, I believe no one can do the old films respect, as they rely on special effects more than story.The production starts out in black and white as the original film and switches to color. A magician (James Franco) is swept away in the manner one expects, to the enchanted land of Oz and is forced into a power struggle between three witches (some good some bad). Its theme shows how deceit and the empty promise of love can mar and undo people. This can certainly give something for teens to talk about, or for parents with their teenage children.As for the actors? They did a fine job. I found nothing wrong with casting or the acting.I had a very critical and old friend with me who believed, ""...the movie was fantastically produced and directed. The sound score and special effects captured your imagination without breaking the splendor of the previous film.""The only two items either of us wondered about was:1) ""The Wizard Of Oz"" the Wizard refuses to grant their wishes (as he cannot/no real power) but after Toto accidentally exposes him as a normal old man with no real magical powers, he tries to make up for this. He gives the Scarecrow a diploma, Lion a medal and Tin Man a heart-shaped clock. He decides to fly Dorothy home in his hot air balloon, but it accidentally takes off without her. Glinda arrives and tells Dorothy that she has always had the power to go back to Kansas; the ruby slippers will take her back. She previously did not tell Dorothy this because Dorothy had to realize for herself that ""There's no place like home"".  After saying her goodbyes, Dorothy clicks her heels three times and awakens back home in her bed, surrounded by family, the three farmhands and Professor Marvel. She claims the farmhands and Professor Marvel were in Oz, though it is implied Dorothy's visit to Oz was simply a dream.A dream?Yet in Oz The Great and Powerful"" it is shown not to be a dream. Nothing either of us noted even implies this.Why?For it is obviously a parallel reality of some sort. Hence why some people are similar on Oz to those on Earth.A stretch?No. Magic is just a way people explain away things they do not comprehend as science.If, on the other hand, you wish to believe Oz is an enchanted land, then did Oz die? Is this an after life or brief dream before death? I prefer a parallel world. If you want to see the lands, look-up this: Oz and surrounding countries.2) Why would the Wizard Of Oz want to leave? (Feeling guilty or not for Dorthy). He and Glinda (Michelle Williams) were becoming serious, and by Dorthies time they should have had children. Since many years obviously passed between this prequel and the old well known ""Wizard Of Oz""  we wished they would have covered this issue or otherwise never established a romantic relationship between Oz and Glinda.In any event, the movie is well worth buying if you are a Oz fan. I have no issues with the paying for my ticket. And I will be purchasing the DVD when it comes out.

The greatness of ""The Wizard Of Oz"" casts a tall shadow over anyone that attempts to make a movie based on the popular L. Frank Baum books.  That said, director Sam Raimi has largely succeeded in turning an old, yet familiar, world into something relevant.  I'll be the first to say ""Oz, The Great And Powerful"" is a disjointed blockbuster; but doggone it, this picture acquits itself with a satisfying conclusion.  Actors Mila Kunis and Michelle Williams are out of place in the fantasy genre regrettably, while Rachel Weisz nails her part.  Overall, this is a great-looking film that works in the right places despite its warts.COMMENTS:  { SPOILER ALERT }  As Mila Kunis's character, Theodora, slips into darkness and jeolousy, one sees that her tears burn her face.  Not to be a complete wise guy here, but if the Wicked Witch melts when water is thrown on her, how does she take a bath?  Also, how dumb is Theodora anyway?  It is obvious that her sister, Evanora, spied on her using a crystal ball.  Wouldn't that make one suspicious?  I mean, couldn't the nave young sister ask one question before willingly eating a magic apple that disfigures her appearance?  Also, poor Kunis sounded like a bratty ten-year-old every time she raised her voice.

Baum original children stories but Sam Raimi (Spider-Man, The Evil Dead) did a respectable version of the story BEFORE Dorothy and her magical friends seek the Wizard of Oz themselves.With a pleasantly crafted screenplay, written by Mitchell Kapner ( The Whole Nin Yards, Days of Wrath) and David Lindsay-Abaire (Rise of the Guardians, Inkheart), Raimi did an excellent job with the visuals and style of the film. From the make-up to the sets, the film is literally visual eye candy. Not to mention the fantastic Danny Elfman (Beetljuice, Batman) score which only adds to the wonderment of the film.The story begins long before Dorothy ever makes it to Oz with Oscar (the Wizard to be) played wonderfully by James Franco (127 Hours, Rise of the Planet of the Apes) who does a fantastic job at playing a conman with a really big heart. He doesn't show the positive side of himself, but appears to be nothing more than a swindling con artist with nothing more that money and women on his immediate agenda.Mila Kunis (Black Swan, That 70's Show) plays Theodora the sister of the `west' (wink, wink) who actually meets and falls in love with Oscar. Her innocence and performance are sincere and honest and when she becomes the icon that everyone has either seen or knows of, Mila really shines as the alter ego she nastily becomes. (I'll give you a hint, she turns green, fly's around on a household cleaning utensil and wears a very distinctive hat!)Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Constantine) does an amazing job as Theodora's sister Evanora who also does a wonderful job of miss direction in the film. Not only does she motivate two characters to the point of making major changes in The Land of Oz, but she gives her sister something she (and us as the audience) will never forget!Now you have to add the goodness and sincerity in the film, and mix it with another miss direction again, this time you have the `Good Witch"" Gilinda played wonderfully by Michelle Williams (Shutter Isalnd, Dawson's Creek). Her amazing wisdom, trust and heart are what guide, motivate and eventually mature our con man (James Franco or Oscar or Oz) into become the `Wonderful Wizard' he will be. (She also plays another role that I will tell you has a direct connection to Dorothy Gale.)I must give a special nod to Zach Braff (Scrubs, Chicken Little) who is a bumbling assistant to Oscar in the black and white sequence but becomes more than a friend to Oz himself when they are paired up in the Magical Kingdom quite by accident. Zach's voice is that of Finely a not so bright, but loveable,  bellhop dressed chimpanzee/monkey who flies. So much heart and warmth go into their relationship you'll believe what you see.Another real and passionate performance comes from a small on screen appearance as a different character but later as a much larger voice over for a wonderful character known as `The China Doll'.  Joey king (Crazy, Stupid, Love, Ice Age 3) gives a marvelous vocal performance with much empathy as a China Doll who lost her family. Tony Cox (SW Return of the Jedi, Bad Santa) also makes a wonderful jaunt as a disgruntled munchkin as does Bill Cobbs (Night At The Museum, The Bodyguard) who players the Head Tinker and gives Oz exactly what he needs!What was sweet is they made references to characters and places from the original film and kept the color and vibrancy of the original. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is still the classic and nothing will probably ever be able to hold a candle to it, however this is a nice side-dish to the legend that Frank L. Baum created in his famous children's books.There is a section where it seems a little too much visuals, butterflies, creatures, water and fauna, but once you get passed that, the story and characters come alive and really make you believe what Dorothy had no idea she would be up against in the next cinematic adventure. I love the stylistic black and white beginning of the film and the concept of the small screen being portrayed in the first 15 minutes, but when it opens to wide screen and in full amazing cinematic color, it becomes a fun film with surprises and scares where you least expect them. It might scare really small children but fans of the original classic film, and new fans, should come and hopefully will really enjoy the characters and story that is ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"".",4,Frank L Baum Would Be Proud - Oz Is Not Bad!,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,4589,"['When', 'project', 'was', 'announced', 'general', 'public', 'critics', 'even', 'actors', 'film', 'were', 'wondering', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'modern', 'times', 'give', 'respect', 'original', 'MGM', 'classic', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'as', 'well', 'Frank', 'L.', 'Baum', 'original', 'children', 'stories', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'did', 'respectable', 'version', 'story', 'BEFORE', 'Dorothy', 'magical', 'friends', 'seek', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'themselves.With', 'pleasantly', 'crafted', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Mitchell', 'Kapner', 'Whole', 'Nin', 'Yards', 'Days', 'Wrath', 'David', 'Lindsay-Abaire', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'Inkheart', 'Raimi', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'visuals', 'style', 'film', 'make-up', 'sets', 'film', 'literally', 'visual', 'eye', 'candy', 'Not', 'mention', 'fantastic', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'Beetljuice', 'Batman', 'score', 'only', 'wonderment', 'film.The', 'story', 'begins', 'long', 'before', 'Dorothy', 'ever', 'Oz', 'Oscar', 'Wizard', 'be', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'James', 'Franco', '127', 'Hours', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'who', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'conman', 'really', 'big', 'heart', ""n't"", 'show', 'positive', 'side', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'swindling', 'con', 'artist', 'nothing', 'more', 'money', 'women', 'immediate', 'agenda.Mila', 'Kunis', 'Black', 'Swan', '70', 'Show', 'Theodora', 'sister', 'west', 'wink', 'wink', 'who', 'actually', 'meets', 'falls', 'love', 'Oscar', 'innocence', 'performance', 'are', 'sincere', 'honest', 'when', 'icon', 'everyone', 'seen', 'knows', 'Mila', 'really', 'alter', 'ego', 'nastily', ""'ll"", 'give', 'hint', 'green', 'fly', 'household', 'cleaning', 'utensil', 'very', 'distinctive', 'hat', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Mummy', 'Constantine', 'amazing', 'job', 'Theodora', 'sister', 'Evanora', 'who', 'also', 'wonderful', 'job', 'miss', 'direction', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'motivate', 'two', 'characters', 'point', 'making', 'major', 'changes', 'Land', 'Oz', 'sister', 'something', 'audience', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Now', 'have', 'add', 'goodness', 'sincerity', 'film', 'mix', 'miss', 'direction', 'again', 'time', 'have', 'Good', 'Witch', 'Gilinda', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Shutter', 'Isalnd', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'amazing', 'wisdom', 'trust', 'heart', 'are', 'what', 'guide', 'motivate', 'eventually', 'mature', 'con', 'man', 'James', 'Franco', 'Oscar', 'Oz', 'become', 'Wonderful', 'Wizard', 'will', 'be', 'also', 'role', 'will', 'tell', 'direct', 'connection', 'Dorothy', 'Gale', 'must', 'give', 'special', 'nod', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Scrubs', 'Chicken', 'Little', 'who', 'bumbling', 'assistant', 'Oscar', 'black', 'white', 'sequence', 'more', 'friend', 'Oz', 'when', 'are', 'paired', 'up', 'Magical', 'Kingdom', 'quite', 'accident', 'Zach', 'voice', 'Finely', 'not', 'so', 'bright', 'loveable', 'bellhop', 'dressed', 'chimpanzee/monkey', 'who', 'So', 'much', 'heart', 'warmth', 'go', 'relationship', ""'ll"", 'believe', 'what', 'see.Another', 'real', 'passionate', 'performance', 'small', 'screen', 'appearance', 'different', 'character', 'later', 'much', 'larger', 'voice', 'wonderful', 'character', 'known', 'China', 'Doll', 'Joey', 'king', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'Ice', 'Age', '3', 'marvelous', 'vocal', 'performance', 'much', 'empathy', 'China', 'Doll', 'who', 'lost', 'family', 'Tony', 'Cox', 'SW', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'also', 'wonderful', 'jaunt', 'disgruntled', 'munchkin', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Night', 'Museum', 'Bodyguard', 'who', 'players', 'Head', 'Tinker', 'Oz', 'exactly', 'what', 'What', 'was', 'sweet', 'made', 'references', 'characters', 'places', 'original', 'film', 'kept', 'color', 'vibrancy', 'original', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'still', 'classic', 'nothing', 'will', 'probably', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'hold', 'candle', 'however', 'nice', 'side-dish', 'legend', 'Frank', 'L.', 'Baum', 'created', 'famous', 'children', 'books.There', 'section', 'where', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'visuals', 'butterflies', 'creatures', 'water', 'fauna', 'once', 'get', 'passed', 'story', 'characters', 'come', 'alive', 'really', 'make', 'believe', 'what', 'Dorothy', 'had', 'idea', 'would', 'be', 'up', 'next', 'cinematic', 'adventure', 'love', 'stylistic', 'black', 'white', 'beginning', 'film', 'concept', 'small', 'screen', 'being', 'portrayed', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'when', 'wide', 'screen', 'full', 'amazing', 'cinematic', 'color', 'fun', 'film', 'surprises', 'scares', 'where', 'least', 'expect', 'might', 'scare', 'really', 'small', 'children', 'fans', 'original', 'classic', 'film', 'new', 'fans', 'should', 'come', 'hopefully', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'story', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful']",N/A

I was surprised that the movie did not do very well in the theaters, but decided to watch it anyway.  I finally saw it, and I think I understand why this movie was not well received.The movie has nice special effects that still have a sort of classic film look to it.  This was as intended by the makers of the movie.  The result is that it does not look as ""high-tech"" or realistic as other movies made nowadays, but still manages to feel magical in an old-fashioned way.  The story was original, based on the books by L. Frank Baum.  I was particularly moved by the character of Theodora (Mila Kunis).  I felt that the development of this character was very well done.  The cast did a good job generally speaking, and they were well cast.The real problem with this story, in my opinion, was the character of Oz.  James Franco did an excellent job as Oz, however his character was just not likable.  It's hard to root for a main character when he is a coward, selfish, a womanizer, a liar, and has generally no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Moreover, there is no real character development until the very end when he has some sort of epiphany and seemingly changes his ways.  The truth is that at this point of the movie, it's not realistic and is too little too late.  With the exception of his interactions with China Girl, he spends most of the movie demonstrating his low quality as a person.  The romance he has with the good witch was rushed and not believable.  In my opinion, if a romance is not developed correctly, the movie is probably better off without it.  The end result is that rooting for Oz is nearly impossible.  I found myself rooting for Theodora over Oz towards the end of the movie.

Made in 1939 this movie still captivates viewers to this day, young and old alike. Sequels have been made over the years but none have captured the magic that the original film did. But the recent release OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL comes pretty darn close.The film opens like the original, in black and white and in Kansas, where a traveling circus plays to the farmers nearby. Magician Oscar Diggs, known as Oz (James Franco) has brought on a new assistant, just like he does in every new town, by romancing her. The one possible love of his life, Annie (Michelle Williams), has shown up to let him know she's considering a proposal from a local man. Unable to take care of her he does the right thing and encourages her to do so. At about this time the circus strong man, whose wife Diggs romanced as well, heads for his wagon with intent to kill. A quick escape in a hot air balloon would help if it weren't for the tornado heading Digg's way.Swept up in the middle of the tornado, Diggs begs for the chance to redeem himself. That chance is granted and he lands in an odd little place called Oz. With the help of a beautiful young witch named Theodora (Mila Kunis), the head to the great Emerald City. Along the way she tells him the story of Oz, how a young witch killed her own father the King to take over and how he had foretold them all that a wizard of great power would come to save them. Oz/Diggs the con man knows better but Theodora and everyone they meet consider him their saving grace. Theodora also decides that the two of them will marry, something that comes back to haunt her later.They arrive at the city and are greeted by Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) who doubts Oz' abilities or claim to being a wizard. She too falls under his spell though and sends him on a mission. That mission is to retrieve the wand of the witch whose father was killed and break it, ending her power.Diggs sets out and along the way makes some friends who accompany him, one of which he came across earlier. They find the witch, Glinda (also played by Michelle Williams) but also discover something else. Just what that is I won't reveal as it twists the story being told. Just know that things aren't always what they seem. The story takes an odd turn here and changes just about everything and everyone in the process. Just how Diggs and his friends will survive makes for an interesting and delightful movie.At the heart of this film, as with the original, there is a story of change and of finding oneself. The original had four characters who thought they didn't have the things they needed but discovering that they had them inside all along. This film offers a similar concept with Diggs/Oz discovering that perhaps he's not the scoundrel we witnessed at the beginning of the film nor the complete waste of humanity that he thinks he is. Finding out just who he really is and what he is capable of rounds out the tale being told.The acting on screen is well done to the point where some characters that could have been played over the top are made real by the performances seen. This would be especially difficult considering most of the film is shot on green screen for special effects. But the entire cast does a remarkable job.Director Sam Raimi (the original EVIL DEAD and SPIDER-MAN 1, 2 & 3) does a fantastic job of combining eye catching visual effects that make the land of Oz believable while at the same time getting these actors to turn in great performances. He also brings to life characters that we've never met before like China Girl and has us caring about what happens to them. As with the original you'll find many touching moments here captured right beside the adventure being told.Set before the events of the earlier film, this one could leave the door open for numerous sequels and indeed author L. Frank Baum did write numerous books that took place in Oz. Many of these are free to download for e-book readers online at sites like manybooks.net. If Raimi has intentions of using those stories to build from this one, I for one look forward to them. This movie was one to not only watch but to watch again and again, shared with children old and young alike.",4,A TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO THE EMERALD CITY,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,4295,"['One', 'most', 'cherished', 'films', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'Made', '1939', 'movie', 'still', 'viewers', 'day', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'Sequels', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'years', 'none', 'have', 'captured', 'magic', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'recent', 'release', 'OZ', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'AND', 'POWERFUL', 'pretty', 'darn', 'close.The', 'film', 'original', 'black', 'white', 'Kansas', 'where', 'traveling', 'circus', 'plays', 'farmers', 'nearby', 'Magician', 'Oscar', 'Diggs', 'known', 'Oz', 'James', 'Franco', 'brought', 'new', 'assistant', 'just', 'new', 'town', 'romancing', 'one', 'possible', 'love', 'life', 'Annie', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'shown', 'up', 'let', 'know', 'considering', 'proposal', 'local', 'man', 'Unable', 'take', 'care', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'so', 'time', 'circus', 'strong', 'man', 'wife', 'Diggs', 'romanced', 'as', 'well', 'heads', 'wagon', 'intent', 'kill', 'quick', 'escape', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'would', 'help', 'were', ""n't"", 'tornado', 'heading', 'Digg', 'way.Swept', 'up', 'middle', 'tornado', 'Diggs', 'begs', 'chance', 'redeem', 'chance', 'granted', 'odd', 'little', 'place', 'called', 'Oz', 'help', 'beautiful', 'young', 'witch', 'named', 'Theodora', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'head', 'great', 'Emerald', 'City', 'way', 'story', 'Oz', 'how', 'young', 'witch', 'killed', 'own', 'father', 'King', 'take', 'over', 'how', 'had', 'foretold', 'wizard', 'great', 'power', 'would', 'come', 'save', 'Oz/Diggs', 'con', 'man', 'better', 'Theodora', 'everyone', 'meet', 'consider', 'saving', 'grace', 'Theodora', 'also', 'two', 'will', 'marry', 'something', 'back', 'haunt', 'later.They', 'arrive', 'city', 'are', 'greeted', 'Theodora', 'sister', 'Evanora', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'who', 'doubts', 'Oz', 'abilities', 'claim', 'being', 'wizard', 'too', 'spell', 'mission', 'mission', 'retrieve', 'wand', 'witch', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'break', 'ending', 'power.Diggs', 'out', 'way', 'friends', 'who', 'accompany', 'one', 'came', 'earlier', 'find', 'witch', 'Glinda', 'also', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'also', 'discover', 'something', 'else', 'Just', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'Just', 'know', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'what', 'seem', 'story', 'odd', 'turn', 'here', 'changes', 'just', 'everything', 'everyone', 'process', 'Just', 'how', 'Diggs', 'friends', 'will', 'survive', 'interesting', 'delightful', 'movie.At', 'heart', 'film', 'original', 'story', 'change', 'finding', 'original', 'had', 'four', 'characters', 'who', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'things', 'needed', 'discovering', 'had', 'along', 'film', 'similar', 'concept', 'Diggs/Oz', 'discovering', 'perhaps', 'not', 'scoundrel', 'witnessed', 'beginning', 'film', 'complete', 'waste', 'humanity', 'Finding', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'really', 'what', 'capable', 'rounds', 'tale', 'being', 'told.The', 'acting', 'screen', 'well', 'done', 'point', 'where', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'top', 'are', 'made', 'real', 'performances', 'seen', 'would', 'be', 'especially', 'difficult', 'considering', 'most', 'film', 'shot', 'green', 'screen', 'special', 'effects', 'entire', 'cast', 'remarkable', 'job.Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'original', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'SPIDER-MAN', '1', '2', '3', 'fantastic', 'job', 'combining', 'eye', 'catching', 'visual', 'effects', 'make', 'land', 'Oz', 'believable', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'getting', 'actors', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'also', 'life', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'China', 'Girl', 'caring', 'what', 'original', ""'ll"", 'find', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'here', 'captured', 'right', 'adventure', 'being', 'told.Set', 'events', 'earlier', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'leave', 'door', 'open', 'numerous', 'sequels', 'indeed', 'author', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'did', 'write', 'numerous', 'books', 'took', 'place', 'Oz', 'Many', 'are', 'free', 'download', 'e-book', 'readers', 'online', 'sites', 'manybooks.net', 'Raimi', 'intentions', 'using', 'stories', 'build', 'one', 'one', 'look', 'forward', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'watch', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'shared', 'children', 'old', 'young', 'alike']",N/A

""Oz"" has visual interest in spades, from the black-and-white opening sequence in historically accurate aspect ratio to the wide-screen sensory cornucopia of the land of Oz, but a successful movie must amount to more than the sum of its images.I've seen good work from all the main actors (James Franco, Mila Kunis in ""Black Swan,"" Michelle Williams in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" and Rachel Weisz in 1999's ""Sunshine"" with Ralph Fiennes) but found the performances in ""Oz"" perfunctory at best. The story felt like a ""Rango"" remake: a limited character who has only faked it in the past lands in an alien world where people think he's a desperately needed hero. He finds out whether he can live up to their expectations. The pacing was often slack, the tone wavered between childlike wonder and adult cynicism, the jokes were few and far between, and in the end I just couldn't care.I don't know if the filmmakers meant to target kids or nostalgic adults. The kids I saw ""Oz"" with were tepid in their enthusiasm. The adults could not help but compare this bland commercial exercise to the passionate artistry of the 1939 classic.

1642319,A17LSEN4UY4XZQ,B00C5W3SBE,M. Daneker,"[1, 1]","It's a shame that Sam Raimi felt the need to homage the 1939 celluloid tragedy that cast a near grown woman as a little girl and is so sugary, disgustingly dripping over-the-top that I have to side with the critics and audiences that originally made the film a flop.That said, there's some good stuff here, and a full-on non-musical new version of the actually book ""Dorthy and the Wizard of Oz"" would look promising.So first the bad: The film, especially the beginning, not only plays visual homage to the '39 film, but the dialogue as well. Stiff, stunted and unnatural sounding people like to blame Franco for his performance, but seriously, read his lines, mostly they're horrible. The real shocker though, and I didn't see this in 3D yet, is that for much of the early scenes in Oz it's so obvious they are on a green-screen it's not funny. It literally looks like they placed live actors in an animated film. Though scenes like the tornado and the final battle with the witch sisters are fantastic to look at, the simple shots of waking down the yellow-brick-road are jarringly bad.The good: It's always fun to see what lead up to events, even the horrid Star Wars prequels proved we had to see it, at least once. I don't care what anyone says, Franco does an excellent job and I think he was perfect. The relationships with the characters mostly worked, considering his co-stars where a bell-hop winged monkey and a broken porcelain girl, they where the best GGI in the film. Mostly the film was well paced, well acted and entertaining if a bit of a clumsy and pointless throw-back.The odd: Here is the synopsis, albeit scaled down, for both Army of Darkness and Oz The Great and Powerful: Trying to escape attack our hero, hapless and hopeless and a bit of a liar and show off is sucked into a spinning vortex and dropped into another world.

1642331,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00C5W3SBE,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 8]","Frank Baum's Oz series has always been fertile ground for toys, comics, and books seeking to put their own spin on the public domain property.  But ever since ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the movie industry just hasn't managed to replicate the iconic film's success, and with good reason: ""The Wizard of Oz"" now defines the books, even if it wasn't a faithful adaptation.  The yellow brick road is littered with failures: ""Return to Oz,"" ""The Wiz,"" and ""Tin Man."" It took a powerhouse like Disney to finally break the curse.The first big challenge to the film's success is James Franco as Oscar Diggs (AKA the magician known as Great Oz). Franco has something of an intellectual distance to him tinged with arrogance that makes him vaguely irritating - but it works here, because that's exactly how Oz is supposed to be.  He's a lady's man who preys on willfully ignorant women, luring them into his wiles with manufactured tales of woe that lands him in hot water, a tornado, and ultimately Oz.In no time Oz encounters the wide-eyed Theodora (Mila Kunis) who plays the witch as a kind of mentally-addled dreamer wistfully projecting her hopes and dreams on the handsome stranger. He's prophesized to be the savior of Oz, a powerful wizard who will reclaim the Emerald City.  It's not that easy of course; it seems the steward of Emerald City is Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and she's rightly skeptical of this new wizard who can't cast a single spell.  With the Emerald City's riches egging him on, Oz is put on a quest to steal the wicked witch's wand.  It's basically the plot of ""Army of Darkness,"" with less skeletons and more monkeys.Along the way, Oz will assemble his own motley crew of allies: flying monkey Finley (Zach Braff) and China Girl (Joey King), a living china doll.  The special effects excel in bringing these two characters to life, such that it's difficult not to stare at China Girl - a living doll that is expertly brought to life but fails to convincingly interact with any of the living characters.Despite the fact that the plot centers on Oz being such an unlikeable cad that he turns women into witches, there's lots of things ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" gets right. For one, the script is tight - the lost art of foreshadowing is in full force here, and the movie neatly ties back to events that happen early in the film.  For another, it expertly weaves in callouts to ""The Wizard of Oz."" There's nothing more or less to ""Oz"" than what's in the later film, but it still manages to seem fresh. From the framing, to the color transitions, to the soaring score by Danny Elfman, ""Oz"" never forgets its roots.  It's a big movie with a capital ""B.""""Oz"" is far from perfect.  It's a little off, a little too grand, a little too smarmy at times.  But that's a description that could easily be applied to the Land of Oz.

Oz starts out a jerk, but I still liked him, because you can tell he has a good side.  By the end of the film he becomes a very likable character.  The side characters are also fun.  My favorite character of the film would be the little china girl.However, the villains, I thought, were bland and non-engaging.  Mila Kunis, in my opinion, did a bad job as the wicked witch of the west.  She did not have the presence or the charisma that the original wicked witch had.  The other witch was fairly boring also.The production values for this film are great.  This movie does a good job at creating a beautiful looking world immersing the audience in that world.  The design of the residents of Oz looked great too.People are divided over this film.  Some like, while others do not.

1642362,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00C5W3SBE,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","To say the least, director Sam Raimi had a difficult challenge trying to provide an update of sort with this prequel to the beloved ""Wizard of Oz"" (1939).  In some ways he succeeds.  In some, he doesn't.  Certainly the nice transition from a squarish, black and white opening sequence to the CGI-laden color and wide-screen spectacular gets the audience enthused for more.James Franco stars as Oscar Diggs, known as Oz, a magician and con man aligned with a travelling circus.  During an escape from the husband/strongman of a girl Oz was attempting to romance, he jumps into a hot air balloon.  A violent tornado - the first of many connections to the original film - dumps Oz in to the fantasy Land of...you guessed it...Oz.  Oz is greeted by Theodora the witch (Mila Kunis) who believes him to be the expected great Wizard/King of Oz.  Using a few tricks from his bag, he goes along with the hoax when he finds out that the job comes with a warehouse full of gold.Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) is secretly hoping to take over the royal role by default.  Along the way, Oz saves a ceramic doll (Joey King) and Finley the monkey (Zach Braff) and falls in love with Glinda the witch (Michelle Williams).  All three characters appear in the opening sequence under different guises, so pay attention.  While all the razzle-dazzle of the visual effects are indeed eye popping, the story falters at times and slows down too often.I had a hard time really caring much about any of the characters.  As Oz begins to be less selfish in his actions, Franco doesn't really pull it off with his words.  I suspect much of the problem is with a less than great script.  The best thing about the film are the witches, especially Weisz and Kunis's pairing.  In any case, the movie certainly has an audience, even with its 130 minute length.  It is colorful eye candy, but it lacks the music and the emotion of the 1939 classic.I watched this film on a Blu ray 2-D version.  It has of course, 1080p video resolution and 2.40:1 aspect ratio once the film makes the jump from the opening 1.33:1 window-boxed black and white opening sequence.  As noted earlier, the film color really pops and the filmmakers use every color in and over the rainbow (sorry).  In some of the darker scenes, the blacks are appropriately black.

Mila Kunis as one of the three witches can't seem to shake her That 70's Show/Family Guy voice and it get really annoying, especially towards the end. The other two witches played by Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz thankfully fare much better.The IMAX 3-D is done really well and is worth the extra money, though the film is way too CGI heavy. Beautiful, but hollow. I did like how the first 20 minutes was in 1:33:1 screen ratio and black and white.

1642367,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00C5W3SBE,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 4]","Oscar Diggs is a turn-of-the-century circus magician, conman and ladies' man with dreams of doing great things like his hero, Thomas Edison, but a feeling that he might not be a good enough person to achieve such greatness. When a stop in Kansas results in Oscar being transported, via a twister (presumably several years prior to Dorothy's), to the magical land of Oz, his fortune changes immediately. He first meets  the good witch Theadora, a nave and emotional young woman who believes Oscar to be the prophesized wizard who would come to save their land from the evil witch plaguing it. As they travel towards the Emerald City, where Oscar will be made the new king and receive a treasure room overflowing with gold, Theadora's obsession with the prophesy and Oscar's charms lead her to fall in love with him, or infatuation at least. They also pick up a new companion along the way, a winged monkey named Finley who swears a life debt to Oscar after he saves the little monkey from a seemingly fierce lion. Through the means of his parlor tricks, Oscar manages to keep his new friends mesmerized until they reach the palace and encounter the distrusting Evanora. Here Oscar learns that in order to take the throne, he first must rid the land of the wicked witch, so Oscar sets out to attempt just that, meeting even more new friends along the way, and ultimately having to prove himself a truly great wizard to have any hope of beating the challenges he is soon to face.Taking on the job of making an original prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" would be a challenging task for anyone, and director Sam Raimi (of the Spider-Man and Evil Dead trilogies) seems as good a man for the job as any. Amazingly, he pulled it off with great success! Financial success, at least. To Disney, the company who produced this project, that must mean a lot, since their 1985 attempt at an Oz sequel, ""Return to Oz"" (arguably a better film in many ways) was a financial failure and often panned for being too dark for its target audience (even though a huge amount of 80's kids love that movie to this day, making it a cult classic at this point).Of course, there's more to a film than money, so, despite the fact that ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" earned back more than twice its HUGE budget, is it really a good movie? Well, honestly, it is not perfect, and some of the flaws are pretty huge, but it IS a really enjoyable experience, at least to this huge fan of the 1939 Oz film as well as Return to Oz and various other adaptations.The problems that the movie has are as follows (spoilers ahead, though you probably know this much already): Most significantly, Mila Kunis, cast in role of Theadora, also becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Now, one of the things I love about this film is that it tries to be very true to the MGM classic as much as possible, though not always, but more on that later. However, whether they were trying to do that or not, if you are going to include the Wicked Witch of the West in your Oz movie, you need to try to capture Margaret Hamilton as closely as you can. Let's face it, Mayim Bialik would have made far more sense in this role than Mila Kunis, a young actress best known for her beauty. Mila has some good comedic chops in That 70's Show, and I've liked her in a few other things, and she definitely gives this role her all, even though a lot of the acting in this film is just okay (another issue one might have with it), but, even with an elaborate makeup job, it is... difficult to get into this version of the Wicked Witch. Mila's voice is just too distinctive, and I'd say that is the main problem. Her voice simply does not work as the Wicked Witch of the West. And, speaking of that makeup job... This is a bit sad to say, but here's another place where Raimi just made a bad decision. He likes a lot of makeup on his witches, but this would have worked a lot better with the first concept, a prosthetic nose and chin, and green makeup. Basically putting an entire mask on Mila just didn't look good. She looked like the sister of Jim Carrey IN ""The Mask"". So, basically, despite some very cool qualities to match it up with the classic movie, which is what every Oz film is held up to, the biggest problem with this one is the Wicked Witch of the West, particularly her voice and her makeup. Besides that, I mentioned the acting a bit. It was serviceable, and the performers have a certain level of charm that you, as a viewer, may be willing to make allowances for. However, I hope you can do that for another character too. There is a character called ""China Girl"" who is basically a living porcelain doll. Sounds creepy, but she is actually very beautiful and sweet, and one of the most sympathetic characters you'll ever see. Yet, shortly after a powerful scene, she is, if briefly, turned into a typically annoying, sassy kid sidekick character. The annoying part doesn't last long, but why do that at all? There were some instances like that, where the modern sensibilities, especially in regards to kid-movie humor, took the film down a notch when it otherwise could have been deemed quite timeless.Still, that's about all I can say that is noteworthy on the subject of flaws. And, even when discussing the acting, especially choosing James Franco to star in the film as Oscar Diggs, well, though Robert Downey Jr. is rumored to have been desired for the role, I'm kinda glad this went to someone like Franco. I love Downey, but I think he could have been too much for this film. I think there is a lot to enjoy in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", and even if I didn't love the casting of Kunis, I think the other characters are part of that (Rachel Weisz really steals the show as Evanora), and, it is hard to explain, but I feel like Downey's personality is so big that it would have taken away too much from everything and everyone else in this picture. Anyway, can you imagine Downey becoming the bumbling, embarrassed ""man behind the curtain"" of the classic MGM film? I can't, but I can see that character coming from Franco's less enormous personality. So, I'm good with that.Now, as for what's awesome about this movie, where do I start? I mean, visually, it's amazing, but yes, it's a lot of CGI. It kinda works here though. I mean, this film is heavily influenced by the MGM classic, it makes no attempt at hiding that, and that is really what I love most about this movie. And, how did they do the sets in the MGM film? They were clearly right there on a set. They were often performing in front of painted backgrounds. There was just something so beautiful about it that you didn't even notice it much as a kid, or it didn't bother you. And, in some scenes in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"", it almost seems like they are on the same sets! Some of the Yellow Brick Road scenes, for example, and some of the Emerald City scenes. For fans of the classic film, this SHOULD be quite pleasing. It is nothing like Return to Oz, which was fantastic in its own way, intending to be much closer to the books, and much darker. Like the `39 film, this movie is bright, and colorful, and only a few times can you tell that either they had to change something for legal reasons or they wanted to be truer to the book (probably the first one), such as with Glinda being the Good Witch of the South here instead of the North, and Oscar not coming from the Omaha State Fair here, but in an unmarked balloon from a traveling circus. One can assume that if the famous slippers are mentioned in any sequels, they will probably be silver, like in the book (which would be disappointing; they shelled out a lot of dough to make them ruby slippers in Return to Oz, and that movie wasn't anything like the MGM movie that invented the ruby versions). This movie is FULL of references to the `39 film, and most are quite beautifully and loyally done. As I said, this is a great highlight of the movie! it's why this movie is great! But what really sealed the deal for me was the third act. Remember how amazing the third act of Star Wars Episode 3 was? It set everything up for the classic film we know and love. It was the closest the Star Wars prequels got to the original classics. Well, the third act of ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is that same kind of amazing. We get to see a fantastically written setup, if very Army of Darkness-like, of how Oscar Diggs became the Wizard of Oz in the way we best knew him from the `39 ""Wizard of Oz"" film. It's fantastic, even with the awkwardness of Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch. Also, as I mentioned before, Rachel Weisz is just amazing in this. No matter what I might be able to think of to complain about in this film, that final act would make nearly anything worth sitting through. I LOVED that part of this film. But, I liked a lot about the rest of it.Now, before I wrap this up, I don't want to forget to address something. I've seen some of the online reviews. There are those on some video review sites I quite enjoy, who have ranted about how terrible one aspect of this film is, and that's the section, kind of something carried through the film as a plot point, in which Theadora falls in love with Oscar. I've heard ranting about how ridiculous this was, because it happened so fast. These two had just met, and she was immediately in love with him. I'm a bit baffled that net critics I respect would see it this way. It is quite clear, to me anyway, that Theodora was infatuated with Oscar. She believed she was in love with him, but what she loved was the idea of him and the idea of being with him, as he was the man from the prophecy she'd grown up waiting for. She was probably in love with him long before he ever showed up in Oz. She clearly wasn't truly in love with him, anyway, as she quickly turned to hating him. Yes, this was partly due to a curse that destroyed her heart, but it was also because her feelings for him were never truly real. She was like a girl who falls in love with The Beatles or Justin Beiber. She was innocent and not to bright, and she had a great potential for wickedness in her. She was actually very much like Anakin Skywalker, the more I think about it. They're a couple of idiots, really.Anyway, that's the movie, and overall, I really love this one, even with its flaws. All I really wish is that someone else had been cast as the Wicked Witch of the West, or at the very least, that they didn't use full-on face prosthetics. Nevertheless, I recommend this movie very highly.Now, as for the Blu-Ray release, I own the combo pack with DVD and digital copy, and though it stinks when something like this doesn't come with a commentary, I do love the extras that are included. We get fun bloopers, we get a James Franco helmed featurette of interviews with the cast and even director Raimi, and we get a fantastic collection of behind the scenes featurettes. Besides that, we get the great ""Walt Disney and the Road to Oz"", which gives us a look at Walt and his company's history with the Oz books and the attempts to turn them into movies. I'm glad they didn't do it in the style of ""Babes in Toyland"", as originally planned, though I do wish they'd done an Oz film in the Mary Poppins style, as probably would have happened if Wald hadn't passed away not long after. Another bonus feature is Disney's Second Screen, which I nearly forgot to mention, probably because I have no use for this. It's kinda like making DVD-Rom only extras. I'm just not going to bother with them.And, that's about it! Oz the Great and Powerful, it's got issues, but it's a really great film! I'm so happy to finally own my own copy to watch again and again, and I look forward to the sequels. All the merits of this film make dealing with Kunis as the Wicked Witch of the West worthwhile. Take a look at this one if you can, and if you like it, be sure to also see the original classic, not to mention ""Return to Oz"" and the animated ""Journey Back to Oz"" and ""Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz"". And, you also might want to catch James Franco in ""This Is the End,"" currently in theaters (though it's NOT a family film like this one). Now, I just wish the ABC Saturday Morning Wizard of Oz cartoon, based specifically on the `39 film, would get a DVD release soon too!

I loved the music,wanted to be the Tin Man,and was terrified of the Wicked Witch. When I first heard the news a prequel to the original Oz movie was coming I was actually in the process of doodling a picture of the scarecrow!coincidence?The last real Oz movie we had seen was Return To Oz which wasn't bad in its own way but it certainly didn't compare to the 1939 film.So how does Oz the Great And Powerful standup to the original?First and foremost their,at least to me can only be one Wizard Of Oz. It was a product of its time and it can't be recreated,but wow,just simply wow. Sam Raimi and company really found the right balance here. This film pays a great amount of homage to the original but makes it ""modern"" enough for a new audience as well. It doesn't ever compete with the original,it instead builds from it. The characters are all great as well,my favorite being China Girl.My only real gripe with the film is that I felt it started to drag a little towards its conclusion. I  simply felt their was no real buildup to the finale. This isn't a knock at the finale itself (which was great).3D: Simply stunning. Not just the 3D either. The visuals as a whole are,for lack of a better word,gushing. From colorfully bright flowers and birds popping out of the screen,to graveyards covered in creeping fog,to small town black and white Kansas, Oz has many amazing sights to behold and they're all sure to knock you out with the biggest grin you'll ever have on your face. Oz doesn't just focus on the major details either. Their was small attention to detail that just amazed me as well. Something as simple as a waterfall flowing in the background. This will without a doubt,be a keeper in your 3D collection.In conclusion, Oz The Great & Powerful is as visually stunning as Avatar on all fronts with enough heart to really make it a great movie. Just like the Wizard himself this film is charming and perhaps at times not sure of itself but that's just part of the Wizards grand and epic show.",5,"4 stars for the movie,5 stars for the 3D.

1642372,AGOEKVIJV9UX6,B00C5W3SBE,Mr. Markster,"[3, 5]","One of the biggest plot twists in the ""Wizard of Oz"" was discovering that the ""mystical"" and ""almighty"" Oz was nothing of the sort. When Dorothy and company finally meet him, the ""great"" Oz is just a goofy, kind hearted con man and talented illusionist. This new ""prequel"" introduces us further to the titular character and cleverly tells us the story of how this dodgy con artist becomes the wonderful Wizard of Oz. I thought James Franco was incredibly entertaining as the less-than-scrupulous illusionist who attempts to right all of his wrong-doings as the film progresses. While most of the residents of Oz belive his illusions are ""true"" magic, a handful of characters - his closest allies and enemies alike- know he is just an illusionist. In fact, the coolest aspect of the movie is seeing how a mere illusionist does battle with true spell-casters. He will require the help of a flying monkey in a bellboy suit, a fiesty china doll and Glenda, the good witch. All these characters, particularly the china doll, are really entertaining.It's also absolute eye candy. ""Oz"" is arguably one of the most colorful movies I've ever seen (right up there with Avatar and Speed Racer for its bold popping color pallette). Colors are lush and practically burst from the screen; the production value is jaw dropping- whether in the dark forest, or on the streets of Emerald City or the war-torn China Town. The mix of live action, animation and CGI is wonderfully realized, all while still maintaining the feel and charm reminiscent of the ""Wizard of Oz.""I've watched both movies back to back and they play wonderfully off one another. The new Oz prequel is actually a very well made movie that maintains the playfulness and energy of the 1939 film. It is a very fun, incredibly entertaining movie. It's fun to see how things are set up in this movie that will play out in ""The Wizard of Oz.""As for the negative reviews... It never ceases to amaze me just how ridiculous some of the film critics come across. Negative reviews aimed at this movie include: over acting and thinly developed characters. Interestingly, it can be easily argued that the ""Wizard of Oz"" is just as guilty of the exact same things. For instance, niether the Tin Man, The Scarcrow, Dorothy or Toto come across as ""deep"" characters. They are as thinly developed as any of the characters this prequel is charged with. And the over acting? Would anyone dare suggest that there was no over acting in the 1939 classic? It just seems a tad hypocritical to condemn one movie yet praise another while both share very similar attributes.Oh, and let's not forget the hordes of critics who condemned this movie because the iconic wicked witch's transformation didn't provide audiences with a slow, psychological descent into madness that is apparently appropriate for all villians to undego since the Dark Knight (ala the Joker or Bane). Again, where are all these psychologically ""tragic"" villians in other children's classics? The Ice Age films? Bed knobs and Broomsticks? the Herbie movies? How about Dumbo, Cars, Shrek, Mary Poppins, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin, the Muppets, or even The Wizard of Oz?Overall, Oz is a treat that pays respect to its predecessor and cleverly plays off it. Highly entertaining and absolute eye candy to boot. Don't listen to the critics on this one.

1642373,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B00C5W3SBE,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[3, 3]","I have to be honest, I can&#8217;t quite understand the vitriol that some people have harboured towards this film.  The idea of making another film in the world of Oz seems at first to be sacriligeous.. and yet as the movie rumbled on past the slightly overlong prologue in &#8216;real world&#8217;, I found myself quite enchanted.  For sure, it was more by the spectacle &#8211; the colours and definition really pop off the screen in this bluray edition.  But the story works, even if the lines the actors are given can be a bit clunky, and there is a genuine sense of wonder in seeing this world.  It&#8217;s one of the most satisfying blend of special effects and cgi working seamlessly to make the story work I&#8217;ve seen in a while.  Talking monkeys have never been so believable.To give away anything about the plot would be a shame, sufficient to say it is about the origins of the Wizard of Oz, and his confrontation with the wicked witch.  What&#8217;s more important is that it&#8217;s a treat to have a movie transport you somewhere, and this movie does that, particularly from the moment the sepia toned opening to the widescreen visually spectacular world of Oz.  In that regard, Sam Raimi was just the man for this job, making a movie that stands on its own merit, with his Raimi touches giving it just the right amount of darkness, and yet with sufficient nods and homages to the original for the observant and imagination in abundance.  If the acting can be theatrical, it&#8217;s because this is a fable not kitchen sink drama.  The cast are more or less up to the task.. Franco is a slightly odd choice for the wizard, but it works, not least because of the support from Rachel Weisz in a fine performance.  Mila Kunis and Michelle Williams do an ok job of keeping up with Weisz&#8217;s bad witch schtick, but Williams in particular seems to struggle a bit to give her character any dimension..  In short, it&#8217;s the sort of movie that is more likely to tell you about the characters feeling or direction through their makeup and wardrobe than the acting or script.Nothing is likely to match the hold on people&#8217;s hearts the original has, but we could hardly expect a more satisfying blend of spectacle, drama and a little humour than this.  The sugar rush you get from the most lovingly and imaginatively created world zinging off the screen more than compensates for the lack of spice in the chemistry of the leads.

1642383,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00C5W3SBE,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[2, 3]","How a small time circus magician became the Great and Powerful OZ. Some elements of this film will seem familliar as they try to keep a bridge to the original classic and touch on the book series which is far more extensive than the movies to which we have been treated.  The story line could have certainly used a touch more meat.  However, I felt they did a good job of freshening and fleshing out the story.  I own the disc.  Naturally our tale begins with the circus magician who is a good hearted charlatan who dreams of being more.  He is a bit of a player with the ladies and finds himself in conflict with the circus strongman (whose wife he previously charmed).  As he runs away, he jumps in the hot air balloon and is carried off by an approaching tornado.  When he lands in OZ, he is caught up in the prophecy of the great wizard who will save the land from conflict with the wicked witch.  He forms a bond with Theodora (who we know will eventually become the iconic Wicked Witch of the West, though she is not yet evil).The performance by Michelle Williams (Glinda the good witch) and Joey King (porcelian doll), along with the artistry behind the CGI save this movie from a fate worse than flying grey monster monkeys.  Michelle brings her own charm and style to a beloved character in an updated way.  She is every bit the kind and ravishing good witch.  Joey King is given a character new to us in the porcelain doll made of what looks like blue delft.  She brings all the feeling and stage presence required to endear the character to us and make us love her.  Rachel Weiss also has the necessary projection for a great character, though that character isn't developed much despite her central role.  The artistry of the movie and CGI deserve the 6th man award to borrow a sports term.  The world we are presented when the magician lands in OZ is enchanting, haunting, gorgeous!  It was definitely meant to be seen in 3D.  The giant flowers, the otherworldly hills, the foggy dark forest, the amazing creatures, all are an absolute visual feast.  The Blue Delft village (in ruin by the time we see it) was a brilliant artistic idea and conveys lots of Dutch feel without having to tell you what it is.  The design, character development, and image of the porcelain doll was also absolutely beautiful.  The 3D presentation is fantastic and tailor made for the format as we have image after image that either stands out to us or moves from us back into the set.  From opening credits to the close we are stimulated by 3D images that have little ghosting and great variance of depth.  Vibrant humming birds, snowflakes, and floating dandelion wisps give us plenty of flotsam and jetsam in the middle of the screen to dazzle us.  The little companion monkey is the only thing I felt was a little less than lifelike at times, and that is a small quibble compared to what else we get.  Reference or near reference quality.Also on the negative side, I felt there were a couple of casting errors.  A great fantasy like this requires larger than life acting.  We are in an age where actors are trying to be as natural as possible.  That's good but, it isn't what was needed here.  James Franco is the worst of the miscasting as he has none of the showmanship of a circus ringmaster or magician.  He grimaces mightily as he tries to bring animation to his subject.  It's just not him.  He has no gravitas.  Mila Kunis is stunningly beautiful in the early images they create before she becomes evil.  Her exotic facial features are loved by the camera and the fantasy atmosphere.  I love her as an actress.  However, she has a very contemporary style.  I don't feel the weakness of her character is her fault, but that of the casting director.  She doesn't have the vocal essence required to create the eerie, evil persona that will follow.  She is better at ""life like"" than projecting ""larger than life"".  The makeup artists did her no favors as she becomes the Wicked Witch of the West (Perhaps the most iconic figure in the whole movie).  They give her a frozen, smooth, almost expressionless face with only pointed eyebrows and chin to convey the evil.  Pure plastic.  Instead of a natural bony chin, it looks like they glued a lemon juicer to her face, it's so fat.  They fail to make her as ugly as they made her hauntingly beautiful before.This movie is terrific and worth owning.  Sadly, it had potential to be an all time classic, almost as great as the original, and comes up short.  A couple casting calls, a shortened script, a different outcome than what could have been.  Such easily avoided mistakes cost a possible masterpiece.",4,MOVIE AND 3D REVIEW -- Stunning visuals & what could've been....,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,4650,"['How', 'small', 'time', 'circus', 'magician', 'became', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'OZ', 'elements', 'film', 'will', 'seem', 'familliar', 'try', 'keep', 'bridge', 'original', 'classic', 'touch', 'book', 'series', 'far', 'more', 'extensive', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'story', 'line', 'could', 'have', 'certainly', 'used', 'touch', 'more', 'meat', 'However', 'felt', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'freshening', 'fleshing', 'out', 'story', 'own', 'disc', 'Naturally', 'tale', 'circus', 'magician', 'who', 'good', 'hearted', 'charlatan', 'who', 'being', 'more', 'bit', 'player', 'ladies', 'conflict', 'circus', 'strongman', 'wife', 'previously', 'charmed', 'away', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'carried', 'off', 'approaching', 'tornado', 'When', 'OZ', 'caught', 'up', 'prophecy', 'great', 'wizard', 'who', 'will', 'save', 'land', 'conflict', 'wicked', 'witch', 'bond', 'Theodora', 'who', 'know', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'iconic', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'not', 'yet', 'evil', '.The', 'performance', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Glinda', 'good', 'witch', 'Joey', 'King', 'porcelian', 'doll', 'artistry', 'CGI', 'save', 'movie', 'fate', 'worse', 'flying', 'grey', 'monster', 'monkeys', 'Michelle', 'own', 'charm', 'style', 'beloved', 'character', 'updated', 'way', 'bit', 'kind', 'ravishing', 'good', 'witch', 'Joey', 'King', 'given', 'character', 'new', 'porcelain', 'doll', 'made', 'what', 'blue', 'delft', 'feeling', 'stage', 'presence', 'required', 'endear', 'character', 'make', 'love', 'Rachel', 'Weiss', 'also', 'necessary', 'projection', 'great', 'character', 'character', ""n't"", 'developed', 'much', 'central', 'role', 'artistry', 'movie', 'CGI', 'deserve', '6th', 'man', 'award', 'borrow', 'sports', 'term', 'world', 'are', 'presented', 'when', 'magician', 'lands', 'OZ', 'enchanting', 'haunting', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'definitely', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', '3D', 'giant', 'flowers', 'otherworldly', 'hills', 'foggy', 'dark', 'forest', 'amazing', 'creatures', 'are', 'absolute', 'visual', 'feast', 'Blue', 'Delft', 'village', 'ruin', 'time', 'see', 'was', 'brilliant', 'artistic', 'idea', 'conveys', 'lots', 'Dutch', 'feel', 'having', 'tell', 'what', 'design', 'character', 'development', 'image', 'porcelain', 'doll', 'was', 'also', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', '3D', 'presentation', 'fantastic', 'tailor', 'made', 'format', 'have', 'image', 'image', 'out', 'moves', 'back', 'set', 'opening', 'credits', 'close', 'are', 'stimulated', '3D', 'images', 'have', 'little', 'ghosting', 'great', 'variance', 'depth', 'Vibrant', 'humming', 'birds', 'snowflakes', 'floating', 'dandelion', 'wisps', 'give', 'plenty', 'flotsam', 'jetsam', 'middle', 'screen', 'dazzle', 'little', 'companion', 'monkey', 'only', 'thing', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'less', 'lifelike', 'times', 'small', 'quibble', 'compared', 'what', 'else', 'get', 'Reference', 'reference', 'quality.Also', 'negative', 'side', 'felt', 'were', 'couple', 'casting', 'errors', 'great', 'fantasy', 'larger', 'life', 'acting', 'are', 'age', 'where', 'actors', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'as', 'natural', 'possible', 'good', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'needed', 'here', 'James', 'Franco', 'worst', 'miscasting', 'none', 'showmanship', 'circus', 'ringmaster', 'magician', 'mightily', 'bring', 'animation', 'subject', 'just', 'not', 'gravitas', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'early', 'images', 'create', 'evil', 'exotic', 'facial', 'features', 'are', 'loved', 'camera', 'fantasy', 'atmosphere', 'love', 'actress', 'However', 'very', 'contemporary', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'weakness', 'character', 'fault', 'casting', 'director', ""n't"", 'have', 'vocal', 'essence', 'required', 'create', 'eerie', 'evil', 'persona', 'will', 'follow', 'better', 'life', 'projecting', 'larger', 'life', 'makeup', 'did', 'no', 'favors', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'iconic', 'figure', 'whole', 'movie', 'give', 'frozen', 'smooth', 'almost', 'expressionless', 'face', 'only', 'pointed', 'eyebrows', 'chin', 'convey', 'evil', 'Pure', 'plastic', 'Instead', 'natural', 'bony', 'chin', 'glued', 'lemon', 'juicer', 'face', 'so', 'fat', 'fail', 'make', 'as', 'ugly', 'made', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'before.This', 'movie', 'terrific', 'worth', 'owning', 'Sadly', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'time', 'classic', 'almost', 'as', 'great', 'original', 'up', 'short', 'couple', 'casting', 'calls', 'shortened', 'script', 'different', 'outcome', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Such', 'easily', 'avoided', 'mistakes', 'cost', 'possible', 'masterpiece']",N/A

My biggest problem with Franco and his films is that he's either fantastic or seems like he's bored to tears with the material Most of the time, it's the latter. However, his performance in Oz is middle of the road. Through about the first half, he's hos typical stoic, wooden self, but then he picks it up around the middle and ends fairly strong, if not a little over the top, something that I think Downey is much more adept at pulling off than Franco, so yes, I wish Downey had stayed on.The story is actually pretty solid. Remember that this isn't a re-make of the original Wizard of Oz, it's a prequel. Sure, it's not great and it certainly wouldn't win an Oscar for best screenplay, but it entertains and I personally found it to be very enjoyable..SFX wise, it's a definite home run. Very colorful and lively. Perfect for the land of Oz.The supporting cast is pretty good as well. I loved Zach Braff as Money and Joey King as China Girl Mila Kunis was all right as Theodora, but I preferred Rachel Weisz's Evanora by a longshot. Kunis seemed though she was forcing the wickedness out of herself, whereas, Weisz seemed to transition seamlessly from salty princess to wicked witch like it was nothing.In the end, it's a rent-worthy movie, though I wouldn't buy it unless you really enjoyed it a lot.

1642393,ADKKDZGDVEVWZ,B00C5W3SBE,NHMovieLover,"[19, 37]","After reading all the other reviews for Oz The Great and Powerful, I question if we actually saw the same movie? Personally I found that this film was extremely disappointing. Without going into what the movie was about and who played whom, I am going to review what I found extremely disappointing in this film. Of course this is in no way a judgement, just my own observation. #1 the casting was poorly done. I am an avid lover of the original film and to place James Franco in the earlier role of Frank Morgan was just completely poor judgement. Then Mila Kunis as Margaret Hamilton? Granted, I do like the story line of how The Wicked Witch of the West came into fruitation but Mila Kunis? Really? Lets not get me going on Michelle Williams as the younger version of Bubbly and cheerful Billie Burke. The casting was all wrong for this film. #2 the costumes was another HUGE disappointment to me. Part of the magical allure of the original were there fun costumes. It was sad to see Disney couldn't be bothered to mask those costumes. The quick scene with the few munchkins looking poor and shabby was pathetic not to mention that the people of Emerald City looked like they were wearing every day clothing that weren't even green and lets not even mention the horse of a thousand colors that looked like they were wearing a blanket with multiple colors on it. #3 Mila Kunis costume as the Wicked Witch of the West looked more like the broadway musical ""Wicked"" costume rather then the one that Margaret Hamilton wore. and Michelle Williams Costume or crown didn't resemble Glinda's costume at all. Looked like a gown one would wear on the red carpet. Granted some may argue that Disney was trying to modernize the movie but in my opinion, if you are going to make a prequel then you pay attention to details. We have become a sad society whose interests focus on ""Special Effects"" rather then ""Art"". Just goes to prove that todays generations can not touch ""Old Hollywood"" Talents(both on the screen and behind the scenes). For those who have not seen this film, my opinion is, save your money, it was HIGHLY disappointing to one who thoroughly enjoys and prefers ""Grade A"" movies to trash.",1,A Flop for Disney,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,2195,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'question', 'actually', 'saw', 'same', 'movie', 'Personally', 'found', 'film', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'going', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'who', 'played', 'whom', 'am', 'going', 'review', 'what', 'found', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'film', 'course', 'way', 'judgement', 'just', 'own', 'observation', '1', 'casting', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'am', 'avid', 'lover', 'original', 'film', 'place', 'James', 'Franco', 'earlier', 'role', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'was', 'just', 'completely', 'poor', 'judgement', 'Then', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'Granted', 'do', 'story', 'line', 'how', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'came', 'fruitation', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Really', 'not', 'get', 'going', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'younger', 'version', 'Bubbly', 'cheerful', 'Billie', 'Burke', 'casting', 'was', 'wrong', 'film', '2', 'costumes', 'was', 'HUGE', 'disappointment', 'Part', 'magical', 'allure', 'original', 'were', 'fun', 'costumes', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'Disney', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'mask', 'costumes', 'quick', 'scene', 'few', 'munchkins', 'looking', 'poor', 'shabby', 'was', 'pathetic', 'not', 'mention', 'people', 'Emerald', 'City', 'looked', 'were', 'wearing', 'day', 'clothing', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'green', 'not', 'even', 'mention', 'horse', 'thousand', 'colors', 'looked', 'were', 'wearing', 'blanket', 'multiple', 'colors', '3', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'costume', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'looked', 'more', 'broadway', 'musical', 'Wicked', 'costume', 'rather', 'then', 'one', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'wore', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Costume', 'crown', 'did', ""n't"", 'resemble', 'Glinda', 'costume', 'Looked', 'gown', 'one', 'would', 'wear', 'red', 'carpet', 'Granted', 'may', 'argue', 'Disney', 'was', 'trying', 'modernize', 'movie', 'opinion', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'prequel', 'then', 'pay', 'attention', 'details', 'have', 'become', 'sad', 'society', 'interests', 'focus', 'Special', 'Effects', 'rather', 'then', 'Art', 'Just', 'prove', 'todays', 'generations', 'can', 'not', 'touch', 'Old', 'Hollywood', 'Talents', 'screen', 'scenes', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'opinion', 'save', 'money', 'was', 'HIGHLY', 'disappointing', 'one', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'prefers', 'Grade', 'movies', 'trash']",N/A

Second the story was very boring the colors were great and so were the animated characters but the story did not have any really good points to it and about a hour and a half into the film I turned it off. As for a family film not so much children would get frightened by some of the characters and they made Oz too much of a ladies man and also they could have done without Mila Kunis taking off the top of her dress even though something was underneath when she was turning into the wicked witch. Honestly I was not impressed and expected a much better movie they should stop trying to base films off the original because you cannot outbeat &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; it is a classic and I have an open mind but this did not cut it.

Somehow the actors never transcend beyond their more common methods of portrayal and I often found myself thinking more about the actors' personality than the personality of the character. I could just not get into James Franco's version of OZ. He did not play a very convincing period vaudevillian magician as he simply just did not exude that type of demeanor. An unfortunate aspect as this film must hinge on him as the leading man and his personal journey and discoveries through the fantasy kingdom. As a result of his underwhelming delivery I found myself kind of bored by him at the beginning, but I started to care more about him towards the end, even though his Oz was a jerk. Much of the same befell the lovely Mila Kunis' character as well though she did at times display a fieriness that sort of jolts you back into the film. The other actors did fair for what they were given.This film may delight young children as the action is frenetic, the colors are vivid, the sounds are booming, and the chills are at times genuine. But the plainly obvious reality is that this film was made as another cash grab vehicle that fits in the bombastically colorful and spectacularly lavish visual effects package that Hollywood has been content at churning out for a couple of decades now. Its really everything you'd expect from films like these nowadays. All the money is up on the screen eager to delight and assault your senses; and all this with little of the charm that is present in older films about the wonderful world of Oz. But who needs charm nowadays when you have 3D glasses! Recommend only on a lazy afternoon when you and the family have exhausted the Pixar library.P.S. I was delighted to find out that Bruce Campbell was in this film and eagerly awaited to see which character he would portray and hopefully lift up this, at times, dullard film.

1642414,AUQ3TDD2IBSUX,B00C5W3SBE,Oz Enthusiast,"[0, 0]","As an extreme lover of the original movie (I own it in several media), I am extremely leary of any movie that has anything to do with The Wizard of Oz. So when I read they were making a movie about how the wizard becomes the wizard, I ranted & raged that they were going to ruin the story. Plus, how would a good looking James Franco ever become Frank Morgan's wizard? A lot of questions ran through my mind. I had many conversations with friends about how this movie would never compare to the original. What about the Munchkins (my personal favorite characters, after the wicked witch), how would they be created? And the witch? Who could possibly play the part of a Margaret Hamilton witch?Well the movie came out. Of course I saw it in 3D. All my rantings left me. I was awed by the beauty of this movie. I fell in love with it! The writers did a great job in telling the wizard's story, but could've done better with the dialog. And it's also the witches' story. We learn how those 3 characters become who they are in the WOO. In a way, this movie has nothing to do with WOO because that was Dorothy's story.But I still have issues with the new movie:1. The costumes weren't as outrageous as they were in WOO, especially the Munchkins.  One of my favorites is the &#34;shoes&#34; the Munchkins wear, with the flower on the front bopping around. Where were those? Their costumes were plain, not colorful at all.2.  I really enjoyed James Franco, but he's still too good looking to turn into Frank Morgan.3.  Same goes for Mila Kunis. She was also much too pretty to become Margaret Hamilton's wicked witch, especially after she changed into the witch.4.  Emerald City was nothing like it is in the original. Are we to assume that it was reconstructed later on?5.  And what about the balloon Oz travels in to the land of Oz? In WOO, Oz still has his original balloon. In the new movie, it gets destroyed and the tinker builds him a new one. Bad continuity.6.  The new movie shows that Oz might have been imagining the whole thing. Consider this: he lands in a world that happens to be his name, Glinda happens to be the woman he really loves (Annie), the China girl has broken legs like the girl at the festival whom he couldn't 'fix', his friend Frank is a monkey (he refers to Frank as a monkey during an argument). But the interesting thing is Annie when she tells Oz that she got a marriage proposal from a man whose last name is Gale, which is Dorothy's last name. So does she become Dorothy's mother? In making this reference, is this then an actual event (in the story) or is it still Oz's imagination?As anyone who reads this can see, I am a fanatic when it comes to the Wizard of Oz. If you love the story, I believe you will love Oz, The Great and Powerful, even with all my comments and speculations.

I was surprised Oz the Great and Powerful was as good as it is.Much of its success is a result of some very impressive and beautiful CGI effects.There was a lot of disappointment, and even anger, as shown in many of the reviews here,about this movie.  I don't know what people expected but I found myself fairly satisfiedwith most of the aspects of it.The script is the weakest aspect, using terminology that did not exist in 1905, the time thismovie is set within.  People just didn't say 'WOW' and things like that, at least I don't recallseeing that word in any literature from that era.  Little anachronisms like that pop up withregularity and stand out like pimples on an otherwise lovely complexion.I didn't have a problem with any of the cast.  James Franco is very good as the charlatancarnival side-show magician.  His transition to the Wizard of Oz flows naturally out of thebackground of his character's life, and the tie-in with his Kansas life and that of his Oz lifeis thought-provoking and touching.Seeing this movie made me wonder if Oz hadn't really died in the tornado and what we areviewing IS his experience of heaven.Nods to The Wizard of Oz are frequent and apt.  The blonde woman who truly loves Ozin Kansas turns out to be Auntie Em, as she tells him she has been asked by John Gale,Auntie Em's husband in The Wizard of Oz, to marry him.Then Oz is blown away by the twister and finds Auntie Em as Glinda the Good Witch ofthe South.  At least that is my take on it.  It's there in the script.The three witches are all very good as well.  Rachel Weisz is wonderful as Evanora, whoI think is probably the witch in the stripy stockings in The Wizard of Oz who has beenkilled by Dorothy's falling house.Mila Kunis, aside from her occasional Bronx accent, is a beguiling Theodora.  Her broken-heart, caused by the callous Oz, and her transformation into thegreen-fleshed, as in poisoned by jealousy, Wicked Witch of the West, is entirely believable.Michelle Williams could easily have been a saccharin Disney Princess type, she looks it, butshe is given most of the funniest lines and she delivers them with a pretty poker face andslight twitches of her mouth.  Of the three witches hers could have been the biggest flopat a characterization but her Glinda is one of the big acting successes here.The supporting cast is by turns funny and endearing in the Disney manner.  Perhaps thatannoyed people, but the Quidlings, Munchkins and Dinkies are not any more cloying andannoying than their 1939 counterparts.The China Girl, surprisingly, is not twee or irritating either, as child actors can often be,especially in a Disney flick.Danny Elfman was the obvious choice to score this movie.  It isn't his most memorablemusic but it is never becomes banal bombast in the action scenes, and there are plentyof catchy tunes that linger in the mind but are quickly forgotten once the movie ends.Unlike his best musical scores like the Batman movies, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks! andPee Wee's Big Adventure.  I think there was a missed opportunity as Theodora and Ozcome over the hill and encounter the Emerald City for the first time in the movie.The music does not rise to occasion in my opinion.  It is not the awesome momentit could have been.So I give this excellent DISNEY movie four stars.  It would have been top-drawer had thescript been more carefully worked out.",4,"It's top-drawer for Disney, but the script ain't so hot",1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,3503,"['was', 'brave', 'Disney', 'make', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'given', 'fame', 'great', 'respect', 'givento', 'Wizard', 'Oz', '1939', 'was', 'surprised', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'success', 'result', 'very', 'impressive', 'beautiful', 'CGI', 'effects.There', 'was', 'lot', 'disappointment', 'even', 'anger', 'shown', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'people', 'expected', 'found', 'fairly', 'satisfiedwith', 'most', 'aspects', 'it.The', 'script', 'weakest', 'aspect', 'using', 'terminology', 'did', 'not', 'exist', '1905', 'time', 'thismovie', 'set', 'People', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', ""'WOW"", 'things', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'recallseeing', 'word', 'literature', 'era', 'Little', 'anachronisms', 'pop', 'up', 'withregularity', 'stand', 'out', 'pimples', 'otherwise', 'lovely', 'complexion.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'cast', 'James', 'Franco', 'very', 'good', 'charlatancarnival', 'side-show', 'magician', 'transition', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'naturally', 'thebackground', 'character', 'life', 'tie-in', 'Kansas', 'life', 'Oz', 'lifeis', 'thought-provoking', 'touching.Seeing', 'movie', 'made', 'wonder', 'Oz', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'died', 'tornado', 'what', 'areviewing', 'IS', 'experience', 'heaven.Nods', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'are', 'frequent', 'apt', 'blonde', 'woman', 'who', 'loves', 'Ozin', 'Kansas', 'out', 'be', 'Auntie', 'Em', 'been', 'asked', 'John', 'Gale', 'Auntie', 'Em', 'husband', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'marry', 'him.Then', 'Oz', 'blown', 'away', 'twister', 'Auntie', 'Em', 'Glinda', 'Good', 'Witch', 'South', 'least', 'take', 'there', 'script.The', 'three', 'witches', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'wonderful', 'Evanora', 'whoI', 'think', 'probably', 'witch', 'stripy', 'stockings', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'who', 'beenkilled', 'Dorothy', 'falling', 'house.Mila', 'Kunis', 'aside', 'occasional', 'Bronx', 'accent', 'beguiling', 'Theodora', 'broken-heart', 'caused', 'callous', 'Oz', 'transformation', 'thegreen-fleshed', 'poisoned', 'jealousy', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'entirely', 'believable.Michelle', 'Williams', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'saccharin', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'type', 'butshe', 'given', 'most', 'funniest', 'lines', 'pretty', 'poker', 'face', 'andslight', 'twitches', 'mouth', 'three', 'witches', 'hers', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'biggest', 'flopat', 'characterization', 'Glinda', 'one', 'big', 'acting', 'here.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'turns', 'funny', 'endearing', 'Disney', 'manner', 'Perhaps', 'thatannoyed', 'people', 'Quidlings', 'Munchkins', 'Dinkies', 'are', 'not', 'more', 'cloying', 'andannoying', '1939', 'counterparts.The', 'China', 'Girl', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'twee', 'irritating', 'either', 'child', 'actors', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'especially', 'Disney', 'flick.Danny', 'Elfman', 'was', 'obvious', 'choice', 'score', 'movie', ""n't"", 'most', 'memorablemusic', 'never', 'becomes', 'banal', 'bombast', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'plentyof', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'linger', 'mind', 'are', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'once', 'movie', 'best', 'musical', 'scores', 'Batman', 'movies', 'Beetlejuice', 'Mars', 'Attacks', 'andPee', 'Wee', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'think', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Theodora', 'Ozcome', 'hill', 'encounter', 'Emerald', 'City', 'first', 'time', 'movie.The', 'music', 'not', 'rise', 'occasion', 'opinion', 'not', 'awesome', 'momentit', 'could', 'have', 'been.So', 'give', 'excellent', 'DISNEY', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'top-drawer', 'had', 'thescript', 'been', 'more', 'carefully', 'worked', 'out']",N/A

1642452,A2JEDX851ET4Y8,B00C5W3SBE,"Pumpkin Toss ""Dearest""","[3, 3]","First of all the acting stunk to high heaven, and the costumes were ridiculous. However, there was a lot of potential concerning the story. Disney had combined the MGM 1939 movie version, the original story, and their own twist to this updated OZ film. In the original story (WHAT I remember) Dorothy and her friends came across a town made of porcellin/china. One china lady was worried about Dorothy and her friends causing her to fall/crack. In this movie version Disney had added the china town into the story.Also, in the 1939 OZ movie, and in the original story book, the man known as Oz was in fact a sneaky manipulative person, and his personality remained the same in this updated film. For example, in the original story Oz forced people to wear green colored glass before entering the emerald city...the glasses made the city look green.Disney also created sets/background that resembled the 1939 MGM oz movie. Watch the original movie, and this remake...pay close attention during the Oz chamber scenes, the haunted forest, and the costumes on the munchkins. You can tell that Disney spoofed/paid tribute to the original film's style/flavor.Even the wicked witch's costume(in this movie version) resembled one of the earlier costume designs in the 1939 oz movie. Originally, MGM was going to make the wicked witch sexy(MGM originally planned to mimic ""Snow White's"" Wicked Queen's attire) and they had created a tight fitting black dress, hat, and hood that looks very similar to the witch in this movie version. Also, how the witch couldn't touch water was from the original story, MGM's movie version, and it was in this movie version as well (when the witch cried the tears dissolved parts of her face).The blending of the original story, MGM's movie version, and Disney's story telling for their OZ movie really paid off well.

It is WAY to expensive for a new release, totally ridiculous. 3D and 2D releases separate too, unlike the others releasing 2d 3d and digital download together at a less price then one version. Recommendation? Do not buy...force Disney and other money grabbers that we have a choice.  This reminds me of the early days, when they released movies, charged $79 for them , tried to make your rent them. Then they lost their shirts. So here we go again...EDIT:Well now it's almost half of what it was when issued. As people know, the review should be the WHOLE product. Example? Review of movie of course. But not just that! How is the transfer? How is the sound? Amount of special features, packaging (of disc), on and on.When originally released, Disney was way out of line with its price and packaging. Now, the price is down to $19.99. Still, I prefer the ""Blue Ray-DVD-Download"" packages. I did see the movie, and liked it. (Mila Kunis on the screen is stunning).  I did like the story, and special affects, and such. The kids seem to like it as well, but not overly so. I did buy this (at the current price) and this is a good movie.

And while this is a pretty sincere attempt to pay homage to the original movie and borrow from the books, it seems too predictable. The performances of the witches are powerful and pretty great. James Franco, as Oz, has to work his way into the role as does Oz as the savior of Oz.The movie is heavy with cgi which is great because the world of Oz is brought to life, but it's also sad because the original movie didn't rely so heavily on special effects. And the familiar Disney sidekick is used throughout the movie which can get annoying since it's a tried and true method to introduce comic relief for the company's movies as well as allow the main character to voice his/her thoughts. Here the sidekick is actually more interesting than Oz at times although he isn't as annoying or cloying like Jar Jar Binks.The movie is a nice intro to a series of movies on the world of Oz and the various fantastical creatures there, but is that the intent here?

1642484,A1UVGM5K7ZMXSN,B00C5W3SBE,R.K.,"[0, 1]","When I first heard about ""Oz The Great And Powerful"", I was admittedly not that enthused about it. However, as the release date for the film drew closer I was persuaded to go and check it out.Admittedly, this is a darker Oz than perhaps what we are used to from our childhoods and the ""Wizard of Oz"" film/books and more in tone with ""Return To Oz"" and the ""Wicked"" series of books. While not a bad story overall the darker or more serious aesthetic may turn off a lot of people looking for a lighter film. That is not to say that this film is not suitable for children, while there are a few scenes that may frighten **Spoiler Alert** (*Most Notably, Theodora transforming into The Wicked Witch of the West)** it is perhaps not as ""disturbing"" for lack of a better word as some of the events/themes touched upon in the Harry Potter series.The acting in the film runs the gamut from spectacular to lackluster, with no one really being horrible in their respective roles, they just lack panache or the ability to convey their characters as well as they could have been. But I will touch more on that later on in my opinion on this film.The film opens in Kansas, circa 1905 with Oscar Diggs, known as Oz to his friends. Is performing in the Baum Brothers Traveling Circus as a magician. He does the normal run of the mill magic acts one would expect to come with a traveling circus or carnival magician. But he feels that his talents are wasted, or that he could achieve a great deal more if only afforded the opportunity, stating himself that he wishes he could be like Thomas Edison. We meet a woman from Oscar's past, Annie, someone with whom he was either friends or romantically involved we are not told. However we do learn and it is implied that Oscar has not been keeping his heart to himself as he has been leading several woman along with a cache of cheap music boxes, and a story about a deceased grandmother. (This ultimately being what gets him into trouble.) Oscar flees the circus upon a liaison with another performer's wife/girlfriend comes to light and he must make good an exit. Hopping aboard a hot air balloon the circus uses for advertising/controlled ascents he lifts off and away from his captors only to be dragged into the Land of Oz by an oncoming cyclone.Oscar lands in Oz, where he meets three witches: Evanora ""The Good Witch of the East"", Theodora ""The Good Witch of the West"" and lastly, Glinda ""The Good Witch of the South"" and daughter of Oz's former King. I'd go into further detail about the plot, but I feel that would ruin the story.I do think that this is a movie people should see, however, as far as owning goes...that is a more complicated matter. I saw this movie in theaters and at that point, I had resolved that when it came out I would purchase it. After purchasing it, I believe that it is a movie, that at least in my collection will only be viewed occasionally, not b/c I feel it is a bad film, I just feel that it is a film that I will not be drawn to watching multiple times in quick succession. So you may want to purchase it, if you feel that you're getting it for a reasonable price, or you may want to wait til it becomes available on Netflix etc and watch it then.Now, back to what I said earlier in regards to the acting. There are people in this film that I think are acted well, Theodora, Evanora and Glinda I think are all portrayed very well and the actresses bring each of their characters a weight to them. Other characters, like Finley who serve as comic relief as also portrayed well as is the China Doll. However if I had to list any singular complaint as far as the acting went, I would have to place that with James Franco as Oz. It just seems that he can neither do the ""Oz the con man"" or ""Oz the sympathetic"" character very well. He sort of waxes and wanes and in my opinion at least really only comes into his own towards the end of the movie.Overall, a movie definitely worth seeing with some good acting, decent story, good visual effects and very well done soundtrack. As far as owning goes, if you like it after seeing it and can get it for a reasonable price, the certainly b/c I think you can do far worse than ""Oz the Great and Powerful"".

Cobbs.Walt Disney once again takes a crack at the Oz franchise and once again comes up short.It has a weak and meandering plot and an even weaker leading man.The story finds our wizard as a side show entertainer in a circus,who longs to be more than he is.He is a magician whose bag of tricks are getting very old,very fast.He is good with the ladies but does not want to be pinned down by any one in particular,even one who would like to marry him.One day the circus strongman comes after him and he hops aboard the circus balloon to save himself.However this results in his balloon getting sucked into a passing tornado.When he lands on the other side he is in the land of Oz.The first person he is greeted by is a good witch named Theadora.The two hit it off,as the wizard turns on the charm,and the two end up practically engaged;at least in Theadora's mind.When they reach the Emerald City,Theodora's sister Evanora is there waiting their arrival.His presence has alerted the entire kingdom and the prophecy of the returning wizard,they think,is apparently being fulfilled.Evanora tells him the kingdom is his to rule when he destroys the wicked witch who resides in the dark forest.The wizard leaves for the dark forest with a flying monkey called Finlay he met on the way to Oz,and along the way he picks up another traveling companion,a cute little china doll.When they reach their destination they find their quarry and plan to just steal her wand and break it.Their plans go awry and they come face to face with her.As it turns out it is Glinda,the good witch of the south.Evanora has tricked both the wizard and her own sister Theodora.Evannora,to retain an ally,shows her sister the goings on with Glinda through her crystal ball.It makes Theodora enraged.She gets so mad she takes a bite of an apple Evanora gives her,which turns her into a hideous green skinned evil witch.The wizard meanwhile has been introduced to a  variety of Oz inhabitants by Glinda,including Quadlings,Tinkerers and Munchkins.The wizard and Glinda concoct a plan to attack the Emerald City.The first attack is by robotic scarecrows through the poppy field.Glinda lays a low""fog""over the poppies to hide them and as the flying monkeys descend down to field level,they almost all fall asleep.However two grab and whisk away Glinda.The wizard now has to hatche a further plan to get Glinda back.He has a balloon float seemingly away from the city with the him aboard.The balloon is destroyed by Theodora,and the bait is taken.The wizard reappears courtesy of a holographic like projector with smoke,which he uses to intimidate the two witches.Theordora flies off on her broom,while Evanora flees into her castle.There she and Glinda have it out and Glinda defeats her,but Evanora is taken away by two flying monkeys.The film comes to its conclusion as the wizard presents his friends with gifts for their support and he takes Glinda behind his curtain for a romantic kiss.The leading character in a film like this, would have to have been played by someone with good acting skills,and with charisma and panache,as that is who this movie revolves around when all is said and done.Franco was terribly miscast.His acting is weak and he looks terribly uncomfortable in his role.This undermined,for me,the entire movie,despite all the good special effects this movie spewed forth.Any moment of pathos,drama or comedy were severally weakened by his inability to ""bring it"".He couldn't even come up to the level of his fellow players,and as a result dragged many of them down with him.As with many a Sam""Evil Dead""Raimi film,the director once again cast his old friend Bruce Campbell in a small supporting role.He is the guard at the gates of the Emerald City who gets hit on the head by Finlay(Mr.Campbell I'm sure could make much out of that!).I bring Bruce's appearance up for one reason:THAT is who should have been cast in the lead role.Bruce Campbell could have given that character exactly what the role called for;a depth and humour Franco couldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.This film is kind of a prequel to the Oz books themselves,but it does mention characters like Quadlings,Winkies,and others that appear in the original books but have never been mentioned on film before.The film also has the odd salute to the /39 film.Watch as the wizard leaves the Emerald City.In the background in a field,is the""horse of a different colour"".The best part of the film,I found,was the china doll character;CGI created at that.Technically speaking the film starts out in black and white,in a square box,center screen.Then when the wizard reaches Oz,the screen expands to a 2:40:1 a/r and colour.The picture was clear and crisp.As with many Disney one disc DVDs,there are no extras.All in all with a weak plot and an even weaker leading man,this film was doomed to fail.I couldn't get behind or believe Franco's role for one second.The special effects are good but it is not enough to make up for its other shortcomings.Barely three stars.",3,A Great and Powerful......disappointment!,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,5151,"['Great', 'Powerful', 'released',

Frank Baum novels that inspired it.The movie, with screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire and direction by Sam Raimi, tells us what happened long before young Dorothy Gale from Kansas skipped along the Yellow Brick Road with her three companions - the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion - and her little dog Toto in tow. It shows how a second-rate carnival magician - a self-described con man and humbug - is carried away by a tornado from a black-and-white, turn-of-the-20th Century Kansas (a clear homage to the original film) to a magical, multi-colored land that just happens to bear his name, Oz (short for Oscar). There he encounters an assortment of strange, funny-looking people and creatures, along with three witches, one of whom, Glinda (Michelle Williams), is good, while the other two, sisters in fact (Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz), are evil. Oz also learns that the inhabitants of the land have been faithfully awaiting the arrival of a messianic ""wizard,"" whom it is prophesied, will free them all from bondage to the wicked witches. The movie not only shows how the wizard ultimately becomes the wizard but how the Wicked Witch of the West ultimately becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.In many ways, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is really just a rehash of the original story, only with the magician in the role of Dorothy this time around. And while the movie could definitely use some trimming from its overlong 130-minute running time, it's worth seeing for its dazzling re-creation of the land of Oz alone. Its visual schema remains faithful to the original, matching the colors, costumes and art direction almost to perfection, and it is, of course, enhanced by all the marvels that modern CGI technology can provide. And as with the original, this new ""Oz"" has some of the actors doing double duty, appearing in both the black-and-white and color sequences in the film, and it nicely re-creates a number of key scenes from ""The Wizard of Oz."" In fact, the best thing to be said for this version is that its makers clearly revere the original as much as the rest of us do and they are careful not to violate either its look or its spirit.In the final analysis, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" clearly lacks the emotional resonance, brilliant characterizations, great score, and enduring themes of the original (that would be a pretty tall order for any filmmakers to fulfill), but Franco makes such a disarming wizard and the whole thing looks just so darn spectacular that you may not mind so much that it doesn't achieve the impossible.",3,Enjoyable if you properly gauge your expectations,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,2855,"['***1/2If', 'just', 'accept', 'given', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'recreate', 'magic', 'beloved', 'classic', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'then', 'can', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'lavish', 'visually', 'dazzling', 'prequel', '1939', 'movie', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'novels', 'inspired', 'it.The', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'Mitchell', 'Kapner', 'David', 'Lindsay-Abaire', 'direction', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'happened', 'long', 'before', 'young', 'Dorothy', 'Gale', 'Kansas', 'skipped', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'three', 'companions', 'Scarecrow', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Cowardly', 'Lion', 'little', 'dog', 'Toto', 'tow', 'how', 'second-rate', 'carnival', 'magician', 'self-described', 'con', 'man', 'humbug', 'carried', 'away', 'tornado', 'black-and-white', 'turn-of-the-20th', 'Century', 'Kansas', 'clear', 'homage', 'original', 'film', 'magical', 'multi-colored', 'land', 'just', 'bear', 'name', 'Oz', 'short', 'Oscar', 'assortment', 'strange', 'funny-looking', 'people', 'creatures', 'three', 'witches', 'one', 'whom', 'Glinda', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'good', 'other', 'two', 'sisters', 'fact', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'are', 'evil', 'Oz', 'also', 'inhabitants', 'land', 'have', 'been', 'faithfully', 'awaiting', 'arrival', 'messianic', 'wizard', 'whom', 'prophesied', 'will', 'free', 'bondage', 'wicked', 'witches', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'wizard', 'ultimately', 'wizard', 'how', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'ultimately', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'really', 'just', 'rehash', 'original', 'story', 'only', 'magician', 'role', 'Dorothy', 'time', 'around', 'movie', 'could', 'definitely', 'use', 'trimming', 'overlong', '130-minute', 'running', 'time', 'worth', 'seeing', 'dazzling', 're-creation', 'land', 'Oz', 'alone', 'visual', 'schema', 'faithful', 'original', 'matching', 'colors', 'costumes', 'art', 'direction', 'almost', 'perfection', 'course', 'enhanced', 'marvels', 'modern', 'CGI', 'technology', 'can', 'provide', 'original', 'new', 'Oz', 'actors', 'doing', 'double', 'duty', 'appearing', 'black-and-white', 'color', 'sequences', 'film', 'nicely', 'number', 'key', 'scenes', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'fact', 'best', 'thing', 'be', 'said', 'version', 'makers', 'clearly', 'revere', 'original', 'as', 'much', 'rest', 'do', 'are', 'careful', 'not', 'violate', 'look', 'spirit.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'clearly', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'brilliant', 'characterizations', 'great', 'score', 'enduring', 'themes', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'tall', 'order', 'filmmakers', 'fulfill', 'Franco', 'disarming', 'wizard', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'spectacular', 'may', 'not', 'mind', 'so', 'much', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'impossible']",N/A

Then there are those who are comparing it to the classic 1939 movie ""The Wizard of Oz"", sure to be on everyone's favorite list who watched it, growing up in the 60's and 70's. Fine. But this is a modern take on the Oz legend, different to be sure, but if judged solely on it's own merits is a worthy blockbuster of an Oz movie.Some are quibbling about the casting and the name of Robert Downey Jr., who was being courted for the role of Wizard, comes up. But really this is James Franco's moment to shine...after all, he wanted to do the movie. Downey did not. The rest of the cast fill their roles admirably. Mila Kunis is given the unenviable task of recreating the role made famous by Margaret Hamilton...but while there is a certain homage to that characterization, Kunis is also branching out into uncharted territory. It may take a few viewings to get used to, but clearly she is having fun and so will anyone with an open mind.The look of this movie is really like no other movie in recent times. They really could have remade the '39 classic with the careful approach to detail on display here. Kids will get a real jolt out of the story, action, and pyrotechnics.

It is clearly a prequel and it pays homage to the version we all know and love.  It starts in black and white and like we expect it transitions to color.  Oscar the cheap magician is transported by tornado to Oz where he is hailed OZ, the Wizard Extraordinaire.  To critics this seems to lack originality but to me it was logical and anything else wouldn't have seemed real.  I loved the characters, Finley the flying monkey was a nice addition and lent continuity to the flying monkeys of the wicked witch we all know.  The Munchkins are there -- a bit part -- but once again expected.  The three witches were very well done and explain how they became ugly and evil.  Glinda -- aka -- Wanda to the Wizard -- is also well done as she helps the Wizard fight the forces of evil.  The very best part is the final battle where Oscar the charlatan and cheap magician is transformed into OZ, THE GREAT AND POWERFUL.  It truly connects this film to the original that we all know and love.  This is not an academy award film on any level but I don't it was ever intended to be anything but a fun film. If you are looking for anything dramatic and original this probably isn't a film for you, but if you want some fun entertainment then try this film.  As I said maybe it appealed to my inner child but I liked it, my kids liked it, and more importantly my grandchildren liked it.

1642509,A2B3VV5Y4FHHBL,B00C5W3SBE,Russell W. Sanders,"[0, 0]","I'm uncertain why this film is getting so many negative reviews.  I found it to be an extremely well-done prequel that blended the classic film with modern visual effects and contemporary pacing.  I watched Great and Powerful back-to-back with &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; and &#34;Return to Oz&#34; and it honestly came off as the strongest of the three from my 2014 perspective.  That's a skewed viewpoint as the three cross copyright issues and decades and are all very different in their presentation but it does illustrate that Great and Powerful is a very solid film in its own right.The 3D effects are top-notch with all the tracking and masking done right.  The shortfalls you see in a film like John Carter are gone.  Everything works and it works well.  The film also does its own tribute to the classic's presentation, not only shifting from black and white to color but also from 1930s movie screen standard to widescreen as we enter the magical land of Oz.  The visuals are well-thought out and tailored to match the matte painting look of the classic film.Oz and Glenda are both remarkable.  Glenda is a grand portrayal of the character in the books and light-years ahead of the good witch we've seen before.  Oz is as good as the character in the classic film.Like the classic, this tale also seems to be a dream as it directly connects to the &#34;real-life&#34; opening scenes.  What's lost here is that the China doll is the girl from the wheel chair.  That's unfortunate as one of the films great sub-plots is lost if you miss this point.  I only detected it through the credits at the end of the film.The flying monkey is superb!  I can't imagine anyone not liking him.The fall of the Wicked Witch of the West is the only uncertain part of the film.  Her backstory radically changes her character and makes her fairly sympathetic.  Its hard to completely hate her watching the classic knowing that she is also a victim.  Its hard not to view Oz in a somewhat negative light knowing his role in her demise.  I found this acceptable as the Oz character here is closer to the Frank Baum character than the one in the classic film.  Their interaction does give all the characters a lot more dimension.In truth, there needs to be at least two more films to take us from Great and Powerful to the classic.

The story was well structured and retained the elements of the &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; movie, while creating a believable Oz character, con man, conniver, carnival hustler.

The story before the tornado was, of course, printed in gray scale (i.e. previously called, black and white) like the original movie, switching to full color at the appropriate time. The flying monkeys, the marching witch's guards, all continued with costumes and grunts like in the 1937 movie.

1642525,AJZAJ7S963ZS6,B00C5W3SBE,"Sauromon ""sauroman5""","[1, 1]","Nothing but nothing can EVER get close to the original Wizard of OZ... Not only did it set its standards  for its time and effects , acting, story and every thing you could think of but it only fell short to only one other considered the greatest of all time from a  story written by Margaret Mitchell. How could these two legendary movies ever compete. it was simply impossible and the likes will never happen again and still to this day they are two of the most cherished movies in history and will be for countless generations to come.. One for a heartbreaking kiss & walking out the door in the fog and rain & one for both children and adults alike to prove there is no limits to the imagination and incredible story telling taking viewers over the rainbow...... Which brings up to the age where  a studio would even dare to take on and  try to make a prequel to one of most beloved stories of all time... So now here is the OZ Great and powerful... does it is completely hit the mark...no.. but could any attempt really accomplish that?? yes there were parts what were a bit cheesy. But the Land of OZ is so very complicated on many different levels. First there was the story of the sisters in Oz and A con man who really tried to save the day. There was a really nice story line and the morals behind it truly could be felt. Oz did try to do well by Masterpiece but it did fall a bit short. The premise was certainly intriguing and certain things were incredibly sad on how things in OZ came to be...The story did try to send out a great message to all.. that acting was decent... the effects were over way done yet beautiful to behold... Yes this is a takeoff on Wicked and its gives a decent background in the land of OZ and how the ""true"" wicked witch came to be.. but will never ever be surpassed by the legendary performance of Margaret Hamilton. OZ was way over computerized with effects but it did try = way to hard. Did it have the best story line ..no.. but when you watch this film you cant help but smile in certain areas of this film. It tried to hard. But then again how in the hell can some one even try to top a movie in 1931 that set the standard for almost every movie that followed. OZ is a fun movie as times, and surprising on how the wicked became wicked but really didn't go far enough to justify how that all came about.. maybe this should have been broken up in to two movies because there is so much wealth of material and stories to tell and what was left out or didn't tie in to the classic...Oz tried do do right by the original but it tried way to hard and yet still didn't have enough time to tell the whole story. For fans of the story OZ will disappoint and excite at the same time... what could have been and should of. But in no means is this truly a bad film. It falls in the middle. Any one who loved the Wizard of OZ should see this. Will if fill all their expectations and tie everything in ...NO.. but the story as it tried to tell in a single movie is a decent tribute and an intriguing prequel to a masterpiece that was written and made in to a legendary, standard setting film before most of us were even born...  OZ is Worth renting or owning, there are some fine tributes and story lines to try to tie it in but in no way does it touch the classic. Yes  get the original for it is timeless. and deserves to be in every household for it touches the young old  a like and will never stop bringing viewers somewhere over the rainbow. OZ the great and powerful is a hit and miss at the same time but certainly deserves a viewing to those who wonder  and love the original and gives a tantalizing back drop of the land called OZ but could have been so much more.",3,For Fans of OZ ..it is a really  fun romp throught OZ  but now where near the original.....,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,3708,"['Nothing', 'nothing', 'can', 'EVER', 'get', 'close', 'original', 'Wizard', 'OZ', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'set', 'standards', 'time', 'effects', 'acting', 'story', 'thing', 'could', 'think', 'only', 'fell', 'short', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'considered', 'greatest', 'time', 'story', 'written', 'Margaret', 'Mitchell', 'How', 'could', 'two', 'legendary', 'movies', 'ever', 'compete', 'was', 'simply', 'impossible', 'likes', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'again', 'still', 'day', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'cherished', 'movies', 'history', 'will', 'be', 'countless', 'generations', 'come..', 'One', 'heartbreaking', 'kiss', 'walking', 'out', 'door', 'fog', 'rain', 'one', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'prove', 'limits', 'imagination', 'incredible', 'story', 'telling', 'taking', 'viewers', 'rainbow', 'up', 'age', 'where', 'studio', 'would', 'even', 'dare', 'take', 'try', 'make', 'prequel', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'stories', 'time', 'So', 'now', 'here', 'OZ', 'Great', 'powerful', 'completely', 'hit', 'mark', 'no..', 'could', 'attempt', 'really', 'accomplish', 'yes', 'were', 'parts', 'what', 'were', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'Land', 'OZ', 'so', 'very', 'complicated', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'First', 'was', 'story', 'sisters', 'Oz', 'A', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'tried', 'save', 'day', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'story', 'line', 'morals', 'truly', 'could', 'be', 'felt', 'Oz', 'did', 'try', 'do', 'well', 'Masterpiece', 'did', 'fall', 'bit', 'short', 'premise', 'was', 'certainly', 'intriguing', 'certain', 'things', 'were', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'how', 'things', 'OZ', 'came', 'be', 'story', 'did', 'try', 'send', 'out', 'great', 'message', 'all..', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'effects', 'were', 'way', 'done', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'behold', 'Yes', 'takeoff', 'Wicked', 'decent', 'background', 'land', 'OZ', 'how', 'true', 'wicked', 'witch', 'came', 'be..', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'surpassed', 'legendary', 'performance', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'OZ', 'was', 'way', 'computerized', 'effects', 'did', 'try', '=', 'way', 'hard', 'Did', 'have', 'best', 'story', 'line', '..no..', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'cant', 'help', 'smile', 'certain', 'areas', 'film', 'tried', 'hard', 'then', 'again', 'how', 'hell', 'can', 'one', 'even', 'try', 'top', 'movie', '1931', 'set', 'standard', 'almost', 'movie', 'followed', 'OZ', 'fun', 'movie', 'times', 'surprising', 'how', 'wicked', 'became', 'wicked', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'justify', 'how', 'came', 'about..', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'broken', 'up', 'two', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'wealth', 'material', 'stories', 'tell', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'tie', 'classic', 'Oz', 'tried', 'do', 'do', 'right', 'original', 'tried', 'way', 'hard', 'yet', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'fans', 'story', 'OZ', 'will', 'disappoint', 'excite', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'should', 'means', 'truly', 'bad', 'film', 'middle', 'one', 'who', 'loved', 'Wizard', 'OZ', 'should', 'see', 'Will', 'fill', 'expectations', 'tie', 'everything', 'NO..', 'story', 'tried', 'tell', 'single', 'movie', 'decent', 'tribute', 'intriguing', 'prequel', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'written', 'made', 'legendary', 'standard', 'setting', 'film', 'most', 'were', 'even', 'born', 'OZ', 'Worth', 'renting', 'owning', 'are', 'fine', 'tributes', 'story', 'lines', 'try', 'tie', 'way', 'touch', 'classic', 'Yes', 'get', 'original', 'timeless', 'be', 'household', 'young', 'old', 'like', 'will', 'never', 'stop', 'bringing', 'viewers', 'somewhere', 'rainbow', 'great', 'powerful', 'hit', 'miss', 'same', 'time', 'certainly', 'viewing', 'who', 'wonder', 'love', 'original', 'tantalizing', 'back', 'drop', 'land', 'called', 'OZ', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more']",N/A

1642538,A3F67YZNFDY6YI,B00C5W3SBE,SFA,"[0, 0]","This is a review intended for fans of the Oz books. There are plenty of reviews for everyone else but I can't find any geared towards book fans.First of all, I do like this movie and bought it. I've seen it multiple times and think the effects are wonderful, especially with China Girl. Though I'm complaining a lot, that comes from the Oz fan boy in me and as you see I gave the movie four stars. (Since it's a good film, just not a great one.)Is it worth watching? I'd say yes.Is it everything an Oz fan could want? Hardly.It's obvious from the start that the director and the others involved do NOT know Oz, and even if they did read a few Oz books here and there, they certainly didn't let the magic from Baum's stories carry over. In fact, I believe Sam Raimi said he didn't read the books until he was finished with the movie.James Franco claims to have read the books since he was a kid, and maybe he did, he did a pretty good job and I can see his version of Oz growing up into the Oscar Diggs in the books.The others not so much.Glinda fell flat, though her actress did a good job with what was given her and though I think the Wicked Witches did a fine job at acting, I can't imagine the Wicked Witch of the West becoming the book's witch.And that's the main problem with this new franchise Disney is working at.They are leaning so heavily on the imagery and characters from the MGM musical I think they are seriously handicapping themselves for future Oz movies (which were pretty much confirmed).As anyone who's read the books knows, the Wicked Witch of the West is not all that important, she's never described as green, doesn't seem able to fly and actually just seems like a very mean spirited old woman with some dirty magic tricks.The one portrayed in Disney's film is supposed to be a younger version of Margaret Hamilton's witch, no question about it! She flies on a broomstick that leaves a trail behind her, has green skin, a black witchy costume and that cackle. I was so expecting her to do sky writing that I was surprised she didn't!You see, WB holds the copyright to most of those things when it comes to Oz, as well as the famous Ruby Slippers, so Disney had to tread carefully...though they came close.Giant Winkies? Check. Mini Munchkins? Check. Poppies growing right outside EC? Check. Horse of a different color and Glinda bubbles? check and check.You see, those were all things not in the books and only seen in the MGM musical, which is why I believe Disney is ruining any further movies since they can't keep going this way and still claim it's original.What was like the books:As for fans of the books, there are a few nods to us included,1. There is a map drawn by Professor Wogglebug (would he have even been alive during this time?) that shows Oz is divided into four countries like in the books...though they put the Munchkin's in the west and the Winkies in the East (explicitly shown on the compass rose).This caused some major issues.(Mainly the fact that when Dorothy arrives she lands on the Witch of the East...who in Disney's version will be living in the West and the WWW will be living in the East...)2. The Wizard's full name is given as Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, like in the books,3. Glinda is FINALLY stated to be the Witch of the South, just as she is in the books, and she is referred to as Glinda the Good.4. There is the Dainty China Country, here called the China Town. (Though it's in the Munchkin Country instead of the Quadling Country.)5. There were people called the Tinkers, which I suppose were a nod to Mr. Tinker.6. If you look really closely you can see Baum's face on the coins in Emerald City and the circus the Wizard works at is &#34;Baum Bros.&#34;7. There are green tinted glasses shown near the end.What was not like the books at all:1.There is no reference made to Ozma or Mombi, or the Good Witch of the North, all of whom should be present I believe in this time line.2.Instead, Glinda is the King of Oz's daughter. His name is not given as Pastoria and he was a Wizard.3.Instead of being from Nebraska the Wizard is said to be a Kansas Man.4.There is no color theme for each country present...While much of the movie is spent with Glinda in the Quadling Country everything seems more yellow and pastel shades than red (though the flowers seem predominantly red there)5. The movie takes place in 1905...which is strange since the Wizard of Oz was written in 1899 and published a year later. By the time Dorothy arrived in Oz the Wizard had grown very old.I guess that's another attempt to link it with MGM's movie.6. Glinda is blonde...why was that even necessary?What was obviously borrowed from the famous MGM movie:1.Singing, very short Munchkins.2.Evil red powder (like in the hour glass)3.Horses of a Different Color4.Glinda travels by bubble and acts a bit ditzy (probably in reference to Wicked's Galinda)5.The strange costumes based on the MGM movie worn by the Munchkins and even the Quadlings.6.Glinda seems to have a double in Kansas and China Girl and Finley are obvious references to people from Kansas too.Other problems not reconcilable with either the books or the movie are there too. The poppy field is shown to be on the eastern side of the Emerald City, which would be fine if the Munchkins were in the East as they are in the books and the MGM movie. (They are so close to the city I wonder how they are not considered a hazard.)Dorothy arrives from the eastern side in both versions, though the poppies are no where near the Emerald City in the book.I enjoyed the movie, but it really slows down about half way in and it gets really boring before picking back up to a grand conclusion that I did have fun watching!I honestly hope Disney makes more sequels as has been confirmed by the actresses, but I really hope they find their own identity and give us the real Oz fans of the books have been longing for.I don't mind a twist and some Disney originality, but they need to stop being copycats.

Hollywood should know by now to just leave Frank L. Baum's other work alone. Nothing will ever touch the classic that Wizard of Oz is or partner up to it, so just stop trying. If anything, someone should make Gregory Maguire's Wicked into a movie already.They should have also known better because of Warner Bros. tight hold on the 1939 classic which prevented this movie from using certain elements and characters. They had to make the wicked witch's green skin a different shade and could not give her the trademark wart on the chin. That's too bad because a certain house falling from the sky into munchkin land would have made a nice ending and lead into the ""sequel.""I wanted to like this movie. I really did. After all, it is Disney. And like everyone else who flocked to see it, I've been a lifelong fan of the Judy Garland classic. I just could not admire James Franco as the wizard no matter how much I tried, but I haven't really enjoyed him in anything since Spiderman. The box office would have loved Johnny Depp in the roll, but I would have preferred someone like Lee Pace.Another problem is identity. The younger generation probably won't know right away who the wicked witches are, not until Theodora turns green anyway. It would have also been nice to see who China Girl and Finley were from the wizard's previous life. Other than their voices, there is no obvious clue.There's also too much time spent building up to the climax where's there just isn't much going on.  The climax of the movie is well worth it, but I think part of that was because I knew it was almost over. If anything, the movie made me want to go back and read the classics of Baum. I haven't read them all, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who had this feeling. So any movie who can spark reading in us has some worth.I'm an adult though, so who cares what I think?!

Sure enough, Franco was, indeed, a bad casting choice for the lead role ... but, to me, even worse was Mila Kunis as Theodora/the Wicked Witch of the West.  Margaret Hamilton set a DAMNED high bar for the role, and Kunis never comes off as menacing/wicked enough.  Hell, even her slighter height, toward the end when Theodora is playing side-by-side with wicked sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz, who is wonderfully evil), completely diminishes the power of the character.That's the negative; the positive is the 'Oz the Great and Powerful' is freaking BEAUTIFUL to look at.  Director Sam Raimi has infused the film with all the color, majesty, and eye candy needed to pay homage to 'The Wizard of Oz' classic - and much as I hate to admit it, Michelle Williams (not perfect, but good), Zach Braff (even voicing the winged monkey Finley, Tony Cox (who can convey more sardonic wit with one look than many actors can do with dialogue), and the rest of the supporting cast make the movie enjoyable ... even fun.  Franco isn't THAT bad in the role, especially as Oz gains his footing and goes from con man/magician to realizing his destiny, but through the entire picture he just feels ... off.

Bad acting of a couple characters aside, the movie was quite watchable, and could have been a GREAT movie if more attention had been played to cast and detail.The movie looked kind of ""disjointed"".

The film starting in black and white is fine, but that little tiny square?  Come on now...that dragged on way too long and really, the black and white was not done properly at all.  It looked at if the color was just digitally removed and there were not really any plays on dark/light or good use of shadows.  Yeah, the clouds were black, but so what.  The rest was just abysmally gray monotone.  Then you get the color burst (and not too soon) and you're in Oz.Overall, the story is an interesting adaptation as to how the wizard got to Oz in the first place and how the wicked witch really got that evil.  That said, it reminded me a bit of Darth Vader in how he turned so dark....in that it was whining and crying about petty things and an overreaction that turned a rather mild event into a devastating turn to the overly dark.  Sure...there was a spell, but then one would think that (according to Disney rules) that love would break the spell....and then the Wiz made a lame attempt at reconciliation in that she was welcomed if she found the good....what...no kiss?

I'm sure you don't have time in your life to read them all and I'll try to make mine productive. As I remind those who read my reviews, it is often best to sort by date (choose ""most recent"") to separate a home video review from a theater version. And you can see which version of the home video the reviewer is referring to. This is of the BD/DVD combo pack.As for the film, I have to say I ""liked"" it but didn't love it. As you will learn from the best ""Bonus feature"" - ""Walt Disney and the Road to Oz"", a new 10-minute documentary- which DOES appear on the single DVD version as well as the Blu-ray, Disney wanted make a film music of the Oz books since the 1930s and even bought the rights to some of them. He was fascinated with the idea. (I won't tell you more - it would spoil the fun). The new folks at Disney went way too far with CGI effects for me and you can easily see the scenes they included for the 3D effect in that version.Like the Broadway musical ""Wicked"" - which I'll be seeing on stage next week for the third time! - OTG&P; is a prequel to the famous 1939 Judy Garland vehicle. And it drops hints of what is to come. And like most Disney films, the main character, Oz (James Franco) has an animal companion (a monkey this time) who cracks jokes. This is not a kids' picture per se though they will like the color and special effects. I think it's worth watching but it won't be a Disney ""Classic"".Now for the bonuses:The DVD has the aforementioned ""Walt Disney and..."" plus five minutes of bloopersThe BD has the above plus a 21 minute ""My Journey in Oz"" film which Franco filmed, directed and narrates. (It's more of a vanity project IMHO)There a 5 minute feature on the ""china Girl"", 11 minutes on design and effects, 7-minutes on makeup design, and 7 minutes about the music score from Danny Elfman.So, lots of bonuses for those who want the story behind the ""magic"" on the screen.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Review of Bluray/DVD Combo pack including details on ""Bonus features""",1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,2273,"['Boy', 'am', 'late', 'party', 'probably', 'know', 'Amazon', 'groups', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'film', 'together', 'DVD', 'Bluray', '3D', 'theater', 'version', 'So', 'even', 'home', 'video', 'version', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'June', '11th', 'are', 'already', '527', 'reviews', 'here', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'life', 'read', ""'ll"", 'try', 'make', 'mine', 'productive', 'remind', 'who', 'read', 'reviews', 'often', 'best', 'sort', 'date', 'choose', 'most', 'recent', 'separate', 'home', 'video', 'review', 'theater', 'version', 'can', 'see', 'version', 'home', 'video', 'reviewer', 'referring', 'BD/DVD', 'combo', 'pack.As', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'will', 'learn', 'best', 'Bonus', 'feature', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Road', 'Oz', 'new', '10-minute', 'documentary-', 'DOES', 'appear', 'single', 'DVD', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'Blu-ray', 'Disney', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'music', 'Oz', 'books', '1930s', 'even', 'bought', 'rights', 'was', 'fascinated', 'idea', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'new', 'folks', 'Disney', 'went', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'CGI', 'effects', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'scenes', 'included', '3D', 'effect', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Wicked', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seeing', 'stage', 'next', 'week', 'third', 'time', 'OTG', 'P', 'prequel', 'famous', '1939', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'vehicle', 'hints', 'what', 'come', 'most', 'Disney', 'films', 'main', 'character', 'Oz', 'James', 'Franco', 'animal', 'companion', 'monkey', 'time', 'who', 'jokes', 'not', 'kids', 'picture', 'se', 'will', 'like', 'color', 'special', 'effects', 'think', 'worth', 'watching', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Disney', 'Classic', '.Now', 'bonuses', 'DVD', 'aforementioned', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'five', 'minutes', 'bloopersThe', 'BD', 'above', '21', 'minute', 'Journey', 'Oz', 'film', 'Franco', 'filmed', 'directed', 'narrates', 'more', 'vanity', 'project', 'IMHO', '5', 'minute', 'feature', 'china', 'Girl', '11', 'minutes', 'design', 'effects', '7-minutes', 'makeup', 'design', '7', 'minutes', 'music', 'score', 'Danny', 'Elfman.So', 'lots', 'bonuses', 'who', 'want', 'story', 'magic', 'screen.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

Oz the Great and Powerful is an engaging, visually stunning, though sometimes head-scratching prequel to the Oz universe as we know it, back to the Wizard's start in Kansas and his rise to power within this magical world.The story and four leads (the Wizard and three Witches of Oz) are actually pretty well developed, with each character strengthened by their sometimes conflicting motivations and intentions. Traveling with James Franco as the Wizard, we enter a world where everybody has a past history with one another, and we are immediately given this sense. There is plenty of witchy competition and backstabbing, worsened by Franco's semi-romantic connections with, well, all of them.I think this is when the movie succeeds at its best, though. The Wizard of Oz we are familiar with is not a great guy, and he is consistently not very nice as a young man first entering Oz. Oz the Great and Powerful meets our expectations of the Oz universe with consistent imagery, particularly through the architecture of the Emerald City, the smoke-and-mirrors tricks of the Wizard, and, of course, the Wicked Witch of the West.The film does not work, however, with some of the supporting characters. While I am happy to say that everybody and every scene do serve some greater function to the story, some characters are frankly obnoxious or aren't written to their full potential. There is more than a handful of cringeworthy moments, and the awkward scene breaks don't help ease the uncomfortable parts.While wildly inconsistent, Oz the Great and Powerful is actually a very clever and, for the most part, a pretty solid movie. It rises above the disaster of Alice in Wonderland from a couple years ago, and tells a story that is at once familiar and surprising. It follows a story frame similar to The Wizard of Oz, while incorporating in powerful themes of the limitations of humanity and the sometimes disappointing reality that lies behind the curtain.",4,Uneven quality; great at times and lousy at others.

You are immediately assaulted with vibrant colors, clear images and characters you couldn't even begin to imagine.Loosely based on the original story of the Wizard of Oz, Oz ends up in the Land of Oz after being caught in a tornado. Only there is no Dorothy in this Oz! There are many familiar characters such as the good and bad witches and the people surrounding them. I loved the creative spin on this beloved story that made many things like the yellow brook road recognize able but with it's own twisted plotline.James Franco was flawless in his performance and convincing as the greedy magician whose true goodness is buried deep within and may or may not appear by the end of the movie. When he is called upon to save Oz, pride and greed stop from him declining but can he follow through with his promises?

The film has some early twists, which you may already know if you read any review, but it is nothing complicated.James Franco stars in the title role. He reminded me of Edward Norton in ""The Illusionist."" Oz is a phoney and a bit of a womanizer. His magic consists of flash powder, glue, and determination.The best was Mila Kunis. She owned Theodora. Clearly a People's Choice Award. Her performance alone was worth the price of admission. The movie meshes neatly into the film we all know and love. Rachel Weisz shined in her performance as well. The on screen chemistry between Franco and Michelle Williams could improve.The flying baboons are far more fierce and scary than the flying monkeys in the original.

1642618,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00C5W3SBE,The People's Critic,"[5, 10]","The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a triumph in entertainment longevity. Since L. Frank Baum's novel was published in 1900, the story has found relevance in the lives of generations of fans and has undergone countless reimaginings from page to stage to its most recent screen makeover, Sam Raimi's Oz the Great and Powerful.  Oz is Disney's second notable big budget update on a classic children's tale after 2010&#8242;s Alice in Wonderland, and the comparisons are numerous, which may or may not excite you.Like Alice, Oz is somewhat of a frame story where the first act takes place in the real world, and a set of circumstances launches the main character into a magical new world.  James Franco plays Oz, a traveling carnival illusionist with lofty goals but little ambition to put in the effort to reach them.  Franco does well as Oz.  His early scenes depicting Oz's sleazy ethics and immoral ways with women ring true of a young Woody Allen.  This neurotic zeal and ironic self-confidence is very entertaining and it is some of the film's best material.  However, Raimi does not waste his time getting Oz to...well, Oz.  Oz is transported to the Land of Oz by way of a fortuitous tornado, a way of transportation clearly not uncommon to early 20th century Kansas.The Land of Oz looks  great and there are some incredible details woven into its fabric, and with a visionary director like Sam Raimi, this is to be expected.  However, the film does lose some of its freshness upon its shift to Oz.  The film is actually at its best when it is developing Oz's character at the beginning.  Once the film actually moves to the Land of Oz, it gets a bit convoluted.  The Land of Oz is being terrorized by a wicked witch, and far too much time is wasted pretending that the audience doesn't know which of the film's three witches is the bad one.  Eventually Oz allies himself with Glinda (Michelle Williams) against Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz).  Weisz is especially effective and it is unfortunate that at some point down the line, we know a house is going to land on her.  To add to the already bloated storyline, Oz also befriends a flying monkey (Zach Braff) and an orphaned enchanted china doll (Joey King), both of whom refer to characters and events set up in the film's opening act. As the film goes on, it certainly begins to fizzle, but it is not without its charm and is incredibly respectful of the reputation Oz's legacy has established.A well-known film critic gave a favorable review to Oz the Great and Powerful partially because he said it, ""does not rest or fall back on formula.""  This is a movie that begins in a real-world setting (in black and white), magically transforms to brilliant color upon the main character landing in a fantasy world where he then meets three odd ""friends in need"" who all team up to defeat a wicked witch.  What part of this is not formulaic?  Additionally, what part of this is not 2010's Alice in Wonderland?  It's not that the film is a bad film, but let's be honest - we've seen this before.  What Oz has going for it is visual charm, a good story, and a feel-good tone; all of this working to create an effective movie experience.  Oz the Great and Powerful was released in both 3-D and IMAX and it is The People's Critic's recommendation that it be seen in 2-D, but in IMAX if possible.  The 3-D is not worth the surcharge since most of its effect is gimmick based, although the kids will get a kick out of the flying arrows or the water being spit at the screen.  IMAX screens, on the other hand, definitely enhance the fullness of the world that Raimi and everyone else ""behind the curtain"" created.

1642622,A238M34Z3X2IBD,B00C5W3SBE,Thomas E. O'Sullivan,"[12, 28]","OZ: THE GREAT AND POWERFUL is perhaps one of the most confused and hopelessly lost films I've seen in a while.I'm not sure who this movie was made for, or what brand of nostaliga they were aiming for, or what answer they were trying to provide about the origin of the Wizard of Oz - because it seems the film is more interested not in honoring or expanding the Baum books, but instead bent on insult.  The film is insulting to everyone and I mean literally everyone - first, it's insulting to men.  James Franco's OZ is right out of MAXIUM magazine model - he's unshaved in a scruffy way, conflicted about work, girls and money, he looks stoned the entire time and anything outside his direct line of sight is non-existant and yet he clearly has talent - all of which he wastes on trying to get women; and how does he do this? - he lies, he lies all the time (and he never stops, even when people know the truth).  This is a major theme in the movie - the conquest or corruption of women.  I never thought I would have to battle obvious gender and sexual politics in OZ, but it seems Rami is game for this battle.  Oz here is a rouge, but in all the worst ways - LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR (1977) worst ways if you've seen the film - he's sleezy, cheap and another man-child who thinks he will never grow old and never die.  His trip into OZ is at first to escape responsibility and, of course, ends up having to take responsibility and save OZ from...well, women.OZ is ruled by three woman - Glinda (Micehlle Williams), the true heir to the throne and two sisters, Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weissz); Oz first meets Theodora (in black leather pants) and their meeting is a confused, but quick mess of plot and peril that throws them together - of course Oz hits on her, lies and asks her to dance (dance = sex in this film, this is not something hidden, it's pretty much pointing right to it); being have been asked to dance before (ie: virgin) Theodora falls in love with Oz right there and then - oh, and there is a long standing prophecy about a man coming to OZ named Oz who will save OZ which Oz quickly lies about to get into Theodora's foxtrot - so, they go to the most boring Emerald City ever seen on the screen (it's like leftover code of from THE MATRIX; I fully expected Neo to come flying around the corner at any moment) and we meet Evanora who is pretty clearly evil - her take on Oz is the exact opposite of her sister's - so we have a love / hate triangle going on.  Her focus instead is on Glinda who is in exile after the death of her father who was in fact murdered by - well, guess and just take one guess and you'll be right.  Evenora says Glinda is evil, which we know is not true - but the movie goes to pains to make her first appearance on screen scream Voldemort to everyone in the back row; her power is wand based and without it Glinda is powerless...so, count on Glinda doing stupid things with her wand all the time - putting it down and walking away from it for one is the most stupid and least understood in the film (why does she do it before entering a graveyard - is there a rule I'm missing?); before Oz meets Glinda he has picked up a few friends - a flying bellhop monkey and a little girl made out of china.And, I have to admit - the China Girl scene is perhaps the single best moment of the film, it's a call back to the opening of the film and is surprising in both how touching it is, how complex it is and how devestating it is as well - it's here a grand, odd and disturbing theme is layered into the film about genocide - because clearly all of the girl's family, friends, entire world is destroyed by the Flying Monkeys  and nothing can bring them back (and nothing does); it's simply almost emotional overload so the film quickly does away with it until nearly the end - which manages to insult the moment even more.  Oz continues his lackluster journey until they finally meet Glinda who is pretty weak overall - she's not stupid, but, like the rest of the women in the film the undertow is that without a man around all women are lost.  Because until Oz arrives, these three women haven't been doing much but making snide remarks, throwing curses and plotting...that's it.  But now there is a man in the mix - well, the fur and sparks fly.  Evenora uses Oz against her sister by saying he's a letch (and he is, which makes it all the more true) and Theodora is so distraught she ends up turning into the Wicked Witch of the West - in short, a man rejects her and she chooses evil; she can't be independent, she can't go on the rebound, she can't get over him - no, because the story is locked into having a Wicked Witch we have to have her go man-crazy and lose her mind over the first guy she ever waltzed with...boring.What happens next is your typical rise to rebellion - and this is supposed to be about freedom, as all rebellions are...but the ending is anything but, which is very odd - more in a moment; so, Glinda and Oz form their plan and they raise the troops and Oz makes ready with his most amazing trick yet (after a long, loving speech about Thomas Edison and his many wonderful inventions...some of them that seem to have clearly crossed into Oz as well - such as the light bulb; please, count the lamps in the movie) and they all go off into battle and they win!; kind of...yes, sort of...sure...it's a win, let's just call it that.  Oz fakes his death and rises from the ashes a ghostly head and scares off the Wicked Witch while Glinda has to defeat Count Dooku and his Sith powers...I'm sorry, Evenora and her green lighting powers (Sith powers) in a useless, in your face, you paid extra for it so here it goes 3D battle between the women as they fight.  It's pointless and comes off the heels of public torture and more unwanted, dark images that don't fit in this movie.  At the end, the girls all get what's coming to them, being women they should have known better than to go up against any man and Oz installs a shadow government over OZ and rules the land with fear and magic - true story; their rebellion merely sets up a secret cabal that lies to their people now.There's more to this film than above and you will have to make your own judgments, but I do want to comment on something in the film that you can't help but notice as Rami pushes it in your face over and over and over again (I can image it is actually worse in 3D) and that's this - OZ is now integrated; racially, socially, culturally, the works - OZ is now fully colored not only with CGI but African-American's, Asians, etc; the film is so inclusive of all people that it actually comes across as racist and I say this because the parts handed to the African-American cast are so poorly fleshed out, written and 2D as to be token - that's it, I've said it - these parts were doled out like Pez to ward off backlash of an all-white cast and all white OZ and try to prove that the film is up to date and new...it's awful, it's cheap and it's clearly framed to express this.  I felt like I was watching less a movie about OZ but more an escape from the IT'S A SMALL WORLD RIDE at Disney.OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL fails on so many levels - it's simply an insult to everyone, even when it tries to do good, tries to make us connect with OZ, it's so disconnected that we never get the chance to be there - to truly, fully belong, even though it's a world now (there is an actual globe) maybe, just maybe too much like out ours.  Click your heels quick and come back home and save yourself the trip; like a lot of tourist traps - just say you went and no one will know the difference.",1,THE PAST IS ANOTHER COUNTRY,1364083200,"03

""Oz"", played smarmily by James Franco who puts his great smile to good effect) who runs away from his problems in Kansas that he's created for himself, has some nice and sweet echoes within the story itself as the brief time we spend with ""the great and powerful Oz"" in Kansas has important ramifications in the wonderland known as Oz.  It's pretty easy to match up the fantasy counterparts to their faux-real world memes within these two worlds.  And though the movie makes light of Franco's philandering ways on the one hand (everything works out in an overall PG way...for him at least who receives nary a scratch or ever shows that he feels bad about himself...which he should) it also shows on the other hand how deceit and the empty promise of love can mar and undo people.  This can certainly give something for the pre-teen and teen set something to talk about, or for parents with their children.The movie is gorgeous, sumptuous, and magical not just in the sense that there is magic in it (a la the witches played by fetching stars Mila Kunis, Rachel Wiesz, and Michelle Williams) but also in the sense that we can experience ""magic"" in different forms, from the stage magician deftly deceiving us to the conundrums of scientific principles that dazzle many of us to the sheer magic of being at the movies that we (hopefully) feel from time to time.  Perhaps not unlike the first ""Wizard of Oz"" and the effect it had on audiences, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" can too have the effect of making us feel like we're experiencing something new, real, otherwordly and yet terrific at the same time.  4.5 stars.",5,"Don't let the wicked witch(es) fool you.

Released through Walt Disney Pictures worldwide. Based on the original &#8220;Oz&#8221; series of fantasy novels written by Frank Baum.Storyline: Oscar Diggs (Oz) is a small time magician in a small circus entertaining people. One day he gets engulfed into a tornado that hits the circus and suddenly enters a mysterious beautiful land of fantasy land, the Oz. There he encounters two wicked witches Evanora and Theodora who rule the Emerald City, but trick Oz to believe a story that they are being threatened by another witch called Glinda, living in the dark forest. The entire township of Oz believe in a legend that a great wizard is going to arrive to save them from calamity and celebrate the arrival of Oz. Meanwhile Oz while encountering Glinda in her territory, discovers that the true wicked witch is Theodora and not Glinda. He falls in love with the beautiful Glinda and saves the people of Oz from the destruction of the other two wicked witches, through his intelligence of trick magic created through a projector and smoke device. Glinda ultimately gains the throne of Emarald City with the help of Oz, after banishing Theodora and Evanora permanently from the kingdom. Oz becomes a hero forever in that free kingdom.Positives: The best thing about this movie is its exquisite graphics and screenplay. The rich colors used in the astonishing landscapes created graphically, simply leaves the audience awestruck. One would have a feeling of visiting such lands of Oz at least once in their dreams. The Art Director, Robert Stromberg should be specially applauded for his design of the sets. Great cinematography and music. Mila Kunis was too beautiful to be called as a Witch. James Franco&#8217;s performance can be treated as one of his best. One can enjoy this movie in 3D with family on a weekend and worth having it as a collection in their library for its lovely ethnic graphics.Negatives: The movie somehow failed to take success path in countries other than United States due to lack of proper marketing. Many missed this beautiful movie in theatres thinking it to be a kids movie.My rating is 3.75 out of 5",4,Beautiful 3D experience filled with great graphics and art,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,2276,"['Directed', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Produced', 'Joe', 'Roth', 'starring', 'James', 'Franco', 'Oz', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'three', 'witches', 'Released', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Pictures', 'worldwide', 'Based', 'original', '8220', 'Oz', '8221', 'series', 'fantasy', 'novels', 'written', 'Frank', 'Baum.Storyline', 'Oscar', 'Diggs', 'Oz', 'small', 'time', 'magician', 'small', 'circus', 'entertaining', 'people', 'One', 'day', 'engulfed', 'tornado', 'circus', 'suddenly', 'mysterious', 'beautiful', 'land', 'fantasy', 'land', 'Oz', 'two', 'wicked', 'witches', 'Evanora', 'Theodora', 'who', 'rule', 'Emerald', 'City', 'trick', 'Oz', 'believe', 'story', 'are', 'being', 'threatened', 'witch', 'called', 'Glinda', 'living', 'dark', 'forest', 'entire', 'township', 'Oz', 'believe', 'legend', 'great', 'wizard', 'going', 'arrive', 'save', 'calamity', 'celebrate', 'arrival', 'Oz', 'Meanwhile', 'Oz', 'encountering', 'Glinda', 'territory', 'discovers', 'true', 'wicked', 'witch', 'Theodora', 'not', 'Glinda', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Glinda', 'people', 'Oz', 'destruction', 'other', 'two', 'wicked', 'witches', 'intelligence', 'trick', 'magic', 'created', 'projector', 'smoke', 'device', 'Glinda', 'ultimately', 'gains', 'throne', 'Emarald', 'City', 'help', 'Oz', 'banishing', 'Theodora', 'Evanora', 'permanently', 'kingdom', 'Oz', 'hero', 'forever', 'free', 'kingdom.Positives', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'exquisite', 'graphics', 'screenplay', 'rich', 'colors', 'used', 'astonishing', 'landscapes', 'created', 'graphically', 'simply', 'audience', 'awestruck', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'feeling', 'visiting', 'such', 'lands', 'Oz', 'least', 'once', 'dreams', 'Art', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Stromberg', 'should', 'be', 'specially', 'applauded', 'design', 'sets', 'Great', 'cinematography', 'music', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'was', 'too', 'beautiful', 'be', 'called', 'Witch', 'James', 'Franco', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'treated', 'one', 'best', 'One', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', '3D', 'family', 'weekend', 'worth', 'having', 'collection', 'library', 'lovely', 'ethnic', 'graphics.Negatives', 'movie', 'somehow', 'failed', 'take', 'success', 'path', 'countries', 'other', 'United', 'States', 'due', 'lack', 'proper', 'marketing', 'Many', 'missed', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'theatres', 'thinking', 'be', 'kids', 'movie.My', 'rating', '3.75', '5']",N/A

1642631,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00C5W3SBE,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","When I first heard that Disney was doing a prequel to the Wizard of Oz, I was kind of annoyed. Then I remembered that they did a pretty decent job making a sequel to it, 25 years earlier. My hopes got even higher when I heard that James Franco would star in it. To me, he was such an interesting choice to play the wizard. Franco is a very versatile actor, but he's known more for action and comedy, not family films, but he brings a very interesting dynamic to the movie. Much like the Wizard of Oz and Return To Oz, this film is taken directly from the original Oz stories of L. Frank Baum. Once again, instead of just adapting a book, the screen writers picked and chose from several stories to create this one, and if I may say so, they did a very good job. Of course there is a bunch of Disneyizing to it, as seen with the spunky china girl and the talking monkey, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Franco is terrific and really carries the story. He combines his charms and looks with goofiness and ingenuity to make his character come alive in a way that L. Frank Baum would have loved. He's paired with Mila Kunis who is also really good and used to playing unlikable characters...Shut up Meg! What I especially liked about this film is how they played off the original. Starting in black & white, in an old box format, before opening up to the tradition high def. widescreen view was ingenious. I also loved how people from the black & white story had roles in Oz, just like the original. What was strange though is that they made Oz out to be a real place and discounted the whole dream aspect of the stories. In all of Baum's writings it was never known for a certainty weather or not Oz was a real place. The fact of the matter is that nothing in this genre will ever be as good as the original Wizard of Oz, but The Great & Powerful answers a lot of questions, is taken directly from the writings of the original author, has a great cast, and really does an impressive job of connecting to a film that was made 75 years earlier.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,2054,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Disney', 'was', 'doing', 'prequel', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'was', 'kind', 'annoyed', 'Then', 'remembered', 'did', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'making', 'sequel', '25', 'years', 'earlier', 'hopes', 'got', 'even', 'higher', 'when', 'heard', 'James', 'Franco', 'would', 'star', 'was', 'such', 'interesting', 'choice', 'play', 'wizard', 'Franco', 'very', 'versatile', 'actor', 'known', 'more', 'action', 'comedy', 'not', 'family', 'films', 'very', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'movie', 'Much', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Return', 'Oz', 'film', 'taken', 'directly', 'original', 'Oz', 'stories', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'Once', 'again', 'instead', 'just', 'adapting', 'book', 'screen', 'writers', 'picked', 'chose', 'several', 'stories', 'create', 'one', 'may', 'say', 'so', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'course', 'bunch', 'Disneyizing', 'seen', 'spunky', 'china', 'girl', 'talking', 'monkey', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Franco', 'terrific', 'really', 'story', 'charms', 'goofiness', 'ingenuity', 'make', 'character', 'come', 'alive', 'way', 'L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'paired', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'who', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'used', 'playing', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'Shut', 'up', 'Meg', 'What', 'especially', 'liked', 'film', 'how', 'played', 'off', 'original', 'Starting', 'black', 'white', 'old', 'box', 'format', 'opening', 'up', 'tradition', 'high', 'def', 'widescreen', 'view', 'was', 'ingenious', 'also', 'loved', 'how', 'people', 'black', 'white', 'story', 'had', 'roles', 'Oz', 'just', 'original', 'What', 'was', 'strange', 'though', 'made', 'Oz', 'be', 'real', 'place', 'discounted', 'whole', 'dream', 'aspect', 'stories', 'Baum', 'writings', 'was', 'never', 'known', 'certainty', 'weather', 'not', 'Oz', 'was', 'real', 'place', 'fact', 'matter', 'nothing', 'genre', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'lot', 'questions', 'taken', 'directly', 'writings', 'original', 'author', 'great', 'cast', 'really', 'impressive', 'job', 'connecting', 'film', 'was', 'made', '75', 'years', 'earlier']",N/A

Director Raimi makes a valiant effort with Oz the Great and Powerful. The story of how the wizard originally journeyed to Oz and became an ally of good witch Glinda and an adversary of bad witch Theodora is fairly well done and the visual effects are delightful. But there's just no getting around James Franco's ham fisted performance. The rest of the cast does fine including my favorite character, the animated flying monkey, Finley. But let's face it, the characters and performances in the 1939 classic are heads and shoulders above what's offered in this film (with the exception of Michelle Williams' sweetly empathetic Glinda). Half-dollar-eyed Mila Kunis gives it her best shot as the green wicked witch but she doesn't stand a chance against Margaret Hamilton's iconic (and terrifying) performance. The very lovely Abigail Spencer has a small but enjoyable part. Franco is simply miscast. I've read that Robert Downey Jr. was Raimi's first choice for the wizard and there's no doubt he would have been a much better fit for the role.Fifty years from now they'll still be talking about the 1939 classic but I imagine very few will remember Oz the Great and Powerful, which pretty much sums it all up.",3,Franco wrong choice,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,1418,"['Great', 'Powerful', '2013', 'was', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'stars', 'James', 'Franco', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Mila', 'Kunis.What', 'chance', 'prequel', 'comparison', 'most', 'beloved', 'film', 'time', 'Director', 'Raimi', 'valiant', 'effort', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'story', 'how', 'wizard', 'originally', 'journeyed', 'Oz', 'became', 'ally', 'good', 'witch', 'Glinda', 'adversary', 'bad', 'witch', 'Theodora', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'delightful', 'just', 'getting', 'around', 'James', 'Franco', 'ham', 'fisted', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'including', 'favorite', 'character', 'animated', 'flying', 'monkey', 'Finley', 'let', 'face', 'characters', 'performances', '1939', 'classic', 'are', 'heads', 'shoulders', 'what', 'offered', 'film', 'exception', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'sweetly', 'empathetic', 'Glinda', 'Half-dollar-eyed', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'best', 'shot', 'green', 'wicked', 'witch', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'iconic', 'terrifying', 'performance', 'very', 'lovely', 'Abigail', 'Spencer', 'small', 'enjoyable', 'part', 'Franco', 'simply', 'miscast', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'was', 'Raimi', 'first', 'choice', 'wizard', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'fit', 'role.Fifty', 'years', 'now', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'talking', '1939', 'classic', 'imagine', 'very', 'few', 'will', 'remember', 'Oz', 'Great', 'Powerful', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up']",N/A

Oz (Franco) is a struggling magician in a little town in Kansas. After being chased by a jealous man he hops into a hot air balloon for an escape and soon finds himself face to face with a twister. When it's all over he finds himself in a strange land called Oz. This is a movie that I was looking forward to seeing but was a little hesitant. One reason was that I love the Wizard Of Oz and was afraid this would ruin the mystique of that movie. The other reason was I wasn't sure how you make a prequel to a movie that was a dream in the first place. That out of the way I really enjoyed this a lot. The characters are great and the movie really does a great job of setting up what will be seen in the Wizard Of Oz.

1642645,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B00C5W3SBE,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 1]","I should start out by saying I am an adult and I grew up with the 1939 movie ""Wizard of Oz.""This movie is obviously a prequel and ""re imagining"" to the famous ""Wizard of Oz"" of 1939. However, while it owes recognition factor to the earlier classic, it is a movie that stands on its own, I thought it was very entertaining and I enjoyed some of the very clever homages in this movie to the 1939 film.However I could not help but think that this movie might not appeal to everyone, especially those who are seeking more rough and tumble, destructive and violent action (i.e. ""Transformers"", ""Iron Man"", ""Dark Knight"", etc.). This is a Disney film, after all, and so it is gentler than some of the competition. It must have been tough for them to manage. They have to give the audience what it wants, yet they have to stay true to their core values. Not an easy balance, but I think this film did manage to do it to some extent substituting spectacular cleverness for violence. It worked for me, and I applaud Disney.Possible Spoiler Alert - I won't give away the plot, but I do have to mention some characters to explain my opinion of the film.The film opens, like the 1939 film, in black and white, and tells the 'back story"" of the main character, OZ, the guy who is to become the Wizard. It's a clever update of a filming trick used by the earlier film by using not only a change to color when we finally get to OZ, but also an aspect ratio change from square screen to super wide screen.The makers of the film were obviously paying homage to the 1939 movie technique and adapting it to a modern audience. I thought it was clever. For me it worked and I admired it.The images of OZ are in super color, as we would expect, and much of it does look magical enough. It's very floral. Emerald City looks suitably futuristic and the green colors and gold accents sometimes really pop. I enjoyed the throne room with its ""organ pipes"" shaped green curtains, an homage again to throne room in the 1939 movie. (At that time, Theater Pipe Organs were very much in vogue).We also have some familiar characters (Glinda, the Wicked Witch, OZ, the Munchkins) but we get some new and unexpected characters who are quite charming.New Characters Add Charm:We very quickly meet Finley, a flying monkey dressed in a bell hop's uniform. This is of course, an homage to the 1939 film's flying monkeys, with a twist. Finley is a good guy and a bit of comic relief. He's a well rendered CGI character, very expressive, that OZ plays well with. OZ does not treat him as well as he could, and although he's supposed to be a type of 'side kick' he's treated more as a 'side kickED' by OZ who takes advantage of his good nature. But then again, OZ is a flawed wizard who must learn to be a good guy instead of a selfish con man.We meet a new character that was not referenced in the 1939 film, but appears in the books, the China Doll. Of course, she's another CGI character, and is also a child. The animation and artwork here are excellent and she is a believable and fragile character. I liked her the best. OZ interacts well with her, and she brings out a sense of tenderness and nurturing in OZ that tells us, he might not be such a scoundrel after all.Glinda is as expected, blonde and magical, but not nearly as syrupy as the actress Billie Burke was in the 1939 film. She seems naive at first, but we soon learn that she's practical, got a brain, and figures out OZ's con job -- something not everyone in Emerald City figures out until it is too late.OZ himself is a likable but flawed man, one who hopes for glory, but falls short of being worthy of it until the end. As expected, he starts out selfish, conniving and arrogant, and by the end redeems himself through application of wit and wisdom, with a bit of admiration for Thomas Edison (who was not the nicest guy in the world either, nor a good role model!)Since this is a prequel, the Tin Man isn't here, but there is a slight homage to the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow of the 1939 film cleverly worked into the plot, there's even a ""Gale"" reference worked in.So the film writing has some clever moments, but you've got to pay attention to get them!Action and Pacing:Some of the action is quite good and exciting, there are times when the wicked witches are downright scary. That is aided by a bombastic soundtrack which unfortunately is a bit uneven. When the characters are talking I had to turn up the volume. When a special effect is happening I had to dive for the volume control to turn it down.Overall the special effects (especially the flying bubbles scene) are well done and sometimes thrilling. There is a large cast of characters and the 'grand battle' that is such a staple of current films (i.e. ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Hobbit"", ""Transformers"", etc.), threatens yet another 'us against them' bloodbath of fire and destruction. However, the film makers pull another twist. No one gets hurt, and nothing much gets destroyed, yet there are plenty of fireworks and yelling and crowd scenes. I enjoyed that this movie found an alternative to the popular wave of violent battles.The lesson here is that you can win a war without firing a shot, if you use imagination and ingenuity (and special effects). Not everyone may be satisfied with that, but this is a movie aimed at the family crowd.The pacing, however, is where the film may fall down for some viewers.The back story in Kansas is a bit long for those viewers who want to get to OZ and enjoy its wonders. I am thinking of younger children who are expecting to be awed right away. I can imagine them getting bored and wondering why everything is taking so long to get going.It also turns out that OZ is apparently a womanizer, love 'em and leave 'em kind of guy -- a character flaw that he must overcome (it is an important part of how he gets into trouble with the Wicked Witch). Judging by the final scene with him and Glinda, he doesn't get it, and she should know better.Conclusion:I found this film very entertaining and a good rendition of OZ before the arrival of Dorothy.The color and scenery are good, there are plenty of fantastic things to look at. The new characters are quite charming, the film stays true to the message of 'good is better than evil' and there is good action, and no real violence.I think however, it is a bit sophisticated for the 'kid' crowd who might want more magic, action, and less thoughtfulness.It is a very fine effort, very enjoyable, but it doesn't have the stuff of a classic either from MGM in 1939 or from Disney.For that, I'd recommend ""Beauty and the Beast"".",5,"A Fine Effort --  not a Classic, but Highly Entertaining",1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,6611,"['should', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'am',

I believe they weren't concerned with the answers to either of these questions. Disney executives are not stupid. They knew with some halfway decent digital effects and enough references to the 1939 classic, even an extremely mediocre script, would not sink them at the box office. And right they were! The new 'Oz' was a big success and they made gobs of cash.The new Oz reboot starts out in black and white just like the original. That's where all comparisons end. You can tell right from this opening sequence, that the magic just isn't there. Instead of 'Dorothy' and Judy Garland, we end up with the traveling circus huckster, Oscar 'Oz' Diggs, played by a miscast James Franco. Whereas the original had a compelling story about a cold hearted spinster who, under the guise of legality, expropriates a dog belonging to a heartbroken child, here, the protagonist's flirtation with the wife of a circus strong man, propels the protagonist into the dark, second act, fantasy world. While depicting the wizard as a womanizer may not kill sympathy for the character, the way in which Oz treats his subordinate, certainly does. Instead of a charming rake, Franco's 'Oz' is both part bumbler and arrogant materialist.Oscar's entrance into the world of Oz, incorporates the vehicle of the hot air balloon, so prominent in the denouement of the original. Here, in one of the many nods to the original Oz, Oscar is sucked into a tornado and ends up in a new 'Technicolor' universe. But it's way more than just the Technicolor of the original--director Rami's 'Oz' is an art deco wonderland, reminiscent of the digital effects in 'Avatar', featuring giant flowers and butterflies. Instead of a house landing on a wicked witch, Oscar's hot air balloon cascades down a waterfall, with Oscar miraculously surviving a near fatal plunge.While the digital effects are pleasing to the eye, once we meet the first character in the Land of Oz, everything is downhill from there. In the original film, Glinda the Good Witch was pitted against her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West. In this version, there are three witches: Theodora (Mila Kunis), her evil sister, Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda the Good Witch, played by Michelle Williams. At the beginning of the second Act, Kunis walks around with Franco with a completely clueless look on her face, as if she has no idea how to play the character. Feminists are sure to be appalled, as both Theodora and Glinda are doe-eyed for Oscar throughout the narrative (Theodora mistaking him for a wizard and Glinda admitting that she knows he's not the Wizard, but still can help defeat the Wicked Witch).Only later, when Evanora convinces her to take a bite of an apple, does Kunis morph into the more familiar evil, green-skinned wicked witch, and camps things up the rest of the way, battling Oscar and his minions (Weisz probably does the best acting of the three witches but her Evanora, is an unmemorable, undistinguished part). It might have been a better idea if Theodora and Evanora, were one character. Williams as Glinda is one-note throughout the film, echoing Theodora's earlier hero worship.In place of the dynamic sidekicks, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion, Oscar must be content with two allies who miss the mark: Finley, a witless flying monkey and the China Girl, a porcelain figure who Oscar mends with a bottle of glue. Oscar's act of kindness in healing the China Girl, might be good for young kids but the 'glue' scene goes on interminably too long for adults. The porcelain girl bonds with Oscar on a childlike level and ends up helping Glinda free herself from the bad witches, after she's captured and put in chains in Emerald City. Glinda in turn, neutralizes Evanora, by destroying her emerald necklace, and reducing her to an old crone.Unlike the original, where the Scarecrow, Lion and Tin Man, courageously attempt to save Dorothy by entering the Wicked Witch's lair and actually killing her, we now have the politically correct solution: Oscar assists the pacifist denizens of Oz, who don't believe in violence, by concocting a series of 'sleight of hand' magic tricks, to take back Emerald City (with an approaching World War, the 1939 scenarists apparently refused to view the world with rose-colored glasses). Evanora's army of flying baboons, are tricked into entering the poppy seed field where they fall asleep after being lured by mechanical scarecrows, constructed by Oz craftsmen (another nod in the long line of nods to the classic Oz). The powerful Theodora, proves not to be powerful at all--fleeing the city after being freaked out by Oscar's holographic projection of himself as a malevolent and powerful wizard.Oscar's transformation from arrogant con man to humanitarian, is not explained very well. What's worse is the unconvincing way in which he defeats the two seemingly powerful wicked witches (they just can't seem to realize that there's no true force behind his bag of magic tricks). In the end, we never become invested in Oscar's journey as we are in Dorothy's. When Dorothy exclaims, ""I'm scared, Auntie Em, I'm scared"", we believe it! That's because the personification of the evil she faces (in the form of the Wicked Witch) appears real. Not so for Disney's two ineffectual wicked witches and the syrupy, sentimental allies, who assist Oscar, in his quest to restore the land of Oz, to a rightful, balanced equilibrium.",1,No magic here

1642648,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00C5W3SBE,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","L. Frank Baum&#8217;s Oz stories will make a wonderful series of films. There&#8217;s so much adventure and depth in them. MGM&#8217;s 1939 movie musical, THE WIZARD OF OZ was a hit at the time of its release and is a true classic piece of cinema. The public loves it to this day and the world of Oz has remained at the forefront of popular culture (just take a look at the success of the Broadway show WICKED, for example). However, the 1939 movie has such a strong hold on popular conscience that it makes it incredibly difficult to begin a new series by starting with Baum&#8217;s first book, THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ. Disney tried to circumvent this issue by making a sequel film to the book in the 1980s with RETURN TO OZ. Though that film has gained a cult following and respect, it was initially a box office failure that was mostly panned by critics. Twenty years later, Disney is trying to circumvent MGM&#8217;s stronghold on the Oz series by returning to Oz again. However, this time it&#8217;s in the form of a prequel to Baum&#8217;s first book, entitled OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL.The story begins in 1905 Kansas with a traveling con man magician with Baum&#8217;s Bros. Circus Co. named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) who performs under the moniker &#8220;Oz the Great and Powerful&#8221; (his real name is actually so long that most people just call him Oz for short anyway). Oscar spends his time seducing young women and duping audiences into believing he&#8217;s something that he is not. However, despite his wily nature, there is goodness in him, as witnessed when he&#8217;s unable to grant a young girls wish to heal her legs. Also, despite being a conman, Oscar yearns to do something great and change the world like his hero, Thomas Edison.It&#8217;s not too long before Oscar is swept away in a Kansas funnel cloud and transported to the magical land of Oz. Upon his arrival he is greeted by a beautiful woman named Theodora (Mila Kunis). She believes he is the great wizard mentioned in a prophecy who has arrived to set Oz free from the clutches of The Wicked Witch. Theodora is also a witch, but one that is good. She escorts Oscar to The Emerald City to meet with her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) who is the steward of the city after the death of the King by hands of the Wicked Witch. Oscar soon gets thrown into the politically trouble in Oz. He befriends a small flying monkey name Finley (Zach Braff), heals a tiny China Girl (Joey King), and meets yet another witch named Glinda (Michelle Williams). Everyone in Oz believes Oscar to be The Wizard spoken of in prophecy and that he will overthrow the rule of the Wicked Witch. Everyone, but Oscar, that is.The cinematography of the film is well done and the last action sequences of the piece (when Oz reveals his &#8220;true&#8221; form) are particular spectacular. The acting is done well, particularly by Mila Kunis and Zach Braff. The movie also does a great job of beginning a new story, yet nodding it&#8217;s head to the MGM 1939 movie (e.g. look in the background for horses of different colors and the Munchkins like to sing).The movie does have a few flaws. The biggest is that James Franco just doesn&#8217;t seem right for the part of Oz. He&#8217;s got the look of a con man about him, but he never has the feel of one. Whenever he cons someone, it just feels like a little kid dressed up in adult clothes who has no idea what he&#8217;s doing and is just playing make believe. I realize that&#8217;s part of the intent of the story. However, the character of Oz should be more forceful and Franco just doesn&#8217;t give Oz the gravitas that he needs. Women will still like him because he&#8217;s good looking and charming, but the emotional depth of the character just isn&#8217;t there.Also, there middle section of the film is rather uneven. The opening sequences and the finale fit together perfectly. However, the middle section of the movie doesn&#8217;t transition very well from one moment to the next and the quick changing of sequences is sure not to sit well with some people (&#8220;Why was that middle section so long, is sure to be heard&#8221;).Overall, I was pleased with OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL. As a fan of the Baum&#8217;s stories, the movie is about what I expected. It&#8217;s not necessarily a great movie, but it is a good one and makes a good setup for some wonderful Oz stories yet to come.",4,A Taste of What Is to Come,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,4413,"['L.', 'Frank', 'Baum', '8217', 'Oz', 'stories', 'will', 'make', 'wonderful', 'series', 'films', '8217', 'so', 'much', 'adventure', 'depth', 'MGM', '8217', 's', '1939', 'movie', 'musical', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'was', 'hit', 'time', 'release', 'true', 'classic', 'piece', 'cinema', 'public', 'day', 'world', 'Oz', 'remained', 'forefront', 'popular', 'culture', 'just', 'take', 'look', 'success', 'Broadway', 'show', 'WICKED', 'example', 'However', '1939', 'movie', 'strong', 'hold', 'popular', 'conscience', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'begin', 'new', 'series', 'starting', 'Baum', '8217', 'first', 'book', 'WONDERFUL', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'Disney', 'tried', 'circumvent', 'issue', 'making', 'sequel', 'film', 'book', '1980s', 'RETURN', 'TO', 'OZ', 'film', 'gained', 'cult', 'following', 'respect', 'was', 'initially', 'box', 'office', 'failure', 'was', 'mostly', 'panned', 'critics', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Disney', 'trying', 'circumvent', 'MGM', '8217', 'stronghold', 'Oz', 'series', 'returning', 'Oz', 'again', 'However', 'time', '8217', 's', 'form', 'prequel', 'Baum', '8217', 'first', 'book', 'entitled', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'AND', 'POWERFUL.The', 'story', '1905', 'Kansas', 'traveling', 'con', 'man', 'magician', 'Baum', '8217', 'Bros', 'Circus', 'Co.', 'named', 'Oscar', 'Diggs', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'moniker', '8220', 'Great', 'Powerful', '8221', 'real', 'name', 'actually', 'so', 'long', 'most', 'people', 'just', 'call', 'Oz', 'short', 'anyway', 'Oscar', 'time', 'seducing', 'young', 'women', 'duping', 'audiences', 'believing', '8217', 'something', 'not', 'However', 'wily', 'nature', 'goodness', 'witnessed', 'when', '8217', 'unable', 'grant', 'young', 'girls', 'wish', 'heal', 'legs', 'Also', 'being', 'conman', 'Oscar', 'do', 'something', 'great', 'change', 'world', 'hero', 'Thomas', 'Edison.It', '8217', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'Oscar', 'swept', 'away', 'Kansas', 'funnel', 'cloud', 'transported', 'magical', 'land', 'Oz', 'arrival', 'greeted', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Theodora', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'great', 'wizard', 'mentioned', 'prophecy', 'who', 'arrived', 'set', 'Oz', 'free', 'clutches', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'Theodora', 'also', 'witch', 'one', 'good', 'Oscar', 'Emerald', 'City', 'meet', 'sister', 'Evanora', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'who', 'steward', 'city', 'death', 'King', 'hands', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'Oscar', 'soon', 'thrown', 'politically', 'trouble', 'Oz', 'small', 'flying', 'monkey', 'name', 'Finley', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'tiny', 'China', 'Girl', 'Joey', 'King', 'meets', 'yet', 'witch', 'named', 'Glinda', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Everyone', 'Oz', 'Oscar', 'be', 'Wizard', 'spoken', 'prophecy', 'will', 'overthrow', 'rule', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'Everyone', 'Oscar', 'is.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'last', 'action', 'sequences', 'piece', 'when', 'Oz', '8220', 'true', '8221', 'form', 'are', 'particular', 'spectacular', 'acting', 'done', 'well', 'particularly', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'beginning', 'new', 'story', 'yet', 'nodding', '8217', 's', 'head', 'MGM', '1939', 'movie', 'e.g', 'look', 'background', 'horses', 'different', 'colors', 'Munchkins', 'sing', '.The', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'flaws', 'biggest', 'James', 'Franco', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'seem', 'right', 'part', 'Oz', '8217', 'got', 'look', 'con', 'man', 'never', 'feel', 'one', 'Whenever', 'someone', 'just', 'feels', 'little', 'kid', 'dressed', 'up', 'adult', 'clothes', 'who', 'idea', 'what', '8217', 'doing', 'just', 'playing', 'make', 'believe', 'realize', '8217', 's', 'part', 'intent', 'story', 'However', 'character', 'Oz', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'forceful', 'Franco', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'give', 'Oz', 'gravitas', 'Women', 'will', 'still', 'like', '8217', 'good', 'looking', 'charming', 'emotional', 'depth', 'character', 'just', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'there.Also', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'rather', 'uneven', 'opening', 'sequences', 'finale', 'fit', 'together', 'perfectly', 'However', 'middle', 'section', 'movie', 'doesn', '8217', 'transition', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'moment', 'next', 'quick', 'changing', 'sequences', 'sure', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'people', '8220', 'Why', 'was', 'middle', 'section', 'so', 'long', 'sure', 'be', 'heard', '8221', '.Overall', 'was', 'pleased', 'OZ', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'AND', 'POWERFUL', 'fan', 'Baum', '8217', 'stories', 'movie', 'what', 'expected', '8217', 'not', 'necessarily', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'good', 'setup', 'wonderful', 'Oz', 'stories', 'yet', 'come']",N/A

He later bought the rights to 11 ""Oz"" books, but passed away before a worthwhile production was developed.  His vision was to follow the original format as a musical.  In fact scrapped ""Oz"" productions(some featuring the original Mouseketeers)were partly responsible for creating the hits ""Babes in Toyland"" and ""Mary Poppins"".  So isn't there anyone alive today who could have come up with a few snappy songs, to complement the original?  Where's Elton John when you need him?  Instead we get just another SFX ladden CGI spectacle with little of the warmth and wonder of the ""Wizard of Oz"".  It's plot is to satisfy our curiosity on how the wizard became the wizard.  James Franco is likable as the fraudulent carnival magician, that ulimately inherits the crown of the Emerald City.  Any number of actresses could have qualified to play the witches.  Franco's cohorts, a porcelain doll and a flying bellhop monkey contribute a laugh or two.

1642675,ADWSD45P3NZGU,B00C5W3SBE,WakkyWabbit,"[0, 0]","I almost bypassed this movie until I read that it was directed by Sam Raimi. I am a big fan of Raimi's work and this time he has created a cinamatic masterpiece. I cannot believe I have never heard of this movie before today. I rented and watched on a projector at 720p.The black and white intro: For those viewing on a small screen, I can imagine your frustration. I agree with the other posters and do your best to get past the intro, the rest of the movie is well worth it. I don't mean to suggest the intro is not worth watching, I was just addressing the people with small screens. The black and white is detail rich, and equally balances with tone, texture and visual appeal. The stark contrast from black and white to color gives even more emphasis to the color once it begins.The actors: The cast is well chosen. James Franco, the Oz, is suppose to an annoying con-man with little redeeming quality and I found Franco fits this role perfectly. Rachel Weisz, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis were great as the three witches, with Mila Kunis giving a great preformance. Honestly, I didn't think she had it in her.The storyline: The story is about how the Great Oz became the Great Oz and how the Wicked Witch Of The West became wicked. The background of all three witches are presented in a basic way. Done as a prequel, the story blends both old and new well.Cinematography: This is where the movie shines, or more appropriately, glows. When the black and white part ends and the color starts, each scene is like a work of art. I felt like a little kid watching the screen. All that color. I think Raimi's intent was to mirror what those viewers of the first techicolor movie must have experienced. This movie is meant for high definition and the big screen but even at 720p, my viewing experience was amazing. I wish I could view it in a theater.There is no bad language, no nekkid people, a couple of fight scenes (actors land very hard after being hit by magic) and a few scary, flying monkies. There is a big tornado scene. The Wicked Witch does threaten to eliminate all the good people. However, the good vs evil is well balanced with good triumphing in the end.If you are one of those people that could care less about nostalgia and just want to see a high action movie with a lot of special graphics, this movie is not for you. This movie is meant to reflect the original, almost a period piece with some enhanced graphics. I feel many teenagers and some of the 20-30/something crowd will not appreciate it.

Something you can actually watch with the kids and not have to worry about what they are going to be subjected to.  Where Disney is making a big mistake is with their comb o packs.

It is not Android friendly and it is not Ultra-Violet friendly.The second big issue is that the combo packs are now being split.

Camp,"[2, 6]","I received Oz the great and powerful 3d package, purchased from amazon was outraged to find there were no special features or blu ray disk in said pkg or on said disk and promptly returned it. I am a Disney rewards member and saw an unlocked offer for a separate $5.99 for the blu ray with special features, then noticed the flyer in the disk saying to get the blu ray you needed to join disney rewards and apply for said reward. I guess if youre not willing to join nor pay over $31.34,( plus tax if bought outside of amazon), plus %5.99 you are on your own.I was astounded! Also the digital copy is restricted to one retailer Amazon, Vudu or Itunes, not two as is normal for $29.99 or less 3d, blu ray, dvd and ultraviolet plus digital copy dvds. I am so thankful to Amazon. I returned that sucker no questions asked. Out of order. other retailers you would have been stuck.In what world?! On top of that the offer for $8.00 off your overpriced theater ticket of Lone Ranger 3d or 2d on Disney Rewards is limited to a measly $8.00 not the usual $10.00 or more AND RESTRICTED TO THE BLU RAY DVD COMBO VERSION NOT THE 3D VERSION. THE $5.00 Coupon they had for preorders I noticed was also only on the blu ray version not the 3d version. I forgoed that to buy the 3d version and that is what I get? On Disney.com as far as I know, and at brick and mortar and other online retailers its $34.99 plus tax and this is what you get? This is an outrage! I could have bought the blu ray version and converted it to 3D ON MY 3D BLU RAY PLAYERS. This is an outrage! I highly doubt I will be doing that. If I do it will only be for the $8.00 off the Lone Ranger ticket.
