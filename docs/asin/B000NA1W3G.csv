It's full of intrigue and I like how the story progresses.  Very intelligently gone and classy.  The acting was fair, but some of the scenes were badly made (particularly the fighting scences).

This wasn't as sexy as the first, Sean Blakemore simply read his way through the part, and Joe Torry basiclally played the same role he did in Poetic Justice. Brian White gives a dead-on personification of Shemar Moore's role in the first film, so it was believeable that he was an estranged brother. I thought the plot wasn't as tightly wound as the first, but everything seemed to pull together at the end, which kinda didn't make sense: did Connie plan to use Brandon all the while? That was a lingering question for me.And what was Drew Sidora's role in the movie?

1054960,A3P7R0L2TTL7QB,B000NA1W3G,tkay,"[2, 2]","I didn't give this movie 5-Stars because it falls short when comparing it to the first one. The plot has too many twists and turns in it and it gets down right confusing at times. This is a movie that you have to watch twice to finally ""get."" I had to watch ""Beloved"" a couple of times before I ""got"" it. It could have been a lot better but it just wasn't.It would have been nice if Brian White's character, Donovan, had a relationship with his brother, Emory (Shemar Moore), and had a desire to avenge his downfall. His quest appeared to be forced upon him. The movie was nearly over when he finally showed some type of emotion regarding his brother's death. Also, it was never revealed why Donovan and his brother drifted apart for so many years.This movie also had too many 'conveniences.' It was too convenient for Joe Torry's character to break into a house and download incriminating files from a computer. It was too convenient that Emory had a long lost brother that no one had ever heard of before to leave all of his assets to. It was also convenient that there was evidence of another person being at the crime scene (in the first ""Motives"") after Emory died. Weren't the police suspicious when his ex-wife married his best friend, Brandon (Sean Blakemore), the guy he claimed set him up? And what exactly happened to Emory? How was he killed in prison? Who killed him and why? And why wasn't a background check done on Brandon before he was employed and promoted at a prestigious company? And what happened to the money the police took away from Joe Torry's character? This movie left too many unanswered questions.Also, it would have been nice if Donovan hadn't cheated on his girlfriend. He got with a co-worker then went home and kissed on his girl like it was nothing. Brandon was unfaithful also but that was expected of him.I gave it 4-Stars instead of 3 because of Brian White. He is an excellent actor and he's very easy on the eye. All of the actors did a great job, although it was hard for me to look at Vivica's new lips.This movie (like a lot of sequels) did not quite live up to the original but it is entertaining.
