1361302,A31P7QU36HM93H,B003SC9AYE,happy singer,"[3, 3]",I love the music of the Hoppers.  This DVD helps you get to know them a little better.  Connie has such a wonderful voice and I wish that she would sing more solos.  Dean is a good singer too.  It was nice to meet their children.  I know that being on the road giving concerts all the time must be a hard way to make a living but the Hoppers seem to be enjoying it.  They love singing and it shows.,5,Best of the Hoppers,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,398,"['love', 'music', 'Hoppers', 'DVD', 'get', 'know', 'little', 'better', 'Connie', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'wish', 'would', 'sing', 'more', 'solos', 'Dean', 'good', 'singer', 'too', 'was', 'nice', 'meet', 'children', 'know', 'being', 'road', 'giving', 'concerts', 'time', 'must', 'be', 'hard', 'way', 'make', 'living', 'Hoppers', 'seem', 'be', 'enjoying', 'love', 'singing']",The Best of the Hoppers
