The build up to the debate is rather long.. Right before the debate and right after there is gangster rap which I suppose is intended to conjure an image of Muhammad Ali and George Foreman putting on the gloves; however, you're probably more likely to flash back to ""8 Mile.""In the end, the arguments you don't hear parroted are the ones with too much exposure and you'll be glad for that. However, you will wish at times the more established and polished retorts were provided. I think three times Douglas states it would be ""ok"" for an atheist to kill because the universe is indifferent. Hitchen's counter to this assault is woefully ineffective. As an atheist, I wanted walk into the tv and kill him.I think Hitchens has came a long way with his oral debate, but he still pales in comparison to Dawkins. I think he needs someone who follows these debates to tell him personally what isn't working because his defense is much less effective than his offense.As for Douglas, well I liked him for exactly the same reason Hitchens liked him (he tells why at the start of the film).

1277816,A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B002M3SHTO,Annihilatrix1138,"[11, 14]","I was taking a bit of a risk ordering a DVD that supposedly contained a debate that hasn't already been covered in Hitchens', Harris' or Dawkins' books. $15 is a pretty steep price for something that can more than likely be seen in any one of Hitchens' innumerable Youtube videos. But I ordered it because I am a fan of Hitchens' work, and I have an increasing interest in Douglas Wilson's published responses to critics of Christian theology.So here I am, fifteen dollars in the hole, and how did it work in my favor? Well, I certainly don't regret it. And I don't feel like I merely broke even. So that's something.What I loved about this film was that it presented the opportunity to see Christopher Hitchens debate someone who seems to truly understand his religion. Douglas Wilson is one of the very few people that I've seen in debate who knows were to draw the line of fact and fiction in the bible. He does not take everything at face value, and often knows the deeper meaning behind certain parts of scripture. For instance, his explanation that the Parable of the Good Samaritan isn't a mere morality tale was enlightening and, well, something I'd never before considered.Hitchens is his usual, sharp, articulate and cogent self. Able to argue nearly any claim postulated by dogmatic apologists without a second's delay. He rarely, if ever, finds himself backed into a corner without a word to say about it.When the two are together, it's all very fine. The two of them are able to participate in back and forth arguments with ease, and neither of them ever seem to get completely hung up on specific topics. They're very dynamic together, and when they debate the atmosphere becomes very electrically-charged at times.In combination with the pair's interaction, the subject of their debates, their respective intelligence, their exchanges are absolutely marvelous to watch. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and have a new-found respect for Wilson. I plan on buying one of his books as soon as I can manage.The real problem of this documentary is not the subject matter or the debaters themselves, but rather the directing and editing. I was fantastically annoyed by the insane cuts, extreme camera angles, and amateur effects added to this film. Everything from grayscale to film grain effects are added as if to jazz it all up. As if the filmmaker thought that people just weren't going to be entertained enough by the debates.Picture a professional and respectful debate filmed like a motocross race.It shouldn't be about entertainment here. Not when it comes to theological debates, that is. So you can just throw that right out the window. People are looking for different points of view in a professional forum, and they don't need hip hop or hard rock music playing in the background to be more connected to this display.The most preposterous moment in the whole film was near the end, where Hitchens and Wilson depart a plane, and the scene is filmed like one of the thousands of rap music videos circulating out there. Slow motion. Black and white. Hip hop music playing in the background. Modern editing. It was absolutely absurd. It was as if the creators had no real respect for the subject matter. The director and editor should never be allowed near a studio ever again. Never. Ever.Religulousis one of my most favorite films on the subject. It brought forth some serious, debatable questions, but at the same time...it was comedy. Since then, I've been praying (hehe) for someone like Hitchens to make something of similar scope. In the case of COLLISION, a better director, and at least another half-hour's worth of coverage of the debates (90 minutes is hardly time for anything. Not when most of it's filled with random montages.) could have made this a very important documentary, instead of just a passable one.Pick this up if you're a fan of Hitchens or Wilson, or if you want to see a few debate points that haven't had much coverage lately. Other than that, you're probably better off hitting up Youtube.",3,A Worthwhile Debate Marred By Silly Editing,1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,4029,"['was', 'taking', 'bit', 'risk', 'ordering', 'DVD', 'supposedly', 'contained', 'debate', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'covered', 'Hitchens', 'Harris', 'Dawkins', 'books', '15', 'pretty', 'steep', 'price', 'something', 'can', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'Hitchens', 'innumerable', 'Youtube', 'videos', 'ordered', 'am', 'fan', 'Hitchens', 'work', 'have', 'increasing', 'interest', 'Douglas', 'Wilson', 'published', 'responses', 'critics', 'Christian', 'theology.So', 'here', 'am', 'fifteen', 'dollars', 'hole', 'how', 'did', 'work', 'favor', 'Well', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'merely', 'broke', 'even', 'something.What', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'presented', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Christopher', 'Hitchens', 'debate', 'someone', 'who', 'truly', 'understand', 'religion', 'Douglas', 'Wilson', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'people', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'debate', 'who', 'were', 'draw', 'line', 'fact', 'fiction', 'bible', 'not', 'take', 'everything', 'face', 'value', 'often', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'certain', 'parts', 'scripture', 'instance', 'explanation', 'Parable', 'Good', 'Samaritan', ""n't"", 'mere', 'morality', 'tale', 'was', 'enlightening', 'well', 'something', ""'d"", 'never', 'considered.Hitchens', 'usual', 'sharp', 'articulate', 'cogent', 'self', 'Able', 'argue', 'nearly', 'claim', 'postulated', 'dogmatic', 'apologists', 'second', 'delay', 'rarely', 'ever', 'backed', 'corner', 'word', 'say', 'it.When', 'two', 'are', 'together', 'very', 'fine', 'two', 'are', 'able', 'participate', 'back', 'forth', 'arguments', 'ease', 'ever', 'seem', 'get', 'completely', 'hung', 'up', 'specific', 'topics', ""'re"", 'very', 'dynamic', 'together', 'when', 'debate', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'electrically-charged', 'times.In', 'combination', 'pair', 'interaction', 'subject', 'debates', 'respective', 'intelligence', 'exchanges', 'are', 'absolutely', 'marvelous', 'watch', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'have', 'new-found', 'respect', 'Wilson', 'plan', 'buying', 'one', 'books', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'manage.The', 'real', 'problem', 'documentary', 'not', 'subject', 'matter', 'debaters', 'rather', 'directing', 'editing', 'was', 'fantastically', 'annoyed', 'insane', 'cuts', 'extreme', 'camera', 'angles', 'amateur', 'effects', 'added', 'film', 'Everything', 'grayscale', 'film', 'grain', 'effects', 'are', 'added', 'jazz', 'up', 'filmmaker', 'thought', 'people', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'entertained', 'enough', 'debates.Picture', 'professional', 'respectful', 'debate', 'filmed', 'motocross', 'race.It', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'about', 'entertainment', 'here', 'Not', 'when', 'theological', 'debates', 'can', 'just', 'throw', 'that', 'right', 'out', 'window', 'People', 'are', 'looking', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'professional', 'forum', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'hip', 'hop', 'hard', 'rock', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'be', 'more', 'connected', 'display.The', 'most', 'preposterous', 'moment', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'end', 'where', 'Hitchens', 'Wilson', 'depart', 'plane', 'scene', 'filmed', 'one', 'thousands', 'rap', 'music', 'videos', 'circulating', 'out', 'there', 'Slow', 'motion', 'Black', 'white', 'Hip', 'hop', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'Modern', 'editing', 'was', 'absolutely', 'absurd', 'was', 'creators', 'had', 'real', 'respect', 'subject', 'matter', 'director', 'editor', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'studio', 'ever', 'again', 'Never', 'Ever.Religulousis', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'films', 'subject', 'brought', 'forth', 'serious', 'debatable', 'questions', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'comedy', 'then', ""'ve"", 'been', 'praying', 'hehe', 'someone', 'Hitchens', 'make', 'something', 'similar', 'scope', 'case', 'COLLISION', 'better', 'director', 'least', 'half-hour', 'worth', 'coverage', 'debates', '90', 'minutes', 'hardly', 'time', 'anything', 'Not', 'when', 'most', 'filled', 'random', 'montages', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'important', 'documentary', 'instead', 'just', 'passable', 'one.Pick', 'up', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Hitchens', 'Wilson', 'want', 'see', 'few', 'debate', 'points', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'coverage', 'lately', 'Other', ""'re"", 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'hitting', 'up', 'Youtube']",N/A

1277819,A4TVX5141Y2TG,B002M3SHTO,"Douglas Groothuis ""Douglas Groothuis""","[13, 25]","This production suffers from all the worst of the postmodern sensibility and aesthetic. While billed as a ""debate,"" there is no linear presentation of ideas in a classic debate forum. Rather, the video jumps from one setting to another. Now it's a TV exchange; then it's a debate at a seminary; next they are in a bar. I lost track of how many settings there were. It is maddening to anyone trained in linear logical thinking and analysis. All the actual arguments between the two men are clipped and lack sufficient context.Moreover, the camera angles, set conditions, and lighting are deeply annoying. There are strange high-glare closeups, jiggling cameras, as well noisy backgrounds. It is unnerving. Call it videographic ADHD.Despite all this unnecessary clutter and chaos, a few arguments stand out. For example, Wilson claims that Hitchens has no philosophical grounding for his moral pronouncements, and Hitchens admits as much while denying God as a foundation for morality. Those trained in apologetics, will note that Wilson uses the Van Tillian presuppositional method (with some help from C.S. Lewis on objective moral law). This approach, while helpful for critiquing non-Christian worldviews, has deep limitations in apologetics, since it can marshall no genuine constructive arguments based on natural theology, science, and history. At several points, Wilson seems to concede that he and Hitchens inhabit different thought worlds entirely. If so, how can you build a logical or evidential bridge with the unbeliever? The cumulative case approach--used by William Craig, J.P. Moreland, Douglas Geivett, (if I may) myself, and many others--is the far better method. See Craig's debate with Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, ""God: A Debate Between a Christian and an Atheist"" (Oxford, 2003).Unlike Hitchens, Wilson is not that articulate. However, he is knowledgeable, courageous, and funny at times. He reduces Hitchens worldview to this at the end: ""There is no God: s--t happens.""We need more Christians, who, like Wilson, are willing to engage in meaningful debates with unbelievers. However, we need less DVDS in which the original debate form is debauched through the insane postmodern insistence on fragmentation and incoherence.",2,Terrible format.

1277820,AEGOH3LUD467S,B002M3SHTO,"Jerry W. Scott ""2totango""","[8, 11]","I found this video very confusing to say the least. Not because of the protagonists, as they are superb, but for technical reasons. I have read Hitchens book ""God is not great"" and admire his savvy about the topic of non-believing. Everyone should read Hitchen's take on religion for enlightenment if not for amusement and I told you so opportunities. Douglas Wilson is new to me.  He has a first rate mind but is somewhat suffering from compulsiveness and rambling incoherent arguments. I kept asking myself, ""What did he say? How's that again?"" Because of the poor editing I suppose, there are numerous non sequiturs on camera from both men that are very distracting. This video has a lot going for it but it is a mess as far as editing, POV, sound, unfocused and jerky camera work. This was a great opportunity to hear two heavyweights debate ""whither God"" but the film editors royally screwed it up by constantly changing venues, topics, camera angles, and inserting grainy black and white shots over pristine color. There are long establishing shots with a rap or hip hop song blaring about something or the other in the background that further alienate the viewer's attention. Having said that, there are great moments in the film of revelations and a fair amount of gallows humor. Hitchen's is a brilliant speaker but more than meets his match with Wilson, the bibliophile that never met a quotation he didn't like. However, the funniest quote in the film came from Hitchen's who says at one point, ""Nietzsche said 'God is dead,' and Freud said 'God is dad'."" (See the film). I felt like the film was really a long commercial for their collaborative book on the topic of Christianity, as it's mentioned many times throughout the documentary, but maybe not. In the end, Hitchen's makes an astounding revelation about his own philosophy which was quite compelling. Wilson, unfortunately, does not concede an iota towards Hitchen's thoughtful arguments which in my opinion outweigh the triteness of Wilson's unwavering faith.  All this goes to show as Carl Sagan has written that once the mind has convinced itself of a fact or idea (such as God) there is hardly any way the mind can be persuaded differently...so here we have two good examples of a conversation of the deaf. It was worth the nine bucks I paid to view it but I wish the editing had been more coherent.

And Collision may or may not be any different. But what I really appreciated about Collision is that it gives a bit of an inside look into the thinking process of Douglas Wilson and Christopher Hitchens; it reveals how they came into their respective beliefs. Most of all, I really enjoyed Collision because it was a clash of two brilliant, well-spoken men, who have really given their positions thought.I also liked that it gave me a different perspective of Christopher Hitchens. As a Christian, I usually found Christopher to be a little abrasive. But in Collision, I found him to be very cordial, well-spoken, and quite honestly, not the Christopher Hitchens I thought I knew.I also have to hand it to Douglas Wilson. He showed that he was well educated, well spoken, and despite how unpopular conservative Christian beliefs are, he doesn't try to water them down or butter-up Christianity so that it will sound ""better"" to Hitchens or the audience.I also really enjoyed the moments where Hitchens and Wilson just seemed to be enjoying each other's company, and not debating or even talking about religion, but instead were just sharing common interests.Even though I don't think Collision will change anyone's mind about theism or atheism (or at least not greatly), I still think it is worth watching just to see two brilliant men go at it. I think fans of Hitchens will really appreciate how articulate Wilson is, and I think Christians will appreciate seeing a side of Hitchens that doesn't seem so cold, as he might appear on camera in other settings.

Others are bound to evade the important issues. Still others are snoody and convoluted-you know when a Christian meets a snoody intellectual atheist who thinks he isn't a fundamentalist. Rest assured, when Christopher Hitchens and Douglas Wilson meet in a debate, we are sure to have a different sort of debate. And it will likely lean on the vigorous side.  I guess one could say it's the sort of debate Richard Dawkins couldn't have if he was paid a billion dollars for it. He just doesn't have the oomph for it.Here we have a great showdown, two contrarian fellows who even sometimes upset their own team find themselves subjected to a prolonged dialouge with a truly worthy opponent spread over various venues. They  may share the same planet, but their thought is so starkly different that at times they appear to reside in different worlds. And in a way they do. This is not really just a collision of ideas, more like a collision of lives-you really see it in the film.You get the sense that Wilson and Hitchens, beyond their arguments, have this sort of thing for each other, a sort of friendship.  There's a certain hint of mutual respect. There's a certain hint incredulity. Hitchens appreciates finally findinga Christian who believes what he is defending and is willing to take it to its logical conclusions. Wilson appears to delight in having finally found a relevant ""new atheist"". And they have some fun with it, there's a Wodehouse ""jam session"" of sorts where they are flinging quotes, and it is a riot.Now, don't approach this film expecting a linear debate. It is moreso a collection of scattered cross-sections and various exerpts from the debates set in a variety of locations (ranging from Westminster Seminary on one hand and a few pubs on another hand). It is very unlinear, to the point of becoming unsettling.  But it has a certain charm and is produced fairly well! At points the video  makes them seem like rap stars or gangsters, but this sort of adds to the mystique. I hope that this video drives some people to actually seek out some of the full debates and watch them or listen to them, since their linear nature will probably lead to a fuller understanding.The interchange is great. Wilson makes a good stand as a bold Van Tilian Biblical absolutist. Hitchens also plays his normal role. Both are witty and both really put themselves into this thing. I think Wilson makes a great, rugged case for the Christian worldview and the impossibility/absurdity of the contrary and he takes a lot of courage in subjecting himself to a thorough ""Hitchens treatment"".(And just as a bit of warning for those who would like to know, there is some coarse language, not gratuitous, but it is there)",5,Collision - An Unexpected Approach to a Debate Video,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,2810,"['film', 'excellent-but', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'debates', 'are', 'destined', 'be', 'boring', 'Others', 'are', 'bound', 'evade', 'important', 'issues', 'Still', 'others', 'are', 'snoody', 'convoluted-you', 'know', 'when', 'Christian', 'snoody', 'intellectual', 'atheist', 'who', ""n't"", 'fundamentalist', 'Rest', 'assured', 'when', 'Christopher', 'Hitchens', 'Douglas', 'Wilson', 'meet', 'debate', 'are', 'sure', 'have', 'different', 'sort', 'debate', 'will', 'likely', 'lean', 'vigorous', 'side', 'guess', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'sort', 'debate', 'Richard', 'Dawkins', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'was', 'paid', 'billion', 'dollars', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'oomph', 'it.Here', 'have', 'great', 'showdown', 'two', 'contrarian', 'fellows', 'who', 'even', 'sometimes', 'upset', 'own', 'team', 'find', 'subjected', 'prolonged', 'dialouge', 'truly', 'worthy', 'opponent', 'spread', 'various', 'venues', 'may', 'share', 'same', 'planet', 'thought', 'so', 'starkly', 'different', 'times', 'appear', 'reside', 'different', 'worlds', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'just', 'collision', 'ideas', 'more', 'collision', 'lives-you', 'really', 'see', 'film.You', 'get', 'sense', 'Wilson', 'Hitchens', 'arguments', 'have', 'sort', 'thing', 'other', 'sort', 'friendship', 'certain', 'hint', 'mutual', 'respect', 'certain', 'hint', 'incredulity', 'appreciates', 'finally', 'findinga', 'Christian', 'who', 'what', 'defending', 'willing', 'take', 'logical', 'conclusions', 'Wilson', 'delight', 'having', 'finally', 'found', 'relevant', 'new', 'atheist', 'have', 'fun', 'Wodehouse', 'jam', 'session', 'sorts', 'where', 'are', 'flinging', 'quotes', 'riot.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'approach', 'film', 'expecting', 'linear', 'debate', 'moreso', 'collection', 'scattered', 'cross-sections', 'various', 'exerpts', 'debates', 'set', 'variety', 'locations', 'ranging', 'Westminster', 'Seminary', 'one', 'hand', 'few', 'pubs', 'hand', 'very', 'unlinear', 'point', 'becoming', 'unsettling', 'certain', 'charm', 'produced', 'fairly', 'well', 'points', 'video', 'seem', 'rap', 'stars', 'gangsters', 'sort', 'mystique', 'hope', 'video', 'people', 'actually', 'seek', 'out', 'full', 'debates', 'watch', 'listen', 'linear', 'nature', 'will', 'probably', 'lead', 'fuller', 'understanding.The', 'interchange', 'great', 'Wilson', 'good', 'stand', 'bold', 'Van', 'Tilian', 'Biblical', 'absolutist', 'Hitchens', 'also', 'normal', 'role', 'are', 'witty', 'really', 'put', 'thing', 'think', 'Wilson', 'great', 'rugged', 'case', 'Christian', 'worldview', 'impossibility/absurdity', 'contrary', 'lot', 'courage', 'subjecting', 'thorough', 'Hitchens', 'treatment', 'just', 'bit', 'warning', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'coarse', 'language', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'there']",N/A

1277826,A2Y47HN5IP85J,B002M3SHTO,M. Richardson,"[14, 18]","What a disappointment! Intelligent and civil debate between atheists and Christians is definitely necessary in modern times, what with all of the explosive confrontations between these two groups of people in America these days. So I looked forward to this film, especially since I typically enjoy listening to Christopher Hitchens.There was little to love in this film, however.First, the production quality of the film is lousy. Obnoxious hip-hop music and MTV-style cinematography only add layers of frustration and confusion to the already underwhelming content of the debate itself (more on that in a minute). This is completely inappropriate. Hitchens and Wilson are having a philosophical debate, and, as form should accentuate content rather than undermining it, the form should reflect the clarity and rationality of a proper debate. I felt like I was watching a rap video instead.As to the debate itself, it is supremely disappointing. I can't help but hope that perhaps the editing of this was deceptive, because if it wasn't then Mr. Hitchens clearly does not know how to debate religious issues. He spends the whole film mumbling something about the guilt religious people feel and that if God were real he'd be like a celestial dictator. OK: but this doesn't come to the central point of whether Christianity is true or not. Wilson, whatever his deceptive rhetoric, understands the centrality of this point and keeps on it. The result is that Wilson cleans the floor with Hitchens. In any discussion of whether Christianity is ""good for the world"" or not, the first thing to clear up is whether or not it is true. Extremely tight and powerful cases for the truth of atheism (or, at least, the unlikelihood of theism being true) have been made in the past, but we see nothing of the kind here. The debate is at its worst when it comes to morality. Wilson's argument is filled with holes and Hitchens is STILL defeated by it (in this reviewer's opinion at least). For goodness' sake, Hitchens is a sitting duck out there: pull him out and replace him with a more capable intellectual!Neither Hitchens nor Wilson come off as particularly profound thinkers here, but in the context of this film, Wilson is clearly the winning party.",1,Good Concept; Bad Execution,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,2242,"['What', 'disappointment', 'Intelligent', 'civil', 'debate', 'atheists', 'Christians', 'definitely', 'necessary', 'modern', 'times', 'what', 'explosive', 'confrontations', 'two', 'groups', 'people', 'America', 'days', 'looked', 'forward', 'film', 'especially', 'typically', 'enjoy', 'listening', 'Christopher', 'Hitchens.There', 'was', 'little', 'love', 'film', 'however.First', 'production', 'quality', 'film', 'lousy', 'Obnoxious', 'hip-hop', 'music', 'MTV-style', 'cinematography', 'only', 'layers', 'frustration', 'confusion', 'already', 'underwhelming', 'content', 'debate', 'more', 'minute', 'completely', 'inappropriate', 'Hitchens', 'Wilson', 'are', 'having', 'philosophical', 'debate', 'form', 'should', 'accentuate', 'content', 'rather', 'undermining', 'form', 'should', 'reflect', 'clarity', 'rationality', 'proper', 'debate', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'rap', 'video', 'instead.As', 'debate', 'supremely', 'disappointing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hope', 'perhaps', 'editing', 'was', 'deceptive', 'was', ""n't"", 'then', 'Mr.', 'Hitchens', 'clearly', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'debate', 'religious', 'issues', 'whole', 'film', 'mumbling', 'something', 'guilt', 'religious', 'people', 'feel', 'God', 'were', 'real', ""'d"", 'be', 'celestial', 'dictator', 'OK', ""n't"", 'come', 'central', 'point', 'Christianity', 'true', 'not', 'Wilson', 'deceptive', 'rhetoric', 'centrality', 'point', 'result', 'Wilson', 'floor', 'Hitchens', 'discussion', 'Christianity', 'good', 'world', 'not', 'first', 'thing', 'clear', 'up', 'not', 'true', 'Extremely', 'tight', 'powerful', 'cases', 'truth', 'atheism', 'least', 'unlikelihood', 'theism', 'being', 'true', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'past', 'see', 'nothing', 'kind', 'here', 'debate', 'worst', 'when', 'morality', 'Wilson', 'argument', 'filled', 'holes', 'Hitchens', 'STILL', 'defeated', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'least', 'goodness', 'sake', 'Hitchens', 'sitting', 'duck', 'there', 'pull', 'out', 'replace', 'more', 'capable', 'intellectual', 'Hitchens', 'Wilson', 'come', 'off', 'particularly', 'profound', 'thinkers', 'here', 'context', 'film', 'Wilson', 'clearly', 'winning', 'party']",N/A

Hitchens was a writer, journalist, and public speaker as well as the author of the bestseller ""God is not great: how religion poisons everything.""  Wilson is a reformed and evangelical theologian, pastor, author, and speaker.It should be emphasized that this is not a debate in one place where Hitchens states his views from one podium and Wilson states his views from another podium.  Instead we get to follow both debaters in formal (example: Temple Emmanu-el, NYC) and informal (like taverns and their tour limousine) settings.  Filming the debate this way makes for, at least in my opinion, an fascinating documentary that's never boring.I found that all of Hitchens' responses to be concrete, precise, and understandable whereas Wilson's responses were sometimes difficult to understand (at least for me).Here is a good and typical response from Hitchens (which is even more interesting considering an asteroid was named after him after his death):""It's in the natural world, it's in the world of science and in the world of innovation and discovery and doubt [that] we wouldn't have discovered any of these things [like the fascinating objects in space courtesy of the Hubble Space Telescope] if we had taken the religious story for granted to begin with.  We would have said we already knew enough, we knew God made this [and] God wants it this way.  What's the need for inquiry, we already have all the information we need.""Wilson was asked the following question from an audience member:""How do you explain countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, or Denmark that are majority atheist, agnostic, or non-believing but are among the most morally healthy countries in the world?""Wilson's answer to this question:""That's a great question.  The prodigal son didn't run out of money the first day away from home.  So when the checks started to bounce, they started to bounce later.""The only part of this documentary I did not appreciate was when the background music turned to loud rap music but this occurred in only one sequence.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2010) is perfect in visual and audio quality.

This should be a ""must see"" for debaters on how to comport yourself with dignity while absolutely disagreeing with your opponent.Hitchens and Wilson appear in ugly little conference rooms and cozy pubs to debate one another.Both men know their stuff and the debate seems effortless and very intelligent which makes watching it enjoyably informative.The highlights for me were the two men's conversations in the limo traveling to the various events.  That is where they seemed most real and although the cameras were still going they seemed most honest with one another.",5,"Great Debate in the Age of ""Whatever""",1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,1607,"['am', 'thrilled', 'day', 'can', 'be', 'DVD', 'produced', 'anti-theism', 'Christianity', 'AND', 'people', 'want', 'watch', 'AND', 'get', 'excited', 'debate', 'Douglas', 'Wilson', 'pastor', 'Moscow', 'Idaho', 'prolific', 'author', 'Christopher', 'Hitchens', 'author', 'columnist', 'question', 'religion', 'good', 'world', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'honed', 'ideas', 'fine', 'point', 'waste', 'time', 'getting', 'across.Their', 'debates', 'take', 'place', 'east', 'coast', 'U.S.', 'bit', 'music', 'video', 'format', 'kind', 'artsy', 'jumpy', 'blurry', 'fast', 'images', 'sort', 'way', 'half', 'way', 'photographer', 'down', 'can', 'catch', 'real', 'glimpse', 'two', 'men', 'get', 'bit', 'feel', 'character.To', 'men', 'credit', 'gentlemanly', 'conduct', 'towards', 'one', 'while', 'vehemently', 'disagreeing', 'alone', 'worth', 'watch', 'people', 'differing', 'sides', 'issue', 'could', 'comport', 'manner', 'staunchly', 'defending', 'belief', 'would', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'see', 'debaters', 'how', 'comport', 'dignity', 'absolutely', 'disagreeing', 'opponent.Hitchens', 'Wilson', 'appear', 'ugly', 'little', 'conference', 'rooms', 'cozy', 'pubs', 'debate', 'one', 'men', 'know', 'stuff', 'debate', 'effortless', 'very', 'intelligent', 'watching', 'enjoyably', 'highlights', 'were', 'two', 'men', 'conversations', 'limo', 'traveling', 'various', 'events', 'where', 'seemed', 'most', 'real', 'cameras', 'were', 'still', 'going', 'seemed', 'most', 'honest', 'one']",N/A
1277832,AAD0UN7NQAA55,B002M3SHTO,Tim K,"[3, 4]","Christopher Hitchens, a self-described anti-theist, and Douglas Wilson, a christian theologian, go head-to-head in this wonderful documentary. 'Collision' documents these two men's debates, discussions, and other events that fall under the topic that the movie is all about, ""Is Christianity Good For The World?"". Both men have great respect for one another, and it shows. Both are gracious to each other, but do not mince words when it comes to the topic at hand, christianity. Hitchens believes christianity to be a cult and should be elimated, as should all religion. Wilson is a devout christian, and believes it is good for the world. As you can tell, very opposite viewpointsIt would've been nice to have included a full debate between the two men as an added bonus, but overall, this DVD was worth the price.Atheist? Theist? Agnostic?

1277833,A1EL1J7S2NC752,B002M3SHTO,Zenbones,"[4, 7]","Collision is not all bad, but if you require an unbiased look at these two authors in action you would do well to look elsewhere, as the film was made by born again Christians.It should have been made by an impartial, because as it is, it contains many biases - clever camera angles, suggestive music, shots of Hitchens left silent after a rebuttal (which he has never been in any debate I've ever seen). If an atheist would have made this film there would be no doubt similar biases. The way the ending was done is really the clincher as far the bias problem. I found it quite ridiculous, as did many others.I have seen many of the debates between these two in full (uncut, unedited, with no music etc) and found them infinity superior. You would you do much better to view the original, undoctored, unedited source material from these talks, as well as many others, which can easily be found on YouTube and elsewhere.I think most people who have seen this were on one side of the fence or another, and saw what they needed to see.Perhaps the Hitchens fans, and the Atheists in general, will be disappointed by aforementioned biases.The Christians perhaps will possibly feel like they were cheating a little. This is the first and most important problem regarding this film.The second is, that the film itself is not very made technically. The hip hop and metal music score is irritating to say the least. The camera angles and extreme close ups are very distracting.Not recommended.",2,A Film Made by a 'Believer',1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,1484,"['Collision', 'not', 'bad', 'require', 'unbiased', 'look', 'two', 'authors', 'action', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'born', 'again', 'Christians.It', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'impartial', 'many', 'biases', 'clever', 'camera', 'angles', 'suggestive', 'music', 'shots', 'Hitchens', 'left', 'silent', 'rebuttal', 'never', 'been', 'debate', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'atheist', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'doubt', 'similar', 'biases', 'way', 'ending', 'was', 'done', 'really', 'clincher', 'far', 'bias', 'problem', 'found', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'did', 'many', 'others.I', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'debates', 'two', 'full', 'uncut', 'unedited', 'music', 'etc', 'found', 'infinity', 'superior', 'would', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'view', 'original', 'undoctored', 'unedited', 'source', 'material', 'talks', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'others', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'found', 'YouTube', 'elsewhere.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'were', 'one', 'side', 'fence', 'saw', 'what', 'needed', 'see.Perhaps', 'Hitchens', 'fans', 'Atheists', 'general', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'aforementioned', 'biases.The', 'Christians', 'perhaps', 'will', 'possibly', 'feel', 'were', 'cheating', 'little', 'first', 'most', 'important', 'problem', 'regarding', 'film.The', 'second', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'made', 'technically', 'hip', 'hop', 'metal', 'music', 'score', 'irritating', 'say', 'least', 'camera', 'angles', 'extreme', 'close', 'ups', 'are', 'very', 'distracting.Not', 'recommended']",N/A
