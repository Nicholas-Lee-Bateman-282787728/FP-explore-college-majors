768409,A33L7G4E8CID3,B0000AVHCD,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[110, 113]","I would say that Law and Order: CI is, without a doubt, the best Law and Order spinoff and it is always a thrill to watch Det. Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) engage in another intellectual cat-and-mouse game with a brilliant, twisted killer. CI is, quite simply, must see tv.The first year had the show proving itself admirably. Goren and his partner, Alexandria Eames (Katherine Erbe) quickly become a modern-day Holmes and Watson duo, with Goren as the seemingly omniscient, stalwart detective and Eames lending a lot of humanity to the proceedings. Jamey Sheridan plays Goren and Eames' CO, a buttoned-down, more traditional cop. Courtney B. Vance plays the 'Order' aspect alone as Assistant District Attourney Carver.  The leads have an undeniable chemistry, which adds to the show greatly. As a Law and Order show, however, it is the stories that make the show. The show stays true to the ""ripped from the headlines"" stories that made the original series so unique, but it broke with tradition by declaring that you would see the crime from the criminal's point of view. Although at first I was a bit skeptical about how this device would turn out, but it actually made the show more complex as seeing the crime would not solve it. Also, the show explored its characters, protagonists and villains alike, in a much more psychological manner than had been consistently done in either of the previous series. Finding out the motive for the crime was often more fascinating than a simple whodunit. This season laid a firm foundation for future seasons but is in itself a worthy buy.Quite simply, this is a show for people who like cultured, sophisticated dramas that challenge them to think about society. It is a show for those who appreciate a good character study and multilayered crime dramas. Above all, though, it is a show for anyone who can enjoy a great yarn and expertly crafted plot twists.",5,The most entertaining and interesting show on television,1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,1905,"['would', 'say', 'Law', 'Order', 'CI', 'doubt', 'best', 'Law', 'Order', 'spinoff', 'always', 'thrill', 'watch', 'Det', 'Robert', 'Goren', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'engage', 'intellectual', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'brilliant', 'twisted', 'killer', 'CI', 'quite', 'simply', 'must', 'see', 'first', 'year', 'had', 'show', 'proving', 'admirably', 'Goren', 'partner', 'Alexandria', 'Eames', 'Katherine', 'Erbe', 'quickly', 'become', 'modern-day', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'duo', 'Goren', 'seemingly', 'omniscient', 'stalwart', 'detective', 'Eames', 'lending', 'lot', 'humanity', 'proceedings', 'Jamey', 'Sheridan', 'Goren', 'Eames', 'CO', 'buttoned-down', 'more', 'traditional', 'cop', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', ""'Order"", 'aspect', 'alone', 'Assistant', 'District', 'Attourney', 'Carver', 'leads', 'have', 'undeniable', 'chemistry', 'show', 'greatly', 'Law', 'Order', 'show', 'however', 'stories', 'make', 'show', 'show', 'true', 'ripped', 'headlines', 'stories', 'made', 'original', 'series', 'so', 'unique', 'broke', 'tradition', 'declaring', 'would', 'see', 'crime', 'criminal', 'point', 'view', 'first', 'was', 'bit', 'skeptical', 'how', 'device', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'actually', 'made', 'show', 'more', 'complex', 'seeing', 'crime', 'would', 'not', 'solve', 'Also', 'show', 'explored', 'characters', 'protagonists', 'villains', 'alike', 'much', 'more', 'psychological', 'manner', 'had', 'been', 'consistently', 'done', 'previous', 'series', 'Finding', 'out', 'motive', 'crime', 'was', 'often', 'more', 'fascinating', 'simple', 'whodunit', 'season', 'laid', 'firm', 'foundation', 'future', 'seasons', 'worthy', 'buy.Quite', 'simply', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'cultured', 'sophisticated', 'dramas', 'challenge', 'think', 'society', 'show', 'who', 'appreciate', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'multilayered', 'crime', 'dramas', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'enjoy', 'great', 'yarn', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'plot', 'twists']",N/A

I must admit that I hadn't seen the show, but had talked to several people who were religious watchers; plus I researched it a little on the net.  The bottom line is that my gamble paid off.  I throroughly enjoyed every single episode.  From the excellent ending of the first episode to the credits of the last, I was hooked.  It was money well spent.  Some people don't enjoy D'onofrio's character, but I think that he is a wonderful take on a modern-day Sherlock Holmes (who WAS quite the know-it-all, if you hadn't noticed).  Plus, there is an interesting back-story to Detective Goren, involving his mentally ill mother.  It makes you more sympathetic and willing to follow the character development.If you are debating on the investment, it's worth it.  The only down side, like the other Law &amp; Order dvd's, is the sad absence of extras.  There is an informative and entertaining featurette, but it's mostly everyone tooting everyone else's horn.

You'll see the police wearing a black tripe over their badge as tribute to their fallen fellow officers. This show follows a separate formula than Law & Order and a is way different than Special Victims Unit. Here you catch a glimpse of what the suspect and in most cases, what the victim was going through leading up to their murder or kidnapping or orchestrated death. Then you see Major Case Squad's Detectives Robert Goren and his senior partner Alex Eames as they try to catch the killer(s). When watching Goren, you feel like you're watching the love child of Sherlock Holmes and Lt. Columbo as you see him find clues and inconsistencies and character traits that we, the audience vaguely notice. This season has episodes going from Eastern European kidnappers to a greedy secretive businessman. A corrupt school cop to a band of diamond thieves. Also Diane Wiest, Jerry Orbach, Jesse L.

768415,A2X17SA4E8V3PU,B0000AVHCD,Bstrassell0001,"[1, 1]","What a shame.....Law & Order: Criminal Intent, in my opinion, is the most fascinating show of the L&O; television series!This lies at not only the depth of the episodes (something we'll get to shortly), but also at the depth of the star character, Vincent D'Onofrio's Detective Robert ""Bobby"" Goren: Detective Goren, growing up, endured more than several tragedies with his schizophrenic mother. As a result, Goren became the underdog, joining New York City's Major Case Squad and becoming, essentially, Sherlock Holmes Jr.! Dick Wolf has admitted that he based Goren off of Holmes and, for a modernized version of Holmes, D'Onofrio is brilliant. Like Holmes; Goren is smart at not only using physical evidence to solve crimes; but also with using psychology to get into the minds of criminals! Watching him sends chills down my spine: Goren, like Denzel Washington's Training Day character, knows how to manipulate criminals with actions and words alike! The major difference, of course, is that Goren has maintained his strength as a good cop; making this fascinating for anyone who liked Training Day and/or Sherlock Holmes.Goren's partner, meanwhile, is Detective Alexandra ""Alex"" Eames (Kathryn Erbe). Erbe and her character are remarkable contributions to the show, D'Onofrio/Goren being given the upper hand but Erbe/Eames serving as a powerful supplement. The two go hand-in-hand like HERO versions of Bonnie and Clyde! Eames, too, is powerful at manipulating criminals and throwing their manipulations, sarcasm, and excuses right back into their faces: for example, reminding a criminal who uses Genesis 22 (where God tested Abraham by telling him to sacrifice his son Issac and then, just as Abraham was about to do it, told him that he was only testing his faith in him) exactly that: that had God justified the killing, he would've made Abraham follow through with the sacrifice!The environments D'Onofrio/Goren and Erbe/Eames are given couldn't be much better, either: unlike the other L&O; shows, Dick Wolf allows viewers to see the crime being investigated take place BEFORE the investigation! From this, we come to see things not just from the perspective of Goren and Eames, but also from the perspectives of the very criminals they're prosecuting! Just like the original L&O; and L&O;: SVU, Wolf and his screenwriters have taken the crime reporting's found on the pages of the NY and LA times and incorporated them into the show (many of the episodes here are reported to have been modeled after real-life incidents.) Several episodes are very disturbing; however; this does not speak for *****all***** of them. Meanwhile, it's important to remind ourselves when we get disturbed by a certain episode (as I did at times) that this is television, not the original NC-17 rated version of GoodFellas (a film edited by Martin Scorsese to receive the proper R rating)!Courtney B. Vance is an excellent addition to L&O;: CI, and if you've never seen his movie Blind Faith with Charles S. Dutton and Kadeem Hardison (available on video only, but available right here on Amazon), I highly recommend it as a supplement. Seeing it before L&O;: CI gave me a deeper appreciation for Vance's contributions to the show: a Good Samaritan himself in real life with deep religious faith, Vance's anger on L&O;: CI never gets beyond righteous and is used not to destroy, but to serve justice to those afflicted by criminals. Jamey Sheridan is another excellent addition: real-life Brooklyn police officers (as we learn from the featurette on L&O;: CI as featured on this six-disc DVD set) have praised his performance not only for his talent, but also for his realism!Awh, yes: Criminal Intent: The Beginning tells of how the show was developed and the creating of the characters: not only as they were written, but also as D'Onofrio, Erbe, and Sheridan (Vance is present here, but covered in less detail) created them with their superb acting talents! L&O;: CI may not have won any Golden Globes (like the original L&O; and L&O;: SVU did), but it takes you to dimensions the other shows never did.A ***must-have*** DVD.Featured are guest appearances from Jerry Orbach, Jesse L. Martin, S. Epatha Merkerson (when they were still on the original L&O;) and, among others, John Heard and Griffin Dunne.",5,This never won any Golden Globes?,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,4299,"['What', 'shame', '..Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'opinion', 'most', 'fascinating', 'show', 'L', 'O', 'television', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'depth', 'episodes', 'something', ""'ll"", 'get', 'shortly', 'also', 'depth', 'star', 'character', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Detective', 'Robert', 'Bobby', 'Goren', 'Detective', 'Goren', 'growing', 'up', 'endured', 'more', 'several', 'tragedies', 'schizophrenic', 'mother', 'result', 'Goren', 'became', 'underdog', 'joining', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Major', 'Case', 'Squad', 'becoming', 'essentially', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Jr.', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'admitted', 'based', 'Goren', 'Holmes', 'modernized', 'version', 'Holmes', ""D'Onofrio"", 'brilliant', 'Holmes', 'Goren', 'smart', 'not', 'only', 'using', 'physical', 'evidence', 'solve', 'crimes', 'also', 'using', 'psychology', 'get', 'minds', 'criminals', 'Watching', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'Goren', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Training', 'Day', 'character', 'how', 'manipulate', 'criminals', 'actions', 'words', 'alike', 'major', 'difference', 'course', 'Goren', 'maintained', 'strength', 'good', 'cop', 'making', 'fascinating', 'anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'Training', 'Day', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes.Goren', 'partner', 'meanwhile', 'Detective', 'Alexandra', 'Alex', 'Eames', 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'Erbe', 'character', 'are', 'remarkable', 'contributions', 'show', ""D'Onofrio/Goren"", 'being', 'given', 'upper', 'hand', 'Erbe/Eames', 'serving', 'powerful', 'supplement', 'two', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'HERO', 'versions', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Eames', 'too', 'powerful', 'manipulating', 'criminals', 'throwing', 'manipulations', 'sarcasm', 'excuses', 'right', 'back', 'example', 'reminding', 'criminal', 'who', 'Genesis', '22', 'where', 'God', 'tested', 'Abraham', 'telling', 'sacrifice', 'son', 'Issac', 'then', 'just', 'Abraham', 'was', 'do', 'told', 'was', 'only', 'testing', 'faith', 'exactly', 'had', 'God', 'justified', 'killing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'Abraham', 'follow', 'sacrifice', 'environments', ""D'Onofrio/Goren"", 'Erbe/Eames', 'are', 'given', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'L', 'O', 'shows', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'viewers', 'see', 'crime', 'being', 'investigated', 'take', 'place', 'investigation', 'come', 'see', 'things', 'not', 'just', 'perspective', 'Goren', 'Eames', 'also', 'perspectives', 'very', 'criminals', ""'re"", 'prosecuting', 'Just', 'original', 'L', 'O', 'L', 'O', 'SVU', 'Wolf', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'taken', 'crime', 'reporting', 'found', 'pages', 'NY', 'LA', 'times', 'incorporated', 'show', 'many', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'reported', 'have', 'been', 'modeled', 'real-life', 'incidents', 'Several', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'disturbing', 'however', 'not', 'speak', '*****all*****', 'Meanwhile', 'important', 'remind', 'when', 'get', 'disturbed', 'certain', 'episode', 'did', 'times', 'television', 'not', 'original', 'NC-17', 'rated', 'version', 'GoodFellas', 'film', 'edited', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'receive', 'proper', 'R', 'rating', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'excellent', 'addition', 'L', 'O', 'CI', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'Blind', 'Faith', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'available', 'video', 'only', 'available', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon', 'highly', 'recommend', 'supplement', 'Seeing', 'L', 'O', 'CI', 'gave', 'deeper', 'appreciation', 'Vance', 'contributions', 'show', 'Good', 'Samaritan', 'real', 'life', 'deep', 'religious', 'faith', 'Vance', 'anger', 'L', 'O', 'CI', 'never', 'righteous', 'used', 'not', 'destroy', 'serve', 'justice', 'afflicted', 'criminals', 'Jamey', 'Sheridan', 'excellent', 'addition', 'real-life', 'Brooklyn', 'police', 'officers', 'learn', 'featurette', 'L', 'O', 'CI', 'featured', 'six-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'praised', 'performance', 'not', 'only', 'talent', 'also', 'realism', 'Awh', 'yes', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'Beginning', 'tells', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'developed', 'creating', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'were', 'written', 'also', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Erbe', 'Sheridan', 'Vance', 'present', 'here', 'covered', 'less', 'detail', 'created', 'superb', 'acting', 'talents', 'L', 'O', 'CI', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'original', 'L', 'O', 'L', 'O', 'SVU', 'did', 'dimensions', 'other', 'shows', 'never', 'did.A', '***must-have***', 'DVD.Featured', 'are', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'original', 'L', 'O', 'others', 'John', 'Heard', 'Griffin', 'Dunne']",N/A
768416,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0000AVHCD,calvinnme,"[6, 9]","I thought that the first season had the most interesting cases of all of the seasons, although I've loved all of them so far, even when they added Chris Noth to the line-up and started alternating detective teams. I really love D'Onofrio as quirky ""Renaissance Man"" detective Goren - it's a side we never saw of him when he played an ""Edgar Suit"" in ""Men in Black"". He is truly a unique character among TV detectives, seeming to linger in that gray area between genius and insanity. The show employs a heavy dramatic irony - the detectives track down people the viewer already knows are guilty - which makes it substantially different from the other two L&O;'s, as well as most law/cop/justice/detective shows. I have only two real knocks against the lay-out of the show. First, in this L&O; spin-off, like in SVU, there is very little time spent in the courtroom. The legal maneuverings usually involve getting search warrants and the like - there are no dramatic trials. ADA Carver is a bit too much like SVU's ADA Cabot: smart, sharp, and good-looking, but ultimately without a lot to do. No wonder Courtney B. Vance (ADA Carver) eventually wanted to leave the show because he thought his character didn't have enough to do.The second problem I have with this show is that Eames is not Goren's equal partner. Goren does all of the work and Eames just stands around being eye candy. Goren might as well tell Eames, at the beginning of each episode, ""Go over there and stare at that potted plant while I solve the crime."" It would be more honest. Imagine how the original L&O; would have been received if Lenny Briscoe had done all of the heavy lifting and detective work for 12 years while detectives Logan, Curtis, and Green respectively sat around, got coffee, and acted as Lenny's chauffeur!Finally, to whoever is making the decision on releasing the DVD sets of this show: Get a move on!

768417,A2DHRMLMH46C83,B0000AVHCD,Cyn,"[7, 7]","A six disc box set, 22 eps and a special feature of Criminal Intent.  It seems too good to be true - but fear not people, it's right here.  And it's glorious.Television can be so cruel that it will re-run Seinfeld episodes every weekday, have Everybody Loves Raymond on at least three times in a five day period, and offer nothing better than a double episode of the OC ... then make you wait A WHOLE WEEK in between Criminal Intent episodes.  I tell you, in some countries it's illegal, it has to be!  Is there no mercy at all???Mercy has arrived in a blue box, with four of the coolest cop show cast members since Starsky and Hutch.  And they don't even need a rockin' car to make you want to watch every episode one after the other without stopping for breath.  Of course everyone initially watches Criminal Intent for Vincent D'Onofrio's unhinged Goren, but you become enamoured with the rest of the cast very quickly.  Katherine Erbe is on fire with her one-liners and sharp tongue, Courtney B.

768438,A50W7ZVTG606,B0000AVHCD,"Naomi Tilley ""Story Buff""","[12, 12]","As one less than praising reviewer commented about most positive reviewers of Law & Order: Criminal Intent, I am already biased in my review of this show, because I am a die-hard fan. And Lord Almighty, do I ever love this show. Just to get the gushing out of the way right now - it is, without a doubt, my favourite show on tv at the moment.Unfortunately I was not lucky enough to catch Criminal Intent right from the beginning. Having seen episodes of both the original Law & Order, and Law & Order: SVU, I wasn't at all interested when Law & Order: CI came to our screens in Australia. More fool me. I watched the show one night with my parents purely because there was nothing else on and I couldn't be bothered choosing a video to watch. I couldn't get over the quirky character of Goren, and found myself tuning in each week until I was well and truly hooked.Another reviewer said it, and they were right - you either love Goren or you hate him. There is no in-between.D'Onofrio's bizarre character got me hooked on CI, but I love it now for a much broader spectrum of things.Criminal Intent is not the most original cop show that has ever been on TV, but it is definitely one of the most entertaining - depending on your own preferences, of course. And where the two previous Law & Order franchises have been ensemble casts, this is the first show that has relied so heavily on the performance of one actor to hold things together.Also, from a completely personal point of view, I like the fact that Criminal Intent for the most part stays away from the courtroom. My greatest frustration with SVU was that more often than not they seemed to lose their cases once it went to court. There is no such frustration with CI. Whether or not Goren and Eames get their man (or woman), the show very rarely moves into the vicinity of courtroom drama. Consequently, 98% of the time the outcome of the show is more than satisfying.First and foremost (naturally) there is Vincent D'Onofrio as Detective Bobby Goren. (I like to imagine that perhaps he was named after his father - `Robert Goren Jr', or something similar - because I have yet to meet any man called Robert, who prefers to be known as `Bobby')It has been absolutely fascinating to watch the character develop over the three seasons that the show has been running. Where, in the first season, Goren was something of an enigma, in the second and third seasons we have gradually been given a look-see into his psyche. Indeed, the fact of his mother's schizophrenia and his father walking out on them when he was only a child have served to be interesting catalysts for confrontations with suspects - most particularly, the episodes with Nicole Wallace/Elizabeth Hitchens.Goren gives me the impression of a man who, knowing his mother's condition and knowing that schizophrenia is hereditary, is constantly teetering on the brink of that same mental illness. All his quirks and odd mannerisms, his phenomenal range of knowledge and his extraordinary intelligence are all signs of a man who runs the very real risk of a complete mental and emotional breakdown.Kathryn Erbe is absolutely brilliant as Goren's partner, Detective Alex Eames. At first glance it might appear that she is little more than a shadow to Goren's all-encompassing presence, but that couldn't be further from the truth. It is more obvious in some episodes, but throughout the show, Eames is constantly the stabiliser to Goren's eccentricities. They are such complete opposites, and yet they are a perfect match for each other.Bobby Goren is a great cop, but that is only the case because he has Alex Eames for a partner. This was particularly obvious in the third season episodes, during which Kathryn Erbe was on maternity leave. Whilst Samantha Buck did a reasonable job, it just wasn't the same. It seemed that the character of Bishop spent most of the time trailling around behind Goren like a lost puppy, who was never quite sure of where she was supposed to be. Not that this was surprising. It was summed up quite aptly in an early episode when, after Eames had announced her surrogate pregnancy and Goren wondered who his interim partner would be, Eames commented rather blithely, 'I pity the poor soul'. Too true.Though it isn't always made blatantly obvious, it would have to be clear to anyone who pays attention that Goren and Eames know some fairly intimate details about each other's lives. It is partly due to this that their partnership works so well. This was what was lacking in the Goren/Bishop partnership of the third season. She knew next to nothing about the man she was working with, and constantly regarded him as a difficulty to be tolerated only until she could move on to better things. He, on the other hand, found himself in a bind more than once without Eames, and sorely missing her presence.Goren's anger and frustration at not having Eames there to counter-balance him was very real, and only showed just how good they are together.

What made me pause to watch, was this tall scruffy faced man leaning sideways trying to catch the eye of a man sitting down. My First thought; &quot;What the heck&quot;? At first the scruffy looking guy (Vincent D'Onofrio) gave me the creeps as I watched him invade this other guys personal space.  Judging by the eyes of the man sitting at the interrogation table, i would say that he more than likely felt the same way (as an actor). It isn't often a television character can become so 3 dimensional to the audience and for that reason alone I finished watching the show. Its facinating to see these detectives solve these ~major case files using: Psychology, Manipulation, Inductive as well as Deductive investigational techniques. What is perhaps more intriguing still is Goren's(D'Onofrio) 'Mensa-like' recall capacity. I sit and ponder this characters life and all that has shaped him. It should be equally noted that without the witty counter-balance of Alex ~Eames (Kathryn Erbe), the character of Goren would not work nearly as well. The acting is great, the writing is smart, and the show deserves the recognition it has earned. I am pleased to see intelligent programming on televison.
