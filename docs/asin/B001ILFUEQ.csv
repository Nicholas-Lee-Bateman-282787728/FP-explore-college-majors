1204592,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001ILFUEQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 7]","An entertaining family film featuring Pooh, Tigger, Darby and gang!  A film with fun music but also a DVD that is enjoyable and educational! Definitely recommended!""Tigger & Pooh and a Musical Too"" is the second film based on the popular Walt Disney 3D animated television series ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh"" shown during the Disney Channel's Playhouse Disney block.Welcome to the Hundred Acre Wood picnic.  Everyone from Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, Eeyore, Piglet and the gang and also Darby and her dog Buster are having a great time at the picnic.The group is so happy with Rabbit accomplishing much with the organization and planning of the picnic that he unanimously is appointed the Mayor.But things quickly change in Hundred Acre Wood as Rabbit takes the job of Mayor to the point where each animal has a schedule they must follow including dozens upon dozens of rules that they are not to break.For example, Tigger who loves to bounce, can't bounce until a certain time.  Characters have to sleep at a certain time and people must do everything that the Rabbit has set in their schedule.But this quickly starts to annoy everyone and sure enough, Tigger is the first to rebel and thus to settle things, Rabbit and Tigger divide the Hundred Acre Wood with a white line.  Those that stay in the side of the Rabbit must follow his rules, while those who live on the side of Tigger must follow their rules.  But to make things worse, each animal must choose a side of who they want to follow, and thus the problems at Hundred Acre Wood start to increase.""Tigger & Pooh and a Musical Too"" is an enjoyable film featuring songs that are exactly like a musical and are quite fun to sing a long too.To make things much more enjoyable on DVD, there are three ways to watch the film.  Alone by itself, Sing-Along version in which the film becomes like karaoke during the musical segments and then there is ""active play"" which people can learn from the film by two ways.  Interactive with a remote or a narrated active version which requires no remote but the film changes during certain scenes where it becomes an educational-based film in which the viewer needs to figure out the answer to a question.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Tigger & Pooh and a Musical Too"" is a fun 3D animated film which is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) and mtches the style of animation featured on the Disney Playhouse TV series ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh"".  The animation is colorful and cute and quite adorable for children and families.The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and with the film being a musical, the songs are in a musical style of format and sound quite good on your front/central channel speakers.  In fact, the music comes alive during the musical.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Tigger & Pooh and a Musical Too"" comes with few special features:* Rabbit's ""Think Think Think Theatre"" Game - The game is a CG based game hosted by Rabbit.  This game allows a child to select a song using the DVD remote control and selecting a background image in which the viewer can use the remote to paint the background correctly and add additional props.* Playing Modes - Aside from watching the film standalone or with the ""Sing Along"", you can also selected ""ACTIVE PLAY"" which a child can watch the film but participate in the action without any assistance from an adult or the operaton of a remote.  For ""INTERACTIVE PLAY"", this requires a remote and a child can interact with the program.* Music & More - Sing Along with the Movie - The ability to watch the film with the karaoke subtitles during the musical.  The colors light up during each word sung.* Kenny Loggins Music Video ""Underneat the Same Sky"" - A music video featuring Kenny Loggins and as someone who grew up with Kenny Loggins, the guy looks and sounds fantastic as he did back in the 70's and 80's.JUDGMENT CALL:Like many parents, for so many decades, we grew up with Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger.  And for our children now, they are growing up with a 3D animated version of the characters and with DVD technology, this entertaining film/musical gets a humongous thumbs up for its educational use of ""ACTIVE PLAY"" and ""INTERACTIVE PLAY"" in order to get the children involved.When watching this film with our child, my wife and I thought the songs were so catchy and fun and granted it helps that the DVD does include the ""Sing Along"" to make things much more fun and enjoyable, it's really hard to go wrong with this DVD.If I had to nitpick of what I wish was on the DVD, I suppose that with the seven original songs, similar to what Disney has done with their ""High School Musical"" releases, having a song breakdown in the special features, so parents can automatically select those songs immediately.But that's having to nitpick, because really, there's nothing bad about this DVD, it's actually a wonderful children's film and fun musical that is educational and most of all, enjoyable for both children and their parents.Overall, ""Tigger & Pooh and a Musical Too"" is a DVD that I highly recommend for parents to purchase for their children.",5,Enjoyable with its catchy music but also a DVD that is fun and educational!,1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,5078,"['entertaining', 'family', 'film', 'featuring', 'Pooh', 'Tigger', 'Darby', 'gang', 'film', 'fun', 'music', 'also', 'DVD',

1204594,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B001ILFUEQ,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[1, 1]","""My Friends Tigger & Pooh: Tigger & Pooh and a Musical Too"" is the second film release for the program ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh"" and possibly the series's last hurrah, now that it's been canceled by Disney. The film begins with the residents of the Hundred Acre Wood enjoying a ""Best Friends Picnic."" But when they make Rabbit the Mayor of the Hundred Acre Wood to thank him for being such a great organizer, Rabbit lets power go to his head and creates ""Just a Few Simple Rules"" that end up causing division. Tigger challenges Rabbit for mayorhood and a Big White Line is drawn, dividing the Wood! Darby & Buster, as non-residents, are trapped in the middle of the fight and Piglet is even worse off-- the line's been drawn right through the center of his home!I award the film about three-and-half to four stars for story overall. My main complaints were that:A.) It feels a bit too much like a reprise of the 2004 film ""Springtime with Roo,"" in which everyone was upset with Rabbit after he created a bunch of rules about Easter. (As with that film, Rabbit is not featured on the cover of this one.)B.) Darby plays somewhat of a minimal role and I wasn't entirely satisfied with how things are solved.But these are minor complaints. That's a lot of good humor in the film, particularly involving scenes where Tigger follows around Rabbit like a little lost puppy after he takes away his bouncing, and also when Beaver is trying to shout stuff over a megaphone and Rabbit keeps having to stop him. (To name just a couple examples.)They really went all out on the music with this one, ranging from humorous songs such as Tigger's ""Password Song"" (""framunkel pie-- I'm runnin' outta words to try!"") to Kenny Loggins's tender ""Underneath the Same Sky"" and the lovely end title piece ""Together Again."" Musically, the film is wonderful, though I'm not sure exactly how much of a ""musical"" it is.This film was aired on television on Playhouse Disney just a few days after it was released on DVD. Which may lead some to wonder why it would be worth their time to get the DVD. Well, I can assure you, the DVD is worth it. For one thing, the DVD release is presented in widescreen 1:78:1, whereas the TV airing was presented in ""formatted to fit your screen"" size. The DVD also includes two alternate language tracks-- French and Spanish. Kenny Loggins performs in a music video of ""Underneath the Same Sky,"" featuring a more up-tempo version of the song than that featured in the film, including harmonica riffs and Kenny Loggin dancing and singing with the characters. It's really quite fun. Also included are two new ways to view the film-- Active Play and Interactive Play. The Active Play lets viewers play along with the film without having to use the remote or controller, while the Interactive Play includes a series of games interspersed throughout the film.If you've only seen it on TV, don't let the DVD pass you (or your children), by.",5,"All-Out, Musical Final Hoorah for MFT&P!",1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,2941,"['Friends', 'Tigger', 'Pooh', 'Tigger', 'Pooh', 'Musical', 'Too', 'second', 'film', 'release', 'program', 'Friends', 'Tigger', 'Pooh', 'possibly', 'series', 'last', 'hurrah', 'now', 'been', 'canceled', 'Disney', 'film', 'residents', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'enjoying', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Picnic', 'when', 'make', 'Rabbit', 'Mayor', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'thank', 'being', 'such', 'great', 'organizer', 'Rabbit', 'power', 'go', 'head', 'Just', 'Few', 'Simple', 'Rules', 'end', 'up', 'causing', 'division', 'Tigger', 'Rabbit', 'mayorhood', 'Big', 'White', 'Line', 'drawn', 'dividing', 'Wood', 'Darby', 'Buster', 'non-residents', 'are', 'trapped', 'middle', 'fight', 'Piglet', 'even', 'worse', 'off', 'line', 'been', 'drawn', 'right', 'center', 'home', 'award', 'film', 'three-and-half', 'four', 'stars', 'story', 'overall', 'main', 'complaints', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'reprise', '2004', 'film', 'Springtime', 'Roo', 'everyone', 'was', 'upset', 'Rabbit', 'created', 'bunch', 'rules', 'Easter', 'film', 'Rabbit', 'not', 'featured', 'cover', 'one.', 'B', 'Darby', 'somewhat', 'minimal', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'satisfied', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'solved.But', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'lot', 'good', 'humor', 'film', 'particularly', 'involving', 'scenes', 'where', 'Tigger', 'around', 'Rabbit', 'little', 'lost', 'puppy', 'away', 'bouncing', 'also', 'when', 'Beaver', 'trying', 'shout', 'stuff', 'megaphone', 'Rabbit', 'having', 'stop', 'name', 'just', 'couple', 'examples', 'really', 'went', 'out', 'music', 'one', 'ranging', 'humorous', 'songs', 'such', 'Tigger', 'Password', 'Song', 'framunkel', 'pie', ""'m"", 'runnin', 'outta', 'words', 'try', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'tender', 'Same', 'Sky', 'lovely', 'end', 'title', 'piece', 'Together', 'Again', 'Musically', 'film', 'wonderful', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', 'musical', 'film', 'was', 'aired', 'television', 'Playhouse', 'Disney', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'Which', 'may', 'lead', 'wonder', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'get', 'DVD', 'Well', 'can', 'assure', 'DVD', 'one', 'thing', 'DVD', 'release', 'presented', 'widescreen', '1:78:1', 'whereas', 'TV', 'airing', 'was', 'presented', 'formatted', 'fit', 'screen', 'size', 'DVD', 'also', 'two', 'alternate', 'language', 'tracks', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Kenny', 'performs', 'music', 'video', 'Same', 'Sky', 'featuring', 'more', 'up-tempo', 'version', 'song', 'featured', 'film', 'including', 'harmonica', 'riffs', 'Kenny', 'Loggin', 'dancing', 'singing', 'characters', 'really', 'quite', 'fun', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'two', 'new', 'ways', 'view', 'film', 'Active', 'Play', 'Interactive', 'Play', 'Active', 'Play', 'viewers', 'play', 'along', 'film', 'having', 'use', 'remote', 'controller', 'Interactive', 'Play', 'series', 'games', 'interspersed', 'film.If', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'DVD', 'pass', 'children']",N/A

1204596,AZYDWA8MSNUMR,B001ILFUEQ,Patrick King,"[9, 9]","Our two year old is fascinated with all things Tigger & Pooh, so this was on our must buy list. While she doesn't yet understand all the things being said in the cartoon series, she does enjoy the music and watching the activity on the screen.  This DVD didn't disappoint in that respect. She was quite pleased and spent a lot of time dancing around during the musical interludes.  What was surprising to me is that my wife and I also enjoyed the plot !To reiterate, and I'm going to have fun with this,  Rabbit is honorarily appointed Mayor of the Hundred Acre Wood as a goodwill gesture for his organizational skills. Rabbit being Rabbit, he immediately lets this go to his head and, apparently taking a cue from history, turns himself into a supreme leader in the style of Kim Jong Ill and other great dictators in history.  Indeed, during one song, he makes reference to making the trains run on time ( if the Wood had any ); a veiled nod to Benito Mussolini. Poor Eeyor is the only one to initially see the truth, but it begins to dawn on the rest of the inhabitants just what a monster they have created as Supreme Leader Rabbit introduces a series of strict laws that must be obeyed; everything from limiting Tigger's jump time, to restricting Pooh's honey intake. Everything has to be done on a strict timetable dictated solely by Rabbit.  While the rest of the characters take a rather pacifistic approach to Rabbit's oppression, Tigger begins a little insurgency in his own special way which leads to an angry confrontation with Rabbit.  Rabbit then, in a spate of sheer evil ( you can see it written all over his face as he makes the desicion ) , has the 100 Acre Wood divided in half by a line, a'la 1961 Berlin.  Tigger is given control of, in my take on it, the ""west"", while Rabbit retains an iron grip on his ""eastblock"" dictatorship with the help of his newly appointed sycophant, Beaver. Rabbit's ""utopia"" is without freedom; he monitors the actions of all the residents on his side.  While Darby and Buster can travel freely, Rabbit allows no one else to cross the border from either side, even going so far as to assign Beaver the role of Border Guard.  He cuts off free trade, thus dooming the inhabitants of his side to slow starvation ( poor Eeyor ) as most of the food is on Tigger's side of the Wood.  His subjects on this isolated side of the Wood begin to fall into a deep depression brought on by hunger, constant monitoring, and not being able to see their friends on the other side of the line.  Rabbit decides to improve morale with a picnic and music ( I almost thought he was going to broadcast some ""patriotic music"" akin to what the North Koreans claim they are broadcasting from their non-existant satellite they supposedly fired into orbit earlier this week ).  The picnic is a bit of a bust since there is no food, which drives Darby to finally act.  She creates an incident to draw both sides to reconciliation by having Buster go ""missing""( he's really just hiding ), thus forcing both sides to come together in the search.  Once together they realize how much they miss each other and Rabbit releases his grip on the others, has Beaver ""tear down the wall"" and everything's back to normal.Or is it?  Having seen the dark depths of Rabbit's soul, I wonder if any of the others can truly trust him again.  Personally I think he and Beaver should be arrested and brought before the Hague to face trial for crimes against their own people.  Perhaps they'll be a sequel.OK seriously, it's a fun movie for kids and has enough of a plot to keep Mom and Dad involved as well.
