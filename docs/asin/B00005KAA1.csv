Good women are hard to find in television, and its even harder to find a female protaganist (whose show is named after her) who is not more interested in alcohol than food, sex than her career, fashion than family. I urge Acorn to release the entire Bramwell series on DVD. My local library has an incomplete video collection and I and my friends are eager to purchase the series for ourselves.
