The print that I received was not good as it pixilated parts of Bo to keep it 'R' rated instead of the unrated version I expected.  In this film, Bo achieves utter perfection (physically) though her acting is as weak as ever.  If you wish to see perfection of that type, then buy this film.  If you actually want a coherent script, then look elsewhere.  The story is convuluted and extremely confusing.  In the end, man or woman, you will sit back and admire Bo and turn off the sound entirely.",4,Perfect movie let down by an imperfect print,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,581,"['liked', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'then', 'must', 'get', 'print', 'received', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'pixilated', 'parts', 'Bo', 'keep', 'R', 'rated', 'instead', 'unrated', 'version', 'expected', 'film', 'Bo', 'utter', 'perfection', 'physically', 'acting', 'as', 'weak', 'ever', 'wish', 'see', 'perfection', 'type', 'then', 'buy', 'film', 'actually', 'want', 'coherent', 'script', 'then', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'story', 'convuluted', 'extremely', 'confusing', 'end', 'man', 'woman', 'will', 'sit', 'back', 'admire', 'Bo', 'turn', 'off', 'sound', 'entirely']",N/A
