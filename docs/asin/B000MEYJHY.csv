The best thing in this movie was the orginal clips,tapes, coverage of RFK and also how they were interwined with the footage shot today, but that is where the good reviews stop.  They tried to have to many famous people involved in the film and they jumped around to much from each person who in the end didn't matter anymore than they did at the start of the film.  It might have been better if they had followed up with the people after the death of RFK.  But there was a lack in the content of the script as well.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone except to watch the clips of RFK and listen to his speeches and to fast forward through the rest of it.  The acting was terrible except for Martin Sheen, Jay Hernandez, Shia LaBeof and the other guy who was with him the whole movie.  So if you want to see great footage of RFK and hear good speeches then those parts would be benefical but the rest of the film is a pure waste of time",2,"Good idea, but lacking",1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,1020,"['movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'fell', 'short', 'finishing', 'line', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'orginal', 'clips', 'tapes', 'coverage', 'RFK', 'also', 'how', 'were', 'interwined', 'footage', 'shot', 'today', 'where', 'good', 'reviews', 'stop', 'tried', 'have', 'many', 'famous', 'people', 'involved', 'film', 'jumped', 'much', 'person', 'who', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anymore', 'did', 'start', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'followed', 'up', 'people', 'death', 'RFK', 'was', 'lack', 'content', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'watch', 'clips', 'RFK', 'listen', 'speeches', 'fast', 'forward', 'rest', 'acting', 'was', 'terrible', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'Shia', 'LaBeof', 'other', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'whole', 'movie', 'So', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'footage', 'RFK', 'hear', 'good', 'speeches', 'then', 'parts', 'would', 'be', 'benefical', 'rest', 'film', 'pure', 'waste', 'time']",N/A
1045202,A20HNT8HYIYY0X,B000MEYJHY,"Adrian Stranik ""Ade""","[3, 4]","The 1960's was a golden age for assassins - beginning in '63 with civil rights leader Medgar Evers getting it in the back and culminating in '68 with yet another instalment in the curse of the Kennedy's with the gunning down of Robert F. If you imagine that the JFK shooting five years earlier is the Beatles of assassinations then RFK's is probably The Small Faces; nowhere near the scale or impact of the earlier act but still had a resonance that shook the decade that followed and can still be felt to this day.Affectionately remembered as BOBBY in this Emilio Estevez directorial debut Robert F. Kennedy appears in actual news footage leading up to his date with destiny at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at the hands of a simpleton named Shiran Shiran. Around this historical event Estevez weaves a tale of twenty two guests of the hotel at which Kennedy is to give his fateful last speech in the build up to the California Primary elections. Because the story follows no one character in particular the film has the episodic feel of a soap; but even then the stories rarely involve each other and the strands are only tied up a the end when they all wind up in the pantry when the bullets start to fly - which is fair enough if that is how it went down - but it appears that, apart from the assassin himself, all the characters here are fictional which kind of makes a mockery of the end title telling us that all the other people who were injured in the shooting survived. How did they manage that when they never existed in the first place? Even the iconographic shot of `Bus Boy' Juan Romero leaning over the dying senator has, here, been rendered as the fictional Jose Rojas.The myriad characters in question are played by a veritable smorgasbord of A-listers. Sharon Stone and Demi Moore's scenes together are an enjoyable joust, as a beautician who's had her day and a whiskey soaked diva respectively. Less interesting, however, is Anthony Hopkins and Harry Bellefonte's yawn-fest as a pair of old retired doormen who spend their time (for reasons unexplained) hanging about the hotel playing chess and talking about knocking on. Haven't you two got homes to go to?Lacking the creeping tension of Oliver Stone's gloriously overblown JFK, BOBBY leaves you with the sense of a dashed hope; that this senator, appearing as he did among an endless litany of political clowns, gangsters, charlatans and fools, could have really made a difference and may, just, have been the leader he pretended to be.",2,"""Waiter, there's a hollow point in my soup...""",1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,2515,"['1960', 'was', 'golden', 'age', 'assassins', 'beginning', ""'63"", 'civil', 'rights', 'leader', 'Medgar', 'Evers', 'getting', 'back', 'culminating', ""'68"", 'yet', 'instalment', 'curse', 'Kennedy', 'gunning', 'Robert', 'F.', 'imagine', 'JFK', 'shooting', 'five', 'years', 'earlier', 'Beatles', 'assassinations', 'then', 'RFK', 'probably', 'Small', 'Faces', 'nowhere', 'scale', 'impact', 'earlier', 'act', 'still', 'had', 'resonance', 'shook', 'decade', 'followed', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'felt', 'day.Affectionately', 'remembered', 'BOBBY', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'actual', 'news', 'footage', 'leading', 'up', 'date', 'destiny', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'hands', 'simpleton', 'named', 'Shiran', 'Shiran', 'historical', 'event', 'Estevez', 'tale', 'twenty', 'two', 'guests', 'hotel', 'Kennedy', 'give', 'fateful', 'last', 'speech', 'build', 'up', 'California', 'Primary', 'elections', 'story', 'one', 'character', 'particular', 'film', 'episodic', 'feel', 'soap', 'even', 'then', 'stories', 'rarely', 'involve', 'other', 'strands', 'are', 'only', 'tied', 'up', 'end', 'when', 'wind', 'up', 'pantry', 'when', 'bullets', 'start', 'fly', 'fair', 'enough', 'how', 'went', 'down', 'apart', 'assassin', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'fictional', 'kind', 'mockery', 'end', 'title', 'telling', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'injured', 'shooting', 'survived', 'How', 'did', 'manage', 'when', 'never', 'existed', 'first', 'place', 'Even', 'iconographic', 'shot', 'Bus', 'Boy', 'Juan', 'Romero', 'leaning', 'dying', 'senator', 'here', 'been', 'rendered', 'fictional', 'Jose', 'Rojas.The', 'myriad', 'characters', 'question', 'are', 'played', 'veritable', 'smorgasbord', 'A-listers', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'joust', 'beautician', 'who', 'had', 'day', 'whiskey', 'soaked', 'diva', 'respectively', 'Less', 'interesting', 'however', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Harry', 'Bellefonte', 'yawn-fest', 'pair', 'old', 'retired', 'doormen', 'who', 'spend', 'time', 'reasons', 'unexplained', 'hanging', 'hotel', 'playing', 'chess', 'talking', 'knocking', 'Have', ""n't"", 'two', 'got', 'homes', 'go', 'Lacking', 'creeping', 'tension', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'gloriously', 'overblown', 'JFK', 'BOBBY', 'sense', 'dashed', 'hope', 'senator', 'appearing', 'did', 'endless', 'litany', 'political', 'clowns', 'gangsters', 'charlatans', 'fools', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'made', 'difference', 'may', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'leader', 'pretended', 'be']",N/A

Macy, Ashton Kutcher, Laurence Fishburne, Freddy Rodriguez, Christian Slater, Heather Graham, Anthony Hopkins, and Estevz himself. What the film fails to deliver is the life and legacy of Bobby.

1045204,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B000MEYJHY,AIROLF,"[1, 2]","The cast in Bobby is superb; just when you think the list of who's who couldn't get any longer, a few more celebs show up.Most notable is the filmaking - the skill that went into incorporating the real-life footage of Robert F. Kennedy and the actual movie is impressive. The feel of the film and the shading are very similar to the 1968 footage of RFK's campaign, making a virtually indistinguishable quilt of truth and fiction.The most stunning performance is delivered by Lindsay Lohan as Diane, a girl who decides to marry William (Elijah Wood) to save him from dying in Vietnam. The movie was directed artfully. Although it reveals my incompetence and ignorance, I must reveal that I thought this movie was directed by Oliver Stone. It wasn't until the credits when Emilio Estevez's name appears under both director and writer that it sunk in why the cast included his father, Martin Sheen, and Demi Moore, a fellow Brat Pack member, among others. Estevez himself, cast as Demi Moore's unhappy husband, makes an appearance that's a few moments longer than a cameo. Every day Estevez looks more and more like his father and with that mustache he looks even more so.The most disappointing performance is delivered by a waif-like Helen Hunt who shamelessly recycles her As Good as it Gets performance. Although that performance was wonderful, won her an Oscar, etc, it does nothing but annoy here; in fact, when she is one of the victims at the hotel, you don't feel bad about her injuries.There's the unfortunate coincidence (it feels too trite) of having a character named Nelson, which threw this reviewer into thinking about the only other Nelson she knows - Nelson Mandela, which proved to be confusing and distracting. What's Nelson Mandela doing at RFK's California Primary speech when he is siting in prison?The suspense for the attack at the Ambassador Hotel is excellent. At the beginning of the movie the multiple storylines feel strenuous and convoluted, but at the end it all becomes crystal clear.Overall, the movie is an interesting weaving of politics and entertainment. The movie consists of a web of issues concerning the issues that bothered the nation then and that are still prevalent now: war, environment, the draft, racism, substance abuse, feeling of despair, adultery, feeling of belonging, getting laid off, etc.).It might not be the front runner for most awards, but it's a solid movie based on a historical event.",3,Despite Talented Filmmaking Bobby Falls a Few Votes Short,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,2444,"['cast', 'Bobby', 'superb', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'list', 'who', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'longer', 'few', 'more', 'celebs', 'show', 'up.Most', 'notable', 'filmaking', 'skill', 'went', 'incorporating', 'real-life', 'footage', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'actual', 'movie', 'impressive', 'feel', 'film', 'shading', 'are', 'very', 'similar', '1968', 'footage', 'RFK', 'campaign', 'making', 'virtually', 'indistinguishable', 'quilt', 'truth', 'fiction.The', 'most', 'stunning', 'performance', 'delivered', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Diane', 'girl', 'who', 'marry', 'William', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'save', 'dying', 'Vietnam', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'artfully', 'incompetence', 'ignorance', 'must', 'reveal', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'was', ""n't"", 'credits', 'when', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'name', 'director', 'writer', 'why', 'cast', 'included', 'father', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'fellow', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'member', 'others', 'Estevez', 'cast', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'unhappy', 'husband', 'appearance', 'few', 'moments', 'longer', 'cameo', 'day', 'Estevez', 'more', 'more', 'father', 'mustache', 'even', 'more', 'so.The', 'most', 'disappointing', 'performance', 'delivered', 'waif-like', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'who', 'shamelessly', 'As', 'Good', 'performance', 'performance', 'was', 'wonderful', 'won', 'Oscar', 'etc', 'nothing', 'annoy', 'here', 'fact', 'when', 'one', 'victims', 'hotel', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bad', 'injuries.There', 'unfortunate', 'coincidence', 'too', 'trite', 'having', 'character', 'named', 'Nelson', 'threw', 'reviewer', 'thinking', 'only', 'other', 'Nelson', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'proved', 'be', 'confusing', 'distracting', 'What', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'doing', 'RFK', 'California', 'Primary', 'speech', 'when', 'siting', 'prison', 'suspense', 'attack', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'excellent', 'beginning', 'movie', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'feel', 'strenuous', 'convoluted', 'end', 'crystal', 'clear.Overall', 'movie', 'interesting', 'weaving', 'politics', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'web', 'issues', 'concerning', 'issues', 'bothered', 'nation', 'then', 'are', 'still', 'prevalent', 'now', 'war', 'environment', 'draft', 'racism', 'substance', 'abuse', 'feeling', 'despair', 'adultery', 'feeling', 'belonging', 'getting', 'laid', 'off', 'etc', '.It', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'front', 'runner', 'most', 'awards', 'solid', 'movie', 'based', 'historical', 'event']",N/A
1045205,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B000MEYJHY,Andrew Desmond,"[6, 7]","""Bobby"" is an enthralling film.  It moves at a languid pace.  We are gradually introduced to a large ensemble cast of characters who are not related to each other except that they are all in the Ambassador Hotel on the night that Bobby Kennedy is assassinated.  The film's final scenes, although we all know the outcome, are gripping.  It is a great climax to a very professional film.Emilio Estevez who both wrote the screen play and directed the film has brought together a large and eclectic cast including Anthony Hopkins, Harry Belafonte, Demi Moore, Helen Hunt, Sharon Stone and Martin Sheen.  Indeed, he even finds a role for himself as the husband to the drunk and declining Virginia Fallon (Demi Moore).  Although each set of characters has a story to tell, they do not know of each other but are all in the Ambassador Hotel on the night that Bobby Kennedy so famously claimed victory in the California primary in 1968.  As to Bobby Kennedy, no actor plays his role.  We see him only in news film of the time which is cleverly interspersed into Estevez's plot or timeline.The d&eacute;nouement to the film is brilliant.  In a time when security is clearly less intense than it is today in modern America, the kitchen to the hotel is packed with people when Sirhan Sirhan steps from the throng to kill Kennedy and injure several more.  Against the backdrop of recordings from the event, we are brought back to 1968 as we relive the tragic events of that 4 June evening.Yes, we all know the sequence of events of that auspicious day.

Robert Kennedy was murdered by a lone gunman in the kitchen of L.A.'s Ambassador Hotel.Most of the film is vignettes of a number of people and what they did in the hours preceding this event. These range from the mildly interesting to the inane, to clumsy attempts at social commentary via the actions of those involved.In a plot device similar but inferior toGRAND HOTEL(1932), a constant shuffle of scenarios has us meeting and spending time with:*An aging, alcoholic nightclub/Vegas entertainer (Demi Moore) and her long-suffering husband/manager (Emilio Estevez, this film's writer/director).*A young lady (Lindsay Lohan) who at 9 pm is marrying a guy she barely knows (Elijah Wood), just to keep him from being shipped to Vietnam.*Married socialite/campaign donors (Martin Sheen and Helen Hunt) who must at the last minute shop for black shoes when she forgets to pack a pair.*The Ambassador's kitchen chief (Christian Slater), a bigot abusive to the Mexican immigrants he supervises.*The hotel's general manager (William H. Macy), who fires the racist after he witnesses his hatred in action, also this man's wife (Sharon Stone, an on-site beautician, and his mistress (Heather Graham), an Ambassador switchboard operator.*A dedicated African-American campaign staffer (Nick Cannon), who hopes his meeting with RFK will turn into a permanent job, and his girlfriend (Joy Bryant), another switchboard operator.*Two Mexican-American busboys (Freddy Rodriguez and Jacob Vargas) and a philosophic sous chef (Laurence Fishburne) who likes one but not the other.*An elderly former doorman (Anthony Hopkins) with nothing to do since his wife's death. He plays chess in the Ambassador's lobby with an equally old pal (Harry Belafonte) for hours on end.*A reporter for a Czechoslovak newspaper (Svetlana Metkina) who's been waiting days for an interview with Sen. Kennedy.*A couple of goofball campaign workers (Brian Geraghty and Shia LaBeouf) that play hookey this primary day to drop acid for the first time with a spaced-out hippie acquaintance (Ashton Kutcher). (These segments are the film's moments of comic relief.)So we sit through many stories, impatiently waiting for Bobby (Dave Fraunces) to encounter Sirhan Sirhan (David Kobzantsev), and honestly, some of this stuff is deadly dull, but after those multiple shots ring out, most of what seemed divergent storylines tie together amidst absolute mass hysteria in ways we never saw coming. When I experienced this climactic sequence, I cried as if the horrific event was happening all over again.For its powerful finale, BOBBY rates a strong four out of five stars. If you're a political junkie and a patient sort, by all means see this picture.",4,"""What has violence ever accomplished?...No martyr's cause has ever been stilled by an assassin's bullet."" -- RFK",1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,2767,"['BOBBY', '2006', 'biopic', 'tragic', 'night', 'June', 'when', 'Sen.', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'murdered', 'lone', 'gunman', 'kitchen', 'L.A.', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel.Most', 'film', 'vignettes', 'number', 'people', 'what', 'did', 'hours', 'preceding', 'event', 'range', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'inane', 'clumsy', 'attempts', 'social', 'commentary', 'actions', 'involved.In', 'plot', 'device', 'similar', 'inferior', 'toGRAND', 'HOTEL', '1932', 'constant', 'shuffle', 'scenarios', 'meeting', 'spending', 'time', '*An', 'aging', 'alcoholic', 'nightclub/Vegas', 'entertainer', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'long-suffering', 'husband/manager', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'film', 'writer/director', '*A', 'young', 'lady', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'who', '9', 'pm', 'marrying', 'guy', 'barely', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'just', 'keep', 'being', 'shipped', 'Vietnam', '*Married', 'socialite/campaign', 'donors', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'who', 'must', 'last', 'minute', 'shop', 'black', 'shoes', 'when', 'pack', 'pair', '*The', 'Ambassador', 'kitchen', 'chief', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'bigot', 'abusive', 'Mexican', 'immigrants', '*The', 'hotel', 'general', 'manager', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'who', 'racist', 'hatred', 'action', 'also', 'man', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'on-site', 'beautician', 'mistress', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Ambassador', 'switchboard', 'operator', '*A', 'dedicated', 'African-American', 'campaign', 'staffer', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'who', 'meeting', 'RFK', 'will', 'turn', 'permanent', 'job', 'girlfriend', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'switchboard', 'operator', '*Two', 'Mexican-American', 'busboys', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'philosophic', 'sous', 'chef', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'who', 'one', 'not', 'other', '*An', 'elderly', 'former', 'doorman', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'nothing', 'do', 'wife', 'death', 'chess', 'Ambassador', 'lobby', 'equally', 'old', 'pal', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'hours', 'end', '*A', 'reporter', 'Czechoslovak', 'newspaper', 'Svetlana', 'Metkina', 'who', 'been', 'waiting', 'days', 'interview', 'Sen', 'Kennedy', '*A', 'couple', 'goofball', 'campaign', 'workers', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'play', 'hookey', 'primary', 'day', 'drop', 'acid', 'first', 'time', 'spaced-out', 'hippie', 'acquaintance', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'segments', 'are', 'film', 'moments', 'comic', 'relief', 'sit', 'many', 'stories', 'impatiently', 'waiting', 'Bobby', 'Dave', 'Fraunces', 'encounter', 'Sirhan', 'Sirhan', 'David', 'Kobzantsev', 'honestly', 'stuff', 'deadly', 'dull', 'multiple', 'shots', 'ring', 'out', 'most', 'what', 'seemed', 'divergent', 'storylines', 'together', 'amidst', 'absolute', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'ways', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'When', 'experienced', 'climactic', 'sequence', 'cried', 'horrific', 'event', 'was', 'happening', 'again.For', 'powerful', 'finale', 'BOBBY', 'rates', 'strong', 'four', 'five', 'stars', ""'re"", 'political', 'junkie', 'patient', 'sort', 'means', 'see', 'picture']",N/A

The movie focuses on around 20 people in and around the Ambassador Hotel the day that Robert Kennedy was shot there. The large cast never seems overwhelming. The characters are clear enough that we remember what they were doing the last time we saw them, but we never feel like they are merely one-dimensional. Emilio Estevez really hit the jackpot with his cast - they all are 100% committed to their roles and the audience simply gets lost in the era.The cast is phenomenal - the standouts include Sharon Stone, Nick Cannon as a young Black-American working on the campaign, and Freddy Rodriguez as a young Latino working in the kitchen. The later two, combined with Lindsey Lohan as a woman marrying to save a man's life, serve as the heart of the movie and bring a well-balanced view of many of the hot issues of the day.The movie has an incredible, emotional climax that is enhanced by an actual speech of Bobby Kennedy. The audio and visual clips of Kennedy serve as snapshots into his life and the work he did during his short time in the public eye.

1045211,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000MEYJHY,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[6, 8]","BOBBY is one of those films that catches you by surprise. You already know the outcome; you know the history behind Bobby Kennedy's assassination and where and when it'll happen. But this film has such intensity that you might find yourself holding your breath or covering your eyes (as I did when the fateful moment crept up).Actor Emilio Estevez would probably be the last person on Earth that one would associate with a project like this, yet Estevez plops himself behind the camera as director and shoots a film with such power as to shake the foundations of movie making. This isn't throwing accolades where it isn't deserved either. I'm no fan of Estevez and found many of his film's lacking (from the terrible MIGHTY DUCKS series to the YOUNG GUNS ones). But Estevez must have had a certain itch that told him to make this film -- and do it well -- because he's created a solid gold cinematic experience.And Hollywood turned out en masse to support it. Receiving the award for Ensemble Cast of the Year (2006) at the Hollywood Film Festival, Estevez grouped some of the industry's finest actors and pulled them together in the most successful manner imaginable. From Harry Belafonte and Anthony Hopkins to Martin Sheen and Helen Hunt to William H. Macy and Sharon Stone to Elijah Wood and Lindsey Lohan to Laurence Fishburne and Freddy Rodriguez -- just to touch the tip of this acting iceberg -- the film has talent galore. Undoubtedly this added to the success of the movie. Even with this cast and the story's amazing telling, the film was nominated at various festivals and awards ceremonies but won few of them. To this day it boggles my mind why this movie didn't walk off with more trophies.Regardless, it has cemented its place as a work of astounding proportions (with only one real fault, which we'll cover momentarily).For those who don't know their history, this is the story of the 1968 assassination of Bobby Kennedy at The Ambassador Hotel during his presidential run. The hotel is the focus since this is where it all begins and ends for the unfortunate Senator (and his millions of supporters). Sirhan, Sirhan destroyed the man (literally) with a bullet to the head in the hotel's kitchen. But before that, there were the men and women of the hotel and their lives, and how the assassination affected them all. From the lowly dishwasher to the door greeter. From newlyweds trying to avoid the Vietnam experience to a husband and wife rediscovering themselves. From Kennedy's campaign manager to the black man who would be his transportation advisor. All of them came tumbling down with that final, fatal bullet echoing through the now absent Ambassador Hotel (it has since been torn down and a high school put in its place).It is to Estevez's credit that he was allowed to film a few short scenes in the actual hotel before the wrecking ball took it down. The demolition crew held off its plans for a few days to allow Estevez and his team unfettered access to several locations within The Ambassador. Obviously they supported what he was trying to do (as did his ensemble cast).One wouldn't think that something so well known (Bobby's assasination) could hold such power so many decades after its events but, there you go, that's great film making. Leading up to that horrible night I found myself cringing, even dreading, that moment when Kennedy enters the hotel. Watching Sirhan Sirhan enter it made me cover my eyes, because I just couldn't stand it! No! Not again! Estevez is to be commended for instilling that dread in full force.But dread isn't the only message. Indeed, it isn't even THE message. Hope. It is hope that springs finally from the movie's machinations. Hope that Bobby's message of a united country shall not perish. Hope that his supporters (as well as his message) live the life he intended. And hope that this film might find its way into your DVD player so that you can remember what Bobby was all about.The only negative aspect to the film is its title. Although Bobby was the driving force, most of the film's time was given over to the inside aspects of the hotel itself (and its people). Perhaps a more proper title would've been The Ambassador or some such thing. But this is my only complaint. The rest of the film is unbelievably excellent.",5,An Awesome Take On A Profound Historical Moment,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,4298,"['BOBBY', 'one', 'films', 'catches', 'surprise', 'already', 'know', 'outcome', 'know', 'history', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'where', 'when', ""'ll"", 'happen', 'film', 'such', 'intensity', 'might', 'find', 'holding', 'breath', 'covering', 'eyes', 'did', 'when', 'fateful', 'moment', 'crept', 'up', '.Actor', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'last', 'person', 'Earth', 'one', 'would', 'associate', 'project', 'yet', 'Estevez', 'camera', 'director', 'shoots', 'film', 'such', 'power', 'shake', 'foundations', 'movie', 'making', ""n't"", 'throwing', 'accolades', 'where', ""n't"", 'deserved', 'either', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Estevez', 'found', 'many', 'film', 'lacking', 'terrible', 'MIGHTY', 'DUCKS', 'series', 'YOUNG', 'GUNS', 'ones', 'Estevez', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'certain', 'itch', 'told', 'make', 'film', 'do', 'well', 'created', 'solid', 'gold', 'cinematic', 'experience.And', 'Hollywood', 'turned', 'out', 'en', 'masse', 'support', 'Receiving', 'award', 'Ensemble', 'Cast', 'Year', '2006', 'Hollywood', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Estevez', 'grouped', 'industry', 'finest', 'actors', 'pulled', 'together', 'most', 'successful', 'manner', 'imaginable', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'just', 'touch', 'tip', 'acting', 'iceberg', 'film', 'talent', 'galore', 'Undoubtedly', 'added', 'success', 'movie', 'Even', 'cast', 'story', 'amazing', 'telling', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'various', 'festivals', 'awards', 'ceremonies', 'won', 'few', 'day', 'mind', 'why', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'off', 'more', 'trophies.Regardless', 'cemented', 'place', 'work', 'astounding', 'proportions', 'only', 'one', 'real', 'fault', ""'ll"", 'cover', 'momentarily', '.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'history', 'story', '1968', 'assassination', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'presidential', 'run', 'hotel', 'focus', 'where', 'begins', 'ends', 'unfortunate', 'Senator', 'millions', 'supporters', 'Sirhan', 'Sirhan', 'destroyed', 'man', 'literally', 'bullet', 'head', 'hotel', 'kitchen', 'were', 'men', 'women', 'hotel', 'lives', 'how', 'assassination', 'affected', 'lowly', 'dishwasher', 'door', 'greeter', 'newlyweds', 'trying', 'avoid', 'Vietnam', 'experience', 'husband', 'wife', 'rediscovering', 'Kennedy', 'campaign', 'manager', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'transportation', 'advisor', 'came', 'tumbling', 'down', 'final', 'fatal', 'bullet', 'echoing', 'now', 'absent', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'been', 'torn', 'down', 'high', 'school', 'put', 'place', '.It', 'Estevez', 'credit', 'was', 'allowed', 'film', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'actual', 'hotel', 'wrecking', 'ball', 'took', 'down', 'demolition', 'crew', 'held', 'off', 'plans', 'few', 'days', 'allow', 'Estevez', 'team', 'unfettered', 'access', 'several', 'locations', 'Ambassador', 'Obviously', 'supported', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'did', 'ensemble', 'cast', '.One', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'something', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'Bobby', 'assasination', 'could', 'hold', 'such', 'power', 'so', 'many', 'decades', 'events', 'go', 'great', 'film', 'making', 'Leading', 'up', 'horrible', 'night', 'found', 'cringing', 'even', 'dreading', 'moment', 'when', 'Kennedy', 'hotel', 'Watching', 'Sirhan', 'Sirhan', 'enter', 'made', 'cover', 'eyes', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'No', 'Not', 'again', 'Estevez', 'be', 'commended', 'instilling', 'dread', 'full', 'force.But', 'dread', ""n't"", 'only', 'message', 'Indeed', ""n't"", 'even', 'message', 'Hope', 'hope', 'springs', 'finally', 'movie', 'machinations', 'Hope', 'Bobby', 'message', 'united', 'country', 'shall', 'not', 'perish', 'Hope', 'supporters', 'as', 'well', 'message', 'live', 'life', 'intended', 'hope', 'film', 'might', 'find', 'way', 'DVD', 'player', 'so', 'can', 'remember', 'what', 'Bobby', 'was', 'only', 'negative', 'aspect', 'film', 'title', 'Bobby', 'was', 'driving', 'force', 'most', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'given', 'inside', 'aspects', 'hotel', 'people', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'proper', 'title', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Ambassador', 'such', 'thing', 'only', 'complaint', 'rest', 'film', 'unbelievably', 'excellent']",N/A

1045215,A3BMOOLZMBTHJV,B000MEYJHY,Chris Hilton,"[3, 3]","I think Estevez's purpose here, and one that he achieved pretty well, is to show the tragedy of Robert Kennedy's death in an ordinary human setting, and contrast those events with today. Providing you are not waking from a 50 year sleep or completely ignorant of history, you will know that Kennedy's death hangs over the entire film. Estevez records the day's events in a deliberately soapy, and mostly entertaining style, to contrast then with now - has anything changed? This technique, with clips of RFK's mostly unscripted speeches, constantly reminded me of what has been lost. Comparisons with today's politicians are painful in the extreme. I once watched as RFK spoke, without notes, for 22 minutes, quoting freely from the classics. Few politicians today could even name a classic, let alone quote from one.The soap was mostly relevant - blacks and Latinos in the kitchen, the girl marrying to keep a young man from Vietnam - a stupid war, young lives wasted, black voters obstructed at the polls. Sound familiar? Of course it was soapy - the film has to be sold, get past the factory fed US media and make some money. That cast needs to be paid! The acting was mostly first-rate, the ultimate tragedy was contrasted with the petty concerns of those around RFK, and another life was extinguished, adding to those of John Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. All in the space of 5 years. A great deal of hope died with them.I was a little bored, briefly, during the less successful soapy bits, but, overall, very impressed, very entertained and very moved. I find it pertinent that the media has, generally, given this a lukewarm reception. It touches on issues of human behaviour, decency and justice that are taboo today, not entertaining enough - get back to Big Brother, we'll do the thinking for you.  RFK's words over the final scenes are incredibly poignant. Idealistic for sure, but where are the politicians of today with heart and vision, capable of this level of oratory. They would be ridiculed and marginalized at best - witness our media's misrepresentation of Chavez in Venezuela.This was an Everyman's guide to what has been lost and you cannot help but compare with today.

It dares to keep the film confined to that day and the events leading up to the fateful moment when Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan pulled his trigger in the crowd.The brilliance of the film, and I will say 'brilliance' is that it works. In fact, it works tremendously. At times, the film is a little tedious and draggy, but in essence, the emotion of the entire country and the shock of the events is captured in the characters displayed here.You feel the dismay and the disbelief in the faces and the characters.

1045217,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000MEYJHY,Chris Luallen,"[13, 15]","This movie was much different and even better than I expected. It really wasn't so much about Bobby Kennedy the man but more about what he represented to America in 1968. The film follows various people throughout their day at the Ambassador Hotel as they awaited  Kennedy's arrival the night of his assassination. The huge ensemble cast includes William H. Macy as Paul the hotel manager, Demi Moore as alcoholic night club singer Virgina Fallon and Martin Sheen as Jack, a rich guy who is in psychotherapy for depression and beginning to question the materialistic and superficial lifestyle of he and his wife. Some other significant story lines involve two young Kennedy aides taking their first LSD trip, a humble and thoughtful young Latino kitchen worker and a couple about to get married so that the guy will be sent to Germany rather than Vietnam.The movie also skillfully mixes in a substanial amount of archival footage from the Kennedy campaign that shows the enthuiastic, almost euphoric, crowds that flocked to meet him. Portions of several Kennedy speeches are also played back and they demonstrate the optimism and power of Kennedy's message. His words reminded me most of the great poet Walt Whitman in their call for America to realize it's highest potential as a true ""land of the free"" for all its people. It's the sort of idealism you don't hear too often nowadays and that's a shame.The characters are brought to life by some tremendous acting and their stories are all quite interesting. But, more than any single individual, this movie is really about capturing what America and its people were like on June the 6th, 1968. The public was divided and in turmoil over the war in Vietnam, race relations were strained to the point of violence and gender roles were changing, as both women and men began to question the status quo. At this time Bobby Kennedy represented a change for the better to millions of Americans, especially racial and ethnic minorites, the poor, women and others who weren't being given an equal opportunity.I am too realistic about politics to believe that Bobby Kennedy was a saint or that America would be a perfect place if he had been elected president.

1045218,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000MEYJHY,Cubist,"[3, 3]","Bobby is Emilio Estevez's comeback from obscurity with an earnest look back at the fateful night Presidential-hopeful Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated at the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968. Instead of focusing on the man, Estevez creates a mosaic of characters and shows how the events of the day impacted their lives. Kennedy does appear in the film but mostly in the form of archival footage much like Senator Joseph McCarthy in Good Night, and Good Luck. It makes sense because what actor today could do the man justice?Estevez mixes his large cast up in a Robert Altman-esque stew. To his credit, he has assembled an eclectic cast of actors, some of whom have been out of the mainstream consciousness for a few years (Helen Hunt and Demi Moore), some young, up-and-comers (Freddy Rodriguez and Shia LaBeouf) and established veterans (Anthony Hopkins and Martin Sheen). The one glaring bit of miscasting is a hammy Ashton Kutcher as a spaced out hippie who sells LSD to two young Kennedy campaigners.Estevez establishes the social and political climate early on with a montage of actual historical footage which also sets the idealistic, nostalgic tone. He draws some strong parallels between 1968 and now by showing how the United States was (and is now) embroiled in an unpopular war in a country far away by a government clearly out of touch with its people.The film makes a very definite point via archival footage of Kennedy speaking that, like back then, we need to fix the problems in our own country before we can fix the problems in others. However, like in '68, the existing government doesn't want to do this because it isn't in their best interest - they're too busy making money in foreign wars. Estevez clearly wears his political beliefs on his sleeve but we need these kinds of socially and politically conscious films, especially since Oliver Stone was defanged and stopped making his own unique brand of agitprop. It's just a shame that Estevez wasn't more forceful like Stone used to be.In these cynical and jaded times, it is nice to see a film like Bobby get made. Sadly, even with a star-studded cast it still didn't get better distribution and it needs to because its message is relevant now more than ever. Bobby yearns for the same kind of civil rights movement that helped affect change in the 1960s to rise again today. We need films like this because they are a reminder of how the average person can make a difference. Let's hope it enjoys a second life on home video.""Bobby: The Making of an American Epic"" is a making of featurette. This film is clearly a labour of love for Estevez as evident in the passion he conveys in this extra and this is also apparent in the cast and crew who all speak admiringly of the project and not in the usual, superficial way that you see in most featurettes of this kind.""Eyewitness Accounts from the Ambassador Hotel"" is a panel discussion with four people who were in the hotel the night that Kennedy was killed with one of them even wounded by one of the bullets. They speak about what they were doing there and share some of their experiences.Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",4,An earnest and idealistic film for our times,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,3158,"['Bobby', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'comeback', 'obscurity', 'earnest', 'look', 'back', 'fateful', 'night', 'Presidential-hopeful', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'June', '4', '1968', 'Instead', 'focusing', 'man', 'Estevez', 'mosaic', 'characters', 'how', 'events', 'day', 'impacted', 'lives', 'Kennedy', 'appear', 'film', 'mostly', 'form', 'archival', 'footage', 'much', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'sense', 'what', 'actor', 'today', 'could', 'do', 'man', 'justice', 'Estevez', 'mixes', 'large', 'cast', 'up', 'Robert', 'Altman-esque', 'stew', 'credit', 'assembled', 'eclectic', 'cast', 'actors', 'whom', 'have', 'been', 'mainstream', 'consciousness', 'few', 'years', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'young', 'up-and-comers', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'established', 'veterans', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'one', 'glaring', 'bit', 'miscasting', 'hammy', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'spaced', 'hippie', 'who', 'LSD', 'two', 'young', 'Kennedy', 'campaigners.Estevez', 'social', 'political', 'climate', 'early', 'montage', 'actual', 'historical', 'footage', 'also', 'idealistic', 'nostalgic', 'tone', 'strong', 'parallels', '1968', 'now', 'showing', 'how', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'now', 'embroiled', 'unpopular', 'war', 'country', 'far', 'away', 'government', 'clearly', 'touch', 'people.The', 'film', 'very', 'definite', 'point', 'archival', 'footage', 'Kennedy', 'speaking', 'back', 'then', 'need', 'fix', 'problems', 'own', 'country', 'can', 'fix', 'problems', 'others', 'However', ""'68"", 'existing', 'government', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'best', 'interest', ""'re"", 'too', 'busy', 'making', 'money', 'foreign', 'wars', 'Estevez', 'clearly', 'political', 'beliefs', 'sleeve', 'need', 'kinds', 'socially', 'politically', 'conscious', 'films', 'especially', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'was', 'defanged', 'stopped', 'making', 'own', 'unique', 'brand', 'agitprop', 'just', 'shame', 'Estevez', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'forceful', 'Stone', 'used', 'be.In', 'cynical', 'jaded', 'times', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'Bobby', 'get', 'made', 'Sadly', 'even', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'distribution', 'because', 'message', 'relevant', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'Bobby', 'same', 'kind', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'helped', 'affect', 'change', '1960s', 'rise', 'again', 'today', 'need', 'films', 'are', 'reminder', 'how', 'average', 'person', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'Let', 'hope', 'second', 'life', 'home', 'video', 'Bobby', 'Making', 'American', 'Epic', 'making', 'featurette', 'film', 'clearly', 'labour', 'love', 'Estevez', 'evident', 'passion', 'extra', 'also', 'apparent', 'cast', 'crew', 'who', 'speak', 'admiringly', 'project', 'not', 'usual', 'superficial', 'way', 'see', 'most', 'featurettes', 'kind', 'Eyewitness', 'Accounts', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'panel', 'discussion', 'four', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'hotel', 'night', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'killed', 'one', 'even', 'wounded', 'one', 'bullets', 'speak', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'there', 'share', 'experiences.Finally', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A
1045219,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,B000MEYJHY,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[0, 1]","by Dane YoussefEmilio Esztevez's ""Bobby"" celebrates not only one of the greatest political icons to die before his time, before he had the opportunity to live up to even a fraction of his potential, but a seven-year effort to get it on the big screen.Esztevez is not as renown in the business as his father and brother are. Nor does he have such a sparkling track-record. Let's be honest. Most of the man's movies (paticularly those made after ""The Mighty Ducks"") borderline on unwatchable. But hey, what about ""Rated X""? I heard good things. Somewhere. I don't remember where exactly...But just because a man has a few ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Catwoman""-like stinkers on his resume doesn't mean he's totally incapable of putting out anything at all decent. I know we love to skewer a star when they're down. But let's give a poor guy an even shake...Because of Estevez's experience in the biz, as well as his family's, ""Bobby"" is chock-full of big-name walk-ons. Yes, it's good to be able to employ the best and biggest names in the business, but I don't know if it nessicarily works here. There are so many familiar faces that pop up like a Jack-In-The-Box and then disapear just as quickly, that it's kind of distracting.They're all not on camera long enough so that we see the characters, not actors playing a role. We keep getting the feeling that all we're looking at is super-star after supers-star just here to do some temp work, have fun, do a favor and pay respect to a great political icon.There are so many storylines buzzing in and out in such a condensed amount of time that so many of them feel under-developed (and even pointless at times).There are some really intriguing ones, yes, but there's also too much that just feels like filler. They're not around longe enough to make us really think or care about them.There is no accomplished actor in the plum role of Robert Kennedy (a wise desicion on Esztevez' part)--Kennedy appears as himself in archive footage; newsreels and voice-overs. There is an enourmously talented and renown cast for ""Bobby,"" but no real head-liner.This is an ensemble vehicle, in the tradition of the late Robert Altman's films. Like every ensemble vehicle, the star is the subject matter--RFK himself.The lives he touched, the inpact he made, many of the goings-on during the time... that appears here. But too briefly. Like an extra that just blends into a massive crowd or a beige wall. Where are they? You want them to stand out, you want more.As for it's much-touted heavy-hitter cast: Joshua Jackson (who worked with Esztevez in ""The Mighty Ducks"" films) isn't really given much of anything to do as as Kennedy's campaign manager.Christian Slater is one of the best working actors out there today, but any schmuck standing in line at ""Hot Dog On A Stick"" could have done as good a job as he's allowed to do there. Hey, maybe some of that trademark reptillian-like demeanor of his might have helped. He's a racist, but he's as interesting as plain white-bread. Heather Graham is equally ineffective (has she ever given a really great perfomance?)Ashton Kutcher thankfully sheds his tired ""Kelso"" scthick as a spiritual drug dealer who introduces to LSD. He wears glasses, has long mop-like hair and a scruffy beard. This is good. We're looking at the character, not Kutcher. Lately, Kutcher has been trying to evolve past the dim-witted prett-boy roles in stupid throw-away rom-comedies. He seems to be in very serious danger of becoming just another flavor-of-the-month like so, so many, many other before him (and after him). With roles in movies like ""The Butterfly Effect"" and now ""Bobby,"" there may be hope for him after all.William H. Macy and Starone Stone are some of the best out there. Here they play a married couple who have a rather ugly secret, but the whole thing is under-written. Esztevez' should have kept working on this. It's a nice sub-plot, but their story is thinner than two-ply toilet paper. And we want more.Lawrence Fishburne almost steals the movie as a veteran cook who works at the Ambassador. He has a deep philiosophical mind and some theories on the way the world is... and how to survive in it. How to make it yours. He sounds so insightful, like an older, seasoned veteran not miles away from Kennedy himself. He talks about how anger is toxic and his admiration and love for Dr. King and how it hurt when King was gunned down.Legendary Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins appears as the elderly doorman who won't just flat-out retire because the boredom and feeling of uselessness gets to him. His role is pretty unremarkable, although he brings the same grace and dignity he does to pretty much any role he's in. It's nice to see him away from his ""Hannibal Lecter"" repitore. And ""Bobby"" is a vast improvement over Ron Howard's putrid steaming green Christmas diarrea log, ""The Grinch.""Director Esztevez and Demi Moore appear together as a couple for the first time in Esztevez' nearly unwatchable ""Wisdom,"" which contained none of what was promised. Or anything else worth seeing. They have some worthwhile moments as a showbusiness couple, especially Moore is what's some of the better work she's done in a while. And it's one of the few sub-plots that work.The only true stand-outs here are Lawrence Fishburne, Sharon Stone, Martin Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore. Everyone else seems is just coasting. Because they're all just distinguished veterans, we want them to make an enourmous impact. The kind where the scene and line becomes a legendarymoment and is quoted ad nauseum. But each shot just shows big-name marquee headers doing what just about anyone could have done. Maybe the fact that all these big names are dropped will draw them in.I do applaud Esztevez for not just hiring some celebrity impressionist to play Bobby--like De Vito did for his ""Hoffa."" No two-bit actor can ever forge the man. So Kennedy actually appears at himself technically the whole time throughout (except of a few scenes where Bobby's right there with the actors, but we never get a good look, of course. That feels... respectful.But does it work? The most crippling flaw in ""Bobby"" is that because of the contemporary faces and their underdevloped characters and underwritten scenes, we're never convinced we're back there during that fatal day. And when RFK walks through the door, onto the stage... we're never really convinced that he's in that room at this moment. RFK and the little people never seem to exist within the same time and reality.Throughout the whole film, I was aware that they were just using old footage of Bob and the entire cast--er, members of the Ambassador were cheering facing a camera crew.There are some moments that alone make Bobby worth seeing: A scene where a deception is going on and is revealed--we see the victim's tears and pain, a converstaion that takes place in a kitchen that really stays with you, two suited buttoned-down campaign volunteers who volunteer to embrace something more have than Kennedy, the reporter dying to see the senator in the flesh. All storylines that could have really packed a wallop if they're were written a little more. Was Esztevez on a schedule?But there are a few too many which are just limp which leave you feeling Esztevez should have pumped them up or simply scrapped them altogether. Maybe leaving them in the bottom drawer and hauling them out the next time he wants to make a movie. As it is, this proudly stands as the best film Esztevez has come out with in over a decade. And it is a sometimes really touching tribute to a man who deseves it. For whatever reason you want to check it out, watch it, afterwards light a candle for Good ol' Bob.In the end, what truly makes this a movie to see is the passion. The passion that Esztevez has for Bobby and has had ever since dear Emilio actually came in contact with him when he was but five years old.""Bobby""'s finale (yes, that is the correct phrase) comes to no surprise, but what is so astonishing is how much such an act can still touch us as if we are actually there and then. It helps give the film more of an impact than everything leading up to it did.What matters really is not when or how Kennedy left, but that he was there. Now that he's gone, it's sad how much it says about us how much we need him now...[...]",3,"A somewhat disapointing film, but a moving love letter...",1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,8342,"['Dane',

Jenkins,"[2, 2]","I avoided this film for two years not just because I assumed it would fail to live up to the importance of it's topic, but because that topic is still difficult for me to deal with. The story takes place just a week past my 16th birthday, but for me (and almost everyone of my age that I know,) it's as though Bobby was shot last night. When I see footage from the Ambassador ballroom, or when I see film of the funeral train... the tears quickly well up. Four decades later, I choke up.In reading the many Amazon pages of reviews for this film, you can get a feel for the age of the author. I wouldn't expect anyone under the age of perhaps 12 at the time (or not yet born) to react the same way to this film as those of us who remember the night in vivid detail. And to those too young to really feel this film as we older folks do, three quick points...One, many reviewers don't like the fact that there are so many seemingly unrelated personal stories woven together into this film. I understand the complaint, it's the ""Nashville"" syndrome and I'm no Robert Altman fan.But it makes absolute sense here to show a dozen or so simultaneous tales leading to a common conclusion - because it drives home the fact that Bobby's campaign spoke so eloquently and intimately to such a wide range of social classes and demographics, and that his death shattered them equally. On the day after Bobby finally passed away in his hospital bed, I remember noticing that even Republicans, even conservatives, even those that supported the war, even ""grown-ups"" and my high school teachers were just stunned with shock by what had happened... that there was a fog of unreality and disbelief that people seemed to wander through aimlessly for a few days...Second point - there's a small scene after Bobby is shot where a young man throws a chair against a lobby wall. This rings true (as does everything in the final twenty minutes of the film) as it hints at what was to come, the rage we all felt, the fury, the visceral disgust at our government for continuing an obscene and pointless war, the inconsolable pain and the desire for revenge that many of us had. The Weather Underground was born in the hearts of many of us that night.Finally, in terms of Mr. Estevez' ability to draw the best out of his cast and the dedication with which they approached their roles (for this was obviously each cast member's personal tribute to Bobby...), the look on William H. Macy's face as he watches the ambulance drive away says it all. Macy, a supremely gifted actor, moves deeply in his heart to a place that most actors don't always manage to go.If you're too young to remember that night yourself, trust me.Look at Macy's face, watch him try to cope, to hold on, look into his eyes.That's exactly what it felt like when we heard... that Bobby... had... been shot.",4,"Still a Raw Nerve, an Unhealed Wound",1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,2846,"['avoided', 'film', 'two', 'years', 'not', 'just', 'assumed', 'would', 'fail', 'live', 'up', 'importance', 'topic', 'topic', 'still', 'difficult', 'deal', 'story', 'place', 'just', 'week', '16th', 'birthday', 'almost', 'everyone', 'age', 'know', 'Bobby', 'was', 'shot', 'last', 'night', 'When', 'see', 'footage', 'Ambassador', 'ballroom', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'funeral', 'train', 'tears', 'quickly', 'well', 'up', 'Four', 'decades', 'later', 'choke', 'up.In', 'reading', 'many', 'Amazon', 'pages', 'reviews', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'feel', 'age', 'author', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anyone', 'age', 'perhaps', '12', 'time', 'not', 'yet', 'born', 'react', 'same', 'way', 'film', 'who', 'remember', 'night', 'vivid', 'detail', 'too', 'young', 'really', 'feel', 'film', 'older', 'folks', 'do', 'three', 'quick', 'points', 'One', 'many', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'personal', 'stories', 'woven', 'together', 'film', 'understand', 'complaint', 'Nashville', 'syndrome', ""'m"", 'Robert', 'Altman', 'fan.But', 'absolute', 'sense', 'here', 'show', 'dozen', 'so', 'simultaneous', 'tales', 'leading', 'common', 'conclusion', 'home', 'fact', 'Bobby', 'campaign', 'spoke', 'so', 'eloquently', 'intimately', 'such', 'wide', 'range', 'social', 'classes', 'demographics', 'death', 'shattered', 'equally', 'day', 'Bobby', 'finally', 'passed', 'away', 'hospital', 'bed', 'remember', 'noticing', 'even', 'Republicans', 'even', 'conservatives', 'even', 'supported', 'war', 'even', 'grown-ups', 'high', 'school', 'teachers', 'were', 'just', 'stunned', 'shock', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'was', 'fog', 'unreality', 'disbelief', 'people', 'seemed', 'wander', 'aimlessly', 'few', 'days', 'Second', 'point', 'small', 'scene', 'Bobby', 'shot', 'where', 'young', 'man', 'chair', 'lobby', 'wall', 'true', 'everything', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'rage', 'felt', 'fury', 'visceral', 'disgust', 'government', 'continuing', 'obscene', 'pointless', 'war', 'inconsolable', 'pain', 'desire', 'revenge', 'many', 'had', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'was', 'born', 'hearts', 'many', 'night.Finally', 'terms', 'Mr.', 'Estevez', 'ability', 'draw', 'best', 'cast', 'dedication', 'approached', 'roles', 'was', 'obviously', 'cast', 'member', 'personal', 'tribute', 'Bobby', 'look', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'face', 'ambulance', 'drive', 'away', 'Macy', 'supremely', 'gifted', 'actor', 'moves', 'deeply', 'heart', 'place', 'most', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'manage', 'go.If', ""'re"", 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'night', 'trust', 'me.Look', 'Macy', 'face', 'watch', 'try', 'cope', 'hold', 'look', 'eyes.That', 'exactly', 'what', 'felt', 'when', 'heard', 'Bobby', 'had', 'been', 'shot']",N/A

I'm glad that it didn't because we saved about $20 in the process by watching it through our rental service.  For me, the movie played out like that old series ""Hotel"" with James Brolin as the manager, which existed to showcase the ""B""-list actors (in this case ""A""-list) playing the various guests of the week.  The movie features a bunch of semi-integrated stories about hotel guests and staff in the day leading up to Bobby Kennedy's assassination at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 6, 1968; like a disaster movie with the assassination as the disaster.  The actor who played ""Bobby"" had a bit part at best--essentially a body double available for shooting by a nervous-looking Sirhan Sirhan.  (As many shots as he got off (several people were wounded, but not mortally), you'd think that some member of the security detail would have killed him.)The high-powered cast also includes such notables as Harry Belafonte, Lawrence Fishburne, Sharon Stone, Martin Sheen, Helen Hunt, Christian Slater,  Lindsay Lohan, William H. Macy, Anthony Hopkins, Elijah Wood and Demi Moore.  Director Emilio Estevez manages to include a vanity part for himself as Moore's long-suffering husband/manager.Still, seeing Freddy Rodriguez (""Rico"" from ""Six Feet Under"" as a member) of the kitchen staff was fun (along with a lookback at Don Drysdale's shutout pitching streak of that season).  The best parts of the movie were the authentic footage of Kennedy during the presidential campaign (many times shown on TV's in the movie's scenes, at which time we knew we wouldn't see actor ""Bobby's"" face).

1045224,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B000MEYJHY,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","Interspersed with actual footage of the turbulent 60s, Emilio Estevez presents his take on the fateful events in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel in June 1968.After an introductory scene of a hotel fire drill, we are led through a series of fictional vignettes about hotel workers and patrons, including two young campaign workers(Shia LeBoef, Brian Geraghty)who enjoy chats in a diner with a pretty waitress and aspiring actress named Susan Taylor(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), but who shirk their campaign duties to drop acid with a hippie named Fisher(Ashton Kutcher), and a journalist from Czeckoslovakia(Svetlana Metkina) craving an interview with Senator Kennedy (David Fraunces), despite campaign manager Wade Buckley's(Joshua Jackson)objections.Lawrence Fishburne plays chief kitchen staff member Edward Robinson, who encourages the potential of Latino bus boy, Jose Rojas(Freddy Rodriguez)amid bickering with bus boy Miguel ( Jacob Vargas), and Christian Slater's  supervisor, Daryl Timmons is fired by Paul Ebbers(William H. Macy) for refusal allow the kitchen staff time off from work to vote.Timmons retaliates by revealing Ebbers' extramarital fling with switchboard operator, Angela (Heather Graham)to Ebber's wife, Miriam (Sharon Stone), a beautician whose clientele include washed-up chanteuse, Virginia Fallon (Demi Moore), slated to introduce Senator Kennedy if she can stay sober, and a young bride-to-be named Diane(Lindsay Lohan), who is marrying her High School sweetheart, William Avery (Elijah Wood)to shield him from the Vietnam War draft. A certain irony would later emerge from that scenario.Harry Belafonte and Anthony Hopkins play Nelson and John Casey, a retired hotel employee and doorman respectively, who enjoy games of chess together.Nick Cannon's activist Dwayne, is a young man who views RFK as America's last great hope, and has  pleasant but also sobering exchanges with switchboard girl, Patricia(Joy Bryant),encouraging her to view her existance in society as more than just marginal.Martin Sheen and Helen Hunt play Jack and Samantha, a high-powered couple dealing with his depression and her materialism.Estevez himself appears as Virginia Fallon's long-suffering husband, Tim, and David Krumholtz is her long-suffering agent, Phil.In due time, all their stories are tied by a common thread during Sirhan Sirhan's (David Kobzantsev) climatic firing of a fatal round in the hotel kitchen, destroying hope, destroying lives, and devastating a sense of idealism for many.We hear the Senator's condemnation of violence, prejudice, and fear as the wounded lay in need of assistance, and the last icon of 60s idealism  is removed from our midsts forever.The chaotic scene beneath an American flag at the hotel entrance says it all. It will be up to the shattered, scattered and confused left milling  about as an ambulance drives off to pick up the banner, to bind a nation's wounds, and to make the American people brothers and countrymen again.",3,"""Brothers and Countrymen...""",1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,2975,"['Interspersed', 'actual', 'footage', 'turbulent', '60s', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'take', 'fateful', 'events', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'June', '1968.After', 'introductory', 'scene', 'hotel', 'fire', 'drill', 'are', 'led', 'series', 'fictional', 'vignettes', 'hotel', 'workers', 'patrons', 'including', 'two', 'young', 'campaign', 'workers', 'Shia', 'LeBoef', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'who', 'enjoy', 'chats', 'diner', 'pretty', 'waitress', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'named', 'Susan', 'Taylor', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'who', 'shirk', 'campaign', 'duties', 'drop', 'acid', 'hippie', 'named', 'Fisher', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'journalist', 'Czeckoslovakia', 'Svetlana', 'Metkina', 'craving', 'interview', 'Senator', 'Kennedy', 'David', 'Fraunces', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Wade', 'Buckley', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'objections.Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'chief', 'kitchen', 'staff', 'member', 'Edward', 'Robinson', 'who', 'potential', 'Latino', 'bus', 'boy', 'Jose', 'Rojas', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'bickering', 'bus', 'boy', 'Miguel', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'supervisor', 'Daryl', 'Timmons', 'fired', 'Paul', 'Ebbers', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'refusal', 'kitchen', 'staff', 'time', 'off', 'work', 'vote.Timmons', 'retaliates', 'revealing', 'Ebbers', 'extramarital', 'fling', 'switchboard', 'operator', 'Angela', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Ebber', 'wife', 'Miriam', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'beautician', 'clientele', 'include', 'washed-up', 'chanteuse', 'Virginia', 'Fallon', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'slated', 'introduce', 'Senator', 'Kennedy', 'can', 'stay', 'sober', 'young', 'bride-to-be', 'named', 'Diane', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'who', 'marrying', 'High', 'School', 'sweetheart', 'William', 'Avery', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'shield', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'draft', 'certain', 'irony', 'would', 'later', 'emerge', 'scenario.Harry', 'Belafonte', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'play', 'Nelson', 'John', 'Casey', 'retired', 'hotel', 'employee', 'doorman', 'respectively', 'who', 'enjoy', 'games', 'chess', 'together.Nick', 'Cannon', 'activist', 'Dwayne', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'RFK', 'America', 'last', 'great', 'hope', 'pleasant', 'also', 'sobering', 'exchanges', 'switchboard', 'girl', 'Patricia', 'Joy', 'Bryant', 'encouraging', 'view', 'existance', 'society', 'more', 'just', 'marginal.Martin', 'Sheen', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'play', 'Jack', 'Samantha', 'high-powered', 'couple', 'dealing', 'depression', 'materialism.Estevez', 'Virginia', 'Fallon', 'long-suffering', 'husband', 'Tim', 'David', 'Krumholtz', 'long-suffering', 'agent', 'Phil.In', 'due', 'time', 'stories', 'are', 'tied', 'common', 'thread', 'Sirhan', 'Sirhan', 'David', 'Kobzantsev', 'climatic', 'firing', 'fatal', 'round', 'hotel', 'kitchen', 'destroying', 'hope', 'destroying', 'lives', 'devastating', 'sense', 'idealism', 'many.We', 'hear', 'Senator', 'condemnation', 'violence', 'prejudice', 'fear', 'wounded', 'lay', 'need', 'assistance', 'last', 'icon', '60s', 'idealism', 'removed', 'midsts', 'forever.The', 'chaotic', 'scene', 'beneath', 'American', 'flag', 'hotel', 'entrance', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'shattered', 'scattered', 'confused', 'left', 'milling', 'about', 'ambulance', 'pick', 'up', 'banner', 'bind', 'nation', 'wounds', 'make', 'American', 'people', 'brothers', 'countrymen', 'again']",N/A

How is it possible to have so many superstars i.e. Anthony Hopkins, Harry Belafonte etc. and make a bad film? The subject matter covered; sex, drugs and race in the late 60's, is poignant and the special features segment is extensive. The characters weren't fully developed and the film lacked a cohesive plot. There are so many little stories going on that you don't get a chance to immerse yourself into the overall film. And before you know it, you're facing the assassination scene, which is the final scene, and complete dissatisfaction. If Emilio Estevez, the director of the film had concentrated on a single subplot to the assassination I think the film would've found direction, unfortunately that's not case. I hate to dog actors or directors, but I want to be honest. I would've given it one star, but the individual performances and the special features episode forced me to give the project and additional star.

Kennedy was adored by the masses when he won the primary for the Democratic party, on his way to becoming the president. Then, like his presidential brother, he was gunned down in public. (That was WAY before I was born, so much of what I know comes from books)Emilio Estevez doesn't exactly focus on that in ""Bobby."" Instead, he creates an elaborate ""Grand Hotel""-style plot, focusing on the people who surrounded Kennedy on the last day of his life. The movie is a little scattered throughout the first parts, but Estevez yanks it together in time for the inevitable, tragic denouement.The entire movie takes place on one day: June 4, 1968. The place: Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel. And there's as much drama out of the campaign as in it: For example, the manager (William H. Macy) is cheating on his smart beautician wife (Sharon Stone) with the switchboard girl (Heather Graham), but takes some time out to fire a racist supervisor (Christian Slater) because the guy won't let the black and Latin employees vote.The doorman (Anthony Hopkins) and his pal (Harry Belafonte) play chess and talk. A lounge singer (Demi Moore) is struggling with alcoholism, a young girl (Lindsay Lohan) is marrying a guy she doesn't love (Elijah Wood) to keep him from going to Vietnam, and campaign workers drop acid. Their stories are only loosely intwertwined -- until Sirhan Sirhan arrives.Estevez has created a movie that Tries To Have It All. It tackles racism, war, love, voting, women's rights, and the adored icons of an era. It also stars just about every kind of actor: veterans, Bratpackers, ex-sexpots, MTV stars, party girls and accomplished young actors.In fact, ""Bobby"" spills over with plot and characters, and for the first two thirds, it seems that there is almost too much of EVERYTHING. But Estevez captures the you-are-there ambience, with crisp suits and longer dresses, neat hair, period music and the occasional baseball reference. For a day, you ARE in Los Angeles in 1968.And he has a knack for creating a sense of foreboding and sadness, which hangs independently of the characters. Yet in some scenes where Kennedy is supposed to be speaking, the shining eagerness that you see in the audience's faces is enough to bowl you over. It captures the hope that was present during that era, and afterwards died quickly, as hope usually does.The enormous cast makes it hard to single out one, but there are several good ones: Laurence Fishborne and Freddy Rodriguez as cooks who discuss the racism they struggle with, Macy as the manager who struggles to regain his lost youth by an affair, Stone as his faded beauty of a wife, and Wood's bittersweet, ironic portrayal of the young groom.Kennedy himself is a nebulous figure -- most of what we see are archival clips, which show the young candidate's charisma and power. Although ""Bobby's"" take on him is rather naive, it does leave you wondering how he might have changed the US, had he lived.""Bobby"" is high on ambition, and Estevez manages to create a truly poignant, thought-provoking film. It has its flaws, but it also captures a shocking moment in American history.",4,A time of shame and sorrow,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,3137,"['Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'adored', 'masses', 'when', 'won', 'primary', 'Democratic', 'party', 'way', 'becoming', 'president', 'Then', 'presidential', 'brother', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'public', 'was', 'WAY', 'was', 'born', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'know', 'books', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'focus', 'Bobby', 'Instead', 'elaborate', 'Grand', 'Hotel', '-style', 'plot', 'focusing', 'people', 'who', 'surrounded', 'Kennedy', 'last', 'day', 'life', 'movie', 'little', 'scattered', 'first', 'parts', 'Estevez', 'together', 'time', 'inevitable', 'tragic', 'denouement.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'place', 'one', 'day', 'June', '4', '1968', 'place', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'as', 'much', 'drama', 'campaign', 'example', 'manager', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'cheating', 'smart', 'beautician', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'switchboard', 'girl', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'time', 'out', 'fire', 'racist', 'supervisor', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'guy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'black', 'Latin', 'employees', 'vote.The', 'doorman', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'pal', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'play', 'chess', 'talk', 'lounge', 'singer', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'struggling', 'alcoholism', 'young', 'girl', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'marrying', 'guy', ""n't"", 'love', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'keep', 'going', 'Vietnam', 'campaign', 'workers', 'drop', 'acid', 'stories', 'are', 'only', 'loosely', 'intwertwined', 'Sirhan', 'Sirhan', 'arrives.Estevez', 'created', 'movie', 'Have', 'racism', 'war', 'love', 'voting', 'women', 'rights', 'adored', 'icons', 'era', 'also', 'just', 'about', 'kind', 'actor', 'veterans', 'Bratpackers', 'ex-sexpots', 'MTV', 'party', 'girls', 'accomplished', 'young', 'actors.In', 'fact', 'Bobby', 'plot', 'characters', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'EVERYTHING', 'Estevez', 'you-are-there', 'ambience', 'crisp', 'suits', 'longer', 'dresses', 'neat', 'hair', 'period', 'music', 'occasional', 'baseball', 'reference', 'day', 'ARE', 'Los', 'Angeles', '1968.And', 'knack', 'creating', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'sadness', 'independently', 'characters', 'scenes', 'where', 'Kennedy', 'supposed', 'be', 'speaking', 'shining', 'eagerness', 'see', 'audience', 'enough', 'bowl', 'hope', 'was', 'present', 'era', 'afterwards', 'died', 'quickly', 'hope', 'usually', 'enormous', 'cast', 'hard', 'single', 'out', 'one', 'are', 'several', 'good', 'ones', 'Laurence', 'Fishborne', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'cooks', 'who', 'discuss', 'racism', 'struggle', 'Macy', 'manager', 'who', 'regain', 'lost', 'youth', 'affair', 'Stone', 'faded', 'beauty', 'wife', 'Wood', 'bittersweet', 'ironic', 'portrayal', 'young', 'groom.Kennedy', 'nebulous', 'figure', 'most', 'what', 'see', 'are', 'archival', 'clips', 'show', 'young', 'candidate', 'charisma', 'power', 'Bobby', 'take', 'rather', 'naive', 'leave', 'wondering', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'changed', 'US', 'had', 'lived', 'Bobby', 'high', 'ambition', 'Estevez', 'create', 'truly', 'poignant', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'flaws', 'also', 'shocking', 'moment', 'American', 'history']",N/A

This film is a series of vignettes of the lives of many people (22 examples shine) whose hope for a better future than that of a country undergoing disintegration on many levels were shattered.  It is about 'little people', people with choices whose responses to the death of a hero is devastating.Racism (Christian Slater vs Laurence Fishburne vs interaction with Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez and Jacob Vargas); hippie/white collar drug abuse (Ashton Kutcher dealing LSD to Brian Geraghty and Shia LaBeouf, Demi Moore's alcoholism defeating her marriage to Emilio Estevez and career as a lounge singer); aging and the problems of 'useless old people' (Harry Belafonte and Anthony Hopkins); adultery (hotel manager William Macy married to beautician Sharon Stone yet having an affair with switchboard operator Heather Graham); marriages teetering on commercialism (Martin Sheen and Helen Hunt); young political aspirants basing futures on RFK (Joshua Jackson and Nick Cannon); and the extremes to which young men will go to avoid being sent to Vietnam (Elijah Wood and Lindsay Lohan) - these are the main characters we get to know as they prepare for the evening's party for RFK and then suffer the explosive effect of the shooting by Sirhan Sirhan (David Kobzantsev). The power of the film lies in the impact Bobby Kennedy had on all of these people who represent the rest of a nation.Estevez wisely uses film footage from life to project the speech and presence of RFK: using an actor to depict him would have made the effect less sharp.  But in the end, as it seems apparent from Estevez' script, the power comes from the messages in the voice-over of Kennedy's own speeches, words to offer hope and a chance for resolution of the many conflicts that threatened to destroy the US.  Would that there were minds with such thoughts speaking today when a leader is so desperately needed!  The film has flaws (it would be difficult for a two hour enactment of a well known yet partially fictionalized incident not to). But the message is pungent and clear: we MUST care for each other as a country and forgo the alienation that is so rampant.  A very fine film for thought.

The ensemble cast, most of whom give excellent performances, consists of Demi Moore, Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone (I didn't recognize her), Lawrence Fishburne, Christian Slater, Helen Hunt, William Macy, Martin Sheen, Harry Belafonte et al.Included on the DVD is footage about the filming of BOBBY as well as interviews with some of the people who were at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles the night Kennedy was shot. (I had forgotten all the support that he gave to the farm workers of California, but one of their organizers appears on the DVD.The movie at times can be a bit slow; occasionally you can see its scaffolding. On the other hand, the soundtrack is quite wonderful including the song written for the film by Bryan Adams, ""Never Gonna Break My Faith,"" sung by Aretha Frankllin and Mary J. Blige. And whatever may be the movie's flaws, you never question the director's passion. There is wonderful sad footage of Kennedy during his brief presidential campaign. Although alive when he was assassinated, I had forgotten both the adoration of and the size of the crowds his campaign drew. He was such a fine, to-the-point speaker. His concerns expressed so eloquently in his speeches are the same as today: poverty, an unpopular war, racism, etc. It's as if nothing has changed in the last 40 years.

1045235,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000MEYJHY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Such a film is imprinted with nostalgia and a tremendous human lesson in history.When all these events were happening all over the world in Czechoslovakia, France, China, the USA and many other countries, when we thought the world was going to change completely overnight, I was in Africa and I lived the closure of these enthusing events in Kinshasa.And all the events came to a complete halt. In Czechoslovakia, the Russians will come later on to curb their spring down. In France elections will give the widest majority de Gaulle ever had. In The USA Martin Luther King was assassinated, Robert Kennedy was assassinated and the war in Vietnam got seven more years of rotting madness.We thought the world could be changed by the masses and it was not. The masses are not the whole people and it often takes few people in a mass to neutralize the mass or lead it over the brink. History is probably not done by the masses but in fact it is done by itself, by its own contradictions and its own means. In 1968, the war in Vietnam was not ripe enough to bring a defeat to the US and in the US, apart from the young and the Blacks, the vast silent majority voted for the war and not for its end. In Czechoslovakia, like in all the ""socialist"" countries the situation was not ripe for the fall of the Soviet dogma, or the Maoist one as for that.But when is history ripe for change? No one can say before, or very few can and these are not listened to. No one can program a revolution and it is often pure chance when one occurs. It is not the decision of one man or one group of people. It is the result of vast conditions that have to be favorable to that change and myriads of parameters that have to converge towards such an event. The Soviet revolution was the result of an international situation that made Russia ripe for a radical change, just as the Chinese revolution was the result of a similar international situation.In 1968 nothing was ripe for a radical change in any country at all. Any change could happen only after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, and even so it had  to emerge in China first with the elimination of Lin Biao in 1971 and the slow emergence of Deng Xiaoping. And that only came because China was China and the Chinese people wanted to improve their lot by their own means and efforts and some leaders were able to capture this need, this want, this desire to turn it into patriotism.This film then is the demonstration that it is not enough even to win an important primary for history to accept to let the winner take over and change the world. The world changes when history is ready for that change. The only thing we can be sure of is that in the long run it will become freer, more democratic, more peaceful, richer and maybe also wiser. But there is no end to that slow and long process: there will always be some more steps to take.What can we do? Remember the failed opportunities of the past and try to build new opportunities like with this film in 2006 and 2007 that contributed to Obama's history, and keep in mind that one step forward may be followed by two steps backward, and then later on maybe by three steps forward. No one can tell. No one can predict or decide of these steps, though it would be absurd not to seize an opportunity when it appears, even if in the end it fails.This film is unluckily not serious enough as for the historical dimension of these tragic events. It is too nostalgic and even sentimental. But it played its role even if the real film on the subject gas to be done and the absence of security for one still has to be analyzed and understood. It is too easy to say that America has a violent culture. It also had a particularly negligent security policy. Security was the least important item of their consciousness. Man is benevolent by definition, but man is also violent by definition. They considered the first side of man and forgot the second though they tried to appeal to it in Vietnam.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Not historical enough,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,3995,"['Such', 'film', 'imprinted', 'nostalgia', 'tremendous', 'human', 'lesson', 'history.When', 'events', 'were', 'happening', 'world', 'Czechoslovakia', 'France', 'China', 'USA', 'many', 'other', 'countries', 'when', 'thought', 'world', 'was', 'going', 'change', 'completely', 'overnight', 'was', 'Africa', 'lived', 'closure', 'enthusing', 'events', 'Kinshasa.And', 'events', 'came', 'complete', 'halt', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Russians', 'will', 'come', 'later', 'curb', 'spring', 'down', 'France', 'elections', 'will', 'give', 'widest', 'majority', 'Gaulle', 'ever', 'had', 'USA', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'assassinated', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'got', 'seven', 'more', 'years', 'rotting', 'madness.We', 'thought', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'changed', 'masses', 'was', 'not', 'masses', 'are', 'not', 'whole', 'people', 'often', 'few', 'people', 'mass', 'neutralize', 'mass', 'lead', 'brink', 'History', 'probably', 'not', 'done', 'masses', 'fact', 'done', 'own', 'contradictions', 'own', 'means', '1968', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'not', 'ripe', 'enough', 'bring', 'defeat', 'US', 'US', 'apart', 'young', 'Blacks', 'vast', 'silent', 'majority', 'voted', 'war', 'not', 'end', 'Czechoslovakia', 'socialist', 'countries', 'situation', 'was', 'not', 'ripe', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'dogma', 'Maoist', 'one', 'that.But', 'when', 'history', 'ripe', 'change', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'very', 'few', 'can', 'are', 'not', 'listened', 'one', 'can', 'program', 'revolution', 'often', 'pure', 'chance', 'when', 'one', 'occurs', 'not', 'decision', 'one', 'man', 'one', 'group', 'people', 'result', 'vast', 'conditions', 'have', 'be', 'favorable', 'change', 'myriads', 'parameters', 'have', 'converge', 'towards', 'such', 'event', 'Soviet', 'revolution', 'was', 'result', 'international', 'situation', 'made', 'Russia', 'ripe', 'radical', 'change', 'just', 'Chinese', 'revolution', 'was', 'result', 'similar', 'international', 'situation.In', '1968', 'nothing', 'was', 'ripe', 'radical', 'change', 'country', 'Any', 'change', 'could', 'happen', 'only', 'end', 'Vietnam', 'War', '1975', 'even', 'had', 'emerge', 'China', 'first', 'elimination', 'Lin', 'Biao', '1971', 'slow', 'emergence', 'Deng', 'Xiaoping', 'only', 'came', 'China', 'was', 'China', 'Chinese', 'people', 'wanted', 'improve', 'lot', 'own', 'means', 'efforts', 'leaders', 'were', 'able', 'capture', 'need', 'want', 'desire', 'turn', 'patriotism.This', 'film', 'then', 'demonstration', 'not', 'enough', 'even', 'win', 'important', 'primary', 'history', 'accept', 'let', 'winner', 'take', 'change', 'world', 'world', 'when', 'history', 'ready', 'change', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'long', 'run', 'will', 'become', 'freer', 'more', 'democratic', 'more', 'peaceful', 'richer', 'maybe', 'also', 'wiser', 'end', 'slow', 'long', 'process', 'there', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'more', 'steps', 'take.What', 'can', 'do', 'Remember', 'failed', 'opportunities', 'past', 'try', 'build', 'new', 'opportunities', 'film', '2006', '2007', 'contributed', 'Obama', 'history', 'keep', 'mind', 'one', 'step', 'forward', 'may', 'be', 'followed', 'two', 'steps', 'backward', 'then', 'later', 'maybe', 'three', 'steps', 'forward', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'can', 'predict', 'decide', 'steps', 'would', 'be', 'absurd', 'not', 'seize', 'opportunity', 'when', 'even', 'end', 'fails.This', 'film', 'unluckily', 'not', 'serious', 'enough', 'historical', 'dimension', 'tragic', 'events', 'too', 'nostalgic', 'even', 'sentimental', 'played', 'role', 'even', 'real', 'film', 'subject', 'gas', 'be', 'done', 'absence', 'security', 'one', 'still', 'be', 'analyzed', 'understood', 'too', 'easy', 'say', 'America', 'violent', 'culture', 'also', 'had', 'particularly', 'negligent', 'security', 'policy', 'Security', 'was', 'least', 'important', 'item', 'consciousness', 'Man', 'benevolent', 'definition', 'man', 'also', 'violent', 'definition', 'considered', 'first', 'side', 'man', 'forgot', 'second', 'tried', 'appeal', 'Vietnam.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

I am therefore genuinely puzzled by the number of reviews I have read on-line of this film that accuse it of being soap opera, unnecessarily sentimental and overly dramatic; I have sat through many, many films in my day that nauseated me for their phony overly romantic indulgences, and I can spot cheap sentiment like a con man could spot hucksters in a convention of three-card Monte dealers.  And I am here to tell you that there was nothing phony about the film Bobby, although I am not sure that many who did not live through it could ever appreciate how perfectly realized a piece of nostalgia it actually is.People who know me say they can gauge how much I like a film by how long it stays in my DVD player after it's over (I rarely go to the movies anymore and never rent, preferring to purchase most films, often sight unseen, for my large DVD library).  If I didn't like it, I usually rip it out within seconds of seeing the words, ""The End"" flash across the screen.  If I am marginally impressed or pleased, I will sit through at least a portion of the credits, reflecting on who played what, and sometimes how I might have cast it differently.  But when I am really, truly blown away by a film, everyone knows it by my stunned silence, and my staring silently at the screen until the disc returns to the main menu.  Such a film was Bobby, one of the few films I've seen so far this year to command my attention to the very end.  More than once I found my eyes moisten, and I am not the sloppy type.  Moved rather by the truth of it, what my memory tells me was a perfect rendition of what the country felt like in 1968, an achievement I cannot praise highly enough.Director Emilio Estevez has crafted a film that brilliantly evokes the summer of 1968, with amazing clarity for someone who wasn't even around then.  I recall very well the main event depicted in this film; but what I recall better is the feel, the attitude and the sense of hope and wonder of that summer of 1968 - and the candidacy of Bobby Kennedy - and what it meant to be young and alive, and sense somehow that the times they were a' changin'.Many reviewers seem to be puzzled by the film's focus on so many people who had nothing in common but the fact that they were all at the Hotel Ambassador on that fateful day, without realizing that the film offers fictional portraits of several people who were also shot that night, as well as a very real depiction of the hopes and aspirations of Mr. Kennedy's supporters.  Even more importantly, this well-crafted film offers a very accurate snapshot of the time and national climate that was 1968.  At 14, I was too young to vote in 1968, but I certainly shared the opinion even then, as one character put it, ""Now that Dr. King is gone, Bobby Kennedy is the only one left"".  Maybe that's one of the reasons why we were so devastated; when Bobby was shot, it seemed like the hopes of a whole generation were murdered with him.A perfect picture?  No, but one I enjoyed nonetheless for its spot-on evocation of a truly magical period.  Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, but it seemed that this picture evoked what 1968 truly felt like at the time, and that's enough for me to endorse this film wholeheartedly.",4,Very Good Portrait of a Very Sad Year,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,3453,"['am', 'not', 'one', 'have', 'emotions', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'when', 'viewing', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'sentimental', 'subject', 'matter', 'nothing', 'deplore', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'cheap', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'storytelling', 'am', 'therefore', 'genuinely', 'puzzled', 'number', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'on-line', 'film', 'accuse', 'being', 'soap', 'opera', 'unnecessarily', 'sentimental', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'have', 'sat', 'many', 'many', 'films', 'day', 'nauseated', 'phony', 'overly', 'romantic', 'indulgences', 'can', 'spot', 'cheap', 'sentiment', 'con', 'man', 'could', 'spot', 'hucksters', 'convention', 'three-card', 'Monte', 'dealers', 'am', 'here', 'tell', 'was', 'nothing', 'phony', 'film', 'Bobby', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'many', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'could', 'ever', 'appreciate', 'how', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'piece', 'nostalgia', 'actually', 'who', 'know', 'say', 'can', 'gauge', 'how', 'much', 'like', 'film', 'how', 'long', 'DVD', 'player', 'rarely', 'go', 'movies', 'anymore', 'never', 'rent', 'preferring', 'purchase', 'most', 'films', 'often', 'sight', 'unseen', 'large', 'DVD', 'library', 'did', ""n't"", 'usually', 'rip', 'seconds', 'seeing', 'words', 'End', 'flash', 'screen', 'am', 'marginally', 'impressed', 'pleased', 'will', 'sit', 'least', 'portion', 'credits', 'reflecting', 'who', 'played', 'what', 'sometimes', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'cast', 'differently', 'when', 'am', 'really', 'truly', 'blown', 'away', 'film', 'everyone', 'stunned', 'silence', 'staring', 'silently', 'screen', 'disc', 'returns', 'main', 'menu', 'film', 'was', 'Bobby', 'one', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'command', 'attention', 'very', 'end', 'More', 'once', 'found', 'eyes', 'moisten', 'am', 'not', 'sloppy', 'type', 'Moved', 'rather', 'truth', 'what', 'memory', 'tells', 'was', 'perfect', 'rendition', 'what', 'country', 'felt', '1968', 'achievement', 'can', 'not', 'praise', 'highly', 'enough.Director', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'crafted', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'summer', '1968', 'amazing', 'clarity', 'someone', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'around', 'then', 'recall', 'very', 'well', 'main', 'event', 'depicted', 'film', 'what', 'recall', 'better', 'feel', 'attitude', 'sense', 'hope', 'wonder', 'summer', '1968', 'candidacy', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'young', 'alive', 'sense', 'somehow', 'times', 'were', ""changin'.Many"", 'reviewers', 'seem', 'be', 'puzzled', 'film', 'focus', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'nothing', 'common', 'fact', 'were', 'Hotel', 'Ambassador', 'fateful', 'day', 'realizing', 'film', 'fictional', 'portraits', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'shot', 'night', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'real', 'depiction', 'hopes', 'aspirations', 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', 'supporters', 'Even', 'more', 'importantly', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'very', 'accurate', 'snapshot', 'time', 'national', 'climate', 'was', '1968', '14', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'vote', '1968', 'certainly', 'shared', 'opinion', 'even', 'then', 'one', 'character', 'put', 'Now', 'Dr.', 'King', 'gone', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'Maybe', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'devastated', 'when', 'Bobby', 'was', 'shot', 'seemed', 'hopes', 'whole', 'generation', 'were', 'murdered', 'him.A', 'perfect', 'picture', 'No', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'nonetheless', 'spot-on', 'evocation', 'truly', 'magical', 'period', 'Maybe', 'mind', 'playing', 'tricks', 'seemed', 'picture', 'evoked', 'what', '1968', 'truly', 'felt', 'time', 'enough', 'endorse', 'film', 'wholeheartedly']",N/A
1045238,A366S12KCZ280V,B000MEYJHY,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","I have always been a great admirer of John, Bobby and Ted Kennedy. Of the three I especially had great admeration for Bobby. There was I believe so much promise for the future of this country when Bobby Kennedy announced he would run for President back in 1968. While a democrat he didn't care what a persons politcal persuasion, race, sex or beliefs were. He wanted to bring a nation that was tearing itself apart back together and stop the madness the country was falling into. The assasination of Bobby after his victory in the California primary delivered such a blow to the whole country.Recently I had the chance to watch a movie about that night in California at the Ambassitor Hotel titled ""Bobby"". Surprisingly it was a movie I had never heard of even though it came out in 2006 and was about the one American I had the greatest admiration for.While this is a movie dealing with the subject of Bobby Kennedy it is not as the title might suggest a biopic about his life. What it is about is people who were touched and inspired by Kennedy and made a difference in their lives. The movie takes place on June 4, 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. It is the night of the California primary and the Ambassador is the campaign headquarters for Bobby Kennedy. The hotel is alive with campaign workers, print and TV media and the hotel staff racing around preparing for the election results to come in. The movie in particular deals with 22 individuals who were in the Ambssador Hotel that night of June 4th. Some of these individuals lives had already been touched by Bobby Kennedy while others lives will be touched by Bobby because of the tragic event that would unfold later in the evening. When it would be all over though none of their lives would ever be the same.With 22 characters to portray in the film required a first rate ensemble cast to fill the rolls. And some very big names they got to fill those rolls I must say. Far too many actors to name all but included among them are Anthony Hopkins, William H. Macy, Helen Hunt, Laurence Fishburne, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Harry Belafonte, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. In addition to acting in the movie Emilio Estevez also wrote and directed ""Bobby"". This was a project that near and dear to Estevez to make. It took a total of five years for him to get ""Bobby"" on the screen. Estevez did an outstanding effort in writing 22 destinctive characters. Each with their own unique story which tells why they are there that night at the Ambassador. Some of the more memorable characters include the two Mexican busboys at the Ambassador who come to work only to get the bad news they will have to work a double shift due to the large crowd expected to be at the hotel that night. One of the busboys is a baseball fan and he has two tickets to go see the Dodgers play that night. He was planning on taking his father to the game. Resigned to the fact that he won't be able to go to the game he gives the tickets away not knowing he is about to shake the hand of Bobby Kennedy and as a result lay witness to a event far more important than Don Drysdale setting a record on the pitcher's mound.There is the story of the young girl, played by Lindsay Lohan, who is at the Ambassador to marry her high school sweetheart. She's not marring him for love or for money. She is going to marry him so he won't have to go to Vietnam and fight on the frontline. Then there is the two Kennedy campaign workers who provide the comic relief in the film. They are suppose to be out doing last minute campaigning for Kennedy but get sidetracked when they go to this hippy they know to buy a joint to smoke and instead get introduced to LSD and trip out while playing the wildest game of tennis you have ever seen. Everyone of the 22 individuals has some kind of issue or crisis going on their life and they are all going to meet head on at the ballroom of the Ambassador. Then there is a very brief moment in the film as Emilio Estevez is walking out the front door of the hotel that makes you take a sudden breath. As he walks out he bumps into a young man. No one in the movie has any idea who this young man is or why he's there but YOU suddenly know who this person is and that the wheels of fate are in motion.Bobby Kennedy is not portrayed by any actor in the movie. Instead Bobby is shown throughout in news reel clips walking among crowds of people shaking hands or giving a speech including his victory speech after being declared winner of the California primary. The recreation of the assassination is very realistic and left this reviewer in tears bringing back a lot of memories of that night. As Bobby Kennedy is being wheeled away on a stretcher the 22 individuals who had been featured throughout the movie suddenly see their problems crumble away as something horrible has just occurred in front of them. A couple of the individuals were shot themselves during the assassination. They would go on to recover from their wounds.The wounds the country would suffer from the death of Bobby Kennedy is a different story however. I don't think the United Stated has ever completely recovered from the assassination nor ever truely will. Bobby's death took something out of this country. All the hope and inspiration that Bobby gave us was discarded with the election of Richard Nixon. Politics became rife with scandals and cynicism. The needs of the many would be replaced with the needs of the rich and as congress becomes impotent in solving the truely important issues they mire themselves in jingoism and congradulate themselves for how self-rightious they are.But for a brief moment though there was hope. The movie ""Bobby"" reminds us of that as it recreates that horrible night in 1968. For anyone of my generation this truely is a film to watch and remember. Maybe even hope that someday another Bobby Kennedy will come along who will recall in people that we can make a difference and inspire us to do so and that peace is far greater then the almighty dollar. For those of the generation who came after us ""Bobby"" is just as important for you to watch too. It is a testament that one person really can make a difference and move a country to do what is just and right. That politics hasn't always been like it is now and maybe we can guide it back to how it should be.There is an old saying that ""Politicians think of the next election while statesmen think of the next generation"". That being the case the movie ""Bobby"" shows that Bobby Kennedy was a statesman of the highest degree. Find the chance to sit down and watch ""Bobby"" for yourself and you decide if he was a politician or a statesman. I bet I know what your conclusion will be.",5,A Great Movie About A Great Man,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,6715,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'admirer', 'John', 'Bobby', 'Ted', 'Kennedy',

1045239,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B000MEYJHY,Jason Horsley,"[2, 2]","One of the best things I have seen recently, Emilio Estevez's film came as a real surprise. It takes place on a single day leading up to Bobby Kennedy's assassination, in the hotel where it occurred. An ensemble piece with a great cast (Sharon Stone, Christian Slater, Anthony Hopkins, Demi More, Estevez, Martin Sheen, Helen Hunt, Laurence Fishburne, and some impressive, lesser-known actors), Estevez (who also wrote the script) directs with sensitivity and assurance and a remarkable lightness of touch. Estevez's real gift is his empathy for his characters (and for the actors playing them), and it's hard to think of another recent movie so completely and effortlessly populated with living, breathing people. The film deftly aspires to Altman-style ensemble, and though it never quite rises above the level of slick and proficient filmmaking, it's an amazing achievement nonetheless. Every scene offers unexpected pleasures, and every performance seems to crackle with the joy of acting (with the possible exception of Estevez and Anthony Hopkins, neither of whom do much new here). The scenes are woven together brilliantly, into a seamless and flawlessly entertaining tapestry of human lives. The individual moments - engrossing when taken apart - build towards a devastating climax in which, against all odds, Estevez manages to make us feel the event as a bona fide tragedy. Rightly or wrongly, he creates the powerful sense of a more innocent, idealistic time in which the corruptability of leaders was not a given and optimism was not synonymous with naivete. And he gives us, free from the cynical/ironic distance of most movies today (vide The Proposition), the death of hope. (The heavy-handedness of Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence"" here may be the film's only real wrong step, however.) In its own far humbler (and consequently more affecting) fashion, Bobby stands as a worthy companion piece to Stone's JFK. Not a masterpiece, but an almost perfect gem, a tiny work of art that is all the more impressive for being so unassuming.",4,An Unexpected  Gem,1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,2056,"['One', 'best', 'things', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'film', 'came', 'real', 'surprise', 'place', 'single', 'day', 'leading', 'up', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'hotel', 'where', 'occurred', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'great', 'cast', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Demi', 'More', 'Estevez', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'impressive', 'lesser-known', 'actors', 'Estevez', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'sensitivity', 'assurance', 'remarkable', 'lightness', 'touch', 'Estevez', 'real', 'gift', 'empathy', 'characters', 'actors', 'playing', 'hard', 'think', 'recent', 'movie', 'so', 'completely', 'effortlessly', 'populated', 'living', 'breathing', 'people', 'film', 'deftly', 'Altman-style', 'ensemble', 'never', 'quite', 'level', 'slick', 'proficient', 'filmmaking', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'nonetheless', 'Every', 'scene', 'offers', 'unexpected', 'pleasures', 'performance', 'crackle', 'joy', 'acting', 'possible', 'exception', 'Estevez', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'neither', 'whom', 'do', 'much', 'new', 'here', 'scenes', 'are', 'woven', 'together', 'brilliantly', 'seamless', 'flawlessly', 'entertaining', 'tapestry', 'human', 'lives', 'individual', 'moments', 'engrossing', 'when', 'taken', 'apart', 'build', 'devastating', 'climax', 'odds', 'Estevez', 'make', 'feel', 'event', 'bona', 'fide', 'tragedy', 'Rightly', 'wrongly', 'powerful', 'sense', 'more', 'innocent', 'idealistic', 'time', 'corruptability', 'leaders', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'optimism', 'was', 'not', 'synonymous', 'naivete', 'free', 'cynical/ironic', 'distance', 'most', 'movies', 'today', 'Proposition', 'death', 'hope', 'heavy-handedness', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'Sound', 'Silence', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'wrong', 'step', 'however', 'own', 'far', 'humbler', 'consequently', 'more', 'affecting', 'fashion', 'Bobby', 'worthy', 'companion', 'piece', 'Stone', 'JFK', 'Not', 'masterpiece', 'almost', 'perfect', 'gem', 'tiny', 'work', 'art', 'more', 'impressive', 'being', 'so', 'unassuming']",N/A
1045240,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000MEYJHY,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[36, 39]","The year of 1968 will forever be remembered in American history as one of the darkest on record.  Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot, the Vietnam War was escalating, drug abuse was on a rampage, and, as told in this excellent film by Emilio Estevez, Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated.The film centers on one day; June 4, 1968, the day of the California Presidential Primary.  The site of the film is the Ambassador Hotel.  Bobby Kennedy, who said he would drop out of the race if he lost the primary, was scheduled to appear at the hotel later that evening.  During the course of the day, several events involving several different people unfold as the anticipated time of Kennedy's arrival draws near.Paul (William H. Macy), the hotel manager is married to Miriam (Sharon Stone), the hotel hairstylist, but he's having an affair with Angela (Heather Graham), a hotel switchboard operator. Paul also fires Timmons (Christian Slater), the kitchen manager, because of his refusal to give his Hispanic and Black employees time off to vote.  Jose, a bus boy, has found out that he has to work a double shift in the kitchen, so he'll be unable to attend the Dodgers game which he bought tickets for.  Since he can't attend, he gives the tickets to head chef Edward Robinson (Laurence Fishburne).David (Elijah Wood) and Diane (Lindsay Lohan) are scheduled to be married at the hotel.  Diane has agreed to marry William so he won't have to go to Vietnam.  She will get $135 per month until William is safely serving in Germany.  After that, the marriage can be annulled.  But, as the movie goes on, Diane genuinely falls in love with William.  John Casey (Anthony Hopkins) and Nelson (Harry Belafonte) are two older gentlemen who enjoy spending their days playng chess at the hotel.  John, a former hotel doorman, has claimed to have seen many prominent people at the hotel, including JFK, Truman, and FDR.  Virginia Fallon (Demi Moore) and her husband Tim Fallon (Emilio Estevez) are staying at the hotel.  Virginia is a lounge singer who is battling alcoholism.  June 4 is to be her last night of performing at the Ambassador, and she's supposed to introduce Robert F. Kennedy.  Dwayne (Nick Cannon) is an assistant working on the Kennedy campaign.As the day unfolds, these lives will forever be changed as Robert Kennedy makes his appearance at the hotel.  Another uninvited guest arrived at the hotel immediately before Kennedy.  His name: Sirhan Sirhan (David Kobyantsev)  That evening, as the guests are gathered in the main hotel ballroom, Kennedy is whisked away through the kitchen after giving his California victory speech, but, hiding among the well-wishers is Sirhan, who fired several shots at Kennedy.  Several in the crowd were struck, including William and Timmons, but Kennedy was mortally wounded.  He died at Good Samaritan hospital on June 6, 1968.Director Emilio Estevez has done a magnificent job in describing the events which took place at the Ambassador hotel.  The all-star cast of actors assembled by Estevez did excellent jobs in their roles, and the viewer can almost feel the tension build as Sirhan Sirhan walked through the front door.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  I'm a big fan of historical movies, and this movie is one of the best I've seen in quite a while.

It also reminded me of the dreadful Irwin Allen disaster movies of the seventies -- except that the only disaster on display here is the movie itself.I kept expecting Shelly Winters to rise from the dead and take the proceedings here to a new level of camp, but instead a cast of actors I used to respect take the honors.

I assume that they did indeed read this script before they agreed to take part...This movie in large part explains why so many average Americans hate the rich, self-absorbed, and self-indulgent names in Hollywood when they choose to get involved in politics.The only way I can recommend viewing this pretentious piece of twaddle is to follow the example of the two young characters in the film who drop acid.

I've seen THE WAY probably 30 times and am awed by what he accomplished with that film.  So, as I said, I was ready to like Bobby.  The problem was that it just didn't quite get the job done.  It may be that there were simply too many characters whose stories he was trying to tell or, my personal opinion, that he wasted too much time on the drug addicts who should have been there just for maybe one scene to show what stupid people were doing to their bodies at the time and too much time on the scenes of the campaign workers.  After all, it's a given that they were there.  Most of the people seemed to have been put into the movie so that he would have a huge all star cast.  Lesser known or unknown actors could have done those roles as well and probably better because with these actors one was always consciously watching the actor instead of the person they were portraying. Gee, there are Anthony Hopkins and Harry Belafonte sitting there talking to each other about nothing.  Gee, there is Sharon Stone looking grotesque in that makeup. Lindsay Lohan looked terrible.  I have no idea why she became so famous then infamous.  Certainly not because of her looks.  She is the most freckled woman I've ever seen and the dark makeup does not cover it up.  She did a good job in the role but a younger, less tired looking girl would have been much better for the role. Lohan looked 30.  None of the stories were explored enough for one to get interested in it.  Why was the young telephone operator sleeping with the very aged looking Manager of the hotel.  How did his wife who is for some unknown reason a beauty operator in the hotel (???)find out about it. Why does Estevez's character have the same name as his famous wife.  Surely she didn't take his name.  Is it the usual and obvious insult to the husband of a star to call him Mr. and her last name. Again???? Near the end was he really stalking out of the hotel carrying the dog - leaving her??? I think it was a good idea that just never developed into what it should and could have been.  What totally uninteresting thing was going on between the Martin Sheen character and his wife.  Stories just not developed and too many stories for the time allowed in the movie.

There is no actor portaying Kennedy--there are film clips of him campaigning and giving speeches.  The cast is a veritable who's who of Hollywood.  Don't blink or you might miss Harry Belafonte, Lindsay Lohan, Aston Kutcher, Demi Moore, Elijah Wood, or a host of other famous entertainers appearing as ""regular folks"" at the hotel.The beginning of the movie is a series of vignettes which depict the everyday activities of a host of people who witness the shooting in the summer 1968.  Interspersed with these scenes are film clips of Kennedy speaking and campaigning.  The movie wanders a bit, but at the climax, everything and everyone focuses on the tragic event of the day.I was a young mother with a small son when the shooting occurred and this movie brought back some sad and powerful memories of a time when three important leaders, Jack Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Bobby Kennedy, were shot.

A wave of violence and assassination, inflamed by the ongoing war in Vietnam, had engulfed the USA in a drowning tide of blood, while the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. seemed to dissolve at one blow our hopes for nonviolent resistance.  In this atmosphere many felt that Bobby Kennedy was America's last best hope.  This aspect of the movie is well done, as is the ins and outs of the campaign trail and the hard work performed by RFK's staffers.  What's bad is some of the ""symbolism"" the movie employs, it really makes you groan sometimes.  Lawrence Fishburne has it the worst I think, as a pastry chef in the hotel kitchen who has learned to keep his ""eyes on the prize,"" a man with his own sense of inner dignity and a great recipe for Cherry cobbler.  When he hears that Freddy Rodriquez as a Latino busboy has to work a double shift under orders from tough, weary, wisecracking boss Christian Slater, Fishburne commiserates and declares that Freddy is the ""once and future king,"" transferring to Latinos all the racial anguish felt by blacks up to this moment of handover.  When he writes the words ""once and future king"" on the white glazed kitchen wall you know it won't be long before the words are spattered with blood.Even worse perhaps is the seemingly unending dialogue between Harry Belafonte and Anthony Hopkins as two old codgers, apparently reprising the duller parts of Harold Pinter's NO MAN'S LAND with their dreary memories of days gone by.  The whole audience groans whenever the camera takes you to the hotel lobby chairs where these two have parked themselves for a chat.  Awful, just awful!  I never did understand who or what Martin Sheen and Helen Hunt were playing.  Were they wealthy Democratic supporters?  Art collectors?  Mental patients?  Or were they in the conspiracy to assassinate RFK?Heather Graham was good but then her part melted away to nothing.  When she reappears looking shocked at the end you can barely remember who she was in the picture.  William Macy, Joshua Jackson, Sharon Stone (looking bizarre stretched out, like Elastic Man), Demi Moore, Lindsay Lohan, even Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Elijah Wood, were all very good and you could see why they must have all taken big salary cuts to play these juicy roles.  Best of all Brian Geraghty perfectly embodies the late 60s look as a Kennedy staffer trying to score dope from Ashton Kutcher, while Shia LaBoeuf as Geraghty's pal is perfectly hilarious tripping on acid, stripping down to reveal the most delectable part of his anatomy just like we all did back in the day.

As a young boy Estevez met RFK and clearly the assassination has resonated in his psyche.  In one of the bonus features Estevez talks about wanting to find out about the other five people who were shot that night, which would make ""Bobby"" akin to Thornton Wilder's ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey.""  Officially Sirhan Sirhan fired eight bullets, three of which struck Kennedy.  However, there are several problems with this approach.  The first is that a lot of people do not know that others were hit besides RFK that night.  If I had known I certainly did not remember as I watched this film, which means I was not trying to figure out who the fateful five would be.  Second, Estevez creates fictional counterparts for those five people and does not attempt to maintain key parallels between fact and fiction.  For example, one of those wounded was an ABC News producer, and none of the almost two dozen characters that make up the mosaic of ""Bobby"" are reporters.There are some historical aspects to what we see: one of the actual victims, Elizabeth Evans, had bent over to retrieve a shoe she had lost for a moment when she was hit in the forehead by a bullet.  Obviously that idea is paralleled in the film, but that character is not a Democratic Party activist and friend of Pierre Salinger.  A teenage Kennedy volunteer was one of those shot, but there is no reason to believe that he spent the day doing something other than canvassing for the candidate, as the film suggests.  Another concern is that with the conceit of using actual footage of RFK from that fateful day providing a strong sense of verisimilitude, these fictional elements are given the ring of historical truth.  Finally, despite the visual evidence to the contrary and the desired attendant irony, the scroll at the end of the film admits that all five of the people shot that night survived.  By that point Estevez has taken his fictional elements too far and essentially derailed his film by clearly suggesting otherwise.This is not to say there are not worthwhile aspects to ""Bobby.""  The strongest part of the film has to do with Jos&eacute;, the character played by Freddy Rodriguez, who is based on Juan Romero, the hotel busboy who had just shaken hands with RFK when he was shot (it is Romero who is shown holding Bobby's hand in the photographs and who gave him a rosary).  Jos&eacute; has tickets for the Dodgers game that name where Don Drysdale will be pitching his (then) record sixth shutout in a row, but because of the Kennedy celebration he has to work a double shift.  His interaction with sous chef Edward Robinson (Laruence Fishburne), a character inspired by a piece of graffiti on the wall of the kitchen at the Ambassador Hotel, is at the core of this film.There are lots of familiar faces making up the cast here, from Estevez's father Martin Sheen to Oscar winners Anthony Hopkins and Helen Hunt.  I thought the two that stood out the most besides Rodriguez and Fishburne were Nick Cannon playing Dwayne, a young African-American campaign worker who is told he will get a chance to meet the candidate, and Lindsay Lohan as Diane, a young woman who is marrying William (Elijah Wood) to keep him out of the war (and, yes, the irony that a film that reminds us of what was lost when RFK was assassinated would also bear testament to the acting career Lohan has thrown away with her recent escapades is not lost on me either).Despite these considerable objections I round up on ""Bobby"" because it does work as an elegy for RFK, as reinforced by the song during the end credits, ""Never Gonna Break My Faith,"" written by Bryan Adams and sung by Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige, and the Harlem Boys Choir.  Rarely does a song commissioned for the end of a film succeed as well as this one, especially in contrast to the use of Simon and Garfunkle's ""Sounds of Silence"" during RFK's speech right before the assassination (especially since there are references to ""The Graduate"" in the film which add to the ineffectualness of that particular song selection).  On balance this 2006 film is not as moving as it could be, but it has its moments, mainly because time and time again Estevez lets Bobby speak for himself.",4,"Despite problems with emulating Thornton

Yes, that's Bobby Kennedy, who we only meet in actual newsreel footage who is the central focus of the film.It's set on that fateful date at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where, after winning the presidential primary in California, Bobby Kennedy was shot to death.  And the big question that it leaves the audience with is to wonder how the world would have been different had Bobby Kennedy survived and went on to get elected President.  Alas, though, we will never know that.  All the film can do can try to bring back that day in history and how it might have affected the individuals who were there at the hotel.Emilio Estevez wrote and directed the film.  He also plays a small role.  He does a wonderful job bringing 1968 back to life.  There's a young woman who is marrying a young man she doesn't know well to keep him from Vietnam.  There's a hotel beautician whose husband cheats on her.  There's a kitchen worker who is more interested in the Dodger baseball game he has to miss because of the special event that night.  There a flamboyant actress whose career is on a downhill slide.  The acting is excellent although with a script like this, with so many stories and so many people, we only get glimpses of some fine performances.  The story tries to do a bit much because it moves fast and doesn't linger long on any one character.  This is both the film's weakness and its strength.I thought the film was well done.

1045253,A2BWZGD7S0JZQJ,B000MEYJHY,Martin P. McCarthy,"[26, 29]","Ostensibly, ""Bobby"" is supposed to be about the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in 1968. In telling that story, ""Bobby"" also tells the ""stories"" of 22 people who are all at the hotel for different purposes. ""Bobby's"" Robert Kennedy is portrayed by archived television footage and by a ""body double"" for some of the action at the Ambassador Hotel. The other 22 people are played by an ensemble cast including Emilio Estevez, who also directed the movie.To call the other 22 people ""characters"" would be misleading. For one, they are fictional. In addition, they are not developed as characters but serve more as archetypes - for example, Christian Slater plays the racist archetype, Elijah Wood plays the young man conscripted to go to Vietnam archetype, Ashton Kutcher (ofDude, Where's My Car?fame) plays the the counter-cultural druggie type,  Nick Cannon plays the simmering black rage archetype, etc. etc.The problem with the movie becomes twofold - with such a large and unwieldy cast of archetypes, ""Bobby"" pushes Bobby Kennedy to the function of ""backdrop"" instead of the other way around. The second is, the viewer cannot engage and cannot care for an archetype.This problems builds up to the climax of the movie when Bobby Kennedy is shot in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel. Throughout the buildup to the climax, the film cuts at various points from Bobby Kennedy archive footage, to its archetypes, to its Bobby Kennedy body double. When Bobby Kennedy is ultimately shot, Estevez goes overboard with quick cuts between archive footage and body double.Here, ""Bobby"" commits an unpardonable sin. On June 5, 1968 when Senator Robert Kennedy was shot in the kitchen at the Ambassador Hotel, 5 other people were wounded - William Weisel of ABC News; Paul Schrade of the United Auto Workers; Democratic Party activist Elizabeth Evans; Continental News Service reporter Ira Goldstein; and Kennedy campaign volunteer Irwin Stroll. In ""Bobby"" 5 of the fictional archetypes are killed/wounded - the two archetypes who shirked their responsibilities to campaign for Robert Kennedy and, instead, dropped acid with the Ashton Kutcher archetype; the racist archetype played by Christian Slater; the unliberated woman archetype played by Helen Hunt; and, most telling, the conscripted young man archetype played by Elijah Wood. While in ""real life"" all five of the people wounded with Bobby Kennedy survived, in ""Bobby,"" it is implied that the conscripted young man archetype dies and, it is VERY hard to miss the implication that because Sirhan Sirhan shot and killed Robert Kennedy, young men would be killed in Vietnam.I call the event unpardonable because of the hubris involved in deleting REAL LIFE people in favor of these archetypes. How would you feel if you were William Wiesel watching this movie and instead of seeing yourself (or even some anonymous person) wounded in the kitchen, you see the racist archetype? If the assassination of Bobby Kennedy was such an important event, why trivialize it by replacing the real humans wounded and suffering with fake archetypes?  This is ""dramatic license"" gone haywire.In making Bobby, it is clear that the intentions of Emilio Estevez were good.

It is very moving but yet sad as well, because of the untimely tragic happening that had happened to Bobby Kennedy, a man who was really hoping to make things better for the nation. The year was 1968. It was a year that the nation had encountered some negative occurrences. The war in Vietnam was worse than ever, people were getting high on drugs, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in April of that year, and, there was still racism and prejudice. The movie stars William H. Macy, who plays a manager of the famous, but now demolished Ambassador Hotel, Sharon Stone plays his beautician wife (who looks almost like Barbara Eden of I Dream of Jeannie and Nancy Sinatra), Helen Hunt, Martin Sheen, and a few other well known actors of today. What is really wonderful is the archival footage of Bobby giving speeches, and his famous speech in the Embassy Room of the hotel being meshed into the movie. It is so excellent that when you see the footage of his victory speech, you almost get the feeling that the crowd in the movie is watching him give it. From what I learned among one of the special features of this DVD is that some scenes were shot in the actual hotel one week before it was demolished. Thirty-six hours after the film was completed, the famous Ambassador Hotel was gone. When watching this movie, you almost get the feeling that you are actually in Los Angeles inside that hotel and in 1968. This movie is highly recommended for any person who is into famous events in U.S. history. Now, as for the special features, there is Bobby: The Making of an American Epic, Eyewitness Accounts from the Ambassador Hotel, and the Theatrical Trailer. The Eyewitness Accounts is wonderful to see, because it has people who were working with Bobby on his campaign and were also at the hotel on that now famous night in June, 1968. Descriptions of the campaign and the events from that night are also revealed in that feature as well. From what I learned, if Bobby had won the election in 1968 (and been inaugurated as President in January, 1969), things would have been different and possibly much better for the nation. The racial tensions and rioting would have ended, the war in Vietnam would have ended in 1969 instead of continuing on until 1972, the Watergate scandal would not have happened, and perhaps several other positive things would have been made possible by Bobby. When Bobby was shot, all of the nation's hopes and dreams were suddenly taken away from us. It was all over. Things became more chaotic and hectic for the next several years.

It was a good price considering it hadn't been long out on DVD. It's a period of time I know nothing about really. My parents couldn't really remember it. I figured it was worth a shot.What did I get? A tedious movie, filled with actors whose names you not only know, but it's like ""guess the movie star"". I ended up saying their names as they appeared on screen. And you can't really watch it without seeing the big name movie star on screen, and it's so obvious as well. All the news footage of Robert ""Bobby"" F Kennedy was necessary yes, but too much. And then because it was skipping back and forth between all the different characters, it just came across as a cheap reality TV show. And I've watched enough of them to know!It took me a while to figure out I wasn't watching a film about John F Kennedy, and then I couldn't remember if his brother got assassinated or not. Why would they release a movie if it didn't have a shocking ending? The ending, for me, is why I gave this movie three stars, instead of two. It's simply so well done, so brilliantly filmed, that at first you don't quite realise what is happening. It definitely made up for a somewhat tedious movie up until that point.I've read the reviews of people who say they were actually there or remember watching it on the news or hearing about it. I guess it affected me in a different way, because I'm twenty-something. If I'd been there, and was able to remember it, I would most likely be in my fifties minimum.

Having lived through the events I didn't feel the movie would do it justice but I was wrong.  The movie uses all real footage of the events leading up to June 4, 1968 and focuses on the hotel on that fateful day.  It is basically like the movie ""Crash"" and has many different stories going on at once inside the hotel where Kennedy's victory party and shooting took place.  Like Crash the stories come together when the Senator is shot just after he makes his victory speech.  There is a lot of inspirational footage, excellently interspersed throughout the film of Kennedy talking political issues both in California and about the country at large.  Many of his thoughts ring true today with the concerns about the war in Iraq, global warming and poverty.Each of the stories presented in the film are excellent by themselves and with so many big name actors, none have any bigger roles than any others.  My favorite is one where a young man came with his girlfriend to the hotel to get married so he would not be sent to the front-line in Viet Nam.  The girl's father calls him a coward, if that is the actual reason for the marriage.  Another good tale involves Harry Belefonte dealing with the onset of Alzheimer's disease, while his main goal is to win a game of chess before he dies. Also, there is a tale of a Mexicano kitchen worker who wants to take off because he has Dodger tickets on the night that Don Drysdale is going for the consecuitive shut-out innings record.

This film features a large ensemble cast that probably worked for scale to be in this movie. Sharon Stone plays a hairdresser who works at the Hotel. She fondly tells Lindsay Lohan's character that she is truly blessed to have found a man as handsome as her husband. Later in the movie we find out that her husband is William H. Macy? Not sure bout that one. Elijah Wood plays a man about to be married just so that he can avoid combat action in Vietnam. And Christian Slater plays a kitchen manager prone to insensitivities towards his minority kitchen staff.I enjoyed the movie but understand some of the critics feelings that the movie is to overreaching. There is no actual plot. Just everyday events in the lives of ordinary people- 2 aging gentlemen (Anthony Hopkins & Harry Belafonte) comment on life over a game of chess, The hotel manager is having an affair with the switchboard lady, the black and hispanic kitchen workers share a break together, 2 RFK campaign workers get high on acid and guests lounge at the pool. The only common thread they will share is that they will all be present for the senseless violence that ended Senator Kennedy's life on June 4, 1968. Only Laurence Fishburne is spared witnessing this traumatic event. He unexpectedly receives tickets to a Dodger game with Don Drysdale pitching in a big game(these practically unattainable tickets have a face value of $4.50 apiece!). Emilio Estevez acts in and directs the movie. He plays a former musician married to a fading starlet who is performing at the hotel (his father, Martin Sheen, also is featured in the movie).I would have to say that the jury is still out on Mr. Estevez's directorial skills. The footage that contributes mightily to making this a good film is not of his doing. The archives of Kennedy's speeches and public appearances are edited into the movie with amazing effect. The script focus on the hopes, fears and aspirations of ordinary people against the backdrop of the summer of 1968 which I found very interesting. Through these ordinary people we understand the excitement that RFK created as well as the anxiety that this country was feeling in that difficult year.

After Bobby, though, I think I might have.That may sound like a bit of an exaggeration, I know, but through this movie I learned new facts, felt a little more compassion for different people around me, and I remembered why love and peace are important. And I did all this without feeling manipulated or preached to by the movie at all. I suppose if all that doesn't make me a little bit better of a person, at least for the time being, no matter. I'm still so glad I sat in that theatre.In case you can't already tell, I loved this movie. I absolutely loved it. Part of it may be that I'm a sucker for any historical drama that takes place in America in the late 1960's. But beyond that, Bobby is simply a beautiful film. It doesn't have much of a central plot; instead it has more of a central location and event that ties all the stories and characters together, even if they never meet.The whole movie takes place on June 6, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel, the place where Bobby Kennedy was assassinated on that day. Bobby features an all-star ensemble cast, each playing a character connected to the hotel in some way and therefore present during the assassination. As the hours and scenes go by, you get to know each of the characters in individually, learning what life is like for each one. Whether it be the members of the hotel's kitchen staff (played by Christian Slater and Laurence Fishburne among other very talented actors), members of Kennedy's campaign team (Nick Cannon, Joshua Jackson), or simply a young couple getting married in the hotel that evening (Lindsay Lohan and Elijah Wood), each character is interesting to watch. Some have bigger parts, some are simply there to provide laughs. Not all of the characters are even concerned with Kennedy or the reception that will be held in his honor that night. They are simply there, living life, and their lives are their stories.This is actually a very unique tactic, and I think writer/director Emilio Estevez did a great job. In most ensemble dramas, each character or group of characters is living through a personal drama, and all these life-changing situations somehow intersect in an even more intense climax. In Bobby, not every character has a personal tragedy or milestone. But each person is alive, and therefore each storyline is important in its own right. And although these people's lives are connected at the end when the assassination occurs, this doesn't necessarily tie them together or speak to some unifying message. It simply makes the audience think about life and what we as humans do with our lives. It makes each person's day more meaningful, certainly, but I think what it does best is show how a tragedy like Bobby Kennedy's assassination is sometimes best understood when it is depicted in contrast with the lives lived around it. Bobby does this wonderfully. It's a beautiful movie, and one that is certain to affect each viewer in a unique way.The only thing I didn't love about Bobby was the occasional bit of awkward dialogue. For the most part, things are worded well, but at times a few of the characters have an unnatural way of speaking. This can make it seem like the acting in these particular scenes is sub par also, but considering the caliber of the cast, I think it's safe to say it's just the dialogue. However, by no means is this true for the majority of the movie. The only other aspect of Bobby that some people may not like is the adult content. This movie contains profanity, an assassination scene, and also some fairly graphic scenes depicting drug use and partial nudity.I'll say it one last time: I loved this movie. It made me laugh, and it made me cry. It is poignant without being preachy. It portrays human emotions and human stories and makes you feel like you were touched by these emotions and stories, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly why you were touched. This movie is so understated and so real that it affects you before you even realize you've been affected. Nothing about this movie shouts at the audience to pay attention or to adhere to a particular political or social value, but somehow a point comes across. Its art is in its subtlety. And for a historical event as politically, culturally, and socially charged as the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, a subtle movie is no small feat.MOVIEBLOG RECOMMENDS:Although not appropriate for children, Bobby is an excellent film that's well worth watching - and talking about afterward.AFTER THE SHOW:* What did you learn about American history from watching this film?

1045263,A232JQR4NBH9SX,B000MEYJHY,Nikola,"[2, 3]","Despite a Golden Globe nomination in the ""Best Movie"" category and a stellar cast, the movie ""Bobby"" hasn't been talked about much, its theatrical and DVD releases failing to attract many audiences. It's a pity, though, as ""Bobby"" is one of the year's best, blending emotional, historical and artistic value in its 120 minutes without any problems.The movie follows a (big) number of characters and their problems during the day Robert Kennedy was assassined. The stories of these characters are all equally engaging, each reflecting either an issue of the era, or a universal problem, which ultimately leads to the profound, yet non-preachy conclusion that the key to a better world is human kindness and honesty. Paul (William H. Macy), the owner of the AmbassadorHotel where the bloodshed will take place is trying love both his wife (Sharon Stone) and his affair (Angela). A fading singer (Demi Moore) finds comfort in alcohol instead of in her loving, significant other (Emilio Estevez). A young girl (Lindsay Lohan) is marrying a man she doesn't love (Elijah Wood) in order to save him from going to Iraq. A well-to-do couple (Martin Sheen and Helen Hunt) are trying to make sense of their lives. Two friends (Brian Geraghty and Shia LaBeouf) are introduced to the wonders of LSD by a hippie drug dealer (Ashton Kutcher). The ethnically-diverse kitchen staff (including Laurence Fishburne) confront racial prejudices. John Casey (Anthony Hopkins) is an aging doorman dealing with the aging process. The list goes on and on, but none of this numerous cast members ever loses momentum, and never is a plot line sacrificed for the sake of another (a miracle in a 22-lead cast). Finally, as the movie comes to its inevitable climax, one is overwhelmed by the emotional, political and cultural messages tastefully planted between the lines, and it takes a second viewing to truly appreciate what both Bobby the person and ""Bobby"" the movie tried to do - provide answers for not just the American society, but also for humanity.",5,A movie to own,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,2028,"['Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Movie', 'category', 'stellar', 'cast', 'movie', 'Bobby', ""n't"", 'been', 'talked', 'much', 'theatrical', 'DVD', 'failing', 'attract', 'many', 'audiences', 'pity', 'though', 'Bobby', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'blending', 'emotional', 'historical', 'artistic', 'value', '120', 'minutes', 'problems.The', 'movie', 'big', 'number', 'characters', 'problems', 'day', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'assassined', 'stories', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'engaging', 'reflecting', 'issue', 'era', 'universal', 'problem', 'ultimately', 'profound', 'yet', 'non-preachy', 'conclusion', 'key', 'better', 'world', 'human', 'kindness', 'honesty', 'Paul', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'owner', 'AmbassadorHotel', 'where', 'bloodshed', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'trying', 'love', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'affair', 'Angela', 'fading', 'singer', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'comfort', 'alcohol', 'instead', 'loving', 'significant', 'other', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'young', 'girl', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'marrying', 'man', ""n't"", 'love', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'order', 'save', 'going', 'Iraq', 'well-to-do', 'couple', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'lives', 'Two', 'friends', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'are', 'introduced', 'wonders', 'LSD', 'hippie', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'ethnically-diverse', 'kitchen', 'staff', 'including', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'confront', 'racial', 'prejudices', 'John', 'Casey', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'aging', 'doorman', 'dealing', 'aging', 'process', 'list', 'none', 'numerous', 'cast', 'members', 'ever', 'momentum', 'never', 'plot', 'line', 'sacrificed', 'sake', 'miracle', '22-lead', 'cast', 'Finally', 'movie', 'inevitable', 'climax', 'one', 'overwhelmed', 'emotional', 'political', 'cultural', 'messages', 'tastefully', 'planted', 'lines', 'second', 'viewing', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Bobby', 'person', 'Bobby', 'movie', 'tried', 'do', 'provide', 'answers', 'not', 'just', 'American', 'society', 'also', 'humanity']",N/A

1045266,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000MEYJHY,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[3, 5]","""Bobby"" follows the stories of several groups of people connected with the Ambassador Hotel on the day Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. It boasts an excellent pedigree: some wonderful performances given by a host of popular actors, and superlative direction and screenplay by Emilio Estevez.It's certainly the best movie I've seen so far this year, and one of the absolute best mainstream Hollywood movies I've seen in recent memory.Standout performances come from Anthony Hopkins as hotel doorman John Casey, Christian Slater as the racist food & beverages manager Timmons, an astoundingly sensitive turn by a newly all-grown-up Lindsay Lohan as young bride Diane, the always wonderful William H. Macey as hotel manager Paul, and Sharon Stone, proving once more her considerable talent as a serious actress (which is nice, after the abominable ""Basic Instinct 2"") as Paul's wife Miriam.Although, to be fair, every principal actor does a wonderful job in ""Bobby"", particularly movie newcomers like Freddy Rodriguez and Svetlana Metkina. ""Bobby"", themes and subtexts notwithstanding, is by itself a worthwhile showcase of great actors giving brilliantly-cast, moving performances.Emilio Estevez has done a superb job with the direction of the piece, too. The nice thing with ensemble movies like ""Bobby"" is that when a subplot comes along that bores you, at least you needen't spend too long there before you get to watch something more interesting. Happily, in ""Bobby"", this doesn't occur - even the more straightforward stories, such as those of alcoholic lounge singer Virginia Fallon, or married couple Jack and Samantha, are well-acted and scripted enough to be watchable, and come into their own in the closing moments of the movie, underpinning the real message of this seemingly loosely-structured film: following a leader blindly can lead to disaster.And it's in these subtexts that Esteves' talent behind the camera shines: there's no preaching or propaganda, there's no monloguing, and no cheese: every aspect of the production of ""Bobby"" is handled with such skill and class as to truly achieve all of the movie's aims. The different stories connect and affect each other with great subtlety, and as with any whole, fulfilling film, it's not possible to grasp all of the meanings in one viewing: ""Bobby"" is something you'll gain new insight into each time you see it.I can't recommend ""Bobby"" highly enough, it's a truly wonderful film filled with exceptional actors in exceptional roles, and a feast for lovers of drama and character-driven stories.

Certainly, the stellar cast stepped up to the task, though I wished Helen Hunt would've had a more remarkable return to the screen after so long. Most of the acting was great, and I thought the standouts were Sharon Stone, Freddy Rodriguez and Christian Slater.

We lost a lot of our country's potential in just a few short months.""Bobby"" actually doesn't talk so much about Kennedy as it details the plight of the regular folks around him. Racism is a serious issue--a young switchboard operator at the hotel has to scramble for food and the general manager of the hotel has to force his subordinate to give Black and Latino personnel time off to vote.  Drugs are rampant--two of his campaign workers move from smoking marijuana to LSD on sugar cubes in that one day. Even then, voting irregularities are a problem--they showed the punch ballot and the infamous 'chads.' Plus, there were police barricades at polling places in Watts that day to prevent Blacks from having full access to the polls.  And there was Vietnam.  Young men were fleeing the country or if they were a bit more conservative, marrying young women so they'd go to Germany instead of straight to the front.If anything the film showed the potential of a moment.

1045271,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000MEYJHY,Robert Moore,"[2, 2]","BOBBY features so many topnotch stars and is so well executed that it is impossible not to at least moderately enjoy.  But I found far too many of the stories told in the film a bit to flat for this to be a really good movie.  The film revolves around the events in the lives of a group of characters either staying or working at the Ambassador Hotel on the day that Bobby Kennedy was assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan.For me the failing of the movie is twofold.  First, it doesn't do an adequate job of relating the significance of Bobby Kennedy's death to the people populating the story.  For many of the characters the only connection was that they were on the scene in Kennedy's last moments, some dying along with him, others providing succor or aid to those injured.  But there isn't much connecting the enormous loss to the nation created by his death and the lives of the characters.  Personally, I found the excerpts from Kennedy's speeches to be devastating.  After four decades where the supporters of neoliberal policies (""neoliberal"" is the more precise name for the free market gospel that claims the lives of all people will be made better for allowing the market free reign, despite the overwhelming -- and continually mounting -- that in fact all neoliberal economic policies do is continually shift the national wealth more and more into the hands of a relatively small number of people at the expense of the vast majority of people) it is heartbreaking to hear the last politicians whose policies might have helped make America a better place for most Americans instead of just a few.  The loss of Kennedy is palpable in the film, but what it signifies for the characters is not.  The second huge problem is that the bulk of the individual stories are simply not very interesting.  I found myself failing to care for many of the individual characters, despite their being portrayed by an amazing array of actors.There is no questioning the enormous talent of the cast.  If the film has a star, it would be Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez, who plays a Latino (not, he insists, Mexican) kitchen worker.  It has been a good year for Rodr&iacute;guez, who previously was best known as one of the morticians in the great series SIX FEET UNDER.  Earlier this year he starred in the PLANET TERROR half of GRINDHOUSE.  This fall he will be appearing in some episodes of UGLY BETTY.  He is a really talented actor so it is great to see him getting some quality roles.  I also enjoyed Lindsay Lohan as the young girl who is marrying a guy so that he will be more likely to be stationed in someplace other than Vietnam when he enters the army.  I hope she can overcome her ongoing problems.  Unlike other troubled celebrities she actually has some talent.  But given her string of problems it might be that productions will find her harder or even impossible to insure.  Her only hope might be to attempt to resurrect her career by doing independent films.  Assuming she can overcome her substance abuse problems.  The rest of the cast is excellent, but given the limited nature of the script it is hard for anyone to really shine.  I enjoyed seeing Christian Slater, who seems to have virtually disappeared of late.  Demi Moore was excellent as an alcoholic singer.  Anthony Hopkins was Anthony Hopkins.  Shia Laboef was fun as a campaign worker freaking out on LSD and Ashton Kutcher was wonderfully flaky as a drug dealer.  But all in all I found myself embracing the film only in a few moments.I will end by saying that my friend I saw this with disliked it far more than I did.  Others I've talked to either felt like she did or thought it was great.  So the range of response to this film is a bit broader than most.",3,A star-studded cast is hampered by a less than stellar script,1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,3719,"['BOBBY', 'features', 'so', 'many', 'topnotch', 'stars', 'so', 'well', 'executed', 'impossible', 'not', 'least', 'moderately', 'enjoy', 'found', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'told', 'film', 'bit', 'flat', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'film', 'events', 'lives', 'group', 'characters', 'staying', 'working', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'day', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Sirhan', 'Sirhan.For', 'failing', 'movie', 'twofold', 'First', ""n't"", 'do', 'adequate', 'job', 'relating', 'significance', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'death', 'people', 'populating', 'story', 'many', 'characters', 'only', 'connection', 'was', 'were', 'scene', 'Kennedy', 'last', 'moments', 'dying', 'along', 'others', 'providing', 'succor', 'aid', 'injured', ""n't"", 'much', 'connecting', 'enormous', 'loss', 'nation', 'created', 'death', 'lives', 'characters', 'Personally', 'found', 'excerpts', 'Kennedy', 'speeches', 'be', 'devastating', 'four', 'decades', 'where', 'supporters', 'neoliberal', 'policies', 'neoliberal', 'more', 'precise', 'name', 'free', 'market', 'gospel', 'lives', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'better', 'allowing', 'market', 'free', 'reign', 'overwhelming', 'continually', 'mounting', 'fact', 'neoliberal', 'economic', 'policies', 'do', 'continually', 'shift', 'national', 'wealth', 'more', 'more', 'hands', 'relatively', 'small', 'number', 'people', 'expense', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'heartbreaking', 'hear', 'last', 'politicians', 'policies', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'make', 'America', 'better', 'place', 'most', 'Americans', 'instead', 'just', 'few', 'loss', 'Kennedy', 'palpable', 'film', 'what', 'characters', 'not', 'second', 'huge', 'problem', 'bulk', 'individual', 'stories', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'found', 'failing', 'care', 'many', 'individual', 'characters', 'being', 'portrayed', 'amazing', 'array', 'actors.There', 'questioning', 'enormous', 'talent', 'cast', 'film', 'star', 'would', 'be', 'Freddy', 'Rodr', 'iacute', 'guez', 'who', 'Latino', 'not', 'Mexican', 'kitchen', 'worker', 'been', 'good', 'year', 'Rodr', 'iacute', 'guez', 'who', 'previously', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'one', 'morticians', 'great', 'series', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'Earlier', 'year', 'starred', 'PLANET', 'TERROR', 'half', 'GRINDHOUSE', 'fall', 'will', 'be', 'appearing', 'episodes', 'UGLY', 'BETTY', 'really', 'talented', 'actor', 'great', 'see', 'getting', 'quality', 'roles', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'marrying', 'guy', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'stationed', 'someplace', 'other', 'Vietnam', 'when', 'army', 'hope', 'can', 'overcome', 'ongoing', 'problems', 'other', 'troubled', 'celebrities', 'actually', 'talent', 'given', 'string', 'problems', 'might', 'be', 'productions', 'will', 'find', 'harder', 'even', 'impossible', 'insure', 'only', 'hope', 'might', 'be', 'attempt', 'resurrect', 'career', 'doing', 'independent', 'films', 'Assuming', 'can', 'overcome', 'substance', 'abuse', 'problems', 'rest', 'cast', 'excellent', 'given', 'limited', 'nature', 'script', 'hard', 'anyone', 'really', 'shine', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'who', 'have', 'virtually', 'disappeared', 'late', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'was', 'excellent', 'alcoholic', 'singer', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Shia', 'Laboef', 'was', 'fun', 'campaign', 'worker', 'freaking', 'out', 'LSD', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'flaky', 'drug', 'dealer', 'found', 'embracing', 'film', 'only', 'few', 'moments.I', 'will', 'end', 'saying', 'friend', 'saw', 'disliked', 'far', 'more', 'did', 'Others', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'felt', 'did', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'range', 'response', 'film', 'bit', 'broader', 'most']",N/A

For this movie, rather than doing a straightforward biopic, Estevez had the great idea of treating the Ambassador Hotel like a microcosm of America, so you have the wealthy guests, the workers in the kitchens, the management of the hotel and some lowly switchboard operators, plus a drug dealer, some campaign workers, and a young couple doing whatever they can to keep away from the worst of the war. Anthony Hopkins plays a retired doorman of the hotel, thus representing the soul of the place itself, and through him you get a sense of how the hotel began to die, too, on the day RFK was shot. Kennedy's speeches are used throughout, in stock footage and as voiceover, and what's amazing today is how he never once sounds as if he's giving a speech: he is completely genuine, completely compassionate, and suddenly, yes, I came to understand exactly what was lost that day. Estevez talked about a Greek journalist who said to him ""This is the America that we miss,"" and as soon as he said it, everyone in the audience started to nod: yep, that was how we felt about it too.

1045273,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000MEYJHY,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[7, 9]","Rather than a morose-self-indulgent 'remember the good old days' period piece, this film presents the pivotal year of 1968 through the 'everyday' lives of people  who are working and/or otherwise moving around in Los Angeles's Ambassador Hotel. Uniting all of them of course is presence when Senator Robert F. Kennedy gets shot moments only after winning the California Democratic primary.Because Robert Kennedy championed everyday people, I found it only fitting that a film championing his attempt to make the world a better place for all examine it through the lives of everyday people.The frenzied camera direction during the remaining moments of this script takes audiences very personally into the utter devastation wrought both into the immediate and long-term subsequent course of history.Christian Slater really stood out as Timmons, the low-life boss who seems to have it in for a minority kitchen staff; I've never actually been creeped out by any of his characters until now. I am also very glad that I've never actually worked for a boss as slimy as him.As opposed to the goofy 'party' types which he's played in prior roles, Ashton Kutcher's part as Fisher, the hippie who helps two young and over-stressed Kennedy campaign workers squander their time tripping indicates his actual acting capabilities. Kutcher is infact capable of doing more than comedic fluff. What happened to the cat was gross, but anybody who has ever worked in the unending and high-stress environment of a political campaign--regardless of era--will find the constant state of tension the 'grunts' toil under even for a cause they believe in being very accurately portrayed during this film segment.The film hints at women's issues Samantha (Helen Hunt), the wife of a hotel bigwig firmly reminds her husband that it is 1968 and not 1920--after he finishes up a self-satisfied directive how he expects her to cast her ballot in this election. She loves him, but wants to be able to make up her own mind.  Starlet Virginia Fallon (Demi Moore) ultimately confesses to Miriam Ebbers (Sharon Stone), the beauty salon worker/wife of Hotel Manager Paul Ebbers (William H, Macy) that she is not actually a nice person because she drinks and she realizes this--but keeps up the charade anyways. Regularly hearing this and other confessions from women about the imperfections beneath the facade of their oh-so perfect lives hints Miriam Ebbers subsequently will take up feminist causes.Voting irregularities and disparities were another area of imperfection with current relevance for me and many of the other audience members. Since the 'new' technology being championed by this film characters ultimately would once again become outmoded by the 21st century, this script has a very enduring message. Living in a democracy does not actually mean much unless people are able to actively and freely participate in it as they freely choose.Watching this movie immediately after having worked on three political campaigns, the scene where Kennedy's Los Angeles campaign learns about police checkpoints having been set up only in black area neighborhoods in 1968 still honestly shocked me.Most characters did gel nicely with each other throughout the film, with one glaring exception. Poor Svetlana Metkina got saddled with the role of ' visiting foreign journalist'---and as opposed to being `exotic' or `suave' ala a `Bond Girl' she repeatedly appeared `nave' and `lost'.  Undoubtedly this was portrayed both because Kennedy himself was a staunch anti-communist and communism itself now is no longer the Eastern European governing format, but since the character honestly came across as being so ridiculous in so many scenes for such an important press event, this screenplay still would have worked very well without her presence.However, 'Bobby' still gets my vote for a good Thanksgiving 2006 holiday movie!",5,Wins the campaign for great holiday films,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,3887,"['Rather', 'morose-self-indulgent', ""'remember"", 'good', 'old', 'days', 'period', 'piece', 'film', 'pivotal', 'year', '1968', ""'everyday"", 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'working', 'and/or', 'otherwise', 'moving', 'around', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'Uniting', 'course', 'presence', 'when', 'Senator', 'Robert', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'shot', 'moments', 'only', 'winning', 'California', 'Democratic', 'primary.Because', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'championed', 'everyday', 'people', 'found', 'only', 'fitting', 'film', 'championing', 'attempt', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'examine', 'lives', 'everyday', 'people.The', 'frenzied', 'camera', 'direction', 'remaining', 'moments', 'script', 'audiences', 'very', 'personally', 'utter', 'devastation', 'wrought', 'immediate', 'long-term', 'subsequent', 'course', 'history.Christian', 'Slater', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'Timmons', 'low-life', 'boss', 'who', 'have', 'minority', 'kitchen', 'staff', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'been', 'creeped', 'out', 'characters', 'now', 'am', 'also', 'very', 'glad', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'worked', 'boss', 'as', 'slimy', 'him.As', 'opposed', 'goofy', 'types', 'played', 'prior', 'roles', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'part', 'Fisher', 'hippie', 'who', 'two', 'young', 'over-stressed', 'Kennedy', 'campaign', 'workers', 'squander', 'time', 'tripping', 'actual', 'acting', 'capabilities', 'Kutcher', 'infact', 'capable', 'doing', 'more', 'comedic', 'fluff', 'What', 'happened', 'cat', 'was', 'gross', 'anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'worked', 'unending', 'high-stress', 'environment', 'political', 'campaign', 'regardless', 'era', 'will', 'find', 'constant', 'state', 'tension', ""'grunts"", 'toil', 'even', 'cause', 'believe', 'being', 'very', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'film', 'segment.The', 'film', 'hints', 'women', 'issues', 'Samantha', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'wife', 'hotel', 'bigwig', 'firmly', 'husband', '1968', 'not', '1920', 'up', 'self-satisfied', 'directive', 'how', 'cast', 'ballot', 'election', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'Starlet', 'Virginia', 'Fallon', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'ultimately', 'Miriam', 'Ebbers', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'beauty', 'salon', 'worker/wife', 'Hotel', 'Manager', 'Paul', 'Ebbers', 'William', 'H', 'Macy', 'not', 'actually', 'nice', 'person', 'drinks', 'up', 'charade', 'anyways', 'Regularly', 'hearing', 'other', 'confessions', 'women', 'imperfections', 'facade', 'oh-so', 'perfect', 'hints', 'Miriam', 'Ebbers', 'subsequently', 'will', 'take', 'up', 'feminist', 'causes.Voting', 'irregularities', 'disparities', 'were', 'area', 'imperfection', 'current', 'relevance', 'many', 'other', 'audience', 'members', ""'new"", 'technology', 'being', 'championed', 'film', 'characters', 'ultimately', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'become', 'outmoded', '21st', 'century', 'script', 'very', 'enduring', 'message', 'Living', 'democracy', 'not', 'actually', 'mean', 'much', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'actively', 'freely', 'participate', 'freely', 'choose.Watching', 'movie', 'immediately', 'having', 'worked', 'three', 'political', 'campaigns', 'scene', 'where', 'Kennedy', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'campaign', 'police', 'checkpoints', 'having', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'only', 'black', 'area', 'neighborhoods', '1968', 'still', 'honestly', 'shocked', 'me.Most', 'characters', 'did', 'gel', 'nicely', 'other', 'film', 'one', 'glaring', 'exception', 'Poor', 'Svetlana', 'Metkina', 'got', 'saddled', 'role', 'visiting', 'foreign', 'journalist', '-and', 'opposed', 'being', 'exotic', 'suave', 'Bond', 'Girl', 'repeatedly', 'appeared', 'nave', 'lost', 'Undoubtedly', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'staunch', 'anti-communist', 'communism', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'Eastern', 'European', 'governing', 'format', 'character', 'honestly', 'came', 'being', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'important', 'press', 'event', 'screenplay', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'presence.However', ""'Bobby"", 'still', 'vote', 'good', 'Thanksgiving', '2006', 'holiday', 'movie']",N/A

Too often we excuse those who are willing to build their lives from the shattered dreams of other human beings.

For when you teach a man to hate and to fear his brother, when you teach that he is a lesser man because of his color, or his beliefs or the policies he pursues, when you teach that those who differ from you, threaten your freedom or your job or your home or your family, then you also learn to confront others not as fellow citizens, but as enemies. To be met not with cooperation but with conquest, to be subjugated, and to be mastered. We learn at last to look at our brothers as aliens. Alien men with whom we share a city, but not a community.

She asserted  that each life has meaning, that what we do is important and we need to keep doing it in order to improve the well-being of our fellow man. Bobby reminds me of her encouragement to make an effort, to keep trying, to begin again after defeat.

1045276,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000MEYJHY,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 2]","Let's not mince words: Emilio Estevez's ""Bobby"" is a love letter to Robert F. Kennedy and  the 1960s. It's a passion project for Estevez, who was a 6-year-old when on June 4, 1968, when Sirhan Sirhan shot RFK in the kitchen of Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel. When conservative talk show hosts carp about the liberal elite, it's a guy like Estevez and his dad, Martin Sheen.So don't look for an objective portrait of RFK. Politically, ""Bobby"" shows one side. But it shows those politics with sincerity and attention to detail, and while critics have taken their collective red pens to the movie, also know this: At my Thanksgiving Day screening, nobody moved when the movie ended. For five minutes.Maybe the whole audience was full of bleeding-heart Democrats. Maybe they were too stuffed with turkey and pumpkin. Or maybe ""Bobby"" is actually a powerful experience. It's certainly well-crafted, and count me as surprised: Estevez has directed before, - most recently ""CSI: NY"" -  but not with this scope and never with this skill.His camera swoops in and around the Ambassador Hotel in the 16 hours before RFK's assassination, following ten different plotlines and leading them all to the ballroom where RFK gives his victory speech after winning the California Democratic primary and just before the shooting.The higher-profile stories include:  a singer (Demi Moore) and her manager husband (Estevez); a girl (Lindsay Lohan) marrying a high school friend (Elijah Wood) to keep him from Vietnam; the hotel manager (William H. Macy), his hairdresser wife (Sharon Stone) and employee mistress (Heather Graham); a Latino dishwasher (Freddy Rodriguez) who has to give up his baseball tickets to the chef (Laurence Fishburne) because racist his boss (Christian Slater) scheduled him for a double shift; and a former doorman (Anthony Hopkins) still walking the hotel lobby.We meet some of RFK's young political team, including two staffers who blow off canvassing to take an LSD trip. We never specifically learn RFK's policies, nor does an actor play him, but Estevez uses the candidate's speeches and archival footage to give us a sense of the man. Through some of the plots we get the idea of what RFK represented: The last best hope after the death of JFK, Malcom X and Martin Luther King.Hope for what? ""Bobby"" never exactly articulates, but to listen to the speech that runs over the movie's last ten minutes, we get the sense that RFK, after playing the tough-minded Attorney General in his brother's administration, changed into one of the last national politicians more interested in the soul of America than its prosperity or power.The characters, all trapped in their personal dramas, reflect a need for that undefined aura. Stone and Moore share a particularly effective scene. Lohan and Wood develop nice chemistry. Hopkins does his thing while Slater strikes a note between ignorance and cruelty that provides understanding for his character, if not empathy. Fishburne is allowed the movie's most eloquent monologues.If the review seems like a list, it's because the movie relies a little too heavily on its giant, excellent cast. Estevez sticks  in a couple pointless subplots, one involving a businessman (Sheen) and his trophy wife (Helen Hunt) shopping for black shoes. At yet ""Bobby"" never loses its footing or hurries itself. Estevez pulls off a tricky, powerful ending that takes the inevitable shooting to surprising depths .It's not the most rigorous examination of a politician, nor will it haul off many awards, but ""Bobby"" is a fine, fair work of emotional resonance.",3,"A sincere, one-sided look at RFK.

It is a lot better than one may expect.I remember this movie came on cable, I sat down on the couch, had no intention on watching the whole thing and yet, the movie was captivating, and could not stop watching.As a movie about Bobby Kennedy...it is not. This is sort of like a ""Love Boat"" situation with several stories being interwoven all with the common denominater of the campaign of Bobby Kennedy. The stories all invlove the hotel that Kennedy ultimately was shot at. Most of these vignettes work and they are interesting. Emilio Estevez does a good job pulling the most interesting aspects of the little subplots.There's Lindsey Lohan offering to marry somebody to keep him out of the Vietnam draft. I think that Lindsey, as a person, is a disgusting person yet she's pretty engrossing in this role.There's a whole hotel/kitchen scene where 2 Latins are working the kitchen and enammered by a baseball game while there is an older mentor, Laurence Fishbourne, giving them advice and biggoted Christian Slater manages the place.There's a soap opera going on with a hotel's beauty salon and infidelity.There's Nick Cannon and Shia La Beouf as two Kennedy volunteers who have an acid trip.All of this intertwines as makes each charactor pertinent to the shooting of Kennedy.If you have not seen the movie, then the above descriptions (remember, I'm not any kind of real journalist...just a dude that likes to write rambling reviews) may not seem that cinematic but these episodes work and this is a fast paced drama that culminates in the inevitable assassination of Kennedy.I think this movie did not fare that well in the theaters however, on the small screen, it's a pretty effective drama that utilizes it's star studded cast in a proper manner.",3,This is a decently entertaining movie,1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,1826,"['sprawling', 'unorganized', 'undefineable', 'movie', 'somehow', 'lot', 'better', 'one', 'may', 'expect.I', 'remember', 'movie', 'came', 'cable', 'sat', 'down', 'couch', 'had', 'intention', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing', 'yet', 'movie', 'was', 'captivating', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'watching.As', 'movie', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'not', 'sort', 'Love', 'Boat', 'situation', 'several', 'stories', 'being', 'interwoven', 'common', 'denominater', 'campaign', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'stories', 'invlove', 'hotel', 'Kennedy', 'ultimately', 'was', 'shot', 'Most', 'vignettes', 'work', 'are', 'interesting', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'good', 'job', 'pulling', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'little', 'subplots.There', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'offering', 'marry', 'somebody', 'keep', 'Vietnam', 'draft', 'think', 'Lindsey', 'person', 'disgusting', 'person', 'yet', 'pretty', 'engrossing', 'role.There', 'whole', 'hotel/kitchen', 'scene', 'where', '2', 'Latins', 'are', 'working', 'kitchen', 'enammered', 'baseball', 'game', 'older', 'mentor', 'Laurence', 'Fishbourne', 'giving', 'advice', 'biggoted', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'place.There', 'soap', 'opera', 'going', 'hotel', 'beauty', 'salon', 'infidelity.There', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'Shia', 'La', 'Beouf', 'two', 'Kennedy', 'volunteers', 'who', 'have', 'acid', 'trip.All', 'intertwines', 'charactor', 'pertinent', 'shooting', 'Kennedy.If', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'then', 'above', 'descriptions', 'remember', ""'m"", 'not', 'kind', 'real', 'journalist', 'just', 'dude', 'write', 'rambling', 'reviews', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'cinematic', 'episodes', 'work', 'fast', 'paced', 'drama', 'inevitable', 'assassination', 'Kennedy.I', 'think', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'fare', 'well', 'theaters', 'however', 'small', 'screen', 'pretty', 'effective', 'drama', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'proper', 'manner']",N/A
1045278,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000MEYJHY,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 1]","I went to see this movie with limited information and just wanting to see how he and MLK connected. I was a little disappointed that MLK was only a brief overview of this movie, but it was interesting to find out the background of the people behind his presidential campaign. It caught me offguard that there was so much comedy (the psychodelic era with acid and people high out of their minds) and some drunk jokes. Only Ashton Kutcher could play that role as well as he did, with his crazy self.I had no idea who a lot of the other cast members were playing but through information given within the movie, it made me want to read more about him (and I plan to!). It was interesting to hear how Mexican people viewed themselves during the time of RFK in regards to discrimination, work rights, voting rights, and their connection with the Black community. There were a lot of things that I didn't expect to be in this movie that were there.Then we got to the end. Now, I knew RFK was murdered and from the background music, I knew it was coming. But when he was actually shot in this movie, I started blinking my eyes profusely. When the other murders were happening and I'd connected with these characters, I blinked even harder. I thought I was going to make it without crying, until I heard his speech. I can't remember how it went but I remember one part when he started talking about when one person is killed, how it effects the rest of the community and the tears just fell out of my eyes. I started thinking about a person very close to me who was shot for EXTREMELY unnecessary reasons and how it effected me, so I can only imagine how that room full of thousands of people felt to hear someone they'd just celebrated winning to be killed moments later. I left that movie and cried harder. It is so upsetting for people to take their own initiative of taking a person's life before it is their time to go, especially when they have such a positive touch on those around them.I don't think I could sit through that movie again because the end was so personal for me, but I have to say that those last twenty or so minutes were powerful spots.

1045281,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,B000MEYJHY,Some Gravity,"[10, 11]","United States History has always welcomed great leaders. And,out of all of those leaders,one of them happens to be,by far,Robert F. Kennedy. Unfortunately,the assasination of Robert F. Kennedy prevented RFK from being able to fully help,support,and protect America. However,if it was not for Robert F. Kennedy,America would not have been able to get through the problems that the 1960's found them encountering. Therefore,it is great to see homage being paid to Robert F. Kennedy with the film ""Bobby"".This film takes place in one entire day:June 4,1968,the day that Robert F. Kenendy was shot (he would not pass until two days after he had been shot). Here,actor/writor/director Emilio Estevez takes both fiction and nonfiction,and blends them all together in this film. There is a lot of footage of Robert F. Kennedy that is presented here. This footage shows Robert F. Kennedy,his opinion on the Vietnam War and Civil Rights,how to resolve the Vietnam War,and how to make Civil Rights successful. At the same time,the dream that Robert F. Kennedy had to reform America from the mess that it had been in from segregation is also presented,alongside footage of the Vietnam War and protests that were going on in America. And then,of course,you have a depiction of Robert F. Kennedy's assasination. Despite the fact that it is no happy way to end this film,it is presented in a clever manner that will keep viewers of this film wondering what will happen next.The fiction that is here fits in well with this film. It covers the kind of things that were going on in the era for which this film is set. The plot for the fiction in this film is mostly focused around the character of Paul (William H. Macy),the owner of the Ambassador Hotel who learns that he will have to ""pay for"" a large and previous mistake that he has made,and a previous decision to fire a man who works under him who he believes to be a racist,Darell Timmons(Christian Slater). And then,you have the relationship of William (Elijah Wood)and Diane (Lindsay Lohan),a young couple who,despite the problems they find themselves facing before their wedding (which puts a threat to the occurence of their wedding),end up getting married in order for William to not have to serve in the Vietnam War. I could go on and tell you about all of the other ""stories"" that are presented in this film,but by know,you get the point.It is worth noting that there were certain film fans and critics that did complain about a large portion of this film being fictional. But,despite that,keep in mind that a straightforward account of Robert F. Kennedy and his life,the efforts that he made for America following John F. Kennedy's assasination,as well as his campaign for President and his assasination,were all provided in a TV movie that was by the name of ""RFK"" and aired in 2002. So,even though that had nothing to do with this film,keep this in mind as you watch this film. Emilio Estevez NOT using that same formula in this film saves this film from being what it could have been had Estevez used the formula in ""RFK"" for ""Bobby""--plagarism.This DVD has a good amount of bonus feautures on it,as well. There is ""Bobby:The Making of An American Epic"". This gives viewers of ""Bobby""  a behind-the-scenes look into the making of this film,and interviews that happen to be strong and thorough. At the same time,it gives viewers/fans of this film good insight as to not only how the film was made,but also what lead to this film being made. Another good bonus feauture allows people to hear and learn eyewitness accounts of Robert F. Kennedy's assasination from people who were at the Ambassador Hotel the night that RFK was assasinated,and witnessed the assasination. And,a biography of Robert F.

I was expecting a biopic about Bobby Kennedy and instead I got a poignant, moving and powerful film about life in the ambassador hotel before he got shot. It looks at the lives of campaign volunteers, various hotel staff and customers, amongst others, as they go about their lives in the run up to Bobby's death. This film is inter-cut with real footage of Bobby and his speeches which really adds to to the overall effect of the film. The breadth and sheer quality of the cast is unbeatable. They all put in amazing performances, with Laurence Fishburne bringing particular gravitas to his role, but it is truly unfair to highlight any one actor as they are all outstanding. I was genuinely moved at the end and felt extremely choked up. I think it may help if you know a bit about the period and the Kennedy's to fully appreciate the film, but saying that, it shouldn't diminish your enjoyment if you don't.

1045284,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,B000MEYJHY,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[21, 25]","BOBBY is a masterpiece from writer/director/actor Emilio Estevez that gives us the America of 1968.  Specifically, it focuses on 24 very different characters staying at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, the day Robert Kenedy was shot after winning the California primary.  In a wise decision by Estevez, Kennedy plays himself in film clips as he talks about a government out of touch with its people.  A war in Vietnam is making too much money to be stopped, while segregation, women's rights, and poverty exist all across America.  For Estevez, Kennedy was clearly our hope for the future, and his murder robbed America of someone who could have been a brilliant President.The actors, billed alphabetically, are a who's who of young and old, former Brat Packers and MTV stars, veterans and party girls.  At the top is William H. Macy as Paul, the owner of the Ambassador Hotel.  Sharon Stone (stunning) is Miriam, his aging beautician wife; and Heather Graham is Angela, his switchboard operator lover.  Anthony Hopkins is John Casey, the retired hotel doorman who plays chess with his friend Nelson (Harry Belafonte) and recalls famous people who have stayed at the hotel.  Laurence Fishburne is Edward Robinson, head chef and baseball lover on a crucial baseball day for Don Drysdale.  Christian Slater is Timmons, a racist kitchen manager fired by Paul for not giving black and Hispanic kitchen staff time off to vote.  Martin Sheen (Estevez' real-life Dad) and Helen Hunt are Jack and Samantha, celebrating their tenth anniversary at the hotel.  Lindsay Lohan as Diane is marrying boyfriend Elisha Wood (as William, not David) without much love to save him from going to Vietnam.  Ashton Kutcher is a drug dealer turning two Kennedy campaigners on to LSD.  Pretty Mary Elizabeth Winstead steals two scenes as a coffee shop waitress named Susan.  Estevez is Tim Fallon, husband to alcoholic lounge singer Demi Moore as Virginia.  (The smoking actress unfortunately does a heavy-handed Marlboro red product placement in a beauty shop scene.)  And DAWSON'S CREEK's Joshua Jackson is Wade, a Kennedy campaign manager. And so it all goes, with everyone mingling inside the Ambassador very much like Robert Altman's cast in NASHVILLE (1975).  And, going further back, the Oscar-winning Best Picture, GRAND HOTEL (1932), which John Casey fondly recalls.Estevez is an amazingly accomplished filmmaker for someone so young.  How old was he in 1968?  Yet he captures the political and social landscape in America to perfection in his screenplay and gets stunning performances from such an eclectic cast of pros.  He has also worked to perfection with his crew, including composer Mark Isham and whoever arranged the period songs, production designer Patti Podesta, costumer  Julie Weiss, cinematographer Michael Barrett, and editor Richard Chew.  As stated before, Robert Kennedy plays himself in news clips, which was the only sensible thing to do here; Mike Wallace and Walter Cronkite have cameos as themselves.Bonus features are generous.  The 30 minute ""BOBBY: The Making of an American Epic"" goes behind the scenes with this impressive cast and talks about re-creating the June 1968 era.  There is also a 30 minute panel discussion with eyewitness accounts from five journalists and other people who survived that night at the Ambassador and chat candidly about it.  And there is a theatrical trailer.  BOBBY is presented on DVD in a 2.35 ""scope"" screen ratio, so I recommend you buy or rent the widescreen edition.  But please do see this very underrated and very powerful movie.  It did not deserve to die in two weeks in a theater with minimal publicity, and it does not deserve to go unseen on home video.  It is a movie you will remember.

1045288,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000MEYJHY,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 12]","IMDb lists the plot outline for ""Bobby"" as ""The story of the assassination of US Senator Robert Kennedy, on June 6, 1968, which centers around 22 people who were at the Ambassador Hotel where he was killed."" It is difficult for many films to make three central characters believable or interesting and it is nigh on impossible for most filmmakers to make 22 characters distinct and lifelike. I can think of two films in the last decade with large casts in which many of the characters were fully developed; Michael Mann's ""Heat"" and Paul Haggis' ""Crash"". Emilio Estevez's ""Bobby"" is an interesting idea, but it is not executed well.Written and directed by Estevez, the film follows the aforementioned twenty two people throughout the day leading to the assassination of the Senator. Most are employees of the famed Ambassador Hotel, some are guests. In order for the film to work, we have to have an idea of what makes a majority of these characters tick. Clearly, with this many people, this sort of thing has to happen quickly and make an impact. Also, the characters have to have a connection to the story or the idea of the film. Estevez, whose previous credits as a director include ""Men at Work"", starring Estevez and his brother, Charlie Sheen, as garbage-men in a wacky adventure, is working on a larger canvas here  and he doesn't seem able to control it. Some of the characters are interesting and we learn a little about them, others are mere names and actors playing them. Some of these characters have a connection to the main story, others don't. When you have this many characters, everything has to fit, like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle or we begin to wonder why we are wasting any time with them.Martin Sheen, Emilio's dad, plays a well-to-do guest at the hotel whose wife (Helen Hunt) has forgotten her good shoes. Ashton Kutcher plays a drugged out hippie who leads two of Kennedy's campaign workers on an LSD trip. Heather Graham plays a switchboard operator at the Ambassador who is having an affair with the hotel manager. Harry Belafonte plays a retired man who hangs around the hotel lobby. At one point, he disappears for a nap. I felt like joining him.Clearly, many of these actors wanted to be involved in the film to be involved in the film. They simply aren't on screen long enough to make an impact or advance their careers. I suspect many felt the message of this film was worth telling. More on that later.Then, there are a number of promising characters who don't really work. Nick Cannon plays a Kennedy Campaign worker who is talked up for a Secretary position. But rather than develop his character, he stops and delivers a monologue about the poll conditions in Watts. A more experienced actor may have been able to make the role seem more natural, less high school play. Estevez plays the emotionally abused husband of a fading, alcoholic singer. In each of his scenes, he has a blank expression plastered on his face. He must be thinking about all of those actors on his payroll. Laurence Fishburne plays a sous chef at the hotel. His main contribution to the story is an extended discussion with some of the Latino kitchen help, to discuss how he gets ahead in this unfair world.Then, there are a handful of people who are either interesting, connect to the story or both.William H. Macy plays the manager of the Ambassador Hotel. Throughout the day, he has to deal with a false fire alarm, various personnel issues, his wife (Sharon Stone) who works as the hairdresser in the hotel's salon and his new mistress, a switchboard operator played by Heather Graham. Anthony Hopkins plays a retired doorman at the Ambassador, trying to stay alive by hanging around the lobby, interacting with the employees and guests he has known his entire life. Hopkins' role doesn't seem to have a lot to do with the story, but let's face it, watching Hopkins read the phone book would be interesting; he always imbues his characters with so much history and personality. Sharon Stone plays the hairdresser at the hotel and interacts with a young bride (Lindsay Lohan) and the boozing singer (Demi Moore). Her character has a world weariness to her and she has a couple of interesting conversations, making her believable and watch-able. She explains to Lohan why she got married. ""He was the most handsome man in the world."" William H. Macy? He has charm, but the most handsome man in the world? And then there is Demi Moore who does a surprisingly good job of playing the fading chanteuse. She is not a likable character and is all the more convincing because she is so unlikable throughout.In more experienced hands, all of these characters (and the many I didn't even mention; Elijah Wood's soon to be drafted groom, Shia LeBeouf's drugged out campaign worker, Freddy Rodriguez's Dodgers fanatic busboy, would have a connection to the story, work together like the pieces of a puzzle. In Estevez's hands, many don't seem to have any connection to the main story, that of Kennedy's assassination.Because so many name actors appear in the film, I suspect many appeared for scale, simply because they wanted to be part of the story, part of the message. But what exactly is that message? Many of the monologues are intended to give a feeling of what life was like in that era. This would lead to Robert Kennedy. The filmmaker wants us to feel that Bobby would have fixed all of the problems we were having. I firmly believe this as well, but the filmmaker does not get the message across. He doesn't connect the dots. If someone has an exchange about something, we should also see part of this. Why can't we see footage of what is happening in Watts? Then hear Cannon's character discuss it? It would be much more compelling.Ultimately, because the characters don't make a lasting impact (i can't even remember most of their names) and the message is not artistically or convincingly portrayed, the film is a mess.""Bobby"" is a noble effort, but Estevez doesn't have the skill or the talent to pull off such a thing. He gets credit for trying, but that's about it.",2,"Estevez tries, real hard, but can't handle the scope.",1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,6088,"['IMDb', 'plot', 'outline', 'Bobby', 'story',

Yes, the audience knows the ultimate outcome of a movie like this, but Emilio Estevez manages to make the events leading up to the assassination something of a ""story within a story"" (or stories). This film simply cannot be cut and dry, and only feature the campaign trail and an assassination. Estevez drafted a star-studded lineup of actors to play parts of people less prominent, and it seems to work pretty well. We're treated to good acting that sort of fills in the perceived 'holes' that a film like this may have. If there's one frustrating element of this movie, it is its performance at the box office. I read that it only grossed 19 million dollars, and I have my theories as to how this movie came up short in revenue. Okay, how many teens are going to see a movie like this? How many teens even know who Bobby Kennedy is? This is sad, but true. For those who do know, how many of them care to see this movie? A movie like this probably isn't exciting enough. Simply put, this movie appeals to the older crowd and previous generation who may have been alive in 1968, and fully understood the social and political impact of the Kennedy assassinations. On the flip side, perhaps some older people are simply tired of the whole Kennedy mystique, and chose to skip the film.

Emilio Does a Great Job of capturing the Turmoil and Turbulence of the 1960's and does a great job at developing the various characters in this film who are all effected on that terrible day back in June 1968 when RFK was assassinated. One slight drawback is that there may have been too many characters and some were more interesting than others. Standout performances by Sharon Stone and Especially Demi Moore who to me gives the best performance of her career and should have been nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. I felt that Helen Hunt was wasted in the film, her big moment in the film was picking out shoes. I liked that Emilio used actual reall footage of RFK from that night as well as Walter Cronkite on tv giving out the election results. Also has a Great Soundtrack featuring music by Simon and Garfunkel as well as some Motown Tunes. Sometimes it was a little slow but for the most part Emilio does a Good job at taking the viewer to that moment that we all know is coming and it does give the viewer a sense of Forboding and dread.

1045292,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000MEYJHY,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 4]","""Bobby"" means of course Robert F Kennedy, but in ""Bobby"" Bobby himself appears mostly in archival footage. Emilio Estevez's film is actually about the people (largely fictional, I think) who happened to be at The Ambassador Hotel on the day he was assassinated. The film revolves around the lives of these people (more than 20 in number) loosely interconnected one another and you will see a glimpse of their lives as well as the possible future which might have been, if Robert Kennedy had not been assassinated.The idea of director Emilio Estevez (who also appears in the film and wrote the script) is ambitious, but has origin in another classic film ""Grand Hotel"" made in 1932, to which Anthony Hopkins' character refers early in ""Bobby."" Hotel is the place where people meet and part, and Estevez' choice of the multiple narratives that follow each set of characters one after another is nothing strange. After all, most people were there to meet Bobby.What disappointed me is not the absence of Bobby - he is there and you can feel his presence through the fervent dialogues from several characters and the speeches of Robert F Kennedy himself in addition to the real news footage - but the lack of originality in some of the characters we meet. It is only natural that if you create more than 20 characters, some of them would be weak and flat, but their background stories are a different thing. While some characters represent the social and cultural changes that were going on in the late 60s - such as Svetlana Metkina's Czech news reporter and Freddy Rodriguez's busboy, both are among the most memorable - others are just too familiar, even clich&eacute;d, like a drunken celebrity and a manager having a love affair with a switchboard operator.I will not write down all the names of the actors who gathered for his film. Some are good (William H. Macy can do no wrong), some OK, others miscast if not terrible. Except several hallucination scenes, Emilio Estevez refrains from showy camera works and even manages to generate suspense in the last 30 minutes. Probably the film's image of Bobby is one-sided, but the film itself is made with sincerity. Still I believe with less characters and more time to have them fleshed out, ""Bobby"" could have been better.",3,"One Fateful Day in 1968 Shot with ""Grand Hotel"" Style",1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,2273,"['Bobby', 'course', 'Robert', 'F', 'Kennedy', 'Bobby', 'Bobby', 'mostly', 'archival', 'footage', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'film', 'actually', 'people', 'largely', 'fictional', 'think', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'day', 'was', 'assassinated', 'film', 'lives', 'people', 'more', '20', 'number', 'loosely', 'interconnected', 'one', 'will', 'see', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'possible', 'future', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'assassinated.The', 'idea', 'director', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'wrote', 'script', 'ambitious', 'origin', 'classic', 'film', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'made', '1932', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'character', 'refers', 'early', 'Bobby', 'Hotel', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'meet', 'part', 'Estevez', 'choice', 'multiple', 'narratives', 'follow', 'set', 'characters', 'one', 'nothing', 'strange', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'there', 'meet', 'Bobby.What', 'disappointed', 'not', 'absence', 'Bobby', 'there', 'can', 'feel', 'presence', 'fervent', 'dialogues', 'several', 'characters', 'speeches', 'Robert', 'F', 'Kennedy', 'addition', 'real', 'news', 'footage', 'lack', 'originality', 'characters', 'meet', 'only', 'natural', 'create', 'more', '20', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'weak', 'flat', 'background', 'stories', 'are', 'different', 'thing', 'characters', 'represent', 'social', 'cultural', 'changes', 'were', 'going', 'late', '60s', 'such', 'Svetlana', 'Metkina', 'Czech', 'news', 'reporter', 'Freddy', 'Rodriguez', 'busboy', 'are', 'most', 'memorable', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'familiar', 'even', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'drunken', 'celebrity', 'manager', 'having', 'love', 'affair', 'switchboard', 'operator.I', 'will', 'not', 'write', 'down', 'names', 'actors', 'who', 'gathered', 'film', 'are', 'good', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'OK', 'others', 'miscast', 'not', 'terrible', 'several', 'hallucination', 'scenes', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'showy', 'camera', 'even', 'manages', 'generate', 'suspense', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'Probably', 'film', 'image', 'Bobby', 'one-sided', 'film', 'made', 'sincerity', 'Still', 'believe', 'less', 'characters', 'more', 'time', 'have', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Bobby', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",N/A

The cast was generally wonderful, with an all-star cast playing regular folks going about their business at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on the day that Robert Kennedy was assasinated in June, 1968.  Two of my favorites were Ashton Kutcher as a drug dealer turning two Kennedy staffers on to LSD, and Christian Slater as a rather unlikeable racist kitchen staff manager.  Kutcher's real-life wife Demi Moore played a soggy alcoholic singer who passes out in the beauty shop chair with a martini in one hand and a Marlboro in the other. It seemed as though writer/director Estevez was aiming at something like ""Babel"", ""Traffic"",  or an Altman picture in the way that the various stories danced around each other, all culminating with Kennedy's murder and the non-fatal wounding of a number of bystanders.  Some of the writing was actually quite poetic, as when Martin Sheen's character talks to his materialistic wife about the real values in their marriage.  That was really a great speech.  At other times, the writing felt contrived.2.  Estevez' handling of the period was patchy, but that is understandable, since he was only six or seven years old when Kennedy was shot.  Sometimes his ""take"" on Los Angeles 1968 was spot-on (as with the fabulous big hairpieces, earrings, and indoor smoking like chimneys), and sometimes way, way off.  As, for example,when a young kitchen staffer says ""I'm not a Mexican, I'm a Latino"" - my recollection is that the PC term used at that time in Southern California wasn't ""Latino"", it was ""Chicano"".  There were a number of other times when the language used was not accurate to the historical time frame, as when someone referred to ""getting down"", and (as all senior citizens know), people didn't start to get down until the 80's.I thought about going with 3 stars here, but the actors were generally just too good.

His wife, played by Sharon Stone, who runs the hotel beauty parlor, learns he is having an affair with a receptionist in his employ and confronts him.One of the film's most interesting conflicts unfolds when Laurence Fishburne exhibits coolness under fire despite being sharply needled by an employee as he seeks to defuse racial tensions among staffers.  The problem erupts between two Latino employees, one of whom preaches reconciliation while the other rails against an unjust system.The specter of the ongoing Vietnam War hangs tensely over the heads of young Kennedy staffers, while the rebelliousness of the period is displayed when two of them take a break from canvassing for local Kennedy votes to indulge in drug taking.Estevez's father, Martin Sheen, appears as a frustrated man seeking to find himself.  He seeks to escape tension by vacationing with wife Helen Hunt.  Tender moments arise after Helen wins Martin's admiration for her tennis playing skills and she afterwards seeks to console him and encourage a more confident and positive attitude.Two great veteran professionals of the industry also shine.  Anthony Hopkins is the soft-spoken, philosophical Ambassador head of security while Harry Belafonte plays his faithful chess-playing crony.Estevez appears as a Kennedy supporter who manages the career of his wife, the singer who is headlining the Ambassador's floorshow.  Demi Moore, who fears that her career is nearing an end and is pushing that fear toward realization with her heavy drinking, delivers a brilliant performance in a challenging role.The Kennedy message resonates through the film at periodic intervals, creating an interesting byplay of the progressive Senator's impact on society as evidenced by the Ambassador employees and patrons showcased along with their feelings toward him and belief that his election as President will energize America positively.The film also ties in an important event assuming great importance in Los Angeles on the same day that Kennedy is pitted against Senator Eugene McCarthy in the critically important California Democratic Presidential Primary.Rangy Dodger pitcher Don Drysdale, in his final full season, that same June 5 evening sets a major league record for scoreless consecutive innings pitched.  This achievement is mentioned as Kennedy in his victory speech congratulates Drysdale, a supporter of Kennedy's, for his impressive feat.Kennedy would enter the history books and be remembered as an idealist role model for progressives four decades after his death.  Drysdale would ultimately be voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame and continue to please fans until his death, while he was still a Dodger, serving in the broadcast booth.",5,A Fascinating Look at a Visionary and His Impact,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,3698,"['Emilio', 'Estevez', 'son', 'progressive', 'political', 'activist', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'fulfilled', 'dream', 'bringing', 'screen', 'Bobby', 'penetrating', 'look', 'night', 'June', '5', '1968', 'when', 'Senator', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'struck', 'dead', 'assassin', 'bullet', 'moments', 'making', 'victory', 'declaration', 'California', 'Democratic', 'Primary.Estevez', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'acted', 'Bobby', 'generated', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'lives', '22', 'people', 'Ambassador', 'Hotel', 'where', 'Kennedy', 'spent', 'evening', 'are', 'examined', 'context', 'turbulent', 'period', 'impact', 'generated', 'hotel', 'famous', 'guest.William', 'Macy', 'Ambassador', 'Kennedy', 'enthusiast', 'who', 'support', 'visibly', 'form', 'Kennedy', 'button', 'afternoon', 'turbulent', 'confrontation', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'racial', 'issues', 'when', 'restaurant', 'manager', 'insensitivity', 'African', 'Americans', 'Hispanics', 'marriage', 'problems', 'reach', 'major', 'crescendo', 'wife', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'who', 'hotel', 'beauty', 'parlor', 'having', 'affair', 'receptionist', 'employ', 'confronts', 'him.One', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'conflicts', 'unfolds', 'when', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'coolness', 'fire', 'being', 'sharply', 'needled', 'employee', 'defuse', 'racial', 'tensions', 'staffers', 'problem', 'two', 'Latino', 'employees', 'one', 'whom', 'preaches', 'reconciliation', 'other', 'rails', 'unjust', 'system.The', 'specter', 'ongoing', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'hangs', 'tensely', 'heads', 'young', 'Kennedy', 'staffers', 'rebelliousness', 'period', 'displayed', 'when', 'two', 'take', 'break', 'canvassing', 'local', 'Kennedy', 'votes', 'indulge', 'drug', 'taking.Estevez', 'father', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'frustrated', 'man', 'seeking', 'find', 'escape', 'tension', 'vacationing', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Tender', 'moments', 'arise', 'Helen', 'Martin', 'admiration', 'tennis', 'playing', 'skills', 'seeks', 'console', 'encourage', 'more', 'confident', 'positive', 'attitude.Two', 'great', 'veteran', 'professionals', 'industry', 'also', 'shine', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'soft-spoken', 'philosophical', 'Ambassador', 'head', 'security', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'faithful', 'chess-playing', 'crony.Estevez', 'Kennedy', 'supporter', 'who', 'career', 'wife', 'singer', 'who', 'headlining', 'Ambassador', 'floorshow', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'who', 'career', 'nearing', 'end', 'pushing', 'fear', 'realization', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'challenging', 'role.The', 'Kennedy', 'message', 'film', 'periodic', 'intervals', 'creating', 'interesting', 'byplay', 'progressive', 'Senator', 'impact', 'society', 'evidenced', 'Ambassador', 'employees', 'patrons', 'showcased', 'feelings', 'belief', 'election', 'President', 'will', 'energize', 'America', 'positively.The', 'film', 'also', 'important', 'event', 'assuming', 'great', 'importance', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'same', 'day', 'Kennedy', 'pitted', 'Senator', 'Eugene', 'McCarthy', 'critically', 'important', 'California', 'Democratic', 'Presidential', 'Primary.Rangy', 'Dodger', 'pitcher', 'Don', 'Drysdale', 'final', 'full', 'season', 'same', 'June', '5', 'evening', 'sets', 'major', 'league', 'record', 'scoreless', 'consecutive', 'innings', 'pitched', 'achievement', 'mentioned', 'Kennedy', 'victory', 'speech', 'Drysdale', 'supporter', 'Kennedy', 'impressive', 'feat.Kennedy', 'would', 'enter', 'history', 'books', 'be', 'remembered', 'idealist', 'role', 'model', 'progressives', 'four', 'decades', 'death', 'Drysdale', 'would', 'ultimately', 'be', 'voted', 'Baseball', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'continue', 'please', 'fans', 'death', 'was', 'still', 'Dodger', 'serving', 'broadcast', 'booth']",N/A
1045297,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B000MEYJHY,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","I was 14 in the summer of 1968 -- just old enough to begin understanding the complexity of the world as it was then, even though that understanding was of course callow & still largely untouched by actual life experience. But I could feel the draft age of 18 approaching rapidly, I had seen riots & assassinations & the Vietnam War in the news, and I was scared about the immediate future, especially my own. The presidential campaign of Bobby Kennedy offered me a lot of hope, as it did for so many -- and his murder changed things irreparably for us.That's what this fine film captures beautifully. As previous reviewers have noted, it's NOT a biopic, and it's all the better for that. Instead, it's the last page in a biography of a dream, some of it rooted in reality, some of it rooted in the hopes & fears of those who embraced it. Writer-director Emilio Estevez has magically recreated the urgency, the wonder, the uncertainty and the desperate hunger for peace & social transformation that we felt at that time, when it seemed the world could truly be remade for the better.That wasn't to be, as we all know. And now that I'm decades older, I've learned much more about what was really going on then, and how the man & the public image weren't entirely identical, although there was plenty of overlap. But as I said, this isn't a biopic, neither a bland hagiograpy or a scathing expose of a human being. It's the story of what that man embodied, the hopes he carried, and how utterly shattering it was to lose it all in a brief moment of bloody violence.Estevez has wisely told that story with an Altmanesque ensemble cast of characters, all of whom represent some facet of society in 1968. Some have found those lives ordinary & even boring; but for me, that ordinary quality is what makes them truly meaningful. Yes, this sort of 1960s mosaic has been done many times before ... but Estevez manages to make it fresh & new. In this he's aided by his remarkable cast, all of whom clearly took on this project as a labor of love. It shows, because they all shine in their roles.If you want to know the historical facts & study detailed cultural critiques of that day & time, look elsewhere. This film is about how it FELT, right on the pulse of the moment, not at a distance of decades tinged with cynicism. In fact, it succeeds where so many films about the 1960s fail -- they get the outer details right, but seldom the inner spirit, resulting in a modern cast playing dress-up in period costumes. Not here! Estevez puts us on the ground right beside his characters, so that we're living the moment with them.
