The characterizations were really, really well done--both by the writers and by the actors. Each one was multi-dimensional...multi-faceted--no cardboard cutout characters here. A few of the episodes were slightly corny (the cross-country trek from Atlanta to LA in a motor-home is one example), but even the corny ones were worth watching. When I finished the entire series, from season 1 to season 7, I started all over again. It is really a show worth watching...and watching more than once.

Last year I only watched the show once (+) on my DVR and then deleted it.  Geeesh ! ! ! If I had to hear about the Shooten' Newton Murders AGAIN I thought I was going to scream.  However, this time on Prime with no commercials :) I seemed to tolerate the Shooten' Newton phrase over and over again, better.  I really ENJOYED Brenda's lawyer Gavin Baker (Mark Pellegrino) ! ! !  He was funny and very entertaining.  I really felt that The Closer had lost its humor as the show moved into its 5th-6th Season.  It was great having the eccentric, very-expensive lawyer around to FUN things up.  The arguments between Brenda and Will Pope (J. K. Simmons) got tiresome.  Initially, I had to bite through Captain Sharon Raydor (Mary McDonnell) in seasons 5 &  6 but I must say re-watching Season 7 was my breakthrough to really enjoy her role.  It took me a while to warm up to her but what can I say, I would not let anything interfere with watching Brenda and the Gang.  Finally, we got the Shooten Newton legal crap done with and low-and-behold we have yet another legal mess.  Regardless, I made it through the 7th season and enjoyed it tremendously.  Then I had to come to terms with ""Major Crimes"" - The writers did a masterful piece of work weaving Rusty Beck (Graham Patrick Martin) into the Sharon Rader character.  I have always loved Lieutenant Provenza, I believe his character sealed the bond between ""The Closer"" and ""Major Crimes.""

Expectations & guesses are going wild, trying to figure out how the plots will play out for the last season. Will Provenza find love at last, or will it come out that he & Flynn are gay & walk of into the sunset? Will Brenda get pregnant, as happens more times that you think during menopause? Will Tao be assassinated by an unhappy convict who was convicted because of Tao's amazing work on every case? Will Sanchez find love, a love that is worthy of the memory of his dead wife?Will Gabriel be hand-picked to work with the Mayor's security detail, or groomed for upper management by Chief Pope? Will Pope, who's put on too much weight, have a massive heart attack, moving Brenda into his slot temporarily & perhaps permanently? Will Captain Raydor marry Commander Taylor?Will cast members be killed off, one by one, or will there be some kind of ""going-away"" party as the squad deteriorates for some reason & these six police officers & Buzz find jobs elsewhere? Will they say goodbye with that famous group hug, like the one on the last show of Mary Tyler Moore?Will we see the return of those horrible Dutton children one last time, or Bill Groelick hiding in the shadows for Brenda to come by? Will Charlie come to visit, in college at UCLA, an honor student?Will the writers rise to the challenge & make the most amazing  transition from the reality of this show into the reality of unemployment? The writers & directors have been the worst thing about this season. That & their endless, stupid product placements & close-ups of Brenda's shoes. Maybe Jimmy Choo is getting a cut of the action.For my money, this season is pretty much a 50/50 disappointment. Having Brenda chase after a murder suspect like a helpless little girl, Sir, slow down, please, please! Grrr---rrrr! Oh &lt;weepy face> Sir, please, wait, please!That's not how Brenda rolls.

She remembers everything about handling a case, while others are saying, ""Chief, whatcha wanna do?""Don't get me wrong. I love to see her cry, too. But she doesn' just cry over anything. When she cries, it's because of something that makes us cry, also.I have never seen a female character so well developed & worthy of everyone's respect.

I assumed it was just another procedural police drama, and I couldn't have been more wrong.  As it happened, the very first episode I watched was ""To Serve With Love,"" which has to be one of the funniest and smartest episodes to come down the pike.  G.W. Bailey (Provenza) and his partner in moonlighting, Anthony John Denison (Flynn) are hilarious, as is nearly everyone else in the cast. Not knowing the back story of the series led to some head-scratching moments while trying to figure out the rather convoluted relationships in the show, but it was no bar to enjoying all 42 minutes of this classic episode.  The writing is brilliant.  There are a lot of familiar faces as well: Kyra Sedgwick (Dep. Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson), of course, who plays the lead and is irritating and yet at the same time charming in her single-minded pursuit of justice, Southern-style; J.K. Simmons (Asst. Chief Will Pope), who I immediately recognized as the Farmer's Insurance guy and one of the folks fired by George Clooney in ""Up in the Air,"" among other things; Raymond Cruz (Det. Julio Sanchez) who I thought I only knew as the psycho druglord in ""Breaking Bad,"" but later realized had appeared in many other great roles down through the years; and a large number of other supporting cast members who play their parts to perfection.  I rarely buy single episodes, but this one was a must.  Now that I have seen a few reruns of ""The Closer"" on TNT, I can appreciate all the byplay even more.

I have waited for each new season and watched each episode avidly.  Kyra Sedgewick is amazing - alternately sweet and savage and always, always, always driven by a purpose - get a confession.  She is sensational in this role but she does not stand alone.  Each of the cast members has grown and changed over the last 7 years, each contributes to the overall show.And while praising the series, you cannot forget the writers who have had a wonderful run with The Closer.The two part episode where Brenda, Fritz, Flynn and Provenza travel from Atlanta to LA in her parents RV with an armed robber in custody is funny, poignant and finally forces Brenda to tell her Mom what she really does day in and day out as the Deputy Chief of one of the largest police forces in the country.  Well-written and superbly acted, the closing minutes of this episode bring tears to the eyes of all but the most jaded.And these writers don't just do drama.  Who else could have come up with an episode where Pope, Flynn and Provenza hand over all the evidence at a shooting to a Detective named...Dick Tracy?  What about ""Junk In The Trunk?""  In this episode, Flynn is on the phone with Brenda when the car with the body in the trunk slips off the tow truck, flies down the hill behind him, hits a telephone pole and has a live electrical wire drop on it.

The Seventh Season had a lot of loose ends to tie up, some of which were well tied and some of which were not, and there was an abundance of program cliches brought in to stretch the emotional level out until the very end.  It's nuts that the series has Brenda saying &#34;looks like love&#34; as her last line in the series when those were her opening lines in Episode 1, Season 1.  The lines didn't work in 1/1 and they do not work in 7/21.  It's nuts that Sgt. Gabriel's girlfriend is the leak (I so wanted it to be Cmdr Taylor, but I guess he had a contract for Major Crimes and they had to find somebody else to hang it on)  But we ride our favorites until the end, and this series is no exception.  Watch it, enjoy it, say goodbye to it, watch Captain Raydor take over an energized Major Crimes unit, watch Fritz go off to his own disappointing afterlife,  watch Brenda try to fake an orgasmic appreciation of another foil-wrapped chocolate cake -- it's sad.
