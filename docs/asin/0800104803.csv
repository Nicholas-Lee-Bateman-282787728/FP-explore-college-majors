160773,A103KNDW8GN92L,0800104803,David Hugaert,"[5, 5]","&quot;To Sir With Love&quot; is one of three Sidney Poitier cinematic masterpieces to grace the silver screen in 1967 (the other two being &quot;In The Heat Of The Night&quot; and &quot;Guess Who's Coming To Dinner&quot;). In &quot;TS,WL&quot;, Poitier plays his part well as a nice, warmhearted schoolteacher. When unable to secure a job as a civil engineer, Mark Thackeray (Poitier) agrees to accept a position at North Quay (pronounced like &quot;key&quot;) Secondary School in London's tough East End. Mr. Thackeray quickly finds out he has his hands full with a bunch of hard to discipline teenagers at the outset. When he is unable to reach his students through conventional means of instruction with textbooks, Thackeray is forced to rely on utilizing a more simplified teaching strategy. He accomplishes this by arranging an outing to a local museum of classical art, and also by instructing his pupils in the basic culinary art of Home Economics. Thackeray's newly found confidence is somewhat shaken amongst his students after an incident in the school gymnasium involving one of his pupils, and it is at this point where many of Thackeray's students give him the cold shoulder treatment, with the exception of one Pamela Dare (played nicely by Judy Geeson), who seems to take to Thackeray like a fish to water. In the meantime, Mr. Thackeray applies for many civil engineering jobs via the mail with little success. Later on, when the students' teacher is greeted with a warm reception at the final school dance, it begs the question: should Thackeray stay or go, but not before receiving confirmation (also via the mail) that he's been offered a position with a top engineering firm. For the answer to this burning question, you'll just have to watch this dramatic display of fine acting to find out. Oh, and this film also features the fine vocal talents of Lulu, who is featured as one of Mr. Thackeray's students, as well as sings the movie's title song. The band who performs at the school dance is none other than &quot;The Mindbenders&quot;, who were led by Wayne Fontana, and had a major hit with the song &quot;The Game Of Love&quot; before &quot;TS,WL&quot; was released.

Poitier has such charm and charisma that you will really enjoy and believe every minute. He brings warmth, honesty, and dignity to the role.

Museums, classroom participation so they'd feel like they were contributing something. Calling them by Mr. and Miss to show respect. The teaching that respect is gotten when given. He taught them the valuable lesson that  whatever their background problems were, it was no excuse to be less than what they could be. In the end, the students taught Mr. Poitier more than he ever dreamed when in the last scene he receives his acceptance to a engineering firm.

He is given a class of students who, with maybe one or two exceptions, have reached the end of the academic road and will be leaving school at the end of term.  They have no academic future and their future outside of school is not to promising.  Bike messengers and shop assistants if they're lucky is what awaits these 15 year olds.  (Leaving age in the mid-60s was 15.)  The kids can care less about school and are just watching the days roll down until they don't have to attend anymore.Poitier's charecter quickly realizes that the best thing he can do is get these kids ready for the real world.  He junks the syllabus and creates his own plan for these people to meet life with something like survival skills.  Instead of maths, science and english, he teaches the world of cooking, politeness and proper grooming. These latter skills will help these kids far more than being able to diagram a sentence.I first saw this film when it first came out.  I think I had a better appreication of it, as an American, becuase I had jsut returned from living in the UK and attending a secondary school, which while not like North Quay, did introduce me to some of the characters portrayed.  Guys I knew were facing school leaving with prospects of working as a green grocer's assistant or a boy soldier or seaman in the Forces.  So on an intellectual level, I certainly understood what Poitier's character faced.  These weren't juvenile delinquents but a real segment of British society that probably still exists today.This film has just as much validity today as it did when it was first released.  The cast is excellent from Poitier down to the kid with no lines but filling a desk.

On the day I showed it, the kids came in ignoring me, cursing, all attitude--their usual postures.  I told them we needed a break, and that they'd be watching a video.  They cheered.  The movie began and they booed--everything: the soundtrack, the fashions, the teacher (especially).  But... then they began to watch the story unfold (I think at the point where Thackery goes on his first tirade).  Soon they were pointing out how similar they were to the kids in the class, assigning characters to specific students in my class.  (""That girl is YOU, Denise, all the way!"")  It changed them.  I'm not kidding.  They saw themselves, and what they saw wasn't pretty.  Girls were crying by the end of the film (which took two class periods to show, so for two days I didn't have to fight them to get them to work).

160786,A3RTKL9KB8KLID,0800104803,Stan Vernooy,"[65, 68]","This is my all-time favorite movie.  The story is of a Black engineer, born in British Guyana and educated in California, who takes a job teaching at a high school in a depressed area of London.  He has no teaching  experience, and so develops his teaching style from his own experience.  Gradually the relationship between the teacher (Poitier) and his students  evolves from suspicion, to respect, to love.  There is the obligatory  romantic attraction between Poitier and one of his students, Judy Geeson.  (Geeson, who plays this part with endearing and convincing sweetness, grew  up to become the supercilious and insufferable across-the-hall neighbor  from Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt in the TV sitcom &quot;Mad About  You&quot;).Everything is perfect in this movie.  If you can watch the  very last scene without tears, then you are stronger than I.  In  retrospect, I think this movie was one of the influences which caused me to  become a teacher, 17 years after I first saw it.  I hope it has done the  same for some others, and that it will continue to do so in the future.

160787,A3HAIQAPJCTOSH,0800104803,Steve R.,"[5, 5]","&quot;To Sir With Love&quot; is a powerful and deeply affecting film. The story involves a young black professional (Sidney Poitier) who seeks work as a teacher in a low-income urban school in London in the `60's.  He is at  once conflicted with his personal desire for a more financially rewarding  position in the professions and his frustration with his inability to  &quot;reach&quot; his undisciplined and unmotivated students. He loses his  temper one day as the result of a particularly disreputable act and  challenges each student to respect themselves if they are ever to seek the  respect of others. The understanding and chemistry that subsequently  evolves between teacher and student is both poignant and unforgettable. The  music, featuring the title song by Lulu, eloquently captures the tone and  tenor of the story.The message in this film resonates today with the  disrespect, dysfunction, and violence in many of our public schools.  There  is a timeless quality in the commanding but subtle plea for tolerance,  respect, and personal accountability. The emotions and images the film  evokes provide a rare but treasured moment of humanitarian artistry.",5,A Timeless Classic,952041600,"03 3, 2000",2000,1173,"['quot', 'Sir', 'Love', 'quot', 'powerful', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'black', 'professional', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'who', 'work', 'teacher', 'low-income', 'urban', 'school', 'London', '60', 'once', 'conflicted', 'personal', 'desire', 'more', 'financially', 'rewarding', 'position', 'professions', 'frustration', 'inability', 'quot', 'reach', 'quot', 'undisciplined', 'unmotivated', 'students', 'temper', 'one', 'day', 'result', 'particularly', 'disreputable', 'act', 'student', 'respect', 'are', 'ever', 'seek', 'respect', 'others', 'understanding', 'chemistry', 'subsequently', 'teacher', 'student', 'poignant', 'unforgettable', 'music', 'featuring', 'title', 'song', 'Lulu', 'eloquently', 'tone', 'tenor', 'story.The', 'message', 'film', 'today', 'disrespect', 'dysfunction', 'violence', 'many', 'public', 'schools', 'timeless', 'quality', 'commanding', 'subtle', 'plea', 'tolerance', 'respect', 'personal', 'accountability', 'emotions', 'film', 'evokes', 'provide', 'rare', 'treasured', 'moment', 'humanitarian', 'artistry']",N/A
