306263,AZSN1TO0JI87B,630229648X,A. Estes,"[1, 2]","No, &quot;Child's Play 3&quot; isn't a magnificent film by any stretch of the imagination. So why do I think it is worth watching? It is purely entertaining. It has plenty of gore and plenty of those classic Chucky one-liners. The military setting also benefited the movie, giving it a different feel than the others and making it all much more fresh (I especially appreciated the paintball gag). I have been wanting this movie to be released on DVD for the longest time, and finally, Universal has answered my wishes -- that's the only logical explanation I can come up with, because I know there wasn't a swarm of fans lobbying for this release -- it's the most hated in the series! But I love it. If I felt guilty about loving it, then I guess I would call it a guilty pleasure. But I digress. &quot;Child's Play 3&quot; finds our poor, tortured little Andy growing up. He's stopped playing with dolls, but at age 16, he seems to have caused enough trouble to land him in military school (can't see what he did wrong -- although judging by Justin Whalin's performance, all those foster homes didn't appreciate the whining or the moping). However, Chucky has been absurdly resurrected and follows Andy, only to realize that there is new blood to be spilled. Overall, I don't see anything bad about this movie. It's the third in a horror franchise that was low-budget to begin with. The Chucky doll looks better and moves much more fluidly than in the first two. The peripheral characters may be insignificant, but are colorful and either easy to love or easy to hate (always a good asset for a horror movie.). Fans of Chucky &amp; this series will surely find something they like in this, all others are advised to just stay away. The DVD is somewhat disappointing, saved by the novelty of the movie being available on DVD for the the first time. All we are treated to is a theatrical trailer. However, if you are a fan of the movie, it is worth buying the DVD because is isn't very expensive in the first place and the picture &amp; sound quality makes the purchase worth it.",4,Chucky makes his way to boot camp...and DVD!,1066003200,"10 13, 2003",2003,2078,"['quot', 'Child', 'Play', '3', 'quot', ""n't"", 'magnificent', 'film', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'think', 'worth', 'watching', 'purely', 'entertaining', 'plenty', 'gore', 'plenty', 'classic', 'Chucky', 'one-liners', 'military', 'setting', 'also', 'benefited', 'movie', 'giving', 'different', 'feel', 'others', 'making', 'all', 'much', 'more', 'fresh', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'paintball', 'gag', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'movie', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'longest', 'time', 'finally', 'Universal', 'answered', 'wishes', 'only', 'logical', 'explanation', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'swarm', 'fans', 'lobbying', 'release', 'most', 'hated', 'series', 'love', 'felt', 'guilty', 'loving', 'then', 'guess', 'would', 'call', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'digress', 'quot', 'Child', 'Play', '3', 'quot', 'poor', 'tortured', 'little', 'Andy', 'growing', 'up', 'stopped', 'playing', 'dolls', 'age', '16', 'have', 'caused', 'enough', 'trouble', 'land', 'military', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'did', 'wrong', 'judging', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'performance', 'foster', 'homes', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'whining', 'moping', 'However', 'Chucky', 'been', 'absurdly', 'resurrected', 'Andy', 'only', 'realize', 'new', 'blood', 'be', 'spilled', 'Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'bad', 'movie', 'third', 'horror', 'franchise', 'was', 'low-budget', 'begin', 'Chucky', 'doll', 'better', 'much', 'more', 'fluidly', 'first', 'two', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'insignificant', 'are', 'colorful', 'easy', 'love', 'easy', 'hate', 'always', 'good', 'asset', 'horror', 'movie.', 'Fans', 'Chucky', 'amp', 'series', 'will', 'surely', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'others', 'are', 'advised', 'just', 'stay', 'away', 'DVD', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'saved', 'novelty', 'movie', 'being', 'available', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'treated', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'However', 'are', 'fan', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD', 'because', ""n't"", 'very', 'expensive', 'first', 'place', 'picture', 'amp', 'sound', 'quality', 'purchase', 'worth']",N/A

306268,A19ZN6802UJZJZ,630229648X,Bailey,"[0, 0]","Unless you're into military and stuff like that, I find this film really disappoints. There are a few aspects of the series that are good, which I will explain later. First, let me say that Andy Barclay is not a child in this movie. Rather, he is 16, and not played by the same actor that portrayed him in Child's Play and Child's Play 2. Child's Play 2 is the last movie in the series in which Chucky was after a ""kid"", and this is the last movie he's after anybody in particular. In the next two films in the series, Chucky and his bride kill people for the pleasure, and not for any particular reason at all.That all being said, Child's Play 3 is still an all right movie. There is more comedy in this movie than there was in the previous two films, but this film is still all right. I was able to sit through this one from start to finish in one sitting.I can really sense greed as a main topic in this movie. It's because the creator of the ""Good Guys"" dolls believes the bad hype died down, because it's been 10 years since the Good Guy doll terrorized Andy, and he decides to re-release the Good Guys dolls to make more money. I sense that he is really money greedy, and from his greed, his decision actually puts Andy and his friends at the army camp in danger.It's the last Chucky movie that had humor in it without going overboard. For example, Chucky finds a box of Playboy magazines underneath Andy's bed and turns to him and says ""Andy, how you've grown!""Chucky's back for a third round of blood, one that may disappoint some Child's Play fans that are expecting to see a movie where Andy is just a little bit older (like a month or so older) and once again have the poor child terrorized by the evil Chucky doll, so in that way it may disappoint. But, they still kept the Andy Barclay character (for one more movie, anyway...) and they resurrected Chucky (which, it never made sense to me why they can resurrect them so many times, but if a dog dies, like in Marley and Me, they can't resurrect them in the sequel. Or perhaps Titanic, that they couldn't make a sequel and resurrect Jack, even if he became a Dream Demon, like Freddy Krueger).If you read this review, thanks for reading my rambling on and on about the movie. I hope my review can help you make an informed decision to purchase this movie.",3,"Might Disappoint ""Child's Play"" Fans",1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,2318,"[""'re"", 'military', 'stuff', 'find', 'film', 'really', 'disappoints', 'are', 'few', 'aspects', 'series', 'are', 'good', 'will', 'explain', 'later', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'Andy', 'Barclay', 'not', 'child', 'movie', 'Rather', '16', 'not', 'played', 'same', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'Child', 'Play', 'Child', 'Play', '2', 'Child', 'Play', '2', 'last', 'movie', 'series', 'Chucky', 'was', 'kid', 'last', 'movie', 'anybody', 'particular', 'next', 'two', 'films', 'series', 'Chucky', 'bride', 'kill', 'people', 'pleasure', 'not', 'particular', 'reason', 'all.That', 'being', 'said', 'Child', 'Play', '3', 'still', 'right', 'movie', 'more', 'comedy', 'movie', 'was', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'film', 'still', 'right', 'was', 'able', 'sit', 'one', 'start', 'finish', 'one', 'sitting.I', 'can', 'really', 'sense', 'greed', 'main', 'topic', 'movie', 'creator', 'Good', 'Guys', 'bad', 'hype', 'died', 'down', 'been', '10', 'years', 'Good', 'Guy', 'doll', 'terrorized', 'Andy', 're-release', 'Good', 'Guys', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'sense', 'really', 'money', 'greedy', 'greed', 'decision', 'actually', 'Andy', 'friends', 'army', 'camp', 'danger.It', 'last', 'Chucky', 'movie', 'had', 'humor', 'going', 'overboard', 'example', 'Chucky', 'box', 'Playboy', 'magazines', 'Andy', 'bed', 'Andy', 'how', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'Chucky', 'back', 'third', 'round', 'blood', 'one', 'may', 'disappoint', 'Child', 'Play', 'fans', 'are', 'expecting', 'see', 'movie', 'where', 'Andy', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'older', 'month', 'so', 'older', 'once', 'again', 'have', 'poor', 'child', 'terrorized', 'evil', 'Chucky', 'doll', 'so', 'way', 'may', 'disappoint', 'still', 'kept', 'Andy', 'Barclay', 'character', 'one', 'more', 'movie', 'anyway', 'resurrected', 'Chucky', 'never', 'made', 'sense', 'why', 'can', 'resurrect', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'dog', 'Marley', 'Me', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resurrect', 'sequel', 'perhaps', 'Titanic', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'sequel', 'resurrect', 'Jack', 'even', 'became', 'Dream', 'Demon', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', '.If', 'read', 'review', 'thanks', 'reading', 'rambling', 'movie', 'hope', 'review', 'can', 'help', 'make', 'informed', 'decision', 'purchase', 'movie']",N/A

After locating Andy Barclay's whereabouts (haven't i said this already?) Chucky finds him grown up and in Military School. When Chucky realizes new plastic body means new human body (huh?), he sets his sights on young impressionable kid Tyler, now Andy must save himself and Tyler's soul.Is it any good?Writer Don Mancini gives us plenty of Chucky one-liners, more violence and comedy but absolutely zero horror, Child's Play 3 is about as scary as a quadriplegic assassin. The Military School location gives off a different feeling than the previous two but the plot just feels rushed and pointless. Whalin and Reeves give pretty good performances bouncing off each other well, as for the Tyler character; i kind of wanted him to die, sounds bad i know but he's just so irritating. Anyway Child's Play 3 will still appeal to Chucky fans, he is more ruthless than ever, so if you just wan't to watch creative gore-fest kills and clever puppetry then this movie is for you.Best bit?""That haircut ain't regulation soldier"".

Meanwhile, the Play Pals company has reopened the Good Guy factory and is starting production of the doll once more. But when clearing away Chucky's grisly remains, some of his blood spills into a vat of molten plastic and he is born once more in a new body.After a good old strangulation to get the circulation going he locates Andy at his military school and somehow figures out a way to mail himself there. However, once the package gets there it is promptly snatched by a very annoying, extremely gay and highly wimpy little kid called Tyler. Since he has a new body Chucky reveals his birth name once more, hoping to get a fast and easy ticket out of his plastic shell. As before there are too many distractions.And as before the film spends way too much time with boring humans who spend too much time lurking in the dark wondering why a doll seems to appear and reappear and not enough time with Chucky. He IS the star of the show and he should OWN this movie. The director never really gives him the chance. Which is a shame since the animatronics had improved over Child's Play 2 and Chucky is beginning to look nastily cute. And more and more like Brad Dourif if you look hard enough.The score is a major downer though. Greame Revell's wonderful orchestral adventure of Child's Play 2 has been replaced with a horrid synthesized, death-metal score filled with tacky and unimaginative stingers. Revell, fortunately, returned for Bride of Chucky.Jack Bender's direction (he's done episodes of Lost, Alias and The Sopranos) is slick but lacks edge, invention or humor. He seems to be ignorant of the potential Chucky has and treats the film like another mechanical TV series with no spark or signature.Child's Play 3 is no more than a competent sequel. Writer Don Mancini said he wasn't even ready to do a 3rd movie but Universal forced him to before the second was even released. As he was out of ideas he claims this film to be his least favorite of them all.

306287,A17E28QEX42YU0,630229648X,"Jason ""Hastaj00""","[2, 3]","Apparently, the writer of the three original Chucky films, Don Mancini, said somewhere that this one was his least favorite. The reasoning, or so it was stated -- Mancini was asked to begin writing a script for '3' before '2' was even finished filming. Therefore, Mancini was a bit milked already from exhausting what novel ideas he had for the first sequel, and they pretty much squeezed him dry for this installment.But, 'Child's Play 3' doesn't earn points for creativity... I mean, almost never. And, yes, it may be the weakest link in the original trilogy. That being said, these 'negatives' never stand out when I rewatch this film. No sir. What stands out in my mind whenever I happen to catch Chucky 3 is how much better it is than a fan of the series could have ever expected. In that, though this isn't some sort of legendary horror film, it is one that comes to the table with a sense of seriousness and intent by all the crew working behind it, and the result is something that, at least to me, is probably better than 95% of #3's in any particular series -- and if secluded merely to the horror genre, that number must jump up even more.Anyway, this is just surprisingly well done. The directing is commendable, and looking at the catalogue of Chucky 3's director now fifteen years later, it's interesting to see this one's gone on to make a few of the episodes for ABC's new hit series 'Lost'. Especially within the first half of the film, there are really a lot of spectacular scenes. The one that stood out most for me was when Andy first spots Chucky while doing drills on the field. Filmed almost entirely in slow-mo, we get to see Andy's first realization that Chucky is in fact back in his life... cut to doll being carried around with dead smile... cut to Andy losing his composure, baffling his gun amidst a trembling facial expression. OK fine -- it's not The Godfather -- but the point is I really believe these guys had done some studying, and were not just lazy film-school amateur's with a bucket of cash to pump out a sequel (which, given this one was created within such a short timespan of '2', would have seemed even more likey).I won't zoom closer on any of the other formidable filmmaking elements in Chucky 3, except for the thing that, for my money, holds the film together despite other fine efforts. Like the kid who played Andy Barclay in the first two films, Justin Whalin (who plays a teenage Andy) is adept and believable -- again -- 'especially' given his age and the fact that this is a sequel to a horror film with a director who probably didn't have a lot of actor-influence. I'm now far beyond the reaching age of the film's intended audience (I.E. the bright children of Earth who:  1. Haven't learnt to dissociate themselves -- yet -- from their scariest imaginations and 2. Through whatever means have viewing  access to a rated R psychotic doll movie). Point is this -- I saw  all three of the Child's Play films when I was around 10, and each subsequent one (though out of order) seemed to throw more emotional trauma on top of the last. Sure, it was painful at the time, but had any of the three opted for a less than largely credible actor at the forefront, I don't think the overall impact would have been nearly the same.OK so we get a lot of blood yet again, though truth be told the deaths aren't quite as memorable or clever as we've seen before. One in particular, involving a dump truck, is just downright sadistic (though it is Chucky, I regress....). An interesting element of comparison is also Chucky himself and how he looks and acts. For whatever reason, it has changed a little bit. Overall Chucky's face feels wider, more polished, and by the end of the film, wider and polished with big freaking Bugs Bunny teeth sticking out of his gawking mouth. It's a different look that is at times subtle and at times not, but it's been too long since I've seen the prior two films to really compare. Must say though there were definitely moments where I caught myself thinking ""that don't look right."" Narrative wise the story doesn't offer anything much (and the last fifteen minutes is pretty idiotic actually), but I did like the military school setting. If nothing else, it's a relatively distinct environment for a bunch of young kids and I am not terribly knowledgable on the subject, so by default I was interested in the location of the film. Naturally, I think it was also a good choice because it evaded the tendency for Chucky to go wild again amongst the (sub)urban areas.Bottom line is that like many others I do tend to place this one at the bottom of the list within the trilogy, but for what it's worth I don't think any of them are head and shoulders above each other. They've all got their distinct style and tone and in my opinion we were lucky to have two sequels that showed passion and integrity on the filmmakers part's. Generally I think of myself as a fan of good film, and I don't doubt that most people would laugh at calling these films respectable or even impassioned. But  personally, I just feel that way -- the people making these few little absurdist horror flicks really might have had some sort of collective, motivating energy from the projects and exerted that much more into them because of it. I mean hell, how else could this little trilogy here garnish such a cult following? I mean, you mention Chucky to most any American over 12 years old, and a killer doll pops immediately into mind.

306288,A3RSB9GI36XA55,630229648X,Jayson Orelans,"[3, 7]","Nor is it scary. It takes a really horrible director and writer to destroy a blockbuster box office smash series. The second sequels are always the victims to crazy script writers and directors. (Example: Child's Play 3, Alien 3, Omen III: The Final Conflict.)In this wanna-be re-hash of the original, we expected, as much hype as it got, a non-stop, tongue in cheek, roller coaster ride. In whole, it [was bad]. I was 12 when I first saw it and I was so angry, that I (And most of the audience) walked out the theatre demanding refunds. I really don't know what ...Bender was on at the time. And the script must have been written in at least one day, because it came out not even exactly one-year after it's predecessor. There must have been so much ad-libbing it wasn't funny. The first two did very, very well in the box office, this one wasn't even on the top 50. It's a shame to see this one stain the 'Child's Play' family name. And it lacks originaility. Stupid characters, cheesy plot, non-stop laughable death scenes, and dumb acting. The movie starts out with the Play Pals factory being re-opened and a machine digging into Chucky's ribs. It's stupid to see Chucky back, since his death scene was so terrible in the last. So his blood infuses inside a new Good Guy doll (Stupid). He kills the owner of Play Pals. The rest of the movie is corny, you won't believe!16 year old Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin) is being transfered to a military school. It's stupid because it doesn't say why he is going there. The plot holes are so abundant in this film. Chucky also wants to transfer his soul into a new child, which is also dumb. It's up to Andy to save him.First mistake: Making Andy a grown up. It's ridiculous to see Mr. Whalin stumble over one-liners. The writer/director could have given the role to Alex Vincent who did an awesome job playing a traumatized Andy. Second screw up: Making Andy a hero instead of a victim. I always liked the idea of Chucky trying to take over Andy's soul. Whalin makes Andy a wuss, also. Whatever happend to the tough as nails, no nonsense Andy Barclay we've known in the first two?The military settings was also unnecessary. I wish they hired me in charge of the writing/directing. I sure would have had it somewhat like the oringinal with the Chuck still trying to get inside Andy's body. I know it sounds monotonus, but there shouldn't have even been a 'Child's Play 3'. It's not a wonder why we haven't seen these actors and actresses on any other movies besides this garbage. It's fun in own little trashy way.

And to me, it was obvious.The factory where Chucky was created is up and running ten years after the last Andy / Chucky dilemma. The Good Guy dolls are being created again, and during the creation Chucky's blood is luckily still going ten years later and is mixed into the melted plastic used to create the dolls; therefore he is reborn. Proof #153 that this film was rushed: Plot Holes. They don't stop there, but I won't continue going on with them.Casting is another obvious reason. Justin Whalin takes the place of Alex Vincent as Andy. Vincent was stated as not wanting to come back for another film so the writers / producers / whoever decided to go ten years into the future with a 16 year old Andy (just only nine months after the second is released and Andy is six years old, mind you). Aside from a few ""eh"" moments, Justin Whalin is the only one in the cast you remotely care for or want to see.Brad Dourif delivers Chucky's lines with total awareness, and this is where Chucky's one-liners begin to be even better.

Paul ""John doe""","[0, 0]","Now I'm reviewing the underrated Childs Play 3 it's not a sequel that is well liked by fans but honestly I have always thought that this was a good sequel. I like this better than Bride & Seed Of Chucky those movies I'll get into why I don't like part 4 & why I hate part 5. I know fans hate it cause they made Andy older & gave it a Military School setting. Iike The Military School setting & for the time Don Mancini was given he did a very good job. He was under pressure by Universal to write a script for Childs Play 3 & part 2 hadn't even came out yet. Don Mancini says this is his least favorite of the franchise. Yeah Bride & Seed are something to be really proud of. Made for $13 million made $20 million it was the least grossing of the franchise. Directed by Jack Bender he's done a lot of TV work. It stars Brad Dourif doing the voice of Chucky, Justin Whalin as Andy Barclay, Perrey Reeves as Kristen DiSilva, Travis Fine as Cadet Lieutenant Shelton, Dean Jacobson as Harold Whitehurst & Jermey Sylvers as Roland Tyler. The story is The Play Pals Toy Company is going to relaunch The Good Guy Dolls after about 8 years of not making due to bad plublicity. You have these people cleaning out the factory from part 2 & some of the parts of The Chucky Doll go into some hot plastic so the 1st Good Guy Doll off the asmbley line is Chucky. They give it to the owner of the company. That night Chucky strangles tht guy he says just like the good old days. He gets on the computer finds out where Andy is at. You have Andy who is 16 yrs old he's in Military School & this kid named Tyler befriends him. I know in The TV version they introduce him earlier on a bus taking them to the academy. Then he meets a fellow cadet Whitehurst who is bullied by Shelton & his buddies. Outside they are doing some military drills Shelton is yelling at Andy he wants him to call him Lieutenant Colonel Shelton & then say Sir. Then he talks to Whitehurst like he's a pos he thinks that he's a real drill seargent. He's unlikeable but unlikeable for the right reasons. You have the introduction of a likeable character Kristen DiSilva who calls Shelton an a  s  s hole. He makes her do 25 push ups. Andy & DiSilva become fast friends she teaches him how to aim a gun properly. At The PX Tyler finds out that he hasn't got a letter from his Dad who is in The Air Force. He's given a package to give to Andy. He finds out it's a Good Guy Doll. Tyler takes it The Armory where  Chucky pops out he realizes that since he's got a new body he can just tell Tyler who he really is & transfer his soul to him. Chucky says ""Great I'm going to be a bro."" Before he can do that some Supior Officers find them there cause they are going to do War Games. The Colonel takes the doll outside Andy spots it The Colonel throws it in a dumpster. Then you get 1 of my favorite kills in the franchise where Chucky is in the back of this garbage truck he screams for help. The Garbage Man goes in & looks for him. Chucky gets in the truck turns on the compactor even though you don't see much The Garbage Man has kind of brutal death. Later on you have Andy in his room where Chucky attacks him & he tells him that he's going after Tyler. Andy takes a shoe that Whitehurst shined for Shelton. Andy beats the doll with it. Shelton comes in he takes the doll. Andy goes into Shelton's room to get it Chucky runs off. He's mad that the doll is gone so Shelton makes all the cadet's go outside & do exercises to impress his Supior's. Chucky is looking for Tyler you have DiSilva in The Colonel's Office she is looking for a file on Andy. DiSilva & her friend find Tyler in the closet they all hear The Colonel coming to The Office. He comes in takes the doll throws it in the trash. Chucky pops out scares The Colonel & he has a heart attack. Chucky's reaction is pretty funny. He says "" You got to beph  u  c  k  in  g kidding me!  You have this Military Barber who cuts Whitehurst's hair he says presto you're bald. The Barber is played by Andrew Robinson. The Barber finds the dolls & he's going to cut it's hair Chucky takes a razor blade slits The Barber's throat & says ""Presto you're dead."" Chucky replaces the paintball rounds with live rounds in The Red Team's rifles. Andy needs to get to Tyler before Chucky does. DiSilva tells Andy where Shelton keeps the map at cause Tyler is on the red team. Disilva tells Andy her 1st name they kind of start up a realtionship. Shelton heads out cause Andy stole the map. Andy is looking for Tyler he is told by some kids that a man named Charles took him. Tyler runs off when Chucky pulls a knife on him. He meets up with Andy where Shelton says we got a POW he's taking it seriously like it's a real military operation. He radios to DiSivla to return she is attacked by Chucky where he radios to Shelton to bring him the boy. So they go to where Chucky is at Chucky also lured the red team there where they open fire Shelton is shot dead which made me happy. While they are all arguing & 1 of Shelton's buddies iis beating up Andy Chucky throws a grenade Whitehurst covers himself over the grenade to save his fellow cadet's. Tyler runs off where he ends up at a carnival Tyler tries to get help from this cop who happens to have the doll & he's killed. Andy & DiSilva go look for Tyler they find the cop DiSilva takes his gun. You get to the finish in this haunted house ride not as good as the toy factory in part 2 but it is a well done scene. Chucky shoots DiSilva in the leg. There's this reaper thing in the ride that cuts part of Chucky's face off Tyler runs off but he is knocked out by this prop thing. Chucky tries to do the soul transfer thing Andy shoots Chucky's arm off & then shoots him in the chest. Andy checks on Tyler. Chucky jumps on his back tries to choke Andy Tyler gives him a knife he cuts Chucky's hand off he falls into this huge fan silced up. As they take Kristen DiSilva off The Police take Andy in for questioning he tells Kristen that he's been through this before. To me this was the end of The Childs Play series if you don't like Childs Play 3 that's fine don't leave hateful comments if you leave a comment tell me why you don't like it. I liked it cause you still had characters that you cared about they felt like normal people it's straight forward like part 2 was I like The Military School setting. Jack bender did a good job directing. Brad Dourif wasn't as good as he was in 1&2 but still does good voicing Chucky. Justin Whalin not as good as Alex Vincent but does a pretty good job taking over the character. Perrey Reeves was good. They are better characters thaan anybody in 4&5. Travis Fine did well in his role. Dean Jacobson did a good job. Jermey Sylvers is no Alex Vincent but he did fine.

Apart from the fact it has the scariest cover for a Childs Play movie so far. Brrrrrrr. It was slightly slower, and after a fantastic ending of Childs Play 2, it carried on with a fabulous way of bringing Chucky back (his blood gets into the new dolls), but then seemed to get stuck into a rut.There's a hint at romance between the new actor playing Andy, Justin Whalen (anyone else thinks he looks like the guy from Opposite of Sex?) and the tough girl, but it's never really followed through. Chucky manages to attack another kid this time, who's literally so into the dolls, he reminded me of the kid from Bad Santa.Screenwriter Don Mancini was actually pressured into writing the third, before the second was even released, and he says this is his least favourite, as he didn't have much time to get new ideas.Chucky is also less violent and creepy (apart from the cover), and there's no funny moments anymore involving him. There's only a great one-liner, and I'd get blacklisted from Amazon if I repeated it in my review. But you guys who've seen the film will know the one I mean. There is one inventive killing, rather than the standards, which is garotting someone - brought me straight back to my history class at high school, when I actually found out what that was.

Andy is told it's time for forget about dolls and the childish stories of his past, but can he forget for long?  Once again a toy company is determined to put the past behind and bring back the good guy doll.  In the words of Chucky, ""You just can't keep a good guy down""  and hes back to claim a new soul!The Package:  2 StarsI love the cover with the face of Chucky on the front.  Inside though, there is no inlay and only the disc.  The disc pops out of the holder pretty easy and stays in place when put back in which is great.  The film is in widescreen but there is no closed caption on this one.  As far as extras, there is the trailer included which is great, however nothing is included beyond that.Spook Meter:  2 StarsSome light spooks, mixed with tons of great Chucky humor!  Their is not a whole of build up here in this film and Chucky gets on a roll pretty fast.  Not really scary, but some of his one liners are some of the best.Gore/Violence Meter:  2 StarsNot much blood at all, however some of the kills are pretty good. I would say the violence is pretty tame on this one but there are a few graphic scenes.  One scene a guy gets his throat slashed when he tries to give Chucky a haircut that is pretty graphic, other then that, the violence is pretty mild. Hey, you can't blame Chucky, he don't like anyone messing with his hair.Profanity Meter: 4 StrikesThere is a lot of profanity in this film.  Viewers beware!Sexual Meter: 1 StrikeThere are no in bed, make out scenes in this film at all.  No nudity what so ever.  There is only one single mild kissing scene.  Viewers concerned about sexual themes, have nothing to worry about watching this film.Final Thoughts:  Child's Play 3 was really great to watch when it came to Chucky!  He has tons of funny sayings in this film that will make you laugh a lot.  Chucky laughs a lot in this one also which always makes me bust out laughing too, what can I say, I love Chucky!  So why not 5 stars?I really enjoyed Child's Play 3, however Andy Barclay is not played by Alex Vincent in this one.  Since the character of Andy Barclay is in his teens in this film, Alex Vincent was not quite old enough in real life to fit this role.  Andy is now played by Justin Whalin and although he did a good job, I felt that Alex Vincent brought a very special vibe that is missed greatly.  Overall though, I loved Child's Play 3 and although not 5 stars, it still was a lot of fun to watch!Thank you for reading my review!",4,You just can't keep a good guy down!,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,2602,"['Film', 'Name', 'Child', 'Play', '3Year', 'Made', '1991Overview', 'Young', 'Andy', 'Barclay', 'now', 'teenager', 'enrolled', 'military', 'school', 'Andy', 'told', 'time', 'forget', 'dolls', 'childish', 'stories', 'past', 'can', 'forget', 'long', 'Once', 'again', 'toy', 'company', 'determined', 'put', 'past', 'bring', 'back', 'good', 'guy', 'doll', 'words', 'Chucky', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'good', 'guy', 'down', 'back', 'claim', 'new', 'soul', 'Package', '2', 'StarsI', 'love', 'cover', 'face', 'Chucky', 'front', 'inlay', 'only', 'disc', 'disc', 'holder', 'pretty', 'easy', 'stays', 'place', 'when', 'put', 'back', 'great', 'film', 'widescreen', 'closed', 'caption', 'one', 'As', 'far', 'extras', 'trailer', 'included', 'great', 'however', 'nothing', 'included', 'that.Spook', 'Meter', '2', 'StarsSome', 'light', 'spooks', 'mixed', 'tons', 'great', 'Chucky', 'humor', 'not', 'whole', 'build', 'up', 'here', 'film', 'Chucky', 'roll', 'pretty', 'fast', 'Not', 'really', 'scary', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'best.Gore/Violence', 'Meter', '2', 'StarsNot', 'much', 'blood', 'however', 'kills', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'would', 'say', 'violence', 'pretty', 'tame', 'one', 'are', 'few', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'One', 'scene', 'guy', 'throat', 'slashed', 'when', 'give', 'Chucky', 'haircut', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'other', 'then', 'violence', 'pretty', 'mild', 'Hey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Chucky', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'anyone', 'messing', 'hair.Profanity', 'Meter', '4', 'StrikesThere', 'lot', 'profanity', 'film', 'Viewers', 'beware', 'Sexual', 'Meter', '1', 'are', 'bed', 'make', 'out', 'scenes', 'film', 'nudity', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'only', 'one', 'single', 'mild', 'kissing', 'scene', 'Viewers', 'concerned', 'sexual', 'themes', 'have', 'nothing', 'worry', 'watching', 'film.Final', 'Thoughts', 'Child', 'Play', '3', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'watch', 'when', 'came', 'Chucky', 'tons', 'funny', 'sayings', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'lot', 'Chucky', 'lot', 'one', 'also', 'always', 'bust', 'out', 'laughing', 'too', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'Chucky', 'So', 'why', 'not', '5', 'stars', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Child', 'Play', '3', 'however', 'Andy', 'Barclay', 'not', 'played', 'Alex', 'Vincent', 'one', 'character', 'Andy', 'Barclay', 'teens', 'film', 'Alex', 'Vincent', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'old', 'enough', 'real', 'life', 'fit', 'role', 'Andy', 'now', 'played', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'felt', 'Alex', 'Vincent', 'brought', 'very', 'special', 'vibe', 'missed', 'greatly', 'Overall', 'loved', 'Child', 'Play', '3', 'not', '5', 'stars', 'still', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Thank', 'reading', 'review']",N/A

Chucky's been resurrected thanks to some of his blood dripping into thd doll making process, and he's on a killing rage again.  This time, though, he eschews going for a now 16 year old Andy Barclay, opting to try out the new little boy, Tyler, who attends the same military school Andy's been remanded to.  Justin Whalin takes over the role of Andy from young Alex Winter and although he's a capable actor, his character continues to do stupid things; you think he'd learn by now that people are not going to believe him about the killer Chucky doll.  There's not a whole lot of suspense in this one, because since we've already been through two movies with the demon doll, we know where this one's going to end too.

How his soul survived the when the body was destroyed, and then exchanged completely, is a mystery to me but it's what they went with here. Chucked out less than a year from the previous installment, part three is plagued down with a rather poor script, dopey dialogue and weak characters.Chucky, still intent on claiming a human body, ventures out after Andy Barclay (who's files are conveniently in the Good Guy's owners office, where Chucky himself happened to be). Now why would the Good Guy owner order Chucky's body itself rebuilt, and then have it set in his office?? Doesn't make much sense either. But anyway, apparently the ornery old man has been keeping tabs on the Barclay kid whose tale threatened to turn his fortune into a pile of doll dust, and Chucky learns that Andy, now a teenager, has been shipped off to a military academy.Little plastic legs in tow, he somehow makes it over to the camp and sets his sights on the teen. Oh wait, that's right - he MAILS himself! All is going well, sort-of, until he runs into another kid, Tyler, who drops him down a flight of stairs. Realizing that now the rules have changed, he is after the nave African American child to play the old game of ""hide the soul.""Andy, paranoid as ever, suspects and then confirms the ol' Chuckster is back. But of course no one believes him. Chucky can't quite reach Andy to finish his old enemy off, Andy can't dig up adequate proof and has his own little wars going on with some of the other guys, as well as a possible love interest De Silva.Actually from far away it sounds sort of fun. Having Chucky in a military camp is a refreshing change of scenery; the potential for some ultimate massacreing was in the air.In some ways this was taken advantage of, while in other ways they could have done more.Justin Whalin (Andy) does a decent job but the personality is a bit too whiny and wimpy for sympathy. De Silva (played by Perrey Reeves) is a bit too stereotypically ""tough"" to be overly realistic. Chucky's new interest for a soul portal (Jeremy Sylvers) wasn't the best actor, and his scream is undeniably feminine. Travis Fine as Shelton was great though; I enjoyed all the scenes with him.Some of the kills were pretty humorous, the paintball scene winning hands down. Funny. The garbage man's demise disturbed me. Some of the other kills, such as with the barber, were a bit too hokey. But all through it Chucky was as animated as ever. They definitely make this doll look realistic, and his jokes were actually chuckle-inducing. By now he's growing a bit tiresome as the plastic comedian but he's still working. Unfortunitely the movie isn't.There was a bit more blood dabbled on this sequel and that works, and in a way it's darker than the other two. The directing of the film was alright but it didn't contain much style. Jack Bender tried to create some suspense; sometimes it worked and other times it didn't add up to too much.The finale takes place in a carnival placed conveniently near the academy. There are actually some semi-freaky shots going on there and I really got into that sort of setting for these scenes.Overall the plot has enough holes to resemble a crocheted blanket, Chucky is aging fast, none of the characters could be cared about, and nothing exciting really happened.

People say this is the worst of the series, but it's actually the most clever. The one liners from Chucky are priceless, better than the scripted junk he says in Bride and Seed. Plus the climax ending is one of the best I've ever seen. Andy does what he always wanted to do, and that's kill Chucky FOR GOOD with his own bare hands. Speaking of which, I believe Chucky died for good in 3. There was NO way he could of came back, mostly for 3 reasons.1. He was TORN TO SHREADS!!!!! How can he possibly be stitched together after all that. Watch his death in slow motion. His entire head was squashed and cut to itty bitty pieces. Plus he was bleeding like crazy. If his remains from 3 were accurate in Bride, then Tiffany would of tossed him into the garbage after so many failed attempts to revive the little you-know-what. Better get Voodoo for Dummies vol 2.2. I highly DOUBT that the cops would investigate a normal working amusment park fan to look for this ""Chucky"" Andy must be extremely certain that Chucky is dead, so why bother telling the cops it was him who caused the murders? When the amusement park closed, the clean up crew probably found his remaining pieces and tossed him in the trash, bye bye Charles.3. There's no amulet, never been mentioned by Chucky or by John(the black voodoo guy from the first) who TAUGHT Chucky about Damballa in the first place, so obviously Bride was made from stratch.To top it off, Andy defeated his nemesis in a awesome trilogy about a killer doll who WANTS TO TAKE POSSESSION OF A CHILD'S BODY. Not to screw old flames and make gender confused wimps and pshyco frizzy haired daughters. The Child's Play trilogy is best as it is, the rest is ignored.However, I will accept a Chucky v.s. Leprachaun someday, but without Tiffany, Glen, or Glenda's presence.

This comment actually comes from many ardent Chucky fans who look at the film as being the weakest in the franchise. This may be true, but ""Child's Play 3"" is entertaining, horrific, smart, and daring as far as thrillers go. The producers did admit they were running out of ideas by the time the third installment was produced, but in all fairness I like ""Child's Play 3"". In this outing Chucky, again, comes back to life when the company that manufactured the ""Good Guy Dolls"" wants to bring back ""The Chucky Doll"" with hopes that the public has forgotten the terrifying elements associated with the toy. The young boy in the first two films, Andy, is now a teenager in a military school where Chucky tracks him down to invade his soul.Brad Dourif, who voices Chucky, gives another superb performance playing a crazed, psychotic killer. Who can ever forget that voice. Dourif's voice is creepy, horrifying, and unforgettable.Unfortunately, ""Child's Play 3"" only grossed a paltry $20,000,000 at the boxoffice making it the poorest money-making ""Chucky"" film.
