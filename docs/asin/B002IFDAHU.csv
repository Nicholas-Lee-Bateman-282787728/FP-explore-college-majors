1269509,A1248JRIINWRTH,B002IFDAHU,"Angela Wilson ""I love books & DVDs!""","[1, 1]","This lackluster end-of-the-world film won't give you any thrills.Doomsday 2012 is all the rage.As a society, we go from one end-of-the-world scenario to another - and Hollywood happily obliges these fixations with films that attempt to prick  our deepest doomsday fears.2012 Supernova is one of the few that attempts to scare audiences with a fictional account of what could be a real-life scenario on Dec. 21, 2012 - the day the Mayan calendar ends.As far as end-of-the-world films go, 2012 Supernova isn't terrible, but it's not great, either. It focuses on one family only; most films have three or four story lines that gradually merge. Focusing on this family is just too much.Brian Krause plays an astrophysicist who has been tracking a star that has become unstable in another galaxy. The star explodes and sends a pulse across space, destroying everything in its path with some major radiation.While he tries to find a solution with Chinese and Russian scientists, he sends his wife, Laura, (Heather McComb) and daughter to find shelter at a nearby military base. Of course, it isn't that easy. The women have to travel in strange natural disasters caused by the star pulse's ripples.In many scenes the mother and daughter are driving vehicles and trying not to panic. They nearly get caught in a landslide, flattened by rocks, swept up by a Twister-like tornado and get raped by a nasty backwoods guy.Their plight gets old fast - and isn't really all that interesting. It wore on my nerves after a while. However, I really liked McComb's acting.There is someone working against the scientists to make sure the pulse isn't stopped and Earth is destroyed. There are some good red herrings, but I figured out who it was fairly easily based on body language and lines. The astrophysicist goes into space on a death mission to save Earth.2012 Supernova is okay, but not exactly a must-have. There is definite cheese with the lines and the acting, though you can expect that with any doomsday cinema - even the films with top-billed actors.I will say, though, that this film doesn't seem as bad as (I remember) The Day After Tomorrow.The DVD includes a blooper reel and a featurette called ""Making of 2012: Supernova,"" which is interesting.2012 Supernova has potential, but it isn't a must-watch. If you are desperate for a fictional fix of doomsday craziness, it might whet your appetite, but it will still leave you hungry for something more.",1,Doomsday Film Fail,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,2447,"['lackluster', 'end-of-the-world', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'thrills.Doomsday', '2012', 'rage.As', 'society', 'go', 'one', 'end-of-the-world', 'scenario', 'Hollywood', 'happily', 'fixations', 'films', 'attempt', 'prick', 'deepest', 'doomsday', 'fears.2012', 'Supernova', 'one', 'few', 'scare', 'audiences', 'fictional', 'account', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'real-life', 'scenario', 'Dec.', '21', '2012', 'day', 'Mayan', 'calendar', 'ends.As', 'far', 'end-of-the-world', 'films', 'go', '2012', 'Supernova', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'one', 'family', 'only', 'most', 'films', 'have', 'three', 'four', 'story', 'lines', 'gradually', 'merge', 'Focusing', 'family', 'just', 'too', 'much.Brian', 'Krause', 'astrophysicist', 'who', 'been', 'tracking', 'star', 'become', 'unstable', 'galaxy', 'star', 'explodes', 'pulse', 'space', 'destroying', 'everything', 'path', 'major', 'radiation.While', 'find', 'solution', 'Chinese', 'Russian', 'scientists', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Heather', 'McComb', 'daughter', 'find', 'shelter', 'nearby', 'military', 'base', 'course', ""n't"", 'easy', 'women', 'have', 'travel', 'strange', 'natural', 'disasters', 'caused', 'star', 'pulse', 'ripples.In', 'many', 'scenes', 'mother', 'daughter', 'are', 'driving', 'vehicles', 'trying', 'not', 'panic', 'nearly', 'get', 'caught', 'landslide', 'flattened', 'rocks', 'swept', 'up', 'Twister-like', 'tornado', 'get', 'raped', 'nasty', 'backwoods', 'guy.Their', 'plight', 'old', 'fast', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'interesting', 'wore', 'nerves', 'while', 'However', 'really', 'liked', 'McComb', 'acting.There', 'someone', 'working', 'scientists', 'make', 'sure', 'pulse', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'Earth', 'destroyed', 'are', 'good', 'red', 'herrings', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'fairly', 'easily', 'based', 'body', 'language', 'lines', 'astrophysicist', 'space', 'death', 'mission', 'save', 'Earth.2012', 'Supernova', 'okay', 'not', 'exactly', 'must-have', 'definite', 'cheese', 'lines', 'acting', 'can', 'expect', 'doomsday', 'cinema', 'even', 'films', 'top-billed', 'actors.I', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'bad', 'remember', 'Day', 'Tomorrow.The', 'DVD', 'blooper', 'reel', 'featurette', 'called', 'Making', '2012', 'Supernova', 'interesting.2012', 'Supernova', 'potential', ""n't"", 'must-watch', 'are', 'desperate', 'fictional', 'fix', 'doomsday', 'craziness', 'might', 'whet', 'appetite', 'will', 'still', 'leave', 'hungry', 'something', 'more']",N/A

In a nutshell, this is a really bad bad movie, from any angle you look at it.

I really think that despite the low budget, nowadays there is no excuse for making such a lousy movie (and  Moon demonstrates that a good movie does not necessarily requires a fat budget).

I literally could not tell the girlfriend and the daughter apart, from scene to scene; both were slim dark-haired actresses (showing a truly lamentable lack of foresight).  And although they were supposedly unrelated to each other, I suspect (given their abilities) that they WERE related to someone in Casting.Also:  Could every single actor have been DIRECTED to speak in a mumbling monotone? Was NO ONE excited about the evolving disaster? Adrenalin was entirely absent from this story. The characters STROLLED from crisis to crisis.  (And by the way, was there a REASON the two women left their vehicle in the midst of a ferocious lightning-storm? The girl's explanation was mumbled so quickly that I couldn't catch it, despite running the scene over & over. Was it supposed to be believable, to have them running over hill & dale for a mile or more, as lightning struck down all around them? ""Jeez, idiots,"" I thought, ""find a ditch and LIE DOWN."")Real action, and convincing acting, might have saved this film -- even in the absence of believable SPFX.The special effects, for which I buy such movies, were... catastrophic.

1269522,A1I4UOF79V36D4,B002IFDAHU,Steven Rainwater,"[3, 3]","Every once in awhile a movie comes along that's `so bad it's good'. We all know the types of movies I'm talking about. `Plan 9 From Outer Space' was so terrible on every level, and was cheesier than all the cheese in Wisconsin combined, that it was hard *not* to be entertained by it. Same with movies like `Evil Dead', starring Bruce Campbell, a movie that certainly had a low budget, cheesy special effects, but the movie (unlike the sequel, which was more along the lines of a comedy, and a good one at that) had some genuinely creepy moments, such as when the first character (can't remember her name) was possessed. The acting was at least half way believable, and the setting was indeed foreboding and ominous. You walked away from the movie with the feeling that they were at least trying.Then there are the movies like this one, ones that are so bad that they`re...well, bad. As in, terrible acting. As in, deep, yawning chasms in the plot, plot holes big enough for the Milky Way Galaxy to fit through.Before I go any further, I'd like to pontificate for a moment about what makes a good movie a good movie, at least in my opinion. If there are any aspiring movie-makers out there who might be reading this, pull up a chair, get comfortable, and start taking notes. Here are some very basic rules for making an entertaining movie:#1: Big budget films are often overrated, that's a fact. Case-in-point, the movie 2012 starring John Cusack. It had billion-dollar special effects, with a $0.15 script. (I covered that movie in another review) The special effects were awesome, really, but the over-the-top, bullcrap heroics, and the plausibility of a person pulling off such a stunt in real life just killed the movie. KILLED it. Unbelievable heroics should be part and parcel of Kung-Fu movies (brainless popcorn flicks) but not movies about the possible apocalyptic end of the world.Such movies should be thought-provoking. They should have you feeling a growing sense of panic and impending doom, right along with the lead character. Nicholas Cage, in the movie `Knowing', did an outstanding job in that regard. Why? Not only because he's a good actor, but he had a cohesive, well thought-out and well written script to work with, which brings me to my second point:#2: No one is going to crucify you for not having a Star Wars-esque budget to work with. Tiny budget does NOT automatically=bad movie. I've seen some terrific low budget movies that were highly entertaining, like `Ghost Story' for instance. `Frailty' and `The Breakfast Club'  are other movies that immediately spring to mind, movies that, while they may have featured well known actors, were by no stretch of the imagination considered big budget films. They had minimal special effects (The Breakfast Club had NONE) but they were well written and cohesive, and had decent acting.So, if you don't have a big budget to work with, what's the next logical step to take if you want to make not only a successful movie, but a GOOD one? (this SHOULD be the #1 step anyway, ALWAYS) Have some halfway decent acting, and a cohesive, believable, and engaging script/plot. It really is that simple. Are you still taking notes?For those of you who are even considering watching this or buying it, I'll let you in on some of the more shockingly bad...............****************************spoilers ahead*****************************......continuity errors and plot holes. Well, I don't even consider them spoilers, really, come to think of it, I consider it a humanitarian gesture. Humanitarian in the sense that if my review convinces you to not see this film, I've just saved you from irreversible brain damage, and prevented you from wasting 2 hours of your life.I believe another reviewer has already covered this, but just in case you missed it...towards the end of the movie, the main character is `sacrificing himself' to save mankind, and he detonates several nuclear weapons on board, destroying the space station he`s on. Just moments later..are you ready for this...he's shown surprising his wife by stepping through the front door., and they lived happily ever after.Put your coffee cup down and let that sink in for a moment.He detonated SEVERAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS, which destroyed the space station he was on.WTF???? you ask? Indeed, the biggest `WTF' in cinematic history, the biggest `WTF' in this universe or any other, perhaps even transcending alternate dimensions.Here's a rhetorical question for you: How does something like that get past a proofreader, or proofreadERS? No, scratch that, let's NOT make it a rhetorical question, I  really want to know. I have ne...wait a minute..the answer is coming to me...the proofreader was hitting the crack pipe. Hard.That's GOT to be the answer, because barring that, well.. a blind man at midnight wearing Terminator shades could have spotted that from a distance of 500 miles.Forgetting the crack pipe hitting proofreader for a moment, how are people who writes scripts like this even hired in the first place?  This is how I believe it unfolded:Drunk interviewer: *takes a swig of Vodka from flask hidden in desk drawer* ""So..*Hiccup*..did you bring your resume' with you? I seem to have misplaced it..""Stoned interviewee: ""I never mailed it you..""Drunk interviewer: ""Oh, that's probably why I couldn't find it. Did you bring it with you?""Stoned interviewee: ""No, I had to take a huge s**t before I left the house, so I used it as toilet paper.  I was out.""Drunk interviewer: ""Isn't it gonna' be kinda' hard to get a job without it?""Stoned interviewee: ""Nah, I'm like, totally qualified, you've probably seen some of my work. I wrote the script for that movie that came out, you know, the one with the guy in it and everything? Came out last year. It was totally gnarly.""Drunk interviewer: ""Oh, all right *Hiccup* you're hired. Welcome onboard!""And I don't believe I'm exaggerating with that scenario, sadly enough.This review is getting a little longish, so I'll try to wrap it up quickly.  Other things that made me go ""WTF?"":In a lightning storm, the two heroines exit the relative safety of their vehicle, which rests on 4 rubbers tires mind you  (not to mention the interior of the vehicle, which is made up of vinyl, cloth/and or leather, plus rubber...) and makes a run for it on foot.An earthquake hits, gaping fissures suddenly appear in the highway, and, just moments later (while still in their SUV) a `Road Closed' sign magically appears in front of one of the fissures. In the middle of the dessert. Fastest road crew in the world, I tells ya'....Early on in the movie, a couple of terrorists pull right up beside the hero and his family on the highway, fire fully automatic weapons at them at POINT-BLANK range,  and seconds later, you get a good shot of the side of their vehicle. Should be riddled with bullet holes, right? WRONG. The freakin' WINDOW isn't even busted!In this movie, apparently the fate of the entire planet rests on the shoulders of our hero, as he never once consults..I don't know..THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES about his decisions! Not even a General!And I while I don't work for NASA or anything, something tells me that it takes more than 3 or 4 people to launch a Space Shuttle...And all of the minority stereotypes are represented, right down to the stereotypical Vodka swilling Russian with the comical over-the-top accent, complete with frazzled hair, rumpled, unkempt clothing, a smoker, and wearing nerd glasses.

1269524,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B002IFDAHU,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[3, 3]","The box claims this event is caused by a star in a ""nearby galaxy"" going supernova when the movie claims it was from the constellation Lyra. Stars go supernova all the time. All they do is light up the sky for a while due to light passing through gasses near said star. However in this scenario of really bad science, the radiation comes to us in waves, ignoring dissipation through the inverse square law. Even if it did get here, it would could not cause earthquakes, or lightning, or tornadoes, at least without being powerful enough to destroy all life first. I am also confused by the idea that exploding atomic weapons by the magnetosphere would somehow enhance it. Perhaps this is some left over bad science from the movie ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea."" Curse you Michael Ansara! While driving his family to the base in a black GMC SUV, the Bruce Krause is encountered by an identical SUV which pulls up along side of him and shoots at his head point blank with an automatic weapon. Bruce verves off the road into the desert. The vehicle is unmarked by the gunshot. After driving through bad desert, he comes back on the highway in front of the other SUV! They give chase shooting all the way. The family runs away on foot, only to get met by guys with bad Iranian accents. They get killed in a nick of time.Bruce gets separated from his family. At the base he meets a Chinese scientist who develops an accent as the story moves along and a man with a bozo hair-do with a bad Russian accent. While they are attempting to save the planet, there is someone in his group that is trying to stop the doctor from doing so. Meanwhile the wife and daughter are back at home searching for a necklace in the kitchen of all places. They attempt to meet with their husband at the base, but have to dodge lightening used from ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes."" They decide it is safer to leave the insulated vehicle with 4 rubber tires and run through an open field, dodging lightning. They eventually get aided by a farmer who looks like Tor Johnson (I am required to make 1 Tor Johnson reference every 100 reviews) and he happens to like young teenage girls (who doesn't?). Mom drives his pick-up truck after she knocks out Toj like an expert NASCAR driver and they decide to try to make it to a cave instead, although the cave seems further away than the base.For some reason atomic missiles just can't be launched into space and exploded, they must first go into a space station and launched from there. When the space station goes out, our international trio of scientist head to the space station. Bruce is in the station when it explodes, yet we see him later with his family. There was no Flash Gordon moment when we go back and see his escape. If this ruined it for you. Good.

I think that with wars and rumors of wars, cancer, Fukushima, et al, I'd rather have it all over and done with so we can go to, as that great philosopher Tom Lehrer put it, ""our respective Valhallas"". As for this gigantic elephant turd, it's the kind of movie that in the '70's, I'd turn the tv sound off, turn up KMET L.A.'s rock'n roll, roll up a bomber and pour a big glass of Zinfandel, and kick back chuckling at the awfulness unfolding on the screen. Hey, boys and girls, can you spell tax writeoff? There is actually value in watching some of the sloppiest, lousy moviemaking out there, it glaringly points out how NOT to do it. From a literary standpoint look up 'It Was a Dark and Stormy Night' a compendium of entries to the Bulwer-Lytton contest, which are the fictional opening sentences to the worst novels never written; just hilarious, and very instructive in avoiding common pitfalls that bedevil the unwary Hemingway wannabee.
