Instead it resounds limply, what with everything working out and real change, catharsis completely absent. Scott, despite glowing feelings from other reviews here, seemed bored to me. The direction too left much to be desired, as Scott seems, during one key scene, to be both out of it and riveted, seeing his daughter ""perform."" Scott also has a scene where, perhaps in deference to etiquette (or repressed curiosity?), he allows and ""actor"" to show off his wares. Then later in the game, in a scene between father and daughter there is a hole left gapping, as to what it was that drove her into such a world.For a time piece, of a world where porn and sex weren't as in-your-face as today, Hardcore has significance. When porn films switched titles constantly and were cast out of the classifieds, Hardcore also has a weight. But when porno's were made in motels with the doors and window shades open, and conservative G.C.

It is the perfect description of this movie.  For those of you familiar with George C Scott in ""Patton,"" this movie is a great new side to him.  He brings his typically unhinged persona into his father-figure trying to rescue his wayward daughter from her abduction into the late-70s porn world.  But just how willing is she to come back?  You gotta watch.Schrader is a great writer, but competant director.  He can certainly tell a tale, but while ""Taxi Driver"" is incredible, this is only a journeyman at work as director.  It is a pretty interesting story, but a tad predictable.  But don't let that deter you.  It has enough twists and turns to keep you engaged.  But my personal favorite is the vision of porno hell this picture paints of late 70s California.  When looking at it through today's more jaded eyes, it is almost funny how much this world is caricatured in this movie.  It is almost quaint in comparison to the slimy streets of LA portrayed in ""8mm.""  The fashions and mannerisms of the characters in what was a much more innocent in some ways and much more dangerous world in others compared to today are fascinating.

I saw it in the theater 30 years ago and it was shocking then, so much so that I've only seen it once since and have no desire to see it again. It just left such a bad taste in my mouth.This is a frightening picture of the pornography business 30 years ago featuring about everything you can think of in that seedy world. Unfortunately, the story centers around finding a girl from a ""religous"" family and the father, played by George C. Scott, is painted as something of a fanatic. He's portrayed as a cold and violent figure. (Hey, Hollywood isn't going to portray a Christian father as kind and loving.) Yet, Scott is not all that bad because he still is extremely dedicated father who went to all lengths to get his daughter back.This movie really shows the sleazy side of the entire porno business and, thankfully, it doesn't glamorize any of it. Peter Boyle is good as the detective and Season Hubley is interesting as the prostitute who gives you her ideas on life in the business.This is a fascinating film in parts but also very tough to view in a number of areas. This may sound naive, but when I saw this in 1979, I was stunned that this type of sick-underbelly of a society existed....at least to this degree.

384740,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6303686737,David Baldwin,"[4, 15]","This film has much to recommend it not the least George C. Scott's commanding performance as the anguished Calvinist father searching for his teenage daughter through the seamy milieu of the porn world.  The film's establishing shots of the Midwest Calvinist world are superb as well.  It's when the film explores the porn world where the film get's silly.  Watching Scott delve into this world in various Leisure Suit Larry get-ups going from peep-show to bondage house is laughable.  The film seems more concerned about displaying every form of perversion than about finding Scott's exploited daughter.  It's a credit to Scott's superior acting ability that the film and not he appear silly.  It would also have helped that we knew a little more about his daughter for us to sympathize with his plight.  Peter Boyle also gives a commendable performance as the sleazy detective Scott hires to find his daughter, lest people forget that Boyle was a superb character actor before he became a crotchety couch potato on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"".  This film can also be viewed as a decent time-capsule curio of a time when red light districts thrived before the advent of home video and cyber-porn.

Scott and Peter Boyle. Season Hubley does a good job for her (short) part of the film, reminding me of Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. Supposedly, the crew of that movie (sans Scorsese) made this one as well, and if so it shows. Replace the (annoying) sax music that pops up constantly in that, replace it with the odd organ music from this and replace the world-weary Travis for an uptight religious guy from the red states and you have the basic idea.I was expecting it to be at least half as raw as Taxi Driver based on all that, but it's actually closer to a black comedy (okay, except for the snuff film) with Scott delving into the amateur porn industry and getting throw out of a whorehouse. Peter Boyle manages to be sleazy and likeable at the same time, and there's enough 70's style action to keep you interested (since the actual finding of his daughter seems like an afterthought...she's in movie for about ten seconds before she disappears.)Also...if anyone has seen the Korean movie ''Bad Guy'', this seems like it could have been a big influence on it.

Although the whore Scott befriends and uses (Season Hubley) attempts to draw similarities in these worlds, (Jake feels so little about sex that he dose not even do it and she feels so little about sex that she dose not care who she does it with,) both attiudes are extremely jaded.You get the feeling of nostalgic timebase in this movie. This was before the videotape and internet sex revolution.  This was the times of the smaller church congregations, before the 10,000 seat megachurches.  This was before the times when men could see on the satellite television what used to be shown in peepshows and 8 mm films.lots of symbolism was shown in this film.  My favorite example was after the snuff film producer ""Rattan"" was shot.  He stumbles down the sidewalk bleeding to death then smashes his head in a window display of a porn theater. The next window display has a pornographic image, and the writing above it ""love act"".  Could it  portray the death of Rattan as a love act in his twisted world?",5,"an investigation in two ""hardcore"" worlds",1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,1592,"['movie', 'see', 'dichotomy', 'similarities', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'hardcore', 'First', 'see', 'hardcore', 'world', 'straightlaced', 'Jake', 'VanDorn', 'George', 'C', 'Scott', 'world', 'so', 'structured', 'everything', 'life', 'alphabetized', 'hardcore', 'religious', 'faith', 'such', 'world', 'drove', 'away', 'wife', 'drove', 'away', 'daughter', 'seek', 'warmth', 'world', 'equally', 'hardcore-', 'sleazy', 'world', 'sex', 'industry.These', 'two', 'worlds', 'collide', 'movie', 'Hardcore', 'worlds', 'are', 'completely', 'alien', 'other', 'compromise', 'worlds', 'whore', 'Scott', 'befriends', 'uses', 'Season', 'Hubley', 'draw', 'similarities', 'worlds', 'Jake', 'feels', 'so', 'little', 'sex', 'not', 'even', 'do', 'so', 'little', 'sex', 'dose', 'not', 'care', 'who', 'attiudes', 'are', 'extremely', 'jaded.You', 'get', 'feeling', 'nostalgic', 'timebase', 'movie', 'was', 'videotape', 'internet', 'sex', 'revolution', 'was', 'times', 'smaller', 'church', 'congregations', '10,000', 'seat', 'megachurches', 'was', 'times', 'when', 'men', 'could', 'see', 'satellite', 'television', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'shown', 'peepshows', '8', 'mm', 'films.lots', 'symbolism', 'was', 'shown', 'film', 'favorite', 'example', 'was', 'snuff', 'film', 'producer', 'Rattan', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'sidewalk', 'bleeding', 'death', 'then', 'head', 'window', 'display', 'porn', 'theater', 'next', 'window', 'display', 'pornographic', 'image', 'writing', 'love', 'act', 'Could', 'portray', 'death', 'Rattan', 'love', 'act', 'twisted', 'world']",Hardcore VHS

He and the other actors here, especially Peter Boyle, hold your interest throughout.I also liked the fact that this movie was made in an age when there were no fake boobs, and everything you see here is natural. Heck, women were even allowed to have flat chests in those days, and could still be considered beautiful. (Wish it were still that way!)But I'm getting off track here. The bad part to me - and the reason I don't like the movie - is the character that Scott plays. The man is so crotchety and is such a jerk to everyone that I just could not find myself able or willing to empathize with him. I realize it was part of the character. He would rather beat up people than stoop to asking for help. But I didn't like this.And he never got any better. He never learned. He went back to Michigan just as closed-minded and insufferable as ever.Still, gotta love the shirts that George C. Scott wears in this movie! Those 70's shirts rocked. And the pimp-stache he wore for one scene was hilarious, perhaps intentionally so :)It's also interesting to note that I counted no less than 3 plugs for Star Wars in this movie, which were fairly conspicuous. One of them even involved a lightsaber battle between two topless honeys - I kid you not!",2,I wanted to like it.

This is a story about a Michigan man who is a single parent and lives in a good Christian extended family that he is very close to. His 15 year old daughter inexplicably runs away from home which leads the father to hire a private eye to find her. After several agonizing months the private eye comes to Grand Rapids and takes the father to a dirty movie theater he has rented out and shows him a pornographic film that his daughter is in. The father then goes on a quest to the big city to find his daughter.George C. Scott is the star of the movie as the anguished father. Peter Boyle also shines as the private investigator. This movie is rated R for obvious reasons. It is a kind of fish out of water movie as this devout Christian father plummets into the depths of the seedy underbelly of the adult entertainment business in the 70's. It is a search that takes him to the most nasty of places, peep shows, massage parlors, S&M; places and to the set of porno movies. He also meets and deals with all the people that are a part of this world. Scotts portrayal of the father is fascinating. Seeing him cringe and then become completely undone as he sees his daughters fate on screen is a fathers worst nightmare and he brings that thru to you. He also is like a powder keg as he deals with these scummy people knowing that his daughters life is at risk.Boyle is the P.I. who is totally grey through out most of the movie. He is self serving and out for his own interest but he is also an ally to Scott who knows the underbelly of the big city and who and where to look. But he also has his own motives and is hardly a white knight who feels little sympathy for the fathers plite.Pretty good movie. It is dated but that doesn't hurt this film because it shows the period and social stigmas and mores of this time. Check it out but its not for everyone. If you are a George C.

VanDorn travels to Los Angeles after a private investigator discovers that she has been making stag films. This is perhaps one of George C. Scotts most dramatic and sometimes humerous performances. The scene where the investigator, played by Peter Boyle, show VanDorn the stag film is both shocking and heartbreaking as VanDorn breaks down and crys for him to ""turn it off!"" It is a heartwrenching moment that had me on the verge of tears. Although Scott felt that writer/Director Paul Schrader was an accomplished writer (taxi Driver) he felt that he was a terrible director.

Scott in a riveting, brilliant performance) life and his deeply held religious beliefs are shaken to their core. Van Doren's teenage daughter doesn't return from a church outing. Worried, Van Doran hires a private detective Andy Mast(Peter Boyle)to help track her down. What Mast returns with shakes Van Doren Calvinist faith. His daughter has been appearing in cheap porno movies. Van Doren realizes the only way to bring his daughter back from this seamy, sordid world is if he goes to get her himself. He poses as a porno producer to get leads that will take him to his daughter in hopes that he can get her back before something truly horrible happens to her.This riveting drama from Paul Schrader (""Taxi Driver"")clearly draws from some of Schrader's own convictions and religious beliefs. His upbringing as a Calvinist influences and informs the character of Van Doren. Scott, Boyle ""Outland"", ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), Dick Sargant (""Bewitched""), Season Hubley and Marc Alaimo (""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"")The DVD transfer looks crisp and sharp. Unfortunately, the age of the film and the film stock means that it does look grainy but that actually works in favor of the story capturing the harsh look of porno movies and giving a gritty reality to the film.There's no extras on the film which is a pity. I would love to have heard Schrader's comments on the making of the film 25 years later. While George C. Scott isn't around any longer, Season Hubley and Peter Boyle could also have provided a commentary track (and it would have been less expensive to produce than a featurette on the making of the film). It seems to me I recall a vintage promo piece that was aired on TV during its theatrical run. Including that along with some updated interviews with Boyle, Hubley and producer Buzz Feitshans would have provided extra value here but, knowing the limited budget the producer of the DVD had to work with, it was probably cost prohibitive. It's a pity as this terrific but brutal film certainly deserves far better than just a standard transfer without any extras.",4,Into the heart of darkness...,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,2119,"['Businessman', 'Jake', 'Van', 'Doren', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'riveting', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'life', 'deeply', 'held', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'are', 'shaken', 'core', 'Van', 'Doren', 'teenage', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'return', 'church', 'outing', 'Worried', 'Van', 'Doran', 'private', 'detective', 'Andy', 'Mast', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'help', 'track', 'down', 'What', 'Mast', 'shakes', 'Van', 'Doren', 'Calvinist', 'faith', 'daughter', 'been', 'appearing', 'cheap', 'porno', 'movies', 'Van', 'Doren', 'only', 'way', 'bring', 'daughter', 'back', 'seamy', 'sordid', 'world', 'get', 'porno', 'producer', 'get', 'leads', 'will', 'take', 'daughter', 'hopes', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'something', 'truly', 'horrible', 'happens', 'her.This', 'riveting', 'drama', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'clearly', 'draws', 'Schrader', 'own', 'convictions', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'upbringing', 'Calvinist', 'influences', 'character', 'Van', 'Doren', 'Scott', 'Boyle', 'Outland', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Dick', 'Sargant', 'Bewitched', 'Season', 'Hubley', 'Marc', 'Alaimo', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'Unfortunately', 'age', 'film', 'film', 'stock', 'look', 'grainy', 'actually', 'favor', 'story', 'capturing', 'harsh', 'look', 'porno', 'movies', 'giving', 'gritty', 'reality', 'film.There', 'extras', 'film', 'pity', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'heard', 'Schrader', 'comments', 'making', 'film', '25', 'years', 'later', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'longer', 'Season', 'Hubley', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'provided', 'commentary', 'track', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'expensive', 'produce', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'recall', 'vintage', 'promo', 'piece', 'was', 'aired', 'TV', 'theatrical', 'run', 'Including', 'updated', 'interviews', 'Boyle', 'Hubley', 'producer', 'Buzz', 'Feitshans', 'would', 'have', 'provided', 'extra', 'value', 'here', 'knowing', 'limited', 'budget', 'producer', 'DVD', 'had', 'work', 'was', 'probably', 'cost', 'prohibitive', 'pity', 'terrific', 'brutal', 'film', 'certainly', 'far', 'better', 'just', 'standard', 'transfer', 'extras']",Hardcore VHS
384753,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6303686737,Wuchak,"[3, 3]","Paul Schader's ""Hardcore"" (1979) stars George C. Scott as Jake VanDorn, a rigid Calvinist who goes to Southern California to search for his 15 year-old daughter who disappeared during a church youth convention in Disneyland. A hired p.i. (Peter Boyle) finds his daughter on a cheap porn flick, so Jake eventually masquerades as a porn producer to find her. Ultimately a young, lost prostitute, Niki (Season Hubley), assists him and they develop an interesting relationship.Since ""Hardcore"" deals heavily with the sex industry of the late 70s it's obvious that the film isn't for everyone, but if you can handle it this is a nigh work of genius. Part drama, part thriller, with a bit o' black humor thrown in for good measure, ""Hardcore"" is simply fascinating.As another reviewer so perfectly notes, ""Hardcore"" explores the dichotomy and similarities of people who live 'hardcore.' Jake's Dutch Calvinist religious faith is so hardcore and rigidly structured that he can explain it in-depth with an acronym (TULIP), whereas the sex industry of S. California is hardcore in a ultra-hedonistic manner. The lifestyles couldn't be more different and yet there are similarities. Niki points out to Jake that they aren't so different -- he feels so little about sex that he doesn't even do it, while she cares so little about sex that she doesn't care who she does it with.This is a smart film that doesn't spell everything out, but if you watch it closely details emerge. For instance, why did Jake's daughter fly the coop? Why did his wife divorce him? It becomes clear that the VanDorn household was overly rigid and sterile; there was little life, joy, and love, which are intrinsic Christian qualities. The most toxic poison was Jake's hardcore pride, which he weepingly repents of in one potent scene.But this isn't an anti-Christian film, although it shows the obvious flaws of Jake and his denomination's religiosity, Jake clearly plays the deliverer and the sex industry is portrayed as the ugly, deceitful mire it is. This is one of the few mainstream modern films where the protagonist's Christian faith is overtly depicted. The film doesn't shy away from exploring Jake's faith, and testing it. There's even a prolonged scene where Jake explains the Calvinist credo to Niki. How many Hollywood films allow a character to spend five minutes detailing theological concepts? This alone distinguishes the picture.Despite Jake's serious pride issues and the sterility of his household, his Calvinism comes off better than the hedonism of late 70's L.A. Jake is on a crusade into the land of heathen and is admirable in that he puts himself in harm's way to find his daughter, and he never succumbs in a land of a thousand temptations. If the Midwesterners are depicted as stern and brittle, at least they are better off than the hedonists of S. California, and the sex industry is a slippery slope that leads to dissatisfaction, addiction and death.Some complain that it's not believable that Jake's daughter would take such a radical turn toward the sex industry, but let's keep in mind that it's easy for a naive, inexperienced girl to get swept up into something she can't control. Also, don't think that she chose the new life knowing everything up front. It's a slow spiral into hell. The first few steps are exciting and the rest are horrible but tolerable. As you descend, the cumulative effect is balanced by the hardness one gains. You aren't 'hardcore' the moment you step off the bus, so to speak.The first hour starts to get rather tedious with Jake's intro to the sex industry and ensuing search for his daughter but, take heart, the story picks up in the second half with the introduction of Niki. Her relationship with Jake is the heart of the picture. ***SPOILER ALERT*** We meet this totally lost and humble prostitute and we (and Jake) inexplicably come to like her. She was a runaway of sorts who started turning tricks in Vegas at the young age of 15. Can she be blamed for the hideous hole life has thrust her? (In a way, yes, but that's another subject; let's have some compassion here!). She acts hip but at the same time is desperately seeking a savior. Jake merely hires her to help in his search and unexpectedly finds himself getting close to her, enjoying her company, and vice versa. Jake isn't in any way, shape or form an evangelist but he finds that he can open up and freely discuss his Christian beliefs with Niki, and she's just as free and comfortable to discuss her beliefs (she's a Venusian, whatever that is, lol). ""Hardcore"" is so incredible and original because these characters are ""real"" and they really talk. What's more, although Niki is a pathetic, lost prostitute she has amazing insight into things. For instance, although Jake informs her that his wife died, she ""guesses"" that she actually divorced him and also discerns why she left. Yet, she's not arrogant about her insights; she's obviously highly gifted and yet wasting her life away in the sex industry. ***END SPOILER***Some complain about the ending but I think it works pretty well; it's happy in one way but downbeat in another. It rings of authenticity (disregarding the contrived Ratan theatrics, that is). ***SPOILER ALERT*** Jake may be a changed man at the end, but not changed enough to handle bringing a former-prostitute back to Michigan as his quasi-adopted daughter. After he successfully finds his daughter he looks at Niki from a distance and she looks at him to discern his intent (will he offer succor or not?) and she KNOWS the truth and turns away, forever. It's a heartbreaking scene, but I guess more realistic than Jake taking her back to Michigan. Regardless, I wish it would have ended with something more hopeful, like Jake doing SOMETHING to help her out of the pit of prostitution. ***END SPOILER***I was in Las Vegas recently and came across a prostitute like Niki (albeit not as anorexic). She was very young and therefore still beautiful; she looked at me with eyes of feigned desire, likely to pick up some business. In the film these girls are written off as ""a dime a dozen."" I guess no one cares about them.I do",5,Hardcore religion v.s. hardcore hedonism,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,6152,"['Paul', 'Schader', 'Hardcore', '1979', 'stars', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Jake',
