1668502,AMUTYOX234D90,B00EPRIT2K,Bill,"[7, 8]","Of all the classical Blu-rays I've viewed, this one has to be the most relaxing. I expect it will retain that distinction until a Delius disc is released. (Perhaps that's wishful thinking. Is Delius being performed anymore?)The program, as disparate as it appears to be, actually consists of highly complementary works by very different composers. All are gentle, introspective and inspired by folk music themes.The first work, Vaughan Williams' ""Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis"" starts things off on a magical note with long threads of gorgeous sound, and the spell is never broken. It's beautifully done. Bravo, as always, to the Berlin Philharmonic (arguably the world's greatest orchestra), which here seems to feature many new faces.Next up are Dvorak's ""Biblical Songs."" If you're familiar with his opera ""Rusalka"" or at least its famous aria, the ""Song to the Moon,"" then you have a sense of what you'll experience here. These songs are much earthier than, say, those of Richard Strauss, even though they focus on the heavens. There are 10 songs lasting about 25 minutes, and they are done full justice by the lovely mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena (who happens to be married to conductor Simon Rattle). She's very expressive, facially as well as vocally, and conveys great warmth.I should mention here that the Blu-ray's audio balance favors the orchestra, so there are a couple of moments where Kozena's voice is somewhat swamped. Also, the hall (more about it later) is quite reverberant, but one's ears adjust quickly. I'm sure this venue posed a major challenge for the video's sound engineers.Of course, the likelihood of these songs being captured on hi-def video again is remote, so if they are of interest, there's no need to look further than this heartfelt performance.The final piece is Beethoven's 6th Symphony. This highly familiar work -- my favorite among Beethoven's symphonies -- receives an excellent reading here.The setting for this concert is the Spanish Hall at Prague Castle. It's quite stunning, with elaborate ornamentation that goes on for days. The video director is understandably unable to resist lingering over the sculpture-filled, gold-leafed walls and the huge chandeliers featuring busts and cherubs.This performance was captured in May, only months before the Blu-ray's release. The picture quality is perhaps the best I've ever seen. The technology obviously continues to improve, because just when you think the picture can't get any sharper, it does. The audio quality, save for the couple of minor issues mentioned above, is very satisfying.Not long before this performance, Rattle announced that he would be leaving his post with the Berlin Philharmonic in 2018, at which point he will have conducted the orchestra for 16 years. It's been a wonderfully symbiotic relationship, and he'll be greatly missed. Here's hoping EuroArts captures many of their remaining performances together and releases them on Blu-ray.---------------------------------------------------------------I was provided with a review copy of this particular disc, although I've purchased many EuroArts discs (as well as those of other classical music labels) over the years.",5,Relaxing with Rattle,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,3197,"['classical', 'Blu-rays', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'one', 'be', 'most', 'relaxing', 'expect', 'will', 'retain', 'distinction', 'Delius', 'disc', 'released', 'Perhaps', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'Delius', 'being', 'performed', 'anymore', 'program', 'as', 'disparate', 'be', 'actually', 'highly', 'complementary', 'works', 'very', 'different', 'composers', 'are', 'gentle', 'introspective', 'inspired', 'folk', 'music', 'themes.The', 'first', 'work', 'Vaughan', 'Williams', 'Fantasia', 'Theme', 'Thomas', 'Tallis', 'things', 'off', 'magical', 'note', 'long', 'threads', 'gorgeous', 'sound', 'spell', 'never', 'broken', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Bravo', 'always', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'arguably', 'world', 'greatest', 'orchestra', 'here', 'feature', 'many', 'new', 'faces.Next', 'up', 'are', 'Dvorak', 'Biblical', 'Songs', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'opera', 'Rusalka', 'least', 'famous', 'aria', 'Song', 'Moon', 'then', 'have', 'sense', 'what', ""'ll"", 'experience', 'here', 'songs', 'are', 'much', 'earthier', 'say', 'Richard', 'Strauss', 'even', 'focus', 'heavens', 'are', '10', 'songs', 'lasting', '25', 'minutes', 'are', 'done', 'full', 'justice', 'lovely', 'mezzo-soprano', 'Magdalena', 'Kozena', 'who', 'be', 'married', 'conductor', 'Simon', 'Rattle', 'very', 'expressive', 'facially', 'as', 'well', 'vocally', 'conveys', 'great', 'warmth.I', 'should', 'mention', 'here', 'Blu-ray', 'audio', 'balance', 'favors', 'orchestra', 'are', 'couple', 'moments', 'where', 'Kozena', 'voice', 'somewhat', 'swamped', 'Also', 'hall', 'more', 'later', 'quite', 'reverberant', 'one', 'ears', 'adjust', 'quickly', ""'m"", 'sure', 'venue', 'posed', 'major', 'challenge', 'video', 'sound', 'engineers.Of', 'course', 'likelihood', 'songs', 'being', 'captured', 'hi-def', 'video', 'again', 'remote', 'so', 'are', 'interest', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'heartfelt', 'final', 'piece', 'Beethoven', '6th', 'Symphony', 'highly', 'familiar', 'work', 'favorite', 'Beethoven', 'symphonies', 'excellent', 'reading', 'here.The', 'setting', 'concert', 'Spanish', 'Hall', 'Prague', 'Castle', 'quite', 'stunning', 'elaborate', 'ornamentation', 'days', 'video', 'director', 'understandably', 'unable', 'resist', 'lingering', 'sculpture-filled', 'gold-leafed', 'walls', 'huge', 'chandeliers', 'featuring', 'busts', 'cherubs.This', 'performance', 'was', 'captured', 'May', 'only', 'months', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'picture', 'quality', 'perhaps', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'technology', 'obviously', 'improve', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'picture', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'sharper', 'audio', 'quality', 'save', 'couple', 'minor', 'issues', 'mentioned', 'very', 'satisfying.Not', 'long', 'performance', 'Rattle', 'announced', 'would', 'be', 'leaving', 'post', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', '2018', 'point', 'will', 'have', 'conducted', 'orchestra', '16', 'years', 'been', 'wonderfully', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', ""'ll"", 'be', 'greatly', 'missed', 'Here', 'hoping', 'EuroArts', 'many', 'remaining', 'performances', 'together', 'Blu-ray.', '-I', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'copy', 'particular', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'many', 'EuroArts', 'discs', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'classical', 'music', 'labels', 'years']",Europakonzert
1668503,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B00EPRIT2K,I. Giles,"[7, 8]","This concert from Prague continues the tradition of the annual celebratory concerts celebrating the creation of this famous orchestra. Each year the concert is played in a specially chosen venue and the concert program usually has a significant connection with that venue. In this case the connection is through the music of Dvorak.The concert opens with a performance of the Vaughan Williams Thomas Tallis Fantasia for strings. The strings are divided into the main body and a smaller body of players which relates back to the concept of the concerto grosso form of construction. This is a very major work from the last century and is an obvious masterpiece although one suspects that the Prague audience may have been unfamiliar with it. Rattle coaxes and receives from his players a performance of tremendous subtlety, a feature which is made apparent right from the opening phrase. The Berlin players respond wonderfully and one wonders just how many of them will have been enjoying the music for the first time. Expressions and glances of pleasure are caught flitting between players during the performance at various points. This is not a red hot emotional performance such as those given by Barbirolli or Silvestri on CD for example but it is more emotionally engaging than some of the cooler versions such as the magisterial Boult. In short, a fine and satisfying performance of some real perception.The 10 Biblical Songs by Dvorak are a late work and the songs are short biblical settings amounting to about 30 minutes. They are deeply personal statements and are beautifully and radiantly sung with passion and commitment by Magdalena Kozena, otherwise known as Mrs Rattle. This is a section of the concert that communicated directly to the Prague audience which, no doubt, enjoyed the experience of hearing it sung in Czech as written. The subtitles will clearly help to make this an equally enjoyable experience for all those not fluent in Czech. The audience gave this performance the first of the concert's standing ovations.The concert concludes with an equally subtle performance of Beethoven's Pastoral symphony. This is a traditional performance in the sense that speeds are more relaxed than might be expected with the peasants being on their best behaviour, the storm not being too threatening and with the conclusion providing a comforting glow of satisfaction. This could not really be described as a period aware performance nor as a taut and scaled down BPO performance like Abbado's in Rome, also available on Euroarts. Nor was it as heavy weight and idiosyncratic as Thielemann's with the VPO. Rattle played it straight with much detail of phrasing brought out to satisfying effect. In many ways it was much the same type of performance as that given to the opening Vaughan Williams and with all the same virtues. The audience loved it and rose to their feet for a sustained ovation which was continuing as the recording faded out.The recording delivers very crisp imaging with good colour. The camera work provides detail without being invasive. The sound is full and satisfying and is provided in DTS 5.1 and stereo.This is a very satisfying concert with plenty of program interest. It is a high quality production and I would suggest that it would be well worth considering for purchase providing a suitably rewarding experience.........................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:Great Review!My own copy should arrive between November 11th and 15th - I'm excited!Thank you, and best Wishes. (U.K. review)I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one. Your assessments and opinions are invaluable. Thank you. (US review)I particularly like your format of review. They give the prospective purchaser an idea of the style of the playing and relevant comparisons. They are succinct. Keep up the good work! (UK review)I'm sure there are many other serious collectors, besides myself, who wait for your synopsis and opinion before spending their hard-earned money on new releases...Keep up the good work!Thank you  (UK review)............................................A note to the anonymous negative voter:The voting system is specifically only about reviews being 'helpful' or 'unhelpful'Goodness only knows what you find to be `unhelpful' about this review.A negative vote without reason is not helpful to anyone. It does not contribute in any useful way to discussion so no-one can learn from you.If you have a different view or find the review 'unhelpful' then explain, giving your reasons, and share your views in the comment option as intended.Significantly, I know of at least one good reviewer who has finally given up with anonymous negative votes such as has been experienced here and deleted all his reviews. The loss to the whole collecting community is his considerable knowledgeable advice and the gain is his own free time. He cannot be persuaded to return to writing reviews despite my repeated encouragement.Anonymous negative votes without supporting reasons can have other negative results that you may not have thought
