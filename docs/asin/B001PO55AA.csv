1227796,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B001PO55AA,calvinnme,"[3, 10]","These are not the best westerns in the Warner Home Video stable, but they are interesting films nonetheless.""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) has Sam Peckinpah directing a stellar cast in one of his best westerns. Some of the supporting cast could have been better developed, but in the end it is a fine example of the genre in acting, story, and action. This film is available in a special 2 disc edition,The Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition).""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" (1971) is an anti-establishment film typical of the late Vietnam war period that just happens to be set in the old west. There are no heroes to be found, and the outlook is quite cynical. The previous print of this film was released in 2002 and I find the colors to be a bit washed out. Let's hope this is a fresh transfer of this unusual western.""Jeremiah Johnson"" (1972) stars Robert Redford in what is the true story of a mountain man who turns to revenge after his wife and unborn child are killed by Indians. It is more than that, though, as Johnson struggles with survival against the elements prior to all of this tragedy. The latest print of this film was put on DVD in 1997, so the old print is quite VHS-like, for lack of a better term.  Let's hope a better transfer of this film is in this set too.""The Train Robbers"" (1973) is the only film with John Wayne in it, and it is not one of his best, mainly because the so-called bad guys are just not up to the level you expect of any nemesis of The Duke. You expect John Wayne to have worthy opponents and these guys just don't fit the bill. Wayne does have good chemistry with the other players though and he has some good lines as he escorts a widow to a gold mine her husband left for her. The single DVD of this film was made in 2005 or 2007 and looks quite good, so there is really no need for improvement there.",4,Some of the better modern westerns under the control of WHV,1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,1868,"['are', 'not', 'best', 'westerns', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'stable', 'are', 'interesting', 'films', 'nonetheless', 'Wild', 'Bunch', '1969', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'directing', 'stellar', 'cast', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', 'supporting', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'end', 'fine', 'example', 'genre', 'acting', 'story', 'action', 'film', 'available', 'special', '2', 'disc', 'edition', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Original', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'McCabe', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', '1971', 'anti-establishment', 'film', 'typical', 'late', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'period', 'just', 'be', 'set', 'old', 'west', 'are', 'heroes', 'be', 'found', 'outlook', 'quite', 'cynical', 'previous', 'print', 'film', 'was', 'released', '2002', 'find', 'colors', 'be', 'bit', 'washed', 'out', 'Let', 'hope', 'fresh', 'transfer', 'unusual', 'western', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', '1972', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'what', 'true', 'story', 'mountain', 'man', 'who', 'revenge', 'wife', 'unborn', 'child', 'are', 'killed', 'Indians', 'more', 'though', 'Johnson', 'survival', 'elements', 'prior', 'tragedy', 'latest', 'print', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'DVD', '1997', 'old', 'print', 'quite', 'VHS-like', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'Let', 'hope', 'better', 'transfer', 'film', 'set', 'too', 'Train', 'Robbers', '1973', 'only', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'mainly', 'so-called', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'level', 'expect', 'nemesis', 'Duke', 'expect', 'John', 'Wayne', 'have', 'worthy', 'opponents', 'guys', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'bill', 'Wayne', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'other', 'players', 'good', 'lines', 'widow', 'gold', 'mine', 'husband', 'left', 'single', 'DVD', 'film', 'was', 'made', '2005', '2007', 'quite', 'good', 'really', 'need', 'improvement', 'there']",TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Western Adventures (The Wild Bunch / McCabe & Mrs. Miller / Jeremiah Johnson / The Train Robbers)

One wonders if the movies will be good quality prints, free of editing, and perhaps short on extras?  After purchasing this package, may I put to rest the  preceding doubts?  This is a solid series of four movies, very good replications of the originals, and a great buy for the price.  No, you will not get all the extras that each movie packaged alone would have, but then, how often do we actually use (or need) all the extras anyway?  For someone like me, who just wanted to see the movies, this is a bargain and a half.Being a fan of the western genre, I wanted to primarily see ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", as these two films are consistently ranked in the top 50 westerns of all-time.  I was impressed with ""The Wild Bunch"" (4 of 5 stars), much disappointed with the quirky ""McCabe"" (2 of 5 stars), loved Redford as ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (4 of 5 stars), and thought ""The Train Robbers"" was average John Wayne fair at best.

I never saw the others before so I bought this because they are supposedly classics.  If I were only reviewing ""The Wild Bunch"" I'd only give this two stars, maybe three for the good acting. I really hated it, though.  It had no real story and was very violent. There was not one character anyone could like.  That would be fine if the story was good, but it isn't.  The Train Robbers, on the other hand, had characters that were too good to be true.  The ending could be surprising to some, if you had not already guessed that one of the characters was going to turn out to be not what they supposedly seemed.  I guessed that right away at the beginning.  John Wayne was the usual semi-tough guy hero all the men respect.  McCabe & Mrs.Miller was the old West as it was and I really liked that one. It reminded me in some ways of HBOs Deadwood except it did not have all the cursing Deadwood did. The only thing that spoiled that one for me is it played so dark on my old T.V. I could not even see the actors in some of the scenes. When I get the chance, I'm going to play it on one of my newer slim T.V.'s and see if it looks better.

Sam Peckinpah shocked moviegoers and critics with ""The Wild Bunch"" because of the bloody violence. However, the film has stood the test of time for the story and performances of the stars and supporting players alike. It has been a mainstay available over the years in both VHS and DVD. ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" is a classy though oddball western in which cliches are turned upside down and the rambling narrative makes it difficult to tell the good guys from the bad. Warren Beaty is the hero - or is he? ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is still a pure cinematic pleasure to watch no matter how many times you see it. Robert Redford stars as tenderfoot with ambition to become a mountain man. The tough lessons he learns make for a most enjoyable movie. The fourth in the collection, ""The Train Robbers,"" is another in the John Wayne canon made during his later years.
