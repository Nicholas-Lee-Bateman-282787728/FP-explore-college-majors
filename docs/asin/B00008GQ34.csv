Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran reprise their roles as frontier brothers, Travis and Arliss Coates.  Both mother and father (originally played by Fess Parker and Dorothy McGuire in ""Old Yeller"") are away visiting McGuire's sick mother and have left oldest son, Travis in charge of things.  Travis and Arliss are once again at odds with the old issue ""who's in charge?"" with Travis trying to get the work done and Arliss wanting to go off hunting with Savage Sam.  Brian Keith plays the uncle who comes by to check on how the boys are doing and gives advice to Travis on how to handle Arliss a little better.  During the story, Travis, Arliss, and their neighbor's daughter, Lisbeth are taken by Indians.  Brian Keith gathers up some neighboring men to go in search of them, which include Lisbeth's father, Bud Searcy (once again played comically well by Jeff York) and Slim Pickens joins the group for a well rounded western adventure.  The dvd plays with a clean transfer and good sound.

742284,A2VGS4F6A5UNE8,B00008GQ34,"Gary L. Dibert ""the wessel DVD Collector and ...","[1, 1]","Savage Sam was released in the United States on June 1, 1963 starring Brian Keith, Tommy Kirk, and Kevin Corcoran. Savage Sam is the 1963 film sequel to Old Yeller written by Fred Gipson. It was inspired by the story of former Apache captive Herman Lehmann, whom Gipson had seen give an exhibition when he was a child. Norman Tokar directed the live-action film, which was released by Walt Disney on June 1, 1963.Summary: The picture opens with Arliss coming outside and spotting his dog Sam chasing a bobcat. Now both of Arliss parents are back East attending to their Grandma leaving Travis in charge. As in Old Yeller, Travis and Arliss are at war as Travis tries to get Arliss to get some work done. Arliss wants to go hunting with his dog Sam and Travis won't let him. Therefore, Arliss who can't shoot a gun but can really throw rocks starts to throw them at Travis. Arliss has Travis pend down in the family out house when a man on a horse rides into the farm. The man turns out to be the boy's Uncle Buck. Uncle Buck tells Arliss that his daddy use to do the same thing to him when they were young, bossing him around telling him to do this and that. Travis and Arliss are out in the fields working when Sam gets into a fight with a bobcat and Arliss takes Jumper the mule and takes off chasing them. Travis goes back to the family farm where he finds Bud Searcy and his daughter Lisbeth riding telling Travis that there are Indians in the area. Bud goes into the house to eat while Travis and Lisbeth get on a horse looking for Arliss and Jumper. Travis goes up into the mountains with Lisbeth on the horse when they hear a ruckus going on. Travis gets down investigating only to find Arliss and Sam in a hole fighting the bobcat. Travis pulls Arliss out and just then, some wild horses and Indians going riding pass them.Questions: Is what Travis saw real Indians? Did the Indians take Travis, Lisbeth, and Arliss? If they did take them, where did they go? Does Uncle Buck find out about the boys? If so, what does Buck do about it? Does Buck ever find the boys? How does the dog Sam play into all of this?My thoughts: The film received poor reviews and fell short of box office expectations, paling in comparison with Old Yeller. Pat Hogan appears as tribesman Broken Nose. Dean Fredericks, formerly Steve Canyon on NBC, played a Comanche chief in this film. The beginning of the movie wasn't bad if you can get through the opening song which was really bad. The character Arliss had a real mouth on that boy and if I had been his big brother, I would tan the britches of that boy. I thought the cross-country scenery the Indians took with the wild horses was great. It was nice to see some of the old timers that used to play on Gunsmoke show them acting in a movie instead of just on TV. This movie didn't have a leading lady but it wasn't boring either so I'm going to give this movie 6 weasel stars.

742286,A3JJWHINQVAN5I,B00008GQ34,Karl Spence,"[28, 32]","Disney's ""Savage Sam"" is an entertaining and authentically staged presentation of the Fred Gipson story. It's presented in square-screen format, but since Disney films of this type were produced with eventual TV airings in mind, the cropping of the image is minimal and no action is lost. The quality of the image is good. It's not a ""Vault Disney"" piece like the other Gipson story, ""Old Yeller,"" but it's worth having even without bells and whistles.One thing that didn't age as well as the rest of the film is the title song. Really hokey. But after that's over, the story is told in a no-nonsense style. It dramatizes something Texas settlers contended with for four decades: the abduction of children in an Indian raid.As befits a family film, ""Savage Sam"" soft-pedals the realities of such raids. Tommy Kirk's character, a teenage boy, would have been treated more harshly. Torture on the trail and a horrendous death upon arrival at the tribe's base camp would have been his fate. The teenage girl would have been raped right off. But Kevin Corcoran's character, a young child, would have been taken for adoption, just as the film shows, and the Indians' good-humored toleration of his combativeness is right in line with that.All in all, a serious depiction of a slice of history that few Americans learn about in school anymore.",4,"Fine, no frills presentation",1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,1337,"['Disney', 'Savage', 'Sam', 'entertaining', 'authentically', 'staged', 'presentation', 'Fred', 'Gipson', 'story', 'presented', 'square-screen', 'format', 'Disney', 'films', 'type', 'were', 'produced', 'eventual', 'TV', 'airings', 'mind', 'cropping', 'image', 'minimal', 'action', 'lost', 'quality', 'image', 'good', 'not', 'Vault', 'Disney', 'piece', 'other', 'Gipson', 'story', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'worth', 'having', 'even', 'bells', 'whistles.One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'age', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'film', 'title', 'song', 'Really', 'hokey', 'over', 'story', 'told', 'no-nonsense', 'style', 'something', 'Texas', 'settlers', 'contended', 'four', 'decades', 'abduction', 'children', 'Indian', 'raid.As', 'family', 'film', 'Savage', 'Sam', 'soft-pedals', 'realities', 'such', 'raids', 'Tommy', 'Kirk', 'character', 'teenage', 'boy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'more', 'harshly', 'Torture', 'trail', 'horrendous', 'death', 'arrival', 'tribe', 'base', 'camp', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fate', 'teenage', 'girl', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'raped', 'right', 'Kevin', 'Corcoran', 'character', 'young', 'child', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'adoption', 'just', 'film', 'shows', 'Indians', 'good-humored', 'toleration', 'combativeness', 'right', 'line', 'that.All', 'serious', 'depiction', 'slice', 'history', 'few', 'Americans', 'learn', 'school', 'anymore']",Savage Sam

The book is based on the true story of a former Apache captive. William Tunberg wrote the screenplay. Walt Disney was against sequels and rarely supported them. He had to have a really good script before he would give it a green light. Directed by Norman Tokar, produced by Bill Anderson. Music composed by Disney veteran Oliver Wallace. Technicolor Released first to theaters on June 6, 1963. It aired as a two episode show on the Walt Disney television show ""Wonderful World of Color"" on NBC in October 2, & 9, 1966. The title song was released by Disney Records on a 45, ""Savage Sam And Me,"" performed by The Wellingtons, with ""Old Yeller"" on the B Side. Character actor Royal Dano appears in the movie, and was selected by Walt to record the voice of the audio-animatronic figure of President Abraham Lincoln for the ""Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln"" show at the Worlds Fair in 1964. The attraction later moved to Disneyland.THE STORY: The two brothers from the first cast are reunited, played by Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran. Sam is the pup of Old Yeller, and is played by a Blue Tick Coon Hound.  Disney regular Brian Keith plays the part of their dad's younger brother who checks in on them and provides guidance. And the boys are once again fighting over who is the boss, right where they left off in the first movie.  Things get really scary when some local kids are kidnapped by Indians, and once again the family dog is in the middle of protecting them with his tracking and fighting skills. Slim Pickens appears as Willy Crup, and Jeff York returns as Bud Searcy.DVD: Image is clean, colors are good, but it is in full screen.  Sound is clean and reconfigured to Dolby Digital 5.1 surround from the original mono sound.  No extras, except for Disney commercials. Running 104 minutes, about 20 minutes longer than the first movie.BEFORE YOU BUY: There is another DVD version of this movie that has both Old Yeller and Savage Sam in the same package.
