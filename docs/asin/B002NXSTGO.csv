I went out and within the first few days bought the Vol 1 & 2 for Season 1 and have not bought any since.  Why would I want to waste my time buying something for x amount of dollars for a few episodes when I can pay the same amount before for half a season.  Who do we need to contact to spread the word to say ""Season Sets"".  The problem is with nobody buying these sets they will not release anymore DVD's.

We got the full treatment with Season One Vol 1 and 2 but now it seems like miscellaneous episodes in no particular orders are being put out a few at a time.

Do you realize how many smurf cartoons there were and to bring out 5 every 6 to 8 months apart?  I'll be in retirement before they're even halfway through the list.
