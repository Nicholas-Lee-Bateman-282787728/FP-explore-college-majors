Normally I feel it is a waste of my time to write something negative but this time I would like to save anyone thinking of buying this a little money. If you MUST own all the Masters of Horror then buy this otherwise don't waste your time, it is an hour of your life that you will never get back. I am hard put to understand why the other MOH directors would even consider this poor offering from Mick Garris in the same league as the other stories if for no other reason that this ""story"" makes all the others seem that much better. It is poorly written (by Mr. Garris) and is overall incredibly empty. The only thing anyone watching this can be left to wonder at the end of the ""movie"" is WHY? Maybe the true horror here is in the idea that people will actually sit through an entire viewing of this garbage...now that is frightning!! This can't even be catagorized as so bad it's good.

After he manages to trace them to a young woman living in Canada (Stacy Grant), he decides to meet her with tragic results.I've about had it with this series.  What wasted potential!  Of the several episodes I've seen so far, only Tobe Hooper's ""Dance of the Dead"" has delivered.  This episode isn't really horror.  It's more of a psychological thriller without any thrills.  It begins intriguingly enough (I always come to these episodes with a lot of goodwill because I really want to like them), but it soon becomes apparent that we have nothing but a random hodgepodge of psychic phenomena and betrayed lovers, none of which is tied together very well.Don't misunderstand me.  I don't always need everything explained and wrapped up in a tidy package for me, but there are two kinds of ambiguity.  One leaves with the impression that somewhere beneath the surface of events is a coherent explanation for what we have seen if we could just uncover it.  The other reveals a director and/or screenwriter who doesn't know how to conclude the story.

978454,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000ERVKLW,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","A divorced man, Jamie (Henry Thomas) has his life turned upside down when he becomes psychically linked to a mysterious woman and begins to witness and experience her life through his senses. He begins to feel what she feels, see what she sees, taste what she tastes etc. Those around him begin to question his irrational behavior but little does he care because he becomes obsessed with this women plaguing his mind and sets off to Canada to locate her. The woman in question is a bombshell with a murderous streak and the love struck Jamie's feelings towards her reaches a dangerous level of infatuation.I am somewhat surprised at the beating this episode has received from the viewers. I agree that as a horror short, it falls flat as there is nothing remotely scary in the story or execution. It is a thriller at best and the story is intriguing. When compared to other entries of the series, ""Chocolate"" is rather tame despite a few scenes of bare breasted babes. I think this may have worked better as a ""Twilight Zone"" episode once upon a time (minus the nudity, shower scene of course) but I do find this a refreshing change of tone from the rest of the series. Many of which are loud, gory displays of excess. This installment does not go for the jugular and takes a much more milder approach. I was also impressed with Henry Thomas' performance. He plays his part with subtlety and despite scenes of outrageousness (the shower scene, the intercourse scene), he doesn't over-do it. It is true that his character is one note. There really isn't much to work with until he starts receiving these sensory/mental signals from afar, but once he's totally immersed into this woman's life, his performance is believable and his recounting of the events is well done.Despite the negative reviews, ""Chocolate"" is one of the more intriguing episodes of the MOH series. The performances are good and the story is interesting enough to hold your interest. Where this fails, is in its unfulfilling climax and execution. Garris could have made this one truly frightening by throwing in some other twists and/or more tension filled scenes. Other than the mystery of the origins of this stranger plaguing Jamie's fantasies/reality, there is very little suspense here. There are no moments of dread so once you reach the final act; you may be left wanting more. What you get may leave you short but the overall experience may make it worthwhile.

978455,A1I8F97AHES8YD,B000ERVKLW,George Graham,"[0, 0]","The MASTERS OF HORROR series was created by Mick Garris, so his entry would have to be pretty great, huh? Well, to some, his entry, 'Chocolate', is probably a mind trip and very good. To others, it's a different brown entity besides chocolate.I am somewhere in the middle. I found it interesting, and definitely different. The other directors in the series opted for psychological or flat-out physical terror. 'Chocolate', on the other hand, is not meant to scare as much as it is meant to intrigue or cause mild quivers. It has many sexual undertones as well, enough so to make teenage boys interested in this entry. Nudity, guys, nudity.Anyway, nudity aside, 'Chocolate' is about a man played by Henry Thomas who is a divorcee and really has nothing going on in his life. His job is to basically study different tastes, which becomes more than just an occupation when he begins to taste chocolate, someone else's chocolate (oooh, or is it ew?). Then he sees, hears, and feels like someone else, a young woman to be exact, and this becomes both a blessing and a curse (a blessing as it finally gives him the feelings he sorely lacks, a curse as sometimes he sees and feels things he doesn't want to). He decides to track the woman down after murder comes into the equation, and the plot thickens...So 'Chocolate' is not a bad entry, just not the best.

978456,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000ERVKLW,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 1]","Mick Garris created the Showtime ""Masters of Horror"" series, so it is quite a surprise to discover that his first contribution to the show could not be properly called ""horror"" at all, let alone ""masterful.""Mick has made a living out of adapting Stephen King novels for the screen (and we all know how those usually turn out), so it's no wonder that this little vignette plays like a short story with all the good parts cut out.  Jamie (played by a mealy-mouthed Henry Thomas) is lonely, divorced, and living on old toast when he begins to experience all of the sensations of a beautiful Canadian woman.  He smells what she smells, sees what she sees, feels what she feels.  (In true ""Masters of Horror"" fashion, many of these shared sensations involve sex and nudity.)  Ever more obsessed, Jamie tracks this woman down, only to discover her HORRIFYING SECRET!What is her horrifying secret?  I'll tell you![SPOILER ALERT]She is not a very nice person.  Also, for some reason, she keeps a gun under her couch.  I'm not joking.[END OF SPOILERS]But seriously, this is just very, very bad entertainment.  In fact, the most creative part of the entire show is little more than a lame inside joke.  At one point, we catch a glimpse of a Stephen King novel, ""Desperation,"" on Jamie's nightstand.  Ho ho!  Garris directed the TV adaptation of ""Desperation,"" which just so happened to star both Thomas and Matt Frewer (who, in ""Chocolate,"" has the only interesting character: Jamie's co-worker, Wally -- scientist-by-day, mohawked rock-n-roller by night).The story of ""Chocolate"" is told in flashback by Jamie, who is sitting in a dark room, under a lamp, covered in blood.  He is being questioned by a cop, and his dull, pointless story unfolds as he answers each inquiry.  At the very end, when the cop has heard every, last, mind-numbing detail, the cop gives the penultimate line of the show:  ""That's a hard story to sell.""You're right, Unnamed Cop.

978457,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B000ERVKLW,Matthew King,"[3, 6]","John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, Dario Argento, Joe Dante, Don Coscarelli, Takashi Miike. These are but some of the powerhouse names in horror that were enlisted to direct episodes of ""Masters of Horror"", a 13-episode series that debuted last fall on the Showtime network. Comparisons to other TV horror anthologies such as Tales from the Crypt, Twilight Zone and Friday the 13th were inevitably made but ""Masters"" decidedly differs from those in several aspects as there is no host, no commercials and little trace of humor/camp. No, Masters of Horror is a no-holds barred hardcore horror anthology that gives full creative freedom to its directors, many of them names that have been known to not pull any punches whatsoever.What I particularly like about the show is that there is no guiding voice, or TV producer, telling the director how things should be. Each episode has the director's own personal stamp on it, to give us the feeling that ""This is not a masters of horror episode, it's a Dario Argento movie, or a Takashi Miike movie, etc."" The result of this creative freedom and unique concept is an anthology where every episode feels uniquely distinct from one another.""Chocolate"" is directed by the series creator himself, Mick Garris.  Garris said he got the idea to make this show at a horror-director's luncheon where he approached the directors with the idea and the rest, as we all know, is history.  Garris has made a name for himself within made-for-TV horror, in particular through his numerous Stephen King adaptations such as ""Sleepwalkers"", ""The Stand"", ""The Shining (TV)"", ""Riding the Bullet"" and more recently, ""Desperation"".Story:  A Chicago man (played by Henry Thomas) who creates artificial flavors for the food industry begins to experience the sensations of a female unknown to him through sight, sound, smell, touch.  Pretty soon he becomes obsessed with this female stranger who he's never met and goes to Vancouver to attempt to track her down.How ironic that the series creator's entry would be perhaps the most mediocre of the series.  First off, this doesn't feel like horror but more like a mediocre episode of The Outer Limits.  Not a terrible one, just a mediocre one.  It's presented to us as a weird character study yet I felt little emotional attachment to the character even as he stumbles through painfully awkward moments to watch such as when he spazzes out in bed next to a girl he brought home for the night and when his ex-wife and son stumble onto them.  Moments like this make this episode thoroughly unpleasant to watch (and I don't mean this in a good way, horror fans of the world).Worst of all, the story and its denouements make NO sense whatsoever.  What led to all this?  If it's somehow meant to be due to a workplace incident involving the chemicals he works with then how come his co-worker didn't catch it too?  Then we find out that the girl feels the same things he does, even though they're total strangers who live hundreds of miles apart and who've never met, now somehow psychically linked together?  Argh!!!  This story felt like it was written as a brainstorming experiment gone horribly wrong.So why bother watching ""Chocolate""?  Well, there's plenty of hot chicks.  Who get semi-nude.  That's the only valid reason I can think of, from a male point of view.  Also, Masters of Horror completists such as myself will have to watch it, but that's it.

In fact, it was one of my favorites.  Much of the Master of Horror series is filled with gore for no apparent reason.

Garris himself, who also directed the TV adaptations of Stephen King's The Shining, The Stand, Desperation, and Riding the Bullet, makes his MOH directorial debut with Chocolate, and as a previous reviewer so excellently stated, the taste in your mouth that Chocolate leaves doesn't live up to it's namesake.  Henry Thomas plays a man who begins to experience the sensations of a woman (Stacy Grant) in Canada, and he looks to track her down.  What follows is much less an exercise in horror and instead pure boredom with zilch in the way of any thrills.  Now I admire what Garris has done with Masters of Horror and many of the directors (John Carpenter, Don Coscarelli, Tobe Hooper, Joe Dante, John Landis, Lucky McKee, Larry Cohen, Takishi Miike, and more) he has enlisted, but as a screenwriter and director, he frequently fumbles.  Chocolate is no different, and it is an ultimate failure on every level, and may very well be the worst episode of Masters of Horror to see the light of day.

I am tired of watching movies that claim to be horror and are more of a suspense film. This would have been a perfect film for the ""Twilight Zone"", but not for ""Masters of Horror"". If you are expecting to be scared or are looking for something dark and dreary don't look here. I wouldn't want to waste your time expecting to see anything that resembles horror here. I have been disappointed so far by the ""Masters of Horror"" films. I was expecting more and was completly disappointed. If your going to claim to be a master of horror then please present us something that resembles horror at least. Look at the ""GhostHouse Underground collection"", or ""8 films to die for collection"". These films at least resemble horror films. Not all are great, but at least they are what they claim to be.

It also shows the unpredictabilty of the unknown.I did enjoy watching this movie, but DON'T make the mistake of comparing any single Masters of Horror entry to another.
