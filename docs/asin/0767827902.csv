19261,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0767827902,Acute Observer,"[1, 19]","The Last Picture Show, 1973 filmTwo young men in a pickup truck stop at a pool hall. The radio plays a Hank Williams' song. The men talk about the local football team. The hard hats suggest workers in oil construction. One young man goes to the local movie theater to meet his girlfriend. Another couple joins them. [That movie poster suggests the late 1940s. That cash register does not have a marble top.] Next day students are in an English class. Then the boys are in a gym. Note the dirt roads of a rural town. [These towns are dependent on the local economy, either in agriculture or minerals.] JC has her own car, unusual in those days. Her Mom talks to JC about love and marriage. Elsewhere a woman gets a ride to the clinic. She comes out sad. [Garages are needed to prevent damage from hail.] She cries when she returns home.When the parents are away a teenager throws a party. A man dances with his boss' wife. There is a live band. JC gets a present from her boyfriend; and more. There is a conflict with Dwayne. Later JC goes to that pool party and denudes herself. [Believable in a small town of that era?] The boys pull a prank on Billy, Sam bans them from his pool hall. Dwayne drives that woman again, then comes inside her bedroom. They become friendly. There is another Hank Williams song. Sam and Billy enter the caf&eacute;. The story runs on, recreating small town life circa 1951. But human nature doesn't change much. There is more change in a person over the decades. Two boys decide on a week-end vacation in Mexico. When they return they learn Sam had a stroke and died! His stores were divided. JC meets a boy in the ""Cactus Motel"". [No small town gossip?] Dwayne hesitates. What happened?People wait outside. ""It can't describe it in words."" Next time its different. JC has a new boyfriend. Dwayne leaves for a job out of town. JC's new boyfriend married another girl! JC wants to see the pool hall. A man takes her there. They are alone. JC cries when she returns home. There is a report about a missing girl, she is found with an older boy. What happened? JC and her boyfriend go for a ride. Dwayne bought a new Mercury. After JC goes to college her local boyfriends will be dropped. An argument leads to a fight and hospitalization. Dwayne will join the Army.JC is mean like her grandma. JC marries, her parents are quite upset! The police are notified and find them. [The talk pads out the story.] Football is the big interest; as in other small towns. [Ritualized combat?] They visit the movie theater before it closes down [a movie about cowboys]. Television has taken its audience. The soldier leaves town on a bus. His friend will take care of his Mercury. There is an accident on the street! What was he doing? He visits that older woman, she shows her anger. And the story runs down, like a mechanical clock. How much of it seems believable?This is based on a novel by Larry McMurtry. It attempts to recreate small town life in rural Texas around 1950. This was probably not much different from other small towns across the country. One problem is the presence of television. There is a limit to transmission even in flat lands. The station had to be in a big city about 50 miles away. Religion plays a big role in small town life, yet there is no mention here. This is not so much ""bad"" as it is ""not good"". One advantage is the music: the country & western songs seldom played in big city areas today.",1,Recreating the Past,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,3442,"['Last', 'Picture', 'Show', '1973', 'filmTwo', 'young', 'men', 'pickup', 'truck', 'stop', 'pool', 'hall', 'radio', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'song', 'men', 'talk', 'local', 'football', 'team', 'hard', 'hats', 'suggest', 'workers', 'oil', 'construction', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'local', 'movie', 'theater', 'meet', 'girlfriend', 'couple', '[', 'movie', 'poster', 'late', '1940s', 'cash', 'register', 'not', 'have', 'marble', 'top', ']', 'Next', 'day', 'students', 'are', 'English', 'class', 'Then', 'boys', 'are', 'gym', 'Note', 'dirt', 'roads', 'rural', 'town', '[', 'towns', 'are', 'dependent', 'local', 'economy', 'either', 'agriculture', 'minerals', ']', 'JC', 'own', 'car', 'unusual', 'days', 'Mom', 'talks', 'JC', 'love', 'marriage', 'Elsewhere', 'woman', 'ride', 'clinic', 'out', 'sad', '[', 'Garages', 'are', 'needed', 'prevent', 'damage', 'hail', ']', 'cries', 'when', 'parents', 'are', 'away', 'teenager', 'party', 'man', 'boss', 'wife', 'live', 'band', 'JC', 'present', 'boyfriend', 'more', 'conflict', 'Dwayne', 'Later', 'JC', 'pool', 'party', 'Believable', 'small', 'town', 'era', ']', 'boys', 'pull', 'prank', 'Billy', 'Sam', 'pool', 'hall', 'Dwayne', 'woman', 'again', 'then', 'bedroom', 'become', 'friendly', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'song', 'Sam', 'Billy', 'enter', 'caf', 'eacute', 'story', 'recreating', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'circa', '1951', 'human', 'nature', ""n't"", 'change', 'much', 'more', 'change', 'person', 'decades', 'Two', 'boys', 'decide', 'week-end', 'vacation', 'Mexico', 'When', 'return', 'learn', 'Sam', 'had', 'stroke', 'died', 'stores', 'were', 'divided', 'JC', 'boy', 'Cactus', 'Motel', '[', 'No', 'small', 'town', 'gossip', ']', 'Dwayne', 'hesitates', 'What', 'happened', 'People', 'wait', 'outside', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'words', 'Next', 'time', 'different', 'JC', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Dwayne', 'job', 'town', 'JC', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'married', 'girl', 'JC', 'see', 'pool', 'hall', 'man', 'are', 'alone', 'JC', 'cries', 'when', 'home', 'report', 'missing', 'girl', 'found', 'older', 'boy', 'What', 'happened', 'JC', 'boyfriend', 'go', 'ride', 'Dwayne', 'bought', 'new', 'Mercury', 'JC', 'college', 'local', 'boyfriends', 'will', 'be', 'dropped', 'argument', 'fight', 'hospitalization', 'Dwayne', 'will', 'join', 'Army.JC', 'mean', 'grandma', 'JC', 'marries', 'parents', 'are', 'quite', 'upset', 'police', 'are', 'notified', 'find', '[', 'talk', 'out', 'story', ']', 'Football', 'big', 'interest', 'other', 'small', 'towns', '[', 'Ritualized', 'combat', 'visit', 'movie', 'theater', 'down', '[', 'movie', 'cowboys', ']', 'Television', 'taken', 'audience', 'soldier', 'town', 'bus', 'friend', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'Mercury', 'accident', 'street', 'What', 'was', 'doing', 'older', 'woman', 'anger', 'story', 'down', 'mechanical', 'clock', 'How', 'much', 'believable', 'based', 'novel', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'recreate', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'rural', 'Texas', '1950', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'other', 'small', 'towns', 'country', 'One', 'problem', 'presence', 'television', 'limit', 'transmission', 'even', 'flat', 'lands', 'station', 'had', 'be', 'big', 'city', '50', 'miles', 'away', 'Religion', 'big', 'role', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'mention', 'here', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'One', 'advantage', 'music', 'country', 'western', 'songs', 'seldom', 'played', 'big', 'city', 'areas', 'today']",N/A

19263,AGEIT17HENDIS,0767827902,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","This review is based on the book by Larry McMurtry who also co-wrote the screen play. Most of the points made here about the book apply to the movie. I would only add that in the book the football coach's wife Ruth is given a more sympathetic portrayal. As for the rest Bottoms, Bridges and Cybil Sheppard do a good, if not great, job as youth in a dying, (or semi-dying) Texas boom town looking to get the hell out one way or another.There has been no shortage of coming of age stories in modern American literature. J. D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is merely the most famous and probably widely known of the genre. Here Larry McMurtry, the Texas bibliophile, Old West aficionado and pack rat gives us his take on growing up absurd in a faded semi- boom town Texas during the Korean War era early 1950's.Although the locale is different from Catcher in the Rye the issues raised by the teenagers who drive the story and those of their perplexed and clueless parents are the same. And what does those issues entail? Sex, the meaning of existence, sex, what to do on Friday night, sex, what to do on Saturday night, sex- well you get the drift. And those dilemmas of youth and its fight for recognition as presented through the main characters Sonny and Duane are in McMurtry's hands well thought out and, at times, poignant. The attention to detail that McMurtry is noted for is on full display in the interplay between the 'jock' students, the nerds and the 'in' crowd. High school football, the whys and wherefores of the high school classroom and the shear fight to find one's own identity in this mix all contribute to a very strong trip down memory lane for this reader.From my own personal experience I know how tough it was to grow up in the 1950's and it is good to see that there are indeed some universal ailments that are common to the 'tribal community' called youth in America. Moreover, read this book because it also has a few things to say about the adults, especially Sonny's lover the older woman and the football coach's wife Ruth, and their dilemmas as well. Damn, McMurtry is singing my song.",4,Growing Up in 1950's Texas,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,2116,"['review', 'based', 'book', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screen', 'play', 'Most', 'points', 'made', 'here', 'book', 'apply', 'movie', 'would', 'only', 'add', 'book', 'football', 'coach', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'given', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'rest', 'Bottoms', 'Bridges', 'Cybil', 'Sheppard', 'do', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'job', 'youth', 'dying', 'semi-dying', 'Texas', 'boom', 'town', 'looking', 'get', 'hell', 'one', 'way', 'another.There', 'been', 'shortage', 'coming', 'age', 'stories', 'modern', 'American', 'literature', 'J.', 'D.', 'Salinger', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'merely', 'most', 'famous', 'probably', 'widely', 'known', 'genre', 'Here', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'Texas', 'bibliophile', 'Old', 'West', 'aficionado', 'pack', 'rat', 'take', 'growing', 'up', 'absurd', 'faded', 'semi-', 'boom', 'town', 'Texas', 'Korean', 'War', 'era', 'early', ""1950's.Although"", 'locale', 'different', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'issues', 'raised', 'teenagers', 'who', 'drive', 'story', 'perplexed', 'clueless', 'parents', 'are', 'same', 'what', 'issues', 'entail', 'Sex', 'meaning', 'existence', 'sex', 'what', 'do', 'Friday', 'night', 'sex', 'what', 'do', 'Saturday', 'night', 'sex-', 'well', 'get', 'drift', 'dilemmas', 'youth', 'fight', 'recognition', 'presented', 'main', 'characters', 'Sonny', 'Duane', 'are', 'McMurtry', 'hands', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'times', 'poignant', 'attention', 'detail', 'McMurtry', 'noted', 'full', 'display', 'interplay', ""'jock"", 'students', 'nerds', ""'in"", 'crowd', 'High', 'school', 'football', 'whys', 'wherefores', 'high', 'school', 'classroom', 'shear', 'fight', 'find', 'one', 'own', 'identity', 'mix', 'contribute', 'very', 'strong', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'reader.From', 'own', 'personal', 'experience', 'know', 'how', 'tough', 'was', 'grow', 'up', '1950', 'good', 'see', 'are', 'indeed', 'universal', 'ailments', 'are', 'common', ""'tribal"", 'community', 'called', 'youth', 'America', 'Moreover', 'read', 'book', 'also', 'few', 'things', 'say', 'adults', 'especially', 'Sonny', 'lover', 'older', 'woman', 'football', 'coach', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'dilemmas', 'well', 'Damn', 'McMurtry', 'singing', 'song']",N/A
19264,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767827902,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","Recently I've been working hard to compile my `Top 100 Films of All Time', a list that is completely subjective (I know) but one that is really important I think to any film lover.  We all have our favorite films, those that reach us, move us and emotionally complete us.  When constructing that list, one film made it fairly high; `The Last Picture Show'.  The first time I saw this film I was stunned.  I think a better way to say that is that I felt emotionally crippled.  It was a polarizing film that spoke to me in ways I wasn't prepared for.  The second time I saw this film I started to put a few things together and found myself moved to tears as apposed to merely frozen in the emotional shock of it all.  I've now seen this film a few handfuls of times and have grown to appreciate it more and more for it's each and every perfected cranny.There are not many films that I can say this about, but `The Last Picture Show' is utterly perfect.  It's not `nearly perfect' or `perfectly flawed' but this is absolutely PERFECT.`The Last Picture Show' is a delicately yet extremely precise telling of small town life through the eyes of a group of lost souls.  At the center of the group is young Sonny Crawford.  It seems as if everyone around Sonny is pulling at him, trying to absorb him in order to sustain their own survival.  Whether it is a subtle drain, from the likes of Sam (who treats Sonny like a son) and Lois Farrow (who seeps into Sonny through her daughter), or a significant one, like that from the likes of Ruth Popper (who needs Sonny to escape her marriage) and Jacy Farrow (who craves attention so much she'd use Sonny to get it), the fact remains that Sonny is not his own person but a prop used by those around him at their convenience.One of my friends mentioned his one grip with this film is that he felt it was `a bit too calculated to offer the perfect combo of nostalgia + criticism of a time' but I think I have to counter that with the thought that it is within that `calculation' that the nostalgia and criticism's can truly coexist.  Without that slight calculation (at times I admit it is stronger than others) I feel that the film might have come across rather uneven.  You have the warm feeling of `home' mixed with that cold feeling of `alienation' that needs to be read as sincere and earnest.  With the calculation comes a sharp sense of detachment that actually creates within itself a beautiful sense of emotional collapse that helps breathe a life into both of these aspects of the film.We understand the desperate desire to flee from the claustrophobic surroundings that trap and suffocate, but we also see and feel the fear of leaving such a place, for it is all these individuals know and, believe it or not, love.To me, the best example of this is found within Lois Farrow (beautifully played by Ellen Burstyn).  There is a scene where she speaks to Sonny about Sam, and you can see in that one scene very real layers of grief stripped away from her as she reminisces of the good times, with tears and smiles.  It is such a natural and genuine performance (best in show and clearly should have won the Oscar) that sums up the soul of the film for me.This is a story of the need to break free from all the binds, yet the need to remember all that kept one alive.Across the board, the acting is fantastic.  Aside from Burstyn there is Ben Johnson, who delivers such a beautifully sincere portrait of small town life.  He is the powerful presence that reaches all whom he touches.  Jeff Bridges is wonderfully used here, exhibiting all sorts of star-making bravado without ever once appearing to be an actor.  Cybill Shepherd is not just a pretty face here, as some have claimed.  Her quiet agony over the lack of love she receives from her family is seen in many scenes, and the joyous expression she wears when she seems to feel their love is just outstanding.  A quiet and often overlooked performance is Eileen Brennan, who is just beautifully honest as Genevieve, and of course Cloris Leachman's Oscar winning performance is THAT GOOD (even if Burstyn was better).  Her complete reclusion into her sadness is emotionally battering, and the way she controls such a dramatic presence is astounding for such a comedic firehouse.Timothy Bottoms is the center of the film, and sadly because of that he becomes more of a canvas than a substantial force.  He delivers beautifully, but he is more an observer and thus makes less of an impression than the supporting cast that engulfs him.  His performance for me is reminiscent of Brad Pitt's in `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' in that respect, but he gives a fuller and more memorable performance than Pitt.In the end, I have to urge you to see this film if you have not already.  There are few films that can capture so much with such ease.  Every time I watch this masterpiece I am brought to another place and time and given something new to chew on.  The more I see it, the better it gets, and that's impressive for a film that really can't get much better!",5,The last film you ever need to see...,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,5061,"['Recently', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'hard', 'compile', 'Top', '100', 'Films', 'Time', 'list', 'completely', 'subjective', 'know', 'one', 'really', 'important', 'think', 'film', 'lover', 'have', 'favorite', 'films', 'reach', 'move', 'emotionally', 'complete', 'When', 'constructing', 'list', 'one', 'film', 'made', 'fairly', 'high', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'stunned', 'think', 'better', 'way', 'say', 'felt', 'emotionally', 'crippled', 'was', 'polarizing', 'film', 'spoke', 'ways', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'started', 'put', 'few', 'things', 'together', 'found', 'moved', 'tears', 'apposed', 'merely', 'frozen', 'emotional', 'shock', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'few', 'handfuls', 'times', 'have', 'grown', 'appreciate', 'more', 'more', 'perfected', 'cranny.There', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'films', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'utterly', 'perfect', 'not', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'perfectly', 'flawed', 'absolutely', 'PERFECT.', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'delicately', 'yet', 'extremely', 'precise', 'telling', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'eyes', 'group', 'lost', 'souls', 'center', 'group', 'young', 'Sonny', 'Crawford', 'everyone', 'Sonny', 'pulling', 'trying', 'absorb', 'order', 'sustain', 'own', 'survival', 'subtle', 'drain', 'likes', 'Sam', 'who', 'Sonny', 'son', 'Lois', 'Farrow', 'who', 'seeps', 'Sonny', 'daughter', 'significant', 'one', 'likes', 'Ruth', 'Popper', 'who', 'Sonny', 'escape', 'marriage', 'Jacy', 'Farrow', 'who', 'attention', 'so', 'much', ""'d"", 'use', 'Sonny', 'get', 'fact', 'Sonny', 'not', 'own', 'person', 'prop', 'used', 'convenience.One', 'friends', 'mentioned', 'one', 'grip', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'calculated', 'offer', 'perfect', 'combo', 'nostalgia', '+', 'criticism', 'time', 'think', 'have', 'counter', 'thought', 'calculation', 'nostalgia', 'criticism', 'can', 'truly', 'coexist', 'slight', 'calculation', 'times', 'admit', 'stronger', 'others', 'feel', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'rather', 'uneven', 'have', 'warm', 'feeling', 'home', 'mixed', 'cold', 'feeling', 'alienation', 'be', 'read', 'sincere', 'earnest', 'calculation', 'sharp', 'sense', 'detachment', 'actually', 'beautiful', 'sense', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'breathe', 'life', 'aspects', 'film.We', 'understand', 'desperate', 'desire', 'flee', 'claustrophobic', 'surroundings', 'trap', 'suffocate', 'also', 'see', 'feel', 'fear', 'leaving', 'such', 'place', 'individuals', 'know', 'believe', 'not', 'love.To', 'best', 'example', 'found', 'Lois', 'Farrow', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'scene', 'where', 'Sonny', 'Sam', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'scene', 'very', 'real', 'layers', 'grief', 'stripped', 'away', 'good', 'times', 'tears', 'smiles', 'such', 'natural', 'genuine', 'performance', 'best', 'show', 'clearly', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'up', 'soul', 'film', 'me.This', 'story', 'need', 'break', 'free', 'binds', 'yet', 'need', 'remember', 'kept', 'one', 'board', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'Aside', 'Burstyn', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'who', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'portrait', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'powerful', 'presence', 'whom', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'wonderfully', 'used', 'here', 'exhibiting', 'sorts', 'star-making', 'bravado', 'ever', 'once', 'appearing', 'be', 'actor', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'here', 'have', 'claimed', 'quiet', 'agony', 'lack', 'love', 'family', 'seen', 'many', 'scenes', 'joyous', 'expression', 'when', 'feel', 'love', 'just', 'outstanding', 'quiet', 'often', 'overlooked', 'performance', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'who', 'just', 'beautifully', 'honest', 'Genevieve', 'course', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'GOOD', 'even', 'Burstyn', 'was', 'better', 'complete', 'reclusion', 'sadness', 'emotionally', 'battering', 'way', 'dramatic', 'presence', 'astounding', 'comedic', 'firehouse.Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'center', 'film', 'sadly', 'more', 'canvas', 'substantial', 'force', 'beautifully', 'more', 'observer', 'thus', 'less', 'impression', 'supporting', 'cast', 'performance', 'reminiscent', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Curious', 'Case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'respect', 'fuller', 'more', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Pitt.In', 'end', 'have', 'urge', 'see', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'capture', 'so', 'much', 'such', 'ease', 'time', 'watch', 'masterpiece', 'am', 'brought', 'place', 'time', 'given', 'something', 'new', 'chew', 'more', 'see', 'better', 'impressive', 'film', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better']",N/A
19265,AG0TA24LI0XV7,0767827902,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[3, 3]","It's been forty years since this film debuted, and I have a strong feeling that there are still some towns like this one, small and fading and filled with sad, lonely, desperate souls. The town in this movie is changing, and we are privy to the ramifications. There's been so very much said and discussed about ""The Last Picture Show"", and it's understandable. It's a strong, confident piece of cinema with some great acting and writing and craftsmanship.There are some powerful moments in it, and even more importantly, there are a few quiet moments in it where characters speak volumes to each other without uttering one word. This is, more than anything, a character study, and you could argue that one of the characters is the town. Now, on the surface it seems that not much is going on here, but in reality there is a lot happening. It dawns on you as you get pulled in.A couple of standouts linger in the mind after viewing this film; Cloris Leachman is outstanding and understated for the most part in her role. Also, Ellen Burstyn shines as a woman who once knew love but all too briefly. Both actresses are excellent here. But this is definitely an ensemble piece, and newcomers to this film might be taken aback by all the familiar faces.Suffice to say that any film buff worth his or her salt should experience this wonderful tale of Americana in a state of flux.

19266,AR37967IAR6ZT,0767827902,Benjamin,"[13, 13]","Watching this for the first time a couple weeks ago, I was surprised first by how many known talents populate the cast. Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson, who won Oscars for their work here, act alongside Ellen Burstyn, Cybil Shepherd, Timothy Bottoms, Randy Quaid and Jeff Bridges in this coming-of-age tale also focusing on the dead-end lives and passions among the inhabitants of a nearly forgotten town.Anarene, Tex., is not the sort of place I'd want to visit, but the characters who live there are so well-drawn and human that they evoke my sympathy.Sonny, losing and regaining the respect of Sam the Lion, his wise idol and the owner of the town's theater, ambles into adulthood in the most difficult way. He's got a crush on Jacy, his best friend Duane's girl. He's having an affair with his coach's wife Ruth, a lonely woman who finds a roundabout, not-entirely-wise way of falling in love with him. In the process, Sonny becomes desperate, learning about sex, adulthood and life's occasionally less-rewarding aspects.While we watch Sonny, we also watch as Jacy learns from her mother and from the adults around her how to deal with her own sexual longings, despite her initial interest in an innocent, romantic love with Duane. What Jacy does about her sexuality and how it transforms her from a good girl to a mostly manipulative, powerful character is as startling as Sonny's transformation.The final scene, involving Sonny and Ruth, is astounding.

19267,AT54Q2ERA4PBR,0767827902,Ben J Korgen,"[4, 5]","Some will argue that ""The Last Picture Show"" is one of the best movies ever made.  Its story takes place primarily in the fictional dying town of Anarene, Texas.  The town is portrayed as dying physically, environmentally, economically, culturally and socially.  It has many open dirt areas not strongly held in place by the roots of robust plants.  It is in a flat, windy area where dust clouds of loose dirt whip through town, causing poorly fastened or broken main street doors to flap wildly.  For recreation, the locals can go to Anarene High School events, play pool, drink, or drive out to ""the tank,"" a lake surrounded by flat, desert-like land with a few clumps of brush.  It is filmed in black & white, emphasizing the pathetic dreariness of the land in and around Anarene.  I see ""The Last Show"" as a documentary-like film revealing how the disintegrating social structure of a town leads to the departure of the very wealthy and very smart and to the simultaneous victimizing of the super nice, friendly and caring but intellectually deficient.  The large cast is led by six world-class actors including Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Ben Johnson, Cybill Shepherd, Cloris Leachman and Ellen Burstyn.  The character named Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) is the nice guy who is unfairly hurt the most.  He seems to interact with most of the other actors in the movie.

It's an episodic picture, with many different things happening, but basically it revolves around a small group of high-schoolers and their love lives, from the viper girl (Cybill Shepherd), who is totally self-centered and will probably be the ruin of every man she comes near, to the 40-ish Cloris Leachman who suddenly comes alive sexually when Timothy Bottoms begins having an affair with her. The expert playing of the smaller roles (Ben Johnson, Ellen Burstyn, and Eileen Brennan in particular) is a great plus, as is the continual use of late-'40s country music (especially Hank Williams) in the background (the setting is early 1950s).

The film relates the happenings in Anarene,Texas from October 1951 to October 1952. America is changing. The cinema on the corner than had been the hub of life for the small town is giving way to the television age. Into this world comes the senior class of Anarene High School.School friends Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) yearn for more than the town has to offer. They also yearn for the prettiest girl in town Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepard). As their lives change we learn of the goings on of the citizens around them: there is Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson)owner of the cinema, the cafe and the pool hall; Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) the wife of the high school coach who wants more in her life; Lois Farrow (Ellen Burstyn) caught in a world in which she is alone with herself.The film is episodic but makes its points with ease. The ensemble cast was justly praised and the film was awarded with eight Academy Award nominations.

19275,A5SKEJ6QA31IP,0767827902,"C. N. Gallimore ""Reader of Great Books""","[50, 55]","For me there are two kinds of depressing movies, there are the kind that make you want to go out and kill yourself, and then there are the kind that just kind of numb you into beleiving that in your life you will never find meaning or fulfillment.  This film falls squarely in the latter category.  This film, along with Pekinpah's &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; and Leone's &quot;Once upon a time in the West&quot; make up the core cannon of the death of the west movies yet they view it from very different angles.  This film focus's on the death of the innocence of small town middle America as those few rugged individuals who had the courage to seek some sort of answer and fulfilment to their lives who were once thought to populate the west are dying off and leaving behind a dissalusioned populace without compassion, decency, and being slaves to their passions and not masters of their fates.Set in a small town in Texas and loosely following the odyssey of one young man (Sonny) and his interaction with his fellow man (and most importantly woman) over the course of one year in 1951.  Sonny isn't anything real special, just a mediocre high school football co-captain with a girlfriend he doesn't really like and who is about to graduate and likely work for the local oil drillers.  Some notable traits do immediately become apparent in Sonny however, namely his apparent compassion and comoradery for an outcast mentally retarded boy, and the shine which a strong likeable old cowboy type (Sam) has taken to him.  Sonny is at that terrifying stage in life where a person just begins to realize what an awful place the world really is and how awful most people in it really are.  We see his flounderings through his reach towards maturity by means of his affair with his coach's wife, his indiscretions with his best friends ex, and his contemplation on the words of the old timer Sam.There are other characters given almost as much screentime as Sam leading to multiple subplots, this movie follows the &quot;Winesberg Ohio&quot; model of painting smalltown life thorugh the rich tapestry of the individuals that compose it.Thematically this movie is all about the loss of innocence, of the west certainly, but also of man in general.  One of the most painful aspects of growing up is realizing that hardly anyone is truly what they seem.  The movie seems to look most favorably on the outlooks of those who least try to conceal what they are and simply deal with themselves and their fellowman honestly, and this is certainly not a bad view to take; to view yourself and the world around you as it really is without a lense.  And yet, the movie shows the barreness of such a view, ultimately leaving itself relatively unresolved.  The movie behaves exactly as it should, and as a result is a joy to watch.  Still, you do leave feeling as though you've just run a marathon through a murky swamp believing nothing and no one to be innocent.  This might be true, but even if no one is innocent (which seems likely) hopefully we won't fall into mere mediocrity and keep striving for some kind of innocence.A must see for any lovers of existentialist philosophy and lovers of beautifully depressing cinema.",5,"A Beautiful Movie, An Awful Reality",1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,3210,"['are', 'two', 'kinds', 'depressing', 'movies', 'are', 'kind', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'kill', 'then', 'are', 'kind', 'just', 'kind', 'numb', 'beleiving', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'meaning', 'fulfillment', 'film', 'squarely', 'latter', 'category', 'film', 'Pekinpah', 'quot', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'quot', 'Leone', 'quot', 'Once', 'time', 'West', 'quot', 'make', 'up', 'core', 'cannon', 'death', 'west', 'movies', 'yet', 'view', 'very', 'different', 'angles', 'film', 'focus', 'death', 'innocence', 'small', 'town', 'middle', 'America', 'few', 'rugged', 'individuals', 'who', 'had', 'courage', 'seek', 'sort', 'answer', 'fulfilment', 'lives', 'who', 'were', 'once', 'thought', 'populate', 'west', 'are', 'dying', 'off', 'leaving', 'dissalusioned', 'populace', 'compassion', 'decency', 'being', 'slaves', 'passions', 'not', 'masters', 'fates.Set', 'small', 'town', 'Texas', 'loosely', 'following', 'odyssey', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'Sonny', 'interaction', 'fellow', 'man', 'most', 'importantly', 'woman', 'course', 'one', 'year', '1951', 'Sonny', ""n't"", 'anything', 'real', 'special', 'just', 'mediocre', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'co-captain', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'who', 'graduate', 'likely', 'work', 'local', 'oil', 'drillers', 'notable', 'traits', 'do', 'immediately', 'become', 'apparent', 'Sonny', 'however', 'namely', 'apparent', 'compassion', 'comoradery', 'outcast', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'boy', 'shine', 'strong', 'likeable', 'old', 'cowboy', 'type', 'Sam', 'taken', 'Sonny', 'terrifying', 'stage', 'life', 'where', 'person', 'just', 'realize', 'what', 'awful', 'place', 'world', 'really', 'how', 'awful', 'most', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'see', 'flounderings', 'reach', 'towards', 'maturity', 'means', 'affair', 'coach', 'wife', 'indiscretions', 'best', 'friends', 'ex', 'contemplation', 'words', 'old', 'timer', 'Sam.There', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'given', 'almost', 'much', 'screentime', 'Sam', 'leading', 'multiple', 'subplots', 'movie', 'quot', 'Winesberg', 'Ohio', 'quot', 'model', 'painting', 'smalltown', 'life', 'rich', 'tapestry', 'individuals', 'compose', 'it.Thematically', 'movie', 'loss', 'innocence', 'west', 'certainly', 'also', 'man', 'general', 'One', 'most', 'painful', 'aspects', 'growing', 'up', 'realizing', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'truly', 'what', 'seem', 'movie', 'look', 'most', 'favorably', 'outlooks', 'who', 'least', 'try', 'conceal', 'what', 'are', 'simply', 'deal', 'fellowman', 'honestly', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'view', 'take', 'view', 'world', 'around', 'really', 'lense', 'yet', 'movie', 'barreness', 'such', 'view', 'ultimately', 'leaving', 'relatively', 'unresolved', 'movie', 'exactly', 'should', 'result', 'joy', 'watch', 'Still', 'do', 'leave', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'just', 'run', 'marathon', 'murky', 'swamp', 'believing', 'nothing', 'one', 'be', 'innocent', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'even', 'one', 'innocent', 'likely', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fall', 'mere', 'mediocrity', 'keep', 'striving', 'kind', 'innocence.A', 'must', 'see', 'lovers', 'existentialist', 'philosophy', 'lovers', 'beautifully', 'depressing', 'cinema']",N/A

19277,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,0767827902,Craig MACKINNON,"[9, 13]","To call a movie plotless sounds negative, but in the case of The Last Picture Show, there's so very little plot that it's barely worth speaking about.  The film revolves around a number of characters, most notably two high school seniors.  Duane is dating the ""only beautiful girl in town"" and Sonny is carrying on an affair with a married woman.  Several other characters move in and out of view, notably the beauty's mother and the owner of the pool hall.  The film carefully develops its dozen or so main characters and simply watches them as they move about the bleak-looking desert town.  Further adding to the immersion is the fact that the soundtrack consists solely of early-50's country music heard through tinny radios in the background.This film was quite controversial at the time of its release for its frank (and unglamorised) depictions of sex.  Jacy sums up the attitude of sex for the teens when she tells her mother ""I would never do that, it's a sin before marriage,"" but later tells a college boy ""I'm a virgin, but I don't want to be.""  In a small town with little to do, sex is just a form of entertainment, while 1951 morals required that it be hidden from view.This is a film that cares about its characters and allows them to inhabit the setting.  The dialogue and events occur naturally, and at the end of the film, the only things that have really happened are Jacy losing her virginity, a funeral, and the high school football team gets some better linebackers.  But because you care about the characters (and the performances are universally fantastic), you care about these events that are objectively small, but which are important to the characters.This DVD is not of high quality.  This may be deliberate - the film is supposed to have a hard-edged, bleak feel that might not be as effective if the film had been cleaned up for the DVD.  There is an hour-long reminiscence on the making of the film, which is interesting to watch once.  Director Bogdanovich gets the lion's share of time, but many cast members have their say as well.

19278,A2GYX971VETQBV,0767827902,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[7, 9]","Without a doubt, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is a remarkably beautiful film by any standard.  In fact, it is hard to know where to begin.  As far as the story is concerned, Director Peter Bogdanovich has done a superlative job of rendering the passion and emotion of Larry McMurty's novel onto the big screen.  During the film, the audience becomes immersed in the depressing, claustrophobic atmosphere of a small town in Texas during the early 1950s.  But this is no ""typical"" rendition of the conservative 1950s.  Instead, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW decides to handle the sexual politics of the 1950s with a tight-grip on reality, granting us a rather different discussion of sex during this time period than we are accustomed to receiving.  This is a town of broken-dreams, awkward love affairs, and convenient marriages.  It is a town where women are forced to marry in order to provide for themselves, only to end up in need of love and hating themselves.  It is a town of individuals watching life passing them by, wishing they could have lived, and refusing to start now.  Finally, it is a town that I think, like it or not, expresses a deep concern for many of us.Shooting the film in black & white was a great decision and helps transport THE LAST PICTURE SHOW into a different time (1951, to be exact).  There is no excess in this film.  The opening shot, of a dusty town in Texas, is beautifully captured without any gimics and the film holds true to form until the ending shot echoes the same bleak view of the town.  The acting is terrific and it is particularly fun to see the likes of Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd when they were extremely young.With its frank depictions of sex and the loss of innocence, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW manages to touch audiences on a very personal note.  Few films can communicate the claustrophobia of life, particularly of life in a small town, and this film succeeds marvelously.  While watching it, I kept thinking of WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, another fine film with a similar feel.  Both, in fact, include a young man living in a small town who gets involved with a married woman in a loveless affair.  Both boys take care of younger boys who are mentally handicapped and they are both tales of someone fighting a life that is passing by at an alarming rate.  You will be affected by this film, for better or for worse.  It is one of the best films I have seen in a long time and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",5,Emotional Rendition of 1950s America & Its Sexual Politics,1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,2459,"['doubt', 'LAST', 'PICTURE', 'SHOW', 'remarkably', 'beautiful', 'film', 'standard', 'fact', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'As', 'far', 'story', 'concerned', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'done', 'superlative', 'job', 'rendering', 'passion', 'emotion', 'Larry', 'McMurty', 'novel', 'big', 'screen', 'film', 'audience', 'immersed', 'depressing', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'small', 'town', 'Texas', 'early', '1950s', 'typical', 'rendition', 'conservative', '1950s', 'Instead', 'LAST', 'PICTURE', 'SHOW', 'handle', 'sexual', 'politics', '1950s', 'tight-grip', 'reality', 'granting', 'rather', 'different', 'discussion', 'sex', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'accustomed', 'receiving', 'town', 'broken-dreams', 'awkward', 'love', 'affairs', 'convenient', 'marriages', 'town', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'forced', 'marry', 'order', 'provide', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'need', 'love', 'hating', 'town', 'individuals', 'watching', 'life', 'passing', 'wishing', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'refusing', 'start', 'now', 'Finally', 'town', 'think', 'not', 'deep', 'concern', 'many', 'us.Shooting', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'was', 'great', 'decision', 'transport', 'LAST', 'PICTURE', 'SHOW', 'different', 'time', '1951', 'be', 'exact', 'excess', 'film', 'opening', 'shot', 'dusty', 'town', 'Texas', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'gimics', 'film', 'true', 'form', 'ending', 'shot', 'same', 'bleak', 'view', 'town', 'acting', 'terrific', 'particularly', 'fun', 'see', 'likes', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'when', 'were', 'extremely', 'young.With', 'frank', 'depictions', 'sex', 'loss', 'innocence', 'LAST', 'PICTURE', 'SHOW', 'touch', 'audiences', 'very', 'personal', 'note', 'Few', 'films', 'can', 'communicate', 'claustrophobia', 'life', 'particularly', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'film', 'marvelously', 'watching', 'kept', 'thinking', 'WHAT', 'EATING', 'GILBERT', 'GRAPE', 'fine', 'film', 'similar', 'feel', 'fact', 'include', 'young', 'man', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'who', 'involved', 'married', 'woman', 'loveless', 'affair', 'boys', 'take', 'care', 'younger', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'are', 'tales', 'someone', 'fighting', 'life', 'passing', 'alarming', 'rate', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'film', 'better', 'worse', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone']",N/A

Director Peter Bogdanovich imbues the film with deep texture but there is a context for this.  In other words, this is a film with great style and substance.  I don't know if the studios would bankroll such a film today.  It's not a film that can easily be described but once you experience it you'll be forever haunted by it.  Some would say the film is a litany of disparate vignettes but these episodes when taken as a whole cohere.  What is amazing is that there are many characters here but all are allowed to develope.  It would be fruitless to cite any over the other because it is a true ensemble effort.  What's interesting is that Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman won Oscars for their work here.

19280,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767827902,Dennis Littrell,"[7, 9]","In this nostalgic, atmospheric study of small town life in the fifties as seen a generation later, filmed on location in Wichita Falls and Archer City, Texas (from a novel by the incomparable Larry McMurtry), the force of slow, inevitable change is symbolized in the showing of the last picture at the local movie house. That last picture show, incidentally, is Howard Hawks' celebrated Western, Red River (1948) starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift.Well, the movie houses came back to life as multiplexes charging eight bucks a pop, but the Western movie died out, and the boys watching that movie went their separate ways into manhood.Peter Bogdanovich's direction is episodic and leisurely, naturalistic with just a hint of the maudlin. We get a sense of the North Texas prairie wind blowing through a cattle town where there is not a lot to do and a whole lot of time to do it. Hungry women and a sense of drift. Boredom, gray skies and a lot of dust. You could set &quot;Anarene, Texas&quot; down any place in southwestern or midwestern America, circa 1951, and you wouldn't have to change much: a main drag, a Texaco gas station, a caf&eacute;, a feed store, flat lands all around, old pickup trucks and a pool hall, youngsters with a restless yearning to grow up, drinking beer out of brown bottles giggling and elbowing each other in the ribs, and the old boys playing dominoes and telling tales of bygone days.Robert Surtees's stark, yet romantic black and white cinematography, captures well that bygone era. The wide shot of the bus pulling out, taking Duane off to the Korean War with Sonny watching, standing by the Texaco station with the missing letter in the sign, was a tableau in motion, a moment stopped in our minds.Cybill Shepherd made her debut here as Jacy Farrow, a bored little rich girl playing at love and sexuality. Part of the restorations in the video not shown in theaters in the early seventies includes some footage of her in the buff after stripping on a diving board (!). Jacy is as shallow as she is pretty, and one of the reasons for seeing this film, although in truth Shepherd's performance, while engaging, was a little uneven.The rest of the cast was outstanding, in particular Timothy Bottoms whose Sonny Crawford is warm and forgiving, sweet and innocent. Jeff Bridges's Duane Jackson is two-faced, wild and careless, self-centered and probably going to die in Korea. Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman deservedly won Oscars as best supporting actors. Leachman was especially good as the lonely 40-year-old wife of the football coach who has an awkward affair with the 18-year-old Sonny, while Johnson played a lovable, crusty guy that the kids looked up to. Sam Bottoms played the retarded Billy with steady, tragic good humor. Ellen Burstyn as Jacy's terminally bored mother, and Eileen Brennan as the wise waitress with a hand on her hip were also very good.Memorable, but perhaps too obviously insertional, are the country, pop, and rock and roll tunes from the late forties/early fifties jingling out of car radios and 45 record players throughout the film.Peter Bogdanovich followed this with some hits, including the comedy What's Up Doc (1972) with Barbra Streisand, Ryan O'Neal, and Madeline Kahn, and the excellent Paper Moon (1973) with Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, but then tailed off.

First, the source book by Larry McMurtry was fabulous by depicting a desolate form of small-town life that somehow made you want to experience it.  While McMurtry in later years wisely went the mini-series route for many of his stories, here they did a great job with the screenplay to leave the essence of the story in.While directory Bogdonovich would make his share of klunkers in later years, it was obvious in this one that a lot of care went into the movie.  Maybe he was given more time because he was a young director, but the time was well-spent.  Once again, he took very ordinary occurrances, and made them breathe.Finally, the casting was magnificent.

Sonny (Bottoms) and Duane (Bridges) are best friends without any real parents, only each other and some of the town folk.

Taylor ""GFT""","[4, 5]","Loosely based on gossip and scandal that surrounded various residents of Larry McMurtry's hometown of Archer City, Texas, the novel THE LAST PICTURE SHOW was much admired by critics--but didn't really explode into public conciousness until adapted to the screen, when it became one of the cinematic touchstones of the generation that had shed 1950s mores in favor of less restrictive attitudes.The film has no plot per se: it is simply a portrait of those who live in and around Anarene, Texas--a tiny town in the middle of nowhere that is slowly but surely dying.  It most particularly focuses on three high school students and their various travails.  Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) are best friends, play on the high school foot ball team, and both lust after the same girl--the very rich and extremely superficial Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd.)  Like most teenagers, they are all eager to climb into the back seat of car... but their hormones have unexpected consequences.The cast of characters spiral out from these three.  Through Sonny and Duane we meet Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), who owns the local cafe, pool hall, and picture show, and his sexy waitress and cook Genevieve (Eileen Brennan); through Jayce we meet her embittered and flamboyant mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn); and then there is the coach's wife, the painfully lonely and unhappy Ruth (Cloris Leachman.)  Although sex is a major catalyst in their various collisons, the real tragedy of their lives is the town, which is essentially a microsm of American hypocrisy, ennui, and failure.At the time, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW's frankess about sex was considered nothing short of scandalous; today it is merely so-so.  But the overall portrait of the characters as the struggle against the emptiness of their lives and their community remains as powerful as ever, and few films have delivered such a powerful ensemble cast.  The film essentially made the careers of everyone associated with it, brought Academy awards to Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman, and was nominated for virtually every award going.  It also put director Peter Bogdonavich on the map in a very major way.The DVD offers several bonuses, most particularly a ""making of"" piece in which Bogdonavich and such stars as Leachman, Brennan, and Burstyn recall the intensity of the shoot.  The transfer is very nice, beautifully preserving the memorable black and white cinematography by Robert Surtees and production design by Polly Platt.  Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,An American Classic,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,2527,"['Loosely', 'based', 'gossip', 'scandal', 'surrounded', 'various', 'residents', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'hometown', 'Archer', 'City', 'Texas', 'novel', 'THE', 'LAST', 'PICTURE', 'SHOW', 'was', 'much', 'admired', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'explode', 'public', 'conciousness', 'adapted', 'screen', 'when', 'became', 'one', 'cinematic', 'touchstones', 'generation', 'had', 'shed', '1950s', 'mores', 'favor', 'less', 'restrictive', 'attitudes.The', 'film', 'plot', 'se', 'simply', 'portrait', 'who', 'live', 'Anarene', 'Texas', 'tiny', 'town', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'slowly', 'surely', 'dying', 'most', 'particularly', 'focuses', 'three', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'various', 'travails', 'Sonny', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'Duane', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'play', 'high', 'school', 'foot', 'ball', 'team', 'lust', 'same', 'girl', 'very', 'rich', 'extremely', 'superficial', 'Jacy', 'Farrow', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'most', 'teenagers', 'are', 'eager', 'climb', 'back', 'seat', 'car', 'hormones', 'have', 'unexpected', 'consequences.The', 'cast', 'characters', 'spiral', 'out', 'three', 'Sonny', 'Duane', 'meet', 'Sam', 'Lion', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'who', 'local', 'cafe', 'pool', 'hall', 'picture', 'show', 'sexy', 'waitress', 'cook', 'Genevieve', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'Jayce', 'meet', 'embittered', 'flamboyant', 'mother', 'Lois', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'then', 'coach', 'wife', 'painfully', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'Ruth', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'sex', 'major', 'catalyst', 'various', 'collisons', 'real', 'tragedy', 'lives', 'town', 'essentially', 'microsm', 'American', 'hypocrisy', 'ennui', 'failure.At', 'time', 'LAST', 'PICTURE', 'SHOW', 'frankess', 'sex', 'was', 'considered', 'nothing', 'short', 'scandalous', 'today', 'merely', 'so-so', 'overall', 'portrait', 'characters', 'struggle', 'emptiness', 'lives', 'community', 'as', 'powerful', 'ever', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'delivered', 'powerful', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'film', 'essentially', 'made', 'careers', 'everyone', 'associated', 'brought', 'Academy', 'awards', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'was', 'nominated', 'virtually', 'award', 'going', 'also', 'put', 'director', 'Peter', 'Bogdonavich', 'map', 'very', 'major', 'way.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'bonuses', 'most', 'particularly', 'making', 'piece', 'Bogdonavich', 'such', 'stars', 'Leachman', 'Brennan', 'Burstyn', 'recall', 'intensity', 'shoot', 'transfer', 'very', 'nice', 'beautifully', 'preserving', 'memorable', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'Robert', 'Surtees', 'production', 'design', 'Polly', 'Platt', 'Strongly', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

What hits you first in this film? For me it was the images. There are black-and-white images of rural Texas, rundown buildings and cars. We are definitely in a Western setting but also it is definitely contemporary for the decade of the 1950s. One way of life is dying and perhaps transitioning into a new one. The visual imagery is vividly captured by cinematographer Robert Surtees's always intuitive and brilliant work. One way of life, that of living a moral lifestyle through hard or mundane work, gives way to cynical, lethargic, indifferent and bleak modernism. The film focuses on the two friends, Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges, as they transition from boyhood into manhood. There is Ben Johnson who plays Sam the Lion, who owns the diner, the pool hall, and the Royal theater. These are the only attractions in the dying town of Anarene. Ben Johnson's Sam the Lion is all that is left of a younger man's dreams and aspirations as he looks back and reminisces with Timothy Bottoms at an isolated pond somewhere outside of town on the prairie offering him a hand rolled cigarette. There is a lot of time in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. That seems that is all that remains in that dying town and there is enough time to remember and think of what once was and what will become of that existence.

19292,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,0767827902,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[5, 6]","Directed by Peter Bogdanovich this is a true piece of Americana and what filmmaking is about. ""The Last Picture Show"" is truly a classic.It stars Cybill Shepherd, Ben Johnson, Jeff Bridges and Cloris Leachmen. All of them would have tv and movie careers some more successful than others. Bridges plays Dwayne a country boy/ football player in a small country town. His best friend is Sonny, played by Timothy Bottoms, who is also a country boy/ football player.  They're not really good football players (like the NFL players) and they get told that they're not good by their peers and friends in their small town.Sonny's girlfriend Charlene resembles the easy, yet hard to figure out Anglo Saxon girl. He eventually breaks up with her to be with anolder woman.  This older woman is actually the wife of his coach, but since his coach hardly gives her the time of day, she seeks a good younger man who can satisfy her.Cybill Shephered playes Dwayne's girlfriend, J.C., a rich, insecure and often shallow white girl. She at first comes on as sweet as innocent, but that sweetness rapidly disappears when she goes to a nude swimming party with Lester a loser of a man played by Randy Quaid.J.C. is just like her mom, bitchy in tone, gets mixed up with men that don't love them,and then complain later on why they're lives are messed up. This is a classic movie, in showing people in a small town sometimes  act. However, most of the characters especially Sonny show heart and soul, along with Dwayne as they grow threw the tough times growing up, that would shape them up to be strong respectable men.Dwayne joins the army to fight in Korea, and Sonny overcoming many obstacles begins to change for the better.This movie is the classic coming of age story but really resembles so much more too, the 1950-1960's were a turning point in how Americans see themselves.

19300,A20JSDQSIOH7DQ,0767827902,J Eric Miller,"[0, 2]","What excites one about Texasville is that it has been made by essentially the same team as made The Last Picture Show. The surprise then is that almost nobody seems to be aware of the previous film, though, in the case of the performers, they were in it, and though, and most damning, in the case of the director, he made it.  Perhaps there is no way to follow up or catch up with these characters.  MacMurtry has a better and more honest chance at it because it is only on the page. The first thing one notes is that Texasville is not shot in black and white as The Last Picture Show was. To do so would be a mistake; color was ""too pretty"" for the original, but these sequel needs to be pretty. Less glum, less oppressed, but therefore less than... The hyper realism of The Last Picture Show is replaced by a not completely light hearted series of set pieces.  We're looking at a comedy-romance this second time around.  And on its own terms, it might be all right.  The problem is the two movies do not present the same the world, not even a world where twenty years have passed.  Texasville is full of contrivances, from Junior roping the oil well to the kids starting an egg war. There was no such contrivance in The Last Picture Show.  Though both films have wonderful performers, Texasville is marred by its children performers, especially the twins, who are acting cute for the camera, and Jimmy Howell, who plays Duane's son, is fairly awful and impossible to believe as someone that the girls just fall all over (""one in a million"").  His heroics contrast sharply with the realistic vision offered by The Last Picture Show in which none of the boys were really heroes; they didn't win football games; they didn't really get all the girls; they were bumbling around.  Only one of them still bumbles and only his story suggests the heavy sadness that hangs over the original, and that is Sonny.  It's worth noting that Cybil Shepard has not aged well; she looks good, but not when you remember her from The Last Picture Show and Taxi Driver, when she was terribly beautiful.",5,The Last Picture Show vs Texasville,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,2082,"['What', 'one', 'Texasville', 'been', 'made', 'essentially', 'same', 'team', 'made', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'surprise', 'then', 'almost', 'nobody', 'be', 'aware', 'previous', 'film', 'though', 'case', 'performers', 'were', 'most', 'damning', 'case', 'director', 'made', 'Perhaps', 'way', 'follow', 'up', 'catch', 'up', 'characters', 'MacMurtry', 'better', 'more', 'honest', 'chance', 'only', 'page', 'first', 'thing', 'one', 'Texasville', 'not', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'was', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'color', 'was', 'too', 'pretty', 'original', 'sequel', 'be', 'pretty', 'Less', 'glum', 'less', 'oppressed', 'therefore', 'less', 'hyper', 'realism', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'replaced', 'not', 'completely', 'light', 'hearted', 'series', 'set', 'pieces', ""'re"", 'looking', 'comedy-romance', 'second', 'time', 'own', 'terms', 'might', 'be', 'right', 'problem', 'two', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'present', 'same', 'world', 'not', 'even', 'world', 'where', 'twenty', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Texasville', 'full', 'contrivances', 'Junior', 'roping', 'oil', 'well', 'kids', 'starting', 'egg', 'war', 'was', 'such', 'contrivance', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'films', 'have', 'wonderful', 'performers', 'Texasville', 'marred', 'children', 'performers', 'especially', 'twins', 'who', 'are', 'acting', 'cute', 'camera', 'Jimmy', 'Howell', 'who', 'Duane', 'son', 'fairly', 'awful', 'impossible', 'believe', 'someone', 'girls', 'just', 'fall', 'one', 'million', 'heroics', 'contrast', 'sharply', 'realistic', 'vision', 'offered', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'none', 'boys', 'were', 'really', 'heroes', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'football', 'games', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'girls', 'were', 'bumbling', 'around', 'Only', 'one', 'still', 'only', 'story', 'heavy', 'sadness', 'original', 'Sonny', 'worth', 'noting', 'Cybil', 'Shepard', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'good', 'not', 'when', 'remember', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'when', 'was', 'terribly', 'beautiful']",N/A
19301,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,0767827902,Jessica Lux,"[3, 4]","The Last Picture Show is a film adaptation by Peter Bogdanovich of Larry McMurtry's novel of the same name.  The two-hour film follows Texas high school seniors as they graduate and move on to military service, college, or get stuck in the soon-to-be ghost town of Anarene.  Anarene is an actual ghost town in Texas, but the movie was filmed 8 miles to the north, in McMurtry's hometown of Archer City, which was fictionalized as Thalia in his 1966 novel.  The setting is evocative of many American small towns in the dust bowl during the Korean War.  In fact, Bogdanovich chose the name Anarene for his film version to pay homage to Howard Hawks' 1948 Red River, set in Abilene, Kansas.You can taste the dust and desolation as you view The Last Picture Show.  Two high school seniors (Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms) lust after the teenage temptress (Cybill Shepherd) and get advice from the old-time owner of the town's movie theater.  The young generation of Anarene residents is confused about their future and jockeying for position in the social strata, while the older generation feels the desperation of life in a dying one-horse town.  Reportedly, Orson Wells recommended that the movie be shot in black & white, and I can't imagine it any other way.  As a younger viewer, I was surprised by the amount of full-frontal nudity and sexual scenarios in a film nominated for eight Academy Awards.

19302,A18OBUSMXVE8R0,0767827902,J. Guild,"[2, 2]","It's many years ago that I read McMurtry's ""The Last Picture Show"" and it was one of the reasons that he became ,and still remains, one of my favorite authors. When I came across this video,I thought it might be a quick review of the book for me. Well,was I ever pleasantly surprised.I can't remember too many of the details of the book and I had not seen the movie.Let me tell you right here ; the video is a classic and is able to do so much more than the book.I often find that I prefer ""the movie to the book"" and for these reasons: First, the sound track,then the sets and scenery,and then, the actors;particularly when they are your favorites. On top of that,you can sit back,soak it all up;and all in a couple of hours.I graduated from High School in 1954. I lived in a small town in Nova Scotia of about 5,000,and it was just 9 years after the end of WWII.That is important since it was an Army base town,and nearby Air Force bases as well as Navy bases in Halifax.Although the town had never suffered as much as many during the Depression,it was going through great changes.We had 2 Movie Theatres,each showing a Matinee and 2 Evening shows.You could see 6 movies a week and then there was the Drive In;or more commonly called the ""Passion Pit"".They've all been closed. You also gotta remember there was no TV then, and certainly no way you could watch  home movies. Movies were very cheap in those days,around 35 cents,hence very popular.Then there was the Pool Hall,better known as the ""Academy"". This was the focal point of the teenage boys and even some of the other guys about town .However,once grown into manhood and settled down;pool halls became a thing that got replaced by family,Golf club,or more ""respectable"" endeavors. You would never find a businessman,Doctor,or any other ""upstanding member of the community"" in the Pool Hall,but they had all frequented them in their youth.The Pool Hall , the Arena or the Diner was the first place you headed for when you wanted to find out ""What's going on"". Little wonder I relate so to this story. Like,I said; our town hadn't fallen on such hard times as Thalia,we were more akin to Peyton Place.Music was much more to us in those days and unbelievably,much of it is still being played.I was a big fan of Country and Popular.Here is where the video really shines.It is loaded with our favorite music in the background. Ours was the time of music on the radio,top tens,Jukeboxes,car radios at the Drive-In Restaurants,record players and of course High School Dances.That has all been replaced by TV,Walkmans with earphones and now I-Pods and mostly Rock.There is an amazing array of familiar singers on the video;Eddie Arnold,Phil Harris,Hank Snow,Tony Bennett,Lefty Frizzell,Frankie Laine,Johnnie Rae,Kay Starr,Hank Thompason,Webb Pierce,Jo Stafford and more.However,the one that really haunts the whole video is Hank Williams.I can still remember when he flooded the airways with his songs. It was a stroke of pure genius to choose his ""Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To Do?"" to end the video.If there ever was a case where the video outshines the book;this one gets my vote.Oh yes; my title. It was one of Hank's big songs,and pretty well describes this book and video.",5,"""A  Picture From  Life's Other Side""",1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,3241,"['many', 'years', 'read', 'McMurtry', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'became', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'When', 'came', 'video', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'quick', 'review', 'book', 'Well', 'was', 'ever', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'book', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'movie.Let', 'tell', 'right', 'here', 'video', 'classic', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'book.I', 'often', 'find', 'prefer', 'movie', 'book', 'reasons', 'First', 'sound', 'track', 'then', 'sets', 'scenery', 'then', 'actors', 'particularly', 'when', 'are', 'favorites', 'top', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'soak', 'up', 'couple', 'hours.I', 'graduated', 'High', 'School', '1954', 'lived', 'small', 'town', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'about', '5,000', 'was', 'just', '9', 'years', 'end', 'WWII.That', 'important', 'was', 'Army', 'base', 'town', 'nearby', 'Air', 'Force', 'as', 'well', 'Navy', 'bases', 'Halifax.Although', 'town', 'had', 'never', 'suffered', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'Depression', 'was', 'going', 'great', 'changes.We', 'had', '2', 'Movie', 'Theatres', 'showing', 'Matinee', '2', 'Evening', 'shows.You', 'could', 'see', '6', 'movies', 'week', 'then', 'was', 'Drive', 'more', 'commonly', 'called', 'Passion', 'Pit', '.They', ""'ve"", 'been', 'closed', 'also', 'got', 'ta', 'remember', 'was', 'TV', 'then', 'certainly', 'way', 'could', 'watch', 'home', 'movies', 'Movies', 'were', 'very', 'cheap', 'days', 'around', '35', 'cents', 'hence', 'very', 'popular.Then', 'was', 'Pool', 'Hall', 'better', 'known', 'Academy', 'was', 'focal', 'point', 'teenage', 'boys', 'even', 'other', 'guys', 'town', '.However', 'once', 'grown', 'manhood', 'settled', 'down', 'pool', 'halls', 'became', 'thing', 'got', 'replaced', 'family', 'Golf', 'club', 'more', 'respectable', 'endeavors', 'would', 'never', 'find', 'businessman', 'Doctor', 'other', 'upstanding', 'member', 'community', 'Pool', 'Hall', 'had', 'frequented', 'youth.The', 'Pool', 'Hall', 'Arena', 'Diner', 'was', 'first', 'place', 'headed', 'when', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'What', 'going', 'Little', 'wonder', 'relate', 'so', 'story', 'said', 'town', 'had', ""n't"", 'fallen', 'such', 'hard', 'times', 'Thalia', 'were', 'more', 'akin', 'Peyton', 'Place.Music', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'days', 'unbelievably', 'much', 'still', 'being', 'played.I', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'Country', 'Popular.Here', 'where', 'video', 'really', 'shines.It', 'loaded', 'favorite', 'music', 'background', 'Ours', 'was', 'time', 'music', 'radio', 'top', 'tens', 'Jukeboxes', 'car', 'radios', 'Drive-In', 'Restaurants', 'record', 'players', 'course', 'High', 'School', 'Dances.That', 'been', 'replaced', 'TV', 'earphones', 'now', 'I-Pods', 'mostly', 'Rock.There', 'amazing', 'array', 'familiar', 'singers', 'video', 'Eddie', 'Arnold', 'Phil', 'Harris', 'Hank', 'Snow', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'Lefty', 'Frizzell', 'Frankie', 'Laine', 'Johnnie', 'Rae', 'Kay', 'Starr', 'Hank', 'Thompason', 'Webb', 'Pierce', 'Jo', 'Stafford', 'more.However', 'one', 'really', 'whole', 'video', 'Hank', 'Williams.I', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'when', 'flooded', 'airways', 'songs', 'was', 'stroke', 'pure', 'genius', 'choose', 'Why', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Love', 'Me', 'Used', 'Do', 'end', 'video.If', 'there', 'ever', 'was', 'case', 'where', 'video', 'book', 'one', 'vote.Oh', 'yes', 'title', 'was', 'one', 'Hank', 'big', 'songs', 'pretty', 'well', 'describes', 'book', 'video']",N/A

The movie takes place in a small, desolate Texas town where the only thing to do is go to school, play sports, and see a movie. No one knows this better than Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and his friends. Sonny is a typical high school senior. He hangs out with his friends, usually Duane (Jeff Bridges), chills with his girlfriend, and worries about his future. Especially since almost no one in the town has much of a future. Bogdanovich hammers this message down, mostly with the black & white cinematography. Despite having a crush on Duane's slutty girlfriend Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), Sonny begins having an affair with his football coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman, who deservedly won an Oscar her role). Probably the most memorable character in the film is Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson, who also won an Oscar for his role) the man who owns the movie theatre, the diner, and pool hall frequented by almost everyone in the town. Sam also, for the most part, acts as the moral conscience of the town. The character is given some of the best dialogue. The performances in this film are all so good. You can not imagine one other person playing the roles in the film. One thing I kept noticing while watching the film is how hot Cybill Shepherd was back in the day. ""The Last Picture Show"" is a masterpiece of cinema that deserves a lot more props for how good it is. It's regarded as a classic, but isn't a solidified one. The movie does everything so well to illustrate its story and the desperation of all the characters to get away. From the black & white atmosphere to the dull-ness of everything. Not a single scene in the film seems forced or un-needed (although it could be argued the film has gratuitous nudity, but who cares?). If you haven't seen ""The Last Picture Show"" you should, because it's a great film and it's very memorable, you won't regret watching it.GRADE: A",5,One of the Best Movies  of All Time,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,2451,"['When', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'hailed', 'one', 'best', 'debut', 'films', 'American', 'director', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Odd', 'Citizen', 'Kane', '1', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'Top', '100', 'list', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', '400', 'nominees', '10th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'list', 'maybe', 'will', 'make', 'time', 'certainly', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Mountain', 'written', 'McMurtry', 'director', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'movie', 'place', 'small', 'desolate', 'Texas', 'town', 'where', 'only', 'thing', 'do', 'go', 'school', 'play', 'sports', 'see', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'Sonny', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'friends', 'Sonny', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'out', 'friends', 'usually', 'Duane', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'girlfriend', 'worries', 'future', 'Especially', 'almost', 'one', 'town', 'much', 'future', 'Bogdanovich', 'message', 'down', 'mostly', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'having', 'crush', 'Duane', 'slutty', 'girlfriend', 'Jacy', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'Sonny', 'having', 'affair', 'football', 'coach', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'who', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Probably', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'film', 'Sam', 'Lion', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'who', 'also', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'movie', 'theatre', 'diner', 'pool', 'hall', 'frequented', 'almost', 'everyone', 'town', 'Sam', 'also', 'most', 'part', 'moral', 'conscience', 'town', 'character', 'given', 'best', 'dialogue', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'playing', 'roles', 'film', 'One', 'thing', 'kept', 'noticing', 'watching', 'film', 'how', 'hot', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'was', 'back', 'day', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'masterpiece', 'cinema', 'lot', 'more', 'props', 'how', 'good', 'regarded', 'classic', ""n't"", 'solidified', 'one', 'movie', 'everything', 'so', 'well', 'illustrate', 'story', 'desperation', 'characters', 'get', 'away', 'black', 'white', 'atmosphere', 'dull-ness', 'everything', 'Not', 'single', 'scene', 'film', 'forced', 'un-needed', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'film', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'should', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'memorable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'it.GRADE']",N/A

Depicting a time in small-town Texas (the 1950s), this movie leads us through a few months in the lives of several characters in coming-of-age moments.  A frank, bittersweet drama of social and sexual mores that are shifting, it is also most notable for the talent-laden cast of characters:  Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, Timothy Bottoms, Cloris Leachman, and Ben Johnson, to name a few.Filmed in black and white, the movie is set against a dreary tumbleweed-cast backdrop, with an almost ghost-town appearance.  It called to mind for me where I was when it was released.  I had just moved to what could almost be a twin of the dreary town of Anarene, Texas.  The counterpart was a small former oil town to the west of the Central Valley city where I now live.  The desolation in the film mirrored the emotions I felt when ""dropped into"" this town; I was young, with three small children, and cast rudderless onto what felt like a barren landscape.  Uprooted from the urban life I loved (in Northern California), I could completely identify with the feelings of desolation experienced by the characters.As I watched the film today, those same emotions swept over me, and I almost felt as though I were back there.Directed by Peter Bogdanovich, the movie can best be described as a timeless coming-of-age tale that spotlights a season in the lives of a disenchanted group of young people.Five stars.",5,A BITTERSWEET DRAMA SET IN A DESOLATE LANDSCAPE....,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,1667,"['WatchingThe', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Definitive', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Special', 'Edition', 'again', 'years', 'felt', 'almost', 'reexperiencing', 'times', 'life.It', 'was', 'released', '1971', 'beginning', 'decade', 'charged', 'revolutionary', 'emotions', 'challenges', 'Depicting', 'time', 'small-town', 'Texas', '1950s', 'movie', 'few', 'months', 'lives', 'several', 'characters', 'coming-of-age', 'moments', 'frank', 'bittersweet', 'drama', 'social', 'sexual', 'mores', 'are', 'shifting', 'also', 'most', 'notable', 'talent-laden', 'cast', 'characters', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'name', 'few.Filmed', 'black', 'white', 'movie', 'set', 'dreary', 'tumbleweed-cast', 'backdrop', 'almost', 'ghost-town', 'appearance', 'called', 'mind', 'where', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'had', 'just', 'moved', 'what', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'twin', 'dreary', 'town', 'Anarene', 'Texas', 'counterpart', 'was', 'small', 'former', 'oil', 'town', 'west', 'Central', 'Valley', 'city', 'where', 'now', 'live', 'desolation', 'film', 'mirrored', 'emotions', 'felt', 'when', 'dropped', 'town', 'was', 'young', 'three', 'small', 'children', 'cast', 'rudderless', 'what', 'felt', 'barren', 'landscape', 'Uprooted', 'urban', 'life', 'loved', 'Northern', 'California', 'could', 'completely', 'identify', 'feelings', 'desolation', 'experienced', 'characters.As', 'watched', 'film', 'today', 'same', 'emotions', 'swept', 'almost', 'felt', 'were', 'back', 'there.Directed', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'movie', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'timeless', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'season', 'lives', 'disenchanted', 'group', 'young', 'people.Five', 'stars']",N/A

19317,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,0767827902,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[2, 2]","The Last Picture Show was left off the first AFI top 100 listing, but it made it onto the 10th anniversary revision, at spot #95. I have to wonder if a reason it didn't make it onto the first list, and barely clung onto a spot in the second, was the near-porn levels of sexuality, which many viewers are uncomfortable with. There are many long shots of multiple women with full frontal nudity, several sex scenes, and much of the rest of the movie's focus is on sexual affairs and situations. I think it's an area that reviewers often find a bit difficult. Intriguingly, we have many movies in the AFI top 100 which are absolutely full of violence and gore. So apparently for some in our world it's OK to portray pain and hurt, but not physical intimacy.The Last Picture Show is a stellar, stand-out movie in a myriad of ways. First, even though this was 1971, it was shot in black and white. That gives its story set in 1951 even more of a ""faded"" look, a sense of the colorlessness of the world the characters live in. Their small town in Texas is nearly falling apart around them. They've got a run down pool hall, a cafe with faded walls, and dingy movie house. The high school kids are routinely dismissed by the adults as worthless and going nowhere - which is at its heart a commentary on how the adults feel about their own desolate lives in a place where tumbleweeds literally roll down the dusty streets.The only way to add any interest into their lives is to have sex. Wives have affairs with whatever men they find around. The high school kids have sex with their boyfriends / girlfriends, chase after strangers, fall into affairs with married people, and the cycle keeps going. The adults aren't surprised or shocked at what the kids are doing. If anything they're cynical - it's exactly what they did, and it didn't help life any. They're still stuck in this dying town, feeling despair. One character says he figures that 80% of married couples are miserable. In this town, it seems more like 100%.With so many movies on the AFI top 100 barely having speaking parts for women, The Last Picture Show stands out as having a number of powerful, complicated female characters. Yes, one could say they're all over-sexed, but so are all the male characters here. It's simply a symptom of the town's malaise. Many of the most poignant scenes are between the run-down mother who feels the angst of all she's lost, and her daughter who is feeling trapped in the small town. The mom is trying to prevent the daughter from making the same mistakes she did. The daughter, as many teen girls tend to do, is rebelling against her advice simply ""because"".The actors here are amazing. They can tell volumes with the turn of a head or the glimmer of interest in their eyes. This isn't a movie about wild, flamboyant characters. It's about characters who have been weathered and beaten down, but who still try to find that spark of life to go on with.I think it's fair to say that a watcher has to be comfortable with the idea of sexuality to draw in the full power of the movie. There are scenes of a back-seat prostitute yelling at a metally challenged boy who his friends have tossed in with her. There's a scene of a cheating wife crying while her teenaged lover climbs into bed with her. There's the preacher's boy who contemplates molesting a young girl.

19322,AESY8NCX6VS6O,0767827902,M. Burns,"[152, 159]","There are a handful of movies in history that can be summed up by the look in a character's eyes (Renee Falconetti's horrified stare in The Passion of Joan of Arc, Al Pacino's steely gaze in The Godfather Part II), and within five minutes of Peter Bogdonavich's controversial 1971...yes...masterpiece, I knew I'd have another one to add to the list. The Last Picture Show is wickedly funny, raunchy, and razor-sharp precise in capturing that post-Senior-year-summer state of mind, but the heartbreaking, jaded look on Timothy Bottoms' face hit me like a ton of bricks, and I'm still somewhat recovering from it.Show takes place between World War II and the Korean Conflict in the sleepy, dying town of Anarene, Texas. Robert Surtees' camera wisely captures the desolated-yet-beautiful aura of the place in an opening shot that glides down a dusty street, past the movie theater, and into the complex lives of a bunch of horny high school students, nosy townspeople, and Anarene's one pillar of nobility, Sam the Lion. It's really difficult to even believe that Show wasn't made in the 1950's, when the film takes place. The stark, black-and-white cinematography is far-removed from Willis' lush images in Manhattan, but it's not quite low-budget gritty, either. It's mostly owed to shooting on location in the town that inspired Larry McMurtry's source novel, but the authenticity of a now-notable cast's performances elevates this to a class all by itself.Do Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Randy Quaid ring a bell at all? In 1971, all were virtual unknowns, and - sadly enough - the giver of the greatest performance in the film, Timothy Bottoms as Sonny, remained virtually so. McMurtry and Bogdonavich's script takes these horny teens and jaded adults and creates a lurid entanglement of sexual liasons, secrets, and naked pool parties that would have Jerry Springer shaking his head. And this would all be patently ridiculous if it weren't for the fact that each and every character has a complexity that makes their actions completely plausible.And that's the brilliant thing about Bogdonavich's film. He isn't exploiting the closed-door actions and flippant erotic gestures of these messed-up denizens of a rapidly dying town; he understands that everything they do, everything we did at that age, was all a result of the confusion, denial, and pure terror at the life that lies ahead for us all. There's a reason that the movie focuses on the adults in the town, as well: Jacy's mom, coach Popper's wife, Sam the Lion - these people used to be Sonny, Duane, and Jacy at one time, and their hopes and dreams were put on hold just to live comfortably and safely in Anarene.Timothy Bottoms' Sonny is the guiding force of Picture Show; the character there from the first frame and at the cusp of true reality in its last. Sure, he has his share of American Pie-esque moments (an affair with his coach's wife rings a bell), but it's the bulk of the emotion of the film that falls on him. A deeply sad moment, in particular, lingered with me: a person in the town has just died, and he's riding along in a car, gazing out the window, looking at a distant Texas lake that means more to him than he knows. His eyes seem to take it all in until it's too much, and a tear falls from each cheek without the others even knowing.A line that completely bowled me over is said to Sonny, as well, and it's proof of the screenplay's perfect hold on the language that we use. Who knows how to put a life-changing experience into the right words? Burstyn's Lois doesn't, and so we get this haunting gem of a line: ""I guess if it wasn't for Sam, I'd have missed it, whatever it is.""The adult residents of Anarene did miss it, whatever it was. But this film holds on to a group of people we learn to love, struggle with hating, and eventually don't want to leave, all because we don't want to see them miss whatever it is. The Last Picture Show is one of the most deeply haunting, brutally funny, and real moviewatching experiences I've ever had. I'm glad I didn't miss it, whatever it is.

19324,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,0767827902,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","According to director Peter Bogdanovich, he made this movie on location in Archer City, Texas in 2 months and spent another 6 months editing.  By his own admission, he didn't know many of the technical aspects of filmmaking so reworking the prints was necessary.  In the end, he got it all right.  Shot in glorious black and white in order to promote the grim, bleak decay of a small Texas town, the film also gives us a complex set of characters.  With the exception of Best Supporting Actor winner Ben Johnson, the cast was mostly unknown actors at the time.  This is model Cybill Shepherd's first role.  Bogdanovich shot the film using traditional camera techniques.  In addition to an established color pallet, most films of the era were being produced by directors experimenting with hand held cameras, quick cuts and special effects.  ""Picture Show"" exhibits like the era it portrays, 1951-1952 dusty Texas.  Bogdanovich doesn't use a musical score.  Instead he uses the music of the day with an emphasis on Hank Williams.  In fact a couple shots feature an old 45 rpm changer and of course a jukebox.  By my count there are 8 or 9 central characters and Bogdanovich manages to flesh out each one so we know who they are and what they represent.  For the most part the central focus is on Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) a graduating high school senior who comes to realize, life isn't getting any better, but seemingly has no options.  The film was controversial at the time.  It showed a change in American demographics as people were leaving the small towns that dotted the country for bigger cities that had more opportunities.  ""The Last Picture Show"" is replete with nudity, adultery and sex.  While this was not unheard of at the time, the context of it being in the lives of regular small town citizens was.  The screenplay was adapted from Larry McMurtry's book of the same name.  He grew up in Archer City, so I suspect all the events really happened, even if the characters may have differed.

But don't stress about that, it's really nothing bad at all, especially for today's standards(nothing close to Monster's Ball), remember The Graduate caused an explosion too in 1967.Adapted from the Novel by Larry McMurty(Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment)and directed to PERFECTION by Peter Bogdanovich, the takes place in fall 1951-fall 1952 in the dying, small town of Anarene, Texas.  It includes some of the best characters in a film ever, and the acting by all is simply EXQUISITE.  The film mainly follows two best friends, Sonny(Timothy Bottoms) and Duane(Jeff Bridges-in a supporting actor academy award nominated role),in their senior year in high school.  Both are begining to get to a time of change and crossroads in their lives.  Duane's girlfriend Jacy(Cybill Shepherd-in her wonderful film debut) is the girl who both boys have their eyes on.  While Jacy is taken, Sonny starts an affair with the coach's wife(Cloris Leachman-Best Supporting Actress Academy Award), this gets the story rolling.  The three women in this film are simply magnificent.  Ellen Burstyn was, in a word, wonderful & she was my favorite character, and garnered a Supporting Actress Nomination(she won Best Actress in 1974). Cloris Leachman beat her out for the Oscar that year.  Her character changes so much from being meek and quite, to being filled with joy, to being full of anger & in the final moment's of the movie she shows why she has that Oscar.  Eileen Brennam is superb as Genevieve the waitress, she serves as a mother-figure for Sonny, and is tough-talking but sincere.  One of the Most Memorable roles in the Film is that of Sam the Lion(Ben Johnson),the all-knowing wise man, who owns the picture show.  THe scene by the Lake is Classic.  THis role won him the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award.The film is shot in black-and-white, which adds to the feeling of depression and gives the lonely dying feeling that the town evokes.  The music is true to the time, and is also part of the movie.  It only comes from a radio or record player, no background music.People with ""country"" roots will especially like this one as will those who like to study films, this one is one of the most importants of all time.  It was also nominated for Best Picture, director, and Adapted-screen play too(8 nominations in all).Check it out, it's important and entertaining.",5,The Show  Isn't Over Yet,1065052800,"10 2, 2003",2003,2559,"['Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'When', 'first', 'premired', '1971', 'garnered', 'praise', 'critism', 'mainly', 'sexual', 'content', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'stress', 'really', 'nothing', 'bad', 'especially', 'today', 'standards', 'nothing', 'close', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'remember', 'Graduate', 'caused', 'explosion', 'too', '1967.Adapted', 'Novel', 'Larry', 'McMurty', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'directed', 'PERFECTION', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'place', 'fall', '1951-fall', '1952', 'dying', 'small', 'town', 'Anarene', 'Texas', 'best', 'characters', 'film', 'ever', 'acting', 'simply', 'EXQUISITE', 'film', 'mainly', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Sonny', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'Duane', 'Jeff', 'Bridges-in', 'supporting', 'actor', 'academy', 'award', 'nominated', 'role', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'begining', 'get', 'time', 'change', 'crossroads', 'lives', 'Duane', 'girlfriend', 'Jacy', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd-in', 'wonderful', 'film', 'debut', 'girl', 'who', 'boys', 'have', 'eyes', 'Jacy', 'taken', 'Sonny', 'affair', 'coach', 'wife', 'Cloris', 'Leachman-Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'story', 'rolling', 'three', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'was', 'word', 'wonderful', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'garnered', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Nomination', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', '1974', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'beat', 'out', 'Oscar', 'year', 'character', 'changes', 'so', 'much', 'being', 'meek', 'quite', 'being', 'filled', 'joy', 'being', 'full', 'anger', 'final', 'moment', 'movie', 'why', 'Oscar', 'Eileen', 'Brennam', 'superb', 'Genevieve', 'waitress', 'mother-figure', 'Sonny', 'tough-talking', 'sincere', 'One', 'Most', 'Memorable', 'roles', 'Film', 'Sam', 'Lion', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'all-knowing', 'wise', 'man', 'who', 'picture', 'show', 'THe', 'scene', 'Lake', 'Classic', 'THis', 'role', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award.The', 'film', 'shot', 'black-and-white', 'feeling', 'depression', 'lonely', 'dying', 'feeling', 'town', 'evokes', 'music', 'true', 'time', 'also', 'part', 'movie', 'only', 'radio', 'record', 'player', 'background', 'music.People', 'country', 'roots', 'will', 'especially', 'like', 'one', 'will', 'who', 'like', 'study', 'films', 'one', 'one', 'most', 'importants', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'director', 'Adapted-screen', 'play', 'too', '8', 'nominations', '.Check', 'out', 'important', 'entertaining']",N/A
19328,A3TO3AY1UFM83U,0767827902,"not a natural ""Bob Bickel""","[0, 0]","This black and white film very effectively -- even painfully -- captures the pointless desolation, and pervasive banality of a small 1950's Texas oil town.  The film's signature line is delivered by ""Sam the Lion,"" owner of the town's decrepit pool hall, diner, and soon-to-close movie theater:  ""I've been puttin' up with this kind of trashy behavior all my life.""  This after local teenagers, more bored and adrift than mean spirited, pay a morbidly obese whore to service Sam's mentally retarded son.  Confusion, humiliation, nastyness, and shame are the predictable outcomes.Sam is a kind man who knew love once, but she married for oil money.  She remembers Sam proudly, though, and remains possessive of the fact of his past adoration.Sonny, one of the local teens, sensitive, well-meaning, and easily misled, knew love, too, with the wife of his red neck football coach.  But he broke her heart when, just for the Hell of it, the daughter or a rich oil man, husband of Sam's long-lost love, effortlessly led Sonny into an affair which came to nothing, just as she had planned.Cloris Leachman's performance as the dispirited wife of the football coach is brilliant.  When Sam's son is killed by a truck while sweeping the dust-covered dirt street in front of the pool hall, Sonny returns to her for comfort.  This prompts the most truthful rendering of broken-hearted, pathetic rage, clashing with love-lost hopelessness and lingering tenderness that I've ever seen.Oil wells keep on pumping and new wells are drilled, all the while raising the question, ""what's the point?""  For the characters in ""The Last Picture Show,"" there is none.  The closest they get to happiness is sitting by a man-made pond, smoking hand-rolled cigarettes, reminiscing, and fishing for fish that aren't there.",5,Life as hard as it is dull.,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,1794,"['black', 'white', 'film', 'very', 'effectively', 'even', 'painfully', 'pointless', 'desolation', 'pervasive', 'banality', 'small', '1950', 'Texas', 'oil', 'town', 'film', 'signature', 'line', 'delivered', 'Sam', 'Lion', 'owner', 'town', 'decrepit', 'pool', 'hall', 'diner', 'soon-to-close', 'movie', 'theater', ""'ve"", 'been', 'puttin', 'up', 'kind', 'trashy', 'behavior', 'life', 'local', 'teenagers', 'more', 'bored', 'adrift', 'mean', 'spirited', 'pay', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'whore', 'service', 'Sam', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'son', 'Confusion', 'humiliation', 'nastyness', 'shame', 'are', 'predictable', 'outcomes.Sam', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'knew', 'love', 'once', 'married', 'oil', 'money', 'Sam', 'proudly', 'possessive', 'fact', 'past', 'adoration.Sonny', 'one', 'local', 'teens', 'sensitive', 'well-meaning', 'easily', 'misled', 'knew', 'love', 'too', 'wife', 'red', 'neck', 'football', 'coach', 'broke', 'heart', 'when', 'just', 'Hell', 'daughter', 'rich', 'oil', 'man', 'husband', 'Sam', 'long-lost', 'love', 'effortlessly', 'led', 'Sonny', 'affair', 'came', 'nothing', 'just', 'had', 'planned.Cloris', 'Leachman', 'performance', 'dispirited', 'wife', 'football', 'coach', 'brilliant', 'When', 'Sam', 'son', 'killed', 'truck', 'sweeping', 'dust-covered', 'dirt', 'street', 'front', 'pool', 'hall', 'Sonny', 'comfort', 'most', 'truthful', 'rendering', 'broken-hearted', 'pathetic', 'rage', 'clashing', 'love-lost', 'hopelessness', 'lingering', 'tenderness', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Oil', 'wells', 'keep', 'pumping', 'new', 'wells', 'are', 'drilled', 'while', 'raising', 'question', 'what', 'point', 'characters', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'none', 'closest', 'get', 'happiness', 'sitting', 'man-made', 'pond', 'smoking', 'hand-rolled', 'cigarettes', 'reminiscing', 'fishing', 'fish', 'are', ""n't"", 'there']",N/A

Much like most of Mr. McMurty's work, the film is set in Texas.  The time is the mid 50's and like many towns at the time, TV was sweeping the land and fewer people were going to the movies, so the only movie theater in town is shutting down.  The picture isn't built around that, but more around that the idea of a loss of a more innocent time.  The film centers around Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) whose best friend is Duane (Jeff Bridges).  They were the captains of the high school football team, but they have since graduated.  Sonny still wears the varsity jacket as a sign that he was once something big.  He ends up having an affair with the football coaches plain wife. Cloris Leachman plays the wife and she brings a sadness to the role.  Sonny helps her feel young and alive, but she can never be with him.  Sonny ends up falling for Duane's girlfriend Jaycee (Cybil Shepard) and Duane leaves town.  Sonny &amp; Jaycee marry, but in the end everything breaks apart.  Mr. Bogdanovich filmed the movie in black and white and town is stark and dusty and we feel a sense of loss.  Ben Johnson appears a the all-knowing Lion and he and Ms. Leachman won the 1971 Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor &amp; actress respectively.

I thought about writing a review of that outstanding book.  However, it's the movie that always comes to mind whenever I try to remember the book.  You see, the movie was just as outstanding as the book, maybe even more so.  It has a tremendous cast and is one of those few movies where the supporting actors took away the Oscars (""A Steetcar Named Desire"" fits that bill as well).  Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shephard, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Ben Johnson all gave excellent preformances in their roles with Leachman and Johnson getting the well-deserved Oscars.  However, it was the directing by Peter Bogdanovich that was the most important contribution to the movie's success.Bogdanovich wisely chose to make his film seem like it was a contemporary movie of its' time.  The black and white film helped but so did the fact that nothing was made to look cute, quaint, or nostalgic.  We were seeing the present; it just happened to be the 1950's as well.  The cars, the clothes and other odds and ends were of that era but the story and the message were contemporary.  Yet they were spared the excesses of modern cinema so that we could focus on what the director wanted to show us.""The Last Picture Show"" is about the challenges of growing up.  For the younger characters, they try to grow too fast while the older characters struggle with the realization that the days gone by way outnumber the days to come.  Sam the Lion's soliloquy on growing old ranks right there with Ruth Popper's ""Why am I always appologizing to you!"" outburst.

He has made films since Last Picture Show, but gradually he faded and was more appreciated as a film critic. Orson Welles had been told by a friend that it was too bad he did the great one first. And so it goes.Filmed in black and white, the small, crudy Texas town from the early 50's holds secrets that a former resident, Larry McNulty tells in a series or novels. The characters are indeed from McNulty's youth. Either your family hit oil or you lived in dirt.  There's no in-between. The kids, rich and poor, attend the same high school and the football team is everyone's passion.  The boys are real excited about what's under those flouncy dresses. Jacy, the town prom queen-rich girl is testing her sexual powers, driving the poor boys, Tim Bottoms and Jeff Bridges to fistcuffs. She dumps 'em both finally to orgy with her own kind, the newly-rich teens and their mansions in a dust bowl.Themes of lost love, the wrong man to marry, the excitment and saddness of backseat sexuality, the dirt poor prostitues, and the good old boys collide with emotional deprivation.  Noone is more deprived than Cloris Leachman as the wife of a secretly gay football coach. Tim Bottoms has a May-August affair with the woman.  Her response with the coffee maker  after Tim's very brief marriage to manipulative Jacy is now a well deserved classic you have to see.

19340,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0767827902,Robert Morris,"[43, 44]","Larry McMurtry is among my favorite contemporary authors and this film is one of the best of those based on his works. Others include Hud (1963), Terms of Endearment (1983), Lonesome Dove (1989), and Texasville (1990). Directed by Peter Bogdanovich and set in fictitious Anarene (Texas) but filmed in Archer City, the focus is primarily on Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges), Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), and Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms). When the film begins, there are several separate but related plots which focus primarily on Duane and Jacy as well as on Sonny, a senior at the regional high school who becomes sexually involved with Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman), the love-starved wife of the school's football team coach. Leachman received an Academy Award for her performance in a supporting role as did Ben Jonson for his as ""Sam the Lion,"" owner of the Royal Movie Theater. It is worth noting that the last picture shown in it is Howard Hawks's Red River, a director and film which Bogdanovich greatly admires.The acting throughout the cast is outstanding. The film received nine Academy Award nominations and all were deserved. Much as Bogdanovich admires John Ford and Hawks whose western epics are among the finest films ever made, he chose to work  on a much smaller, more intimate scale. (Hopefully there will be no attempt to ""colorize"" The Last Picture Show. As with On the Waterfront, for example, it is inconceivable to me that it would be seen other than in black-and-white.) There are moments in this film when poignancy is almost unbearable. Anarene is dying a slow, relentless death. Many adult residents as well as their sons and daughters express frustration and even despair. Anarene's best qualities are revealed by Jonson's portrayal of ""Sam the Lion"" but he, like the town, is deteriorating. Because there is more passion (and sometimes lust) than tenderness in most of the personal relationships, his integrity is even more significant. In terms of character, his ""Sam the Lion"" provides the film's gravitational center. Credit Bogdanovich and McMurtry with collaborating on a brilliant adaptation of McMurtry's novel and Robert Surtees with (as always) stunning, indeed compelling cinematography. Those such as I who have already seen this film several times can easily recount defining moments in so many memorable scenes. We envy those who see The Last Picture Show for the first time.If those who are curious to know what happened to several of the lead characters many years later, I recommend the sequel, Texasville (1990). You may also enjoy Splendor in the Grass (1961), American Graffiti (1973), and Mystic Pizza (1988) as well as Fried Green Tomatoes and Rambling Rose (both in 1991).",5,Raging Hormones in a Small Texas Town,1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,2724,"['Larry', 'McMurtry', 'favorite', 'contemporary', 'authors', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'based', 'works', 'Others', 'include', 'Hud', '1963', 'Terms', 'Endearment', '1983', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', '1989', 'Texasville', '1990', 'Directed', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'set', 'fictitious', 'Anarene', 'Texas', 'filmed', 'Archer', 'City', 'focus', 'primarily', 'Duane', 'Jackson', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Jacy', 'Farrow', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'Sonny', 'Crawford', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'When', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'separate', 'related', 'plots', 'focus', 'primarily', 'Duane', 'Jacy', 'as', 'well', 'Sonny', 'senior', 'regional', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'sexually', 'involved', 'Ruth', 'Popper', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'love-starved', 'wife', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'coach', 'Leachman', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'supporting', 'role', 'did', 'Ben', 'Jonson', 'Sam', 'Lion', 'owner', 'Royal', 'Movie', 'Theater', 'worth', 'noting', 'last', 'picture', 'shown', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Red', 'River', 'director', 'film', 'Bogdanovich', 'greatly', 'acting', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'film', 'received', 'nine', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'were', 'deserved', 'Much', 'Bogdanovich', 'John', 'Ford', 'Hawks', 'western', 'epics', 'are', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'chose', 'work', 'much', 'smaller', 'more', 'intimate', 'scale', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'attempt', 'colorize', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Waterfront', 'example', 'inconceivable', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'other', 'black-and-white', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'poignancy', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'Anarene', 'dying', 'slow', 'relentless', 'death', 'Many', 'adult', 'residents', 'as', 'well', 'sons', 'daughters', 'express', 'frustration', 'even', 'despair', 'Anarene', 'best', 'qualities', 'are', 'revealed', 'Jonson', 'portrayal', 'Sam', 'Lion', 'town', 'deteriorating', 'more', 'passion', 'sometimes', 'lust', 'tenderness', 'most', 'personal', 'relationships', 'integrity', 'even', 'more', 'significant', 'terms', 'character', 'Sam', 'Lion', 'film', 'gravitational', 'center', 'Credit', 'Bogdanovich', 'McMurtry', 'collaborating', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'McMurtry', 'novel', 'Robert', 'Surtees', 'always', 'stunning', 'indeed', 'compelling', 'cinematography', 'such', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'can', 'easily', 'recount', 'defining', 'moments', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'envy', 'who', 'see', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'first', 'time.If', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'several', 'lead', 'characters', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'recommend', 'sequel', 'Texasville', '1990', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Splendor', 'Grass', '1961', 'American', 'Graffiti', '1973', 'Mystic', 'Pizza', '1988', 'as', 'well', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'Rambling', 'Rose', '1991']",N/A

19343,AVN00ASBFTMN6,0767827902,Smoking Ace,"[1, 1]","The town of Anarene is lonely very lonely. It is a desolated town where half of the buildings look long abandoned, tumbleweeds out number the entire population of people, and nothing much ever happens. Every character in this town is even lonelier. They all are in want of something, wanting to go somewhere, wanting to be with someone or seem to be mourning the loss of dreams that have passed them by. Three young teens fresh out of high school are among these lonely patrons, and although they have a desire to go places there is still something holding them back. And with this we have the set up for Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 classic film The Last Picture Show. One of the front runners of the New American Cinema Movement (Along with most of the films by Bob Rafelson) and still one of the most haunting pictorials on desire and the dying west.In the Last picture show we follow empathetic and disheveled Sonny (Tim Bottoms) along with  his friend Duane (Bridges) and his girl Jacy Farrow. These characters are different from one another but are all connected in that they know they want something but don't have a clue as to what it is. It is a typical dilemma seen in coming of age films, but here the characters are so well written by McMurtry and  so compelling that it never matters. Of the three teens, Jacy is the most fascinating to me. She is very villainous in the that she wants only what she cannot have and throws away everyone once she has them. But with this she is also empathetic, because like everyone else in the film she's only searching for that certain something that life has to offer.  And the real question is: Can she help being this way?In parallel to the young characters we have the adult patrons of the town who are all enveloped in their pasts with nothing but regrets to live with: Ruth Popper (Leachman) is miserable being married to her coach husband, the rich wife (Burstyn) pines for an escape from Anarene, and the town's propreiter Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) always seems to be in the act of taking a sad sigh. The  feelings these characters deal with is one of the most relatable aspects of the film. There have been many people I've come across where one could just look into their eyes and see that their life did not come out the way they wanted it to; all of them would've fit perfectly in this film. In the film's central scene, Sam the Lion reminisces about a short fling he had with a woman many years ago, and how that really was the one only woman he ever loved. It is a scene that is laced in regret, covered in sadness, and yet beautiful all at once; the closed in shot of his aged and melancholic eyes is enough to define this film alone.The cinematography of Last Picture is an important sum up of why we never should have let black and white film die. This is a stark and incredibly shot film that would've never been the same if it were in color. With its dark contrasts, field of depth, and haunting shades of dying Americana; the film looks like a thread of pictures from one of my grandmother's old yearbooks. It captures that era perfectly and is without doubt cinematographer Robert Surtees' best work.The terrific performances also help the film's air of authenticity. It's sad that Timothy Bottoms' star never took off after this film because his performance as the sad eyed sonny is mesmerizing and real. There is just something about the look in his eyes throughout the film that lingers with you long after the film is over. The ""Sweeping"" scene near the end was especially powerful. This was also Cybil Shepherd's first film, and in any other film I would say her acting left a lot to be desired. But here it ironically fleshes out the character of Jacy, making her come off as a fake princess trying fool everyone into her act. While the teens are good, The adult cast is even better with an oscar winning performance from Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn (her last scene especially), Ben Johnson, and Eileen Brennan. There was no way in heck to go wrong with this cast!The Last Picture Show is  as  one  of the seminal coming of age films but it has always been much more than that. It is a film that delves right into the heart of human nature. One that Shows us the things that hold back our deepest desires and that everything is always most desirable when out of reach. There is no doubt that the film is depressing, but it's that way for a reason. The end of an era is never happy, never jovial, it is always covered in sorrow and tumbleweeds.

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[2, 2]","Although this film is top notch in most respects it left me too sad and depressed to want to give it the full five star rating. The filmmakers certainly do an excellent job of portraying small town North Texas ( the Wichita Falls area is just below Oklahoma) life from the adults who obsess about the teenagers' football playing abilities to the petty cruelties and intrigues spawned by wind swept boredom. The actors are all well cast and bring their characters to life though I'll admit I was a little confused at first as to the family connections or lack there of for Duane, Billy, Sonny and Sam the Lion.  It amazes me  that when the film was released in 1971 it was portraying events that had happened only nineteen years previously (in 1952) since it seemed at the time it debuted it was all ready considered a movie about long gone days.

It's a film filled with sadness, with hopelessness, and isolation. It's a film about sex, not glamroized. It's an honest film. But it also contains a sweet tenderness, hidden beneath the scorn, the sadness, and the desperation. Oscar winner Cloris Leachman shines as the widow who shares a brief love affair with the main character. The film is beautiful, with its wide shots of the open skies, shot in black and white (uncommon in 1971), an obivous homage to John Ford.

19348,A17JVVAKWEB0M,0767827902,Wesley Mullins,"[4, 4]","As the author behind Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment and Brokeback Mountain, Larry McMurtry can be criticized for labored pacing, as he slows the action of his stories to delve deep into the souls of his characters. If captured accurately on screen, however, no characters possess the depth and dimension of his creations. Whether it's aging Texas Rangers on one last adventure or a combative mother and daughter, McMurtry's characters play on screen like real people we all know.Such is the case of the 1951 youth found in The Last Picture Show, a film unlike most teenage comedies and dramas because it does not appeal to the age group it features; rather, it's a grown-up's view of what youth was once like, as the story possesses the perspective and hindsight rarely granted to the young.  The strength of the film lies in capturing the main characters at the pinnacle moment when childhood fades away, as the wall between youth and adulthood crumbles.  So many teen films build a wall around the outside world, giving grown-ups all the importance and voice of Charlie Brown's wonking teacher.  But The Last Picture Show shows adults to be an integral part of growing up, from the old men who live vicariously through the football team, to the town's own Mrs. Robinsons and the oilmen who ogle their boss's daughter.Some will criticize the story as being plotless, and maybe the character development and relationships could be heightened by more concrete goals and motivations of the characters.  But rather than focusing on what the film is not, it's more important to focus on what it is: a powerfully realistic coming of age story about the emptiness and uncertainty of becoming an adult.",4,"About Teens, But For Grown-Ups",1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,1699,"['author', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'can', 'be', 'criticized', 'labored', 'pacing', 'action', 'stories', 'delve', 'deep', 'souls', 'characters', 'captured', 'accurately', 'screen', 'however', 'characters', 'possess', 'depth', 'dimension', 'creations', 'aging', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'one', 'last', 'adventure', 'combative', 'mother', 'daughter', 'McMurtry', 'characters', 'play', 'screen', 'real', 'people', 'know.Such', 'case', '1951', 'youth', 'found', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'film', 'most', 'teenage', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'not', 'appeal', 'age', 'group', 'rather', 'grown-up', 'view', 'what', 'youth', 'was', 'once', 'like', 'story', 'perspective', 'hindsight', 'rarely', 'granted', 'young', 'strength', 'film', 'capturing', 'main', 'characters', 'pinnacle', 'moment', 'when', 'childhood', 'away', 'wall', 'youth', 'adulthood', 'crumbles', 'So', 'many', 'teen', 'films', 'build', 'wall', 'outside', 'world', 'giving', 'grown-ups', 'importance', 'voice', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'wonking', 'teacher', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'adults', 'be', 'integral', 'part', 'growing', 'up', 'old', 'men', 'who', 'live', 'vicariously', 'football', 'team', 'town', 'own', 'Mrs.', 'Robinsons', 'oilmen', 'who', 'ogle', 'boss', 'daughter.Some', 'will', 'criticize', 'story', 'being', 'plotless', 'maybe', 'character', 'development', 'relationships', 'could', 'be', 'heightened', 'more', 'concrete', 'goals', 'motivations', 'characters', 'rather', 'focusing', 'what', 'film', 'not', 'more', 'important', 'focus', 'what', 'powerfully', 'realistic', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'emptiness', 'uncertainty', 'becoming', 'adult']",N/A
