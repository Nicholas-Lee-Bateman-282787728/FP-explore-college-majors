These 3 films which I am told are pretty faithful to Mary O'Hara's novels of the same titles (I have them too but never read them).  The main difference between them and the 2006 remake is that is the central character is named ""Ken (rather than Katy McLaughlin"", well at least the kept the same name in the remake) and is played by a young Roddy McDowell in the first 2 films and Robert Arthur in the third.  The reason he probably didn't do ""Green Grass"" is that the same year (1948) he was making the second big screen version of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped.  The first film was released on VHS years ago, and both the first 2 had been previously released on DVD to celebrate their 60th anniversaries.  Unfortunately those discs are out of print, albeit some Amazon sellers are still offering them separately or together.  But the copies in this set are exactly the same discs, except for the pictures on the jackets and the labels on the discs.  The text on the back of the boxes and list of chapter stops (on the lists and discs) are exactly the same as the previous releases.  This is also the only way to get all 3 (if you don't count the old copies) as only the first film has been re-released as a separate item (it also marks the first appearance of ""Green Grass"" on video in any way, shape or form).  By the way, it was also made into the a short lived tv series in 1956 which I doubt we will ever see again.  If you like the books and movies of Anna Sewell's Black Beauty and Walter Farley's Black Stallion and the 2006 remake interests (or interested you), get this set before they go out of print again.",5,The Classic Flicka Trilogy,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,1883,"['who', 'only', 'saw', 'new', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'bought', 'sight', 'unseen', 'looked', 'interesting', 'allowed', 'get', 'favorite', 'free', 'shipping', 'deal', 'here', 'chance', 'see', 'Original', 'stories', 'Flicka', 'son', 'Thunderhead', '3', 'films', 'am', 'told', 'are', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'Mary', ""O'Hara"", 'novels', 'same', 'titles', 'have', 'too', 'never', 'read', 'main', 'difference', '2006', 'remake', 'central', 'character', 'named', 'Ken', 'rather', 'Katy', 'McLaughlin', 'well', 'least', 'kept', 'same', 'name', 'remake', 'played', 'young', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'first', '2', 'films', 'Robert', 'Arthur', 'third', 'reason', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'Green', 'Grass', 'same', 'year', '1948', 'was', 'making', 'second', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'Kidnapped', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'VHS', 'years', 'ago', 'first', '2', 'had', 'been', 'previously', 'released', 'DVD', 'celebrate', '60th', 'anniversaries', 'Unfortunately', 'discs', 'are', 'print', 'Amazon', 'sellers', 'are', 'still', 'offering', 'separately', 'together', 'copies', 'set', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'discs', 'pictures', 'jackets', 'labels', 'discs', 'text', 'back', 'boxes', 'list', 'chapter', 'stops', 'lists', 'discs', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'previous', 'releases', 'also', 'only', 'way', 'get', '3', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'old', 'copies', 'only', 'first', 'film', 'been', 're-released', 'separate', 'item', 'also', 'first', 'appearance', 'Green', 'Grass', 'video', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'way', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'short', 'lived', 'tv', 'series', '1956', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'like', 'books', 'movies', 'Anna', 'Sewell', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'Walter', 'Farley', 'Black', 'Stallion', '2006', 'remake', 'interests', 'interested', 'get', 'set', 'go', 'print', 'again']",N/A

580132,AFM9DJYPNM7VT,B00005B234,"Goldencat ""Carla""","[2, 12]","I was enjoying this film from the library, thinking it was a safe family feature. I was WRONG!Near the end of the film, they shot a live cougar on camera - you can tell because of how it fell limply and landed, with its tongue moving as it tried to breathe. HORRIBLE. I had flashbacks for three days and feel nauseous even now! Criminal callous use of a trusting ""movie"" animal. All it did wrong was be born a cougar, and obey the handler to approach the camera. Rulf!!!!Also disturbing is that the first horse playing Flicka was REALLY entangled in wire - likely the barbed wire, judging from the horse's flailing on the ground and half closed eyes, as they cut her free. Watch the animal's expression. you cannot train an animal to exhibit shock and pain.I watched the wire cuts heal as the movie progressed, and suspect they were real ones, since wound and scab makup on a horse is doubtful in 1943. Meaning they did not just trip her up for the earlier scene. They snagged her in barb wire for real! SICK people. Disappointing for 1940s ""wholesome values"".I suspect they really did cue Flicka's dam to rear in the truck-bed, into the wooden ranch sign, injuring herself. Watch how she reacts to the impact.A genuine dead horse is shown close up, in the truck,as they confirm she is now dead. Flies are all over the muzzle, and the eyes are staring and fur is real. I think they either killed that horse for the scene, or another one. Maybe killed her because she hurt herself on the sign poles. This makes 3 deliberate acts of harm to trained movie animals.The body in the creek scene later is also a dead real horse - a starved looking one. I shudder to think they starved and killed another animal for THAT scene, to play the sickness-wasted Flicka, cooling her fever in the water!Hard to believe no one else saw this or was disturbed.I would not want kids to see this and take away that animals are expendable for entertainment. the handling of animals here contradicts the message of love the movie should send.I wish there were warnings about this sort of thing. It would never get made these days, thanks to Humane Association efforts, thank God!Burn the copy, keep the book, is my advice.

580134,A1MMHWECXEUVRR,B00005B234,"Harrell Rumfield ""Fan of Good Movies""","[41, 41]","I'm giving this trilogy 4 stars based on its viewability and enjoyability for the family to watch.  However, being a fan of Mary O'Hara's books (I read these when I was about 7 or 8), I was very disappointed in the way the story line strays from the books.  Perhaps I am being overly critical, if so, I apologize to those offended.The scenery is beautiful.  The cinematography is great.  The story line in ""Flicka"" (disc 1) is a little closer to the book than the other two.But what happened to the older brother?  The competition between Ken and his brother Howard was very important.  However, the story line stays relatively close, and the moral of the story is there.  Ken learns a lesson about responsibility, but at the same time realizes the imprtance of believing in the decisions you have made.In the seond dis, ""Thunderhead"", the panorama of the mountains and the cinematography are still great.  Perhaps even better, and the story line doesn't wander too terribly far astray, but it does deviate.  Again, the absence of the brother in this story completely ingnores the bortherly competition, and the maturing that goes with it.  And disappointingly (and erroneously) the McLaughlin stallion Banner does not die.  Hurts part of the story in the next book.  Still, the maturing of Ken and the developing respect between father and son are quite evident.In the third film ""Green Grass"", the original story line goes on vacation to far away places.  Beaver Greeenway is an uncle, not a grandfather.  The grandmother (who dominates Carey's life) is gone, and the brother is still missing.  And what happened to Pete, the hobo Clydesdale?  And where did all those trotters come from?  They were supposed to be jumpers.  All in all, a completely different story.  Panoramic cinematography still great.  Different actors still did a credible job.After all of that, when I watched the movies, I still enjoyed them thoroughly just as I did as a youngster.  If you are a real fan of the books, you may find yourself disappointed, so watch it for the sake of enjoyment, not as they relate to Mary O'Hara's novels.",4,Family Entertainment - Yes.,1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,2113,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'trilogy', '4', 'stars', 'based', 'viewability', 'enjoyability', 'family', 'watch', 'However', 'being', 'fan', 'Mary', ""O'Hara"", 'books', 'read', 'when', 'was', 'about', '7', '8', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'way', 'story', 'line', 'strays', 'books', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'being', 'overly', 'critical', 'so', 'apologize', 'offended.The', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'Flicka', 'disc', '1', 'little', 'closer', 'book', 'other', 'two.But', 'what', 'happened', 'older', 'brother', 'competition', 'Ken', 'brother', 'Howard', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'However', 'story', 'line', 'relatively', 'close', 'moral', 'story', 'there', 'Ken', 'lesson', 'responsibility', 'same', 'time', 'imprtance', 'believing', 'decisions', 'have', 'made.In', 'seond', 'dis', 'Thunderhead', 'panorama', 'mountains', 'cinematography', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'story', 'line', ""n't"", 'wander', 'too', 'terribly', 'far', 'astray', 'deviate', 'Again', 'absence', 'brother', 'story', 'completely', 'bortherly', 'competition', 'maturing', 'disappointingly', 'erroneously', 'McLaughlin', 'stallion', 'Banner', 'not', 'die', 'Hurts', 'part', 'story', 'next', 'book', 'Still', 'maturing', 'Ken', 'developing', 'respect', 'father', 'son', 'are', 'quite', 'evident.In', 'third', 'film', 'Green', 'Grass', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'vacation', 'far', 'away', 'places', 'Beaver', 'Greeenway', 'uncle', 'not', 'grandfather', 'grandmother', 'who', 'Carey', 'life', 'gone', 'brother', 'still', 'missing', 'what', 'happened', 'Pete', 'hobo', 'Clydesdale', 'where', 'did', 'trotters', 'come', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'jumpers', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'Panoramic', 'cinematography', 'still', 'great', 'Different', 'actors', 'still', 'did', 'credible', 'job.After', 'when', 'watched', 'movies', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'just', 'did', 'youngster', 'are', 'real', 'fan', 'books', 'may', 'find', 'disappointed', 'so', 'watch', 'sake', 'enjoyment', 'not', 'relate', 'Mary', ""O'Hara"", 'novels']",N/A

The boy chooses a wild, problem, colt, which the father believes is too dangerous to ever be ridden; but a promise is a promise.The story is interesting with some action and drama; moves at a good pace; and then there is the wise-cracking, little sister.I saw this free on Hulu, but with lots of commercials.

His father (Preston Foster) does not understand the boy and punishes him often in an attempt to straighten his son out. It doesn't work, and mother (Rita Johnson) suggests the boy be given a horse of his own. She reasons that if he has some responsibility, it will carry over into other aspects of his life too. Of course, Ken wants a wild horse named Flicka, the offspring of a ""loco"" horse named Rocket.The cast is very good, especially the young McDowall. His sincerity and innocence is very appealing, both traits that stayed with him into later life. He was an asset to the film community and a real legend. Patti Hale is also worth mentioning for her small role as Ken's sister; she has plenty of spunk and personality.The biggest problem with this movie is its over-sentimentality. Although these kinds of family pictures were a big hit during WWII and afterward, sometimes they were too saccharine. The ending is completely preachy and spells out the moral too plainly. It is almost insulting how blatantly we are told what we should have learned from the story.

There are just two things that bug me:. Banner, the big stud and Rocket, Flicka's mother, seemed to have switched colors around. Banner was described as  red-gold and Rocket was described as a big, black mare. In the film, Rocket became a flaxen sorrel and Banner turned into a very dark bay.At least Rocket still had that rope around her neck.. Howard, Ken's older brother, has been replaced with Hildey, an annoying girl who is the daughter of Gus, the Swedish ranch hand. At least she has some form of likability, like Howard, and isn't a total brat. Still, why replace Howard? He was kind of important.However, those are the only major gripes I have about this film.
