341413,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302862884,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","10 Rillington Place, 1971 filmIt starts in 1944 London. A woman arrives to see Mr. Christie, his wife is away. She has asthma and is given medication and placed on a cot. [No socialized medicine.] Christie is a Special Constable. Afterwards Christie digs in his backyard. Then its 1949. A flat is for rent. A young couple stop by to look at these two rooms. [War-time shortages.] They'll take it. Later Christie drops in with a cup of tea for Beryl, then her friend drops by. Tim gets a letter asking for overdue payments (he lost his job). Tim is illiterate. Beryl has unwanted news. Tim compensates for his deficiencies by bragging about a non-existent situation at the public house. [Note how poverty causes conflicts.] Christie knows the law, he gives out orders. [Note the uncrowded streets where children play, the unlocked doors and backyard privies.] Has Beryl seen the doctor?Christie offers advice to Beryl. She talks to Tim about ""termination"". At 7 a week they can't afford another baby. Tim talks to Christie, who explains the risks. Confidence? Christie sends his wife out on an errand, then packs his equipment. The doorbell rings, two men arrive for repairs on the house. ""A couple of days."" Beryl gets her treatment. ""That's a good girl."" She fights back but loses. Beryl's friend comes by, but leaves. The baby cries. Tim is told ""it didn't work"". Christie warns Tim about what could happen to him now. ""I just don't know what to do."" Christie warns Tim what the police will deduce from the fights with his wife. Tim told self-serving lies (to inflate his importance). Christie tells Tim what to do, he promises to fix things up. [The flight of Tim would be a sign of guilt.] Later Christie commits another murder! Tim visits his friends. Christie tells his wife what ""Tim"" did. They'll do nothing. Christie carries a heavy load in the dark. ""Where is Beryl and the baby?""Tim's anger could be a sign of guilt. [The effect of his low status?] Tim goes to the police for a chat. He had disposed of his wife. The police investigate. Tim is questioned again. Christie helps the police investigation, they find a bundle in the washhouse! Tim is arrested and brought back to London. Was his confession coerced? [There are ways to make an innocent man confess to a crime they didn't do.] Christie denies everything he told Tim. Christie takes medicine for his pain of fibrositis. He was convicted for ""dishonesty"" (in the 1920s). He was a veteran of WW I and was gassed. Tim Evans is examined by doctors. ""Christie did it."" No medical grounds to a reprieve. The sentence is executed. Two years later Christie is in pain from his back and can't work. It hurts him to work in his basement. He meets a woman who suffers from migraine. Later he sells his furniture for money. He lives in a men's shelter now. New people occupy this house in Notting Hill, they find what his hidden behind a wall! While he stands by a river he is arrested by a policeman. Christie confessed and was hanged in Pentonville Prison. Tim Evans was given a full pardon, his body was exhumed and re-buried in consecrated ground.This movie tends toward dullness. It could have been more successful if they added the sensational aspects of these crimes. This case led to the abolishment of the death penalty in Great Britain. Some say one in ten convictions are of innocent persons. Wouldn't it be better to improve the justice system with added safeguards to prevent the conviction of the innocent? Providing forensic experts as well as public defenders would help. A confession by itself isn't good enough without corroboration. There are ways to produce false confessions [see the movie ""Boomerang"" or some other true crime cases]. There is no cure for biased jurors [as in Sacco & Vanzetti] or for political persecution [as in Tom Mooney and Warren Knox Billings].",4,The Famous Murder Case,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,3848,"['10', 'Rillington', 'Place', '1971', 'filmIt', '1944', 'London', 'A', 'woman', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Christie', 'wife', 'away', 'asthma', 'given', 'medication', 'placed', 'cot', 'socialized', 'medicine', ']', 'Christie', 'Special', 'Constable', 'Afterwards', 'Christie', 'digs', 'backyard', 'Then', '1949', 'flat', 'rent', 'young', 'couple', 'stop', 'look', 'two', 'rooms', '[', 'War-time', 'shortages', ']', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Later', 'Christie', 'drops', 'cup', 'tea', 'Beryl', 'then', 'friend', 'drops', 'Tim', 'letter', 'asking', 'overdue', 'payments', 'lost', 'job', 'Tim', 'illiterate', 'Beryl', 'unwanted', 'news', 'Tim', 'deficiencies', 'bragging', 'non-existent', 'situation', 'public', 'house', '[', 'Note', 'how', 'poverty', 'conflicts', ']', 'Christie', 'law', 'out', 'orders', '[', 'Note', 'uncrowded', 'streets', 'where', 'children', 'play', 'unlocked', 'doors', 'backyard', 'privies', ']', 'Has', 'Beryl', 'seen', 'doctor', 'Christie', 'advice', 'Beryl', 'Tim', 'termination', '7', 'week', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'baby', 'Tim', 'talks', 'Christie', 'who', 'risks', 'Confidence', 'Christie', 'wife', 'out', 'errand', 'then', 'equipment', 'doorbell', 'rings', 'two', 'men', 'arrive', 'repairs', 'house', 'couple', 'days', 'Beryl', 'treatment', 'good', 'girl', 'back', 'Beryl', 'friend', 'baby', 'cries', 'Tim', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Christie', 'Tim', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'now', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Christie', 'Tim', 'what', 'police', 'will', 'deduce', 'fights', 'wife', 'Tim', 'told', 'self-serving', 'lies', 'inflate', 'importance', 'Christie', 'Tim', 'what', 'do', 'fix', 'things', 'up', '[', 'flight', 'Tim', 'would', 'be', 'sign', 'guilt', ']', 'Later', 'Christie', 'murder', 'Tim', 'friends', 'Christie', 'wife', 'what', 'Tim', 'did', ""'ll"", 'do', 'nothing', 'Christie', 'heavy', 'load', 'dark', 'Where', 'Beryl', 'baby', 'Tim', 'anger', 'could', 'be', 'sign', 'guilt', '[', 'effect', 'low', 'status', ']', 'Tim', 'police', 'chat', 'had', 'disposed', 'wife', 'police', 'investigate', 'Tim', 'questioned', 'again', 'Christie', 'police', 'investigation', 'find', 'bundle', 'washhouse', 'Tim', 'arrested', 'brought', 'back', 'London', 'Was', 'confession', 'coerced', 'are', 'ways', 'make', 'innocent', 'man', 'confess', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', ']', 'Christie', 'everything', 'told', 'Tim', 'Christie', 'medicine', 'pain', 'fibrositis', 'was', 'convicted', 'dishonesty', '1920s', 'was', 'veteran', 'WW', 'was', 'gassed', 'Tim', 'Evans', 'examined', 'doctors', 'Christie', 'did', 'No', 'medical', 'grounds', 'reprieve', 'sentence', 'executed', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'Christie', 'pain', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'work', 'basement', 'woman', 'who', 'migraine', 'Later', 'furniture', 'money', 'men', 'shelter', 'now', 'New', 'people', 'occupy', 'house', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'find', 'what', 'hidden', 'wall', 'river', 'arrested', 'policeman', 'Christie', 'confessed', 'was', 'hanged', 'Pentonville', 'Prison', 'Tim', 'Evans', 'was', 'given', 'full', 'pardon', 'body', 'was', 'exhumed', 're-buried', 'consecrated', 'ground.This', 'movie', 'dullness', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'added', 'sensational', 'aspects', 'crimes', 'case', 'led', 'abolishment', 'death', 'penalty', 'Great', 'Britain', 'say', 'one', 'ten', 'convictions', 'are', 'innocent', 'persons', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'improve', 'justice', 'system', 'added', 'safeguards', 'prevent', 'conviction', 'innocent', 'Providing', 'forensic', 'experts', 'as', 'well', 'public', 'defenders', 'would', 'help', 'confession', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'corroboration', 'are', 'ways', 'produce', 'false', 'confessions', '[', 'see', 'movie', 'Boomerang', 'other', 'true', 'crime', 'cases', ']', 'cure', 'biased', 'jurors', '[', 'Sacco', 'Vanzetti', ']', 'political', 'persecution', '[', 'Tom', 'Mooney', 'Warren', 'Knox', 'Billings', ']']",N/A

341415,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302862884,Austin Somlo,"[2, 2]","Viewed: 6/10Rate: 76/10: I've read about the English serial killer a while ago, and I've been aware of the movie 10 Rillington Place. It's impossible to get ahold of a copy of it, especially with closed-captions, and I got lucky to catch it on TCM channel. Very nice of them to do so. About 10 Rillington Place, it is a very British movie, and the information in the picture do match the facts most of the time. I was surprised how they altered the discovery of the bodies behind a wall-paper because that's not how it happened. On the other hand, I must say that the movie can create a bad impression for anyone who is willing to copy that method of killing. So, it's a good thing that 10 Rillington Place is a very rare picture. My sole reason for giving `7' for the movie is that it gets boring at times, and I can't see myself watching it over and over with the same level of enthusiasm. I was impressed how the picture was filmed in the actual location of the killings, and also, the case was the biggest reason why the death penalty was abolished in Britain. The hanging scene of Timothy John Evans is absolutely impressive because it felt so sudden. It reminded me of the one with Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking. I liked the baldness of Richard Attenborough. It's a very nice make-up job.

341417,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,6302862884,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","Supposedly, this case caused England to eliminate the death penalty completely because an ""innocent man"" was hanged.  Well, Timothy Evans wasn't exactly innocent, and calling him a ""moron"" ex post facto may not even be sufficient.First of all, if you've seen enough crime TV -- evidently Mr. Evans hadn't, but I suppose you can't blame him too much due to the era -- you know that you have two options with the police.  And those two options are almost mutually exclusive:1.  Tell the truth.2.  Invoke your right to counsel and keep your mouth shut.Mr. Evans heeded neither of these options.  Oh, and I almost always recommend option two.If this film is accurate -- I'm not sure myself since I just heard about this case -- then he should have gone to the cops immediately when the ""termination"" caused his wife to die, and he should have pointed the finger rightfully so at John Christie.  After that, Mr. Evans shouldn't have turned himself in, but if he did, he should have been up front and told them the truth.  And then after that, he shouldn't have changed his story again, causing the police to no longer believe a word that he was saying.  Hey, can you blame them?Well, all is not lost, because even if Mr. Evans was stupid, this film actually was not.  I particularly liked the HD 16 x 9 digital transfer here playing on my Samsung BD with apps.  The film looked and sounded terrific.  And it was very nice to see the very young John Hurt as the bumbling father, as I believe that this was the earliest work in which I've ever seen him.  Richard Attenborough was also young and good.This is to some degree a cautionary tale, a tale that tells you more what not to do than what to do.  But I believe that this story, and this film, were unfortunately used as political ammunition for the bleeding-hearted Left to argue against and eliminate the death penalty, at least in England.  Because of this, I feel that I may introduce politics myself.  Here we go:The old ""If one innocent person dies, that is one person too many"" argument falls on deaf ears to me, because it would be easy to retain capital punishment and guarantee this doesn't happen in today's era.  Just require overwhelming video, audio, or DNA evidence; Paul Bernardo, The Toybox Killer and The Toolbox Killers are obvious examples of cases with overwhelming evidence where the death penalty is not only justified but desirable.  (None of these guys unfortunately were executed.  One is alive and in prison in Canada, where 25 years is ""life""; one died of a heart attack just after sentencing; another is still sitting on Death Row 20 years later at San Quentin, right down the road from me.)Well America, just because England threw the baby out with the bathwater doesn't mean that we should be stupid enough to be in the way of that infant's backwash.

Christie murdered several women and buried them in the back garden of his tawdry, depressing little terrace in a squalid part of London. When he ran out of room there he started boarding up the extra corpses behind the walls of the outhouse. Eerily it is apparent in the film that his wife suspected or even knew what was going on and did nothing. Christie's crimes were certainly not discussed over cups of afternoon tea. This seriously disturbed little man lured his victims to the house under the pretext of performing illegal backyard abortions on them: this was the 50's.

The scenes are haunting and made yet more gruesome by the ever present offer of a cup of tea with which Christie sought to put his victims  off their guard. The movie is roughly based on the book by Ludovic Kennedy  with some shortcutting. For example, Miss Edie was not Christie's first  victim and he did not invariably use a gas contraption to make the women  unconscious.  A couple of more recent books have argued that lodger Timothy  Evans knew more about the murder of his wife and baby than he admitted.

341424,AZXUFTJVXJWL0,6302862884,John Dynan,"[23, 23]","10 Rillington Place is not a fun movie for those looking for a Saturday night popcorn/splatter fest. It is a hard-edged, harrowing account of the true story of British mass-murderer John Reginald Christie and his hapless fall guy, Timothy Evans. The film, directed by Richard Fleischer and featuring Richard Attenborough and John Hurt in the two leading roles, is based on the book of the same name written by prolific British writer Ludovic Kennedy. This controversial case, which resulted in two hangings, came back to haunt Britain after everyone thought it had been resolved and was paramount in the abandonment of capital punishment in the UK. The slant in this film is unmistakeable.Starting in 1949, the Evans family: Timothy, his wife Beryl and their baby daughter Geraldine, arrived at Christie's dingy Rillington Place address to rent the apartment on the top floor. Christie had already killed two women by this time and would continue to do so after the Evans's had gone. Timothy Evans was a compulsive liar of rather limited intelligence and it was his gullibility combined with Christie's manipulative talents which would eventually get him into trouble.Posing as a backyard abortionist, Christie sets to work on the newly-pregnant Beryl with predictably awful results and this is one of the most distressing scenes in this very disturbing film. He then convinces Evans that he should leave or face the consequences, promising to place the baby in the care of some friends in Acton. For Evans, as if things weren't bad enough already, they only get worse from here.Shot in the original street and using exteriors fronm the actual house, the film has a very stark confronting atmosphere with a seedy brown look, all accentuated by the quietness and lack of music. The acting is very powerful: Attenborough being particularly villainous and the direction is very tight. Intelligently scripted and with no actual gore, it is ""the thinking person's horror movie"". The result is superb pace and an utterly chilling atmosphere. I think the feeling I got most from this film was one of absolute helplessness and revulsion. A first rate film which makes a very clear point, 10 Rillington Place has a very important message for all and goes way beyond other films of the same genre.",5,Chilling story...,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,2287,"['10', 'Rillington', 'Place', 'not', 'fun', 'movie', 'looking', 'Saturday', 'night', 'popcorn/splatter', 'fest', 'hard-edged', 'harrowing', 'account', 'true', 'story', 'British', 'mass-murderer', 'John', 'Reginald', 'Christie', 'hapless', 'fall', 'guy', 'Timothy', 'Evans', 'film', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Fleischer', 'featuring', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'John', 'Hurt', 'two', 'leading', 'roles', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'prolific', 'British', 'writer', 'Ludovic', 'Kennedy', 'controversial', 'case', 'resulted', 'two', 'hangings', 'came', 'back', 'haunt', 'Britain', 'everyone', 'thought', 'had', 'been', 'resolved', 'was', 'paramount', 'abandonment', 'capital', 'punishment', 'UK', 'slant', 'film', 'unmistakeable.Starting', '1949', 'Evans', 'family', 'Timothy', 'wife', 'Beryl', 'baby', 'daughter', 'Geraldine', 'arrived', 'Christie', 'dingy', 'Rillington', 'Place', 'address', 'rent', 'apartment', 'top', 'floor', 'Christie', 'had', 'already', 'killed', 'two', 'women', 'time', 'would', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'Evans', 'had', 'gone', 'Timothy', 'Evans', 'was', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'rather', 'limited', 'intelligence', 'was', 'gullibility', 'combined', 'Christie', 'manipulative', 'talents', 'would', 'eventually', 'get', 'trouble.Posing', 'backyard', 'abortionist', 'Christie', 'work', 'newly-pregnant', 'Beryl', 'predictably', 'awful', 'results', 'one', 'most', 'distressing', 'scenes', 'very', 'disturbing', 'film', 'then', 'Evans', 'should', 'leave', 'face', 'consequences', 'promising', 'place', 'baby', 'care', 'friends', 'Acton', 'Evans', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'already', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'here.Shot', 'original', 'street', 'using', 'exteriors', 'fronm', 'actual', 'house', 'film', 'very', 'stark', 'confronting', 'atmosphere', 'seedy', 'brown', 'look', 'accentuated', 'quietness', 'lack', 'music', 'acting', 'very', 'powerful', 'being', 'particularly', 'villainous', 'direction', 'very', 'tight', 'Intelligently', 'scripted', 'actual', 'gore', 'thinking', 'person', 'horror', 'movie', 'result', 'superb', 'pace', 'utterly', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'think', 'feeling', 'got', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'absolute', 'helplessness', 'revulsion', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'very', 'clear', 'point', '10', 'Rillington', 'Place', 'very', 'important', 'message', 'way', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'genre']",N/A

As the story unfolded and the ghastly monster beneath the surface was revealed my heart went cold...as for John Hurt, as always, he held me spellbound...as soon as I hear his voice I know I am watching a class A actor (it's hard to remember he's only acting - so undderrated!). I found myself crying out at the television, trying to warn him...and although simple, his character is even more likable than Attenborough's, also, I felt very angry at the police and their lacklustre and pathetic investigation... no wonder the wrong man got hung.

341437,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6302862884,trebe,"[2, 2]","Based quite closely on actual events, 10 Rillington Place (1971) is a very interesting dramatization concerning a mild-mannered English gent, with a compulsion to kill.  This notorious case, where an apparently innocent man was executed, eventually led to the abolition of capital punishment in Great Britain.  This review contains major spoilers, so proceed at your own risk.The film opens in 1944, with a woman arriving at 10 Rillington Place in Notting Hill, where her co-worker John Christie (Richard Attenborough) resides.  She is there for some kind of medical procedure, as Christie is apparently in the habit of claiming to have some medical knowledge.  However after administering a little ""medicinal"" gas, Christie strangles the woman, and buries her in the backyard.Jumping ahead to 1949, Christie is still living at the same address, operating a run down three storey rooming house, with his wife Ethel (Pat Heywood).  Christie has taken in a young family Timothy Evans (John Hurt), his wife Beryl (Judy Geeson), and their daughter Geraldine, as tenants on the third floor.  Beryl is pregnant, but the couple can afford to have another child.  Christie volunteers to perform an illegal abortion, which both of the Evans' are agreeable to.  After sending his wife out of the house on an errand, Christie strangles the poor young girl in her kitchen.Tim is in shock after hearing the news, and fearing the police, is convinced to run away, while Christie supposedly disposes of the body, and takes care of Geraldine.  Keeping his wife in the dark, after Evans leaves, Christie uses Evans' tie to strangle the baby.  The bodies of mother and child are stored in a small outhouse.  Evans goes to stay with relatives, but guilt takes over, and he turns himself into the police.  The police arrive at 10 Rillington Place and discover the Beryl and her daughter, but apparently miss finding the human remains from previous murders buried in the garden.Evans goes on trial for murder, claiming that Christie really committed the crimes.  Although it is revealed during the trial that Christie has a past criminal history, Evans is convicted of murder, and is hanged.  Ethel Christie begins to distrust her husband, eventually becoming his next victim a few years later.  Christie buries her under the floorboards in this kitchen.  After being inactive, this murder seems to acts as a trigger, as Christie soon lures more women to his flat, and kills them using his gassing technique.  The victims' bodies are stored in a hidden compartment in the house.Distinguished veteran director Richard Fleischer (Fantastic Voyage, Soylent Green, Tora! Tora! Tora!) had previously encountered controversy, in telling a story based on a serial killer in The Boston Strangler (1968).  This time, although a dramatization, 10 Rillington Place appears to be remarkably faithful to the details in the case, such as the method used for killing, and how the bodies were disposed.  An exception is not being explicit about Christie's supposed sexual assault of some of the women, and his frequenting of prostitutes.  The Evans family actually lived at 10 Rillington Place for some time before Beryl's murder occurred.  She gave birth to Geraldine while living there, which if anything makes the murders even worse, as John Christie knew the family very, very well.  The corpses hidden in the house were actually discovered by new tenants moving into Christie's former flat.  John Christie was subsequently arrested, and confessed to seven murders.  He was found guilty of murder and hung.  Why the smell from the dead bodies did not lead to discovery is unclear.Public controversy due to this case and several other similar cases, eventually brought to an end, the practice of capital punishment.  Supposedly, although Richard Attenborough found the character John Christie reprehensible, he took the role due to his strong belief that the death penalty was unjust.  Attenborough, who bears a superficial resemblance to Christie, gives a riveting and gripping performance as the serial killer.  John Hurt is also excellent as the confused Evans, and Judy Geeson is very good in an abbreviated role.Mostly faithful to the truth, and with some excellent acting performances, this is a great film for lovers of true crime.  It may lack the spectacular fireworks of some fictionalized tales, but it makes up for it with a sober presentation that chilling captures the spirit of the events, sticks to the facts, and does right by the unfortunate victims, without dragging anyone into the gutter.",5,"a notorious and historic case, featuring a serial murderer in notting hill...",1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,4575,"['Based', 'quite', 'closely', 'actual', 'events', '10', 'Rillington', 'Place', '1971', 'very', 'interesting', 'dramatization', 'concerning', 'mild-mannered', 'English', 'gent', 'compulsion', 'kill', 'notorious', 'case', 'where', 'apparently', 'innocent', 'man', 'was', 'executed', 'eventually', 'led', 'abolition', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Great', 'Britain', 'review', 'major', 'spoilers', 'so', 'proceed', 'own', 'risk.The', 'film', '1944', 'woman', 'arriving', '10', 'Rillington', 'Place', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'where', 'co-worker', 'John', 'Christie', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'there', 'kind', 'medical', 'procedure', 'Christie', 'apparently', 'habit', 'claiming', 'have', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'However', 'administering', 'little', 'medicinal', 'gas', 'Christie', 'woman', 'backyard.Jumping', 'ahead', '1949', 'Christie', 'still', 'living', 'same', 'address', 'operating', 'run', 'down', 'three', 'storey', 'rooming', 'house', 'wife', 'Ethel', 'Pat', 'Heywood', 'Christie', 'taken', 'young', 'family', 'Timothy', 'Evans', 'John', 'Hurt', 'wife', 'Beryl', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'daughter', 'Geraldine', 'tenants', 'third', 'floor', 'Beryl', 'pregnant', 'couple', 'can', 'afford', 'have', 'child', 'Christie', 'volunteers', 'perform', 'illegal', 'abortion', 'Evans', 'are', 'agreeable', 'sending', 'wife', 'house', 'errand', 'Christie', 'poor', 'young', 'girl', 'kitchen.Tim', 'shock', 'hearing', 'news', 'fearing', 'police', 'convinced', 'run', 'away', 'Christie', 'supposedly', 'body', 'care', 'Geraldine', 'Keeping', 'wife', 'dark', 'Evans', 'Christie', 'Evans', 'tie', 'strangle', 'baby', 'bodies', 'mother', 'child', 'are', 'stored', 'small', 'outhouse', 'Evans', 'stay', 'relatives', 'guilt', 'police', 'police', 'arrive', '10', 'Rillington', 'Place', 'discover', 'Beryl', 'daughter', 'apparently', 'miss', 'finding', 'human', 'previous', 'murders', 'buried', 'garden.Evans', 'trial', 'murder', 'claiming', 'Christie', 'really', 'committed', 'crimes', 'revealed', 'trial', 'Christie', 'past', 'criminal', 'history', 'Evans', 'convicted', 'murder', 'hanged', 'Ethel', 'Christie', 'distrust', 'husband', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'next', 'victim', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Christie', 'floorboards', 'kitchen', 'being', 'inactive', 'murder', 'acts', 'trigger', 'Christie', 'soon', 'more', 'women', 'flat', 'using', 'gassing', 'technique', 'victims', 'bodies', 'are', 'stored', 'hidden', 'compartment', 'house.Distinguished', 'veteran', 'director', 'Richard', 'Fleischer', 'Fantastic', 'Voyage', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'Tora', 'Tora', 'Tora', 'had', 'previously', 'encountered', 'controversy', 'telling', 'story', 'based', 'serial', 'killer', 'Boston', 'Strangler', '1968', 'time', 'dramatization', '10', 'Rillington', 'Place', 'be', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'details', 'case', 'such', 'method', 'used', 'killing', 'how', 'bodies', 'were', 'disposed', 'exception', 'not', 'being', 'explicit', 'Christie', 'supposed', 'sexual', 'assault', 'women', 'frequenting', 'prostitutes', 'Evans', 'family', 'actually', 'lived', '10', 'Rillington', 'Place', 'time', 'Beryl', 'murder', 'occurred', 'gave', 'birth', 'Geraldine', 'living', 'there', 'anything', 'murders', 'even', 'worse', 'John', 'Christie', 'knew', 'family', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'corpses', 'hidden', 'house', 'were', 'actually', 'discovered', 'new', 'tenants', 'moving', 'Christie', 'former', 'flat', 'John', 'Christie', 'was', 'subsequently', 'arrested', 'confessed', 'seven', 'murders', 'was', 'found', 'guilty', 'murder', 'hung', 'Why', 'smell', 'dead', 'bodies', 'did', 'not', 'lead', 'discovery', 'unclear.Public', 'controversy', 'due', 'case', 'several', 'other', 'similar', 'cases', 'eventually', 'brought', 'end', 'practice', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Supposedly', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'found', 'character', 'John', 'Christie', 'reprehensible', 'took', 'role', 'due', 'strong', 'belief', 'death', 'penalty', 'was', 'unjust', 'Attenborough', 'who', 'superficial', 'resemblance', 'Christie', 'riveting', 'gripping', 'performance', 'serial', 'killer', 'John', 'Hurt', 'also', 'excellent', 'confused', 'Evans', 'Judy', 'Geeson', 'very', 'good', 'abbreviated', 'role.Mostly', 'faithful', 'truth', 'excellent', 'acting', 'performances', 'great', 'film', 'lovers', 'true', 'crime', 'may', 'lack', 'spectacular', 'fireworks', 'fictionalized', 'tales', 'up', 'sober', 'presentation', 'chilling', 'spirit', 'events', 'sticks', 'facts', 'right', 'unfortunate', 'victims', 'dragging', 'anyone', 'gutter']",N/A
