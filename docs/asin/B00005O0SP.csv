This prequel to Lonesome Dove detailing some of the adventures of the young Rangers, Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call, was written by Larry McMurtry and features all of his trademark specialities: complex heroes, pitiless &amp; mean villains, politically incorrect fierce &amp; merciless Apaches &amp; Comanches, a wild trek lead by a half-mad pirate (F. Murray Abraham), a motley collection of wilderness folks, wise &amp; unruffled Scouts (Keith Carradine &amp; Harry Dean Stanton) and a young whore with more guts and heart than most men.In short, it is a hell of a tale, well told.  The cast is excellent all the way around, and the choices made for the young Woodrow Call (Johnny Lee Miller) and Gus McCrae (David Arquette) fortuitous.  In Miller we see the beginnings of the stubborn iron will and dtermination of Woodrow Call, as well as his natural acceptance of responsibility and leadership.  David Arquette catches the free spirit, insipient laziness and romantic dreamer in Gus.The story of an ill-fated trek to wrest Santa Fe and thereby all of New Mexico from Mexico, becomes a hellish mess as one thing after another goes wrong, not the least of which is a determined Apache, Gomez, picking them off one by one.  And, there is yet a worst trek after their failure in Santa Fe, and that is the Dead Man's Walk of the title, lead by a resolute and unswayable Mexican Officer (Edward J. Olmos), with other surprises to come.If you liked Lonesome Dove, you will like this as well.  If you didn't like Lonesome Dove (more's the pity on you), better give this a pass.  4-1/2 stars.

Even without comparing this movie to Lonesome Dove, which would be blatantly unfair, it has plenty of shortcomings and it never quite grabs you like you hope. It is not a bad movie by any means, but it doesn't have the weight of the other Lonesome Dove movies.It would have been tough sledding trying to portray a young Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae, but the 2 actors were not up to the task. This is not a criticism of their acting, but they just weren't the right guys for the job. At times their acting was forced and awkward. Again, even without some unfair comparison to Lonesome Dove, these performances just weren't convincing and left the movie a little hollow.Fortunately, Call and McCrae are not central in this movie. They are the leads, but they do not carry the movie and there is enough going on that they are just 2 characters among many. The main plot was plenty good and was carried out successfully.

671284,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B00005O0SP,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[2, 3]","Back in the 1840's the State Texas was known as the Texas Republic, a harsh environment where several cultures clashed: Apache and Comanche, Anglos and Hispanics, for the most part, Mexicans. The battle over land, water and resources was furious, the spirit of these men as they set out to conquer, indomitable. The Texas Rangers were members of a law enforcement agency that investigated crimes from murder to political corruption, tracking fugitives and forging most important events in Texas history.In their early days, the Texas Rangers protected the frontier against Indian attacks on settlers, then serving as scouts, spies, couriers, and guides for those wishing to settle in the West. These men were trained to aim, fire and reload their weapons from horseback, an amazing development from the usual technique of dismounting before shooting at enemies and reloading.The story and subsequent sequels centers around two men, Augustus ""Gus"" McCrae and Woodrow Call. With each episode, we have seen three, the actors change as their characters age.Dead Man's Walk finds young Gus, played by David Arquette and Call, played by Johnny Lee Miller, as two young Texas rangers who set out to find adventure and soon make a life around this dangerous employment.Their purpose seems to capture Santa Fe and annex New Mexico, but the Mexicans fight them at every turn. Their group is led by a pirate who travels with its parrot on his shoulder, by the name of Caleb Cobb, played by F. Murray Abraham.There are many adventures, many encounters that will leave you spell bound as to the perils of life in the 1800's. The Apache encounters are magnificent, the violence sometimes brutal, but as with most westerners, we appreciated a view to a time when survival was a daily challenge.The Mexican Captain Salazar, played by Edward James Olmos, is cruel, dispassionate, but in time, develops great respect for the endurance of the Texas Rangers.

Guild,"[3, 3]","First of all ,it is worth taking the time to get the sequence sorted out.Lonesome Dove, was the first written in 1985 ,and took place in the the 1860's when Woodrow was at the height of his career.It was the followed with a sequel in 1993,and took place in the 1890's and when Woodrow was in the twlight of his career.Then Dead Man's Walk was published in 1995,as a prequel to Lonesome Dove and took place in the 1840's when Woodrow was about 20 and in his early days as a Texas Ranger.The main story is about an adventure ,a few years after the Alamo,when a force of about 100 leave Austin Texas,heading to Santa Fe ,to take this area from Mexico.What we see is McMurtry at his best with great storytelling,amazing characrer developments,with and brutal action with all sorts of opposition along the way.The story is packed with action and one suspensful and surprising event  following the last. Typically,when McMurtry gives us an epic,he starts off with a lot of people and characters of every description;and we witness the crowd being whittled down one by one in one gruesome scene after another.In the end, there are vew standing.Gus and Woodrow survive and become the main characters in the other novels.This novel had a great storyline,but not the high profile actors  we see in the others.The scenes and photography are outstanding and you get a good picture what it was like in the 1840's when the west was being wrestled from the Comanches, Apaches and Mexicans in Texas , Mexico and New Mexico.Personally, I prefer the movie versions these novels to reading the books,which I have also done.

671290,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005O0SP,Joseph Haschka,"[35, 41]","Back in 1989, U.S. television audiences were treated to LONESOME DOVE, perhaps the best miniseries ever made prior to the more recent BAND OF BROTHERS. I consider LONESOME DOVE the best western ever put on film. DEAD MAN'S WALK, aired several years later, is the prequel. STREETS OF LAREDO, which has also appeared on the small screen, is the final installment. All are screen adaptations of a trilogy of books written by Larry McMurtry.The purpose of DMW, besides being a story in its own right, is to establish the characters of the young Texas Rangers, Augustus ""Gus"" McCrae and Woodrow Call, here played by David Arquette and Jonny Lee Miller respectively. DMW is set in 1842, and Texas is still an independent Republic. In LD, set some thirty years later, Gus and Woodrow (Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones respectively), drive a cattle herd from Texas to Montana.DMW does a credible job molding the personalities of young Gus and Woodrow, whether they're beset by Commanches, Apaches, the Mexican Army, starvation, or imprisonment. Even love, for that matter. The viewer can see in them the men they're to become decades later.Whereas in LD McCrae and Call are the pre-eminent characters, in DMW the two are overshadowed by a large cast of more colorful personae. There are Shadrach (Harry Dean Stanton) and Bigfoot Walker (Keith Carradine), the grizzled mountain men. Then there's Mattie Roberts (Patricia Childress), the stout-hearted harlot nicknamed ""Great Western"", who accompanies the Texans' various expeditions into the hostile wilderness and, after a bath and fashion makeover, has a poignant self-revelation. F. Murray Abraham plays Caleb Cobb, a pirate turned soldier-of-fortune, who, with green parrot on his shoulder, plots the capture of Santa Fe from the Mexicans. And Lady Lucinda Carey (Haviland Morris), who, with a pet boa constrictor and a Lady Godiva-type ride, teaches Gus and Woodrow something about the nature of ""wildness"".DMW also introduces us to Clara (Jennifer Garner) and Maggie (Gretchen Mol), the former a shopkeeper's daughter, and the latter a working girl with a heart of gold. In LD, Clara (played there by Angelica Huston) is a major force in the film and McCrae's life. Maggie, on the other hand, has been dead several years by then, but her son, Newt, is a character perhaps third behind Gus and Woodrow.Unfortunately, DMW suffers from the comparison inevitably to be made with LD, and I'm sorry to award only three stars. LD moves along sprightly and is never dull. Its prequel makes the four and a half hour run time seem much longer. The characters expend too much effort literally walking their way into and out of tough spots. Both epics are notable for authentic period costuming and are faithful to the original novels. Unlike LD, on the other hand, the soundtrack of DMW is so nondescript that I didn't even notice it.If you're a LONESOME DOVE fan, DEAD MAN'S WALK needs to be seen for the sake of completeness.

671302,A13D1WTFEMS9VH,B00005O0SP,Scorpio69,"[1, 1]","First off, the title should tell you that the pacing and tone of this story is not swift and uplifting. It is brutal and grinding, so those who may have been expecting another LD experience were apparently disappointed. However, this is a very worthy story in its own right and is a way for us to understand the early years of Augustus McCrae and his true love, Clara Forsythe; and also the taciturn Woodrow F. Call and his relationship and feelings for Maggie.The storyline itself has already been recounted here, so no need to repeat. As far as the previous comment that the soundtrack was essentially dull and uninteresting, I disagree. I think it was beautiful. The filming was also very well done. I also think the two main stars did a creditable job in handling roles that were, let's face it, definitively portrayed by Duvall &amp; Jones in LD. Jennifer Garner as Clara was, as always, a pleasure to behold, and certainly she helped me understand McCrae's falling head-over-heels in love with her. In many ways, I think that on the whole the main supporting cast was better than in LD. Keith Carradine, Patricia Childress, Edward James Olmos, Harry Dean Stanton and F. Murray Abraham were all outstanding.I knocked this down to 4 stars because it ain't LD, so comparatively speaking it simply could not garner 5 stars. Also, there are a couple of glaring technical errors. At the end of Disc One, when the group is leaving the burying of some of their companions and about to embark on the Dead Man's Walk, the camera is on a wide shot and you can clearly see a very large vehicle(!) moving across a roadway on the horizon. This is unforgivable. Later, while wandering in a rainstorm, the huge stage fans used to whip the rain can easily be heard. Both of these flaws are so conspicuously and outrageously bad that  I'm surprised they weren't caught by the editor.All in all, though, Dead Man's Walk is a fine DVD and should be in any LD fan's collection.",4,A Worthy Prequel to 'Lonesome Dove',1080691200,"03 31, 2004",2004,1962,"['First', 'off', 'title', 'should', 'tell', 'pacing', 'tone', 'story', 'not', 'swift', 'uplifting', 'brutal', 'grinding', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'expecting', 'LD', 'experience', 'were', 'apparently', 'disappointed', 'However', 'very', 'worthy', 'story', 'own', 'right', 'way', 'understand', 'early', 'years', 'Augustus', 'McCrae', 'true', 'love', 'Clara', 'Forsythe', 'also', 'taciturn', 'Woodrow', 'F.', 'Call', 'relationship', 'feelings', 'Maggie.The', 'storyline', 'already', 'been', 'recounted', 'here', 'need', 'repeat', 'As', 'far', 'previous', 'comment', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'essentially', 'dull', 'uninteresting', 'disagree', 'think', 'was', 'beautiful', 'filming', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'think', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'did', 'creditable', 'job', 'handling', 'roles', 'were', 'let', 'face', 'definitively', 'portrayed', 'Duvall', 'amp', 'Jones', 'LD', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Clara', 'was', 'always', 'pleasure', 'behold', 'certainly', 'helped', 'understand', 'McCrae', 'falling', 'head-over-heels', 'love', 'many', 'ways', 'think', 'whole', 'main', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'better', 'LD', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'Patricia', 'Childress', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'were', 'outstanding.I', 'knocked', 'down', '4', 'stars', 'ai', ""n't"", 'LD', 'so', 'comparatively', 'speaking', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'garner', '5', 'stars', 'Also', 'are', 'couple', 'glaring', 'technical', 'errors', 'end', 'Disc', 'One', 'when', 'group', 'leaving', 'burying', 'companions', 'embark', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walk', 'camera', 'wide', 'shot', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'very', 'large', 'vehicle', 'moving', 'roadway', 'horizon', 'unforgivable', 'Later', 'wandering', 'rainstorm', 'huge', 'stage', 'fans', 'used', 'whip', 'rain', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'heard', 'flaws', 'are', 'so', 'conspicuously', 'outrageously', 'bad', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'were', ""n't"", 'caught', 'editor.All', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walk', 'fine', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'LD', 'fan', 'collection']",N/A
