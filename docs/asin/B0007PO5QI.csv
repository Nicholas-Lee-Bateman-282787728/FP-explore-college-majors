886966,A3VM2LLBUEAVE,B0007PO5QI,Bearfax,"[1, 1]","Cant help it. I'm a fan of Zena Henderson's people. They are lovely short stories with much allegorical messages entwined in quite charming stories about a species of humanoid refugees from a dead planet living Amish like existence away from population centres to avoid attention from a humanity that considered them spiritual demons and witches when they were initially revealed. But they are a gentle people who just want what we all want, a chance to live a satisfactory life raising their children.The movie grabbed a few of the ideas from the short stories and created a short cheapy staring Kim Darby and William Shatner, who had previously partnered up in the Star Trek Episode Miri. I am not making any comment about the quality of the DVD but only of the film, that seems to have been a telemovie made on a shoe string. And yet its a beautiful story that brings tears to the eye as a young despairing human school teacher gradually learns the secret of 'The People' and not only becomes accepted within the community but offers The People hope of acceptance eventually in a wider world.There is much to say about prejudice, fear of difference, jealousy and bigotry hidden in these stories. And there are no superhero battles, or flashy special effects. Just a lovely little story of loss and despair leading to hope, love, acceptance and a deeper appreciation of the treasure that is life.",3,People who need people,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,1398,"['Cant', 'help', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Zena', 'Henderson', 'people', 'are', 'lovely', 'short', 'stories', 'much', 'allegorical', 'messages', 'entwined', 'quite', 'charming', 'stories', 'species', 'humanoid', 'refugees', 'dead', 'planet', 'living', 'Amish', 'existence', 'away', 'population', 'centres', 'avoid', 'attention', 'humanity', 'considered', 'spiritual', 'demons', 'witches', 'when', 'were', 'initially', 'revealed', 'are', 'gentle', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'what', 'want', 'chance', 'live', 'satisfactory', 'life', 'raising', 'children.The', 'movie', 'grabbed', 'few', 'ideas', 'short', 'stories', 'created', 'short', 'cheapy', 'staring', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'William', 'Shatner', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'partnered', 'up', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Episode', 'Miri', 'am', 'not', 'making', 'comment', 'quality', 'DVD', 'only', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'telemovie', 'made', 'shoe', 'string', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'story', 'tears', 'eye', 'young', 'despairing', 'human', 'school', 'teacher', 'gradually', 'secret', ""'The"", 'People', 'not', 'only', 'becomes', 'accepted', 'community', 'People', 'hope', 'acceptance', 'eventually', 'wider', 'world.There', 'much', 'say', 'prejudice', 'fear', 'difference', 'jealousy', 'bigotry', 'hidden', 'stories', 'are', 'superhero', 'flashy', 'special', 'effects', 'Just', 'lovely', 'little', 'story', 'loss', 'despair', 'leading', 'hope', 'love', 'acceptance', 'deeper', 'appreciation', 'treasure', 'life']",N/A

I suspected I was in trouble when I opened my Amazon package and saw a plain plastic dvd container without any any printed cover.  The dvd was obviously copied directly from old film without any attempt to upgrade the images, which were washed out, grainy and slightly out of focus.  The sound track was out of sync for the second half of the drama.  I couldn't decide if the tempo of the drama was too slow because of the direction or because of the poor transcription.  I couldn't comment on the acting - that wouldn't be fair to the actors given the quality of the dvd.  The story was a mixing of several of Zenna Henderson's charming People stories.  I didn't mind that the stories were mixed up - I thought the script showed respect for Henderson's intentions in her stories.  I really think the manufacturers of this appalling dvd should be ashamed of themselves for offering it on the market.  I don't recommend it to any fans of Zenna Henderson - instead read her stories, now collected together in one volume, and available through Amazon.

I haven't been able to see it.  I find it in the reviews, however.  When I saw the picture of the box, one a VHS, the other a DVD, it never even occurred to me that I might get a cheapo-DVD.  After a quick visual inspection, I could tell I had a burned DVD (as opposed to pressed DVD -- this means it will develop errors in a very short few years -- perhaps two or three).  It came in a clear plastic cover with a label of people I've never heard before.  I called Amazon to see if it was a pirate.  They were clueless about it.  Also, I've got a beef with it having just one single chapter.  When using Roxio to create videos, well, enough said.  Even the more primative programs have a chapter making routing, which only takes an extra half hour.  As has been said, it's a VHS (low quality) transferred to a DVD probably, with one of those $50 machines.  I, too, wish that Mad Phat Enterprises and the now defunct? copyright holder Video Yesteryear, who I thought had the copyright until I saw on the Internet that it had gone under?, had made a better quality go of it.  I can't even find Mad Phat on the web now.  Maybe they've gone under, too.  Good grief!  If I could possibly get ahold of the original film, I could do a better job at it than they have, with the equipment I have.  As you can tell, I'm more than a bit angry about this.  Perhaps it's because it's the way one of my favourite movies has been treated.In spite of all that, I love this move as much now as I did when I saw it in 1976 as a ten year old child.  It is a very special movie.  I love the content of the story.  I love Zenna Henderson.  It can teach a person some very deep things about human relationships, about how special each person is, with his or her own gifts, what ""true gifts"" are.  About loving people who are not like one's self.  About how powerful we are as a people when we are united.  Religious convictions versus traditions.  And many many other things.  Very wonderful show.  Just try to look past the other problems.  They should be charging what it cost them to do the DVD plus a bit of profit, say $5, not a whopping $20!
