612493,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JM48,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 6]","I would first like to start this review with a warning.  This is not a romantic comedy, as you would probably presume by looking at the cover of this box.  That is what I thought when I first discovered this ""gem"" of a film.  I picked it up to enjoy with my wife, and strangely, I found myself enjoying it more than her.Without giving too much away (or more than already has by others), this is a twisted story where we, as viewers, have the opportunity to see the plot unfold from both of our main characters.  Audrey Tautou takes a devilishly good turn from her innocent character in Amelie to play an artist who falls in love ... or so we think.  As we watch her whirlwind romance with a married man hit their ups and downs like any normal relationship, we get comfortable and stable with the film ... then suddenly it changes.  We rewind backwards and are shown the story through the eyes of her ""boyfriend"".  Our image of this film enhances as we are handed the unexpected.This was a beautiful film.  From not only the cinematography, but also the characters and the story.  This was a rarity.  It is not often that you find a film of this caliber in today's modern cinema.  Normally, films have a very structured story with its theme defined early within the film.  Not this masterpiece.  If you assume that you know this film prior to finishing it, then you will be the laughing stock of the town.  I have seen several films in my lifetime, and I can honestly say that I never saw this story unfolding.  I was one of those that expected the beginning to be the entire story ... boy, was I surprised.Tautou carries this film on her bare shoulders.  She gives a stunning performance as a woman with a heart full of love for a man that she encounters.  Her turn from Amelie proves that she is a very versatile actor.  She emotionally pulls you from your seat and glues you to the screen.  Add to this the sheer brilliance of the story; with all of its twists and turns, and powerful cast that only accentuates Tautou's absurdity only helps propel this story from average to amazing.This is one of those films that I can watch time and time again without it loosing its appeal.  I would suggest it for anyone that has ever had a secret admirer.  For anyone that has obsessed over anyone from afar, this is the film for you.  A-la Sliding Doors, this film was impressive.Grade:  ***** out of *****",5,Petals from a flower...,1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,2399,"['would', 'first', 'like', 'start', 'review', 'warning', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'would', 'probably', 'presume', 'looking', 'cover', 'box', 'what', 'thought', 'when', 'first', 'discovered', 'gem', 'film', 'picked', 'up', 'enjoy', 'wife', 'strangely', 'found', 'enjoying', 'more', 'her.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'more', 'already', 'others', 'twisted', 'story', 'where', 'viewers', 'have', 'opportunity', 'see', 'plot', 'unfold', 'main', 'characters', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'devilishly', 'good', 'turn', 'innocent', 'character', 'Amelie', 'play', 'artist', 'who', 'love', 'think', 'watch', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'married', 'man', 'hit', 'ups', 'downs', 'normal', 'relationship', 'get', 'comfortable', 'stable', 'film', 'then', 'suddenly', 'rewind', 'backwards', 'are', 'shown', 'story', 'eyes', 'boyfriend', 'image', 'film', 'are', 'handed', 'unexpected.This', 'was', 'beautiful', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'cinematography', 'also', 'characters', 'story', 'was', 'rarity', 'not', 'often', 'find', 'film', 'caliber', 'today', 'modern', 'cinema', 'Normally', 'films', 'have', 'very', 'structured', 'story', 'theme', 'defined', 'early', 'film', 'Not', 'masterpiece', 'assume', 'know', 'film', 'prior', 'finishing', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'stock', 'town', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'films', 'lifetime', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'never', 'saw', 'story', 'unfolding', 'was', 'one', 'expected', 'beginning', 'be', 'entire', 'story', 'boy', 'was', 'surprised.Tautou', 'film', 'bare', 'shoulders', 'stunning', 'performance', 'woman', 'heart', 'full', 'love', 'man', 'turn', 'Amelie', 'very', 'versatile', 'actor', 'emotionally', 'seat', 'glues', 'screen', 'Add', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'story', 'twists', 'turns', 'powerful', 'cast', 'only', 'Tautou', 'absurdity', 'only', 'propel', 'story', 'average', 'amazing.This', 'one', 'films', 'can', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'loosing', 'appeal', 'would', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'ever', 'had', 'secret', 'admirer', 'anyone', 'obsessed', 'anyone', 'afar', 'film', 'A-la', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'film', 'was', 'impressive.Grade', '*****', '*****']","He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"

It starts all saccharine sweet with flowers, perky songs of Spring and love, and a smitten Audrey Tautou.It's all a great head fake.  As the film turns slowly, inexhorably darker and more malevolent, you're faced with the reality that your sweet little Amelie maybe isn't what she appears to be in this outing.  It's a great against-the-tide career choice by Tautou and the masterstroke of the trap Ms. Colombani's sets for her audience.Where Colombani's film elevates itself vs. others of this genre is in its unique, impressively designed story construction.  Others on these pages have alluded to the technique.  I'm not going to repeat it here.  It came as a surprise to me during my viewing, and it was like a special treat - my mouth dropped open suddenly as Colombani delivered her unexpected wallop.  Everyone deserves that pleasure.

612497,A95SF04RX9G8,B00005JM48,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[2, 3]","Sometimes in a romantic relationship, signals can get crossed, and one party ends up feeling differently about the other. He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not tells a two-sided love story: one of budding romance turning into neglect and one of mysterious obsession bordering on danger.Audrey Tautou stars as Angelique, an art student in love with the cardiologist Loic, who claims that he will leave his pregnant wife for her. She sends him little notes and leaves surprises at his office for him, and he, in turn, plans to take her on a trip to Florence.However, strange things start happening: Angelique gets in a moped accident; Loic's wife gets in a fight with him and leaves, after having a miscarriage; a woman accuses Loic of assault and battery, then mysteriously dies of a heart attack the very same night. And we begin to think that maybe Angelique isn't seeing this relationship the same way that Loic is.The film does a magnificent job of showing the two sides to this story, and it becomes more involving as each scene plays out. About halfway through, the entire story gets rewound and told from a different perspective, and subverts everything that has gone before. For those afraid of foreign films, this would be an excellent entry-level one to get you going. It proceeds at a brisk pace and the storytelling never skips a beat.

Hamlow,"[3, 5]","L, is for the way you look at me...A La Folie...Pas Du Tout, or roughly translated, Madly...Not At All-- is one story but with two different POV's.  First, we see things from the point of view of lovable Angelique, an art student who's on the way up.  She's won the Hanska Scholarship to an art academy, which is a big foothold to gaining artistic fame.  She is also minding a large house for the Dubois-Lollins while they are off to Washington.  And yes, those charming smiles that won audiences heart when she did Amelie are in plain evidence here.  The song &quot;L.O.V.E.&quot; by Nat King Cole, played as her song, is a soothing remedy for what lies ahead.O. is for the only one I see...However, she has a crush on a handsome blond cardiologist named Loic Le Garrec, who happens to be married to a lawyer.  She believes that he will leave her and marry her.  She seems oblivious to the attentions of fellow student David, who's in love with her and waiting in the wings.  According to her, she got a rose from him, which she sends him in memory of how they first met.  She keeps sending him notes, and also a birthday gift and makes dinner plans for his birthday, only to be stood up.  A dream trip to Florence ends up with her waiting at the aeroport till closing.  She's totally heartbroken and cuts back and forth between scenes of her running to exhaustion along the barred gate of his house to her angrily destroying photos, shredding a wedding dress, etc.  She is ready for a new start until something happens that brings back her feelings for him, and that takes her down a darker path.V is very very extraordinary...Well, from Angelique's POV, Loic is painted as quite a cad, someone who used and dumped her.  But from Loic's POV, we see a different picture of him, as he is a dedicated cardiologist who loves his wife Rachel.  He is however, beset by an unreliable receptionist Anita, who messes up his schedule among other things until she is fired and burned out by incessant patients complaining of heart maladies.  He is actually clueless to the situation: who sent him the rose, the notes, the present?  There are some things that neither she nor the viewer doesn't know about from her POV, but when the viewer sees them, it's an &quot;Oh, I see&quot; situation, where the gaps to the half-complete story is told.  And his wife is actually loving and devoted, though naturally suspicious, especially as the notes tell Loic that Rachel won't keep them apart.Another technique that makes this film work wonders is the occasional brief loopbacks into the past that fill in missing information, which is a result of wrongly drawn conclusions, and other times, tarnishes Angelique's image.E is even more than anyone that you adore...Audrey Tautou is best known on these shores as Amelie.  Angelique is Amelie gone down a self-destructive path.  My mother, known my deep fondness for Amelie, told me stay away from this film lest the ideal I built around Tautou be crushed, yet I find her performance winning, making her a capable actress.  However, not much info is given on Angelique's childhood.  Apart from the Mr. Cat doll she made out of string, buttons, and fuzz, there isn't much to go on.  What else about her upbringing made her this way?The quote shown at the ending not only reflects how Angelique felt but is a note of hope for those lonely romantics leaning towards self-destruction:  &quot;Though my love is insane, my reason calms the pain in my heart.  It tells me to be patient and keep hoping.&quot;",4,A heartbreaking story of a love gone insane,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,3531,"['L', 'way', 'look', 'La', 'Folie', 'Pas', 'Du', 'Tout', 'roughly', 'translated', 'Madly', 'Not', 'one', 'story', 'two', 'different', 'POV', 'First', 'see', 'things', 'point', 'view', 'lovable', 'Angelique', 'art', 'student', 'who', 'way', 'up', 'won', 'Hanska', 'Scholarship', 'art', 'academy', 'big', 'foothold', 'gaining', 'artistic', 'fame', 'also', 'minding', 'large', 'house', 'Dubois-Lollins', 'are', 'Washington', 'yes', 'charming', 'smiles', 'won', 'audiences', 'heart', 'when', 'did', 'Amelie', 'are', 'plain', 'evidence', 'here', 'song', 'quot', 'L.O.V.E.', 'quot', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'played', 'song', 'soothing', 'remedy', 'what', 'ahead.O', 'only', 'one', 'see', 'However', 'crush', 'handsome', 'blond', 'cardiologist', 'named', 'Loic', 'Le', 'Garrec', 'who', 'be', 'married', 'lawyer', 'will', 'leave', 'marry', 'oblivious', 'attentions', 'fellow', 'student', 'David', 'who', 'love', 'waiting', 'wings', 'According', 'got', 'rose', 'memory', 'how', 'first', 'met', 'sending', 'notes', 'also', 'birthday', 'gift', 'dinner', 'plans', 'birthday', 'only', 'be', 'stood', 'up', 'dream', 'trip', 'Florence', 'up', 'waiting', 'aeroport', 'till', 'closing', 'totally', 'heartbroken', 'cuts', 'back', 'forth', 'scenes', 'running', 'exhaustion', 'barred', 'gate', 'house', 'angrily', 'destroying', 'photos', 'shredding', 'wedding', 'dress', 'etc', 'ready', 'new', 'start', 'something', 'back', 'feelings', 'down', 'darker', 'path.V', 'very', 'very', 'extraordinary', 'Well', 'Angelique', 'POV', 'Loic', 'painted', 'quite', 'cad', 'someone', 'who', 'used', 'dumped', 'Loic', 'POV', 'see', 'different', 'picture', 'dedicated', 'cardiologist', 'who', 'wife', 'Rachel', 'however', 'beset', 'unreliable', 'receptionist', 'Anita', 'who', 'up', 'schedule', 'other', 'things', 'fired', 'burned', 'out', 'incessant', 'patients', 'complaining', 'heart', 'maladies', 'actually', 'clueless', 'situation', 'who', 'sent', 'rose', 'notes', 'present', 'are', 'things', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'know', 'POV', 'when', 'viewer', 'quot', 'Oh', 'see', 'quot', 'situation', 'where', 'gaps', 'half-complete', 'story', 'told', 'wife', 'actually', 'loving', 'devoted', 'naturally', 'suspicious', 'especially', 'notes', 'tell', 'Loic', 'Rachel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'keep', 'apart.Another', 'technique', 'film', 'work', 'wonders', 'occasional', 'brief', 'past', 'fill', 'missing', 'information', 'result', 'wrongly', 'drawn', 'conclusions', 'other', 'times', 'tarnishes', 'Angelique', 'image.E', 'even', 'more', 'anyone', 'adore', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'best', 'known', 'shores', 'Amelie', 'Angelique', 'Amelie', 'gone', 'down', 'self-destructive', 'path', 'mother', 'known', 'deep', 'fondness', 'Amelie', 'told', 'stay', 'away', 'film', 'lest', 'ideal', 'built', 'Tautou', 'be', 'crushed', 'yet', 'find', 'performance', 'winning', 'making', 'capable', 'actress', 'However', 'not', 'much', 'info', 'given', 'Angelique', 'childhood', 'Apart', 'Mr.', 'Cat', 'made', 'string', 'buttons', 'fuzz', ""n't"", 'much', 'go', 'What', 'else', 'upbringing', 'made', 'way', 'quote', 'shown', 'ending', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'Angelique', 'felt', 'note', 'hope', 'lonely', 'romantics', 'leaning', 'towards', 'self-destruction', 'quot', 'Though', 'love', 'insane', 'reason', 'calms', 'pain', 'heart', 'be', 'patient', 'keep', 'hoping.', 'quot']","He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"

612501,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005JM48,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[7, 7]","This French film starring Audrey Tautou of ""Amelie"" fame begins as  though a predictable romance about a charming young and talented artist who throws away her life while waiting for her married lover.  Angelique is madly in love with Loic (Samuel Le Bihan), a cardiologist whose lawyer-wife is pregnant.  Viewers recognize Loic as the typical lout, the man who wants both the comfort of married life and the thrill of an affair  - and who, when pushed, will always choose his wife.  Angelique is so taken with Loic that she fails to recognize the devoted love of her friend, the cute medical student David (Cl&eacute;ment Sibony).  Partway through, however, just as the viewer has settled into it, the story twists upon itself - and ""He Love Me, He Loves Me Not"" becomes a completely different film.Audrey Tautou plays the waif-like Angelique with such charm and energy that her performance adds another layer to what happens.  Viewers watching this film more than once (as many will want to) will see how her acting hints at what will transpire.  A lesser actress might have performed the role as though there were two separate movies, but Tautou remains true to her character, even if the viewer cannot know what that means.  The rest of the cast is competent, with only Sibony and Isabelle Carr&eacute;, as Angelique's friend Rachel, standing out.  Like ""Amelie"", this is a star vehicle for Tautou, although viewers familiar with the earlier film will be surprised to see that Angelique is nothing like Tatou's earlier role.Viewers who like conventional filmmaking might not be as taken with this film as will those who like a little oddity in their stories.

He Loves Me Not was written/ directed by Laetitia Colombani and starred Audrey Tautou. It was made right after 'Amelie' and it looks like 'Amelie', especially in the opening scenes on the beautiful and colorful streets of Bordeaux that prepare a viewer for the light romantic story. Young and pretty Art student Angelique (Audrey Tautou) seems to have found her fabulous destiny and the love of her life in Laic, a cardiologist (Samuel Le Bihan) who seems to be as much in love with her as she is with him. But is he? And what about his wife who is pregnant with their first child? Step by step, the film takes an interesting turn and becomes a story rather dark and disturbing, told from different perspectives, Rashomon - style. What started as a light and sweet romantic comedy, very successfully turned into a well made thriller. The way the young writer/director presented and contrasted two points of view at the same events, is remarkable. We all know from Geometry classes that parallel lines never cross, at least in Euclid's Geometry they don't but sometimes when you look at the lines in space from certain POV, it looks like they cross - I kept thinking about it while watching He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not which I highly recommend.

My wife and I loved it.Audrey Tatou, the effervescent and funny-faced do-gooder of AMELIE, plays Angelique, a talented French art student in the throes of an affair with eminent cardiologist Loc (Samuel Le Bihan), who's two-timing his pregnant wife Rachel (Isabelle Carre). The film's very first scene shows Angelique amidst the blooms in a flower shop picking out the single, perfect rose for her beloved. (Hold this image!) Angelique dreams of having Loc for herself, but feels threatened by Rachel's pregnancy. Then, in short order, Rachel miscarries after being accidently struck by a motor scooter, and then has a serious falling out with her husband. Angelique is elated, and readies herself for a getaway to Florence with newly unencumbered lover. But, after Loc stands her up at the airport, Angelique wallows in the wrath of a woman scorned. Then, one of Loc's female patient's charges him with assault. Fiercely possessive even now, Angelique takes drastic action. However, after Rachel, a lawyer, comes to her estranged husband's aid, Angelique realizes that she's lost him forever and commits suicide by gassing herself with the kitchen oven.Have I spoiled the plot? Ah, think again! As Angelique's EKG flatlines, the movie literally fast reverses to the opening scene at the florist and another story begins.Ms. Tatou again shows herself as the worthy successor to the delightful Audrey Hepburn. But if you're a male who, like me, wanted to take her AMELIE character home to meet Mom, perhaps you should rethink. And Le Bihan is excellent as the heartless cad. Or is he? (A cad, that is.)Not since Nicole Kidman's THE OTHERS (2001) have I seen such a fiendishly clever use of misdirection and altered perspective. HE LOVES ME, HE LOVES ME NOT is a deliciously wicked black comedy. And you'd be surprised how prescription drugs can be utilized as an artist's medium.

612520,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005JM48,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[7, 14]","Audrey Tatou has a smile that could melt anyone's heart, and even when she plays an obsessed psychotic, you can't help but fall in love with her (even if her antics scare you to death). Tatou plays Anjelique, a French student who thinks she is in love with a married doctor, Loic (Samuel Le Bihan of ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""), whose wife (Isabelle Carre) is pregnant. The first half of the story follows Angelique's attempts to get Loic to leave his wife and run away with her to Florence. When she is stood up, Anjelique begins to go a bit ""nuts"". Then, the perspective shifts, and we see the previous events through Loic's eyes, and the story seems quite different, as we see Angelique's ""love"" more strongly resembling a dangerous obsession.An edge-of-the-seat thriler with touches of light comedy and numbing romance, ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is the perfect vehicle for Tatou. She has a wicked glint in her angelic eyes that usually read as something mischievous but, in a darker context, can be extremely unsettling.The film begins as lightly as a bubbly French farce, but abruptly turns into a scary essay of madness and murder, with Tautou at its deadly center. Everything depends on whether Angelique is actually involved with Loic or is a prisoner of her own delusions. The second part of the film replays many of the events we've already seen, but from Loic's perspective, which is quite different from Angelique's. For him, there is no affair, nothing but a sometimes pesky little neighbor he barely knows, part of a life now puzzlingly falling apart.Which is the truth? By the end, director Laetitia Colombani clearly reveals what's going on. But she also demonstrates how dreams can consume us and quickly take over our reality.This is a surprisingly smart, engrossing and ambitious film by a first time director that displays superstar Tautou's gifts in an eerie new light and brims with intense suspense. Not as scary or funny as it could have been, but a truly enjoyable thriller that had me captivated from first frame to last. ""He Loves Me, He Loves me Not,"" plays like a French ""Fatal Attraction,"" with a few bonus twists and surprises. Tatou and Le Bihan have great on-screen chemistry, turning this charming romance into a mind-numbing psychological puzzler.",4,"Light as bubbly, deadly as murder!!!!",1045440000,"02 17, 2003",2003,2286,"['Audrey', 'Tatou', 'smile', 'could', 'melt', 'anyone', 'heart', 'even', 'when', 'obsessed', 'psychotic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'even', 'antics', 'scare', 'death', 'Tatou', 'Anjelique', 'French', 'student', 'who', 'love', 'married', 'doctor', 'Loic', 'Samuel', 'Le', 'Bihan', 'Brotherhood', 'Wolf', 'wife', 'Isabelle', 'Carre', 'pregnant', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'Angelique', 'attempts', 'get', 'Loic', 'leave', 'wife', 'run', 'away', 'Florence', 'When', 'stood', 'up', 'Anjelique', 'go', 'bit', 'nuts', 'Then', 'perspective', 'shifts', 'see', 'previous', 'events', 'Loic', 'eyes', 'story', 'quite', 'different', 'see', 'Angelique', 'love', 'more', 'strongly', 'resembling', 'dangerous', 'obsession.An', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'thriler', 'touches', 'light', 'comedy', 'numbing', 'romance', 'Me', 'Not', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Tatou', 'wicked', 'glint', 'angelic', 'eyes', 'usually', 'read', 'something', 'mischievous', 'darker', 'context', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'unsettling.The', 'film', 'as', 'lightly', 'bubbly', 'French', 'farce', 'abruptly', 'scary', 'essay', 'madness', 'murder', 'Tautou', 'deadly', 'center', 'Everything', 'Angelique', 'actually', 'involved', 'Loic', 'prisoner', 'own', 'delusions', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'many', 'events', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Loic', 'perspective', 'quite', 'different', 'Angelique', 'affair', 'nothing', 'sometimes', 'pesky', 'little', 'neighbor', 'barely', 'part', 'life', 'now', 'puzzlingly', 'falling', 'apart.Which', 'truth', 'end', 'director', 'Laetitia', 'Colombani', 'clearly', 'what', 'going', 'also', 'how', 'dreams', 'can', 'consume', 'quickly', 'take', 'over', 'reality.This', 'surprisingly', 'smart', 'engrossing', 'ambitious', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'superstar', 'Tautou', 'gifts', 'eerie', 'new', 'light', 'brims', 'intense', 'suspense', 'Not', 'scary', 'funny', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'thriller', 'had', 'captivated', 'first', 'frame', 'last', 'Me', 'Not', 'French', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'few', 'bonus', 'twists', 'surprises', 'Tatou', 'Le', 'Bihan', 'have', 'great', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'turning', 'charming', 'romance', 'mind-numbing', 'psychological', 'puzzler']","He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"
612521,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JM48,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is a clever French film that begins as a romance and ends up as a thriller. I personally like this kind of story, in which nothing you see at the beginning is what it seems. [The most famous example, perhaps, is Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""] While this movie might prove too deceptive and cynical [or even a bit cruel] for some viewers, I think it wll prove rewarding for those who like films that `think outside the box'.The movie begins much like any standard romance. Angelique [Audrey Tautou], a promising young artist, is madly in love with Loic [Samuel Le Bihan], a successful cardiologist. She sends some flowers and a painting she did to his office to show her affections. She is house sitting for a family who has gone away for a year. Her life seems almost perfect until it dawns on her that the doctor doesn't keep the promises he makes to her - he doesn't show up for dates, he refuses to leave his wife, etc. Slowly, she sinks into a depression. She later plots her revenge against her `unfaithful' man. But what is really going on between these two? To say more would be to ruin the story.Tautou is the French actress who charmed audiences around the world a while back as ""Amelie"". Here, she proves she is more than a big smile, wide eyes and an odd hairdo; in fact, she looks completely different. She is a most accomplished actress. Samuel Le Bihan is first rate as the object of her affection.The movie is in French with English subtitles.

This movie illustrates that point quite well.""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" begins with a young woman, Angelique (Audrey Tautou), picking out the ""perfect rose"" as a gift for her lover. He is  Loic (Samuel Le Bihan), a cardiologist who happens to be married. Loic promised Angelique that he was going to leave his pregnant wife, in order to be with her. Despite that, he doesn't do so, behaving like a total cad regarding both his wife and Angelique. We get to know all that as we watch what happens, from Angelique's perspective.But is that true?. Or it depends on the point of view of the person who is telling the story?. The spectator will have the opportunity of finding out, because midway through the movie the director (Laetitia Colombani) changes tracks, ""rewinds"" the story and begins to tell it from Loic's  point of view. We learn, once again, that things are not always what they seem to be.All in all, I really liked this movie. It certainly wasn't what I expected, but some surprises are good, and this is one of them. After all, there are a lot of good romantic comedies, but not so many movies that start like light romances and end up as more or less dark suspense thrillers.

I also liked her in A Very Long Engagement. I borrowed this from a friend, as I hadn't seen it yet, but then I took ages to get around to watching it.During the first forty minutes of this film, you will consider switching it off. It's very strange. For starters, the boyfriend appears as a jerk, yet Ang&eacute;lique seems completely besotted, dare I say it OBSESSED, despite the fact he's not only married, and as a child on the way, but seems to treat her with nothing but contempt. And he barely speaks in the first forty minutes. It's a whirlwind romance, and things seem to be happening way too fast.Don't touch your remotes when it starts ""rewinding"" itself though, this is a very clever thing. The film actually switches points of view, from Ang&eacute;lique to Loc, the boyfriend, played by Samuel Le Bihan, who was also in Brotherhood Of The Wolf.It's quite a twisted plot, and I really don't want to give too much away in this review. Even from reading the blurb on the back, you don't expect He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, to unfold the way it does. It does invite comparisons to Fatal Attraction, but it's a lot cleverer than that. It's also the French version of Sliding Doors I guess, it has a couple of similarities in it.However, it does drag out just slightly too long. When everything is on the screen in front, you're nodding, and waiting for it to end. But it doesn't. I actually ended up hating the Ang&eacute;lique character, and the mood I was in as well, did not help. Samuel Le Bihan does play a brilliant character, although it was kinda irritating in the first forty minutes how he didn't have anything lines to say. The second half is where he comes through.Looking at stuff on IMDB, it's quite interesting, as one reviewer described it, as how the different titles in different countries, are literally ""lost in translation"". The French title translated straight into English is ""Passionately... not at all"" - the first half from Ang&eacute;lique, the second half from Loc. But the full phrase is actually ""il m'aime a la folie, il m'aime pas du tout"", which means ""he loves me, a little, a lot, passionately, crazily (insanely), not at all"". The German title is ""Wahnsinnig verliebt"", which means ""crazily in love"".I'm not sure if I would ever watch this again, it is a very strange film, but it's definitely worthwhile picking up on the cheap.

Audrey Tautou played her perfectly and when things started to not go her way in the love affiar, I thought that she was a bit naive, but I genuinely felt bad for her....however, halfway into the movie, the entire story folds in on itself and rewinds to the opening scene only to follow her lover the cardiologist instead of Angelique,whom we stayed with the entire first half of the movie.What an eye opener.Suddenly, everything that you have belived is not so clear anymore and I found my self feeling more and more revolted as things came to light.I dont want to give too much away, because it would surely spoil it for those who have yet to see it.

612536,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005JM48,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[5, 7]","I believe if I should die,And you should kiss my eyelids when I lieCold, dead, and dumb to all the world contains,The folded orbs would open at thy breath,And, from its exile in the isles of death,Life would come gladly back along my veins.From Creed by Mary Ashley TownsendWhen Plato said: ""Love is a grave mental illness,"" he might have been referring to obsessive love. The type of passion that turns you into a prisoner of your own desires. It is the type of passion that can an almost become a ""possessive force"" in your life, so strong, nothing else seems of importance in comparison to the object of your desires.It is difficult to write about ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not,"" without revealing the sheer uniqueness of this fascinating movie. It will not only appeal to the detective in you, it is almost a study of obsessive love as a sport.The story is set in the city of Bordeaux. French art student, Angelique (Audrey Tautou), is in love with Loc (Samuel LeBihan), who is a cardiologist. The director went out his way to connect Angelique's heartfelt longings for the doctor with his profession and also seems to have a deep understanding of Greek Mythology.We find Angelique in love with Loc, a handsome man of high social status. She is in turn being loved by a younger man named David, who seems much more compatible. He is her obvious admirer and knight in shinning armor.Her obsession with the older and more affluent Loic does not allow her to appreciate David's care and admiration. Instead, she seems to show an unsympathetic and almost careless attitude towards David as she also continues to show her loving, yet slightly vindictive side towards her ""true love."" Like many women who stay with men who treat them badly, Angelique seems to feed off Loc's abuse. Or is he really the abuser?When Angelique receives an art scholarship she is told she will have to follow the rules and create 15 paintings. However, the only thing she seems to want to create are paintings of Loc. The word ""mosaic"" takes on new meanings. The main problem with their ""relationship"" is that Loc is married and his wife is pregnant. As Angelique writes a warning across Loc's car windshield, we start to realize the darkness of her obsession. She has a very evil side and while we want to love this mischievous little creature, we realize she is a danger, even to herself.When her small income from her waitressing job does not allow her to shower her true love with presents, she starts to find other ways of feeding her obsession. Her love grows to such proportions, she is finally willing to steal to show Loc the depth of her love.The visual metaphors are worth looking for and contemplating on future viewings. Feeling ""devastated,"" ""uprooted,"" and ""unsettled"" are presented as the outer representation of Angelique's inner world. If you loved Amelie, this movie has much to offer. There are unique moments of stunning beauty, like the storm at the airport symbolizing the inner torment Angelique is feeling. There are also subtle undercurrents and even when a moped and a bike start at the same time and move in different directions, there is a deeper meaning.Look at how ""the angel Angelique"" becomes Eros when she puts an arrow through a heart. Yet, instead of rising from Chaos into a situation of unconditional love on the light side, she seeks to create more destruction and enters the dark hallways of unrequited love. While she strives for the ""the pure, the good and the beautiful,"" her love takes on a much more sinister aspect. She not only desires, she seeks to control this world she has created.Even if there was no story at all, I could watch Audrey Tautou in a trance. She is just fascinating in the same way Audrey Hepburn's screen presence can keep your attention for hours. I kept forgetting to watch the subtitles and spent a lot of time rewinding! Audrey Tautou has a magic that is all her own and her radiance takes all forms. One moment she is dreamily peering out from behind hundreds of roses and then I was surprised at the rather demonic look in her eyes as she peers through the blue gate. She seems to excel in roles displaying the vulnerability of love and near insanity of unrequited love.""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is a story of a young girl's infatuation with an older man, yet there is a more subtle erotic and vindictive twist. This movie turns from romance to thriller in the most intriguing way. The cinematic beauty is a visual paradise and the metaphors, dark comedy and detective work will intrigue your mind. This is a thriller, a comedy and a romance.A must-see for all Audrey Tautou fans! If you loved ""The Others,"" this movie will also intrigue you. Throughout the movie, Tautou seems to mostly be wearing a ruby top and purple pants. She is often set against red backgrounds with red couches and the colors in this movie are just stunning. She looks lovely trying on a wedding dress or just looking through travel brochures. I am impressed with every moment of her acting.I am only left wondering if a few capsules of DL-Phenylalanine could have prevented such agony of the soul or was Angelique's search for the ""love high"" the very cause of her fantasy or ""divine"" madness? Only one man has the key to Angelique's heart. Laetitia Colombani has created a journey that will keep your attention right to the end... twice!~The Rebecca Review",5,A French Tale of Obsessive Love,1065398400,"10 6, 2003",2003,5388,"['believe',

612538,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JM48,Samuel McKewon,"[5, 5]","In facial drama Audrey Tautou owns a controlling interest. While ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" is a romantic comedy that completely eludes and subverts expectations, Tautou plays right into them as an elfin, perky doer of progressively bad deeds, and thus does much of the eluding and subverting.Tautou is Angelique, and the name doesn't just sound like ""Amelie;"" she's the same prototype: A cute, lonely, falsely chipper waitress prone to mysterious notes and objects of affection, in this case a cardiologist, Loic (Samuel Le Behan). And director Laetitia Colombani does indeed begin the film as a lighthearted, meet sweet romp through Paris. It is everything but.Quickly - and directly - Angelique's motives begin to unravel. She claims to be having an affair with Loic, and she claims his wife, Rachel (Isabel Carre) is merely trying to ensnare him with a pregnancy. But Angelique seems more wishful than involved. Then wishful becomes obsessive. Then dangerous - when Loic fails to show at the airport for a getaway to Florence, Italy, Angelique is more than crushed, forcing her two best friends (Clement Sibony and Sophie Guillermin) into criminal compromises. A third through the film, after Angelique has caused enough damage for two or three fatal attractions, we see her committing suicide.Then ""He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not"" does a daring, clever thing: It rewinds itself to the very beginning and shows all the same events from the perspective of Samuel, who, it becomes clear, does not really know Angelique. Nor does he know who is suddenly mailing him paintings and gifts. The movie's second half is not so much a revelation - although we learn how two events (Samuel's arrest and Rachel's miscarriage) came to occur - as an accumulating, suspensful dread. What a pox Angelique has put on this man's life.The grinning, smirking villain, Tautou is excellent - as distraught here as she was resilient in ""Amelie."" A fine line separates the two characters and Tautou walks it, subtly changing her body language and trademark pouts beyond curiousity and playfulness. It is not reinvention but rearrangement, and it is as hard as method acting, and the mark of a star who can pull it off. Notice how Angelique sits - slumped, a knuckle resting immaturely between her open legs. Or her sudden smile-to-frown moments around Loic. Though we begin to suspect an unhealthy romance, Angelique's pathology resonates better in Samuel's section of the movie.

If you're going in expecting this to be a fluffy romance-comedy about two lovers who keep missing each other due to circumstance, be prepared for a huge shock halfway into the film. This film is not what it appears to be (no thanks to other reviewers who have spoiled it), and even after you know the whole story it still works well as a romantic thriller (and how many films do we know that fit into that genre?).Of course the cruel-yet-fun thing to do would be to pass it off as a romantic comedy to your significant other, then watch their mouths slowly fall open in shock as the story reveals itself.

612541,A1YRYWY01L9BZ6,B00005JM48,SORE EYES,"[0, 1]","**Spoiler Alert**Let start out by saying that this movie struck me the wrong way because I was expecting a comedy. He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, is clever and well done, but it is definitely not funny.Audrey Tatou plays Angelique-an art student carrying on a passionate affair with a married cardiologist, Loric, played by Samuel Le Bihan. Or so the viewer is led to believe. For the first half hour of the film we see Angelique buying her lover roses, meeting her lover in the bathroom for an illicit rendevous, and walking with him through the gardens of Bourdeaux. Audrey Tatou plays Angelique in her cute elfin cum ingenue way-laughing and joking with her friends about her affair. I thought this was a romatic comedy in the style ofPriceless.And then things rewind and we witness the scenes from Loric's point of view. To make a long story short, Angelique is a complete nutcase and the whole affair is entirely in Angelique's head. Angelique is following Loric to the bathroom so that it looks like they are having a rendevous.  She is planning romantic trips to Florence and he ... doesn't even know her. It gets very dark when we find that Angelique has run over Loric's wife with her moped and killed their baby.The plot of He Love Me... caught me off guard. It's not that it was bad, but there was something disturbing about Audrey Tatou's perky personality against the backdrop of this disturbing film. Imagine casting Aubrey Hepburn inFatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)and having her act like she's still inBreakfast At Tiffany's - Paramount Centennial Collection. In the end the disconnect between the personality and the plot adds to the idea that the whole thing is in Angelique's head because she is not reacting with the reality around her. But it throws the viewer for a loop.A good thriller and a thousand times better than the trite and contrived Fatal Attraction.

The way the film is shifting from one situation to another is well done and gives the film a nice and solid look. It is all very colorful and well edited. Also the music fits the film and brings a strong atmosphere to live.Audrey Tautou shows that she is a great actress and can play different roles perfectly. She is totally believable and acts convincing. Samuel Le Bihan as Loc was also a fine casting choice. He fits the role magnificently and plays the doctor in an also convincing way. You will feel for the characters.What can I say, just see this film. It is surely one of the most surprising films I have ever seen. It's absorbing.
