21433,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0767837363,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 9]","It is beginning to get harder and harder to decipher cinema fact and fantasy, or should I say non-fiction versus fantasy.  With the summer's largest box office possible relying on the fantastical, it is always a relief of fresh air to pick up a film that relies on human drama and realistic elements to pull you in.  That is why I was excited to pick up the French film ""La Vie Revee Des Anges"" (or ""The Dreamlife of Angels"") because I was up for a moment of drama mixed in with the hardships of reality - and - it garnered numerous awards for its two leading actors, so why not - I would like to see ""Spiderman 3"" garnish such acknowledgments.  So I jumped in, head first, and nearly hurt myself in the process.  Alas, for nearly two hours I watched this film, with no excitement, no true drama, and no honest explanation of any kind.  We were sucked in to watching two unknowns, not to the film world, but to each other in this film, walk through situations without any remorse, reason, or logic.  Then, as the final credits begin to roll, with the final (and only shock) behind us, the realization that another tale of fantasy just passed through the DVD player begins to settle.  This was not a film of drama, but of coincidence, chance, and absurdities.Oddly, as you look at prior reviews for this film, there are many that speak very highly about this film.  Not surprisingly, I cannot see why.  It is French, which shouldn't garnish the praise just because it is in a different language (at times, foreign language films get praise for just being foreign), the story itself is as bland as white bread with butter, and finally our two main characters bring nothing refreshing to the table.  ""La Vie Revee Des Anges"" transforms before your eyes into an over-hyped sub-par film about the French depression and the absurd nature of the woman's choice.  As you can see, I had trouble with this film.  I didn't know what to expect when it began, but I wanted to be impressed.  I wanted to see phenomenal acting coupled with a story that best represented the imaginative title, but alas, nothing of the sort occurred.  Here is what I saw for nearly 113 minutes:  a homeless woman travels through France cheating some out of their money.  She happens to find work at a sewing factory, but ends up loosing her job - not before she meets Marie, a woman of the same vein, who become closer friends.  I would argue that a friendship does not blossom, but instead two people searching for something different happen to stay under the same roof.  The homeless woman, Isa, convinces Marie that she can say, and the two attempt to share the times of their lives.  Surprisingly, they share different values and visions, so when two men enter their lives, they react differently.  Then, when a random third enters, he is used to gain sympathy and skewed views from the audience.  He is the flint to this fire, but again, it just doesn't gain enough flame.  In the end, an event occurs that is meant to shock and evoke tears, but between the lines of boredom, it just garnishes a yawn followed by excitement that the ending credits were drawing near.I don't want to sound too pessimistic about this film, it had potential.  I think director Erick Zonca can control his actors as well as give us haunting images, but when handed a struggling story, it is obvious that he cannot maintain.  My biggest issue with this film is that random events occurred to two complete strangers.  There was a point in this film where Zonca attempted to connect Isa and Marie as ""friends"", but as the film continues, I can never see them as such.  These two women, prior to working at the same place, never knew each other, yet instantly they were to live together and have a connection.  Suddenly, they are ""dating"" two men, and anger ensues when a third becomes a part of the picture.  We were missing some scenes in between that would allow us to see a stronger connection.  We needed to see conflict and resolution prior to the ending, or perhaps a stronger story about both of them prior to their first meeting to really have us understand these two.  I was bored, these characters brought nothing to the table.  Randomly, near the center of the film, Isa begins to visit this other complete stranger - of which Zonca immediately demands that we feel sympathy for.  What this film transforms into is Zonca throwing random events, that with strengthening stories, would cause any audience member to tear up, but there isn't time for the details, so we eventually ... hum ... get lost in translation.I think our two actresses would have been strong contestants in this film, had the story not been in shambles.  I cannot fault the actresses, though a stronger voice between them would have been helpful.  Marie's love interest falls prey again to someone who we, as an audience, don't know anything about.  The brief snippets of information that we are handed in this film, does not give us enough to make our own judgment.  He is portrayed, wrongly in my eyes, as the villain, but for me, it was just another case of not knowing enough to make the assumption.  This is the argument that I have with the relationship between Isa and Marie.  We don't know enough, they don't know enough about themselves to really pass judgment. When Marie makes the choice to be with the more dominate male in the film, Isa passes judgment - how could she?  Did she know enough about the past of Marie or Marie in general to do so?  I think not, how could she, we didn't get that satisfaction.  So, this annoyed me throughout the film.  Characters I didn't even know well enough, were passing judgment on others that nobody new well enough.  It was rather embarrassing.Overall, I focused mainly on the characters of this film as my most irritable moment because I wanted to like these Isa and Marie, but not enough was given to us for anyone to relate to the realizations or hardships.  I agree that quite a bit of poverty was happening in France during this time, but again, Zonca could have established this a bit further with a bit more detail.  Detail was the lacking element which lead to the downfall of this film.  The moments with Isa and Marie could have been heightened with more detail, the scenes with Isa in the hospital could have been more developed, and the final scene could have had such a delivered impact if only we cared.  I didn't care about Isa or Marie by the end, and that is why I am bitter about the film.  The French have made such amazingly strong films, that this one came as a surprise.  I cannot suggest it - nor shall I.Write that in your diary, Isa!Grade: ** out of *****",2,"Write that in your diary, Isa!",1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,6660,"['beginning', 'get', 'harder', 'harder',

It might seem kinda slow and boring at first but the storyline sorta sneaks up on you.  The title refers to how Marie (Natacha Regneir) percieves Isa(Elodie Bouchez) as a dreamer when they first met.  This is just one of the misconceptions on the characters' part and also the audience because you'd think that the quite, unassuming Marie is the smarter and wiser of the two while Isa the drifter is a luckluster gad about.  As the story unfolds, Marie is the dreamer who thinks a rich club owner would love her and take her away from her miserable life.  Isa, the more realistic and sensible of the two tries to steer Marie away from her fantasies ""you're probably not the only one, he's treating you like a common dog.""

21441,A6ADO7B6FUVN,0767837363,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 1]","Dreamlife of Angels has much in common with Agn&egrave;s Varda's film Vagabond (1985), where a woman is drifting trying to find her place in society through others, as well as Rosetta (1999) where a young girl in a socioeconomic struggle attempts to find a home and security.  Despite the similarities, Dreamlife of Angels offers a unique cinematic experience as it depicts two twenty-something women living on the fringe of society while trying to find a job and companionship.  The story dissects the friendship that develops between the two young women as they meet different people and share their thoughts, feelings, and roofs with one another.&Eacute;lodie Bouchez provides the audience with an authentic portrayal of Isa, a homeless, kind, and thoughtful young woman.  &Eacute;lodie shared the Best Actress Award with Natacha R&eacute;gnier who performed as Marie.  Marie is a restless, rigid and lonely soul in her twenties, who has a constant need to feel desired.Isa arrives to Lille with her backpack and sleeping bag covered with the dust and dirt from the long road that she has traveled.  Cold and hungry Isa finds out that the friend that she was to stay with is no longer in Lille.  In a desperate attempt to make some money for food she makes some cards that she tries to sell to people pretending it is for a good cause.  Through her endeavor with the cards she meets a Serbian immigrant that offers her a job as seamstress through which she meets Marie (Natacha R&eacute;gnier).  Isa quickly identifies herself with Marie whom eventually offers her to stay with her in an apartment which she is house-sitting.On the second day of working as a seamstress Isa is fired for making a mess and when Marie hears about it she impulsively quits too.  This begins a dreamlike period in the two girls lives where they do not bother about financial needs or responsibilities, which leaves them with just having fun together.  However, they eventually notice people around are having money and there is a fiscal responsibility that people have in society.  This is a lesson that was taught to them through a bouncer that reminds them that people must pay for tickets as that pays the musicians, the stage crew, and his salary, which are needed to pay the bills.  Yet, the two girls are caught up in the no responsibility attitude, which leads their friendship into a crossroads where their differences accentuate.Marie begins to form relationships with men in order to find her way into an easy lifestyle, while Isa slowly embarks on her own problems through a diary that she discovers.  In essence, Marie and Isa are two opposite characters as Marie extrinsically seeks comfort and security from men who provide what she needs, which ends up becoming a dangerous emotional turmoil.  Isa on the other hand searches for comfort intrinsically through the journal which she learns belongs to the girl in whose room she is staying.  The differences also appear on the screen through the dark haired Isa's big smile and kindness while the blond Marie projects a self-centered and pessimistic attitude in everything she says.The handheld camera work that Erick Zonca employs in Dreamlife of Angels provides an authentic atmosphere, as there is no trick photography, no filters to enhance the mood, and no special effects, which only leaves the characters to their actions and their lines.  This cinematic minimalism enhances the realism as it brings a raw and untouched visual experience to the audience.  Vagabond and Rosetta use the same technique to capture the same mood, as Zonca does, as he simply captures the moments between Isa and Marie.

21442,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,0767837363,Marc Cabir Davis,"[6, 7]","This is the sort of film people like me wait for. Its absolutely compelling, gripping stuff, and only France could make something this touching. Starring Elodie Bouchez in perhaps her most well-etched role yet (I found her turn in 'Wild Reeds' beautiful, but not as complex as the character here), this film will dazzle you and leave you feeling empty inside.The story revolves around Elodie and her new-found friend played by Natacha Regnier. The two are camping out at a house that Natacha is keeping for its only remaining owner - a girl who is in coma after an accident. The character study in this movie is bloody brilliant. First theres Elodie, the mousy, sweet-hearted girl who will do any odd job to get through life. Then theres Natacha, an empty, unloved woman who is so insecure in her body that she finds it hard to hold on to her self.The story follows Natacha's involvement with a handsome French-Algerian club owner (played by Gregoire Colin) and how this love affair propels her into madness. The relationship the two friends share as they hurl towards the film's unforgattable climax forms the crux of the movie, and it is not one that you will soon forget. I don't want to give too much away, but I left this film feeling that life was ultimately pointless, and it seems that the film-makers are driving home this point. The chilling end with Elodie at another mind-numbing workplace gave me a sense that cinema has now come to fully embrace the bleak, stark quality of real life. This is not escapist cinema, but celluloid's brutal look at real life and its traps and snares. Not a pretty picture at all, but I loved how the film made a statement without being clear in its' intent.Elodie and Natacha both won Best Actress trophies at the Cannes Film Festival in 1998 for their roles in this film. Gregoire Colin soon gained fame and supermodel status in France and Germany after the release of this movie and its a pity hes not doing more with his talent. Elodie Bouchez will remind you of Audrey Tatou who played Amelie Poulain in the recent 'Amelie'. However, she is less saccharine and more down to earth than that heroine. I found her performance rivetting - its also very interesting in the way she finds time to bond with the girl in a coma, yet unwittingly neglects to help her living friend who is hurtling toward her own demise. This is a movie chockful of interpretations and little nuances and observations, and if you're a true lover of art house cinema as I am, 'Le Vie Revee des Anges' is a cause for real celebration. One of the best French films I've seen in recent times.Highly recommended. If you like this, check out 'Les parapluies de Cherbourg', 'Wild Reeds', 'Ma Saison Preferee' and 'Va Savoir'.
