Over six original episodes the audience became transfixed by the nuances of gay and lesbian culture unknown to most. Davies went on to resurrect the modern Doctor Who and penned its offshoot, Torchwood, set in his native Cardiff, Wales, with a bisexual hero, Capt. Jack Harkness (John Barrowman).Season two was limited to only two episodes and ends with the U.K. guys in their Jeep CJ literally, magically transported to the American West as it became known that there would be a U.S. version of QAF to be based in working-class Pittsburgh (but filmed in Canada) on Showtime. (Good as the lengthy U.S. series was, it did not star an underaged schoolboy and lacked the edge of the Davies show.) Also, Hunnam seemed to be wearing a wig in season two which was not becoming.The U.K. series was originally shown in the U.S., and DVDs distributed at high prices, by a small, gay cable network, making it inaccessible to most. Some of us with multi-region players ordered the box set from the U.K. Like the Robin of Sherwood series, Acorn Media has done the U.S. audience a great service bringing another great, five-star BBC series to the U.S., even if belatedly.",5,"Russell T Davies' Original QAF, Still the Best",1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,1807,"['Using', 'pun', 'Yorkshire', 'phrase', 'nought', 'queer', 'folk', 'similar', 'Pennsylvania', 'Dutch', 'saying', 'world', 'queer', '[', 'odd', ']', 'thee', 'sometimes', 'think', 'little', 'queer', 'also', 'Russell', 'T', 'Davies', 'caused', 'ruckus', 'U.K.', 'overnight', 'first', 'episode', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'when', 'unapologetic', 'inexperienced', 'under-the-age-of-consent', 'gay', 'youth', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'way', 'Canal', 'Street', 'working-class', 'Manchester', 'equivalent', 'Christopher', 'Street', 'NYC', 'predatory', 'gay', 'Lothario', 'Aidan', 'Gillan', 'taking', 'home', 'most', 'graphic', 'gay', 'sex', 'ever', 'seen', 'telly', 'six', 'original', 'episodes', 'audience', 'became', 'transfixed', 'nuances', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'culture', 'unknown', 'most', 'Davies', 'went', 'resurrect', 'modern', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'penned', 'offshoot', 'Torchwood', 'set', 'native', 'Cardiff', 'Wales', 'bisexual', 'hero', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'John', 'Barrowman', '.Season', 'two', 'was', 'limited', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'U.K.', 'guys', 'Jeep', 'CJ', 'literally', 'magically', 'transported', 'American', 'West', 'became', 'known', 'would', 'be', 'U.S.', 'version', 'QAF', 'be', 'based', 'working-class', 'Pittsburgh', 'filmed', 'Canada', 'Showtime', 'Good', 'lengthy', 'U.S.', 'series', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'star', 'underaged', 'schoolboy', 'lacked', 'edge', 'Davies', 'show', 'Also', 'Hunnam', 'seemed', 'be', 'wearing', 'wig', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'not', 'becoming.The', 'U.K.', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'U.S.', 'DVDs', 'distributed', 'high', 'prices', 'small', 'gay', 'cable', 'network', 'making', 'inaccessible', 'most', 'multi-region', 'players', 'ordered', 'box', 'set', 'U.K.', 'Robin', 'Sherwood', 'series', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'done', 'U.S.', 'audience', 'great', 'service', 'bringing', 'great', 'five-star', 'BBC', 'series', 'U.S.', 'even', 'belatedly']",QUEER AS FOLK: THE COMPLETE U.K. COLLECTION

1444060,A8E1J9IDU18V9,B0056G1APC,Garth R. Mailman,"[1, 2]","Set in Manchester it showed on BBC 4 in England. The first surprise is that it lasted only a two seasons. Having watched the version shot in Toronto, Canada that lasted 6 full seasons I was a bit disappointed having missed the part about it being only three disks.The series covers a lot of the same territory as it's American mirror but the action is much telescoped lacking a great deal of the exposition given in the subsequent edition. The Lesbians have the baby Stuart fathered in the first half hour. Vince is his faithful side-kick who works in a grocery store and lives with a Mother who affirms his lifestyle choices and has a male boarder/friend. Charlie Hunnam plays teenage Nathan Stuart's young stalker who is still in highschool or 6th Form and has a faithful female friend. Charlie is just growing into the stunningly handsome hunk he will become in later years.Vince has a female employee who has an eye for him. He is not `out' at work. Stuart drives a company car, a Jeep which is vandalized by young homophobes. The nature of Stuart's executive position is not immediately apparent. It rapidly becomes apparent that the American version picked up a lot of the same themes but enjoyed the luxury of giving them much greater development. All the characters we see live the same promiscuous gay lifestyle shown in the American Version. They engage in heavy petting and man on man action complete with foreplay. The British Midlands lingo takes some getting used to.I watched this because I wanted to see the series that inspired the American Edition. This is no show for homophobes or rednecks but if you can get by the explicit sex in the end `Folk' is about 29-year-olds coping with settling down, making commitments, and getting on with their lives.",4,See the original that inspired the NA Version,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,1768,"['Set', 'Manchester', 'showed', 'BBC', '4', 'England', 'first', 'surprise', 'lasted', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'Having', 'watched', 'version', 'shot', 'Toronto', 'Canada', 'lasted', '6', 'full', 'seasons', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'having', 'missed', 'part', 'being', 'only', 'three', 'disks.The', 'series', 'lot', 'same', 'territory', 'American', 'mirror', 'action', 'much', 'telescoped', 'lacking', 'great', 'deal', 'exposition', 'given', 'subsequent', 'edition', 'Lesbians', 'have', 'baby', 'Stuart', 'fathered', 'first', 'hour', 'Vince', 'faithful', 'side-kick', 'who', 'grocery', 'store', 'Mother', 'who', 'lifestyle', 'choices', 'male', 'boarder/friend', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'teenage', 'Nathan', 'Stuart', 'young', 'stalker', 'who', 'still', 'highschool', '6th', 'Form', 'faithful', 'female', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'just', 'growing', 'stunningly', 'handsome', 'hunk', 'will', 'become', 'later', 'years.Vince', 'female', 'employee', 'who', 'eye', 'not', 'out', 'work', 'Stuart', 'company', 'car', 'Jeep', 'vandalized', 'young', 'homophobes', 'nature', 'Stuart', 'executive', 'position', 'not', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'rapidly', 'apparent', 'American', 'version', 'picked', 'up', 'lot', 'same', 'themes', 'enjoyed', 'luxury', 'giving', 'much', 'greater', 'development', 'characters', 'see', 'live', 'same', 'promiscuous', 'gay', 'lifestyle', 'shown', 'American', 'Version', 'engage', 'heavy', 'petting', 'man', 'man', 'action', 'complete', 'foreplay', 'British', 'Midlands', 'lingo', 'getting', 'used', 'to.I', 'watched', 'wanted', 'see', 'series', 'inspired', 'American', 'Edition', 'show', 'homophobes', 'rednecks', 'can', 'get', 'explicit', 'sex', 'end', 'Folk', '29-year-olds', 'coping', 'settling', 'down', 'making', 'commitments', 'getting', 'lives']",QUEER AS FOLK: THE COMPLETE U.K. COLLECTION
1444061,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0056G1APC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[55, 56]","In 1999, TV wunderkind Russell T. Davies (who went on to re-imagine and reinvigorate the Dr Who franchise and its various sequels including Torchwood) presented a truly audacious new show that took the United Kingdom by storm.  Taking on Manchester's lively gay scene, ""Queer as Folk"" startled with its aggressive and unapologetic tone and created one of the most maddening TV antiheroes that you're likely to encounter.  Telling the story of best friends Stuart (Aiden Gillen), a consummate player, and Vince (Craig Kelly), his loyal sidekick--the narrative was trailblazing in its frankness and presented an in-your-face and visceral experience.  Lives were further complicated when Stuart picked up an underage one night stand (Charlie Hunnam) who soon ingratiated himself into the central relationship.  Davies' screenplay uses scathing wit to delineate the complicated bonds of friendship and the responsibilities inherent in sticking with pals who present themselves as virtually unlovable.But despite becoming a cultural phenomenon, the original ""Queer as Folk"" never got an official U.S. release.  Yes, the show did inspire Showtime's five season hit of the same title.  If you watched the American version, the early episodes adhere closely to Davies' vision (although with some of the underage controversy tamped out).  But through the years, both fascinating and frustrating, the American version clearly took on its own identity by necessity.  But, for my money, if you haven't seen the originator--this is a can't miss proposition.  Over ten years ago (before the Showtime series), I purchased the DVDs from the international marketplace.  And the experience of watching this show initially is something that I'll never forget--that's how confrontational the show can be.  Now, with this belated release, I hope many more will be able to tune in to this wildly exciting program.IMPORTANT:  Beware, however, of the Complete Series label.  Series One consists of only eight episodes (about 240 minutes total), while Series Two is only two episodes (about 90 minutes).  If you're expecting something comparable to an American season, you might be disappointed at content length--so I wanted to issue an advance warning.  There are, however, over 130 minutes of bonus material planned that includes deleted and extended scenes with commentary, a ""What the Folk...?"" feature, various interviews, trailers, photo galleries, and a 20-page booklet with notes by series creator and writer Russell T. Davies.The show won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Drama TV Show and star Gillen picked up well deserved BAFTA nomination as best lead actor.  Gillen has since done some great things on American TV (The Wire and Game of Thrones) while Hunnam currently headlines Sons of Anarchy.  This is a chance to get a peak back at some of their best work.  Of course, this program is graphic in terms of language and nudity--don't think I have to mention that, but just in case you are completely unaware of what this is!  A true classic that paved the way for more explicit, more frank, and more honest gay entertainment--this allowed a full bodied portrayal of real guys that was alternately identifiable, repugnant, hysterical, brutal, and (most importantly) human.

1444064,A224BKBLXVA859,B0056G1APC,Rocky Sunico,"[0, 0]","I can't get away from comparing this to the US incarnation of the show since I had watched that first. A lot of the initial plot points are the same. We have Nathan on his first night in the scene and managing to attract the attention of the older and much more confident Stuart. There's the mad scramble to the hospital to be there for the birth of Stuart's son born out of his sperm donated to lesbian friends. And all that cool stuff. But at the same time things are pretty different.I'm going to break my usual rule on comparing different adaptations of a work to one another since it's the easiest way for me to contextualize my experience of watching this show given how much of my gay life had been shaped by the US version of the show. There was the eerie feeling of things being out of phase or something like that despite familiar plot points and character personalities. And as you get through things, it'll be worth the overall pseudo strangeness of it all.Biggest shift - the drama is in the right place. The stories are focused, rather plot-driven with decent development for our three protagonists. This is not a larger ensemble piece that the US sort of became over time - they kept the cast pretty focused in that regard. And when I say the drama is in the right place, I mean that they don't have to much filler drama going on.Nathan as the young gay man isn't as annoying as his US counterpart. Sure, he still makes stupid decisions and he's prone to through little tantrums here and there. But he learns the rules of the street soon enough and he doesn't spend all of his time pining over Stuart. After getting burned a few times, he learns to become his own man, and that's great. And I bring this up right off the bat since the Brian-Justin relationship in the US QAF was one of the more annoying plots that became horribly central to the show.And yes, he was the lead in Pacific Rim. Totally.Stuart is still a self-assured, arrogant, and manipulative man who can get practically whatever he wants. At times the extent of his influence can be pretty scary, but we learn to understand a bit of why he is the way he is in the show. Plus there's actual merit to his way of dealing with the world, as evidenced by those odd instances with other friends approach Stuart for help with one delicate piece of business or another. At the end of the day he gets things done.But the real clever dynamic exists between Stuart and Vince and their odd friendship / almost-romance. We all know that Vince clearly pines for the guy but contents himself with just being around for him almost all the time. And we also see that Stuart is clearly dependent on Vince as well given he's the first person that he calls whenever there's a spot of trouble.I appreciated how the show took things to their more logical (and sometimes dire) resolutions based on the events. It's not all that depressing, but it also doesn't tint your view of their world with shades and blinders. Instead we have a rather practical, matter-of-fact representation of their lives and a good taste of what they're experiencing.And in the language of the show, the ending was &#34;a little bit camp&#34;, but it still worked for the whole narrative.Queer as Folk has a great story, and one that is the start of this series more than anything else. If you want more pointless drama, you can go back to the US version if that's more to your tastes.",4,A classic in its own right.,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,3420,"['ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'comparing', 'US', 'incarnation', 'show', 'had', 'watched', 'first', 'lot', 'initial', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'same', 'have', 'Nathan', 'first', 'night', 'scene', 'managing', 'attract', 'attention', 'older', 'much', 'more', 'confident', 'Stuart', 'mad', 'scramble', 'hospital', 'be', 'there', 'birth', 'Stuart', 'son', 'born', 'sperm', 'donated', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'cool', 'stuff', 'same', 'time', 'things', 'are', 'pretty', 'different.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'break', 'usual', 'rule', 'comparing', 'different', 'adaptations', 'work', 'one', 'easiest', 'way', 'contextualize', 'experience', 'watching', 'show', 'given', 'how', 'much', 'gay', 'life', 'had', 'been', 'shaped', 'US', 'version', 'show', 'was', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'things', 'being', 'phase', 'something', 'familiar', 'plot', 'points', 'character', 'personalities', 'get', 'things', ""'ll"", 'be', 'overall', 'pseudo', 'strangeness', 'all.Biggest', 'shift', 'drama', 'right', 'place', 'stories', 'are', 'focused', 'rather', 'plot-driven', 'decent', 'development', 'three', 'protagonists', 'not', 'larger', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'US', 'sort', 'became', 'time', 'kept', 'cast', 'pretty', 'focused', 'regard', 'when', 'say', 'drama', 'right', 'place', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'filler', 'drama', 'going', 'young', 'gay', 'man', ""n't"", 'as', 'annoying', 'US', 'counterpart', 'Sure', 'still', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'prone', 'little', 'tantrums', 'here', 'there', 'rules', 'street', 'soon', 'enough', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'pining', 'Stuart', 'getting', 'burned', 'few', 'times', 'become', 'own', 'man', 'great', 'bring', 'up', 'right', 'bat', 'Brian-Justin', 'relationship', 'US', 'QAF', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'annoying', 'plots', 'became', 'horribly', 'central', 'show.And', 'yes', 'was', 'lead', 'Pacific', 'Rim', 'Totally.Stuart', 'still', 'self-assured', 'arrogant', 'manipulative', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'practically', 'times', 'extent', 'influence', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'scary', 'learn', 'understand', 'bit', 'why', 'way', 'show', 'actual', 'merit', 'way', 'dealing', 'world', 'evidenced', 'odd', 'instances', 'other', 'friends', 'approach', 'Stuart', 'help', 'one', 'delicate', 'piece', 'business', 'end', 'day', 'things', 'done.But', 'real', 'clever', 'dynamic', 'Stuart', 'Vince', 'odd', 'friendship', '/', 'almost-romance', 'know', 'Vince', 'clearly', 'pines', 'guy', 'contents', 'just', 'being', 'around', 'almost', 'time', 'also', 'see', 'Stuart', 'clearly', 'dependent', 'Vince', 'well', 'given', 'first', 'person', 'whenever', 'spot', 'trouble.I', 'appreciated', 'how', 'show', 'took', 'things', 'more', 'logical', 'sometimes', 'dire', 'resolutions', 'based', 'events', 'not', 'depressing', 'also', ""n't"", 'tint', 'view', 'world', 'shades', 'blinders', 'Instead', 'have', 'rather', 'practical', 'matter-of-fact', 'representation', 'lives', 'good', 'taste', 'what', ""'re"", 'experiencing.And', 'language', 'show', 'ending', 'was', '34', 'little', 'bit', 'camp', '34', 'still', 'worked', 'whole', 'narrative.Queer', 'Folk', 'great', 'story', 'one', 'start', 'series', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'want', 'more', 'pointless', 'drama', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'US', 'version', 'more', 'tastes']",QUEER AS FOLK: THE COMPLETE U.K. COLLECTION

That show was called ""Queer as Folk"" and ran for a successful five seasons and aired 83 episodes. What many don't know is that the series was actually based on a British series, also called ""Queer as Folk"", but that was more like a mini-series because it only ran for 8 episodes back in 1999 and then it returned to UK television for 2 more episodes so the writers could wrap things up.Now the Russell T. Davies' original series comes back to DVD in a complete series set featuring all 10 shows plus a slew of bonuses on 3 dics. What's amazing about the UK series is how closely the writers and producers of the American version followed the plots of the original during its first year on the air. While watching you will have no trouble believing who Brian was based on or Michael for that matter. My only problem with the British version is the dialect, but that passes within moments of the first show.The bonuses include deleted and extended scenes with commentary, a featurette, interviews, trailers, and a 20 page booklet written by Davies.
