976774,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000EQ5TQ0,A Customer,"[7, 9]","Before The Fall is a handsomely mounted and tastefully directed German production that is part World War 11 melodrama and part sociopolitical comment on the evils of national socialism. It's set in a world where brutality and nascent viciousness go hand in hand and where any sign of empathy or compassion is interpreted as a sign of weakness.The story is relatively simple. Set in 1942, a young and naive German boy by the name of Friedrich (Max Riemelt) decides to rebel against his parents and takes up a scholarship at a Napola - a prestigious school for the training of Hitler youth. A talented boxer, Friedrich has been admitted mostly for his skills in the rink.He also comes from a working class family and his father is severely anti-Nazi, but the young man is determined to go the school, seeking a secure future beyond the drudgery of working in his family's factory. Forging his father's signature, he steals off into the night and marches naively into the orifice of evil.Initially, the seventeen-year-old is enamored by the stirring speeches, energetic anthems and boyish camaraderie, and his imagination is totally inspired by the Nazi's penchant towards advocating strength and greatness and crushing those whom they see as weak.Fr&eacute;idrich quickly adapts to the militaristic life of the school, until he meets the bookish and sensitive Albrecht (Tom Schilling), the son of a wealthy Nazi governor. Albrecht rebels against his father's brutal ideology, suffering the bullying and the taunting, but things reach a climax when the boys are forced to hunt down a group of escaped Russian prisoners. The incident forces Friedrich to see the truth of his own situation and to see the Nazi dogma for what it really is - a world devoid of humanity.Obviously the strength of Before the Fall is its way of showing how these boys where brainwashed and how the Nazi philosophy, based on Nietzsche's concepts, permeated every aspect of their daily lives. As a boxer Friedrich perhaps embodies everything the National Socialist movement inspires to be, after all, boxing is a brutal and uncompromising sport, which is probably why Albrecht's father takes to him so readily whilst intent to spurn his own son.Director Dennis Gansel does a good job if subtly showing how the philosophy of purity and strength espoused by the Nazi fanatics, is subtly undermined by these two boys. Friedrich's eventual growth involves his realization that the Napola is not what it's cracked up to be, that beneath the master-race hype and rigors of study and military training, the school is in fact just a center for the training of ill-educated bully boys.My one problem with this film is that there isn't much of a definitive plot. Once Freidrich gets to the school, the narrative tends to be made up of a series of loosely connected incidents involving abuse and sadism, without anything to really tie it all together.Obviously the bond between Friedrich and Albrecht eventually becomes the centerpiece of this icy drama. But after revealing the upsetting and fanatical side of the Nazi machine, the director allows the story to slide into relationship bathos, and the movie - to its detriment - becomes a rather empty collection of Napola abuses and mishaps.

It was around in popular culture back in the late '60s and early '70s when John Lennon was perhaps the best-known antiwar activist and the Vietnam conflict was looking increasingly like a lost cause at least among thinking people.  My best friend and I went to the local draft board and succeeded in being recognized as conscientious objectors.  Could I have done that without him?  I don't know.  Could we have done it if it was not somewhat fashionable?  Probably not.I was reminded of that while watching this beautiful film.  How difficult would it have been to resist the Nazis as a young boy in 1942, when this film is set?  The protagonist, Friedrich, is a working class kid who now has his big chance to enter the elite of the Third Reich as a star boxer while attending an elite academy.  He's handsome, Aryan-looking, and athletic, but early in the film he shows another side.  That side is developed when he meets Albrecht, a slight, somewhat effeminate boy who is the son of a top Nazi official.I read some other review where this film has been marketed as a ""gay"" movie. That's ridiculous.  Albrecht is not depicted as being gay; he is depicted as being smart and caring.  His stature and appearance simply serve to explain in part the contempt his father has for him as being weak.  He is a little weak in some ways, and that is part of why Friedrich protects him, or tries to.  But this film, like the best anti-Nazi movies, accurately shows who the really weak were--those who went along to get along or to get ahead.There are a number of films in this genre that I like, including ""Europa, Europa"", ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", and one that really needs to be re-issued on DVD (and I am not sure if it was ever on VHS) called ""Blood and Honor"".  But this one is easily in that class.This film should be required viewing in high school classrooms. Some of us grew up with such weak anti-Nazi movies as ""The Sound of Music"", where the kinds of moral conflicts treated here were trivialized.  We don't see the death camps in this movie, but that is part of its power.  Albrecht sees just a glimpse of what he is in to and what his father is part of and there are several scenes showing that.This is a fairly long film at 110 minutes.  If I were asked how it could be improved, I might suggest adding more.  There is not a dull moment.  A terrific film that you should not miss.",5,Brilliant study of courage and redemption in the Nazi era,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2453,"['Remember', 'saying', 'What', 'gave', 'war', 'nobody', 'came', 'was', 'around', 'popular', 'culture', 'back', 'late', ""'60s"", 'early', ""'70s"", 'when', 'John', 'Lennon', 'was', 'perhaps', 'best-known', 'antiwar', 'activist', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'was', 'looking', 'increasingly', 'lost', 'cause', 'least', 'thinking', 'people', 'best', 'friend', 'went', 'local', 'draft', 'board', 'succeeded', 'being', 'recognized', 'conscientious', 'objectors', 'Could', 'have', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Could', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'not', 'somewhat', 'fashionable', 'Probably', 'not.I', 'was', 'reminded', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'film', 'How', 'difficult', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'resist', 'Nazis', 'young', 'boy', '1942', 'when', 'film', 'set', 'protagonist', 'Friedrich', 'working', 'class', 'kid', 'who', 'now', 'big', 'chance', 'enter', 'elite', 'Third', 'Reich', 'star', 'boxer', 'attending', 'elite', 'academy', 'handsome', 'Aryan-looking', 'athletic', 'early', 'film', 'side', 'side', 'developed', 'when', 'Albrecht', 'slight', 'somewhat', 'effeminate', 'boy', 'who', 'son', 'top', 'Nazi', 'official.I', 'read', 'other', 'review', 'where', 'film', 'been', 'marketed', 'gay', 'movie', 'ridiculous', 'Albrecht', 'not', 'depicted', 'being', 'gay', 'depicted', 'being', 'smart', 'caring', 'stature', 'appearance', 'simply', 'serve', 'explain', 'part', 'contempt', 'father', 'being', 'weak', 'little', 'weak', 'ways', 'part', 'why', 'Friedrich', 'tries', 'film', 'best', 'anti-Nazi', 'movies', 'accurately', 'who', 'really', 'weak', 'were', 'who', 'went', 'along', 'get', 'along', 'get', 'ahead.There', 'are', 'number', 'films', 'genre', 'like', 'including', 'Europa', 'Europa', 'Au', 'Revoir', 'Les', 'Enfants', 'one', 'really', 'be', 're-issued', 'DVD', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'ever', 'VHS', 'called', 'Blood', 'Honor', 'one', 'easily', 'class.This', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'high', 'school', 'classrooms', 'grew', 'up', 'such', 'weak', 'anti-Nazi', 'movies', 'Sound', 'Music', 'where', 'kinds', 'moral', 'conflicts', 'treated', 'here', 'were', 'trivialized', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'death', 'camps', 'movie', 'part', 'power', 'Albrecht', 'just', 'glimpse', 'what', 'what', 'father', 'part', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'showing', 'that.This', 'fairly', 'long', 'film', '110', 'minutes', 'were', 'asked', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'improved', 'might', 'suggest', 'adding', 'more', 'not', 'dull', 'moment', 'terrific', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'miss']",Napola 2004  AKA Before the Fall

976777,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000EQ5TQ0,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[5, 7]","In the German-made ""Before The Fall (NaPolA)"" (2004), set in 1942, Friedrich Weimer is a young man of lower working class parents whose boxing ability catches the eye of a visiting officer from a NaPolA, a training academy for elite Hitler youth. Defying his father to accept the invitation to attend the NaPolA, Friedrich learns to supress any hint of pity or humanity in his boxing, which is encouraged to an extreme degree in the competition against similar insitutions, in line with the Aryan supremacy propoganda that is part of his daily education. He does make one close friend, Albrecht, a somewhat bookish classmate who happens to be the son of the local military government official. Albrecht has already become somewhat disenchanted with the ""win at all costs"" mindset at the school, obviously designed to turn them into unquestioning fighters for the accelerating war. At first, Friedrich questions his friend's seeming disloyalty, but, after an incident in which the class is brought out into the forest to help capture (and shoot)a group of young and unarmed escaped POWs, he also rebels against the prevailing Nazi mindset, in two especially stunning scenes in the final half hour of the film.In German with English subtitles, very easy to follow. Winner of several awards for photography, direction and acting (the handsome and very talented Max Riemelt, who played the physically and emotionally demanding role of Friedrich), the film has no real gay content (I didn't notice any ""gay vibes"" in Friedrich and Albrecht's friendship, but it is being marketed as gay interest in the US), although lots of eye candy and significant homoerotic imagery. The acting, photography, direction, and musical score are all excellent, as are even the DVD extras (A lengthy and informative ""Making of"" featurette, interviews in English with the director and star Riemelt during the film's US premiere in NYC, deleted scenes, a toryboard/film comparison and two trailers.) Contrary to some negative reviews, calling it ""the Nazi 'Dead Poet Society'"", I really thought it was an exceptional effort (which I award five stars out of five), and especially a must-see for those interested in that infamous period in history.Official site (English):[...]",5,"Epic, well-made coming-of-age film set in Nazi Germany",1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,2249,"['German-made', 'Fall', 'NaPolA', '2004', 'set', '1942', 'Friedrich', 'Weimer', 'young', 'man', 'lower', 'working', 'class', 'parents', 'boxing', 'ability', 'eye', 'visiting', 'officer', 'NaPolA', 'training', 'academy', 'elite', 'Hitler', 'youth', 'Defying', 'father', 'accept', 'invitation', 'attend', 'NaPolA', 'Friedrich', 'supress', 'hint', 'pity', 'humanity', 'boxing', 'encouraged', 'extreme', 'degree', 'competition', 'similar', 'insitutions', 'line', 'Aryan', 'supremacy', 'propoganda', 'part', 'daily', 'education', 'make', 'one', 'close', 'friend', 'Albrecht', 'somewhat', 'bookish', 'classmate', 'who', 'be', 'son', 'local', 'military', 'government', 'official', 'Albrecht', 'already', 'become', 'somewhat', 'disenchanted', 'win', 'costs', 'mindset', 'school', 'obviously', 'designed', 'turn', 'unquestioning', 'fighters', 'accelerating', 'war', 'first', 'Friedrich', 'questions', 'friend', 'seeming', 'disloyalty', 'incident', 'class', 'brought', 'out', 'forest', 'help', 'capture', 'shoot', 'group', 'young', 'unarmed', 'escaped', 'POWs', 'also', 'prevailing', 'Nazi', 'mindset', 'two', 'especially', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'film.In', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'Winner', 'several', 'awards', 'photography', 'direction', 'acting', 'handsome', 'very', 'talented', 'Max', 'Riemelt', 'who', 'played', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'demanding', 'role', 'Friedrich', 'film', 'real', 'gay', 'content', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'gay', 'vibes', 'Friedrich', 'Albrecht', 'friendship', 'being', 'marketed', 'gay', 'interest', 'US', 'lots', 'eye', 'candy', 'significant', 'homoerotic', 'imagery', 'acting', 'photography', 'direction', 'musical', 'score', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'even', 'DVD', 'extras', 'lengthy', 'informative', 'Making', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'English', 'director', 'star', 'Riemelt', 'film', 'US', 'premiere', 'NYC', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'toryboard/film', 'comparison', 'two', 'trailers', 'Contrary', 'negative', 'reviews', 'calling', 'Nazi', ""'Dead"", 'Poet', 'Society', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'exceptional', 'effort', 'award', 'five', 'stars', 'five', 'especially', 'must-see', 'interested', 'infamous', 'period', 'history.Official', 'site', 'English', '[', ']']",Napola 2004  AKA Before the Fall

Since I've watched it in English and German I cannot understand what is the controversy here.The film is about two main themes in the National Socialist era--that Hitler promoted the idea that all German Volk were equal (see Europa, Europa for more on this theme amongst German male youth), but that some were more equal than others--those chosen to attend the National-Politische Erzeihungs-Anstalt (NAPOLA), schools to harden the will and spirit of the future Gauleiters (Dr. Joseph Goebbels was the Gauleiter of Berlin)--a form of political division of the anticipated future large German Reich.  As one states to the students in the castle school--who will be the future Gauleiters of Washington, D.C., of London?In other words, there was a bit of Animal Farm in Germany.  The main theme--contrasting the lower class youth recruited from the boxing rings of Berlin in 1942, and the sensitive son of a local Gauleiter--is well done.  All of the films production values are right-on in all details, from the drill-sergeant to the recruiter, to the savage Gauleiter and the wife who tears up--quietly--upon hearing of the death of the sensitive son Albrecht.  Ironically, the German word for WEAK is often used to denote homosexual; but this was not the usage in 1942 when the Gauleiter mutters about his son, ""Er war schwach.""  Hitler said no less of the German people (see Downfall), who did not deserve to win the war in which there were no ""civilians"" (Zivilisten).

My subjects of choice were the Nuremberg Code of 1947, and eugenics (massacres of people).  During pre-World War II Germany -and during WW II, I was stunned by involvements of the German Youth, in the Hitler Jugend, and special schools (Hitler Ugent).  Here is a DVD Movie, produced by Max Riemelt that I consider a Masterpiece of peudo-historical accuracy.  The DVD content really illustrates how the young were molded into a militaristic being of unquestioning obedience to the Fuhrer?!  There were those youth who failed to measure up, and were humiliated and degraded as they were ejected with permanent expulsion - some even committed suicide.  Unquestioning Obedience was in the Nazi culture civilian and military.  It has been my privilege to know good German people who decry what happened under the Third Reich; and producers like Max Riemelt, enable us to understand how that kind of indoctrination was allowed to succeed. In any nation with a government as a representative republic, a democracy is only a half-step away from a dictatorship if the tyrant and his cohorts seize power.  One of the methods involved is to conquer the youth with their ideology.  This DVD movie illustrates how that can happen.  The quality of this DVD is superb in visual and audial clarity.  I have viewed this DVD movie several times after I received it, and each time learned more about theobvious and subdued techniques of Nazi indoctrination.  By factual analogy, this production contains multiple warnings how a similar tragedy can take place in another setting - there are some that have commenced in our era:  At the Nuremberg Trials in 1949, Col.Ted Lawson, U.S. Army, testified at the trials and stated, "" ...

976786,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000EQ5TQ0,Grady Harp,"[51, 54]","BEFORE THE FALL ('NAPOLA') is a brilliantly made film that addresses the blind hopes of youth in becoming a success as a man, a factor that allowed and allows dictators to entice young men into the realm of warriors under the guise of applauded  bravery and the golden promise of achieving glory for a great cause. This story just happens to be about Hitler and his 40 Napola (training camps for the elite German youths in 1942) and the young boys and men who trained in these National Political societies. It could be found in many places and in many times...Friedrich Weimer (handsome and talented young Max Riemelt) comes from the lower class in Germany (his father is aiming him toward factory work) and is a fine young boxer.  His talents are noted by some representatives from the Nazi party and he is asked to report for enrollment in a Napola, an important means of education and training that Friedrich sees as being his way to become something special, someone important.  His father is anti-Nazi and refuses to let Friedrich go, but Friedrich is determined and runs into the night to join the Napola.  Once there he is admitted, groomed as a boxer for the Napola, and introduced to the Hitler's youth movement.  His fellow classmates vary from the very wealthy to other fine Arian lads.  They are trained, observed, and brainwashed as to the glory of the Thousand Year Reich.  Problems begin to arise when Friedrich gets to know his fellow classmates: Siegfried (Martin Goeres) is a  bedwetter and is humiliated publicly for his problem; Albrecht (Tom Schilling) is a poet and writer whose father is one of the governors of the Napola and Albrecht is anti-war; other lads seem on the surface to be obedient yet most have hidden reservations about what they are doing.Being 1942 some changes are occurring in the Nazi dream and the Senior class is sent out on a mission to fight the enemy. And one night Friedrich's class is called out of bed and sent into the woods to find Russian soldiers who are 'threatening' their security.  The boys open fire on the Russians only to find that they have killed a number of unarmed Russian boys.  This profoundly disturbs them all, but Albrecht in particular.  Friedrich continues to observe the manner in which he and the other boys are used and slowly his best friends find ways to martyr themselves and ultimately Friedrich does the same in his only way - by changing the way he approaches the Napola expectations of his boxing.Max Riemelt as Friedrich is outstanding: not only does he have the solid extraordinary good looks but he also can act, satisfying every nuance of this challenging role. The remainder of the cast - both young boys and the adults running the Napola - are superb.  The cinematography is subtly beautiful, ranging from the tough interiors inside to the vistas of a Germany before it was destroyed by the not too distant fall.  Director Dennis Gansel, who co-wrote the script with Maggie Peren, is a young man (the featurette with the DVD has an enlightening conversation between Gansel and Riemelt) knows exactly how to capture both the wide-eyed innocence of youth and the slowly crumbled ideals of young men.  This is an outstanding film to see and experience. Its lessons are terrifying and intense. In German with English subtitles.

976788,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B000EQ5TQ0,Jonathan Appleseed,"[24, 25]","The German title of this film is ""Napola"". Napola's were ""National Political Institutes of Education"", or Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten. They were community education sites that appeared when the National Socialists came into power in 1933. (Not 1942 as another review indicates.) They had very strict entrance exams. The blind and deaf need not apply, and racial purity was of prime concern. Indeed, when Friedrich (Max Riemelt) enrolled, measurements of his head were taken, his eyes were ""sized"", and his hair was color coded. When finished, he was declared ""Nordic Class One B"". One glance at Friedrich, and the first word that would pop into most people's mind, especially when watching a German film, is ""Aryan"".He had received attention while boxing, and his prowess gains him an invitation to the ""community"" Napola, even though it is unusual for students his age to be accepted. I'm guessing that he is about seventeen; I don't recall the film specifically giving an age. His father strictly forbids him, as he does not want to be associated with the Nazi's. He wants Friedrich to become an apprentice and work in the factories. But Friedrich has grander plans for himself. Departing silently in the middle of the night, he leaves two notes behind for his parents. To his mother, he is apologetic. To his father, he tells him that he forged his father's signature, and that if his father tries to take him out of the school he will tell the Gestapo what his father said about the Napola's. His father doesn't take this well, and unleashes his anger on Friedrich's bicycle.Arriving at the Napola, Friedrich is awed by its physical beauty - the school is housed in a gorgeous castle - and by how smart and purposeful he looks in his uniform. In the opening day speech, the headmaster states that everyone here is equal, regardless of where they came from. Farmer's son, whatever, it doesn't matter. He also says that when final victory is achieved, Germany will need Governors - not only for herself and Austria, but also for Washington, London, Moscow, and Cape Town. It's clear that they are grooming these boys not only to be soldiers, but also to be good little Nazi's. Friedrich's genuine smile and excitement is difficult to miss, and on such an innocent face it's difficult to see when looking back with the benefit of hindsight. One can't help but wonder how many students, like him, perfectly normal, became the Fuhrer's fools.Instruction at the Napola is rigorous, both physically and academically, although when discussing evolution they don't so much discuss the theory of evolution as it pertains to science, but how it applies to Hitler's beliefs: the culling of the weak. Physically, they go through many of the same drills that we see our own Marines go through during training camp.Friedrich meets a smaller boy, Albrecht (Tom Schilling), whom he immediately befriends. Throughout the film, Albrecht serves not only as Friedrich's conscience, but also as the film's moral center. Albrecht's father, Heinrich, is the Governor, and is firmly in Hitler's corner. Albrecht is his father's antithesis. Albrecht is an aesthete - and we are told at a memorial service for someone who committed suicide, but is hailed instead as a hero, that there is no room for aesthetes in Hitler's army - indeed, Friedrich is blunt force. We see the differences between Albrecht and Friedrich when Albrecht invites Friedrich to come home with him for his father's birthday. Friedrich impresses Heinrich as he has heard much about his boxing. In, perhaps, drunken stupidity, the Governor has the two boys box down in the cellar. Friedrich has no desire to hit his friend, but Albrecht must impress his father and mounts a rather ineffective offensive. When one or two of his punches land, Friedrich puts him down with two punches. Heinrich and his friends are proud of Friedrich and ignore Albrecht.The entrance of Heinrich serves as the introduction of the harsh realities of Nazism and Hitler's regime. The school itself has so far been but a tool for Hitler, and the children, remote and removed, know only their studies, themselves, and their training. One night a group of Russian prisoner's escapes into the woods surrounding this Napola, and Heinrich comes to them asking for help. The prisoners, he says, are ""armed and dangerous"" (so to speak), and sends the students into the woods after them, for the students know the woods better than anyone.In the woods, the boys become men, in an initiation most of us will never see; we can be thankful for that.""Before the Fall"" works very well in everything that it does. The boxing scenes are good and the strong friendship between Albrecht and Friedrich is believable. They are very different people. Albrecht comes from privilege, and doesn't necessarily want it, and Friedrich looks at the Napola as something that can give him access to privilege that his poor family could not. They are drawn together, perhaps because Friedrich senses that he has something to learn from Albrecht.Both Schilling and Riemelt put in excellent performances. It would be easy to portray Albrecht as simply weak, but Schilling makes us believe that Albrecht is a young man with strong convictions. Riemelt is helped with his Aryan good looks, but he proves to be a fine actor as well. In an emotional scene between the two friends, it's difficult to see that either are acting - although I would give the edge in performance to Schilling. His eyes resonated with intellect and emotion.",5,The Fuhrer's Fools,1176249600,"04 11, 2007",2007,5533,"['German', 'title', 'film', 'Napola', 'Napola', 'were', 'National', 'Political', 'Institutes',

If the parents don't agree, the kids will often go in their own direction. Maybe that's why some of our own kids are joining gangs. The minds of kids are resilient, open to suggestion. Some kids think it'll help if they go with the brain-washing element of a gang. This is not a new idea. The film, Before the Fall, tells of some such kids who are sure life will be better joining a ""gang"", but in this case, the gang is totally out of their control. In the case of this film, regarding Nazi Germany, the parents have little to do with it. Before the Fall is about all kinds of young people in a very controlled existence...the athlete, the poet, the bully...all of whom we've known in our own way.  It's quite universal. Dennis Ganzel's film is one that explores many facets of what it might've been like. Our hero, played to perfection by Max Riemelt, loves his family; the very special moment at the beginning with his little brother is priceless. He thinks he's better than that. He gets the chance and goes for it. He meets Albrecht, played by the excellent Tom Schilling, a sensitive guy, and a bond develops. Here's where ideas of sensibility and integrity develop, and it's a wonderful display. No gay thing at all, belying the DVD cover. I won't blab stuff away, but the NaPolA were the special schools where they developed (brain-washed) many of those fine young German kids, to turn them into Nazis. It's a very fine, disturbing film, winner of many Int'l awards. My strongest afterthought was that kids who are lured by the promise of friendship by gangs, or the promise of wealth by dealing drugs, are no different than these young dreamers, drawn to the promise of glory.

The main focus is on Friedrich Weimer (Max Reimelt) the very epitome of &#8216;Aryan perfection&#8217;, whose boxing skills are noticed by an instructor at the school and which gain him entry into its hallowed ranks.  To these is added Albrecht, son of the local gauleiter (paramilitary governor) whose father epitomizes, in his own way, the twisted logic of Nazi philosophy, which is totally at odds with his more sensitive son&#8217;s own world view.Gradually, Albrecht&#8217;s influence on Friedrich causes the latter to question his continued willing participation in and acceptance of the very philosophy he literally embodies.
