I am an absolute fan of everything Halloween and haunted houses, so if a movie incorporates those elements, the most god awful thing imaginable gets at least 3 stars.  Yes, my standards can go quite low.  That all said, this movie requires one to similarly relax their standards to enjoy, but will be pleasantly surprised if they do so.  Yes, the dialog is mostly terrible, and some of the acting completely deplorable, but its fun.  Its lighthearted, and a bunch of (supposedly) college kids create a haunted house.  Only very major problem - the character who leads the effort is terrible in every way; he is the obligatory hard a** on every front; he is constantly challenging everyone to a fight and is just an outright jerk.  It adds nothing to the story, and detracts in a very big way; his lines are awful and he's a terrible actor.

Pumpkin Jack (who is really Satan or some other demon) contributes props for the haunted house. One of the things he gives is an ancient book of spells.OK so we got this guy who plays a real jerk to everybody, and even punches out his girlfriend. The girlfrined's ex is also there and he is a wimp times 10. The girlfriend wants to come out of the closet with a lesbian that once had a three way with her and the jerk. Heidi is the wimp's girlfriend who ends up being a witch.All the guests trapped in the haunted house end up being what they are dressed up as (Zombies, vampires,etc.) The wimp and his ex-girlfriend are the only ones who get out alive.The kills are a joke. There is certainly no horror or fright to speak of. We get a so-so lesbian scene. The anti-climax of this movie with all the 'monsters' is roughly the last 20 minutes of the film and it's pathetic.I wouldn't recommend this movie even as a joke.

769466,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000AZT6Z,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Hallow's End (John Keeyes, 2003)That Hallow's End isn't the worst movie I saw this weekend is a traumatic experience. The worst part of it is that, unlike the completely useless Centipede!, there was so much potential here to have made not only a really good horror film, but one with subtexts, strong characters, and all the other things that would have made it an underground Silence of the Lambs. But... well, no. Not at all.I can't actually reveal most of the plot without spoilers. The movie revolves around a service fraternity who put on an annual haunted house to raise money for charity. All well and good, except that things start to go very, very wrong one year when tensions are already running high. The reason for each of those things constitutes its own major plot spoiler; the former is actually something of an unusual twist that I can't say anything at all about. The latter involves a love... well, quintangle, I guess.Hallow's End is Chris Burdick's first script, and it reads like a first script-- but like a first script which, had it had a really solid editor and a couple of rewrites, would have taken the world by storm the way the first feature scripts of Alan Ball (American Beauty) or Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko) did. Burdick obviously has a great feel for college life, especially the ugly ""everybody sleeps with everybody and everybody's jealous about it"" soap-opera stuff that no one wants to write about because, well, it's soap-opera stuff. Burdick comes so very close to nailing it here. The relationships in the movie, in fact, are the strongest part of the script. That's not saying a great deal, because a lot of things seem to have been shoved to the back in order to make room for the relationships; in particular, a number of other characters don't get anywhere near the development they deserve (including, ironically, one of the five characters involved here). Plot, also, recedes into the background in some very important places. That's great when it's intended; for example, in figuring out who's behind the whole mess. However, when plot threads disappear, never to be found again (whatever did happen to that guy in the parking lot? And what about that cat on the back fence-- why was it there?), one has to think that a few more rewrites would have been a really good idea.It's completely chauvinist to say that the movie was saved by the sex scenes. And, to be fair, the movie isn't saved by the sex scenes. One of them had the potential, if we cared at all about the characters, to have been a sex scene for the ages. Unfortunately, however, we once again turn to Burdick's script for why it's not; he's so focused on the dynamics of the relationships themselves that he forgot to people them with real characters. The lovers (not just in this scene, but in the whole film) are flat, wooden creations who might as well be blow-up dolls.I hope someone eventually retools the script and remakes this movie, because it really could be one for the ages. Unfortunately, however, this particular iteration is a horrible disaster. You won't be able to stop watching it, because it's really that bad.
