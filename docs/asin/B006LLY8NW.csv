1517167,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B006LLY8NW,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[2, 2]","This is the 2nd season of ef series. It focuses on some of the supporting characters of the 1st season. Kuze and Mizuki have been spending time together and become romantically involved. Kuze is suffering from a fatal heart disease and doesn't have much time left. Himura and Yuko's past is also the other part of the story. Both stories are very tragic and emotional, especially the one between Himura and Yuko. I finally understand why he was so melancholic in season 1. He's a strong person. I never liked Kuze very much in the 1st season, but he makes a major personality improvement from being with Mizuki in this season. He's not such a bad guy after all.This anime is great. The animation is top quality, the music is beautiful and the characters are compelling. The story of these four characters is amazing. The love they share is a beautiful thing. Even though it is mostly a sad story it's very uplifting as well. This is one of the most well written animes I've seen, and I own over 200 different series. I really hope you check this one out and enjoy it as much as I do. If you like Clannad, Kanon, Air, or Angel Beats, you will like ef as well. If you haven't seen the others I've mentioned; they are a must have as well.",5,Beautiful,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,1235,"['2nd', 'season', 'ef', 'series', 'supporting', 'characters', '1st', 'season', 'Kuze', 'Mizuki', 'have', 'been', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Kuze', 'suffering', 'fatal', 'heart', 'disease', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'left', 'Himura', 'Yuko', 'past', 'also', 'other', 'part', 'story', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'tragic', 'emotional', 'especially', 'one', 'Himura', 'Yuko', 'finally', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'melancholic', 'season', '1', 'strong', 'person', 'never', 'liked', 'Kuze', 'very', 'much', '1st', 'season', 'major', 'personality', 'improvement', 'being', 'Mizuki', 'season', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'all.This', 'anime', 'great', 'animation', 'top', 'quality', 'music', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'are', 'compelling', 'story', 'four', 'characters', 'amazing', 'love', 'share', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'Even', 'mostly', 'sad', 'story', 'very', 'uplifting', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'written', 'animes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'own', 'over', '200', 'different', 'series', 'really', 'hope', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'like', 'Clannad', 'Kanon', 'Air', 'Angel', 'Beats', 'will', 'like', 'ef', 'as', 'well', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'others', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'are', 'must', 'have', 'as', 'well']",N/A
1517168,A1ITY7MPAFKMXH,B006LLY8NW,Kohinata99,"[8, 8]","Ef a tale of melodies is more complicated than the first season and very tragic. I'd call it a mix of inhumane and beautiful. I won't spoil the ending, but its good at the best (Clannad After Story still beats them all), especially for a psychological thriller like this. If you havn't watched ef a tale of memories yet, I'd give that a go first or else you won't understand anything that's happening in a tale of melodies. I actually played a fan translation of the visual novel before I watched this season and there are many differences included in the series than what is seen in the game. Most of the cast from Clannad is here playing the English dub, there's EVERY textless opening and ending clip as the bonus features, DVD credits and Sentai previews, advertising Clannad After Story (even though that was released last year), A-Channel and four others. The music in this anime is very deep and beautiful and fits perfectly in tragic scenes. The art is breathtaking and has a unique style of seeing illusionary characteristics that only a particular character is aware of. For example, Kuze sees himself wearing masks all the time, Mizuki is seen with a red string of fate on her hand, she's seen in sky colors like the first season and Yuko has a bunch of Renassance art behind her (make sense?). For those of you looking for a good, solid romance/high school drama/psychological anime, this one hits the target. You won't be disappointed. Just be mentally prepared for the thrill ride this 12 episode series will bring you through. Some things are just hard to accept, but like I said, this series ends very beautifully.Sailor Channel",5,"This is a tale of ""The Will""",1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,1644,"['Ef', 'tale', 'melodies', 'more', 'complicated', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'tragic', ""'d"", 'call', 'mix', 'inhumane', 'beautiful', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'good', 'best', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'still', 'especially', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'hav', ""n't"", 'watched', 'ef', 'tale', 'memories', 'yet', ""'d"", 'give', 'go', 'first', 'else', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anything', 'happening', 'tale', 'melodies', 'actually', 'played', 'fan', 'translation', 'visual', 'novel', 'watched', 'season', 'are', 'many', 'differences', 'included', 'series', 'what', 'seen', 'game', 'Most', 'cast', 'Clannad', 'here', 'playing', 'English', 'dub', 'EVERY', 'textless', 'opening', 'ending', 'clip', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'credits', 'Sentai', 'previews', 'advertising', 'Clannad', 'Story', 'even', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'A-Channel', 'four', 'others', 'music', 'anime', 'very', 'deep', 'beautiful', 'perfectly', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'art', 'breathtaking', 'unique', 'style', 'seeing', 'illusionary', 'characteristics', 'only', 'particular', 'character', 'aware', 'example', 'Kuze', 'wearing', 'masks', 'time', 'Mizuki', 'seen', 'red', 'string', 'fate', 'hand', 'seen', 'sky', 'colors', 'first', 'season', 'Yuko', 'bunch', 'Renassance', 'art', 'make', 'sense', 'looking', 'good', 'solid', 'romance/high', 'school', 'drama/psychological', 'anime', 'one', 'target', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Just', 'be', 'mentally', 'prepared', 'thrill', 'ride', '12', 'episode', 'series', 'will', 'bring', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'hard', 'accept', 'said', 'series', 'very', 'beautifully.Sailor', 'Channel']",N/A
