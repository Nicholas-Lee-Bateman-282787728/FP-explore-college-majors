1571899,A2F03HEOVLGIB6,B008NNY93K,"Charles D. Ward ""Doug""","[0, 0]","I ordered this movie knowing about the bad reviews, but wanted to see it anyway. To me the acting wasn't all that bad and from a scale of 1 to 10, I give a 5 just for the acting itself. The reason I ordered this movie is because I like horror movies dealing with abandon mental hospitals. But I was disappointed with the camera shots and it constantly moving and shaking where you can't get a good look inside the hospital. I thought the movie was filmed entirely inside Greystone Hospital and I found out it wasn't. Another reason I ordered the movie is because Greystone is in danger of being demolish and there is a group trying to save and preserve it. I have to say other abandon mental hospitals movies like Grave Encounters and Session 9 is better than this one.",3,Could have been alittle better.,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,769,"['ordered', 'movie', 'knowing', 'bad', 'reviews', 'wanted', 'see', 'anyway', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'scale', '1', '10', 'give', '5', 'just', 'acting', 'reason', 'ordered', 'movie', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'dealing', 'abandon', 'mental', 'hospitals', 'was', 'disappointed', 'camera', 'shots', 'constantly', 'moving', 'shaking', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'look', 'hospital', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'Greystone', 'Hospital', 'found', 'was', ""n't"", 'reason', 'ordered', 'movie', 'Greystone', 'danger', 'being', 'demolish', 'group', 'trying', 'save', 'preserve', 'have', 'say', 'other', 'abandon', 'mental', 'hospitals', 'movies', 'Grave', 'Encounters', 'Session', '9', 'better', 'one']",Greystone Park

Three friends decide to spend the night exploring the supposedly local haunted hot spot, this one being an abandoned lunatic asylum, and scary stuff goes down.That pretty much sums it up.  Famed director Oliver Stone's son Sean takes the helm as co-writer, director, and co-star in his first movie.  His father, whom I suspect is the only way this movie got made in the first place, even has a cameo playing himself in the beginning.While its not the scariest movie to come out, Greystone Park kept my interest throughout it's short run time.  Overall the movie was a decent effort but you won't be missing out on anything if you decide to put it back on the shelf.  In fact, it seems vaguely like it's trying to be an artsy remake of the more superior Grave Encounters.  The actors play themselves ala The Blair Witch Project and there are enough surprisingly startling images that pop up on screen that add to a fairly realistic feel to the movie.  The main problem I had was that you never get to know the three leads so you simply don't care what happens to them.  We get that Antonella and Sean have a thing for one another but you've got to ask yourself why?  She's pretty but she's such a dull Mary Sue character.  He's good looking but he talks in such a condescending manner to the people around him that are supposed to be his friends that it makes him come across as just another spoiled Hollywood brat coasting on Daddy's successful coattails.Despite my misgivings, I recommend it maybe for a late night watch if you have nothing better to do.  Just be prepared to be scratching your head at the ending.  Trust me, it makes absolutely no sense.",2,The Spoiled Douche Project,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1687,"[""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'short', 'Three', 'friends', 'decide', 'spend', 'night', 'exploring', 'supposedly', 'local', 'haunted', 'hot', 'spot', 'one', 'being', 'abandoned', 'lunatic', 'asylum', 'scary', 'stuff', 'down.That', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'Famed', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'son', 'Sean', 'helm', 'co-writer', 'director', 'co-star', 'first', 'movie', 'father', 'whom', 'suspect', 'only', 'way', 'movie', 'got', 'made', 'first', 'place', 'even', 'cameo', 'playing', 'beginning.While', 'not', 'scariest', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'Greystone', 'Park', 'kept', 'interest', 'short', 'run', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'effort', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'anything', 'decide', 'put', 'back', 'shelf', 'fact', 'vaguely', 'trying', 'be', 'artsy', 'remake', 'more', 'superior', 'Grave', 'Encounters', 'actors', 'play', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'are', 'enough', 'surprisingly', 'startling', 'images', 'pop', 'up', 'screen', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'feel', 'movie', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'three', 'leads', 'so', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'get', 'Antonella', 'Sean', 'have', 'thing', 'one', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ask', 'why', 'pretty', 'such', 'dull', 'Mary', 'Sue', 'character', 'good', 'looking', 'such', 'condescending', 'manner', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'friends', 'come', 'as', 'just', 'spoiled', 'Hollywood', 'brat', 'coasting', 'Daddy', 'successful', 'coattails.Despite', 'misgivings', 'recommend', 'maybe', 'late', 'night', 'watch', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'scratching', 'head', 'ending', 'Trust', 'absolutely', 'sense']",Greystone Park
1571901,A2SROGMMCHUYHS,B008NNY93K,cyberwar,"[0, 1]","Let me start by saying I love the mock documentary horror genre. I try to watch any movies of the genre I can get a hold of. While a lot of them copy off the few gems and even the copies are half way decent.This one is absolutely awful. The special effects are just terrible if not non-existant. The video is a complete disappointment - shaking the cameras, spinning them around and hitting them to get them to de-digitize to mock them running around and being scared. If you have seen even one or two horror movies your not likely to get scared at all during this entire movie. This movie is more about three people acting like children and trying to scare each other.A most challenging thing about this movie is trying to sit through the entire thing. Save your money and watch grave encounters - its very similar and a lot better made. These guys should be ashamed of themselves for making this piece of garbage.I would give this a zerp or maybe half a star but I had to give it one.",1,Not even worth a dollar rental,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,986,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'love', 'mock', 'documentary', 'horror', 'genre', 'try', 'watch', 'movies', 'genre', 'can', 'get', 'hold', 'lot', 'copy', 'few', 'gems', 'even', 'copies', 'are', 'half', 'way', 'one', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'terrible', 'not', 'non-existant', 'video', 'complete', 'disappointment', 'shaking', 'cameras', 'spinning', 'around', 'hitting', 'get', 'de-digitize', 'mock', 'running', 'around', 'being', 'scared', 'have', 'seen', 'even', 'one', 'two', 'horror', 'movies', 'not', 'likely', 'get', 'scared', 'entire', 'movie', 'movie', 'more', 'three', 'people', 'acting', 'children', 'trying', 'scare', 'other.A', 'most', 'challenging', 'thing', 'movie', 'trying', 'sit', 'entire', 'thing', 'Save', 'money', 'watch', 'grave', 'very', 'similar', 'lot', 'better', 'made', 'guys', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'making', 'piece', 'garbage.I', 'would', 'give', 'zerp', 'maybe', 'star', 'had', 'give', 'one']",Greystone Park

With only a few spooky scene, Greystone Park is ultimately held back by found footage clich&eacute;s.Greystone Park has a very familiar story; a group of friends decide to visit a haunted mental hospital to find ghosts. There are a few scenes in the film that are creepy thanks to the setting and the use of shadows - sometimes you'll see a ghostly figure in a subtle manner. I think I creeped myself out more than the actual film did most of the time. Eventually, the film turns into a clich&eacute; found-footage mess. A lot of running from things we can't see, a lot of loud noises, a lot of shouting. Much of the film consists of choppy/shaky camera work and malfunctioning footage, so you rarely see anything scary. Considering Sean Stone plays Sean Stone in this film, you'd expect him to be a bit better at handling a camera, or at least have better equipment - then again, I've never recorded a ghosts, so maybe they do mess with the footage? The acting was okay from the cast; they play very generic insane people at times and very plain regular people during others, save for Alex Wraith who did a better job.Overall, Greystone Park can be a spooky experience, if you haven't grown tired of the haunted hospital found-footage films. The film probably would've been more entertaining and frightening as a documentary. As of 5/13/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a rental is recommended for fans of the genre, purchase with caution.Greystone Park has some blood and violence.",2,"With only a few spooky scenes, Greystone Park is ultimately held back by found-footage clich&eacute;s...",1368662400,"05 16, 2013",2013,1628,"['Greystone', 'Park', 'Sean', 'Stone', 'Alex', 'enter', 'Greystone', 'Psychiatric', 'Hospital', 'find', 'evidence', 'shadow', 'people', 'only', 'few', 'spooky', 'scene', 'Greystone', 'Park', 'ultimately', 'held', 'back', 'found', 'footage', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.Greystone', 'Park', 'very', 'familiar', 'story', 'group', 'friends', 'decide', 'visit', 'haunted', 'mental', 'hospital', 'find', 'ghosts', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'creepy', 'thanks', 'setting', 'use', 'shadows', 'sometimes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'ghostly', 'figure', 'subtle', 'manner', 'think', 'creeped', 'out', 'more', 'actual', 'film', 'did', 'most', 'time', 'Eventually', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'found-footage', 'mess', 'lot', 'running', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'loud', 'noises', 'lot', 'shouting', 'Much', 'film', 'choppy/shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'malfunctioning', 'footage', 'rarely', 'see', 'anything', 'scary', 'Considering', 'Sean', 'Stone', 'Sean', 'Stone', 'film', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'bit', 'better', 'handling', 'camera', 'least', 'have', 'better', 'equipment', 'then', 'again', ""'ve"", 'never', 'recorded', 'ghosts', 'so', 'maybe', 'do', 'mess', 'footage', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'cast', 'play', 'very', 'generic', 'insane', 'people', 'times', 'very', 'plain', 'regular', 'people', 'others', 'save', 'Alex', 'Wraith', 'who', 'did', 'better', 'job.Overall', 'Greystone', 'Park', 'can', 'be', 'spooky', 'experience', 'have', ""n't"", 'grown', 'tired', 'haunted', 'hospital', 'found-footage', 'films', 'film', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'entertaining', 'frightening', 'documentary', '5/13/13', 'film', 'available', 'Netflix', 'Streaming', 'rental', 'recommended', 'fans', 'genre', 'purchase', 'caution.Greystone', 'Park', 'blood', 'violence']",Greystone Park

Recently, this movie came out with the title ""presencias paranormales"" (paranormal presenses) and went to watching this movie on a full theater, everyone of us hoping to be scared and entertained. This movie achieves none of them. Instead, we received a movie so nule, so dark, so boring, that we all agreed that this was indeed the worst horror movie we've ever seen. At the end, the whole crowd started ""boo""ing in the theater. I think even louder than when you americans booed at the film ""the devil inside"" (although that film is one of the top horror films ever made in Peru).As you can imagine, we normally like good and bad horror movies because most of them are quite entertaining.But this is the one movie were everyone from all over the world will start talking about how bad it is.Leave it as it never happened.",1,The most boooring time I had watching a movie,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,944,"['First', 'say', 'am', 'peruvian', 'Normally', 'Peru', 'people', 'love', 'kinds', 'horror', 'movies', 'even', 'are', 'complete', 'failures', 'Recently', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'title', 'presencias', 'paranormales', 'paranormal', 'presenses', 'went', 'watching', 'movie', 'full', 'theater', 'everyone', 'hoping', 'be', 'scared', 'entertained', 'movie', 'none', 'Instead', 'received', 'movie', 'so', 'nule', 'dark', 'so', 'boring', 'agreed', 'was', 'indeed', 'worst', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'end', 'whole', 'crowd', 'started', 'boo', 'ing', 'theater', 'think', 'even', 'louder', 'when', 'americans', 'booed', 'film', 'devil', 'inside', 'film', 'one', 'top', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Peru', 'can', 'imagine', 'normally', 'like', 'good', 'bad', 'horror', 'movies', 'most', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining.But', 'one', 'movie', 'were', 'everyone', 'world', 'will', 'start', 'talking', 'how', 'bad', 'is.Leave', 'never', 'happened']",Greystone Park
