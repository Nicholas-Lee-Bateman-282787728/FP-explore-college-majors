1358582,A35W3JQYP0M655,B003Q7B6ZC,"John Thomas... ""New England...USA""","[6, 6]","I really don't think there is much I can add to all the praise that this series has already received, and is well deserved.  There is no doubt that the original Lonesome Dove movie is the very best of them all.  But Return To Lonesome Dove is probably the best sequel ever made that follows a true blockbuster.  Although Streets of Laredo can't live up to the near perfection of Lonesome Dove, it's still a worthy film to see, and by itself is a fine western drama that holds much of the same style and writing precision that the Dove series contains.  And the extras that are included in this set are both interesting and well done. If you're a true Lonesome Dove lover like me, then you really can't get enough of the movie, the writer behind it all, and the story of its production.One thing I feel I would like to add is that if you have never seen or heard of Lonesome Dove, I can't recommend enough that you read and watch it, even if you are or have never been into a western in your life.  What makes this series such a winner in my opinion is not the action and old west style violence that it contains here and there, (but much less than most westerns), but the dazzling dialogue that is both expertly created in the book and reproduced in the film that really draws a reader in and keeps them there. I was completely absorbed in it in both the series and the book and it never ceased to amuse, captivate, and amaze me.  It's a true masterpiece for just that alone in my opinion. Absolutely fabulous...  This is solid deal for the whole shebang and them some, and I offer it my highest recommendation... : )",5,Good Deal On The Whole Collection...,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,1617,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'can', 'add', 'praise', 'series', 'already', 'received', 'well', 'deserved', 'doubt', 'original', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'movie', 'very', 'best', 'Return', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'probably', 'best', 'sequel', 'ever', 'made', 'true', 'blockbuster', 'Streets', 'Laredo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'near', 'perfection', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'still', 'worthy', 'film', 'see', 'fine', 'western', 'drama', 'much', 'same', 'style', 'writing', 'precision', 'Dove', 'series', 'contains', 'extras', 'are', 'included', 'set', 'are', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', ""'re"", 'true', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'lover', 'then', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'movie', 'writer', 'story', 'production.One', 'thing', 'feel', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'enough', 'read', 'watch', 'even', 'are', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'western', 'life', 'What', 'series', 'winner', 'opinion', 'not', 'action', 'old', 'west', 'style', 'violence', 'here', 'there', 'much', 'less', 'most', 'westerns', 'dazzling', 'dialogue', 'expertly', 'created', 'book', 'reproduced', 'film', 'really', 'reader', 'keeps', 'there', 'was', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'series', 'book', 'never', 'ceased', 'amuse', 'captivate', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'alone', 'opinion', 'Absolutely', 'fabulous', 'solid', 'deal', 'whole', 'shebang', 'offer', 'highest', 'recommendation']",Lonesome Dove Collection
