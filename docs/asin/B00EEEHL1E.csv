I had no idea of the high amount of deportees to Jamaica.  This film dealt with the lives of 3 people who were deported back to Jamaica because of crimes (all drug related). Even though they'd made stupid decisions that prompted their deportation, I really felt bad for them. Seeing their stories and how they got caught up shows that bad things can happen to good people. This movie also shows the seedy side of Jamaica -- the side tourists don't see. What I liked is that some people had a happy ending, and some didn't. The film was very realistic. It also reinforced another belief I have: no matter what problems we have in America, I sure as hell wouldn't want to live anywhere else.",5,Surprsingly Good!,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,798,"['reviews', 'were', 'so', 'mixed', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'one', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'out', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'had', 'idea', 'high', 'amount', 'deportees', 'Jamaica', 'film', 'dealt', 'lives', '3', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'deported', 'back', 'Jamaica', 'crimes', 'drug', 'related', 'Even', ""'d"", 'made', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'prompted', 'deportation', 'really', 'felt', 'bad', 'Seeing', 'stories', 'how', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'shows', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'good', 'people', 'movie', 'also', 'seedy', 'side', 'Jamaica', 'side', 'tourists', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'What', 'liked', 'people', 'had', 'happy', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'also', 'reinforced', 'belief', 'have', 'matter', 'what', 'problems', 'have', 'America', 'sure', 'hell', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'anywhere', 'else']",Home Again

1667048,AG0U4ASWBUWVJ,B00EEEHL1E,Lee McQueen,"[15, 16]","Three members of Jamaica's widespread diaspora return to Kingston involuntarily through deportation on drug-related charges. A mother of small children from Toronto, a privileged school boy from London, and a drug enforcer from New York City.Despite having lived their entire lives in the bright lights of big cities, the three characters quickly find themselves humbled, abandoned, exploited, and in once case, broken, by their new identities as deportees. Deportees in Jamaica bear a stigma as lawbreakers and are not allowed to legally work. Neither can the three return to the countries of their birth--Canada, Great Britain, or the United States.So, in order to survive, the deportees must enter further into moral dilemmas, make compromises, and chip off parts of pride and dignity in order to navigate a labyrinthian bureacratic immigration policies.Filled with heartbreak, dread, and a small light of hope, this movie is a revelation on the human face of immigration and a reminder that those caught in the net are human beings.",4,Heartbreaking humanization of immigration bureaucracy,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,1036,"['Three', 'members', 'Jamaica', 'widespread', 'diaspora', 'return', 'Kingston', 'involuntarily', 'deportation', 'drug-related', 'charges', 'mother', 'small', 'children', 'Toronto', 'privileged', 'school', 'boy', 'London', 'drug', 'enforcer', 'New', 'York', 'City.Despite', 'having', 'lived', 'entire', 'lives', 'bright', 'lights', 'big', 'cities', 'three', 'characters', 'quickly', 'find', 'humbled', 'abandoned', 'exploited', 'once', 'case', 'broken', 'new', 'identities', 'deportees', 'Deportees', 'Jamaica', 'bear', 'stigma', 'lawbreakers', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'legally', 'work', 'can', 'three', 'return', 'countries', 'birth', 'Canada', 'Great', 'Britain', 'United', 'States.So', 'order', 'survive', 'deportees', 'must', 'enter', 'further', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'make', 'compromises', 'chip', 'parts', 'pride', 'dignity', 'order', 'navigate', 'labyrinthian', 'bureacratic', 'immigration', 'policies.Filled', 'heartbreak', 'dread', 'small', 'light', 'hope', 'movie', 'revelation', 'human', 'face', 'immigration', 'reminder', 'caught', 'net', 'are', 'human', 'beings']",Home Again
