1298722,A31KXTOQNTWUVM,B002XUBDQA,Bill Board,"[0, 2]","Again, all of my fellow reviewers here seem to be thumbing thru their Cameron Crowe Thesaurus to describe this.  OK, it is absolutely WONDERFUL to see Mick Ralphs, Paul Rodgers, and Simon Kirke playing together again.  Unfortunately, as the original Bad Company bassist, Boz Burrell, died 5 years ago, there are...""backup musicians.""  Ex-Heart (before that band started churning out sapphic-lite material) prettyboi, Howard Leese,  does an excellent job playing ""second lead/rhythm guitar"" behind Mick Ralphs.  But I have honestly - with the sole exception of ""Prince"" and any number of ""southern rock"" lead singers - NEVER seen a ""musician"" that alienated me so 100% thoroughly as the ""bass player "" on this thing, Lynn Sorenson.  A David Byron-lookalike wannabe, this creep mugs, pulling the stupidest faces, flaunts his prerequsite tight leather pants (while the rest of the band is in jeans), and so overplays that rediculous 5-string bass that you want to force feed him the damn thing.  The thing where Rodgers, Ralphs, and Kirke do ""Burning Sky,"" with its ""loud/booming/'Procol Harum @ Edmonton'""  recorded explosions kind of reminds one that, yes, the album itself was released in 1977, the nadir of the disco era.  And in all honesty, Kirke did a better job of performing ""Shooting Star"" with Ringo, Jack Bruce, Peter Frampton, & Gary Brooker on Ringo's 1997 incarnation of ""the All Starrs,"" than Rodgers does here.  Still:  that's quibbling.  To see the look of sheer etheral joy on Rodgers' face as he ""bounces off"" Ralph, the blinding grin and those ""nervous fingers"" riffs he plays, introducing ""Runnin' With The Pack""...man, it makes you forgive the rest of the DVD's shortcomings.  This DVD/CD thing is worth it; you can't - well, easily, anyway - obtain Bad Company ""product"" with Burrell still intact.  And forget what the erstwile ""sound enginner""/reviwers above would have you believe, the sound on this thing, especially in 5.1, is pristine!",4,Makes ya feel like you're in high school again -sort of,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,1961,"['Again', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'here', 'seem', 'be', 'thumbing', 'thru', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Thesaurus', 'describe', 'OK', 'absolutely', 'WONDERFUL', 'see', 'Mick', 'Ralphs', 'Paul', 'Rodgers', 'Simon', 'Kirke', 'playing', 'together', 'again', 'Unfortunately', 'original', 'Bad', 'Company', 'bassist', 'Boz', 'Burrell', 'died', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'backup', 'musicians', 'Ex-Heart', 'band', 'started', 'churning', 'out', 'sapphic-lite', 'material', 'prettyboi', 'Howard', 'Leese', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'second', 'lead/rhythm', 'guitar', 'Mick', 'Ralphs', 'have', 'honestly', 'sole', 'exception', 'Prince', 'number', 'southern', 'rock', 'lead', 'singers', 'NEVER', 'seen', 'musician', 'alienated', 'so', '100', '%', 'thoroughly', 'bass', 'player', 'thing', 'Lynn', 'Sorenson', 'David', 'Byron-lookalike', 'wannabe', 'creep', 'mugs', 'pulling', 'stupidest', 'prerequsite', 'tight', 'leather', 'pants', 'rest', 'band', 'jeans', 'so', 'rediculous', '5-string', 'bass', 'want', 'force', 'feed', 'damn', 'thing', 'thing', 'where', 'Rodgers', 'Ralphs', 'Kirke', 'do', 'Burning', 'Sky', ""loud/booming/'Procol"", 'Harum', '@', 'Edmonton', 'recorded', 'explosions', 'kind', 'reminds', 'one', 'yes', 'album', 'was', 'released', '1977', 'nadir', 'disco', 'era', 'honesty', 'Kirke', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'performing', 'Shooting', 'Star', 'Ringo', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'Peter', 'Frampton', 'Gary', 'Brooker', 'Ringo', '1997', 'incarnation', 'All', 'Starrs', 'Rodgers', 'here', 'Still', 'quibbling', 'see', 'look', 'sheer', 'etheral', 'joy', 'Rodgers', 'face', 'off', 'Ralph', 'blinding', 'grin', 'nervous', 'fingers', 'riffs', 'introducing', 'Runnin', 'Pack', 'man', 'forgive', 'rest', 'DVD', 'shortcomings', 'DVD/CD', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'well', 'easily', 'anyway', 'obtain', 'Bad', 'Company', 'product', 'Burrell', 'still', 'intact', 'forget', 'what', 'erstwile', 'sound', 'enginner', '/reviwers', 'above', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'sound', 'thing', 'especially', '5.1', 'pristine']",N/A

It almost looks like there's static in the video at times.  That said, the performance by the band, especially Paul Rodgers, is fantastic.  The sound quality is great, and the bonus audio CD of the performance is a big plus.

Some of this show has a rough feel to it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The first thing you notice is that Paul Rodgers has really preserved his voice. He sounds strong and gives a rocking performance throughout. Simon is also right on driving everything with his drums. Mick Ralphs looks a little frail and you get used to it after a few cuts. Howard Leese backs him and never tries to overshadow him. IMO Leese adds much to rounding out the sound and throws out a few leads for good measure. Rock and Roll Fantasy has that dual guitar part that the boys nail beautifully. Overall, a fine show with lots of energy and love from the crowd. The set list was perfect for me and the band really nailed Boz Burrell's Gone, Gone, Gone in the first half. I was also happy they threw in Sweet Little Sister. One more thing I liked was the CD came with the Blu-Ray. You have to pay for that on Paul Rodgers Live in Glasgow, which I also recommend, but this one is better.",4,"""What you're getting is rough and ready..but its real.""",1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,1085,"['Paul', 'crowd', 'Mick', 'couple', 'clinkers', 'solo', 'Live', 'Music', 'right', 'show', 'rough', 'feel', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'Paul', 'Rodgers', 'really', 'preserved', 'voice', 'strong', 'rocking', 'performance', 'Simon', 'also', 'right', 'driving', 'everything', 'drums', 'Mick', 'Ralphs', 'little', 'frail', 'get', 'used', 'few', 'cuts', 'Howard', 'Leese', 'backs', 'never', 'tries', 'overshadow', 'IMO', 'Leese', 'much', 'rounding', 'out', 'sound', 'out', 'few', 'leads', 'good', 'measure', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Fantasy', 'dual', 'guitar', 'part', 'boys', 'nail', 'beautifully', 'Overall', 'fine', 'show', 'lots', 'energy', 'love', 'crowd', 'set', 'list', 'was', 'perfect', 'band', 'really', 'nailed', 'Boz', 'Burrell', 'Gone', 'Gone', 'Gone', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'also', 'happy', 'threw', 'Sweet', 'Little', 'Sister', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'liked', 'was', 'CD', 'came', 'Blu-Ray', 'have', 'pay', 'Paul', 'Rodgers', 'Live', 'Glasgow', 'also', 'recommend', 'one', 'better']",N/A

This is a very good set of Bad Company classics...filmed and recorded well and presented with a bonus CD...for less than the cost to park  at a concert venue!!!For once I  can't really argue with the song selection and unlike the previous Bad Company DVD  they stayed away from FREE material even though Simon Kirke (Drums) was in that group with Paul Rodgers as well. Mick Ralphs (the bands original guitarist and co songwriter on many of their classics) is on board for this DVD which is a nice  bonus.

That being said, some of the comments about the audio and video are essentially correct (with some caveats).The picture is grainy and black levels leave something to be desired, but it is sharp and the colors are nice.  I didn't see any added edge enhancement and there are no encoding artifacts.  Overall, not bad at all but not reference quality either.The DTS-MA track has exellent resolution and is very clear. However, it is lacking any real bass and sounds too bright as a result.  Also the mix suffers from (as others have mentioned) Ralphs' guitar being too loud in the mix and Rodgers' vocals being spread out to the rear channels too much.  The stereo track lacked the bite of the DTS-MA track so after much fiddling I came up with a nice compromise.  Because my Blu-ray player does the sound decoding internally (and passes the lossless sound to the receiver via analog cables) I was able to pass the core-only 5.1 DTS track over the digital optical cable to my receiver and play a bit with my usual settings.  By increasing the crossover on the receiver from 60 Hz to 110Hz and increasing the subwoofer level a bit (about 3 dB), I was able to get a nice bass sound that wasn't boomy and had some definition to it.  The other advantage of this method is that it allows you to use the 5.1 track and (surprisingly) Rodgers' vocals are not all spread out but are nicely locked up front with only reverb in the rear channels. Ralphs' guitar also seems less prominent.Finally, after listening to it twice, I paid more attention to the music and really liked it a lot.  The first time through I thought the concert got better as it progressed but listening to the first few tracks again, it really was good right from the beginning.  I don't think Ralphs was that bad at all but the added guitarist does help.  Rodgers and Kirke are excellent IMO and the added bassist moves things along.  Overall a great collection of songs played very well by the three remaining members of Bad Co.Definitely recommendedUpdate 4/23/11:After some more fiddling with my receiver's and Blu-ray player's settings (i.e. setting my main speakers to small and boosting the subwoofer level a tad) the lossless audio track sounds much better.  I still think the guitars are a bit too loud in the mix but the overall sound is definitely better than the core-only DTS 5.1 track.  Still, both sound very good.",4,Much better than I feared...,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,2507,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'greatest', 'concert', 'disc', 'ever', 'very', 'good', 'being', 'said', 'comments', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'essentially', 'correct', 'caveats', '.The', 'picture', 'grainy', 'black', 'levels', 'leave', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'sharp', 'colors', 'are', 'nice', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'added', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'are', 'encoding', 'artifacts', 'Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'reference', 'quality', 'DTS-MA', 'track', 'exellent', 'resolution', 'very', 'clear', 'However', 'lacking', 'real', 'bass', 'too', 'bright', 'result', 'Also', 'mix', 'suffers', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Ralphs', 'guitar', 'being', 'too', 'loud', 'mix', 'Rodgers', 'vocals', 'being', 'spread', 'rear', 'channels', 'too', 'much', 'stereo', 'track', 'lacked', 'bite', 'DTS-MA', 'track', 'so', 'much', 'fiddling', 'came', 'up', 'nice', 'compromise', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'sound', 'decoding', 'internally', 'lossless', 'sound', 'receiver', 'analog', 'cables', 'was', 'able', 'pass', 'core-only', '5.1', 'DTS', 'track', 'digital', 'optical', 'cable', 'receiver', 'play', 'bit', 'usual', 'settings', 'increasing', 'crossover', 'receiver', '60', 'Hz', '110Hz', 'increasing', 'subwoofer', 'level', 'bit', '3', 'dB', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'nice', 'bass', 'sound', 'was', ""n't"", 'boomy', 'had', 'definition', 'other', 'advantage', 'method', 'use', '5.1', 'track', 'surprisingly', 'Rodgers', 'vocals', 'are', 'not', 'spread', 'out', 'are', 'nicely', 'locked', 'up', 'front', 'only', 'reverb', 'rear', 'channels', 'Ralphs', 'guitar', 'also', 'less', 'prominent.Finally', 'listening', 'twice', 'paid', 'more', 'attention', 'music', 'really', 'liked', 'lot', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'concert', 'got', 'better', 'progressed', 'listening', 'first', 'few', 'tracks', 'again', 'really', 'was', 'good', 'right', 'beginning', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ralphs', 'was', 'bad', 'added', 'guitarist', 'help', 'Rodgers', 'Kirke', 'are', 'excellent', 'IMO', 'added', 'bassist', 'moves', 'things', 'along', 'Overall', 'great', 'collection', 'songs', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'three', 'remaining', 'members', 'Bad', 'Co.Definitely', 'recommendedUpdate', '4/23/11', 'more', 'fiddling', 'receiver', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'settings', 'i.e', 'setting', 'main', 'speakers', 'small', 'boosting', 'subwoofer', 'level', 'tad', 'lossless', 'audio', 'track', 'much', 'better', 'still', 'think', 'guitars', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'loud', 'mix', 'overall', 'sound', 'definitely', 'better', 'core-only', 'DTS', '5.1', 'track', 'Still', 'sound', 'very', 'good']",N/A
