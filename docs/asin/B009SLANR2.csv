I would say that the back and forth between time periods was a little confusing and I had to watch it a second time in order to follow the story line fully, but even slightly confused it was still wonderful. It's not even a movie that can be fully described, it is one that just needs to be watched. Laugh out loud, heart breaking, innocent, and pure sweetness to watch!",5,A Touching Movie...,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,514,"['other', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'like', 'was', 'glad', 'be', 'wrong', 'must', 'see', 'would', 'say', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'periods', 'was', 'little', 'confusing', 'had', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'order', 'follow', 'story', 'line', 'fully', 'even', 'slightly', 'confused', 'was', 'still', 'wonderful', 'not', 'even', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'fully', 'described', 'one', 'just', 'be', 'watched', 'loud', 'heart', 'breaking', 'innocent', 'pure', 'sweetness', 'watch']",N/A

The movie has a lot of drama and emotion; the main character is deaf which makes the movie interesting when you're watching from his point of view. There is lots of love and sadness and I found myself tearing up at a couple of parts (both happy and sad tears). This movie does a great job of keeping viewers intrigued and interested as it almost comes off as a mystery, I highly recommend this movie!",4,Good movie,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,496,"['movie', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'have', 'watched', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'movie', 'lot', 'drama', 'emotion', 'main', 'character', 'deaf', 'movie', 'interesting', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'point', 'view', 'lots', 'love', 'sadness', 'found', 'tearing', 'up', 'couple', 'parts', 'happy', 'sad', 'tears', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'viewers', 'intrigued', 'interested', 'almost', 'off', 'mystery', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

1601879,A18MBO1U4DPY20,B009SLANR2,Harkanwar Anand,"[9, 9]","Barfi is a wonderfully crafted slightly colonized drama about a deaf man who wears his heart on his sleeve. The story unfolds retrospectively but keeps the viewer's intrigue nonetheless. The sets were delightful, the music coherent and almost every frame had the actor Ranbir Kapoor who I dare say after Barfi should be considered a world class actor. His performance is exemplary and he wants to be the best or so he says in interviews. I saw this film two months back but it has stayed with me and I cannot wait for the release of the DVD. Barfi's moral benevolence, romantic wavy humor and some powerhouse acting makes it a stand out film of the year for me.In honesty - you may or may not have read - but this film is inspired by a few scenes from other films like Notebook or Charlie Chaplin films what have you - but I feel the overall product stands far taller than it's sources. It has been given the nod by the Indian film fraternity to represent India at the Oscars. I don't think it will win but should you happen to prance upon it, it might just create an absolute riot in your head.",4,Overwhelming.,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,1095,"['Barfi', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'slightly', 'colonized', 'drama', 'deaf', 'man', 'who', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'story', 'retrospectively', 'viewer', 'intrigue', 'nonetheless', 'sets', 'were', 'delightful', 'music', 'coherent', 'almost', 'frame', 'had', 'actor', 'Ranbir', 'Kapoor', 'who', 'dare', 'say', 'Barfi', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'world', 'class', 'actor', 'performance', 'exemplary', 'be', 'best', 'so', 'interviews', 'saw', 'film', 'two', 'months', 'back', 'stayed', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'release', 'DVD', 'Barfi', 'moral', 'benevolence', 'romantic', 'wavy', 'humor', 'powerhouse', 'acting', 'stand', 'out', 'film', 'year', 'me.In', 'honesty', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'film', 'inspired', 'few', 'scenes', 'other', 'films', 'Notebook', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'films', 'what', 'have', 'feel', 'overall', 'product', 'far', 'taller', 'sources', 'been', 'given', 'nod', 'Indian', 'film', 'fraternity', 'represent', 'India', 'Oscars', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'win', 'should', 'happen', 'prance', 'might', 'just', 'create', 'absolute', 'riot', 'head']",N/A

Priyanka and Ranbir performances are great and powerfull; their characters are well manage and believe me I can't reconigze Priyanka in an interview after that, her transformation was awesome. The story is one of the most beautiful love story I ever, ever saw in a movie. That is exactly love is, accept each other without fear, sincerly and from the heart!The music is subliminal and have a special place to move the drama. It's amazing how the director/writer pays tribute to Chaplin in Barfi character awesomely performance by Kapoor. Definetly is neccesary to keep and eye of their future movies.

1601883,A20ULCEMNXPWLM,B009SLANR2,mel,"[1, 1]","This was a sweet, funny, & emotional film. Kudos to Ranbir for his acting! It was clear that he wished to honor his grandfather. His expressions/actions perfectly mimicked ""The Showman"". The story was obviously borrowed from other films, primarily Raj Kapoor's ""Awaara"", ""Anari"", & ""Shri 420"". I though it added a great deal to the story & I enjoyed the comedy. Every time it rained I kept expecting a chorus of ""Pyar Hua Iqrar Hua"", or a similar song, but that was not to be. The musical arrangements were decent, but I wish the songs in themselves had been better. The one element that always made Raj's movie's so incredible/memorable was the music, & in this case it was lacking. There were also 2 scenes in the movie that clearly came from ""The Notebook"". In this case those two scenes detracted from the movie. Instead of incorporating a Golden era vibe, it brought a contemporary vibe. Normally, it wouldn't make a difference, however, this time it did detract from the emotion of the movie & was not necessary. The entire movie was basically an homage to Raj's & Charlie Chaplin's films/characters. They could have made another ""Awaara"" (one of the greatest films ever made) had they focused on the movie a bit more.",5,BRILLIANT MOVIE!,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,1224,"['was', 'sweet', 'funny', 'emotional', 'film', 'Kudos', 'Ranbir', 'acting', 'was', 'clear', 'wished', 'honor', 'grandfather', 'expressions/actions', 'perfectly', 'mimicked', 'Showman', 'story', 'was', 'obviously', 'borrowed', 'other', 'films', 'primarily', 'Raj', 'Kapoor', 'Awaara', 'Anari', 'Shri', '420', 'added', 'great', 'deal', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'comedy', 'time', 'rained', 'kept', 'expecting', 'chorus', 'Pyar', 'Hua', 'Iqrar', 'Hua', 'similar', 'song', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'musical', 'arrangements', 'were', 'decent', 'wish', 'songs', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'one', 'element', 'always', 'made', 'Raj', 'movie', 'so', 'incredible/memorable', 'was', 'music', 'case', 'was', 'lacking', 'were', 'also', '2', 'scenes', 'movie', 'clearly', 'came', 'Notebook', 'case', 'two', 'scenes', 'detracted', 'movie', 'Instead', 'incorporating', 'Golden', 'era', 'vibe', 'brought', 'contemporary', 'vibe', 'Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'however', 'time', 'did', 'detract', 'emotion', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'basically', 'homage', 'Raj', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'films/characters', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Awaara', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'had', 'focused', 'movie', 'bit', 'more']",N/A
