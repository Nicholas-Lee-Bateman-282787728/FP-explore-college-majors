The characters, except for the two leads, are very good and really shine. But Candy is weak in his role, leaving much of his talent by the wayside... again maybe because of his death and scene cutting.

Not only was he a giant of a man physically but his innate warmth made him a giant of a person.  This film was given haphazard promotion and kind of dumped into the marketplace in the Summer of 1994.  The pain of losing Candy was so great that fans were not eager to see this movie.  Some seventeen years later the sting is still there.  You cannot view this film without a tinge of sadness.  I will not bandy words.  This is not a fitting epitaph for Candy's career.  It's obvious that his filming was incomplete.  Scenes where he was obviously intended to be in are written around his absence.  Body doubles and long shots are generously employed.  That said I found this film terrifically funny.  It seems that the makers of the film brushed away their tears and decided to put their best effort forth.  Yes, Candy isn't omnipresent but in his stead there's terrific work by esteemed actors like Richard Lewis, John C. McGinley, and Robert Pichardo.  What greater gift than giving your best for a fallen comrade.

699906,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B000065U1D,Kevin R. Austra,"[2, 7]","WAGONS EAST was a sad epitaph to John Candy's career.  The plot is good, but the screenplay is terrible.  Sadly, Candy passed away during the last two weeks of filming.  At the time the film company announced that Candy's scenes were already completed and in the can, but the reality is that John Candy is inexplicably missing from a couple of scenes.  His absence is most notable in the ""Snow in Summertime"" scene.  A padded stand-in wearing Candy's buckskins is seen sauntering away in the background, but John Candy is nowhere to be seen at the critical fireplace dialogue.Filmed in Mexico, WAGONS EAST is a BLAZING SADDLES wanna-be.  Instead it looks more like a low-budget television movie.  Actor Ed Lauter plays the bad guy.  Unfortunately, his stereotypical character is almost a rip-off of Kirk Douglas' accident prone heavy in 1979's comedy THE VILLAIN.  Lauter has been in television and movies a long time.  He appeared in both versions of THE LONGEST YARD. He could have found a better cinematic vehicle than this.The story is simply this:  The residents of a lackluster western town decide that it was a mistake to ever move west.  They hire John Candy to lead them back east.  Unfortunately, the publicity generated by this eastward march causes influential land speculators to panic.  As such, they attempt to foil returning settlers plans by sending a professional bad guy to intercept them.Much as I enjoy John Candy movies, this one is a disappointment.  I cannot even say that it was good to see Candy on the big screen again as he appeared to be laboring through each scene.  In Candy's last two films, CANADIAN BACON and WAGON'S EAST, he sported a scraggily beard.  This was not the same energetic John Candy from STRIPES, BREWSTER'S MILLIONS, SPLASH, UNCLE BUCK, PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES, ONLY THE LONELY, or SUMMER RENTAL.Okay, enough bashing the film.  The DVD is very affordable and if you are a John Candy fan, then this should probably find its way into your movie collection.

When their wagon train is off and running, the railroad bigwigs get wind of this new, Eastward ""movement"" and decide to put a stop to it. A hired killer is sent out to thwart their journey, as if the weather, terrain, and Indians weren't enough. On top of that, there is concern that the often drunk wagon master may have been the same one who led the ill-fated Donner Party to their unfortunate circumstance several years prior!When it was released in 1994, the year of star John Candy's death, ""Wagons East!"" was not well received. Why people can't enjoy a silly comedy like this now and then, I really don't know. Candy and co-star Richard Lewis lead a very funny cast of characters who end up in many humorous situations, all the while unaware that they are being unsuccessfully attacked by a Wile E. Coyote style villain sent by a greedy railroad tycoon who even has the U.S. Cavalry in his pocket. It's a silly film, and it's certainly not the greatest, some of the jokes even fall flat, but for the most part it is very funny and lots of fun! Well worth spending a night with, and maybe following up with a viewing of ""Almost Heroes"".The problem with this DVD is, therefore, not the film, but the presentation itself. Here we only get a fullscreen presentation that must be exactly the same as the VHS was (not a very good print), and with zero bonus features. There's really nothing good that can be said about it.

Action being second in this movie, now for some clues some people want to return to the east because of the west being untamed, Now the Indians go on the warpath and attack the wagon train in the middle of their camp, the wagon master puts them there by error while trying to hide from them. The Indians think its a good idea for the settlers to go back so that others will follow and escort them back, that's so they don't get lost of cause and they must have a few problems here and there to keep it spiced up. Story is terrific and a great sense of humor to go with it puts it as number one in my books.
