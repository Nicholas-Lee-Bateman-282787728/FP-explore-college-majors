703326,A2RQYLOWN92CCK,B000067J3P,A Customer,"[14, 16]","Imagine Nicole Kidman with black hair and tons of black eye shadow. Can't imagine that? Then see the much-delayed British film ""Birthday Girl."" Originally scheduled for release in September 2000, this crime comedy was filmed while Kidman was still married to Tom Cruise. She wasn't nearly as famous then as she is now, after starring last year in two award-worthy films - ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""The Others.""In comparison, ""Birthday Girl"" looks and feels low budget. Which it is. That doesn't make it a bad picture. Kidman's deadpan humor is slyly diverting, and her fake Russian accent is delivered with such a lack of pretension, her role as a mail-order bride from Moscow is cute. But after Kidman's year of living famously Hollywood-style, you can bet she won't be appearing in any more pictures like this.Here she plays a Russian mail-order bride, showing up at the international flights gate of London's airport to meet her computer-matched mail-order buyer, John Buckingham. He is played as a perpetually befuddled bank clerk by Ben Chaplin - exactly the sort of role that brought Hugh Grant so much box office success in the 1990s. For the first two-thirds of ""Birthday Girl,"" Kidman doesn't have any lines in English at all. She speaks Russian. No word, yet, on how she sounds to Russian ears.This picture is set in the London commuter suburb of St. Albans, filled with new generic architecture where colorless John Buckingham puts in long hours at work, then spends his free time feeling quite lonely. Though John has a sparkling suburban cottage with a big back yard, he always turns to his computer for release - surfing Websites that offer chances to meet beautiful Russian women. Spotting a picture of Nadia (Kidman), and biographic info claiming she is fluent in English, he signs up.Within just a few minutes of screen time, John is standing at that London airport gate, staring at this dark-haired, heavily made-up woman named Nadia. She's wearing funny-looking foreign clothes and doesn't speak a word of English. What follows is a brisk British crime comedy filled with uniquely English humor we can only describe as droll. Think of ""Sexy Beast"" with more romance and less violence. Think of a half-dozen Australian comedies that can only be described as quirky. Toss in the words ""wry"" and ""ironic,"" too.""Birthday Girl"" is a group effort from the British brothers Jez, Tom and Stephen Butterworth. Jez is the director and co-writer with Tom. Stephen is co-producer with Diana Phillips. This is the group's second film together, but the first with actors who have international reputations.Also taking part are two well-known names in French cinema, Vincent Cassel (""Brotherhood of the Wolves"") and Mathieu Kassovitz, who played the boyfriend in ""Am&eacute;lie.""The plot also contains some genuine surprises early on, so providing even the most vague synopsis is impossible. John and Nadia are definitely opposites that seem to have little chance of attracting each other - until Nadia's two Russian friends (Cassel and Kassovitz) show up. Their entrance is a big surprise, too, but it is just the beginning.Suffice it to say we learn Nadia is only an alias (she has two additional aliases). We learn what ""pillock"" means in England, we learn mail-order brides can arrive carrying more baggage than their suitcases, and we learn Nadia is a chain smoker. There are several toilet scenes, one kick-in-the-crotch scene, one scene where John uses an acoustic guitar as a lethal weapon (though an electric guitar would have worked better) and visual proof that throughout the labyrinthine turns in this tale of comedy and crime, Kidman remains the tallest person onscreen.The very harsh criticism that killed the public opinion really ruined the movie. When the critics hear of a romantic thirller, they excpect conventional 'John loved Jane, Bad Luck, Sob Sob Sob...'. This movie delivers many hidden messages wrapped in many sexual symbols with great acting and great direction. It is a vluable asset to any library.",5,The critics should really have merci...,1037491200,"11 17, 2002",2002,4028,"['Imagine', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'black', 'hair', 'tons', 'black', 'eye', 'shadow', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Then', 'see', 'much-delayed', 'British', 'film', 'Birthday', 'Girl', 'Originally', 'scheduled', 'release', 'September', '2000', 'crime', 'comedy', 'was', 'filmed', 'Kidman', 'was', 'still', 'married', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'famous', 'then', 'now', 'starring', 'last', 'year', 'two', 'award-worthy', 'films', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Others', 'comparison', 'Birthday', 'Girl', 'feels', 'low', 'budget', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'picture', 'Kidman', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'slyly', 'diverting', 'fake', 'Russian', 'accent', 'delivered', 'lack', 'pretension', 'role', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'Moscow', 'cute', 'Kidman', 'year', 'living', 'famously', 'Hollywood-style', 'can', 'bet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'appearing', 'more', 'pictures', 'Russian', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'showing', 'up', 'international', 'flights', 'gate', 'London', 'airport', 'meet', 'computer-matched', 'mail-order', 'buyer', 'John', 'Buckingham', 'played', 'perpetually', 'befuddled', 'bank', 'clerk', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'exactly', 'sort', 'role', 'brought', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'so', 'much', 'box', 'office', 'success', '1990s', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'Birthday', 'Girl', 'Kidman', ""n't"", 'have', 'lines', 'English', 'Russian', 'word', 'yet', 'how', 'Russian', 'ears.This', 'picture', 'set', 'London', 'commuter', 'suburb', 'St.', 'Albans', 'filled', 'new', 'generic', 'architecture', 'where', 'colorless', 'John', 'Buckingham', 'long', 'hours', 'work', 'then', 'free', 'time', 'feeling', 'quite', 'lonely', 'Though', 'John', 'sparkling', 'suburban', 'cottage', 'big', 'back', 'yard', 'always', 'computer', 'release', 'surfing', 'offer', 'chances', 'meet', 'beautiful', 'Russian', 'women', 'Spotting', 'picture', 'Nadia', 'Kidman', 'biographic', 'info', 'claiming', 'fluent', 'English', 'signs', 'up.Within', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'John', 'standing', 'London', 'airport', 'gate', 'staring', 'dark-haired', 'heavily', 'made-up', 'woman', 'named', 'Nadia', 'wearing', 'funny-looking', 'foreign', 'clothes', ""n't"", 'speak', 'word', 'English', 'What', 'brisk', 'British', 'crime', 'comedy', 'filled', 'uniquely', 'English', 'humor', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'droll', 'Think', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'more', 'romance', 'less', 'violence', 'Think', 'half-dozen', 'Australian', 'comedies', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'quirky', 'Toss', 'words', 'wry', 'ironic', 'too', 'Birthday', 'Girl', 'group', 'effort', 'British', 'brothers', 'Jez', 'Tom', 'Stephen', 'Butterworth', 'Jez', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Tom', 'Stephen', 'co-producer', 'Diana', 'Phillips', 'group', 'second', 'film', 'together', 'first', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'international', 'reputations.Also', 'taking', 'part', 'are', 'two', 'well-known', 'names', 'French', 'cinema', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Brotherhood', 'Wolves', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'who', 'played', 'boyfriend', 'Am', 'eacute', 'lie', 'plot', 'also', 'genuine', 'surprises', 'early', 'providing', 'even', 'most', 'vague', 'synopsis', 'impossible', 'John', 'Nadia', 'are', 'definitely', 'seem', 'have', 'little', 'chance', 'attracting', 'other', 'Nadia', 'two', 'Russian', 'friends', 'Cassel', 'Kassovitz', 'show', 'up', 'entrance', 'big', 'surprise', 'too', 'just', 'beginning.Suffice', 'say', 'learn', 'Nadia', 'only', 'alias', 'two', 'additional', 'aliases', 'learn', 'what', 'pillock', 'England', 'learn', 'mail-order', 'brides', 'can', 'arrive', 'carrying', 'more', 'baggage', 'suitcases', 'learn', 'Nadia', 'chain', 'smoker', 'are', 'several', 'toilet', 'scenes', 'one', 'kick-in-the-crotch', 'scene', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'John', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'lethal', 'weapon', 'electric', 'guitar', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'visual', 'proof', 'labyrinthine', 'tale', 'comedy', 'crime', 'Kidman', 'tallest', 'person', 'onscreen.The', 'very', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'killed', 'public', 'opinion', 'really', 'ruined', 'movie', 'When', 'critics', 'hear', 'romantic', 'thirller', 'excpect', 'conventional', ""'John"", 'loved', 'Jane', 'Bad', 'Luck', 'Sob', 'Sob', 'Sob', 'movie', 'many', 'hidden', 'messages', 'wrapped', 'many', 'sexual', 'symbols', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'direction', 'vluable', 'asset', 'library']",N/A

To this end, he decides to help things along via the internet, sending for a Russian girl he hopes will be the one.This Jez Butterworth directed film is full of surprises as it moves from a tentative romance to a crime thriller of sorts and back to romance again. It is all done so well that your interest never lags and you have absolutely no idea how this journey will end. It is presented in an off-beat manner, however, and it is easy to understand the great divide between those who love this film and those much less enthusiastic.Nicole Kidman is sexy and wonderful as John's would-be bride Nadia. The awkwardness of their first meeting at the airport and the drive home, punctuated by Nadia throwing up, is perfectly captured. She speaks no english whatsoever and John considers sending her back at first. But Nadia is sexually agressive and wants to please John, each encounter better than the last. It is John's heart, however, which is finally given to Nadia, as he begins wearing the ring she gave him everywhere.But their tentative romance takes an unusual turn when two of her pals from Russia show up to see her. Vincent Cassel as Alexi and actor/director Mathieu Kassovitz are very good as her seemingly harmless friends. An advance made by one of them towards Nadia, however, turns this into a crime thriller, John having to commit a crime to save his newfound love. Only too late does he realize something much more is really at the heart of the matter.To reveal anything further might ruin the film's impact for those viewing this for the first time. Through all the shifts in genre, however, there is a certain mood of loneliness and anguish for love which runs through the fabric of this film like a soft yet unbreakable thread spun with great care by Chaplin's every guy performance and the increasingly haunted eyes of Kidman's Nadia, a window to her heart.Set in England but actually filmed in Kidman's home country of Australia, she is quite fabulous in Birthday Girl. Those weary of paint by the numbers formula romances will find this refreshing and enjoy it more than others. It is definitely one of those films which either hits you just right or all wrong.

Chapman is the perfect foil; the two play off each other in wonderful fashion.

703342,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000067J3P,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Birthday Girl is an extraordinary film - and yet more proof that Nicole Kidman is the greatest actress of our generation (at least until Jodie Foster makes a comeback).  It's hard to characterize this particular film, though - I wouldn't call it a dark comedy, as many do, because it is just far too dramatic, and it's hard to call it a love story just because that love story is such a strange one.  However you categorize it, though, it is fantastic.  It's not a film that will hit everyone's buttons, so I can understand some of the average reviews, but those who love Birthday Girl will absolutely adore it.  Of course, some will make light of the fact that you have Nicole Kidman and two French actors playing Russians in a movie filmed in Australia and set in England.  That does sound rather kooky, but everyone in this film, no matter where they are from or who they are playing, is amazing.I'm not going to say all that much about the plot because Birthday Girl is driven by some pretty serious turning points and surprises - and I'm not going to spoil a single thing if I can help it.  You basically start out with a young English fellow named John Buckingham (Ben Chaplin); he's a prisoner of his own boring life, and he decides to make the bold move of importing a mail order bride from Russia.  When Nadia (Nicole Kidman) arrives, she's not exactly what he expected - there is, for instance, the rather bothersome fact that she does not speak a word of English (so much for truth in advertising).  She is also, let us say, a little less than Kidman's normally glowing self early on.  John makes a go of it, but he eventually decides to send Nadia back home.  Nadia, however, has other plans, and I must say she makes quite a convincing case for keeping her around the house.  She's quite amenable to John's somewhat extravagant, ahem, needs.  Maybe things will work out after all, John thinks - and then two friends of Nadia's arrive for a visit.  John's life will never be the same - not by a long shot.  I have to question a few of John's actions later on, but the whole thing definitely makes for some great suspense and some crazy twists and turns.As for the DVD, it comes without a commentary, unfortunately, but it does feature a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film along with a music video featuring Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman.Birthday Girl isn't really a film for those who like action and more action, or those who want to see everything laid out in a completely straightforward manner.  This film is really about people and emotions and the uncanny ability for love to blossom in even the harshest of conditions.  Even if you don't like the story, you can't help but be impressed by the performances, especially that of Kidman, who is more than convincing as a Russian.

The bride is played by an unlikely Nicole Kidman, the Hawaiian-born actress generally assumed to be Australian. She's said to have spoken no Russian before making this movie. Those who know more Russian than I have said her Russian is remarkable for one who just started speaking it, as is that of other cast members who similarly spoke it for the first time in learning their movie lines herein. That may be the most remarkable thing about this movie. If it were all that remarkable, it might deserve five stars, but it is rather flawed in fact. At first it's a fairly tense drama. The new groom is expecting a bride who speaks English, but soon finds she apparently can't. More surprises follow. She brings two ""cousins"" into his life, and he soon finds that all three of these Russians are setting him up to participate in a bank robbery. That much of the movie is decently crafted, for whatever the story is worth. But an attempt to tack on a real romance to that plot is purely ad hoc. The bride is as much a participant in the robbery as her ""cousins"", so why should she get a pass and be considered reformed to go on and make a satisfactory wife? No reasonable attempt is made to show her reforming; were just expected to accept an essentially happily-ever-after type ending to this crime drama incongrously turned romance.

703352,A18GJITP5IJQ9H,B000067J3P,Jamie Marks,"[0, 3]","The idea of a mail-order bride is something that a surprising amount of men consider at one point or another.  How many of those men actually act on it is a different story.  Whatever the case may be, director Jez Butterworth's new film, ""Birthday Girl"", explores the possibilities of everything that could go wrong with a bride that one has to pay for.  It's been said before, and it will be said again:  Crossing genre lines can be an extremely risky undertaking, with the results often ending up disastrous.  That is not the case with ""Birthday Girl"", which carefully treads the border between lighthearted romantic comedy and dark crime drama.  The transition from one to the other is rather steep, but it makes itself work due to the amazing script by Jez and Tom Butterworth.  The brothers balance every part of their film to prevent any one aspect from becoming too overpowering.  When it seems like the ""dark side"" is taking over, they kick in a little notch of sly comedy or some playful banter between the two leads.  The first twenty minutes of the film is the romance section.  It's cute at times, and, at other times, very sensual.  The romance here is very believable, despite the farfetched conditions that led up to it.  When the thriller part takes over, the picture just continues to shine, allowing more room for the main characters to gain some depth.  Ben Chaplin gives a decent performance, but he is sort of passive to begin with anyway.  It's actually quite hard to pinpoint specific emotions that he portrays throughout the film because he almost always looks the same.  It's not a terrible performance by any means, but it in no way compares to that of Nicole Kidman.  Nic is perfection.  She brings an incredibly human quality to a character that would have otherwise been cursory.  Kidman's Nadia is an exotic kitten - mischievous, deceiving, and ....  She is a truly awesome actress.  ""Birthday Girl"" is the first great film of 2002.  It's a mesmerizing and seductive masterpiece that works impeccably as both a romantic comedy and a thriller.

Otherwise ...Ben Chaplin is John Buckingham, drearily employed as a bank teller in a nondescript London suburb. John is good looking enough, but hasn't the charm or machismo necessary to attract a woman into a relationship. Loneliness drives him onto the Web, and the audience watches him scan the video clips at &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;, a lonely heart site that offers mail-order brides. Without further ado, our hero is meeting Nadia (Kidman) at the airport. John understood that Nadia spoke English, but she doesn't. So, after installing Nadia in the guest room, he tries vainly to reach the organization responsible for the awkward situation. In the meantime, Nadia discovers John's stash of bondage porn and decides to take control of things, so to speak. Soon, with the help of John's silk ties and Nadia's knitting needles, both are in love. Then, on Nadia's birthday, two of her &quot;cousins&quot;, Alexei and Yuri, show up to drink vodka and sack out in the living room. When John eventually demands that they leave, things take a decidedly nasty turn.The fact that I think Nicole is a Babe is a given, and the black eye liner her Nadia persona uses adds trashy allure. I like that, and it compels me to lavish two stars on an otherwise dysfunctional film. It's as if the creators had two teams of scriptwriters, the first bailing out after opening with an interesting premise, and the second taking over without a clue as to how to finish the story. Even then, the plot might have been salvageable had John even approached being an appealing character. But he wasn't; he spends too much time staring blankly off into space as if contemplating the first twinges of gas distension. To say there was any chemistry between him and Nadia would be ludicrous overstatement. Meanwhile, the two louts, Alexei and Yuri, add absolutely nothing of value to the production.

The site provides british guys with russian women who want to be married in England. Chaplin has the perfect face of the freightened but semi-strong-willed type who thinks his life [stinks] but has no power to improve it. Nicole Kidman is the perfect quasi-naive russian girl with huge sex-appeal. The pair is perfect on screen. Nicole Kidamn didn't speak a word of russian, but found out a way to look like she was a native from Moscow. That's the kind of actress she is. After stepping out of the shadow of her ex-husband, Nicole has been elevated as the top actress of her generation,  and I think she deserves it. Two french actors, Vincent Cassell and Mathiew Kassovitz, as ""Nadia""'s strange, funny and sometimes violent cousins, give the movie the right tone between morbid and comedy. When these two ""cousins"" arrive at John's door, the situation gets out of control, and John's life will be agitated beyond his wildest dreams.As it may seem in a quick glance, ""Birthday girl"" is not just a funny and stupid-looking movie.

The Birthday Girl seems to try for something darker than it actually becomes and it looks like  all the actors are just moonlighting.John (Chaplin), a lonely bank teller, orders a mail order bride (Kidman) from Russia, only to discover when she gets here that she doesn't speak a word of English and isn't what she seems. Mayhem ensues when two of her friends come for her birthday. And although the idea of a Russian mail order bride may seem like a great idea on paper, the execution of it in this film disappoints.The first half of the film is quite entertaining, as Ben Chaplin proves to be quite adept at walking the fine line between black comedy and pathos. We like his character even if we're particularly impressed by him. The monotony of his life is portrayed humorously if not particularly inventively. But he and Kidman don't have the combustible chemistry that the film requires, you can see them as friends but not anything else.

It's a shame no one saw it, and it was marketed & reviewed so horribly. The trailers really were selling it as some sort of sexy, edgy, thriller.  When it's really a different kind of comedy.  More Romancing the Stone than Fatal Attraction.  Nicole Kidman does a great Russian accent and speaks it too, and Ben Chaplin is the greatest sap next to John Cusack or Hugh Grant.  The movie's hilarious.  He digs at her: ""don't give me that 'it's so hard in Russia in winter, that we have to eat each other...it's so cold that we have to go to England & shag people to keep warm"".  She digs at him: ""what did you way, 'when I grow up what I want is to still be in this town, in this job that I hate, in a house with ants & a big bag of pornography, and then I'm going to send off to Russia for a wife and she will fall in love with me"".I started laughing and didn't stop.  Yes, there are dramatic moments, and there's some suspense...but that just heightens the humor.  It's not like an in-your-face screwball comedy, it's just that the situations that the characters manage to get into are simply HILARIUOS! 2002 was a bang up year for Nicole Kidman with Moulin Rouge, The Others, and this underrated gem...it just prooves what a diverse actress she really is.

703365,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000067J3P,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 3]","""Birthday Girl"" is excellent because of the wonderful performance of Nicole Kidman.  She shows herself to be an actress of great depth by the distinct characters she has chosen to play.  In the bonus materials, Ben Chaplin describes that he was working with an ""actress,"" not a movie star.  She is marvelous as the girl who smiles and says ""Yes"" when asked if she's a giraffe.  Ben Chaplin seems to generate good chemistry with her as the wild-eyed innocent who falls for her.  We see the plot weave back and forth and wonder who will end up with whom.  Vincent Cassel as Alexi and Mathieu Kassovitz as Yuri turn in great performances.  The accomplishment seems even greater when you realize that neither of these two nor Kidman speak Russian.  Cassel and Kassovitz are famous French actors; Kidman learned Russian from a woman in the Russian embassy in Australia.  Jez Butterworth does slingshot us through great changes.  The scene where Nicole almost gets boiling water poured on her head was almost too much for me.  Always the sucker for the happy ending, I was glad to see Kidman and Chaplin walk off hand in hand to Russia, knowing that we're seeing happily ever after and not just a romance til the end of next week.  I didn't fully understand why Chaplin was attracted to bondage.  It didn't seem to add much to the romantic aspect of the film, but did show how far Nadia (NK) would go.

Yes you could say it's part romantic comedy, part thriller, part drama...but so was &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; and that's a really good film. In places the film is laugh-out-loud funny (usually from one of Ben Chaplin's lines), and at other times it's serious. Both Kidman and Chaplin give good performances, and the pace is kept reasonably tight with a not-too-long running time. Kidman is convincing as the russian mail order bride, and Chaplin delivers most of the film's laughs. I liked it near the end when Kidman turns the joke of saying &quot;yes&quot; to everything back on Chaplin!. My only point of contention with the movie (***POSSIBLE SPOILER***) is where Chaplin's character is forced to rob a bank...why didn't he just go straight to the police? This bothered me for a while, but by the end of the movie I was willing to overlook it.Ebert &amp; Roeper (who gave it two thumbs down) said the movie was &quot;predictable&quot; - to me it was anything BUT predictable.

703368,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B000067J3P,Martin Asiner,"[1, 5]","BIRTHDAY GIRL is the kind of movie that promises to be a light hearted romantic comedy of two dissimilar people meeting and somehow falling in love.  For the first third of the movie, director Jez Butterworth delivers.  John (Ben Chaplin) is a mild-mannered bank clerk who tires of not having the right woman so he goes on the Internet to find a mail-order bride.  Putting aside the internal logical and legal flaw that requires one to actually meet a Russian woman before sending away for her as if she were a fine English pipe, John meets Nadia (Nicole Kidman) at the airport and fully expects the English-speaking beauty that he was led to think was coming. Nadia and John spend several delightful scenes together as the cultural and linguistic differences first trip, then attract them.  Beginning in the middle, Butterworth leads BIRTHDAY GIRL seriously astray as he switches tonal gears from the light world of romance to the gritty edge of fraud and violence.  Two of Nadia's 'cousins' enter unannounced to complicate John's sedate life with what is frankly an unbelievable tale of kidnapping and bank fraud.  As John obeyed the commands of these two Russians to steal money, I was left gasping at his naivete in not informing the authorities.  What follows the bank robbery is your standard thriller between a decent but wimpy clerk and two vicious Russian criminals.  The ending, which I shall not reveal here, left me raging at the overly forgiving attitude of a schnook whose schnookness was rubbed in his face by a scheming woman who has the audacity to continue to ask for help even after her true intentions are made known.  Still, BIRTHDAY GIRL succeeds in engaging the attention of the viewer even after the closing credits.

703370,A152C8GYY25HAH,B000067J3P,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","In the summer of 2001, Nicole Kidman's career was redefined by the release of two critically acclaimed movies, ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""The Others"". She went from well known actress to super star. What made her victory even sweeter was that the two roles were complete opposites of each other. ""Birthday Girl"" was released after these two success but was actually filmed before them. This small, independent British film, though a minor league entry, is an interesting and quirky black comedy that further showcases her talents.John [Ben Chaplin] has worked in a bank for ten years. The job pays enough for him to afford a nice little house. He's dependable, thoughtful and predictable. In other words, he has no life. He secretly knows this and decides to shake up his life dramatically by picking out a Russian bride via the Internet. Her name is Nadia [Kidman], and she is false advertising personified. The ad claims she is a non-smoker fluent in English. She turns out to be a chain smoker whose command of our language is limited to ""Yes"" and ""No"". John desperately tries to reach the Internet company to find out how to ship her back. Meanwhile, Nadia discovers what turns John on. They discover the age-old universal language. Things begin to improve until two of Nadia's friends from Russia casually drop in. John learns his bride is full of surprises, most of them unpleasant. His dull, simple life is over and an exceedingly complicated and dangerous one replaces it.Though it has flair and a touch of originality, there isn't a whole lot to ""Birthday Girl"". It's a diversion, and a dark one at that. There are a lot of funny scenes, but others are quite serious, as well as somewhat violent. Director Jez Butterworth, who also co-wrote the screenplay, manages this mix fairly well, but the shifts in tone will not appeal to some viewers.

(Although, after seeing the photo at the top of this page, I prefer that one!) Reading the back of this gives you the idea that its a nice happy film, where true loves wins.It's not.The start of it is too fast. Within minutes, the two main characters are meeting. There's a few sex scenes, including Nicole Kidman being tied up (how cliched), and then it descends into utter madness. It fast becomes a dark, violent film, leaving you wondering if there were two scriptwriters working on this, with very different ideas of how the film should be. If it had stayed the same at the start, I would have given it a higher mark. Ben Chaplain's character just annoyed me, but I really liked Nicole Kidman in this. It's a different role than she would normally play.There's one scene that will stick out in my mind for this film, and its a very tender scene. It's when Ben Chaplain & Nicole Kidman are lying together in bed, and she's asleep. It's so sweet when he brushes hair off her face, and just watches her sleep. Makes you go ""awwwwww"".There's one good extra, which I also bought it for, and was very disappointed. Nicole Kidman & Robbie Williams did a duet of ""Something Stupid"" (and she showed Tom Cruise exactly what he was losing by divorcing her!), and the video to this was on the DVD. Unfortunately, they covered all the good bits with clips from the film. The original video had some very saucy scenes between Robbie & Nicole, leading people to speculate if they were having a fling. I was very disappointed not to see these.I don't regret buying this film, or watching it.

He finds it in the form of Russian mail-order bride Nadia (Nicole Kidman), at least until her cousin Yuri (Amelie's Matthieu Kassovitz) and his travelling partner Alexei (Vincent Cassel, recently in Irreversible) show up. Things get very ugly from there, though to explain how would start a chain of spoilers that would lead to you not having to see the movie.And despite its many problems (and they are legion, the main one being why it takes John so incredibly long to make the obvious choice), Birthday Girl is a film that is at least worth seeing. Butterworth has made a very good-looking film. This will be no surprise to fans of the work of cinematographer Oliver Stapleton, who's worked on such excellent-looking (but similarly flawed) films as The Shipping News, The Van, and The Grifters. And, really, you don't have to be an expert cinematographer to make Nicole Kidman look good anyway. Still, Stapleton's gift makes the film attractive even when Kidman isn't onscreen. The leads, despite the stupidity of their characters, play their roles with vigor (Kassovitz deserves special recognition here), making the best they can of the situation they obviously found themselves in with the script, and the action sequences are wonderfully well-done, understated in a world where ""action sequence"" has come to equate with ""lots of stuff blows up.""

703382,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000067J3P,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","Roughly one part crime drama to two parts offbeat love story, ""Birthday Girl"" is a nifty little British film that gives Nicole Kidman a chance to strut her stuff as an actress.  Here she gets to play a Russian ""mail order bride"" (though, of course, in the modern world she is actually ordered off the internet) who's come to England to start a new life with John, a mild-mannered banker unsuccessful in the ways of love.  John is one of those bland, utterly undistinguished ""good guys"" who everyone seems to like but no one seems to notice.  Even his boss at the bank gives him one of those noncommittal job evaluations (saying what a swell guy he is and what a great way he has with people) used to fob people off when they are not good enough to merit a raise or a more prestigious position in the corporation.  Forced to go the unconventional route in finding himself a wife, John hooks up with the lovely but inscrutable Nadia, a Russian woman who, John is appalled to learn, does not understand a word of English.  Then just as John and Nadia seem to be forming a close relationship (literally bonding over bondage), complications arise when two of Nadia's bizarre ""friends"" from Russia suddenly arrive on the scene.To reveal more of the plot would be unfair to both the viewer and the makers of this film, since much of the movie's intrigue arises from the frequent turnabouts in the plot itself.  Although there is always the threat of violence hammering at the film's edges, writers Tom and Jez Butterworth (the latter serving as the film's director as well), manage to keep the film fairly havoc free while they focus on the developing relationship between the two main characters.  Kidman, who speaks nary a word of English in the first half of the film (and only with a heavy accent thereafter), does a beautiful job conveying both the toughness and the vulnerability inherent in this woman.  Though innately compassionate, Nadia has had to learn how to survive in a brutal world - even if that means having to exploit nave, good-natured shmucks like John.  As John, Ben Chaplin conveys just the right mixture of shyness, befuddlement and ultimate self-assuredness to make us root for the character.  Because of his Everyman characteristics, we want to see John triumph in the end.""Birthday Girl"" doesn't try to push the envelope by indulging in elaborate action scenes or patently theatrical heroics.  Its events seem to unravel in a spontaneous, naturalistic manner, which helps the film to remain relatively true to life most of the time.  It tells an unusual story, one filled with wry humor, understated suspense and a compassionate recognition of human frailty.

The movie stars Nicole Kidman (as Nadia; The Interpreter; The Stepford Wives; Dead Calm), Ben Chaplin (John Buckingham; Murder by Numbers; The Thin Red Line), Vincent Cassel (Alexi; Ocean's Twelve; Shrek), & Mathieu Kassovitz (Yuri; Amen; The Fifth Element).  The movie was written by Tom & Jez Butterworth.  The director is Jez Butterworth, and my 2004 movie guide notes that this is Butterworh's only movie as director, though IMDb.com notes that Jez is also the director for the 1997 Mojo.The movie is about Ben Chaplin's character (John Buckingham), a British banker, purchasing a Russian mail-order bride (Nicole Kidman, Nadia) and getting more than he expected, especially when two Russians turn up on Nadia's birthday.The movie opens somewhat slowly with Buckingham trying to make a web-video and scanning a Russian mail-order bride website (From Russia with Love).  Twenty million English girls on his small island but he is from a small town and very busy, so he must look elsewhere.  Immediately after the opening sequence, Buckingham picks up Nadia from the airport, and learns quickly that she can't speak much English beyond ""Yes"" and doesn't understand English either. Buckingham is, understandably, annoyed because he was under the impression that she could speak English, which is important because he doesn't speak Russian.  Buckingham attempts to get in touch with the mail-order place and attempts to send back Nadia.  Nadia attempts to dissuade his idea through offering her body.  While at work, Nadia finds his porn collection, which seems to involve a lot of bondage like activity.  When John comes home from work, he gives Nadia a Russian-English dictionary, and Nadia gives him a stack of bondage magazines, then latter begins to tie herself up on the bed (they have ""fun"" with this type of activity several times).  The movie slowly movies forward, time passes, though it is unclear how much time.  The movie finally starts to pick up pace again when two Russians show up on Nadia's birthday.  Well, I spoke to soon, it still is quite slow.  The movie finally picks up after John asks the two Russians to leave and one the Russians goes somewhat insane and gets rough and demands money.  The movie turns into a crime drama and continues for some time.My 2004 Mick Martin & Marsha Porter movie guide gives the movie 3 stars out of 5.  I would probably give the movie a similar rating (if for no other reason than because there are too many scenes in Russian without translation, though that might have been my own fault as I turned off the closed caption when the movie started and the closed caption was in Spanish).",3,"Ok movie, not as good as it could have been",1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,2832,"['R-rated', 'movie', 'sexuality', 'language', '~90', 'mins', 'long', 'nudity', 'limited', 'shots', 'back', '.The', 'DVD', 'Scenes', 'Featurette', 'Music', 'Video', 'film', 'movie', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Nadia', 'Interpreter', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'John', 'Buckingham', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Alexi', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'Shrek', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'Yuri', 'Amen', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'Tom', 'Jez', 'Butterworth', 'director', 'Jez', 'Butterworth', '2004', 'movie', 'guide', 'Butterworh', 'only', 'movie', 'director', 'IMDb.com', 'notes', 'Jez', 'also', 'director', '1997', 'Mojo.The', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'character', 'John', 'Buckingham', 'British', 'banker', 'purchasing', 'Russian', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Nadia', 'getting', 'more', 'expected', 'especially', 'when', 'two', 'Russians', 'turn', 'up', 'Nadia', 'birthday.The', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'slowly', 'Buckingham', 'trying', 'make', 'web-video', 'scanning', 'Russian', 'mail-order', 'website', 'Russia', 'Love', 'Twenty', 'million', 'English', 'girls', 'small', 'island', 'small', 'town', 'very', 'busy', 'must', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Immediately', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Buckingham', 'up', 'Nadia', 'airport', 'quickly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'much', 'English', 'Yes', ""n't"", 'understand', 'English', 'Buckingham', 'understandably', 'annoyed', 'was', 'impression', 'could', 'speak', 'English', 'important', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Russian', 'Buckingham', 'get', 'touch', 'mail-order', 'place', 'attempts', 'send', 'back', 'Nadia', 'Nadia', 'dissuade', 'idea', 'offering', 'body', 'work', 'Nadia', 'porn', 'collection', 'involve', 'lot', 'bondage', 'activity', 'When', 'John', 'home', 'work', 'Nadia', 'Russian-English', 'dictionary', 'Nadia', 'stack', 'bondage', 'magazines', 'then', 'latter', 'tie', 'up', 'bed', 'have', 'fun', 'type', 'activity', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'slowly', 'movies', 'forward', 'time', 'passes', 'unclear', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'movie', 'finally', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'again', 'when', 'two', 'Russians', 'show', 'up', 'Nadia', 'birthday', 'Well', 'spoke', 'soon', 'still', 'quite', 'slow', 'movie', 'finally', 'up', 'John', 'two', 'Russians', 'leave', 'one', 'Russians', 'somewhat', 'insane', 'rough', 'money', 'movie', 'crime', 'drama', 'time.My', '2004', 'Mick', 'Martin', 'Marsha', 'Porter', 'movie', 'guide', 'movie', '3', 'stars', '5', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'movie', 'similar', 'rating', 'other', 'reason', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'Russian', 'translation', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'own', 'fault', 'turned', 'off', 'closed', 'caption', 'when', 'movie', 'started', 'closed', 'caption', 'was', 'Spanish']",N/A

Then, you get tired of your uneventful life, with no prospect of promotion or finding a new love around you.Ben Chaplin's character John, inspite of his better judgment, orders a Russian bride on the Internet.  Her name is Nadia, who arrives at airport as beautiful Nicole Kidman (perfectly in character).  Of course, John is delighted to meet her, but despite what was written on the site, Nadia cannot speak English at all.

And with the arrival of those two unwelcome people, John's happy life changes into a nightmare, full of dangers and suspense.Some sources may categorize ""Birthday Girl"" as thriller, but the fact is the film is more like a farce surrounding the character of John and Nadia.  It has a romantic side, which is sometimes very touching, but the film itself should be called a downbeat, understated romantic comedy.  There are some potentially violent elements, but director knows how to handle them with care, not letting them hinder us from appreciating the best part of the film: femme fatale image of Nicole Kidman.As you may imagine, ""Birthday Girl"" is Nicole Kidman's film.  Her performance as Russian girl Nadia is alone worth watching; however, which means, when she isn't on the screen, the film gets weaker even though the efforts of three good male actors.  The story is often sluggish and predictable, but as long as you love the character of Nicole (or are a great fan of her), ""Birthaday Girl"" will be immensely interesting.",3,If Nicole Is a Femme Fatale Mail-Ordered from Russia...,1041379200,"01 1, 2003",2003,2025,"['Suppose', 'are', 'living', 'St.', 'Albans', 'peaceful', 'suburb', 'England', 'where', 'nothing', 'likely', 'happen', 'working', 'small', 'office', 'bank', 'leading', 'routine', 'life', 'just', 'Ben', 'Chaplin', 'Birthday', 'Girl', 'Then', 'get', 'tired', 'uneventful', 'life', 'prospect', 'promotion', 'finding', 'new', 'love', 'you.Ben', 'Chaplin', 'character', 'John', 'inspite', 'better', 'judgment', 'orders', 'Russian', 'bride', 'Internet', 'name', 'Nadia', 'who', 'airport', 'beautiful', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'perfectly', 'character', 'course', 'John', 'delighted', 'meet', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'site', 'Nadia', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'English', 'Not', 'only', 'chainsmoking', 'car.But', 'anyway', 'John', 'love', 'Nadia', 'who', 'as', 'sexy', 'Satine', 'Paris', 'later', 'arrive', 'pair', 'uninvited', 'guests', 'Russia', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Crimson', 'River', 'Matthieu', 'Kassovitz', 'Amelie', 'guys', 'are', 'claim', 'old', 'aquaintances', 'Nadia', 'who', 'not', 'unhappy', 'meet', 'again', 'arrival', 'two', 'unwelcome', 'people', 'John', 'happy', 'life', 'changes', 'nightmare', 'full', 'dangers', 'suspense.Some', 'sources', 'may', 'categorize', 'Birthday', 'Girl', 'thriller', 'fact', 'film', 'more', 'farce', 'surrounding', 'character', 'John', 'Nadia', 'romantic', 'side', 'sometimes', 'very', 'touching', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'downbeat', 'understated', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'are', 'potentially', 'violent', 'elements', 'director', 'how', 'handle', 'care', 'not', 'letting', 'hinder', 'appreciating', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'femme', 'fatale', 'image', 'Nicole', 'Kidman.As', 'may', 'imagine', 'Birthday', 'Girl', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'film', 'performance', 'Russian', 'girl', 'Nadia', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'however', 'when', ""n't"", 'screen', 'film', 'weaker', 'even', 'efforts', 'three', 'good', 'male', 'actors', 'story', 'often', 'sluggish', 'predictable', 'as', 'long', 'love', 'character', 'Nicole', 'are', 'great', 'fan', 'Birthaday', 'Girl', 'will', 'be', 'immensely', 'interesting']",N/A

The fact that this simply could not have happened as shown detracts from any credibility the film could have had. You can NOT simply order a woman over the internet like you buy a book! Neither the USA or England will give a woman a [fiance'] visa unless the man first visits her in her country,  establishes a real relationship with her & can doccument this to immigration authorities satisfaction.As someone who did VISIT Russia and later marry a Russian, I know the facts! ""Mail order brides"" are just a figment of someone's imagination [maybe jealous feminists?] Yes there are agencies who will introduce you & forward your emails to a woman or women but the rest is up to you and her to decide. And NO it would not be possible to bring someone to your country unless they spoke some English! Even movies should be somewhat accurate--this is NOT!I watched it again with my Russian wife and she was livid! She said it makes all Russians into criminals and all Brits as stupider than a box of rocks! She gave it a -5 stars! That's right negative rating. Kidman should have passed on this one & they should have hired a real Russian woman if they wanted to portray a Russian--even this badly!",1,Get real!
