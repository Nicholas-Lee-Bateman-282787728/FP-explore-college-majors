1432415,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B004XKVQKQ,F. S. L'hoir,"[74, 75]","The BBC has struck it rich with this riveting detective series! Although I have not read the Michael Dibdin mysteries, and I therefore cannot say how faithful the series is to the books, I have spent nine memorable years in Rome, and I can assure viewers that as far as the locations and settings of Rome and its environs are concerned, ""Zen"" can be graded d'oro puro--pure gold.The mostly British cast are at their usual best, and if the aristocratic English and slightly regional accents among the police detectives strikes an odd note at first (add to that mix the Italian accent of Caterina Murino), one soon becomes so absorbed in the story that the anomaly becomes unimportant. The mixture of British accents is analogous to what would be the mixture of university-educated detectives and the Italian version of police constables, a condition that would be lost with pseudo-Italian accents, no matter how well done, especially considering that Zen, convincingly acted by Rufus Sewell, is a Venetian. The sense of verisimilitude is maintained by extras shouting at each other every now and then in Italian (Rome is a very noisy city). The sound is especially good, down to the two-note police siren which goes flat by several keys with the doppler effect as the car passes by and heads off into the distance.The carefully crafted plots of these crime stories hold political overtones, which, even though the books were written in the 'eighties and 'nineties, seem equally valid today, as little changes in a city where patronage and politics (and, unfortunately, the criminal underworld) have been walking hand-in-hand for over 2000 years--so long that the very boundaries between the spheres have become blurred. The scene which portrays Zen calling a friend who knows someone, who knows someone else, who can get an elegant apartment rent-free, rings so true that one knows that Mr. Dibdin has actually lived in Rome, where one does not get an apartment by looking in the classifieds but by knowing someone who knows someone else [This timeless state of affairs was parodied in an Italian comedy in which Nino Manfredi played a reluctant hit-man, who outsourced the job, calling his brother-in-law, who called his cousin, who called his son-in-law, who called his lawyer, who called . . ., etc., etc., so that the dastardly deed never got done (much to the merriment of the Italian audience).].The camera takes Aurelio Zen (and us) into the great chambers of the grand country villas as well as the dense laurel forests, underground caves, and crystal pools of Lazio, in scenes that had me holding my breath as Zen is forced to dive under water (The ghastly possibility of losing a flashlight is one that I once envisioned as I was escorted down to one of the lower galleries of the catacombs of San Sebastiano to view a third-century sarcophagus). The camera also allows us to follow Zen as he walks along the narrow cobbled streets and up the sweeping staircases into the forty-foot ceilinged frescoed rooms of apartments of palazzi built in the Renaissance--impossible to replicate in a studio--grand buildings, the faades of which are sadly marred by twenty-first century gang graffiti. Even though when Zen tells the driver to turn on the Via del Corso, and the car turns into Viale di Trastevere--on the other side of the Tiber--it doesn't matter in the least! It is the ambience that is important, not the exact route or the fact that the street might be one-way in the opposite direction. As the camera shows Zen leaning against a doorjamb of pitted travertine, or it lingers on Zen sipping an espresso, we are there with him. One can almost smell and taste that divine coffee, which, to me, recalls the essence of Rome!P.S. I just learned on the other side of the Pond that the Beeb has cancelled the series--no doubt, their 'swingeing' budget cuts. Not only is it expensive to film in Rome, but it is also chaotic working under the threat of strikes, which occur constantly.PSST!

He is simply wonderful as Detective Aurelio Zen.  In this gorgeously filmed (in Italy) British mystery/detective thriller, Rufus Sewell is brilliant as a rather dense appearing and not ""taking it all in"" detective but coming across as a very nice person that in actuality does indeed ""get it"" and doggedly tries to get at the truth no matter the dangers he may encounter.  He does indeed encounter some horrendous situations (e.g., being stuck in a very tight cave with rushing water below him and guns being aimed above him by nasty thugs plus always dealing with an insufferable boss and some very crooked ""higher-ups"" and ""not too nice"" powerful people).  Throughout it all, Rufus, as Zen remains very debonair, suave and ""cool"".

1432417,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004XKVQKQ,Grady Harp,"[35, 36]","ZEN debuted last night on PBS and if the opening episode is any indication of things to come, then we have a delightful summer delicacy on hand.  The series takes place in Rome and features a detective known for his integrity, a Venetian by the name of Zen (Aurelio Zen) played with understated classy style by Rufus Sewell.  Zen, who lives with his mother (Catherine Spaak) after his crumbled marriage is involved in defining the responsibility for some murders in the past which happen to mimic some recent murders - and in the complex process we discover that the Italian government wants to engage him on one side of the investigation while another somewhat shady source engages his for the opposite legal decision.  There is plenty action and suspense and the uncovering of secrets about the house where the most recent murders took place - a mansion undermined with tunnels and caves and rapidly flowing rivers where a strange young girl Silvia (Cariddi Nardulli) hides from a society that has abused her.  Zen perseveres in his intelligent search for facts, a search that happens to include some beautiful photography of the Italian countryside, a romantic interest in the form of the beautiful Tania (Caterina Morino) who is being pursued by the entire office of Zen's workplace, especially by one Vincenzo Fabri (Ed Stoppard),  a team of bad buys out for vengeance against the police, and a host of other characters who suggest avenues this series may take.The cast is sterling though for the most part unexplainably British in this Italian set drama  (Stanley Townsend, Ben Miles, Francesco Quinn, Anthony Higgins, Garry Cooper, Adrian Schiller and Cosima Shaw)  but the key to the success of this series is the solid work by Rufus Sewell.

Teslovich,"[2, 10]","Whomever researched for the writing and/or scripting of this series doesn't know anything about police administration or detective work e.g. the tte-&agrave;-tte in the police offices and elsewhere were ridiculously unbelievable if not sophomoric. The detective's failure to intelligently think through or anticipate problems including threats were just plain dumb. Even if he is intended to succeed through dumb luck it's still dumb. The acting is wooden (except Sewell has those mannerisms that in a primal communicative way can carry a scene but still a step down from his exceptional Dark City role).

1432419,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B004XKVQKQ,Happy Reader,"[2, 3]","I bought this DVD set without having seen ""Zen"" on TV, going by the reviews. I've also never read any of the mysteries on which this series is based, so I had no preconceptions.I had a free Saturday, and I sat down and watched all three episodes one after the other. I was not particularly impressed, and if I had written a review after that first viewing, I would have given it three stars. For me it is stylish and stylized, and took a little getting used to:1. Although there's a lot of plusses [or pluses, the dictionary accepts both and I can never make up my mind] to the ""Zen"" series, I was put off by Aurelio Zen's mannerisms - the twitchings!2. The plotting wasn't as clear cut as it could be. Characters could seem cariacaturish.3. I understand why a series filmed in Italy by a British production company would use English actors with no attempt to create Italian accents, as the fake accents could easily turn into bad Marlon Brando impersonations. Though Rufus Sewell, as Zen, doesn't sound too strange, Ben Miles, as the amoral Amedeo Colonna has enough upper crust-like intonation that it kept reminding me he was English pretending to be Italian. Vincent Riotta, who plays Zen's coworker, Giorgio di Angelis, is English, but born of Italian immigrants. He speaks fluent Italian. But if I'm remembering it correctly, he starts off with a bit of an Italian accent, and by the end of the third episode, he's speaking broad English.Three months after watching the series the first time, I had decided to give the set away, when I thought, well, let's watch it again. So I did, and the second time this series grew on me. I could still do without the twitching, but this time maybe I immersed myself a little more. I enjoyed it enough to give it four stars. And I kept the set.The stories are a little bleak - everyone Zen runs into, criminal and not, seems to lack happiness. It's not as bleak as Kenneth Branaugh's ""Wallander"" series, but there's a definite air of detachment, of everyone out for himself. Mostly this is because political maneuvering is everpresent. This by no means makes it a bad series, but it's not my favorite type of mystery series.The sun in the series is the incredibly beautiful Tania Moretti, played by Caterina Murino, a genuine Italian with a profile to die for. She lights up the screen as she lights up Zen. But even she is taken away from Zen, though the series ends on an up note.And speaking of notes, the theme music is quite haunting. The locations are frequently stunning, Italian villas and public places of great beauty.You get 265 minutes of mystery in this set. Worth a look, though you may be like me, and need a little time to appreciate it.////////////////////Note: In February 2012, BBC has announced that they are not making any more ""Zen"".",4,"BBC Announced No More ""ZEN"" - This is all you get!",1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,2799,"['bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'having', 'seen', 'Zen', 'TV', 'going', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'also', 'never', 'read', 'mysteries', 'series', 'based', 'had', 'preconceptions.I', 'had', 'free', 'Saturday', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'three', 'episodes', 'one', 'other', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'had', 'written', 'review', 'first', 'viewing', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'three', 'stars', 'stylish', 'stylized', 'took', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'to:1', 'lot', 'plusses', '[', 'pluses', 'dictionary', 'accepts', 'can', 'never', 'make', 'up', 'mind', ']', 'Zen', 'series', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'Aurelio', 'Zen', 'mannerisms', 'twitchings', '2', 'plotting', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'cut', 'could', 'be', 'Characters', 'could', 'seem', 'cariacaturish.3', 'understand', 'why', 'series', 'filmed', 'Italy', 'British', 'production', 'company', 'would', 'use', 'English', 'actors', 'attempt', 'create', 'Italian', 'accents', 'fake', 'accents', 'could', 'easily', 'turn', 'bad', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'impersonations', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Zen', ""n't"", 'sound', 'too', 'strange', 'Ben', 'Miles', 'amoral', 'Amedeo', 'Colonna', 'enough', 'upper', 'crust-like', 'intonation', 'kept', 'reminding', 'was', 'English', 'pretending', 'be', 'Italian', 'Vincent', 'Riotta', 'who', 'Zen', 'coworker', 'Giorgio', 'di', 'Angelis', 'English', 'born', 'Italian', 'immigrants', 'fluent', 'Italian', ""'m"", 'remembering', 'correctly', 'bit', 'Italian', 'accent', 'end', 'third', 'episode', 'speaking', 'broad', 'English.Three', 'months', 'watching', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'decided', 'give', 'set', 'away', 'when', 'thought', 'well', 'let', 'watch', 'again', 'did', 'second', 'time', 'series', 'grew', 'could', 'still', 'do', 'twitching', 'time', 'maybe', 'immersed', 'little', 'more', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'kept', 'set.The', 'stories', 'are', 'little', 'bleak', 'everyone', 'Zen', 'criminal', 'not', 'lack', 'happiness', 'not', 'as', 'bleak', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'Wallander', 'series', 'definite', 'air', 'detachment', 'everyone', 'Mostly', 'because', 'political', 'maneuvering', 'everpresent', 'means', 'bad', 'series', 'not', 'favorite', 'type', 'mystery', 'series.The', 'sun', 'series', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'Tania', 'Moretti', 'played', 'Caterina', 'Murino', 'genuine', 'Italian', 'profile', 'die', 'screen', 'up', 'Zen', 'even', 'taken', 'away', 'Zen', 'series', 'up', 'note.And', 'speaking', 'notes', 'theme', 'music', 'quite', 'haunting', 'locations', 'are', 'frequently', 'stunning', 'Italian', 'villas', 'public', 'places', 'great', 'beauty.You', 'get', '265', 'minutes', 'mystery', 'set', 'look', 'may', 'be', 'need', 'little', 'time', 'appreciate', 'it.////////////////////Note', 'February', '2012', 'BBC', 'announced', 'are', 'not', 'making', 'more', 'Zen']",Zen: Vendetta / Cabal / Ratking

Zen is the name of an Italian police officer who is radically different than his colleagues by being honest. He does not, for example, place evidence at crime scenes to incriminate innocent people, and he does not lie. His name Zen is supposedly a Venician name, but it also conjures up ideas about his character, his casual manner, dispassion, nonchalance. The word ""vendetta"" suggests the desire for revenge against the corrupt Italian police system.In this episode, a man claiming that he had been railroaded by the legal system and sentenced and imprisoned for murder kills the judge who sentenced him. Then another official is killed. A colleague of Zen had investigated this second murder and overlooked some evidence, such as the missing gun. Zen became involved at the end of the investigative process. A man who was seen leaving the crime scene moments after the murder admits that he was the killer. Now, he says he was forced to make the confession and is innocent.Zen's boss tells him to reinvestigate the crime and make sure he proves the confessor's guilt. However, political officials tell him to prove that the man is innocent because a trial will reveal information that is better kept secret. Zen, of course, can't accept either approach. His way is to avoid such corrupt methods and find the truth.

1432423,A28YDMI499J1X9,B004XKVQKQ,J. Janssen,"[3, 3]","Being a fan of Michael Dibdin's Aurelio Zen stories I purchased this set  a couple years ago anticipating a lengthy ongoing series. Unfortunately that didn't come to fruition and the films now have to be looked at as a stand-alone trilogy culled from three of his best selling novel's.The films were an expensive (over budget and deadline) project to put together and probably disappointed many Dibdin fans looking for the multiple story threads and nuanced characters he was known for.  Rome is notoriously difficult to film on location as the government refuses to close off streets for film crews and all it takes is one yahoo mugging for the camera to ruin 5 hours of prep work which undoubtedly contributed to the cost over runs.  Finally, timing wasn't ideal to embark on such an ambitious project as the UK was mired in recession and North America's PBS was looking more toward properties that they could influence to better target audience demographics.*  While perfectly suited for a rainy afternoon viewing, potential customers should be aware that Dibdin wrote layered novels with numerous subplots and dozens of characters that don't easily convert into 90 minute screenplays.  And while these episodes bear some resemblance to the novels, at best they can be considered ""Zen-lite"".Having said all that, these are still 3 very enjoyable films and bear positive comparison to several Cary Grant theatrical releases of the 1960's.  Rufus Sewell and Caterina Murino are about as sexy and stylish a couple as one could ask for, and both come with a fair amount of onscreen baggage that makes their lives as murky as the plots.  The 3 films fall somewhere between police drama and romantic comedy, managing to retain the best of both genre. The cinematography is stellar and if you've never been to Rome you'll probably have to physically restrain yourself from booking a flight by the time ""Ratking's"" closing credits roll.  While not what I had hoped for given the quality of the source material, the set is still eminently enjoyable as escapist fare with a top notch cast, stylish settings and stunning visuals of one of the most compelling cities in the world.  AND, there's enough of each novel's plot left to pull it all together as a coherent cinematic trilogy.*  ""Masterpiece Mystery"" was created as a production entity to provide material that would (hopefully) bring PBS a wider audience than it had previously enjoyed.  While they still purchase extant programming under syndication agreements, they increasingly co-produce projects that allow them to better target certain demographics traditionally missing from their audience.  The predecessor, ""PBS Mystery!"" on the other hand was developed by member station WGBH as a hosted venue to showcase existing UK television properties. Other than occasional ham fisted editing and over zealous censoring PBS Mystery programming was identical to that broadcast in the UK home market.",4,"Enjoyable, but Zen-lite",1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,2947,"['Being', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Dibdin', 'Aurelio', 'Zen', 'stories', 'purchased', 'set', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'anticipating', 'lengthy', 'ongoing', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'fruition', 'films', 'now', 'have', 'be', 'looked', 'stand-alone', 'trilogy', 'culled', 'three', 'best', 'selling', ""novel's.The"", 'films', 'were', 'expensive', 'budget', 'deadline', 'project', 'put', 'together', 'probably', 'disappointed', 'many', 'Dibdin', 'fans', 'looking', 'multiple', 'story', 'threads', 'nuanced', 'characters', 'was', 'known', 'Rome', 'notoriously', 'difficult', 'film', 'location', 'government', 'close', 'off', 'streets', 'film', 'crews', 'one', 'yahoo', 'mugging', 'camera', 'ruin', '5', 'hours', 'prep', 'work', 'undoubtedly', 'contributed', 'cost', 'runs', 'Finally', 'timing', 'was', ""n't"", 'ideal', 'embark', 'ambitious', 'project', 'UK', 'was', 'mired', 'recession', 'North', 'America', 'PBS', 'was', 'looking', 'more', 'properties', 'could', 'influence', 'better', 'target', 'audience', 'demographics', '*', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'viewing', 'potential', 'customers', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'Dibdin', 'wrote', 'layered', 'novels', 'numerous', 'subplots', 'dozens', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'easily', 'convert', '90', 'minute', 'screenplays', 'episodes', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'novels', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'Zen-lite', '.Having', 'said', 'are', 'still', '3', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'bear', 'positive', 'comparison', 'several', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'theatrical', 'releases', '1960', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Caterina', 'Murino', 'are', 'sexy', 'stylish', 'couple', 'one', 'could', 'ask', 'come', 'fair', 'amount', 'onscreen', 'baggage', 'lives', 'as', 'murky', 'plots', '3', 'films', 'fall', 'somewhere', 'police', 'drama', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'managing', 'retain', 'best', 'genre', 'cinematography', 'stellar', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Rome', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'physically', 'restrain', 'booking', 'flight', 'time', 'Ratking', 'closing', 'credits', 'roll', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'given', 'quality', 'source', 'material', 'set', 'still', 'eminently', 'enjoyable', 'escapist', 'fare', 'top', 'notch', 'cast', 'stylish', 'settings', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'cities', 'world', 'enough', 'novel', 'plot', 'left', 'pull', 'together', 'coherent', 'cinematic', 'trilogy', '*', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'was', 'created', 'production', 'entity', 'provide', 'material', 'would', 'hopefully', 'bring', 'PBS', 'wider', 'audience', 'had', 'previously', 'enjoyed', 'still', 'purchase', 'extant', 'programming', 'syndication', 'agreements', 'increasingly', 'co-produce', 'projects', 'allow', 'better', 'target', 'certain', 'demographics', 'traditionally', 'missing', 'audience', 'predecessor', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'developed', 'member', 'station', 'WGBH', 'hosted', 'venue', 'showcase', 'existing', 'UK', 'television', 'properties', 'Other', 'occasional', 'ham', 'fisted', 'editing', 'zealous', 'censoring', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'programming', 'was', 'identical', 'broadcast', 'UK', 'home', 'market']",Zen: Vendetta / Cabal / Ratking

Well, unfortunately, the opening credits of the series screamed ""cheesy"" -- the retro graphics and the music recall the ""swinging coolness"" of the early 1960's spy movies. That was NOT what I was expecting and I began to worry about what was in store.  I'm still puzzled by the intro, because it IN NO WAY heralds the excellence of what comes next.  It seems to be a complete anomaly, for the series is thoughtful, very well acted, full of the essence of Rome, subtle and clever. There is only one other, tiny blip to the production. Catarina Murino is well cast as Aurelio Zen's love interest, but she's the only Italian actor in a leading role -- everyone else is British with very British accents in evidence.  The contrast between her accent and everyone else's is a bit jarring initially, but the acting is of such quality that it soon overcomes this ""disconnect."" Initially, I was surprised at the choice of Rufus Sewell as Zen.  He's certainly a fine actor but one I so connote with historical costume dramas (my bias, I admit it), that I simply never thought him as being the first casting choice. Well, I was wrong about that -- he embodies Zen and plays his role with fine-tuned subtlety and complete credibility.  A wonderful choice.

He is known for his integrity and incorruptibility, and in an interesting twist--this is both his greatest asset and his biggest liability. Getting assigned various high profile cases, Zen is also juggling departmental games, shady politics, and a new romantic entanglement. And it is this balance of elements, along with some larger governmental conspiracies and unnamed power players, that bring a refreshing depth to the more ordinary crime solving. The Season consists of only three episodes.Vendetta: Things get rolling in perhaps the least solid episode (for me anyway). Character introductions vie for time with a plot line that has Zen investigating a case where an innocent man has been charged with multiple murders at a country estate. In addition, an assassin with a personal grudge is also on Zen's trail unbeknownst to the detective. Of course, these two elements will combine into one deadly showdown. It's fun enough, if a bit convenient. A large chunk of time is also spent developing Zen's romantic affair with a new office worker, and this detracted from the main action.Cabal: With all the introductions out of the way and the romantic angle having settled into a comfortable groove, I absolutely loved this episode. Investigating an apparent suicide, Zen learns that the dead man was blackmailing a powerful criminal organization with many high-profile members. Was it murder or suicide? Getting an assist from a mysterious insider, Zen gets in too deep. But just what is real and what is imagined and does it matter? I really enjoyed the conspiracy theories and twisty nature of this particular story.Ratking: Zen must contend with a new boss who dismisses him as a glory seeker. But still Zen is brought in by high ranking forces to cope with the kidnapping of an influential businessman. Dealing with the family and the kidnappers, it seems everyone has an individual agenda. Zen's sense of propriety is pushed further and further with his involvement to the power elite. Everything is balanced well in this episode, and this is the funniest entry. I particularly liked the ending.All of Zen's cases are twisty and interesting, but nothing about the actual crimes differentiates this program from dozens of other detective choices littering the television landscape. Sewell, for me, is a primary selling point of ""Zen."" Subtle and understated, I appreciated that the program allowed him to underplay the role. He gets to the heart of matters seemingly by accident with this more subdued approach. Ben Miles as an enigmatic politico and Ed Stoppard as a privileged co-worker also stood out, but the entire cast delivers. Droll humor and lovely Italian locales further distinguish this tale. If you like exotic mysteries, this is an easy recommendation. It might not break new ground, but it is solidly constructed and an entertaining diversion. Vendetta was 3 1/2 stars, Cabal was 4 1/2 stars, and Ratking comes in at a solid 4 stars. Check it out!

1432432,A1NIS5QFY6KCT7,B004XKVQKQ,Mike the Geology Teacher,"[0, 0]","Aurelio Zen is a fictional Italian detective, (played by actor Rufus Sewell) created by the British crime writer Michael Dibdin. The stories aren't just set in Rome, but the city itself is practically a co-star of the series. If you've ever been to Italy...or if you want to go to Italy...you'll want to see these three films if only the background scenery. This movie wasn't filmed in a studio.The series consists of three stories based on three of Dibdin's novels...Ratking (1988), Vendetta (1990) and Cabal (1992). In Each story Sewell plays a clever but honest detective Aurelio Zen. Zen repeatedly finds himself drawn into politically sensitive investigations. In each case his commanding officer demands that he take a specific course of action and achive a quick result, while top ministers in the government secretly demand that Zen do the opposite. The poor deticteve repeately finds himself in a situation where his career will be ruined if he follows either set of demands. So through pluck, luck and a bit of cleverness he works his way through the clues to find a solution that serves both justice and his minders.As great as the locations and scenery of the movies are, the writing and acting are first rate. Most movie adaptations of novels feel like something is missing. Not the Zen stories. The writing in increadibly tight and the dialogue crisp yet understated. Rufus Sewell does a masterful job playing Zen. A lot of his best acting is done with a minimum of words, making key points with subtle expressions. The cast is mostly British, and the British accents take some getting used to. But having actors speak English with thick Italian accents would have sounded rediculous.Hopefully the BBC will come to its senses and bring this cast and crew back together for some more episodes of Zen.",5,Bring Back Zen!,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,1813,"['Aurelio', 'Zen', 'fictional', 'Italian', 'detective', 'played', 'actor', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'created', 'British', 'crime', 'writer', 'Michael', 'Dibdin', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'set', 'Rome', 'city', 'practically', 'co-star', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'Italy', 'want', 'go', 'Italy', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'three', 'films', 'only', 'background', 'scenery', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'filmed', 'studio.The', 'series', 'three', 'stories', 'based', 'three', 'Dibdin', 'novels', 'Ratking', '1988', 'Vendetta', '1990', 'Cabal', '1992', 'story', 'Sewell', 'clever', 'honest', 'detective', 'Aurelio', 'Zen', 'Zen', 'repeatedly', 'drawn', 'politically', 'sensitive', 'investigations', 'case', 'commanding', 'officer', 'demands', 'take', 'specific', 'course', 'action', 'achive', 'quick', 'result', 'top', 'ministers', 'government', 'secretly', 'demand', 'Zen', 'do', 'opposite', 'poor', 'deticteve', 'repeately', 'situation', 'where', 'career', 'will', 'be', 'ruined', 'set', 'demands', 'So', 'pluck', 'luck', 'bit', 'cleverness', 'way', 'clues', 'find', 'solution', 'justice', 'minders.As', 'great', 'locations', 'scenery', 'movies', 'are', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Most', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'novels', 'feel', 'something', 'missing', 'Not', 'Zen', 'stories', 'writing', 'increadibly', 'tight', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'yet', 'understated', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'masterful', 'job', 'playing', 'Zen', 'lot', 'best', 'acting', 'done', 'minimum', 'words', 'making', 'key', 'points', 'subtle', 'expressions', 'cast', 'mostly', 'British', 'British', 'accents', 'take', 'getting', 'used', 'having', 'actors', 'speak', 'English', 'thick', 'Italian', 'accents', 'would', 'have', 'sounded', 'rediculous.Hopefully', 'BBC', 'will', 'come', 'senses', 'bring', 'cast', 'crew', 'back', 'together', 'more', 'episodes', 'Zen']",Zen: Vendetta / Cabal / Ratking
1432433,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B004XKVQKQ,mirasreviews,"[7, 8]","BBC One cancelled ""Zen"" after one season, but we can enjoy it while it lasted. This story of a relatively ethical Roman police detective, based on the novels of Michael Dibdin, who tends to find himself caught between the highbrow corruption of the Interior Ministry, the lowbrow corruption of his colleagues, and his obligation to pursue justice is more entertaining and less reliant on far-fetched plotting than the BBC's ""Wallander"" or ITV's ""Inspector Lewis"". It's pretty good by the standards of contemporary mystery series, and it offers the added exoticism of being filmed on location in Rome -though some may lament the preponderance of British actors. All three 90-minute episodes were adapted by Simon Burke. I have not read the books, but the consensus seems to be that the plots have been considerably simplified.Aurelio Zen (Rufus Sewell) is a homicide detective in Rome, where the public speaks openly of corruption in government and the police force. Zen has become known as a ""maverick with a reputation for integrity"", almost in spite of himself. Ironically, the Interior Ministry seems to think Zen's squeaky clean image will serve their purposes well and appropriates the reluctant detective to sort out the most delicate murder scandals. Zen's boss says that ""compromise isn't always corruption; flexibility isn't always dishonesty"", but that isn't helpful when Zen is forced to balance competing interests. He often seems bemused at the corrupt scheming around him, but the only thing he can do is his job -find the killers. Zen's flirtation with his boss' secretary Tania (Caterina Murino) adds some romance, and this is a strong, appealing role for Rufus Sewell. The episodes are:""Vendetta"" finds Zen as both pursuer and pursued. The Interior Ministry approaches the detective about an old case in which a wealthy politician Oscar Faso was murdered in the company of two prostitutes, a crime to which his business partner Renato Favelloni (Greg Wise) confessed in a drug-induced haze. Now Favelloni has retracted his confession, and the Ministry is afraid of what could be revealed at the trial. They ask Zen to break the case against Favelloni. Meanwhile, convicted murderer Tito Spadola (Peter Guinness) is seeking brutal revenge on the people who sent him to prison years ago, including Zen. Zen's misadventure with a feral young woman in the countryside is far-fetched, but ""Vendetta"" is an appealing introduction to these characters and milieu.""Cabal"" places Zen in another difficult position between doing his duty and what is asked of him by Amedeo Colonna (Ben Miles) of the Interior Ministry. The black sheep of an aristocratic family, Umberto Ruspanti, falls to his death from a Roman bridge. At first, it looks like suicide, and the Interior Ministry wants to keep it that way. But bruises to the man's face make Zen think otherwise. Evidence disappears from police headquarters, then Ruspanti's lawyer goes missing. Ambitious prosecutor Nadia Pirlo (Cosima Shaw) wants to get her hooks into the case. A man named Masimo (Hilton McRae) approaches Zen with information about a criminal political conspiracy that the dead man was going to betray. All while Zen's endless flirtation with Tania continues.""Ratking"" brings Zen a new problem in the form of his new boss, the very stern and puritanical Ernesto Heuber (Michael McElhatton), who insists that Zen is a ""glory seeker"". A prominent industrialist named Miletti is kidnapped, but the family lawyer who delivered the ransom payment is shot dead for reasons unknown. The Interior Ministry wants Zen to get Miletti back alive. Heuber has unhelpfully assigned Vincenzo Fabri (Ed Stoppard), Zen's well-connected rival at the office, to assist him. And Miletti's treacherous children Cinzia (Sarah-Jane Potts) and Silvio (Sebastian Armesto) will only benefit from their father's death. Zen's flirtation with Tania has grown into a full-blown affair that threatens to derail his career as surely as the latest mess the Ministry has dropped on him.",4,Stylish Roman Mysteries Compare Favorably to Other Contemporary Detective Series.,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,4027,"['BBC', 'One', 'cancelled', 'Zen', 'one', 'season', 'can', 'enjoy', 'lasted', 'story', 'relatively', 'ethical', 'Roman', 'police', 'detective', 'based', 'novels', 'Michael', 'Dibdin', 'who', 'find', 'caught', 'highbrow', 'corruption', 'Interior', 'Ministry', 'lowbrow', 'corruption', 'colleagues', 'obligation', 'pursue', 'justice', 'more', 'entertaining', 'less', 'reliant', 'far-fetched', 'plotting', 'BBC', 'Wallander', 'ITV', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'pretty', 'good', 'standards', 'contemporary', 'mystery', 'series', 'added', 'exoticism', 'being', 'filmed', 'location', 'Rome', 'may', 'lament', 'preponderance', 'British', 'actors', 'three', '90-minute', 'episodes', 'were', 'adapted', 'Simon', 'Burke', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'consensus', 'be', 'plots', 'have', 'been', 'considerably', 'simplified.Aurelio', 'Zen', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Rome', 'where', 'public', 'openly', 'corruption', 'government', 'police', 'force', 'Zen', 'become', 'known', 'maverick', 'reputation', 'integrity', 'almost', 'spite', 'Ironically', 'Interior', 'Ministry', 'think', 'Zen', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'image', 'will', 'serve', 'purposes', 'well', 'reluctant', 'detective', 'sort', 'out', 'most', 'delicate', 'murder', 'scandals', 'Zen', 'boss', 'compromise', ""n't"", 'always', 'corruption', 'flexibility', ""n't"", 'always', 'dishonesty', ""n't"", 'helpful', 'when', 'Zen', 'forced', 'balance', 'competing', 'interests', 'often', 'bemused', 'corrupt', 'scheming', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'job', 'killers', 'Zen', 'flirtation', 'boss', 'secretary', 'Tania', 'Caterina', 'Murino', 'romance', 'strong', 'appealing', 'role', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'episodes', 'are', 'Vendetta', 'Zen', 'pursuer', 'pursued', 'Interior', 'Ministry', 'detective', 'old', 'case', 'wealthy', 'politician', 'Oscar', 'Faso', 'was', 'murdered', 'company', 'two', 'prostitutes', 'crime', 'business', 'partner', 'Renato', 'Favelloni', 'Greg', 'Wise', 'confessed', 'drug-induced', 'haze', 'Now', 'Favelloni', 'retracted', 'confession', 'Ministry', 'afraid', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'revealed', 'trial', 'ask', 'Zen', 'break', 'case', 'Favelloni', 'Meanwhile', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'Tito', 'Spadola', 'Peter', 'Guinness', 'seeking', 'brutal', 'revenge', 'people', 'who', 'sent', 'prison', 'years', 'ago', 'including', 'Zen', 'Zen', 'misadventure', 'feral', 'young', 'woman', 'countryside', 'far-fetched', 'Vendetta', 'appealing', 'introduction', 'characters', 'milieu', 'Cabal', 'places', 'Zen', 'difficult', 'position', 'doing', 'duty', 'what', 'asked', 'Amedeo', 'Colonna', 'Ben', 'Miles', 'Interior', 'Ministry', 'black', 'sheep', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'Umberto', 'Ruspanti', 'death', 'Roman', 'bridge', 'first', 'suicide', 'Interior', 'Ministry', 'keep', 'way', 'man', 'face', 'make', 'Zen', 'think', 'otherwise', 'Evidence', 'police', 'headquarters', 'then', 'Ruspanti', 'lawyer', 'missing', 'Ambitious', 'prosecutor', 'Nadia', 'Pirlo', 'Cosima', 'Shaw', 'get', 'hooks', 'case', 'man', 'named', 'Masimo', 'Hilton', 'McRae', 'Zen', 'information', 'criminal', 'political', 'conspiracy', 'dead', 'man', 'was', 'going', 'betray', 'Zen', 'endless', 'flirtation', 'Tania', 'Ratking', 'Zen', 'new', 'problem', 'form', 'new', 'boss', 'very', 'stern', 'puritanical', 'Ernesto', 'Heuber', 'Michael', 'McElhatton', 'who', 'Zen', 'glory', 'seeker', 'prominent', 'industrialist', 'named', 'Miletti', 'kidnapped', 'family', 'lawyer', 'who', 'delivered', 'ransom', 'payment', 'shot', 'dead', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'Interior', 'Ministry', 'Zen', 'get', 'Miletti', 'back', 'alive', 'Heuber', 'unhelpfully', 'assigned', 'Vincenzo', 'Fabri', 'Ed', 'Stoppard', 'Zen', 'well-connected', 'rival', 'office', 'assist', 'Miletti', 'treacherous', 'children', 'Cinzia', 'Sarah-Jane', 'Potts', 'Silvio', 'Sebastian', 'Armesto', 'will', 'only', 'benefit', 'father', 'death', 'Zen', 'flirtation', 'Tania', 'grown', 'full-blown', 'affair', 'derail', 'career', 'as', 'surely', 'latest', 'mess', 'Ministry', 'dropped']",Zen: Vendetta / Cabal / Ratking

ROBBINS ""shirley_rw""","[2, 2]","I read some of the negative reviews and I think they were expecting a documentary on Italian police not an entertaining mystery show. This is one of the most entertaining mystery detective made for tv shows that I have ever seen. We love mysteries especially those with charming or charistmatic detectives. Rufus Sewell plays Aurelio Zen with zest, with charisma, with humor and with a flair. Sewell said he played Zen as he saw him and as he himself is, not necessarily as Zen is portrayed in the novels. I think he did an outstanding job, he was really entertaining and funny.The stories were hilarious, intriguing, interesting and especially entertaining. Aurelio Zen has phenomenal luck, an affair and throughout it all maintains his composure. His attitude is that he will do what is right and what is expected of him regardless of the consequences. But his remarkable luck brings him through each case with a success that is surprising yet hilarious. We were laughing out loud at the twists, turns, surprises and the endings.If you pay attention to minute details and expect them to be 100% correct, then certainly you should skip this series. If you pay more attention to the character, the plot (loose) and the humor, then you will like this series.
