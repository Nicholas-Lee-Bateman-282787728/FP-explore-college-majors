Think PG-13 rating. Passionate kissing but probably no longer than 5 seconds at a time and not really focused on that.......so I get what another viewer said, but I thought with proper censorship for a younger audience, it would still be good. For every movie, I would encourage parents to screen first, but love, relationships, etc are part of our lives. So if you have an older teen, I think it would be appropriate. I think St. Auggie deals with what teenagers go through. Finding something to fill a void, only to find out only God can do that. I thought it was brilliantly told, and being a huge fan of St. Auggies Confessions, etc, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. 5 star rating in my book. And the best part?!

I recommend this movie to anyone since the story is entertaining, it&#8217;s widescreen, is in color, has excellent picture and audio quality, and is in English with optional Spanish subtitles.  I was very impressed with the acting, the many different filming locations, the professional costumes, and the huge number of extras.It&#8217;s highly recommended to anyone interested in politics, public speaking, and philosophy, debating or pursuing a career as a lawyer, solicitor, priest or politician.Augustine of Hippo was a pagan, sinner and lived a life of debauchery &#8211; pride, a self-admitted slave of lust, and most interested in the praise and recognition from other people.There is also included 20 minute long -  &#8220;Who is St. Augustine&#8221; by Fr. Benedict Groeschel which is very informative and worth watching.  You may want to watch this BEFORE the movie.  Serves as a good overview that will actually help, not spoil your movie watching.Some screenplay and directorial liberties were taken;  not every scene is a 100% factual retelling of the contents of a book written by Augustine of Hippo entitled Confessions.There are two DVDs.  The second is the extended edition of the movie &#8211; 3 hours and 20 minutes.  The first DVD is the 2 hour movie with 5.1 audio.The movie starts and ends with the preparation for and the siege of the city of Hippo.  I found this to be the most boring parts of the movie.I could not fast forward or reverse the extended version of the movie; prohibited by disc.  Huh!  I could CHAPTER skip ahead or behind.Want to know more &#8211; research and read:1) Do a wikipedia search on  &#8220;St Augustine&#8221;  you will find info from various sources on the life of this person, his &#8220;Confessions&#8221; and more2) Confessions  [ Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 55-5021.

(50 Books &#8230;4) Augustine of Hippo: A Biography by Peter Brown (History professor Princeton U)I was disappointed certain facts were not accurately portrayed.1) As one would expect from a man who had studied much, his conversion took years.2) Spoiler: His concubine is shown leaving him.  He left her in the year 385 because he was to be engaged to a rich woman.3) He had to wait two years until his fianc&eacute;e came of age, and he soon took another concubine. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement and never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines.4) The following event  is not shown accurately in the movie.  Here is text from Book 8, Chapter 7 of Confessions.#29. I was saying these things and weeping in the most bitter contrition of my heart, when suddenly I heard the voice of a boy or a girl I know not which--coming from the neighboring house, chanting over and over again, &#34;Pick it up, read it; pick it up, read it.&#34; [&#34;tolle lege, tolle lege&#34;] Immediately I ceased weeping and began most earnestly to think whether it was usual for children in some kind of game to sing such a song, but I could not remember ever having heard the like. So, damming the torrent of my tears, I got to my feet, for I could not but think that this was a divine command to open the Bible and read the first passage I should light upon. For I had heard how Anthony, accidentally coming into church while the gospel was being read, received the admonition as if what was read had been addressed to him: &#34;Go and sell what you have and give it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.&#34; By such an oracle he was forthwith converted to thee.So I quickly returned to the bench where Alypius was sitting, for there I had put down the apostle's book when I had left there. I snatched it up, opened it, and in silence read the paragraph on which my eyes first fell: &#34;Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.&#34; I wanted to read no further, nor did I need to. For instantly, as the sentence ended, there was infused in my heart something like the light of full certainty and all the gloom of doubt vanished away.",5,"Entertaining, big budget production of the life of Augustine of Hippo based on his book Confessions",1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,4460,"['Purchased', 'April', '2014', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'story', 'entertaining', '8217', 'widescreen', 'color', 'excellent', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'English', 'optional', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'acting', 'many', 'different', 'filming', 'locations', 'professional', 'costumes', 'huge', 'number', 'extras.It', '8217', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'politics', 'public', 'speaking', 'philosophy', 'debating', 'pursuing', 'career', 'lawyer', 'solicitor', 'priest', 'politician.Augustine', 'Hippo', 'was', 'pagan', 'sinner', 'lived', 'life', 'debauchery', '8211', 'pride', 'self-admitted', 'slave', 'lust', 'most', 'interested', 'praise', 'recognition', 'other', 'people.There', 'also', 'included', '20', 'minute', 'long', '8220', 'Who', 'St.', 'Augustine', '8221', 'Fr', 'Benedict', 'Groeschel', 'very', 'informative', 'worth', 'watching', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'good', 'overview', 'will', 'actually', 'help', 'not', 'spoil', 'movie', 'watching.Some', 'screenplay', 'directorial', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'not', 'scene', '100', '%', 'factual', 'retelling', 'contents', 'book', 'written', 'Augustine', 'Hippo', 'entitled', 'Confessions.There', 'are', 'two', 'DVDs', 'second', 'extended', 'edition', 'movie', '8211', '3', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'first', 'DVD', '2', 'hour', 'movie', '5.1', 'audio.The', 'movie', 'starts', 'preparation', 'siege', 'city', 'Hippo', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'boring', 'parts', 'movie.I', 'could', 'not', 'fast', 'forward', 'reverse', 'extended', 'version', 'movie', 'prohibited', 'disc', 'Huh', 'could', 'CHAPTER', 'skip', 'ahead', 'behind.Want', 'know', 'more', '8211', 'research', 'read:1', 'Do', 'wikipedia', 'search', '8220', 'St', 'Augustine', '8221', 'will', 'find', 'info', 'various', 'sources', 'life', 'person', '8220', 'Confessions', '8221', 'more2', 'Confessions', '[', 'Library', 'Congress', 'Catalog', 'Card', 'Number', '55-5021', 'book', 'public', 'domain', ']', 'Also', 'found', 'Amazon.3', 'Amazon', '8211', 'Kindle', 'edition', '0.99', 'Complete', 'Works', 'Saint', 'Augustine', 'Confessions', 'Grace', 'Free', 'Will', 'City', 'God', 'Christian', 'Doctrine', 'Expositions', 'Book', 'Psalms', '50', 'Books', '8230', '4', 'Augustine', 'Hippo', 'Biography', 'Peter', 'Brown', 'History', 'Princeton', 'U', 'was', 'disappointed', 'certain', 'facts', 'were', 'not', 'accurately', 'portrayed.1', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'studied', 'much', 'conversion', 'took', 'years.2', 'Spoiler', 'concubine', 'shown', 'leaving', 'left', 'year', '385', 'was', 'be', 'engaged', 'rich', 'woman.3', 'had', 'wait', 'two', 'years', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'came', 'age', 'soon', 'took', 'concubine', 'Augustine', 'eventually', 'broke', 'off', 'engagement', 'never', 'renewed', 'relationship', 'concubines.4', 'following', 'event', 'not', 'shown', 'accurately', 'movie', 'Here', 'text', 'Book', '8', 'Chapter', '7', 'Confessions.', '29', 'was', 'saying', 'things', 'weeping', 'most', 'bitter', 'contrition', 'heart', 'when', 'suddenly', 'heard', 'voice', 'boy', 'girl', 'know', 'not', 'coming', 'neighboring', 'house', 'chanting', 'over', 'again', '34', 'Pick', 'up', 'read', 'pick', 'up', 'read', 'it.', '34', '[', '34', 'tolle', 'lege', 'tolle', 'lege', '34', ']', 'Immediately', 'ceased', 'weeping', 'began', 'most', 'earnestly', 'think', 'was', 'usual', 'children', 'kind', 'game', 'sing', 'song', 'could', 'not', 'remember', 'ever', 'having', 'heard', 'like', 'So', 'damming', 'torrent', 'tears', 'got', 'feet', 'could', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'divine', 'command', 'open', 'Bible', 'read', 'first', 'passage', 'should', 'light', 'upon', 'had', 'heard', 'how', 'Anthony', 'accidentally', 'coming', 'church', 'gospel', 'was', 'being', 'read', 'received', 'admonition', 'what', 'was', 'read', 'had', 'been', 'addressed', '34', 'Go', 'sell', 'what', 'have', 'give', 'poor', 'shall', 'have', 'treasure', 'heaven', 'come', 'follow', 'me.', '34', 'oracle', 'was', 'forthwith', 'converted', 'thee.So', 'quickly', 'returned', 'bench', 'where', 'Alypius', 'was', 'sitting', 'had', 'put', 'down', 'apostle', 'book', 'when', 'had', 'left', 'there', 'snatched', 'up', 'opened', 'silence', 'read', 'paragraph', 'eyes', 'first', 'fell', '34', 'Not', 'rioting', 'drunkenness', 'not', 'chambering', 'wantonness', 'not', 'strife', 'envying', 'put', 'Lord', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'make', 'provision', 'flesh', 'fulfill', 'lusts', 'thereof.', '34', 'wanted', 'read', 'further', 'did', 'need', 'instantly', 'sentence', 'ended', 'was', 'infused', 'heart', 'something', 'light', 'full', 'certainty', 'gloom', 'doubt', 'vanished', 'away']",Restless Heart: The Confessions of Augustine

Some of us lucky ones have had the pleasure of owning a copy from the time of the screening. However I had to wait. And the wait was well worth it. This is a wonderful epic from veteran Canadian director, Christian Duguay, who has given us films likeJoan of ArcandPius XII: Under the Roman Sky. I would like to divide this review into several parts so as to facilitate any prospective customers as to what to expect.1.The Discs : There are 2 discs.The first disc is the theatrical release which is 133 minutes long. This is the same film that was shown throughout the many theaters in North America. The contents of this disc are, the film itself, Scene selections, a 27 minute documentary on St. Augustine by Fr. Benedict Groeschel, a theatrical trailer. This disc has both English and Spanish subtitles.The Second disc: this is the extended version  which is 203 minutes long. Features include scene selections and theatrical trailer. There are NO subtitles on this disc.On both discs, the movies are in English.2. As with most Ignatius Press DVDs, there is a  full 24 page booklet on the Saint by Fr. David Meconi S.J. Professor of Patristic Theology, St. Louis University. The contents of this booklet are as follows:a) About the film.b) St. Augustine's intellectual Odysseyc) Major works and contributionsd) Discussion Questionse) Learn More (indicates more material to be used to learn about the Saint)f) Scene SelectionsWith that out of the way, the movie is a very compelling retelling on the life of St. Augustine from his very birth to his episcopacy in Hippo. It is full of drama, wit, tears (particularly those of his mother Saint Monica),heartbreak (with regard to his concubine, Khalida) and  cunning. The young Augustine is a man, as pictured and from his  `Confessions' driven by ambition to gain the world: to be renowned, feared, to have status and power; to enjoy all the pleasures of the flesh, and finally being a slave to sin and the devil. The actor does a fantastic job of portraying Augustine as arrogant, narcissistic and proud, who would not even sway to the constant appeals of his loving mother(also beautifully, nay,magnificently acted out by a superlative actress!). Event after event, all of his own volition, would lead him away from her, but in this mother we see a true woman of faith (and of tough stuff!) who would not let go and would storm both heaven (and Augustine!) until she gains for him the grace of Baptism. Another important figure in this film is the character of St. Ambrose, whose character makes an indelible mark on the film and historically in the life of St. Augustine.One can also see again the clash between the government (pictured by the Roman Dowager Empress) and the ecclesiastical authorities (St. Ambrose). Events that would be pivotal in the conversion of St. Augustine and that would cause him to renounce his position as the Court Orator.From there we are taken to Hippo, from whence our film begins, with the city being besieged by the Vandals and the Bishop Augustine futilely seeking a middle ground to prevent bloodshed. Unafraid in all circumstances, purely motivated by the love of God, this film demonstrates to every person that even if we were the greatest sinner, there is always hope when we repent and trust in the mercies of God. This film borrows heavily from the Confessions of St. Augustine.As mentioned, the main characters of this film are wonderfully acted out.One can really relate to this film, for in the person of the young Augustine, we can see the faces of many of our youth who make ambition foremost in their lives, and who seek the world to the detriment and loss of their souls. Also the clash between the civil and religious authorities is still on going. Therefore the life of St. Augustine is as relevant today as it was 1500 years ago. Mothers, who have difficult relations with their children can gain much comfort and inspiration from this story, particularly in the person of St.Monica.The extended version has a few added scenes than the theatrical version and personally, I liked it better. However it takes nothing  away from the theatrical version. It has a better flow, with an extended storyline(which includes a love interest that some will not particularly care for) and with the addition of a couple of extra characters. If one has time to spare then one should see the extended version. Taking into consideration its length, I would suggest breaking the film into 2 or 3 parts, lest the viewer gets tired. The most important thing is to learn the message this film has to convey and to digest it, rather than just watching a movie!Please be forewarned. This film does have scenes of sensuality. Therefore parents, kindly take note.This is a great film resounding with hope for everyone. Definitely a must see.If you wish a more factual, documentary style account of St. Augustine's life thenSaint Augustine: A Voice for All Generations, hosted by Mike Aquilina, is the one to watch.",5,"Restless on earth, now aflame and resting in the Lord!",1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,5100,"['many', 'screenings', 'North', 'America', 'much', 'anticipated', 'movie', 'finally', 'own',

Eventually he sees the err of his ways, and rises to become one of the greatest defenders of the Church.  His mother Monica's life is also very inspirational, as she loves her son and her husband despite their failures, and gives us all a fine example of patience and trust in the Divine Assistance.

1678462,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B00GHU35HM,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[3, 4]","The &#34;Confessions&#34; of St. Augustine of Hippo, beloved by Catholics and Protestants alike, is probably the most well-read Christian autobiography of all time. Augustine, whose 76 years (AD 354-430) saw the final decline of the Roman Empire, went from a hedonistic youth (where he made a brilliant public speaking career and drifted through several eccentric philosophies of life) to become one of the greatest Christian thinkers of all time. He even fathered a child out of wedlock with one of several women he seduced, praying to God for &#34;chastity and continence -- but not yet.&#34; His father was a pagan, but his Christian mother St. Monica and St. Ambrose the bishop of Milan made fruitless efforts to convert him to Christianity.At age 32, Augustine finally picked up the Bible and read a passage (Rom 14:13-14) from St. Paul's letter to the Romans that exhorted readers to &#34;put on Christ&#34; rather than drunkenness, leading him to confront the unhappiness that had resulted from his life choices. He quickly obtained baptism from St. Ambrose, rising to become a priest and later bishop in Hippo, where he died in AD 430 as the Vandal barbarians besieged his city's gates. The Roman Empire fell shortly afterwards.Recognized by Roman Catholicism as a bishop and doctor of the Church, St. Augustine is one of the most influential writers from the first 500 years of Christianity, with his &#34;City of God&#34; defending Christianity's influence on the Roman Empire and his brutally honest &#34;Confessions&#34; describing how God fulfilled his deepest desires after years of restlessly searching for fulfillment. When I read the &#34;Confessions&#34; in college, I was blown away by its heartfelt narrative and deeply theological passages, but I never thought it would be visualized in a movie. This production proves me wrong.The film &#34;Restless Heart&#34; is directed by French Canadian director Christian Duguay (&#34;Joan of Arc,&#34; 1999) and originated as an Italian TV miniseries. This Ignatius Press two-disc DVD set includes one disc with a feature-length cut released in U.S. churches and the original three-hour cut on a second disc. The first disc with the theatrical cut is vastly superior, featuring enhanced picture and sound in addition to special features that include a little EWTN television documentary on Augustine hosted by Franciscan friar Andrew Apostoli CFR. The second disc features just the original film cut in washed-out colors, appearing untouched from its television premiere. Having seen both versions, I believe you get the gist of the story on Disc 1, while the three-hour cut from Disc 2 mostly includes fictionalized elements that add nothing to the story.The story is told in flashback by an elderly Augustine awaiting the barbarian attack on Hippo in AD 430, building to a moving climax. Flawlessly dubbed, it looks like it was originally filmed in English, and I still can't believe how well the voice work matches up with the actors. Believe me: I utterly DESPISE dubbing on foreign films, particularly as found in most of the Italian RAI-TV productions released on DVD by Ignatius Press in the United States. But this film is actually awesome in English, defying conventional wisdom about dubbing.I showed &#34;Restless Heart&#34; (theatrical cut) to 16-year old students in a scripture class and they were astounded at the high quality of the film, very different from many other titles in the Ignatius Press catalogue. Many of the scenes, particularly the conversion sequence of Augustine and final scene with his mother, follow the &#34;Confessions&#34; so well that they will move you to tears. Other more historical sequences, including the final assault on Hippo in Augustine's last hours, are brilliant in evoking Christianity's final triumph over the Roman Empire and role in preserving the best of its heritage throughout the coming dark ages. The production values and special effects are extremely good here. If you love St. Augustine, you'll love this movie. Also, if you enjoyed the &#34;Saint Barbara&#34; DVD from Ignatius Press, you'll also love this film since its visual style and music (same composer, Andrea Guerra) is the same. I highly recommend it.",5,"Amazing visualization of Augustine's ""Confessions""",1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,4238,"['34', 'Confessions', '34', 'St.', 'Augustine', 'Hippo', 'beloved', 'Catholics', 'Protestants', 'alike', 'probably', 'most', 'well-read', 'Christian', 'autobiography', 'time', 'Augustine', '76', 'years', 'AD', '354-430', 'saw', 'final', 'decline', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'went', 'hedonistic', 'youth', 'where', 'made', 'brilliant', 'public', 'speaking', 'career', 'drifted', 'several', 'eccentric', 'philosophies', 'life', 'become', 'one', 'greatest', 'Christian', 'thinkers', 'time', 'even', 'fathered', 'child', 'wedlock', 'one', 'several', 'women', 'seduced', 'praying', 'God', '34', 'chastity', 'continence', 'not', 'yet.', '34', 'father', 'was', 'pagan', 'Christian', 'mother', 'St.', 'Monica', 'St.', 'Ambrose', 'bishop', 'Milan', 'made', 'fruitless', 'efforts', 'convert', 'Christianity.At', 'age', '32', 'Augustine', 'finally', 'picked', 'up', 'Bible', 'read', 'passage', 'Rom', '14:13-14', 'St.', 'Paul', 'letter', 'Romans', 'exhorted', 'readers', '34', 'put', 'Christ', '34', 'rather', 'drunkenness', 'leading', 'confront', 'unhappiness', 'had', 'resulted', 'life', 'choices', 'quickly', 'obtained', 'baptism', 'St.', 'Ambrose', 'rising', 'become', 'priest', 'later', 'bishop', 'Hippo', 'where', 'died', 'AD', '430', 'Vandal', 'barbarians', 'besieged', 'city', 'gates', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'fell', 'shortly', 'afterwards.Recognized', 'Roman', 'Catholicism', 'bishop', 'doctor', 'Church', 'St.', 'Augustine', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'writers', 'first', '500', 'years', 'Christianity', '34', 'City', 'God', '34', 'defending', 'Christianity', 'influence', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'brutally', 'honest', '34', 'Confessions', '34', 'describing', 'how', 'God', 'fulfilled', 'deepest', 'desires', 'years', 'restlessly', 'searching', 'fulfillment', 'When', 'read', '34', 'Confessions', '34', 'college', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'heartfelt', 'narrative', 'deeply', 'theological', 'passages', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'visualized', 'movie', 'production', 'film', '34', 'Restless', 'Heart', '34', 'directed', 'French', 'Canadian', 'director', 'Christian', 'Duguay', '34', 'Joan', 'Arc', '34', '1999', 'originated', 'Italian', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'disc', 'feature-length', 'cut', 'released', 'U.S.', 'churches', 'original', 'three-hour', 'cut', 'second', 'disc', 'first', 'disc', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'vastly', 'superior', 'featuring', 'enhanced', 'picture', 'sound', 'addition', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'little', 'EWTN', 'television', 'documentary', 'Augustine', 'hosted', 'Franciscan', 'friar', 'Andrew', 'Apostoli', 'CFR', 'second', 'disc', 'features', 'just', 'original', 'film', 'cut', 'washed-out', 'colors', 'appearing', 'untouched', 'television', 'premiere', 'Having', 'seen', 'versions', 'believe', 'get', 'gist', 'story', 'Disc', '1', 'three-hour', 'cut', 'Disc', '2', 'mostly', 'fictionalized', 'elements', 'add', 'nothing', 'story.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'elderly', 'Augustine', 'awaiting', 'barbarian', 'attack', 'Hippo', 'AD', '430', 'building', 'moving', 'climax', 'Flawlessly', 'dubbed', 'was', 'originally', 'filmed', 'English', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'well', 'voice', 'work', 'up', 'actors', 'Believe', 'utterly', 'DESPISE', 'dubbing', 'foreign', 'films', 'particularly', 'found', 'most', 'Italian', 'RAI-TV', 'productions', 'released', 'DVD', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'actually', 'awesome', 'English', 'defying', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'dubbing.I', 'showed', '34', 'Restless', 'Heart', '34', 'theatrical', 'cut', '16-year', 'old', 'students', 'scripture', 'class', 'were', 'astounded', 'high', 'quality', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'many', 'other', 'titles', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'catalogue', 'Many', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'conversion', 'sequence', 'Augustine', 'final', 'scene', 'mother', 'follow', '34', 'Confessions', '34', 'so', 'well', 'will', 'move', 'tears', 'Other', 'more', 'historical', 'sequences', 'including', 'final', 'assault', 'Hippo', 'Augustine', 'last', 'hours', 'are', 'brilliant', 'evoking', 'Christianity', 'final', 'triumph', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'role', 'preserving', 'best', 'heritage', 'coming', 'dark', 'ages', 'production', 'values', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'here', 'love', 'St.', 'Augustine', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'Also', 'enjoyed', '34', 'Saint', 'Barbara', '34', 'DVD', 'Ignatius', 'Press', ""'ll"", 'also', 'love', 'film', 'visual', 'style', 'music', 'same', 'composer', 'Andrea', 'Guerra', 'same', 'highly', 'recommend']",Restless Heart: The Confessions of Augustine
