Jenkins,"[1, 1]","Add this to your cart RIGHT NOW.A genuinely superb piece of work, and for any fan of the British Invasion a warm, insightful and joyous experience to watch. And God, the music...Three things separate this documentary from the many other films you've seen on the Brit bands... First, the respect paid to the performance clips, all but one of which I'd never seen (and I collect this stuff pretty seriously.) Most of the clips are not lip synched and in these the band really shines. The clips within the film itself are presented in their entirety with no intrusion of bothersome narration... and each is self-standing in the bonus section.Second, the band members speak at great length and considerable intelligence about the inner workings and business of the band... a noticeable step up from most of these films.Third... I won't say the film reminds one of how great the Hollie's music was, because I'd guess anyone purchasing the DVD hasn't forgotten. What it does bring home is what a great instrumental band they were, above and beyond the vocals and harmonies.All in all a tremendous pleasure to watch... and now I'm off to order the other DVDs in the series... based on this one's overall excellence.",5,Superb!,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,1208,"['Add', 'cart', 'RIGHT', 'NOW.A', 'genuinely', 'superb', 'piece', 'work', 'fan', 'British', 'Invasion', 'warm', 'insightful', 'joyous', 'experience', 'watch', 'God', 'music', 'Three', 'things', 'separate', 'documentary', 'many', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Brit', 'bands', 'First', 'respect', 'paid', 'performance', 'clips', 'one', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'collect', 'stuff', 'pretty', 'seriously', 'Most', 'clips', 'are', 'not', 'lip', 'synched', 'band', 'really', 'shines', 'clips', 'film', 'are', 'presented', 'entirety', 'intrusion', 'bothersome', 'narration', 'self-standing', 'bonus', 'section.Second', 'band', 'members', 'speak', 'great', 'length', 'considerable', 'intelligence', 'inner', 'workings', 'business', 'band', 'noticeable', 'step', 'up', 'most', 'films.Third', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'one', 'how', 'great', 'Hollie', 'music', 'was', ""'d"", 'guess', 'anyone', 'purchasing', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'What', 'bring', 'home', 'what', 'great', 'instrumental', 'band', 'were', 'vocals', 'harmonies.All', 'tremendous', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'now', ""'m"", 'off', 'order', 'other', 'DVDs', 'series', 'based', 'one', 'overall', 'excellence']",The Hollies: Look Through Any Window 1963-1975

1461195,A12ATI6CWD0KI0,B005HS00U0,Imperative,"[13, 16]","Look Through Any Window 1963-1975 is a fascinating look at The Hollies, let down only by its imbalance. While the Hollies Nash period('63-'68) is covered with great love and obvious care, the 1969-75 years are given very hasty treatment, leaving this history somewhat lopsided. Case in point: 1968, hardly a banner year for the group, is given 4 songs, equal to the number selected from  the entire '69-'75 period.There are some wonderful interviews here with Hollies Nash, Clarke, Hicks and Elliott but one wonders why Sylvester and Calvert were so obviously excluded. The early years are covered thoroughly and beautifully in both song, film and interview up to the point of Graham's exit from the group, but then begins an unseemly rush through the Nash-less period. One can't help but draw the conclusion that the Hollies sans-Nash, are considered of little account.If you consider, as some Hollies fans do, the Nash years to be the quality  Hollies years, and the Hollies without Graham to be just another pedestrian pop group, then this release will be everything you've ever wished for. However, fans of the Clarke-led era will be in for a letdown, to say the least. It's a shame this production wasn't a little more inclusive of the early '70's group, since the earlier period is very well done indeed.

Nice that the performances here of the group whether done live or lip-synced on some t.v. shows were kept in tact not chopped up as has been done on some other documentaries pertaining to other groups. Also very well done interviews with the band members as they remembered their time in the group and series of events that occurred from inception to the end of the band.

There are 22 complete performance, most of them live, most in color, even from the early days.  In between, Graham Nash, Alan Clarke, Tony Hicks and Bobby Elliot, talk about the production of the songs, how they were written and the inspiration behind them.  There is footage from Abby Road studios showing them in session recording.  Tony Hicks, the lead guitarist, demonstrates the lead guitar parts for several iconic songs, ""I'm Alive"", ""Bus Stop"", ""Look Through any Window"" and the banjo he played on ""Stop Stop Stop.""As a fan, I've been waiting for years for a concert DVD of the Hollies.

1461205,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B005HS00U0,Peter Baklava,"[0, 0]","Lillian Roxon, in her ""Rock Encyclopedia"" of 1969, called the Hollies ""the group's group"".  This video history bears that out.  The Hollies simply produced some of the most infectious and upbeat music created during the ""Beat Era"" ( I think the group also authored a book called ""How to Run a Beat Group""...seriously.)The Hollies' early hits were all beautifully-crafted three minute rushes of harmony and optimism, delivered in a breathless, brimming with energy style... more effervescent than the Beatles.The gratifying thing that comes through in this package, with running commentary by four integral members of the band, is that they were all very intelligent people.  They succeeded for a reason.  The video performances also give a keen insight as to why the group hit an impasse in 1968, and why Graham Nash left the band.  As I remember the days when I was glued to the radio, listening to those hits, I thought the Hollies peaked with ""On A Carousel"" in 1967.  It was their most daring arrangement, with Tony Hicks contributing a guitar lick that verged on real ""heaviness"".  With Cream and Hendrix on the radio, and The Band and the Byrds ready to steer away from psychedelia, Rock was growing up quickly.And the Hollies couldn't quite make it out of adolescence.  ""We were going nowhere"", Allan Clarke says in the film. ""We knew we couldn't be the Beatles.""  What the videos show is that in 1968, the group was adding a bit of self-conscious schtick to its performances.  During ""Carrie-Anne"" they mugged when Tony Hicks did his solo vocal, and when the taped steel drums came in, they mimed as if the effect had dropped out of their trousers like a rubber ball.  It was clever, but also a sad indication of the group's capitulation to lounge-style entertainment.  Soon, they would release the bizarre ""Words and Music by Bob Dylan"" album.Make no mistake, they were still a good band.  Any band with a nucleus of Clarke (great lead singer), Hicks (good to great guitarist), and Elliott (great drummer) was always worth listening to.  And they stayed good (and even released a terrific album, ""Romany"", something that previously had eluded them), when Clarke left the band and was replaced by Mikael Rickfors.  But that is beyond the scope of this film.In this video, you get to see the contributions of each key member to the Hollies' early sound.  You see the mechanics behind Elliott's exceptional drumming, and the inventiveness of the stellar accompaniments of Tony Hicks on guitar, twelve-string guitar, and banjo... and you see how they put together those seamless harmonies.Any Hollies fan also knows that the band produced a lot of treasurable B-sides and album tracks, things like ""(I Get)So Lonely"", ""Don't Run and Hide"", ""Tell Me To My Face"", ""Rain on the Window"", ""Schoolgirl"", ""Man With No Expression"", and on and on... only ""Wings"" is featured as part of this film.  And other significant hits like ""Yes I Will"", and ""Pay You Back With Interest""  could easily have been included, but were bypassed.Still, this video is a wonderful affirmation of the talents of this beat group 'par excellence'... a group I still listen to, long after I gave up on Crosby, Stills and Nash.P.S.  I agree with what Nash said in this documentary, that the Hollies were a conscientiously good live band (although they could be a little sloppy.)  So, where are the BBC sessions?  Given that the Hollies were nearly as popular as the Beatles in Britain, the BBC must have recorded them quite a lot.

The interviews are awesome and I would have to say this is one of the best DVDs I have in my collection and will watch over and over again.  The sad part is the lack of interviews with Mike Rikfors or Terry Sylvester!  Its criminal that Terry is not here on this DVD to share his knowledge and participation in this group.  When Graham Nash left Terry continued and did a darn good job of filling in for Mr Nash.  I guess after what went on at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame there may be some bad blood I dont know.  If you are not a Hollies fan scoop this up and listen to the brilliant harmonies and how all of these songs became timeless.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[34, 36]","Every one (yes, EVERY one) of the 36+ DVDs I've seen (and reviewed) from Reelin' in the Years productions (including four Jazz Icons sets, a few American Folk Blues Festival volumes, the Motown Greats, Stax Story and the sole Folk Icons DVD of Pete Seeger) have been superb! Last year Producers David Peck, Phil Galloway, `Tom Gulotta and Rob Bowman produced a four volume set called The British Invasion. Another gem (see my review on Amazon)! Now they have added to the BI series with this DVD on the career of The Hollies (known to younger fans as a seminal 1960s pop group, and to younger fans as the group that started Graham Nash's career).As with the other volumes in the BI series, Peck and his cohorts set out to find and license the best quality prints of performances by the band, and then sent Bowman out to do contemporary interviews with the band members, which form the fabric of the documentary, by weaving the interviews (all done in 2010) with the 22 COMPLETE performances. The interviews were done with Nash, lead vocalist Allan Clarke (who was Nash's best friend from the age of six!), guitarist Tony Hicks and drummer Bobby Elliott. (Though the band consisted of five members, the bassist changed a few times and none of those musicians were interviewed.).The interviews are insightful and honest and you'll learn a lot from them (along with some additional facts in Ben Fong-Torres' essay in the 12-page booklet inserted in the package. (Another standard for RITY releases.)Many of the performances are probably being seen by fans for the first time. While a couple are from Brit and US TV (""This Is Tom Jones"", ""The New Music Express Winners Concert"") the majority are from oddball places like The Split Festival (in Croatia!) and shows titled ""Rooster"" and ""supersonic"". A few are in Black and white but MOST are in glorious color - with not a speck of dust or scratch to be seen.The dates in the title might be a bit misleading as the performances are generally from the year that the songs were hits. However the last Hollies hit was in 1974 with ""The Air That I Breathe"" (Nash was gone by then) and yet it is preceded here by a 1975 performance (from the British TV show ""Supersonic"") of ""Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress"" which was released in 1972.The ""feature film"" runs just over two hours and 53 minutes of that is due to the complete performances. But there is a ""Bonus Feature"" option that lets you play just the performances - either individually or as ""play all"". These guys thought of everyone when they put this package together.The Reelin' in the Years productions have been released by various video companies over the years. This volume comes from Eagle Rock Entertainment, which - I'm told - will be releasing the FIFTH set of Jazz Icons DVDs this fall. Obviously, I'm one fan of RITY that's anxious to see that.With a very reasonable list price of $14.98 this Hollies DVD is a MUST HAVE for Hollies fans.
