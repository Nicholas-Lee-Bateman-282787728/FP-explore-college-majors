759597,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00009Y3N1,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","John Sayles has had a remarkable career. After writing the ""Piranha"" script for Roger Corman, he turned right around and both wrote and directed ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven."" This must have impressed a lot of people, as Hollywood remade it as ""The Big Chill"" which had a bigger budget, higher priced cast and a much larger return at the box office. Anyway....""Lianna"" was his second effort and it's difficult to imagine a better film being made on the paltry $300,000.00 supporting it.Here's the scoop. Lianna has married one of her college profs. Now, some years and two children later, things aren't going all that well. Hubby is still in the habit of boinking students and she's ticked. The emotional turmoil is also resurrecting feelings she's had since a young girl for her attraction to other women. This is exacerbated by the fact she's feeling attracted to a teacher she has in a class she's taking. The feeling becomes mutual and the ensuing relationship opens up a can of worms on many fronts.As in any good/great indy film, this starts with the script. Sayles really seems to get what this is all about. A woman approaching middle age realizes she's lesbian and doesn't know how to handle it. Friends see her differently and she's not certain how open she can be about it due to its social stigma. Her husband's a jerk and will use it as leverage against her with their kids. What will happen to her relationship with her kids? The daughter is confused and the son is quite glib and might be becoming more like his dad. Then there's the feelings of love she has for her new girlfriend but that's upset by her wanting to explore her new found sexuality. Many things come into play and the script handles them very well.The budget allowed for only the most basic of approaches to getting this puppy in the can but it all still works just fine. The sets, wardrobe, sound and other production values are all good enough to further the plot. The principal actors all do a decent job and all went on to have decent, if not very good, careers. I originally saw this on VHS on a CRT and it was pretty rough. This new version is remastered and, seeing it on an HD set, has given it a really great look. There are minor quibbles one might have about this, that or the other thing, but they are small distractions to a truly outstanding film.",4,Remarkable Sophomore Effort,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,2348,"['John', 'Sayles', 'had', 'remarkable', 'career', 'writing', 'Piranha', 'script', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'turned', 'right', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Return', 'Secaucus', 'Seven', 'must', 'have', 'impressed', 'lot', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'remade', 'Big', 'Chill', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', 'higher', 'priced', 'cast', 'much', 'larger', 'return', 'box', 'office', 'Anyway', 'Lianna', 'was', 'second', 'effort', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'better', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'paltry', '300,000.00', 'supporting', 'it.Here', 'scoop', 'Lianna', 'married', 'one', 'college', 'profs', 'Now', 'years', 'two', 'children', 'later', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'well', 'Hubby', 'still', 'habit', 'boinking', 'students', 'ticked', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'also', 'resurrecting', 'feelings', 'had', 'young', 'girl', 'attraction', 'other', 'women', 'exacerbated', 'fact', 'feeling', 'attracted', 'teacher', 'class', 'taking', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'ensuing', 'relationship', 'up', 'can', 'worms', 'many', 'fronts.As', 'good/great', 'indy', 'film', 'script', 'Sayles', 'really', 'get', 'what', 'about', 'woman', 'approaching', 'middle', 'age', 'lesbian', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'Friends', 'see', 'differently', 'not', 'certain', 'how', 'open', 'can', 'be', 'due', 'social', 'stigma', 'husband', 'jerk', 'will', 'use', 'leverage', 'kids', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'relationship', 'kids', 'daughter', 'confused', 'son', 'quite', 'glib', 'might', 'be', 'becoming', 'more', 'dad', 'Then', 'feelings', 'love', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'upset', 'wanting', 'explore', 'new', 'found', 'sexuality', 'Many', 'things', 'come', 'play', 'script', 'very', 'well.The', 'budget', 'allowed', 'only', 'most', 'basic', 'approaches', 'getting', 'puppy', 'can', 'still', 'just', 'fine', 'sets', 'wardrobe', 'sound', 'other', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'further', 'plot', 'principal', 'actors', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'went', 'have', 'decent', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'careers', 'originally', 'saw', 'VHS', 'CRT', 'was', 'pretty', 'rough', 'new', 'version', 'remastered', 'seeing', 'HD', 'set', 'given', 'really', 'great', 'look', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'other', 'thing', 'are', 'small', 'distractions', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'film']",Lianna

759600,A27L60JENYODDV,B00009Y3N1,Harvey Woodmeadow,"[1, 1]","Others have noted that in many ways, this film isn't about lesbianism. And yet...In many ways, it really is. I was still in high school when this film came out and frankly, as a naive teen I really didn't know much about sexual relationships at all, never mind those outside the mainstream. So I can't really say for sure that this movie captures the reality of the day.But I suspect it does. The movie rings true in its consistent presentation of the issues surrounding a housewife discovering that not only does she not love her husband, but that she loves women. We have a long way to go before society is completely non-judgmental about any number of personal lifestyle choices that harm no one, including sexual orientation. But it's reassuring to see just how different times were thirty years ago from today, as it shows things can and do change given enough time.Sadly, some of what makes this story work (i.e. all the things unrelated to lesbianism) probably still happen all too often today. A philandering spouse, small-town politics and gossip, and of course the difficulty of explaining to one's children why and how their parents could split up and yet still love them every bit as much as they used to.But at the very least, it's safe to say that if such a scandal occurred today, the fact that the couple was lesbian would have much less impact, and in fact in most communities would be a complete non-issue (at least at that level...of course, there will always be individuals with certain views, but as community standards change, those individuals tend to keep their views more to themselves).This movie does address and present in detail a number of issues related to the lesbian affair, many of which seem very unfair by todays standards but I'm guessing at the time most people would have much less sympathy for the wife in the story. Even as sympathetically as the movie presents her.So, while the movie apparently got good reviews even back in 1983, today it's still just as watchable and yet provides more layers of interest, due to the ability to view the story in hindsight.

This, of course, means something has to be &quot;wrong&quot; with the wife. At the same time, he didn't want her problem to be too impairing.

759604,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00009Y3N1,Linda Linguvic,"[45, 47]","This little-known 1983 film must have been shocking in its time.  It's about a young mother in an unhappy marriage to a college professor.  She begins an affair but the twist of this story is that the affair is with a female teacher.  She then has to cope with a broken marriage, the angst of her two children, and a whole new world of the lesbian subculture.  Add to this the fact that the older woman is not as anxious to commit to the relationship.  She doesn't want to be exposed as it would hurt her career and she also has a long-standing relationship with a woman in another state.  The young woman now finds that life is just as difficult for her as it was when she was married to her uncaring spouse.  There's high drama here, but it never turns maudlin.Linda Griffiths is the young woman and she's great in the role of a woman who is suddenly cast into a lifestyle that is totally new to her.  Jane Hallaren is the older teacher in an excellent performance.  She, too, comes across as a troubled human being.  There are some very tender scenes between the two of them and they are touching and authentic.  I was moved by their dilemma and by their performances.My highest accolades, however, go to John Sayles who wrote and directed it.  He even cast himself in a small role.  There's an extra feature on the DVD which features him discussing this film which is a perfect complement to the film itself.  Through the years, he has proven his talent for bringing out the many complex layers in seemingly simple situations.  He certainly did a great job with Lianna.  It's a really fine film.

But, then, you would be missing the real point of the movie, which is a tale of spiritual (not sexual) repression, and how if you do take a chance and pursue the path you believe you should be on, it can backfire. It's also provides some glimmer of hope when it comes to picking up the pieces ones choices, however well intentioned, change life in unintended ways.This is an early John Sayles work (he even has a role in the movie), so it's interesting to observe his earlier writing and directing styles. It's also surprising to see that he still uses the main elements of those styles in his storytelling up to this day - and very successfully.I personally found the characters to be believable, and while the acting was not Oscar material, it got the story across. The scope of the story is relatively narrow compared to Sayles' later work, likeLone StarorSunshine State. Considerably so, in fact, but the dialog and pacing are pure John Sayles.The story itself is one to which I can relate - not within the context of sexual orientation choices, but feeling constrained or diminished by the status quo, seizing what looks like a viable opportunity, only to discover that the manner in which it was seized was more impulsive than rational, and the consequences were not pleasant. I am sure many of us have gone through similar cycles, and the glimmer of hope Lianna saw at the very end when she started pulling things together is a message in itself. So, for me personally, this movie was both entertaining and one that touched a few nerves. Viewed in that context, you may find it to be enjoyable and possibly inspiring.

MGM and IFC Films have just released three of his earliest to DVD for the first time, &quot;RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN&quot; (Sayles maiden directorial effort), &quot;THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET&quot; and this wonderful film, &quot;LIANNA&quot;. The story of an unhappily married young woman named Lianna (beautifully played by Linda Griffiths)who discovers after eight years of marriage that she is a lesbian. She falls in love with an older woman, a night school teacher, and this leads to a seperation from her doofus of a husband and her two children. Lianna's oddyssey of self-discovery is endlessly fascinating and compelling. This film is a wonderful, witty, and warm human drama! For those of you tired of empty headed Hollywood blockbusters big on CGI effects, explosions, car chases, and cardboard characters, check out this film and some of Mr. Sayles other works. You will not be disappointed. His films are wonderful slices of life populated by believable characters. He is a true artist.The picture and sound on the new DVD is quite good (the film having been recently restored). The disc features an insightful feature length audio commentary by John Sayles and a 9 minute featurette with on screen inverviews with Sayles and longtime partner producer Maggie Renzi. The trailer for Sayles latest film, &quot;CASA DE LOS BABYS&quot; is also included.Highly recommended! -George Bauch",5,Another Great Slice Of Life From John Sayles!,1063929600,"09 19, 2003",2003,1526,"['quot', 'Acclaimed', 'writer/director', 'quot', 'John', 'Sayles', 'been', 'making', 'best', 'films', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'MGM', 'IFC', 'Films', 'have', 'just', 'released', 'three', 'earliest', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'quot', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'SECAUCUS', 'SEVEN', 'quot', 'Sayles', 'maiden', 'directorial', 'effort', 'quot', 'THE', 'BROTHER', 'FROM', 'ANOTHER', 'PLANET', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'film', 'quot', 'LIANNA', 'quot', 'story', 'unhappily', 'married', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Lianna', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Linda', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'eight', 'years', 'marriage', 'lesbian', 'love', 'older', 'woman', 'night', 'school', 'teacher', 'seperation', 'doofus', 'husband', 'two', 'children', 'Lianna', 'oddyssey', 'self-discovery', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'compelling', 'film', 'wonderful', 'witty', 'warm', 'human', 'drama', 'tired', 'empty', 'headed', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'big', 'CGI', 'effects', 'explosions', 'car', 'chases', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Sayles', 'other', 'works', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'films', 'are', 'wonderful', 'slices', 'life', 'populated', 'believable', 'characters', 'true', 'artist.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'new', 'DVD', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'having', 'been', 'recently', 'restored', 'disc', 'insightful', 'feature', 'length', 'audio', 'commentary', 'John', 'Sayles', '9', 'minute', 'featurette', 'screen', 'inverviews', 'Sayles', 'longtime', 'partner', 'producer', 'Maggie', 'Renzi', 'trailer', 'Sayles', 'latest', 'film', 'quot', 'CASA', 'DE', 'LOS', 'BABYS', 'quot', 'also', 'included.Highly', 'recommended', '-George', 'Bauch']",Lianna
