Its Indiana Jones, James Bond and Mr. Wizard all rolled into one.Season four, like the other three season on DVD, are filled with friends from previous seasons... Penny Parker (Teri Hatcher), Jack Dalton (Bruce McGill) and Mac's sidekick/boss Peter Thorton (The late Dana Eclar) and his arch villian Murdoc (played to the hilt by Micheal Des Barres).The best episodes of this season are:Cleo Rocks-which shows why Teri Hatcher is the star she is today, as she tried to mount a musical with a killer (ala the Phanton of the Opera) lurkingOn a Wing and A Prayer-reminds this critic of Flight of The Phoenix as Mac, Jack and Pete try to raise a bullet ridden sea planeDeadly Dreams-Which is a TV spin on Silence of the Lamb-where Mac works with a criminal mastermind similar to Hannibel Lechter to find an escape killerIt is great TV at its best....However Dana Eclar passed this year-it would have been nice to have a tribute to him on the DVD. And One can wish Richard Dean Anderson one day does an audio commentary on a MacGyver box setThese 19 episodes are well worth your money and your time. So Paramount- so when is the rest coming?
