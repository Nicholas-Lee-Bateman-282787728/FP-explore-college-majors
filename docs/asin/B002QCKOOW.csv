Durham Cathedral almost eclipses the music and the man himself. The venue adds an intangible quality to the performance that would be lost at any other location. The musicians are extraordinary and Sting's voice is in top shape. The lighting is impeccable. I had my doubts about this DVD, but the stunning quality won me over. I much prefer El Stingo when he dons his rock hat, but Sting has always had the ability to defy conventional limitations in regards to what a ""rock musician"" is capable of accomplishing. The songs are a mixture of English folk songs, lullabys and a few of Sting's compositions. The documentary DVD was an even bigger bonus. The film takes us through the gathering of the musicians to record the album, rehearsals for the concert, and a delightful tour of Newcastle and visits with old friends. The documentary did an excellent of job of showing Sting as a man, not an international rock star. As he says in the film, ""I have no mystery here. There's no myth.""

1283764,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B002QCKOOW,I. Giles,"[2, 2]","This pair of discs has proved to be far more successful than I had dared to hope. The concert disc provides an absorbing selection of Christmas / Winter inspired songs largely taken from much earlier generations starting with the medieval period and onwards to more modern times but not in chronological order.The arrangements are tastefully done with a modern slant and the short introductions supplied by Sting are completely interesting, being neither too long or too short. The delivery emphasises the relaxed atmosphere and this is a contributing factor to the success of the occasion. There is no attempt made to make this a religious event which is interesting given the venue. There is a clear spiritual element however as one would expect from Sting.Although this is rather a long way outside Sting's normal repertoire, his voice works very well in this context where, very wisely, he avoids the more strenuous higher range that he can favour in many of his own songs.The 'bonus' DVD provides an interesting documentary covering the making of the concert and interspersing this with stories and reminiscences with friends.The recording is of good quality with involving and clear camera work and imagining supported by nicely defined 5.1 surround sound.This pair of discs should provide lots of pleasure for Sting's regular admirers as well as being a pleasant surprise for others who may be attracted by the program but who may have doubts about the presentation. I would suggest that this is likely to be considered a good 5 stars worth by a great number of purchasers therefore.",5,Unusual concept but completely absorbing,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,1590,"['pair', 'discs', 'proved', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'successful', 'had', 'dared', 'hope', 'concert', 'disc', 'absorbing', 'selection', 'Christmas', '/', 'Winter', 'inspired', 'songs', 'largely', 'taken', 'much', 'earlier', 'generations', 'starting', 'medieval', 'period', 'onwards', 'more', 'modern', 'times', 'not', 'chronological', 'order.The', 'arrangements', 'are', 'tastefully', 'done', 'modern', 'slant', 'short', 'introductions', 'supplied', 'Sting', 'are', 'completely', 'interesting', 'being', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'short', 'delivery', 'relaxed', 'atmosphere', 'contributing', 'factor', 'success', 'occasion', 'attempt', 'made', 'make', 'religious', 'event', 'interesting', 'given', 'venue', 'clear', 'spiritual', 'element', 'however', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Sting.Although', 'rather', 'long', 'way', 'Sting', 'normal', 'repertoire', 'voice', 'very', 'well', 'context', 'where', 'very', 'wisely', 'more', 'strenuous', 'higher', 'range', 'can', 'favour', 'many', 'own', 'songs.The', ""'bonus"", 'DVD', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'covering', 'making', 'concert', 'interspersing', 'stories', 'reminiscences', 'friends.The', 'recording', 'good', 'quality', 'involving', 'clear', 'camera', 'work', 'imagining', 'supported', 'nicely', 'defined', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound.This', 'pair', 'discs', 'should', 'provide', 'lots', 'pleasure', 'Sting', 'regular', 'admirers', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'attracted', 'program', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'doubts', 'presentation', 'would', 'suggest', 'likely', 'be', 'considered', 'good', '5', 'stars', 'worth', 'great', 'number', 'purchasers', 'therefore']",N/A

The performance is fantastic, and the musicians combined to create a modern classic.  Someone wrote that this is self-indulgent, but I do not see how that is possible.  An artist--by definition--is someone who invents a product that is of his own making.  The problem is that some listeners and even some music critics seem bent on forcing an artist to conform to some sort of mainstream, which is not a characteristic I would expect from Sting.Having traveled in Europe, the setting for this Christmas concert is stunning.

1283768,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B002QCKOOW,Steffan Piper,"[7, 9]","I've been actively watching Sting release these very controlled and very planned out DVD performances for close to the last twenty years or so. The first one that caught my attention was the one made for theTen Summoner's Talesrelease. That was really the beginning of all these ideas that you see presented here, but this really is the best of everything thus far. A lot was learned from all previous releases like theAll This TimeDVD.Having watched this several times, I have to say that I was absolutely enthralled every time I put this on. The performances on the DVD are actually better than the performances that were done for the CD if you can believe that. I had been listening to the disk since it was released, off and on, and was very impressed at the overall performance of every song. Usually live versions fail to live up to studio recordings, but in this case it far outstrips them.The song `Soul Cake' on the CD is a very festive and a well played tune on the CD, but actually sounds a bit flat after a few listens. On the DVD however, the live version is actually mind-blowing and also includes a very dramatic reprise. My two and a half year old son, Fox, however loves this song and has to listen to it everyday now and sings along with it. Really ... what kid doesn't like some kind of cake? It's a very rousing and well done song. I also enjoyed the version played in the pub on the documentary.Also `Ghost Story', from theBrand New Dayalbum is played on here and is very infectious. The more I listen to this version, the more I get it. `The Hounds of Winter' played here is also the best treatment this song has yet seen, too. `Christmas at Sea' is easily one of my new favourites.I also want to point out that Sting, seemingly, decided at somepoint to drop the 'Pavarotti from Pomona' bit and sing all of these live in his usual tone and timbre. Maybe he decided after he heard the final cut of the album that he didn't like it either (to make note of the critics on this one) and just go natural. Perhaps it was too late to change what they had before the release or pressings and adjust the CD version.Also included on the DVD are several songs that should've been included on the album, but were not. Here's the play list for edification:1. The snow it melts the soonest.2. Gabriel's Message.3. Soul Cake.4. There is no rose of such virtue.5. Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming.6. Christmas at Sea.7. Now Winter Comes Slowly.8. Cold Song.9. The Burning Babe.10. Ghost Story.11. Team Spirit.12. The Hounds of Winter.13. Cherry Tree Carol.14. Balulalow.15. Bethlehem Down.16. Coventry Carol.17. Lullaby for an anxious child.18. I saw three ships.19. You only cross my mind in winter.The entire concert is breathtaking and very intimate. This is easily Sting's greatest release yet with as thoughtful and as polished as it is.These DVD's that are available, like `All This Time' give a very up-close and personal look at Sting, his life, his music and the development of the album which it accompanies. You would be hard pressed not to watch these concerts and documentaries with incredible fascination whether you be just a casual listener to Sting or modern music, an active participant in music on any level or just a movie-watcher. Some people who may not give two figs for Sting and what he's trying to offer up may find it a bit on the pretentious side and not understand it, but I think that would be unfair and not very considerate. The amount of work, thought and love that went into this production is very apparent and very appreciated. I can see this particular release becoming very popular through the years and inciting possibly some new standards with Christmas / Winter music with each new season. Perhaps this was the goal.The Documentary Disc is equally engaging. Hearing Sting's thoughts on his early stomping grounds and his thoughts on his family and music are worth the time. His ever thickening voice and his re-emerging accent from the proximity of being home is all worthwhile. There's a very interesting moment with him at a Farmer's Market and also some very touching stories about his difficult relationship with his father. Seeing this side of Sting and hearing about him as a lad definitely sheds some perspective on all the music which is much needed, as a person who listens can often come away with the feelign that he can be a bit detached.As a musician myself, all I can say is thank you for this production. It will be lasting as will the effect....",5,Better than the album ... another high water mark for Sting ...,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,4504,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'actively', 'watching', 'Sting', 'release', 'very', 'controlled', 'very', 'planned', 'out', 'DVD', 'performances', 'close', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'so', 'first', 'one', 'caught', 'attention', 'was', 'one', 'made', 'theTen', 'Summoner', 'Talesrelease', 'was', 'really', 'beginning', 'ideas', 'see', 'presented', 'here', 'really', 'best', 'everything', 'thus', 'far', 'lot', 'was', 'learned', 'previous', 'releases', 'theAll', 'TimeDVD.Having', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'absolutely', 'enthralled', 'time', 'put', 'performances', 'DVD', 'are', 'actually', 'better', 'performances', 'were', 'done', 'CD', 'can', 'believe', 'had', 'been', 'listening', 'disk', 'was', 'released', 'off', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'overall', 'performance', 'song', 'Usually', 'live', 'versions', 'fail', 'live', 'up', 'studio', 'recordings', 'case', 'far', 'them.The', 'song', 'Soul', 'Cake', 'CD', 'very', 'festive', 'well', 'played', 'tune', 'CD', 'actually', 'bit', 'flat', 'few', 'listens', 'DVD', 'however', 'live', 'version', 'actually', 'mind-blowing', 'also', 'very', 'dramatic', 'reprise', 'two', 'half', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Fox', 'however', 'song', 'listen', 'everyday', 'now', 'sings', 'Really', 'what', 'kid', ""n't"", 'like', 'kind', 'cake', 'very', 'rousing', 'well', 'done', 'song', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'version', 'played', 'pub', 'documentary.Also', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'theBrand', 'New', 'Dayalbum', 'played', 'here', 'very', 'infectious', 'more', 'listen', 'version', 'more', 'get', 'Hounds', 'Winter', 'played', 'here', 'also', 'best', 'treatment', 'song', 'yet', 'seen', 'too', 'Christmas', 'Sea', 'easily', 'one', 'new', 'favourites.I', 'also', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'Sting', 'seemingly', 'decided', 'somepoint', 'drop', ""'Pavarotti"", 'Pomona', 'bit', 'sing', 'live', 'usual', 'tone', 'timbre', 'Maybe', 'decided', 'heard', 'final', 'cut', 'album', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'note', 'critics', 'one', 'just', 'go', 'natural', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'change', 'what', 'had', 'release', 'pressings', 'adjust', 'CD', 'version.Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'several', 'songs', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'included', 'album', 'were', 'not', 'Here', 'play', 'list', 'edification:1', 'snow', 'soonest.2', 'Gabriel', 'Message.3', 'Soul', 'Cake.4', 'rose', 'such', 'virtue.5', 'Lo', 'How', 'Rose', ""E'er"", 'Blooming.6', 'Christmas', 'Sea.7', 'Now', 'Winter', 'Comes', 'Slowly.8', 'Cold', 'Song.9', 'Burning', 'Babe.10', 'Ghost', 'Story.11', 'Team', 'Spirit.12', 'Hounds', 'Winter.13', 'Cherry', 'Tree', 'Carol.14', 'Balulalow.15', 'Bethlehem', 'Down.16', 'Coventry', 'Carol.17', 'Lullaby', 'anxious', 'child.18', 'saw', 'three', 'ships.19', 'only', 'cross', 'mind', 'winter.The', 'entire', 'concert', 'breathtaking', 'very', 'intimate', 'easily', 'Sting', 'greatest', 'release', 'yet', 'thoughtful', 'as', 'polished', 'DVD', 'are', 'available', 'Time', 'give', 'very', 'up-close', 'personal', 'look', 'Sting', 'life', 'music', 'development', 'album', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'not', 'watch', 'concerts', 'documentaries', 'incredible', 'fascination', 'be', 'just', 'casual', 'listener', 'Sting', 'modern', 'music', 'active', 'participant', 'music', 'level', 'just', 'movie-watcher', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'give', 'two', 'figs', 'Sting', 'what', 'trying', 'offer', 'up', 'may', 'find', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'side', 'not', 'understand', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'not', 'very', 'considerate', 'amount', 'work', 'thought', 'love', 'went', 'production', 'very', 'apparent', 'very', 'appreciated', 'can', 'see', 'particular', 'release', 'becoming', 'very', 'popular', 'years', 'inciting', 'possibly', 'new', 'standards', 'Christmas', '/', 'Winter', 'music', 'new', 'season', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'goal.The', 'Documentary', 'Disc', 'equally', 'engaging', 'Hearing', 'Sting', 'thoughts', 'early', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'thoughts', 'family', 'music', 'are', 'time', 'ever', 'thickening', 'voice', 're-emerging', 'accent', 'proximity', 'being', 'home', 'worthwhile', 'very', 'interesting', 'moment', 'Farmer', 'Market', 'also', 'very', 'touching', 'stories', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'father', 'Seeing', 'side', 'Sting', 'hearing', 'about', 'lad', 'definitely', 'perspective', 'music', 'much', 'needed', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'often', 'come', 'away', 'feelign', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'musician', 'myself', 'can', 'say', 'thank', 'production', 'will', 'be', 'lasting', 'will', 'effect']",N/A
1283769,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,B002QCKOOW,T. Fisher,"[6, 6]","I am a conflicted fan from back in the Police days, who all things being equal was generally in agreement with the Stewart Copeland ""Sting wants to play everything to slow"" camp. That is a legacy of teenage taste I'm still struggling with that gives me a certain predisposition to see a lot of Sting's stuff as stodgy and pretentious. I certainly can understand and sympathize with people who take those negative views.But this DVD is a record of a remarkable concert, with outstanding musicianship and amazing production values. As much as I may be prejudiced against it, I have to recognize that it is simply too good to do anything else but take off my hat and congratulate Sting and all the musicians on a wonderful achievement.The music walks the line between traditional folk of the British Isles and classical, with a good dose of world/urban music coming in especially through the modern, and at times exotic percussion. It all blends together into a mass of wintry goodness.The music is still slow and complex. I'm not saying Sting has gone fast and exciting here -- this isn't party music. But if you are the kind of person who enjoys relaxing into slowness and getting lost in nuanced music, there is plenty to keep your attention here.The one thing I did find highly questionable was the lighting. Sunburst lights come out of the background, and the camera catches just the right angles at times to make it look like Sting is at the center of the sunburst. Well, in a cathedral setting this takes on a new significance. The DVD at times ends up giving Sting -- in strictly visual terms, at least -- a saintly if not downright divine quality. Dodgy to say the least.But if that's the biggest fault I can find, it must be pretty good. The documentary is great too -- Sting's return to Newcastle, giving us a little tour. As an old Police fan again, who knew the lore about Sting's early band in Newcastle, a Last Exit reunion was a pleasure to see. For a beer at least -- no playing.Bravo.
