943537,A34ZH5K0EHL8P0,B000BKDNX0,"Adam A. Fine ""Caretaker of the Arts""","[125, 164]","Filming the story of Gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio, from Warner Brothers to BBC. The Virgin Queen still retains her power to enthrall, intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne. She was perhaps England's last true absolute monarch, and certainly one of its greatest, if not most famous.Since the advent of film, she has been one of the most coveted roles to play. Indeed, few monarchs have been so closely chronicled, save perhaps her own father, Henry VIII, and Victoria.She has been portrayed by some of the most brilliant actresses: Sarah Bernhardt, Bette Davis, Judi Dench, Judith Anderson, Miranda Richardson, Flora Robson, Cate Blanchett, Helen Mirren, even Quentin Crisp, and most famously, and importantly, Glenda Jackson.And it must be said without doubt that Glenda Jackson's ""Elizabeth R"" is the defining portrait-- the most accomplished, historically accurate, and masterfully acted. Glenda Jackson is Elizabeth I reincarnate; there is simply none better, and likely never will be.So now we have Anne-Marie Duff in the red wig for 230 Masterpiece Theatre minutes. Perhaps for the sake of revisionists, we are offered a far less imperious monarch, one who is both reactive (the real one was) and passive (the real one was not). Duff is an odd choice. No beauty like Cate Blanchett, but Elizabeth was known for vanity, not beauty. Duff's Elizabeth, with quivering lip and watercolor behavior, seems filmed underwater, and make for an undesirable monarch-- certainly not the Gloriana of myth or fact. Where is her famous wit, her coy manipulations, her strong moral fiber, her intense devotion to state and loyal courtiers? Left with Glenda Jackson, I suppose. This Elizabeth is a simpering, love-struck maiden or a crass, 60-something hag (and only then do we see bits of fire in the performance). Hag works; crass manages; simpering loses the whole impact.A suavely elegant, very attractive and distinctly healthy Queen Mary I opens Elizabeth's story (no Catharine Parr, no Thomas Seymour, no childhood) but is quickly dispatched. Just as well, for she's thoroughly ill-cast--Mary was none of those things. (Far better was the wonderful Kathy Burke in the Blanchett version, though she was a bit of a Protestant caricature). Daphne Slater in the Jackson series was far more appealing, and perfectly written.Elizabeth's transition from prisoner to crown is possibly the greatest story of her long life. No part of her history defines and creates her personality more than these years-- the abuse by Seymour, imprisonment, exile, and finally her accession. Unfortunately, much of this key period is sped through. The fatal flaw in the series is the decision to cast Elizabeth mooning incessantly over Robert Dudley, later Earl of Leicester, here played by a childish, petulant Tom Hardy. There is no chemistry here; he is pretty, but vacant. Glenda Jackson's Dudley, Robert Hardy (no relation that I know of), is a bit of a fop, but he knows his place in court and Elizabeth's heart. Their chemistry is clear. This version of Dudley is a bit ridiculous-- how he would claim the Queen's heart for more than 30 years is a mystery in this performance. So is most of the casting (what's with the acrobat?)An egregious error in this production is the portrayal of suicide by Dudley's long-suffering wife Amy Robsart, whose death at 26 in 1560 remains to this day a mystery. More time should have been spent on the wooing of Elizabeth by the French Duc d'Alencon, who very nearly came to be her husband (again, the 1971 Glenda Jackson version handles this segment masterfully).All too soon and without sufficient explanation, we become immersed in the historically key, decades-long battle of wills and imprisonment of the impetuous Mary, Queen of Scots-- Elizabeth's 2nd cousin, granddaughter of Henry VIII's older sister Margaret, whose claim to the English throne made her a rallying point of Catholics, and a very real threat to Elizabeth (it was Mary's son James who succeeded Elizabeth in 1603, founding the ill-fated House of Stuart).Far more attention should have been paid to the case for and subsequent execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, which was Elizabeth's darkest hour-- forever bloodying her saintly propaganda. Likewise, more attention should have been given to Walshingham, Elizabeth's master of subversion, although William Cecil, Lord Burghley, is given fair due.The decisive Armada happens much too quickly, lessening its impact and giving far too much time to be spent on the stormy relationship of Elizabeth and Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, portrayed by Hans Matheson, who is cast and directed as a bad-tempered, bipolar ""Mama's Boy"" (a very strange Oedipal twist here) whose hair, look and even attire speak far more to 2005 than 1585. The entire second half of the production is brought down by this admittedly strange relationship, here given a basketful of psychological issues left to the viewer to consider unraveling. The casting is awful, the acting mediocre, the personality baffling. This Essex is a wreck-- blame the revisionist director.Two significant annoyances: Elizabeth's (Duff's) accent isn't simply London middle-class, which would be fine, but stands in stark contrast to everyone else's appropriate English diction and clarity. She comes off as a guttersnipe. And worse of all-- distracting to the utmost-- is the incessant soundtrack that dominates--and not pleasantly-- the action and plot of the movie. The sheer volume of it is horrendous, to say nothing of the attempts at mixing courtly historical period music with Essex's electric guitar.My suggestion here is to rent this one, watch it as long as you can, and then return to Davis, Blanchett, Jackson, or even Dench. Overall, a disappointment. Were it not for 95% historical accuracy and enjoyable period costumes-- plus the decent acting (most of the problems are the director's fault, don't blame the actors), it would have earned one star. But this Queen is no legend, and this cast is horrendous. An inglorious Gloriana.",2,"A watery, passive, poorly cast, revisionist production",1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,6094,"['Filming', 'story', 'Gloriana', 'virtual', 'guarantee', 'success',

Her father, Henry VIII, desired a son so much he took six wives--ironically,his daughter took the throne. ""The Virgin Queen"" is a step far below the famous portrayals of Glenda Jackson, Cate Blanchett, and even Quentin Crisp(!!!)In ""The Virgin Queen"",Ann-Marie Duff portrays England's first female monarch as a bland,lifeless,definitely sexless woman. She is in constant voice-over mode, giving pathetic looks. Luckily, she has stronger co-stars. Sienna Guillory shines as a scheming,envious,cruel lady in-waiting. She's cold,calculating,yet lively. Guillory is excellent as the royal con woman. Hans Matheson,who's given bland portrayals of King Arthur's illegitimate son Mordred and Doctor Zhivago,is equally great as Guillory's Oedipal son. The villains steal the show. Elizabeth I is the victim of circumstance,and has the same dull expression on her face whether she's deeply in love or executing an enemy. Duff is a dull actress. ""The Virgin Queen"" leaves it open to interpretation whether she had a lover (according to Hilaire Belloc's prurient ""Characters of the Reformation"",she was physically handicapped,'deformed in mind&body;',incapable of regular relations with men but doing things with them constantly,going into Gossip Girl mode)""The Virgin Queen"" is bland and lifeless.

Anne-Marie Duff makes a great Elizabeth, and she is supported by an equally talented cast.  The sets, lighting, costuming and direction are good, and the makeup artists did a terrific job of aging Duff as the movie progressed.  I occasionally found the music too much; it sometimes seemed loud and overwhelmed the action, but overall I enjoyed it.The catch is that the concept of the movie works better in theory than it does in practice.  The Virgin Queen, as the title indicates, focuses on Elizabeth's personal relationships, most specifically her love interests.  To an extent, limiting the program makes sense; Elizabeth was about 69 at her death, and ascended to the throne at 25.  However, over all, Elizabeth's relationships were unusually embarrassing and sad, and to focus on them to the near-exclusion of the other events in her life leaves us with little more than a gossipy, costumed soap opera.  While the events depicted are factual--except where artistic license is used to explain murky aspects--Elizabeth often comes of as a bit trite, and the real queen, for all of her capriciousness, was anything but trite. She saw her kingdom through massive changes, left it stronger than she found it, and was so influential that her reign is still considered a golden age.There are some genuinely touching moments, and the production is of good quality.

I've never liked her.  Admired her accomplishments, her confidence, her intelligence, her savvy and street-smarts, maybe, but...like her?  No.  And yet, here, in an entirely un-retouched portrait of the woman, I finally found a human being I could understand and...maybe not quite like, but certainly care about and root for.  Plus, the film is just so darn well done.  I just couldn't bear to finish watching it, and I'll tell you why, but first...This film has an authentic period sensibility that succeeds at rendering the characters humanly sympathetic to a modern audience, without resorting to anachronisms to do so.  Costumes, settings, language, situations, and the values of the characters are all in keeping with their time and place.  This Elizabeth biopic is more than satisfying from a historical angle.From a purely story point of view, this telling of the Virgin Queen's life is as full of hooks as a blackberry bramble.  Almost from the first shot, you see characters' motives and goals on a collision-course with their circumstances and with other characters.  In short order the writing, directing, and performances create characters whose collisions are going to matter to you.

943577,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B000BKDNX0,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[144, 153]","This is a very interesting programme, produced in Britain and originally shown on the PBS series, Masterpiece Theatre.This miniseries was directed by Coky Giedroyc, a veteran of television productions in Britain, including another royal-themed miniseries, 'William and Mary', in 2003.  Giedroyc brings an interesting modern twist to the series - rather than filming things in majestic, sweeping camera pans with classical music as a background, and rather than having the dialogue (and acting) be in a stilted, falsely formal style, Giedroyc incorporates modern music with medieval and Celtic flavouring to it (both of which have experienced a renaissance of sorts in the past decade), and the situations are decidedly modern without being out of place in their own times.This presents the life of Elizabeth from her young adulthood under Queen Mary, as a supposed participant in intrigues against the Catholic Queen, through to her death after serving decades on the throne of England as the Virgin Queen, the queen who never married.  In fact, the miniseries plays a tantalising game with Elizabeth's virginity, showing her desires (as well as those around her) without ever giving up the game of 'was she or wasn't she?'  Anne-Marie Duff  plays the part of Elizabeth, and does a remarkably able job for such a complex figure.  Duff won the Irish Television award and was nominated for the BAFTA award for best actress in a television drama in another series, 'Shameless', last year.Duff is joined by Tom Hardy, who plays the role of Robert Dudley, the favourite of Queen Elizabeth.  Dudley is also an extraordinarily complex role, as he played several sides in the political struggles during Elizabeth's early reign, and was part of a family well experienced in regal intrigue - Robert Dudley's family had tried to manage the reign of Elizabeth's brother Edward, engineer the accession of Lady Jane Grey (placing Guildford Dudley on the throne with her), and is sometimes referred to as 'the uncrowned kings of England'.  In fact, perhaps the most stunning single scene in this miniseries is after Elizabeth has elevated Robert Dudley to the earldom of Leicester, and during her illness, he sits upon the throne as the protector of the realm.  Hardy is well suited to this role, and plays it with skill.The sets are appropriate to their time period, neither too ornate nor too medieval; the costumes also have a touch of modernity to them, but are still primarily of the period.  The situations presented give good insight into the overall pattern of Elizabeth's reign and some of the principal concerns during that time period, although to compress such a long reign into such a short time frame as a four-hour miniseries by necessity means that the history has had to be selectively chosen.  Elizabeth faced problems from without and within, many of which were far more complex and pressing than her marriage issue.  In the end, Elizabeth made the right decision for the time, if not for the future.This is a great production for television, and holds up well against other major productions featuring the Virgin Queen Elizabeth of a few years ago.",5,"Elizabethan drama, literally",1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,3153,"['very', 'interesting', 'programme', 'produced', 'Britain', 'originally', 'shown', 'PBS', 'series', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre.This', 'miniseries', 'was', 'directed', 'Coky', 'Giedroyc', 'veteran', 'television', 'productions', 'Britain', 'including', 'royal-themed', 'miniseries', ""'William"", 'Mary', '2003', 'Giedroyc', 'interesting', 'modern', 'twist', 'series', 'rather', 'filming', 'things', 'majestic', 'sweeping', 'camera', 'pans', 'classical', 'music', 'background', 'rather', 'having', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'be', 'stilted', 'falsely', 'formal', 'style', 'Giedroyc', 'modern', 'music', 'medieval', 'Celtic', 'flavouring', 'have', 'experienced', 'renaissance', 'sorts', 'past', 'decade', 'situations', 'are', 'decidedly', 'modern', 'being', 'place', 'own', 'times.This', 'life', 'Elizabeth', 'young', 'adulthood', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'supposed', 'participant', 'intrigues', 'Catholic', 'Queen', 'death', 'serving', 'decades', 'throne', 'England', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'queen', 'who', 'never', 'married', 'fact', 'miniseries', 'tantalising', 'game', 'Elizabeth', 'virginity', 'showing', 'desires', 'as', 'well', 'ever', 'giving', 'up', 'game', ""'was"", 'was', ""n't"", 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'part', 'Elizabeth', 'remarkably', 'able', 'job', 'such', 'complex', 'figure', 'Duff', 'won', 'Irish', 'Television', 'award', 'was', 'nominated', 'BAFTA', 'award', 'best', 'actress', 'television', 'drama', 'series', ""'Shameless"", 'last', 'year.Duff', 'joined', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'who', 'role', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'favourite', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Dudley', 'also', 'extraordinarily', 'complex', 'role', 'played', 'several', 'sides', 'political', 'struggles', 'Elizabeth', 'early', 'reign', 'was', 'part', 'family', 'well', 'experienced', 'regal', 'intrigue', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'family', 'had', 'tried', 'manage', 'reign', 'Elizabeth', 'brother', 'Edward', 'accession', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'placing', 'Guildford', 'Dudley', 'throne', 'sometimes', 'referred', ""'the"", 'uncrowned', 'kings', 'England', 'fact', 'perhaps', 'most', 'stunning', 'single', 'scene', 'miniseries', 'Elizabeth', 'elevated', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'earldom', 'Leicester', 'illness', 'throne', 'protector', 'realm', 'Hardy', 'well', 'suited', 'role', 'skill.The', 'sets', 'are', 'appropriate', 'time', 'period', 'too', 'ornate', 'too', 'medieval', 'costumes', 'also', 'have', 'touch', 'modernity', 'are', 'still', 'primarily', 'period', 'situations', 'presented', 'give', 'good', 'insight', 'overall', 'pattern', 'Elizabeth', 'reign', 'principal', 'concerns', 'time', 'period', 'compress', 'long', 'reign', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'four-hour', 'miniseries', 'necessity', 'means', 'history', 'had', 'be', 'selectively', 'chosen', 'Elizabeth', 'faced', 'problems', 'many', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'pressing', 'marriage', 'issue', 'end', 'Elizabeth', 'made', 'right', 'decision', 'time', 'not', 'future.This', 'great', 'production', 'television', 'up', 'well', 'other', 'major', 'productions', 'featuring', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'few', 'years', 'ago']",Masterpiece Theatre: Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen

A lot of the events are portrayed in discussion or letters as is the death of Dudley and the defeat of the Spanish Armada, though a stirring recreation of Elizabeth's speech to the troops at Tilbury is a highlight of the film. The film does well in it's use of real quotes together with more modern usage of conversation. Great costumes and sceneryThe death of Amy Robsart (Emila Fox) , Dudley's wife is portrayed as s suicide, though one that Dudley reacts callously to and the Elizabeth's rivalry with Lettice Knollys (Sienna Gillory) is part of the focus.The last part deals with Elizabeth devotion to the young Robert Devereaux (Hans Mattheson) , Earlf of Essex, and frames Essex plot against Elizabeth as being intigated by his mother Lettice.Anne Marie Duff portrays Elizabeth quite expertly. Effortlessly playing the role of a young Elizabeth through to her aging and death. Elizabeth is revealed as wise, strong, devoted to her country and people, at times capricious and ruthless when necessary. Her anguish at being forced to sign the death warrant of Mary Queen of Scots is revealed in a dream of herself being executed in Mary's place.

943592,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B000BKDNX0,Jeff  Farrow,"[15, 15]","In the past 5 years or so I've watched close to 8 to 10 films about Elizabeth I. I've always been fascinated by the Tudors & their tumultuous times. Like other history fans, I have my favorite characters--and villains. Fortunately, Elizabeth is on the favorites list (AND Mary, Queen of Scots--figure that one out.). After watching a number of extremely brilliant women actors in the role, I thought it was getting a bit ridiculous to see an English Queen running around telling just about everybody, ""I'm a Virgin, I'm a Virgin, I'm a Virgin!"" Good grief--shades of The Material Girl! Well, of course there was a good reason for that. I think most historians agree that Elizabeth skillfully allied her political reputation to the high level of adoration the people of the period (even Protestants) felt for the Blessed Virgin Mary. Then there's the practical reality that being virgo intacta was vital to be a player in the European monarchial marriage game. This too Elizabeth played to her advantage. By keeping kings & countries waiting & guessing on her next move, Elizabeth felt relatively safe and--perhaps more importantly, on the strictly personal level--garnered her the verbal romantic attention she seemed to obsessively crave.Coky Giedroyc, director of this production stated, ""Elizabeth had...a real pathological fear of intimacy. Her father (Henry VIII) represented everything male, and once you get close to a man you get killed..."" She also had her mother's fate to reflect on. Even a naughty queen can lose her head--especially if her hubby was good ol' Henry (a Tudor definitely NOT on my favorites list--but his cast-off wife Katherine of Aragon is.) Elizabeth was considered an ""enlightened"" queen, even an intellectual (in an age when it was considered very suspicious for a woman to have ideas of her own.) Nonetheless, she was a child of her violent time, and was not adverse to employing torture & deception in her struggle to keep her throne. Still, she was better than most of her contemporaries and she clearly possessed a highly tuned conscience.I'd never seen Anne-Marie Duff before. Hers is not the tall, killer blonde type; but rather she is short, elfin, with flowing, strawberry blonde hair (at least in this film.) And she possess an inner charm, a real charisma and intellectual radiance. She is perfect for the role of Elizabeth. She appears to effortless generate regal majesty, and that is as much matter of personal character as it is of acting skill.There are three scenes from the film that stand in my mind.The first was the opening (a good omen of enjoyment to come.) A teenage Elizabeth has been banished to The Tower by her bitter, paranoid half-sister, Mary. She is talking with ladies-in-waiting, when they hear soldiers approaching. They scramble to set a scene of humble piety by hiding things & ""straightening up."" One of the ladies tosses a rosary like a football to Elizabeth, who catches it in mid-air.The second scene is not far from the first. Mary has died & Elizabeth becomes the new Queen. She is in a triumphal procession weaving through the streets London. Here Anne-Marie Duff is at her most radiant, showering the people with her gratitude & basking in the love they had for her. It's ironic that the common folk loved Elizabeth almost in proportion to how much they hated her mother (Anne Boleyn.) In a similar sort of twist, the people disliked Queen Mary (Tudor) as much as they loved her mother, the divorced Queen KatherineThe third scene is near the end of the picture. Elizabeth is old & near the end of her days. She is standing at the end of a large outdoor court while her new, very young ladies-in-waiting stand at the opposite end surreptitiously watching her. Elizabeth is so caught up thinking about the past that she seems unaware of their critical stare. In her mind she hears a song  from her bygone youth, and begins to rather awkwardly--and feebly--dance to the tune. To the maids she's an object of ridicule & they parody her movements in a dance they find hopeless old fashioned. It is a poignant scene reflecting the relentless nature of time & the cruel honesty of youth--and it reminds us that, in the end, Elizabeth was a vulnerable human being too.Another aspect I appreciate about this ""Elizabeth,"" is that it was mercifully brief & fairly neutral in the depiction of the rivalry between Elizabeth Tudor & her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots. British films have almost invariably portrayed Mary Stuart as either an idiot, or a sex-driven demon out to bring the Inquisition into England. Neither is true, but there's little doubt that had Mary ascended to the English crown, it would have been a full-blown disaster for all concerned.The supporting cast & essential production values are of the highest quality.

Though not precisely historical, the miniseries is attractively filmed, and the lead Anne-Marie Duff plays Elizabeth to the hilt, from young princess to aging and sour-faced queen. The famous speech at Tilbury seems to be a requisite of any life of Elizabeth, and it's here, on the eve of her victory over the Spanish Armada (mostly helped by a titanic storm) but the military intrigues are often off-screen. It's the intrigue to keep her or get her off the throne that takes center stage.Tom Hardy plays an excellent Robert Dudley and he's aged from beautiful youth to tired middle-aged or almost-middle aged man well by some terrific make up artistry. The costuming is equally beautiful, often focusing on the jewels rather than the ""twenty pounds of gorgeousness"" as I heard someone once describe Tudor costume.The music is a mix of chanting by Bulgarian women's choirs (that sound is unmistakable and haunting), new compositions by Martin Phipps and Latin chanting by the Mediaeval Baebes. It's stunning music, sad that the soundtrack is not available except at ridiculous asking prices. It really adds to the drama.

Anne Marie Duff becomes Elizabeth brilliantly.  The series opens on the youthful princess and heir, living as the prisoner of her sister, Queen Mary.  We ascend with her, sharing in the remarkable events of Britain's renaissance, coming to rest with the aged Queen, who remained standing in her chambers throughout the course of a day fearing she would be unable to rise again should she rest.  (I believe this really happened.)  Tom Hardy is fresh and sensitive as her constant friend and servant, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.  Tara Fitzgerald is luminous as Kate Ashley, the Queen's lady.  Each cast member in this detailed presentation is excellent!  Be sure to listen for the energized soundtrack that provides so much texture:  composed by Martin Phipps, godson of Benjamin Britten, and performed with high energy by the Mediaeval Baebes.  A tip to travelers:  When in London be sure to allow time for a tour of Westminster Abbey to see the tombs of Queens Elizabeth I, Mary and Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, among many others.

The Tudors were a strong and intelligent family. Being a daughter of Henry VIII would have been a tough position for anyone to be in. Elizabeth had to be a perceptive and intelligent survivor to have had such a successful reign as Queen of England.This film begins with a young Princess Elizabeth locked in the Tower of London by her half sister Queen Mary. I liked the beginning very much because it shows the possibility of what the relationship between the two sisters might have been like. Elizabeth afraid and not knowing what would happen to her or if she would even live.  Her sister Queen Mary, unloved and a pawn for both England and Spain.Then suddenly Queen Mary dies and Elizabeth is now Queen Elizabeth.  A position she was educated for but never thought to attain.  This time she rules and learns how to run her court.  At first, she is unsure of herself and leaning heavily on her advisors, but eventually honing her own skills and trying to chose her advisors with care. She faces a nation divided by religion and a court full of intrigue. She was also skirting the issue of marriage which she was very much afraid of.  She became know as the ""virgin queen.""  How difficult was that in a male dominated world?  She was surrounded by several men who attempted to seduce her and was possibly in love with Robert Dudley who already had a wife.Then the other Queen Mary comes into play.the charming Queen of Scotland, Mary Stuart who also had a claim to the English throne. A cousin queen for Elizabeth to fear, but possibly the only other person alive who could understand her situation.  Unfortunately the two queens never met which is sad, because they were related and shared a huge place in history. I've often wondered if Queen Elizabeth regretted putting her cousin to death.Anne-Marie Duff did an extraordinary job in her starring performance as Queen Elizabeth. She took the character from a young and fearful princess to a strong and powerful Queen of England.This is a marvelous production!",5,-----An excellent look at Queen Elizabeth I-----,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,2137,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'books', 'life', 'times', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'felt', 'film', 'true', 'many', 'ways', 'Tudors', 'were', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'family', 'Being', 'daughter', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tough', 'position', 'anyone', 'be', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'be', 'perceptive', 'intelligent', 'survivor', 'have', 'had', 'successful', 'reign', 'Queen', 'England.This', 'film', 'young', 'Princess', 'Elizabeth', 'locked', 'Tower', 'London', 'half', 'sister', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'liked', 'beginning', 'very', 'much', 'possibility', 'what', 'relationship', 'two', 'sisters', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Elizabeth', 'afraid', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'would', 'even', 'live', 'sister', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'unloved', 'pawn', 'England', 'Spain.Then', 'suddenly', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'dies', 'Elizabeth', 'now', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'position', 'was', 'educated', 'never', 'thought', 'attain', 'time', 'rules', 'how', 'run', 'court', 'first', 'unsure', 'herself', 'leaning', 'heavily', 'advisors', 'eventually', 'honing', 'own', 'skills', 'trying', 'chose', 'advisors', 'care', 'nation', 'divided', 'religion', 'court', 'full', 'intrigue', 'was', 'also', 'skirting', 'issue', 'marriage', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'afraid', 'became', 'know', 'virgin', 'queen', 'How', 'difficult', 'was', 'male', 'dominated', 'world', 'was', 'surrounded', 'several', 'men', 'who', 'attempted', 'seduce', 'was', 'possibly', 'love', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'who', 'already', 'had', 'wife.Then', 'other', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'play.the', 'charming', 'Queen', 'Scotland', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'claim', 'English', 'throne', 'cousin', 'queen', 'Elizabeth', 'fear', 'possibly', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'alive', 'who', 'could', 'understand', 'situation', 'Unfortunately', 'two', 'queens', 'never', 'met', 'sad', 'were', 'related', 'shared', 'huge', 'place', 'history', ""'ve"", 'often', 'wondered', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'regretted', 'putting', 'cousin', 'death.Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'did', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'starring', 'performance', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'took', 'character', 'young', 'fearful', 'princess', 'strong', 'powerful', 'Queen', 'England.This', 'marvelous', 'production']",Masterpiece Theatre: Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen

943637,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BKDNX0,mirasreviews,"[7, 7]","This 2005 BBC miniseries ""The Virgin Queen"" follows the life of Queen Elizabeth I (Anne-Marie Duff) from her confinement by half-sister Queen Mary on suspicion of treason, through Elizabeth's ascendancy to the throne of England at age 25, to the end of her 44-year reign as England's never-married ""virgin queen"". The aesthetic is generally dark, as most of the film takes places in dimly lit, unwelcoming interiors that contrast with the Queen's dazzling wardrobe. ""The Virgin Queen"" is more historically accurate than the 1998 feature film ""Elizabeth"" that starred Cate Blanchett, but this production places more emphasis on Queen Elizabeth's personal life than on her political accomplishments. Particular attention is paid to her resistance to marriage in the face of many suitors, her affectionate relationship with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Tom Hardy), and with her ill-fated prot&eacute;g&eacute; Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex (Hans Matheson) late in life.American and British audiences will undoubtedly view ""The Virgin Queen"" differently and quarrel with different points. I presume that Brits will be more rigorous with historical accuracy, the interpretation of the Queen Elizabeth's personality, and inconsistencies in the accents. Americans are more likely to simply have trouble following the events, because the film skips large periods of time. If viewers are not familiar with the history, they will have no idea how much time has actually passed. Mary Queen of Scots was confined for 18 years, but, if you didn't know that, you might get the impression that it was only a few months. The make-up department runs away with the show as it progresses. They did a spectacular job of aging the actors. I've never seen such realistic and thorough aging make-up before. Perhaps the make-up and costumes outshine a mediocre script, but I enjoyed looking at them, and I was impressed by Anne-Marie Duff's portrayal of the aged Queen in the last years of her reign.",4,"Enjoyable, Though Not Insightful or Rigorous, Look at Queen Elizabeth's Life.",1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,1982,"['2005', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'life', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'confinement', 'half-sister', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'suspicion', 'treason', 'Elizabeth', 'ascendancy', 'throne', 'England', 'age', '25', 'end', '44-year', 'reign', 'England', 'never-married', 'virgin', 'queen', 'aesthetic', 'generally', 'dark', 'most', 'film', 'places', 'dimly', 'lit', 'unwelcoming', 'interiors', 'contrast', 'Queen', 'dazzling', 'wardrobe', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', '1998', 'feature', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'starred', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'production', 'more', 'emphasis', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'personal', 'life', 'political', 'accomplishments', 'Particular', 'attention', 'paid', 'resistance', 'marriage', 'face', 'many', 'suitors', 'affectionate', 'relationship', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'Earl', 'Leicester', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'ill-fated', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Robert', 'Devereux', 'Earl', 'Essex', 'Hans', 'Matheson', 'late', 'life.American', 'British', 'audiences', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'view', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'differently', 'quarrel', 'different', 'points', 'presume', 'Brits', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'rigorous', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'interpretation', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'personality', 'inconsistencies', 'accents', 'Americans', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'simply', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'events', 'film', 'skips', 'large', 'periods', 'time', 'viewers', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'history', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'actually', 'passed', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'was', 'confined', '18', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'might', 'get', 'impression', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'make-up', 'department', 'away', 'show', 'did', 'spectacular', 'job', 'aging', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'such', 'realistic', 'thorough', 'aging', 'make-up', 'Perhaps', 'make-up', 'costumes', 'outshine', 'mediocre', 'script', 'enjoyed', 'looking', 'was', 'impressed', 'Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'portrayal', 'aged', 'Queen', 'last', 'years', 'reign']",Masterpiece Theatre: Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen
943638,A1G6563GKNEXPA,B000BKDNX0,M. Lucas,"[9, 12]","I am endlessly fascinated by anything Tudor, and as far as movies on this subject go, this is the best thing available.  It has everything we expect of a Masterpiece Theater production, as far as costumes, sets, and historical accuracy.  This however also has a fantastic dramatic quality. The way things are shot and the way the music is used throughout is stellar, and the entire thing has a very modern feel to it. These are historical figures that we are all familiar with, but they are made very human and relatable here.Ann Marie Duff is excellent in the role.  I have seen her in several other films and this is her best work. I especially enjoy her in the second half as the aging queen.  It is heartbreaking to see the young members of the court mocking her and being disrespectful to the woman who has given her entire life to thier country. An example of this is when her young ladies in waiting break into her jewel box where she keeps the only things private to her; a portrait of Kat Ashley, and Dudley's last letter.  They also make fun of her dancing: the same dance we see earlier in the film as the popular new dance at court. Ann Marie Duff portrays this complex time of the queens life wonderfully; she is moving.  Another beautiful part is when Elizabeth learns that her sister is dead and she will be queen.  The look on her face as she runs across the field is of pure relief.  She is not as happy about actually becoming queen as she is that her life is less threatened now, and she will be a prisoner no more. The irony is that she is the most powerful woman in the country yet her life is the most strictly governed of all.  Her life is not her own.I love the music which I think helped to keep the whole thing fresh. I was also happy to see that a makeup artist was finally able to age an actor successfully without making her look like plastic.  If you have enjoyed the Phillippa Gregory books on the Tudors, or the Cate Blanchett movie about Elizabeth, this film will be quite pleasing. It brings the former to life, and expands on the latter.  If you like The Virgin Queen, you might also like The Last King which chronicles the reign of Charles II and also stars Ann Marie Duff.",5,Everything I wanted,1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,2209,"['am', 'endlessly', 'fascinated', 'anything', 'Tudor', 'as', 'far', 'movies', 'subject', 'go', 'best', 'thing', 'available', 'everything', 'expect', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'production', 'as', 'far', 'costumes', 'sets', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'however', 'also', 'fantastic', 'dramatic', 'quality', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'shot', 'way', 'music', 'used', 'stellar', 'entire', 'thing', 'very', 'modern', 'feel', 'are', 'historical', 'figures', 'are', 'familiar', 'are', 'made', 'very', 'human', 'relatable', 'here.Ann', 'Marie', 'Duff', 'excellent', 'role', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'best', 'work', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'second', 'half', 'aging', 'queen', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'young', 'members', 'court', 'mocking', 'being', 'disrespectful', 'woman', 'who', 'given', 'entire', 'life', 'thier', 'country', 'example', 'when', 'young', 'ladies', 'waiting', 'break', 'jewel', 'box', 'where', 'only', 'things', 'private', 'portrait', 'Kat', 'Ashley', 'Dudley', 'last', 'letter', 'also', 'make', 'fun', 'dancing', 'same', 'dance', 'see', 'earlier', 'film', 'popular', 'new', 'dance', 'court', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'Duff', 'complex', 'time', 'queens', 'life', 'wonderfully', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'part', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'sister', 'dead', 'will', 'be', 'queen', 'look', 'face', 'field', 'pure', 'relief', 'not', 'happy', 'actually', 'becoming', 'queen', 'life', 'less', 'threatened', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'prisoner', 'more', 'irony', 'most', 'powerful', 'woman', 'country', 'yet', 'life', 'most', 'strictly', 'governed', 'life', 'not', 'own.I', 'music', 'think', 'helped', 'keep', 'whole', 'thing', 'fresh', 'was', 'also', 'happy', 'see', 'makeup', 'artist', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'age', 'actor', 'successfully', 'making', 'look', 'plastic', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Phillippa', 'Gregory', 'books', 'Tudors', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'movie', 'Elizabeth', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'pleasing', 'former', 'life', 'latter', 'like', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'might', 'also', 'Last', 'King', 'reign', 'Charles', 'II', 'also', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'Duff']",Masterpiece Theatre: Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen

But to me, I thought Anne-Marie Duff's performance was quite amazing.  The question is, was this the correct portrayal?  In this production, Elizabeth seemed more of real person than some haughty character you see in films.  It showed her flaws, rawness and scenes where it was not overdone with a grandiose sense she was this all mighty powerful goddess where she would strike you down.  She was a queen, a real person.  The scene where E I came out to her subjects on her horse was quite amazing, moving but again not ""Hollywoodized"" like in films.  I've always thought that portraying a real person seemed entertaining in that Hollywood way but you think was that really the real person?  I often think if you met the person they probably aren't that exciting in real life.  I much prefer the real nature the real character of the real person and the actual sense of what happened then - this is not Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter this is real life person in real situations that happened.  This portrayal seemed just that.  Plus, here is another thing to consider why this seemed more accurate.  With all the tribulations she had gone through in her early years of her life I would think this caused her to be ""wild"" and not so calm and cool.  Also she was Henry the VIII's daughter.  Henry VIII had quite the temperament and wildness about him so it would make sense E I would also have at least some of that.  Lastly, this is the 1500's.  I think people in Britain in those days were on edge under the circumstances.  It's not a time to be looking good and casual.  As to her looks, Anne Marie's I think is closer to the real person at least closer than Cate Blanchett and Helen Mirren.  Elizabeth I was not a Hollywood actress, folks!!

Although I thought Anne Marie Duff looked more like the real Elizabeth I than other portrayals of the queen, her middle class English accent was annoying and unlike what I imagine Elizabeth I really sounded like with her upper class London accent. I actually enjoyed Tom Hardy's portrayal of the seductive ""Sweet Robin"" more than Anne Marie Duff's portrayal. Her acting was too forced, did not have enough power, and again, the accent was bothersome. My favorite part was the very end, when they discover a hidden compartment in her ring (the real ring resides in a private collection today).My question is this? When is the woman who was born to play Queen Elizabeth I ever going to do so? If you don't know who I mean, it should be Tilda Swinton. I would give anything to see Tilda Swinton play this part. She is a supreme actor as well as a British aristocrat. She also has the most uncanny resemblence to Elizabeth with her long face and nose, and red hair. For those of who that recently saw Narnia, you will know what I mean.Until Tilda Swinton plays Elizabeth, Glenda Jackson will always claim the definitive portrayal of Elizabeth I.

It really captured the general emotion and lured you into the moment. Sometimes the music was a bit modern which, for some, can be problematic. But, I loved the soundtrack and downloaded it on Itunes. So good!Casting: Anne-Marie Duff and Tom Hardy have great chemistry. Tom is obviously extremely attractive, and was clearly cast in the role base on that. But he does a great job at capturing Dudley and the many sides to his personality: politically driven, romantic, sensual, luring, calculated...etc. I would like to see more of him in period pieces. Anne-Marie is not what I would say to be absolutely perfect for this role, but she does do a great job. I simply don't think she was able to capture the authoritative side of Elizabeth. She tries, but it comes across a bit more like a whiny, petulant child, than a powerful woman. She does, however, capture the emotional, feminine side extremely well. The way she looks is perfect for the role.

943684,A385GX0LP1QSKG,B000BKDNX0,"tudortwo ""twodoor2""","[10, 13]","Tudor enthusiasts, such as myself, will obviously make comparisons of this series to the Holy Grail of Elizabeth portrayals - that being Glenda Jackson in the 1970's Masterpiece Theatre mini-series ""Elizabeth R"".  Anne Marie Duff is no  Glenda Jackson.  I think she made for a more subdued Elizabeth, especially in part I of this mini-series.  ""Elizabeth R"" is also a much longer mini-series (9 hours) so it delves more deeply into historical occurrences.I was constantly distracted by Duff's middle-class English accent, but I am a purist - just call me stuffy.  Fortunately, most people will not notice this, especially in the United States.  One favorable factor for Duff is that I happen to think she resembles Elizabeth more than any other actress that has ever portrayed the Queen.  If you look at the famous unfinished miniature of Elizabeth by Isaac Oliver, a portrait that experts regard as a very authentic likeness, Anne Marie Duff is a dead-on resemblance (which is probably a major factor in her obtaining this part).As for the acting, much of the language has been modernized and not as true to the authentic speeches and quotes from the Queen. ""Elizabeth R"" is more authentic in this regard.  The costumes and sets were probably the major stars of this film.  I did admire the fact that they didn't throw her in bed with Robert Dudley (Elizabeth's great love) as they do in my most portrayals.  Also, most speculative occurrences, like how Amy Robsart died (suicide, accident or murder)  or Mary, Queen of Scott's coded letters of treason, are given artistic license;  the script writers freely provide their own version of what actually happened, ignoring historical fact.In conclusion, I think it did a fine job showing the Queen to be the strong and brave woman devoted to her Kingdom and people that she undoubtedly was. This is an admirable presentation, and a far better and more authentic portrayal than Shekkar Kapur's disaster ""Elizabeth"" with Cate Blanchett.  Although loved by many, Kapur's ""Elizabeth"" is widely regarded as historical garbage and detested by most Tudor enthusiasts.",3,Admirable presentation when compared to most,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,2109,"['Tudor', 'enthusiasts', 'such', 'will', 'obviously', 'make', 'comparisons', 'series', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Elizabeth', 'portrayals', 'being', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', '1970', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'mini-series', 'Elizabeth', 'R', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Duff', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'think', 'made', 'more', 'subdued', 'Elizabeth', 'especially', 'part', 'mini-series', 'Elizabeth', 'R', 'also', 'much', 'longer', 'mini-series', '9', 'hours', 'more', 'deeply', 'historical', 'occurrences.I', 'was', 'constantly', 'distracted', 'Duff', 'middle-class', 'English', 'accent', 'am', 'purist', 'just', 'call', 'stuffy', 'Fortunately', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'notice', 'especially', 'United', 'States', 'One', 'favorable', 'factor', 'Duff', 'happen', 'think', 'Elizabeth', 'more', 'other', 'actress', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'Queen', 'look', 'famous', 'unfinished', 'miniature', 'Elizabeth', 'Isaac', 'Oliver', 'portrait', 'experts', 'regard', 'very', 'authentic', 'likeness', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Duff', 'dead-on', 'resemblance', 'probably', 'major', 'factor', 'obtaining', 'part', '.As', 'acting', 'much', 'language', 'been', 'modernized', 'not', 'true', 'authentic', 'speeches', 'quotes', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'R', 'more', 'authentic', 'regard', 'costumes', 'sets', 'were', 'probably', 'major', 'stars', 'film', 'did', 'admire', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'throw', 'bed', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'Elizabeth', 'great', 'love', 'do', 'most', 'portrayals', 'Also', 'most', 'speculative', 'occurrences', 'how', 'Amy', 'Robsart', 'died', 'suicide', 'accident', 'murder', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scott', 'coded', 'letters', 'treason', 'are', 'given', 'artistic', 'license', 'script', 'writers', 'freely', 'provide', 'own', 'version', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'ignoring', 'historical', 'fact.In', 'conclusion', 'think', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'showing', 'Queen', 'be', 'strong', 'brave', 'woman', 'devoted', 'Kingdom', 'people', 'undoubtedly', 'was', 'admirable', 'presentation', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'authentic', 'portrayal', 'Shekkar', 'Kapur', 'disaster', 'Elizabeth', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'loved', 'many', 'Kapur', 'Elizabeth', 'widely', 'regarded', 'historical', 'garbage', 'detested', 'most', 'Tudor', 'enthusiasts']",Masterpiece Theatre: Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen

This Elizabeth is intelligent, cunning, and charismatic, but also vain, love-struck, and petulant. Paula Milne wrote an exceptional screenplay for this production.As a young woman who is basically held as a prisoner by her sister, Queen Mary, she is well aware of the court intrigues that she must navigate or risk death. She must pretend that she is loyal to her sister and that she embraces her views that Catholicism should be the one religion for England. But in her heart is still a protestant, but sees that religious freedom for her people is more important than punishment. She is also a young woman with desires and a lust for living.  Her love of Robert Dudley, a childhood friend, seems almost obsessive, but the scene of them riding together on the horse after she's ascended the throne is one of a carefree, laughing young Elizabeth -- you feel her joy and love.As queen, you realize she is her father's daughter because this Elizabeth is a strong leader and brooks no challenge to her authority and lets them know she is a woman, but a determined and extremely capable ruler and politician. It is her weakness as a woman craving love from Robert Dudley and then Robert Devereaux that makes her more vulnerable. She cares for her people in war and shows her willingness to be amongst them, and that makes her popular with her people. She is first and foremost a queen.At the end of her life you feel as if you have really seen a truly great queen, but you also are left wondering could her life have been different as you remember the young, laughing Elizabeth and see the ravaged body and mind of Elizabeth on her deathbed.Anne-Marie Duff was the perfect actress for this version of Elizabeth I. Her Elizabeth is complex and you find yourself awed by her intelligence and strength, but frustrated by her emotional neediness. The entire cast brought a realism to their parts that made it easy to become involved. The production design was wonderful. And Coky Giedroyc direction was fantastic -- his choices were perfect.I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed the music. Martin Phipps has turned your expectations on your ear as he combines what feels like music from that time, but then turns our expectations around as he uses Latin lyrics in &#34;Miseria Nomine&#34; as Elizabeth eyes Robert Dudley, uses the poetry of Elizabeth I in &#34;The Virgin Queen&#34; to show her musings, or some songs in Bulgarian, &#34;Remember Me&#34; when Elizabeth is fading. The Mediaeval Baebes provide some truly wonderful vocals that underscore the beauty of the music and the feeling that this story of Elizabeth is more contemporary than not.I have seen it several times and I highly recommend it.",5,Elizabeth I As A Flesh and Blood Woman and Music That Tells The Story Well,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,2846,"['telling', 'life', 'Elizabeth', 'young', 'woman', 'end', 'reign', 'death', 'one', 'most', 'vibrant', 'versions', 'have', 'seen', 'Elizabeth', 'intelligent', 'cunning', 'charismatic', 'also', 'vain', 'love-struck', 'petulant', 'Paula', 'Milne', 'wrote', 'exceptional', 'screenplay', 'production.As', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'basically', 'held', 'prisoner', 'sister', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'well', 'aware', 'court', 'must', 'navigate', 'risk', 'death', 'must', 'pretend', 'loyal', 'sister', 'views', 'Catholicism', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'religion', 'England', 'heart', 'still', 'protestant', 'religious', 'freedom', 'people', 'more', 'important', 'punishment', 'also', 'young', 'woman', 'desires', 'lust', 'living', 'love', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'childhood', 'friend', 'almost', 'obsessive', 'scene', 'riding', 'together', 'horse', 'ascended', 'throne', 'one', 'carefree', 'laughing', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'feel', 'joy', 'love.As', 'queen', 'realize', 'father', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth', 'strong', 'leader', 'challenge', 'authority', 'know', 'woman', 'determined', 'extremely', 'capable', 'ruler', 'politician', 'weakness', 'woman', 'craving', 'love', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'then', 'Robert', 'Devereaux', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'people', 'war', 'willingness', 'be', 'amongst', 'popular', 'people', 'first', 'foremost', 'queen.At', 'end', 'life', 'feel', 'have', 'really', 'seen', 'truly', 'great', 'queen', 'also', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'could', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'remember', 'young', 'laughing', 'Elizabeth', 'see', 'ravaged', 'body', 'mind', 'Elizabeth', 'deathbed.Anne-Marie', 'Duff', 'was', 'perfect', 'actress', 'version', 'Elizabeth', 'Elizabeth', 'complex', 'find', 'awed', 'intelligence', 'strength', 'frustrated', 'emotional', 'neediness', 'entire', 'cast', 'brought', 'realism', 'parts', 'made', 'easy', 'become', 'involved', 'production', 'design', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Coky', 'Giedroyc', 'direction', 'was', 'fantastic', 'choices', 'were', 'perfect.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'Martin', 'Phipps', 'turned', 'expectations', 'ear', 'what', 'music', 'time', 'then', 'expectations', 'Latin', 'lyrics', '34', 'Miseria', 'Nomine', '34', 'Elizabeth', 'eyes', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'poetry', 'Elizabeth', '34', 'Virgin', 'Queen', '34', 'show', 'musings', 'songs', 'Bulgarian', '34', 'Remember', 'Me', '34', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'fading', 'Mediaeval', 'Baebes', 'provide', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'vocals', 'underscore', 'beauty', 'music', 'feeling', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'more', 'contemporary', 'not.I', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'highly', 'recommend']",Masterpiece Theatre: Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen
