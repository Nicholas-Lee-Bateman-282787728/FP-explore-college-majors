True, the story is loose with the facts on the relationship between Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart.  Mickey Rooney as Larry Hart is more Rooney than he is Hart in the character he plays.  However, there is an all-star cast in this movie and it is worth watching.  I do admit there were some songs that dragged along for me, but I have several favorites in the movie such as The Lady Is A Tramp, With A Song In My Heart, Blue Moon, Slaughter on Tenth Avenue, and my all-time favorite song entitled Manhattan.  Larry Hart as a lyricist is first rate as his lyrics to Manhattan illustrate.  In addition to the movie there is a commentary by historian Richard Barrios with others discussing the real relationship between Rogers and Hart.  Hart's erratic behavior could make him a difficult partner to work with, and Rogers eventually partnered up with Oscar Hammerstein.  Rogers and Hart formed a winning combination while it lasted and the songs they teamed up on are a lasting legacy.

It was a completely sanitized version of Lorenz Hart's life which was more akin to THE RAZOR'S EDGE than this fluffy confection.  That said, it's all about the music and there's a treasure trove here to enjoy.Judy Garland's turn as herself is terrific.  Yes, she would have been herself at her WIZARD OF OZ age at a Hollywood party when Rodgers & Hart would have been there holding court, but let's not let the truth get in the way here.  Judy was sick and dangerously thin and owed MGM a film appearance, when they dragged her out of bed to do one number (I can't remember which one she did first -- I think it was the duet with Mickey) and then, several weeks later, MGM execs were ecstatic with the results and brought her back for an encore.  She needed the money and they paid her $50,000 for each song.  She'd gained about 10-20 pounds in the interim and if you look closely, you can see that they costume department had to make changes in the dress she wore in order to accommodate the extra (much needed) weight.  (The two numbers are in the film, played back to back, so it's as if she did both songs at one party...so there would be no reason for ANY continuity problems but for the fact that they shot the material several weeks apart.)Her appearance in this film offered up her final MGM pairing with Mickey Rooney (their first in Technicolor); they wouldn't work together again until the summer of 1963 when he guest-starred on the first episode of THE JUDY GARLAND SHOW for CBS.  They were terrific and their perf of I WISH I WERE IN LOVE AGAIN was top notch.  One other bit of trivia -- that song was in the original score of BABES IN ARMS, but when MGM made that film in 1939, they decided that Mickey and Judy were too young to perform it at the time.  So, in 1948, song-justice was served when they got to do it together on screen.Anyway, that alone is worth the price of admission...but Lena Horne's turn along with a bevy of other MGM stars makes for solid first rate fare.",4,The music makes it all worthwhile,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,2106,"['Everything', 'say', 'hokey', 'quality', 'movie', 'how', 'whitewashed', 'was', 'big', 'screen', 'true', 'was', 'completely', 'sanitized', 'version', 'Lorenz', 'Hart', 'life', 'was', 'more', 'akin', 'RAZOR', 'EDGE', 'fluffy', 'confection', 'said', 'music', 'treasure', 'trove', 'here', 'enjoy.Judy', 'Garland', 'turn', 'herself', 'terrific', 'Yes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'age', 'Hollywood', 'party', 'when', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'holding', 'court', 'let', 'not', 'let', 'truth', 'get', 'way', 'here', 'Judy', 'was', 'sick', 'dangerously', 'thin', 'owed', 'MGM', 'film', 'appearance', 'when', 'dragged', 'bed', 'do', 'one', 'number', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'one', 'did', 'first', 'think', 'was', 'duet', 'Mickey', 'then', 'several', 'weeks', 'later', 'MGM', 'execs', 'were', 'ecstatic', 'results', 'brought', 'back', 'encore', 'needed', 'money', 'paid', '50,000', 'song', ""'d"", 'gained', '10-20', 'pounds', 'interim', 'look', 'closely', 'can', 'see', 'costume', 'department', 'had', 'make', 'changes', 'dress', 'wore', 'order', 'accommodate', 'extra', 'much', 'needed', 'weight', 'two', 'numbers', 'are', 'film', 'played', 'back', 'back', 'did', 'songs', 'one', 'party', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'reason', 'ANY', 'continuity', 'problems', 'fact', 'shot', 'material', 'several', 'weeks', 'apart', 'appearance', 'film', 'offered', 'up', 'final', 'MGM', 'pairing', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'first', 'Technicolor', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'together', 'again', 'summer', '1963', 'when', 'guest-starred', 'first', 'episode', 'THE', 'JUDY', 'GARLAND', 'SHOW', 'CBS', 'were', 'terrific', 'perf', 'WISH', 'WERE', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'AGAIN', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'One', 'other', 'bit', 'trivia', 'song', 'was', 'original', 'score', 'BABES', 'IN', 'ARMS', 'when', 'MGM', 'made', 'film', '1939', 'decided', 'Mickey', 'Judy', 'were', 'too', 'young', 'perform', 'time', 'So', '1948', 'song-justice', 'was', 'served', 'when', 'got', 'do', 'together', 'screen.Anyway', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'turn', 'bevy', 'other', 'MGM', 'stars', 'solid', 'first', 'rate', 'fare']",N/A

Its book is no more proper than the one concocted for Jerome Kern in TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY. But there are isolated gems: Judy Garland playing grown-up with Mickey Rooney for the first time in their last screen appearance with the sarcastic duet ""I Wish I Were In Love Again,"" as well as the ""Slaughter On Tenth Avenue"" dance and the massive ballet of ""On Your Toes""/""This Can't Be Love."" Some productions border on corny, like Perry Como's ""Mountain Greenery"" or the perenially perky June Allyson singing ""Thou Swell,"" but the wit and charm behind the songs is timeless. This is one of those film enigmas of which you just accept the premise (it never could decide what period of time it's supposed to be set in) and let it wash over you.

There are some good numbers and some great dancing.  My favourite was always June Allyson singing and dancing `Thou Swell` with the Blackburn Twins.  Her husky voice and boundless energy made her a great favourite in the forties and fifties.Now I realise that the real masterpiece to come out of this film was `Slaughter on Tenth Avenue` with Gene Kelly and Vera-Ellen.  The choreography for this number was the start of the many dances that Gene Kelly designed for the screen, and it was stunning.  Some of the best work that he ever did and of course the music was inspiring.  Vera-Ellen was also a wonderful dancer.  It was a tragedy that her career was cut short by health and family problems.  I wonder why this number was not in any of the MGM compilation films that were released in the `That`s Entertainment` films of the seventies.A continuity mistake.

However, the studio never made any great claims that they were trying to make a gritty and fact-filled biography; ""Words and Music"" and ""Till the Clouds Roll By"" were nothing but excuses to link a number of top-notch musical numbers together with a pleasing plotline to string them together (compare to ""Ziegfeld Follies"" which didn't even bother with a plot and didn't fare as well). Just look at the roster of talent: Garland, June Allyson, Perry Como, Gene Kelly, Vera Ellen, and Lena Horne! Garland and Horne steal the show with 2 numbers apiece. The technicolor is eye-popping as are the dazzling costumes and choreography. ""Slaughter"" number by Kelly and Vera Ellen is a masterpiece, both for the choreography and the camera angles. Yes, Mickey Rooney is annoying in this role, but no different from any other movie he was in, and he doesn't really detract from the movie.

287929,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,630197851X,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[31, 35]","To describe the 1948 WORDS AND MUSIC as a ""whitewashed"" version of the famous song-writing team Rogers and Hart is a gross understatement. Lorenz Hart (1895-1943) was a homosexual in an era when such was flatly unacceptable; the pressures of the closet drove him into a wildly self-destructive alcoholism that ultimately killed him.  Richard Rogers (1902-1979)was Hart's polar opposite, a highly disciplined individual who had zero tolerance for Hart's extremes.  Their friendship and working relation was stormy, to say the least.Needless to say, there was no way on earth that 1940s Hollywood could approach these facts. What we get instead is the story of the brilliant but glitchy Hart (Mickey Rooney) who is disappointed in love by singer Peggy McNeil (Betty Garrett), never gets over it, and falls apart as Rogers (Tom Drake) and his wife Dorothy (Janet Leigh) look on in dismay.  It's pretty much a lot of pap, but fortunately for all concerned the movie gives us a lot of music along the way.Most of the music is the form of cameos by a wash of MGM's musical stars.  Perry Como has unexpected screen presence; Lena Horne, saddled with the excessive gesticulation and odd costumes typically inflicted upon her during her Hollywood years, still manages to give truly memorable performances of ""Where or When"" and ""The Lady Is A Tramp;"" June Allyson does a charming ""Thou Swell;"" Gene Kelly and Vera-Ellen offer a memorable version of the jazz ballet ""Slaughter on 10th Avenue.""  Other notables include Anne Southern, Cyd Charisse, and Mel Torme.The big noise among the cameos is Judy Garland, who was battling MGM over withheld salary at the time and finally agreed to do two numbers to even out what the studio said she owed them.  The result would be the final pairing of Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney in a motion picture, the two performing a charming duet of ""I Wish I Were In Love Again,"" with Rooney clearly trying to break Garland up--and often succeeding.  It's tremendous fun and followed by Garland's hard-belting and equally enjoyable ""Johnny One Note.""Cameos aside, the primary cast is quite good with Rooney a stand out as Hart; one wonders at what performance he might have given if the script had been a no-holds-barred account.  Granted, WORDS AND MUSIC is the sort film you watch for the musical moments rather than the plot--but when all is said and done it does what it does extremely well.

287937,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,630197851X,octobercountry,"[0, 0]","I've just watched ""Words and Music"" again---haven't seen it for quite a few years.  Here we have Rooney playing Hart in his typical frenetic, over-the-top style, balanced out by the very cute but unfortunately very bland Drake as Rodgers. A true biography of the songwriting team Rodgers and Hart could have been quite interesting---but any connection this film has to reality is purely coincidental. Matter of fact, this film departs so very far from reality that it practically exists in some kind of bizarro parallel universe.The most obvious change is the de-gaying of Hart and the invention of a fictitious female love interest for him (and it's kind of ironic that the script has the real-life straight actor playing the gay guy, and the real-life gay actor playing the straight guy).But, there's so very much wrong with the plot of this film that it's difficult to know where to begin, and rather pointless to note all the deviations from fact. So many of the filmmaker's decisions here are just plain odd---like the fact that there's not even the slightest attempt to place the story into a realistic visual chronology. The entire thing looks like it's been shot in the late forties, with no attempt whatsoever to depict the hair/makeup/clothing styles of earlier decades in the parts of the story set in the teens/twenties/thirties.Another example of how bizarre this picture is, is the decision to have Perry Como play both a character in the Rodgers and Hart story----and then play himself during the latter portion of the same film. Um, that just doesn't make any sense!(After watching this movie I can see why Como never became a star in motion pictures. Oh, no doubt he's leading-man handsome, and he has an absolutely fantastic voice. But sadly enough he also has zero screen presence, no natural chemistry whatsoever---it's like watching a blank slate, to see him moving about on-screen. But man---what a voice...)So, why bother to watch the film? For all the musical sequences of course; production numbers are dropped into the picture quite independent of the whisper-thin plot. I love the classic American songbook type of pop music, and this film contains a number of fantastic tunes performed very well indeed, by true talents. Lena Horne's work stands out in particular for me, and June Allyson's extended number from ""A Connecticut Yankee"" is fun too. And there are a couple of first-rate dancing sequences as well; MGM placed some of their best performers in this film for the musical bits, and they're pretty amazing.Plus, I have to say that these old three-strip Technicolor films are absolutely gorgeous; a real pleasure to the eye.So, anyone who enjoys old musicals---by all means, give it a go!(There are a number of goofs on display here for eagle-eyed viewers, including the fact that Judy Garland is actually wearing two different dresses during the party scene--- minor variations in the styling give it away. She had experienced a substantial weight change in the weeks that separated the shooting of her two musical numbers, and so had to have another dress made, even though her scenes are all supposed to take place during the same evening.)",4,"Laughable plot, fantastic music",1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,3178,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'watched', 'Words', 'Music', 'again', '-have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'Here', 'have', 'Rooney', 'playing', 'Hart', 'typical', 'frenetic', 'over-the-top', 'style', 'balanced', 'out', 'very', 'cute', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'bland', 'Drake', 'Rodgers', 'A', 'true', 'biography', 'songwriting', 'team', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'interesting', '-but', 'connection', 'film', 'reality', 'purely', 'coincidental', 'Matter', 'fact', 'film', 'so', 'very', 'far', 'reality', 'practically', 'kind', 'bizarro', 'parallel', 'universe.The', 'most', 'obvious', 'change', 'de-gaying', 'Hart', 'invention', 'fictitious', 'female', 'love', 'interest', 'kind', 'ironic', 'script', 'real-life', 'straight', 'actor', 'playing', 'gay', 'guy', 'real-life', 'gay', 'actor', 'playing', 'straight', 'guy', '.But', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'wrong', 'plot', 'film', 'difficult', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'rather', 'pointless', 'note', 'deviations', 'fact', 'So', 'many', 'filmmaker', 'decisions', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'odd', 'fact', 'not', 'even', 'slightest', 'attempt', 'place', 'story', 'realistic', 'visual', 'chronology', 'entire', 'thing', 'been', 'shot', 'late', 'forties', 'attempt', 'whatsoever', 'depict', 'hair/makeup/clothing', 'styles', 'earlier', 'decades', 'parts', 'story', 'set', 'teens/twenties/thirties.Another', 'example', 'how', 'bizarre', 'picture', 'decision', 'have', 'Perry', 'Como', 'play', 'character', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'story', 'then', 'play', 'latter', 'portion', 'same', 'film', 'Um', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Como', 'never', 'became', 'star', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Oh', 'doubt', 'leading-man', 'handsome', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'voice', 'sadly', 'enough', 'also', 'zero', 'screen', 'presence', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', '-it', 'watching', 'blank', 'slate', 'see', 'moving', 'on-screen', 'man', 'voice', 'So', 'why', 'bother', 'watch', 'film', 'musical', 'sequences', 'course', 'production', 'numbers', 'are', 'dropped', 'picture', 'quite', 'independent', 'whisper-thin', 'plot', 'love', 'classic', 'American', 'songbook', 'type', 'pop', 'music', 'film', 'number', 'fantastic', 'tunes', 'performed', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'true', 'talents', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'work', 'out', 'particular', 'June', 'Allyson', 'extended', 'number', 'A', 'Connecticut', 'Yankee', 'fun', 'too', 'are', 'couple', 'first-rate', 'dancing', 'sequences', 'as', 'well', 'MGM', 'placed', 'best', 'performers', 'film', 'musical', 'bits', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'amazing.Plus', 'have', 'say', 'old', 'three-strip', 'Technicolor', 'films', 'are', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'real', 'pleasure', 'eye.So', 'anyone', 'who', 'old', 'musicals', '-by', 'means', 'give', 'go', 'are', 'number', 'goofs', 'display', 'here', 'eagle-eyed', 'viewers', 'including', 'fact', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'actually', 'wearing', 'two', 'different', 'dresses', 'party', 'scene', 'minor', 'variations', 'styling', 'give', 'away', 'had', 'experienced', 'substantial', 'weight', 'change', 'weeks', 'separated', 'shooting', 'two', 'musical', 'numbers', 'so', 'had', 'have', 'dress', 'made', 'even', 'scenes', 'are', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'same', 'evening']",N/A
287938,A2X25C107CSLOR,630197851X,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[3, 18]","After being forced to withdraw from The Barkleys of Broadway planned with Easter Parade partner Fred Astaire because of ill health, Judy Garland rose from her sick bed where she was being fed intravenously to perform one number for this film. This anecdote is evidence of how valuable Judy Garland was to MGM and based on the other performances in this film, boy did they need her! Generally recognised as a sanitised biopic about composer Richard Rodgers and lyricist Lorenz Hart, whilst the narrative follows a basically truthfull trajectory of their musical career, their personal lives are another story. As in the Warner Bros Night and Day with Cary Grant as Cole Porter, any reference to homosexuality has been censored, though a comment about Hart being &quot;among strange people&quot; gets an informed laugh. Whilst Mickey Rooney's Hart erratic behaviour is rationalised by heterosexual unrequited love, Rooney tends to overdo the obsessive compulsive hand-wringing and cigar-smoking, and his final death march is an embarassment The death is expected since director Norman Taurog introduces the film with Drake narrating in somber tones. The only redemptive examination of the team's private lives is the wise casting of lovely Janet Leigh as the woman Tom Drake as Rodgers courts and marries. So with the plot a whitewash, we are left with the songs and those that present them. Which brings me back to Garland. Either a deliberate and inexplicable decision was made to cast performers with weak voices or a total lack of charisma, or these performers represent MGM's sad excuse for a talent pool at the time. We can probably forgive the voices of Rooney (though he is saved by Garland on the duet of I Wish I Were in Love Again) and Drake, but we can't forgive Betty Garrett's There's a Small Hotel, Ann Sothern's Where's That Rainbow, Cyd Charisse's On Your Toes, and June Allyson's Thou Swell. Garland doing Johnny One Note and her Rooney duet is proof of what a real entertainer can do, and even though Lena Horne's ravenous animation is too much for the camera, at least she is able to carry Where or When, and The Lady is a Tramp. Perry Como's Mountain Greenery and With a Song in my Heart and Mel Torme's Blue Moon both demonstrate why these singers didn't have film careers. Admittedly Cyd Charisse's On Your Toes is presented as a dance number, with gargantuan chorus that only draws attention to the effort made, and whilst Thou Swell almost works on this level, Slaughter on 10th Avenue is undermined by Vera-Ellen's laughable dancing opposite Gene Kelly. The musical sequences were staged by Robert Alton and even his Garland numbers can be faulted, with Johnny One Note having her in long shot and blocked moving around her audience, rather than enjoying her in medium shot. However Taurog's use of bad rear projection, and an abbreviated end of footage from Garbo's talkie Camille, here a silent, is unforgiveable. This mangling of a death scene prefigures Rooney's. The screenplay uses an idea of a show in rehearsal without the lyrics to songs being ready to score points against Hart, has Rodgers refer to Hart as a child which is particularly insulting considering the banal melody of With a Song in in my Heart which Rodgers fed Hart, and an unintentionally funny scene where Rooney is rejected by Garrett, he given lines like &quot;It always hurts when you find out you've been kidding yourself&quot;, and in response to her Where you going - &quot;Who knows. The thing is to go and go fast&quot;. Note that Lover, one of my favourite Rodgers and Hart tunes is only heard under the opening credits, though considering this cast, that may be an advantage.",2,Thou swell,996192000,"07 27, 2001",2001,3685,"['being', 'forced', 'withdraw', 'Barkleys', 'Broadway', 'planned', 'Easter', 'Parade', 'partner', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'ill', 'health', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'rose', 'sick', 'bed', 'where', 'was', 'being', 'fed', 'intravenously', 'perform', 'one', 'number', 'film', 'anecdote', 'evidence', 'how', 'valuable', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'was', 'MGM', 'based', 'other', 'performances', 'film', 'boy', 'did', 'need', 'Generally', 'recognised', 'sanitised', 'biopic', 'composer', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'lyricist', 'Lorenz', 'Hart', 'whilst', 'narrative', 'basically', 'truthfull', 'trajectory', 'musical', 'career', 'personal', 'lives', 'are', 'story', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Night', 'Day', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'reference', 'homosexuality', 'been', 'censored', 'comment', 'Hart', 'being', 'quot', 'strange', 'people', 'quot', 'informed', 'laugh', 'Whilst', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Hart', 'erratic', 'behaviour', 'rationalised', 'heterosexual', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Rooney', 'overdo', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'hand-wringing', 'cigar-smoking', 'final', 'death', 'march', 'embarassment', 'death', 'expected', 'director', 'Norman', 'Taurog', 'film', 'Drake', 'narrating', 'somber', 'tones', 'only', 'redemptive', 'examination', 'team', 'private', 'lives', 'wise', 'casting', 'lovely', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'woman', 'Tom', 'Drake', 'Rodgers', 'courts', 'marries', 'So', 'plot', 'whitewash', 'are', 'left', 'songs', 'present', 'Which', 'back', 'Garland', 'deliberate', 'inexplicable', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'cast', 'performers', 'weak', 'voices', 'total', 'lack', 'charisma', 'performers', 'represent', 'MGM', 'sad', 'excuse', 'talent', 'pool', 'time', 'can', 'probably', 'forgive', 'voices', 'Rooney', 'saved', 'Garland', 'duet', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Love', 'Again', 'Drake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'Betty', 'Garrett', 'Small', 'Hotel', 'Ann', 'Sothern', 'Where', 'Rainbow', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'Your', 'Toes', 'June', 'Allyson', 'Thou', 'Swell', 'Garland', 'doing', 'Johnny', 'One', 'Note', 'Rooney', 'duet', 'proof', 'what', 'real', 'entertainer', 'can', 'do', 'even', 'Lena', 'Horne', 'ravenous', 'animation', 'too', 'much', 'camera', 'least', 'able', 'carry', 'Where', 'When', 'Lady', 'Tramp', 'Perry', 'Como', 'Mountain', 'Greenery', 'Song', 'Heart', 'Mel', 'Torme', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'demonstrate', 'why', 'singers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'film', 'careers', 'Admittedly', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'Toes', 'presented', 'dance', 'number', 'gargantuan', 'chorus', 'only', 'attention', 'effort', 'made', 'whilst', 'Thou', 'Swell', 'almost', 'level', 'Slaughter', '10th', 'Avenue', 'undermined', 'Vera-Ellen', 'laughable', 'dancing', 'opposite', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'musical', 'sequences', 'were', 'staged', 'Robert', 'Alton', 'even', 'Garland', 'numbers', 'can', 'be', 'faulted', 'Johnny', 'One', 'Note', 'having', 'long', 'shot', 'blocked', 'moving', 'audience', 'rather', 'enjoying', 'medium', 'shot', 'However', 'Taurog', 'use', 'bad', 'rear', 'projection', 'abbreviated', 'end', 'footage', 'Garbo', 'talkie', 'Camille', 'here', 'silent', 'unforgiveable', 'mangling', 'death', 'scene', 'Rooney', 'screenplay', 'idea', 'show', 'rehearsal', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'being', 'ready', 'score', 'points', 'Hart', 'Rodgers', 'refer', 'Hart', 'child', 'particularly', 'insulting', 'considering', 'banal', 'melody', 'Song', 'Heart', 'Rodgers', 'fed', 'Hart', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'Rooney', 'rejected', 'Garrett', 'given', 'lines', 'quot', 'always', 'when', 'find', 'out', ""'ve"", 'been', 'kidding', 'quot', 'response', 'Where', 'going', 'quot', 'Who', 'thing', 'go', 'go', 'fast', 'quot', 'Note', 'Lover', 'one', 'favourite', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'tunes', 'only', 'heard', 'opening', 'credits', 'considering', 'cast', 'may', 'be', 'advantage']",N/A

The film begins when they meet and includes their struggles and triumphs until Hart's early death. The story isn't terribly important because the film is mostly composed of musical numbers.There are a few notable musical moments, like the wonderful ""Manhattan,"" Mickey and Judy's last teaming in ""I Wish I Were in Love Again"" and the energetic ""Where's That Rainbow?"" However, there are as many flops. Take for example the inclusion of an interpretive dance by Gene Kelly and Vera Ellen. The film celebrates the team of Rodgers and Hart, not just one or the other, and yet ""Slaughter on Tenth Avenue"" has no lyrics. The staging for the classic ""Blue Moon"" is strange too.Perhaps the most frustrating part about this movie is the way in which the credits are listed. The cameo appearances are listed with the stars of the film, and the credits are listed in alphabetical order. This is misleading to those who watch films for their favorite stars. The first billing goes to June Allyson who only has one fleeting moment on screen, ""Thou Swell."" Really, most of the stars listed only make small appearances like that. Only Rooney truly stars.This DVD edition features a short featurette about the real Rodgers and Hart which explains what was true in the film and what was left out.

This is classic Hollywood, a big M.G.M musical spectacle, so never let facts or your love of information get in the way of a good time. The bad news is that WORDS AND MUSIC is only partially a good time.That may be in part because the story of Larenz Hart is pretty tragic in the end, for a better understanding don't miss the twenty minute featurette on this DVD, but as played by Mickey Rooney he comes across as a jolly fellow hiding a deep sadness. Richard Rodgers on the other hand seems to have lived a charmed life to the point of boredom, not helped any by the dull performance here by Tom Drake, you wont wonder long why he never became a big movie star.The musical performances, the real draw here and in every musical, is a somewhat mixed bag, which coming from the so-called Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer dream factory and producer Arthur Freed is a rather disappointing surprise. The early numbers are so blah that it takes twenty minutes or so for the movie to feel even the remotest bit alive, let alone full of life as most musicals of the period from the producer did. However, when the numbers take a turn for the better, things really do get better.Highlights include Rooney and Judy Garland, in their last screen pairing, singing a lively song together, which is followed by a wonderful Judy solo of ""Johnny One Note."" The lovely Lena Horn belting out ""the Lady is a Tramp."" Mel Torme crooning ""Blue Moon."" And Gene Kelly's amazing dance sequence ""Murder on 10th Avenue"", alongside Vera-Ellen, is so beautifully choreographed by Kelly himself that it easily stands as the movie's highlight and is worth seeing the whole film for.
