But it's dull, should have been a short - it's at least twice as long as the ideas warrant, and some weird extra &#34;stuff&#34; with plants, and a little rough sex thrown in (extreme to my view, but marvelously done, barely any nudity [but don't watch with your kids]) so that maybe we'll believe this connection is important to someone.Really, I love many Asian movies, but I had to force myself thru this, and then wonder why.  The actress playing Naru is good in a hopeless part, the others irritatingly not.  The screenplay is all but awful, except that it's elaborated (drawn out?) from 3 ideas/sentences that are quite worthy.  Sorry, I won't add the spoiler, but don't waste your time looking.I can't say I hated it, but should one be irritated for 90 minutes in a pointless hope for art, or at least interest?

This one is another example of the complexities and creativity that I find so compelling.Jung-Ha's husband Jane is having a (consensually) often-violent affair with Naru.Jane is killed in an automobile collision caused when he and Naru are having sex in a car by the road. Naru is eventually summoned (supernaturally) to Jung-Ha's home, as a sort of penance, for the affair and Jane's death. Jane, as a ghost or apparition, also remains until Jung-Ha allows him to leave.The whole story is narrated as fiction, as an &#34;outer story&#34;, in which a man tells the story to a woman, the two apparently meant to be Jane and Jung-Ha respectively. By the end of the movie, it's not really clear to whom the story has really happened.Some may be frustrated by the ambiguity. Others may be looking for a movie with more prurient interest. Such viewers should pass on this movie, as there's much of the former and little of the latter. But for those who have enjoyed the creativity and fantasy, even sometimes troubling or disturbing, that is often found in Korean films, this film is worth a watch.",4,A ghost story true to the tradition of Korean cinema,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",2014,1292,"['subtle', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'occasionally', 'lost', 'not', 'being', 'Korean', 'sometimes', 'miss', 'important', 'cultural', 'dialogue', 'cues', 'still', 'have', 'found', 'enjoying', 'much', 'Korean', 'films', 'see', 'one', 'example', 'complexities', 'creativity', 'find', 'so', 'compelling.Jung-Ha', 'husband', 'Jane', 'having', 'consensually', 'often-violent', 'affair', 'Naru.Jane', 'killed', 'automobile', 'collision', 'caused', 'when', 'Naru', 'are', 'having', 'sex', 'car', 'road', 'Naru', 'eventually', 'summoned', 'supernaturally', 'Jung-Ha', 'home', 'sort', 'penance', 'affair', 'Jane', 'death', 'Jane', 'ghost', 'apparition', 'also', 'Jung-Ha', 'leave.The', 'whole', 'story', 'narrated', 'fiction', '34', 'outer', 'story', '34', 'man', 'story', 'woman', 'two', 'apparently', 'meant', 'be', 'Jane', 'Jung-Ha', 'respectively', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'clear', 'whom', 'story', 'really', 'happened.Some', 'may', 'be', 'frustrated', 'ambiguity', 'Others', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'movie', 'more', 'prurient', 'interest', 'Such', 'viewers', 'should', 'pass', 'movie', 'much', 'former', 'little', 'latter', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'creativity', 'fantasy', 'even', 'sometimes', 'troubling', 'disturbing', 'often', 'found', 'Korean', 'films', 'film', 'watch']",In My End Is My Beginning

He seems an unwilling drinker as she nags hims to drink and resorts to stripping one garment for each glass of wine he drinks.The story he's telling is about an extreme sexual relationship between a man and woman that includes a lot of S&M; as well as high risk encounters (think sex in a moving car).At some point you realize the author is telling his own story of infidelity to his wife. That he is in fact dead from the sex in the car incident. That his mistress is not dead but is severely hurt.It is difficult to tell what is past versus present. For example, you see the damaged mistress at the site of the crash but then she moves in with the dead husband and the wife and she, the mistress, is undamaged.The wife torments the mistress because she is so angry with her. For her part, the mistress is apologetic and tries to make up to the widowed wife by being extremely subservient and by helpful.You realize that the wife is grieving and the dead husband and mistress are hallucinations that she is interacting with to help her come to a resolution.Near the end of the movie, she has a revealing epiphany that helps her move on and forgive.The sex is pretty extreme and violent at times, which makes the wife's epiphany all the more interesting.",5,Interesting movie (slight lesbian theme),1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1369,"['first', 'movie', 'be', 'man', 'telling', 'story', 'writing', 'woman', 'who', 'plying', 'drinks', 'unwilling', 'drinker', 'hims', 'drink', 'resorts', 'stripping', 'one', 'garment', 'glass', 'wine', 'story', 'telling', 'extreme', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'man', 'woman', 'lot', 'S', 'M', 'as', 'well', 'high', 'risk', 'encounters', 'think', 'sex', 'moving', 'car', '.At', 'point', 'realize', 'author', 'telling', 'own', 'story', 'infidelity', 'wife', 'fact', 'dead', 'sex', 'car', 'incident', 'mistress', 'not', 'dead', 'severely', 'hurt.It', 'difficult', 'tell', 'what', 'past', 'versus', 'present', 'example', 'see', 'damaged', 'mistress', 'site', 'crash', 'then', 'dead', 'husband', 'wife', 'mistress', 'undamaged.The', 'wife', 'mistress', 'so', 'angry', 'part', 'mistress', 'apologetic', 'tries', 'make', 'up', 'widowed', 'wife', 'being', 'extremely', 'subservient', 'helpful.You', 'realize', 'wife', 'grieving', 'dead', 'husband', 'mistress', 'are', 'hallucinations', 'interacting', 'help', 'come', 'resolution.Near', 'end', 'movie', 'revealing', 'epiphany', 'move', 'forgive.The', 'sex', 'pretty', 'extreme', 'violent', 'times', 'wife', 'epiphany', 'more', 'interesting']",In My End Is My Beginning
