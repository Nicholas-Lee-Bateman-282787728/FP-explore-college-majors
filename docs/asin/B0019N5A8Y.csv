At nine years old, your father marries you off to a man four times as old as you.You are only 4 1/2 feet tall.At age fourteen, you go into labor with your first child.  Hours turn into days, then into a week.  The baby is ramming against your tiny lower pelvis, trapping your flesh between its head and your bones.  Cut off from its blood supply, that tissue  begins to die.  Days later, an obstructed birth has killed your child, and you have entered the hell that is an untreated obstetric fistula--a birth injury that leaves you unable to control your bladder, bowels, or both.Your husband rejects you.  Your parents don't want to see your face.  Welcome to the death-in-life that is your existence.  You've joined a sisterhood of hundereds of thousands in Ethiopia alone, and yet you think you are a sorority of one.In a wealthy country, the operation that corrects a fistula is routine (a dear friend of mine had it done in an hour under a spinal block).  In Africa and the Muslim world, you are hopelessly cut off from a gentle hand and help.  Shame is your only friend.  This documentary tells the quiet, humble stories of several such afflicted women--really, little girls---who find help at a special hospital in Addis Ababa.We just don't have a CLUE how hard life is for women in most of the world.  This small, quiet film gives us just a glimpse, but what a glimpse it is.  ""You don't have to be a woman to understand a woman's problems"" says the surgeon who does thirty operations a week.  And you don't have to be poor to imagine the implications for a society that shames girls after forcing them to work and marry far too young.  This documentary will make you furious at the blind stupidity of it all, and it will also lift your heart up clear to the sky, all in only an hour. But for an accident of birth, these women's stories could be ours.  For the sake of these sweet children of God, watch this documentary.",5,"The beauty of gratitude, the grace of kindness",1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,2068,"['are', 'poor', 'girl', 'Ethiopian', 'countryside', 'body', 'stunted', 'slight', 'too', 'much', 'physical', 'labor', 'done', 'too', 'young', 'age', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'father', 'marries', 'off', 'man', 'four', 'times', 'as', 'old', 'you.You', 'are', 'only', '4', '1/2', 'feet', 'tall.At', 'age', 'fourteen', 'go', 'labor', 'first', 'child', 'Hours', 'turn', 'days', 'then', 'week', 'baby', 'ramming', 'tiny', 'lower', 'pelvis', 'trapping', 'flesh', 'head', 'bones', 'Cut', 'off', 'blood', 'supply', 'tissue', 'die', 'Days', 'later', 'obstructed', 'birth', 'killed', 'child', 'have', 'entered', 'hell', 'untreated', 'obstetric', 'fistula', 'birth', 'injury', 'unable', 'control', 'bladder', 'bowels', 'husband', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'face', 'Welcome', 'death-in-life', 'existence', ""'ve"", 'joined', 'sisterhood', 'hundereds', 'thousands', 'Ethiopia', 'alone', 'yet', 'think', 'are', 'sorority', 'one.In', 'wealthy', 'country', 'operation', 'fistula', 'routine', 'dear', 'friend', 'mine', 'had', 'done', 'hour', 'spinal', 'block', 'Africa', 'Muslim', 'world', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'cut', 'off', 'gentle', 'hand', 'help', 'Shame', 'only', 'friend', 'documentary', 'quiet', 'humble', 'stories', 'several', 'such', 'afflicted', 'women', 'really', 'little', 'girls', '-who', 'find', 'help', 'special', 'hospital', 'Addis', 'Ababa.We', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'CLUE', 'how', 'hard', 'life', 'women', 'most', 'world', 'small', 'quiet', 'film', 'just', 'glimpse', 'what', 'glimpse', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'woman', 'understand', 'woman', 'problems', 'surgeon', 'who', 'thirty', 'operations', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'poor', 'imagine', 'implications', 'society', 'girls', 'forcing', 'work', 'marry', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'documentary', 'will', 'make', 'furious', 'blind', 'stupidity', 'will', 'also', 'lift', 'heart', 'up', 'clear', 'sky', 'only', 'hour', 'accident', 'birth', 'women', 'stories', 'could', 'be', 'ours', 'sake', 'sweet', 'children', 'God', 'watch', 'documentary']",A Walk To Beautiful - NOVA
1164436,A19K46GITRI5Y2,B0019N5A8Y,Joyce,"[0, 0]","This one-hour NOVA documentary of five Ethiopian women who suffer from fistula will break your heart.  I was still weeping when I woke the morning after.  Two to three million women worldwide experience this traumatic aftermath  of birthing.  You probably don&#8217;t know what fistula is.  I had heard of it but was unclear about the details.  Because girls in impoverished countries are engaged in intensive hard work from a very early age, their growth is stunted.  Add to this marriage at an early age (13 and younger), and what results is an inability to deliver a baby.  Labor may last as long as 10 days with usually a stillborn baby somehow wrenched from the girl.  This often leaves a hole between the vagina and bladder and in some cases the rectum.  The victims are incontinent, leaking urine and sometimes feces.  Adding insult to injury, they are abandoned and rejected by their husbands and families, banished to live alone in shacks, waiting to die.The good news:  there is a Fistula Foundation.  The film shows their hospital in Addis Ababa where women who can make their way there are treated surgically and given kindness and education about their situation.  The courage of the women to get there and the devotion and fine work of the doctors are heart-warming, but the film leaves you wanting some way to address the underlying and ongoing causes of this outrage.",5,heartbreaking,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,1383,"['one-hour', 'NOVA', 'documentary', 'five', 'Ethiopian', 'women', 'who', 'suffer', 'fistula', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'was', 'still', 'weeping', 'when', 'woke', 'morning', 'Two', 'three', 'million', 'women', 'worldwide', 'experience', 'traumatic', 'aftermath', 'birthing', 'probably', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'what', 'fistula', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'unclear', 'details', 'girls', 'impoverished', 'countries', 'are', 'engaged', 'intensive', 'hard', 'work', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'growth', 'stunted', 'Add', 'marriage', 'early', 'age', '13', 'younger', 'what', 'results', 'inability', 'deliver', 'baby', 'Labor', 'may', 'last', 'as', 'long', '10', 'days', 'usually', 'stillborn', 'baby', 'somehow', 'wrenched', 'girl', 'often', 'hole', 'vagina', 'bladder', 'cases', 'rectum', 'victims', 'are', 'incontinent', 'leaking', 'urine', 'sometimes', 'feces', 'Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'are', 'abandoned', 'rejected', 'husbands', 'families', 'banished', 'live', 'alone', 'shacks', 'waiting', 'die.The', 'good', 'news', 'Fistula', 'Foundation', 'film', 'hospital', 'Addis', 'Ababa', 'where', 'women', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'way', 'are', 'treated', 'surgically', 'given', 'kindness', 'education', 'situation', 'courage', 'women', 'get', 'there', 'devotion', 'fine', 'work', 'doctors', 'are', 'heart-warming', 'film', 'wanting', 'way', 'address', 'underlying', 'ongoing', 'causes', 'outrage']",A Walk To Beautiful - NOVA
1164437,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0019N5A8Y,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 5]","This is a tough review for me to write. After watching this, I am so moved that I'm not sure what to write in this review. This film is an incredibly powerful, emotional experience and it educated me about a serious health issue I never knew existed. I can't begin to express just how badly I felt for women afflicted with obstetric fistula, a type of childbirth injury that, according to the people interviewed in this film, occurs most often in poor, rural areas of developing countries in Africa, Asia and the Arab world. I watched with anticipation and genuine anxiety the trials of five women in this documentary; they all had to endure obstetric fistula for years and they became outcasts in their communities because the members of their communities were disgusted by the smells and the symptoms of fistula. Women with fistula are unable their urges to go to the bathroom. To make matters worse for these women, they honestly didn't realize there were other women like them and they thought there was nowhere to go for treatment. They often heard of a hospital merely by luck when word-of-mouth reached them in their area hundreds of miles away from the only hospital helping women with fistula. This documentary, however, highlights the very real possibility of a woman's being cured of fistula using surgical methods to correct the problem; and to see the joyful expressions on their faces and the lovely clothes they were given when they were leaving the hospital to start their new lives after they were cured was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.This documentary focuses on five Ethiopian women who have traveled from remote, rural areas to the capital city of Addis Ababa where they find relief, kindness and surgeons ready to assist them and correct the problem that has caused their lives to be a living hell for years. These women, like others in certain parts of the world, have spent the last several years of their lives being treated as lepers in their own communities because people were repulsed by the way these women smelled; they could not control their urges to go to the bathroom.I don't want to spoil it all for you; but I will tell you one story out of the five the documentary focuses on. One young woman, Wubete, has to travel three times to the hospital from her rural village because her bladder was so severely damaged during childbirth that she is left with an unusually small bladder. In Wubete's case, physical exercises to achieve bladder control were not working well. She is so happy when she is finally able to control her bathroom urges that she wishes to stay at the hospital perhaps as an employee; the hospital doesn't hire her but they do find her a job working at an orphanage and Wubete looks happier than ever. It practically made me cry tears of joy. The other four stories are equally poignant and quite memorable; and the staff was the kindest you could ever imagine.The DVD comes with an extra about the extent of obstetric fistula; it is brief but very well done and informative. There are a few other extras but this is the most valuable one.Overall, A Walk to Beautiful is an important documentary that practically everyone should see once they are able to handle the mature subject matter involved here. Before I saw this movie I had never even heard of fistula. I learned an awful lot from watching this film; and I highly recommend this DVD.",5,"for these women, a new world of hope is dawning",1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,3415,"['tough', 'review', 'write', 'watching', 'am', 'so', 'moved', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'write', 'review', 'film', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'experience', 'educated', 'serious', 'health', 'issue', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'express', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'felt', 'women', 'afflicted', 'obstetric', 'fistula', 'type', 'childbirth', 'injury', 'according', 'people', 'interviewed', 'film', 'most', 'often', 'poor', 'rural', 'areas', 'developing', 'countries', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'Arab', 'world', 'watched', 'anticipation', 'genuine', 'anxiety', 'trials', 'five', 'women', 'documentary', 'had', 'endure', 'obstetric', 'fistula', 'years', 'became', 'outcasts', 'communities', 'members', 'communities', 'were', 'disgusted', 'smells', 'symptoms', 'fistula', 'Women', 'fistula', 'are', 'unable', 'urges', 'go', 'bathroom', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'women', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'were', 'other', 'women', 'thought', 'was', 'nowhere', 'go', 'treatment', 'often', 'heard', 'hospital', 'merely', 'luck', 'when', 'word-of-mouth', 'reached', 'area', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'away', 'only', 'hospital', 'helping', 'women', 'fistula', 'documentary', 'however', 'very', 'real', 'possibility', 'woman', 'being', 'cured', 'fistula', 'using', 'surgical', 'methods', 'correct', 'problem', 'see', 'joyful', 'expressions', 'lovely', 'clothes', 'were', 'given', 'when', 'were', 'leaving', 'hospital', 'start', 'new', 'lives', 'were', 'cured', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.This', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'five', 'Ethiopian', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'traveled', 'remote', 'rural', 'areas', 'capital', 'city', 'Addis', 'Ababa', 'where', 'find', 'relief', 'kindness', 'surgeons', 'ready', 'assist', 'correct', 'problem', 'caused', 'lives', 'be', 'living', 'hell', 'years', 'women', 'others', 'certain', 'parts', 'world', 'have', 'spent', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'lives', 'being', 'treated', 'lepers', 'own', 'communities', 'people', 'were', 'repulsed', 'way', 'women', 'smelled', 'could', 'not', 'control', 'urges', 'go', 'bathroom.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'will', 'tell', 'one', 'story', 'five', 'documentary', 'One', 'young', 'woman', 'Wubete', 'travel', 'three', 'times', 'hospital', 'rural', 'village', 'bladder', 'was', 'so', 'severely', 'damaged', 'childbirth', 'left', 'unusually', 'small', 'bladder', 'Wubete', 'case', 'physical', 'exercises', 'achieve', 'bladder', 'control', 'were', 'not', 'working', 'well', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'finally', 'able', 'control', 'bathroom', 'stay', 'hospital', 'perhaps', 'employee', 'hospital', ""n't"", 'hire', 'do', 'find', 'job', 'working', 'orphanage', 'Wubete', 'happier', 'ever', 'practically', 'made', 'cry', 'tears', 'joy', 'other', 'four', 'stories', 'are', 'equally', 'poignant', 'quite', 'memorable', 'staff', 'was', 'kindest', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine.The', 'DVD', 'extra', 'extent', 'obstetric', 'fistula', 'brief', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'informative', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'extras', 'most', 'valuable', 'one.Overall', 'Walk', 'Beautiful', 'important', 'documentary', 'practically', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'are', 'able', 'handle', 'mature', 'subject', 'matter', 'involved', 'here', 'saw', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'fistula', 'learned', 'awful', 'lot', 'watching', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",A Walk To Beautiful - NOVA
