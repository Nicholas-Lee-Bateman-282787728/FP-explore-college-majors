In actuality, it shows how ""Enabled"" they can be. How would I know? Because in real life I am the Jack character. What I really like is the portrayal of the 4 housemates. They weren't over the top like Sean Penn in I am Sam. These were the people I work and care for everyday. Their actions, their speech, their fears, their dreams were about as realistic as it gets. I too have been in Jack's place with someone telling me you'll never get rich doing this. Get another job. I don't do it to get rich, I do it to help and love the one's who need it most.

405296,A1C80B497LCYKA,6304173377,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[17, 17]","This is a made-for-television, Hallmark Hall of Fame film that is small in scale but big in heart. A true ensemble piece, every actor turns in a first-rate performance: Nathan Lane (The Bird Cage, Mouse Hunt), Michael Jeter, Robert Sean Leonard (Much Ado About Nothing), and Courtney B. Vance as mentally-challenged men living in a group home together; with Tony Goldwyn (Joshua, Tarzan, Last Tattoo) as the social worker who holds it all together. Also featured is Mare Winningham as Nathan's character's girlfriend. Funny, touching and unforgettable, it gives you insight into the lives of people whose challenges may be more obvious than our own; but who, nonetheless, possess the same desires and goals - to be whole, to fit in, to be loved.This is one of Goldwyn's best performances to date, because he shows tenderness as well as strength, making him vulnerable, making him real. As the social worker Jack, he is torn between his love for his guys in the home, and his need to make a decent living and take care of his wife. The extra features give you a look into the thinking of each actor behind his performance, as well as the director's take on the piece, which is based on the play by Tom Griffin. This is a great movie to snuggle up with someone you love and watch with a big bowl of popcorn.
