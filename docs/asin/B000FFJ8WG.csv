988913,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000FFJ8WG,Artist & Author,"[66, 68]","Without question, this is one of the best movies ever made that gives a Christian message without the slightest preaching or moralizing.  The film starts out with the children of the community having a contest saying memorized Scripture verses, true, but that was common when children were learning to read in the McGuffy readers.  The winner of the contest was the daughter in the community's only black family.  The movie wouldn't be realistic if it didn't show the community's prejudice toward them.  However, the film never veers into anything resembling a civil rights movie.  These wonderful parents recognized the racism of some in the community,  of course, but their focus was on living a righteous life within the sub-context of racism.  They truly lived Martin Luther King's dream of being judged by the content of their character.Therefore, when the movie crisis arises, it is clear that it isn't because the family is black.  It is because the villains resent that the father was both a harder worker and that he was totally honest and righteous.  I hesitate to say more because I really want you to see this movie and to receive its full impact.  Let me just say that the father in this movie closely reflected the story of Stephen in the Bible (Acts 7:60).  He truly lived Jesus' command to 'Love your enemies.'  The wonderful quality of his example is that he passed this capacity for unselfish love on to his daughter.If your family believes that traditional family values, Biblical values, need to be passed on to your children, there could hardly be a better example for them to follow than this humble, loving family.  The movie production qualities are also of the highest level.  But, I cannot find proper words to adequately recommend this movie.  From a traditional values and character point of view, it is beyond description.",5,A AAA+ Movie for Traditional Values Families,1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,1851,"['question', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Christian', 'message', 'slightest', 'preaching', 'moralizing', 'film', 'out', 'children', 'community', 'having', 'contest', 'saying', 'memorized', 'Scripture', 'verses', 'true', 'was', 'common', 'when', 'children', 'were', 'learning', 'read', 'McGuffy', 'readers', 'winner', 'contest', 'was', 'daughter', 'community', 'only', 'black', 'family', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'realistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'community', 'prejudice', 'However', 'film', 'never', 'veers', 'anything', 'resembling', 'civil', 'rights', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'parents', 'recognized', 'racism', 'community', 'course', 'focus', 'was', 'living', 'righteous', 'life', 'sub-context', 'racism', 'truly', 'lived', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'dream', 'being', 'judged', 'content', 'character.Therefore', 'when', 'movie', 'crisis', 'arises', 'clear', ""n't"", 'family', 'black', 'villains', 'resent', 'father', 'was', 'harder', 'worker', 'was', 'totally', 'honest', 'righteous', 'hesitate', 'say', 'more', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'receive', 'full', 'impact', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'father', 'movie', 'closely', 'reflected', 'story', 'Stephen', 'Bible', 'Acts', '7:60', 'truly', 'lived', 'Jesus', 'command', ""'Love"", 'enemies', 'wonderful', 'quality', 'example', 'passed', 'capacity', 'unselfish', 'love', 'daughter.If', 'family', 'traditional', 'family', 'values', 'Biblical', 'values', 'need', 'be', 'passed', 'children', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'better', 'example', 'follow', 'humble', 'loving', 'family', 'movie', 'production', 'qualities', 'are', 'also', 'highest', 'level', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'proper', 'words', 'adequately', 'recommend', 'movie', 'traditional', 'values', 'character', 'point', 'view', 'description']",Words by  Heart
