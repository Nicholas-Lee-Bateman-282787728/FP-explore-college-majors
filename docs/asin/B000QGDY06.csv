1076008,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000QGDY06,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 10]","Premontition' presents a family venue much in the mold of the paranormal plots these days.  The premise draws upon `D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu' and `Medium' with much of the atmosphere of  `The Sixth Sense'.  (There's even a shower scene where the seer comes upon her beloved.)  Can we change events of our loved ones if we can see in the future?  After watching this film I felt like I had been here before.  Despite some retread the movie has some redeeming values.First of all `Premonition' does live up to its title.  The movie opens with Linda (Sandra Bullock) listening to her husband giving a phone message into their answering machine.  Shortly after she answers the door and is greeted by a police officer.  Somberly, the man tells her that her husband was in a serious car accident, and he didn't survive.  She is incredulous.  Not merely shock, but she understandably thinks it a mistake given the context of her husband's message.From there we get fragmented events that make it seem like Linda is bumping into the future.  People she doesn't know address her and loved ones provide details she is oblivious about.  Meeting with her mother, who is a significant caretaker for her two children, she seems out of it, forlorned, bewildered.  Then, sleep becomes something of a portal, or maybe a change of consciousness.  When Linda awakes everything is back to normal.  Jim is alive, the children are fine, and the forbidding omens disappear.  Unlike many other films, the time frame gets shuffled, so she often loses track of what day it is and which events are meant to stay in sequence.Added to her turmoil is the aspect of psychiatric care.  It gives us a sense of ambiguity done in movies like 'Donnie Darko' where we have to figure out what the true source of her problems in the story.  Many of those bumps in the future feature Linda being treated by Dr. Roth (Peter Stormare), a psychiatrist.  Besides sharing with her best friend Annie, she really confides her dilemma with him.  Obviously, not specializing in paranormal psychology, he gives her a prescription for lithium instead of an outlook of the future.She also seeks advice from the parish priest.  He gives her good advice, but, then, Linda is on her own.  She must decide what to do with the future she's been presented.  Can she save her husband?  Do the visions give her some command of the future?There are many aspects to admire in `Premonition'.  The movie does keep an up to date standard of edginess.  Even though it relies on music and editing more than most, and there`s one scene that uses a shaky pivoting camera to express the strife when Linda is confronting her family.  Sandra Bollock gives a fine performance as Linda.  Through her we can truly see Linda's grief and frustration.  On the other hand, some of the other omens don't fit in the story as well.  Perhaps disasters come in threes, but when Linda is startled by an explosion of a telephone wire, a crow is killed and lays before her.  It matches an event foreseen before, but it doesn't tell us much.  And that's how I left 'Premonition'.  Surely, most people won't be angry or overly disappointed after having watched this movie, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.I believe the movie will appeal to the masses who are yearning for ""family values"" in their films.  The moviemakers' motives are admirable, but the execution of the story is so riddled with mysterious roadblocks that it made me feel like I had a long and cruel joke played on me.",2,"""Emptiness Invites a Vacuum""",1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,3504,"['Premontition', 'presents', 'family', 'venue', 'much', 'mold', 'paranormal', 'plots', 'days', 'premise', 'D', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'Vu', 'Medium', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'even', 'shower', 'scene', 'where', 'seer', 'beloved', 'Can', 'change', 'events', 'loved', 'ones', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'watching', 'film', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'here', 'before', 'retread', 'movie', 'redeeming', 'values.First', 'Premonition', 'live', 'up', 'title', 'movie', 'Linda', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'listening', 'husband', 'giving', 'phone', 'message', 'answering', 'machine', 'Shortly', 'door', 'greeted', 'police', 'officer', 'Somberly', 'man', 'husband', 'was', 'serious', 'car', 'accident', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'incredulous', 'Not', 'merely', 'shock', 'understandably', 'mistake', 'given', 'context', 'husband', 'message.From', 'there', 'get', 'fragmented', 'events', 'make', 'Linda', 'bumping', 'future', 'People', ""n't"", 'know', 'address', 'loved', 'ones', 'provide', 'details', 'oblivious', 'Meeting', 'mother', 'who', 'significant', 'caretaker', 'two', 'children', 'forlorned', 'bewildered', 'Then', 'sleep', 'becomes', 'something', 'portal', 'maybe', 'change', 'consciousness', 'When', 'Linda', 'everything', 'back', 'normal', 'Jim', 'alive', 'children', 'are', 'fine', 'forbidding', 'disappear', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'time', 'frame', 'shuffled', 'often', 'track', 'what', 'day', 'events', 'are', 'meant', 'stay', 'sequence.Added', 'turmoil', 'aspect', 'psychiatric', 'care', 'sense', 'ambiguity', 'done', 'movies', ""'Donnie"", 'Darko', 'where', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'true', 'source', 'problems', 'story', 'Many', 'bumps', 'future', 'feature', 'Linda', 'being', 'treated', 'Dr.', 'Roth', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'psychiatrist', 'sharing', 'best', 'friend', 'Annie', 'really', 'dilemma', 'Obviously', 'not', 'specializing', 'paranormal', 'psychology', 'prescription', 'lithium', 'instead', 'outlook', 'future.She', 'also', 'advice', 'parish', 'priest', 'good', 'advice', 'then', 'Linda', 'own', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'future', 'been', 'presented', 'Can', 'save', 'husband', 'Do', 'visions', 'give', 'command', 'future', 'are', 'many', 'aspects', 'admire', 'Premonition', 'movie', 'keep', 'up', 'date', 'standard', 'edginess', 'Even', 'music', 'editing', 'more', 'most', 'there', 's', 'one', 'scene', 'shaky', 'pivoting', 'camera', 'express', 'strife', 'when', 'Linda', 'confronting', 'family', 'Sandra', 'Bollock', 'fine', 'performance', 'Linda', 'can', 'truly', 'see', 'Linda', 'grief', 'frustration', 'other', 'hand', 'other', 'omens', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'disasters', 'come', 'threes', 'when', 'Linda', 'startled', 'explosion', 'telephone', 'wire', 'crow', 'killed', 'event', 'foreseen', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'how', 'left', ""'Premonition"", 'Surely', 'most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'angry', 'overly', 'disappointed', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questions.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'masses', 'who', 'are', 'yearning', 'family', 'values', 'films', 'moviemakers', 'motives', 'are', 'admirable', 'execution', 'story', 'so', 'riddled', 'mysterious', 'roadblocks', 'made', 'feel', 'had', 'long', 'cruel', 'joke', 'played']",Premonition

Sandra Bullock is my all time favorite actress, I really like her acting style.  As for Julian McMahon, this is the second role that I know of where he is the object of a premonition.  This movie is very well made.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, it takes another twist and turn.  It is a film that must be watched in its entirety to be enjoyed.  I first saw it on per-per-view (Movies on Demand).  After reading some not-so-favorable reviews, I thought I'd wait until it was available on cable.  I was pleasantly surprised, and then ordered the DVD.

Its not really a thriller, its not really a horror film and it comes off at times as a confused mess.Sandra Bullock plays Linda Hanson a comfortable suburban woman who at first glance appears to have everything. She lives in a great house, has at first blush a loving husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and two young daughters. One day she gets a knock on the door from the sheriff's department telling her that Jim has been killed in an accident and her seemingly normal life begins to unravel. The next morning she wakes up to find her husband alive and well. Is this a premonition that she has had or is she losing her mind?Bullock takes on the role quite well but the non linear storytelling gets in the way of the audiences' enjoyment of the film. Days and events happen at random and the end result is more headache inducing than thrilling. Also, there is a tacked on quasi religious theme that is really not necessary to the story. The interesting question is  posed that if one know about future events does one have the power to change them? Sadly, this story line is not well developed.I saw the regular definition widescreen disc. The transfer is quite good and the audio in 5.1 sound is clear and has no noticible problems. The score by Klaus Badelt is eerie and effective as is the cinematography byTorsten Lippstock.The disc comes with an array of extras including a commentary by Yapo and Bullock, deleted scenes with optional commentary, a gag real, a making of featurette, a completely unnecessary feature that tells the story in normal linear order and a double featurette on people who experience real life premonitions. A word on the commentary: it starts quite dry but picks up as the movie goes along.This is not a bad package for a rental but it is far from one of the best movie of the year.

It just looked like another unnecessary remake of what wasn't even a good Asian horror film in the first place. But let's face it, and I'm probably not the only guy that thinks so, but Hollywood likes familiarity. When certain films get successful, their thinking is ""well the public probably wants more then"". Well no, we don't want tons of remakes; we just want good movies and sadly to say, Premonition isn't one of them.Linda is a housewife married to Jim and has 2 daughters. One day, Linda receives the shock of her life when Jim dies in a brutal car accident en route to a business meeting. But strangely she wakes up the next day and finds out that he's actually still alive and hasn't even went on his trip yet. This continues as she wakes up and finds it a different day, husband's dead and every time she wakes up she's either seeing Jim still alive or long since dead. Can she change the future and save her husband's life?In the original, a man loses his wife and child in a car accident but finds it hasn't happened yet however he can also see other's deaths before they happen and even prevent his loss. Here, she's basically caught in a time warp that for some reason just likes to mess with her. It's never really explained right away why she has to experience a certain day before another but then when it is and we see how her knowledge of things helps her in other situations we don't really care since they're kind of distracting. Can she save him or not? That's the whole point but we see other vignettes such as a creepy psychiatrist, a blonde woman, scars on one of her daughter's faces that you feel like ""come on already, get to the point.""But this is a remake of a horror movie so in that basis: is the film scary? Well no, at times it's not even creepy. This is more a bad character study in how someone can grieve and experience traumatic events and whether you can change them so those of you looking for thrills and scares might look elsewhere. Of course sometimes certain screwy logic and an ever-changing timeline just makes kind of a mess of things.In Crash, Sandra Bullock did a more dramatic role but thanks to the awful, contrived dialogue she didn't really feel like a full character.

She is such a likeable actress and is so enjoyable on the screen.  Why does she end up with so many of these lackluster vehicles?The movie has such a heavy mood that it would have to give us a big payoff to justify such constant oppression and depression.  But there never is a big payoff.  What there is one has to rationalize into it once the movie is over.For me the movie was a kind of blend of Groundhog Day without the humor, Frequency without the active sense of doing something about the situation (to her credit, Bullock's Linda Hanson does come to grips with what she is facing.  However, I didn't.).Screenwriters need to figure out that a sad ending has to be justified by either an uplift that makes it all understandable or an unsparing bleakness that cauterizes as it wounds.  This kind of dripping sadness is typified by Linda's visit with the priest.  She comes away with something that we can't really see and can only project in later, but she continues without any meaningful definition of faith nor is her commitment to God rekindled.The whole time continuum disruption plot device is interesting and handled with appropriate fuzziness and confusion.  Linda isn't particularly an intellectual or analytical person, so she struggles in putting the pieces together.  Julian McMahon does a fine job as Jim Hanson.  He is a work obsessed man who loves himself and his ideas of his self-importance more than his family.  He flatters himself that he loves them and provides for them so that entitles him to ignore them.  That sounds like reality for too many families!  In the final analysis, this is a film about Jim and Linda and whether they can relocate their love and rekindle their marriage before it is ended one way or the other.Not a bad movie, but in some ways not worth the work.

Anybody could see that coming... even Bill Kelly.)Anyhow, in this pitifully awkward attempt to create a 6th Sense look-alike, the filmmaker came up with a pretty good idea ... and then massacred it. The plot is that Linda (Sandra Bullock)predicts that her husband will die, then he doesn't, and then he does, then he doesn't, then he does.  (Repeat as often as necessary.) Like the stock market, he just crashes, only to return ... to crash again.  The problem is that in a movie like this, it gets just plain confusing when the main character keeps jumping around, not only in time, but into different plots. In one future scenario, she's committed to a mental institution by a shrink who looks like a member of the Russian mafia. In another she's sort of glad her husband is dead after finding out he was going to have an affair. It's no less confusing when she goes back in time, since all of those plots are inconsistent as well. Sometimes he's in the shower when she wakes up, sometimes the kids wake her up, sometimes she calls her friend, jogs, hangs laundry ... you know, all those fascinating things that make up the life of a woman who can predict death. And if the writer was trying to pull off some kind of time line interference story, in which the main character's actions somehow affect the future (which would account for some inconsistencies in the plot), he also needed to provide some kind of background.  Like why was the marriage going sour in the first place? (After all that was an instrinsic part of the story, or at least one of them.)I got the strong feeling right around the time that the priest actually spells out exactly what this story is about (""Fight For Love""), that the writer was trying to deliver a message, which, in a movie is always a bad idea.  But like the rest of the script, Bill failed at that too, because in the touching reconciliation in which Linda and her hubby work out their relationship on their cell phones, while traveling in tandem, full speed, down the highway, it's Linda who actually ends up getting him killed. Frankly, I would seriously NOT be okay with that if I were the wife... or Sandra Bullock for that matter (I mean, did she actually read the script before she signed on the dotted line??).

However, it was very dissapointing when suddenly the movie stops and the credits start rolling which seemed to me not to have an ending to this movie, and leaving a lot of unanswered questions.One of the hidden bonus features, is an alternate ending (hidden in the deleted scenes section) which I figured would give me the ending and closure I desired, but it is even worse, as it cuts off too, right at the most important part.Also, how can the police officer inform her that her husband died as if he didn't know she would already know that?  He would have met her at the accident unless she ran away and left his body and went home real quick.  Why would she do that?We also know she ends up in a mental institution, yet she also lives happily ever after with her kids in a new house?If you take a properly done time shifted movie and edit it back in proper time sequence, it should still make sense, but this movie does not pass this test.For those that feel disapointed by this movie, I suggest watching ""Primer"" which put a lot more thought into the effects of going back and forth in time to try and alter the outcome.  Imediately after watching that movie, you have to watch it again, in order to understand what is happening, and watching it again is really watching the second half of it, watching it once is like only seeing half the movie.But in Premonition, if you watched the movie again, you will see parts that make no sense, already knowing everything that is going to happen.Other than that, I enjoyed the idea and the concept alot, I just wish someone else would have done this, fixing the time mistakes so it made more sense.The gag reel left a really bad feeling.  After watching this movie, you are put in a really low emotional state, and can't imagine any gags or funny parts during the production of this movie.

1076058,AY12DBB0U420B,B000QGDY06,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","My bargain-rack movie  for last night was ""Premonition"" starring Sandra Bullock. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. I have very mixed feelings about the movie. The photography and sound were rather good. The acting was good. The movie was well put together, without question. Yet it just didn't jell as a movie. Well, that's too bad. It looks as if a lot of effort went into this film, but I just didn't care for it.The basic story is  that a happily married wife with two beautiful little daughters and a nice new home had a dream or premonition that her husband had died. Well, we've probably all had things like this happen and it can be a frightening experience. Okay, from that point on the movie takes on an artsy set of scenes or small stories that go back and forth from his death to his reappearance, to his funeral, to his reappearance and so forth. Back and forth, back and forth, then sideways with little stories about one of his daughters being injured, then she's partly healed, then she's totally healed, then the accident in which she's injured is shown, and so forth. All of this gets to be incredibly complicated, so complicated that the wife (Sandra Bullock) set up a chart to plot all of the events to try to understand and make sense out of it. My advice would be that the viewer set up a similar chart or you're not going to be able to follow the story. Personally, I doubt that you can follow it with the chart.Well, this could have been a simple and emotional story, well told. But it wasn't well told. It was muddied to the point where it was very difficult to follow. What's the point? All this back and forth, sideways, back and forth, up and down didn't really add anything to the simple story. All it did was take the viewers through a bewildering set of twists and turns. And then there's the end, a tragic car crash and the closing credits appear. Well, best of luck.

1076061,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000QGDY06,Grady Harp,"[4, 6]","Relative newcomers, writer Bill Kelly and director Mennan Yapo, have concocted a testy little conundrum of a movie titled PREMONITION: whether the audience decides to step into their little nightmare or reject the premise that powerful emotions can drive the brain to peculiar directions of functioning will be the divisive break in acceptance of the film's premise. It is a fairly well done, thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast.The Hanson family is introduced as the husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and wife Linda (Sandra Bullock) buy their new home.  Jump forward after the credits to a family that now includes two young schoolgirls (Shyann McClure and Courtney Taylor Burness), a seemingly mildly depressed Linda and a workaholic Jim.  Abruptly, Linda is informed by a police officer that Jim has died in an auto accident and her close friend (Nia Long) and mother (Irene Ziegler) help Linda through the early moments of the tragedy.  Yet Linda continues to 'relive' moments: one day Jim is dead the next he is alive, and all of the pieces of the puzzle that erode Linda's mind become clues to investigate information she doesn't want to know. She encounters a warped psychiatrist (Peter Stormare) and a possible 'other woman' in Jim's life (Amber Valletta), and as she attempts to mold the puzzle pieces to make sense, she learns about the possible 'why' of the mental state in which she is trapped.The film has problems holding credibility, but then the premise is a novel enough to allow such missteps.  Sandra Bullock takes over this role completely, gains our empathy, and in the end the film works because of her.  She is becoming an actress who is learning the value of understatement and that aspect of her craft serves her well.  No, this is not a great movie, but it is a well-produced little mystery that asks the audience to engage both mind and imagination, and that is a good thing!

So, the best I can say about this is that it is watchable.This isn't so much a time-travel movie, just a time-error movie.  Sandra Bullock plays a woman who lives one of her weeks out of order.  She wakes up on a Thursday and is told by the Sheriff that her husband is dead.  However, after grieving she goes to bed and wakes up earlier in the week only to find him alive.  She thinks she only dreamed the previous day and it takes a few days for her to realize that her days are out of order.This story could have been better.  The underlying story line is that the husband dies as he is headed out to have an affair.  So, does she let him die or does she try to save him?The biggest problem is that there are soooo many inconsistencies.  The biggest were some cuts on a girl's face.  This ended up occurring on the Tuesday of that week yet she lives through an entire Thursday where she didn't have cuts.  Sandra Bullock's mother is concerned because she doesn't know how the girl was cut but there were enough witnesses to the account to have told her the truth.  There was one day that started off repeating another day so I'm wondering if the writers were confused... tryng to write a new version of Groundhog's Day but instead changing it to a miss-step in time instead without changing the fundamentals of the story.And that is not all, but I think you get the idea:Flaws, flaws, flaws.  Some I can forgive but this movie was riddled with them and it just destroyed it for me and took all the enjoyment out of it.  There was so much more potential than a house-wife losing his man to another girl.  Come on!!

""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","Sandra Bullock has the keen sensitivity to pick up some roles that she thinks she can create a niche and leave a mark of her acting skills. That is what interests me to see her movies. In ""Premonition"" - a time-tripping attempt to do for marital malaise what ""Groundhog Day"" did for commitment-phobia - a bored housewife named Linda (Sandra Bullock) wakes up one day, like any other day, and goes about her daily routine. She makes breakfast, takes the kids to school, jogs, does laundry - the usual. The day then takes a tragic turn when Linda learns, from an all too cryptic policeman, that her husband (Julian McMahon from ""Nip/Tuck"") has been killed in a car accident. Understandably, Linda takes the rest of the day to grieve and console her two daughters before passing out on the couch. The next day she wakes up in her bed...next to her husband - who is, it turns out, quite alive. Was it all a dream? Eventually (and it takes her a while to figure it out) it becomes clear that Linda is living the days of one week in random order. And, at some point, her husband is going to die. It's an intriguing concept for a film with something to say, or a character with the smarts to use this phenomenon to her advantage. ""Premonition"" has neither.In the film's early moments, director Mennan Yapo - who made 2004's appropriately atmospheric ""Soundless"" - does an admirable job of keeping the audience off balance - at times quite literally; his frequent swaying handheld shots produce a vertiginous effect. But as the film progresses and the audience struggles to keep track of the days, even fancy camera moves don't help. I could see what relative-newcomer Bill Kelly was trying to do with his script: he meant to say something about treasuring each day because the end could come at anytime. But the effect of jumping randomly around the days of one week as if ""they were thrown up in the air like a deck of cards"" is too arbitrary to produce any real intrigue and repeated trips to find her husband in the shower brought to mind a certain infamous ""Dallas"" season finale (I half expected Patrick Duffy to be standing there). It's clear the film is struggling to keep the suspense up when it throws in the peculiar casting of Peter Stormare as Dr. Roth, filmdom's most ominous psychiatrist.It's hard to dislike Sandra Bullock. Whether she's playing the lovelornThe Lake House (Widescreen Edition)or the love-starved28 Days (Special Edition)the actress has an innate charm that can make some of the drippiest material palatable. SinceSpeed (Widescreen Edition)Ms. Bullock has tried her hand at thrillers with largely disappointing resultsThe Net (Special Edition)""Murder by Numbers (Widescreen Edition). The obvious reason would appear to be the questionable material involved, but that's not entirely the caseMiss Congeniality (Deluxe Edition)wasn't brilliant writing, but it played to Ms. Bullock's charisma). In ""Premonition"", I think the actress smiles a total of once in 100 minutes on screen.

1076073,A1UQNX8S78JU0G,B000QGDY06,Jessica Teel,"[12, 16]","In Premonition you can see Linda (Sandra Bullock) put away the groceries, fold the laundry, hang the laundry, dust the house, drive the kids to school, cook dinner, serve breakfast, and even go to the grocery store.  When this thriller really gets going, you can watch Linda sleep and even wash her hands!  Why no one involved in the production of this movie ever realized that watching Linda live a painful boring life as a housewife makes for a painfully boring movie is the only mystery involved in Premonition.  The attempts to make Linda's routine life a supernatural thriller are so ridiculous that the movie actually entertains by being so outrageously stupid.  One can't help laughing out loud as her husband's head rolls out of the casket and plops on the ground, or the ubiquitous raven (used so pathetically to symbolize creepy action occurring here) gets fried on an electric wire and falls stiff into Linda's yard.  Premonition steals from better done supernatural thrillers- Linda consults with a priest who offers up a completely nonsensical ""spiritual"" explanation, Linda wakes up and finds a bottle of Lithium in her bathroom so maybe she is just crazy, Linda is committed to a mental hospital and implicated in Jim's murder so maybe she killed him or is being framed.  Unfortunately there is no logical thread tying together any of these theories.  More importantly there isn't any action or suspense (unless you count Linda pouring a bowl of cheerios) to make you entertained enough to care why Linda keeps reliving the same week over and over again.  Adding creepy, feverish violin music to Linda doing house chores doesn't equal a ""thriller"".  Perhaps the most perplexing thing in the movie is that it features a male redemption story (that of Linda's philandering husband Jim).  However in a bazaar twist on the male redemption genre, it is Linda who ends up responsible for redeeming their nuclear family (cue the priest's voice over for Linda to ""choose what is worth fighting for"").  Lucky for her, Jim still winds up dead.

1076075,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000QGDY06,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[3, 6]","A new era of films has arrived. This genre we'd like to call ""Alternate-Universe Melodrama"" that is full of characters that live in impossible situations, incomprehensive plots, cheesy explanation, and last but not least, movie stars with dying careers. The title says it all; Premonition is about a soccer mom who can see the future few days ahead by simple falling asleep. Does it sound like a cool concept? Indeed, but the story is so poorly explained that you'll get frustrated by trying to figure out what day she is in, and why she is having these strange visions--you might also get frustrated by how much screen time Sandra gets in this movie.Brief Intro Story:Premonition begins when Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) shows the new house he just bought for his young wife Linda (Sandra Bullock). They are thrilled about the house and this new beginning. Time passes by and now they have two young daughters. Everything seems to be going well for this family, but things are about to get ugly--and strange. On an ordinary Wednesday, Linda gets the worst news of her life. A police officer knocks on her door and tells her that her husband died in a car accident. Linda and her daughters cry their loss. Heart-broken and confused, she goes to sleep on her couch that night--her mom Joanne (Kate Nelligan) is also around the house to help her.When Linda wakes up the following day, she is in her bed and wearing different clothes. She goes to the kitchen and yes, her husband is alive having breakfast! Was it a nightmare? She thinks so, at least at first, and continues with her day. Goes to bed again that night, wakes up and returns to the ""present"" where she sees family and friends getting ready for the funeral. She freaks out--anyone would, obviously--and tells everyone that her husband is not dead. What is going on here? She wonders. It didn't take long for Linda to discover that she can see the events prior to her husband's death and will try to stop it. As she investigates--one day at a time--she finds some dark secrets about her husband. Will she be able to change the future?Review:Unknown director Mennan Yapo brings to the big screen one of the most confusing films of 2007--very little drama and no mystery. It's not just the confusion that turns us off; it's also the plot holes that the movie creates as it goes on. Premonition never explains why she is having these visions--a cheesy explanation by a ""historian"" priest doesn't count. What's so special about Linda that makes her see the future in such a vivid way? Is it God, psychosis or just drugs?Perhaps Sandra's ego was in charge of this film. She delivers a decent performance, but she is virtually in every frame. We see her running, shopping, sleeping, driving, smoking and even taking a shower three times--sorry guys, very little nudity. The whole story revolves too much on her and not the actual mystery. We know that she looks great for her age and that's fine, but too much of a good thing is bad. Could this be the ""Queen Bee"" Syndrome? I'm sure Jesse James (Monster Garage) is going to have this DVD in his personal collection.Despite the dullness of this film, we find some scenes that actually worked--the ""open the casket"" moment was pretty dramatic, and the ultimate fate of her husband might shock some people. These dramatic moments gives us some idea of what Linda is going through, but they are short and far between.The Verdict:Don't say that we didn't warn you. Premonition is nothing but a dull, long and confusing film about a woman that for some strange reason can see the ultimate fate of her husband. If you watch it, don't try to figure it out because nothing makes any sense. If you're a fan of Sandra Bullock--you know who you are--and don't care about anything about the film, by all means go see this film because she is ""the film.""My Score: 4",2,I'm sure Jesse James (Monster Garage) is going to have this DVD in his personal collection,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,3854,"['new', 'era', 'films', 'arrived', 'genre', ""'d"", 'like', 'call', 'Alternate-Universe', 'Melodrama', 'full', 'characters', 'live', 'impossible', 'situations', 'incomprehensive', 'plots', 'cheesy', 'explanation', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'movie', 'stars', 'dying', 'careers', 'title', 'Premonition', 'soccer', 'mom', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'few', 'days', 'ahead', 'simple', 'falling', 'asleep', 'sound', 'cool', 'concept', 'Indeed', 'story', 'so', 'poorly', 'explained', ""'ll"", 'get', 'frustrated', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'day', 'why', 'having', 'strange', 'visions', 'might', 'also', 'get', 'frustrated', 'how', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Sandra', 'movie.Brief', 'Intro', 'Story', 'Premonition', 'when', 'Jim', 'Hanson', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'new', 'house', 'just', 'bought', 'young', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'are', 'thrilled', 'house', 'new', 'beginning', 'Time', 'passes', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Everything', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'family', 'things', 'are', 'get', 'ugly', 'strange', 'ordinary', 'Wednesday', 'Linda', 'worst', 'news', 'life', 'police', 'officer', 'knocks', 'door', 'husband', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'Linda', 'daughters', 'cry', 'loss', 'Heart-broken', 'confused', 'sleep', 'couch', 'night', 'mom', 'Joanne', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'also', 'house', 'help', 'her.When', 'Linda', 'up', 'following', 'day', 'bed', 'wearing', 'different', 'clothes', 'kitchen', 'yes', 'husband', 'alive', 'having', 'breakfast', 'Was', 'nightmare', 'so', 'least', 'first', 'day', 'Goes', 'bed', 'again', 'night', 'up', 'returns', 'present', 'where', 'family', 'friends', 'getting', 'ready', 'funeral', 'out', 'anyone', 'would', 'obviously', 'everyone', 'husband', 'not', 'dead', 'What', 'going', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Linda', 'discover', 'can', 'see', 'events', 'prior', 'husband', 'death', 'will', 'try', 'stop', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'dark', 'secrets', 'husband', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'change', 'future', 'Review', 'Unknown', 'director', 'Mennan', 'Yapo', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'most', 'confusing', 'films', '2007', 'very', 'little', 'drama', 'mystery', 'not', 'just', 'confusion', 'off', 'also', 'plot', 'movie', 'Premonition', 'never', 'why', 'having', 'visions', 'cheesy', 'explanation', 'historian', 'priest', ""n't"", 'count', 'What', 'so', 'special', 'Linda', 'see', 'future', 'such', 'vivid', 'way', 'God', 'psychosis', 'just', 'drugs', 'Perhaps', 'Sandra', 'ego', 'was', 'charge', 'film', 'decent', 'performance', 'virtually', 'frame', 'see', 'running', 'shopping', 'sleeping', 'driving', 'smoking', 'even', 'taking', 'shower', 'three', 'times', 'sorry', 'guys', 'very', 'little', 'nudity', 'whole', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'actual', 'mystery', 'know', 'great', 'age', 'fine', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'Could', 'be', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'Syndrome', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Monster', 'Garage', 'going', 'have', 'DVD', 'personal', 'collection.Despite', 'dullness', 'film', 'find', 'scenes', 'actually', 'worked', 'open', 'casket', 'moment', 'was', 'pretty', 'dramatic', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'husband', 'might', 'shock', 'people', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'idea', 'what', 'Linda', 'going', 'are', 'short', 'far', 'between.The', 'Verdict', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'Premonition', 'nothing', 'dull', 'long', 'confusing', 'film', 'woman', 'strange', 'reason', 'can', 'see', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'husband', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'nothing', 'sense', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anything', 'film', 'means', 'go', 'see', 'film', 'film', 'Score', '4']",Premonition

One person detests a work that another finds fresh and amazing.Go figure.I like Sandra Bullock. So I think I'm looking at Premonition through that mindset. I also love suspense and twisty plots. Bullock plays a solid character like she does in each of her films - a woman facing circumstances with varying degrees of self-control and courage. Linda reminded me of Bullock's character in Crash.The plot had intriguing moments. Daily activities filled with quiet desperation set the scene for an unraveling marriage. Linda's realization of impending tragedy and then the cloud of surreality that surrounded her as she lived one very different day at a time made the movie clip along. The filming tended to be stark and clean which added to the suspense feel and evoked a sense of loneliness.None of the characters were particularly lovable, even the children took a bit to warm up to.The element of faith ended up being an empty platitude.If you hated Lake House -- don't even try with Premonition.If you are a mistake collector and will likely see the movie with a spread sheet and try to make all the parts create a seamless whole, I don't see how that's going to happen...so don't go there.If you have to have a big smile on your face when you shut off a movie...I don't think this will give you what you're looking for.I could call it an interesting relationship study or a suspenseful hand-holding movie that leaves you with questions to ponder.",3,"Hmmm Yes, I Liked, But Then...",1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,1519,"['Sometimes', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'how', 'differently', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'same', 'thing', 'One', 'person', 'work', 'fresh', 'amazing.Go', 'figure.I', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'So', 'think', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Premonition', 'mindset', 'also', 'love', 'suspense', 'twisty', 'plots', 'Bullock', 'solid', 'character', 'films', 'woman', 'facing', 'circumstances', 'varying', 'degrees', 'self-control', 'courage', 'Linda', 'reminded', 'Bullock', 'character', 'Crash.The', 'plot', 'had', 'intriguing', 'moments', 'Daily', 'activities', 'filled', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'set', 'scene', 'unraveling', 'marriage', 'Linda', 'realization', 'impending', 'tragedy', 'then', 'cloud', 'surreality', 'surrounded', 'lived', 'one', 'very', 'different', 'day', 'time', 'made', 'movie', 'clip', 'filming', 'tended', 'be', 'stark', 'clean', 'added', 'suspense', 'feel', 'evoked', 'sense', 'loneliness.None', 'characters', 'were', 'particularly', 'lovable', 'even', 'children', 'took', 'bit', 'warm', 'up', 'to.The', 'element', 'faith', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'empty', 'platitude.If', 'hated', 'Lake', 'House', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'Premonition.If', 'are', 'mistake', 'collector', 'will', 'likely', 'see', 'movie', 'spread', 'sheet', 'try', 'make', 'parts', 'create', 'seamless', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'going', 'happen', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'there.If', 'have', 'have', 'big', 'smile', 'face', 'when', 'shut', 'off', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'give', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'for.I', 'could', 'call', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'study', 'suspenseful', 'hand-holding', 'movie', 'questions', 'ponder']",Premonition

Am I crazy or what?  When she gets to the church, it's completely deserted except for the kindly parish priest who tells her, ""Haven't seen you for a while.""  He has plenty of time to sit her down and tell her historical stories from his research into premonition.  Why didn't the Church have a few parishioners in it--why wasn't the priest saying Mass?  Maybe I had the day wrong, but I tore out a piece of shelf paper and scribbled a rough calendar with magic markers, every time I learned of a new terror for Sandra Bullock I wrote down what date it happened on, and my calendar as well as the screenplay, will swear in court it was Sunday morning.I know it was before the older little girl flew through the glsss doors and cuts blossomed over her innocent, sulky face.  I think she was expressing the pain of her mom and dad's dissolving marriage.  After THE LAKE HOUSE and CRASH, we all wanted Sandra Bullock to smile again, but this time around she's gone off the deep end into ceaseless, unyielding depression.  Her mouth is pinched, her forehead a giant frown.  her hair is limp, lifeless, and jumps around her head like the strings of a whisk broom.  She's brave, my wife said to me, for she shares a few scenes with former supermodel Amber Valletta, who's lost none of her oomph over the years, and the whole audience is figuring, of course he's going to that motel with Amber Valletta, why put up with Sandra Bullock's frowns and complaints a day longer.We learn from the priest that it's all about spiritual emptiness.  I think that perhaps the director, Mennon Yappo, was inspired by some of the late Ingmar Bergman's mid-period films like SHAME and THE PASSION OF ANNA and decided that, in Sandra Bullock, he had located the Liv Ullmann of our modern times, so he asked her to look glum, bought that fake bloody blackbird, got Kate Nelligan out of retirement, and hoped for the best.

1076085,AQQJO4W9VF6H8,B000QGDY06,Kristopher B. Huston,"[1, 1]","******Contains spoilers******  I thought this movie was pretty good, however there were some pretty big plot holes.  Basically, Linda expieriences a week out of her life in which she lives the days out of order and the main idea is that her husband Jim dies.  The breakdown.  Thursday, Monday, Saturday, Tuesday, Friday, Sunday, Wednesday.  Lets forget for a moment that the previous week, she went to bed on a Saturday night and woke up Thursday morning as Thursday is Day 1 of the week as she experiences it and is the day she finds out her husband is dead.  She did mention to her friend on the phone that she didn't know where the week had gone, but she literally hasn't experienced it yet, so that in itself is wierd.Ok, instead of breaking this movie down in the way she experienced it, I will break it down according to how it went chronologically to express some plot holes.  I will also add a number value to the date so we know the order Linda experiences it.Sunday(6): Linda wakes up and asks Jim to spend time with thier two girls.  She goes to a church and speaks with a priest, not sure what to fight for in her life.  She feels lost.  Before the girls go to bed, Jim tells them that he loves them and that he loves thier mother very much.  During a thunderstorm that night a crow is electrocuted and lands in the yard.  Linda misses him and wants things to be the way they were before and they make love.  She knows they don't have much time left.Monday(2): Linda wakes up and Jim is downstairs drinking coffee.  Day 2 for her, so is shocked to see Jim is still alive.  She figures it must have been a dream.  She goes about her day like any other day.  She gets pulled over by a cop, and it is the cop who told her that Jim had died.  He lets her go with a warning.  While hanging up some sheets to dry, she trips and falls and puts her hands on the dead crow and disposes of it in the trash.Tuesday(4):  Linda wakes up while Jim is in the shower and holds him.  He goes to work.  She meets Dr. Roth who prescribes her Lithium.  She looks in the trash and the dead crow is being eaten by hundreds of flies.  She meets Claire, her husband's almost other woman, while visiting Jim at his office, trying to pursade him to take a trip with her and the girls.  Later, she ends up dumping the Lithium pills in the sink.  One of the girls, Bridget, runs into the sliding glass door and and is rushed to the emergency room with cuts all over her face.  She thought she had put stickers up on the sliding class door. but none were there.  She tells Bridget she is beautiful and covers up all the mirrors in the house. She also realizes what is happening to her with the days not matching up and draws up a calender week to try and figure out what is happening.  She pleads with Jim that if tomorrow is Wednesday to wake her up before he leaves.Wednesday(7): Jim is driving in his car, he calls Claire and tell her he can't be with her, as she was waiting for him in a hotel room.  He dials home and leaves a message on the answering machine, but Linda is calling from her cell phone and he picks up the line.  He tells Linda he loves her and then dies after stalling out and being hit by a semi truck.  She witnessed the whole thing.Thursday(1):  This day is the first day Linda experiences in the week and therein lies the plot holes.  The mirrors in the house are no longer covered, and Bridget has no scars.  She does not notice the Lithium bottle in the sink.  She puts up stickers on the sliding glass door.  She learns Jim died in a car accident after playing the message he left the day before.  The girls work on a puzzle with thier grandmother who is staying the night to help Linda out.  She falls asleep on the couch holding a picture of her and husband when they got married.Friday(5):  Linda wakes up on the couch.  She pretty much knows what is going on at this point and confronts Claire.  Claire tells her that Jim never cheated on her, although he was going to.  She makes all the funeral arrangements and has some wine before bed, wondering if letting Jim die is the same as killing him.Saturday(3):  The day of the funeral.  The is the also the day that she first notices Bridget's scars and that the mirrors are all covered.  This is when she also notices the Lithium bottle in the sink.  She is later committed by Dr. RothI basically told the story this way to demonstrate the plot holes.  While Thursday is the first day she experiences, she still should have noticed the scars, the mirrors, and the Lithium bottle that day.  I understand in order to make the movie work, she couldn't have discovered them that quickly.  Perhaps I could let the Lithium bottle go if it were in a different place then the sink, a place one wouldn't look at every day, and if the cuts had happened on Friday instead of Tuesday, but that would have changed quite a few of the elements in the movie.I think Linda could have done more to prevent Jim's death.  Certainly Tuesday or Sunday she could have used what she knows about the future to prevent his death.  She could have taken the girls and told Jim she was going out of town, with or without him, hoping he would join them.  She could have just told him the truth about what she was experiecing but he would probably think she was crazy.  She could have just told him that she had a very vivid dream and plead with him that no matter what happens, to stay away from highway 57 on Wednesday.  Tuesday night, she could have set an alarm to ensure she would wake up on Wednesday before Jim leaves the house.All in all it was a great movie and I liked it alot!",4,"Good story, with some obvious

1076087,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000QGDY06,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) has become unstuck in time.  Actually the time frame is one week in which the days have been shuffled.  She wakes up and it is Thursday, but the next day it is the previous Monday, and the day after that it is the following Saturday.  This is all confusing and quite maddening to Linda, especially since Thursday is the day the sheriff rings the doorbell and tells her that her husband had been killed in a car accident the day before.  That means when she wakes up on Monday Jim (Julian McMahon) is still alive, but on Saturday they are burying him.  Family and friends are starting to think that Linda is having mental problems, and she is having problems wrapping her mind around what is going on herself.  But if she knows what is going to happen, then she can do something about it, right?This is one of Bullock's better performances as she takes advantage of the opportunity to do something different, but despite her best efforts this film lives and dies by the script by Bill Kelly (""Blast from the Past"").  The basic idea is pretty intriguing: Linda is living the days of this week out of sequence, which gives her the opportunity to do something about Jim's death.  The script even takes a nice twist when Linda starts thinking that maybe she should not do anything and just let it happen.  However, Kelly's script suffers from two fatal flaws, the first having to deal with Linda's ability to change things and the second with the way this twisted time travel tale plays out.If you have not seen ""Premonition"" then you should look away at this point because THERE BE SPOILERS HERE and I am going to rant and rave about these reasons why I deducted two stars off of this 2007 film's rating.  If you have not seen the film and are interested in the premise and/or actress, then check it out sometime and then come back and read the rest of this review:My rant is because Linda does not stop Bridgette from going through the plate glass door.  That happens on Tuesday and on Sunday Linda could put the damn flower stickers and save the door.  Bridgette did not have scars on Thursday, which was ""before"" Tuesday, but then she did not have them on Wednesday, which was ""after"" Tuesday.  Clearly Linda can do something about the past (which is where the future is usually found in this movie), and even if she does not want to do anything about Jim, she should want to spare Bridgette from getting her face all cut up.  I go back to the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" when Nancy wakes up and has yanked Freddy's hat back with her from her nightmare.  Nancy knows that this is important and figures out how she can make it work for her.  Linda is given a similar cosmic clue and she does absolutely nothing with it.  I thought preventing her daughter's accident would be the catalyst on Wednesday for Linda deciding to prevent the accident, butMy rave is that we get to the end of this film and it turns out that for all its complexity what with shuffling the days of the week and having Linda wrestle with whether or not she should prevent the accident, ""Premonition"" turns out to be such a variation on the old time traveling story that I have always related with the ""Titanic.""  You go back in time to stop the ""Titanic"" from hitting an iceberg, and while you are yelling, ""Look out for the iceberg!"" you distract the crew so they do not see the iceberg.  So Linda becomes the cause of Jim's death by trying to stop it.  Dramatic irony aside, the theoretical position here is that you cannot change the past because your attempt to change the past is already part of the past, so there.  The theological posturing at the end is too little too late, because I find it hard to believe that Linda would be able to live with what she has done.  Adding insult to injury is the alternate ending, which to me says they did not even have the courage of their conviction with the inadequate resolution of their intriguing premise.  At least the gag reel is about actually gags played on the set and not just flubbed lines, which was a nice touch, but not enough to redeem the flaws in this film.",3,An interesting premise and Bullock's performance cannot save this film,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,4128,"['Linda', 'Hanson', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'become', 'unstuck', 'time', 'Actually', 'time', 'frame', 'one', 'week', 'days', 'have', 'been', 'shuffled', 'up', 'Thursday', 'next', 'day', 'previous', 'Monday', 'day', 'following', 'Saturday', 'confusing', 'quite', 'maddening', 'Linda', 'especially', 'Thursday', 'day', 'sheriff', 'doorbell', 'husband', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'day', 'when', 'up', 'Monday', 'Jim', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'still', 'alive', 'Saturday', 'are', 'burying', 'Family', 'friends', 'are', 'starting', 'think', 'Linda', 'having', 'mental', 'problems', 'having', 'problems', 'wrapping', 'mind', 'what', 'going', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'then', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'right', 'one', 'Bullock', 'better', 'performances', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'best', 'efforts', 'film', 'dies', 'script', 'Bill', 'Kelly', 'Blast', 'Past', 'basic', 'idea', 'pretty', 'intriguing', 'Linda', 'living', 'days', 'week', 'sequence', 'opportunity', 'do', 'something', 'Jim', 'death', 'script', 'even', 'nice', 'twist', 'when', 'Linda', 'thinking', 'maybe', 'should', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'just', 'let', 'happen', 'However', 'Kelly', 'script', 'suffers', 'two', 'fatal', 'flaws', 'first', 'having', 'deal', 'Linda', 'ability', 'change', 'things', 'second', 'way', 'twisted', 'time', 'travel', 'tale', 'plays', 'out.If', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Premonition', 'then', 'should', 'look', 'away', 'point', 'THERE', 'BE', 'SPOILERS', 'HERE', 'am', 'going', 'rant', 'rave', 'reasons', 'why', 'deducted', 'two', 'stars', '2007', 'film', 'rating', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'interested', 'premise', 'and/or', 'actress', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'sometime', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'read', 'rest', 'review', 'rant', 'Linda', 'not', 'stop', 'Bridgette', 'going', 'plate', 'glass', 'door', 'Tuesday', 'Sunday', 'Linda', 'could', 'put', 'damn', 'flower', 'stickers', 'save', 'door', 'Bridgette', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'scars', 'Thursday', 'was', 'Tuesday', 'then', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Wednesday', 'was', 'Tuesday', 'Clearly', 'Linda', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'past', 'where', 'future', 'usually', 'found', 'movie', 'even', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'anything', 'Jim', 'should', 'want', 'spare', 'Bridgette', 'getting', 'face', 'cut', 'up', 'go', 'back', 'original', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'when', 'Nancy', 'up', 'yanked', 'Freddy', 'hat', 'back', 'nightmare', 'Nancy', 'important', 'out', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'work', 'Linda', 'given', 'similar', 'cosmic', 'clue', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'thought', 'preventing', 'daughter', 'accident', 'would', 'be', 'catalyst', 'Wednesday', 'Linda', 'deciding', 'prevent', 'accident', 'butMy', 'rave', 'get', 'end', 'film', 'out', 'complexity', 'what', 'shuffling', 'days', 'week', 'having', 'Linda', 'wrestle', 'not', 'should', 'prevent', 'accident', 'Premonition', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'variation', 'old', 'time', 'traveling', 'story', 'have', 'always', 'related', 'Titanic', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'stop', 'Titanic', 'hitting', 'iceberg', 'are', 'yelling', 'Look', 'out', 'iceberg', 'distract', 'crew', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'iceberg', 'So', 'Linda', 'cause', 'Jim', 'death', 'trying', 'stop', 'Dramatic', 'irony', 'aside', 'theoretical', 'position', 'here', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'past', 'attempt', 'change', 'past', 'already', 'part', 'past', 'there', 'theological', 'posturing', 'end', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'Linda', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'what', 'done', 'Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'alternate', 'ending', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'courage', 'conviction', 'inadequate', 'resolution', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'least', 'gag', 'reel', 'actually', 'gags', 'played', 'set', 'not', 'just', 'flubbed', 'lines', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'not', 'enough', 'redeem', 'flaws', 'film']",Premonition

Sure, it's gorgeous, but shouldn't that have been a joint decision? But in no time, Linda has decorated it to Pottery Barn Catalog perfection. She's such a Martha Stewart-style perfectionist that she even hangs her sheets outside to dry. Unfortunately for her, Jim has emotionally abandoned her and is considering an affair with a blonde female co-worker. All Linda's sacrifices to be a stay-at-home mom could come to nothing.Consciously, Linda is the devoted, downtrodden wife. Unconsciously, things are going differently. She starts having vivid premonitions that Jim is going to die in a car crash and that she's going to be labeled as being crazy when she tries to get help. Are we surprised? Jim provides financially for her and their daughters, but he's a passive-aggressive heel--not only to Linda, but also to his would-be girlfriend. I'm surprised she didn't start having premonitions, too.Linda's obsessive housekeeping comes to haunt her; her daughter runs into a glass door as they run to get the sheets out of the rain. Her daughter's injured face personifies her mother's wounded marriage. Linda's so upset about her daughter and her premonitions that she does things out of her neat-freak character--she rips a page out of telephone book, dumps pills in the sink and forgets to comb her hair. Linda's character falters here; she's just too self self-sacrificing--she's furious at Jim, can't she show a little anger and insight into her feelings? Also, Linda's mother seems to spend a lot of time at her daughter's house. Could her constant presence be a source of tension in the marriage? Maybe it's not all Jim's fault. The slow pace of this film reminded me of Douglas Sirk's ""Magnificent Obsession,"" where a husband also dies in a car crash, leaving an outwardly devoted wife behind.Since the policeman at the door in her premonitory dream has given her her the exact location of her husband's upcoming accident, Linda drives to the site and tries to prevent it, but you can't change fate, I guess. And does Linda really want to prevent the accident after all?  As ""Premonition"" ends, Linda is pregnant, financially secure and back with mom.

1076095,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B000QGDY06,magellan,"[4, 5]","This is overall a decent movie but is marred by some unfortunate flaws, mostly relating to plot plausibility and consistency. Well acted by the two main leads, Bullock and McMahon, it is nicely paced and has some beautiful cinematography, but it would have been so much better if not for several problems.I'm sure I'm not alone on many of these, but the problems I found were:1. Mother has daughter committed when it's obvious she's not responsible for the cuts on her child's face when she accidently ran thru the plate glass door. This just isn't explained and is contrary to the facts as presented in the movie.2. The scene with the priest where they try to explain her visions as a sort of spiritual uprootedness is just plain hokey. Movie thrillers aren't the best place for metaphysical and theological speculation.3. The menacing psychiatrist doesn't make much sense, nor does his prescribing Lithium on a first visit, a drug normally used for depression, not stress. The unsympathetic psychiatrist certainly adds to the overall stress factor in the movie but really isn't credible.4. The convoluted timeline with all of Bullock's flashbacks makes the movie a hard to follow.5. In the end, she still can't change the future despite knowing it, which has already been the subject of endless sci-fi stories and other movies. I would have tried to find a less predictable ending.6. The guy she meets at the lakeside seems to prefigure a future relationship with him, but when the flick ends suddenly there is no further hint of why that scene was included. This brief scene could have been edited out since it just seems to be a red herring.7. I agree with previous reviewer, baberufus, that Bullock's telling her husband to turn around right at the crest of the hill was just plain silly. She knows what's going to happen with the truck and should just have told him to get out of the car right away and off to the side of the road when the car stalled. But most importantly, she should have told him to just stay where he was in the first place and not turn around until the truck passed.Overall, though, a decent flick and thriller if you can manage to overlook a few gaffs, and the great Kate Nelligan has a good supporting role as Bullock's mother.",3,A brief comment,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,2257,"['overall', 'decent', 'movie', 'marred', 'unfortunate', 'flaws', 'mostly', 'relating', 'plot', 'plausibility', 'consistency', 'Well', 'acted', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'Bullock', 'McMahon', 'nicely', 'paced', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'several', 'problems.I', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'many', 'problems', 'found', 'were:1', 'Mother', 'daughter', 'committed', 'when', 'obvious', 'not', 'responsible', 'cuts', 'child', 'face', 'when', 'accidently', 'ran', 'plate', 'glass', 'door', 'just', ""n't"", 'explained', 'contrary', 'facts', 'presented', 'movie.2', 'scene', 'priest', 'where', 'try', 'explain', 'visions', 'sort', 'spiritual', 'uprootedness', 'just', 'plain', 'hokey', 'Movie', 'thrillers', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'place', 'metaphysical', 'theological', 'speculation.3', 'menacing', 'psychiatrist', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'prescribing', 'Lithium', 'first', 'visit', 'drug', 'normally', 'used', 'depression', 'not', 'stress', 'unsympathetic', 'psychiatrist', 'certainly', 'overall', 'stress', 'factor', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'credible.4', 'convoluted', 'timeline', 'Bullock', 'flashbacks', 'movie', 'hard', 'follow.5', 'end', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'future', 'knowing', 'already', 'been', 'subject', 'endless', 'sci-fi', 'stories', 'other', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'tried', 'find', 'less', 'predictable', 'ending.6', 'guy', 'lakeside', 'prefigure', 'future', 'relationship', 'when', 'flick', 'suddenly', 'further', 'hint', 'why', 'scene', 'was', 'included', 'brief', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'just', 'be', 'red', 'herring.7', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'baberufus', 'Bullock', 'telling', 'husband', 'turn', 'around', 'right', 'crest', 'hill', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'truck', 'should', 'just', 'have', 'told', 'get', 'car', 'right', 'away', 'side', 'road', 'when', 'car', 'stalled', 'most', 'importantly', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'just', 'stay', 'where', 'was', 'first', 'place', 'not', 'turn', 'around', 'truck', 'passed.Overall', 'though', 'decent', 'flick', 'thriller', 'can', 'manage', 'overlook', 'few', 'gaffs', 'great', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'good', 'supporting', 'role', 'Bullock', 'mother']",Premonition

But instead maybe I had a dream I watched the film, but won't actually watch it until Wednesday night.  In any case, blame it on the roses, blame it on the wind but I'm not sure I completely followed what all was going on.  Spoilers ahoy.  Read on if you've already seen the movie.As far as I can gather, there seem to have been multiple possible histories competing with one another for actuality.  In one possible history, Sandra Bullock is estranged from her husband and they have a crumbling loveless marriage, though he does wind up falling all over himself to give her some head.In another possible history, which seems not actually to have occurred, a sinister psychiatrist is drugging Bullock with... Lithium?  Did the screenwriter research this at all?  Lithium is not an antipsychotic, nor is it very widely prescribed for people whose heads are coming apart so bad they don't know whether they're Hall or Oates.  But Lithium, nevertheless, is most sinisterly prescribed.  I think the same shrink may have sinisterly suggested magnesium supplements as well, in a vaguely suspicious barely concealed French-Canadian accent no less.  Ah well.  But it was not to be, apparently.  Nor was it quite to be that Bullock gets popped into the loony bin for slicing her daughter's face up.However the film-makers do at least supply a blooper reel featuring an assortment of mystics culled from the north of Britain (""I sez to me Harry, I sez, Don't let's tonight... it gives me a rum go.  An' that seam night the pub caeved in on isself, teakin' the souls of thirty football supporters down wi' er.""; ""Yar... I seen 'im: the Loch Ness Monster, sure as'm standin' 'ere!""; ""I seen the trein go off the rails, real bloody-like, joos like it duz in me bleedin' paintin's."")But getting back to the movie, in the end, it does seem to have seemingly come to pass that hubby gets a bionic haircut from a jack-knifing gasoline truck... though one can't be fully sure this really happened.  After all, the movie in its entirety could have been a bad dream that the viewer... I mean Bullock, yes, Bullock, had and was now in the process of being disabused of as she walks out of the theater... I mean prepares to sell the house her husband bought with that raise he got for being promoted at whatever company he worked for selling whatever it was he sold.

In my eyes, she can do no wrong - apart from in the very beginning, when she was a struggling actress. Fire On The Amazon anybody? And also, Julian McMahon, more known to me as Cole from Charmed stars in it. He also gets wet in a shower. Woohoo!!!But the film was just not that good. I saw the ending coming. (What's so wrong with a Hollywood ending now and again?) I disagree with some other reviewers though, who's mentioned the finale was sloppy etc. I LOVED the ending, for me quite possibly the best part of the movie. (For all you cynics out there, not just because it was nearly over!) It was a nailbiting finale, but the right thing in the end happened.The whole plot was quite dodgy, and to anyone who quite simply can't keep track of time, it's all over the place. You have to pay attention, just to find out what day you're on, and whether Julian McMahon is actually alive or dead in this sequence. The whole affair subplot (he didn't, but he was going to, which was glaringly obvious) didn't quite fit in. He was going to cheat, he was considering cheating, isn't it the whole point that she should have kicked his butt out the door anyway? Never mind ran him over herself! And the object of his affections, is as usual, blonde, busty, young, pert, etc.The supporting cast are not worth my time mentioning, and Sandy & Julian are desperately trying to hold the film together, and apart from a really tender scene in the shower (Sandy fully clothed unfortunately for all her male fans), which did bring a tear to the eye, there's not much of a connection or chemistry between the pair of actors. Dare I say it, after seeing him in five seasons of Charmed, Julian is actually sleepwalking through the role.Over all, an interesting movie, if you're interested in premonitions etc, but messily put together and dire extras.

Both films dealt with time travel to some degree and centered around preventing a death.  This movie doesn't quite measure up to the other film.It takes place over a week, however the days occur out of sequence.  Sandra Bullock goes to sleep with a seemingly happy family of two girls and a husband.  She wakes up to find that her husband died during an out of town trip that she doesn't remember.  She then goes to sleep and wakes up to find that her husband is still alive and the days seem to be out of sequence.  Her husband's death apparently occurred on Wednesday and each time Bullock awakes it is first a day later in the week from Wednesday then a day earlier in the week than Wednesday.When Bullock starts piecing together what is going on with her, she has to decide if she wants to do nothing to prevent her husband from dieing or let things take her course (she learns that he may have been cheating on her).When all is resolved, the viewer is shaking their head, specifically at Bullocks non-attempt to alter even the smallest thing (she finds a torn out page from the Yellow Pages in a trash can and when she goes back in time she realizes that she is throwing the same page into the trash can.

The opportunity is wasted though, as plot logic flies through the window, along with our suspension of belief.  Apart from a brief chat with a priest, no explanation is given as to how this premonition happens, or why it would happen to her.  The plot therefore leads you on with the hook of `will she make it?' in a ticking clock sort of way, before fizzling out into a stock-heartwarming message about how we approach life being as important as death etc etc.  Not that it's a bad message, but the movie just does not decide which way it is going until the end... and it is too late to rescue an audiences involvement.On the plus side, music is good - both suspenseful and melancholic by turns, and the acting across the board is good - with the exception perhaps of the husband, who fails to convince us of being the man that would hold Bullock's devotion the way he does.Not a complete disaster, but neither is it worthy of a recommendation - for Bullock completists only.",2,A mediocre movie in search of a genre - and failing to find one.,1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,1452,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'great', 'performance', 'confused', 'conflicted', 'women', 'unsure', 'reality', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'channelling', 'how', 'felt', 'being', 'movie', 'script', 'entirely', 'undeserving', 'attentions.Not', 'completely', 'merit', 'concept', 'woman', 'who', 'days', 'week', 'order', 'giving', 'first', 'chance', 'know', 'husband', 'going', 'die', 'then', 'perhaps', 'chance', 'change', 'quite', 'good', 'one', 'opportunity', 'wasted', 'though', 'plot', 'logic', 'flies', 'window', 'suspension', 'belief', 'Apart', 'brief', 'chat', 'priest', 'explanation', 'given', 'how', 'premonition', 'why', 'would', 'happen', 'plot', 'therefore', 'hook', 'will', 'make', 'ticking', 'clock', 'sort', 'way', 'fizzling', 'out', 'stock-heartwarming', 'message', 'how', 'approach', 'life', 'being', 'as', 'important', 'death', 'etc', 'etc', 'Not', 'bad', 'message', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'decide', 'way', 'going', 'end', 'too', 'late', 'rescue', 'audiences', 'involvement.On', 'plus', 'side', 'music', 'good', 'suspenseful', 'melancholic', 'turns', 'acting', 'board', 'good', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'husband', 'who', 'convince', 'being', 'man', 'would', 'hold', 'Bullock', 'devotion', 'way', 'complete', 'disaster', 'worthy', 'recommendation', 'Bullock', 'only']",Premonition

1076115,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B000QGDY06,Poor Napoleon,"[25, 27]","There is a skit in the animated program Robot Chicken where a caricature of M. Night Shaymalyn keeps shouting ""what a twist"" when we see little parodies of his films.  This is a poignant piece because it hints at one of the major problems in a post 6th Sense Hollywood, where filmakers feel they can woo in audiences with surprise endings and twists and turns throughout the story.In films like the 6th Sense, such a device is good.  But that was a carefully laid twist that didn't confuse filmgoers and the director carefully gave you little snippets of the clues that led to the conclusion.  It's an easy to digest 'twist.'  It does not work in a film like Premonition, where the twists and turns contradict logic and further confuse filmgoers.Premonition begins where Bullock plays a happily homebound housewife who has two children.  She takes the children to school, goes about her daily chores, listens to a voice message from her husband (where plot holes begin - I'll get to that later), and then receives the disturbing news that her husband is dead.  Next day, surprise, he's alive - it must have all been a dream because he's alive and it's a few days before the accident.  Next day (for Bullock's character anyway), it's the funeral, oh and there's a really unintentionally funny scene where she attempts to check out the casket!  Well it ends up being a lot of going back and forth and the filmakers allude that some of the things that occur must be real, but wait, if this was true, then that first day her daughter should've had scars..and didn't she end up going to a mental institution....does this sound confusing to you?  It's how the film operates.  And no - none of it makes sense.Films dealing with time travel or telling the future in any sort of way must set up rules that the audience can follow - or at least let us in on any known incosistencies ala Back to the Future.  This film does neither and leaves the audience wondering ""huh?""  To further muddy the waters, this film has a number of unresolved subplots, including an aformenetioned scene involving her losing her children and getting commited and an alleged affair her husband may have been having.  As for the plot holes (Here be a spoiler), listen closely to the phone call from the husband in the beginning and hear it repeated towards the end.  Something's wrong.This film is not recommended.  I swear I have never been more upset and infuriated after watching a movie.  I don't normally rant on films like this, but films of this low quality, robbed of any logic should be avoided.  If the film is recut into some Lifetime movie or even further into a twilight zone episode, it might have some value.

This phenomenon is never fully explained, only hinted at, and that one fact left me somewhat disappointed.However, once you get to the end of the movie and realize it's message, that one element lacking explanation doesn't really seem to matter. The movie has a beautiful message and that message is; every day of life that we have is a miracle.Bullock delivers an excellent performance, as usual, and it was nice to see Julian McMahon portray a character who was actually a decent (if not troubled and confused) man rather than the megalomaniacal jerks he usually plays (such as his role in Nip/Tuck and Fantastic Four).I enjoyed this film very much as did my wife. The picture and sound quality are both well-done. We especially enjoyed the gag reel after the film was over.

Every time she lies down to go to sleep, when she awakens, she is in a different reality.  Sometimes her husband is alive again when she wakes up; sometimes he is dead.  I think I get the idea of what the movie was trying to convey, but it was done rather poorly and with enough plot holes to drive a semi through.  In her various new realities, she mends fences, ties loose ends and by the end of the movie, what happens is really not a surprise at all.  The problem is, many things are never explained.  For example, once she was committed to an asylum by her psychiatrist (in the dead-husband reality), why did she never again ""wake up"" in that reality?  There was nothing she did in the ""alive-husband"" reality to prevent her going down the road of being committed.  If I were her, actually, I would have resorted to some of the tactics in the old Nightmare on Elm Street movies, where everyone was afraid to go to sleep.  After all, every time she lay down to go to sleep, she never knew what reality she was going to wake up into.Overall, I found the movie interesting, but annoying because of all of the plot gaps.

When is someone going to write a time-travel movie that makes sense? ""The Butterfly Effect"" was far more interesting and more cleanly written and required a little thought on the part of the viewer and *that's* what made it compelling and intriguing and thought-provoking.My eldest daughter and I were watching Premonition when I explained how I thought the writers would explain the time travel aspect and she replied, ""Mom, that's brilliant, but I don't think this movie is even going to visit the land we call 'brilliant'"".And she was right. There's no explanation for the mix-up in ""Linda's"" days and no effort to bring a little science into the picture. When Linda feels like she's truly at the end of her rope, she visits the neighborhood priest who tells Linda about a 17th Century woman who had a premonition of a massive storm and was later burned at the stake for being a witch. Huh? All the great stories in the world about people who have jumped around in time and that's all Father Suburban could offer her?Einstein stated that, the past, present and future are only an illusion, however persistent. So, perhaps this little thing we call time is not really linear (with a past, a now and a future), but that's the way our little brains are designed to interpret it. Perhaps Linda catches a glimpse through the human illusion we call time and sees that time is *not* linear and perhaps she sees, for a moment, that time is *not* moving forward at one speed and one speed only. Perhaps that could explain the mystery and mystique of her experiences.But this soppy, sappy and sloppy film never even dips a toe in the murky (yet fascinating) waters of quantum physics.Save yourself two hours and watch the trailer.

Schultz,"[2, 4]","""Premonition"" in some ways struck me as a more modern, more action-packed version of Thornton Wilder's perennial school drama class favorite ""Our Town."" In Wilder's classic, life is recapitulated and lived out of order as the result of a feverish dream.In this drama, there is greater mystery and urgency attached to the protagonist's disordered experience of her life. We don't learn what causes the shuffling of days here.  Sandra Bullock's life inexplicably jumps ahead to a day when she is informed of her husband's death in a fiery car crash. When she is backtracked, she must race to see if she can avert the disaster.Whether she can or not though, she is given a different perspective on her life. She is jerked out of the train of petty household grievance and is allowed to see the bigger picture of her relationship with her husband and family. Through the jolts of these changing gears, she's awakened, sometimes to a greater appreciation of the good, sometimes to a greater understanding of the bad, in her daily interactions. While we are usually told that the secret to living a happy life is to live fully in the ""now,"" this movie might incidentally make a case for being able to live our days as a spill of Scrabble on the table - where we have to search out the possible anagrams ourselves. Through the effort required in that back and forth and lack of linearity, there might actually emerge a greater clarity about what's truly of value in our lives.This movie is not a sermon on how to live happily though.

1076129,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B000QGDY06,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[2, 3]","I see plot holes sinking this ship!Premonition is about a woman, Linda (somewhat believably played by Sandra Bullock) who in some mysterious way is living out another time period where her husband dies about two weeks later.What gets me about Linda is how it takes her so darn long to figure out what is happening.  For example, she sees a bottle of lithium that was dumped down the drain in her sink and has no idea how it got there.  She looks at the bottle and it has a doctor's name on it, Dr. Roth.  Then later, when she falls asleep she reawakens in her new world, looks up Dr. Roth whom she has not met yet.  She tries to explain what's happening to her, where she believes her husband is dead but he's not really dead.  Dr. Roth thinks she's nuts and gives her a bottle of lithium.  Later in the day, she dumps it in the bathroom sink.Does she say to herself, ""Wow, that's just like in my earlier dream!"" Or say ""Maybe since I've reliving this before I will see what I can do to change it.""  Nope, no clue.  The audience (me) is frustrated that Linda is not figuring out any of this.The characters are very cardboard.  Her mom, for example, has her committed to Dr. Roth's care because of something that happened to one of her children (we don't yet know why at this point).  No real explanation other than implying Linda somehow was responsible for her daughter being cut up.  Later in the tale, when she relives the earlier time (yeah, confusing, and convoluted) her daughter goes through a plate glass window.Now, why would her mother call the psychs to lock up Linda if Linda had nothing to do with her daughter getting cut up.  Don't get it.Oh wait, gets better!Linda finally figures out (she's pretty slow) that she's reliving some other time.  She makes a calendar of sorts and starts to figure out what's going on, without telling her mom because of her predilection for locking up daughters in mental hospitals.Another throw-away scene tries to explain what's going on.  A priest she visits (not sure who or why) opens a book (which is not explained where he got it) that goes over people reliving other times and see them as warnings.  He then goes over how some people can't change this because ""nature abhors a vacuum"" and that if you don't have faith or love then you are doomed to your fate.OK, fine.  She takes this to heart.  She tries to love her husband and children more.  She tries really hard.  And then [SPOILER] the thing that she fears happens anyway, DESPITE her efforts!  Inexorable fate.  Can't change it, despite faith and hope.  Yuk!  [END SPOILER]Sandra Bullock walks through her part, a bit clueless and has a cheating husband on her hands who is also clueless.The script does not have that neat Hollywood polish of a happy ending which, frankly it really needed!Like Clooney's ""Perfect Storm"", you love the characters and yet they meet their end anyway.  The film makes you feel empty and lifeless.  Not suicidal, but almost.There are much, much better Bullock movies.

1076133,A3E8Y4OW8IFFDX,B000QGDY06,S. P. Miskowski,"[4, 6]","Directed by Mennan YapoWritten by Bill KellyLinda and Jim lead a perfect life. They live in an impossibly pretty house in the quietest and most picturesque suburb ever invented by Hollywood. They have two adorable daughters. And somehow Jim earns enough money to allow Linda a full-time mommy career without money worries.The film begins with a tragedy. Linda wakes up and goes about her daily routine, expecting Jim to return from his latest business trip later in the day. She is stunned when a police officer knocks at her door and announces that her husband has been killed in an auto accident.Linda copes, mainly by giving in to shock. She breaks the terrible news to her kids and asks her mother to stay with the family for a while. Tentatively, the women begin to talk about funeral plans.The next day Linda wakes up, and cannot find her mother in the house. She goes to the kitchen and finds her husband drinking coffee, preparing for his business trip.From this point on, the film unfolds in a series of events and possibilities. With each possibility, Linda must re-evaluate her feelings about her husband, the state of their marriage, and the kind of person she is. All of this plays a vital part in unraveling the mystery of her premonition or apprehension of her husband's impending accident. With each step, Linda feels more certain that she can change what is to be. But does she want to?The producers of Premonition would be justified in wondering why their stab at the New Hollywood Quasi-Horror Genre was not a chart-busting hit. After all, they built in all the requisites:* likable star (Bullock)* a fixable family conflict* something spooky messin' w/ likable star's mind* complex narrative structure to impress viewers who can't follow it and flatter those who can* big and accessible message about LifeUnfortunately this story is a bit too clever for its own good. But it isn't ruined by cleverness. It is ruined by sentiment. Cut the unintentionally hilarious funeral scene, a heavy dose of religion supplemented by a family vitamin, and a moment near the end in which Sandra Bullock shouts a phrase one too many times while barreling down the street, limbs Dave Attell-style-akimbo in fuzzy robe and slippers--and this thing might have worked.But the producers didn't cut these things. Which means they didn't find them as funny as they obviously are. And when you don't know that your operatic funeral scene is guaranteed to elicit belly laughs, you probably shouldn't be dabbling in the New Hollywood Quasi-Horror Genre. Because this kind of film flies or dies on the ability of its creators to recognize humor when it slaps them on the back of the head.In this regard the creators of Premonition don't seem to have a clue. Their story is so dour, and Linda is so sad, and the kids are so good and precious, and the setting is so perfect, it's borderline daytime TV material. There are no truly ironic or sardonic moments in the script. The characters don't share anything offbeat or charming that might win us over and make us want them to stay together. They're a typical, slightly disillusioned couple with no quirks or aspirations.At one point the story seems about to get darker and weirder, when Linda appears to be responsible for a child's injury. But this line isn't pursued very far, and we're soon returned to the land of the impossibly pretty suburb of dreams.

Wilson ""Author: Animal Movies Guide ...","[15, 24]","I was one of the few critics who actually enjoyed Sandra Bullock's last time travel film,The Lake House (Widescreen Edition). That one was a romance in the vein ofSomewhere in Time (Collector's Edition), while Premonition is a thriller more along the lines ofThe Forgotten.Unfortunately, Premonition is no better than The Forgotten (in fact, it has a lot fewer ""scares"") and uses the same loco logic at the end to explain the terrifying time warp (terrifying for Bullock's character, if not the audience).The story follows happy housewife Linda Hansen and her hunky hubby Jim (Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon) in their trip through time, following -- and previous to -- Jim's death in a fiery car wreck. Since Linda is the only one aware that the weekdays are all out of order and sometimes repeating themselves with different outcomes, everyone else around her just thinks she's a raving nut-job.Linda is... sort of cosmically... sent to a psychiatrist (Peter Storemare... c'mon... who'd accept a prescription from that guy?) and put on anti-psychotics. Needless to say, that doesn't help and Linda finds herself jumping all over the calendar again. Unfortunately for loopy Linda, going back and forth in time is hardly helpful -- she's unable to remember what's happened in those alternate realities and is therefore powerless to stop the inevitable.While there is interesting cinematography and jarring sound design, no amount of visual and aural accoutrements can disguise the fact that not only is Linda's life boring, but so is she. No wonder Jim goes on so many business trips (and we all know what that means!).The only person who seems to understand what Linda is going through is her priest, who conveniently has several appropriate pages of the Bible bookmarked for her unheralded arrival -- but instead of support, Linda gets a spiritual upbraiding and is sent on her way, answerless.The same could be said for the audience, many of whom will no doubt exit the theater scratching their heads and cancelling their subscriptions to Christianity Today. Premonition is so bad, there's even a scene mirroring the time when the old nighttime soap Dallas jumped the shark with Bobby Ewing in the shower!

She gets fine support by all in this film including a subtle Julian (""I have weird eyebrows"") McMahon (Fantastic Four) as her doomed husband, the ever gorgeous Nia Long (Are We There Yet?) as her best friend, and the always reliable and familar Kate Nelligan as her mom.  Even the children are better than most other child actors we see in films today.Sadly, all this good acting doesn't excuse the overly complicated script that both loses the audience at times with it's complexity and reveals itself to be quite predictable too.  That sounds like the perfect oxymoron at work.  The plot is different, even unique in some ways and for awhile the mystery is interesting if not even compelling, but once you get the idea of what is happening, everything falls into place too easily and the ending is anything but a surprise.I gave this film 3.5 stars for it's unique, but admittedly flawed, storyline which is, overall, entertaining, the terrifically compelling performance by Bullock, and the fine support of her co-stars.  I even have to give credit to the director for just an honest attempt at creating something different in this mind-bending, time-traveling little thriller.  I also think it is noteworthy that at the heart of this story is a woman who no longer knows what is important in her life that is worth fighting for and a marriage that is perhaps all too typical in our society today where we take others for granted and whine about the mundane aspects that fill all our lives.",3,"3.5 Stars: Better than expected, but . . .",1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,1640,"['tour-de-force', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'entire', 'complex', 'convoluted', 'film', 'together', 'serious', 'help', 'fine', 'support', 'film', 'including', 'subtle', 'Julian', 'have', 'weird', 'eyebrows', 'McMahon', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'doomed', 'husband', 'ever', 'gorgeous', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Are', 'Yet', 'best', 'friend', 'always', 'reliable', 'familar', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'mom', 'Even', 'children', 'are', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'child', 'actors', 'see', 'films', 'today.Sadly', 'good', 'acting', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'overly', 'complicated', 'script', 'audience', 'times', 'complexity', 'reveals', 'be', 'quite', 'predictable', 'too', 'perfect', 'oxymoron', 'work', 'plot', 'different', 'even', 'unique', 'ways', 'mystery', 'interesting', 'not', 'even', 'compelling', 'once', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'happening', 'everything', 'falls', 'place', 'too', 'easily', 'ending', 'anything', 'surprise.I', 'gave', 'film', '3.5', 'stars', 'unique', 'admittedly', 'flawed', 'storyline', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'terrifically', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Bullock', 'fine', 'support', 'co-stars', 'even', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'director', 'just', 'honest', 'attempt', 'creating', 'something', 'different', 'mind-bending', 'time-traveling', 'little', 'thriller', 'also', 'think', 'noteworthy', 'heart', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'what', 'important', 'life', 'worth', 'fighting', 'marriage', 'perhaps', 'too', 'typical', 'society', 'today', 'where', 'take', 'others', 'granted', 'whine', 'mundane', 'fill', 'lives']",Premonition

Next, take the remaining chapters and scramble them into random order.  Now, serve this up on the big screen and expect your audience to be wildly enthusiastic.Ain't gonna happen -- Sandra Bullock notwithstanding.That, in a nutshell, is the experience of watching ""Premonition.""  The movie tries hard to be clever and thrilling, but just never quite rises to the ocassion.  Likewise, it tries to grapple with difficult issues like faith, God, death, and marital difficulties.  Tries, yes.  Succeeds, no.This is one movie where a number of alternate endings should have been shot and screened with audience focus groups.  Without giving away a spoiler, I can almost guarantee that what the director/screenwriter chose here is NOT the ending an audience would have chosen.For a thriller, this movie had a difficult time holding my interest.  I kept hoping that as the film progressed, things would make more sense.  Unfortunately, they never quite did and I had a very difficult time at the conclusion understanding which parts were actually real and which parts were simply ""what might have been.""  Frankly, it just was not possible for all that happened in the film over the course of a week to have actually happened in reality.No complaints about the acting, the sets, or any of the technical aspects of the movie.  Sandra Bullock is one of my favorites and she does a good job coming across as a midwestern soccer mom who is mildly depressed about her marriage.  And Julian McMahon is believable as the responsible, passionless (at least for his wife) Mister Bland (although you do find it a bit far-fetched that this guy would be tempted to stray with a beautiful, pleasant-demeanored Bullock waiting for him at home every night).But ultimately, the actors were asked to do the impossible: salvage a fundamentally chaotic and highly unsatisfying story line.Within the first 20 minutes I had a premonition that this wasn't going to be a very good movie.I was right.",2,Unsatisfying in every sense of the word,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,2076,"['Imagine', 'take', 'reasonably', 'good', 'book', 'remove', 'pivotal', 'chapter', 'everything', 'together', 'Next', 'take', 'remaining', 'chapters', 'scramble', 'random', 'order', 'Now', 'serve', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'expect', 'audience', 'be', 'wildly', 'enthusiastic.Ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'happen', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'notwithstanding.That', 'nutshell', 'experience', 'watching', 'Premonition', 'movie', 'hard', 'be', 'clever', 'thrilling', 'just', 'never', 'quite', 'ocassion', 'Likewise', 'grapple', 'difficult', 'issues', 'faith', 'God', 'death', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'Tries', 'yes', 'Succeeds', 'no.This', 'one', 'movie', 'where', 'number', 'alternate', 'endings', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'screened', 'audience', 'focus', 'groups', 'giving', 'away', 'spoiler', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'what', 'director/screenwriter', 'chose', 'here', 'NOT', 'ending', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'chosen.For', 'thriller', 'movie', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'holding', 'interest', 'kept', 'hoping', 'film', 'progressed', 'things', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'quite', 'did', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'conclusion', 'understanding', 'parts', 'were', 'actually', 'real', 'parts', 'were', 'simply', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Frankly', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'possible', 'happened', 'film', 'course', 'week', 'have', 'actually', 'happened', 'reality.No', 'complaints', 'acting', 'sets', 'technical', 'aspects', 'movie', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'one', 'favorites', 'good', 'job', 'coming', 'midwestern', 'soccer', 'mom', 'who', 'mildly', 'depressed', 'marriage', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'believable', 'responsible', 'passionless', 'least', 'wife', 'Mister', 'Bland', 'do', 'find', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'guy', 'would', 'be', 'tempted', 'stray', 'beautiful', 'pleasant-demeanored', 'Bullock', 'waiting', 'home', 'night', 'ultimately', 'actors', 'were', 'asked', 'do', 'impossible', 'salvage', 'fundamentally', 'chaotic', 'highly', 'unsatisfying', 'story', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'had', 'premonition', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie.I', 'was', 'right']",Premonition

1076142,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000QGDY06,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[6, 7]","The latest in a string of Sandra Bullock mystery thrillers, Premonition is a jumbled mess of unexplained time travel and its consequent inconsistencies, and while not wholly lacking in entertainment value, does raise more questions than it answers - questions like ""Why is this happening to her again?"" and ""Why can't she change things?"" and possibly ""What made me watch this movie in the first place?""Jokes aside, on first viewing of this latest addition to the time-traveling suspense film, one has to wonder about the numerous loose ends, plot holes, and disturbingly unsatisfactory resolution. I suppose the film didn't necessarily want the viewer to delve too deep into its mysteries, but the explanation ""some things can't be explained"" only works when the main plot doesn't depend on any reasons. Unfortunately Premonition does and we're left holding the bag - without knowing what's in it.Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) appears to have the ideal family life - a loving husband, two beautiful daughters, and a brand new house. But one day after receiving a bizarre phone call from her husband Jim (Julian McMahon) she is informed by a police officer that he has died in a car accident. Distraught and in disbelief, Linda attempts to carry out the rest of her day normally, but eventually cries herself to sleep that night. She awakens the next morning to discover Jim is alive and well - it was all just a bad dream. Or was it? Each day she awakens to a new nightmare of inconsistencies traveling back and forth in time and must uncover the terrifying events that lead up to her husband's tragic demise.The movie begins refreshingly enough with an adequate dose of confusion and disorientation as we learn of Linda's troubling plight. But soon it becomes apparent that the plot is in over its head and more disturbing than the events surrounding the protagonist is the inexplicable direction the film is heading. After each non-sequential day passes, more questions and inconsistencies are created - so many in fact that the audience will realize that there isn't sufficient time left in the two hour flick to resolve them all. So we are left with the inexcusable ""some things are unexplainable"" explanation which will likely cause more frustration than the inherent inevitability of Linda's predicament.Premonition attempts to be ominous - and succeeds at times - but with several cheap scares and random events that don't add up, appreciation will be lost for the truly foreboding sequences. When the police officer that informs Linda of her husband's death appears on a different day, one might think a conspiracy is in the works, but no, it's just another random occurrence thrown in to add more confusion to an already convoluted premise. Whenever time travel is introduced in a story so are questions about the nature of altering the past, present, and future, but Premonition relies on the audience accepting its fixed rules without pondering their plausibility. Before there can be a ""who,"" ""what,"" or ""where,"" there needs to be a ""why,"" but you won't find one here. The film ends prematurely without divulging any reason for its ""premonition"" and therefore accepting the apparent inevitability of its conclusion and Linda's wanton disregard for trying to change the future and preserve her seemingly perfect life may be disappointingly difficult to swallow.Though Bullock admirably tries to hold Mennan Yapo's thriller together, this Premonition becomes a little too much time travel and our belief can only be suspended so far before snapping from the weight of the impossibly unexplainable - it will leave you guessing until the very end, and unfortunately quite some time afterwards. While the film traverses seven days of one nightmarish week for Sandra, only about three of them made any sense, hence its score.- Joel Massie",2,Premonition Movie Review,1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,3844,"['latest', 'string', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'mystery', 'thrillers', 'Premonition', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'unexplained', 'time', 'travel', 'consequent', 'inconsistencies', 'not', 'wholly', 'lacking', 'entertainment', 'value', 'raise', 'more', 'questions', 'questions', 'Why', 'happening', 'again', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'things', 'possibly', 'What', 'made', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'Jokes', 'aside', 'first', 'viewing', 'latest', 'addition', 'time-traveling', 'suspense', 'film', 'one', 'wonder', 'numerous', 'loose', 'ends', 'plot', 'holes', 'disturbingly', 'unsatisfactory', 'resolution', 'suppose', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'want', 'viewer', 'delve', 'too', 'deep', 'mysteries', 'explanation', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'only', 'when', 'main', 'plot', ""n't"", 'depend', 'reasons', 'Unfortunately', 'Premonition', ""'re"", 'left', 'holding', 'bag', 'knowing', 'what', 'it.Linda', 'Hanson', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'have', 'ideal', 'family', 'life', 'loving', 'husband', 'two', 'beautiful', 'daughters', 'brand', 'new', 'house', 'one', 'day', 'receiving', 'bizarre', 'phone', 'call', 'husband', 'Jim', 'Julian', 'McMahon', 'informed', 'police', 'officer', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'Distraught', 'disbelief', 'Linda', 'carry', 'out', 'rest', 'day', 'normally', 'eventually', 'sleep', 'night', 'next', 'morning', 'discover', 'Jim', 'alive', 'well', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'dream', 'was', 'day', 'new', 'nightmare', 'inconsistencies', 'traveling', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'must', 'uncover', 'terrifying', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'husband', 'tragic', 'demise.The', 'movie', 'refreshingly', 'enough', 'adequate', 'dose', 'confusion', 'disorientation', 'learn', 'Linda', 'troubling', 'plight', 'soon', 'apparent', 'plot', 'head', 'more', 'disturbing', 'events', 'surrounding', 'protagonist', 'inexplicable', 'direction', 'film', 'heading', 'non-sequential', 'day', 'passes', 'more', 'questions', 'inconsistencies', 'are', 'created', 'so', 'many', 'fact', 'audience', 'will', 'realize', ""n't"", 'sufficient', 'time', 'left', 'two', 'hour', 'flick', 'resolve', 'are', 'left', 'inexcusable', 'things', 'are', 'unexplainable', 'explanation', 'will', 'likely', 'cause', 'more', 'frustration', 'inherent', 'inevitability', 'Linda', 'predicament.Premonition', 'attempts', 'be', 'ominous', 'times', 'several', 'cheap', 'scares', 'random', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'appreciation', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'truly', 'foreboding', 'sequences', 'When', 'police', 'officer', 'Linda', 'husband', 'death', 'different', 'day', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'conspiracy', 'works', 'just', 'random', 'occurrence', 'thrown', 'add', 'more', 'confusion', 'already', 'convoluted', 'premise', 'Whenever', 'time', 'travel', 'introduced', 'story', 'so', 'are', 'questions', 'nature', 'altering', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'Premonition', 'relies', 'audience', 'accepting', 'fixed', 'rules', 'pondering', 'plausibility', 'can', 'be', 'who', 'what', 'where', 'there', 'be', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', 'here', 'film', 'prematurely', 'divulging', 'reason', 'premonition', 'therefore', 'accepting', 'apparent', 'inevitability', 'conclusion', 'Linda', 'wanton', 'disregard', 'trying', 'change', 'future', 'preserve', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'disappointingly', 'difficult', 'swallow.Though', 'Bullock', 'admirably', 'hold', 'Mennan', 'Yapo', 'thriller', 'together', 'Premonition', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'travel', 'belief', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'suspended', 'so', 'far', 'snapping', 'weight', 'impossibly', 'unexplainable', 'will', 'leave', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'unfortunately', 'quite', 'time', 'afterwards', 'film', 'traverses', 'seven', 'days', 'one', 'nightmarish', 'week', 'Sandra', 'only', 'three', 'made', 'sense', 'hence', 'score.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",Premonition

One day, after receiving terrible news about her husband Jim (Julian McMahon), she starts to have promotion - or I should say, she begins to experience things in ""un-chronological"" order.I know my review is vague, but this is all that I can say without giving away the major plot elements. But I can add these yet: 1) Sandra Bullock is quite convincing as the tormented heroine, whose uncanny ability might or might not change the course of events. Most viewers would be impressed with her solid performance. 2) The material itself is fascinating, but the execution is ineffective with implausible situations and unlikely (even stupid) decisions by the characters. 3) Perhaps this is the most important. Her premonition (or whatever it is) looks convoluted, but the film's plot itself is fairly predictable. When Amber Valletta appears in one scene, most of you will instantly detect the identity of her character.But what is really annoying is the attempt of the filmmakers trying hard to make the film profound when it is not. Director Mennan Yapo tries to give the film dramatic tension by introducing some elements - psychiatrist and priest - but they not only hit the wrong note, but confuse the already complicated story of the main character Linda. To make matters worse, supports are almost insignificant.

It is  ameteurish, unnecessry in most scenes and overly loud (silence would have been scarier). The whole movie would have had a better atmosphere without the confusing noises being constantly there. I thought the story was interesting but lost its way. It could have been quite spooky but the confusion aided by the soundtrack just let it drift a bit.",3,Interesting,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,410,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'down', 'ameteurish', 'unnecessry', 'most', 'scenes', 'overly', 'loud', 'silence', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'scarier', 'whole', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'atmosphere', 'confusing', 'noises', 'being', 'constantly', 'there', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'lost', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'spooky', 'confusion', 'aided', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'let', 'drift', 'bit']",Premonition

At the end, I decided to watch it again like was the case of ""The Sixth Sense"" and other movies because maybe I missed something.It reminded me of a very old episode of the TV series ""Ghost Story"" that featured a woman (Carolyn Jones) who relived over and over a time when she killed her husband, but you never knew if she did it yet or not.  I think that is where the writer got the idea for this movie--only the Ghost Story episode was much better.I noticed the bong noise at intervals between scenes which may be indications that she was either going back to reality or back to the Twilight Zone.  It was hard to discern this and made me think that there were critical cuts made in the movie that fractured the storyline.  The overuse of fading to white (which is normally used to indicate death in film) also made it more confusing.It was very difficult to keep up with the ""premonition"" and the real world in this film.  Although very well acted and very strange, I thought the audience deserved a better ending.  I'm thinking of getting the DVD just to see if there are any extras that explain the mystery of this movie as was done with ""The Sixth Sense.""I give the actors and actresses a high score, but the editing ruined this movie.  I think whatever was left on the cutting-room floor should be put back in unless it is worse than what the audience got to see.",3,When Did It Finally End?,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,1518,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'DVD/Comcast', 'OnDemand', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'became', 'more', 'puzzled', 'ever', 'end', 'decided', 'watch', 'again', 'was', 'case', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'other', 'movies', 'maybe', 'missed', 'something.It', 'reminded', 'very', 'old', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'featured', 'woman', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'who', 'relived', 'over', 'time', 'when', 'killed', 'husband', 'never', 'knew', 'did', 'yet', 'not', 'think', 'where', 'writer', 'got', 'idea', 'movie', 'only', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'episode', 'was', 'much', 'better.I', 'noticed', 'bong', 'noise', 'intervals', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'indications', 'was', 'either', 'going', 'back', 'reality', 'back', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'was', 'hard', 'discern', 'made', 'think', 'were', 'critical', 'cuts', 'made', 'movie', 'fractured', 'storyline', 'overuse', 'fading', 'white', 'normally', 'used', 'indicate', 'death', 'film', 'also', 'made', 'more', 'confusing.It', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'premonition', 'real', 'world', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'very', 'strange', 'thought', 'audience', 'deserved', 'better', 'ending', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'getting', 'DVD', 'just', 'see', 'are', 'extras', 'explain', 'mystery', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'give', 'actors', 'high', 'score', 'editing', 'ruined', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'left', 'cutting-room', 'floor', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'back', 'worse', 'what', 'audience', 'got', 'see']",Premonition
