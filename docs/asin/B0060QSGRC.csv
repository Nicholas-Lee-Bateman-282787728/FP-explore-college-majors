I also have the Blu-ray of the highly regarded 2006 revival of Company.  The failure of any of those videos to have closed captions, however, has made me vow never to buy another one that doesn't have them.  Apparently the Memphis Blu-ray  is visually stunning and comes with a fine DTS-HD MA audiotrack but it also lacks closed captions.  That ended the inquiry for me, I won't be buying it.Nearly all Broadway musicals are packed with intricate lyrics, which it's important to fully understand to fully appreciate the story that is being told.  Also, Broadway performers are not noted for having uniformly perfect diction.  Despite having good hearing, I think it is nearly impossible to fully understand the lyrics in a musical theater piece without captions.  CAVEAT:  For those of you who are not insistent as I am about fully understanding lyrics, the Memphis Blu-ray would probably be a great buy for you.  That's why I rated the Blu-ray at 4 Stars out of 5 sight unseen.  Enjoy it, I'm just sorry that I can't.",4,"No closed captions, a disqualifying defect",1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,1150,"['never', 'met', 'musical', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Memphis', 'Musical', 'own', 'videos', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'shows', 'also', 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'highly', 'regarded', '2006', 'revival', 'Company', 'failure', 'videos', 'have', 'closed', 'captions', 'however', 'made', 'vow', 'never', 'buy', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'Apparently', 'Memphis', 'Blu-ray', 'visually', 'stunning', 'fine', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', 'audiotrack', 'also', 'closed', 'captions', 'ended', 'inquiry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'it.Nearly', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'are', 'packed', 'intricate', 'lyrics', 'important', 'fully', 'understand', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'Also', 'Broadway', 'performers', 'are', 'not', 'noted', 'having', 'uniformly', 'perfect', 'diction', 'having', 'good', 'hearing', 'think', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'fully', 'understand', 'lyrics', 'musical', 'theater', 'piece', 'captions', 'CAVEAT', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'insistent', 'am', 'fully', 'understanding', 'lyrics', 'Memphis', 'Blu-ray', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'great', 'buy', 'why', 'rated', 'Blu-ray', '4', 'Stars', '5', 'sight', 'unseen', 'Enjoy', ""'m"", 'just', 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't""]",N/A
