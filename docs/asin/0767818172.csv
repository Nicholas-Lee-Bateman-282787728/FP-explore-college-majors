14670,AGEIT17HENDIS,0767818172,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","Okay, we will cut to the chase on the plot. Old Johnny (Marlon Brando) and his fellow ""outlaw"" motorcycle club members are out for some weekend ""kicks"" after a hard week's non-work (as far as we can figure out, work was marginal for many reasons, as Hunter Thompson in Hell's Angels noted, to biker existence, the pursue of jack-rolling, armed robbery or grand theft auto careers probably running a little ahead) out in the sunny California small town hinterlands.(They are still heading out there today, the last time I noticed, in the Southern California high desert, places like Twenty-nine Palms and Joshua Tree.)And naturally, when the boys (and they are all boys here, except  for couple of ""mamas"", one spurned by Johnny, in a break-away club led by jack-in-the-box jokester, Lee Marvin as Chino) hit one small town they, naturally, after sizing up the local law, head for the local caf&eacute; (and bar). And once one mentions cafes in small towns in California (or Larry McMurtry's West Texas, for that matter), then hard-working, trying to make it through the shift, got to get out of this small town and see the world, dreamy-eyed, nave (yes, naive) sheriff-daughtered young waitress, Kathy, (yes, and hard-working, its tough dealing them off the arm in these kind of joints, or elsewhere) Johnny trap comes into play. Okay, now you know, even alienated, misunderstood, misanthropic, cop-hating (an additional obstacle given said waitress's kinships) boy Johnny needs, needs cinematically at least, to meet a girl who understands him.The development of that young hope, although hopeless, boy meets girl romance relationship, hither and yon, drives the plot. Natch. Oh, and along the way the boys, after a few thousand beers, as boys, especially girl-starved biker boys, will at the drop of a hat start to systematically tear down the town, off-handedly, for fun. Needless to say, staid local burghers (aka ""squares"") seeing what amount to them is their worst 1950s ""communist"" invasion nightmare, complete with murder, mayhem and rapine, (although that ""C"" word was not used in the film, nor should it have been) are determined to ""take back"" their little town. A few fights, forages, fatalities, and forgivenesses later though, still smitten but unquenched and chaste Johnny (and his rowdy crowd) and said waitress part, wistfully. The lesson here, for the kids in the theater audience, is that biker love outside bikerdom is doomed.  For the adults the lesson: nip the ""terrorists"" in the bud (call in the state cops, the national guard, the militia, the 82nd Airborne, The Strategic Air Command,  NATO, hell, the Red Army, but nip it, fast when they come roaming through Amityville, Archer City, or your small town).After that summary you can see what we are up against. This is pure fantasy Hollywood cautionary tale on a very real 1950s phenomena, ""outlaw"" biker clubs, mainly in California, but elsewhere as well.  Hunter Thompson did yeoman's work in his Hell's Angels to ""discover"" who these guys were and what drove them, beyond drugs, sex, rock and roll (and, ya, murder and mayhem, the California prison system was a ""home away from home""). In a sense the ""bikers"" were the obverse of the boys (again, mainly) who Tom Wolfe, in many of his early essays, was writing about and who were (a) forming the core of the surfers on the beaches from  Malibu to La Jolla and, (b) driving the  custom car/hot rod/drive-in centered (later mall-centered) cool, teenage girl-impressing, car craze night in the immediate post-World War II great American Western sunny skies and pleasant dream drift (physically and culturally). Except those Wolfe guys were the ""winners"". The ""bikers"" were Nelson Algren's ""losers"", the dead-enders who didn't hit the gold rush, the Dove Linkhorns (aka the Arkies and Okies who in the 1930s populated John Steinbeck's Joad saga, The Grapes Of Wrath).

Marlon Brando is the leader, and although he depicts the classic young rebel without a cause, there's a softness about him around the edges (maybe it's that smooth baby-skin face of his).In fact, there's a softness about the whole movie: the gang produces a feeling of loathing but not because they're especially dangerous - just dumb. The daughter of the town sheriff falls for Brando, but this too seems unconvincing (like oil and water trying to mix) - and she and her father help Brando out of a jam at the end. Nineteen-twenties crooner Jay C. Flippen plays the sheriff - too bad he doesn't sing a couple of choruses of ""Short and Sweet"" to add to the proceedings.Based on a true story, the movie was a trend setter for subsequent pictures about rebellious youth (some segments of society thought movies like this one were signaling the end of civilization just about), but there seems to be a blanket thrown over everything.

No im wrong I do like it I just dont know if I love it.The film is about a lovely little group of buggerlugs who decide to run a muck in a small town, and thats it. What makes it a bit special is that there is a sparkly allagiorical treat hidden away ( it was a fifties film ) and it has Brando in it.The film allows you to decide who are the villans of the tale, the gang or the towns people. The bikers are thankfully represented in an aimiable light when contrasted with the lynch mob of towns people, who decide to go against the law to rid their town of the invading scallywags, and the towns folk arent all 'squares', theres a nice balance that lets you decide. Being set and produced in the fifties theres a strong rebellious streak through the film, and rather than just the dramatisation ao an actual event I think it has links with the social climate of the time. I get a strong Macarthyism style wiff from this pungent little snuff box, i could be wrong but the stench is mighty strong.Brando does his usual job, acting mostly with his expressive face throughout as his character hardly says much, you always get the impression he is continually considering his situation and finding no real purpose, you cant help but watch him and he manages to shine through from a sea of insignificant others.The film has aged in a way that other youth films such as 'Rebel without a cause' havent, this is mainly down to the jive talk, which is a bit old hat, its funny though how even today white folks still imitate the infinately cooler speech of the black community ( Brando does it a bit better than most kids today though )If you can look past the jive ( which i think gives the film a touch of style) you will most probably enjoy this, i just convinced myself that i do love this afterallbye",4,Are you down with my review,1019520000,"04 23, 2002",2002,1973,"['Ummmmmm', 'think', 'reason', 'film', 'reasoning', 'picture', 'can', 'leave', 'questioning', 'years', 'wether', 'like', 'not', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'impact', 'im', 'wrong', 'do', 'just', 'dont', 'know', 'love', 'it.The', 'film', 'lovely', 'little', 'group', 'buggerlugs', 'who', 'decide', 'run', 'muck', 'small', 'town', 'What', 'bit', 'special', 'sparkly', 'allagiorical', 'treat', 'hidden', 'away', 'was', 'fifties', 'film', 'Brando', 'it.The', 'film', 'decide', 'who', 'are', 'villans', 'tale', 'gang', 'towns', 'people', 'bikers', 'are', 'thankfully', 'represented', 'aimiable', 'light', 'when', 'contrasted', 'lynch', 'mob', 'towns', 'people', 'who', 'decide', 'go', 'law', 'rid', 'town', 'invading', 'scallywags', 'towns', 'folk', 'arent', ""'squares"", 'nice', 'balance', 'decide', 'Being', 'set', 'produced', 'fifties', 'strong', 'rebellious', 'streak', 'film', 'rather', 'just', 'dramatisation', 'actual', 'event', 'think', 'links', 'social', 'climate', 'time', 'get', 'strong', 'Macarthyism', 'style', 'wiff', 'pungent', 'little', 'snuff', 'box', 'i', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'stench', 'mighty', 'strong.Brando', 'usual', 'job', 'acting', 'mostly', 'expressive', 'face', 'character', 'hardly', 'much', 'always', 'get', 'impression', 'continually', 'considering', 'situation', 'finding', 'real', 'purpose', 'cant', 'help', 'watch', 'shine', 'sea', 'insignificant', 'others.The', 'film', 'aged', 'way', 'other', 'youth', 'films', 'such', ""'Rebel"", 'cause', 'havent', 'mainly', 'down', 'jive', 'talk', 'bit', 'old', 'hat', 'funny', 'how', 'even', 'today', 'white', 'folks', 'still', 'imitate', 'infinately', 'cooler', 'speech', 'black', 'community', 'Brando', 'bit', 'better', 'most', 'kids', 'today', 'can', 'look', 'jive', 'i', 'think', 'film', 'touch', 'style', 'will', 'most', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'i', 'just', 'convinced', 'i', 'do', 'love', 'afterallbye']",N/A

Believe me, nobody outside of 42nd Street ever talked like that, daddy-o.  The story plays out like some kind of ""B"" Western with a horse shortage.  The ""town"" even looks like a Western set made over for what somebody in Hollywood thought might be a new genre.  There's a caf&eacute; and a saloon rolled into one and a gal working there to catch the eye, and a town posse and a jail and a sheriff (father of the gal) and some ""decent citizens"" turning into vigilantes, and instead of outlaws we have ""hooligans.""  The bikers do everything but tie their bikes up to the hitching post after roaring into town as though to take over.Okay, that's one level.  On another level this should be compared to Rebel without a Cause (1955) as a mid-century testament to teen angst.  Or to Blackboard Jungle (1955) with the fake juvenile delinquency and the phony slang.  Marlon Brando as Johnny Strabler, whose claim to fame (aside from being the leader of the pack) is that he stole a second-place biker trophy, stars in a role that helped to launch his career, not that his acting in this film was so great.  (He was better in half a dozen other roles, for example., as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire 1951, or as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront 1954). What stands out here is his tough-guy vulnerability with women: the irresistible little boy playing big.  In one sense, this is, despite all the men running around and the macho delirium, something very close to ladies night out.  It's a period piece love story, as delicate as a teenager's heart.Mary Murphy, who in my opinion really steals the show, is at the very center of the drama and the psychology (not to mention that she looks downright yummy in her cashmere sweater and close fitting skirt).  She plays Kathie Bleeker, a small town girl whose heart yearns for something--anything--to break the tedium.  Along comes Johnny to sweep her off her feet.  Only he isn't sure how.  Furthermore, she has a problem: although she falls in love with the wild one, she sees right through him.  The scene that makes the movie begins with her jumping onto the back of his motorcycle (of course) and, after roaring down the night highway, they retire to what looks like a park.  She is about a breath away from what used to be called swooning, but despite her fluttering heart, she sets him straight on who he is and how she feels and why.  It's like a woman talking to a wild boy.  Then she falls to the ground and just about caresses his motorcycle.  It really hits home because she sees through all his pretense and exposes his vulnerability, but is vulnerable herself.Lee Marvin plays the rival gang leader with a lot of showmanship and Robert Keith plays the ineffectual father.  Just about everybody else (including longtime LA sports anchor, Gil Stratton) amounts to an extra.See this for a glimpse at mid-century psychology as seen through the eyes of Hollywood's seduction machine, and especially for Mary Murphy (running in those heels) who, for whatever reason, never became a star.",4,He's really just a pussy cat,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,3137,"['bikers', 'are', 'Broadway', 'show', 'extras', 'dialogue', 'embarrassingly', 'unauthentic', 'Believe', 'nobody', '42nd', 'Street', 'ever', 'talked', 'daddy-o', 'story', 'out', 'kind', 'B', 'Western', 'horse', 'shortage', 'town', 'even', 'Western', 'set', 'made', 'over', 'what', 'somebody', 'Hollywood', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'new', 'genre', 'caf', 'eacute', 'saloon', 'rolled', 'one', 'gal', 'working', 'there', 'catch', 'eye', 'town', 'posse', 'jail', 'sheriff', 'father', 'gal', 'decent', 'citizens', 'turning', 'vigilantes', 'instead', 'outlaws', 'have', 'hooligans', 'bikers', 'do', 'everything', 'tie', 'bikes', 'up', 'hitching', 'post', 'roaring', 'town', 'take', 'over.Okay', 'one', 'level', 'level', 'should', 'be', 'compared', 'Rebel', 'Cause', '1955', 'mid-century', 'testament', 'teen', 'angst', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', '1955', 'fake', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'phony', 'slang', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Johnny', 'Strabler', 'claim', 'fame', 'aside', 'being', 'leader', 'pack', 'stole', 'second-place', 'biker', 'trophy', 'stars', 'role', 'helped', 'launch', 'career', 'not', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'better', 'dozen', 'other', 'roles', 'example.', 'Stanley', 'Kowalski', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '1951', 'Terry', 'Malloy', 'Waterfront', '1954', 'What', 'out', 'here', 'tough-guy', 'vulnerability', 'women', 'irresistible', 'little', 'boy', 'playing', 'big', 'one', 'sense', 'men', 'running', 'around', 'macho', 'delirium', 'something', 'very', 'close', 'ladies', 'night', 'out', 'period', 'piece', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'delicate', 'teenager', 'heart.Mary', 'Murphy', 'who', 'opinion', 'really', 'show', 'very', 'center', 'drama', 'psychology', 'not', 'mention', 'downright', 'yummy', 'cashmere', 'sweater', 'close', 'fitting', 'skirt', 'Kathie', 'Bleeker', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'heart', 'something', 'anything', 'break', 'tedium', 'Johnny', 'sweep', 'feet', 'Only', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'Furthermore', 'problem', 'love', 'wild', 'one', 'right', 'scene', 'movie', 'jumping', 'back', 'motorcycle', 'course', 'roaring', 'down', 'night', 'highway', 'retire', 'what', 'park', 'breath', 'away', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'called', 'swooning', 'fluttering', 'heart', 'straight', 'who', 'how', 'why', 'woman', 'talking', 'wild', 'boy', 'Then', 'ground', 'just', 'caresses', 'motorcycle', 'really', 'home', 'pretense', 'vulnerability', 'vulnerable', 'herself.Lee', 'Marvin', 'rival', 'gang', 'leader', 'lot', 'showmanship', 'Robert', 'Keith', 'ineffectual', 'father', 'Just', 'everybody', 'else', 'including', 'longtime', 'LA', 'sports', 'anchor', 'Gil', 'Stratton', 'extra.See', 'glimpse', 'mid-century', 'psychology', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Hollywood', 'seduction', 'machine', 'especially', 'Mary', 'Murphy', 'running', 'heels', 'who', 'reason', 'never', 'became', 'star']",N/A

14681,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,0767818172,Douglas Doepke,"[2, 3]","The gangs appear to have strayed from a Bowery Boys slapstick onto a set from a 1930's western, with a budget of $50 and a director nowhere to be found -- still and all, the film proved remarkably adept at capturing a postwar mood among the young. Nothing may have looked real, but kids of the day got the message. History had not ended in 1945: there was still a restless spirit out there that could not be captured by pre-war malt shops and Saturday night hops. The inarticulate Johnny (Brando) is the perfect embodiment of that angst. He's groping toward something, but what. The gang rides around aimlessly, with no more knowledge of the road ahead than of themselves. Then too, it's the elderly Jimmy, representative of an older, slower America, who's revealingly run over by a run-away cycle. The sweetly pretty Mary Murphy attracts Brando, but she's a baited trap -- he could end up like her father or the townspeople. Does he ever return to her... is the trophy gesture a promise or a farewell... Though severely lacking in some respects, the script wisely leaves such ultimate questions unanswered.  And through it all, Brando, in black leather jacket, remains a powerful yet enigmatic presence. A worthy and enduring icon.Younger viewers might keep in mind that the movie was produced not only at the height of the Cold War, but at the height of the Mc Carthy purges in Hollywood. This, I think, accounts for much of the film's schizophrenia -- many punches were pulled. No one wanted a movie that cast America's youth in a bad light. So despite what was hinted at on screen, audiences were also told that everything is really alright. Level-headed authority (Jay C. Flippen) remains in charge and these are really overgrown boys who will eventually straighten out -- just look at their childish horseplay. It's Brando's smouldering presence that undercuts this comforting message. The audience senses that somewhere behind the defiant slouch lies a wisdom superior to the bland reassurances, if only he could find the words. Those, I suppose, would come 15 years later and in far different rebellious circumstances. Anyway, this is a Brando showcase without which the movie would lie long forgotten.",4,Attitude is Everything,1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,2210,"['gangs', 'appear', 'have', 'strayed', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'slapstick', 'set', '1930', 'western', 'budget', '50', 'director', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'still', 'film', 'proved', 'remarkably', 'adept', 'capturing', 'postwar', 'mood', 'young', 'Nothing', 'may', 'have', 'looked', 'real', 'kids', 'day', 'got', 'message', 'History', 'had', 'not', 'ended', '1945', 'was', 'still', 'restless', 'spirit', 'there', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'captured', 'pre-war', 'malt', 'shops', 'Saturday', 'night', 'hops', 'inarticulate', 'Johnny', 'Brando', 'perfect', 'embodiment', 'angst', 'groping', 'something', 'what', 'gang', 'aimlessly', 'more', 'knowledge', 'road', 'ahead', 'Then', 'too', 'elderly', 'Jimmy', 'representative', 'older', 'slower', 'America', 'who', 'revealingly', 'run', 'over', 'run-away', 'cycle', 'sweetly', 'pretty', 'Mary', 'Murphy', 'Brando', 'baited', 'trap', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'father', 'townspeople', 'ever', 'return', 'trophy', 'gesture', 'promise', 'farewell', 'Though', 'severely', 'lacking', 'respects', 'script', 'wisely', 'such', 'ultimate', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'Brando', 'black', 'leather', 'jacket', 'powerful', 'yet', 'enigmatic', 'presence', 'worthy', 'enduring', 'icon.Younger', 'viewers', 'might', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'not', 'only', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'height', 'Mc', 'Carthy', 'purges', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'accounts', 'much', 'film', 'schizophrenia', 'many', 'punches', 'were', 'pulled', 'one', 'wanted', 'movie', 'cast', 'America', 'youth', 'bad', 'light', 'So', 'what', 'was', 'hinted', 'screen', 'audiences', 'were', 'also', 'told', 'everything', 'really', 'alright', 'Level-headed', 'authority', 'Jay', 'C.', 'Flippen', 'charge', 'are', 'really', 'overgrown', 'boys', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'straighten', 'out', 'just', 'look', 'childish', 'horseplay', 'Brando', 'smouldering', 'presence', 'comforting', 'message', 'audience', 'somewhere', 'defiant', 'slouch', 'wisdom', 'superior', 'bland', 'reassurances', 'only', 'could', 'find', 'words', 'suppose', 'would', 'come', '15', 'years', 'later', 'far', 'different', 'rebellious', 'circumstances', 'Anyway', 'Brando', 'showcase', 'movie', 'would', 'lie', 'long', 'forgotten']",N/A

By modern standards, however, it is hard to imagine an average teenager sitting through this film in its entirety, much less being inspired by it. ""The Wild One"" is yet another one of those films that you ""should see"" because of its historical importance rather than because it is actually a good film.The script and acting in this film are, for the most part (Brando being the exception), on par with your average 1950's B-grade sci-fi movie. The storyline is all over the place and many of the characters' actions barely make sense. The story has little by way of an introduction (stuff more or less just happens) and the ending is awkwardly wordy. However, it is also the first film to show the youth culture of the time (or of any time) and for that reason is of interest. The message of the film: that we should try to understand the youth, rather than being frightened of them or condemning them, is one that has been repeated again and again ever since.There are better films that have depicted the 1950's youth culture (I prefer ""Blackboard Jungle""), but without ""The Wild One"", those films would never have existed.

14687,A284WUQS94AQ7A,0767818172,"Geri ""Birdie""","[5, 5]","This movie made in 1954 starring Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin was the first of the ""biker"" movies.The film loosely depicts the 1947 biker melee that really happened and virtually destroyed the northern California town of Hollister.  The script was a little weak for me.Marlon Brando stars as Johnny, the leader of a biker gang (the Black Rebels) that invades a small town, Wrightsville.The movie begins where the gang takes a road trip and crashes a motorcycle race and push race officials around. They are eventually thrown out but one of them ends up stealing the first prize trophy and gives it to Johnny, who straps it to his bike like a hood ornament. The gang then rides into Wrightsville where they cruise up and down the main street and end up going to the local bar. The owner of the bar is happy to let the bikers spend their money and does nothing to break up any fights. Johnny likes the girl who works there, but she is the sheriff's daughter but he still tries to impress her with the trophy. Then a rival gang rides into town, headed by Chino (Lee Marvin) and the havoc begins.The movie's language is severely dated, but I wasn't around then, so I imagine that's how some of the younger people spoke.  The movie has a great quote though.  When one person asked Johnny (Brando) what he was rebelling about he replied, ""Whatta ya got"".This film also was believed to inspire Sonny Barger the undisputed leader of the Hells Angels.While I'm an avid motorcyclist, I don't condone being in a ""biker"" gang and I'm not a member of the ""1 percenters"", so to see bikers destroy a town wasn't entertainment to me especially when there was no motive.  The head of the American Motorcycle Assoc. made a statement saying that 99% of motorcyclist are law abiding citizens, the Hells Angels claim that they are the remaining 1 percenters.But, when you ride a bike it is the most exciting thing you can put between your legs and you get the feeling of total freedom and it's pure fun.With all its flaws, this film will appeal to you if you love bikes and besides that you get to see the start of biker clothing---the leather jacket.",3,"""Whatta ya got?""",1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,2130,"['movie', 'made', '1954', 'starring', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'was', 'first', 'biker', 'movies.The', 'film', 'loosely', '1947', 'biker', 'melee', 'really', 'happened', 'virtually', 'destroyed', 'northern', 'California', 'town', 'Hollister', 'script', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'me.Marlon', 'Brando', 'Johnny', 'leader', 'biker', 'gang', 'Black', 'Rebels', 'small', 'town', 'Wrightsville.The', 'movie', 'where', 'gang', 'road', 'trip', 'motorcycle', 'race', 'push', 'race', 'officials', 'around', 'are', 'eventually', 'thrown', 'out', 'one', 'up', 'stealing', 'first', 'prize', 'trophy', 'Johnny', 'who', 'bike', 'hood', 'ornament', 'gang', 'then', 'Wrightsville', 'where', 'cruise', 'up', 'main', 'street', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'local', 'bar', 'owner', 'bar', 'happy', 'let', 'bikers', 'spend', 'money', 'nothing', 'break', 'up', 'fights', 'Johnny', 'girl', 'who', 'there', 'sheriff', 'daughter', 'still', 'impress', 'trophy', 'Then', 'rival', 'gang', 'rides', 'town', 'headed', 'Chino', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'havoc', 'begins.The', 'movie', 'language', 'severely', 'dated', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'then', 'imagine', 'how', 'younger', 'people', 'spoke', 'movie', 'great', 'quote', 'When', 'one', 'person', 'asked', 'Johnny', 'Brando', 'what', 'was', 'rebelling', 'replied', 'Whatta', 'ya', 'got', '.This', 'film', 'also', 'was', 'believed', 'inspire', 'Sonny', 'Barger', 'undisputed', 'leader', 'Hells', 'Angels.While', ""'m"", 'avid', 'motorcyclist', 'do', ""n't"", 'condone', 'being', 'biker', 'gang', ""'m"", 'not', 'member', '1', 'percenters', 'so', 'see', 'bikers', 'destroy', 'town', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertainment', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'motive', 'head', 'American', 'Motorcycle', 'Assoc', 'made', 'statement', 'saying', '99', '%', 'motorcyclist', 'are', 'law', 'abiding', 'citizens', 'Hells', 'Angels', 'claim', 'are', 'remaining', '1', 'percenters.But', 'when', 'ride', 'bike', 'most', 'exciting', 'thing', 'can', 'put', 'legs', 'get', 'feeling', 'total', 'freedom', 'pure', 'fun.With', 'flaws', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'love', 'bikes', 'besides', 'get', 'see', 'start', 'biker', 'clothing', 'leather', 'jacket']",N/A

14689,A26HFSVLAGULIM,0767818172,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[3, 5]","IN A NUTSHELL:Teen angst portrayed by grown men, led by Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin, on noisy motorcycles meets the small town from hell. Mary Murphy is stunning as Brando's small-town girl ready for the backseat of his motorcycle. This is a real spectacle and something film buffs should consider seeing, at least once. However, the real meaning and value is a bit confusing.CONFUSING?I am pleased to say I had never experienced ""The Wild One"" before last night, which makes my impressions fresh. As the film rolled on I was not sure who was the villian[s] and who was the victim[s]? In concrete terms, it was the old man that was killed by the motorcycle after Brando was knocked off it by a thrown ""tire iron"", but that was NOT what the story was about.WHAT WAS THE STORY ABOUT:In a word - RAGE - RAGE - RAGE and more RAGE.My thought process went something like this. The movie opens with a motorcycle gang riding into and disrupting a motorcycle race. They shove a few protesting race officials and then I think, ""A-ha! So this is where the biker gang goes wild!"" After a few minutes, Brando gets a 2nd place trophy courtesy of a thieving henchmen and the gang departs swiftly after the first sign of local law enforcement, before anyone gets hurt. Ok, so that's just to whet our appetite -- RIGHT?The next town won't be so lucky. I smiled when I saw Jay C. Flippen playing Sheriff Singer. This man would be the pushover needed to have a real disaster, I assured myself. Gradually, the bikers became increasingly raucous and were definitely disturbing the peace. As long as they paid for their beers and didn't break too much around the town, nobody was too put out. Mary Murphy who played Brando's love interest Kathie was certainly the scene stealer here and was as out-of-place as the middle aged bikers, but so what?However, after a while, I realized nothing was really happening other than some bad-mannered bikers drinking a lot of beer. Then, Lee Marvin and his rival gang [actually the group Brando's gang broke from] showed up and I thought, ""A-ha! These guys are going to commit atrocities here,"" and I quickly fetched my remote control so that I could skip or fast-forward scenes if I found the new gang too disturbing. Well, when the milquetoast town cop marched Lee Marvin [Chino] to the jail without any violence or even a protest from the two gangs now outnumbering the townspeople, my confusion really deepened and I put the remote control down.So where is the WILD ONE? At the beginning of the film there was this warning about what horrors happened in this town and in England it would be 13 years before the censors would allow ""The Wild One"" to be shown! Well, SURPRISE - SURPRISE, the violence and killing did come, but it came from vigilantes in the town. Yes, that's right, it came from the townspeople, or at least the local bullies who were as mad as hell and not willing to take it anymore.Johnny [Brando] was selected to become the scapegoat and was yanked off his bike, captured, and beaten. When Johnny escaped while Sheriff Singer was talking sense to the town bully, the vigilantes went looking for him again. As he fled on his motorcycle, one of the vigilantes threw the ""tire iron"" which knocked him off his bike and caused the death of the old man who was basically an innocent bystander.TIME CAPSULE?I'm not sure if the way I interpreted the film last night is the way it was intended in 1954. I do know that when I saw ""Rebel Without A Cause"" also for the first time recently, I saw the ""teen angst"" and ""ineffective parents"". This time, I just saw the town from hell responding to the bad-mannered bikers. After seeing ""Rebel Without A Cause"" with me, my 16-year-old daughter declared that she wanted a red jacket for Christmas. I'm pretty sure, however, that she won't want a silly-looking hat and a black leather jacket after she sees ""The Wild One"". I'm not sure if that makes ""The Wild One"" a time capsule or just a dated movie that was a provovative Brando vehicle at the time. I am sure that seeing it today may be confusing for some.WORTH MENTIONING:Mary Murphy was a very sympathetic young woman and very alluring in a wholesome small town way. Lee Marvin was his usual grating self and Brando essentially pouted throughout the entire movie. It was very touching that Johnny did give Mary Murphy his stolen 2nd place trophy at the end, as a sort of intimate thank you for her appeal to the County Sheriff at the end of the film. This appeal prompted her uncle to admit that ""someone"" had thrown a tire iron that ""made the bike go crazy"" and cleared ""The Wild One"" of manslaughter.ABOUT THE DVD:If ""Scene Selector"" is a feature, this DVD has features.

Levic,"[1, 1]","With his distinctive voice and way of speaking and his non-classical good looks, it is clear to see why Marlon Brando made a splash on screen in the 1950's.In THE WILD ONE, Marlon Brando is Johnny Strabler, the leader of a motorcycle gang of young thugs with no purpose in life other than to make trouble.They disrupt a motorcycle event and steal a trophy and then head to a small town where there is more trouble and fear and intimidation and much worse. Soon a rival motorcyle gang shows up. Their leader is played by Lee Marvin. Two great actors in a not so great movie.Maybe THE WILD ONE had more relevance in 1953 as the US lived in fear of danger from within - the communist threat to the world and the Korean War. There is a fear in the air as these young men ride into town looking for trouble. The local sheriff is weak and trying to avoid confrontation at all cost. There are some deep character studies going on here. Strabler is troubled and directionless as are the members of the gang. Johnny shows a tough facade but deep underneath there is a heart beating. As with the character in ON THE WATERFRONT, all it takes for the heart to show is the love of a young and beautiful woman. This time she's the sheriff's daughter. Of course, that only adds to the conflict.It's hard to find a hero in this film. A bunch of thugs terrorizing a town. Some townspeople are ready for a fight no matter what. The sheriff's daughter just wants any chance to get out of town. There is a message here that must have been clearer in 1953.

Always looking for great '50s films, and '50s-related films, I gave this a try. When it came on, after the Columbia logo, it opened on a deserted highway with a title card reading &quot;This is a shocking story. It could never take place in most American towns--but it did in this one. It is a public challenge not to let it happen again.&quot; That'll grab your attention. Marlon Brando's voice is heard narrating about his expericences in the story. All of a sudden motorcycles appear roaring down the road over the opening credits. The film is basically about rebellious motorcyclistswho cause mischief in a small town and hang out at a local diner until Johnny's (Marlon Brando) rival Chino (Lee Marvin) arrives.Check this film out and see what happens. When you see that chilling title card and the film progresses, you may be puzzled wondering what will happen, for at first the rebels may appear as all bark and no bite. There's a lot of cool '50s slang, daddy-o, to look at the lighter side! The result of the film is an accident and the rebels being forced to leave town never to return again; I'll say that much. When you see the film for the first time, and are about to watch it again, you might say to the chilling title card&quot;Balderdash!&quot; Think what gangs are doing now as opposed to what they did exactly 50 years ago.

First, and most important about this film is that it was made in 1953, and is therefore rather dated.  Brando himself reflected on this film in his autobiography(Songs My Mother Taught Me) saying he felt it was a good picture when he made it, but he thought it hadn't aged well.  In the context of this particular film it means these bike gangs, while at the time considered rebellious and dangerous, do not, by modern conventions of &quot;rebels&quot; and &quot;outlaws,&quot; really come off as that threatening.

What a disappointment!There was nothing intrinsically bad about this gang. And that was what the trouble was. They were just a bunch of young men who liked to let loose on weekends. Not a criminal or outlaw bone in their bodies. They made a lot of noise, fought among themselves, drank a lot of beer. The pranks were rather harmless too, like teasing the uptight residents of the town, making noise, joking around by putting hair dryers on their heads. A small amount of property gets destroyed, but these men are obvioiusly not real criminals.I giggled throughout the move in places that were overacted and were not supposed to be funny. There was no real tension even though a voice-over at the beginning warns the audience about this awful gang and that people have to make sure that it doesn't happen here. The love interest seemed silly. And Brando seemed to be totally limited in his range of emotion or acting ability.I just can't understand why this movie became so famous and was so acknowledged. It is not just that it was made more than three decades ago. I've seen other movies from that period that had good plots and good acting. On the Waterfront was one of them, produced in the same year,and in which Brando emerged as a fine actor.Recommended only for those into classic films.

14702,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,0767818172,Martin Asiner,"[0, 0]","Occasionally, a film comes along that is thoroughly unexceptional but somehow catches the emotional pulse of the viewer and of the age.  For better or worse, this film defines the moment, which flares beacon-like, and in whose glare its flaws are momentarily hidden until the next generation can see it with fresh perspective.  Such a film was THE WILD ONE.  Based loosely on a real-life incident in 1947, California, director Laslo Benedek retells how a mob of Hell's Angels type motorcyclists descended on a small, sleepy town to wreak havoc. Coming as it did just two years after the end of the Second World War, this original incident stunned the contemporary American public that had grown used to the idea that violence committed against a recognized enemy was acceptable, but against solid, middle-class citizens, there arose a fury against those who would dare upset what the stormers of Tarawa had died to preserve.  By 1953, there grew to age a new generation of which the memories of the war were but fleeting, and this new group was shouting to be heard in a wilderness of predictably, law-abiding Americans.  Against this backdrop of youthful rootlessness, leather was the symbol of revolt and motorcycles the means to flaunt it.Marlon Brando plays Johnny, the cycle leader, as a young punk who hides his fears and uncertainties behind a mask of crafted sarcasms.  He speaks in the new lingo of the youth. One of the ironies not fully appreciated until years later is that the actors who played the gang riders made their later reputations often playing the same upstanding citizens whom they reviled that sunny day in California.  It is clear that they are in revolt against conformity, but when Johnny's love interest, played by Mary Murphy asks him against what they are rebelling, he snarls in one of the two most memorable lines of the movie and the age: 'What do you got?' They derail a legitimate motorcycle competition, insult the good citizens of the town, and generally raise a low level of hell.  Eventually the citizens get fed up with the antics of Johnny and form a vigilante committee that drives them out, but only after one of the townspeople is killed in the melee does Johnny and his band exit the town, bruised in body if not in mind.Repeated viewings on the film bring out a subtle subtext about the need to make one's mark on a world that encourages a bland uniformity, and the vicious response of that world to enforce its unwritten fiats by extra-legal means. As the viewer sees the wrongs committed by the bikers against the townspeople and then balances them against other wrongs committed by the townspeople against the bikers, he is sullenly surprised to learn that the leather of the bikers covers a minor level of lawlessness while the button-down sport shirts of the town's citizens covers a viciousness that is truly lethal.  When the bikers roll into town, they seem more like a rowdy group of soccer fans out to raise mild hell after their favorite team had lost a key game: they grouse, they curse, they drink beer, and they goose a few girls.  The townspeople, on the other hand, seem individually impotent, and stay that way until Chino, played effectively by a loud and slimy Lee Marvin, pushes both the town to react to him and Johnny to reclaim his right to be the bike leader.  It is only when the town's citizens band together that the audience can sense that they blend their small amounts of testosterone into a boiling cauldron, the results of which show more about themselves than about the bikers.  They grab Johnny and drag him to a garage, where they beat him with fists and clubs.  It is here that Johnny hurls at his tormentors the film's other great line, 'My old man hits harder than that.'It is unlikely that director Benedek meant THE WILD ONE to stand as anything more than the first in what he surely hoped would be a renaissance of a new film genre, but as so often happens in any work of art, the finished product may evoke a response that the originating artist did not intend at all.  Perhaps this is the reason why THE WILD ONE can still be enjoyed years after other cycle movies have long since crashed into the dust.",3,The Wild One: But Who is the One?,1024272000,"06 17, 2002",2002,4193,"['Occasionally', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'unexceptional', 'somehow', 'emotional', 'pulse', 'viewer', 'age', 'better', 'worse', 'film', 'moment', 'beacon-like', 'glare', 'flaws', 'are', 'momentarily', 'hidden', 'next', 'generation', 'can', 'see', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'film', 'was', 'WILD', 'ONE', 'Based', 'loosely', 'real-life', 'incident', '1947', 'California', 'director', 'Laslo', 'Benedek', 'how', 'mob', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'type', 'motorcyclists', 'descended', 'small', 'sleepy', 'town', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'Coming', 'did', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'end', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'original', 'incident', 'stunned', 'contemporary', 'American', 'public', 'had', 'grown', 'used', 'idea', 'violence', 'committed', 'recognized', 'enemy', 'was', 'acceptable', 'solid', 'middle-class', 'citizens', 'arose', 'fury', 'who', 'would', 'dare', 'upset', 'what', 'stormers', 'Tarawa', 'had', 'died', 'preserve', '1953', 'grew', 'age', 'new', 'generation', 'memories', 'war', 'were', 'fleeting', 'new', 'group', 'was', 'shouting', 'be', 'heard', 'wilderness', 'predictably', 'law-abiding', 'Americans', 'backdrop', 'youthful', 'rootlessness', 'leather', 'was', 'symbol', 'revolt', 'means', 'flaunt', 'it.Marlon', 'Brando', 'Johnny', 'cycle', 'leader', 'young', 'punk', 'who', 'fears', 'uncertainties', 'mask', 'crafted', 'sarcasms', 'new', 'lingo', 'youth', 'One', 'ironies', 'not', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'years', 'later', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'gang', 'riders', 'made', 'later', 'reputations', 'often', 'playing', 'same', 'upstanding', 'citizens', 'whom', 'reviled', 'sunny', 'day', 'California', 'clear', 'are', 'revolt', 'conformity', 'when', 'Johnny', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'Mary', 'Murphy', 'what', 'are', 'rebelling', 'snarls', 'one', 'two', 'most', 'memorable', 'lines', 'movie', 'age', ""'What"", 'do', 'got', 'derail', 'legitimate', 'motorcycle', 'competition', 'insult', 'good', 'citizens', 'town', 'generally', 'raise', 'low', 'level', 'hell', 'Eventually', 'citizens', 'get', 'fed', 'up', 'antics', 'Johnny', 'form', 'vigilante', 'committee', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'townspeople', 'killed', 'melee', 'Johnny', 'band', 'town', 'bruised', 'body', 'not', 'mind.Repeated', 'viewings', 'film', 'bring', 'out', 'subtle', 'subtext', 'need', 'make', 'one', 'mark', 'world', 'bland', 'uniformity', 'vicious', 'response', 'world', 'enforce', 'unwritten', 'fiats', 'extra-legal', 'means', 'viewer', 'wrongs', 'committed', 'bikers', 'townspeople', 'then', 'other', 'wrongs', 'committed', 'townspeople', 'bikers', 'sullenly', 'surprised', 'learn', 'leather', 'bikers', 'minor', 'level', 'lawlessness', 'button-down', 'sport', 'shirts', 'town', 'citizens', 'viciousness', 'truly', 'lethal', 'When', 'bikers', 'roll', 'town', 'seem', 'more', 'rowdy', 'group', 'soccer', 'fans', 'out', 'raise', 'mild', 'hell', 'favorite', 'team', 'had', 'lost', 'key', 'game', 'grouse', 'curse', 'drink', 'beer', 'goose', 'few', 'girls', 'townspeople', 'other', 'hand', 'seem', 'individually', 'impotent', 'stay', 'way', 'Chino', 'played', 'effectively', 'loud', 'slimy', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'town', 'react', 'Johnny', 'reclaim', 'right', 'be', 'bike', 'leader', 'only', 'when', 'town', 'citizens', 'band', 'together', 'audience', 'can', 'sense', 'blend', 'small', 'amounts', 'testosterone', 'boiling', 'cauldron', 'results', 'show', 'more', 'bikers', 'grab', 'Johnny', 'drag', 'garage', 'where', 'beat', 'fists', 'clubs', 'here', 'Johnny', 'hurls', 'tormentors', 'film', 'other', 'great', 'line', 'old', 'man', 'harder', 'unlikely', 'director', 'Benedek', 'meant', 'THE', 'WILD', 'ONE', 'stand', 'anything', 'more', 'first', 'what', 'surely', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'renaissance', 'new', 'film', 'genre', 'so', 'often', 'work', 'art', 'finished', 'product', 'may', 'evoke', 'response', 'originating', 'artist', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'why', 'WILD', 'ONE', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'years', 'other', 'cycle', 'movies', 'have', 'long', 'crashed', 'dust']",N/A

It was, in fact, a generation with a sensitive exposed nerve that gave constant pain...Marlon Brando, a young 'Method' actor (the ""Method' was itself a manifestation of the times) began his film career with 'The Men' (1950) and continued with 'A Streetcar Named Desire' (1951), 'Viva Zapata' (1952) and 'Julius Caesar' (1953), all roles concerned with rebellion...

But it all boils down to the fact that this is a pretty square picture, made by a bunch of squares, all trying desparately to be hip and capture the essence of something entirely new and elusive, which was Beat coolness, crossed with postwar veteran angst.The original event that this is (loosely) based on, a motorcycle rally in Hollister, CA in 1947, is very misunderstood and little known outside of biker circles.  But there was a sea change underway in the American psyche - one could almost say that the 60's started there, as much as anywhere.  &quot;The Wild One&quot; tries to capture this notion, but this film has a very tone deaf quality to it.

14715,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,0767818172,Strawgold,"[1, 1]","Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin were two of my favorites back in the day this Stanley Kramer rebel film was conceived, and I still don't know why I didn't see it then - because it was highly advertised as a controversial picture and I tried to go to them all, hoping to see something really shocking.  Times have changed.Anyway, the story starts out with the bikers arriving en-masse into the sleepy little town and they immediately manage to disrupt a legitimate cycle competition that is going on.  One of them lifts a trophy and presents it to Brando as a trophy of another sort.  Of course, it's conceptual story line is obviously dated,  movies being what they were allowed to be then vs. the artistic liberty afforded them now; the pack of leathered up hoods come off like a bunch of mischievous choirboys twisting off on a forbidden lark rather than the two dangerous opposing gangs of outlaws they're supposed to be - of which Brando and Lee Marvin head up as rowdy, rascally rivals who meet again in the little Podunk town and liven it up for a few hours.The action starts and several of the town fathers get their feathers ruffled over having to host the gangs and suffer the property damage as well as the aggravation of having them in town.  Their own reactions become as prejudiced and out of control as the bikers themselves; vigilante justice is served up but not overly so.The necessary ""almost-love story"" peeks through the clouds between Brando and his of-the-moment conquest,  Mary Murphy, who plays the part of a waitress he decides to fancy;  he does not know her father is the Chief of Police just yet.  When he discovers this later on, he decides this chick is definitely not going to be his type, but he wavers; she decides he is not really going to be in her future either, but she wavers; love doesn't conquer all after all and Brando rides off down the street into the sunset after cracking the first rusty smile he delivers in the film as he leaves Mary with a tiny piece of his heart and the trophy he didn't win;  but he does win, in a way - because he takes a piece of her heart with him too - and that truly was a ""trophy of another sort"" he might have been looking for.There is a meaningless scene insert - a former lover of Brando's who's only role at first glance seems designed solely for the purpose of showcasing a pair of big boobs.  She's immaculately clean and coiffed, too, for a biker chick.  He keeps flicking her off like a fly, but on second thought, my take was that it was meant to add not only intrigue but the biker sex routines suggestion that couldn't otherwise be be detailed quite so easily then.Several of the scenes are very good and capture fleeting feelings of love mingling with mistrust; especially the tender/tough one of Brando and Murphy racing away together on the bike after he heads off a tragedy that threatens to befall her partly because of who he is and what he has brought with him.If you like old movies, Brando and Marvin, you'll probably enjoy this one well enough just for old time's sake if for no other reason.

At pavement level. Suddenly a roar and a swarm of loud speeding motorcycles thunders over me.  Big road bikes.  I was hooked.  I would do this one day.The remainder of the film is about the incursion of a gang of hooligans on two wheels into a small town, with its quiet orderly stores and vulnerable pretty girls.  I've read that it was loosely based on true events that happened in Hollister, CA.  At the time, I couldn't appreciate the social message of that situation.

(I'm not sure if Hollister is the name of the town in the film, but that's where it was actually shot; Hollister is about 70 miles SE of San Francisco).WHAT WORKS: Needless to say, Marlon Brando is superb as the taciturn Black Rebels' leader. At the opposite end of the dispositional spectrum Lee Marvin is just as exquisite as the merry, fun-brawling leader of The Beetles. Mary Murphy is also very good as the cafe worker that shares a few romantic sparks with Brando.Brando was 30 years old at the time of this picture's release, so it's not very appropriate that he's constantly referred to as ""boy"" in the film. Regardless, Marlon as the titular 'wild one' is definitely the prototype of Fonzy-like ""cool,"" a full 2 years before James Dean's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" would materialize. His ""Whaddaya got?"" response to the question ""What are you rebelling against?"" is priceless, to say the least.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Although the plot is good (loosely based on a real event), the story's dramatic stagings and shifts, not to mention the trying-to-be-hip non-genuine lingo, provoke an amused ""Yeah, right"" response. Such phoniness will naturally hinder modern viewers from becoming enraptured by the story (""modern viewer"" includes anyone who grew up on post-50s cinema -- i.e. mid-60s to the present).Still, a couple of story elements work well, like the ending [minor SPOILER alert] when a police officer encourages Brando to thank Mary and her father; Marlon appears to try but ultimately maintains his silent 'cool' demeanor. Mary then responds, ""It's okay, he doesn't know how."" Although she's right, Brando comes back a day or so later to indeed express his thanks, albeit in a non-verbal manner.BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a classic biker flick, don't expect ""The Wild One"" to remotely resemble the infamous late 60's/early 70's biker films, such as ""The Wild Angels"" or ""Hell's Angels on Wheels."" Keep in mind that cinematic ""gritty realism"" didn't come into vogue until the 60s. Hence, it should come as no surprise that ""The Wild One"" largely comes off as lame, tame, artificial and amusing, you know what I'm saying, Daddy-O? Still, Marlon Brando towers over the material and there are a few worthwhile qualities, as noted above. Needless to say, a must for Brando fans and those interested in classic cinema or amusing old-fashioned dialogue.",3,"I've had it with this jive, Daddy-O; I don't know where I'm going, I just GO",1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,2756,"['Marlon', 'Brando', 'Wild', 'One', '1953', 'black', 'white', 'could', 'arguably', 'be', 'called', 'first', 'biker', 'flick', 'even', 'parts', 'story/dialogue', 'come', 'artificial', 'amusing', 'tame', 'especially', 'compared', 'first', 'REAL', 'biker', 'flick', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Wild', 'Angels', '1966.THE', 'STORY', 'Two', 'gangs', 'clash', 'Hollister', 'California', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Black', 'Rebels', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Beetles', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Hollister', 'name', 'town', 'film', 'where', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Hollister', '70', 'miles', 'SE', 'San', 'Francisco', '.WHAT', 'Needless', 'say', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'superb', 'taciturn', 'Black', 'Rebels', 'leader', 'opposite', 'end', 'dispositional', 'spectrum', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'just', 'as', 'exquisite', 'merry', 'fun-brawling', 'leader', 'Beetles', 'Mary', 'Murphy', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'cafe', 'worker', 'shares', 'few', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'Brando.Brando', 'was', '30', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'picture', 'release', 'not', 'very', 'appropriate', 'constantly', 'referred', 'boy', 'film', 'Regardless', 'Marlon', 'titular', 'one', 'definitely', 'prototype', 'Fonzy-like', 'cool', 'full', '2', 'years', 'James', 'Dean', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'would', 'materialize', 'Whaddaya', 'got', 'response', 'question', 'What', 'are', 'rebelling', 'priceless', 'say', 'least.WHAT', ""N'T"", 'WORK', 'plot', 'good', 'loosely', 'based', 'real', 'event', 'story', 'dramatic', 'stagings', 'shifts', 'not', 'mention', 'trying-to-be-hip', 'non-genuine', 'lingo', 'provoke', 'amused', 'Yeah', 'right', 'response', 'Such', 'phoniness', 'will', 'naturally', 'hinder', 'modern', 'viewers', 'becoming', 'enraptured', 'story', 'modern', 'viewer', 'anyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'post-50s', 'cinema', 'i.e', 'mid-60s', 'present', '.Still', 'couple', 'story', 'elements', 'work', 'well', 'ending', '[', 'minor', 'SPOILER', 'alert', ']', 'when', 'police', 'officer', 'Brando', 'thank', 'Mary', 'father', 'Marlon', 'try', 'ultimately', 'silent', ""'cool"", 'demeanor', 'Mary', 'then', 'okay', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'right', 'Brando', 'back', 'day', 'so', 'later', 'indeed', 'express', 'thanks', 'albeit', 'non-verbal', 'manner.BOTTOM', 'LINE', ""'re"", 'looking', 'classic', 'biker', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Wild', 'One', 'remotely', 'resemble', 'infamous', 'late', ""60's/early"", '70', 'biker', 'films', 'such', 'Wild', 'Angels', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'Wheels', 'Keep', 'mind', 'cinematic', 'gritty', 'realism', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'vogue', '60s', 'Hence', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'Wild', 'One', 'largely', 'off', 'lame', 'tame', 'artificial', 'amusing', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'Daddy-O', 'Still', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'towers', 'material', 'are', 'few', 'worthwhile', 'qualities', 'noted', 'Needless', 'say', 'must', 'Brando', 'fans', 'interested', 'classic', 'cinema', 'amusing', 'old-fashioned', 'dialogue']",N/A
