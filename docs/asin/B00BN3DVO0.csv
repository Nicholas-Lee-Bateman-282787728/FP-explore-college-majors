My favorite is Lone Wolf McQuade - bot the MIA series is a good set of movies and I also enjoyed Code of Silence and Delta Force.  I probably wouldn't have paid more than the $25 I spent on these five movies, but if you can pick it up cheap (how can you beat $5 a movie on blu-ray?)  I would definitely pick it up if I was you.Of course, it doesn't compare to the 'new' movies with all the special effects but then again, it's not supposed to as most of these movies were made around 30 years ago!!",4,Chuck Norris - what more to say?,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,623,"['good', 'actor', 'not', 'really', 'enjoy', ""'war/action"", 'movies', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'collection', 'favorite', 'Lone', 'Wolf', 'McQuade', 'bot', 'MIA', 'series', 'good', 'set', 'movies', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Code', 'Silence', 'Delta', 'Force', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'paid', 'more', '25', 'spent', 'five', 'movies', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'cheap', 'how', 'can', 'beat', '5', 'movie', 'blu-ray', 'would', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up', 'was', 'you.Of', 'course', ""n't"", 'compare', ""'new"", 'movies', 'special', 'effects', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'supposed', 'most', 'movies', 'were', 'made', '30', 'years', 'ago']",Missing in Action / Missing in Action 2 / Delta Force / Lone Wolf McQuade / Code of Silence

Way back in the 1970s, grindhouse producers were fishing around for a white guy who could put a white face on chop-socky, and maybe steal some of Bruce Lee's righteous thunder.  Unfortunately, the white guy they settled on was Chuck. I hear Chuck coached Steve McQueen in karate, and a few other Hollywood notables as well. Somehow, two-buck Chuck ingratiated himself and kissed enough butt-crack to get a career going.  He then became multi-million buck Chuck. As Don King says: &#34;Only in America!&#34; The only one of these 5 films that is good for a laugh is Lone Wolf McQuade. At least, that has a bizarro David Carradine at his sleaziest throwing loopy crescent kicks, and grinning sadistically.
