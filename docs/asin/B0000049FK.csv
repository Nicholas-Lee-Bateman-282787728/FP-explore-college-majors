He's the director who made ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which most people know as that heart-warming movie they see on TV every year at Christmas time. He made this one, too.This is a thoroughly charming movie. Gary Cooper plays Mr. Deeds, a small-town young man who writes poetry for greeting cards. Interestingly, they refer to them as post cards in the movie, because in those days most greeting cards were post cards. Anyway, his rich uncle died and left him $20 million. A classic dream come true story, right? Except poor Mr. Deeds seems to get nothing but trouble out of it, including a savvy reporter (Jean Arthur) who pretends to faint near his front door and plays the starving working girl, a lady in distress for him to rescue. He's always had a romantic notion about the woman he would marry; his housekeeper mentioned it when the big city lawyer came to tell him about the estate.So he goes off to New York, the reporter writes front-page articles about ""The Cinderella Man,"" but he doesn't know that the girl he is rapidly falling in love with is the reporter. He gets harassed by the board of the opera company, but has enough smarts that when they try to get him to cover their season's losses of $180,000, he says they must cut costs, cut ticket prices, show what people want to see, and put the opera on a paying basis.He manages to see through several fraudulent claimants, but when a farmer who lost his farm and can't feed his family comes shouting at him and pulling out a gun, then drops the gun and cries, apologizing for his temporary insanity, Mr. Deeds treats him to the lunch he had arranged for his girl before his PR man told him she was the reporter who had been writing about him. And as the poor old farmer gobbles down the food, Mr. Deeds is thinking.Next thing you know, he's got a plan: he's going to buy up a large tract of land, and give every dispossessed farmer who applies to him ten acres, a plow, a cow and some seed. If they work it for three years, they get title to the land. Of course, he gets thousands of applicants, but he also gets a sanity hearing from a cousin who figures he should have gotten the money instead of Deeds. (Or rather the cousin's greedy wife does.) So the final scene is the sanity hearing. And this being Frank Capra, he not only is declared sane, but he gets his girl.This is a classic of feel-good humor with a grace and charm which made Frank Capra famous.",5,Brilliant Frank Capra Classic,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2449,"['Remember', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'heart-warming', 'movie', 'see', 'TV', 'year', 'Christmas', 'time', 'made', 'one', 'thoroughly', 'charming', 'movie', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'small-town', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'poetry', 'greeting', 'cards', 'Interestingly', 'refer', 'post', 'cards', 'movie', 'days', 'most', 'greeting', 'cards', 'were', 'post', 'cards', 'Anyway', 'rich', 'uncle', 'died', 'left', '20', 'million', 'classic', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'story', 'right', 'poor', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'get', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'including', 'savvy', 'reporter', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'who', 'faint', 'front', 'door', 'starving', 'working', 'girl', 'lady', 'distress', 'rescue', 'always', 'had', 'romantic', 'notion', 'woman', 'would', 'marry', 'housekeeper', 'mentioned', 'when', 'big', 'city', 'lawyer', 'came', 'tell', 'estate.So', 'off', 'New', 'York', 'reporter', 'front-page', 'articles', 'Cinderella', 'Man', ""n't"", 'know', 'girl', 'rapidly', 'falling', 'love', 'reporter', 'harassed', 'board', 'opera', 'company', 'enough', 'smarts', 'when', 'try', 'get', 'cover', 'season', 'losses', '180,000', 'must', 'cut', 'costs', 'cut', 'ticket', 'prices', 'show', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'put', 'opera', 'paying', 'basis.He', 'manages', 'see', 'several', 'fraudulent', 'claimants', 'when', 'farmer', 'who', 'lost', 'farm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feed', 'family', 'shouting', 'pulling', 'out', 'gun', 'then', 'gun', 'cries', 'apologizing', 'temporary', 'insanity', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'lunch', 'had', 'arranged', 'girl', 'PR', 'man', 'told', 'was', 'reporter', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'writing', 'poor', 'old', 'farmer', 'gobbles', 'down', 'food', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'thinking.Next', 'thing', 'know', 'got', 'plan', 'going', 'buy', 'up', 'large', 'tract', 'land', 'give', 'dispossessed', 'farmer', 'who', 'ten', 'acres', 'plow', 'cow', 'seed', 'work', 'three', 'years', 'get', 'title', 'land', 'course', 'thousands', 'applicants', 'also', 'sanity', 'hearing', 'cousin', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'money', 'instead', 'Deeds', 'rather', 'cousin', 'greedy', 'wife', 'final', 'scene', 'sanity', 'hearing', 'being', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'not', 'only', 'declared', 'sane', 'girl.This', 'classic', 'feel-good', 'humor', 'grace', 'charm', 'made', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'famous']",Mr Deeds Goes to Town VHS

491828,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B0000049FK,Bobby Underwood,"[54, 55]","It was in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town that Frank Capra perfected the blend of comedy and social commentary that would become his trademark. The screwball comedy was graceful rather than frantic and the social elements of Robert Riskin's fine screenplay are handled in an even-handed manner that earned Capra the second of his three Acadamy Awards for Best Director. Both Gary Cooper as the tuba playing no nonsense Longfellow Deeds and Jean Arthur as the reporter who exploits him until she falls for his goodness are wonderful in this true Capra classic.Longfellow Deeds (Cooper) lives in the small town of Mandrake Falls where he makes a living writing greeting card poems and spends his free time playing the tuba. He is less than enthused when a bunch of big city attorneys show up at his door to tell him he has just inherited 20 million dollars from a relative he never met. The law firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington just want him to sign over his power of attorney and Deeds goes to the city with them mainly so he can get a look at Grant's Tomb.Deeds is honest and good but no pushover and his initial reluctance about the situation proves wise as everyone wants to mooch off of Deeds and make a fool of him at the same time. Deeds gives as good as he gets and wins over the crusty Cornelius Cobb (Lionell Stander) to his way of doing things but can't get around the way a certain Louise Bennet is mocking his every escapade in the papers, making him look a fool and a country bumpkin.But Deeds knows it doesn't matter when he meets the sweet Mary Dawson (Jean Arthur), a lady in distress who becomes his constant companion. Deeds no longer has to go off by himself like he did back home and talk to an imaginary girl because his dream girl has finally appeared for real. He tells Mary that she makes up for all the fakes he's met and writes a poem to her telling her how much he loves her. The problem, of course, is that Mary Dawson and this Louise Bennet who has christened him the Cinderella Man in all the papers are one and the same.Arthur is wonderful as the cynical reporter who slowly realizes that Longfellow is good, straightforward and honest. She realizes it is the viewpoint of everyone else that is distorted. Before she can get to him to make her confession, however, Cobb breaks the bad news to Deeds and his faith in everything is lost. He is ready to pack it up and head back to Mandrake Falls until a starving farmer breaks into his home and gives Deeds an idea. It is the depression and Deeds' plan to give those down and out a chance to fend for themselves and get back on their feet will take evey penny he has, which is just what he wants.But the same attorneys who courted him before, now try to prevent the noble Deeds from doing a noble deed and attempt to have him declared insane. It is the last straw for Longfellow, who shuts down completely, refusing to even defend his actions at his hearing. It is only when in an outburst from Arthur he learns she really does love him that he comes alive and gives them what for. As Cobb says earlier in the film, ""lamb bites wolf!""This is another great Capra film that shows it is the ""average"" fellow who really represents our values and mores as a people and a country, while entertaining us like no other director could. In addition to the constant joke about the name Budington throughout the film, because Deeds can't find a rhyme for it, it is also an ""in"" joke; the original story adapted by Riskin was written by Clarance Budington Kelland!Cooper and Arthur are memorable together and you will definitely get choked up when she reads Longfellow's poem about her on the steps of her apartment. Arthur does, because the words he has said earlier to a group of published poets making fun of him echo in her heart: ""I guess it's alright to hurt someone as long as you don't care how much you hurt them.""Sony is putting out this newly remastered edition which has audio commentary, a featurette, the trailer, and vintage ads. The cover art looks the same but is in color this time, making an attractive display for film buffs. I still have an older TV and really saw nothing wrong with the previous editions of this wonderful classic, not being that picky, so will leave this area to those more qualified in regards to the technical aspects.If all the great Capra classics were represented by a vase full of red roses, this would be the one white rose in the center. It is flawless and pure, and represents everything that was special about the films of the first director allowed to have his name above the title.

The Capra ""corn"" is piled on thick, with such scenes as the one at Grant's Tomb almost obligatory in a Capra picture. Cooper and Arthur perform wonderfully, though, and the supporting cast is at its best, too.Strange note (to me, anyway): Where here Deeds says nothing in his defense at the end, Jimmy Stewart in the similarly sounding MR.

This is false, but it gives cover for bad critics who just recycle old blurbs and tendencies about the artist. Think of the unthinking and fawning that goes on in discussions of Shakespeare. Yes, he was a great writer, but all but a dozen or so of his sonnets were mediocre tongue-twisters, and two thirds of his thirty-seven known plays were mediocre to terrible, so by being uncritical one actually diminishes the great art produced, for an uncritical stance makes it seem as if the touching of greatness is a product alien to all but the blessed. In short, it negates the hard work that all great endeavors require.This thought was ubiquitous as I watched the 1936 black and white Frank Capra classic film Mr. Deeds Goes To Washington. The film was adapted from a story, Opera Hat, by Clarence Budington Kelland, by longtime Capra collaborator, and dialogue expert, Robert Riskin. It's a good film, to be sure, as all Capra fare is, but it's not in a league with It's A Wonderful Life, nor even his earlier Oscar-winning classic, It Happened One Night. It lacks the overall depth of the former- and is far more preachy, and, in comparison to the latter, it lacks the quick pacing and tart-tongued dialogue, as it clocks in at 115 minutes in length.This film was, in many ways, a precursor to the later Capra-Cooper film, Meet John Doe, as both films feature rags to riches tales in which men are manipulated by the women they love. This film, however, is not as bleak as the later film. Yet, despite the use of many familiar tropes, what sets Capra apart from lesser directors are his believable lesser characters- all of whom get moments to shine, as well as the peerless dialogue. Add to that Capra's relentless glare at his leading actors' characterizations, and his films- which with lesser directors would have truly been the cornfests his worst critics claim, are ones always presented with a grittiness that could be from later films noir, in the midst of the feelgoodery....

Based on the 1935 short story ""Opera Hat"" by Clarence Budington Kelland, serialized in the Saturday Evening Post, the script was written by Robert Riskin in his fifth collaboration with Frank Capra. Capra won his second Academy Award for Directing for Mr Deeds Goes to Town, while Cooper received the first of his five nominations for Best Actor. At the end of the year, the New York Film Critics and the National Board of Review named ""Mr Deeds"" the ""Best Picture of 1936.""Capra's ""first, last and only choice"" for the pivotal role of the eccentric Longfellow Deeds was Gary Cooper. Due to Cooper's other commitments, production was delayed by six months, incurring costs of $100,000. Jean Arthur was not the first choice for the role, but Carole Lombard. Capra ""discovered"" his heroine in a rush screening. The opening sequences had to be reshot when Capra decided against the ""broad"" comedy approach that had originally been written. Compared to their unsatisfactory performance later in the year in the The Plainsman (cf my review 131us of 13/8/2012), Cooper and Arthur both do very well, though also here, Arthur remains the weaker partner.Mr Deeds Goes to Town was the first Capra film to be released separately to exhibitors and not ""bundled"" with other Columbia features. On paper, it was his biggest hit, easily surpassing It Happened One Night. The film was generally treated as likable fare by critics and audiences alike. Noted British writer and reviewer Graham Greene was effusive that this was Capra's finest film to date, describing Capra's treatment as ""a kinship with his audience, a sense of common life, a morality..."" Variety noted ""a sometimes too thin structure [that] the players and director Frank Capra have contrived to convert (...) into fairly sturdy substance.""Cast: Gary Cooper as Longfellow Deeds, Jean Arthur as Louise ""Babe"" Bennett/ Mary Dawson, George Bancroft as MacWade, Lionel Stander as Cornelius Cobb, Douglass Dumbrille as John Cedar, Raymond Walburn as Walter, H B Warner as Judge May, Ruth Donnelly as Mabel Dawson, Walter Catlett as Morrow, John Wray as Farmer.136us - Mr Deeds Goes to Town (Frank Capra, 1936, 115') - 17/8/2012",5,"A classic, fresh as ever",1345075200,"08 16, 2012",2012,2448,"['Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', 'Frank', 'Capra', '1936', '115', 'American', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'Longfellow', 'Deeds', 'simple-hearted', 'Vermont', 'tuba', 'player', 'fortune', 'contend', 'opportunist', 'city', 'slickers', 'starring', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'first', 'featured', 'role', 'Based', '1935', 'short', 'story', 'Opera', 'Hat', 'Clarence', 'Budington', 'Kelland', 'serialized', 'Saturday', 'Evening', 'Post', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Robert', 'Riskin', 'fifth', 'collaboration', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Capra', 'won', 'second', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Directing', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', 'Cooper', 'received', 'first', 'five', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Actor', 'end', 'year', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Critics', 'National', 'Board', 'Review', 'named', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Best', 'Picture', '1936', 'Capra', 'first', 'last', 'only', 'choice', 'pivotal', 'role', 'eccentric', 'Longfellow', 'Deeds', 'was', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Due', 'Cooper', 'other', 'commitments', 'production', 'was', 'delayed', 'six', 'months', 'incurring', 'costs', '100,000', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'choice', 'role', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'Capra', 'discovered', 'heroine', 'rush', 'screening', 'opening', 'sequences', 'had', 'be', 'reshot', 'when', 'Capra', 'decided', 'broad', 'comedy', 'approach', 'had', 'originally', 'been', 'written', 'Compared', 'unsatisfactory', 'performance', 'later', 'year', 'Plainsman', 'cf', 'review', '131us', '13/8/2012', 'Cooper', 'Arthur', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'here', 'Arthur', 'weaker', 'partner.Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', 'was', 'first', 'Capra', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'separately', 'exhibitors', 'not', 'bundled', 'other', 'Columbia', 'features', 'paper', 'was', 'biggest', 'hit', 'easily', 'surpassing', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'film', 'was', 'generally', 'treated', 'likable', 'fare', 'critics', 'audiences', 'alike', 'Noted', 'British', 'writer', 'reviewer', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'was', 'effusive', 'was', 'Capra', 'finest', 'film', 'date', 'describing', 'Capra', 'treatment', 'kinship', 'audience', 'sense', 'common', 'life', 'morality', 'Variety', 'noted', 'sometimes', 'too', 'thin', 'structure', 'players', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'have', 'contrived', 'convert', 'fairly', 'sturdy', 'substance', 'Cast', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Longfellow', 'Deeds', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Louise', 'Babe', 'Bennett/', 'Mary', 'Dawson', 'George', 'Bancroft', 'MacWade', 'Lionel', 'Stander', 'Cornelius', 'Cobb', 'Douglass', 'Dumbrille', 'John', 'Cedar', 'Raymond', 'Walburn', 'Walter', 'H', 'B', 'Warner', 'Judge', 'May', 'Ruth', 'Donnelly', 'Mabel', 'Dawson', 'Walter', 'Catlett', 'Morrow', 'John', 'Wray', 'Farmer.136us', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', 'Frank', 'Capra', '1936', '115', '17/8/2012']",Mr Deeds Goes to Town VHS
491842,AYKV6QGDOTW31,B0000049FK,Eduardo Middleton K.,"[3, 3]","How fresh can a movie stay after more than 60 years? It seems that Capra had the formula for eternal freshness. You need an extremely skillful hand to direct Cooper, Arthur and company in a movie that's been immitated but  never surpassed.  The first key for success here is the director. Capra  focused on values rather than politics as a leif motiv and never  surrendered. His obsession for Americana and the way its ideals should move  us is a constant in his work.  Also very important was casting. The  stereotypes that everybody are playing here make believable, or lovable,  roles and that adds significantly to the movie. Furthermore, the thrust  given by the screwball tone delivered by the movie makes us think about all  the social implicancies of theme more than Chaplin's Modern Times, just to  name one. There are some scenes, such as the trial or the aides playing  with the mansion''s echo, that would still work today. In fact, almost all  the script would work today. Regretfully, we don't have stars that could  measure up to it and an eventual remake would be done by Jim Carrey or some  hot shot comedian who would blow it out of proportions.

491843,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0000049FK,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","This is ""Capra-corn"" at its most sublime as this 1936 comedy is still one of the legendary director's best works due primarily to the sterling, career-defining performances of Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur. In the 1930's and 40's, Frank Capra's oeuvre was the humanistic picture, inspirational to the common folk reeling from the Great Depression and later World War II. Written by his frequent (and later quite embittered) collaborator, Robert Riskin, this was his first film fully in this direction after his Oscar-winning success with the quintessential runaway heiress comedy, 1934'sIt Happened One Night. It's intriguing to know that Capra only made this film because he could not start production on the far more ambitiousLost Horizonas scheduled and fit this in only when Cooper became available for the title role.Cooper portrays Longfellow Deeds, a young poet and volunteer fireman in a small Vermont town who suddenly inherits $20 million, a huge fortune at the time, from a distant uncle who died in an automobile crash in Italy. Having never been outside of his hometown, Deeds is thrust into the limelight and moves to Manhattan to take care of his uncle's estate and related business interests. The first half has all the trappings of a ""fish out of water"" situation (which Capra pretty much perfected with this film), but it doesn't take Deeds long to figure out that the people around him are not as sincere as they want him to think. One exception, he believes, is Mary Dawson, a small-town girl looking for a job before she faints from hunger. He falls in love with her not realizing that she is really ace reporter Babe Bennett out to land a juicy newspaper story about Deeds' ""Cinderella Man"" exploits. Tired of the selfish cynicism surrounding him, Deeds gives away his fortunes to establish a program to help poor farmers. In response, his advisors attempt to have him put away for insanity.Previously a stoic straight arrow in primarily westerns and female-oriented weepies, Cooper emerges here as a multi-dimensional leading man with a deft comedy touch, while the throaty-voiced Arthur (in a role abandoned by no less than Carole Lombard) shows her natural &eacute;lan as a tough newspaperwoman who discovers her vulnerability thanks to Deeds' magnanimous gestures. It's no wonder these two returned to Capra's hands in subsequent features - he inMeet John Doe, she inYou Can't Take It With YouandMr. Smith Goes to Washington. The top-notch supporting cast is headed by Lionel Stander as Deeds' confidante (a role similar to the agent he played in the 1937A Star Is Born); H.B. Warner as the sympathetic Judge May (who would later return to Capra forLost Horizonas the wizened Chang and forIt's A Wonderful Lifeas the drunken druggist who slaps George on his deaf ear); and Douglass Dumbrille as the nasty Cedar. The 2006 DVD has a scene-specific commentary track, fairly interesting, from the director's son, Frank Capra, Jr., who is also featured in a ten-minute short about the film. Several vintage trailers of the senior Capra's films are included though surprisingly not one for Deeds.",5,"A Most Sublime Piece of ""Capra-Corn"" with Cooper and Arthur at Their Youthful Zenith",1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,3114,"['Capra-corn', 'most', 'sublime', '1936', 'comedy', 'still', 'one', 'legendary', 'director', 'best', 'works', 'due', 'primarily', 'sterling', 'career-defining', 'performances', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Jean', 'Arthur', '1930', '40', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'oeuvre', 'was', 'humanistic', 'picture', 'inspirational', 'common', 'folk', 'reeling', 'Great', 'Depression', 'later', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Written', 'frequent', 'later', 'quite', 'embittered', 'collaborator', 'Robert', 'Riskin', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'fully', 'direction', 'Oscar-winning', 'success', 'quintessential', 'runaway', 'heiress', 'comedy', ""1934'sIt"", 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'intriguing', 'know', 'Capra', 'only', 'made', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'start', 'production', 'far', 'more', 'ambitiousLost', 'Horizonas', 'scheduled', 'fit', 'only', 'when', 'Cooper', 'became', 'available', 'title', 'role.Cooper', 'Longfellow', 'Deeds', 'young', 'poet', 'volunteer', 'fireman', 'small', 'Vermont', 'town', 'who', 'suddenly', '20', 'million', 'huge', 'fortune', 'time', 'distant', 'uncle', 'who', 'died', 'automobile', 'crash', 'Italy', 'Having', 'never', 'been', 'hometown', 'Deeds', 'thrust', 'limelight', 'moves', 'Manhattan', 'take', 'care', 'uncle', 'estate', 'related', 'business', 'interests', 'first', 'half', 'trappings', 'fish', 'water', 'situation', 'Capra', 'pretty', 'much', 'perfected', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'Deeds', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'sincere', 'want', 'think', 'One', 'exception', 'Mary', 'Dawson', 'small-town', 'girl', 'looking', 'job', 'hunger', 'love', 'not', 'realizing', 'really', 'ace', 'reporter', 'Babe', 'Bennett', 'land', 'juicy', 'newspaper', 'story', 'Deeds', 'Cinderella', 'Man', 'Tired', 'selfish', 'cynicism', 'surrounding', 'Deeds', 'away', 'fortunes', 'establish', 'program', 'help', 'poor', 'farmers', 'response', 'advisors', 'attempt', 'have', 'put', 'away', 'insanity.Previously', 'stoic', 'straight', 'arrow', 'primarily', 'westerns', 'female-oriented', 'weepies', 'Cooper', 'here', 'multi-dimensional', 'leading', 'man', 'deft', 'comedy', 'touch', 'throaty-voiced', 'Arthur', 'role', 'abandoned', 'less', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'natural', 'eacute', 'tough', 'newspaperwoman', 'who', 'vulnerability', 'thanks', 'Deeds', 'magnanimous', 'gestures', 'wonder', 'two', 'returned', 'Capra', 'hands', 'subsequent', 'features', 'John', 'Doe', 'inYou', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'YouandMr', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'top-notch', 'supporting', 'cast', 'headed', 'Lionel', 'Stander', 'Deeds', 'confidante', 'role', 'similar', 'agent', 'played', '1937A', 'Star', 'Is', 'Born', 'H.B', 'Warner', 'sympathetic', 'Judge', 'May', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'return', 'Capra', 'forLost', 'Horizonas', 'wizened', 'Chang', 'forIt', 'Wonderful', 'Lifeas', 'drunken', 'druggist', 'who', 'George', 'deaf', 'ear', 'Douglass', 'Dumbrille', 'nasty', 'Cedar', '2006', 'DVD', 'scene-specific', 'commentary', 'track', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'director', 'son', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Jr.', 'who', 'also', 'featured', 'ten-minute', 'short', 'film', 'Several', 'vintage', 'trailers', 'senior', 'Capra', 'films', 'are', 'included', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'one', 'Deeds']",Mr Deeds Goes to Town VHS

Remakes are made for three reasons, in my opinion: a director sees a good concept that is carried out badly and wants to improve it, a director wants to honor a movie he likes, or HOLLYWOOD HAS NO NEW IDEAS SO DECIDES TO REMAKE A CLASSIC! Okay, this is somewhat off topic, but the point is that in the case of Mr. Deeds it has to be the third option because there is NO WAY the original can be improved upon.This is how highly I rate this movie (also, if an improvement were to be made, it would not be made by casting Adam Sandler, of all people, as Mr. Deeds - the part is NOT AT ALL right for him).Anyhow, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is essentially the story of a small town boy (Gary Cooper) who inherits a fortune and then decides to give it away to the poor. He is charged with being insane as a result and is forced to prove his sanity in court (which he does in a priceless scene). Also, he meets a seemingly innocent girl (Jean Arthur) who is actually a reporter trying to get a story on him, which complicates matters to some extent.This is one of Capra's masterpieces.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[6, 6]","IN A NUTSHELL: A 1936 ROMANTIC COMEDY THAT IS STILL RELEVANTTODAYGary Cooper and Jean Arthur are incredibly effective and believable as quite an odd couple in this serio-comic treatment of idealism versus cynicism in the form of the small town iconoclast versus the big city. Together, the pair are the embodiment of the Capra depiction of the grand virtues of the simple country folk pitted against the unnatural and decadent evils of the modern city.However, in this story, like most of Capra's there is a way out for all of us in this film, and a way for us individually to empathize with the characters and the plight of society as a whole as it staggered through the 'Great Depression'.MR. DEEDS & THE GREAT DEPRESSION:Just when one might be thinking okay, I have been watching this film for an hour and I know how it is going to turn out, Mr. Deeds takes a hard turn to the LEFT! In this seemingly extraneous subplot, lies the true meaning of this film, as we discover that Mr. Deeds is much more than just another 'boy meets girl' film with a few bumps thrown in on the way to the altar. That's because Deeds is a better man than that and can't be so easily defeated. Of course, this is a parody of 1936 society which had been in a real depression for 7 years already.Yes, Mr. Deeds does draw a great deal of empathy from modern viewers as he plays the knight in shining armor from a by-gone era, looking for his damsel in distress in New York City. Rather than just brooding over it, Longfellow Deeds does something drastic about, drastic enough for his sanity to come into question. In this questioning of Deeds' sanity, Babe Bennett [Jean Arthur] is given the opportunity, which see puts to good use, to earn back Longfellow Deeds' trust and so illustrate that perhaps none of us is beyond redemption. Now isn't that a promising idea?--*THE PRINCIPAL CASTGary Cooper  - Longfellow DeedsJean Arthur  - Babe BennettGeorge Bancroft  - MacWadeLionel Stander  - Cornelius CobbDouglas Dumbrille  - John CedarRaymond Walburn  - WalterH.B.

In fact Gary Cooper simply does a better job of acting than Stewart does in Mr. Smith.Then there are the villains.

It's great to see a firm of ethically-challenged lawyers and ridiculous psychiatrists get their commuppance.Gary Cooper is sublime in this role.  I've read every reader's review here and no one has mentioned how gorgeous he is!  So I will:  He is GORGEOUS! He personifies the good guy from the small Vermont town, who's not as much of a bumpkin as folks would like to think.  True, he is a bit pixillated and that's definitely to his favor.  Pixies fled New York City a long time ago and look at the mess it's in!The whole film is entertaining but there are a few scenes that stood out in my mind:  first, when Deeds plays his bass tuba part as the town band plays farewell to him as he boards the train.  Then, when he ""conducts"" the three stuffy servants in an impromptu echo trio in marble hallway of his mansion.  Then, another musical one, when he and ""Mary"" form a duet on a park bench in the city, with Mary playing ""Swanee River"" on ""drums"" and Deeds oom-pah-ing ""Humouresque.""

491863,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0000049FK,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","Mr Deed Goes to Town(Released April/36)which won an Academy award for best director,stars Gary Cooper and the(real life)ever-capricious Jean Arthur,in the roles that really put both of them on the fast track to stardom.Cooper was a perfect fit to play the hometown""hick"" of Longfellow Deeds,with that stoic,homespun innocence that he could project on a dime.Arthur plays her role wonderfully as the coloured and cynical NYC street reporter,who has earned her rep off the backs of those she has thrown under the bus numerous times.The plot involves Cooper who is the hometown ""poet laureate"",so to speak.He devises and writes poems for greeting cards on a regular basis.In his off times he plays tuba in the local band and is a volunteer fire captain.Off in faraway Italy an uncle,whom he has had little to do with his entire life,dies in an auto accident and bequeaths his substantial fortune of $20 million to him alone.The uncle's attorney's switch into high gear in NYC and are determined to get his signature on paper so they may become his legal reps;so they may take him for all he is now worth.They personally bring him to NYC,trying to coerce him every step of the way to sign them up.Soon Deeds is slowly but surely being inundated with either claims to his fortune and/or people who just plain want what he has.The newspapers are extremely curious as to what this guy is all about and they assign their toughest reporter to the case,Arthur.She gets in solid with Cooper who at first does not suspect a thing,as headline after headline appears in the paper each day,detailing his latest exploits.Over time Arthur falls for Cooper,and visa versa,but Arthur is having second thoughts about the whole thing.Before she can explain herself and finally come clean to Deeds,he finds out,and is naturally devastated.Also around this time Deeds comes close to becoming a walking piece of Swiss Cheese when a down and outer(remember,this is the Depression)who is desperate and hungry,waives a gun his way.He ends up feeding the man and decides then and there to give his money away by purchasing some land and giving around 2,000 people the chance to farm and eventually own it.The attorneys who have been so eager to sign him up,now turn on him and he is arrested and put on trial as insane.At the hearing he is at first reluctant to say anything,much to the chagrin of his many new found friends who attend in droves,along with Arthur and her editor.Just as it looks the bleakest Deeds finally relents and testifies.His words dispel the myths and lies of others and he is eventually free of all charges.Deeds is carried out by his throng of friends as Arthur sits and cries.In a few moments Deeds rushes back into the courtroom,locking its doors behind him.He picks up Arthur and they kiss as the camera fades out.As the films two mains stars are as believable as apple pie,so are its myriad of co stars.Douglass Dumbrille as the nasty attorney,Lionel Stander as Coopers ""guard"",HB Warner as the judge,Ruth Donnelly as Arthurs roommate,and so many others.Watch for ex Keystone comics Bobby Dunn and Billy Bevan in uncredited roles.It is a solid supporting cast from A-Z.This is one of those rare films where the most important elements,the cast and its chemistry and the plot on hand,just seem to meld together in perfect harmony.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp,but this is a film that,and it is hard to believe, had to be restored,not by the very company who owned it,but by the Library of Congress.As with many films of this period that were later loaned out to TV,the film's prints and negatives became over used and truncated and fell into a terrible state of disrepair.One cannot fathom letting films of this quality go into such disuse but they have and we have lost an untold number this way,and by such major studios who have grossly under estimated the value of what they have had and/or have been cash strapped and sold the negatives for their intrinsic value.Whatever the case here,we are very fortunate some agency stepped in to preserve this classic film from obscurity.So when you watch this you will see some inherent defects such as graininess,slight scratching and emulsion deterioration.It says it has been remastered but it needs a better treatment than what we have here. Extras include commentary,a short featurette with Frank Capra's son,trailers and theatre posters.In conclusion you couldn't ask for a better film.This is Capra at his best and it showcases its stars to the hilt.With a wonderful supporting cast and plot it's a winner all the way.Recommended.",5,"Will this hometown""hick""get the better of NYC?",1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,4601,"['Mr', 'Deed', 'Goes', 'Town', 'Released', 'April/36', 'won', 'Academy', 'award', 'best', 'director', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'real', 'life', 'ever-capricious', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'roles', 'really', 'put', 'fast', 'track', 'stardom.Cooper', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'play', 'hometown', 'hick', 'Longfellow', 'Deeds', 'stoic', 'homespun', 'innocence', 'could', 'project', 'dime.Arthur', 'role', 'wonderfully', 'coloured', 'cynical', 'NYC', 'street', 'reporter', 'who', 'earned', 'rep', 'backs', 'thrown', 'bus', 'numerous', 'times.The', 'plot', 'Cooper', 'who', 'hometown', 'poet', 'laureate', 'so', 'speak.He', 'devises', 'poems', 'greeting', 'cards', 'regular', 'basis.In', 'off', 'times', 'tuba', 'local', 'band', 'volunteer', 'fire', 'captain.Off', 'faraway', 'Italy', 'uncle', 'whom', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'entire', 'life', 'auto', 'accident', 'bequeaths', 'substantial', 'fortune', '20', 'million', 'alone.The', 'uncle', 'attorney', 'switch', 'high', 'gear', 'NYC', 'are', 'determined', 'get', 'signature', 'paper', 'may', 'become', 'legal', 'reps', 'may', 'take', 'now', 'worth.They', 'personally', 'bring', 'NYC', 'trying', 'coerce', 'step', 'way', 'sign', 'up.Soon', 'Deeds', 'slowly', 'surely', 'being', 'inundated', 'claims', 'fortune', 'and/or', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'plain', 'want', 'what', 'newspapers', 'are', 'extremely', 'curious', 'what', 'guy', 'assign', 'toughest', 'reporter', 'case', 'Arthur.She', 'solid', 'Cooper', 'who', 'first', 'not', 'suspect', 'thing', 'headline', 'headline', 'paper', 'day', 'detailing', 'latest', 'exploits.Over', 'time', 'Arthur', 'Cooper', 'visa', 'versa', 'Arthur', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'whole', 'can', 'explain', 'finally', 'come', 'clean', 'Deeds', 'out', 'naturally', 'devastated.Also', 'time', 'Deeds', 'close', 'becoming', 'walking', 'piece', 'Swiss', 'Cheese', 'when', 'down', 'outer', 'remember', 'Depression', 'who', 'desperate', 'hungry', 'gun', 'way.He', 'up', 'feeding', 'man', 'then', 'there', 'give', 'money', 'away', 'purchasing', 'land', 'giving', 'around', '2,000', 'people', 'chance', 'farm', 'eventually', 'own', 'it.The', 'attorneys', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'eager', 'sign', 'up', 'now', 'turn', 'arrested', 'put', 'trial', 'insane.At', 'hearing', 'first', 'reluctant', 'say', 'anything', 'much', 'chagrin', 'many', 'new', 'found', 'friends', 'who', 'attend', 'droves', 'Arthur', 'editor.Just', 'bleakest', 'Deeds', 'finally', 'relents', 'testifies.His', 'words', 'dispel', 'myths', 'lies', 'others', 'eventually', 'free', 'charges.Deeds', 'carried', 'out', 'throng', 'friends', 'Arthur', 'sits', 'cries.In', 'few', 'moments', 'rushes', 'back', 'courtroom', 'locking', 'doors', 'him.He', 'up', 'Arthur', 'kiss', 'camera', 'films', 'two', 'mains', 'stars', 'are', 'as', 'believable', 'apple', 'pie', 'so', 'are', 'myriad', 'co', 'stars.Douglass', 'Dumbrille', 'nasty', 'attorney', 'Lionel', 'Stander', 'Coopers', 'guard', 'HB', 'Warner', 'judge', 'Ruth', 'Donnelly', 'Arthurs', 'roommate', 'so', 'many', 'others.Watch', 'ex', 'Keystone', 'comics', 'Bobby', 'Dunn', 'Billy', 'Bevan', 'uncredited', 'roles.It', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'A-Z.This', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', 'most', 'important', 'elements', 'cast', 'chemistry', 'plot', 'hand', 'just', 'seem', 'meld', 'together', 'perfect', 'harmony.Technically', 'speaking', 'film', 'clear', 'crisp', 'film', 'hard', 'believe', 'had', 'be', 'restored', 'not', 'very', 'company', 'who', 'owned', 'Library', 'Congress.As', 'many', 'films', 'period', 'were', 'later', 'loaned', 'out', 'TV', 'film', 'prints', 'negatives', 'became', 'used', 'truncated', 'fell', 'terrible', 'state', 'disrepair.One', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'letting', 'films', 'quality', 'go', 'such', 'disuse', 'have', 'have', 'lost', 'untold', 'number', 'way', 'such', 'major', 'studios', 'who', 'have', 'grossly', 'estimated', 'value', 'what', 'have', 'had', 'and/or', 'have', 'been', 'cash', 'strapped', 'sold', 'negatives', 'intrinsic', 'case', 'here', 'are', 'very', 'fortunate', 'agency', 'stepped', 'preserve', 'classic', 'film', 'obscurity.So', 'when', 'watch', 'will', 'see', 'inherent', 'defects', 'such', 'graininess', 'slight', 'scratching', 'emulsion', 'deterioration.It', 'been', 'remastered', 'better', 'treatment', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'short', 'featurette', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'son', 'trailers', 'theatre', 'posters.In', 'conclusion', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'film.This', 'Capra', 'best', 'stars', 'hilt.With', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'plot', 'winner', 'way.Recommended']",Mr Deeds Goes to Town VHS
491864,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000049FK,Robert Moore,"[4, 6]","I love Frank Capra's 1930s films. They are on the one hand so clearly products of their time, which was the period of the New Deal and a sense of optimism and idealism about whether America could overcome its problems and bring about a better life for most Americans. And, it was the period of time immediately preceding WW II, which transformed America in general so profoundly, and no one less than Frank Capra. By his own admission, the war brought about a shift in Capra's social and political vision, from a Leftist position to a Rightist one. After the war, Capra was able to duplicate his pre-War success only once, with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Later in life, in his autobiography and after moving back to a leftist political position, Capra acknowledged that his shift to the Right marred his cinematic vision, and ruined him as a filmmaker.On one level, MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN is easy to criticize. It does espouse simplistic, naive beliefs about society and politics. It is anti-capitalist, whereas Capra's post-WW II films (excepting IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) were pro-business. The film does seem to suggest that there are simple answers to enormously complex problems. All this, however, enchants me. I wish that we today had not lost this capacity to have simple, goodhearted beliefs.Once one moves away from the social and political elements in this film, which are nonetheless quite strong (and the sentiments expressed here helped give rise to what is frequently referred to as ""Capra-corn""), one is left with a delightful, funny, and inspiring romantic comedy. Could any actor in the history of film have been more perfect as Longfellow Deeds? Well, perhaps Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda (certainly not Adam Sandler). But even those two stellar actors would have fallen short of Cooper in communicating his abject indifference to his fate during his trial late in the film. Having him in that role was a perfect bit of casting. Jean Arthur, one of Capra's two favorite actresses, was perfect as Babe Bennett (though his other favorite actress, Barbara Stanwyck, might have been even more perfect). The two make a perfect team: the idealistic, naive, and good hearted Deeds (though completely intolerant of bunk) and the cynical, cold hearted, manipulative undercover reporter whose heart is melted and transformed by Deeds. In a supporting role, Lionel Stander is outstanding.All in all, this is just a great film, and stands as one of Capra's finest efforts, definitely one of the five or six classic films he made upon which his reputation will always be preserved.There is an absolutely excreble version of the film, with Adam Sandler playing Deeds. The film is beyond than embarrassing. There are two reasons to engage in a remake. First, an earlier film contains excellent premises, but executed its own concepts poorly. Thus, a remake provides an opportunity to get it right. The 1941 version of THE MALTESE FALCON was actually a remake of an earlier version of the novel. The second reason to undertake a remake is when the filmmakers have no interesting or inventive ideas of their own, and pilfer those of others to rake in some box office. Since the original MR. DEEDS would be extremely difficult to improve upon, one wonders if this film is an example of reason number two. I should add that there is a third reason to engage in a remake: love of a previous film and to try and pay homage by remaking it. I believe that this is the case with the unsuccessful remake by Mel Brooks of TO BE OR NOT TO BE (why try to remake a perfect film?), the more successful CAPE FEAR (which was nearly as good as the original), or the high tech remake of PLANET OF THE APES.Bit of trivia: This was the only film that Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur made together. In 1942 Hitchcock wanted to reunite the two of them in SABOTEUR. He was unsuccessful; however, and instead cast Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane in the leads. The film today, despite some amazing scenes, is usually criticized for its very weak stars. One wonders how successful that film would have been if Hitchcock had managed to get the Gary and Jean.Second bit of trivia: Jean Arthur, although she always looks very calm and self-possessed, suffered from almost debilitating screen fright, frequently becoming nauseous before or during shooting. In fact, her career eventually ended when she was doing a stage version of BORN YESTERDAY, playing the Judy Holliday role. During the middle of the play, the stress became too much for her. She was unable to return to finish the play, and except for a unsuccessful attempt at a TV sitcom, her career was over.",5,Utterly delightful romantic/social comedy,1244246400,"06 6,

Please note:  simplistic is not the same as simple.  If you don't know the difference, look it up.The Great Depression, when this movie was made, certainly qualifies as complex.  Mr. Deeds' solution is a literal sock in the jaw for anyone who crosses him, and he never even gets arrested for assault.  In fact, the fisticuffs are treated humorously.  It's akin to Dirty Harry's solution to crime.  And Mr. Deeds tries to give away farms, purchased by the money he inherited from an uncle he scarcely knew existed.  For this, he is taken to court to test his sanity.  Naturally he tries to explain his way out of it, and I'm not giving away any great secret by saying that he is successful.  He gets the girl, socks the bad lawyer, and goes home happy as Ole Lonesome Rhodes.  It's all as simplistic as that.The director received an Academy Award for this draught of pablum, and I can't imagine why--except that in the ethos of 1935 this went down as smoothly as a vanilla milkshake.

The first time I saw this movie I couldn't believe how often he just slugged people who insulted or patronized him. The 1930s audiences, though, must have loved seeing the rich stuffed shirts getting theirs in such a direct way. You can quibble about some aspects of the plot line (I too couldn't believe he wouldn't see through Jean Arthur's trickery), but it doesn't take anything away from a great movie watching experience.

When he arrives in New York, he begins to reform though the people there expect him to follow their orders blindly. He falls in love with a reporter disguised as a damsel in distress (Jean Arthur) who uses him for a story. Deeds does many great things, but the people who want to use him deem him crazy in order to usurp his power.Cooper is wonderful in these wide-eyed innocent types of roles. He is tall and wears his strength well, which makes his sweetness all the more appealing. It is hard not to fall in love with his character and to wish that there really were people like him in the world.This film was re-made starring Adam Sandler and called Mr. Deeds.

Jean Arthur plays a similar character she played in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, where she sees some pleasantness in the naivety of the main character and falls for him.In Mr. Deeds however, she plays a tough news reporter who sets up this nave heir to a $20 million dollar fortune, pretends to be in love with him in order to get the scoop.  As she maligns him all over the newspapers and Deeds is getting  more and more depressed, he tells her that she is the only one who is trustworthy in this strange New York place.Since she's causing it, she feels like crap.  She tells her editor that she wants out and eventually does so.  Lawyers who want his money trump up charges of insanity and then take Deeds before an sanity hearing to get his money.  This interrupts Deeds' plan to create farm jobs for hundreds of homeless, out of work farmers.  This film was made during the Depression, so this topic would resonate with audiences.Unlike Mr. Smith, Mr. Deeds (played by Gary Cooper) has no clue as to his naivety. He does at times make some surprisingly intelligent decisions about his company that he is trying to run, but Gary does not have the verge of a Jimmy Stewart (Smith).What I really disliked about the film was how Deeds totally gives up and does not allow any kind of help from counsel and lets the court hearing run without any feedback from himself.  He could not care less that he will be locked up in a mental hospital.Several things wrong with that.  First, I understand how he feels being personally destroyed by a woman who he thought loved and trusted him and how the folks he's met were really after the bottom line and couldn't care less.  However second, without his help those farmers are going to be out of work for good.The character Deeds, whom I felt some sympathy, really lost it in my book.  He completely quit and let his enemies steamroll him.  And this went on and on and on, 20 minutes of this.  Dang!Finally when Arthur's character declares that she loves Deeds, then he snaps out of it.  Who cares if he throws hundreds of farmers out of a job and the bad guys get his money?Well the ending ended as these all do, on an upbeat.  But even Frank Capra's worst is still better than a lot of today's Hollywood films, so one can't complain that one would not be entertained.Mildly recommended!Capra Recommendations:The Premiere Frank Capra Collection (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington / It Happened One Night / You Can't Take It with You / Mr. Deeds Goes to Town / American Madness / Frank Capra's American Dream)American Vision: The Films of Frank Capra",4,"Weak Capra Comedy, Still Entertaining!",1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,2702,"['Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', 'bit', 'off-beat', 'humor', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'spirit', 'other', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'film', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'similar', 'character', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'where', 'pleasantness', 'naivety', 'main', 'character', 'falls', 'him.In', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'however', 'tough', 'news', 'reporter', 'who', 'up', 'nave', 'heir', '20', 'million', 'dollar', 'fortune', 'be', 'love', 'order', 'get', 'scoop', 'newspapers', 'Deeds', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'depressed', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'trustworthy', 'strange', 'New', 'York', 'place.Since', 'causing', 'crap', 'editor', 'out', 'eventually', 'so', 'Lawyers', 'who', 'want', 'money', 'trump', 'charges', 'insanity', 'then', 'take', 'Deeds', 'sanity', 'hearing', 'get', 'money', 'interrupts', 'Deeds', 'plan', 'create', 'farm', 'jobs', 'hundreds', 'homeless', 'work', 'farmers', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Depression', 'topic', 'would', 'resonate', 'audiences.Unlike', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'played', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'clue', 'naivety', 'times', 'make', 'surprisingly', 'intelligent', 'decisions', 'company', 'trying', 'run', 'Gary', 'not', 'have', 'verge', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Smith', '.What', 'really', 'disliked', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'Deeds', 'totally', 'up', 'not', 'allow', 'kind', 'help', 'counsel', 'court', 'hearing', 'run', 'feedback', 'could', 'not', 'care', 'less', 'will', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'mental', 'hospital.Several', 'things', 'wrong', 'First', 'understand', 'how', 'being', 'personally', 'destroyed', 'woman', 'who', 'thought', 'loved', 'trusted', 'how', 'folks', 'met', 'were', 'really', 'bottom', 'line', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'However', 'second', 'help', 'farmers', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'work', 'good.The', 'character', 'Deeds', 'whom', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'really', 'lost', 'book', 'completely', 'quit', 'let', 'enemies', 'steamroll', 'went', '20', 'minutes', 'Dang', 'Finally', 'when', 'Arthur', 'character', 'Deeds', 'then', 'Who', 'hundreds', 'farmers', 'job', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'money', 'Well', 'ending', 'ended', 'do', 'upbeat', 'even', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'worst', 'still', 'better', 'lot', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'entertained.Mildly', 'recommended', 'Capra', 'Recommendations', 'Premiere', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Collection', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', '/', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', '/', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', '/', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', '/', 'American', 'Madness', '/', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'American', 'Dream', 'American', 'Vision', 'Films', 'Frank', 'Capra']",Mr Deeds Goes to Town VHS

You are going to get the small town rube who rubs up against snobs and shows them how it's done. You get the rah rah Common Folk sermonizing and you get a populism that is very much a product of its era. In other words, just because he seems pretty progressive in regards to helping out poor people, don't expect that enlightened thinking to extend in all directions.In his best movies, he has a muse in Jimmy Stewart embodying that just plain folk wisdom with a charm and joy that gets the viewer over some of the more egregious bits.Unfortunately, this movie stars Gary Cooper. Gary Cooper is deadly dull. One of the greatest running jokes on The Sopranos was Tony Soprano wishing for a return to the good old days of the strong silent type embodied in Gary Cooper. Used well, Gary Cooper is great; however, the best way to use Gary Cooper well is as the strong silent type who stands up against the gangsters and defends his town. There are no shootouts in Frank Capra movies.Without a charming male lead, Jean Arthur is stuck holding up the entire movie and while she's great - especially at the beginning (the coin trick scene raised this review a star by itself) - she is stuck with the thankless part of the driven and successful career woman who falls in love with the lead and decides to throw away her career for a house in the suburbs. If you love His Girl Friday, you can consider her to be the anti-Rosalind Russell - or what would have happened to Rosalind Russel's character if she didn't have Cary Grant to push her into doing what she really loved doing.And even that wouldn't have been so bad if the male lead wasn't Gary Cooper. The two main actors have zero chemistry. Instead of a charming rube who is negotiating the big city and standing up for himself against the city slickers (the part that was written) Gary Cooper plays Mr Deeds like a humorless scold who sucks the life out of every exchange. When the opera company shows up, his &#34;you guys lose money, why should I give you everything&#34; is supposed to be charming and wise, but comes off like Ugly American Stereotype #3. By the end of the movie he is giving the great speech that proves that he's the sanest man in the room. Unfortunately every line is delivered like he's auditioning for a remake of The Ten Commandments with sonorous tones and pomposity. And yet the audience laughs at everything he says, because by this point in the editing process even Frank Capra must have realized that he had cast the most boring actor in Hollywood and decided to invent the laugh track.It doesn't work.Frank Capra had his share of populist leanings and white privilege and most of his movies are products of their time. However, &#34;a product of its time&#34; is not a shield against all criticism. Rather, the artwork needs to be good enough to get over the parts that have become rather cringe-worthy in the decades since (such as the bit where Ingrid Bergman calls Sam a boy and tells Humphrey Bogart to do the thinking for both of them in Casablanca). Most of the time, Frank Capra could get enough universal truths in his work to allow people to overlook the more egregious aspects.In this case, that is not happening. I don't know if this movie would have been a good movie or even a classic with Jimmy Stewart in the lead (it certainly was pretty bad with Adam Sandler) but it would have definitely would have been a lot better than the dull pompous thing foisted upon the world.",2,Gary Cooper is the black hole of sermonizing where all joy goes to die,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,3549,"['When', 'watching', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'movies', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'small', 'town', 'rube', 'who', 'up', 'snobs', 'how', 'done', 'get', 'rah', 'rah', 'Common', 'Folk', 'sermonizing', 'get', 'populism', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'era', 'other', 'words', 'just', 'pretty', 'progressive', 'regards', 'helping', 'out', 'poor', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'enlightened', 'thinking', 'extend', 'directions.In', 'best', 'movies', 'muse', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'embodying', 'just', 'plain', 'folk', 'wisdom', 'charm', 'joy', 'viewer', 'more', 'egregious', 'bits.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'deadly', 'dull', 'One', 'greatest', 'running', 'jokes', 'Sopranos', 'was', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'wishing', 'return', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'embodied', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Used', 'well', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'great', 'however', 'best', 'way', 'use', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'well', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'who', 'up', 'gangsters', 'town', 'are', 'shootouts', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'charming', 'male', 'lead', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'stuck', 'holding', 'up', 'entire', 'movie', 'great', 'especially', 'beginning', 'coin', 'trick', 'scene', 'raised', 'review', 'star', 'stuck', 'thankless', 'part', 'driven', 'successful', 'career', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'lead', 'decides', 'throw', 'away', 'career', 'house', 'suburbs', 'love', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'can', 'consider', 'be', 'anti-Rosalind', 'Russell', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Rosalind', 'Russel', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'push', 'doing', 'what', 'really', 'loved', 'doing.And', 'even', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'bad', 'male', 'lead', 'was', ""n't"", 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'have', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'Instead', 'charming', 'rube', 'who', 'negotiating', 'big', 'city', 'standing', 'up', 'city', 'slickers', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'humorless', 'scold', 'who', 'life', 'exchange', 'When', 'opera', 'company', 'up', '34', 'guys', 'lose', 'money', 'why', 'should', 'give', 'everything', '34', 'supposed', 'be', 'charming', 'wise', 'off', 'like', 'Ugly', 'American', 'Stereotype', '3', 'end', 'movie', 'giving', 'great', 'speech', 'sanest', 'man', 'room', 'Unfortunately', 'line', 'delivered', 'auditioning', 'remake', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'sonorous', 'tones', 'pomposity', 'yet', 'audience', 'everything', 'point', 'editing', 'process', 'even', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'must', 'have', 'realized', 'had', 'cast', 'most', 'boring', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'decided', 'invent', 'laugh', 'track.It', ""n't"", 'work.Frank', 'Capra', 'had', 'share', 'populist', 'leanings', 'white', 'privilege', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'products', 'time', 'However', '34', 'product', 'time', '34', 'not', 'shield', 'criticism', 'artwork', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'get', 'parts', 'have', 'become', 'rather', 'cringe-worthy', 'decades', 'such', 'bit', 'where', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Sam', 'boy', 'tells', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'do', 'thinking', 'Casablanca', 'Most', 'time', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'could', 'get', 'enough', 'universal', 'truths', 'work', 'allow', 'people', 'overlook', 'more', 'egregious', 'aspects.In', 'case', 'not', 'happening', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'classic', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'lead', 'certainly', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'would', 'have', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'dull', 'pompous', 'thing', 'foisted', 'world']",Mr Deeds Goes to Town VHS
491874,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,B0000049FK,"""weirdo_87""","[7, 8]","Even after retiring from showbiz, Frank Capra remained a very popular director until his death in 1991. His films allowed the audience to symphatize with the characters because they had a common theme of ordinary, likable (And often, small town) people being placed in extraordinary situations. Also, the main characters don't think much of what has happened to them, at least at the moment. For example, after being told he has inherited $20 million, Longfellow Deeds in Capra's 1936 comedy ""Mr. Deed's Goes to Town"" remarks ""What do I need that for"". And he goes back to playing his tuba. Another example is on the train ride to his new estate in New York: When asked what he's thinking about, it isn't the responsibility or wealth on his mind, but rather ""Who's going to be the new tuba player in the band back home"".Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur are both superb as the two leads. In his career-making role as Longfellow Deeds, Cooper plays it well as a dimwitted yet charming small town man who inherits his uncle's wealth following his death (Or suicide? You decide. Hey, that rhymes!) Arthur plays newspaper writer Louise ""Babe"" Bennett, who goes undercover to write articles on Deeds. She is originally hired to basically uncover dirt on Longfellow, which she does. But she finds herself falling in love with him and soon feels ashamed with degrading him. Her shame comes too late, though, for due in large part to her writing, Deeds is charged with insanity and put on trial (That and he puts up his whole fortune to help out poor farmers). Now, he has to defend against an overwhelming amount of evidence. However, as learned during the trial, Deeds wasn't insane. He just did peculiar things like all humans.There are several very funny scenes in the movie. One example is when Deeds, after chasing Walter the butler out of his room, yells at Walter to discover that the sound makes an echo. Soon, he and the other servants are making loud sounds and hearing them echo. Another funny scene is when Deeds, for the first time in his life, gets drunk and, according to Walter, fed donuts to a horse and took off his clothes yelling ""Back to nature"". But we never see the actual scene. That's something about this movie that current directors should pick up on: Some situations can be better, or in this case funnier, if left to our imagination. Its probably because of hindsight: When we look back at embarrassing situations we were in, we think differently of them then when they happened.About the only compliant I had with ""Mr. Deeds"" was in the way this film portrays the rich class. It's said that a movie can be shown as the way a director views the world. Capra must have had some bad experiences with wealthier people. In here, basically allthe richest men in New York, lead by the only other living relative of Deeds, want part of Longfellow's money, though they are wealthy enough. This plot is similar to Capra's later ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", where a naive senator has to fight crooked politicians who want the land he has set aside for a boyscout's camp. And it's similar in ways to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", where the manager of a Savings and Loans building has to prevent a wealthy businessman from taking it over. I can't speak for all the rich men of the world, but I assume there must be a few good ones who aren't greedy and, if they are unselfish, they don't come from a small town. I also think that it took Deeds a little long to find out who Babe Bennett really was; A news story about him appears every morning following a date with her, yet he can't put the two together.But that doesn't mean I don't like the movie. Being the critic that I am, I need to be fair and balanced. I think the movie is even better for tackling such lighthearted, simple and universal beliefs liked kindness and acceptance. I haven't seen the remake with Adam Sandler. I have nothing wrong with Sandler: Though he regularly plays the same guy in his movies, some of them have been funny. But from what I see on T.V ads, this remake seems to agree with today's belief that money makes you a great and happy person. As we learn here, that isn't always so. Deeds was a great man before he got all that money because he had character, integrity, honesty and dignity (Until ""Donut Gate"", that is). But tell me, how happier was he with all those millions? Instead, his longing for his home and friends in Mandrake Falls grows.
