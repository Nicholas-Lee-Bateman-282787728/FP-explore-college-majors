1321022,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B003498RRW,Amit Talpade,"[1, 2]","Tom ( Gael Garcia Bernal ) is a young computer game designer who has to leave his family to travel to Thailand to finish negotiating a lucrative contract with a group of investors,  he is married to Ellen ( Michelle Williams ) who is a busy surgeon herself. They have a small daughter who is taken care by a Filipino housekeeper Gloria ( Marife Necessito)Ellen is so dedicated to her job that she gets attached to a boy who is a stab victim and due to her long hours her daughter gets attached to her Filipino maid who showers love on her as if she were her own child.  This causes Ellen displeasure and jealousy. In the meantime, her own children in the Philippines miss her so badly that they beg her to come home and one of them suffers a tragic calamity. Luke on the other hand misses home and wants to come home but the contract negotiations drag on and he is forced to stay in Thailand longer than expected. He experiences a life changing experience which shakes his core and threatens his family bond.Mammoth refers to a pen made from the tusk of a mammoth which roamed the earth many centuries ago but are now extinct. I think the director was trying to draw an analogy to the bonds that kept us together as a family but are now on the danger of extinction. This film has been unfairly compared to Babel and Crash, it is not either; however the viewer will find some commonalities.Gael Garcia Bernal is as always superb, Michelle Williams is great, I loved her since  Wendy and Lucy. I think the best acting was from Gloria ( Marife Necesito) as the Filipino housekeeper. I liked the movie but the stars were Jan Nicdao as Salvador and Martin Delos Santos as Manuel who play Gloria sons. Their anguish and desperation as they wait for their mother to return home is truly heart wrenching. The scenes stay with you long after the credits have rolled.

As with every movie, the audience is going to bring their own lives to the theater with them and such is the case with me. I've spent time in both the Philippines and Thailand on business in the last few years, so there was a lot of this that I found very moving and I'm not sure whether I would have had the same reaction, say, 5 years ago.Let me say, it's beautifully filmed and the acting is superb. My only knocks against it were 1, the ending. And 2, the music. Using a popular song like Cat Power's ""The Greatest"" is hard because, again, the audience brings their own stuff to the movie. So when there are these songs that a viewer already has an emotional connection to and especially here where the song is used 3 or 4 different times... well, the emotion the director intended to evoke may be lost if you already have your own relationship with the music.

1321024,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003498RRW,Grady Harp,"[5, 8]","MAMMOTH is a sensitively written and directed film by Lukas Moodysson that adroitly traces three stories that all intertwine within the confines of one family.  It touches on many aspects of human relationships but the one driving force behind each of the several stories that are woven in this film is the importance of family.  It is a profoundly moving film beautifully brought to life by a fine cast of actors.Leo Vidales (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal in yet another role that proves he is one of the finest actors on the screen today, despite his young age) is a highly successful designer of video games, married to Ellen (Michelle Williams), a committed Physician and Surgeon, and parent to a vibrant little girl Jackie (Sophie Nyweide) who is devoted to her Filipino nanny Gloria (Marife Necesito) who is living with the Vidales to make money to send home to her treasured young sons Manuel (Martin Delos Santos) and Salvador (Jan David G. Nicdao) living in the Philippines with their grandmother (Maria Esmeralda del Carmen).  Leo's family unit is warm and secure (the only minor crack in the veneer is young Jackie's preference for spending time with the more available Gloria than with Ellen due to Ellen's long hours in the hospital).Leo is called to Thailand on a business trip to sell his ideas to Thai entrepreneurs and while there his business partner (Thomas McCarthy) suggests that he partake of the feminine charms readily available in this country.  Leo is faithful and declines advances from call girls but eventually gives in to a beautiful young Cookie (Natthamonkarn Srinikornchot) only to be driven by remorse to make a quick sell of his product to return to his family. Meanwhile at home Ellen is devastated by the death of one of her young patients and in her distress she must allow Gloria to return to the Philippines whose one son has been severely beaten in his attempt to gain more money for his family so that his mother needn't work in the USA.How the results of all these traumas resolve forms the touching ending of this moving story.While each of the actors mentioned is superb, Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal shines in a very subtle role as does Michelle Williams who manages to make Ellen credible without becoming saccharine.  Yes, if the story sounds a bit like another film in the style of Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu ('Babel') or Paul Haggis ('Crash'), then that is a fine comparison as this film is in many ways a more intimate version of that kind of storytelling.

I really can't say that for this particular movie so and so actor or actress was better. Everyone gave an incredible performance. My respects especially to Michelle Williams and the Filipino actress. Their pain as mothers was raw and palpable and if there is one think this movie has further taught me is to view people as individuals and leave preconceptions and stereotypes racially based out.  She was working in the US so that her children back home could have a better future. It is these people that are often underrepresented, the hard working ones, NOT the ones that come to live off governmental aid and create more problems. My highest admiration and respect  for these people, they deserve it!! Gael once again delivers a wonderful performance. HIGHLY recommended.I have read most of the comments here and I really DO NOT understand just what the Hell people want in a film. Comments like ""Nothing Special"" 'Didn't connect on a emotional level"" ""Overly Sentimental"" bring one question to mind; Have we become  that insensitive and apathetic?  Overly Sentimental and sappy?!! Seriously!!? A doctor crying b/c she connected on an emotional level with her patient is pointless?! A women crying over the fact that her children are far away is equally  pointless? A woman who sells her body for a living singing to her little daughter is sappy?!  I see that as being human and this movie reflects in a lot of ways the troubles in our current society/world. Count me any given day as sappy and overly sentimental if this is what this movie is considered.  If you really want to see silly, ridiculous, over the top acting and sappy and sentimentality at its very best there are plenty of ridiculous Hollywood so called ""romantic"" comedies out there to watch.

1321027,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003498RRW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 10]","I had quite looked forward to and expected to enjoy the ""Babel""-esque indie ""Mammoth.""  A big fan of the Swedish film ""Lilja 4-ever,"" I was eager to see writer/director Lukas Moodysson's first English speaking endeavor.  And yet, while I might acknowledge that ""Mammoth"" is a well made and well intentioned effort, there was something that was a bit dramatically inert.  I was never really drawn into the story, and when it tried for overt emotional connection (musical montage of overlapping characters, a heightened sense of danger and tragedy for the finale), those moments just didn't ring true.  It's unfortunate, I think Moodysson is undeniably talented--I think he just tried too hard to build a prestige piece instead of developing a more organic plot line.Telling four concurrent and interrelated stories, ""Mammoth"" follows an American businessman to Thailand, stays with his doctor wife in New York, explores the relationship between their daughter and her nanny, and depicts the nanny's family in the Philippines.  Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal, whom I like a lot, plays the father in this scenario and, unfortunately, the least convincing side to this square.  A self proclaimed former hippie,  Garc&iacute;a Bernal has become a success in the field of gaming and looks at the world with an innocence and optimism that made my head explode.  Really, he's like a idealistic six year old that has gone overseas to secure a 45 million dollar investment--it's really quite unsettling.  His foray into the Thailand culture may lead to temptations he will be unable to resist.  His wife, the always welcome Michelle Williams, struggles as an absentee parent and has a particularly hard hitting incident at the hospital.  Their daughter is forming a tight knit bond with the nanny (Sophie Nyweide and Marife Necesito respectively, both doing solid work).  And the nanny's son in the Philippines is learning to cope with his mother's absence while simultaneously strategizing to bring her home.We've certainly seen these globalization stories before--and, indeed, there is a familiarity here bordering on cliche.  Were it not for a strong and appealing cast, I might have been tempted to check out of ""Mammoth"" early.  The most interesting aspect of ""Mammoth"" is in the depiction of motherhood.  Even though Williams and Necesito couldn't be more dissimilar, they have both sacrificed a close bond with their children for the greater good.  These threads that depict the separation by necessity aspect of modern society are really the only time I connected emotionally with the film.  Then after close to two hours of introspection (with an unfortunate lack of forward momentum), Moodysson inexplicably layers on a melodramatic finale.  I didn't believe the story in the Philippines for one minute, had lost all patience for Garc&iacute;a Bernal, and thought Williams' trauma too convenient.  The movie then ground to a halt and the only character I had real sympathy for was the little girl.  So even investing the time, I felt a little chilly as ""Mammoth"" wrapped up.

1321030,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B003498RRW,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 8]","***1/2Written and directed by Lukas Moodysson, ""Mammoth"" is a melancholic indie feature showing how both those who have money and those who don't can be equally unhappy.  On a deeper level, it's also about how parents - mainly out of necessity but sometimes out of cruelty - often fail to provide their children with the care and nurturing they need to feel protected and loved.Leo (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Ellen (Michelle Williams) are a young married couple with a seven-year-old daughter (Sophie Nyweide) who live in a fancy loft in Soho.  Though a self-described ""hippie"" in his younger days, Leo has recently made it to the ""big time"" by turning his nerdish obsession with internet video games into a multimillion dollar enterprise.  But Leo can't quite adjust to being a part of the privileged classes, and he yearns for a simpler life focused on his family, something that seems to be becoming ever more difficult to achieve with his busy schedule.  Ellen works nights as an emergency room surgeon, which prevents her from spending the kind of quality time she would like with her daughter, Jackie, who, in turn, is becoming ever more attached to Gloria (Marife Necesito), her Filipina nanny.  Gloria, meanwhile, is heartbroken at the fact that she's had to leave her two little boys back in the Philippines to basically fend for themselves, while she earns enough money to build the house they will all one day live in.Leo and Ellen are united in their desire to do good in the world - Ellen, by patching up broken bodies and shattered lives, and Leo, by spreading his new-found wealth around to those in need.  In a way, they're finding their own means of helping to bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots in this world.  But at what cost to their family unit?The movie draws a distinct contrast between life in Manhattan and life in the Philippines, where Gloria's children live with the everlasting threat of poverty hanging over their heads, and Thailand, where Leo goes on a business trip and where his attraction to a beautiful native girl may ultimately prove too powerful to resist.Though at times it may seem meandering and insufficiently developed in terms of its storytelling, ""Mammoth"" finds its own strength in concentrating on those little moments of truth that form the essence of real life.  And even though there is a surfeit of musical-montage sequences running throughout the film, it is partly counteracted by a subtle, spare and haunting musical score that nicely accentuates the lyrical nature of the piece.  The last half hour, in particular, becomes a poetic and powerful account of people learning to prioritize their own lives in such a way as to be of the greatest value to both themselves and those around them.",3,dramatically flawed but often poetic look at parent/child relationships,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,2759,"['***1/2Written', 'directed', 'Lukas', 'Moodysson', 'Mammoth', 'melancholic', 'indie', 'feature', 'showing', 'how', 'who', 'have', 'money', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'can', 'be', 'equally', 'unhappy', 'deeper', 'level', 'also', 'how', 'parents', 'mainly', 'necessity', 'cruelty', 'often', 'fail', 'provide', 'children', 'care', 'nurturing', 'need', 'feel', 'protected', 'loved.Leo', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Ellen', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'are', 'young', 'married', 'couple', 'seven-year-old', 'daughter', 'Sophie', 'Nyweide', 'who', 'live', 'fancy', 'loft', 'Soho', 'self-described', 'hippie', 'younger', 'days', 'Leo', 'recently', 'made', 'big', 'time', 'turning', 'nerdish', 'obsession', 'internet', 'video', 'games', 'multimillion', 'dollar', 'enterprise', 'Leo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'adjust', 'being', 'part', 'privileged', 'classes', 'simpler', 'life', 'focused', 'family', 'something', 'be', 'becoming', 'ever', 'more', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'busy', 'schedule', 'Ellen', 'nights', 'emergency', 'room', 'surgeon', 'spending', 'kind', 'quality', 'time', 'would', 'like', 'daughter', 'Jackie', 'who', 'turn', 'becoming', 'ever', 'more', 'attached', 'Gloria', 'Marife', 'Necesito', 'Filipina', 'nanny', 'Gloria', 'meanwhile', 'heartbroken', 'fact', 'had', 'leave', 'two', 'little', 'boys', 'back', 'Philippines', 'basically', 'fend', 'enough', 'money', 'build', 'house', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'live', 'in.Leo', 'Ellen', 'are', 'united', 'desire', 'do', 'good', 'world', 'Ellen', 'patching', 'up', 'broken', 'bodies', 'shattered', 'lives', 'Leo', 'spreading', 'new-found', 'wealth', 'need', 'way', ""'re"", 'finding', 'own', 'means', 'helping', 'bridge', 'gap', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'world', 'what', 'cost', 'family', 'unit', 'movie', 'distinct', 'contrast', 'life', 'Manhattan', 'life', 'Philippines', 'where', 'Gloria', 'children', 'live', 'everlasting', 'threat', 'poverty', 'hanging', 'heads', 'Thailand', 'where', 'Leo', 'business', 'trip', 'where', 'attraction', 'beautiful', 'native', 'girl', 'may', 'ultimately', 'prove', 'too', 'powerful', 'resist.Though', 'times', 'may', 'seem', 'meandering', 'insufficiently', 'developed', 'terms', 'storytelling', 'Mammoth', 'own', 'strength', 'concentrating', 'little', 'moments', 'truth', 'essence', 'real', 'life', 'even', 'surfeit', 'musical-montage', 'sequences', 'running', 'film', 'partly', 'counteracted', 'subtle', 'spare', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'nicely', 'lyrical', 'nature', 'piece', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'particular', 'poetic', 'powerful', 'account', 'people', 'learning', 'prioritize', 'own', 'lives', 'such', 'way', 'be', 'greatest', 'value']",N/A

Granted, Mammoth is a bit too tidy and predictable in places, and the agenda a little too obvious. And yet, this is a problem for any film that finds political implications in our most cherished cultural beliefs. It's hard to be subtle when the elephant standing in the living room is finally unveiled for all to see.While we can all agree perhaps that the film falls short artistically, I still have to commend the filmmakers for exploring a largely taboo topic-- the human cost of outsourcing the care of children to financially desperate women of the third world.And yet few mass media reviewers have been so generous. For instance, in a mocking review, Manohla Dargis of the New York Times has this to say: ""The plight of mothers forced to neglect their children so they can support them is familiar and depressing and as old as the world, or rather human civilization. Most filmmakers working in fiction tend to ignore this kind of struggle unless they can use it for melodrama or tragedy, as Mr. Moodysson does to increasingly blunt effect by fingering his villains and hanging halos on his martyrs."" (NYT, November 20, 2009)This is an extraordinary misreading for a critic of Dargis' caliber to put into print. The fact is, Mammoth is very much at pains to show that everyone is victimized by the values they are living by, and in fairness, no character in Mammoth is reduced to a stereotype.Indeed, reading such negative assessments of Moodysson's film rather makes one wonder if the real problem with Mammoth is that it cuts a little too close to the bone...",3,A political film that falls short,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,1722,"['film', 'aim', 'bourgeois', 'cultural', 'assumptions', 'begging', 'critical', 'thrashing', 'what', 'film', 'got', 'when', 'was', 'released', '2009', 'Granted', 'Mammoth', 'bit', 'too', 'tidy', 'predictable', 'places', 'agenda', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'yet', 'problem', 'film', 'political', 'implications', 'most', 'cherished', 'cultural', 'beliefs', 'hard', 'be', 'subtle', 'when', 'elephant', 'standing', 'living', 'room', 'finally', 'unveiled', 'see.While', 'can', 'agree', 'perhaps', 'film', 'short', 'artistically', 'still', 'have', 'commend', 'filmmakers', 'exploring', 'largely', 'taboo', 'topic', 'human', 'cost', 'outsourcing', 'care', 'children', 'financially', 'desperate', 'women', 'third', 'world.And', 'yet', 'few', 'mass', 'media', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'generous', 'instance', 'mocking', 'review', 'Manohla', 'Dargis', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'say', 'plight', 'mothers', 'forced', 'neglect', 'children', 'can', 'support', 'familiar', 'depressing', 'as', 'old', 'world', 'rather', 'human', 'civilization', 'Most', 'filmmakers', 'working', 'fiction', 'tend', 'ignore', 'kind', 'struggle', 'can', 'use', 'melodrama', 'tragedy', 'Mr.', 'Moodysson', 'increasingly', 'blunt', 'effect', 'fingering', 'villains', 'hanging', 'halos', 'martyrs', 'NYT', 'November', '20', '2009', 'extraordinary', 'misreading', 'critic', 'Dargis', 'caliber', 'put', 'print', 'fact', 'Mammoth', 'very', 'much', 'pains', 'show', 'everyone', 'victimized', 'values', 'are', 'living', 'fairness', 'character', 'Mammoth', 'reduced', 'stereotype.Indeed', 'reading', 'such', 'negative', 'assessments', 'Moodysson', 'film', 'rather', 'one', 'wonder', 'real', 'problem', 'Mammoth', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'bone']",N/A
