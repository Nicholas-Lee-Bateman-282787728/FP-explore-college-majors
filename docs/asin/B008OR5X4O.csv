I liked hunters a lot (though at first I was afraid they'd ruin the movie). Kids in the movie. I thought it was a bad idea, to put teenagers and their love thing in this kind of movie, but from what I've seen, it wasn't too bad. Maybe they could have done better without them, and the story would be different, but maybe this is how it should be. 4 stars deserved. I didn't like when the kid had to dismember the bodies and do more gory stuff with them. I just don't like these things. They don't make a movie better for me. I will watch it again.

The townspeople, tired of being afraid, decides to offer a bounty for the super wolf.  The bounty naturally attracted those who believe they can make a quick buck.  Some are professionals who know what they're doing, and some are just low-life drunks with very little common sense.  Unfortunately, most of those who came to answer the call are of the latter type.  Among the skilled professionals are Charles and his band of hunters.A local boy, Daniel, begs Charles to let him come with them, to hunt the beast.  Reluctant at first, Charles begins to recognize the boy's intelligence.  Their first attempt to trap the beast failed.  The competition, the low-lifes, accidentally triggers the traps and spoils the hunt for Charles.  The group returns to town, to learn that the wolf has attacked a local brothel and killed a lot of the patrons.  Daniel notices that the wolf seems to be targeting the criminals and the low-lifes.As a side plot, Stefan, one of Charles' men sees Daniel's girlfriend and becomes infatuated.  He waits until the others are gone and tries to take her by force.  Daniel walks in on them and intervenes.  During the fight, Daniel uses uncanny strenght and quickness to repel Stefan.I want to stop right here so that I do not spoil the story for you.  This is a fair movie.  The production values are of decent quality.  The cast is pretty good.  Guy Wilson, Ed Quinn, Nia Peeples, Adam Croasdell, Stephen Rea, and Ana Ularu are the main cast.

It's not scary but there is enough excitement to satisfy (lots of blood and guts.........literally........buckets full).  The story involves a lot of red herrings, too many suspects it would seem.  It begins with a dramatic run through a forest that immediately piqued my interest.  Then it jumps to 25 years later (which seemed rather arbitrary).  I did like that they made it a period piece.  Unfortunately, there were too many contradictory accents raging amongst the cast, plus disparate acting styles; giving one the sense that only some of the actors/characters belonged in this place and time.  The FX was all right, could have been better.  The story was pretty basic: hunt the wolf.  The BIG ""surprise"" could have been more surprising (somehow, I expected it).  They definitely left the ending open; I can easily see a sequel (and wouldn't be opposed to watching one).As I wasn't expecting anything spectacular I wasn't disappointed with what I watched.

1573147,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B008OR5X4O,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[54, 57]","Classic Universal Horror films are being honored this October. What better way to do that than to add a new movie to the franchise? ""Werewolf: The Beast Among Us"" is Universal's newest attempt at giving the tragic hairy monster another chance to shine after the disappointing reaction to ""The Wolfman."" Don't let the direct-to-DVD tag fool you. This is an entertaining and intriguing addition to the genre of werewolf movies.I still don't know what there was to be disappointed in with ""The Wolfman."" It was the perfect blend of two of my favorite horror brands: the gory gothic world of Hammer and the classic Universal look of the monster made famous by Jack Pierce in the 1940s. I am one of the few people who actually loved the film and felt it was a great homage to the classic monster movies of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.""Werewolf: The Beast Among Us"" tells the story of a young man (Guy Wilson) in the 19th century named Daniel. His village is being attacked by a wolf-like creature. Daniel assists the town doctor (Stephen Rea) in caring for the victims and making sure no one is infected by the bite of the beast. He decides to help a band of hunters track down the monster after they're hired to rid the town of the werewolf menace.I know it sounds like a typical monster movie cut from the cloth of every other werewolf flick put out over the years. Thankfully, it's got some fun twists and turns that are meant to keep viewers wondering who the creature is and why it's attacking seemingly targeted individuals. It's just as much a ""who-done-it"" type movie as it is a classic horror vehicle.Just like ""The Wolfman,"" ""Werewolf: The Beast Among Us"" reminds me more of a Hammer Horror movie than a Universal Monster Classic. Everything from bloody body parts to the period-piece setting screams Hammer. There's not really much here that feels like it belongs in the Universal Monster Classics category.Being that it's a straight-to-DVD movie, you would expect the CGI and visual effects to be subpar. That's not the case here. There are plenty of very convincing half-eaten bodies and the practical werewolf makeup and effects look great. The CGI is one step below what you'd see in a big budget movie, but still gets the job done.My only complaint about ""Werewolf: The Beast Among Us"" is the picture is a bit too clean. It feels like it was shot in HD and that takes you out of the film sometimes. The impressive 5.1 surround mix delivers all the beastly sounds and horrific screams you'd expect from a great monster movie.Bonus material on the Blu-ray version include deleted scenes and feature commentary. There are also featurettes entitled ""Making the Monster,"" ""Transformation: Man to Beast,"" and ""Monster Legacy.""

The CG effects were pretty good.The story was not bad, I enjoyed the twists.Ahhh, the problems!  One has to guess that Eastern Europe is the setting, around 1890's. This is a world full of werewolves and vampire-like creatures called wurdelocks.  A village is getting nailed by a nasty werewolf.  Enter our hero's.  A troop of werewolf hunters show up to rid the village of the beast, led by Indiana Jones--oops, my mistake. (or was it?)  Not going to spoil it for you.  The trees have leaves and things are green, yet the people all say it is the winter solstice.  People in the movie all speak different dialects of English.  American, British, and only what can be described as Gypsy or Cossack. (like the villagers in Dracula).  The female werewolf hunter has a flamethrower, and I really need to check the date of manufacture on that unit. The costumes were good.  Our local young hero removes his shirt to reveal a really mature, buff upper body and forearms--the problem?  Shirtless, he pounds out a silver dagger in a blacksmith forge.

I read some reviews online before buying but ultimately decided to get this if nothing else it would be added to my prodigious horror film shelf.Boy I was wrong to doubt this film. I absolutely loved this. While not the best werewolf horror movie out there it is really a fine addition to the werewolf mythos. It filmed in easter europe and the locations look authentic and not like cheap sets. Based on the extras this movie was filmed in the region where Vlad Draculya lived, so I cannot imagine a more authentic feel for a horror film. The action sequences are really well done and the dialogue, while at times a bit forced, overall adds alot to the mystery and depth of the characters. I was pleasantly, and completely surprised at the twist, and I consider myself a very critical film viewer. I am giving this film 5 out of 5 because the special effects were really well done and the fight sequences and stunts look damn authentic and the surprise twist really did surprise me. This film will surprise you and it does a good job of deviating from the traditional werewolf and horror film tropes (I wont spoil it for you).  For a straight to DVD release this movie really has proved me wrong as far as expecting substandard film-making. In fact, the production values in this movie are so good I was sure it had to have been released in theaters.I hope to see more along the line of Universal Hammer horror monsters.

A young doctor decides to join a group of hunters to stop a menacing creature that has been terrorizing his village. It has some decent moments, including scares and thrills, but doesn't live up to it's potential.The story is fairly simple, as I previously summarized. So, it's easy to follow which can be seen as a plus. But, the characters were very generic and have been seen a dozen times in other films; the mysterious yet cool hunter, the smooth yet annoying hunter, the strong yet attractive female hunter, etc. The dialogue is also littered with one liners, I did laugh at the story of the horse with wheels for legs, though. Also, I heard several different English accents, which didn't really make sense to me. The gore and action effects were actually really good. But, the werewolves felt out of place and the transformations were a little lackluster and disappointing. Also, it's not the scariest movie, but it does pack some decent jump-out scares and some thrilling action sequences (not enough of them, though.) The werewolf's identity was predictable, but a certain part of the ending was not; regardless, it is also a bit boring and typical.Overall, the story and characters are generic/often boring and the effects for the most significant part of the film (the werewolves) were bad. It has been done before and better. If you're a fan of werewolves or monster flicks, you may enjoy this film the most.Werewolf: The Beast Among Us has strong violence and gore.

This is definitely not one of them. Usually when a movie goes straight to video thats usually a pretty good sign that its going to be bad. I gave this movie a chance simply because it had werewolves and I usually give every werewolf movie a shot but, all in all, this movie is just as bad as you probably think its going to be. The story is bad, especially the ending which feels cheesy and teeny-bopper Twilight inspired or something. The acting is bad, and the script is absolutely the worst. You can tell by the cast as they try to deliver their lines that they know their lines are awful and the movie is going to be awful. The CGI werewolf in this movie is also very bad (but that is expected with a straight to video release).So, I would suggest staying away from this movie. If you are looking for a good werewolf movie I would stick with Silver Bullet (in my opinion the best werewolf movie of all time), The Howling, The Wolfman (1941), or The Wolfman (2010).Edit 11/1/12: After seeing the director's cut of The Wolfman (2010) I can now say that is my favorite werewolf movie.

Universal produced the first werewolf film that terrified viewers back in 1941.  The new film does not take itself too seriously, which is a good thing.  The only thing I wish is that it paid more homage to the original.The story is in Eastern Europe, the setting the actual (former) Transylvania.  The story opens with a child facing down a terrifying beast.  Years later, we see that child grown up to be a werewolf hunter (Ed Quinn), leader of a ragtag band of hunters.  A young man named Daniel (Guy Wilson) earnestly seeks to join the hunters when they roll into town, but they don't want a local boy slowing them down.  The hunters are compromised by a local group of losers who want the glory, but not the actual work, of catching a werewolf.  Daniel also has to fend off one of the hunters, an exceedingly smarmy Lothario (Adam Croasdell) from chasing after his love interest, who is the daughter of the town's richest man.The characters are not stereotypes.  They are multi-layered, with ulterior, mysterious motives which we don't find out until later.  The score, acting, cinematography, sound, lighting, is all perfect to me.

1573180,AVEAF1857NCYR,B008OR5X4O,"Sean Brodrick ""Commodities SuperCyclist""","[2, 2]","I'm giving four stars to ""Werewolf: The Beast Among Us"". I'll give you some semi-spoilers that shouldn't ruin your viewing of it.The basic plot is that a nameless 19th-century Eastern European village is besieged by a werewolf that A) has the power to kill on any given night, regardless of how full the moon might be and B) seems to be growing stronger. A band of mercenary werewolf hunters arrives to track the monster down, and they are aided by a handsome local doctor's assistant who is in love with a beautiful local rich girl. Actually, there are enough plots in here for 3 movies, but it's not too distracting, and keeps you guessing where it might go.There is a twist with multiple villains. While it was a nice twist, I think losing the focus may have hurt the movie in the end. The movie gave us one suspect early on, though he turned out to have epilepsy (which caused seizures that other people, including viewers, mistake for werewolf activity). The real werewolf isn't hard to figure out, and you'll have it figured before the movie hands it to you.If there's a disappointment, it's that in the last 10 minutes of the movie, the werewolf goes from being ""the awful murderous monster that we must kill!"" to the good guy, the hero. That makes no sense, unless you are willing to write off all the victims as simple peasants that aren't worth worrying about.Still, overall, it was very good, and it makes more sense than most werewolf movies. The werewolf hunters are equipped with a flamethrower, which is a nice touch, and one of the hunters uses some very cool throwing knives. The cast is solid, lead by very recognizable actors including Stephen Rea, Ed Quinn, Nia Peeples, and Steven Bauer.It was filmed in Romania, which is exactly where you want to film a werewolf movie, especially one set in an ambiguous 19th-Century-ish past (they use horses and lanterns, but have a flamethrower and a gatling gun?).There is no nudity in the R-rated version (the one that was on Netflix), if nudity bothers you, but the movie is quite gory in parts.

Like all good werewolf movies, it has a gypsy.The special effects are not the greatest, but get a passing grade. The smart storyline is the biggest attraction. The characters could have been better developed with better lines to make the film more interesting.

When a hunting party is formed the village hopes that the town will be able to finally rest. One by one the villagers are attacked and turned in to vicious beasts the villagers begin to wonder if it is someone among them causing the problems. I will admit that this was better then I was expecting it to be but this movie is still something that should have been on the scy/fy channel. The film quality and acting are a step above the scy/fy standards but it still has the feel of a movie like that. The best way to describe this is as a slightly more scary version of the Amanda Seyfried ""Red Riding Hood"", it's almost a direct remake in my opinion. This is a movie that many people may really like, movies like this usually have cult like fans, but for me this was just something I had a hard time getting into. Overall, a scy/fy channel-like version of Seyfried's ""Red Riding Hood"". Not awful but nothing to rush out and see. I give it a C+.",3,"Not as cheesy as I was expecting.
