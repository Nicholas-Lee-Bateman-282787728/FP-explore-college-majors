(For those of you who don't know what GSA is, it stands for Gay-Straight Alliance). Now I am straight; however, many of my very good friends are gay or bi-sexual. I am also a very big supporter of rights; as well as, gay marriage becuase I don't see why if two people love each other and want to get married, why they should be denied that rights based on their gender and the opinions of closed-minded people.This is a about a 15-year-old named Jane, who fiqures out that she is gay. She finds out this about herself when she meets a new girl at school named Taylor. Even though her mother's best friend is gay, that doesn't mean she doesn't freak when she hears that her daughter is gay. Jane eventually gets her mom to join PFLAG, which is Parents and Friends of Gays and Lesbians.The girl who plays Jane you might remember from the show DEAD LIKE ME.

There's one point in THE TRUTH ABOUT JANE when you will swear Stockard Channing feels compelled to belt out ""There Are Worse Things I Can Do,"" especially when her daughter asks her if she graduated from high school without having sex.Another star of note is the exquisite Kelly Rowan, who later went on to play Kirsten Cohen on The O.C.  Here she looks even more fabulous if that's possible as the dedicated high school English teacher.  She acts so totally real you could swear she was a real teacher, except for one thing, she is too chic.  In her little black cocktail dress and a perfect white shell cardigan, and little black heels, she is the teacher of a young girl's dreams.  In the story of the movie, Jane is having a terrible time of it trying to come to terms with a new found desure to be with Taylor, the new girl in town, 24 hours a day.  Taylor's mom is a complete psycho and beats her up all the time.  However for sheer human awfulness, there's no one quite like poor Jane's younger brother Brad.First he spies on Taylor and Jane while they are kissing. Then he tells everyone at school so that Jane becomes the victim of virulent homophobia and her parents wind up getting anonymous phone calls informing them that their daughter is having an affair with a female classmate!  Stockard Channing doesn't know who to believe.  Though she's a cool mom in many ways, she's also rigid as a fencepost when it comes to Jane and her sexuality.  She's certain Jane is straight and can't see it any other way.Luckily the divine Kelly Rowan is in Jane's corner.  I'm not surprised that this movie led to bigger and better parts for La Rowan, it is the dictionary definition of a breakout part.And now, can anyone tell me what happened to our wonderful Ellen Muth?

One night, Jane kisses Taylor and subsequently realizes that she is a lesbian. After the girls take it one step further, Jane falls in love with Taylor. When the girls are caught kissing, Jane is outed at school and at home.Dealing with abuse on the schoolyard and parents who want to send her away to boarding school to cure her, Jane is pushed to the breaking point. She eventually confides in her English teacher Ms. Walcott (Kelly Rowan), who shares some of her own difficult experiences. Jane's father (James Naughton) tries to be supportive, but her mother's (Stockard Channing) refusal to accept the fact that her daughter is a lesbian begins to tear the family apart.In this Lifetime Original Movie, director Lee Rose (An Unexpected Love, A Girl Thing) brings to the screen a touching coming of age tale of a teenage girl. The scenario of parental rejection of a lesbian or gay child hits the mark all too well.Ellen Muth is wonderful as teenager Jane struggling with acceptance of her sexual identity. Stockard Channing is outstanding as Jane's mother Janice, who is too focused on struggling with her own inner emotions and prejudices to support her daughter through this important step in her life.

Important issues are dealt with in a tasteful, sensitive manner. It is educational and eye-opening without being too preachy or threatening to straight audiences.We see the main character, Jane, deal with her first lesbian relationship and the ensuing heartbreak once the relationship ends. We see how Jane learns to deal with the homophobia from her classmates and friends. Most importantly, we see how Jane's family reacts and deals with her homosexuality.Where I feel the realism breaks down a bit is that fact that Jane has two gay role models to help her through difficulties: her mother's gay friend (played by RuPaul), and a sympathetic English teacher who confronts Jane's parents at one point. I don't think most gay teens are so fortunate as Jane. Still, this movie may help to serve as a tool for gay teens to come out to their parents.

692640,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B000062Y1D,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[69, 72]","Okay, I admit.  I'm a straight guy with a penchant for lesbian-themed movies.  Sue me.  ""The Truth About Jane"" has a lot of very serious flaws.  First of all it could never shake that poorly-funded, independent/made-for-Lifetime Channel feel to it.  Parts of it were extremely cheesy.  As you've probably gathered from other reviewers, this film is also excessively didactic at parts, especially in the end where it quite tragically degrades (almost literally) into a promotional video for PFLAG.However, despite all these flaws, ""The Truth About Jane"" won me over within the first 20 minutes.  It is truly a moving and wonderful film, with brief moments of brilliance.The story of course revolves around the young teenaged girl Jane, played by the adorable Ellen Muth.  Jane is like any other girl, except of course she's fallen in love with another girl, and discovers that she is a lesbian.  Muth handles her role very well, creating a believable character with whom we can identify with.  She very successfully portrays the very rough experience that coming-of-age and ""growing pains"" can be, especially when complicated by sexual orientation.I like how, unlike so many other lesbian-ish characters I've seen in cinema, Jane is not bisexual, nor does she suddenly decides to start liking girls after a lifetime of very happily dating boys.  One of my favourite scenes was early in the movie when the ""cute"" boy comes to court Jane as she sits in the cafeteria with her other female friends.  Whilst her friends throw a fit about how hot the guy is and how Jane should date him, Jane honestly cannot see what the big deal is.  In another very good lesbian-themed movie ""Show Me Love"", Ellin is portrayed as a someone who was just fine dating boys until Agnes showed up in her life, which to me seems contrived.  Poor Jane goes through quite a bit in the course of this movie; not just coming-out pains, but also classic heartbreak that unfortunately goes hand-in-hand with adolescence, no matter who you are.  ""How much can a girl take?"" you ask yourself, and wish that you could just hug her and take her in.My only problem with her character was her occasional excess in disrespect and acting out against her parents which, while understandable given the circumstances, she could have shown a lot more maturity if she had resisted the urge to stay out drinking until 4:00AM.  (Same problem I had with Agnes' character in ""Show Me Love"") But, I suppose it accurately portrays the rebelliousness of youth.  Funny I think I missed that in my own life.Jane's relationship with Tyler was believeable, touching, and heartbreaking.  However, this movie isn't about a lesbian coming-of-age romance.  For better or worse, the centrepiece of the story is Jane's relationship with her mother.Stockard Channing, who plays Jane's mother, is a respected veteran actresses who excels at slow-paced ""chick flick"" dramas.  In the movie she ""shows her chops"", as the expression goes.  Channing brilliantly portrays the excruciating internal turmoil her character faces.  Two conflicting emotions storm within her; her love for her daughter, and her disappointment and fear at what she is.  Jane's mother is a very complex character and challenging to portray.  She is neither a model PLFAG mom, nor is she a heartless fundamentalist who would cast her child out for being gay.  She is ""everymom"", so to speak.  Channing is up to the challenge however, and portrays ever nuance of her character with veteran skill. We are furious at what Channing's character does, yet we cannot hate her, because we understand why she does those things, and what she's going through.  The mother has a good gay friend, yet cannot accept her daughter's homosexuality.  That doesn't make her evil, it just demonstrates that she is a real person.  Real people are not rational creatures.  In fact I applaud the film for not having Jane's mother be spiteful, then jump to total acceptance.  The film is almost...""unapologetic"" at showing what the mother's reactions and actions, which at times are truly disgraceful.  The mother is deeply flawed, and even by the end of the film it is clear she has not yet defeated all of her prejudices.  Yet she tries.  She is a product of her time, and we cannot simply blame her for everything.  Jane's mother's interal journey is every bit as wrenching and tumultuous as that of Jane's, but at the end they both grow tremendously and develop as complex, 3-dimensional characters.""The Truth About Jane"" is far from a perfect movie.  It is indeed preachy, some might even say it's propagandistic.  Particularly I found the last act of the film to be a little excessive (you'll know what I mean when you see it).  I would have chosen to be a bit more subtle about it if I had made the film.  But I believe it's the kind of propaganda we need, for the sake of righeousness and the moral evolution of our society.  I hope this movie makes it into the hands of some parents of gay children.  And everything aside, it's a very touching and entertaining story about a girl's unique journey growing up, finding herself, and taking her place in the world.",4,Flawed but moving,1099699200,"11 6,
