964293,A3RX54RU8R8OMH,B000E0OBKQ,"F. J. Harvey ""Cricket ,country music and a go...","[1, 1]","During the Vietnam war ,a motley group of South Korean soldiers -led by Lieutenant Choi( Kam Wu-Seong -a war hero with the unfortunate habit of losing men in combat ,on a larger scale that usual,and with the hard bitten  tough nut Sergeant Jin ( Sohn Byung-Ho)as second in command are sent an a week long mission ,their task being to discover the whereabouts of another platoon ,missing ,presumed dead ,at the strategically vital R-Point.On arrival they discover an abandoned temple on the jungle site of an earlier massacre and a stone tablet warning that anyone trespassing on the sacred ground with blood on their habds will never leave.Not suprisingly,they are spooked by this and tensions intensify when an American patrol arrives,warning of dangers awaiting in the upper floor of the temple. Choi begins to realise things are not what they should be ,especially when he discovers his patrol has one more man than it started with.The men begin to die ,and the director keeps matters ambiguous as to whether this is due to some supernatural agency ,or the men killing each other as they fall victim to madness and paranoia.This is a movie operating on atmosphere and suggestion rather than gross-out and will not please those who like their scares up front and in your face .It makes excellent use of the dark ,creepy and broody ruins rather than going for sudden jump cuts and shocks.The narrative is at times disjointed and the characters are the stock types found in any patrol movie from any movie industry the world over and one dance party sequence is hideously misjudged and defuses tension .

964294,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000E0OBKQ,General Zombie,"[9, 11]","Alright, here's another short one.  This is another Asian ghost movie but, gasp, it doesn't follow the conventions of the subgenre to a t, like most of these films I've seen.  It's set during the Vietnam war, which is a nice change of setting, I suppose, though it does make the characters a bit tough to tell apart.  (As they often are in war movies, what with everyone being dressed the same and wearing helmets and so on.)  This movie is fairly slow moving, and it easily could stand to have 10 or so minutes lopped off from between the time that they arrive at R-Point and when things really start moving, but it's less drawn out then plenty of ghost movies, so it's not too bad.  This movie is quite genuinely creepy much of the time, with a great locale, an abandoned mansion/plantation looking building out in Vietnamese field, surrounded by jungle.  The film may be a bit too scattershot for some tastes, as the supernatural manifestations often seem to lack any particular rhyme or reason, but I think it's a good way to keep you off balance.  I particularly like the scene when one lone soldier encounters a platoon of ghost soldiers, seeing them only from behind until they crouch down in the underbrush and disappear, and a later scene where one guy follows a distant apparition out into the night until he stumbles in a a mysterious graveyard.  And yeah, it does have some of the conventional girl-ghost stuff going on, but it's not the sole focus of the film, so it's not too tiresome and played out.  (Though this element does play a big role in the climax, which is too bad as it's just not as effective as some of the other stuff.)This film obviously isn't the most expensive thing you're gonna see, but the technical side of the film is more than competent, with some occasionally very beautiful cinematography.  The acting is all fine, though they generally aren't asked to do too much.  The music, however, is sometimes a concern.  Usually it's just unobtrusive, but it occasionally becomes a bit wacky, and detracts from the general mood of the film.Again, this isn't overwhelmingly original or anything, but it's still a relative breath of fresh air in the increasingly stale movement.  (In fact, I would say it probably compares more closely to 'Session 9' than any particular Asian horror film that I can think of.)  Worth a look.Also, I find that 'Best Military Guys Meets Supernatural Horror flick since Dog Soldiers' quote (or something like that) very amusing, as if there were tons military horror films coming out.  Though I suppose I must say I disagree with this quote, as I find 'Below' and '28 Days Later' to both be superior to either of these films, but whatever.  It's still a silly quote, regardless of whether or not you agree with it.Grade: B",4,Solid Asian Horror,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,2782,"['Alright', 'here', 'short', 'one', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'movie', 'gasp', ""n't"", 'follow', 'conventions', 'subgenre', 't', 'most', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'set', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'nice', 'change', 'setting', 'suppose', 'make', 'characters', 'bit', 'tough', 'tell', 'apart', 'often', 'are', 'war', 'movies', 'what', 'everyone', 'being', 'dressed', 'same', 'wearing', 'helmets', 'so', 'movie', 'fairly', 'slow', 'moving', 'easily', 'could', 'stand', 'have', '10', 'so', 'minutes', 'lopped', 'off', 'time', 'arrive', 'R-Point', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'moving', 'less', 'drawn', 'out', 'then', 'plenty', 'ghost', 'movies', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'quite', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'much', 'time', 'great', 'locale', 'abandoned', 'mansion/plantation', 'looking', 'building', 'out', 'Vietnamese', 'field', 'surrounded', 'jungle', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'scattershot', 'tastes', 'supernatural', 'manifestations', 'often', 'seem', 'lack', 'particular', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'think', 'good', 'way', 'keep', 'off', 'balance', 'particularly', 'scene', 'when', 'one', 'lone', 'soldier', 'platoon', 'ghost', 'soldiers', 'seeing', 'only', 'crouch', 'down', 'underbrush', 'disappear', 'later', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'guy', 'distant', 'apparition', 'night', 'mysterious', 'graveyard', 'yeah', 'have', 'conventional', 'girl-ghost', 'stuff', 'going', 'not', 'sole', 'focus', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'tiresome', 'played', 'out', 'element', 'play', 'big', 'role', 'climax', 'too', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'effective', 'other', 'stuff', 'film', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'most', 'expensive', 'thing', ""'re"", 'gon', 'see', 'technical', 'side', 'film', 'more', 'competent', 'occasionally', 'very', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'fine', 'generally', 'are', ""n't"", 'asked', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'music', 'however', 'sometimes', 'concern', 'just', 'unobtrusive', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'wacky', 'detracts', 'general', 'mood', 'film.Again', ""n't"", 'overwhelmingly', 'original', 'anything', 'still', 'relative', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'increasingly', 'stale', 'movement', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'probably', 'more', 'closely', ""'Session"", '9', 'particular', 'Asian', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'look.Also', 'find', ""'Best"", 'Military', 'Guys', 'Meets', 'Supernatural', 'Horror', 'flick', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'quote', 'something', 'very', 'amusing', 'were', 'tons', 'military', 'horror', 'films', 'coming', 'out', 'suppose', 'must', 'say', 'disagree', 'quote', 'find', ""'Below"", ""'28"", 'Days', 'Later', 'be', 'superior', 'films', 'still', 'silly', 'quote', 'regardless', 'not', 'agree', 'it.Grade', 'B']",R-Point

964297,A9LSLYQW28X6H,B000E0OBKQ,Jeff Van Gastel,"[2, 3]","It is 1972 during the Vietnam War.  Two Korean military men receive radio transmissions from Donkey 30, a platoon thought lost 6 months ago.  The base commander sends a platoon, led by Lt. Choi, to R-Point to find the missing men.  The platoon gets dropped off on an island, whereby they come across a rock formation.  On the rocks are some writing, plus this ominous phrase, ""Those Who Have Blood On Their Hands Will Not Return"".  The next morning, an ominous temple appears out of nowhere, and thus we the viewers know the soldiers have now entered the Supernatural area.  From here, the film focuses on the platoon and their encounters with the ghosts around the temple.I enjoyed the movie up until the climax of the film.  As in most asian horror films, the interpretation of what happens falls onto the viewer.  However, it is never fully explained why the ghost(s) haunt the soldiers, or why they take over their bodies.  As someone mentioned before, there is an annoying habit of showing the soldiers from the ghosts viewpoint.  There really is no point to it, as they peer around trees or walls.  Really unnecessary, especially since they can stand in front of you and remain unseen.  The movie moves at a good pace, especially once the soldiers come upon the temple.  The platoon slowly unravels mentally, as one by one the soldiers are done away with.  The acting was good, especially from the Lt. Choi and Sgt. Jin.There are some cool extras on the DVD:* Making of R-Point: Shows the military training of the actors, plus some interviews with the director and other staff.* Creating 1972 Vietnam: Interesting part showing how the crew had to deal with Vietnam of today, and trying to make it look like Vietnam during 1972.* Special Effects Featurette:  how they made up the ghosts and corpses* Original Theatrical Trailer* Tartan Asia Extreme New Releases",4,Asian Horror/War Movie !,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,1866,"['1972', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Two', 'Korean', 'military', 'men', 'receive', 'radio', 'transmissions', 'Donkey', '30', 'platoon', 'thought', 'lost', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'base', 'commander', 'platoon', 'led', 'Lt.', 'Choi', 'R-Point', 'find', 'missing', 'men', 'platoon', 'dropped', 'off', 'island', 'whereby', 'come', 'rock', 'formation', 'rocks', 'are', 'writing', 'ominous', 'phrase', 'Who', 'Have', 'Blood', 'Their', 'Hands', 'Will', 'Not', 'Return', 'next', 'morning', 'ominous', 'temple', 'nowhere', 'thus', 'viewers', 'know', 'soldiers', 'have', 'now', 'entered', 'Supernatural', 'area', 'here', 'film', 'platoon', 'encounters', 'ghosts', 'temple.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'up', 'climax', 'film', 'most', 'asian', 'horror', 'films', 'interpretation', 'what', 'viewer', 'However', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'why', 'ghost', 'haunt', 'soldiers', 'why', 'take', 'over', 'bodies', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'annoying', 'habit', 'showing', 'soldiers', 'ghosts', 'viewpoint', 'really', 'point', 'peer', 'trees', 'walls', 'Really', 'unnecessary', 'especially', 'can', 'stand', 'front', 'remain', 'unseen', 'movie', 'good', 'pace', 'especially', 'soldiers', 'come', 'temple', 'platoon', 'slowly', 'unravels', 'mentally', 'one', 'one', 'soldiers', 'are', 'done', 'away', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'especially', 'Lt.', 'Choi', 'Sgt', 'Jin.There', 'are', 'cool', 'extras', 'DVD', '*', 'Making', 'R-Point', 'military', 'training', 'actors', 'interviews', 'director', 'other', 'staff', '*', 'Creating', '1972', 'Vietnam', 'Interesting', 'part', 'showing', 'how', 'crew', 'had', 'deal', 'Vietnam', 'today', 'trying', 'make', 'look', 'Vietnam', '1972', '*', 'Special', 'Effects', 'Featurette', 'how', 'made', 'up', 'ghosts', 'corpses*', 'Original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer*', 'Tartan', 'Asia', 'Extreme', 'New', 'Releases']",R-Point

964299,A1HNGMZSGHQHL2,B000E0OBKQ,Martin Wagner,"[5, 7]","There's a lot of promise in R-Point, but very little fulfillment of any of it. I suppose the reason we don't see too many meldings of the war and supernatural horror genres is that the reality of war is infinitely more horrific than any ""boo! a ghost!"" plot line any screenwriter could cook up. That doesn't mean it's impossible to make a good war/horror movie. Still, what examples I've seen in the past -- The Bunker, The Keep, Below -- have been sad disappointments, relying on the genre's clich&eacute;s rather than any narrative depth to evoke horror.R-Point wants to explore such depth, putting a platoon of men in a situation where they question their very sanity. But ultimately, it falls back on horror movie clich&eacute;s -- yes, there's even a black-haired ghost woman. Still, there are several good scenes, and enough hints at what a good movie this could have been, that it's worth watching at least once for hardcore Asian-horror fans. It's the kind of movie where you sit around after it was over and talk about how awesome it would have been if only they'd done X or Y.The first half of the movie is reasonably strong. A Korean platoon in Vietnam that vanished six months before our story starts, in a remote area designated R-Point, has suddenly started radioing in to HQ. Another platoon is whipped together to find them. Trekking out to the eerie location, they set up base camp in an abandoned mansion and begin reconning the area. Promptly weirdness starts occurring. In the best scene, one soldier gets separated from his search party, only to find them crossing a field...but is it them? In another, a late night visit from a passing American platoon divulges some of R-Point's backstory, and sets up a creepy reveal later in the film.Up to this point, atmosphere is very disturbing and there is a lot of tension. Unfortunately it begins to weaken when little to no explanation is ever satisfactorily given for the weird goings-on. I forget where I read it, but someone once said that any genre movie can be forgiven its worst failings as long as it follows the ""Awesome!"" rule -- that it has at least one knockout scene that makes you say, ""Okay, _that_ was awesome!"" R-Point has no such scene.The soldiers begin fighting amongst one another, but you don't really know them that well, so it's hard to understand why. Most of them are one-dimensional soldier stereotypes (the scared rookie, the guy who can't wait to get home to take his kid to the zoo so we know he's gonna die early, the gruff sarge whom many of the grunts trust more than the green lieutenant), so we don't feel any sense of personal stake in their fate. Worse still is the director's choice to throw in the occasional green-tinted ghost POV shot. It begins early in the movie and completely wrecks the mood every time, because it's such an obvious cheap horror movie device. What are we supposed to think? ""Ooooo, scarrrrrry, they're being watched from behind a tree by a ghost!"" Uhh, sorry, doesn't work. For one thing, if I were a ghost...why would I hide behind a tree?Ultimately, the movie just doesn't pay off. It's a shame, because there are hints that with a few more rewrites, this could have been a really amazing combination of the real-life horror of Platoon or Apocalypse Now, and the ""who can you trust?"" themes of Body Snatchers or John Carpenter's The Thing. Watch it for yourself, and I bet you come up with several better ways the story could have played out.A note about the DVD: Fine picture and sound, but the two making-of featurettes lack English subtitles. So, only if you speak Korean will you get to appreciate how the filmmakers went about recreating 1972 Vietnam.

As with the best of war pictures, the story never lets you forget that these men are soldiers and could be killed anytime by an enemy cloaked in the green darkness of the bamboo; there is always a sense of death waiting.  The actors are absolutely wonderful, with the obvious blundering exception of the only English-speaking actors to appear in the film.  While these cretins deliver their lines like lumber at a Home Depot, the native born Koreans take their work seriously, pulling you into a willing sense of disbelief, making the supernatural seem real purely through their reactions to the storyline's impossible events.The music, dark and foreboding throughout most of the film, is full of traditional Oriental instruments to add a ghostly exotic flavor to the scenes, and really keeps the atmosphere bleak.The special effects are minimal, and for that less-is-more philosophy, we are allowed to let our imaginations create faces in the shadows far worse than anything a CGI crew could have done.A few standout scenes for me (without giving too much away): the dead soldier conversing with his comrade in the midnight shrouded bunker scene, the cemetery scene, the silent patrol in the grass scene, and the end radio scene.Brrrrr...  You'll know them when you see them.  Trust me.But ""R-Point"" isn't a perfect horror film, as it does suffer from what I like to call ""Ringu-itis"".  You know...that's when an Asian film company can't help but stick a longhaired young woman in a white dress in the movie to represent evil spirits.  And that's where the film's biggest failure comes in to play.  There is no obvious reason for the insertion of a ""Ringu"" chick.  The film cruises along quite well up to that point, and then feels a bit deflated and unsatisfactory because of it.As well, the ending is a bit muddled as to why the possessions take place and these meaningless rapid-fire scenes get a little tiresome.There are some extraneous Infrared POV shots throughout the film, presumably to denote the presence of evil spirits, but they fall flat as hell against the much scarier things we don't see and only imagine.But all in all, ""R-Point"" is very much worth these minor flaws in story logic.  It's a memorable horror movie- much more so than anything the American cinema has offered in the last five or more years.  Anyone wanna bet how soon it takes for Hollywood to decide to remake it with American actors?--Nickolas Cook.",4,Korean war horror at its best,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,3192,"['R-PointReview', 'Nickolas', 'CookDuring', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'South', 'Korean', 'army', 'base', 'receiving', 'mysterious', 'radio', 'transmissions', 'patrol', 'went', 'missing', 'six', 'months', 'earlier', 'shell-shocked', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Gam', 'Woo-Sung', 'ragtag', 'military', 'unit', 'are', 'sent', 'desolate', 'stretch', 'land', 'known', 'R-Point', 'gather', 'clues', 'whereabouts', 'missing', 'soldiers', 'What', 'appeared', 'be', 'clear', 'search', 'rescue', 'mission', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'terrifying', 'battle', 'R-Point', 'full', 'what', 'horror', 'movie', 'work', 'first', 'scene', 'radio', 'delivering', 'message', 'dead', 'men', 'utterly', 'creepy', 'director', 'cinematography', 'atmospheric', 'making', 'most', 'jungle', 'setting', 'isolation', 'natural', 'colors', 'best', 'war', 'pictures', 'story', 'never', 'forget', 'men', 'are', 'soldiers', 'could', 'be', 'killed', 'anytime', 'enemy', 'cloaked', 'green', 'darkness', 'bamboo', 'always', 'sense', 'death', 'waiting', 'actors', 'are', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'obvious', 'blundering', 'exception', 'only', 'English-speaking', 'actors', 'appear', 'film', 'cretins', 'deliver', 'lines', 'lumber', 'Home', 'Depot', 'native', 'born', 'Koreans', 'take', 'work', 'seriously', 'pulling', 'willing', 'sense', 'disbelief', 'making', 'supernatural', 'seem', 'real', 'purely', 'reactions', 'storyline', 'impossible', 'events.The', 'music', 'dark', 'foreboding', 'most', 'film', 'full', 'traditional', 'Oriental', 'instruments', 'add', 'ghostly', 'exotic', 'flavor', 'scenes', 'really', 'keeps', 'atmosphere', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'minimal', 'less-is-more', 'philosophy', 'are', 'allowed', 'let', 'imaginations', 'create', 'shadows', 'far', 'worse', 'anything', 'CGI', 'crew', 'could', 'have', 'done.A', 'few', 'standout', 'scenes', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'dead', 'soldier', 'conversing', 'comrade', 'midnight', 'shrouded', 'bunker', 'scene', 'cemetery', 'scene', 'silent', 'patrol', 'grass', 'scene', 'end', 'radio', 'scene.Brrrrr', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'Trust', 'me.But', 'R-Point', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'horror', 'film', 'suffer', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'Ringu-itis', 'know', 'when', 'Asian', 'film', 'company', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'stick', 'longhaired', 'young', 'woman', 'white', 'dress', 'movie', 'represent', 'evil', 'spirits', 'where', 'film', 'biggest', 'failure', 'play', 'obvious', 'reason', 'insertion', 'Ringu', 'chick', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'point', 'then', 'feels', 'bit', 'deflated', 'unsatisfactory', 'it.As', 'well', 'ending', 'bit', 'muddled', 'why', 'possessions', 'take', 'place', 'meaningless', 'rapid-fire', 'scenes', 'get', 'little', 'are', 'extraneous', 'Infrared', 'POV', 'shots', 'film', 'presumably', 'denote', 'presence', 'evil', 'spirits', 'fall', 'flat', 'hell', 'much', 'scarier', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'only', 'imagine.But', 'R-Point', 'very', 'much', 'minor', 'flaws', 'story', 'logic', 'memorable', 'horror', 'movie-', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'anything', 'American', 'cinema', 'offered', 'last', 'five', 'more', 'years', 'Anyone', 'wan', 'bet', 'how', 'soon', 'Hollywood', 'decide', 'remake', 'American', 'actors', 'Nickolas', 'Cook']",R-Point

The men venture to R-Point, which is the location of a bandoned mansion that was the last place the men were supposedly last at before their disappearance. With hope of finding clues to the missing men, the group of soldiers crosses into supernatural realms when a certain few begins seeing ghosts of dead men, causing paranoia and fear inthe squad. Unlike other films in the sub-genre, this film focuses more on the creepy atmosphere and does'nt play with the paranoia theme as much as others may have. The movie stays at a constant slow, but moody, pace as it revolves soley around the group of men and their encounter with the supernatural. Overall a creepy old-school ghost story that delivers the chills thanks to its sucessful use of the secluded atmosphere around them.
