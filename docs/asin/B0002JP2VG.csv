It's not a straight telling of the story of the monk Benkei at Gojoe bridge, indeed apart from taking a few characters and locations seems to have very little to do with it. So we know it's not a historical costume drama, then what is it ? The metaphysical element is strange, it's very difficult to judge what view the film is taking, is it one of the real world perceived from the the viewpoint of people who believe in demons and the mystic powers of Buddhism. Or is it a more fantasy oriented scenario where these are literally true and the combatants really are waging psychic war ? Perhaps it's a choice we're allowed to make ourselves, make of it what you will, I don't know the answer.  The films pace also jumps to extremes, from blood spurting action shots where somewhat inept samurai are hacked up by the dozen to sections where a confused Benkei gets all angst ridden and meanders off into the wilderness to indulge in much tedious self examination and find himself. Clearly the director is trying to provide something deeper and more spiritual than Baby cart or Azumi but I'm not entirely sure he's succeeded, maybe you need to be a Buddhist to really get it.",3,Many layered somewhat confusingly opaque offering,1180656000,"06 1, 2007",2007,1293,"['Gojoe', 'rather', 'strange', 'offering', 'find', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'still', 'undecided', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'not', 'straight', 'telling', 'story', 'monk', 'Benkei', 'Gojoe', 'bridge', 'indeed', 'apart', 'taking', 'few', 'characters', 'locations', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'know', 'not', 'historical', 'costume', 'drama', 'then', 'what', 'metaphysical', 'element', 'strange', 'very', 'difficult', 'judge', 'what', 'film', 'taking', 'one', 'real', 'world', 'perceived', 'viewpoint', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'demons', 'mystic', 'powers', 'Buddhism', 'more', 'fantasy', 'oriented', 'scenario', 'where', 'are', 'literally', 'true', 'combatants', 'really', 'are', 'waging', 'psychic', 'war', 'Perhaps', 'choice', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'make', 'ourselves', 'make', 'what', 'will', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'answer', 'films', 'pace', 'also', 'extremes', 'blood', 'spurting', 'action', 'shots', 'where', 'somewhat', 'inept', 'samurai', 'are', 'hacked', 'up', 'dozen', 'sections', 'where', 'confused', 'Benkei', 'angst', 'ridden', 'meanders', 'off', 'wilderness', 'indulge', 'much', 'tedious', 'self', 'examination', 'find', 'Clearly', 'director', 'trying', 'provide', 'something', 'deeper', 'more', 'spiritual', 'Baby', 'cart', 'Azumi', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'succeeded', 'maybe', 'need', 'be', 'Buddhist', 'really', 'get']",N/A

837891,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B0002JP2VG,Ernest Jagger,"[2, 2]","As I wrote in the title for, ""Gojoe: Spirit War Chronicle,"" this is not a film for everyone. However, I really enjoyed the film. Sometimes [many times] a film does not have to tie all the loose ends to be enjoyed, sometimes just the escapism and pure enjoyment of a film as an entertaining piece of cinema is good enough. And I found the film interesting enough to put in my collection. Plus, I liked the character of Benkei (Daisuke Ryu) as a monk who has put down his sword, yet decides that he must complete one more mission. Benkei was once a famed swordsman, however, it has been years since he has slain anyone. Yet things are about to change: For there is an evil presence at Gojoe Bridge. Who is killing all the samurai? And for that matter, why?Benkei tries to enlist the help of his former mentor, who warns Benkei that he is not ready for this mission. Further, this monk warns Benkei that he will fail because he has not seen the way. Yeah, I know, sounds like a bunch of silly philosophical mumbo-jumbo, [and maybe it is] but that does not mean the film is not entertaining. At least for me. Moreover, I really liked the character actors in the film too. Plus, the antagonist in the film is portrayed by (Tadanobu Asano), who gives a very good portrayal in his role as a gifted swordsman. Tadanobu Asano is trying to reclaim his place as the rightful heir to the land, and watching his performance makes this film a worthwhile watch. Plus, the cinematography in the film is very good. Although there are spots here and there in the film where the picture is not very clear, they are few and far between. The film itself has great cinematography.The films narrative takes place in 12th Century Japan, at a place called Gojoe Bridge. Apparently, many members of a warrior clan are being killed by an unknown entity. Benkei, a former warrior has become a Buddhist and refuses to kill anymore, however, he changes his mind and decides to destroy whatever evil is lurking at Gojoe Bridge. Is it human? Or is it something else? I will leave this to the viewer to watch. I can tell you, however, that this movie does not disappoint. It sure did not disappoint me. I thought the cinematography and the acting and action sequences were very good, and the film definitely has an original storyline. I am a huge fan of the Toshirio Mifune and Akira Kurosawa classics. [Not that I am comparing this film to those earlier classics]. I am not. However, I like it when directors come along with something different for a change, and this film is definitely different. And once again, this is not a film for everyone, therefore, rent it first.

That's what this movie is.  It's based in a fantasy period Japan where ""demons"" are killing guards at night.  As it turns out the demons are really just three guys that are worshipping the dark side and using its power to gain back a family's power.  The lead in this movie is never convincing as a martial artist or swordsman and only gets a few scant minutes of action.

But it is definitely NOT an ""action packed epic"" as described by  Amazon. And the fight scenes are unusually and imaginatively depicted, but they are not ""extraordinary"" in the usual sense. In short, this is not an action movie nor is it a traditional samurai or martial arts film. It is really a metaphysical fantasy film. ""Gojoe"" is to samurai films as ""Blueberry"" is to westerns.I am annoyed that it is getting poor reviews by people who were expecting some sort of Wu-Tang Baby Cart Master Killer blood and guts actioner. But it's not their fault that this film is incorrectly marketed.People who will enjoy this movie:- fans of director Sogo Ishii's slower paced films, e.g. ""Angel Dust""- fans of other foreign cinema especially Japanese cinema, e.g. Rashomon (although I would never claim it is in the same league as such a classic)- those who like cerebral, beautifully shot films- people with an interest in Japanese mythology or Shinto, but okay with it addressed on an obviously simplified levelPeople who are looking for the following should avoid this movie:- action (though there is some)- fast pace- linear story- everything spelled out and explained- humor- romanceThe high points of this film include the beautiful imagery, intense slow-burn acting of Daisuke RYU as Benkei, good performances by all the supporting cast, pretty nifty costumes, a really awesome climax.Oddly enough, I found Tadanobu ASANO, who I usually love, to be only so-so in this film. Maybe it was his bad hair.The reason I give this film only a 4 is that it really is a bit long. Nonetheless, Media Blasters did do the right thing by including the full international version, instead of the cut version.The DVD features are great, with both the original Japanese dialogue, nicely done subtitles, an English dub track, and some nice ""making of"" featurettes.This is an interesting, unique film but only for the right audience.",4,"An interesting movie, with some caveats",1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1983,"['beautifully', 'directed', 'movie', 'notable', 'director', 'Sogo', 'ISHII', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'action', 'packed', 'epic', 'described', 'Amazon', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'unusually', 'imaginatively', 'depicted', 'are', 'not', 'extraordinary', 'usual', 'sense', 'short', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'traditional', 'samurai', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'really', 'metaphysical', 'fantasy', 'film', 'Gojoe', 'samurai', 'films', 'Blueberry', 'westerns.I', 'am', 'annoyed', 'getting', 'poor', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'expecting', 'sort', 'Wu-Tang', 'Baby', 'Cart', 'Master', 'Killer', 'blood', 'guts', 'actioner', 'not', 'fault', 'film', 'incorrectly', 'marketed.People', 'who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'fans', 'director', 'Sogo', 'Ishii', 'slower', 'paced', 'films', 'e.g', 'Angel', 'Dust', 'fans', 'other', 'foreign', 'cinema', 'especially', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'e.g', 'Rashomon', 'would', 'never', 'claim', 'same', 'league', 'such', 'classic', 'who', 'cerebral', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'films-', 'people', 'interest', 'Japanese', 'mythology', 'Shinto', 'addressed', 'obviously', 'simplified', 'levelPeople', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'following', 'should', 'avoid', 'movie', 'action', 'fast', 'pace-', 'linear', 'story-', 'everything', 'spelled', 'out', 'explained-', 'humor-', 'romanceThe', 'high', 'points', 'film', 'include', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'intense', 'slow-burn', 'acting', 'Daisuke', 'RYU', 'Benkei', 'good', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'costumes', 'really', 'awesome', 'climax.Oddly', 'enough', 'found', 'Tadanobu', 'ASANO', 'who', 'usually', 'love', 'be', 'only', 'so-so', 'film', 'Maybe', 'was', 'bad', 'hair.The', 'reason', 'give', 'film', 'only', '4', 'really', 'bit', 'long', 'Nonetheless', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'did', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'including', 'full', 'international', 'version', 'instead', 'cut', 'version.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'great', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'nicely', 'done', 'subtitles', 'English', 'dub', 'track', 'nice', 'making', 'featurettes.This', 'interesting', 'unique', 'film', 'only', 'right', 'audience']",N/A

If the price were not so high, I would buy it (I'm running low).The story was entrancing, fight scenes amazing, and whatever special effects used were good.Other reviewers said they didn't like things such as the seashell throwing, and the blood spraying, but what did they expect? The main character was a budhist monk, and in feudal Japan, monks didn't drive their cars to the local shrine to pray everyday. Many monks in feudal Japan probably did similar things.As to the blood spraying, what good samurai movie doesn't have a little spraying blood. Sure it's a bit graphic, but you see that in many samurai/ninja movies.And finally, I would like to say that the antagonist and protaganist were both demons. It even explained toward the end of the movie why the protaganist (please excuse me if I've switched my terms) was a demon.One thing I did not like about this movie was that a few things were left un-explained.
