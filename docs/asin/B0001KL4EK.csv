808914,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B0001KL4EK,Adrien Caldwell,"[1, 1]","I will not summarize the story as other reviewers have already done a good job with that already. But I will add my own two cents here:I was almost inclined to give this movie five stars. But because of the nature of the film (dealing with prostitution/slavery)I found that much of the story was sugar coated or that it tried to make light of serious matters. Apparently it is based on a true story? Toward the end we are told that we do not know where Elisa or her children are. But the end of the movie (before this last bit of information is provided) shows her, playing with her children and her ""savior"" the officer from Barcelona as if to imply a happy ending.Toward the beginning of the movie it almost appears as if prostitution is to be perceived as glamorous and we are funneled with ongoing humor while Elisa and her friends are tirelessly turning tricks one after the other. Elisa has a firecracker personality and mouths off but does not ever seem to get herself into trouble (which also seemed unrealistic) for her overly sassy rantings.Although there was some violence (a very real and possible threat in prostitution/enslavement), there was never any mention of STD's or HIV/AIDS and only a very light mention of narcotics. These are aspects that are heavily intertwined with prostitution which this movie did not cover.The reason why I give this movie three stars is because it sends mixed messages. It appears as though the movie was based on fact, but the movie is filled with humor and then too many sugarcoated scenes such as being saved by a Catalonian officer who flies back to South America (honestly, as if this sort of thing happens in real life)to prevent her arrest. So instead of being arrested for her illegal actions she is arrested and instead magically becomes the spokesperson for prostitutes in an almost glamorized fashion, followed by reunification with her children and what seems to be a happy ending.It was just too syrupy sweet of an ending. Keep it real. If this movie were portrayed in a more edgier, realistic manner I would have given this movie four or five stars.",3,Enjoyable,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,2110,"['will', 'not', 'summarize', 'story', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'already', 'will', 'add', 'own', 'two', 'cents', 'here', 'was', 'almost', 'inclined', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'nature', 'film', 'dealing', 'prostitution/slavery', 'found', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'sugar', 'coated', 'tried', 'make', 'light', 'serious', 'matters', 'Apparently', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'end', 'are', 'told', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'Elisa', 'children', 'are', 'end', 'movie', 'last', 'bit', 'information', 'provided', 'playing', 'children', 'savior', 'officer', 'Barcelona', 'imply', 'happy', 'ending.Toward', 'beginning', 'movie', 'almost', 'prostitution', 'be', 'perceived', 'glamorous', 'are', 'funneled', 'ongoing', 'humor', 'Elisa', 'friends', 'are', 'tirelessly', 'turning', 'tricks', 'one', 'other', 'Elisa', 'firecracker', 'personality', 'mouths', 'off', 'not', 'ever', 'seem', 'get', 'trouble', 'also', 'seemed', 'unrealistic', 'overly', 'sassy', 'rantings.Although', 'was', 'violence', 'very', 'real', 'possible', 'threat', 'prostitution/enslavement', 'was', 'never', 'mention', 'STD', 'HIV/AIDS', 'only', 'very', 'light', 'mention', 'narcotics', 'are', 'aspects', 'are', 'heavily', 'intertwined', 'prostitution', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'cover.The', 'reason', 'why', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'mixed', 'messages', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'fact', 'movie', 'filled', 'humor', 'then', 'too', 'many', 'sugarcoated', 'scenes', 'such', 'being', 'saved', 'Catalonian', 'officer', 'who', 'back', 'South', 'America', 'honestly', 'sort', 'thing', 'happens', 'real', 'life', 'prevent', 'arrest', 'So', 'instead', 'being', 'arrested', 'illegal', 'actions', 'arrested', 'instead', 'magically', 'spokesperson', 'prostitutes', 'almost', 'glamorized', 'fashion', 'followed', 'reunification', 'children', 'what', 'be', 'happy', 'ending.It', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'syrupy', 'sweet', 'ending', 'Keep', 'real', 'movie', 'were', 'portrayed', 'more', 'edgier', 'realistic', 'manner', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'four', 'five', 'stars']",En la Puta Vida

808917,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001KL4EK,Grady Harp,"[125, 128]","EN LA PUTA VIDA is a very well made, polished, intelligent film from Uruguay that begins as what seems to be a comedy and develops into a provocative drama - much the way events in life mimic such changes.  Director and co-writer Beatriz Flores Silva knows her way around tough subject matter and is able to bring out sterling performances by a very fine cast.Elisa (the very beautiful and talented Marianna Santangelo) is a hairdresser with two children, born of different fathers, who lives with her mother while trying to convince her latest paramour Garcia (Augusto Mazzarelli) to leave his wife and marry her. She dreams of having her own Salon in the rich district of Montevideo and will stop at nothing to achieve her goal.  When her life falls apart and she is desperate to make enough money to open her Salon, she is invited into the world of fast money (prostitution) by her best friend Lulu (Andrea Fantoni), and enters the tutelage of Madame Dona Jacqueline (a terrific cameo by Graciela Esuder!).  In her new role Elisa encounters the handsome but wily Placido (played by Silvestre) who invites her to bed and to Barcelona, Spain with promises that she will make so much money that she not only will be able to send money back to her children, but also have more than enough to open her Salon in the fanciest part of her native Montevideo.  Elisa and Lulu join other prostitutes in this promise of wealth and fly to Barcelona - and unexpected white slavery.  There she works her corner but is in the presence of a gang of Brazilian transvestites controlled by a mob.  She is arrested by a policeman-with-heart Marcelo (the very handsome and gifted actor Jose 'aka Josep' Linuesa) and when her 'man' Placido reveals himself for what he is (a greedy, heartless pimp), Elisa works with Marcelo to uncover the mob violence of the streets to gain a return to her beloved Montevideo.  How the story ends is left to the pleasure of the viewer.Apparently this story is based on some degree of fact: in the 1980s to the present many Latin American women have been promised wealth in joining the prostitution business in Spain only to become victims of white slavery.  Director Silva is able to make this rather terrifying reality into a story that, though sensual, is never in bad taste: the story is more important that portraying the sex-for-sale scenes.  Mariana Santangelo is a very fine actress and this film is just the right vehicle to put her in the ranks of international stardom.  The photography in both Uruguay and Spain is beautiful, the musical score is exceedingly well written and evocative, and the end result is a film that opens the door for Uruguayan films to be taken seriously.
