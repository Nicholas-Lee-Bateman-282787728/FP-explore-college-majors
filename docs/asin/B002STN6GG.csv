Good story lines, but not anything we would watch again.  Unfortunately, there are very few movies that do not have cuss words in them anymore.  From now on, no more movie buying.  I will stick to Netflix and then buy AFTER previewing a movie.",1,Not Family Friendly,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,357,"['4', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'had', 'cuss/swear', 'words', 'were', 'thrown', 'out', 'Good', 'story', 'lines', 'not', 'anything', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'cuss', 'words', 'anymore', 'now', 'more', 'movie', 'buying', 'will', 'stick', 'Netflix', 'then', 'buy', 'AFTER', 'previewing', 'movie']",N/A

(I also see that the single DVD of Silent Night on Amazon is $69, for real?) It is so not worth these prices.  I really love Silent Night.  It gives you a sense of life in Germany near the end of World War II and it is a very uplifting Christmas themed movie. The other films are ok but Silent Night was the drawing card for me.
