1131097,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B0011FDVGI,AIROLF,"[14, 27]","The movie is spectacular, especially when one considers that it's a made for TV film. This is unsurprising, however, because the Brits are unlikely to do a miserable job, regardless of the medium or the arena for their work. The saddest thing is that most people (including myself) will see the movie simply for the recognition that Daniel Radliffe (aka Harry Potter) brings to any movie of which he is a star. A sadder thing still is that Radcliffe is this movie's weakest link. His acting works for his Harry persona but is inappropriate for his character here.The movie's message of how aimless and pointless war is and how the sons should stay home, rather than fight is timely now as ever. David Haig, who also wrote the screenplay and served as an associate producer, is breathtaking as the writer Rudyard Kipling (Jungle Book). Kipling is a patriotic propagandist who sends his only son to battle, even though his son is unequipped to fight due to blindness. Haig is simultaneously powerful and vulnerable; he is captivating as a storyteller and speech-giver, and cruel and hard to sympathize with in his inability to see that he is sending his only son to certain death.This movie also benefits from having a surprisingly convincing turn from Kim Cattrall (known best for her portrayal of promiscuous Samantha on Sex and the City) as a mother in a desperate search to find any news, even if its devastating, of her son. Fans of BBC's delightful adaptation of Bleak House also get to experience Carey Mulligan's charm and talent once more.",4,David Haig shines in this WWII drama,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,1546,"['movie', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'unsurprising', 'however', 'Brits', 'are', 'unlikely', 'do', 'miserable', 'job', 'regardless', 'medium', 'arena', 'work', 'saddest', 'thing', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'simply', 'recognition', 'Daniel', 'Radliffe', 'aka', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'star', 'sadder', 'thing', 'still', 'Radcliffe', 'movie', 'weakest', 'link', 'acting', 'works', 'Harry', 'persona', 'inappropriate', 'character', 'here.The', 'movie', 'message', 'how', 'aimless', 'pointless', 'war', 'how', 'sons', 'should', 'stay', 'home', 'rather', 'fight', 'timely', 'now', 'ever', 'David', 'Haig', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'served', 'associate', 'producer', 'breathtaking', 'writer', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Kipling', 'patriotic', 'propagandist', 'who', 'only', 'son', 'battle', 'even', 'son', 'unequipped', 'fight', 'due', 'blindness', 'Haig', 'simultaneously', 'powerful', 'vulnerable', 'captivating', 'storyteller', 'speech-giver', 'cruel', 'hard', 'sympathize', 'inability', 'see', 'sending', 'only', 'son', 'certain', 'death.This', 'movie', 'also', 'benefits', 'having', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'turn', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'known', 'best', 'portrayal', 'promiscuous', 'Samantha', 'Sex', 'City', 'mother', 'desperate', 'search', 'find', 'news', 'even', 'devastating', 'son', 'Fans', 'BBC', 'delightful', 'adaptation', 'Bleak', 'House', 'also', 'get', 'experience', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'charm', 'talent', 'once', 'more']",N/A

The conflict in the Kipling family was the key issue of the film, and the obedient, young lieutenant trying hard to please others and prove himself was the catalyst for a very deep film. It further exaggerated the class difference in England during the period and put into prospective what others might have been feeling. It was also the story of wasted lives, heroism, leadership, bravery beyond all limits. The acting was fantastic, the scenery breathe taking, and the portrayal of the period as accurate as one could have expected. This was a great film where a personal story delivered a message that should still be appreciated in these times. In one scene, LT Kipling asks his platoon, ""Why are you here"" ?

When World War One breaks out Jack is eager to join and Rudyard supports the war.  Indeed Rudyard is a major figure in the British system.  His poetry is full of dash and pro-imperialistic imagery (this interpretation though, is arguably wrong) and he is a major recruting tool.His son Jack has hopelessly bad eyesight and is thus unfit for officer duties.  Rudyard however, pulls strings and gets Jack a commission.All of this occurs as the casualties mount and British military disasters increase.The suspense increases enormously as Jack completes his training and heads to the front where he becomes Missing in Action.

1131104,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B0011FDVGI,David A. Wend,"[42, 43]","It has been a long time since I saw a Masterpiece (Theater) program that was so thought provoking and moving; the performances are superb and true to heart.  David Haig (who wrote the play My Boy Jack) is the very image of Rudyard Kipling.  He is shows us the jingoistic author who believes that war against the Germans is a crusade to keep the Huns out of England.  When he must confront the loss of his son, Mr. Haig shows the emotional side of Kipling with great tenderness.  His son John Kipling (in fact his youngest child) is caught up in the belief that the war will be an heroic adventure, but he also wants to go to war because it will be a release for him to become his own man and escape from his father's fame and reputation.  For me, Daniel Radcliffe did an excellent job of portraying the dissatisfaction that Jack has with his life and his desire to escape. Kim Cattrall is nicely cast as Jack's mother.  Kipling married the daughter of his American literary agent and lived in the United States for several years before returning to England.  Ms. Cattrall sensitively conveys the grief over the loss of Jack and the hope that everyone holds that as long as a body has not been found there is a chance for life.Also of interest is that the film was made at the Kipling home - Bateman - which is now owned by the National Trust.  Daniel Radcliffe mentioned in an interview that he saw a place where the real John Kipling had carved his initials.  The battlefield scenes are well conceived and the actors convey the fear and horror of war perfectly.

1131108,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0011FDVGI,D. S. Thurlow,"[81, 83]","2007's ""My Boy Jack"" is an extraordinarily good drama for television, featuring an excellent cast and a compelling story about the First World War, based on a play and a screenplay by David Haig.When Britain goes to war with Imperial Germany in 1914, young men sign up in droves for the military.  John ""Jack"" Kipling, son of famous writer and British Empire advocate Rudyard Kipling, is anxious to serve in uniform but rejected due to poor eyesight.  Overruling the concerns of his wife and daughter, Kipling Senior pulls some strings to get Jack a commission in the Irish Guards.  Jack works hard to overcome the challenge of his eyesight, in the process becoming a competent lieutenant and earning the respect of his platoon.  All too quickly, Jack ships out for the Western Front, where he goes missing in action in his first mission ""over the top"" from the trenches at Loos in 1915.  The family will spend agonizing months trying to learn his whereabouts.  A shell-shocked member of Jack's platoon will finally bring word of Jack's fate.David Haig is uncanny as Rudyard Kipling, Jack's father, a superbly talented storyteller and novelist, now a government propagandist trying to make sense of hideous casualties.  His efforts to enable his son to ""do his part"" will be a source of immense guilt when Jack goes missing.  Kim Cattrell is astonishingly good as Carrie, Jack's American mother.  Haunted by the loss of another child, Carrie advocates for a position of less danger for her son, whom she fears will be at additional risk due to his poor eyesight.  When Jack goes missing, Carrie is relentless in tracking down clues to his possible fate.  Carey Mulligan is very effective as Elsie ""Bird"" Kipling, Jack's sympathetic older sister, who shares with him the stifling burden of living in the shadow of a very prominent father.  Daniel Radcliff is absolutely credible as Jack, whether braving the challenge of military training or sneaking cigarettes with his sister.At the core of the drama is the haunting question of whether Jack should have gone into service in the first place.  The family argues over Kipling Senior's efforts to get Jack preferential treatment, but the story makes clear that Jack is very much a volunteer.  Moreover, it is apparent that Jack, out from under his father's shadow, is transformed by his few months in uniform from boy to man, performing with exemplary bravery and with compassion for his soldiers.Production values are exceptionally good for a television movie.  At least some filming was done at Kipling's home of Bateman in Southern England.  Period costumes and manners are spot-on. The recreation of the Western Front is appropriately wet, muddy, and terrifying.  The closing scene, in which Rudyard Kipling comforts King George V for the unexpected loss of his own child by reciting a moving poem, is a perfect ending for the movie.This movie is very highly recommended as compelling period family drama.",5,Coming of Age in a Time of War...,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,2957,"['2007', 'Boy', 'Jack', 'extraordinarily', 'good', 'drama', 'television', 'featuring', 'excellent', 'cast', 'compelling', 'story', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'based', 'play', 'screenplay', 'David', 'Haig.When', 'Britain', 'war', 'Imperial', 'Germany', '1914', 'young', 'men', 'sign', 'up', 'droves', 'military', 'John', 'Jack', 'Kipling', 'son', 'famous', 'writer', 'British', 'Empire', 'advocate', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'anxious', 'serve', 'uniform', 'rejected', 'due', 'poor', 'eyesight', 'Overruling', 'concerns', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Kipling', 'Senior', 'strings', 'get', 'Jack', 'commission', 'Irish', 'Guards', 'Jack', 'hard', 'overcome', 'challenge', 'eyesight', 'process', 'becoming', 'competent', 'lieutenant', 'earning', 'respect', 'platoon', 'too', 'quickly', 'Jack', 'out', 'Western', 'Front', 'where', 'missing', 'action', 'first', 'mission', 'top', 'trenches', 'Loos', '1915', 'family', 'will', 'spend', 'agonizing', 'months', 'trying', 'learn', 'whereabouts', 'shell-shocked', 'member', 'Jack', 'platoon', 'will', 'finally', 'bring', 'word', 'Jack', 'fate.David', 'Haig', 'uncanny', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'Jack', 'father', 'superbly', 'talented', 'storyteller', 'novelist', 'now', 'government', 'propagandist', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'hideous', 'casualties', 'efforts', 'enable', 'son', 'do', 'part', 'will', 'be', 'source', 'immense', 'guilt', 'when', 'Jack', 'missing', 'Kim', 'Cattrell', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'Carrie', 'Jack', 'American', 'mother', 'Haunted', 'loss', 'child', 'Carrie', 'position', 'less', 'danger', 'son', 'whom', 'will', 'be', 'additional', 'risk', 'due', 'poor', 'eyesight', 'When', 'Jack', 'missing', 'Carrie', 'relentless', 'tracking', 'down', 'clues', 'possible', 'fate', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'very', 'effective', 'Elsie', 'Bird', 'Kipling', 'Jack', 'sympathetic', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'shares', 'stifling', 'burden', 'living', 'shadow', 'very', 'prominent', 'father', 'Daniel', 'Radcliff', 'absolutely', 'credible', 'Jack', 'braving', 'challenge', 'military', 'training', 'sneaking', 'cigarettes', 'sister.At', 'core', 'drama', 'haunting', 'question', 'Jack', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'service', 'first', 'place', 'family', 'Kipling', 'Senior', 'efforts', 'get', 'Jack', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'story', 'clear', 'Jack', 'very', 'much', 'volunteer', 'Moreover', 'apparent', 'Jack', 'father', 'shadow', 'transformed', 'few', 'months', 'uniform', 'boy', 'man', 'performing', 'exemplary', 'bravery', 'compassion', 'soldiers.Production', 'values', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'television', 'movie', 'least', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'Kipling', 'home', 'Bateman', 'Southern', 'England', 'Period', 'costumes', 'manners', 'are', 'spot-on', 'recreation', 'Western', 'Front', 'appropriately', 'wet', 'muddy', 'terrifying', 'closing', 'scene', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'unexpected', 'loss', 'own', 'child', 'reciting', 'moving', 'poem', 'perfect', 'ending', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'compelling', 'period', 'family', 'drama']",N/A

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 6]","MY BOY JACK (2007-2008), first put on as a play, written/produced by and starring the magnificent David Haig (""The Thin Blue Line"") as Rudyard Kipling, was a long-anticipated revelation. I became interested in this because Daniel Radcliffe was in it (as Kipling's son John a/k/a Jack) - the earliest project he took on while filming HARRY POTTER.Haig's account is that he became interested in the whole project because of his startling resemblance to Kipling - and his father's personality resembling Kipling's also. Though he began listing about as early as 1985, finding no one to write for him, he finally mounted his play. The end result is this excellent and unsentimental film.As Haig has stated, it is a film about war: how one single casualty involves a whole world of people, and here, how Kipling blamed himself for letting his son go off to the trenches of WWI. The film follows mainly along two lines, Rudyard's near-jingoist support of the war and Jack's anxiety to get away from home. Naturally, Jack wants to go into the Royal Navy but his near-sightedness stops him cold.Radcliffe has admitted that we do not know exactly what transpired with the Kiplings in real life; the film is spectacular in its skill, its direction and the acting. Kim Cattrall, as Rudyard's American wife Carrie, is a revelation here. I haven't enjoyed her so much before. The scenes in the trenches are at once heart wrenching and almost sweet (the way all are concerned about one another). The fear, felt by all, is as palpable as the lighting.It was especially grand to see King George V (Julian Wadham, who greatly resembles the real king in appearance and voice) in his role as pal to Kipling, who visits him twice in the film. The rank and file of the Irish battalion are all competent and moving to see. The noises of war got to me but not at the expense of the drama, and that shows the greatness of this work.While Haig thought through the state of Kipling and his relation to war, Radcliffe thought about Jack and his relationship with the family. They filmed the goodbye scene - the last scene Radcliffe shot - at the Kipling home. Radcliffe shuddered as he stood where the real John Kipling stood saying goodbye to his father, and saw John's initials, which John had carved into the archway.These details may bore a bit, but not for me: they are the bones and marrow of any story. It is tough for me to pay any attention to war films and I do not undertake viewing lightly. Haig is a master for bringing this to life as he has done.(As an added treat, I suggest fans of this and David Haig's overall work get their hands on the book, ""My Boy Jack?"" by Tonie and Valmai Holt. Jack's body was never found, in spite of Kipling's tireless efforts which are sadly not addressed in the film.A few years back the British government claimed it had identified both his grave and his remains. Jack vanished in action aged 18, and the accounts of what happened are conflicting - hence Radcliffe's remark that ""we do not know exactly what happened"". The Holts' book addresses these and the doubts about Jack Kipling; it really makes the viewer wonder what can have happened to him.)This is an excellent, not-to-be-missed classic. I'm only sorry Haig had to do it as tv film, ending up in America on Masterpiece Theater and not as a major motion picture. These gems too often do not get made at all, or end up in the backwaters of tv. Especially in this case, I'm getting damned tired of that.",5,"""Not this tide, nor any tide""",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,3482,"['BOY', 'JACK', '2007-2008', 'first', 'put', 'play', 'written/produced', 'starring', 'magnificent', 'David', 'Haig', 'Thin', 'Blue', 'Line', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'was', 'long-anticipated', 'revelation', 'became', 'interested', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'was', 'Kipling', 'son', 'John', 'Jack', 'earliest', 'project', 'took', 'filming', 'HARRY', 'POTTER.Haig', 'account', 'became', 'interested', 'whole', 'project', 'startling', 'resemblance', 'Kipling', 'father', 'personality', 'resembling', 'Kipling', 'also', 'began', 'listing', 'about', 'as', 'early', '1985', 'finding', 'one', 'write', 'finally', 'mounted', 'play', 'end', 'result', 'excellent', 'unsentimental', 'film.As', 'Haig', 'stated', 'film', 'war', 'how', 'one', 'single', 'casualty', 'whole', 'world', 'people', 'here', 'how', 'Kipling', 'blamed', 'letting', 'son', 'go', 'off', 'trenches', 'WWI', 'film', 'mainly', 'along', 'two', 'lines', 'Rudyard', 'near-jingoist', 'support', 'war', 'Jack', 'anxiety', 'get', 'away', 'home', 'Naturally', 'Jack', 'go', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'near-sightedness', 'stops', 'cold.Radcliffe', 'admitted', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'transpired', 'Kiplings', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'spectacular', 'skill', 'direction', 'acting', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Rudyard', 'American', 'wife', 'Carrie', 'revelation', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'scenes', 'trenches', 'are', 'once', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'almost', 'sweet', 'way', 'are', 'concerned', 'one', 'fear', 'felt', 'as', 'palpable', 'lighting.It', 'was', 'especially', 'grand', 'see', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'Julian', 'Wadham', 'who', 'greatly', 'real', 'king', 'appearance', 'voice', 'role', 'pal', 'Kipling', 'who', 'twice', 'film', 'rank', 'file', 'Irish', 'battalion', 'are', 'competent', 'moving', 'see', 'noises', 'war', 'got', 'not', 'expense', 'drama', 'greatness', 'work.While', 'Haig', 'thought', 'state', 'Kipling', 'relation', 'war', 'Radcliffe', 'thought', 'Jack', 'relationship', 'family', 'filmed', 'goodbye', 'scene', 'last', 'scene', 'Radcliffe', 'shot', 'Kipling', 'home', 'Radcliffe', 'shuddered', 'stood', 'where', 'real', 'John', 'Kipling', 'stood', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'father', 'saw', 'John', 'initials', 'John', 'had', 'carved', 'archway.These', 'details', 'may', 'bore', 'bit', 'not', 'are', 'bones', 'marrow', 'story', 'tough', 'pay', 'attention', 'war', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'undertake', 'viewing', 'lightly', 'Haig', 'master', 'bringing', 'life', 'done', 'added', 'treat', 'suggest', 'fans', 'David', 'Haig', 'overall', 'work', 'get', 'hands', 'book', 'Boy', 'Jack', 'Tonie', 'Valmai', 'Holt', 'Jack', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'spite', 'Kipling', 'tireless', 'efforts', 'are', 'sadly', 'not', 'addressed', 'film.A', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'British', 'government', 'claimed', 'had', 'identified', 'grave', 'remains', 'Jack', 'vanished', 'action', 'aged', '18', 'accounts', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'conflicting', 'hence', 'Radcliffe', 'remark', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Holts', 'book', 'doubts', 'Jack', 'Kipling', 'really', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'what', 'can', 'have', 'happened', 'excellent', 'not-to-be-missed', 'classic', ""'m"", 'only', 'sorry', 'Haig', 'had', 'do', 'tv', 'film', 'ending', 'up', 'America', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'not', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'gems', 'too', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'made', 'end', 'up', 'backwaters', 'tv', 'Especially', 'case', ""'m"", 'getting', 'damned', 'tired']",N/A

The portrait painted is beautifully balanced as Kipling is equally a family man and equally a son of the Crown.  He wants nothing but the best for his son, but is what is best what his son wants?  Jack is stifled by the Kipling household and wants to gain his independence from the family whom he loves dearly; but like all boys of  WW1, the notion of War for King and Country sweep the imagination.  Jack and his father long to see him as a Naval Officer, but when Jack's nearsightedness makes him not a candidate to fight the glorious battle, strings are pulled to get Jack into the Irish Guard as an officer.

Having read quite a few of Mr. Kipling's stories in my childhood, I was intrigued by this made for tv drama.  Daniel Radcliffe does a fine job as young Jack.  At first Jack wants to join the Navy, then is rejected due to his poor eyesight.  His father is furious with the Naval doctors and eventually Jack decides to give the Army a try.  Needless to say he can only see the eye chart by moving closer to it and Mr. K. pleads with a former Field Marshall to pull a few strings to get Jack into the Army.  Needless to say Jack winds up in basic training and becomes a 2nd Lieutenant.  He gets his own regiment and the scenes of war show plenty of action and you observe how frightened these young men were as they prepared for their first open air battle.  I thought all the actors in this film did high quality work, including the small supporting role of a boy named Peter, who Jack trusted to take good care of his motorcycle.  Peter has a moving scene with Mr. Kipling, who makes them both tea and fights back tears as he makes up a story about young Peter and Jack as soldiers fighting together.

I think the cast did an excellient job and that the story was for the most part well-written. Where the film fails however is in its depiction of the war itself and the main character's experiences.Nearly all of the details in France are simply wrong. The people who made the film ignore accuracy in favor of giving an ""impression"" of the war. And so we get rain and foot problems and backdrops more appopriate to much later in the war.The details of what happened on the battlefield are lost as well. The film wants to show an utterly hopeless attack where men are simply cut to pieces from the start advancing against an impossible objective. The impression is also given that Kipling was all alone as an officer in the attack. That too is false. The one detail I cannot forgive is the fiction introduced about is vision being a problem during the battle. Bad vision means blurry vision. It does not mean being blind or helpless without eyeglasses as was implied.Aside from the battlefield flaws, everything else is very well done. Father and son played their respective parts very well.

The presentation has to compress and eliminate many details so I think it would have better served its purpose if it had been allowed to be a longer production - maybe three hours.  I marked it down for this purpose only.The acting performances were outstanding on all levels - from David Haig's Kipling to the nameless men in young John's (Jack) platoon waiting to go over the top in the mud and muck of Loos.  Everyone did their parts to perfection.  The attention to detail was outstanding although I could quibble that one man's South Africa War medal ribbons were in the wrong order.You recieve a great sense of what it was like on the western front in 1915.  Not glorious or romantic - rather a quagmire of mud and muck where the biggest concern was trench foot and keeping your rifle in working order when it was caked in mud.  About the only creatures that seemed to enjoy the western front were the rats.Kipling has a very complex role in this film.  On the one hand he wants to aid his son achieve his ambition of entering the military.  On the other hand he is on the committee that is dealing with releasing war news to the public and the horrific casualty rates - over 11,000 officers and men killed, wounded and missing in one day in one battle.  Kipling's feeling that it is best to be upfront with the numbers as that will inspire others to serve to remember those who had gone before them.  I'm not sure that was good thinking for later in the war but I can understand his logic at the start.The meeting with the King, as they both share the loss of a son - Kipling and his son Jack, George V and his son John.  They were meeting as fathers in mourning, not king and subject.  The scene is extremely powerful.The commentarries by the actors in the afterward of the DVD were also quite impressive and thought provoking.  Kim Cattrell's comments are especially important as she talks of her grandfather and her father and the effects that World Wars I and II had on them and what she wanted to achieve for her nephew as the war in Iraq was starting up as this was filmed.It is a complex story that is well told and acted.

Elder Kipling is well established writer best known for his ""Jungle Book"" stories for young boys.  He and his family are comfortably tucked in British countryside and his society connections give elder Kipling high social status.  His family is close knit and loving, but at the time of upcoming Great War, elder Kipling's unwavering patriotism is means for Jack to create his own adult life.  At the age when most boys would plan going to college or striking on their own, Jack views the war as a way of getting into adulthood, away from his parents, their overwhelming love and his own constricted existence.  It seems to him that going to war is the most natural way to strike on his own.  But Jack's eyesight vision is so poor, that he gets rejected for active military service twice: once by the navy and the second time by the army.  It is only thru his father's connections that he is accepted in the military, where he puts extra efort to finish his basic training and become an office before the age of 18.  Soon, young Jack is dispatched to the front in Loos, Northern France, where only one day after his 18th birthday, he is killed in the battle.  It is a bittersweet story of a young man trying to build his own identity during the difficult time in the history and his father, who living thru the young man is fostering his own patriotic desire for the glory of England and tradition.  Kim Catrall gives stunning performance as Jack's mother who in the course of 6 months changes from vivacious mother to a grief stricken, old woman broken to pieces once she learns that her missing son is in fact killed in the war.",4,Coming of age and patriotism,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1729,"['Amazing', 'story', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'young', 'son', 'John', 'Kipling', 'Jack', 'start', 'WWI', 'Elder', 'Kipling', 'well', 'established', 'writer', 'best', 'known', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'stories', 'young', 'boys', 'family', 'are', 'comfortably', 'tucked', 'British', 'countryside', 'society', 'connections', 'give', 'elder', 'Kipling', 'high', 'social', 'status', 'family', 'close', 'knit', 'loving', 'time', 'upcoming', 'Great', 'War', 'elder', 'Kipling', 'unwavering', 'patriotism', 'means', 'Jack', 'create', 'own', 'adult', 'life', 'age', 'when', 'most', 'boys', 'would', 'plan', 'going', 'college', 'striking', 'own', 'Jack', 'war', 'way', 'getting', 'adulthood', 'away', 'parents', 'overwhelming', 'love', 'own', 'constricted', 'existence', 'going', 'war', 'most', 'natural', 'way', 'strike', 'own', 'Jack', 'eyesight', 'vision', 'so', 'poor', 'rejected', 'active', 'military', 'service', 'twice', 'once', 'navy', 'second', 'time', 'army', 'only', 'thru', 'father', 'connections', 'accepted', 'military', 'where', 'extra', 'efort', 'finish', 'basic', 'training', 'become', 'office', 'age', '18', 'Soon', 'young', 'Jack', 'dispatched', 'front', 'Loos', 'Northern', 'France', 'where', 'only', 'one', 'day', '18th', 'birthday', 'killed', 'battle', 'bittersweet', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'build', 'own', 'identity', 'difficult', 'time', 'history', 'father', 'who', 'living', 'thru', 'young', 'man', 'fostering', 'own', 'patriotic', 'desire', 'glory', 'England', 'tradition', 'Kim', 'Catrall', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Jack', 'mother', 'who', 'course', '6', 'months', 'changes', 'vivacious', 'mother', 'grief', 'stricken', 'old', 'woman', 'pieces', 'once', 'missing', 'son', 'fact', 'killed', 'war']",N/A
