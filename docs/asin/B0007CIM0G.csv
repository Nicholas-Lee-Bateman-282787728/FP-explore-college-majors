I sometimes enjoy using it like a drill as well! That's whenever I feel my hips have gone a bit rusty from sitting around too much. I won't repeat what other reviewers have already detailed, but I must second their appreciation of her straightforward, unforced and gentle approach. She's very feminine and although she doesn't seem to strongly relate to the video-viewer, you can't help liking her.I was tempted to shave off a point for these reasons:1. The Cairo footage is interesting, but only once. It has no replay value and an instructional DVD should have stuff you need again and again.2. The menu'ing isn't done very well and you can't easily get to what you want,3. There's a very stilted way of presenting the rhythms, as one revewer mentioned, using the same sentences and standing up to say one sentence, sitting down to say the next.4. Sona seems very bouncy on some of the moves and I suspect that one could pick up the wrong habit. This is particularly on the lazy accent moves where she seems to lose a whole foot of  height.5. The exact music or tracks you could use are not on the cd.But I didn't because1. The video has a lot of content and a whole CD of music on top of that. So one can't quibble really, at this cost.2. She doesn't bounce while actually executing the moves.I would love to see another video from Sonia--something outside of the drum solo area.",5,Demystifies the drum solo for beginners,1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,1508,"['excellent', 'particularly', 'beginner-friendly', 'video', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'sometimes', 'enjoy', 'using', 'drill', 'as', 'well', 'whenever', 'feel', 'hips', 'have', 'gone', 'bit', 'rusty', 'sitting', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'detailed', 'must', 'second', 'appreciation', 'straightforward', 'unforced', 'gentle', 'approach', 'very', 'feminine', ""n't"", 'seem', 'strongly', 'relate', 'video-viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'her.I', 'was', 'tempted', 'shave', 'off', 'point', 'reasons:1', 'Cairo', 'footage', 'interesting', 'only', 'once', 'replay', 'value', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'stuff', 'need', 'again', 'again.2', ""menu'ing"", ""n't"", 'done', 'very', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'easily', 'get', 'what', 'want,3', 'very', 'stilted', 'way', 'presenting', 'rhythms', 'one', 'revewer', 'mentioned', 'using', 'same', 'sentences', 'standing', 'up', 'say', 'one', 'sentence', 'sitting', 'down', 'say', 'next.4', 'Sona', 'very', 'bouncy', 'moves', 'suspect', 'one', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'wrong', 'habit', 'particularly', 'lazy', 'accent', 'moves', 'where', 'lose', 'whole', 'foot', 'height.5', 'exact', 'music', 'tracks', 'could', 'use', 'are', 'not', 'cd.But', 'did', ""n't"", 'because1', 'video', 'lot', 'content', 'whole', 'CD', 'music', 'top', 'So', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quibble', 'really', 'cost.2', ""n't"", 'bounce', 'actually', 'executing', 'moves.I', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'video', 'Sonia', 'something', 'drum', 'solo', 'area']",N/A

I kept returning to the video and decided to take a punt and buy it.I am very glad I did. Firstly CD is a nice bonus and I am enjoying that.  I love the Cairo little documentary too.Now on to the meaty stuff.I find Sonia very nice to listen to calm and sweet.  She is very graceful and I love her style.  The choreo is just right for my level - that of 2years dancing so beyond beginner early intermediate.She does go over the moves, and in fairness whilst some she describes well its not really for a total beginner and her instructions are not as clear as say my dvds from Rania Renee, Jenna, Autumn, and other wonderful teachers. However, as the dance is not for total beginner, neither do the moves need to be broken down to that level either.I like the way she goes over the move then you can practice together and she does it from front back and side angles.Anyway long story short I love it and can't wait to spend some concentrated time learning the dance.So I would recommend it to an advanced beginner who after viewing the preview on Youtube likes the style - then this is great!I am sure it will stay in my library for a long time :-)",5,Glad I got it despite some other reviews,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,1251,"['saw', 'clip', 'tube', 'appealed', 'then', 'checked', 'out', 'reviews', 'were', 'mixed', 'kept', 'returning', 'video', 'decided', 'take', 'punt', 'buy', 'it.I', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'Firstly', 'CD', 'nice', 'bonus', 'am', 'enjoying', 'love', 'Cairo', 'little', 'documentary', 'too.Now', 'meaty', 'stuff.I', 'find', 'Sonia', 'very', 'nice', 'listen', 'calm', 'sweet', 'very', 'graceful', 'love', 'style', 'choreo', 'just', 'right', 'level', '2years', 'dancing', 'so', 'beginner', 'early', 'intermediate.She', 'go', 'moves', 'fairness', 'whilst', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'total', 'beginner', 'instructions', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'say', 'dvds', 'Rania', 'Renee', 'Jenna', 'Autumn', 'other', 'wonderful', 'teachers', 'However', 'dance', 'not', 'total', 'beginner', 'do', 'moves', 'need', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'level', 'either.I', 'way', 'move', 'then', 'can', 'practice', 'together', 'front', 'back', 'side', 'angles.Anyway', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'spend', 'concentrated', 'time', 'learning', 'dance.So', 'would', 'recommend', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'who', 'viewing', 'preview', 'Youtube', 'style', 'then', 'great', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'stay', 'library', 'long', 'time']",N/A

That said, she did a better job of teaching and demonstrating then I thought she would.  I agree with others that the drum solo lacks passion, but I think that it lacking excitement makes it easier for beginners to learn.  I thought that most of the combinations were cute and I will include some of them in my own dances.  I would not perform the dance in its entirety because it is too simple , lacks passion, and I can't find the music.  The CD that is included has three drum solos that are fun but also are on another CD called the Dancing Drum that has Jillina on the cover.  There is a fourth drum solo that is not on the Dancing Drum CD. There are also other songs that are not drum solos. It is a full length CD but the rythms that are covered on the DVD are not on the CD  so it is not a cd to practice your rythms to.  I personally liked the section where sonia and issam go the cairo.

879823,A2U0W6B8IVRVXI,B0007CIM0G,Laura J. Johnson,"[9, 9]","I've always been intrigued by belly dancing and so I've made it my New Year's resolution to learn how to do the dance in the privacy of my own home and to hopefully get in shape. I have bought a few other belly dance instruction dvds but have decided that this one will be the primary one I use for now.I'm 43 years old, overweight, and out of shape. This video works well for me because it focuses on the actual instruction of the dance. For those wanting a workout you may want to choose something else calling themselves a belly dance workout. But this DVD is definitely a workout for me. It gets me sweating but probably won't for someone in fairly good shape. Yet I feel that as I improve I'll be a hot mama doing an impressive and sexy dance.I think Sonia is an excellent teacher and emphasizes good form. The drummer gives one occasional breaks as he discusses the rhythm he's about to perform so there isn't constant movement which gives me momentary rest while learning a bit about belly dancing to drum solos.I also enjoyed the extra feature of Sonia and Issam's ""home movie"" of their trip to exotic Cairo where we see the two of them shopping for among other things belly dance costumes and drums. We also see Sonia taking dance lessons from Cairo instructors who teach her a few new moves indicating that the dance is a bit different depending on the geographical area one is.The DVD is a good price on Amazon and includes a second disk with music by Issam to create your own drum solos.",5,FOR THOSE WHO REALLY HAVE BELLIES,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,1499,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'intrigued', 'belly', 'dancing', 'so', ""'ve"", 'made', 'New', 'Year', 'resolution', 'learn', 'how', 'do', 'dance', 'privacy', 'own', 'home', 'hopefully', 'get', 'shape', 'have', 'bought', 'few', 'other', 'belly', 'dance', 'instruction', 'dvds', 'have', 'decided', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'primary', 'one', 'use', 'now.I', ""'m"", '43', 'years', 'old', 'overweight', 'shape', 'video', 'well', 'actual', 'instruction', 'dance', 'wanting', 'workout', 'may', 'want', 'choose', 'something', 'else', 'calling', 'belly', 'dance', 'workout', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'workout', 'sweating', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'someone', 'fairly', 'good', 'shape', 'feel', 'improve', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hot', 'mama', 'doing', 'impressive', 'sexy', 'dance.I', 'think', 'Sonia', 'excellent', 'teacher', 'good', 'form', 'drummer', 'one', 'occasional', 'breaks', 'rhythm', 'perform', 'so', ""n't"", 'constant', 'movement', 'momentary', 'rest', 'learning', 'bit', 'belly', 'dancing', 'drum', 'solos.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'extra', 'feature', 'Sonia', 'Issam', 'home', 'movie', 'trip', 'exotic', 'Cairo', 'where', 'see', 'two', 'shopping', 'other', 'things', 'belly', 'dance', 'costumes', 'drums', 'also', 'see', 'Sonia', 'taking', 'dance', 'lessons', 'Cairo', 'instructors', 'who', 'teach', 'few', 'new', 'moves', 'indicating', 'dance', 'bit', 'different', 'depending', 'geographical', 'area', 'one', 'is.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'price', 'Amazon', 'second', 'disk', 'music', 'Issam', 'create', 'own', 'drum', 'solos']",N/A

879825,A23IK1W2EH3LUT,B0007CIM0G,Ms. 2Step,"[0, 0]",This was what I needed. I have a few advanced drum solo's. This one helped a lot with the beats and the basics moves to the drums. It is more of a break down so that you can work your way up to the harder ones. Drum solo's are just learning how to make your body mimic the beat of the drums and to master isolations and layering to different beats at the same time. out of the basic beginner drum sols' this one will give you the foundation you need. just like in basic belly dance you need a good foundation before you can do the harder moves. I tried jumping into learning the harder ones first. I prefer to work smarter not harder. Become confident in the foundation and then the harder moves will be less stressing. The key is to be able to develop your own technigue or style and to be able to apply the moves without watcing the dvd to a piece of music. This comes with a music dvd to practice to for the price you can't beat what you are getting. The Art of Drum solo is saying you are learning the foundation and there is a Art to it.

879827,AMNX4BNJMESVM,B0007CIM0G,Nikkiya,"[19, 22]","Sonia presents in this video as I have seen her live: graceful, synchronized, and feminine. There are five parts to the CD: the instruction called ""The Art of the Drum Solo,"" then ""Performance,"" ""Sonia & Issam Go To Cairo,"" ""Also Available,"" and ""Merchandise"".For the instruction, Sonia wears a workout outfit and coin belt and Issam introduces each rhythm then sits to the side to play his doumbek drum. Sonia leads a warm up, then the video goes into technique. Sonia introduces a several different movements to coincide with each rhythm. She breaks down each movement, then performs it. For example, the saiidi rhythm is introduced, then Sonia teaches hip drops (without and with a kick), piston hips, 4 point locks, and Egyptian shimmy, Then the next rhythm is introduced, then more movements, etc. The rhythms include maksoum, kuwaiti, fellahi, karatchi, and malfouf. After the rhythms and selected movements are reviewed, there is a choreography portion where the movements are transitioned into combinations. While the video may seem straight-forward to some, it is a good breakdown of basic to intermediate technique. Combinations and transitions are often a big hurdle for students to learn, but Sonia's explanations make it easy. In addition, Sonia's combinations can be easily modified to suit one's own style.Issam looks a little silly at times, grinning at Sonia as she dances, but he is endearing. One gains a sense of how these two amazing performers communicate through music and rhythm.Sonia's performance draws on the elements of her instruction, and when performed in real time looks polished and professional. By nature, Sonia is not boisterous or overwhelming. She is Sonia, somewhat subtle in her own right, but as previously mentioned: graceful, synchronized, feminine.Clips from a shopping trip to Cairo are included which provides for some laughs and a glimpse of Egyptian city life. There are, for example, a few clips of Sonia taking lessons from Raqia Hassan, then Sonia shopping in a store with gorgeous cabaret costumes packed on shelves from floor to ceiling. Issam checks out doumbek drums and talks candidly about drumming and belly dancing. Sonia even receives a marriage proposal (in exchange for camels) from one lovestruck admirer.The last two chapters are self-explanatory. The bonus music CD is a nice perk and includes some oriental pop songs and drum solos.I found this DVD helpful in the context that it is oriented towards those students who use videos to augment their technique.

879828,A18AJZ4NYUMFG6,B0007CIM0G,Parthena Black,"[14, 14]","Due to the title and description, I honestly wasn't sure if I was buying a bellydance or drumming DVD. I'm interested in both, so it was no big deal. I was pleased to see that it's both. Master drummer Issam teaches and helps us understand the different bellydance drum rhythms and accomplished dancer and Bellydance Superstar Sonia shows us which bellydance movements work for each one.As an intermediate level dancer, I found it challenging as both a workout and a practice tool. The more I practice it, the more I like it. You need to set aside the time and have the energy to get through about an hour of dancing! As a bellydance lesson, I find Sonia to be an excellent teacher. Without her glamorous superstar persona, she looks about 17 years old in workout gear and a ponytail. After a great warm-up that includes some great balancing exercises, Sonia breaks down each movement and practices it with music before moving on to the choreography toward the end. Issam names, breaks down and explains each drumbeat. A review of each movement is included in the choreography.Yes, the moves are ""basic,"" but it never hurts to practice and perfect basic moves no matter how many years you've been dancing. The challenge lies in learning how to match your movements to the music. For instance, not every drum beat calls for shimmies and hip bumps - we learn that turns and walks are more appropriate for some of the faster beats. This DVD will help you not only with your drum solos but with all of your choreography because you're going to find these drumbeats in all bellydance music. If you don't like this DVD, you may not have an interest in learning both sides, or perhaps you want to be given a choreography instead of creating your own. While Sonia presents a sample choreography, the point is that you need to take what you learned to your own improvisation, a skill that every dancer needs to develop. The DVD is just an example of what you can put together. When you watch Sonia dance after doing this DVD, you'll notice that she uses all of the moves she teaches here in her own drum solos. There's a performance on the DVD that you can watch, and I've noticed that she uses these moves in the other performance DVD's I own. The moves being taught are ""basic"" because they are an important foundation in building drum solo choreography.I also enjoyed the bonus section, ""Sonia and Issam Go To Cairo"" where we see them shopping for drums and costumes and Sonia taking lessons from great Egyptian dancers. We get a glimpse into their personalities and the importance of communication between dancer and drummer. Sonia tests hip scarves and talks about how she doesn't care for one of the instructor's overtly sexual style and won't adapt it to her own, and the segment is peppered with humor.The bonus music CD contains great music by Issam, but I think it omits the song used on the DVD, which would have been helpful.  It's still a good buy for the price and a valuable addition to your library.I've found that I got so much more out of all of the videos and DVD's I own after I started taking professional classes. If you prefer to learn on your own, at least try to take a few classes to get the most out of your home library.To learn more about the history of bellydance and Sonia and the Bellydance Superstars' role in educating the public about this art form, check out the ""American Bellydancer"" DVD.",5,"Confusing Title, Clear Instruction",1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,3417,"['Due', 'title', 'description', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'buying', 'bellydance', 'drumming', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'interested', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'Master', 'drummer', 'Issam', 'teaches', 'understand', 'different', 'bellydance', 'drum', 'rhythms', 'accomplished', 'dancer', 'Bellydance', 'Superstar', 'Sonia', 'bellydance', 'movements', 'work', 'one.As', 'intermediate', 'level', 'dancer', 'found', 'challenging', 'workout', 'practice', 'tool', 'more', 'practice', 'more', 'need', 'set', 'aside', 'time', 'have', 'energy', 'get', 'hour', 'dancing', 'bellydance', 'lesson', 'find', 'Sonia', 'be', 'excellent', 'teacher', 'glamorous', 'superstar', 'persona', '17', 'years', 'old', 'workout', 'gear', 'ponytail', 'great', 'warm-up', 'great', 'balancing', 'exercises', 'Sonia', 'down', 'movement', 'practices', 'music', 'moving', 'choreography', 'end', 'Issam', 'names', 'breaks', 'down', 'drumbeat', 'review', 'movement', 'included', 'choreography.Yes', 'moves', 'are', 'basic', 'never', 'practice', 'perfect', 'basic', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dancing', 'challenge', 'learning', 'how', 'match', 'movements', 'music', 'instance', 'not', 'drum', 'beat', 'shimmies', 'hip', 'bumps', 'learn', 'turns', 'walks', 'are', 'more', 'appropriate', 'faster', 'beats', 'DVD', 'will', 'help', 'not', 'only', 'drum', 'solos', 'choreography', ""'re"", 'going', 'find', 'drumbeats', 'bellydance', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'interest', 'learning', 'sides', 'perhaps', 'want', 'be', 'given', 'choreography', 'instead', 'creating', 'own', 'Sonia', 'sample', 'choreography', 'point', 'need', 'take', 'what', 'learned', 'own', 'improvisation', 'skill', 'dancer', 'develop', 'DVD', 'just', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'When', 'watch', 'Sonia', 'dance', 'doing', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'moves', 'here', 'own', 'drum', 'solos', 'performance', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'moves', 'other', 'performance', 'DVD', 'own', 'moves', 'being', 'taught', 'are', 'basic', 'are', 'important', 'foundation', 'building', 'drum', 'solo', 'choreography.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'bonus', 'section', 'Sonia', 'Issam', 'Go', 'Cairo', 'where', 'see', 'shopping', 'drums', 'costumes', 'Sonia', 'taking', 'lessons', 'great', 'Egyptian', 'dancers', 'get', 'glimpse', 'personalities', 'importance', 'communication', 'dancer', 'drummer', 'Sonia', 'hip', 'scarves', 'talks', 'how', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'instructor', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'style', 'wo', ""n't"", 'adapt', 'own', 'segment', 'peppered', 'humor.The', 'bonus', 'music', 'CD', 'great', 'music', 'Issam', 'think', 'song', 'used', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'still', 'good', 'buy', 'price', 'valuable', 'addition', 'library.I', ""'ve"", 'found', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'videos', 'DVD', 'own', 'started', 'taking', 'professional', 'classes', 'prefer', 'learn', 'own', 'least', 'try', 'take', 'few', 'classes', 'get', 'most', 'home', 'library.To', 'learn', 'more', 'history', 'bellydance', 'Sonia', 'Bellydance', 'Superstars', 'role', 'educating', 'public', 'art', 'form', 'check', 'out', 'American', 'Bellydancer', 'DVD']",N/A

This was a good dvd to teach one how to gain the confidence to improvise.I like how she was able to give a combination to try for each of the rhythms she presented.  After trying this dvd I was able to turn on some arabic music and identify some of the beats, the combinations she taught were easy to apply and remember when I heard the familair beats and having those combinations to start with gave me more confidence to be able to hear for those rhythms and begin to create my own combinations.Another good drum solo dvd is 'the heartbeat of bellydance' with Jenna.  She presents a different set of rhythms and gives you 3 levels of choreography to full songs with some tips on how to improvise. These dvds are great together because they contain different sets of rhythms and you can expand your dance vocabulary.",5,Combinations for specific rhythms!,1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,974,"['Sometimes', 'rhythm', 'identification', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', 'many', 'rhythms', 'most', 'used', 'bellydance', 'have', 'plethora', 'names', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'good', 'dvd', 'teach', 'one', 'how', 'gain', 'confidence', 'improvise.I', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'give', 'combination', 'try', 'rhythms', 'presented', 'trying', 'dvd', 'was', 'able', 'turn', 'arabic', 'music', 'identify', 'beats', 'combinations', 'taught', 'were', 'easy', 'apply', 'remember', 'when', 'heard', 'familair', 'beats', 'having', 'combinations', 'start', 'gave', 'more', 'confidence', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'rhythms', 'begin', 'create', 'own', 'combinations.Another', 'good', 'drum', 'solo', 'dvd', ""'the"", 'heartbeat', 'bellydance', 'Jenna', 'different', 'set', 'rhythms', '3', 'levels', 'choreography', 'full', 'songs', 'tips', 'how', 'improvise', 'dvds', 'are', 'great', 'together', 'contain', 'different', 'sets', 'rhythms', 'can', 'expand', 'dance', 'vocabulary']",N/A

As a belly dance student, I had always been afraid of the drum solo, but this tape makes it seem really easy and fun.  I also agree with the reviewer who stated that the movements are not specifically suited to the rhythms.  However, Sonia does do a good job of breaking down the movements for the solo performance. To me, her voice is confident, yet gentle and she does not have that intimidating, irritating ""diva"" presence. I think beginning students will appreciate her persona.The bonus CD is good for practicing the movements.  It does not include the music to the choreography presented on the tape, but it presents good music.  Overall, I enjoyed this tape and would highly recommend it for beginning students.  I hope the producers will make a tape for intermediate and advanced dancers soon, and I'd like to see more of the teachers who were working with Sonia on the footage in Cairo.

The camerawork was nice & still for the most part, only a few unneeded camera angles & focused shots on her stomach, which is better then most other DVDs with crazy camerawork.The workout itself is 70 min long which is almsot twice as long as other ones. The drummer teaches for 10 seconds saying the beat then bplaying, then she teaches the technique slowly with great detail to posture & positioning w/o him playing, then normal speed 1-2x with him playing.I loved her persona, she seemed like a normal instructor, no fake smiling, she just concentrates on teaching & demonstrating.After she shows each move slowly for 40 min, she then repeats them again in combinations w/o music slowly, then again with music to put them all together in routine, repeating several moves together. There are so many different combinations & moves put together I was impressed.She didn't always start at the very beginning all over again every single time which was great, she would repeat 2 combinations at a time, then 4-5 combinations every so often so you wouldn't get bored repeating over & over. If wanted to always start at the beginning, you can always follow along with her performance option.I got quite a workout & could not finish the entire DVD all at once.
