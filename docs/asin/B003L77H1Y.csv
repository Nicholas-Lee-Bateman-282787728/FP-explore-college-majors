It is well written, very funny, while maintaining a serious air about it when Hank really needs to be a doctor.  His supporting cast is really what makes the show since it takes them all to pull together this example of great entertainment.  Granted that his brother's character is not portrayed consistently (smart and stupid as needed).  I am not really thrilled with the new doctor they have added this season but I am waiting to see, right now I hate the character and I hate the negative character she adds to the show, not needed in my book.  The expanded role of Boris is a nice touch also, I like it.BOTTOM LINE:  Keep watching this show and go back and get Season 1 if you missed it, if they can keep me watching another doctor show for 2 seasons then you can be assured they are doing something right.",5,Who Would Not Love Hank?,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,925,"['got', 'hooked', 'show', 'last', 'season', 'even', 'find', 'odd', 'really', 'outside', 'normal', 'viewing', 'genres', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'funny', 'maintaining', 'serious', 'air', 'when', 'Hank', 'really', 'be', 'doctor', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'what', 'show', 'pull', 'together', 'example', 'great', 'entertainment', 'Granted', 'brother', 'character', 'not', 'portrayed', 'consistently', 'smart', 'stupid', 'needed', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'thrilled', 'new', 'doctor', 'have', 'added', 'season', 'am', 'waiting', 'see', 'right', 'now', 'hate', 'character', 'hate', 'negative', 'character', 'show', 'not', 'needed', 'book', 'expanded', 'role', 'Boris', 'nice', 'touch', 'also', 'like', 'it.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Keep', 'watching', 'show', 'go', 'back', 'get', 'Season', '1', 'missed', 'can', 'keep', 'watching', 'doctor', 'show', '2', 'seasons', 'then', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'are', 'doing', 'something', 'right']",N/A

But ""Royal Pains Season Two"" manages to keep shaking up the status quo, lest things get stale -- new love interests, new dilemmas, bizarre medical crises and even a business rival. The biggest problem with this season: not enough Libby and Tucker!HankMed gets blindsided by a bunch of new crises: Eddie Lawson comes to live in the Hamptons (and even dates one of Hank's patients), and Hank soon suspects that his dad has an ulterior motive for being there. Jill's free clinic ends up in a medical tug-o-war.  And as Divya's wedding date approaches, she finds herself falling love with a kind-hearted, studly patient.Additionally, after Boris whisks the Lawson brothers to Cuba to oversee his medical treatment, a cutthroat concierge doctor named Emily decides to set up shop in the Hamptons. Evan is not happy about this, but Hank soon ends up dating Emily.And we have the usual array of medical disasters --  lightning strikes, experimental gene treatments, mysterious collapses, Mrs. Newberg's ""heartbroken"" stepdaughter, mystery ailments at a vineyard, the ""lottery curse,"" a food vendor's bizarre behavior, a teen singer with a sore throat, a reality show struck by botulism, an ex-stock-trader fearing an aneurysm, mystery sinus problems, and a bachelor party for Raj that goes spectacularly wrong.The first season of ""Royal Pains"" was pretty much a medical show with a few running subplots. But ""Royal Pains Season Two"" amps up the subplots a little -- there are rivalries, romantic interests, love triangles, and the whole weird situation with Eddie Lawson. There's just a lot more going on in general, especially for Evan and Hank.But don't worry, the medical crises are still the center of the story. Hank uncovers at least one bizarre, rare or hard-to-diagnose medical problem for every episode (""I have a SWORD in my head!""), or he handles mundane ones with his quick wits (saving two boys from a toxic wine vat). The dialogue is still quick, witty and light, but the writers handle weightier issues in an intelligent manner.And there's some solid development for the characters -- Hank spends the season grappling with his difficult relationship with his father, whom he loves but hasn't forgiven. And at the same time, he's dating a very cutthroat rival doctor.... which seems a little out of character, since by his own admission he barely knows her.On the flipside, Evan starts growing up with the introduction of his cute blonde heiress girlfriend, and the relationship between them is adorable (despite her ""demon"" snoring). And Divya continues to struggle with her impending arranged marriage, particularly her fears that her marriage will be a sham instead of a true partnership. The downside of the cast? Not enough Tucker and Libby! They're only in ONE episode!""Royal Pains Season Two"" packs in more plot per episode, but the medical mishaps are still the center of attention. Funny, sweet and suitably dramatic.",4,Sickness in paradise,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,3001,"['still', 'summer', 'Hamptons', 'HankMed', 'busier', 'ever', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'Season', 'Two', 'manages', 'keep', 'shaking', 'up', 'status', 'quo', 'lest', 'things', 'get', 'stale', 'new', 'love', 'interests', 'new', 'dilemmas', 'bizarre', 'medical', 'crises', 'even', 'business', 'rival', 'biggest', 'problem', 'season', 'not', 'enough', 'Libby', 'Tucker', 'HankMed', 'blindsided', 'bunch', 'new', 'crises', 'Eddie', 'Lawson', 'live', 'Hamptons', 'even', 'one', 'Hank', 'patients', 'Hank', 'soon', 'dad', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'being', 'there', 'Jill', 'free', 'clinic', 'up', 'medical', 'tug-o-war', 'Divya', 'wedding', 'date', 'approaches', 'falling', 'love', 'kind-hearted', 'studly', 'patient.Additionally', 'Boris', 'whisks', 'Lawson', 'brothers', 'Cuba', 'oversee', 'medical', 'treatment', 'cutthroat', 'concierge', 'doctor', 'named', 'Emily', 'set', 'up', 'shop', 'Hamptons', 'Evan', 'not', 'happy', 'Hank', 'soon', 'up', 'dating', 'Emily.And', 'have', 'usual', 'array', 'medical', 'disasters', 'lightning', 'strikes', 'experimental', 'gene', 'treatments', 'mysterious', 'collapses', 'Mrs.', 'Newberg', 'heartbroken', 'stepdaughter', 'mystery', 'ailments', 'vineyard', 'lottery', 'curse', 'food', 'vendor', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'teen', 'singer', 'sore', 'throat', 'reality', 'show', 'struck', 'botulism', 'ex-stock-trader', 'fearing', 'aneurysm', 'mystery', 'sinus', 'problems', 'bachelor', 'party', 'Raj', 'spectacularly', 'wrong.The', 'first', 'season', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'medical', 'show', 'few', 'running', 'subplots', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'Season', 'Two', 'up', 'subplots', 'little', 'are', 'rivalries', 'romantic', 'interests', 'love', 'triangles', 'whole', 'weird', 'situation', 'Eddie', 'Lawson', 'just', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'general', 'especially', 'Evan', 'Hank.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'medical', 'crises', 'are', 'still', 'center', 'story', 'Hank', 'uncovers', 'least', 'one', 'bizarre', 'rare', 'hard-to-diagnose', 'medical', 'problem', 'episode', 'have', 'SWORD', 'head', 'mundane', 'ones', 'quick', 'wits', 'saving', 'two', 'boys', 'toxic', 'wine', 'vat', 'dialogue', 'still', 'quick', 'witty', 'light', 'writers', 'handle', 'weightier', 'issues', 'intelligent', 'manner.And', 'solid', 'development', 'characters', 'Hank', 'season', 'grappling', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'father', 'whom', ""n't"", 'forgiven', 'same', 'time', 'dating', 'very', 'cutthroat', 'rival', 'doctor', 'little', 'character', 'own', 'admission', 'barely', 'her.On', 'flipside', 'Evan', 'growing', 'up', 'introduction', 'cute', 'blonde', 'heiress', 'girlfriend', 'relationship', 'adorable', 'demon', 'snoring', 'Divya', 'struggle', 'impending', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'particularly', 'fears', 'marriage', 'will', 'be', 'sham', 'instead', 'true', 'partnership', 'downside', 'cast', 'Not', 'enough', 'Tucker', 'Libby', ""'re"", 'only', 'ONE', 'episode', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'Season', 'Two', 'packs', 'more', 'plot', 'episode', 'medical', 'mishaps', 'are', 'still', 'center', 'attention', 'Funny', 'sweet', 'suitably', 'dramatic']",N/A

1353498,A29SO3ZXU163FV,B003L77H1Y,PC,"[0, 0]","I was hooked on Royal Pains from the beginning.  The lack of major network programming with substance (whatever happened to fine drama series such as Hill Street Blues or ER?) has sent me prowling cable networks and to the discovery of such non-seasonal programs as Royal Pains, Burn Notice, etc., which seem to premiere their seasons in an out-of-sync manner.  No matter.  Whenever these series appear, I turn on my set with purpose and proceed to enjoy well-written, well-acted series.  Royal Pains is one of my favorites. The charming concierge doctor in the Hamptons, his impulsive screw-up brother, the very appealing PA and the rest of the characters bring fresh faces and excellent acting to a series that presents a newer concept than standard major network programming.  The introduction of Henry Winkler as the shady father of Hank and Evan gives greater depth and understanding to the personalities of the two brothers, as well as bringing another excellent actor back to the small screen in a role that suits him very well.  I love the rich scenic photography, the story lines than are more about how the doctor and his team handle problems outside of medicine, and the fact that the writers can tell a complete story plus keep an ongoing sub-text running the length of the season makes this a series worth waiting for on DVD to enjoy again and again. There is comedy, suspense, a little practical medicine, and really fine acting and writing to keep this series fresh and going for many seasons.  if you haven't made the acquaintance of this excellent series, I suggest you buy it on DVD, dig out the munchies and pig out on real entertainment.Royal Pains: Season One",5,"charm, drama, humor - great series",1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,1680,"['was', 'hooked', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'beginning', 'lack', 'major', 'network', 'programming', 'substance', 'happened', 'fine', 'drama', 'series', 'such', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'ER', 'sent', 'prowling', 'cable', 'networks', 'discovery', 'such', 'non-seasonal', 'programs', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'etc.', 'seem', 'premiere', 'seasons', 'out-of-sync', 'manner', 'matter', 'Whenever', 'series', 'appear', 'turn', 'set', 'purpose', 'proceed', 'enjoy', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'series', 'Royal', 'Pains', 'one', 'favorites', 'charming', 'concierge', 'doctor', 'Hamptons', 'impulsive', 'screw-up', 'brother', 'very', 'appealing', 'PA', 'rest', 'characters', 'bring', 'fresh', 'excellent', 'acting', 'series', 'newer', 'concept', 'standard', 'major', 'network', 'programming', 'introduction', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'shady', 'father', 'Hank', 'Evan', 'greater', 'depth', 'understanding', 'personalities', 'two', 'brothers', 'as', 'well', 'bringing', 'excellent', 'actor', 'back', 'small', 'screen', 'role', 'suits', 'very', 'well', 'love', 'rich', 'scenic', 'photography', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'more', 'how', 'doctor', 'team', 'handle', 'problems', 'medicine', 'fact', 'writers', 'can', 'tell', 'complete', 'story', 'keep', 'ongoing', 'sub-text', 'running', 'length', 'season', 'series', 'worth', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'again', 'again', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'little', 'practical', 'medicine', 'really', 'fine', 'acting', 'writing', 'keep', 'series', 'fresh', 'going', 'many', 'seasons', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'acquaintance', 'excellent', 'series', 'suggest', 'buy', 'DVD', 'out', 'munchies', 'pig', 'out', 'real', 'entertainment.Royal', 'Pains', 'Season', 'One']",N/A
