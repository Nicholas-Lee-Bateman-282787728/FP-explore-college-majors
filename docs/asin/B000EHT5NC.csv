Walter ""awalter""","[2, 2]","There's one or two things you need to know to appreciate David Lynch's ""Dumbland,"" laden as it is with mindless expletives, domestic violence, and gratuitous fart scenes. First, Lynch has explored this territory in an admittedly less concentrated form through his films. Largely, this is all about an artist exorcising some demons, and those are demons riding the current of lowbrow, uncultured, anti-rationalism that dominates a large part of the world today. (Look, I don't want to use the term ""white trash"" here--so don't think you can make me do it.) Secondly, this is really the second stab that Lynch has taken at getting to the heart of this issue. The first experiment like this was a comic strip called ""The Angriest Dog in the World,"" and you can get a glimpse of those comics at the City of Absurdity website.",4,if you're not into fart scenes...,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,821,"['one', 'two', 'things', 'need', 'know', 'appreciate', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Dumbland', 'mindless', 'expletives', 'domestic', 'violence', 'gratuitous', 'fart', 'scenes', 'First', 'Lynch', 'explored', 'territory', 'admittedly', 'less', 'concentrated', 'form', 'films', 'Largely', 'artist', 'exorcising', 'demons', 'are', 'demons', 'riding', 'current', 'lowbrow', 'uncultured', 'anti-rationalism', 'large', 'part', 'world', 'today', 'Look', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'use', 'term', 'white', 'trash', 'here', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'make', 'do', 'Secondly', 'really', 'second', 'stab', 'Lynch', 'taken', 'getting', 'heart', 'issue', 'first', 'experiment', 'was', 'comic', 'strip', 'called', 'Angriest', 'Dog', 'World', 'can', 'get', 'glimpse', 'comics', 'City', 'Absurdity', 'website']",Dumbland

Clendenin,"[3, 4]","Writer-director David Lynch has earned a well-deserved reputation for portraying a very dark and even surreal world with films like Blue Velvet (1986) and Mulholland Drive (2001). He moved on to television with the series Twin Peaks. His latest foray finds him experimenting with animated ""film"" on the internet. The first few seconds of Dumbland advises viewers that ""Dumbland is a crude, stupid, violent and absurd series. If it is funny it is funny because we see the absurdity of it all. For mature audiences only."" If anything, that is an understated warning about the vulgarity and violence that follows in the eight three to four minute ""episodes."" The darkness is not new for viewers familiar with Lynch, nor is the creativity or quality that great; a talented high-schooler could have made these shorts. Dumbland is important because it shows the experimental direction of a major film maker. Lynch sat down at his iMac by himself, and with a software program called Flash used his mouse to draw the simple black line drawings on a white background. He then added animation, voices and music.

973882,A1M5405JH9THP9,B000EHT5NC,golgotha.gov,"[2, 3]","DUMBLAND (2002)Directed by David Lynchapprox. 30 minutesThis is a DVD anthology of an internet cartoon that originally appeared on David Lynch's website.  Although the DVD came out in 2005, the cartoons are a few years older.There are eight ""episodes"" of this cartoon that follow the life of a disgusting brute and his dysfunctional lifestyle.  On some level he is similar to Alfred Jarry's ""UBU"" character, but that is probably reading too far into the content here.  Everyone who has ever reviewed this DVD has pointed out that the animation style is as ""crude"" as the characters.The actual story shows the main character lashing out violently at everyone around him, including his screaming wife, a doctor and his physically ill brother-in-law.  In one episode, he mutilates a man who has somehow gotten a stick wedged in his mouth.  There are some Lynch-like moments, in particular a sequence involving an ant infestation.  Our obese anti-hero tries to spray the ants with bug spray, but accidentally gets a whiff of the toxic fumes himself.  After this he hallucinates and sees the ants singing songs and calling him names.  The ""best"" episode is probably ""my teeth are bleeding"" which mostly consists of of looped animation and sound effects.  The usually loud and obnoxious main character just sits in his room as everything in the world seems to go crazy.  I guess you could argue that he is a product of his environment?I am a big fan of Lynch for the reason that he has his own unique style when it comes to making movies.  The problem with this DVD is that there is very little to distinguish it from the hundreds of internet cartoons that already exist.  When I watch something, I don't need to be blown away every time.  I also understand that ""the point"" of this cartoon is to be cheap and vulgar to an absurd degree.  But having said that, if we were to hear a few years down the line that this series was actually made by a fifteen year old boy trying to outdo ""South Park"", I don't think anybody would be surprised.Basically, there are a few funny moments on this DVD, but it is impossible to imagine this being released (or rented) if it was by anyone other than a famous movie director.",3,DUMBLAND EMPIRE,1192147200,"10 12, 2007",2007,2205,"['DUMBLAND', '2002', 'Directed', 'David', 'Lynchapprox', '30', 'minutesThis', 'DVD', 'anthology', 'internet', 'cartoon', 'originally', 'appeared', 'David', 'Lynch', 'website', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', '2005', 'cartoons', 'are', 'few', 'years', 'older.There', 'are', 'eight', 'episodes', 'cartoon', 'follow', 'life', 'disgusting', 'brute', 'dysfunctional', 'lifestyle', 'level', 'similar', 'Alfred', 'Jarry', 'UBU', 'character', 'probably', 'reading', 'too', 'far', 'content', 'here', 'Everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'pointed', 'out', 'animation', 'style', 'crude', 'characters.The', 'actual', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'lashing', 'out', 'violently', 'everyone', 'including', 'screaming', 'wife', 'doctor', 'physically', 'ill', 'brother-in-law', 'one', 'episode', 'man', 'who', 'somehow', 'gotten', 'stick', 'wedged', 'mouth', 'are', 'Lynch-like', 'moments', 'particular', 'sequence', 'involving', 'ant', 'infestation', 'obese', 'anti-hero', 'tries', 'spray', 'ants', 'bug', 'spray', 'accidentally', 'whiff', 'toxic', 'fumes', 'ants', 'singing', 'songs', 'calling', 'names', 'best', 'episode', 'probably', 'teeth', 'are', 'bleeding', 'mostly', 'looped', 'animation', 'sound', 'effects', 'usually', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'sits', 'room', 'everything', 'world', 'go', 'crazy', 'guess', 'could', 'argue', 'product', 'environment', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Lynch', 'reason', 'own', 'unique', 'style', 'when', 'making', 'movies', 'problem', 'DVD', 'very', 'little', 'distinguish', 'hundreds', 'internet', 'cartoons', 'already', 'exist', 'When', 'watch', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'time', 'also', 'understand', 'point', 'cartoon', 'be', 'cheap', 'vulgar', 'absurd', 'degree', 'having', 'said', 'were', 'hear', 'few', 'years', 'line', 'series', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'trying', 'outdo', 'South', 'Park', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'would', 'be', 'surprised.Basically', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'DVD', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'being', 'released', 'rented', 'was', 'anyone', 'other', 'famous', 'movie', 'director']",Dumbland

But I have a question for those people. Are you truly David Lynch fans? Because you need to be to watch this. If you thought The Straight Story was his best film, Blue Velvet was alright, Mulholland Dr. didn't make sense, and Eraserhead was a plotless movie that had no meaning...This is not something for you. Actually, though, people who just have weird senses of humor but have never heard of David Lynch will actually like this. It's a series of 8 episodes (lasting about 30 minutes in all) that are crudely drawn (although, really they look like something from Cartoon Network), distasteful, and really pointless. Is this something that needed to be made? No. Am I glad I watched it? Yes. The episodes are:1. The Neighbor2. The Treadmill3. The Doctor4. A Friend Visits5. Get the Stick6. My Teeth Are Bleeding7. Uncle Bob8. AntsAll the stories include a character that is clearly one of those people who cusses all the time and has no respect for anyone. Pretty disgusting guy, but all these vignettes are...Are short stories about America told through David Lynch's warped vision. Episode 6 features our protagonist watching TV. It appears to be football. In the house, his kid is jumping on a trampoline making noises. His wife is yelling incoherent words nonstop and there is a whole array of car accidents and drive-by's going on outside. At the end of all this (it's only about 2 minutes), a fly buzzes in front of the man's face; He slaps at it and yells ""f**king fly!"" If something like that does not make perfect sense to you and kind of make you laugh...This is definitely not for you.

For various reasons, Dune just didn't work out (yes even the Director's Cut...) and Wild at Heart is pretty weak in my humble opinion.  However nothing has reached as low as this.It seems to me that for a large part Lynch just rushed through it in order to keep it zany and random.  Unfortunately it just came off as poor animation and bad jokes.  I mean, the jokes are funny in that, ""Yeah I guess that's funny..."" sort of way, but really this whole thing is kind of pointless.Being that it's called Dumbland, and that it seems like it's rather supposed to be pointless, I'd like to point out that that still does nothing for it.  Ultimately this is... yeah I said it... boring.  Nothing to it, nothing worthy of interest, nothing to care about or have fun with.Which is really disappointing because David Lynch of all people is inventive enough to do interesting things with animation.  Afterall, his early short films were GREAT fun, and his conceits in surrealism and absurdity makes him readily available to do some really funny things.  It's the funny that might be the problem in this situation.  It's very likely, from what can be seen in these animations, that he just isn't that good at comedy.Oh well.

Actually, repetetivenes seems to be the main theme of the series.  These shorts, which clock in at just 33 minutes altogether, are minimalist (and minimally animated) b&w; studies in doing the same disgusting things over and over.  When, in one episode, a ""character"" called Uncle Bob shows up, he just launches into an escalating series of gross tics, including retching, farting and vomiting.  That makes up most of the episode.  The best short here involves dad discovering the hallucinogenic effects of bug spray, with ants performing a Busby Berkely-like dance routine while insulting their would-be killer.Considering its brief length and throwaway nature, this isn't recommended for everyone.  In fact, it's not recommended for 99% of everyone.  Even if you're a David Lynch fanatic, you're probably better off renting instead of buying (FYI: it's available on at least one very popular DVD rental web site).  Really, it's hard to say who the audience for this is; it's too crude and profane for the art-film crowd, and just too plain weird for Adult Swim crowd.  Judging by his comments, even Lynch himself doesn't like it that much.  Like many of his side projects, it's almost a pure experiment; he just wants to see what he can do with the medium.  Speaking for myself, I kind of enjoyed it, but most people think that I'm just one sick puppy anyway, and they may be right.  If you like this, it doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with you.  It's a damn clear sign, though.",3,Even geniuses have bad days,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,2077,"['series', 'short', 'crudely', 'animated', 'cartoons', 'Eraserhead', 'auteur', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Here', 'how', 'man', 'Dumbland', 'crude', 'stupid', 'violent', 'absurd', 'series', 'funny', 'funny', 'see', 'absurdity', 'need', 'more', 'detail', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Lynchian', 'version', 'typical', 'American', 'family', 'dad', 'foul-mouthed', 'violent', 'flatulent', 'stupid', 'monster', 'Mom', 'whimpering', 'cowering', 'constantly', 'crying', 'mass', 'trembles', 'kid', 'annoying', 'stick', 'figure', 'who', 'just', 'inanely', 'repeats', 'things', 'over', 'Actually', 'repetetivenes', 'be', 'main', 'theme', 'series', 'shorts', 'clock', 'just', '33', 'minutes', 'altogether', 'are', 'minimalist', 'minimally', 'animated', 'b', 'w', 'studies', 'doing', 'same', 'disgusting', 'things', 'over', 'When', 'one', 'episode', 'character', 'called', 'Uncle', 'Bob', 'up', 'just', 'escalating', 'series', 'gross', 'tics', 'including', 'retching', 'farting', 'vomiting', 'up', 'most', 'episode', 'best', 'short', 'here', 'dad', 'discovering', 'hallucinogenic', 'effects', 'bug', 'spray', 'ants', 'performing', 'Busby', 'Berkely-like', 'dance', 'routine', 'insulting', 'would-be', 'killer.Considering', 'brief', 'length', 'throwaway', 'nature', ""n't"", 'recommended', 'everyone', 'fact', 'not', 'recommended', '99', '%', 'everyone', 'Even', ""'re"", 'David', 'Lynch', 'fanatic', ""'re"", 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'renting', 'instead', 'buying', 'FYI', 'available', 'least', 'one', 'very', 'popular', 'DVD', 'rental', 'web', 'site', 'Really', 'hard', 'say', 'who', 'audience', 'too', 'crude', 'profane', 'art-film', 'crowd', 'just', 'too', 'plain', 'weird', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'crowd', 'Judging', 'comments', 'even', 'Lynch', ""n't"", 'like', 'that', 'much', 'many', 'side', 'projects', 'almost', 'pure', 'experiment', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'medium', 'Speaking', 'kind', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'people', 'think', ""'m"", 'just', 'one', 'sick', 'puppy', 'anyway', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'like', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'something', 'wrong', 'damn', 'clear', 'sign', 'though']",Dumbland
973890,A2XFCKVJP7SAS2,B000EHT5NC,Wondertwin,"[0, 0]","I am a longtime David Lynch fan and over the years I have enjoyed being terribly disturbed by all of his movies.(except for films like Elephant Man and The Straight Story which I am not supposed to be disturbed by).  :)Dumbland is a series of short cartoons that originally premiered on davidlynch.com.As far as I can tell, this is Lynch's first foray into animation. It sounds like he's doing all the voices himself. The animation is crude (but I wasn't expecting Disney quality from an animated web series). They are absurdist and for the most part funny (at least to me).Watching these shorts in one sitting, I can see that the film maker is experiencing a learning curve (never having done animation before). Around the halfway mark he really starts to find his groove and the cartoons get funnier (It's too bad he couldn't keep going with the series because the final cartoons are the funniest).I reccomend this for the hard core Lynch fans (like myself) who want to see everything and not to the newcomer.I bought this used from one of the Amazon marketplace re sellers as I thought the new pric was just to high for a short 30 minure dvd of flash animation cartoons.These cartoons are rated R (mostly) for language (I state this for the unintiated who might see that this is animation and think it might be fun for their kids).I can't believe that anyone expects something deep from these cartoons. It's just absurdist cartoon comedy and it works for me.",4,Longtime David Lynch fan,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,1461,"['am', 'longtime', 'David', 'Lynch', 'fan', 'years', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'terribly', 'disturbed', 'movies', 'films', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'Straight', 'Story', 'am', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'disturbed', 'Dumbland', 'series', 'short', 'cartoons', 'originally', 'premiered', 'davidlynch.com.As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'Lynch', 'first', 'foray', 'animation', 'doing', 'voices', 'animation', 'crude', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Disney', 'quality', 'animated', 'web', 'series', 'are', 'absurdist', 'most', 'part', 'funny', 'least', '.Watching', 'shorts', 'one', 'sitting', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'maker', 'experiencing', 'learning', 'curve', 'never', 'having', 'done', 'animation', 'halfway', 'mark', 'really', 'find', 'groove', 'cartoons', 'get', 'funnier', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'going', 'series', 'final', 'cartoons', 'are', 'funniest', '.I', 'reccomend', 'hard', 'core', 'Lynch', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'everything', 'not', 'newcomer.I', 'bought', 'used', 'one', 'Amazon', 'marketplace', 're', 'sellers', 'thought', 'new', 'pric', 'was', 'just', 'high', 'short', '30', 'minure', 'dvd', 'flash', 'animation', 'cartoons.These', 'cartoons', 'are', 'rated', 'R', 'mostly', 'language', 'state', 'unintiated', 'who', 'might', 'see', 'animation', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'fun', 'kids', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'something', 'deep', 'cartoons', 'just', 'absurdist', 'cartoon', 'comedy']",Dumbland
