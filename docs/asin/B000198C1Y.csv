It was several segments of 3 women in jeans with bras or in tight black pants with bras doing simple bellydance moves.  I prefer an instructional or artistic approach to bellydance.  There was no effort put into pleasing surroundings.  All of the sequences are against a stark white background.  This DVD might work for if your reason for bellydance is to go to night clubs and bust a few moves.

It is for exercise and conditioning, and there is no breakdown of the movements.In some ways I liked this video because it moves along quickly....and the camera angles were done pretty well.  You could actually see what the dancers were doing which is great (no weirdo camera angles of some woman's breasts when she is moving her hips and things like that)...but the rest of it was less than stellar.  Like many, many other badly made videos before it, the instructor queues you to do what the dancer who is facing you is doing.  So, when the dancer moves to her right (your left) you have to quickly make a decision to either mirror her, or do what the voice is saying.  And it's a voiceover, not actual instruction, so what was the difficulty to instruct it properly? Also, there are a lot of times when there are no queues at all.  I spent several times being told to bend down and hold a stretch, and I suddenly realize I have been down there a bit too long....and they've stood up. But there is no voice queue.  I don't know about anybody else out there, but I have no eyes in the back of my head to watch them with.  There are other times when they do not queue you, but since you are looking at the screen you can follow along pretty easily.Like another reviewer on here I also could have done without the ""I am the goddess"" nonsense.This video would be ok for someone who has taken lessons....however, I am loath to recommend it to relative newbies, even with lessons because the head tossing and the pelvic drops to the front can cause damage if not performed correctly....and there is no instruction on how to do them correctly.  So, if you are a beginner and you want to do the head rolls/hair tossing sections where they're flinging their hair around....unless you like having a stiff neck, and possibly worse PLEASE find someone who will show you how to do it properly.  If you want to perform the moves where they drop the front of the pelvis down and open up the front of the stomach area, simply drop the front of the pelvis.  Do NOT arch your back and over do this move!  Either one of these moves done incorrectly could cause damage to the neck and spine. At the very least those two moves should have a section where they are broken down for those who haven't been instructed.  I feel that using these moves without any cautions is completely irresponsible on the part of the producers.",3,Not for those who have not had lessons.,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,2449,"['Ok', 'FYI', 'NOT', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'exercise', 'conditioning', 'breakdown', 'movements.In', 'ways', 'liked', 'video', 'along', 'quickly', '.and', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'could', 'actually', 'see', 'what', 'dancers', 'were', 'doing', 'great', 'weirdo', 'camera', 'angles', 'woman', 'breasts', 'when', 'moving', 'hips', 'things', 'rest', 'was', 'less', 'stellar', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'badly', 'made', 'videos', 'instructor', 'do', 'what', 'dancer', 'who', 'facing', 'doing', 'So', 'when', 'dancer', 'right', 'left', 'have', 'quickly', 'make', 'decision', 'mirror', 'do', 'what', 'voice', 'saying', 'voiceover', 'not', 'actual', 'instruction', 'what', 'was', 'difficulty', 'instruct', 'properly', 'Also', 'are', 'lot', 'times', 'when', 'are', 'queues', 'spent', 'several', 'times', 'being', 'told', 'bend', 'down', 'hold', 'stretch', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'have', 'been', 'down', 'there', 'bit', 'too', 'long', '.and', ""'ve"", 'stood', 'up', 'voice', 'queue', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anybody', 'else', 'there', 'have', 'eyes', 'back', 'head', 'watch', 'are', 'other', 'times', 'when', 'do', 'not', 'queue', 'are', 'looking', 'screen', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'pretty', 'reviewer', 'here', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'am', 'goddess', 'nonsense.This', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'ok', 'someone', 'who', 'taken', 'lessons', '.however', 'am', 'loath', 'recommend', 'relative', 'newbies', 'even', 'lessons', 'head', 'tossing', 'pelvic', 'drops', 'front', 'can', 'cause', 'damage', 'not', 'performed', 'correctly', '.and', 'instruction', 'how', 'do', 'correctly', 'So', 'are', 'beginner', 'want', 'do', 'head', 'rolls/hair', 'tossing', 'sections', 'where', ""'re"", 'flinging', 'hair', '.unless', 'having', 'stiff', 'neck', 'possibly', 'worse', 'PLEASE', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'show', 'how', 'do', 'properly', 'want', 'perform', 'moves', 'where', 'drop', 'front', 'pelvis', 'down', 'open', 'up', 'front', 'stomach', 'area', 'simply', 'drop', 'front', 'pelvis', 'Do', 'NOT', 'arch', 'back', 'over', 'do', 'move', 'one', 'moves', 'done', 'incorrectly', 'could', 'cause', 'damage', 'neck', 'spine', 'very', 'least', 'two', 'moves', 'should', 'have', 'section', 'where', 'are', 'broken', 'down', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'instructed', 'feel', 'using', 'moves', 'cautions', 'completely', 'irresponsible', 'part', 'producers']","The Ultimate Bellydance Fitness Workout, Temple of Jehan: Belly dance exercise, Open level belly dance classes"

I've been doing it for about 6 mos and I'm still not bored with it (I need lots of variety...).  I'm probably a beginner/intermediate dancer.  I've taken some classes and worked with Veena and Neena's DVD series.  This workout isn't for the complete beginner.  What I like is that it gives me moves to work towards doing.  It also has plenty of moves that I can do or have finally been able to do. This workout has given me a really strong core and it gives a pretty good cardio workout.  I am always dripping by the time it is over.  It's not a long workout--40 min.  It is perfect for me because I have a toddler and that's about all I can squeeze in.  This is one of the workouts that has truly helped me drop the last of the baby weight. So, if you are looking for a workout that will strenghten your ""core"", help you drop a few pounds, and want to have fun with belly dancing moves--this is for you.  Also, you should probably have a little background in belly dance. I only gave this 4 stars because, well, the music is just soooo cheesy.  Also, ""Ultimate Belly Dance Workout"" is plastered on the side of the screen for the whole thing. At first it's annoying but now I can just ignore it.

I was aware from the outset that this video was geared more toward a workout than toward dance, which is fine if that's what you're looking for. Personally, I found the warm-up and the cool-down to be quite useful. But the workout itself could hurt someone who is not properly prepared for the neck and back movements. Really, this should have included a section on safety, and voice overs should have reminded you to do only what you feel comfortable doing and to be careful in order to prevent any strain.I already knew some of the dancers on the DVD, but I don't feel that their talents were shown off to best effect, especially in jeans. I go more for traditional and folkloric bellydance than a hip-hop look. The set was uncluttered, which was a plus, but on the side of the video all the way through was the name of it. This branding was distracting and totally unnecessary. It should have been included only in the intro. The sound quality is good, but some of the music is pretty silly. If you start listening to the lyrics you might laugh.I was hoping for a performance in the extras section, but instead there was a short ""prayer"" section that was quite goofy, maybe even rather obnoxious. It certainly annoyed me.So, if you're looking for a professionally done video that is polished and teaches technique, this is not it.

Even the makeup doesn't seem to be ""too heavy"" to me for the most part. As for their ""robotic"" or ""jerky"" movements and absence of joy, I think this is true only for the backup dancers (they take turns), but whoever is in the front is almost always energetic and sexy. It is weird that whenever they move to the back they don't perform as well as when they step to the front, but I think it's not difficult to just ignore the backup dancers.Somebody pointed out that the music is accompanied by distracting speech (instead of singing), but I'd like to note that there isn't much of it - only a couple of times, and only for brief moments, and the speech is rather soft.Yes, the production quality is not perfect, but I find it good enough for our purposes.

Unlike a lot of ""beginner"" videos (which there are an abundance of) which have the redundant monotonous cues this one relies more on YOU to keep track of whats going on. (For the individual with a year or two of bellydance experience this shouldn't be a problem, but beginners may not be able to keep up without extra practice.)I like how the workouts are broken up with each workout more challenging than the previous. I also like how a different girl leads each workout - it keeps it interesting. I admit I had to get used to the music, which at times seems to be very pagan and goddess-venerating. I'm not pagan but the music is ok and doesn't distract from the workout. Once I got used to it, it adds to the mystery of the dance.As far as the logo on the side of the screen; I didn't find it an issue. It didn't hinder my view of the dancers. Note: this is not a performance or instructional video, so the set is not elaborate and the costuming may not be ""authentic"" or the women not ""perfect"". But I bought this DVD for a good workout and that what I got. I don't need superfluous backdrops or supermodel perfect women in elaborate costumes and was surprised to see reviews commenting on these things. I thought the girls were attractive and good dancers with individual styles, they demonstrated the steps in a clear straightforward way.I am in reasonably good shape and found myself sweating 20 minutes into this DVD. Its a good workout and best of all its lots of FUN!!

I have been belly dancing for over a year now.For absolute beginners it would be difficult as there is no tutorial.I didn't do the warm-up I just clicked onto the first section, strength and the dvd doesn't keep playing you have to click onto eachsection individually, so then the next time I clicked on the warm-up and scene skipped then it played all the way through.They filmed up close to the instructors - sometimes I missed some moves because they zeroed in on the hips etc so I couldn't seethe feet.It was performed with a workout in mind ie, four steps to the left then clap then back the other way four steps the clap tochange direction - and the moves are done hard rather than flowing - I suppose to try and keep the heart rate up to get fit?It is all belly dance moves, which is good.I was a little bit disappointed with this dvd, I was hoping for a longer workout 40 to 45 minutes with more of a dance feel as it feltmore like a workout - I like to exercise in a way that doesn't feel like I'm exercising - I want to feel like I'm dancing.It's still a good dvd to have once you can already dance.

A lot of the ,""bellydance workout"" DVD's out there seem watered down to me,but not this one.It is constant movement, and except for the clapping ( ?) it is 100% bellydance moves. it also features some really good dancers, Neon, Blanca, Ashye, etc.Some people didn't like the plain white set and simplified costumes. They saw cheesy, I saw simple. Those same people complained that the movements were too hard to keep up with; imagine an elaborite backdrop, and fancy costumes on top of the movement combinations,and then see how hard it is to keep up.I did not care for the ,""music"",but didn't find it too annoying. Overall I understood what Jehan was trying to do, to take the rigid, masculine, de-feminized workout world, and put the feminine back into it. The ""chanting"" was actually a lot of positive affirmations about our beauty and power as women.

796856,A18AJZ4NYUMFG6,B000198C1Y,Parthena Black,"[2, 2]","Wow, it is really hard to give this one a fair rating because the quality really does depend on your dance and fitness level. I actually got my DVD at a secondhand store - a very rare find here in the bible belt, believe me. I purchased this one along withBelly Dance Party: Bellydance combinations you can learn tonight!andBellydance For Body Shaping: Abs - Belly Dance Fitness Workoutfor a price so low I felt like I was stealing them. The abs dvd was still completely wrapped and unopened. When I got them home to take a look, I could understand why someone might have given them away.I was impressed with the warmup, which is graceful and relaxing but I immediately noticed that there is no breakdown of some of the moves, such as the large hip circle. I let that pass because it was just the warmup. I did the workout several times before writing this review to make sure that I was right about there being no breakdown of any of the moves, steps and combinations. There really isn't, and the DVD moves very fast. If I were at beginner level, I would have been very frustrated and probably would have given up on it too.On the other hand - for those who are in great physical shape and pick up easily on dance and aerobic moves and for intermediate and advanced bellydancers, this is probably the best cardio workout I've seen. True to its title, the workout really is a bellydance workout and some fun folkloric moves are included as well. After the warm-up, you have a choice of four different styles of dance: Strength, Sensuality, Joy and Passion. The variety offered keeps this DVD from becoming a bore. Jehan's music is the perfect tempo and not so loud that it is distracting. The bonus features include the beautiful prayer dance (or Goddess Prayer, I can't remember what it's called on this one) and it would have been nice to include it in the instruction. The bonus feature showing the cast is simply a series of film shots that doesn't connect the dancers' names to their faces and I still don't know who is who other than Neon and Blanca.I can't honestly say that the title is misleading, but the description stating that ""Dancers of all levels as well as non-dancers will benefit..."" is. It goes on to say that ""If you don't have any dance training, you will need sharp observation skills and focus to meet the challenge."" This DVD moves so fast that it's going to take a lot more than that for most people.  I also don't see the point of calling a workout ""bellydance"" if the instructor is not going to teach at least a few authentic bellydance moves.Another issue that is hard to rate is the way that the dancers are dressed. For most of the cardio segments, they are wearing cute little tight jeans. I always appreciate an instructor who does wear pants because it is so much easier to observe what her legs and feet are doing, so I'm not really sure why the jeans bother me a bit. Perhaps it's because many of the women we talk to about bellydance immediately react negatively by saying that they are too fat. None of these dancers are too thin or anorexic and in fact, all are at very healthy weights - but there is something about the jeans that sends the message that bellydance is sexy and flirty. For some, this may be a very positive image and something to strive for but to the perception of those whom we are trying to educate about the dance, it does nothing to educate the misinformed about the art form and in fact, perpetuates negative stereotypes.So, this one has been quite a dilemma to rate and I think I'm going to have to settle on the three star ""average."" I've tried a number of bellydance instructional videos before and after taking classes over the past three years. There are only two that I would recommend to beginners with no dance experience.Bellydance! Magical Motionby Atea and Friends breaks down all of the basic moves and shows you how to improvise a dance based on each one.

It really is meant for those who already know the different between a hip lift and hip drop, a hip twist and a hip pivot.The positives:  The length is quite decent for the price.  I like the segments it was broken up into.  The dance steps are done in a logical sequence that allows for good transitions.  Instructors can get ideas for teaching moves in a combination with a cardio effect.  It is a workout.The negatives:  My BIGGEST complaint is the cueing, or lack thereof.  If you look away from the screen, you are lost.  There is no advance cuing--it took me watching it several times before I could follow along without hanging on the TV set to see what each forthcoming move was.The details/aesthetics: The costumes are very modern--if you are looking for the bra/belt/skirt combination, or if you are offended by dancing in jeans, this is not for you.  It also uses untraditional Middle Eastern Music, and instead, the music of the talented Jehan.  This is fine--except many purists want something with a recognizable bellydance rhythm. The music is very produced and New Age, no tabla involved.  You must understand the moves before trying this video--they're glossed over and deep understanding of the move, or a muscle understanding of the move, isn't addressed.I'd recommend this tape to those who have had a session of classes and want to stay in shape for the next session, or as a warm up for a workshop--I would not recommend this to a beginner, or someone with a minimal understanding of the moves.HOWEVER, having said that, I do strongly recommends Neon's crash course and her DVD's.

796858,A3QFE1H3RUP6Z7,B000198C1Y,"Shantell Powell ""The ShanMonster""","[19, 21]","The Ultimate Bellydance Fitness Workout DVD is titled hyperbolically.  Although I agree it is not a bad workout, there are better dance workout videos on the market.  Better videos have even been produced by the same company.The video has several problems.  First of all, it's described as being appropriate for all levels of fitness/dance.  This is not true.  Few of the movements are explained, and some of the movements (like the head spins) are downright dangerous if done incorrectly.  Since no explanation is given, I wouldn't be surprised if people haven't already wrenched their necks badly.  I would never recommend this video for a beginner, but only for someone who already has a strong foundation in Middle Eastern dance.Secondly, dance jargon is used in the video without benefit of definitions.  Ballet terminology is used without explanation, and is meaningless to those without classical dance backgrounds.The voice-overs are often off-putting.  There are times when Jehan counts time with the music, and her rhythm is off.  Or she'll describe a move at a different rate to what is being done on screen (eg.  she'll be saying hip hip step while the dancer is doing some other combination).  This is very confusing.  It might be easier to do the video without the sound.Next, the focus is very New Agey.  This may appeal to fans of Dolphina, but for more secular dancers and fitness aficionados, it is a turn off.Most annoying of all are instances when a movement is described, but not shown.  A prime example would be a bouncy folkloric step in which the foot and legwork are not shown.  The feet and legs are integral to the movement, but are shown only fleetingly, and partway through the video segment.  This is bad camerawork and direction.The video extras are not of the best quality.  One of the biggest problems is the onscreen text.  It is very blurry, and sometimes impossible to read.  I was going by guesswork on a few things.The DVD also includes a dance prayer which is more silly than inspiring.Generally, the costuming choices are good.  However, at the very beginning, Jehan is wearing a lovely, flowing skirt which obscures what her legs are doing.  Also, several dancers are wearing denim, which I don't think is the most comfortable choice, but at least it doesn't obstruct the view.  That's just a matter of taste, I guess.  The dancers are all very easy to see against the white background.  It's nice to see an uncluttered and distracting set.  However, the name of the video is branded down the left side throughout the workout, and that's pretty annoying.On the plus side, anyone who does this video all the way through will be getting a good cardio workout.  The warmup and cooldown are solid (aside from the head flinging), and if you keep practicing with the video, your hipwork should improve.  The dancers are competent and have good camera presence.  Also, the music is interesting and works well with the workout sections.  The video has its flaws, but being boring is not one of them.",3,Not appropriate for beginners,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,3032,"['Ultimate', 'Bellydance', 'Fitness', 'Workout', 'DVD', 'titled', 'hyperbolically', 'agree', 'not', 'bad', 'workout', 'are', 'better', 'dance', 'workout', 'videos', 'market', 'Better', 'videos', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'produced', 'same', 'company.The', 'video', 'several', 'problems', 'First', 'all', 'described', 'being', 'appropriate', 'levels', 'fitness/dance', 'not', 'true', 'Few', 'movements', 'are', 'explained', 'movements', 'head', 'spins', 'are', 'downright', 'dangerous', 'done', 'incorrectly', 'explanation', 'given', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'wrenched', 'necks', 'badly', 'would', 'never', 'recommend', 'video', 'beginner', 'only', 'someone', 'who', 'already', 'strong', 'foundation', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'dance.Secondly', 'dance', 'jargon', 'used', 'video', 'benefit', 'definitions', 'Ballet', 'terminology', 'used', 'explanation', 'meaningless', 'classical', 'dance', 'voice-overs', 'are', 'often', 'off-putting', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Jehan', 'time', 'music', 'rhythm', 'off', ""'ll"", 'describe', 'move', 'different', 'rate', 'what', 'being', 'done', 'screen', 'eg', ""'ll"", 'be', 'saying', 'hip', 'hip', 'step', 'dancer', 'doing', 'other', 'combination', 'very', 'confusing', 'might', 'be', 'easier', 'do', 'video', 'sound.Next', 'focus', 'very', 'New', 'Agey', 'may', 'appeal', 'fans', 'Dolphina', 'more', 'secular', 'dancers', 'fitness', 'aficionados', 'turn', 'off.Most', 'annoying', 'are', 'instances', 'when', 'movement', 'described', 'not', 'shown', 'prime', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'bouncy', 'folkloric', 'step', 'foot', 'legwork', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'feet', 'legs', 'are', 'integral', 'movement', 'are', 'shown', 'only', 'fleetingly', 'partway', 'video', 'segment', 'bad', 'camerawork', 'direction.The', 'video', 'extras', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'quality', 'One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'onscreen', 'text', 'very', 'blurry', 'sometimes', 'impossible', 'read', 'was', 'going', 'guesswork', 'few', 'things.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'dance', 'prayer', 'more', 'silly', 'inspiring.Generally', 'costuming', 'choices', 'are', 'good', 'However', 'very', 'beginning', 'Jehan', 'wearing', 'lovely', 'flowing', 'skirt', 'what', 'legs', 'are', 'doing', 'Also', 'several', 'dancers', 'are', 'wearing', 'denim', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'comfortable', 'choice', 'least', ""n't"", 'obstruct', 'view', 'just', 'matter', 'taste', 'guess', 'dancers', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'see', 'white', 'background', 'nice', 'see', 'uncluttered', 'distracting', 'set', 'However', 'name', 'video', 'branded', 'down', 'left', 'side', 'workout', 'pretty', 'plus', 'side', 'anyone', 'who', 'video', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout', 'warmup', 'cooldown', 'are', 'solid', 'head', 'flinging', 'keep', 'practicing', 'video', 'hipwork', 'should', 'improve', 'dancers', 'are', 'competent', 'have', 'good', 'camera', 'presence', 'Also', 'music', 'interesting', 'well', 'workout', 'sections', 'video', 'flaws', 'being', 'boring', 'not', 'one']","The Ultimate Bellydance Fitness Workout, Temple of Jehan: Belly dance exercise, Open level belly dance classes"

It is constant movement and at a challenging pace.  What I love about this dvd is how each stretch and movement all have physical purpose but flow from one to the next in a continual dance- which is what a lot of bellydance workout dvds lack (we want to workout but we also want to dance- it is bellyDANCE afterall, right?) When there are constant breakdowns and pauses between steps, the intermediate dancer can get bored and fail to work up to cardiovascular benefit.  This dvd will get you sweating but it is so much fun, you won't even notice till you are done.The warm up and cool down on this dvd are especially good, in my opinion.The only drawback would be the filming is a little low budget and the music is not for everyone.  It is not your classic middle eastern tunes, it is music by Jehan.  The beats are really great but the talking in the music is something I could, personally, do without- the statements are affirming but some of the things she says were... well, like: ""I (pause pause) am fire (pause pause) burning (pause pause) burning (pause pause) in your heart"" If she could have sang these lyrics instead of just say them, it might not sound so odd.

I still lack the ability to grasp new dance techniques easily. I have most of Neena & Veena, the bellydance twins's DVDs, two of the Goddess Workout ones, and only one Rania since she is way too stiff. With that help, I had no trouble with this DVD at all. This DVD is meant for keeping your heart-rate up & keeping the music always present. The music is very beautiful with a nice beat, but light & spiritual as well with subtle female singing.Every move is done in 1/2 time several times before moving on to normal speed w/naration over the music. Since most instructional DVDs are slow, most times w/o music & barely repeat more then a few times, this is a refreshing change for when you just want to practice & get your heart rate up w/o stopping. There were a few moves I had not previously been able to master, but have through this DVD such as pelvic lifts & pelvic rolls. There are some more advanced ones I have trouble on, but I just do the best I can & keeps me inspired to keep trying.There are separate chapters by mood such as: joy, sensual that work on different body parts. The Ultimate on left side was distracting at first, but easy to get used to. They are always dressed in jeans or gothic wear, but you can still easily see how to move the body. Many of the dancers on this DVD went on to make their own or are well known & have performance DVDs.The warm-up & cooldown are 16 min of very slow bellydancing moves & stretching. The warm-up & cooldown in only a FEW spots of the whole DVD lack naration for the forward bends, but that's it. The regular workout is 28 min but feels like longer since it never slows down to a crawl/break.I wouldn't recommend this as a first bellydance DVD at all, but maybe a 3rd or 4th, try using the bellydance twins Neena & Veena (there are trailer's for their dvds at collagevideo.comBTW, I don't mention the set or how people look, because I only care about the talent of the instructor, how well they teach & the content. Most directors & producers screw things up by putting up cheesy sets & almost all have camera zooms & angles that take away your ability to see/learn.

Kite's ""boardgirl148"" reviewer who has the audacity to complain about the dancers' facial beauty.
