But ... sadly, this is definitely a Hollywood version of a teenager, amusement park flick. It's got the not-so-attractive guy -- who would never realistically have a chance with two girls -- getting two girls who look like Kristen Stewart and Margarita Levieva. I don't care how cool this guy is supposed to be, no girls like these two would bat an eye at him. However, that usually doesn't faze me as that seems to be the theme to Judd Apatow-produced comedies nowadays. Director Greg Mottola, who also wrote this, showed real flair when directingSuperbad - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition), but for all its great comedic cast and plot, ""Adventureland"" isn't anything spectacular.I will say that the stand-outs in this film are Martin Starr (Freaks and Geeks - The Complete Series,Knocked Up - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), ""Superbad""), who is brilliant in just about everything he does; Bill Hader, who can not only pull off his own brand of geeky-type humor but also great hard@$$ scenes (see the baseball bat scene and how effortlessly he transitions); the background characters who bring spice to an otherwise mediocre script, such as Tommy Frigo (Matt Bush), Munch (Barret Hackney), and Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva), because these type of characters are - much like in real life - the ones you remember and laugh about; and the spectacular soundtrack!!! If you are a fan of 1980s alternative such as The Replacements, The Velvet Underground, The New York Dolls, Husker Du, The Cure, Lou Reed and Nick Lowe, and 1980s pop such as INXS, David Bowie, Crowded House, Whitesnake, Judas Priest, and, yes, Falco (""DO THEY HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING THIS SONG!?""), then you'll be racing to find the soundtrack, which sadly is only available as a MP3 download.Ryan Reynolds and SNL's Kristen Wiig are poorly underused in the film, although Wiig is still hilarious; I have a feeling her hit is gonna be in the Drew Barrymore-directed roller derby dramedy ""Whip It."" This film had a lot of promise but I don't fall for Kristen Stewart's method of acting which is basically always looking uncomfortable. I like Jesse Eisenberg a lot and he did a good job, but I still felt like this wasn't the right film for him. He did much better inThe Education of Charlie Banks. ""Adventureland"" is definitely worth seeing but it definitely is to be taken with a grain of salt. With its carnie-type game tricks and story that tries too hard to sell an unbelievable summer romance, I expected a little more but was overall entertained.",3,"There's not as much fun as expected in ""Adventureland""",1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,2595,"['someone', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'amusement', 'park', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'sadly', 'definitely', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'teenager', 'amusement', 'park', 'flick', 'got', 'not-so-attractive', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'realistically', 'have', 'chance', 'two', 'girls', 'getting', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'look', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'cool', 'guy', 'supposed', 'be', 'girls', 'two', 'would', 'bat', 'eye', 'However', 'usually', ""n't"", 'faze', 'be', 'theme', 'Judd', 'Apatow-produced', 'comedies', 'nowadays', 'Director', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'showed', 'real', 'flair', 'when', 'directingSuperbad', 'Unrated', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'great', 'comedic', 'cast', 'plot', 'Adventureland', ""n't"", 'anything', 'spectacular.I', 'will', 'say', 'stand-outs', 'film', 'are', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Unrated', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Superbad', 'who', 'brilliant', 'just', 'everything', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'pull', 'off', 'own', 'brand', 'geeky-type', 'humor', 'also', 'great', 'hard', '@', 'scenes', 'see', 'baseball', 'bat', 'scene', 'how', 'effortlessly', 'background', 'characters', 'who', 'bring', 'spice', 'otherwise', 'mediocre', 'script', 'such', 'Tommy', 'Frigo', 'Matt', 'Bush', 'Munch', 'Barret', 'Hackney', 'Lisa', 'P.', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'type', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'ones', 'remember', 'laugh', 'spectacular', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'fan', '1980s', 'alternative', 'such', 'Replacements', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'Husker', 'Du', 'Cure', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'Nick', 'Lowe', '1980s', 'pop', 'such', 'INXS', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Crowded', 'House', 'Whitesnake', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'yes', 'Falco', 'DO', 'THEY', 'HAVE', 'TO', 'KEEP', 'PLAYING', 'THIS', 'SONG', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'racing', 'find', 'soundtrack', 'sadly', 'only', 'available', 'MP3', 'download.Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'SNL', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'are', 'poorly', 'underused', 'film', 'Wiig', 'still', 'hilarious', 'have', 'feeling', 'hit', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'Drew', 'Barrymore-directed', 'roller', 'derby', 'dramedy', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'promise', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'method', 'acting', 'basically', 'always', 'looking', 'uncomfortable', 'like', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'lot', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'still', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'film', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'inThe', 'Education', 'Charlie', 'Banks', 'Adventureland', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'definitely', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'carnie-type', 'game', 'tricks', 'story', 'too', 'hard', 'sell', 'unbelievable', 'summer', 'romance', 'expected', 'little', 'more', 'was', 'overall', 'entertained']",N/A

Many viewers may at first be surprised by this film and find it slow and lacking in the expected hilarity.  When the promotion work was done on this film it was a marketing travesty.  This film is directed by Greg Mottola of SUPERBAD fame, a film which redefined the comedy genre.  When one thinks of SUPERBAD it is associated with KNOCKED UP, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS and ROLE MODELS.  These films were tender tales told with over the top, in your face hilarity.  I adore these films and own them all.  They are classics.  But ADVENTURELAND was promoted as if it was in this genre and it totally is not.  The tender story of James is the center and there is heartfelt drama and emotion wrapped around this unique blend of honest characters and low scored humor.  The humor is underplayed and always there but not in an over the top way.James has his life all planned out, just graduated from high school and finds out that his college fund no longer exists so he must get a summer job.  The only work available is at the tacky amusement park ADVENTURELAND.  The cast is amazing and the story is told intimately in the vein of a small indie film.  James falls for Em, the ever talented Kristen Stuart.  Ryan Reynolds effectivelty underplays his role of the park gigolo.  Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE are hilarious as the owners of the park but for me most of the laughts come from the very underrated Wendie Malick who plays James mother.This film is a gentle coming of age story with very real characters.  It is not an over the top laughfest but instead a tender drama filled with charmed laughs.  If you find this movie to not be what you expected don't give up on it and give it a second viewing.  I guarantee it will grow on you.  It grew on me so much I had to purchase it.This film takes place in the mid 80s and is true to the time preriod.  There is a classic soundtrack and everything else from scenery to props are right on point.  The blu ray version has a very impressive 1080p high def transfer that show colors with immense clarity and treats darks with class.  Audio is also superb.  This film has a story to tell and with each viewing you will grow fonder and fonder of the characters and its humor and grace will become a huge part of the films charm.

1259517,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002BFBAUG,B. E Jackson,"[1, 3]","Adventureland is definitely overrated.  It's a film intended *entirely* for young adults.  It has a few serious problems though.For one thing, it completely lacks humor.  That wouldn't be so much of a problem if the storyline ever picked up and actually went somewhere interesting instead of being one of literally thousands of typical college teen movies released over the last 10 years involving the *same exact topics*.Relationships obviously is the most popular topic covered here- partying, fitting in with crowds, and just having fun comes next.  It's become so predictable and completely unnecessary by this point that it adds up to a LOT Of useless storyline segments.  Instead of movie writers coming up with new material, they keep falling back into the same old routine of predictability, and that's a shame.In this particular case, the entire storyline revolves around a young college man who takes a part time job at an amusement park, and while there he falls in love with two women.  He's actually more interested in one, while the other girl feels more like a mistake to him.I don't find anything remotely funny about Adventureland either, especially some of the recurring bits (such as one kid kicking the other one in the crotch repeatedly- this isn't really funny to me).  Another segment shows the amusement park games being fixed, and paying customers finding out about it.  This felt like a really horrible missed opportunity for humor and storyline progression.  Awful writing here.The writing has just become extremely bland by this point.  As a result this is a really bad storyline that doesn't even make an attempt to separate itself in a positive way from the rest of the college films out there.  What a shame.  A film you'll know exactly which direction it's going after the first 20 minutes.I enjoyed all the Lou Reed material being heard throughout the film, and it's actually an amazing coincidence because I just got done listening to several Lou Reed albums myself, so the soundtrack was a welcome surprise.  Still, that's not enough to save some dreadful storytelling, so I recommend skipping Adventureland.

Unfortunately his funding fell through. So now it's time for them to go to work. His extensive background in the classics has qualified him for a job is a games person at a local amusement park called Adventure land. Among his new found friends and coworkers he learns what is really of value in life.If I was to some this film up in one word it would be blas&eacute;. The story is formula and predictable. And the pacing is excruciatingly slow. Sometimes formula and predictable can be fun to watch. I often watch films just for their fun and predictability. However this is not one of them. There is no significant insight or social redeeming value.I have only seen the Blu-Ray version so I cannot compare to others. The DVD starts out with the obligatory coming attractions and ""is not Blu-Ray great"" statement. Then there is an anti-smoking commercial. If you can remember what film you put in the player are lucky. There are the standard bonus features, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and whatnot.

1259519,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B002BFBAUG,B. Martin,"[2, 3]","There is an unmistakable ramshackle and unfocused feel to this coming of age comedy about the pains and pleasures of working a thankless summer job, and it suits the movie quite nicely.  The plot, in a nutshell, follows a summer in the life of James, a teen who finds himself forced to take a job in a rundown amusement park in Pittsburgh after his parents suffer a financial setback that won't allow them to pay his way through college.  James is played by Jesse Eisenberg as a neurotic, insecure, niave and ultimately likeable kid not unsimilar to the many characters played by Michael Cera.  In fact, somebody should put the two of them in a movie together as brothers or cousins or something.  But I digress.Adventureland follows James as he gets a reality check about working a crappy job to pay for college, forms friendships with the other oddball park employees and falls in love with Em, played by Kristen Stewart.  The movie is at its best when it sticks to the details of what it's like to work at an amusement park; the rigged games, angry patrons, rides that bread down and the general camaraderie that the employees develop as they just hang out with one another.  During these vignettes, Adventureland is an engagingly askew comedy.  It doesn't really have any focused center.  It's just about being young, hanging out and hoping that the future works out.The movie is less successful when it focuses on the romance between James and Em.  Eissenberg and Stewart are a likeable couple, but they never really feel all that convincing.  I for one never beleived that their feelings for one aonther went that deep so the subplots about Em's affair with Ryan Reynolds' character or James' date with coworker Melissa P. never really added much to the mix.  If anything, they were a distraction from the film's comedic center and they took time away from hilarious supporting players such as Martin Starr and Bill Hader.Nevertheless, with it's scruffy appeal, smart and funny dalogue and cool soundtrack (The Replacements and Lou Reed figure prominently in the mix), Adventureland is ultimately an enjoyable movie that leaves you feeling that it could have been something more.",3,Offbeat but endearing comedy,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2185,"['unmistakable', 'ramshackle', 'unfocused', 'feel', 'coming', 'age', 'comedy', 'pains', 'pleasures', 'working', 'thankless', 'summer', 'job', 'suits', 'movie', 'quite', 'nicely', 'plot', 'nutshell', 'summer', 'life', 'James', 'teen', 'who', 'forced', 'take', 'job', 'rundown', 'amusement', 'park', 'Pittsburgh', 'parents', 'suffer', 'financial', 'setback', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'pay', 'way', 'college', 'James', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'neurotic', 'insecure', 'niave', 'ultimately', 'likeable', 'kid', 'not', 'unsimilar', 'many', 'characters', 'played', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'fact', 'somebody', 'should', 'put', 'two', 'movie', 'together', 'brothers', 'cousins', 'something', 'digress.Adventureland', 'James', 'reality', 'check', 'working', 'crappy', 'job', 'pay', 'college', 'forms', 'friendships', 'other', 'oddball', 'park', 'employees', 'love', 'Em', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'details', 'what', 'work', 'amusement', 'park', 'rigged', 'games', 'angry', 'patrons', 'rides', 'bread', 'down', 'general', 'camaraderie', 'employees', 'develop', 'just', 'hang', 'out', 'one', 'vignettes', 'Adventureland', 'engagingly', 'askew', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'focused', 'center', 'just', 'being', 'young', 'hanging', 'out', 'hoping', 'future', 'out.The', 'movie', 'less', 'successful', 'when', 'romance', 'James', 'Em', 'Eissenberg', 'Stewart', 'are', 'likeable', 'couple', 'never', 'really', 'feel', 'convincing', 'one', 'never', 'beleived', 'feelings', 'one', 'aonther', 'went', 'deep', 'subplots', 'Em', 'affair', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'James', 'date', 'coworker', 'Melissa', 'P.', 'never', 'really', 'added', 'much', 'mix', 'anything', 'were', 'distraction', 'film', 'comedic', 'center', 'took', 'time', 'away', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'players', 'such', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'Bill', 'Hader.Nevertheless', 'scruffy', 'appeal', 'smart', 'funny', 'dalogue', 'cool', 'soundtrack', 'Replacements', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'figure', 'prominently', 'mix', 'Adventureland', 'ultimately', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'feeling', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'more']",N/A
1259520,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B002BFBAUG,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 4]","ADVENTURELAND will be enjoyed by those who go in with either no knowledge of the story, or those that thought it might be a comedy but quickly come to understand that it's much more than that.More of a quirky summer romance than a laugh-out-loud comedy, Adventureland gets some surprisingly high marks for taking a tried and true genre and marketing it to young adults --  as well as those of us with a touch of gray --  who remember working the odd job in order to make money for school, and finding much more than just an income.Director Greg Mottola springs into action again after his wildly successful teen comedySuperbad. Mottola proved his comedic talent in that flick, but here in Adventureland pulls back and gives us more of a bittersweet love story with a comedic shell.For those of you who saw (and loved)Zombieland, you'll definitely want to see Jesse Eisenberg in this film. Although he's not running for his life from brain-starved zombies, he is running toward a life as a man, trying to figure out where he's going and how he wants his life to pan out.Kristen Stewart (Into the Wild) plays the love interest. She's the perfect confused and embittered daughter of a recently remarried father and ""evil"" stepmother. Finding solace in the sexual declivities of a married maintenance man, Arlene (Stewart) sees a kind spirit in James (Eisenberg), and the two form a budding romance that rocks, shatters, and builds as they discover what each has to offer the other.The entire film circles around James' need to earn some cash for college after his parents' finances fall apart. He finds the only job offered to him at an amusement park named, yep, Adventureland. It is run by Bobby (comedic superstar Bill Hader,Tropic Thunder) and his wife Paulette (Kristen Wiig,Knocked Up). This park and it's workers are what makes for an interesting and occasionally funny mix. Bobby guides Adventureland with a quirky yet firm hand. The crew that helps run the park are as diverse as America itself, and often just as screwed up. One of them has been a long-time friend of James' and loves punching him in the groin. Another (known only as Lisa P) is the sexually desirable yet unknown virginal girl that all the guys lust after. And still another is an obviously mentally challenged security guard who is the knowledge-base about everyone and everything that goes on within (and around) the park.As you can see, there's a lot going on, and not all of it is funny. In fact, if you go into the film thinking it's going to be SUPERBAD 2, prepare to be disappointed. Unfortunately, many of the previews gave that impression. Although there's comedy lightly (very lightly) sprinkled throughout, it's not what makes this movie go. It is post-teen angst and a surprisingly great love story that allows many of us a walk down memory lane.",4,"Not So Much A Comedy ...But Much, Much More",1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,2833,"['ADVENTURELAND', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'who', 'go', 'knowledge', 'story', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'comedy', 'quickly', 'come', 'understand', 'much', 'more', 'that.More', 'quirky', 'summer', 'romance', 'laugh-out-loud', 'comedy', 'Adventureland', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'marks', 'taking', 'tried', 'true', 'genre', 'marketing', 'young', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'touch', 'gray', 'who', 'remember', 'working', 'odd', 'job', 'order', 'make', 'money', 'school', 'finding', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'income.Director', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'springs', 'action', 'again', 'wildly', 'successful', 'teen', 'comedySuperbad', 'Mottola', 'proved', 'comedic', 'talent', 'flick', 'here', 'Adventureland', 'pulls', 'back', 'more', 'bittersweet', 'story', 'comedic', 'shell.For', 'who', 'saw', 'loved', 'Zombieland', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'see', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'film', 'not', 'running', 'life', 'brain-starved', 'zombies', 'running', 'life', 'man', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'going', 'how', 'life', 'pan', 'out.Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Into', 'Wild', 'love', 'interest', 'perfect', 'confused', 'embittered', 'daughter', 'recently', 'remarried', 'father', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'Finding', 'solace', 'sexual', 'declivities', 'married', 'maintenance', 'man', 'Arlene', 'Stewart', 'kind', 'spirit', 'James', 'Eisenberg', 'two', 'form', 'budding', 'romance', 'shatters', 'builds', 'discover', 'what', 'offer', 'other.The', 'entire', 'film', 'circles', 'James', 'need', 'earn', 'cash', 'college', 'parents', 'finances', 'fall', 'apart', 'only', 'job', 'offered', 'amusement', 'park', 'named', 'Adventureland', 'run', 'Bobby', 'comedic', 'superstar', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'wife', 'Paulette', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'park', 'workers', 'are', 'what', 'interesting', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'mix', 'Bobby', 'guides', 'Adventureland', 'quirky', 'yet', 'firm', 'hand', 'crew', 'run', 'park', 'are', 'as', 'diverse', 'America', 'often', 'just', 'screwed', 'up', 'One', 'been', 'long-time', 'friend', 'James', 'loves', 'punching', 'groin', 'known', 'only', 'Lisa', 'P', 'sexually', 'desirable', 'yet', 'unknown', 'virginal', 'girl', 'guys', 'lust', 'still', 'obviously', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'security', 'guard', 'who', 'knowledge-base', 'everyone', 'everything', 'around', 'park.As', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'going', 'not', 'funny', 'fact', 'go', 'film', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'SUPERBAD', '2', 'prepare', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'previews', 'gave', 'impression', 'comedy', 'lightly', 'very', 'lightly', 'sprinkled', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'go', 'post-teen', 'angst', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'many', 'walk', 'down', 'memory', 'lane']",N/A

Trying to give this a calm and professional review? Let me just come out and say it: I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!! I can't think of a teen film this decade that can compare with this one. I saw it a second time 2 days after opening night, because I knew it deserved a second viewing, and I'm excited for my third, because I cannot stop thinking about this movie. It made me happy at the right times, sad at the right times, and as for Greg Mottola, this is a great improvement over Superbad(which I actually find to be very overrated). I thought that was okay, but this is a much more personal, and real project for him.This is one of the best teen movies I've ever seen and without a doubt my favorite film of 2009 so far (yes it beats out Watchmen, much to my own surprise). I went in expecting to have the kind of good time that most Apatow-esque comedies give me(like the recent ""I Love You, Man""), but I got much more than that.(oh, and if you're into the kind of 80's music I am, you will love the references to Lou Reed, David Bowie, The Replacements, and Husker Du)...I still don't think I did this film justice, nor do I think I ever will.",5,A Revelation of the Teen Film Genre,1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,1983,"[""'re"", 'expecting', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'comedy', 'raunchy', 'teen', 'sex', 'romp', 'little-to-no', 'sentimentality', 'meaning', 'rethink', 'viewpoint', 'film', 'marketing', 'campaign.What', 'Adventureland', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'less', 'maybe', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'today', 'other', 'teen', 'film', 'had', 'impact', 'classic', 'Jon', 'Hughes', 'film', 'saw', 'Adventureland.You', 'will', 'definitely', 'laugh', 'yes', 'have', 'brains', 'do', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'affection', 'empathy', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'leads', 'nearly', 'player', 'here', 'important', 'feel', 'touching', 'coming-of-age', 'romance', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', 'who', 'millions', 'miles', 'better', 'here', 'Twilight', 'giving', 'much', 'more', 'superb', 'performance', 'playing', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'bella', 'swan', 'ever', 'was', '.What', 'am', 'doing', 'Trying', 'give', 'calm', 'professional', 'review', 'Let', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'LOVED', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'teen', 'film', 'decade', 'can', 'compare', 'one', 'saw', 'second', 'time', '2', 'days', 'opening', 'night', 'knew', 'deserved', 'second', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'excited', 'third', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'thinking', 'movie', 'made', 'happy', 'right', 'times', 'sad', 'right', 'times', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'great', 'improvement', 'Superbad', 'actually', 'find', 'be', 'very', 'overrated', 'thought', 'was', 'okay', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'real', 'project', 'him.This', 'one', 'best', 'teen', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'doubt', 'favorite', 'film', '2009', 'far', 'yes', 'out', 'Watchmen', 'much', 'own', 'surprise', 'went', 'expecting', 'have', 'kind', 'good', 'time', 'most', 'Apatow-esque', 'comedies', 'give', 'recent', 'Love', 'Man', 'got', 'much', 'more', 'oh', ""'re"", 'kind', '80', 'music', 'am', 'will', 'love', 'references', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Replacements', 'Husker', 'Du', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'did', 'film', 'justice', 'do', 'think', 'ever', 'will']",N/A

Oliver,"[1, 2]","When I went to see this movie, I thought I was going to end up seeing something like Superbad, and though I loved Superbad as a movie about High School, this was ten times better in every aspect.  Maybe its my personality, maybe its because I had been dating a girl that looked like Em (from how she carried herself, responsed to things, and the such), maybe because I was finishing up with college after having started in a Community college because my dad lost his job, and my college fund had to help the family, and then I transfered to a four year state college.  Maybe it was because I had gotten accepted to Columbia for a journalism program.  I don't know.  But not one moment of this film rang false.  I met every solitary character in the movie.  I dated a girl just like Em, I knew a married musician who made up stories of people he opened for (he did eventually open for a band at the Centrum), I have a jewish friend who majored in Russian Literature before going for a Master degree as an archivist.This film was so emotionally real to me, I have waited for its release since it left the theaters.  I saw it six times in the theaters.This is the movie for post college malaise, we all feel it, we all go through it, we're all still just searching for who we are, what we're going to do, and how we're going to become successful in life.  Chasing dreams, finding ourselves, looking for love.  This movie has all of it.  Its funny, its sad, its brilliant, its powerful, its worth every minute that I've sat through it, every penny that I spent watching it.  If you've graduated college, are going to college, want a movie that reminds you of younger days, of jobs you hate, of girls you love, of friends you leave, of chasing dreams, and of following your heart, this movie is for you to watch.  I don't know how to sell the movie anymore than that, and I don't think I should have to.Ignore the previews, ignore the advertising, focus on the movie itself, go in expecting nothing, and you'll come out with everything.  This movie is wonderful, important, and just overall, an everything that I've ever looked for in a film.  It left that sour feeling in my stomach for the girl I lost out on by not going after her, it made me remember those early days when I worked with friends at stupid jobs that I couldn't stand, it made me remember how the things you think are going to be horrible in life, can actually explain your life to you more than everything you think will be great.",5,For Any College Graduate or Soon to Be One,1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,2494,"['When', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'seeing', 'something', 'Superbad', 'loved', 'Superbad', 'movie', 'High', 'School', 'was', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'aspect', 'Maybe', 'personality', 'maybe', 'had', 'been', 'dating', 'girl', 'looked', 'Em', 'how', 'carried', 'responsed', 'things', 'such', 'maybe', 'was', 'finishing', 'up', 'college', 'having', 'started', 'Community', 'college', 'dad', 'lost', 'job', 'college', 'fund', 'had', 'help', 'family', 'then', 'transfered', 'four', 'year', 'state', 'college', 'Maybe', 'was', 'had', 'gotten', 'accepted', 'Columbia', 'journalism', 'program', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'film', 'rang', 'false', 'met', 'solitary', 'character', 'movie', 'dated', 'girl', 'just', 'Em', 'knew', 'married', 'musician', 'who', 'made', 'up', 'stories', 'people', 'opened', 'did', 'eventually', 'open', 'band', 'Centrum', 'have', 'jewish', 'friend', 'who', 'majored', 'Russian', 'Literature', 'going', 'Master', 'degree', 'archivist.This', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'emotionally', 'real', 'have', 'waited', 'release', 'left', 'theaters', 'saw', 'six', 'times', 'theaters.This', 'movie', 'post', 'college', 'malaise', 'feel', 'go', ""'re"", 'still', 'just', 'searching', 'who', 'are', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'become', 'successful', 'life', 'Chasing', 'dreams', 'finding', 'looking', 'love', 'movie', 'funny', 'sad', 'brilliant', 'powerful', 'worth', 'minute', ""'ve"", 'sat', 'penny', 'spent', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'graduated', 'college', 'are', 'going', 'college', 'want', 'movie', 'younger', 'days', 'jobs', 'hate', 'girls', 'love', 'friends', 'leave', 'chasing', 'dreams', 'following', 'heart', 'movie', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'sell', 'movie', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'have', 'to.Ignore', 'previews', 'ignore', 'advertising', 'focus', 'movie', 'go', 'expecting', 'nothing', ""'ll"", 'come', 'out', 'everything', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'important', 'just', 'overall', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'looked', 'film', 'left', 'sour', 'feeling', 'stomach', 'girl', 'lost', 'out', 'not', 'going', 'made', 'remember', 'early', 'days', 'when', 'worked', 'friends', 'stupid', 'jobs', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'made', 'remember', 'how', 'things', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'horrible', 'life', 'can', 'actually', 'explain', 'life', 'more', 'everything', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'great']",N/A

Yes, they are perfect for their roles, but their characters seem like forced compilations of dozens of other indie-com personalities, making them very hard to root for or against or even care about them too much.

1259537,AQVBOVE8P7K3J,B002BFBAUG,Condor Libros,"[2, 2]","Well, I'll be darned.  This film was a very nice surprise.  An engagingly funny, intelligent, and warm comedy that, while not above a bawdy joke or two, still manages to present characters that feel substantial and real.  I wish I'd seen it sooner.I don't know quite what I was expecting with this film - though I suspect I had visions of past films like ""Superbad,"" ""Pineapple Express,"" and ""Knocked Up""; which is to say, broadly funny films that had heart but also a fairly good deal of raunchy humor.  I enjoyed them all, in a modest way, but I've also recently begun to grow a bit weary of that style. (Call it the Judd Apatow formula of comedy - `Mucho raunchiness + heart.')So, unwilling to plunk down a chunk of change to buy a movie that I had vague doubts about, I checked ""Adventureland"" out from my local library some two weeks before actually watching it.  I'd keep eyeing the movie's casing as it sat there on the shelf by my television, day after day, before opting to watch something else (or even, god help me, grabbing a book).  But last night, I broke down - for I had little else to do (well, that and the fact that my librarians were practically begging for me to bring the movie back); I'm glad I did.The director, Greg Mottola (who also made the ""Superbad""), opts to skip a majority of the raunchy humor this time around (though there is a repeated gag about one kid hitting another in the unmentionables) for a brand of humor that is a little more subtle.As other reviews have noted, this film is definitely not ""Superbad"" - even though it was marketed in a manner that suggested the two films were very much the same.  Where ""Superbad"" was a raunchy, if sweet-natured, film about the adolescent transition between high school and college, ""Adventureland"" is a quieter, slightly more contemplative film - apt, given that it is about lost, wayward, and awkward twentysomethings transitioning from college into real life.  The jokes here grow more from the comedy of human longing and emotion than they do from bodily function.The cast is first rate - in some cases, surprisingly so.  Jesse Eisenberg, whom I had already seen in ""Zombieland"" and ""The Social Network"" - seems to have cornered the market on playing socially awkward roles.  He does it well, but here adds in a nice tinge of sweetness to his lead role of James.  He is genuinely believable as a smart kid with large dreams who is somewhat surprised to find himself working at a seedy amusement park.  Ryan Reynolds turns in a solid, nicely underplayed performance as a local lothario, and - quell surprise - Kristin Stewart proves her detractors wrong by turning in a skilled performance as an emotionally troubled kid who falls for Eisenberg.  As a bonus, ""Freaks and Geaks"" alum Martin Starr and SNL vets Bill Hader and Kristin Wiig give very funny supporting turns as denizens of the amusement park.After watching this film, I had a feeling similar to the one that I got from watching the comedy ""My Idiot Brother,"" with Paul Rudd.  For though the laughs were there in plenty, I couldn't shake the feeling that in its own, quiet way, this film was just so very, very nice.  And I mean that as a real compliment.",5,"A Fine, Funny Film",1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,3199,"['Well', ""'ll"", 'be', 'darned', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'surprise', 'engagingly', 'funny', 'intelligent', 'warm', 'comedy', 'not', 'bawdy', 'joke', 'two', 'still', 'present', 'characters', 'feel', 'substantial', 'real', 'wish', ""'d"", 'seen', 'sooner.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'film', 'suspect', 'had', 'visions', 'past', 'films', 'Superbad', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'say', 'broadly', 'funny', 'films', 'had', 'heart', 'also', 'fairly', 'good', 'deal', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'enjoyed', 'modest', 'way', ""'ve"", 'also', 'recently', 'begun', 'grow', 'bit', 'weary', 'style', 'Call', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'formula', 'comedy', 'Mucho', 'raunchiness', '+', 'heart', 'So', 'unwilling', 'plunk', 'down', 'chunk', 'change', 'buy', 'movie', 'had', 'vague', 'doubts', 'checked', 'Adventureland', 'local', 'library', 'two', 'weeks', 'actually', 'watching', ""'d"", 'keep', 'eyeing', 'movie', 'casing', 'sat', 'shelf', 'television', 'day', 'day', 'opting', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'even', 'god', 'help', 'grabbing', 'book', 'last', 'night', 'broke', 'down', 'had', 'little', 'else', 'do', 'well', 'fact', 'librarians', 'were', 'practically', 'begging', 'bring', 'movie', 'back', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.The', 'director', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'Superbad', 'skip', 'majority', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'time', 'repeated', 'gag', 'one', 'kid', 'hitting', 'unmentionables', 'brand', 'humor', 'little', 'more', 'subtle.As', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'Superbad', 'even', 'was', 'marketed', 'manner', 'suggested', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'Where', 'Superbad', 'was', 'raunchy', 'sweet-natured', 'film', 'adolescent', 'transition', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'Adventureland', 'quieter', 'slightly', 'more', 'contemplative', 'film', 'apt', 'given', 'lost', 'wayward', 'awkward', 'twentysomethings', 'transitioning', 'college', 'real', 'life', 'jokes', 'here', 'grow', 'more', 'comedy', 'human', 'longing', 'emotion', 'do', 'bodily', 'function.The', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'cases', 'surprisingly', 'so', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'whom', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'Zombieland', 'Social', 'Network', 'have', 'cornered', 'market', 'playing', 'socially', 'awkward', 'roles', 'well', 'here', 'nice', 'tinge', 'sweetness', 'lead', 'role', 'James', 'genuinely', 'believable', 'smart', 'kid', 'large', 'dreams', 'who', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'find', 'working', 'seedy', 'amusement', 'park', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'solid', 'nicely', 'underplayed', 'performance', 'local', 'lothario', 'quell', 'surprise', 'Kristin', 'Stewart', 'detractors', 'wrong', 'turning', 'skilled', 'performance', 'emotionally', 'troubled', 'kid', 'who', 'Eisenberg', 'bonus', 'Freaks', 'Geaks', 'alum', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'SNL', 'vets', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Kristin', 'Wiig', 'give', 'very', 'funny', 'supporting', 'turns', 'denizens', 'amusement', 'park.After', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'feeling', 'similar', 'one', 'got', 'watching', 'comedy', 'Idiot', 'Brother', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'laughs', 'were', 'there', 'plenty', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'feeling', 'own', 'quiet', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'nice', 'mean', 'real', 'compliment']",N/A

It was based on Mottola's actual experiences working at an amusement park on Long Island during the summer of 1985. He talks about the casting of Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart who, in turn, talk about their characters. The producers briefly mention how they were able to find a vintage amusement park. Also included is behind-the-scenes footage and clips from the film.There are three deleted scenes with optional commentary from writer/director Greg Mottola and actor Jesse Eisenberg. We get more of the theme park's managers played with killer comic timing by Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig. There is also an additional scene between James and Connell. Mottola puts this footage in context with the rest of the film and briefly explains why it was cut.Finally, there is an audio commentary with Mottola and Eisenberg. They banter back and forth with a lot of self-deprecating humor. Mottola says that he didn't want to make an ""'80s kitsch-fest"" and recounts some of his own experiences working at a theme park in his youth and how it informed the film. Eisenberg chimes in with the occasional comment and asks Mottola questions about the film.

1259539,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002BFBAUG,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Wow, did I ever like this movie, and I saw it in probably one of the worst imaginable locations for a film; on an airplane (this was the standard theatrical release played on a personal video screen, not a PG'd down version).The film just feels like a continuation of a wonderful thread of movies,Almost Famous, andNick & Norah's Infinite Playlist. I must be a sucker for films where the lead character loves music, is a semi-dolt with women, and over thinks everything (High Fidelity is kind of an exception to that mold). Almost Famous is the clear standout, almost masterpiece, of this group, the other two are not nearly as great.The film is set in 1987. James Brennan, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is dealt a horrible blow by his parents. Dad has been demoted (we suspect he has a drinking problem) and there isn't enough money for James to pursue his advanced degree in journalism. James has to get a job. After rejection everywhere he finally gets a job at a small time amusement park, Adventureland. Here he meets the beautiful and intelligent, Em, played by Kristen Stewart. The film centers around James, his greatly aging virginity, a love triangle, and peer pressure. The film has a wonderful pacing weaving in different characters that are perfect representations of all that was good and bad of the late 1980's; as portrayed by 20 and 30 year olds.The actors - Eisenberg has finally come into his own. He was decent in,The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition), and he really stunk in,The Education of Charlie Banks. In this film he has finally lost that stupid long look at the camera or people, with the Jeff Goldblum inability to gracefully move on camera. He is actually a very likeable character in this film. His actions all rang very true to me. Kristen Stewart is perfect as the complex, mysterious, smart, free spirited, troubled, confident, and vulnerable Em. The chemistry between the two lead actors was wonderful, and seemed very real to me. Em's major character flaw, sleeping with the married Mike Connell, was almost her undoing if it hadn't been for James. Ryan Reynolds (Mr. Van Wilder and Waiters) has a 180 degree character change for this film - he does a great job playing the serious role of Mike Connell. He might actually have a career outside of the slapstick stoner comedy role. The rest of the supporting cast was spot on. James Dad and Mom played by Jack Gilpin (long time character actor) and Wendie Malick (the ultra prissy, Nina Van Horn in Just Shoot Me). Adventureland owners or caretakers, played by Saturday Night Live Kristen Wiig (MacGruber sidekick and the lady that repeats everything at the dinner party) and Bill Hader (in virtually every skit anymore). The quintessential 80's girl (big hair, tight pants, tight blouses), Lisa P, played beautifully by Margarita Levieva. And the absolute spot on funny guy but really a dork (stupid tee shirts, short gym shorts, pulled up socks, and gym shoes - always punching James in the nuts), Tommy Frigo, played by Matt Bush.The music - the soundtrack is outstanding on this film. They got the time period perfectly. From Whitesnake, to Judas Priest, to Lou Reed, to Crowded House - it spanned the music styles of the period. Even the made for movie songs were excellent. OK, its not Almost Famous perfect, but darn this music is good.Technically - a very well made film. A bit over one hour 45 minutes, just about the right length. I saw this on a very small LCD screen, not well know for color or sonic precision. With that in mind, the film was steady, in focus, and the colors / exposure appeared right. Pacing was very good. Editing was just right leading up to climaxes in the story. The director did an excellent job showing very intimate moments without being explicit. The moments between James and Em are some of the more romantic moments I've seen in a very long time. There was a natural hesitation and feeling of real passion once they finally got together.Greg Mottola directed three episodes of Arrested Development and Superbad. This film is nothing like his previous work. The other two are in your face comedies, and frankly pretty guy funny heavy. Adventureland approaches the story in a more intelligent manner, but is funny for good reasons.This is a good movie that captures an era extremely well. If Mottola got the Adventureland amusement park perfect or not, well that just doesn't matter. The style of park was captured perfectly. The reasons for their demise is crystal clear in the film - people just got too sophisticated to be scammed by those games anymore. Perfect details for one park are just not important to the story.I enjoyed this film very much. Em, James, Lisa P, Frigo, Mike Connell, and the rest of the cast; they all seemed to be people worth hanging around. The characters rang very true for me, their motivations were believeable. And Greg Mottola did a very good job telling and filming this story.",5,So Darn Good,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,4938,"['Wow', 'did', 'ever', 'movie', 'saw', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'imaginable',

1259540,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B002BFBAUG,Darren,"[0, 1]","I may be overrating this because I was 18 years old in the summer of 1987, when this movie takes place.  So, take this review with that particular grain of salt in mind.The question is:  would this movie have worked if it was set in 2009?  One would have to change nothing but the music.  To me, the answer is Yes; therefore, ""Adventureland"" is not just a trip down memory lane for aging Gen-Xers like me.  But because of the ""period"" setting, I doubt that it was marketed to the teen demographic, who would have probably appreciated it, even if the girls might have wished for a studlier male lead than Jesse Eisenberg.  (The guys would have appreciated Kristen Stewart and whoever that dish is who plays ""Lisa P"".)  If nothing else, the movie would have been a revelation to today's kids who might think that the 80s were all about Madonna and hair bands.  Yes, the 80s DID have great music, and this film features some of that:  the Replacements, Crowded House, pre-""Kick"" INXS, The Cure, and more.  Even the bad music is put to judicious use, like, for example, Judas Priest's ""Breaking the Law"" during a foot-race.  But anachronisms do creep in.  A lot of music from Lou Reed's ""Transformer"" album from 1972 is featured, and, yes, many of us 80s hipsters were seriously into Reed, his earlier band Velvet Underground, and the 60s in general, but the man is practically a plot device in this film: Ryan Reynolds' aging hipster tells tall tales of jamming with Reed to young pretty girls who, believe me, probably didn't know who Reed was even if they had actually heard ""Walk on the Wild Side"" on FM radio at some point in their lives.  The cars are too old:  Pacers? really?  I also saw pull-top aluminum beer cans -- WRONG.  The ""pop-tops"" we know today were long the norm by 87, having come in around 1980, in fact.  The kids in the film sometimes appear to be from 1972 or 1992 -- Kristen Stewart isn't wearing enough makeup, for example.  There was flannel in the 80s, with white checks set off by bright primary colors, but the guys here are wearing dark 90s flannel.  And no 501 jeans.  This movie probably could've used Paul Thomas Anderson's nutty period-perfectionism (cf. ""Boogie Nights"").Well, anyway.  The movie tells the old tale of an over-educated young man who gets the real education while working a horrible job at a seedy amusement park.  He thinks he may have figured out the world because he has studied Comparative Lit and Renaissance Art as an undergrad, but he soon learns that nothing beats life experience, and the crummy details of his job and the young people he befriends there give him plenty of that.  I suspect the role was written expressly for Eisenberg and his particular brand of nerdiness; he's obviously perfect for such a role.  But I was pretty impressed with Kristen Stewart, who the young people supposedly hate because of the ""Twilight"" movies.  Whatever -- she's a fine actress here.  I suppose I'm too old to care, my 45 years giving me enough distance to have no ""cultural stake"" in whether or not Stewart is good or not, but all I saw was a realistic portrayal of a late-adolescent female with the usual issues, which typically involve disappointment with parents.  Perhaps she was bad in ""Twilight"" because those movies are bad -- in much the same way sullen teenagers who work in carny amusement parks are bad employees.  But this is a good movie, and she's good in the role.  Give her a break, kids.""Adventureland"" succeeds in bringing back the whole miserable and wonderful adventure of youth to those of us who remembered when ""Just Like Heaven"" was first released.  To the younger crowd, it should hold up an empathetic mirror to their current struggles.  4 out of 5.",4,"Music, memories",1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,3725,"['may', 'be', 'overrating', 'was', '18', 'years', 'old', 'summer', '1987', 'when', 'movie', 'place', 'So', 'take', 'review', 'particular', 'grain', 'salt', 'mind.The', 'question', 'would', 'movie', 'have', 'worked', 'was', 'set', '2009', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'change', 'nothing', 'music', 'answer', 'Yes', 'therefore', 'Adventureland', 'not', 'just', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'aging', 'Gen-Xers', 'period', 'setting', 'doubt', 'was', 'marketed', 'teen', 'demographic', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'appreciated', 'even', 'girls', 'might', 'have', 'wished', 'studlier', 'male', 'lead', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'guys', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'whoever', 'dish', 'who', 'Lisa', 'P', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'revelation', 'today', 'kids', 'who', 'might', 'think', '80s', 'were', 'Madonna', 'hair', 'bands', 'Yes', '80s', 'DID', 'have', 'great', 'music', 'film', 'Replacements', 'Crowded', 'House', 'pre-', 'Kick', 'INXS', 'Cure', 'more', 'Even', 'bad', 'music', 'put', 'judicious', 'use', 'example', 'Judas', 'Priest', 'Breaking', 'Law', 'foot-race', 'anachronisms', 'do', 'creep', 'lot', 'music', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'Transformer', 'album', '1972', 'featured', 'yes', 'many', '80s', 'hipsters', 'were', 'seriously', 'Reed', 'earlier', 'band', 'Velvet', 'Underground', '60s', 'general', 'man', 'practically', 'plot', 'device', 'film', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'aging', 'hipster', 'tells', 'tall', 'tales', 'jamming', 'Reed', 'young', 'pretty', 'girls', 'who', 'believe', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Reed', 'was', 'even', 'had', 'actually', 'heard', 'Walk', 'Wild', 'Side', 'FM', 'radio', 'point', 'lives', 'cars', 'are', 'too', 'old', 'Pacers', 'really', 'also', 'saw', 'pull-top', 'aluminum', 'beer', 'cans', 'WRONG', 'pop-tops', 'know', 'today', 'were', 'long', 'norm', '87', 'having', 'come', '1980', 'fact', 'kids', 'film', 'sometimes', 'appear', 'be', '1972', '1992', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'enough', 'makeup', 'example', 'was', 'flannel', '80s', 'white', 'checks', 'set', 'off', 'bright', 'primary', 'colors', 'guys', 'here', 'are', 'wearing', 'dark', '90s', 'flannel', '501', 'jeans', 'movie', 'probably', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'nutty', 'period-perfectionism', 'cf', 'Boogie', 'Nights', '.Well', 'anyway', 'movie', 'old', 'tale', 'over-educated', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'real', 'education', 'working', 'horrible', 'job', 'seedy', 'amusement', 'park', 'may', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'world', 'studied', 'Comparative', 'Lit', 'Renaissance', 'Art', 'undergrad', 'soon', 'nothing', 'beats', 'life', 'experience', 'crummy', 'details', 'job', 'young', 'people', 'there', 'give', 'plenty', 'suspect', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'expressly', 'Eisenberg', 'particular', 'brand', 'nerdiness', 'obviously', 'perfect', 'such', 'role', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'who', 'young', 'people', 'supposedly', 'hate', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'fine', 'actress', 'here', 'suppose', ""'m"", 'too', 'old', 'care', '45', 'years', 'giving', 'enough', 'distance', 'have', 'cultural', 'stake', 'not', 'Stewart', 'good', 'not', 'saw', 'was', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'late-adolescent', 'female', 'usual', 'issues', 'typically', 'involve', 'disappointment', 'parents', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'bad', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'sullen', 'teenagers', 'who', 'work', 'carny', 'amusement', 'parks', 'are', 'bad', 'employees', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'role', 'Give', 'break', 'kids', 'Adventureland', 'bringing', 'back', 'whole', 'miserable', 'wonderful', 'adventure', 'youth', 'who', 'remembered', 'when', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'younger', 'crowd', 'should', 'hold', 'up', 'empathetic', 'mirror', 'current', 'struggles', '4', '5']",N/A

1259543,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002BFBAUG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","In 2009,  writer and director Greg Mottola's (""Superbad"", ""Arrested Development"" and ""Undeclared"") film ""Adventureland"" was released in theaters and for the most part, received positive reviews from the film critics.  Now the film receives its High Definition treatment via Blu-ray (which includes a digital copy) and also a DVD release.The film takes place in the 80's and revolves around James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg, ""The Village"" and ""Solitary Man""), a Comparative Literature major who graduated from Oberlin College and plans to pursue his undergraduate degree at Columbia University but first, celebrate his graduation by taking advantage of his family's gift to send him to Europe over the summer.Unfortunately, his father (Jack Gilpin, ""21', ""Law & Order"") was moved to a new department which pays less money than his previous job and thus his mother (Wendie Malick, ""Just Shoot Me!"", ""Fillmore"", ""Frasier""),  break the news to him that the money saved for the trip is now gone, nor can they pay for his college.So, now James must save up money for his trip to Europe by looking for a job.  Unfortunately, finding a job has been too difficult and leaves him with his last resort, working at the local summer theme park known as ""Adventureland"" and is under the constant eye of his boss Bobby (Bill Hader, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and his wife Paulette (Kristin Wiig, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"").James ends up working with Russian Literature major and all-round nerd Joel (Martin Starr, ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"", ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up""); his former childhood best friend Tommy Frigo (Matt Bush, ""Halloween II"") who is now more of a jerk (and for some apparent reason, keeps hitting James in the nads); the technician and musician Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds, ""The Proposal"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""); the Lou Reed fan Em Lewin (Kristen Stewart, ""Twilight"" films) and the sexy Lisa P (Margarita Levieva, ""Spread"" and ""Vanished"").While working at Adventureland, James begins a friendship with his co-workers and eventually gets invited to Em's party. While at the party, the two end up hitting it off and James becomes smitten with her, but he is unaware that Em and Mike Connell have some sort of relationship behind-the-scenes, despite Mike being a married man.And it's hard for anyone to look down on Mike Connel.  It appears that everyone at Adventureland looks up to Connell.  Especially with rumors that he played guitar with Lou Reed, let alone being popular with the women who think he is a rock star.  So, naturally for James (who has not had much experience with girls or dating), he starts to go to Connell for love advice.But through his summer job at Adventureland, James learns a lot about himself, about love but also the pain of being in love.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Adventureland"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and cinematographer Terry Stacey (""Sex and the City"", ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""Wanderlust"" does a good job in bringing the look of the 1980's to film.  One thing that people will notice is the amount of grain on the film.  For those who love the film look, the film definitely retains its grain and shows no sign of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction).For the most part, the film is shot outdoors at a theme park and is shot primarily during the day, thus you get a good amount of color during those sunny days.  While night time shots are either at the amusement park, inside a car or inside a home.  For the most part, blacks are nice and deep and of course, there is shadowing but its typically due to the lighting of the amusement park.  But overall, ""Adventureland"" is a film that looks good and the grain definitely gives the film a sort of nostalgic look to it.As for the audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-Bit) and also French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue driven and music-based film.  Dialogue is clear and understandable through the front and center channels while popular 80's music is a big plus for this film and will definitely be appreciated for those who grew up during this time.  Although the film does not utilize major sound effects, there are scenes such as fireworks during July 4th that really sound nice and poppy through your front and surrounds.Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Adventureland"" comes with the following special features in 1080p or 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital, English SDH, French and Spanish:*Deleted Scenes - (2:27) Deleted scenes featuring: Drunk Mom , Angry Grandfather, James Keeps Quiet.  With optional audio commentary by writer and director Greg Mottola*Audio Commentary - Writer/director Greg Mottola and actor Jesse Eisenberg talk about film. Mottola sets up the scene but for the most part the commentary often features the two joking around while doing commentary.  Interesting comments on the number of songs licensed for the film and the challenges Mottola faced when their budget was low but need a song for the ending credits.*Just My Life: The Making Of Adventureland - (16:31) Director and writer Greg Mottola sits down to reveal how his real life experiences helped inspire his unique comic vision for Daytrippers, Superbad, Arrested Development and now Adventureland. Cast members Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Ryan Reynolds, Bill Hader, and Martin Starr also talk candidly about what shaped them into who they are today, including the worst job they ever had.*Picture Music Selection - For those who enjoyed the 80's music from the film, you can view segments from the film featuring an artist or band's music.*Frigo's Ball Tap - (2:29) The ""drive by,"" the ""ambush,"" the ""stranger,"" the ""tying of the shoe"" and the knee-buckling, tear-inducing ""Bangkok"" are just a few of the nad numbing moves demonstrated by the testicle tapping guru himself, Matt Bush.*Lisa P's Guide To Style - (2:08) Ms. ""Rides, Rides, Rides"" herself, Lisa P (Margarita Levieva), shares her totally hip, totally `80s fashion advice from spiral locks to neon pink nail polish.*Welcome to Adventureland - Fans can learn all there is to know about the Adventureland theme park with a pair commercials promoting Fun-tastic Time at Adventure Land (:33 ) and another for fireworks at Adventureland (:42), the employee orientation kit (3:34) hosted by Joel and a peek at the official drug policy (:44).EASTER EGG: I also found an Easter Egg for the Blu-ray version.  Move left on your remote while ""Bonus Features"" is highlighted and you will see panda bear.  Click on the panda bear to access a Kristen Stewart trying to get into the Razzmatazz dance club. (1:24)JUDGMENT CALL:For those who are interested in ""Adventureland"", one may think that Director Mottola is back with another ""SuperBad"" style of movie but  I just want to emphasize that although ""Adventureland"" does have many humorous elements and the fact that there is a lot of scenes with the characters smoking weed, ""Adventureland"" is very much a love story.  Call it a genuine romantic comedy.What makes this film quite enjoyable is its colorful cast of characters and its wonderful music.  It can easily be called an 80's-style film, pot film (definitely not a hardcore stoner film) but the characters are what makes this film so enjoyable.  You can easily remember Tommy Frigo and his crazy nad hitting antics, Lisa P's sexy 80's dance moves, Joel trying to understand James and how he was able to become closer with Em and even Adventureland managers Bobby and Paulette who are just crazy in their own way.As for the main talent, Jesse Eisenberg was just perfect as James Brennan.  Eisenberg does a great job portraying the awkward Brennan and how he grows as a person throughout the summer.  Kristen Stewart also is a natural in playing the role of Em and bringing that sense that she's a troubled teen and showing us that she has more to offer outside of her popular role in ""Twilight"" (note: Stewart filmed ""Adventureland"" before filming ""Twilight"" but the latter came out in theaters first).As for Ryan Reynolds, his character as Mike Connell is a bit hard to read at first but you eventually see his true colors as the film progresses.  I sort of look at him as a man stuck within his former self of what he could have been but now thrives on being popular to those at the theme park and those people making him out better than he truly is.But for the most part, the characters seem real and genuine, thus making the film much more enjoyable.  As a romantic comedy, it's not the best but it's hard to deny the captivating storyline.  I really enjoyed watching this film!As for the music, ""Adventureland"" is a film that showcases popular 80's music such as Falco's ""Amadeus"", David Bowie's ""Modern Love"", The Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", The Outfield's ""Your Love"", INXS's ""Don't Change"", Expose's ""Point of No Return"",  and many more.  So, it was great to see how music was utilized in the film, especially Falco's ""Amadeus"" (since most of us who grew up at that time know how this song was overplayed).As for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned, the Blu-ray comes with a digital copy of the film and the special features (which are unrated) are quite entertaining.  From ""Frigo's Taps"" and learning about various ways on how to hit someone in the nads was definitely unexpected.  Also, to see a featurette based on the character of Lisa P and showcasing her 80's fashion style was quite interesting.Overall, I enjoyed ""Adventureland"" for being an enjoyable romantic comedy.  A pretty entertaining storyline, intriguing and genuine characters and fabulous music made this film so enjoyable!For those looking for a fun, highly entertaining, young adult romantic comedy especially a film that showcases music from the 80's, definitely give ""Adventureland"" a try.",5,Blu-ray: A hilarious film which will definitely bring 80's nostalgia courtesy of its awesome

This is far from a GREAT film, but it's certainly quite enjoyable and engaging through a combination of believable dialogue, good casting, solid directing, and a well-chosen soundtrack.It covers no new ground---we've all seen this type of ""1970s-summer-romance/coming-of-age"" story before, with a healthy dollop of ""endearing-geek-gets-really-beautiful-girl.""  Yet it shows admirable restraint in not going over the top with the geek-chic (unlike ""Napoleon Dynamite"") and the characters are both familiar and somewhat original at the same time.  So despite faithfully following certain narrative conventions of this genre, it manages to retain a sufficiently redeeming amount of authenticity and realism.  For instance when the two leads finally get it on, they don't just effortlessly and flawlessly shed their clothes and melt into each other's arms as most films would have it---there is still a lot of tentativeness and awkwardness on both of their parts, and the camera cuts away before the fireworks even really start.And of course the fact that Kristen Stewart, probably thanks to some masterful makeup and lighting and camera angles, looks strangely exquisite here (especially in the night-time profile shots of her driving) doesn't exactly hurt, LOL.",4,"It just WORKS, somehow or another...",1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,1339,"['went', 'film', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'far', 'GREAT', 'film', 'certainly', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'engaging', 'combination', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'good', 'casting', 'solid', 'directing', 'well-chosen', 'soundtrack.It', 'new', 'ground', '-we', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'type', '1970s-summer-romance/coming-of-age', 'story', 'healthy', 'dollop', 'endearing-geek-gets-really-beautiful-girl', 'admirable', 'restraint', 'not', 'going', 'top', 'geek-chic', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'characters', 'are', 'familiar', 'somewhat', 'original', 'same', 'time', 'So', 'faithfully', 'following', 'certain', 'narrative', 'conventions', 'genre', 'retain', 'sufficiently', 'redeeming', 'amount', 'authenticity', 'realism', 'instance', 'when', 'two', 'leads', 'finally', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'effortlessly', 'flawlessly', 'shed', 'clothes', 'melt', 'other', 'arms', 'most', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'lot', 'tentativeness', 'awkwardness', 'parts', 'camera', 'away', 'fireworks', 'even', 'really', 'start.And', 'course', 'fact', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'probably', 'thanks', 'masterful', 'makeup', 'lighting', 'camera', 'angles', 'strangely', 'exquisite', 'here', 'especially', 'night-time', 'profile', 'shots', 'driving', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'hurt', 'LOL']",N/A
1259546,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002BFBAUG,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","I worked in food service at Marriott's Great America theme park when I was just out of high school, so I can well imagine how the young protagonist of director/screenwriter Greg Mottola's 2009 coming-of-age dramedy must have felt when he was relegated to an inelegant amusement park after his hopes for a European summer are dashed by his father's demotion at work. Granted my experience was a few years earlier than this story's setting, the Reagan era of 1987, as James Brennan, having just graduated from Oberlin College, prepares to enter Columbia's graduate school of journalism in the fall. Unenthusiastically manning the park's horse-race booth, James finds a friend in Joel, a sympathetic cynic, but more importantly, becomes drawn to sad-eyed Em Lewin.Sharing a predilection for marijuana and moody rock, James and Em embark on a romance, but she is already caught in a doomed relationship with Mike Connell, an older, married ride maintenance man who moonlights as a rock musician. Mottola wrote and directedSuperbad, so he knows how to extract laughs from the foibles of youthful indiscretion. This time, however, he favors the human drama over the comedy, and the result meanders into a few too many subplots to sustain genuine interest in the two principals. Playing a far more sympathetic version of the teen he played in Noah Baumbach'sThe Squid and the Whale. Jesse Eisenberg makes us care about James' fate even though the actor seems to be working off the same geek mojo as Michael Cera. Currently flying high as Bella Swan inTwilight, Kristen Stewart brings the same sullen quality she displayed in that movie and as Meg Ryan's daughter inIn the Land of Womento her portrayal of Em. The two actors banter in much the same way that Cera and Kat Dennings did inNick & Norah's Infinite Playlist.Playing the polar opposite of the put-upon assistant inThe Proposal, Ryan Reynolds lends surprising depth to Connell even as his character's pathetic nature reveals itself, as does Martin Starr (Knocked Up) as sardonic nonconformist Joel.Saturday Night Live's Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig have a few funny moments playing the eccentric husband-and-wife park managers. Between the golden-hued cinematography by Terry Stacey and the period soundtrack, which is full of period hits like H&uuml;sker D&uuml;'s ""Don't Want to Know If You're Lonely"" and Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus"", the 1980's are captured most faithfully here. The 2009 DVD has a standard set of extras - a clever commentary track from Mottola and Eisenberg, three brief deleted scenes with optional commentary, and a standard making-of featurette.",3,A Nostalgic Look at the Eighties in a Meandering Coming-of-Age Romance,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,2618,"['worked', 'food', 'service', 'Marriott', 'Great', 'America', 'theme', 'park', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'high', 'school', 'can', 'well', 'imagine', 'how', 'young', 'protagonist', 'director/screenwriter', 'Greg', 'Mottola', '2009', 'coming-of-age', 'dramedy', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'when', 'was', 'relegated', 'inelegant', 'amusement', 'park', 'hopes', 'European', 'summer', 'are', 'dashed', 'father', 'demotion', 'work', 'Granted', 'experience', 'was', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'story', 'setting', 'Reagan', 'era', '1987', 'James', 'Brennan', 'having', 'just', 'graduated', 'Oberlin', 'College', 'enter', 'Columbia', 'graduate', 'school', 'journalism', 'fall', 'Unenthusiastically', 'manning', 'park', 'horse-race', 'booth', 'James', 'friend', 'Joel', 'sympathetic', 'cynic', 'more', 'importantly', 'drawn', 'sad-eyed', 'Em', 'Lewin.Sharing', 'predilection', 'marijuana', 'moody', 'rock', 'James', 'Em', 'embark', 'romance', 'already', 'caught', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'Mike', 'Connell', 'older', 'married', 'ride', 'maintenance', 'man', 'who', 'rock', 'musician', 'Mottola', 'wrote', 'directedSuperbad', 'how', 'extract', 'laughs', 'foibles', 'youthful', 'indiscretion', 'time', 'however', 'human', 'drama', 'comedy', 'result', 'meanders', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'sustain', 'genuine', 'interest', 'two', 'principals', 'Playing', 'far', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'version', 'teen', 'played', 'Noah', ""Baumbach'sThe"", 'Squid', 'Whale', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'care', 'James', 'fate', 'even', 'actor', 'be', 'working', 'off', 'same', 'geek', 'mojo', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'Currently', 'flying', 'high', 'Bella', 'Swan', 'inTwilight', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'same', 'sullen', 'quality', 'displayed', 'movie', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'daughter', 'Land', 'Womento', 'portrayal', 'Em', 'two', 'actors', 'banter', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Cera', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'did', 'inNick', 'Norah', 'Infinite', 'Playlist.Playing', 'polar', 'opposite', 'put-upon', 'assistant', 'inThe', 'Proposal', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'surprising', 'depth', 'Connell', 'even', 'character', 'pathetic', 'nature', 'reveals', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'sardonic', 'nonconformist', 'Joel.Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'have', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'playing', 'eccentric', 'husband-and-wife', 'park', 'managers', 'golden-hued', 'cinematography', 'Terry', 'Stacey', 'period', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'period', 'hits', 'H', 'uuml', 'sker', 'D', 'uuml', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Want', 'Know', ""'re"", 'Lonely', 'Falco', 'Rock', 'Me', 'Amadeus', '1980', 'are', 'captured', 'most', 'faithfully', 'here', '2009', 'DVD', 'standard', 'set', 'extras', 'clever', 'commentary', 'track', 'Mottola', 'Eisenberg', 'three', 'brief', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'standard', 'making-of', 'featurette']",N/A

1259553,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B002BFBAUG,I'm Right,"[5, 8]","Adventureland is the opposite of Superbad in almost every way except the 'coming of age' theme. Where Superbad was immature and funny, Adventureland is serious and 'mature'. The sad thing is Adventureland could've easily been a good comedy if the writers tried, but they didn't. They went for easy indie trite.So what's so damn 'mature' about this film? Sure as hell wasn't the story, it's just another standard coming of age story with 'unique' 'hip' touches. It sure as hell wasn't the characters, they were all one-dimensional cardboard cutouts basically. In fact the only thing that seemed to have time put into it was constructing the excellent soundtrack, but like Garden State, a good soundtrack doesn't make your cheap coming of age story any better.Let's go over the actors: Jesse Eisenberg has the same anti-social vibe from the Social Network (which was infinitely better), acts disinterested in everything, and is ultimately boring. So in other words he's the perfect uncharismatic protaginast! Kristen Stewart actually puts some effort into her acting, but her character is another dull love interest that's 'mature' because she's conflicted between two guys, you know, the same kinda maturity you see on an afternoon soap opera. Ryan Renolds sleepwalks through his performance as some burn out who never changes his expression nor voice to anything but monotone. Bill Hadar is the funny guy I guess? But he's not, he's just a more obvious douchebag than the rest of the cast, and his 'hilarious' moments are when he yells at people sporatically. Martin Starr as the friend had more natural charisma than the leading man, but again, he doesn't do anything like the rest of this dull cast. He kinda just stares off into space with a look that says 'nerd angst'. So they get all of these good actors and don't do ANYTHING with them, it's almost as big a waste of a solid cast as Life Aquatic.The Story: take any coming of age story and apply here.The Interactions: Oh boy, here's where the (unintentional) jokes come in, where to begin? Well speaking of one dimensional characters, there's some squeaker 'ex best friend' to Jesse Eisenberg who always kicks him in the balls, and yet Jesse hangs out with him anyway. It's like the writers are trying to make a familiar character that we all know in real life. And how does his story arc go? Eventually Jesse kicks him in the balls, to signify that he has indeed become a changed person. Barf. You're probably wondering how the conflict ends up between the two guys? Well there isn't any, it all ends with Jesse passive-aggresively calling Ryan an idiot for not knowing a Lou Reed song. And speaking of which the characters seem to compare their music collection like jocks compare penis sizes in a locker room, multiple times someone will say something like ""I got this new Lou Reed single"" and someone else is like ""wow, that's cool, lets totally play it and not be interested in anything going on"".

Wilkerson,"[3, 3]","James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) has just graduated from Oberlin College with a degree in Comparative Literature, and is planning to take a month off to go to Europe before starting grad school at Columbia to study Journalism when he finds out from his parents that he will not have the money to go to Europe. So in an effort to make money during the summer before moving to Columbia. While there he falls for a free spirited girl he works with, Emily Lewin (Kristen Stewart).Greg Mottola hit the big time as a director when he stepped up to adapt Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's script for a little movie that became Superbad for producer extraordinaire Judd Apatow. For his followup to that movie, Mottola decided to write a semi-autobiographical story of his life working at Adventureland on Long Island in New York. What was advertised was more of a comedy in the vain of Superbad, but what was delivered was a coming of age love story.In reality, I think I am more happy now that I know that the movie is a coming of age love story rather than the raunchy comedy. The movie more or less defies convention, as it's main character, James, is a virgin not looking to have sex for the sake of loosing his virginity, but rather looking for his place. The fact that the main character isn't your typically sexually charged male nerd is, in itself, refreshing. And unlike most comedies of it's ilk, this movie is less concerned with punchlines as it is with developing it's characters. In the end, it's still the characters that make the movie, not the other way around.The acting in this movie is great. Jesse Eisenberg, unfortunately seeming to be more and more typecast, still does the geek chic thing very well. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, of course being SNL alumni and at the top of the current class, bring the funny. Martin Starr plays the conflicted friend Joel, a character not far off from his character in Freaks and Geeks, while Ryan Reynolds gives a performance that is very understated for his typically more flamboyant style. Kristen Stewart was the real surprise to me though. For most of the movie she really seemed to be just swimming through, but toward the end it really seemed as if the character bared her soul, and she did a great job at portraying that.If there was a flaw in the film, it wouldn't be with the film itself, but rather with the advertising that made the film seem like something different than what it is. In actuality, that advertising short sold the film for those of us that would have been more interested in the actual finished product. I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes dramedy's and if you like movies that really let you into the film characters lives.4/5",4,Adventureland,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,2716,"['James', 'Brennan', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'just', 'graduated', 'Oberlin', 'College', 'degree', 'Comparative', 'Literature', 'planning', 'take', 'month', 'go', 'Europe', 'starting', 'grad', 'school', 'Columbia', 'study', 'Journalism', 'when', 'out', 'parents', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'money', 'go', 'Europe', 'So', 'effort', 'make', 'money', 'summer', 'moving', 'Columbia', 'free', 'spirited', 'girl', 'Emily', 'Lewin', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', '.Greg', 'Mottola', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'director', 'when', 'stepped', 'up', 'adapt', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'Evan', 'Goldberg', 'script', 'little', 'movie', 'became', 'Superbad', 'producer', 'extraordinaire', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'followup', 'movie', 'Mottola', 'decided', 'write', 'semi-autobiographical', 'story', 'life', 'working', 'Adventureland', 'Long', 'Island', 'New', 'York', 'What', 'was', 'advertised', 'was', 'more', 'comedy', 'vain', 'Superbad', 'what', 'was', 'delivered', 'was', 'coming', 'age', 'love', 'story.In', 'reality', 'think', 'am', 'more', 'happy', 'now', 'know', 'movie', 'coming', 'age', 'love', 'story', 'rather', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'defies', 'convention', 'main', 'character', 'James', 'virgin', 'not', 'looking', 'have', 'sex', 'sake', 'loosing', 'virginity', 'rather', 'looking', 'place', 'fact', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'typically', 'sexually', 'charged', 'male', 'nerd', 'refreshing', 'most', 'comedies', 'ilk', 'movie', 'less', 'concerned', 'punchlines', 'developing', 'characters', 'end', 'still', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'acting', 'movie', 'great', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'unfortunately', 'seeming', 'be', 'more', 'more', 'typecast', 'still', 'geek', 'chic', 'thing', 'very', 'well', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'course', 'being', 'SNL', 'alumni', 'top', 'current', 'class', 'bring', 'funny', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'conflicted', 'friend', 'Joel', 'character', 'not', 'far', 'character', 'Freaks', 'Geeks', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'performance', 'very', 'understated', 'typically', 'more', 'flamboyant', 'style', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'was', 'real', 'surprise', 'most', 'movie', 'really', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'swimming', 'end', 'really', 'seemed', 'character', 'bared', 'soul', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'that.If', 'was', 'flaw', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'film', 'rather', 'advertising', 'made', 'film', 'seem', 'something', 'different', 'what', 'actuality', 'advertising', 'short', 'sold', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interested', 'actual', 'finished', 'product', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'dramedy', 'like', 'movies', 'really', 'let', 'film', 'characters', 'lives.4/5']",N/A

In particular, there's a special effort in the film to keep the characters from being too predictable and one-note: Everyone seems to have good and less-than-good qualities, and act in both stable and not-so-stable ways.

1259568,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002BFBAUG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","As you've no doubt heard, Adventureland was marketed as a teenage comedy in the vein of Superbad. Despite sharing the same director Greg Mottola (who also wrote this film), the two have little in common. In fact, Adventureland has more of a kinship withAll the Real Girlsthan Superbad. This is not a sex comedy or a teen-drug movie (although it does have drug content). Adventureland is a coming-of-age story that is much better than that description seems to imply. If you're expecting a hilarious comedy, this is not the movie for you as much of it's humor is more amusing and subtle as opposed to hilarious.The year is 1987 and James (Jesse Eisenberg) is planning a graduation trip to Europe before he begins attending grad school in New York City. However, when James' parents fail to come through with the money for his trip, he's forced to get a summer job in Pittsburgh at Adventureland. There, he meets Emily (Kirten Stewart), an intriguing, yet withdrawn girl who can't commit due to an ongoing affair with Adventureland's custodian Connell (Ryan Reynolds).This weak synopsis I've provided sounds like a typical ""summer love"" story but Mottola's a much better writer than that. He creates real, fleshed-out characters and never resorts to character cliches to present them. These characters are confused, passionate, intelligent...They have depth; something rarely found in these kinds of movies. Look at the relationship between James and Emily for evidence of this. Their relationship is touching, heartfelt, and genuine; a rarity for almost any movie let alone a comedy.The movie takes place in the 1980s, but this is simply a nostalgic background for a story that is not confined to any particular time period. There's a broad range of emotions on display here due to both clever writing and impressive performances.The stand-out here is Kirsten Stewart, who has been appearing in movies since a young age but has only recently found fame with her role in the Twilight series. Stewart displays real acting chops here, capturing the tough, withdrawn nature of her character in a way not every young actress could. She's a charmer, but you can see her as the kind of girl that lets you in just enough to have less of a distance to push you out. Eisenberg perfectly embodies the opposite of her character in his performance as James, which would be easier to applaud if I had seen Eisenberg play a character different from this one. He seems very comfortable at this point playing characters filled with virginal angst.Bill Hader, as Adventureland's manager Bobby, seems to serve as the character with the funniest bits. His periodical outburts at people who don't properly dispose of their trash at the park are hilarious. Shockingly enough, Ryan Reynolds turns in a straight-forward performance dropping the Van Wilder-shtick he's seemingly carried over into every film he's done since that one.In short, Adventureland really surprised me. Movies of this sort with realistic, well-drawn characters are really becoming obsolete and Adventureland does almost everything right. It's not a masterpiece but I enjoyed it so much I can't even pick out it's flaws. For this genre, it's a really great movie. It's really sad that this film doesn't have a wider audience and it certainly deserves one. If you watch this with an open mind, not expecting 'Superbad Redux' I think you'll find Adventureland to be a diamond in the rough; amusing and surprising in so many different areas.GRADE: A-",5,"Terribly Underrated, Coming-of-Age Story",1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,3495,"[""'ve"", 'doubt', 'heard', 'Adventureland', 'was', 'marketed', 'teenage', 'comedy', 'vein', 'Superbad', 'sharing', 'same', 'director', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'film', 'two', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'fact', 'Adventureland', 'more', 'kinship', 'Real', 'Girlsthan', 'Superbad', 'not', 'sex', 'comedy', 'teen-drug', 'movie', 'have', 'drug', 'content', 'Adventureland', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'much', 'better', 'description', 'imply', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'not', 'movie', 'much', 'humor', 'more', 'amusing', 'subtle', 'opposed', 'hilarious.The', 'year', '1987', 'James', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'planning', 'graduation', 'trip', 'Europe', 'attending', 'grad', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'However', 'when', 'James', 'parents', 'fail', 'come', 'money', 'trip', 'forced', 'get', 'summer', 'job', 'Pittsburgh', 'Adventureland', 'Emily', 'Kirten', 'Stewart', 'intriguing', 'yet', 'withdrawn', 'girl', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'commit', 'due', 'ongoing', 'affair', 'Adventureland', 'custodian', 'Connell', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', '.This', 'weak', 'synopsis', ""'ve"", 'provided', 'sounds', 'typical', 'summer', 'love', 'story', 'Mottola', 'much', 'better', 'writer', 'real', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'never', 'resorts', 'character', 'cliches', 'present', 'characters', 'are', 'confused', 'passionate', 'intelligent', 'have', 'depth', 'something', 'rarely', 'found', 'kinds', 'movies', 'Look', 'relationship', 'James', 'Emily', 'evidence', 'relationship', 'touching', 'heartfelt', 'genuine', 'rarity', 'almost', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'comedy.The', 'movie', 'place', '1980s', 'simply', 'nostalgic', 'background', 'story', 'not', 'confined', 'particular', 'time', 'period', 'broad', 'range', 'emotions', 'display', 'here', 'due', 'clever', 'writing', 'impressive', 'performances.The', 'stand-out', 'here', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', 'who', 'been', 'appearing', 'movies', 'young', 'age', 'only', 'recently', 'found', 'fame', 'role', 'Twilight', 'series', 'Stewart', 'real', 'acting', 'chops', 'here', 'capturing', 'tough', 'withdrawn', 'nature', 'character', 'way', 'not', 'young', 'actress', 'could', 'charmer', 'can', 'see', 'kind', 'girl', 'just', 'enough', 'have', 'less', 'distance', 'push', 'out', 'Eisenberg', 'perfectly', 'opposite', 'character', 'performance', 'James', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'applaud', 'had', 'seen', 'Eisenberg', 'play', 'character', 'different', 'one', 'very', 'comfortable', 'point', 'playing', 'characters', 'filled', 'virginal', 'angst.Bill', 'Hader', 'Adventureland', 'manager', 'Bobby', 'serve', 'character', 'funniest', 'bits', 'periodical', 'outburts', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'properly', 'dispose', 'trash', 'park', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Shockingly', 'enough', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'straight-forward', 'performance', 'dropping', 'Van', 'Wilder-shtick', 'seemingly', 'carried', 'film', 'done', 'short', 'Adventureland', 'really', 'surprised', 'Movies', 'sort', 'realistic', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'becoming', 'obsolete', 'Adventureland', 'almost', 'everything', 'right', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'pick', 'out', 'flaws', 'genre', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'really', 'sad', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'wider', 'audience', 'certainly', 'one', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'not', 'expecting', 'Redux', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Adventureland', 'be', 'diamond', 'rough', 'amusing', 'surprising', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'areas.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
1259569,A3TTZQ1WARN3ZT,B002BFBAUG,J. Romeo,"[1, 3]","(SPOILERS AHEAD!) Don't worry if you didn't see this movie in the theaters or haven't had a chance to rent it, because you've seen this movie before. Adventureland follows an old formula: boy meets girl. Boy and girl fall in love. Something happens that make boy and girl break up. Of course, they still love each other. Then something happens that brings boy and girl back together.It's not that formulas are bad. Plenty of movies are based on the same concepts and ideas. For example: Something tragic happens to character X's family. Character X seeks revenge. Character X gets his revenge. Apply this formula one way and we get The Outlaw Josey Wales. Apply it in another way and we get Punisher: Warzone. The difference is the first movie had something to say and the second movie was an excuse to show explosions on the big screen.Adventureland falls into the second category of a movie that has nothing to say. Greg Mottola, who directed Superbad, brought nothing new to a crowded genre of movies saying the same thing. It's Say Anything without the boom box. It's Jerry Maguire without the ""You had me at hello."" It's The Notebook without the notebook.I could almost forgive Mottola for creating a movie that has no interest in being anymore than what it is. Not every film can have a defining moment that captures an audience's heart or defines a generation. However, every movie should have characters the audience cares about. There should be some connection between characters in a movie and the audience. Audiences wanted Marty McFly to get back to the future just as much as they wanted Biff to get his @ss kicked. We loved Marty; we hated Biff. However, we had a connection with Biff, because we have all known a Biff that we wanted to punch in the nose.Mottola failed to create and develop characters that we care about one-way or the other. If James and Em get back together, that's fine. If they don't get back together, that's fine. If Mike is cheating on his wife, that's fine. If they all get hit by a bus, that's fine too. The impression is that Mottola doesn't care about his characters and if a director doesn't care about his characters then why should we? It's a shame, because the film has a very talented roster.In the lead role of James is Jesse Eisenberg. James is the self-deprecating, uncomfortable, nerdy guy who is figuring out life. Eisenberg is perfect in the role. He has perfected this same character in other movies like Rodger Dodger and The Hunting Party. It was the same character he played in Zombieland (hmmm.....Adventureland to Zombieland. Coincidence? ).Playing Eisenberg's love interest is Kristen Stewart...give me a moment to regain my composure.... Stewart plays Em, the girl that shows James the amusement park ropes. I will go on record right now saying, ""I like Kristen Stewart."" She reminds me of the girl in school (high school, GED classes, college) who is hotter than a three-alarm fire, but has a low self-esteem. You know the girl who covers everything, from the bangs that go past her eyes to the baggy clothes that cover everything else. The girl who thinks that she has to look weird and reject others before they can reject her. The girl who could have anyone, if she were to give it half a chance.Of course, James falls deeply and madly in love with her before she even opens her mouth. I don't blame the guy; it's Kristen Stewart! However, there is not one single moment in the film that we can see a spark between the two of them. The movie goes from the two of them meeting and then jumps to them being in love. It just happens and we have to go along with it, because Mottola hasn't given us any other choice.In this type of movie there is always something that tears the happy couple apart. Playing the wedge that comes between James and Em is Mike, played by Ryan Reynolds. I like Reynolds as an actor. He has talent and in movies like Adventureland, he gets to show it. Too often we see Reynolds in movies where he is the smart @ss or the class clown. I admit it; he does a great job in movies like Van Wilder, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, and Waiting. But, it's movies like Definitely, Maybe, The Nines, and The Amityville Horror that we really get to see Reynolds shine.Mike, the amusement park's handy man, had an affair with Em. James freaks out after he learns that the two of them had something going on in the past. Of course, he doesn't want to see her again. This isn't the sad moment that it should be because Mottola has shoved on us a love connection between James and Em that we never believed in the first place. We still don't care when James realizes he made a mistake dumping a hottie like Kristen Stewart and tries to win her back.The real gems in this movie are Bill Hader and Kristnen Wigg. You may remember Hader as Seth Rogen's cop partner in Superbad and Wigg from Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. Both actors are hysterical as the owners of the amusement park where James and Em work. They steal every scene that they're in. Unfortunately, neither one of them are on screen long enough to save the movie.You won't regret watching Adventureland, but there are better flicks that deserve your

Watching the extras only cemented this view. (oh, and the main female character's name was ""Em"" - go figure) Most of the intimate behavior was only believable if you imagined it being between gay guys, otherwise, it was just weird and uncomfortable. I had only seen Superbad and hadn't known who directed it, so I watched it on the strength of that mention plus the funny preview. So of course I slogged through it waiting for its quality to shine through, which unfortunately never did.

Although there are some cheeky scenes, it is still better than I expected.The plot is very simple. James(Eisenberg) plays a typical high school graduate who has good grades and has a bright future. He dreams of going to the Big Apple and studying there. But he's broke. He ended up getting a job at a theme park called Adventureland. It kinda looks like a crappy job with kids vomiting, adults cheating for their kids and obnoxious teens on group dates. But when he finally meets his dream girl in co-worker Em (Stewart), everything changed. It isn't a typical teenage love story because there are some twists and conflicts like a secret love affair. (Spoiler, sorry.) Considering this is from Director Greg Mottola, this lacks hilarious scenes like those in Superbad or Knocked Up. But thanks to Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who play the couple who runs the park, there are laugh-worthy scenes. There's also a tinge of indie vibe in this film with all those music (especially the music!), the lines and their clothes (that Games, Games, Games gray t-shirt).The thing that impresses me most about this whole movie are both the performances of Eisenberg and Stewart. They fit the characters perfectly. They're so believable. You'll wonder if Eisenberg's really that awkward in real-life and Stewart showed she was just another confused kid.It wasn't that outstanding or Oscar-worthy but what's important is that it entertained.

Set in the late 80's, Eisenberg plays the main character, a recent college graduate working at Adventureland to raise funds to attend Columbia graduate school.  Viewers in their young 20's will find this premise crazy, because these days there's no way anyone could fund their education (especially at Columbia) with a summertime carnival gig, but those thoughts faded into the background as the awkward but sweet chemistry between Eisenberg's James and Kristen Stewart's Em emerges.Aside from the romantic backstory, other characters are given a chance to shine--including Bill Hader as the nerdy, penny-pinching boss, Margarita Levieva as Lisa P., Adventureland's hot girl-next-door, and Ryan Reynolds as Connell, a womanizing married man.Overall, it was a less climactic movie than some of the films it will inevitably be compared to, but what it lacks in outrageousness it makes up for in relatable characters and an ending (not spoiled here) that will make even the most stoic movie watcher smile.",5,"Cute, understated comedy",1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1199,"['not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'Superbad', 'movie', 'was', 'subtler', 'comedy', 'where', 'most', 'funny', 'moments', 'come', 'interactions', 'characters', 'rather', 'outlandish', 'situations', 'Set', 'late', '80', 'Eisenberg', 'main', 'character', 'recent', 'college', 'graduate', 'working', 'Adventureland', 'raise', 'funds', 'attend', 'Columbia', 'graduate', 'school', 'Viewers', 'young', '20', 'will', 'find', 'premise', 'crazy', 'days', 'way', 'anyone', 'could', 'fund', 'education', 'especially', 'Columbia', 'summertime', 'carnival', 'gig', 'thoughts', 'faded', 'background', 'awkward', 'sweet', 'chemistry', 'Eisenberg', 'James', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Em', 'emerges.Aside', 'romantic', 'backstory', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'shine', 'including', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'nerdy', 'penny-pinching', 'boss', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'Lisa', 'P.', 'Adventureland', 'hot', 'girl-next-door', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Connell', 'womanizing', 'married', 'man.Overall', 'was', 'less', 'climactic', 'movie', 'films', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'compared', 'what', 'outrageousness', 'up', 'relatable', 'characters', 'ending', 'not', 'spoiled', 'here', 'will', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'stoic', 'movie', 'watcher', 'smile']",N/A

The recent economic downturn is featured in family cut-backs and youth downsizing their dreams.

He had plans to go on a European vacation he dreamed of, and also plans to move to New York and go to a good college and make something of his life.  He has to take a poorly paying summer job at a local amusement park.  The movie has character studies of the amusement park workers and the dynamics.  They all share the same dopey job, wearing special T-shirts (""Games"" or ""Rides"").  There are some laughs in the dead-end jobs, and actually some preparation excercises for the real world.  The future of these kids did not seem that great, and a sad feeling came over me as I realized how many college-educated kids are out there looking for scarce well-paying jobs.  These kids just got high on weed or denial about futures.  The film is upbeat, but an underlying dread permeates this comedy/drama.  Boredom and no good-paying job opportunities are there for them and their parents.

Then his promised European Road Trip is kyboshed in Scene 2 by his downsizing parents who can&#8217;t afford new drapes let alone a graduation present. Then things get really nasty for our sensitive Renaissance student when he&#8217;s sentenced to work at the notorious cesspool that is the &#8220;Adventureland&#8221; Amusement Park in Pittsburgh (title above).But during a brutally honest induction course from the bug-eyed Joel (great work from Martin Starr) James notices something well worth the pain of puking children and a childhood pest called Frigo who can&#8217;t seem to resist jokily kicking him in the privates at every opportunity. The eye-opener James clocks is the seemingly ordinary yet ethereally beautiful Em (Kristen Stewart) who is all Lou Reed and David Bowie teeshirts and smoky eyes and magical long hair. The kind of girl you want to make mix tapes for and even consider joining a gym. From the moment he meets the svelte Em poor James is a goner &#8211; hopelessly falling for the emotionally conflicted young woman no matter what extra-curricular crap she pulls on him.Em&#8217;s biological mom has passed two years prior via a long and horrible battle with cancer and she&#8217;s left living with a Stepmom she despises (and vice versa) and a father who seems unable to fathom his daughter. Em is therefore feckless in her relationships and reluctant to commit to anything other than drinking and toking and hanging out after work &#8211; sappily accepting the occasional rumble in the kitchen with Mike the Rock 'n' Roll star of the Park (a cool and suave Ryan Reynolds). But James the nice guy persists despite customers who try to rob the Giant Pandas and the attention of the playground&#8217;s curvaceous babe Lisa P (the deeply sexy Margarita Levieva). Slowly but surely Em begins to see the merits of a nice guy who&#8217;s willing to take a few punches for her and equally not allow her to anyone&#8217;s punching bag. &#34;You may be the cutest and coolest guy I've ever dated&#8230;&#34; she finally admits in a clincher behind the arcades - making James want to go all Johnny Weissmuller and yodel from the trees.The funniest parts go to Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as the odd couple Bobby and Paulette who run the rip-off-for-all-the-family rides and games with a baseball bat and motivational speeches about horse races. Also like Cameron Crowe&#8217;s wonderful &#34;Elizabethtown&#34; - &#34;Adventureland&#34; has a gargantuan soundtrack &#8211; featuring a cool tune from all periods in almost every scene. Lou Reed, The Cure, Big Star, The Replacements, The Rolling Stones, Nick Lowe and Crowded House &#8211; to name but a few - the list of appropriate choices is legion and they&#8217;re used well (as James watches Em drive &#8211; you can see him falling in love as Lou Reed&#8217;s lyrics echo his aching for her).The Blu Ray pictured is defaulted to 16 x9/1.85:1 so its fills the entire screen but because a large amount of the scenes take place at night and in people&#8217;s homes &#8211; those shots can have some grain and fuzziness.

This is by the same group who made movies like Superbad, Knocked up, etc.  It is not a traditional comedy however.  It is a combination coming of age, romance, some comedy and even some drama.  Jesse Eisenberg's character is stuck having to get a summer job at an amusement part when his plans to take a summer trip to Europe before starting school.  While there he falls for Kristen Stewart's character, and the story eventually follows their relationship.The acting in the movie is top notch.  Even Kristen Stewart who has a tendency to be very wooden and monotone does a good job.  Bill Hader and Kristen Wig are great in their roles, as do the rest of the cast.  The film is set in the late 80s so those who grew up at that time will also appreciate the soundtrack as they came up with a lot of old 80s songs that will bring back memories for those old enough to remember that time.The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, although it is not really the kind of movie that you necessarily get that much more on Blu Ray as opposed to DVD.

Kellner ""PAK""","[0, 0]","""Adventureland"" written and directed by Greg Mottola1987, Pennsylvania; James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) has just graduated college and is ready to embark on his long awaited European tour before going on to grad school in New York in the fall. Unfortunately James' father has been transferred into a much lower paying position which results in the summer trip being canceled and his ability to attend grad school is in question also. James hasn't reached the bottom yet however as he has to get a summer job and with his lack of experience the only thing currently available is a position as a game operator at the local amusement park Adventureland with his former best friend Frigo. The job is less than satisfactory but James does take interest in his co-worker Em (Kristen Stewart) so maybe the job won't be a complete waste of time...Adventureland was a great movie but isn't going to be for everyone. Adventureland wasn't a basic Rom/Com as it didn't employ the typical over the top slapstick comedy and instead relied on a slightly smarter brand of humor combined with some crude humor.The Good: Great performances from all the actors/actresses and the move was well cast. I thought Kristen Stewart's take on her character was great. The character is very flawed and Kristen nailed it. The same can be said for Jesse's portrayal of James. The time in which the story takes place was an interesting choice and worked well and also provided a great soundtrack. Loved the humor in this movie and that it didn't rely on trite slap stick or completely on crude humor.The Bad: Nothing memorable.Overall: If you are a fan of any of the actors / actresses or Rom Com in general than give Adventureland a try.",4,4 1/2!

1259608,AXHWQ834G3IUV,B002BFBAUG,Paul D. Sandor,"[2, 2]","Adventureland is a small film that takes hold of you in a big way. First, this movie is not for everyone. If you are expecting the wild antics and R-rated slapstick of Superbad, you'll probably be disappointed. Since this film was marketed to the Superbad audience, I felt confused during the first twenty minutes of the film. No worries: once the characters catch fire and the the back story is explained Adventureland soars.Adventureland mirrors my past: I went to college in the eighties, worked a lousy min. wage job and partied in the same cavalier way. This little movie nails this aspect of life (my life, anyway) better than any film I've seen.The basic plot of boy (young man) gets a part time job he hates and finds a beautiful girl he loves is nothing new. The attention here is in the nuanced details: the laser accurate acting and poetic cinematography.The eighties soundtrack fits perfectly (the Cure's Just Like Heaven and INXS' Don't Change come instantly to mind.) Kristin Stewart  (a talented young leading actress who is not a bimbo) as Em steals the show. In one memorable scene, Velvet Underground's Pale Blue Eyes plays as she drives our hero (Jesse Eisrnberg)home. Em's face and light blue eyes shine with a vulnerability that is both endearing and heart wrenching.This film is a thoughtful one that is filled with metaphors (the amusement park rides, games and setting are life) and irony (the disparity between what we think we know about someone and who or what they actually are.)Adventureland's most thought provoking message: Those youthful days (and nights) within the framework of jobs we hated were the happiest times of our lives...Highly recommended for fans of Catcher in the Rye, Almost Famous, John Hughes films and the kinder and gentler moments in Judd Apatow movies.",5,Kristen Stewart shines in Adventureland...,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,1806,"['Adventureland', 'small', 'film', 'hold', 'big', 'way', 'First', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'are', 'expecting', 'wild', 'antics', 'R-rated', 'slapstick', 'Superbad', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'was', 'marketed', 'Superbad', 'audience', 'felt', 'confused', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'worries', 'once', 'characters', 'catch', 'fire', 'back', 'story', 'explained', 'Adventureland', 'soars.Adventureland', 'mirrors', 'past', 'went', 'college', 'eighties', 'worked', 'lousy', 'min', 'wage', 'job', 'partied', 'same', 'cavalier', 'way', 'little', 'movie', 'aspect', 'life', 'life', 'anyway', 'better', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'boy', 'young', 'man', 'part', 'time', 'job', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'nothing', 'new', 'attention', 'here', 'nuanced', 'details', 'laser', 'accurate', 'acting', 'poetic', 'cinematography.The', 'eighties', 'soundtrack', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'Cure', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'INXS', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Change', 'come', 'instantly', 'mind', 'Kristin', 'Stewart', 'talented', 'young', 'leading', 'actress', 'who', 'not', 'bimbo', 'Em', 'show', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'Pale', 'Blue', 'Eyes', 'hero', 'Jesse', 'Eisrnberg', 'home', 'Em', 'face', 'light', 'blue', 'eyes', 'shine', 'vulnerability', 'endearing', 'heart', 'wrenching.This', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'one', 'filled', 'metaphors', 'amusement', 'park', 'rides', 'games', 'setting', 'are', 'life', 'irony', 'disparity', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'what', 'actually', 'are', 'Adventureland', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'message', 'youthful', 'days', 'nights', 'framework', 'jobs', 'hated', 'were', 'happiest', 'times', 'lives', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'John', 'Hughes', 'films', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'moments', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'movies']",N/A

But besides proving that theory right and probably resulting in me being banned from all amusement parks and their games from here on out, this is a good film.  It's actually based on a theme park on Long Island, though it was filmed in Pennsylvania because the actual park had changed so much from the 1980s era that we see in the film.  I do agree with that location choice, but I do wish they could have filmed in the actual Adventureland.  But I blame that park's owners for changing everything so much...again, I'm probably now banned for life.  Anyway, this film was filled with a cast of characters who, while trying to find their way in life, work at this amusement park, amusingly run by Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader (seriously, this couple is just fun to watch, even if they are not the main characters.)  The film's diologue was, for the most part, witty and entertaining, making it feel almost like real life.  I did think that Jesse Eisenberg's character (our leading man) ranged from being whiny to goody-goody...all annoying traits in my book.  Yes, your life isn't going the way you nessessarily want it to...that doesn't mean you have to constantly complain about it or speak in a way that just puts you so far out of touch with everyone else.  The only scene of his that I really enjoyed was when he worked at the horse-racing game.  Thank God Kristen Stewart was there to straighten him out for the rest of the film...or at least she tried.  But Ms. Stewart delivered a performance worth watching and I say that in large part to the fact that she whined only when it was really called for.  While she takes the prize of playing my favorite female character in the film, Martin Starr plays my favorite male character.  Mr. Starr's character of Joel delivers that witty banter that comes about even when the speaker isn't trying to be witty, a perfect trait for this film.  Maybe there should be a sequel/spinoff about him...Sorry, I don't have the cash for it or I'd totally make that happen.  This film is a comedy and strives to be nothing else...and I'm just fine with that.  It delivers great jokes laced across a good plot with a great setting.

Wow, I am just amazed at the young talent such as Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart. I haven't seen ""Twilight"" but this film makes me want to go see it just for Kristen Stewart.

Jesse Eisenberg is the dorky nerd character which is done quite well but don't know if that's really how he is. Basically, low self-esteem in front of others with nervous stuttering and goofy/cool response in awkward situations. Also, the amusement park is itself a character. It reminds me of my childhood days at Johnstone Park (Kiddie Park- Bartlesville, OK) which had rides that you can pay in $0.10 tickets. I love Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader in this film which are deadpans of the managers who have to deal with summer job kids.The DVD has a nice ""making the film"" short which has interviews with all the characters.

It's a movie Kristen Stewart shot before TWILIGHT.  But this time around, she's not falling for a dark, mysterious and brooding hero.What is ADVENTURELAND?  It's a charming, well-acted, intelligently written and highly enjoyable coming-of-age story set at a 1980s amusement park.Jesse Eisenberg gives a fine performance as James Brennan, the virginal, insecure, awkwardly intelligent college grad who takes a summer job at Adventureland when his parents' financial troubles force him to cancel his European summer plans.  Kristen Stewart shines as Em, the girl he falls for but who happens to be involved with the park's married maintenance guy.  Stewart makes her character believably screwed up, both in her home life and in how she compartmentalizes and balances her dueling summer relationships.  Meanwhile, Ryan Reynolds makes Mike, the maintenance guy, a tightly wound bundle of emotions, playing him as an aging town stud who understands that while most of the young people who surround him may enjoy a summer of fun, games and meaningless rides, he's the only one who'll be doing it all again next summer.There's a great supporting cast and a fun '80s soundtrack, too.So don't expect SUPERBAD.

1259620,A3FKUNRTSNT6Q3,B002BFBAUG,Ridingsolo,"[0, 2]","There was one thing about this movie that I found repulsive.  Stewart was born in 1990.  Ryan was born in 1976.  The movie was distributed in 2009, which means it was probably made in 2008.  Considering how young Stewart is and looks in this one, Ryan's character is probably at best creepy and probably a pedophile, something you just can't see from Ryan and the writers offer no character development to explain how either character could do what they did.  Ryan has unique star talent but his stage presence is likable and charming, so for him to play a creepy pedophile, significant character development is necessary and missing entirely from this movie.  Couple that with Stewart maybe being 18 but looking 16 at best, and non-pedophiles will probably find part of this story to be gross.That said, the movie is an exceptional period piece if you're interested in the development of Stewart and Eisenberg as actors.  Both struggle with parts that are too adult for their real life stage of development, but both seem to get better at their roles as the movie progressed, meaning that you can actually watch these two transition from being child actors to adult actors and because of that I found the movie very interesting. At the beginning, Stewart is so uncomfortable playing a romantic role that it is hard to watch, but by the end of the movie (with someone her own age), she takes on a different glow altogether and is much more comfortable in the role.  You could speculate an entirely different outcome of her role in Twilight had she not done this movie first (this one was filmed only a few months before).

Zwick,"[2, 3]","Upon graduating from college, James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) finds himself with a degree in Comparative Literature and Renaissance Studies - and little else of the stuff to build a successful life on.  Forced by financial constraints to move back in with his parents, James takes a summer job as a carny at a seedy amusement park known as Adventureland (the movie was shot at Pittsburgh`s Kennywood Park).  His fellow sufferers-in-purgatory include his even more geeky friend, Joel (Martin Starr); his tormentor from elementary school, Frigo (Matt Bush); the elusive girl-of-his-dreams, Emily (Kristen Stewart); hunky security manager, Mike (Ryan Reynolds), who, though married, has got a secret thing going on the side with Emily; sexy hot bombshell, Lisa P (Margarita Levieva); and, finally, two park supervisors played by SNL regulars Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, whose function is to add some understated goofiness to the movie's otherwise gently realistic tone.Based partly on the experiences of writer/director Greg Mottola (who established his bona fides in the genre a few years back with ""Superbad""), ""Adventureland"" is one of those rare youth comedies in which the characters actually come across as real people and not as contrivances paying script-service to a typical coming-of-age story.  Mottola's flavorful script nicely captures the rhythms and tones of everyday speech.  In fact, much of the humor derives from the fact that James, fresh from his immersion in  liberal arts academia, often has a hard time reeling in his Ivy League phrasing and diction when engaging in everyday conversations with his fellow workers.As James, the perpetually tongue-tied 23-year-old virgin who wears his heart on his sleeve, Eisenberg perfectly captures all the insecurity and awkwardness of a young man utterly inexperienced in the ways of love and romance.  In fact, there's not an unappealing performance from any member of the cast.  And perhaps because the characters are of a somewhat more advanced age here, Mottola never lets the teen-movie hijinks get out of hand despite many opportunities to do so.Thanks to the movie's being set in 1987, the soundtrack provides a veritable treasure-trove of great, nostalgia-evoking tunes from that era (the highlight being Crowded House's incomparable ""Don't Dream It's Over"") to transport us back in time.Badly marketed at the time of its release (the ads made it look like just another lame-brained, teen-raunch fest), ""Adventureland"" is a sweet, perceptive and heartwarming film that proves there's quite a bit of life left in that creaky old coming-of-age genre after all.",4,richly observed coming-of-age tale,1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,2626,"['graduating', 'college', 'James', 'Brennan', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'degree', 'Comparative', 'Literature', 'Renaissance', 'Studies', 'little', 'else', 'stuff', 'build', 'successful', 'life', 'Forced', 'financial', 'constraints', 'move', 'back', 'parents', 'James', 'summer', 'job', 'carny', 'seedy', 'amusement', 'park', 'known', 'Adventureland', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Pittsburgh', 's', 'Kennywood', 'Park', 'fellow', 'sufferers-in-purgatory', 'include', 'even', 'more', 'geeky', 'friend', 'Joel', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'tormentor', 'elementary', 'school', 'Frigo', 'Matt', 'Bush', 'elusive', 'girl-of-his-dreams', 'Emily', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'security', 'manager', 'Mike', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'though', 'married', 'got', 'secret', 'thing', 'going', 'side', 'Emily', 'sexy', 'hot', 'bombshell', 'Lisa', 'P', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'finally', 'two', 'park', 'supervisors', 'played', 'SNL', 'regulars', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'function', 'add', 'understated', 'goofiness', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'gently', 'realistic', 'tone.Based', 'partly', 'experiences', 'writer/director', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'who', 'established', 'bona', 'fides', 'genre', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Superbad', 'Adventureland', 'one', 'rare', 'youth', 'comedies', 'characters', 'actually', 'come', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'contrivances', 'paying', 'script-service', 'typical', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'Mottola', 'flavorful', 'script', 'nicely', 'rhythms', 'tones', 'everyday', 'speech', 'fact', 'much', 'humor', 'fact', 'James', 'fresh', 'immersion', 'liberal', 'arts', 'academia', 'often', 'hard', 'time', 'reeling', 'Ivy', 'League', 'phrasing', 'diction', 'when', 'engaging', 'everyday', 'conversations', 'fellow', 'workers.As', 'James', 'perpetually', 'tongue-tied', '23-year-old', 'virgin', 'who', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'Eisenberg', 'perfectly', 'insecurity', 'awkwardness', 'young', 'man', 'utterly', 'inexperienced', 'ways', 'love', 'romance', 'fact', 'not', 'unappealing', 'performance', 'member', 'cast', 'perhaps', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'more', 'advanced', 'age', 'here', 'Mottola', 'never', 'teen-movie', 'hijinks', 'get', 'hand', 'many', 'opportunities', 'do', 'so.Thanks', 'movie', 'being', 'set', '1987', 'soundtrack', 'veritable', 'treasure-trove', 'great', 'nostalgia-evoking', 'tunes', 'era', 'highlight', 'being', 'Crowded', 'House', 'incomparable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Dream', 'Over', 'transport', 'back', 'time.Badly', 'marketed', 'time', 'release', 'ads', 'made', 'look', 'just', 'lame-brained', 'teen-raunch', 'fest', 'Adventureland', 'sweet', 'perceptive', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'life', 'left', 'creaky', 'old', 'coming-of-age', 'genre']",N/A

1259632,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B002BFBAUG,Scott Schiefelbein,"[10, 11]","Director Greg Mottola famously worked at a run-down amusement park in his younger years, and that transformative experience serves ""Adventureland"" well.  This flick goes for a quieter, deeper humor than Mottola's smash hit ""Superbad,"" but it is no less endearing.It's somewhere in the later '80s, and James (Jesse Eisenberg) is a smart guy cursed with a) a liberal arts degree, b) parents who are unexpectedly financially strapped, and c) who lives in Pittsburgh.  (By the way - is it eerie or cool that Eisenberg stars in two movies with similar one-word titles, ""Adventureland"" and ""Zombieland,"" that are based in theme parks where he plays the Michael Cera role?)  To raise the cash to go to Columbia journalism school, James gets stuck with a terrible summer job at Adventureland - a place that puts the ""lack"" in lackluster.The theme park is populated with a range of supporting characters that is as solid and pleasing as any ensemble has a right to be.  One of the problems with these sorts of films is that the supporting characters tend to be one-note archetypes.  That's definitely not the case here - the supporting cast is surprisingly original and defies expectations.Take the park bombshell Lisa P. (Margaria Levieva).  We first see her in one of those Sexy Slow Walks through Adventureland as all the guys stop to watch her lick a Sno-Cone.  Every guy's first reaction is, ""I hope this is the actress who agreed to do a bit of nudity.""  Instead of being either a) a simple sexpot or b) a stuck-up rhymes-with-with coasting on her beauty, Lisa P. actually turns out to be cool-but-flawed - she even asks James his thoughts about God during a good pot-smoking session.  This is a real girl who just happens to be gorgeous - it's this kind of attention to detail that makes ""Adventureland"" a pleasure.Much of the movie focuses on James trying to act on his obvious chemistry with Em (Kristen Stewart, ""Twilight"" saga).  James and Em are seriously into each other, but are kept apart by a variety of neuroses and conflicts.  In a lesser film, these two would be kept apart by silly misunderstandings that could be cleared up with a simple five-minute conversation - here, there are darker and deeper issues in play.  Whether these issues will be resolved takes time, and as a result we care about these two.For those of us looking for a raunchy ""Superbad 2,"" ""Adventureland"" does not fit the bill.  Even though this is a funny movie, there are only a couple of laugh-out-loud moments.  For me, the funniest scene in the movie involves the park owners, Bobby and Paulette (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig), as they confront a violent park patron - watching Paulette nonchalantly hand Bobby a baseball bat so he can defend the park's honor before returning to the finances was a perfect snapshot of the lives of these two entrepreneurs.  And there is a shot-to-the-groin scene toward the end of the movie that I found as hilarious as Homer Simpson did when he watched Hans Moleman's film, ""Football in Groin.""For anyone who's worked a bad job with great coworkers, this movie's for you.",4,Indie-hip comedy goes for warm regard rather than screaming hysterics,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,3091,"['Director', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'famously', 'worked', 'run-down', 'amusement', 'park', 'younger', 'years', 'transformative', 'experience', 'Adventureland', 'well', 'flick', 'quieter', 'deeper', 'humor', 'Mottola', 'smash', 'hit', 'Superbad', 'less', 'endearing.It', 'somewhere', 'later', ""'80s"", 'James', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'smart', 'guy', 'cursed', 'liberal', 'arts', 'degree', 'b', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'unexpectedly', 'financially', 'strapped', 'c', 'who', 'Pittsburgh', 'way', 'cool', 'Eisenberg', 'stars', 'two', 'movies', 'similar', 'one-word', 'titles', 'Adventureland', 'Zombieland', 'are', 'based', 'theme', 'parks', 'where', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'role', 'raise', 'cash', 'go', 'Columbia', 'journalism', 'school', 'James', 'stuck', 'terrible', 'summer', 'job', 'Adventureland', 'place', 'lack', 'lackluster.The', 'theme', 'park', 'populated', 'range', 'supporting', 'characters', 'solid', 'pleasing', 'ensemble', 'right', 'be', 'One', 'problems', 'sorts', 'films', 'supporting', 'characters', 'tend', 'be', 'one-note', 'archetypes', 'definitely', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'supporting', 'cast', 'surprisingly', 'original', 'defies', 'expectations.Take', 'park', 'bombshell', 'Lisa', 'P.', 'Margaria', 'Levieva', 'first', 'see', 'one', 'Sexy', 'Slow', 'Walks', 'Adventureland', 'guys', 'stop', 'watch', 'lick', 'Sno-Cone', 'Every', 'guy', 'first', 'reaction', 'hope', 'actress', 'who', 'agreed', 'do', 'bit', 'nudity', 'Instead', 'being', 'simple', 'sexpot', 'b', 'stuck-up', 'rhymes-with-with', 'coasting', 'beauty', 'Lisa', 'P.', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'cool-but-flawed', 'even', 'James', 'thoughts', 'God', 'good', 'pot-smoking', 'session', 'real', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'gorgeous', 'kind', 'attention', 'detail', 'Adventureland', 'pleasure.Much', 'movie', 'James', 'trying', 'act', 'obvious', 'chemistry', 'Em', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Twilight', 'saga', 'James', 'Em', 'are', 'seriously', 'other', 'are', 'kept', 'apart', 'variety', 'neuroses', 'conflicts', 'lesser', 'film', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'kept', 'apart', 'silly', 'misunderstandings', 'could', 'be', 'cleared', 'up', 'simple', 'five-minute', 'conversation', 'here', 'are', 'darker', 'deeper', 'issues', 'play', 'issues', 'will', 'be', 'resolved', 'time', 'result', 'care', 'two.For', 'looking', 'raunchy', 'Superbad', '2', 'Adventureland', 'not', 'fit', 'bill', 'Even', 'funny', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'funniest', 'scene', 'movie', 'park', 'owners', 'Bobby', 'Paulette', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'confront', 'violent', 'park', 'patron', 'watching', 'Paulette', 'nonchalantly', 'hand', 'Bobby', 'baseball', 'bat', 'can', 'defend', 'park', 'honor', 'returning', 'finances', 'was', 'perfect', 'snapshot', 'lives', 'two', 'entrepreneurs', 'shot-to-the-groin', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'found', 'as', 'hilarious', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'did', 'when', 'watched', 'Hans', 'Moleman', 'film', 'Football', 'Groin', 'anyone', 'who', 'worked', 'bad', 'job', 'great', 'coworkers', 'movie']",N/A

I'd already done the same thing with Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson so I wanted to give her a shot.The Runawayswas too boring for me to finish and when I started this film I was thinking the same thing: ""Does she ever play a character that doesn't look like her during interviews? Is she even acting or is she always this nervous and squirrel-ish? This seems like the exact same person, just with new actors surrounding her."" While the verdict is still out on whether she can play roles unlike herself (this character may as well have been Bella), I really liked her in this film. She was a little more complex--in a weird relationship with the guy who played Mark Zuckerberg fromThe Social Network--Jesse Eisenberg, another actor who always seems like he wants to run screaming from the camera; and she was boning a married man who lied about his background with a famous band.But it wasn't just their situation. I get into teenage/college age films. I'm always interested in the things that are considered ""huge"" at that age, and this amusement park was full of drama. The amusement park owners crack me up. The male owner with the bat was priceless. Talk about multiple personalities! I did not see that one coming.Anyway, this film is worth buying. The only con was painfully watching the ""hot"" girls dance. All they did was twirl around and show flat bottoms (again, like watching ""Live Nude Comedy,"" somebody needed to invest in butt pads).

These plans are dashed when his parents (Wendy Malick, Jack Gilpin) inform him that his father was recently demoted and they no longer can afford to pay for the European trip. In addition, to help pay for grad school, he'll have to get a summer job in his home town of Pittsburgh.Rebuffed by several potential employers because of his lack of experience, James finally gets a job at a local amusement park, Adventureland, operated by Paulette and Bobby (Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader).  Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds) is the park's maintenance man, a bit older than the college age employees, and rumored to have rubbed shoulders with show biz types.Though marketed as a wild and freewheeling teen comedy, ""Adventureland is actually a drama.  Sure, it has its funny moments, some based on the antics of ""Saturday Night Live"" veterans Wiig and Hader, others based on romantic awkwardness and James' journey from child to young adult.  Eisenberg has an endearing, puppy-dog screen persona that works perfectly here.  We immediately sympathize with him when his plans are suddenly thrown into turmoil, and are impressed at his ability to accept a bad break and make the best of a tough situation.Kristen Stewart (""Twilight"") plays James' love interest and Martin Starr (""Knocked Up"") is the wisecracking nerd.

1259647,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002BFBAUG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","""Adventureland"", the new film from writer-director Greg Mottola (""Superbad"") is a pretty good film. A coming of age story set in the late 80s, Mottola weaves a realistic story about recent college grads who are trying to earn some money and have some fun over the summer. The film is surprisingly intimate, and reflective and I would have to guess it is based on Mottola's own experiences. But it isn't that funny and proves to be another example of a bad marketing campaign promising one thing when the film is made to deliver something else. This may eke out a few dollars for the studio, but it will probably back fire and cause the film to lose more prospective viewers than it might gain.James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg, ""Noah and the Whale"") graduates from college and tries to eke out a couple of hundred additional dollars from his parents; they have already promised to pay for a graduation trip to Europe, before he goes to grad school, and he and his friend want to extend the trip a little, so he needs more money. But his parents (Wendy Malick, Jack Gilpin) have some bad news; Dad is being transferred and will make less money. They can't afford to send James to Europe and grad school is doubtful as well. James tries to find a job, any job, but can only get hired at Adventureland, a run down theme park run by Bobby (Bill Hader) and Paulette (Kristen Wiig, both of TV's ""Saturday Night Live""). James is thrust into a job running Games, despite his desire to join the more interesting and cooler group of kids running the Rides. On his first day, he meets Em (Kristen Stewart, ""Twilight"") and he seems surprised that she is actually responding to his goofy flirtations and sensibility. And Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds), the head of maintenance, walks through the park with the approving eye of the girls and the awe of the boys.Jesse Eisenberg is near perfect as James, the nervous kid who is getting closer to being on his own, making his own way through the world. He is still a kid, despite graduating from college, and is disappointed and shocked to learn he won't be able to join his best friend on their planned European tour. He is a smart kid, the type of kid who uses these smarts at inopportune times, inadvertently making others look stupid, which gets him into some trouble. He is also unsure of himself and seems to be shocked every time a girl even gives him the time of day. When he and Em start to hang out together, he is delighted but also more nervous because she really seems to like him.Eisenberg has primarily played high school kids, so it is nice to see him playing a college graduate, however immature. It works to his favor that I kept thinking he was in high school, because James is not very mature despite his education. When Em invites him to a party, she coyly asks him if he wants to go swimming. She proceeds to strip and jumps in the pool. He is game and strips down to his underwear before jumping in. After a few minutes, she wants to get out and dry off. He has to wait a few minutes, before getting out of the pool. It is a nice, touching, very human moment.Kristen Stewart is also very good as the unpredictable Em. Already very confused, she meets James and they become friends, flirting consistently. She really likes him and they go out on a date or two. But she has other influences in her life, influences that are hard to kick or hard to correct. Throughout, you can see little glimmers of hope in her eyes. Maybe my life can become less dramatic, less plagued by trouble. But one of these influences is very familiar, and easy, despite the consequences, so she keeps finding her way back to this.And because these kids are young, and aren't paying rent or mortgages, if anything gets too heavy, they simply face the problem by announcing ""I quit"" and run off to be by themselves. When the problems follow them home, they realize the solution isn't that simple.Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig provide some whacked out laughs as the couple who are ""in charge"" of the theme park. Bobby immediately runs to the rescue of any of his employees, fending off bullies with a baseball bat and a psycho attitude. Paulette stands on the sidelines, admiring Bobby when he is called into action to run one of the games, remembering back to why she fell in love with him in the first place. Despite their relative young age, you get the feeling they have been in this business for a long time and they have the answers to every situation.Ryan Reynolds plays Mike, an older guy who performs maintenance throughout the park. As he struts through the grounds, everyone seems to regard him in awe. His age and his status as a struggling musician make him cool to both the boys and girls. The guys want to be him; the girls want to be with him.There are a number of other memorable kids who work at the park and intersect with James and Em.But ""Adventureland"" is not a comedy, not really. There are some funny moments, but these are more observational moments. And they are few and far between. It seems misleading to advertise the film as a comedy, but this genre is easier to sell and will probably generate more ticket sales. But as word spreads, how will people deal with the fact that the film is a drama? A good drama? It seems like this practice would alienate people. People looking for a comedy will probably be disappointed. People, who want to see a good drama, won't realize they have a potential film under their nose. It just seems like a lose-lose situation. Why Miramax? Why?""Adventureland"" may seem a bit like a retread, but it is actually fairly unique. Most coming of age stories deal with high schoolers, kids either in high school, soon to graduate or graduating. This film depicts kids who are a little older, college graduates, but they still don't have everything figured out. As we watch them deal with the problems they experience, we identify with them. Most of us didn't have everything figured out when we graduated college (and many still don't) so the story of these kids speaks to us in a way.Written and directed by Greg Mottola, the film is based on his own experiences in the same situation. I am sure much of what happens to James probably happened to him, in some form. And because so much of the story comes from a personal place, all of the characters seem more real, more interesting. From the nervous energy surrounding James, to the laid back attitude we see in Em, to the cool vibe coming from Mike, we have seen these types of characters before, but Mottola gives each a new level of detail, bringing them more sharply into focus.""Adventureland"" is a good, interesting coming of age film.

1259648,A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,B002BFBAUG,Todd Bartholomew,"[0, 0]","""Adventureland"" is a mildly sweet comedy-drama in the ""coming of age"" genre of films written and produced by Greg Mottola (the director of ""Superbad"") and based on his own experiences working at an amusement park in the late 1980s.  The film is set in the same era, giving it a somewhat timeless feel and tone that makes it look and feel as though it were made in that same era.  The storyline of diminished expectations, coming to terms with post-collegiate life, and the evolution and changing nature of friendships are similarly universal and timeless.  The story follows James Brennan (wonderfully underplayed by Jesse Eisenberg), a college grad whose life is rapidly changing.  His girlfriend breaks up with him and he returns home with hopes of touring Europe followed by Grad school only to discover his parents can't pay for either due to a change in economic circumstances.  James moves in with his parents and realizes his only ticket to grad school is a summer job, but his comparative lit degree leaves his employment options limited.  Desperate, he takes a job at the Adventureland amusement park, the latest in a series of blows to his psyche.Most of the film revolves around the odd cast of characters James encounters while working at Adventureland.  They become his new cohort of friends and a romance slowly blossoms between James and Emily (Kristen Stewart).  But all isn't as it seems as Emily is also involved with the worldly and mysterious Connell (played to perfection by Ryan Reynolds).  The triangle plays out against the other relationships in this tight circle of friends over the summer.  They bicker, they fight, they drink, and they misunderstand.  I'm boiling the plot down a lot here as it does get quite involved and I certainly don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. As summer comes to a close there's the question of who Emily will stay with: the flawed and possibly unavailable Connell or James, who is leaving for New York City and grad school.  The ending may seem formulaic but it's hardly clich&eacute;d and will leave you happy and satisfied.Ads for ""Adventureland"" touted it as coming from the director of ""Superbad"" but that's about where the comparisons end.  There is certainly raunchy humor, vulgarity, and adult humor, but not to the level of ""Superbad.""  The music is period perfect too mixing in 80s groups like Husker Du, the Replacement's and Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus"" (used to hilarious effect).  There's a certain wistfulness to the movie that borders on nostalgic poignancy for a simpler time that has passed away and in a real sense it's easier to set a movie like this in the recent past rather than our disconnected present.  People working dead end summer jobs of today likely don't connect like this group does.  ""Adventureland"" was sadly overlooked while out in theaters but it is certainly worth a second look.  While not the most memorable film its oddly affecting plot and great cast is certainly enjoyable.",4,"An oddly sweet and affecting ""coming of age"" movie",1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,2986,"['Adventureland', 'mildly', 'sweet', 'comedy-drama', 'coming', 'age', 'genre', 'films', 'written', 'produced', 'Greg', 'Mottola', 'director', 'Superbad', 'based', 'own', 'experiences', 'working', 'amusement', 'park', 'late', '1980s', 'film', 'set', 'same', 'era', 'giving', 'somewhat', 'timeless', 'feel', 'tone', 'look', 'feel', 'were', 'made', 'same', 'era', 'storyline', 'diminished', 'expectations', 'coming', 'terms', 'post-collegiate', 'life', 'evolution', 'changing', 'nature', 'friendships', 'are', 'similarly', 'universal', 'timeless', 'story', 'James', 'Brennan', 'wonderfully', 'underplayed', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'college', 'grad', 'life', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'girlfriend', 'up', 'home', 'hopes', 'touring', 'Europe', 'followed', 'Grad', 'school', 'only', 'discover', 'parents', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'due', 'change', 'economic', 'circumstances', 'James', 'parents', 'realizes', 'only', 'ticket', 'grad', 'school', 'summer', 'job', 'comparative', 'lit', 'degree', 'employment', 'options', 'limited', 'Desperate', 'job', 'Adventureland', 'amusement', 'park', 'latest', 'series', 'blows', 'psyche.Most', 'film', 'odd', 'cast', 'characters', 'James', 'encounters', 'working', 'Adventureland', 'become', 'new', 'cohort', 'friends', 'romance', 'slowly', 'blossoms', 'James', 'Emily', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', ""n't"", 'Emily', 'also', 'involved', 'worldly', 'mysterious', 'Connell', 'played', 'perfection', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'triangle', 'out', 'other', 'relationships', 'tight', 'circle', 'friends', 'summer', 'bicker', 'fight', 'drink', 'misunderstand', ""'m"", 'boiling', 'plot', 'down', 'lot', 'here', 'get', 'quite', 'involved', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'summer', 'close', 'question', 'who', 'Emily', 'will', 'stay', 'flawed', 'possibly', 'unavailable', 'Connell', 'James', 'who', 'leaving', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'grad', 'school', 'ending', 'may', 'seem', 'formulaic', 'hardly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'will', 'leave', 'happy', 'satisfied.Ads', 'Adventureland', 'touted', 'coming', 'director', 'Superbad', 'where', 'comparisons', 'end', 'certainly', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'vulgarity', 'adult', 'humor', 'not', 'level', 'Superbad', 'music', 'period', 'perfect', 'too', 'mixing', '80s', 'groups', 'Husker', 'Du', 'Replacement', 'Falco', 'Rock', 'Me', 'Amadeus', 'used', 'hilarious', 'effect', 'certain', 'wistfulness', 'movie', 'borders', 'nostalgic', 'poignancy', 'simpler', 'time', 'passed', 'away', 'real', 'sense', 'easier', 'set', 'movie', 'recent', 'past', 'rather', 'disconnected', 'present', 'People', 'working', 'dead', 'end', 'summer', 'jobs', 'today', 'likely', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'group', 'Adventureland', 'was', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'out', 'theaters', 'certainly', 'worth', 'second', 'look', 'not', 'most', 'memorable', 'film', 'oddly', 'affecting', 'plot', 'great', 'cast', 'certainly', 'enjoyable']",N/A

1259651,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002BFBAUG,Turfseer,"[1, 3]","Adventureland' is a coming-of-age story set in suburban Pittsburgh circa 1987. Loosely based on recollections of writer-director Greg Mottola (who's well known for directing the entertaining adolescent comedy, 'Superbad'), it is more drama than comedy. Mottola jettisons the raunchiness we've come to expect from the typical teenage fare that pops up in the cinema today for a more intellectual and informed dissection of adolescent (or shall we say post-adolescent) vagaries.The setting of Adventureland is a run down amusement park run by a goofy thirtyish couple who'll do anything to make a buck (people trying to win a prize by knocking a hat off a mannequin with a softball are unable to do so since the hats are glued to the mannequins' heads). The proprietors also save money by hiring high school and college students at minimum wage as they're unable to find a job anywhere else due to the faltering economy (Reagnomics doesn't appear to be working very well at that time). One of these young people is the film's protagonist, James Brennan, well played by Jesse Eisenberg. James was about to take a trip to Europe for the summer before going off to graduate school but after his father receives a demotion at work, his parents force him to find a job instead.Mottola does an excellent job of depicting the atmosphere at the ramshackle park. From the outset, James is advised by his co-workers to attempt to obtain a job as a ride operator as opposed to working the game booths (there is a clear cut hierarchy, and working the 'rides' is much more preferable to the booths where the workers are often forced to deal with unsavory characters who often cheat while attempting to win a prize). James also has to endure the constant blaring of 'Rock Me Amadeus', the Falco hit from the 80s, over the park's loudspeakers.What keeps Adventureland from becoming just another sitcom is the excellent interplay between the two witty friends, James and his sidekick, Joel, smartly played by the talented Martin Starr. Both these young men are bonded by their reliance on their intellect to compensate for their lack of success with the opposite sex. There are a good number of welcome literary allusions in Adventureland including discussions of such prominent authors as Dickens and Gogol.Adventureland's other characters, however, are not as strong as its two principals. For starters, Kristen Stewart's 'Em' is not convincing as the troubled recent graduate who's going out with an 'older man'. The film's scenarist attempts to explain her confusion due to the influence of a petulant stepmother who comes across as an unsympathetic stereotype. Em has few moments where she seems to like herself at all. Ryan Reynold's 'Mike Connell' could have been an interesting character as the amusement park's mechanic and married man Em is having an affair with, but he has little on screen time and comes across as being a little too sympathetic for someone who is cheating on his wife (it would have been nice if he had a bit more of an 'edge' as well as more of detailed back story).Other characters also are underdeveloped--the sexy ""Lisa P."" gets short shrift after her main claim to fame is gossiping about Mike and Em's affair, betraying the confidence she established with James. Joel's potential girlfriend is another petulant one-dimensional character who rejects him after she experiences pressure from her strict Catholic family. I did like Hader and Wiig as the amusement park owners who provide the film with its main comic relief.What I couldn't buy at all was the idea that Em would be attracted to James (along with Lisa P. who is portrayed as being able to get any guy she wants). James is simply too immature and a 'nice guy' for a woman like Em (who has just had an affair with the super-attractive, 'bad boy' mechanic) to be attracted to. So it's a real stretch when James comes to New York and Em is basically waiting for him with open arms. The old axiom 'nice guys finish last' holds true for all potential male suitors but Adventureland opts for the sentimental ending which rejects the reality of contemporary courtship patterns.For all its deficiencies, Adventureland still manages to entertain, with its witty dialogue and top notch performance by Jesse Eisenberg who strikes the right notes as the beleaguered post-adolescent taking his first steps toward prescient adulthood.",3,Entertaining but flawed 80s Coming of Age Dramedy,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,4398,"['Adventureland', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'set', 'suburban',

That is until Brennan&#8217;s father had a career setback causing them to have no money.  Now Brennan must find a job to cover his upcoming expenses by working at a local amusing park, Adventureland.  As he is adjusting to the amusement park life, Brennan starts to fall for his coworker, Emily Lewin (Kristen Stewart).  The young carnies start to have some learning experiences about love, life and trust.  In addition, Brennan starts to his true values.I really enjoyed the storyline of this movie.  Adventureland was an independent film made by This Is That Productions that Miramax films picked up.  In this independent film it focuses on more of a darker realistic issue than the portrayal of a hero or villain based movie.  In the movie, Brennan has a bachelor&#8217;s degree with no work experience that is causing him to settle for a job at an amusement park.  Ultimately throughout the movie he is learning about himself and his true values after hitting some dark times.The acting ability in this movie was impressive.  Kristen Stewart plays the same role as she does in every movie.  She seems to be this awkward girl who lacks acting ability.  However her acting fits perfectly this role, and Jesse Eisenberg did a great job as well.  I think Kristen and Jesse are a great match for acting together.This movie has a little of everything in it (romance, comedy, action, etc.) and I recommend it for anyone looking for a good Netflix movie.&#8220;Shaken, Not Stirred&#8221; Rating: 6.8/10For more reviews go to Bond's Movie Reviews on Facebook",3,Great Independent Movie,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,1707,"['James', 'Brennan', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'just', 'graduated', 'college', 'get', 'ready', 'dream', 'vacation', 'Europe', 'studying', 'Ivy', 'League', 'school', 'Brennan', '8217', 's', 'father', 'had', 'career', 'setback', 'causing', 'have', 'money', 'Now', 'Brennan', 'must', 'find', 'job', 'cover', 'upcoming', 'expenses', 'working', 'local', 'amusing', 'park', 'Adventureland', 'adjusting', 'amusement', 'park', 'life', 'Brennan', 'fall', 'coworker', 'Emily', 'Lewin', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'young', 'carnies', 'start', 'have', 'learning', 'experiences', 'love', 'life', 'trust', 'addition', 'Brennan', 'true', 'values.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'storyline', 'movie', 'Adventureland', 'was', 'independent', 'film', 'made', 'Productions', 'Miramax', 'films', 'picked', 'up', 'independent', 'film', 'more', 'darker', 'realistic', 'issue', 'portrayal', 'hero', 'villain', 'based', 'movie', 'movie', 'Brennan', 'bachelor', '8217', 'degree', 'work', 'experience', 'causing', 'settle', 'job', 'amusement', 'park', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'learning', 'true', 'values', 'hitting', 'dark', 'times.The', 'acting', 'ability', 'movie', 'was', 'impressive', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'same', 'role', 'movie', 'be', 'awkward', 'girl', 'who', 'acting', 'ability', 'However', 'acting', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'Kristen', 'Jesse', 'are', 'great', 'match', 'acting', 'together.This', 'movie', 'little', 'everything', 'romance', 'comedy', 'action', 'etc', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'good', 'Netflix', 'movie.', '8220', 'Shaken', 'Not', 'Stirred', '8221', 'Rating', '6.8/10For', 'more', 'reviews', 'go', 'Bond', 'Movie', 'Reviews', 'Facebook']",N/A

1259654,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B002BFBAUG,Wheelchair Assassin,"[3, 4]","It's a rare movie that mixes references to literary and philosophical favorites like Trotsky, Gogol and Melville with repeated punches to the crotch of its protagonist, but these opposing poles manage to mark ""Adventureland"" as an ideal comedy for the more intellectually inclined viewers out there.  Taking viewers all the way back to 1987, writer-director Greg Mottola's semi-autobiographical comedy doesn't exactly boast a great deal of narrative drive, but its relaxed pace is perfectly suited to its highly personal storytelling.  It would be a mistake to describe the movie's overall tone as nostalgic, but it does provide a wistful and relatable take on the period in life when aspirations tend to collide with reality, along with the expected (yet still amusing) nods to 80's style and pop culture.  The formula is somewhat similar to that used in Mottola's previous effort, ""Superbad""--barrages of profanity, sex jokes, and youthful debauchery mixed with occasional doses of sentiment and self-realization--although this time out the balance is tilted noticeably more toward the latter elements.  Where many mainstream comedies seem desparate to get a laugh out of their audience, ""Adventureland"" is content to let the humor rise naturally from the interactions of the characters and smartly-written dialogue loaded with sarcasm, intellectual references, and big words.""Adventureland"" centers around the plight of James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg), a sensitive recent college graduate who's just found out that his parents' finances won't accomodate either his planned trip to Europe or his graduate-school goals. James is marked early on as the type of idealistic dreamer who allows himself to fall for a girl he's been dating for a week and a half, reads poetry for pleasure, and aspires to write Dickens-styled travelogues exposing the state of the world around him (on a personal note, as something of an overeducated, underemployed pseudo-intellectual type myself, I was certainly able to empathize with James's situation as he tries to find his way in a world that has little use for his extensive knowledge of comparative literature and Renaissance studies).  Since James's education didn't provide him with too many marketable skils--he laments early on that he's even unqualified for manual labor--he's forced to take a decidedly menial position working the game stations at Adventureland, a dreary amusement park in suburban Pittsburgh run by an overly enthusiastic husband-and-wife team (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who bring their usual hilarity to relatively minor roles).  At the park, James finds himself surrounded mainly by a pack of doomed souls with little or no prospects, chiefly focused on getting through the day so they can numb at least a little of their pain with booze, weed, and sex.Shortly after embarking on his job at Adventureland, James begins a tentative romance with his vaguely dark and troubled coworker Em (Kristen Stewart, aka the chick from the ""Twilight"" movies), who also happens to be carrying on a secret affair with Connell (Ryan Reynolds), a married wannabe musician making ends meet as the park's handyman.  Not surprisingly, some life lessons ensue, but they're laced with enough humor and a light enough touch to differentiate ""Adventureland"" from the mass of coming-of-age flicks out there.  It helps that the movie places an emphasis throughout on creating believable and multi-dimensional characters, as Mottola shows a clear affection (or at least sympathy) for most of the cast without idealizing them or minimizing their flaws.  Even Reynold's Connell, who routinely cheats on his wife and blatantly lies about his musical exploits, is presented less as a villain than as just another working stiff doing whatever he can to make his life tolerable. Likewise, James's Russian literature-loving friend Joel (Martin Starr) is portrayed as part endearing nerd and part aimless, pretentious slacker.Like most great comedies, ""Adventureland"" succeeds because it gets the little things right, perfectly capturing both the myriad tiny indignities that come with dead-end service-industry jobs and the attempts that people in them make to transcend their seemingly dire circumstances.  The minimalistic, occasionally haunting score by Yo La Tengo is nicely complemented by a selection of period music both great (the Replacements make a couple of appearances, including a memorable use of ""Bastards of Young"" in the opening scene) and not so great (the constant playings of Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus"" are used to further underscore the horrors faced by the park employees).  ""Adventureland"" definitely isn't the most ambitious movie ever made, but it draws viewers into its characters and their little world so well that it doesn't have to be.  Those familiar with the work of Judd Apatow and his collaborators (several of whom show up in supporting roles) would be well-served to check this movie out.",4,An adventure worth
