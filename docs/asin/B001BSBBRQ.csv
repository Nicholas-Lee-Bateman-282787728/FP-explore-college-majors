1173240,A3MEH37R79AD2S,B001BSBBRQ,"Karl Anderson ""Global Recording Artists""","[6, 6]","I love John Wayne but normally the b-movies he made in the 30's are in such bad condition they are almost not watchable except for the most hard core fan. Legend did a wonderful job on cleaning up the sound and video on these classics. Each volume shows the movie in color and you also get the restored B&W Version. I must admit that I enjoyed watching them in color for the first time. The restored B&W version look really good too. They did some new editing of  the films to make the flow better and added a sound track to them. I personally found the sound track and tightening up on the edits to make a big difference. It is the first time I found these old movies to be easy, fun and enjoyable to watch. Great job legend I would like see you do it with more of these movies.",5,Amazing restoration on this 6 movie set.
