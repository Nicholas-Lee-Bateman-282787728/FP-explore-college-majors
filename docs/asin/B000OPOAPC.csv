The movie delivers good entertainment but doesn't quite reach its potential.At the center of the movie are businessman Harry Mitchell (Roy Scheider) and his wife Barbara (Ann Margaret) a politician.  Harry gets caught in an affair by a trio of nasty blackmailers.  When Harry decides to tough it out and not pay up, the blackmailers start raising the ante.  A trail of bodies leads right back to Harry and Barbara, who are trapped in a no-limits life or death poker match with the increasing ruthless blackmailers.  Harry can't go to the police; his one chance is to somehow outsmart his enemies before everyone and everything he cares about is destroyed.  The finish is a thriller with plenty of plot twists.The movie has some good performances, especially John Glover as a pornographer turned ruthless blackmailer.  It should certainly hold the viewer's attention, stepping through a series of sometimes frightening action scenes.  It did only so-so at the box office; more than a few viewers and critics thought it never quite came together.
