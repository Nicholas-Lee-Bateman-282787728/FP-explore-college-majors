In 1979, there were no special effects to be provided to movies and upon release the movie was mildly looked at as another Charles Bronson 'vigilante' takeoff or something like that. But a young Clint Eastwood gives us all a spectacular presentation of a Frank Morris we may think we know...but actually dont. Eastwood's sly tricks, showdown voice and optional tough-guy exterior lend themselves perfectly to the character of Frank Morris...the (alleged) brains behind the escape. The Anglin brothers featuring Fred Ward (who'd later shake us to our knees in 'Tremors') assist Morris in his ingenious and timely escape plan that proves impossible in today's prison system...where the only escape possible (except for Texas) is blending in with those who ARE allowed to be outside the walls. 'The Shawshank Redemption' in 1994 felt so familiar to all of us...and then we realize. The basic events and storyline, no matter how different the director tried to make it, are the same as those of 'Escape From Alcatraz'. With toung in cheek, 'The Shawshank Redemption' was an attempt to create a brand new story that was original in every way. However, the only reason you would watch it is for the tremendous acting, fantastic cast and excellent 'icing-like' story that covers up the basic 'Escape From Alcatraz' cake. It is in fact a terrific movie, but with no arguement that 1979's blockbuster Eastwood flick layed the ground and paved the way for modern actors to represent the story in their own way. 'Escape From Alcatraz' is an enticing movie, with very little dialogue and absolutely no down time. In other words you'll get to experience the time frame needed to make the escape and see the detailed plan itself...without any &quot;John!, Marsha!&quot; soap opera type nonsense. Paul Benjamin plays an incredible part as the middle-aged black man who has already devoted 10 years of his life as an Alcatraz inmate. His speech on the steps of the prison yard and his overall character are a great gift to the near end of his career..Id have to say its one of the best performances Ive ever seen in a movie and ceratinly a solid plus for 'Escape From Alcatraz'. Thanks for putting this movie on DVD!, and if you liked 'The Shawshank Redemption' you're gonna love the untaylored real life account of the three criminals who made history. If only the song 'Whos' Got the Last Laugh Now' was written today...it would have to include the escape from an 'escape-proof' prison.",4,The Spermacell Which Gave Birth to 'Shawshank Redemption',1022112000,"05 23, 2002",2002,2727,"['Ive', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'listened', 'people', 'interviewed', 'movie', 'were', 'former', 'wardens', 'correctional', 'officers', 'Alcatraz', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'one', 'movie', 'reality', 'grasp', 'notorious', '1962', 'prison', 'break', 'dead-on', 'hit', '1979', 'were', 'special', 'effects', 'be', 'provided', 'movies', 'release', 'movie', 'was', 'mildly', 'looked', 'Charles', 'Bronson', ""'vigilante"", 'takeoff', 'something', 'young', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'spectacular', 'presentation', 'Frank', 'Morris', 'may', 'think', 'know', 'actually', 'dont', 'Eastwood', 'sly', 'tricks', 'showdown', 'voice', 'optional', 'tough-guy', 'exterior', 'lend', 'perfectly', 'character', 'Frank', 'Morris', 'alleged', 'brains', 'escape', 'Anglin', 'brothers', 'featuring', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'who', ""'d"", 'later', 'shake', 'knees', ""'Tremors"", 'assist', 'Morris', 'ingenious', 'timely', 'escape', 'plan', 'impossible', 'today', 'prison', 'system', 'where', 'only', 'escape', 'possible', 'Texas', 'blending', 'who', 'ARE', 'allowed', 'be', 'walls', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', '1994', 'felt', 'so', 'familiar', 'then', 'realize', 'basic', 'events', 'storyline', 'matter', 'how', 'different', 'director', 'tried', 'make', 'are', 'same', ""'Escape"", 'Alcatraz', 'toung', 'cheek', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'was', 'attempt', 'create', 'brand', 'new', 'story', 'was', 'original', 'way', 'However', 'only', 'reason', 'would', 'watch', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'excellent', ""'icing-like"", 'story', 'up', 'basic', ""'Escape"", 'Alcatraz', 'cake', 'fact', 'terrific', 'movie', 'arguement', '1979', 'blockbuster', 'Eastwood', 'flick', 'layed', 'ground', 'paved', 'way', 'modern', 'actors', 'represent', 'story', 'own', 'way', ""'Escape"", 'Alcatraz', 'enticing', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'absolutely', 'down', 'time', 'other', 'words', ""'ll"", 'get', 'experience', 'time', 'frame', 'needed', 'make', 'escape', 'see', 'detailed', 'plan', 'quot', 'John', 'Marsha', 'quot', 'opera', 'type', 'nonsense', 'Paul', 'Benjamin', 'incredible', 'part', 'middle-aged', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'already', 'devoted', '10', 'years', 'life', 'Alcatraz', 'inmate', 'speech', 'steps', 'prison', 'yard', 'overall', 'character', 'are', 'great', 'gift', 'near', 'end', 'career..Id', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Ive', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'ceratinly', 'solid', 'plus', ""'Escape"", 'From', 'Alcatraz', 'Thanks', 'putting', 'movie', 'DVD', 'liked', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', ""'re"", 'gon', 'love', 'untaylored', 'real', 'life', 'account', 'three', 'criminals', 'who', 'made', 'history', 'only', 'song', 'Got', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'Now', 'was', 'written', 'today', 'would', 'have', 'include', 'escape', ""'escape-proof"", 'prison']",Escape from Alcatraz VHS
209458,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,6300213900,A Customer,"[4, 4]","Summary:Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood) is transferred to Alcatraz after having escaped from another, in what is made out to be, a long series of prisons.  He makes friends with some of the other inmates (Doc-Roberts Blossom; English-Paul Benjamin; Charley Butts-Larry Hankin; Litmus-Frank Ronzio) and has some friends from a previous prison join him (Clarence Anglin-Jack Thibeau; John Anglin-Fred Ward).  He also has to deal with an inmate that is out to get him (Wolf-Bruce M. Fischer) and a warden that is pretty rough on the inmates (Patrick McGoohan).  Together they plot their escape from Alcatraz and three of the four (Frank and the Anglin brothers get away, Charlie doesn't) in on the plan actually get away.My Comments:The movie is pretty similar to The Shawshank Redemption in a lot of ways.  But I wouldn't necessarily consider one better than the other.  The only problems I had with this movie is that we never really find out much about Frank other than he is a career criminal.  There is one line about his childhood, but he doesn't say much other than that it was 'short'.  It would have been interesting to know more about some of the other people involved.  However, this really doesn't affect the movie and should have been taken care of as special features on the DVD (it doesn't really have any).  Other than that and the movie being slow in a few spots, the movie was really great.Overall, the movie is remarkably well done and very convincing.  It is based on a true story and is a very enjoyable.

209459,A89MGH1RHEOQN,6300213900,Adam Paul Bailey,"[2, 2]","Escape from Alcatraz is one of my most favourite movies of all time and has to be one of the best true stories that ever made it to the screen as far as true crime goes. Yes, it was a true crime because they escaped from prison and that is a crime in itself. Eastwood is my favourite actor and has been since I was seven and I am now thirty one. His performance is one of the best here in this movie, he doesn't disappoint. There are some standout scenes in this movie-one is where the warden tells him no one has ever really made it on the outside after escaping from prison. They have either been caught or shot. The warden tells him no one has ever made it and no one ever will. When the warden tells Morris(Eastwood)that the look on his face looks like the warden has just issued him a challenge and Morris's face looks like as if to say, We'll see about that. Don't bet on it.Other standout parts in this movie for me are the following scenes:A prison guard tells Morris that he has a new job and that he will be paid fifteen cents an hour and Eastwood replies,""Well, I always knew crime would pay.""Another scene is a convict tells Eastwood he always wanted to see San Francisco but he thought it would be never like this-he had stolen a car from a prison guard and drove it across the state and wound up in AlacatraZ.Same convict asks Eastwood did he know how old he was and he said he didn't know and the convict says,""Jeez, what kind of childhood did you have?""Eastwood replies,""Short.""An actor I found interesting in this movie too was Fred Ward playing one of the Anglin brothers. The Anglins were caught trying to escape over a prison wall and sent to Alcatraz for Fifteen years. Ward asks himself, ""I wonder how i would be after fifteen years in this place?"" He never found out. He escaped with Morris.How these three escaped, Morris and the Anglin Brothers was a stroke of genius. I wonder if they would all be alive now if they made it since they would be in their seventies now probably.I recommend this movie a lot. I watched it three times in a row and I don't usually do that even with other great movies.",5,Eastwood's best movie!,1023753600,"06 11, 2002",2002,2123,"['Escape', 'Alcatraz', 'one', 'most', 'favourite', 'movies', 'time', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'true', 'stories', 'ever', 'made', 'screen', 'as', 'far', 'true', 'crime', 'Yes', 'was', 'true', 'crime', 'escaped', 'prison', 'crime', 'Eastwood', 'favourite', 'actor', 'been', 'was', 'seven', 'am', 'now', 'thirty', 'one', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'here', 'movie', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'are', 'standout', 'scenes', 'movie-one', 'where', 'warden', 'one', 'ever', 'really', 'made', 'outside', 'escaping', 'prison', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'shot', 'warden', 'tells', 'one', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'ever', 'will', 'When', 'warden', 'tells', 'Morris', 'Eastwood', 'look', 'face', 'warden', 'just', 'issued', 'challenge', 'Morris', 'face', 'say', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bet', 'it.Other', 'standout', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'following', 'scenes', 'prison', 'guard', 'Morris', 'new', 'job', 'will', 'be', 'paid', 'fifteen', 'cents', 'hour', 'Eastwood', 'replies', 'Well', 'always', 'knew', 'crime', 'would', 'pay', 'scene', 'convict', 'Eastwood', 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'San', 'Francisco', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'never', 'this-he', 'had', 'stolen', 'car', 'prison', 'guard', 'drove', 'state', 'wound', 'up', 'AlacatraZ.Same', 'convict', 'Eastwood', 'did', 'know', 'how', 'old', 'was', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'convict', 'Jeez', 'what', 'kind', 'childhood', 'did', 'have', 'Eastwood', 'replies', 'Short', 'actor', 'found', 'interesting', 'movie', 'too', 'was', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'playing', 'one', 'Anglin', 'brothers', 'Anglins', 'were', 'caught', 'trying', 'escape', 'prison', 'wall', 'sent', 'Alcatraz', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'Ward', 'wonder', 'how', 'i', 'would', 'be', 'fifteen', 'years', 'place', 'never', 'found', 'out', 'escaped', 'Morris.How', 'three', 'escaped', 'Morris', 'Anglin', 'Brothers', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'wonder', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'alive', 'now', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'seventies', 'now', 'probably.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'lot', 'watched', 'three', 'times', 'row', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'do', 'even', 'other', 'great', 'movies']",Escape from Alcatraz VHS

209464,A1GOI8745FGIDN,6300213900,"""an_avid_book_reviewer""","[0, 2]","As the movie opens, the man (Eastwood) is stripped of his clothes and dignity.  The warden tells him no one has ever escaped from Alcatraz and never will.  From the inmate's perspective, this statement lays down a challenge for him.  With amazing resourcefulness, brilliance, patience, and team-work, he and two others escape from what the movie portrays as a tyrannical, cruel jail.Some people say you can judge the state of a society by its jails.  If this is the case, according to this movie, society is inhospitable.  A man showed a flower, which he painted a picture of himself holding, which to him symbolizes what freedom the jail can't take away.  Painting is the only thing this man has to occupy his mind and the warden takes it away from him.  The man goes crazy and chops off his fingers in the woodshop. It isn't known where he got the flower from but the escapees leave it on the shore the night they escape.  The warden crushes it in his hand, vowing to find the drowned bodies in the water...I think the movie portrays the escape as a hard-earned act of justice; the unlikely triumph of men desperately trying to survive in a cruel place (or cruel world, as the viewer may see fit). This movie is comparable to ""The Shawshank Redemption"" which I also recommend.  The same actor portrayed the warden in each movie.  I think both movies downplay the criminality of the inmates and instead portray them as the victims and their captors as guilty of cruelty.  Both involve successful jail escapes except that Escape from Alcatraz involves a much simpler plot and in the Redemption, there is a more powerful reversal after the escape.",3,Engaging true story of men's struggle in a harsh world.,997401600,"08 10, 2001",2001,1646,"['movie', 'man', 'Eastwood', 'stripped', 'clothes', 'dignity', 'warden', 'tells', 'one', 'ever', 'escaped', 'Alcatraz', 'never', 'will', 'inmate', 'perspective', 'statement', 'down', 'challenge', 'amazing', 'resourcefulness', 'brilliance', 'patience', 'team-work', 'two', 'others', 'escape', 'what', 'movie', 'tyrannical', 'cruel', 'jail.Some', 'people', 'say', 'can', 'judge', 'state', 'society', 'jails', 'case', 'according', 'movie', 'society', 'inhospitable', 'man', 'showed', 'flower', 'painted', 'picture', 'holding', 'symbolizes', 'what', 'freedom', 'jail', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'Painting', 'only', 'thing', 'man', 'occupy', 'mind', 'warden', 'away', 'man', 'crazy', 'fingers', 'woodshop', ""n't"", 'known', 'where', 'got', 'flower', 'escapees', 'leave', 'shore', 'night', 'escape', 'warden', 'crushes', 'hand', 'vowing', 'find', 'drowned', 'bodies', 'water', 'think', 'movie', 'escape', 'hard-earned', 'act', 'justice', 'unlikely', 'triumph', 'men', 'desperately', 'trying', 'survive', 'cruel', 'place', 'cruel', 'world', 'viewer', 'may', 'see', 'fit', 'movie', 'comparable', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'also', 'recommend', 'same', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'warden', 'movie', 'think', 'movies', 'downplay', 'criminality', 'inmates', 'instead', 'portray', 'victims', 'captors', 'guilty', 'cruelty', 'involve', 'successful', 'jail', 'escapes', 'Escape', 'Alcatraz', 'much', 'simpler', 'plot', 'Redemption', 'more', 'powerful', 'reversal', 'escape']",Escape from Alcatraz VHS

209467,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6300213900,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 5]","This is pretty much a pretty agreed upon film by fans and critics alike. Director Don Siegel delivered one of the finest prison films, and told it like it is. Not a content film?. Please. Fan-worthy only?. Nope. This is the real deal. It's based upon a strue story of three inmates, and the greatest escape put together on the island prison known as Alcatraz. The one and only Clint Eastwood stars as real life convict Frank Morris, a life long criminal who was shipped to Alcatraz on a rainy night on January 20, 1960. Morris' crimes began at a very young age, but by the time he became a young adult, he was involved with narcotics possession and robbery. Because of his widely know intelligence, and his penchant for amazing escapes elsewhere, he is sent to the rock. There, he butts heads with the steely cool warden, played marvelously by Patrick McGoohan, who you will remember from the old TV show, ""The Prisoner"". Morris' plan of escape sets into motion when he meets fellow convicts, the Anglin brothers, John and Clarence. One of whom played by a then unknown Fred Ward. Through working in the prison and creating such helpful escape concoctions they made like rafts, and rubber boats, the plan was in motion. The biggest creation they made were life like dummies of their heads, to sit in their beds to fool their guards. The Anglin brothers even named their own dummy heads. They named them Oink and Oscar. If you don't know the story, or the whole thing, saying anything more like how they got out and what the result of their ingenious escape was, would be saying too much. I'll let you watch and find out yourselves. The movie has the right feel of a prison. Actually filming on location at the famed prison certainly didn't hurt either. That's one of the best things here that adds to the movie's truthful story and it's authenticity. Eastwood is one of cinema's best film idols, and this is definitley one of his best roles among many. He doesn't portray Frank Morris as a character on a page in a Hollywood film script, but fully imbues the role with realism and humanity. McGoohan is equally good as the warden, and the scenes and chemistry between the two are as engaging and interesting as anything else. The movie may be slow and uneventful for some, but anyone with an attention span and appreciation for a fine film faithfully re-telling a true story, you will see just how addictive this film really is. The tours they have at Alcatraz include seeing just where and how the three got out of their cells. Of course, their cells are marked and shown, and there are pictures of the dummy heads.

""Daniel""","[3, 14]","Since MADIGAN and ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ, two movies directed by Donald Siegel, have been presented these last months in the DVD standard, it would be a good occasion to rediscover this director who gave us such  masterpieces as INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and THE KILLERS.The plot  of ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ isn't the most original story on the subject but  contains a certain number of interesting ideas. Firstly, Richard Tuggle,  the screenwriter, and Donald Siegel have chosen to compare Alcatraz to a  zoo and the prisoners to animals trying to escape from their cages. The  leader of the coloured prisoners compares himself to the king of the apes  and the only newspapers permitted in Alcatraz are of the wildlife  documentary kind.So you will be amazed by the number of animals a prison  like Alcatraz can hide in his walls : mouses, cockroaches, rats and birds.  They're all here, in front of Siegel's camera, to make us understand the  condition of the prisoners. OK, it's a little bit heavy, symbolically  speaking, but unusual in this kind of movie.Since the prisoners are  constantly observed, the only way to escape from this prison is to be  present and away in the same time. How ? by imitating the reality with  walls in paper patiently built during the night or by putting mannequins  under their blankets. Another way to escape from Alcatraz is to become mad  .

Outside of the typical sadistic warden (yet Patrick McGoohan makes a most interesting and believable villain), this film concentrates more on the logistics of breaking out of ""The Rock""--the formidable federal prison Alcatraz, isolated on its own island in the icy waters of San Francisco Bay.  Based on a true story, Clint Eastwood plays calm, level-headed Frank Morris, a prisoner on a mission to be the first to escape.While conditions inside the prison are stark, brutal, and harsh (yet name me one maximum security prison where they're not), this movie doesn't reach its stride until Morris makes up his mind to escape, comes up with an ingenious plan, then patiently implements it.  Assisted primarily by two brothers (look for a young Fred Ward), the machinations as the prisoners chisel away at their air vents, smuggle tools into their cells, utilize plaster of paris (as well as making it in their tiny sinks), are fascinating viewing.  There are setbacks to be sure, along with plenty of almost-getting-discovered suspense, but as ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ concludes you'll be cheering the escapees on.--D.

The premise was the real-life, and still unresolved, escape of three inmates from the Alcatraz maximum security prison in 1962.""Escape from Alcatraz"", filmed on location in the refurbished prison on Alcatraz Island, effectively recreates the cheerless and claustrophic atmosphere of a tough prison for tough criminals.  Eastwood plays Frank Morris, an inmate who discovers a possible way to escape.  he enlists the aid of three other convicts, including John and Clarence Anglin (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau).  The movie closely tracks the nail-biting suspense as Morris and the Anglin brothers make their preparations under the noses of the prison guards.  Their break for freedom depends on minute by minute execution of a difficult escape plot, including surviving the cold waters of San Francisco Bay.Veteran director Don Siegal populates the prison with an unfeeling warden (a menacing and cynical McGoohan) and a collection of eccentric and sometimes vicious criminals.  The action of the movie is held strictly to the island and the need to escape; there are no distracting side stories from outside the world of confinement.

Frank Morris (Eastwood) is a career criminal sent to Alcatraz. He has an I.Q. of 133 and has broken out of other prisons. The warden (McGoohan) is a rotten egomaniac and lectures Morris that he won't escape Alcatraz. Right! Morris gets together with a few other inmates and devises a plan to escape. It works.This is a good, solid effort with Don Siegel at the helm. The writing is decent as is the acting. Having read the account of the escape, they did seem to have stuck closely to the facts but that might be the problem. The plan was well thought out and the perps didn't seem to rush things. They were going to take their time and get it right which they did, so it seems the writers needed to do a few things to up the tension. These were small parts of the film but they stuck out.

He has been in other federal prisons but his proclivity to escape has gotten him sent to the island. While there, he befriends some other convicts and makes plans to do what nobody else has ever done. He plans to escape.Most of the first part of the movie is spent learning about the convicts and what brought them to Alcatraz. It examines the motivations and shows what leads each one to be willing to risk death in order to get out of the hellhole. The second half deals with how they actually make their escape. It is no easy thing on a rock island. Throughout it all, Patrick McGoohan, as the warden, puts in brief but memorable appearances. It is his style of running things that so makes everyone want out. When they make it, you are glad he finally has egg on his face.There is not much action in terms of fights and stunts but most of the film is action in the sense that people are shown doing things.

209503,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6300213900,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","""Escape from Alcatraz"" is based on a true story; but I'm not sure just how true the story is. What I do know is that three men did escape from Alcatraz and were never seen again. No trace of their bodies were ever recovered. While, in the end, it looksl ike they probably drowned. It's still interesting to think about. Anyway, don't worry that wasn't a spoiler. You can get that from the back cover. This movie (despite knowing what's going to happen) is very entertaining, genuinely suspenceful, and it's clear just how much shows like ""Prison Break"" owe to it. The movie stars Clint Eastwood ('Unforgiven') as Frank Morris, a convict who is shipped to the infamous Alcatraz Prison after attempting to escape from the last prison he was in. Frank adapts to life at Alcatraz, although it isn't easy. While, this film doesn't match the brutality a movie like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" did, this film captures the claustrophobia of the prison perfectly. Anyway, Frank quickly befriends a few colorful characters; Doc (Roberts Blossom), English (Paul Benjamin), Charley Butts (Larry Hankin), and two people we gather he'd known before...John and Clarence Anglin (Fred Ward & Jack Thibeau).While only 3 of the men escape, all these characters end up playing important roles in the escape. This movie was made way back in 1979 and barely seems dated. It's realistic for it's time and all and was actually shot at Alcatraz, which helps. All the actors are really good, especially Eastwood who's in one of his best performances here. The movie is also very smart, it explores in detail exactly what they did to get out. The biggest problem with this movie isn't even the movie, it's the DVD. They need to do a new transfer and put out a special editon. This might only pertain to my copy, but there were times where I could barely hear the dialogue (and there's no English subtitles). There's no special features (a featurette on the escapees would have been nice); But the movie is really flawless. If you like the show ""Prison Break"" or enjoy prison movies, this is one of the best.GRADE: A",5,Escape from Alcatraz,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,2087,"['Escape', 'Alcatraz', 'based', 'true', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'just', 'how', 'true', 'story', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'three', 'men', 'did', 'escape', 'Alcatraz', 'were', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'No', 'trace', 'bodies', 'were', 'ever', 'recovered', 'end', 'probably', 'drowned', 'still', 'interesting', 'think', 'Anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'was', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'cover', 'movie', 'knowing', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'very', 'entertaining', 'genuinely', 'suspenceful', 'clear', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'shows', 'Prison', 'Break', 'owe', 'movie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', ""'Unforgiven"", 'Frank', 'Morris', 'convict', 'who', 'shipped', 'infamous', 'Alcatraz', 'Prison', 'attempting', 'escape', 'last', 'prison', 'was', 'Frank', 'life', 'Alcatraz', ""n't"", 'easy', 'film', ""n't"", 'match', 'brutality', 'movie', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'did', 'film', 'claustrophobia', 'prison', 'perfectly', 'Anyway', 'Frank', 'quickly', 'few', 'colorful', 'characters', 'Doc', 'Roberts', 'Blossom', 'English', 'Paul', 'Benjamin', 'Charley', 'Butts', 'Larry', 'Hankin', 'two', 'people', 'gather', ""'d"", 'known', 'before', 'John', 'Clarence', 'Anglin', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Jack', 'Thibeau', 'only', '3', 'men', 'escape', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'playing', 'important', 'roles', 'escape', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'back', '1979', 'barely', 'dated', 'realistic', 'time', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Alcatraz', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'especially', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'here', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'smart', 'detail', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'out', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'movie', 'DVD', 'need', 'do', 'new', 'transfer', 'put', 'out', 'special', 'editon', 'might', 'only', 'pertain', 'copy', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'could', 'barely', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'English', 'subtitles', 'special', 'features', 'featurette', 'escapees', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'movie', 'really', 'flawless', 'like', 'show', 'Prison', 'Break', 'enjoy', 'prison', 'movies', 'one', 'best.GRADE']",Escape from Alcatraz VHS

Clint and company portray 3 criminals destined to be on the &#34;Rock&#34; for decades. One day, him and his &#34;close knit&#34; group concoct a way out of the prison. The prison break worked days later with his group close behind, except for one member, who can't decide to leave his cell until it's too late. With a warden that was on his case seemingly at every turn from the beginning, and another prison member that has threatened to kill him, his character had the motivation and the complete will to leave it all behind.With the help of his mutual prisoner &#34;friends&#34;, he succeeds in his escape, aided by 9 hours lead. Whether you believe they escaped or drowned in the bay is up to you. I personally believe that they did get away. They had all the motivation going for all three of them, plus the time lead and the darkness. No bodies were ever found of the 3.This is a great movie and probably sets the tone for what it may have been like there at Alcatraz all those years ago.I recommend this movie to add to your collection.

Ironically enough, it was less than a year after the break that the prison was closed for good. As late as 1990, the &quot;tablespoon trio&quot; were thought to have robbed a bank up in Marianna, FL in the panhandle. The FBI put out a new poster offering a 1 million dollar reward leading to their arrest.

Frank Morris, played by Clint Eastwood, plans a daring breakout from the country's most secure maximum security prison.  He recruits old friends John Anglin, played by Fred Ward, and John's brother, Clarence Anglin, played by Jack Thibeau, and new friend Charlie Butts, played by Larry Hankin and based on real-life Alcatraz prisoner Allen West, in his preparations as they set out to not only escape from the facility but to delay anyone realizing that they were gone, giving themselves a longer head start.  While a few (very few) changes were made under the name of ""artistic license"", this is a film that can be enjoyed as much today as it was back when it came out in 1979.  I think filming on the real Alcatraz Island helped, but a lot of credit goes to the actors and filmmakers as well.

209539,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6300213900,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[23, 24]","In the 29 years of Alcatraz's existence, and despite the strict measures, 39 captives tried to escape from America's premier maximum-security prison during its existence... Thirty six of whom failed... This script is about the other three, of whom nothing is known... They may have drowned in San Francisco Bay, or they may have got away...Morris (Clint Eastwood) was a loner, a rebel against society, the perfect hero that Siegel loves... Lee Marvin in 'The Killers', Steve McQueen in 'Hell is for Heroes', and Richard Widmark in 'Madigan' were all similar types in films which he had directed..In 'Escape From Alcatraz,' Eastwood gives his best screen acting to date... It is a charismatic performance that is so idiosyncratic, persuasive, and powerful... Eastwood, gave Morris the rough, intelligent aspect that is immediately palpable...The first few minutes of the film consist of Morris being brought by boat to Alcatraz, inspected by a doctor and thrown into a cell... Throughout this, Eastwood does not speak... But already the audience feels it... They know the character... He has been through this before... He tries to control his mind... He builds a barrier between himself and his surroundings... He holds back his fear but he's not so foolish as to appear brave... Behind his impassivity, his mind is calculating... He is studying everyone... Everyone knows, prison guards and fellow prisoners alike, that this is not a man to be intimidated with easily...But Siegel wasn't making a film about penal cruelty or miscarriage of justice or anything like that... He was presenting a meditative study of the inflexibility of human spirit, with a star strong enough in himself to join one sequence to the next... Both Siegel and Eastwood are known for violence, but there's relatively little of it this time...This is not to say that Siegel has no interest in character... Stereotype characters, such as Doc and Litmus, make the film more entertaining... A further example is the inevitable homosexual Wolf (Bruce M. Fisher), who points out that Morris is a potential victim but realizes he has met his match when he approaches him in the showers one morning and gets three unexpected blows in the groin and a bar of soap in the mouth for his harassment... Another familiar type of character is English (Paul Benjamin), the leader of the Black mafia, who sits in the yard far away from the white inmates... English proves to be a nice guy..But the biggest stereotype of them all is the cold warden, although Patrick McGoohan tries as hard as he can to provide Morris with some individual personality... Apart from the flower-crushing and constant attention to his nails, he is permitted by the scriptwriter merely to recite phrases that might have come from the prison handbook: 'No one has ever escaped from Alcatraz alive. Alcatraz was built to keep all the rotten eggs in one basket. I was specially chosen to make sure the stink from that basket doesn't escape.'But two elements in the film are absolutely real: one is the central character, which will be considered in a moment, and the other is 'The Rock' itself...Siegel's overwhelming achievement is to send the audience to infamous prison for two hours... The claustrophobia, the implicit suppression of any joy, the barbarity of being caged in isolation cells, all these suffocating atrocities come across with such reality that one experiences a total sense of relief when the camera moves into the recreation yard for the clear bright light of every early morning... Siegel's technique in this respect is unique...Siegel's film style seems almost a cinematic interpretation of Eastwood screen persona: lean, clean, and harsh... Here is one example: When the incorrigible psychopath is out to finish Eastwood, his one chance is in the exercise yard... When he enters the yard, he is in need for a weapon... He has none! He slowly advances into the yard toward his victim... The camera goes down to the man's right hand as he walks... After a moment, another man puts a knife in that hand... The camera stays on the hand as he keeps moving... After another moment, another hand reaches in and grabs the con's arm.... The whole brief sequence is loaded with surprise and suspense... It is in two words: pure cinema...Siegel's movie follows the known facts of the escape constantly, permitting itself only one act of poetic license at the very end... Throughout the film, Siegel uses a yellow chrysanthemum as a symbol of 'heart', to indicate that although the brutal system may have removed everything from the inmates save the questionable privilege of remaining alive, in some men at least their spirit survives...'Doc', an elderly inmate who has spent twenty years there but who is permitted to paint and cultivate chrysanthemums, introduces the concept...",4,Eastwood gives his best screen acting to date...,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,4827,"['29', 'years', 'Alcatraz', 'existence', 'strict', 'measures', '39', 'captives', 'tried', 'escape', 'America', 'premier', 'maximum-security', 'prison', 'existence', 'Thirty', 'six', 'whom', 'failed', 'script', 'other', 'three', 'whom', 'nothing', 'known', 'may', 'have', 'drowned', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'may', 'have', 'got', 'away', 'Morris', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'loner', 'rebel', 'society', 'perfect', 'hero', 'Siegel', 'Lee', 'Marvin', ""'The"", 'Killers', 'Steve', 'McQueen', ""'Hell"", 'Heroes', 'Richard', 'Widmark', ""'Madigan"", 'were', 'similar', 'types', 'films', 'had', 'directed..In', ""'Escape"", 'Alcatraz', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'screen', 'acting', 'date', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'so', 'idiosyncratic', 'persuasive', 'powerful', 'Eastwood', 'gave', 'Morris', 'rough', 'intelligent', 'aspect', 'immediately', 'palpable', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'consist', 'Morris', 'being', 'brought', 'boat', 'Alcatraz', 'inspected', 'doctor', 'thrown', 'cell', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'speak', 'already', 'audience', 'know', 'character', 'been', 'before', 'control', 'mind', 'barrier', 'surroundings', 'back', 'fear', 'not', 'so', 'foolish', 'appear', 'brave', 'impassivity', 'mind', 'calculating', 'studying', 'everyone', 'Everyone', 'prison', 'guards', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'alike', 'not', 'man', 'be', 'intimidated', 'easily', 'Siegel', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'film', 'penal', 'cruelty', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'anything', 'was', 'presenting', 'meditative', 'study', 'inflexibility', 'human', 'spirit', 'star', 'strong', 'enough', 'join', 'one', 'sequence', 'next', 'Siegel', 'Eastwood', 'are', 'known', 'violence', 'relatively', 'little', 'time', 'not', 'say', 'Siegel', 'interest', 'character', 'Stereotype', 'characters', 'such', 'Doc', 'Litmus', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'entertaining', 'further', 'example', 'inevitable', 'homosexual', 'Wolf', 'Bruce', 'M.', 'Fisher', 'who', 'out', 'Morris', 'potential', 'victim', 'met', 'match', 'when', 'showers', 'one', 'morning', 'three', 'unexpected', 'blows', 'groin', 'bar', 'soap', 'mouth', 'harassment', 'familiar', 'type', 'character', 'English', 'Paul', 'Benjamin', 'leader', 'Black', 'mafia', 'who', 'yard', 'far', 'away', 'white', 'inmates', 'English', 'be', 'nice', 'guy..But', 'biggest', 'stereotype', 'cold', 'warden', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'as', 'hard', 'can', 'provide', 'Morris', 'individual', 'personality', 'Apart', 'flower-crushing', 'constant', 'attention', 'nails', 'permitted', 'scriptwriter', 'merely', 'recite', 'phrases', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'prison', 'handbook', 'one', 'ever', 'escaped', 'Alcatraz', 'alive', 'Alcatraz', 'was', 'built', 'keep', 'rotten', 'one', 'basket', 'was', 'specially', 'chosen', 'make', 'sure', 'stink', 'basket', ""n't"", 'escape', ""'But"", 'two', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'real', 'one', 'central', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'moment', 'other', ""'The"", 'Rock', 'Siegel', 'overwhelming', 'achievement', 'send', 'audience', 'infamous', 'prison', 'two', 'hours', 'claustrophobia', 'implicit', 'suppression', 'joy', 'barbarity', 'being', 'caged', 'isolation', 'cells', 'suffocating', 'atrocities', 'come', 'such', 'reality', 'one', 'total', 'sense', 'relief', 'when', 'camera', 'recreation', 'yard', 'clear', 'bright', 'light', 'early', 'morning', 'Siegel', 'technique', 'respect', 'unique', 'Siegel', 'film', 'style', 'almost', 'cinematic', 'interpretation', 'Eastwood', 'screen', 'persona', 'lean', 'clean', 'harsh', 'Here', 'one', 'example', 'When', 'incorrigible', 'psychopath', 'out', 'finish', 'Eastwood', 'one', 'chance', 'exercise', 'yard', 'When', 'yard', 'need', 'weapon', 'none', 'slowly', 'yard', 'victim', 'camera', 'down', 'man', 'right', 'hand', 'moment', 'man', 'knife', 'hand', 'camera', 'hand', 'moving', 'moment', 'hand', 'grabs', 'con', 'arm', 'whole', 'brief', 'sequence', 'loaded', 'surprise', 'suspense', 'two', 'words', 'pure', 'cinema', 'Siegel', 'movie', 'known', 'facts', 'escape', 'constantly', 'permitting', 'only', 'one', 'act', 'poetic', 'license', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'Siegel', 'yellow', 'chrysanthemum', 'symbol', ""'heart"", 'indicate', 'brutal', 'system', 'may', 'have', 'removed', 'everything', 'inmates', 'save', 'questionable', 'privilege', 'remaining', 'alive', 'men', 'least', 'spirit', 'survives', ""'Doc"", 'elderly', 'inmate', 'who', 'spent', 'twenty', 'years', 'there', 'who', 'permitted', 'paint', 'cultivate', 'chrysanthemums', 'concept']",Escape from Alcatraz VHS

Escape from Alcatraz is a winner.Director Don Siegel is pitch perfect from beginning to end.  Many reviewers who have been to Alcatraz comment on the realism of this film.  Siegel gives us an inside look at what it might have been like to be imprisoned on ""the rock.""  From the black hole of solitary confinement to the painfully small individual cells of the prisoners, Alcatraz was a nasty place meant for only the nastiest criminals.One of these prisoners is Frank Morris, expertly played by Clint Eastwood, who is transferred to Alcatraz, gets into a fight with an inmate who wants to make him his ""punk,"" and spends time in the black hole.  When he gets out of solitary, Morris begins to plan his escape.  Several reviewers comment on the fact that Hollywood does not get these facts straight, but I didn't much care.  I was pulled very quickly into Morris's plans and then the actual mechanics of the breakout, which were genuinely interesting and toward the end, had me sitting at the edge of my chair as I waited with suspense to see how the story would end.The escape is obviously central to the entire plot, but the life of prisoners at Alcatraz is also dramatized expertly by Don Siegel.  The warden, Patrick McGoohan, is aloof and professional, but he has a mean streak, which makes life harder than it needs to be on the rock.  Frank Morris is smart enough not to get mad, but to get even, and this he does with three other inmates who assist him in the breakout. The warden and his guards are constanly on the alert for any suspicious behavior and we hold our breath from time to time as the escape plan is almost detected.At last the time comes and we go step by step with Morris and two of his crew as they head for the icy waters surrounding Alcatraz.  The fourth member of the crew hesitated and was left behind.  This appears to follow the real-life events as mentioned by other reviewers.Did Morris and his buddies successfully navigate the treacherous waters surrounding Alcatraz?  I'll leave that question unanswered.  Viewers can decide for themselves.What is certain, at least to the reviewers of Amazon.com, is that Escape from Alcatraz is a well-made, highly suspenseful film from beginning to end, and it is one of Clint Eastwood's best roles -- that's saying something.

In the movie there were three people in on it ,but in reality there were four and Clint Eastwood's charactor wasn't the one that planned it.

209548,A8GP5U9H4PNOC,6300213900,slider,"[5, 5]","This is one of these great movies that keeps you cheering for the villans as they attempt to outwit the establishment; This time it's the notorious Alcatraz Federal Prison and it's cold and heartless warden, played excellently by Patrick McGoohan (he also played the equally cold and ruthless King Longshanks in Braveheart).  By prison movie standards, this one is very realistic and keeps you in suspense right to the end. It's my second-favorite prison movie, just behind The Shawshank Redemption.Clint Eastwood plays Frank Morris, a life-long con who has been sent to Alcatraz in part because of his successful past escape attempts.  The warden advises Morris that Alcatraz was built to keep all the &quot;rotten eggs in one basket.&quot;  Seconds later, Morris finds his first 'tool' to assist in his escape; the wardens nail clippers!  Later, Morris meets his soon-to-be accomplices, brothers he met in another institution.  It's not long before Morris finds his path to freedom, with the unlikely aid of a cockroach. Together, taking risky and cunning chances to sneak items into their cells to assist in their escape, the three men and one more-reluctant con find a way to make their break.  The build-up to the escape is absolutely brilliant.  Every scene leaves you on the edge of your seat.  You can imagine what it was really like trying to pull off this escape.The beauty of this movie is that it is based on a true story.  It is the most famous of all prison escapes and one of the few where the fate of the escapees is unknown to this day.  It would be awesome, assuming they lived, that one or more of the escapees would come forward to tell their story today.  I would support a pardon for all three of them just for pulling it off. As for their fate, I recently watched a documentary that attempted to replicate their escape and determine if they could have survived swimming in that frigid Bay-area water.

So much of the film tries to unnecessarily sensationalize events or characters, like the the black inmate English, and his relationship to Morris never existed, nor could it have in 1960-62 prison life. One of the reasons these guys wound up in Alcatraz was because of their extreme racial animosity.

It's mainly about a prisoner, played superbly by Eastwood, who attempts to escape prison with two other inmates. The movie documents their attempts in leaving one of the most well-secured prisons in the U.S., Alcatraz, located in San Francisco Bay. Roberts Blossom, who once played one of the most evil characters in soaps (Sven in ""Another World""), also has a supporting role as a prisoner who befriends the Eastwood character.If you like a good film or a good prison movie ""Escape From Alcatraz"" is it!

I haven't seen so many zero ratings by other readers for the reviews as in ""Helpful"" or not. Many of them appear to have been written by teenagers. They are short and don't say much at all.As escape movies go, this one is okay, but using them as for comparison, this certainly isn't the best one. It's not nearly on the level of ""The Great Escape.""I agree with the other reviewers who noticed it moves slowly.One of the other problems I had with it is the lack of problems to overcome along the way to the escape attempt. There were no real setbacks as in other escape movies in the process of setting up the escape. They didn't get caught and have to start over, for example (cf. Colditz). None of the escape team were injured, killed, or replaced beforehand. There is no mole. There isn't a lot of tension or difference of opinion between the members of the escape team, or controversy deciding who gets to be part of the team.Then, during the actual escape attempt, there really weren't any great new challenges to overcome where they had to adapt to unexpected events or circumstances. Sure there is drama and some suspenseful music in EFA, but there could have been so much more, and there will be if/when there is a remake.Clint Eastwood plays his popular persona in Escape from Alcatraz that he played in numerous popular Westerns and police movies. Tough, reserved, independent, leader. He's more restrained than he was in the Dirty Harry movies he did a few years before this in the 1970s.And that's one thing I liked about EFA: its restraint. There is some prison violence, but not that much considering how extreme the prison and its inmates. The warden is mean but not as vicious as some prison wardens in other prison movies (Midnight Express).The cast of characters:* a prison escape artist (Eastwood)* a mean prison warden* a middle-aged white inmate who likes to paint* a cool ""senior"" black inmate who works at the library* a spurned ""gay"" inmate who seeks revenge on Morris (Eastwood)* a middle-aged inmate who has a pet mouse* a few con men who become part of the escape team* an inmate who is Morris's ""neighbor""* a few other inmates and guardsThe characters aren't that interesting.I would suggest you see it, but it's a movie to rent, not buy.
