1214073,AD0FVQA6IS7B9,B001LEPEDW,"C. King ""real talk""","[2, 2]","This documentary had me on the edge of my seat. Mr. Frank Alexander was Tupac's bodyguard for a short time but he became friend's with Tupac whereas other bodyguard's didn't like Pac for whatever reason. He and Pac were cool as evidenced in this film. Michael Moore who states that he did not care for Tupac is in this video telling all that he knows and laying his cards on the table. I see a whole lot of corruption and deceit and backstabbing and hatred in this film. I have always wondered what the ""Real Truth"" was about Tupac and his death, and after viewing this video, I now know. The media played a big part in getting this story all mixed up and having people confused, just like I was but not anymore. The whole East Coast/West Coast war was ""ALL"" a bunch of media hype that the public fell for, hook, line and sinker as did I. This DVD puts it all out there for anyone to view and know the truth. It is a travesty and a miscarraige of Justice that Tupac's killer and accomplices have not been brought to justice in ""16"" years. Tupac Amaru Shakur was ""Assassinated"". Just like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. before him. The video tells you step by step, who the key players were, and how they killed one of the biggest names in Rap History! If you watch this DVD and don't feel a need to do something, then something is seriously wrong with America. I urge everyone to contact the people he tells you at the end.

I heard a bit of Pac and Biggie back then in the 1990s when they first begin, but it wasn't till high school (early 2000s) that I got real deeper in their music plus the stories, their deaths, the theories and so forth. For people who needed to re-capture the original version of Tupac Assassination should find on this DVD titled2pac: Assassination. I seemed to love both versions of TA 1 plus TA 2 which seems interesting. Great props to Big Frank Alexander, Cathy Scott, the people who worked with Tupac, etc. took the time to express themselves how it all happen, why it happen, and what things could've been prevented to stop it.The thing is only God still knows the real answer, the real Truth behind it. We as fans and supporters of Tupac's music and legacy must keep going and take charge to bring all the clues, info and stuff you see from this 2-DVD set plus the first TA DVD, bringing this matter to justice. Pac could be gone, but he lives forever in our hearts.No matter what you say, think or read between this man. This man had it all. He's never no gangsta, no thug, no by anymeans been involved in any gangs or hood related, whatever you wanted. 2Pac's wasn't just a rapper, he's also a poet, actor, activist, producer, writer and innovator.My great advice if you want real closure in this case, and try not to get into all the B.S. nonsense what they said about Pac or Biggie, please be my guest. I know in my heart justice will be served who's ever responsible should come forward. Let's hope and pray to God this thing can happen by heart and great teamwork.God rest the spirits of Tupac and Biggie.Check thru Cathy Scott's book on Biggie and Tupac e.g. The Killing of Tupac Shakur and The Murder of Biggie Smalls (highly recommend), LAbrynth by Randall Sullivan, Notorious C.O.P., Biggie and Tupac 2002 documentary by British director Nick Broomfeld, Tupac Shakur: Before I Wake (Frank Alexander's first ever documentary he dropped in 2001), Got Your Back (Frank's first ever book)Let's remember what they accomplished and achieved, not just only for their deaths and tragedies.Godspeed, people!",5,Full of gathering info & clues on Tupac's Assassination,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,2288,"['question', 'mind', 'most', 'compelling', 'case', 'alongside', 'Biggie', 'Smalls', 'ever', 'been', 'obsessed', 'studied', 'embrace', 'entire', 'life', 'heard', 'bit', 'Pac', 'Biggie', 'back', 'then', '1990s', 'when', 'first', 'begin', 'was', ""n't"", 'till', 'high', 'school', 'early', '2000s', 'got', 'real', 'deeper', 'music', 'stories', 'deaths', 'theories', 'so', 'forth', 'people', 'who', 'needed', 're-capture', 'original', 'version', 'Tupac', 'Assassination', 'should', 'find', 'DVD', 'titled2pac', 'Assassination', 'seemed', 'love', 'versions', 'TA', '1', 'TA', '2', 'interesting', 'Great', 'Big', 'Frank', 'Alexander', 'Cathy', 'Scott', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'Tupac', 'etc', 'took', 'time', 'express', 'how', 'happen', 'why', 'happen', 'what', 'things', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'prevented', 'stop', 'it.The', 'thing', 'only', 'God', 'still', 'real', 'answer', 'real', 'Truth', 'fans', 'supporters', 'Tupac', 'music', 'legacy', 'must', 'keep', 'going', 'take', 'charge', 'bring', 'clues', 'info', 'stuff', 'see', '2-DVD', 'set', 'first', 'TA', 'DVD', 'bringing', 'matter', 'justice', 'Pac', 'could', 'be', 'gone', 'forever', 'hearts.No', 'matter', 'what', 'say', 'think', 'read', 'man', 'man', 'had', 'all', 'never', 'gangsta', 'thug', 'anymeans', 'been', 'involved', 'gangs', 'hood', 'related', 'wanted', '2Pac', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'rapper', 'also', 'poet', 'actor', 'activist', 'producer', 'writer', 'innovator.My', 'great', 'advice', 'want', 'real', 'closure', 'case', 'try', 'not', 'get', 'B.S', 'what', 'said', 'Pac', 'Biggie', 'please', 'be', 'guest', 'know', 'heart', 'justice', 'will', 'be', 'served', 'who', 'ever', 'responsible', 'should', 'come', 'forward', 'Let', 'hope', 'pray', 'God', 'thing', 'can', 'happen', 'heart', 'great', 'teamwork.God', 'rest', 'spirits', 'Tupac', 'Biggie.Check', 'thru', 'Cathy', 'Scott', 'book', 'Biggie', 'Tupac', 'e.g', 'Killing', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'Murder', 'Biggie', 'Smalls', 'highly', 'recommend', 'LAbrynth', 'Randall', 'Sullivan', 'Notorious', 'C.O.P.', 'Biggie', 'Tupac', '2002', 'documentary', 'British', 'director', 'Nick', 'Broomfeld', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'Wake', 'Frank', 'Alexander', 'first', 'ever', 'dropped', '2001', 'Got', 'Your', 'Back', 'Frank', 'first', 'ever', 'book', 'Let', 'remember', 'what', 'accomplished', 'achieved', 'not', 'just', 'only', 'deaths', 'tragedies.Godspeed', 'people']",Tupac Assassination
