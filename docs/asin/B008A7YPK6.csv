1549291,A1MV8LXEXO8EWC,B008A7YPK6,"Amazon Customer ""The Ideator""","[5, 5]","I've been a Pat Metheny fan ever since I saw him in concert at the Molson Ampitheatre in 1982 in Toronto around the time he was writing Offramp material.  I'm also a musician who gigs regularly with a jazz group that plays some of his music.Overall, I'm glad he did Orchestrion.  Pat appears to value ideation, innovation and breaking new ground.  In my view, he did it again with the Orchestrion project.  He created a solo album unlike any other.  I don't think anyone has seen a one man band like this.  The array of instruments is broader than any other one-man band I've ever seen.  Like he says in one of the interview, it represents a third flavor of his music with the Pat Metheny Group as one form, the traditional jazz trio as another, and now the Orchestrion.I found the interview tracks fascinating.  Pat interviews very well and his comments are fascinating about his thought processes in putting the Orchestrion project together.  I also noticed he made a couple passing references to his family which has hitherto been an off-limits topic in some of his interviews.  He didn't focus on it, but did make a passing comment about his wife's perception of the project, which I found interesting because I haven't known much about the people in his personal life who support him.I really liked some of the compositions.  Like much of his music, I have to listen to it about 5 times before I really get it and connect to the core melodies.  I would encourage listeners to be patient and give the music a chance by doing the same if your ear doesn't bond with the music immediately.The only thing that bothered me about Orchestrion was the limited dynamic and intensity range of his mechanical orchestra.  He was able to achieve some tension and release, but only within a certain range.  Therefore, at times the playing seemed to be too much on one dynamic/intensity level for too long.  At times I wondered about the value found in using mechanical instruments.  Current technology allows one man bandmanship too, so I found myself wondering about the value the mechanical instruments provide, particularly when the inventions were not capable of simulating the kind of tension and release I believe Pat and most jazz musicians are used to creating.  I see this as yet another frontier for a mechancial orchestra like this.However, this is an important addition to my collection of music and live DVD's.  I will return to it over and over again and hear new things, I'm sure.Congratulations to Pat for breaking new ground yet again!",4,Fascinating but without tension and release,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,2542,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'fan', 'ever', 'saw', 'concert', 'Molson', 'Ampitheatre', '1982', 'Toronto', 'time', 'was', 'writing', 'Offramp', 'material', ""'m"", 'also', 'musician', 'who', 'regularly', 'jazz', 'group', 'music.Overall', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Orchestrion', 'Pat', 'value', 'ideation', 'innovation', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'view', 'did', 'again', 'Orchestrion', 'project', 'created', 'solo', 'album', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'seen', 'one', 'man', 'band', 'array', 'instruments', 'broader', 'other', 'one-man', 'band', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'interview', 'third', 'flavor', 'music', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'Group', 'one', 'form', 'traditional', 'jazz', 'trio', 'now', 'Orchestrion.I', 'found', 'interview', 'fascinating', 'Pat', 'very', 'well', 'comments', 'are', 'fascinating', 'thought', 'putting', 'Orchestrion', 'project', 'together', 'also', 'noticed', 'made', 'couple', 'passing', 'references', 'family', 'hitherto', 'been', 'off-limits', 'topic', 'interviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'did', 'make', 'passing', 'comment', 'wife', 'perception', 'project', 'found', 'interesting', 'have', ""n't"", 'known', 'much', 'people', 'personal', 'life', 'who', 'support', 'him.I', 'really', 'liked', 'compositions', 'much', 'music', 'have', 'listen', '5', 'times', 'really', 'get', 'connect', 'core', 'melodies', 'would', 'encourage', 'listeners', 'be', 'patient', 'give', 'music', 'chance', 'doing', 'same', 'ear', ""n't"", 'bond', 'music', 'only', 'thing', 'bothered', 'Orchestrion', 'was', 'limited', 'dynamic', 'intensity', 'range', 'mechanical', 'orchestra', 'was', 'able', 'achieve', 'tension', 'release', 'only', 'certain', 'range', 'Therefore', 'times', 'playing', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'dynamic/intensity', 'level', 'too', 'long', 'times', 'wondered', 'value', 'found', 'using', 'mechanical', 'instruments', 'Current', 'technology', 'one', 'man', 'bandmanship', 'too', 'found', 'wondering', 'value', 'mechanical', 'instruments', 'provide', 'particularly', 'when', 'inventions', 'were', 'not', 'capable', 'simulating', 'kind', 'tension', 'release', 'believe', 'Pat', 'most', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'are', 'used', 'creating', 'see', 'yet', 'frontier', 'mechancial', 'orchestra', 'this.However', 'important', 'addition', 'collection', 'music', 'live', 'DVD', 'will', 'return', 'over', 'again', 'hear', 'new', 'things', ""'m"", 'sure.Congratulations', 'Pat', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'yet', 'again']",N/A

For almost forty years Metheny has thrilled fans and audiences around the world with his brilliant compositions and guitar virtuosity.  Those fans will be thrilled to know that Mr. Metheny has released Pat Metheny: The Orchestrion Project.The Orchestrion Project was filmed by Grammy and Emmy Award winning directors Pierre & Franois Lamoureux at the former St Elias Church in Greenpoint, Brooklyn in November 2010. It features Pat Metheny on guitar performing The Orchestrion Suite as well as other tracks from across Metheny's prolific career. Also included are four bonus tracks [on disc one of the DVD format] and over an hour of bonus material containing four special features (on disc two of the DVD format).Based on a childhood fascination with his grandfather's player piano, 19 time Grammy Award winner Pat Metheny, commissioned and built The Orchestrion, a mechanically controlled mini-orchestra capable of responding to his touch on the guitar. This innovative project brought about a completely unique approach to solo performance. The collaboration between this master guitarist and his wildest imagination has resulted in a fascinating and absolutely one of a kind musical experience.The Orchestrion itself is an assemblage of specially designed acoustic instruments, all controlled by Metheny's guitar. The full array includes several pianos, drum kits, marimbas, ""guitar-bots,"" dozens of percussion instruments and even cabinets of carefully tuned bottles. Metheny brings this contraption to life with five new pieces written specifically for the Orchestrion alongside compositions from past recordings to showcase the instruments as they are struck, plucked, and otherwise played via the technology of solenoid switches and pneumatics.Imagine the money he saves in paying all those musicians while totally eliminating inter-band turmoil, egos and politics.  It makes the business geek inside of me giddy with excitement.Shot over a two-day period in November 2010 at St. Elias Church in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, The Orchestrion Project showcases Metheny single-handedly operating this symphony of instruments in one illustrious treat for the senses. Boomerocity has already nearly worn out the review copy of The Orchestrio Project (okay, a slight exaggeration but you get the point).Looking at the track listing, below, Metheny fans will know that they MUST have this performance as part of their private DVD collection - and just in time for the holidays.

1549297,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008A7YPK6,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","I first saw Pat Metheny in the early 1970's when we were both young men.  Watching his guitar wizardry and listening to his group on that beautiful summer night in Chicago stuck with me over the years and through various Metheny collaborations.  I've seen him in person several times since, most recently when he was on tour with his Unity Band.  Although that show was pretty much straight up jazz, he had an unusual assortment of instruments and objects set up in the back of the stage.  They just sat there for the most part until Metheny released his bandmates, threw a switch or something and the gizmos lit up and started moving.  This was in fact, a smaller set up of the Orchestrion (a generic name for a machine that plays music and is designed to sound like an orchestra or band) Project.When I got home I dug out a CD from 2010 called ""Orchestrion.""  I had listened to it casually a couple times and filed it away after making a note:  ""This live concert shows that Metheny still has it.""  Boy, did I blow it!  I obviously wasn't paying attention to the detail.  The CD features 5 tracks which are replicated here on the Blu ray disc.Along with the opening ""Unity Village"" segment, this concert feature (recorded in his studio) runs a little over an hour.  The next 3 pieces, including ""Stranger in Town"" run another 26+ minutes.  Pat includes 4 songs shown as ""Bonus Songs"" (about 21 minutes) and include ""Tell Her You Saw Me"" and ""Antonia"" from 1992's ""Secret Story"" album, one of my favorites.Metheny has managed to put together a huge undertaking and has made it work beautifully.  It is truly mind boggling to understand how the genius of coming up with all this can project music of this quality.  Not only did Metheny have to arrange and presumably program these musical segments, but he invented several of the ""instruments.""  This not only needed great musical talent but a yearning for something different.  A challenge that includes a knowledge of physics, electrical engineering and computer programming.  I suspect this will remain just another one of Metheny's many collaborations.  Surely he will still need the inspiration of playing with human musicians.This Blu ray is a 3-D version (go figure) and while I don't have a 3-D display, it plays fine in 2-D.  Because of lighting limitations the quality of the picture varies with the lighting.  That is to say, it's nothing special but certainly not bad.  The audio has a couple options including a Dolby TrueHD 5.1/7.1 track and lossless 2.0 stereo.  As you might expect the sound was magnificent in both outputs.  Additional bonus features include an interview with Metheny, a ""making-of"" feature, a recording session and more.",5,4 1/2 stars (BLU RAY) for a one-of-a-kind musical experience,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,2705,"['first', 'saw', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'early', '1970', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'men', 'Watching', 'guitar', 'wizardry', 'listening', 'group', 'beautiful', 'summer', 'night', 'Chicago', 'stuck', 'years', 'various', 'Metheny', 'collaborations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'person', 'several', 'times', 'most', 'recently', 'when', 'was', 'tour', 'Unity', 'Band', 'show', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'up', 'jazz', 'had', 'unusual', 'assortment', 'instruments', 'objects', 'set', 'up', 'back', 'stage', 'just', 'sat', 'most', 'part', 'Metheny', 'released', 'bandmates', 'threw', 'switch', 'something', 'gizmos', 'lit', 'up', 'started', 'moving', 'was', 'fact', 'smaller', 'set', 'Orchestrion', 'generic', 'name', 'machine', 'music', 'designed', 'sound', 'orchestra', 'band', 'Project.When', 'got', 'home', 'dug', 'out', 'CD', '2010', 'called', 'Orchestrion', 'had', 'listened', 'casually', 'couple', 'times', 'filed', 'away', 'making', 'note', 'live', 'concert', 'Metheny', 'still', 'Boy', 'did', 'blow', 'obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'detail', 'CD', '5', 'tracks', 'are', 'replicated', 'here', 'Blu', 'ray', 'disc.Along', 'opening', 'Unity', 'Village', 'segment', 'concert', 'feature', 'recorded', 'studio', 'little', 'hour', 'next', '3', 'pieces', 'including', 'Stranger', 'Town', 'run', '26+', 'minutes', 'Pat', '4', 'songs', 'shown', 'Bonus', 'Songs', '21', 'minutes', 'include', 'Tell', 'Her', 'Saw', 'Me', 'Antonia', '1992', 'Secret', 'Story', 'album', 'one', 'favorites.Metheny', 'managed', 'put', 'together', 'huge', 'undertaking', 'made', 'work', 'beautifully', 'truly', 'mind', 'boggling', 'understand', 'how', 'genius', 'coming', 'up', 'can', 'project', 'music', 'quality', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Metheny', 'have', 'arrange', 'presumably', 'program', 'musical', 'segments', 'invented', 'several', 'instruments', 'not', 'only', 'needed', 'great', 'musical', 'talent', 'yearning', 'something', 'different', 'challenge', 'knowledge', 'physics', 'electrical', 'engineering', 'computer', 'programming', 'suspect', 'will', 'remain', 'just', 'one', 'Metheny', 'many', 'collaborations', 'Surely', 'will', 'still', 'need', 'inspiration', 'playing', 'human', 'musicians.This', 'Blu', 'ray', '3-D', 'version', 'go', 'figure', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '3-D', 'display', 'fine', '2-D.', 'lighting', 'limitations', 'quality', 'picture', 'lighting', 'say', 'nothing', 'special', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'audio', 'couple', 'options', 'including', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1/7.1', 'track', 'lossless', '2.0', 'stereo', 'might', 'expect', 'sound', 'was', 'magnificent', 'outputs', 'Additional', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'interview', 'Metheny', 'making-of', 'feature', 'recording', 'session', 'more']",N/A
1549298,A1S4E1QSHSAD8O,B008A7YPK6,R. D. Clark,"[35, 36]","Note: My review is based on viewing the Blu-ray Disc in 2D only; I have not seen it in 3D.This is a fascinating and unusual performance, unlike anything else you've ever seen. For those who followed the progress of this project from its inception and hoped to see it thoroughly documented, it will be very satisfying.Very briefly, the ""Orchestrion"" is an immense assemblage of mechanized musical instruments, largely custom designed and built specifically for this project by a number of different artisans in consultation with Metheny. These instruments are ""played"" in real time by a combination of computer-controlled scores and realtime control. In performance, the majority of the music (all composed and scored by Metheny) is played on the Orchestrion by a computer, while Metheny plays the guitar parts (and some other parts, remote-controlled from his MIDI guitar) live.This disc, then, is a film of Metheny and the Orchestrion performing the same program seen on his 2010 concert tour, but it's not recorded live in concert. Instead, the rig was set up in a former church in Brooklyn (the same space where he had originally set it up to rehearse for the tour), in such a way as to put Metheny at the center of the sound while optimizing the Orchestrion visually for the camera.Standing at the center of this amazing construct of tuned and untuned percussion, modified guitars and basses, a ""wind organ,"" pianos, electronics, invented instruments -- dozens, hundreds of individual sound sources -- Pat performs each piece complete, with no audience but the cameras and crew. The performances are as they would be in concert, but knowing that re-takes were possible, he says, allowed him to ""take chances,"" to give each piece everything he had, all informed by the experience of hundreds of live performances over the previous year.The result is a unique document. The filmmakers never lose sight of Pat Metheny as the living soul and central performer, but as the program progresses you will get clear visuals of all the various mechanisms, instruments, and devices that are the Orchestrion in a way that was never possible at the concerts (even from the fourth row, as I can testify).The 1080p video is framed at 1.66:1 (sometimes seen in European theatrical films, not sure why it was used here), so on a standard HD screen there are narrow vertical black bars at the sides. Quality is top notch, with well saturated color and very little grain. There are some stylistic choices that one might quibble with -- more hand-held camerawork than some might like; some overly dramatic lighting at times -- but these aren't quality issues. In general, throughout, you can see everything, and it remains visually interesting.The lossless 7.1 Dolby TrueHD audio is spectacular. It's mixed as true surround, with instruments in every channel, and it's never less than perfectly clear, and perfectly balanced -- which is an incredible achievement given the number of sounds going on at once, the similarity of many of their timbres, and the unusual nature of some of them. Pat's guitar is always clear and centered but never overpowering.There is also a PCM 2.0 track which I sampled to confirm that it seems to sound correct, but didn't listen to.The program is divided into two parts. The first replicated the content of the original Orchestrion CD; the second, ""bonus tracks,"" consists of pieces Metheny worked up for the concert tour, in which he works more interactively with the Orchestrion.There are a number of excellent extras as well. Those that explain the project and how the film was made are so well done and informative that I might recommend they they be viewed first by people completely unfamiliar with the project. Others include two complete videos of the studio recording of pieces for the original CD -- and it's instructive to compare how those pieces have evolved between those versions and the ""mature"" ones performed in the finished film.I understand that not everyone is a fan of this particular Pat Metheny project, for various reasons. Personally, I think Orchestrion accomplishes several goals. First, It showcases his talent as a composer, which he demonstrates by not just writing music for a collection of instruments that never before existed in the world, but also by actually causing those instruments to exist. Second, it's a unique context for listening to him play in a way that's very different from the way he plays with other musicians. Finally, especially in some of the improvisational pieces, it highlights a dimension of his genius that might have gone otherwise unnoticed: his ability to multithread musically, to hold more than one musical voice in his head at a time and to improvise between them. It's something you have to see and hear to understand, and something like Orchestrion is perhaps the only avenue for this sort of ability to be expressed.",5,Like Nothing You've Ever Seen,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,4900,"['Note', 'review', 'based', 'viewing', 'Blu-ray', 'Disc', '2D', 'only', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '3D.This', 'fascinating', 'unusual', 'performance', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'who', 'followed', 'progress', 'project', 'inception', 'hoped', 'see', 'thoroughly', 'documented', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'satisfying.Very', 'briefly', 'Orchestrion', 'immense', 'assemblage', 'mechanized', 'musical', 'instruments', 'largely', 'custom', 'designed', 'built', 'specifically', 'project', 'number', 'different', 'artisans', 'consultation', 'Metheny', 'instruments', 'are', 'played', 'real', 'time', 'combination', 'computer-controlled', 'scores', 'realtime', 'control', 'performance', 'majority', 'music', 'composed', 'scored', 'Metheny', 'played', 'Orchestrion', 'computer', 'Metheny', 'guitar', 'parts', 'other', 'parts', 'remote-controlled', 'MIDI', 'guitar', 'live.This', 'disc', 'then', 'film', 'Metheny', 'Orchestrion', 'performing', 'same', 'program', 'seen', '2010', 'concert', 'tour', 'not', 'recorded', 'live', 'concert', 'Instead', 'rig', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'former', 'church', 'Brooklyn', 'same', 'space', 'where', 'had', 'originally', 'set', 'rehearse', 'tour', 'way', 'put', 'Metheny', 'center', 'sound', 'optimizing', 'Orchestrion', 'visually', 'camera.Standing', 'center', 'amazing', 'construct', 'tuned', 'untuned', 'percussion', 'modified', 'guitars', 'basses', 'wind', 'organ', 'pianos', 'electronics', 'invented', 'instruments', 'dozens', 'hundreds', 'individual', 'sound', 'sources', 'Pat', 'piece', 'complete', 'audience', 'cameras', 'crew', 'performances', 'are', 'would', 'be', 'concert', 'knowing', 're-takes', 'were', 'possible', 'allowed', 'take', 'chances', 'give', 'piece', 'everything', 'had', 'informed', 'experience', 'hundreds', 'live', 'performances', 'previous', 'year.The', 'result', 'unique', 'document', 'filmmakers', 'never', 'lose', 'sight', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'living', 'soul', 'central', 'performer', 'program', 'will', 'get', 'clear', 'visuals', 'various', 'mechanisms', 'instruments', 'devices', 'are', 'Orchestrion', 'way', 'was', 'never', 'possible', 'concerts', 'even', 'fourth', 'row', 'can', 'testify', '.The', '1080p', 'video', 'framed', '1.66:1', 'sometimes', 'seen', 'European', 'theatrical', 'films', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'used', 'here', 'so', 'standard', 'HD', 'screen', 'are', 'narrow', 'vertical', 'black', 'bars', 'sides', 'Quality', 'top', 'notch', 'well', 'saturated', 'color', 'very', 'little', 'grain', 'are', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'one', 'might', 'quibble', 'more', 'hand-held', 'camerawork', 'might', 'like', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'lighting', 'times', 'are', ""n't"", 'quality', 'issues', 'general', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'visually', 'interesting.The', 'lossless', '7.1', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'audio', 'spectacular', 'mixed', 'true', 'surround', 'instruments', 'channel', 'never', 'less', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'incredible', 'achievement', 'given', 'number', 'sounds', 'going', 'once', 'similarity', 'many', 'timbres', 'unusual', 'nature', 'Pat', 'guitar', 'always', 'clear', 'centered', 'never', 'also', 'PCM', '2.0', 'track', 'sampled', 'confirm', 'sound', 'correct', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'to.The', 'program', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'replicated', 'content', 'original', 'Orchestrion', 'CD', 'second', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'pieces', 'Metheny', 'worked', 'up', 'concert', 'tour', 'more', 'interactively', 'Orchestrion.There', 'are', 'number', 'excellent', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'explain', 'project', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'informative', 'might', 'recommend', 'be', 'viewed', 'first', 'people', 'completely', 'unfamiliar', 'project', 'Others', 'include', 'two', 'complete', 'videos', 'studio', 'recording', 'pieces', 'original', 'CD', 'instructive', 'compare', 'how', 'pieces', 'have', 'evolved', 'versions', 'mature', 'ones', 'performed', 'finished', 'film.I', 'understand', 'not', 'everyone', 'fan', 'particular', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'project', 'various', 'reasons', 'Personally', 'think', 'Orchestrion', 'several', 'goals', 'First', 'talent', 'composer', 'not', 'just', 'writing', 'music', 'collection', 'instruments', 'never', 'before', 'existed', 'world', 'also', 'actually', 'causing', 'instruments', 'exist', 'Second', 'unique', 'context', 'listening', 'play', 'way', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'other', 'musicians', 'Finally', 'especially', 'improvisational', 'pieces', 'dimension', 'genius', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'otherwise', 'unnoticed', 'ability', 'multithread', 'musically', 'hold', 'more', 'one', 'musical', 'voice', 'head', 'time', 'improvise', 'something', 'have', 'see', 'hear', 'understand', 'something', 'Orchestrion', 'perhaps', 'only', 'avenue', 'sort', 'ability', 'be', 'expressed']",N/A

For me everything he ever did with PMG up til ""Imaginary Day"" was first rate work. As a musician Pat Metheny is second to none. He sometimes loses me with style...(what the heck was that ""Zero Tolerance For Silence"" thing all about any way?)...and I definitely prefer him with the group as opposed to his trio or solo work.The description of this show has already been written about here. I just want to add to the positives. The technical ability to put this all together is nothing short of genius. The set up and arrangement of all these instruments and tools deserves 10 stars. Video quality is kinda dark at times but clear and the aspect ratio is just shy of 16x9 so there's a tiny bit of letter box going on. A minor quibble. The HD 5.1/7.1 mix and sound is VERY good. As is the stereo track. Menu editing is quite basic and on mine at least there was no sound what so ever on the root menu.  (Oppo 93) Just the songs which sound amazing.You really never have seen or heard anything like this before. Sort of like a player piano, a wind up monkey with cymbals, a super computer and musical guru and their prodigy. Sort of indescribable.",5,Brilliant... but somewhat odd.

But due to lack of funds at that time I had to wait. I watched it last night and I was very, very happy with the results! This is a very special show that shows off the brilliant mind and fingers of Mr. Metheny. I've seen Pat many, many times in concert and he always goes above and beyond any expectations. I enjoy all of his projects whether it is with the Pat Metheny Group or one of his jazz trios or his acoustic music. His music always delivers and offers variations of style and content to keep things interesting. I really think that Pat has outdone himself with this project! Pat plays and controls numerous instruments electronically that were created by him as well. They somehow respond to whatever he plays with his fingers on his guitar! Hard to explain, you really have to see it! He is already working on an even more advanced version of what he used here for a future project. This guy is just hands down amazing! And I very much recommend this DVD. It was beautifully filmed and the sound is excellent. So do yourself a favor and get a copy now if you don't already have one.",5,Metheny's Creative Mind At It's Best!,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,1220,"['Finally', 'got', 'copy', 'show', 'DVD', 'had', 'been', 'wanting', 'purchase', 'was', 'released', 'just', '2012', 'holiday', 'due', 'lack', 'funds', 'time', 'had', 'wait', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'happy', 'results', 'very', 'special', 'show', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'fingers', 'Mr.', 'Metheny', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Pat', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'concert', 'always', 'expectations', 'enjoy', 'projects', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'Group', 'one', 'jazz', 'trios', 'acoustic', 'music', 'music', 'always', 'delivers', 'variations', 'style', 'content', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'really', 'think', 'Pat', 'outdone', 'project', 'Pat', 'plays', 'controls', 'numerous', 'instruments', 'electronically', 'were', 'created', 'as', 'well', 'somehow', 'respond', 'whatever', 'fingers', 'guitar', 'Hard', 'explain', 'really', 'have', 'see', 'already', 'working', 'even', 'more', 'advanced', 'version', 'what', 'used', 'here', 'future', 'project', 'guy', 'just', 'hands', 'down', 'amazing', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'sound', 'excellent', 'So', 'do', 'favor', 'get', 'copy', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'one']",N/A
