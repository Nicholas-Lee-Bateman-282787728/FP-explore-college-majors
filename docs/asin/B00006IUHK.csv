717151,A1FH14TQSVDH1X,B00006IUHK,Anthony Sanchez,"[82, 85]","I feel fortunate to have seen this movie and I wish I had known about it years earlier.  I have earlier heard about Raoul Wallenberg as a person who disappeared into the Stalin Soviet political prison system, but I knew little else.  It is apparently still a mystery as to why he must have been a threat to Stalin unless Stalin presumed that Wallenberg would have remained in Hungary and agitated against the impending communist state.  Regardless, Wallenberg's exploits to ultimately save thousands of Jews from extermination by fanatical Nazi's and Hungarian fascists is a story worth retelling.What is most poignant about the story is that Wallenberg is presented as a very average person, but a person witnessing atrocities in German held territories.  For most of the war, he was like the many thousands who too knew of the genocide and did nothing.  But, for his own reasons, he chose to become involved.  His role was relatively short (less than a year) and it could have been a complete failure.  In fact, he did greatly succeed according to not only this movie, but in many other accounts of his actions.  But, his success was less the story than his unselfish efforts.  Unlike the majority who remained blissfully ignorant, he had enough self-awareness so as to judge himself unfavorably for life if he did not act.  To me that is the real lesson, what did this story tell me about myself and what all of us should do when we see injustice?It is true that the movie did not focus as much on his many achievements, but the film makers decided to keep the film within two hours and to increase the drama by alluding to the triumphs and viewing him in moments of dire consequences and severe spiritual strain.  He witnessed children murdered and we could empathize with his helplessness.  The film presents these death scenes matter-of-factly as Wallenberg looks at the survivors who until that moment saw him as a mythical character who could stop all such killings.  Wallenberg was often able to escape for his safety, but stayed.  Would any of us have done the same?  I hope that I would have, but I can never know.  I only hope that whatever he finally faced in Soviet prison, he knew an internal peace of having done more than he ever thought possible of himself.  Please see this movie and show it to your children to keep these lessons alive.",5,"Not an anti-hero, just an average person doing right",1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,2356,"['feel', 'fortunate', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'wish', 'had', 'known', 'years', 'earlier', 'have', 'earlier', 'heard', 'Raoul', 'Wallenberg', 'person', 'who', 'disappeared', 'Stalin', 'Soviet', 'political', 'prison', 'system', 'knew', 'little', 'else', 'apparently', 'still', 'mystery', 'why', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'threat', 'Stalin', 'Stalin', 'presumed', 'Wallenberg', 'would', 'have', 'remained', 'Hungary', 'agitated', 'impending', 'communist', 'state', 'Regardless', 'Wallenberg', 'exploits', 'ultimately', 'save', 'thousands', 'Jews', 'extermination', 'fanatical', 'Nazi', 'Hungarian', 'fascists', 'story', 'worth', 'retelling.What', 'most', 'poignant', 'story', 'Wallenberg', 'presented', 'very', 'average', 'person', 'person', 'witnessing', 'atrocities', 'German', 'held', 'territories', 'most', 'war', 'was', 'many', 'thousands', 'who', 'too', 'knew', 'genocide', 'did', 'nothing', 'own', 'reasons', 'chose', 'become', 'involved', 'role', 'was', 'relatively', 'short', 'less', 'year', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'complete', 'failure', 'fact', 'did', 'greatly', 'succeed', 'according', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'many', 'other', 'accounts', 'actions', 'success', 'was', 'less', 'story', 'unselfish', 'efforts', 'majority', 'who', 'remained', 'blissfully', 'ignorant', 'had', 'enough', 'self-awareness', 'so', 'judge', 'unfavorably', 'life', 'did', 'not', 'act', 'real', 'lesson', 'what', 'did', 'story', 'tell', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'when', 'see', 'injustice', 'true', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'focus', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'achievements', 'film', 'makers', 'decided', 'keep', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'increase', 'drama', 'alluding', 'triumphs', 'viewing', 'moments', 'dire', 'consequences', 'severe', 'spiritual', 'strain', 'witnessed', 'children', 'murdered', 'could', 'empathize', 'helplessness', 'film', 'death', 'scenes', 'matter-of-factly', 'Wallenberg', 'survivors', 'who', 'moment', 'saw', 'mythical', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'stop', 'such', 'killings', 'Wallenberg', 'was', 'often', 'able', 'escape', 'safety', 'stayed', 'Would', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'hope', 'would', 'have', 'can', 'never', 'know', 'only', 'hope', 'finally', 'faced', 'Soviet', 'prison', 'knew', 'internal', 'peace', 'having', 'done', 'more', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible', 'Please', 'see', 'movie', 'show', 'children', 'keep', 'lessons', 'alive']",N/A
717152,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B00006IUHK,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[17, 19]","Why do we watch films?  Initially in the early days it was part escapism, part to be wowed, part to see what one couldn't realistically travel to see.  Nowadays, it is all too often simply for entertainment.  Mind you, all films are not unworthy of watching, but far too few are ""moving"" in an emotional sense.  ""Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg"" is one such film that certainly is ""worthy of watching"" (to utilize Akira Kurosawa's phrase).  Maybe you are one who goes to the cinema to kill time, see what's being talked about and such, and/or who rents/buys DVDs for similar reasons.  If so, all the power to you. I'm not a killjoy, after all; but with television providing the same fare, why not (at least sometimes) seek something different from the amazing breadth of motion pictures that is available to one?  This film about Mr. Wallenberg is instructive herein.  In it we are almost literally transported to World War Two Budapest (without seeing much of that beautiful city actually being beside the point).  Stalin was right: a million deaths is a statistic.  It is something almost impossible to fathom without great effort.  But an individual's death can be understood, in contradistinction.  That's why it's helpful thinking of the Holocaust not as a 6 million death event; but rather as the brutal murder of single family (of 2, 3, 5, 7 people) in cold blood---multiplied by a factor of 1, 2, or 3 million (depending on what you visualize a family unit's size to be).  That's why this film is relevent.  In it we see individuals whose lives hang in the balance as the actor portraying the real-life Swedish hero, Raoul Wallenberg, goes about trying to protect those at the mercy of Fascist forces.  No, this film isn't epic in its particulars---we don't see a lot of events and such---but we do see several events of a personal nature.  Some may call that boring; but it is, instead, more harrowing & educational, especially if one can make that leap and imagine what one is seeing is, in fact, being played out exponentially, simultaniously.  I can't help but think of the film Saving Private Ryan"" in this context; for in that film we barely knew who Tom Hanks was supposed to be fighting against.  Yes, it was the Germans, but Hitler and the Nazi totalitarian state didn't seem to figure into the equation that much; being eclipsed by the story of some soldiers fighting simply to reach---& ""save"" (for that soldier's family) one private by the name of Ryan.  Sure, it's a well made film and all that, but it hardly speaks volumes in comparison to a film such as ""Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg.""  Do view it, if you get the opportunity to do so.  Do also see ""The Wannsee Conference,"" a German film about a meeting of Nazi leadership concerning Jews in Europe.  And read ""Babi Yar,"" a great book about life in Ukraine as the Nazis invade and occupy it---that is, if you have an intellectual interest about such things.  If so, maybe my ""So You'd like to Viscerally Experience World War Two"" Amazon list might be of interest to you for more suggestions (accessible by clicking on my name and thence onto my ""So You'd Like to"" lists.)

717153,AAPA4KQWA7UXN,B00006IUHK,cvairag,"[5, 6]","Raoul Wallenberg is a prototypical hero of our times.  His extraordinary expression of altruism immediately preceeds the activist of our post-modern era, and stands as a shining example. He was unquestionably one of the greatest men of his day, and living proof that activism is perhaps the highest form of spiritual activity to which one can aspire in the contemporary world.  Perhaps there is another film about Raoul Wallenberg. If so, I am not aware of it, and that there is such a fine film about this relatively little known giant (especially for younger generations and many non-Europeans)in itself gives this film value.Further, the film is well-acted, well-made. There are a number aspects that I particularly like.  The film works well within a limited budget. The cinematography (the shooting, editing, etc.) is excellent.  The film is quite staged - much in the tradition of the French Existentialist Theatre of Beckett, Artaud, Jarre, and much against the realist trend which really takes off in the 1970's in the wake of Hitchcock, Bresson, Peckinpaw, and many others. Waiting for Eichmann feels like Waiting for Godot. The script has this theatrical feel, as well.  The film starts very slowly and builds through a series of powerful siloquies and dialogs. As contrarian as the whole production is in this sense, it works quite well within the context which was highly existential. The film is thus more thought provoking than sensationally provocative, which seems to have been lost on a number of reviewers.  The Absurdity plays as much a role in the turning of events as the obvious Brutality, with which we are all unfortunately familiar.In my opinion, the two most affecting scenes: A little boy wearing the Star of David emerges from hiding and is held at gunpoint by a huge battalion of Nazis.  The climax where Wallenberg confronts the SS officer in charge of the annihilation of tens of thousands, and stops him from fulfilling his orders by bringing him face to face with his own humanity, as they share an umbrella in the rain. Thus, the secret of successful non-violent activism is revealed - a great scene, worth far, far more than the pittance the film is selling for these days.",5,An enlightening classic,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,2208,"['Raoul', 'Wallenberg', 'prototypical', 'hero', 'times', 'extraordinary', 'expression', 'altruism', 'immediately', 'activist', 'post-modern', 'era', 'shining', 'example', 'was', 'unquestionably', 'one', 'greatest', 'men', 'day', 'living', 'proof', 'activism', 'perhaps', 'highest', 'form', 'spiritual', 'activity', 'one', 'can', 'aspire', 'contemporary', 'world', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'Raoul', 'Wallenberg', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'aware', 'such', 'fine', 'film', 'relatively', 'little', 'known', 'giant', 'especially', 'younger', 'generations', 'many', 'non-Europeans', 'film', 'value.Further', 'film', 'well-acted', 'well-made', 'are', 'number', 'particularly', 'film', 'well', 'limited', 'budget', 'cinematography', 'shooting', 'editing', 'etc', 'excellent', 'film', 'quite', 'staged', 'much', 'tradition', 'French', 'Existentialist', 'Theatre', 'Beckett', 'Artaud', 'Jarre', 'much', 'realist', 'trend', 'really', 'off', '1970', 'wake', 'Hitchcock', 'Bresson', 'Peckinpaw', 'many', 'others', 'Waiting', 'Eichmann', 'feels', 'Waiting', 'Godot', 'script', 'theatrical', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'very', 'slowly', 'series', 'powerful', 'siloquies', 'dialogs', 'As', 'contrarian', 'whole', 'production', 'sense', 'quite', 'well', 'context', 'was', 'highly', 'existential', 'film', 'thus', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking', 'sensationally', 'provocative', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'number', 'reviewers', 'Absurdity', 'as', 'much', 'role', 'turning', 'events', 'obvious', 'Brutality', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'familiar.In', 'opinion', 'two', 'most', 'affecting', 'scenes', 'little', 'boy', 'wearing', 'Star', 'David', 'emerges', 'hiding', 'held', 'gunpoint', 'huge', 'battalion', 'Nazis', 'climax', 'where', 'Wallenberg', 'SS', 'officer', 'charge', 'annihilation', 'tens', 'thousands', 'fulfilling', 'orders', 'bringing', 'face', 'face', 'own', 'humanity', 'share', 'umbrella', 'rain', 'Thus', 'secret', 'successful', 'non-violent', 'activism', 'revealed', 'great', 'scene', 'worth', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'pittance', 'film', 'selling', 'days']",N/A

It's cinematography is bleak and drab, I'm sure much like the time and place it portrays.  It is also oh so highly philosophical as most European films are.  We never truly feel the horror of the Holocaust in this film as it was, because the filmmaker never fully engages the audience.  The motivations of Raoul Wallenberg are never clearly defined here and it's difficult to track any character development.  I believe it would have helped if we knew more about the characters' backgrounds in order to produce a better sense of empathy.  I would also liked to have seen more of what happened (or at least what's speculated) to Wallenberg after he left Hungary.  People talk about the banality of evil and that certainly applies in this case to the Nazis.

717158,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B00006IUHK,Kerry Walters,"[7, 9]","Kjell Grede's ""Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg"" is a noble but ultimately flawed effort.  The story focuses on the efforts of Raoul Wallenberg to save Jews in Budapest during WWII's final days.  Although he comes from one of Sweden's wealthiest families, there's nothing outstanding about Raoul.  He's an ordinary guy with ordinary talents who hasn't done anything remarkable; as the film begins, he's an importer of luxury foods.  But on a train trip, he happens to see Jewish corpses being tossed out of a death camp-bound freight car, and a father, who jumped out of the car to be with his dead son, shot and killed.  This experience changes Raoul's life.  As he tells the skeptical committee considering him for relief work, it's only in that moment that he feels he's ever actually lived.Grede's film focuses on the very last days of Wallenberg's Hungarian mission:  the exhausting scramble to bribe German and Hungarian officials, racing against the clock to try to save the Jewish ghetto, a dramatic standoff with a Hungarian fascist, despair alternating with hope, and finally Wallenberg's mysterious disappearance into the Soviet Union.The best moments of the film are when Stellan Skarsgard (Wallenberg) and Katharina Thalberg (Marja) are on-screen.  Thalberg is especially good as the Jewish woman whose children have been killed and who refuses to wear anything but a man's overcoat because, when the Germans come to kill her, she wants them to see her naked, as a real person rather than a statistic.  Skarsgard, whose acting style is low-key anyway, plays Wallenberg with a subdued intensity that seems just right.But ultimately, neither Skarsgard nor Thalberg can save the film.  The writing tends at times to be melodramatic--ruining, for example, the final confrontation between Wallenberg and the Hungarian fascist.  There's too little exposure of Wallenberg's interior, so his motives for risking life and limb to save Jews remain a bit cloudy (despite the ""It's only in that moment that I've lived"" scene).Still, the film is worth seeing.

717164,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00006IUHK,Z Hayes,"[11, 11]","Raoul Wallenberg is one of the righteous Gentiles, who was willing to risk everything for the sake of standing up to Nazi atrocities. What makes his story truly remarkable is the fact that he was just an ordinary person, not even a very high ranking officer in the Swedish diplomatic corps, but who used whatever leverage he had to provide safe passage to persecuted Jews in WWII Hungary. At the beginning of the movie, we see how the Jews view him as an invincible saviour, but this later changes as they come to realise the reality of the situation, that it is by his pure force of will and character that he does what he does to save them. It is a hard movie to watch as we see Wallenberg continually come up against one obstacle after another in trying to save as many Jews as possible. On the other hand, we witness the glee with which the Hungarian Arrow Cross execute hapless Jews, men, women and even children. The Hungarian civilian population is also depicted as willing participants in the atrocities committed against the Jews, egging on the execution squad as they mow down innocents. Stellan Skarskard's portrayal of Wallenberg was somber and effective, his pain & frustration at not being able to do more is clearly evident throughout the film. Yes, there are better adaptations out there, even better Holocaust movies, but this one is worth watching too. It helps us understand better the man that was Raoul Wallenberg, a hero of the Holocaust who survives the Nazis, only to fall victim to Stalin's regime.",5,When one man made a difference,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,1523,"['Raoul', 'Wallenberg', 'one', 'righteous', 'Gentiles', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'risk', 'everything', 'sake', 'standing', 'up', 'Nazi', 'atrocities', 'What', 'story', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'fact', 'was', 'just', 'ordinary', 'person', 'not', 'even', 'very', 'high', 'ranking', 'officer', 'Swedish', 'diplomatic', 'corps', 'who', 'used', 'leverage', 'had', 'provide', 'safe', 'passage', 'persecuted', 'Jews', 'WWII', 'Hungary', 'beginning', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'Jews', 'view', 'invincible', 'saviour', 'later', 'changes', 'come', 'realise', 'reality', 'situation', 'pure', 'force', 'will', 'character', 'what', 'save', 'hard', 'movie', 'watch', 'see', 'Wallenberg', 'continually', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'obstacle', 'trying', 'save', 'many', 'Jews', 'possible', 'other', 'hand', 'witness', 'glee', 'Hungarian', 'Arrow', 'Cross', 'execute', 'hapless', 'Jews', 'men', 'women', 'even', 'children', 'Hungarian', 'civilian', 'population', 'also', 'depicted', 'willing', 'participants', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Jews', 'egging', 'execution', 'squad', 'mow', 'down', 'innocents', 'Stellan', 'Skarskard', 'portrayal', 'Wallenberg', 'was', 'somber', 'effective', 'pain', 'frustration', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'more', 'clearly', 'evident', 'film', 'Yes', 'are', 'better', 'adaptations', 'there', 'even', 'better', 'Holocaust', 'movies', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'too', 'understand', 'better', 'man', 'was', 'Raoul', 'Wallenberg', 'hero', 'Holocaust', 'who', 'Nazis', 'only', 'fall', 'victim', 'Stalin', 'regime']",N/A
