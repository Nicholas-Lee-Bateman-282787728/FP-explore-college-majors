1315020,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B0030BKNIK,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[10, 12]","In this movie, Emilie meets Gabriel on a business trip. They are obviously attracted and spend a pleasant evening talking. Saying goodbye, Gabriel asks for a kiss. Emilie refuses -- and says she has a reason. She knows what one simple kiss can lead to. She proceeds to tell the story of her friends, Nicolas and Judith.Judith is apparently happily married, Nicolas is her best friend. His girlfriend has left him and he craves physical affection. Can Judith help him out, scratch his itch, as it were? Of course she can. The two proceed to embark on the weirdest love scene I've seen in some time. ""May I touch your left breast?"" asks Nicolas. ""Help yourself,"" replies Judith (or words to that effect). ""And your right breast?"" ""Be my guest."" Never have a couple spoken to each other so much, and so politely, while making love. Eventually it boils down to a kiss -- and abracadabra, magic ensues.Now Judith has a problem. Making love to Nicolas is an itch she can't stop scratching. They try to do it badly, mechanically, without feeling. It makes no difference. It's still fantastic.We follow these absurd people and their absurd dilemma with amusement, noting that this kind of movie could only happen in France and in French. I never lost interest -- and yet never got too invested in the characters and their endless talk.C'est tres amusanat, assez drole -- and a little silly.",3,"Talky, amusing and very Frrrench",1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,1382,"['movie', 'Emilie', 'Gabriel', 'business', 'trip', 'are', 'obviously', 'attracted', 'spend', 'pleasant', 'evening', 'talking', 'Saying', 'goodbye', 'Gabriel', 'kiss', 'Emilie', 'reason', 'what', 'one', 'simple', 'kiss', 'can', 'lead', 'tell', 'story', 'friends', 'Nicolas', 'Judith.Judith', 'apparently', 'happily', 'married', 'Nicolas', 'best', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'physical', 'affection', 'Can', 'Judith', 'help', 'out', 'scratch', 'itch', 'were', 'course', 'can', 'two', 'proceed', 'embark', 'weirdest', 'love', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'May', 'touch', 'left', 'breast', 'Nicolas', 'Help', 'Judith', 'words', 'effect', 'right', 'breast', 'Be', 'guest', 'Never', 'have', 'couple', 'spoken', 'other', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'politely', 'making', 'love', 'Eventually', 'down', 'kiss', 'abracadabra', 'magic', 'ensues.Now', 'Judith', 'problem', 'Making', 'love', 'Nicolas', 'itch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'scratching', 'try', 'do', 'badly', 'mechanically', 'feeling', 'difference', 'still', 'fantastic.We', 'follow', 'absurd', 'people', 'absurd', 'dilemma', 'amusement', 'noting', 'kind', 'movie', 'could', 'only', 'happen', 'France', 'French', 'never', 'lost', 'interest', 'yet', 'never', 'got', 'too', 'invested', 'characters', 'endless', ""talk.C'est"", 'tres', 'amusanat', 'assez', 'drole', 'little', 'silly']",Shall We Kiss?

This is a delightful bedroom farce in the tradition of Moliere, but brought up to date with attractive people of the young professional middle class. All are employed (pharmacists, teachers, etc.), all calm, all well behaved, and all thoroughly bourgeois as they gently get one another in a lot of trouble. Fun and sweet. Also a meditation on the universal tendency for both men and woman to be less than monogamous.

1315024,A1CZKOSULDV3VT,B0030BKNIK,Literato,"[2, 2]","If you read Candide, you remember Pangloss' contorted reasoning and idiotic explanations. I have refused to see this movie because of the stupid title (""Shall We Kiss""), which by the way is more like ""A kiss, please!"" in French. A much more provocative and accurate title would have been ""Playing with Fire,"" which is the subject of this gem of a film, looking beyond marriage for love.Now back to Dr. Pangloss... If you know the French, they discuss philosophy and phenomenology endlessly, and they are so polite (until they turn and insult you). So this lovely film is a pastiche of how the French intellectualize everything. The quartet of actors is top-notch and endlessly amusing, and the script is brilliant. Enjoy the quiet laughter - this is a masterpiece... best thing to come out of France in years. If you don't believe me, see it on Amazon Prime first. Enjoy!BTW, if you liked this you will have a GRAND time watching the adorable and hilarious Audrey Tautou in one of the funniest comedies I can remember - Priceless. It keeps getting funnier and you won't succeed in suppressing your laughter, which will get loud at times.

Foreign movies that do make it onto a video store shelf do tend to be of a good quality.Set in Nantes, a man randomly meets a woman looking for directions to a taxi, attractive, elegant, desirable as a French woman can be.  He walks away but then changes his mind, and offers her a ride.  She is in town for only a day, and lives far away. When they arrive at her hotel, he says goodbye and then turns to walk away, and again changes his mind.They engage, and have a stimulating encounter in a restaurant, and the parallel story of why they can't engage further emerges, and I must admit this story had me hooked all the way through, and you wonder what will happen right to the end, as the fate of one story hangs on the other. I love that element of unpredictability, and as the movie progresses you become progressively more intrigued by these characters.This is definitely one of the more interesting foreign movies I have seen.  The 4 beautiful French actresses are amazing, and give great elegant and poised performances. I hope you find this review helpful. Go ahead and watch it.

(""Un Baiser S'il Vous Plait""; 102 min., originally released in France in 2008, finally released in the US in 2010) brings several stories within a story. Gabriel meets Emilie by chance when she is on a business trip in Nantes, and they hit it off immediately. Gabriel wants to kiss Emilie upon their farewell, but Emilie refuses, for reasons she explains in a flashback of another couple's story, her friend Judith and her husband, and Judith's eventual romantic involvement with her best friend Nicolas. There is one final twist towards the very end, which I won't give away here (you'll just have to see it for yourself). Remember, this is a French movie, and hence a lot of talking for talking's sake.I enjoyed this movie, but was not blown away by it.

If you love French style and humor you'll love this; otherwise probably don't bother.  It's talky, it's a little philosophical and it's done with great wit and taste.  The story involves a chance meeting between a man and a woman in Nantes, both of whom are involved with other partners.  They are strongly attracted to each other though, and end up spending an evening together talking.  When he asks for a kiss, in a very polite way, she refuses him and then, when pressed, tells him why.  This involves the story of two of her friends, Judith and Nicholas, whose friendship was sorely taxed when she gives him an innocent kiss.I won't spoil the fun for you. It's a clever story and will hold your interest until the very end.  (I loved the end!)  It's a beautifully constructed film, visually.  I loved the costumes....everyone wore shades of white, ivory or, in the end, brown.  Nicholas' Burberry plaid scarf was repeated, briefly, in the lining of Judith's husband's raincoat.  The art on the walls was very interesting, especially a large photograph of Schubert.  In one scene Nicholas is standing next to the photo and they look amazingly similar.  There is wonderful classical music throughout, Schubert and others.  The cast is first rate.The translation of the title is unfortunate, as is the picture on the DVD cover.
