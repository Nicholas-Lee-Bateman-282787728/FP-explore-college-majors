Despite all of this interest, I have to admit that I couldn't even get through the first 15 minutes of this TV mini-series.

Yes, denizens of Amazon-com, welcome to the not-so-wonderful world of ""The Last Templar"". I just finished watching the first episode, and I'm somewhat sceptical about watching the rest!Tess Chaykin isn't very convincing as feminist vigilante. I mean, she's no Lisbeth Salander, is she? The constant flirtation between Ms. Chaykin and Catholic choirboy Sean Reilly is embarrassing, to say the least, and please note the name of the priest: De Angelis. You're kidding, right? But then, the religious fanatic in ""End of Days"" was named Thomas Aquinas!And why is the hired assassin a Black man? I thought Canada would be politically correct by now...Thank God I'm not a Catholic. I would have been even more annoyed by ""The Last Templar"" if I had been. Perhaps I would have attacked the New York Metropolitan wielding a sword and a somewhat knightly outfit? Being of the feminist persuasion, I was more annoyed by Tess dressed in sexist garb chasing the virile knights on horseback. That's feminist? Sheesh. Looks more like a comic flick from the old fifties.I'm intrigued by the high ratings this production has gotten on Amazon. Can't people tell the difference between a good show and pure bunk?

1234543,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B001RXDM1I,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is a unique perspective on a movie made from a book. I am in the middle of reading the book right now, and decided to check Amazon's lists because it seemed such a natural for being made into a movie. It was. So I ordered it, and it came, and I watched it. Right in the middle of reading the book.First, there are a lot of changes, so I don't know if the second half of the movie tells me all that much about the second half of the book. Since I've long accepted that a book has to be changed to put it on a movie screen, I tried not to be disappointed. Objectively, the movie is well made and exciting, even if it over-simplifies the rather amazing complexity of the book.The first of two main characters is Tess Chaykin (Mira Sorvino), an archeologist who is way too pretty to be taken for an archeologist in that short cocktail dress in which she first appears, all glitter and fancy high heels. She's at the museum in New York to attend the opening of the Treasures of the Vatican exhibit when four horsemen dressed in Knights Templar costumes ride their horses right up the steps and into the museum. What are they doing? Causing mayhem, of course, but rather different mayhem than in the book.The second main character is FBI agent Sean Daley (Scott Foley), who was there to protect the treasures and is therefore responsible for what happened when the Four Horsemen smashed display cases and stole gem-encrusted gold artifacts, including one which Tess's archeologist father had discovered. Naturally, she couldn't let them get away with that.Again, nowhere near the same as the book, but it did simplify into a few minutes what took a lot of time and the involvement of several people in the book. Sorry if I'm harping on the differences; they sort of stand out at times.One of the people injured in the melee was Clive Edmonston (Anthony Lemke), apparently connected with the museum or the exhibit or something (not obvious to me), and spends the rest of the movie with his broken arm in a cast that supports his arm up at shoulder height and bent forward, braced against his side with a wide leather belt. Does he need a baby-sitter? OK, Tess's precocious 10-year-old daughter Kim (Rebecca Windheim) will look after him while Tess and Sean go off chasing (1) the treasure of the Templars and (2) the villain that masterminded the raid on the museum.Ah, but is he a villain? And who is the shadowy character that's trying to kill him? Who does he work for, and why? These were things I knew from the book, but it did not lessen the impact of the story one bit. When a reservoir in the book was traded for a valley of volcanic ash, I knew I couldn't count on the ending at all. Personally, I'm looking forward to finishing the book.Enjoy this movie.

No they don't have the budget ofNational Treasure (Widescreen Edition), so you can't expect the same level of acting, sets, and effects.

I certainly don't regret renting it and I am considering adding it to our library.When a young female archeologist, played by Mira Sorvino, is tracking down the treasure of the last templars she finds her life complicated by those that either want it themselves or those that don't want it found. She finds assistance from a variety of people that may not seem likely champions for her cause.

I didn't attempt to ""make sense"" of its plot because I knew going in that wouldn't be a consideration (in the end, I had to overlook the ending....both of them).  Amusingly, if anyone comes off poorly during the course of this movie it's the FBI, not the Catholics.  Consider: the bad guys outwit them continuously, an old coot outwits them, Mira's character outwits them; this was a terrible endorsement for the FBI any way you look at it (or, maybe just that agent, played by Scott Foley?).I wasn't that crazy about the flashbacks; they kept intruding and mucking up the flow of things.  There were also too many plot devices that felt exactly like plot devices (the kiss you knew would be coming, the ceiling falling in at that exact moment when it obviously stayed in place for hundreds of years, the agent having a `Poe' moment....).

Only before the good guys open The Mummy's tomb, they decide, ""You know what, it was buried for a reason. God's will closed this thing for a reason, and we shouldn't mess with god. Let's leave it and go home born again Christians"". That's pretty much how this movie goes. A woman is on the hunt to find lost writings from an ancient race of people known as the Templars while a priest and his hit-man henchman are on their tail to stop them from discovering a lost chapter of the bible that could reveal that Jesus was just a man and that religion is a sham.The movie sucks you in until the end of the movie where the woman who discovers the writings becomes a born again christian and doesn't want to read the writings and decides the world should remain believing in what they want to beleive. I felt cheated, because the movie was going nicely as a believable story, and all of a sudden the writer thinks what he/she has written is sacrilegious and begs for forgiveness with the fear of god inside him/her and quickly changes the outcome in favor of religious nonsense.If Indiana Jones suddenly figured ""Nah, better not go there, let god sort them out"" then you would have a very anti-climactic movie, right?

Then again if I had known a little more of the plot, I wouldn't have watched it at all. Glad I never read the book someone gave me. If you want to waste your 3 plus hours of your life, intellectual perception, enjoy propaganda fiction, and get a distorted picture of history, rent it.On a more enlightened note, it would be more accurate to rationally fictionalize that the Last Templar movie is sponsored by multiple atheist organizations which produced this slap stick historically fictional movie and who actually have a propaganda agenda to flatulence.  Now a movie about an atheist organization conspiracy within `Holywood'...that would be a great Film!!! I wonder if it would make it to the Sundance Film Festival?

There is no need to consider this as a 'message film' (even if the theme concerns matters of faith and 'control of the truth,' both vitally important human issues, to be sure.)  If such questions are raised that provoke conversation, it is a credit to the screenwriter (or to the author of the book this adventure is based upon).  But I honestly don't feel that any such 'agenda' lies behind this film, and reviews that focus on religious or historical questions are missing the point.Mira Sorvina is a talented actress and manages to pull off the leading role here with humor, intelligence, and lots of energy (it's a physically challenging role!)  The relationship she forms with the FBI agent assigned to the case (Scott Foley) works well and avoids coming across as 'caricature, which is a credit to both actors' abilities with a script that could easily have gone that way in less-talented hands.If there is any 'message' to be found here, let it be the portrait of the simple, kind man that Omar Sharif plays near the end of the film. ""Joy is joy, life is life..,"" he says, and he offers up an example of 'simple truths' to live by.  Nice touch.This is a thoroughly enjoyable mini-series, and one that is suitable for family viewing.

After reading the book I decided to revisit the movie on DVD, and my initial impression held true. That said, I do have three caveats: (1) At nearly three hours, it's about a third longer than necessary; (2) two scenes where Sorvino's character turns into an action heroine (the joust at the beginning, and the subterranean smackdown with the menacing thugs) just didn't ring true; and (3) the nature of the Templar's secret should have been spelled out more clearly at the end.

It is based on the novel by Raymond Khoury, who must be kicking himself for allowing his name to be attached to this Dan Brownesque tripe. It supposedly starts with four `crusaders' riding into a Vatican Exhibition in modern day New York, they behead a police officer before riding into the building and stealing a load of priceless artefacts.Then our heroine Tess Chaykin (Mira Sorvino) grabs a Crozier and a police horse and charges off to joust with one of them. This is whilst the NYPD stand around doing nothing - yeah right. Then the FBI gets involved in the shape of Sean Daley (Scott Foley). What develops is a plot that is so implausibly bad that it will make your eyes water. This is all about the Knights Templar and their hidden treasure which has been oft speculated about. We have a tale of three Templar's back in 1291 escaping from Jerusalem via a river, Jerusalem is land locked and has no river. They then watch it burn from the sea. Yep they had pretty good vision in those days as its is some 30 odd miles from the coast.Then they get shipwrecked but manage to make it to shore in full chain mail where they bury something that will undermine the entirety of the scriptures and therefore Christianity. Then back to modern day and the hapless Ms Sorvino who gets emotionally attached to the FBI bloke and heads off to Bodrum in Turkey which despite claims from the Turkish Tourist Board that is lush, green and a modern city, turns out to be a desert where people can not even speak Turkish. They uncover more plot and find out that the Vatican is involved and a rogue archaeologist puts in another appearance to add some excessive `ham' to the whole proceedings.This was made for TV and was shown in two episodes, that is why it is in two parts on the DVD and you need to go back to the menu to see the second part, but trust me it aint worth the effort. Even if you suspend belief it is still a wafer thin plot, the acting is below average to over the top shouting. The plot holes are excessive, we even have a Jeep that explodes after being hit by another car - I mean come on guys. Then there are the tame rats, some pointless padding and the historical gaffs just make for an excruciating experience. Only plus is that Omar Sharif puts in a good performance for about ten minutes of this three hour dross,. Yes it is three hours long and requires nerves of steel to get through the lot; luckily I rented this and had to watch in two sittings with a few beers for stamina on the second round.
