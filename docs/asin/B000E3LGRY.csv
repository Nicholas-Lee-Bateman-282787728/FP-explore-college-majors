Adults may find it saccharine-heavy, but it is a good film for the family to enjoy together.  A good cast consisting of Charles Durning, Janine Turner, Patrick Muldoon and an over the top Lesley Ann Warren bring some life to the pedestrian script, and all in all, should be entertaining as family viewing.",3,TERMINALLY CUTE FAMILY FILM,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,456,"['ultrasweet', 'sequel', 'MIRACLE', 'DOGS', 'two', 'spaniels', 'who', 'have', 'miraculous', 'ability', 'heal', 'how', 'stumbled', 'young', 'boy', 'life', 'Adults', 'may', 'find', 'saccharine-heavy', 'good', 'film', 'family', 'enjoy', 'together', 'good', 'cast', 'consisting', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'Janine', 'Turner', 'Patrick', 'Muldoon', 'top', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'bring', 'life', 'pedestrian', 'script', 'should', 'be', 'entertaining', 'family', 'viewing']",Miracle Dogs Too

It's a happy, inspiring story for all ages about a young boy named Zack that finds a pair of ""miracle"" dogs.Of course, there's more to the story than that. The boy just moved to a new town with his mother and sister, following his parent's divorce. The mother is working at a local nursing home and finding a romantic interest in a local doctor. The sixteen year old sister is being pursued by two separate guys (one played by Preston Jones, who manages to take the possibly innocuous character of Josh, the jock next door, and turn him into a memorable and realistic three dimensional person). Definitely keep an eye out for Preston Jones in other work. Also, Jaleel White shows up for a few scenes. (Remember him as Urkle from Family Matters?)The DVD doesn't offer any extras, but for families looking for a feel good movie, Miracle Dogs Too is the way to go.",3,For family-friendly viewing only,1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,958,"['like', 'super', 'family', 'friendly', 'films', 'Miracle', 'Dogs', 'Too', 'will', 'definitely', 'fit', 'viewing', 'bill', 'happy', 'inspiring', 'story', 'ages', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Zack', 'pair', 'miracle', 'dogs.Of', 'course', 'more', 'story', 'boy', 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'town', 'mother', 'sister', 'following', 'parent', 'divorce', 'mother', 'working', 'local', 'nursing', 'home', 'finding', 'romantic', 'interest', 'local', 'doctor', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'sister', 'being', 'pursued', 'two', 'separate', 'guys', 'one', 'played', 'Preston', 'Jones', 'who', 'take', 'possibly', 'innocuous', 'character', 'Josh', 'jock', 'next', 'door', 'turn', 'memorable', 'realistic', 'three', 'dimensional', 'person', 'Definitely', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'Preston', 'Jones', 'other', 'work', 'Also', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'up', 'few', 'scenes', 'Remember', 'Urkle', 'Family', 'Matters', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'offer', 'extras', 'families', 'looking', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'Miracle', 'Dogs', 'Too', 'way', 'go']",Miracle Dogs Too
