Certainly, as middle-aged director Bob Cilman controls the play list, numbers like Sonic Youth's ""Schizophrenia"" seem forced and of little interest to the seniors who sing the songs.  Yet, as we see in the 1:40 documentary, there are members of the senior singing troupe who will dare the ghost, just out of the emergency room and sent home, who will not want to miss a single practice.It all started in a senior center in 1984, where seniors would do a singing performance.  A senior performer bucked the usual trend and did a version of Manfred Mann's ""Doo Wah Diddy Diddy"" that ""brought the house down.""  In an overview, we find they like to sing and listen to music that we'd expect from them: opera, show tunes, and traditional pop songs.  But with some expression and a mixture of the traditional with the progressive, the choir meets a young stage band to give a spirited Broadway appeal to songs like James Brown's ""I Feel Good,"" Bob Dylan's ""Forever Young,"" and Sinead O'Connor's ""Nothing Compares 2 U"".Sometimes it all feels like a long, bad joke.  How can you not feel objections when Cilman injects songs like The Ramones' ""I Want to Be Sedated"" and The Bee Gee's ""Stayin' Alive"".  For that matter Cilman seems self-indulgent, insisting on his favorite Talking Heads' songs, including a senior rendition of ""Life During Wartime"".  Yet, the medium focuses on the lives of the seniors, their takes on the rehearsals, shows, and the music.  As one formidable figure tells us, ""I want to expand my horizons.""Still, Cilman, described as a taskmaster, tells one man, ""I don't need you to make fun of the song.""  He needs to do what is necessary to put on the show, certainly, but he does show caring concern as well.Videos intersperse the rehearsals and interviews, and the actual shows are brimming with anticipation and jitters for the results.What certainly could have been exploitative and cheap turns to inspirational and fun-loving.  Often times we measure seniors according to their ability to stay young, but at least 'Young @ Heart' keeps us absorbed and interested in the participants whose wisdom should keep us only hoping for more shows to come.A J.P.'s Pick 4*'s = Very Good",4,Good @ Heart,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,2246,"['Young', '@', 'Heart', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'bad', 'taste', 'Certainly', 'middle-aged', 'director', 'Bob', 'Cilman', 'play', 'list', 'numbers', 'Sonic', 'Youth', 'Schizophrenia', 'seem', 'forced', 'little', 'interest', 'seniors', 'who', 'sing', 'songs', 'Yet', 'see', '1:40', 'documentary', 'are', 'members', 'senior', 'singing', 'troupe', 'who', 'will', 'dare', 'ghost', 'just', 'emergency', 'room', 'sent', 'home', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'single', 'practice.It', 'started', 'senior', 'center', '1984', 'where', 'seniors', 'would', 'do', 'singing', 'performance', 'A', 'senior', 'performer', 'bucked', 'usual', 'trend', 'did', 'version', 'Manfred', 'Mann', 'Doo', 'Wah', 'Diddy', 'Diddy', 'brought', 'house', 'down', 'overview', 'find', 'sing', 'listen', 'music', ""'d"", 'expect', 'opera', 'show', 'tunes', 'traditional', 'pop', 'songs', 'expression', 'mixture', 'traditional', 'progressive', 'choir', 'young', 'stage', 'band', 'give', 'spirited', 'Broadway', 'appeal', 'songs', 'James', 'Brown', 'Feel', 'Good', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Forever', 'Young', 'Sinead', ""O'Connor"", 'Nothing', '2', 'U', 'feels', 'long', 'bad', 'joke', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'objections', 'when', 'Cilman', 'songs', 'Ramones', 'Want', 'Be', 'Sedated', 'Bee', 'Gee', 'Stayin', 'Alive', 'matter', 'Cilman', 'self-indulgent', 'insisting', 'favorite', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'songs', 'including', 'senior', 'rendition', 'Life', 'Wartime', 'medium', 'lives', 'seniors', 'rehearsals', 'shows', 'music', 'one', 'formidable', 'figure', 'want', 'expand', 'horizons', 'Still', 'Cilman', 'described', 'taskmaster', 'one', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'fun', 'song', 'do', 'what', 'necessary', 'put', 'show', 'certainly', 'show', 'caring', 'concern', 'well.Videos', 'rehearsals', 'interviews', 'actual', 'shows', 'are', 'brimming', 'anticipation', 'jitters', 'results.What', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'exploitative', 'cheap', 'turns', 'inspirational', 'fun-loving', 'Often', 'measure', 'seniors', 'according', 'ability', 'stay', 'young', 'least', ""'Young"", '@', 'Heart', 'keeps', 'absorbed', 'interested', 'participants', 'wisdom', 'should', 'keep', 'only', 'hoping', 'more', 'shows', 'come.A', 'J.P.', 'Pick', '4*', '=', 'Very', 'Good']",N/A

1171263,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001BBAVKQ,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","In the wrong hands, Young@Heart could have been a real mawkish tearjerker.  Instead, in the hands of skilled documentarian Stephen Walker and group founder and chorus leader, Bob Cilman, this film is a fabulous look at the creative process.  The spine of the production is a batch of new songs Cilman brings to the group at the inception of filming, with the goal of presenting them to the public within a matter of weeks.  Cilman's challenge is that for every group member like Joe - who memorizes and rips through the very complex Talking Heads piece ""Life During Wartime"" in a single day (wow, hats off) - there's the struggle to train members like Lenny, who - weeks in - still hasn't got down the timing nor the words to a single line of James Brown's ""I Feel Good"".Of course, group demographics being what they are, mortality intrudes a couple of time during the span of filming.  What Walker succeeds in doing is focusing not solely on the pain and pathos, but on what involvement meant to these members and to their families.  It might be trite to say ""they were doing what they loved,"" but Walker makes that point gently and effectively.Despite a glut of documentaries, this one hit the mark with the public:  it's grossed close to four million dollars in US box office and is still playing in select markets almost 20 weeks after its April 2008 debut.

This documentary does a great job of covering their preparation for a performance and selected individual stories of some of the members.  Not surprisingly, the health of some members are highlighted as these senior citizens must deal with challenges like heart disease and cancer.  It is inspiring to see people this age take on the challenge of working together to create a credible performance for their audiences.  They work as hard as any other amateur singing group and are led by a much younger man (who is probably in his late forties or early fifties) who has devoted his time and energy to the group.  It is inevitable that members of this group will pass away regularly becuase of their ages, and the impact of this is covered in the documentary.

Much of the doc is focused on the group's rehearsals that are taking place prior to a big upcoming show.

It's true.In a day with so much garbage being put out, this was a refreshing film to view - something true, too. It's a documentary about a group of old-timers (senior citizens, if you will) from Northampton, Mass., who tour and sing rock 'n roll. There is something absurd, outrageous, comical and entertaining about seeing an 89-year-old imitating James Brown and screaming, ""I Feel Good!"" What we witness in this two-hour documentary is both funny at times, but also sad. Hey, it's reality; life is hard, especially as you get older and older. Some of the members of this group die during the filming of it. The other men and women have to deal with these losses. ""The show must on,"" as the old saying goes, but it's not easy.The group sings rock standards and stuff that is pretty recent. It's hardly just Brown, the Ramones, Beatles, Bee Gees or Stones songs. It's also these old folks performing Sonic Youth, Coldplay, The Clash and the like.Of all the members, one can't but be most impressed with the voice of Fred Knittle, who has to sit and sing while having an oxygen tank next to him. His voice is really, really good. Then there is 92-year-old and spunky Eileen Hall and then there six-time cancer patient Joe Benoit, probably the nicest man you'd ever meet. All the people here are interesting.The more I watched this, the more respect I had for Bob Cilman, who directs this group. That man must have tremendous patience and a big, big heart for older people. It's frustrating when members keep forgetting their lines time and time again, but Bob presses on. He's called a ""taskmaster"" a few times but the group has great respect for him.Director Steven Walker does a super job putting this film together, holding some shots and cutting others off just at the right spots so we get the full effect of the humor or drama of a particular situation.

1171270,A3S6YZMZLUSLM0,B001BBAVKQ,Dean A. Anderson,"[13, 13]","Often when people explain why they don't like musicals they say, ""I just can't believe people would just be talking one minute and then break out into song the next."" These same people might not be bothered by loud explosions in space in a science fiction film or a man shooting a six shooter accurately a couple of hundred yards away in a western or a miracle amphibious vehicle that allows its passengers to survive not one but three falls over large waterfalls. But spontaneous song is going just too far.Maybe it's because we live in a society that spends much money for concerts and downloads to enjoy the music of others while fewer people are making music of their own.That's not a problem for the members of Young@Heart, a chorus depicted in the documentary movie of the same name. In 1982 this chorus group, whose members are all 70 years old or older, was founded. Initially they performed vaudeville songs like ""Yes, We Have No Bananas,"" but their director, Bob Cilman, pushed the chorus to try something different: rock and roll.Many of the chorus members had a preference for classical music, opera or the musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein. But they were willing to take on the challenge of music by the Talking Heads, David Bowie and the Clash (or as the 92 year old member Ellie refers to them, ""The Crash"".)The new songs are not always greeted with good cheer. When Cilman is asked how he thinks the members will react to Sonic Youth's ""Schizophrenia"" he cheerfully says ""They'll hate it."" But when interviewed, the members insist that the challenge of new music keeps their minds and voices active and alive.At times, though, I wondered how really new some to the music was to the members. The film was made in 2006. ""I Feel Good"" is introduced to the singers, and I was thinking that James Brown released that song in 1965. That means that chorus members in their 70's were in their thirties when the song was released. When Mick Jagger is going to turn 65 this year and Paul McCartney just turned the same age, and Elvis would have been eligible to be in Young@Heart if he had lived, it makes one wonder if rock and roll can still be considered a young person's game.And at times during the film I wondered if the filmmaker (Stephen Walker) and the audiences don't approach the chorus in a condescending manner (""Isn't it cute those old people singing rock songs!"") But the group's music is genuinely powerful. The music video of the group singing the Ramone's ""Sedated"" is energetic and funny. Coldplay's ""Fixed"" which was meant to be performed as a duet but becomes a solo is heartbreaking.The members of Young@Heart have a unique understanding of the command in the Psalm 96:1 ""Sing to the Lord a new song."" So many of us are content to listen to the oldies stations on the radio that play the music of our youth. In church, we want to sing only the songs we know. But that's not what God wants for us.

This is not just a cute movie about old people incongruously trying to sing rock songs. It is about people stretching beyond their own boundaries, and the boundaries imposed on them by the rest of us, to achieve results that are stirring and soulful. The ""Young at Heart"" Chorus is a Western Massachusetts musical phenemenon. Twenty some-odd singers, in their 70s, 80s and 90s, meet weekly or more to learn difficult and sometimes aurally painful new music. Led by young (only 53 year old) director Bob Cilman, the group has performed around the world, and also in its Northhampton home. This film follows the group in the 8 weeks prior to an Easter concert.The film is hilarious and full of heart. There are plenty of shots of oldsters being playful and even flirtatious. But the second half of the film achieves its depth by following former members who battle illness and self-doubt  as they prepare for one more shot on stage. The film includes plenty of on-the-scene shots of the chorus practicing, and a few hilarious music videos of their best songs. The ""Saturday Night Fever"" takeoff, shot in a bowling alley, is both a great musical achievement by these often-ailing singers, and a terrific send-up of the original.""Young at Heart"" is funny, full of genuine pathos and a crowd pleaser.

1171287,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001BBAVKQ,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Young@Heart tells the fantastic story of a group of chorus people--whose average age is 80--practicing for a one night concert in Northampton, Massachusetts. This documentary could be referred to as ""schmaltzy;"" but I for one found it to be riveting and charming. It held my attention every step of the way. Young@Heart is a film to be savored; this is not something you watch quickly and then discard. It tackles many more issues that just the preparations for a concert--that's just on the surface. We see the chorus group deal with the passing away of two of their members in the week before the concert; and how they insist on pressing on with the show despite their grief. These people may not be professionals; but their professional attitude more than makes up for it. When the theater is sold out--and you see them in concert--you'll know exactly why they were such a smash hit.We quickly meet members of the chorus and their younger leader (or, ""taskmaster,"") Bob Cilman. The personalities are fascinating to see and this documentary offers great insights as to what makes these people tick. In general, we see a great devotion to the group effort to put on a fine show no matter what. Indeed, even hospitalized seniors and other people receiving large blood transfusions don't even question or doubt that they will remain with the chorus for their concert. This type of devotion to the group effort is both touching and impressive. For example, we see Fred Knittle, who relies on oxygen and leads a fairly good life beyond the limits of what his doctors told him he would live, do an outstanding job singing a song dedicated to a group member who had recently passed away; and when they first hear James Brown's ""I Feel Good"" chorus member Dora B. Morrow positively flips out with enthusiasm about doing this song in concert!Equally impressive is their ability and desire to learn songs that are way out of their ""normal"" range of musical tastes. Many of the group members prefer classical and opera; but when presented by Bob Cilman with ""Schizophrenia"" by Sonic Youth and ""Purple Haze"" by Jimi Hendrix they don't hesitate to go along with the flow--and they actually do a very good job of learning these songs! They learn Joan Baez's ""Forever Young"" and they even perform a concert at a local jail that touches many of the inmates.Young@Heart has also done a European tour and when this was filmed they were actually planning another (albeit somewhat tentative) European tour. Excellent!The DVD has wonderful bonus features: we get two music videos that they perform with panache; and there's some excellent footage of their concert out in Hollywood, California which prompted one chorus woman to remark, ""I feel just like Marilyn Monroe!"" There are other extras, too.Young@Heart gives us a terrific look at just how rich and rewarding life can be in ""the golden years."" I highly recommend this inspiring documentary for people of all ages; if they went over as a sell out in Massachusetts they'll be sure to please you as well! The footage of them practicing for the big concert is absolutely amazing.

1171295,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001BBAVKQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","**SPOILERS**Has there ever been a more thoroughly lovable documentary than ""Young@Heart""?  We doubt it, though it would be hard to go wrong when the subject is a choir made up of high-spirited septuagenarians, octogenarians and even a couple of nonagenarians who travel around the world, singing not - as one might logically expect - old standards, but rather modern rock and even punk-rock tunes to wildly-applauding sold-out audiences.  Though most of the members of Young@Heart admit to preferring Brahms, Bach, and Rogers and Hammerstein to the likes of Coldplay, the Clash, and Sonic Youth, the enthusiasm and professionalism they bring to their work may belie that assertion somewhat.  Plus, it's the dichotomy between the age of the singers and the modernism of the material that gives the group its very special - and salable - raison d'etre.In 2007, British director Stephen Walker went to Massachusetts to document the group's preparation for their latest tour.  He shows us how these physically frail but emotionally indomitable old folk manage to forge on ahead, through all their aches and pains and life-threatening ailments, to produce something truly unique and beautiful in the entertainment world.  They may not always hit the right note, but their spirits shine through in every number.  Yet, Walker doesn't sentimentalize or patronize his subjects.  He lets us get to know them as individuals through their histories and their stories.  That goes for Bob Cilman, the group's then 53-year-old choir director, as well, a sometimes stern taskmaster with a full heart and an infinite capacity for patience.  And an obvious love for his choir members.There's humor, inspiration and heartbreak  embedded in virtually every frame of the film, with one scene, in particular - a performance by the group at a prison right after they've learned that one of their members has passed away - that is guaranteed to have you bawling like a baby.  It's the rendition of ""Forever Young"" that tears at the heartstrings in that instance, and it is a haunting solo performance of ""Nothing Compares 2 You,"" performed in honor of another member who dies immediately afterward, that produces the same effect just a few scenes later.But it's when they get on stage that the true magic happens - a symbiotic connection between the performers and their audience that is indeed a wonder to behold.Naturally, given the age of many of the choir's members, the movie ends on a bittersweet note, honoring those who didn't survive till the film's completion and release - most prominently, 93-year-old Eileen Hall, a prominent subject of the film who walks off with the movie and the audience`s heart.  The movie provides a fitting bit of immortality for this funny, big-hearted and life-affirming woman.All I can say is that if you ever need an instant pick-me-up or a renewal of your faith in humanity, ""Young@Heart"" is guaranteed to do the trick.",4,The ultimate feel-good crowd-pleaser,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,2937,"['**SPOILERS**Has', 'ever', 'been', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'lovable', 'documentary', 'Young', '@', 'Heart', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'subject', 'choir', 'made', 'high-spirited', 'septuagenarians', 'octogenarians', 'even', 'couple', 'nonagenarians', 'who', 'travel', 'world', 'singing', 'not', 'one', 'might', 'logically', 'expect', 'old', 'standards', 'rather', 'modern', 'rock', 'even', 'punk-rock', 'tunes', 'wildly-applauding', 'sold-out', 'audiences', 'most', 'members', 'Young', '@', 'Heart', 'admit', 'preferring', 'Brahms', 'Bach', 'Rogers', 'Hammerstein', 'likes', 'Coldplay', 'Clash', 'Sonic', 'Youth', 'enthusiasm', 'professionalism', 'bring', 'work', 'may', 'belie', 'assertion', 'somewhat', 'dichotomy', 'age', 'singers', 'modernism', 'material', 'group', 'very', 'special', 'salable', 'raison', ""d'etre.In"", '2007', 'British', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Walker', 'went', 'Massachusetts', 'document', 'group', 'preparation', 'latest', 'tour', 'how', 'physically', 'frail', 'emotionally', 'indomitable', 'old', 'folk', 'manage', 'forge', 'ahead', 'aches', 'pains', 'life-threatening', 'ailments', 'produce', 'something', 'truly', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'entertainment', 'world', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'hit', 'right', 'note', 'spirits', 'shine', 'number', 'Walker', ""n't"", 'sentimentalize', 'patronize', 'subjects', 'get', 'know', 'individuals', 'histories', 'stories', 'Bob', 'Cilman', 'group', 'then', '53-year-old', 'choir', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'sometimes', 'stern', 'taskmaster', 'full', 'heart', 'infinite', 'capacity', 'patience', 'obvious', 'love', 'choir', 'humor', 'inspiration', 'heartbreak', 'embedded', 'virtually', 'frame', 'film', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'performance', 'group', 'prison', 'right', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'one', 'members', 'passed', 'away', 'guaranteed', 'have', 'bawling', 'baby', 'rendition', 'Forever', 'Young', 'tears', 'heartstrings', 'instance', 'haunting', 'solo', 'performance', 'Nothing', '2', 'performed', 'honor', 'member', 'who', 'immediately', 'afterward', 'same', 'effect', 'just', 'few', 'scenes', 'later.But', 'when', 'get', 'stage', 'true', 'magic', 'symbiotic', 'connection', 'performers', 'audience', 'indeed', 'wonder', 'behold.Naturally', 'given', 'age', 'many', 'choir', 'members', 'movie', 'bittersweet', 'note', 'honoring', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'till', 'film', 'completion', 'release', 'most', 'prominently', '93-year-old', 'Eileen', 'Hall', 'prominent', 'subject', 'film', 'who', 'movie', 'audience', 's', 'heart', 'movie', 'fitting', 'bit', 'immortality', 'funny', 'big-hearted', 'life-affirming', 'woman.All', 'can', 'say', 'ever', 'need', 'instant', 'pick-me-up', 'renewal', 'faith', 'humanity', 'Young', '@', 'Heart', 'guaranteed', 'do', 'trick']",N/A

In addition to the 1hr 48 film, the DVD includes 25 minutes of ""deleted scenes"". But these aren't all excerpts of a few minutes. They include the FULL-LENGTH ""music videos"" for three of the songs, including my favorite ""I Will Survive"" filmed in a bowling alley!Want a sample? Go to [...] and type in Young@heart and watch one of the videos posted there.There's also a short 5-minute featurette on opening night of their sell out concert in their home town. (The Chorus had played all over the world for years but surprisingly, never performed in their home town.).If there ever was a film or DVD you could put on and gather the whole (and I mean  WHOLE family, from nine to ninety) and have something in common, this is it!
