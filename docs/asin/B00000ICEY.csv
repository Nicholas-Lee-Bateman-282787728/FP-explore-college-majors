This is the version that was shown on Cartoon Network in the 90'sYeah the fact that its cut/edited kinda sucks but I also own all of the Uncut so that doesn't bother me at all. I just wanted this for the original voice actors and music version that I grew up with. I wish they would have kept these voice actors and music for the uncut versions then I wouldn't have even needed to get this.If you loved DragonBall Z in the 90's and your an Original fan like I am, then this set is a great one for you. If you prefer to see the show how it was meant to be and or aired in Japan then by all means buy the uncut versions of this series.",5,90's Childhood Memories Brought Back,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,766,"['only', 'wanted', 'version', 'series', 'what', 'saw', 'TV', 'kid', 'voice', 'actors', 'better', 'music', 'better', 'version', 'was', 'shown', 'Cartoon', 'Network', ""90'sYeah"", 'fact', 'cut/edited', 'kinda', 'sucks', 'also', 'own', 'Uncut', 'that', ""n't"", 'bother', 'just', 'wanted', 'original', 'voice', 'actors', 'music', 'version', 'grew', 'up', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'voice', 'actors', 'music', 'uncut', 'versions', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'needed', 'get', 'loved', 'DragonBall', 'Z', '90', 'Original', 'fan', 'am', 'then', 'set', 'great', 'one', 'prefer', 'see', 'show', 'how', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'aired', 'Japan', 'then', 'means', 'buy', 'uncut', 'versions', 'series']",Dragon Ball Z - The Saiyan Conflict I - Episodes 1-25  VHS
503064,A8ZOY336SMSRE,B00000ICEY,Bradley Potts,"[5, 8]","Dragonball Z is an entertaining action ride that is aimed at children, but is very funny and entertaining for adults too.  It tells a saga, rather than being a collection of unrelated episodes.  As such, we get to see the  characters develop and grow.  Each adventure or event impacts the rest of  the series, rather than simply being forgotten.  For children, it should be  noted that the series has some violence in it.  There is a great deal of  fighting and characters do die, which brings me to my next point.  In  translating the series for American television, a great deal of effort has  been made to remove all references to death.  While this may be fine for  the kids, who may not realize what is going on, for adults watching the  series, it is almost painful to listen to them talk about the dead people  having been &quot;sent to another dimension&quot; or the crowded city as  having been evacuated before being blown up.  It is best just to ignore  these references and enjoy the story as it was meant to be told.",5,Suffers some in translation,951696000,"02 28, 2000",2000,1029,"['Dragonball', 'Z', 'entertaining', 'action', 'ride', 'aimed', 'children', 'very', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'too', 'saga', 'rather', 'being', 'collection', 'unrelated', 'episodes', 'such', 'get', 'see', 'characters', 'develop', 'grow', 'adventure', 'event', 'rest', 'series', 'rather', 'simply', 'being', 'forgotten', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'series', 'violence', 'great', 'deal', 'fighting', 'characters', 'do', 'die', 'next', 'point', 'translating', 'series', 'American', 'television', 'great', 'deal', 'effort', 'been', 'made', 'remove', 'references', 'death', 'may', 'be', 'fine', 'kids', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'what', 'going', 'adults', 'watching', 'series', 'almost', 'painful', 'listen', 'talk', 'dead', 'people', 'having', 'been', 'quot', 'sent', 'dimension', 'quot', 'crowded', 'city', 'having', 'been', 'evacuated', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'best', 'just', 'ignore', 'references', 'enjoy', 'story', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'told']",Dragon Ball Z - The Saiyan Conflict I - Episodes 1-25  VHS
503065,A2PDC6SESC021Q,B00000ICEY,Daniel,"[0, 2]",DBZ is one of the greatest animes for one reason...complexity.  The storyline in this series is the best I have ever heard of.  The first DBZ saga is where Goku learns about his alien heritage.  His son Gohan(which is Japanese for rice) is captured buy Saiyans(an alien race fixed n ruling the earth).  The problem is Goku is a Saiyan also.  The animation is top notch!  I would reccomend this more than the manga because the artwork in the manga stinks.  I think that the orginal Dragon Ball was better though...,5,Stellar Anime.,1031961600,"09 14, 2002",2002,513,"['DBZ', 'one', 'greatest', 'animes', 'one', 'reason', 'complexity', 'storyline', 'series', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'first', 'DBZ', 'saga', 'where', 'Goku', 'alien', 'heritage', 'son', 'Gohan', 'Japanese', 'rice', 'captured', 'buy', 'Saiyans', 'alien', 'race', 'fixed', 'n', 'ruling', 'earth', 'problem', 'Goku', 'Saiyan', 'also', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'would', 'reccomend', 'more', 'manga', 'artwork', 'manga', 'stinks', 'think', 'orginal', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'was', 'better']",Dragon Ball Z - The Saiyan Conflict I - Episodes 1-25  VHS
503066,A2CLUVY0XTPRZK,B00000ICEY,H. Thompson,"[18, 23]","INTRO:  To put it simply, I do not know why this is still being sold.  This DVD set was released by Pioneer when they originally had the rights to DBZ.  They edited the series so bad that its down below an average kid's level of watching.  This DVD set contains English-only episodes without the original Japanese audio tracks, so don't bother with it if you are a Dragon Ball Z otaku.  Normally I would go into detail about the DVDs but why bother in this case?SUGGESTION:  Toei in Japan is planning on releasing the original Dragon Ball Z episodes on DVD in mid 2003 and will be in two complete DVD box sets.  Each box set will contain 26 discs and split the series in half.  Whether or not they will have english at all on the dvds is too far to tell right now.  Each box set will cost a whopping 850$ though, so it might turn off some buyers.  My suggestion if you're not willing to shell out 1000$+ for DBZ on DVD at once, just buy the US DVDs, they have unedited versions of the original Japanese episodes as well as the new English version.  Also, FUNimation (the new holder of DBZ in america), has obtained the rights to do the first saga of DBZ over and uncut (fixing what Pioneer did).  So hopefully this little suggestion essay wasn't too confusing.  Well, good luck!",1,Complete waste of money...,1036713600,"11 8, 2002",2002,1278,"['INTRO', 'put', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'still', 'being', 'sold', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'Pioneer', 'when', 'originally', 'had', 'rights', 'DBZ', 'edited', 'series', 'so', 'bad', 'down', 'average', 'kid', 'level', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set', 'contains', 'English-only', 'episodes', 'original', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'tracks', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'are', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'otaku', 'Normally', 'would', 'go', 'detail', 'DVDs', 'why', 'bother', 'case', 'SUGGESTION', 'Toei', 'Japan', 'planning', 'releasing', 'original', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'DVD', 'mid', '2003', 'will', 'be', 'two', 'complete', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', 'box', 'set', 'will', 'contain', '26', 'discs', 'split', 'series', 'half', 'not', 'will', 'have', 'english', 'dvds', 'too', 'far', 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'box', 'set', 'will', 'cost', 'whopping', '850', 'might', 'turn', 'off', 'buyers', 'suggestion', ""'re"", 'not', 'willing', 'shell', 'out', '1000', '+', 'DBZ', 'DVD', 'once', 'just', 'buy', 'US', 'DVDs', 'have', 'unedited', 'versions', 'original', 'Japanese', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'English', 'version', 'Also', 'FUNimation', 'new', 'holder', 'DBZ', 'america', 'obtained', 'rights', 'do', 'first', 'saga', 'DBZ', 'uncut', 'fixing', 'what', 'Pioneer', 'did', 'So', 'hopefully', 'little', 'suggestion', 'essay', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'confusing', 'Well', 'good', 'luck']",Dragon Ball Z - The Saiyan Conflict I - Episodes 1-25  VHS
503067,A3GAY5VH2LDFWK,B00000ICEY,"Patrick A. Kellner ""PAK""","[2, 3]","The saiyan conflict is the beginning of the dragon ball Z saga which follows the original series Dragon Ball. Although it is the second series it is not necessary to watch the first series to get this one as some recap happens right away to let you know where things are. The story opens up with the original cast having a reunion after having been apart for a while. Goku's brother shows up at the reunion after flying in from outer space although Goku didn't even know that he had a brother. He finds out that he is actually an alien know as a Saiyan and that originally he was sent to earth as a baby (since earth is such a weak planet it would only require a saiyan baby) to eliminate all live on the planet so the planet could be sold. Raditz (Goku's brother) tells Goku he wants him to join him and to prove his loyalty he must eliminate 100 humans. Raditz takes goku's son to make sure the job gets done.The story moves on from there with lots of cool fight scenes and action. The initial episodes are slightly more like Dragon ball catering to a younger audience but it quickly moves on to good fight scenes and characters being sent to another dimension (Killed). The show is great and this series along with the following saga The Namek Saga, are amongst the best in the series and defiantly worth watching.",5,One of my favorite Anime's,1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,1317,"['saiyan', 'conflict', 'beginning', 'dragon', 'ball', 'Z', 'saga', 'original', 'series', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'second', 'series', 'not', 'necessary', 'watch', 'first', 'series', 'get', 'one', 'recap', 'happens', 'right', 'away', 'let', 'know', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'story', 'up', 'original', 'cast', 'having', 'reunion', 'having', 'been', 'apart', 'while', 'Goku', 'brother', 'up', 'reunion', 'flying', 'outer', 'space', 'Goku', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'had', 'brother', 'out', 'actually', 'alien', 'know', 'Saiyan', 'originally', 'was', 'sent', 'earth', 'baby', 'earth', 'such', 'weak', 'planet', 'would', 'only', 'require', 'saiyan', 'baby', 'eliminate', 'live', 'planet', 'planet', 'could', 'be', 'sold', 'Raditz', 'Goku', 'brother', 'Goku', 'join', 'prove', 'loyalty', 'must', 'eliminate', '100', 'humans', 'Raditz', 'goku', 'son', 'make', 'sure', 'job', 'done.The', 'story', 'moves', 'lots', 'cool', 'fight', 'scenes', 'action', 'initial', 'episodes', 'are', 'slightly', 'more', 'Dragon', 'ball', 'catering', 'younger', 'audience', 'quickly', 'good', 'fight', 'scenes', 'characters', 'being', 'sent', 'dimension', 'Killed', 'show', 'great', 'series', 'following', 'saga', 'Namek', 'Saga', 'are', 'best', 'series', 'defiantly', 'worth', 'watching']",Dragon Ball Z - The Saiyan Conflict I - Episodes 1-25  VHS
