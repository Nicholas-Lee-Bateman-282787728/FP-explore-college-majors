Do the disney-maniacs ever stop to think that all of the characters incorporated into this movie were/are non-disney to begin with? Ralph is a reference to Mario with the suspenders and bashing bricks or ""blocks."" You have Q-bert,Sonic yadda yadda yadda... and numerous references to video game characters and enviroments that were invinted long before disney ""created"" them.Still disney-ites flail their arms about,drool and look like they are on the brink of orgasm as they scream how ""original and innovative"" it all is.Oh and let's not forget the infamous ""BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!"" line. Has there ever been a disney/pixar movie were critics just flat out say ""It sucks."" No.Never.Disney can do no wrong.God apparently has mouse ears and woe to the unworthy follower who dares blaspheme Him! Remember that ""Robots"",""Cars 2"" and ""Lion King 3"" was also THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!! According to who exactly? A booger eating six year old?As far as using vidoe game nostalgia for humor;THAT's been done too. In The Simpsons,Family Guy,Robot Chicken and just about any comedy created by anyone who is a member of Gen X. But what do I know? Disney also apparently created the concept of vehicles being alive,and their windshields being eyes....they didn't steal that idea from Tex Avery. Know your cartoons and animators and you'll see that all the dis-biz is ""take a little of this from a little of that and stamp our name on it."" Throw in a little left propoganda from unfamily friendly characters...Sarah Silverman for instance (she created a special called Jesus Is Magic,which pretty much rips on Christianity)And who could forget the wise ""Fish are our friends not food!!"" battlecry by mega lesbian Ellen Degender-confused in Findiing Nemo.

The story in the Gita focuses on the warrior Arjuna who, at the moment the story begins, is about to sally forth into battle on behalf of his clan, the Pandavas.  The enemy clan, the Kauravas, contains people that Arjuna counts as relatives, friends, and teachers, which makes him hesitate about going into battle against them.  Seeking moral advice, Arjuna consults his charioteer, who turns out to be none other than Krsna--God himself.  Krsna tells Arjuna that, as a ksatriya (member of the warrior caste), Arjuna's dharma (in this context:  duty, role) is to act as a warrior, and to do so without thought for the fruits of his actions.  Arjuna must learn to embrace his nature, no matter what ugliness that might imply in the coming battle.""Wreck-It Ralph"" tells the story of a computer-game character, the eponymous Ralph (John C. Reilly), a bad guy who has been smashing the same apartment building in a game called Fix-It Felix for the past thirty years.  Ralph has finally had enough, and rejects his ordained programming (his dharma, if you will) in order to attain heroic good-guy status.  To do this, he seeks a medal that can be found in a different, more radically modern video game called Hero's Duty--an ultra-violent first-person shooter set in a bleak, dystopic future.  Ralph attains the medal by unconventional means, and through a series of mishaps, finds himself flung into the candy-coated world of Sugar Rush, a kart-racing game (yes:  game characters can leave their games at will, although if they die outside their own games, they can't respawn).  There, he encounters a precocious, obnoxious waif named Vannelope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) an aspiring kart-racer who, upon seeing Ralph's medal, devises her own plans for it.  But forces are conspiring against Vannelope:  the ruler of Sugar Rush, King Candy, has no intention of allowing her to race in his game, ostensibly because she is a ""glitch,"" i.e., an unruly program that shouldn't be in the game and that exhibits unpredictable, fritzy behavior.  Ralph and Vannelope go on a Bildungsroman-style voyage of self-discovery, learning about, and reconciling themselves with, their own inherent natures (""I know I'm a racer--I can feel it in my code!"" says Vanellope, referring to her own dharma).This movie is a comedy-adventure-fantasy, so on the grand level, it's fairly predictable.  But as feel-good movies go, I think it's entertainingly unpredictable in its details, has a good moral message, and is kid-friendly in the extreme.  A whole raft of 1980s-era and modern video-game characters make cameo appearances, and Jane Lynch (pugnacious Sue Sylvester on ""Glee"") steals the show as Sergeant Calhoun, a tough soldier who leaves Hero's Duty to fight the robotic evil that has invaded Sugar Rush.  The movie evokes other movies as well:  sharp viewers will see elements of ""Tron,"" ""The Matrix,"" and even ""Toy Story"" (the game characters in this movie have inner lives, just like the toys in ""Toy Story"").  Mario is conspicuously absent, but Bowser shows up.  And for me, as a religious-studies student, the Arjuna/Ralph parallel was impossible not to see.

The only drawback I saw when I first viewed the trailer was that Sarah Silverman was cast at what seemed like an extremely annoying character, which did not surprise me since I am not that fond of her comedy. Nevertheless, I jumped at the chance when my kids said they wanted to see this! The first thing I marveled at was the short cartoon that preceded the film, ""Paperman"" -- a simple story about a man who struggles to find a woman with whom he met early in his work day. This short is a wonderful testament to the yearning of breaking out of life's monotony and searching for something better. And that is a perfect warm-up for ""Ralph,"" a film itself that centers around this theme. Oh, and I WANT composer Christophe Beck's musical score for this (it's one of the best I've heard in years; including in feature films!)Ralph (Reilly) is a villain who yearns to break out of his ""bad guy persona"" and become a hero by winning a medal. The only problem is that, in his game, the medal ALWAYS goes to its protagonist Fix-It Felix, Jr. (McBrayer). So, despite great dangers of permanently erasing (dying) in another game, Ralph ventures to other game worlds so that he may win his medal. Along the way, of course, he meets various characters, including Lynch's Sergeant Calhoun and Alan Tudyk's King Candy. I could tell that by watching the trailer. What I didn't know was that this film would be such an ensemble piece, there would be an evil conspiracy subplot, and that I would come to LOVE Silverman's character, Vanellope von Schweetz, a character who is a wonderful role model for my girls and other little girls in a world where racing and ""boys stuff"" is still considered for boys. The role that Ralph takes on during the film is surrogate father or big brother to Vanellope, and I have to admit that at the very end of the movie, Ralph makes a move in which any father can relate and tears started to well in my eyes! This film has got wonderful performances, wonderful writing and classic video game characters (Q*Bert, Root Beer Tapper, Zangief) as well as voice cameos from well-known actors (Mindy Kaling, Ed O'Neill, Dennis Haysbert, Edie McClurg, Adam Carolla, and Horatio Sanz)!

1525451,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00742SXOM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","There are few films as delightfully `whole' as `Wreck-It Ralph' was last year.  It's the perfect mix of nostalgia with a clever twist and new age sentiments with ravishing visuals and emotional heart.  The amount of detail put into this film, the backstory, the backgrounds, the character interactions; it's spot on perfect and something that unveils itself even further each and every viewing.The film centers around Ralph, the villain in a game called `Fix-It Felix Jr.'.  In the game, Ralph is the brute who `wrecks' an apartment complex and Felix is the hero who races after him to fix his mess.  This isn't a problem, since it's his job, but after hours Ralph is still treated like an outcast, shunned by the other members of his game and forced to sleep in a dump.  Saddened by his life, Ralph decides that he no longer wants to be a `bad guy' but instead wants to be a hero.  This causes him to game jump, looking for a video game that will award him a medal, but this leads to serious trouble when he sneaks into an alien war game and accidentally transports an evil alien into a fun and happy racing game.  Upon entering `Sugar Land Rush' (the name of the racing game) he uncovers a dark plot against a spunky glitch named Vanellope and soon discovers that being a bad guy doesn't automatically make him a `bad guy'.The voice work is very good here, with John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Alan Tudyk and Jack McBrayer being perfect choices for their roles.  Jane Lynch basically plays herself, but we all love her so it's not a big deal.  The sets are nicely crafted and the attention to detail (which I mentioned before) is all the more reason to soak this one in.For me though, it is the beautiful moral that keeps me coming back to this special movie.  The amount of heart given to the film's development and the self-sacrificing spirit donned by the big hearted wrecking ball is such a beautiful thing to watch.  Yes, I cried.  My eyes started to tear as Ralph plunged himself towards the Mentos ceiling.Disney has done something really special here, creating a new `Toy Story' of sorts; an instant classic that is targeted at both boys and girls (my daughters LOVE this movie) as well as their parents (all the references to games I played in my youth gave me such a warm feeling) and one that is sure to entertain and engage us for years to come.",5,The best animated film of 2012!,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2360,"['are', 'few', 'films', 'delightfully', 'whole', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'was', 'last', 'year', 'perfect', 'mix', 'nostalgia', 'clever', 'twist', 'new', 'age', 'sentiments', 'ravishing', 'visuals', 'emotional', 'heart', 'amount', 'detail', 'put', 'film', 'backstory', 'backgrounds', 'character', 'interactions', 'spot', 'perfect', 'something', 'even', 'further', 'viewing.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Ralph', 'villain', 'game', 'called', 'Fix-It', 'Felix', 'Jr.', 'game', 'Ralph', 'brute', 'who', 'wrecks', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Felix', 'hero', 'who', 'fix', 'mess', ""n't"", 'problem', 'job', 'hours', 'Ralph', 'still', 'treated', 'outcast', 'shunned', 'other', 'members', 'game', 'forced', 'sleep', 'dump', 'Saddened', 'life', 'Ralph', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'instead', 'be', 'hero', 'game', 'jump', 'looking', 'video', 'game', 'will', 'award', 'medal', 'serious', 'trouble', 'when', 'alien', 'war', 'game', 'accidentally', 'evil', 'alien', 'fun', 'happy', 'racing', 'game', 'entering', 'Sugar', 'Land', 'Rush', 'name', 'racing', 'game', 'dark', 'plot', 'spunky', 'glitch', 'named', 'Vanellope', 'soon', 'discovers', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'make', 'bad', ""guy'.The"", 'voice', 'work', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Jack', 'McBrayer', 'being', 'perfect', 'choices', 'roles', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'basically', 'love', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'sets', 'are', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'attention', 'detail', 'mentioned', 'more', 'reason', 'soak', 'one', 'in.For', 'beautiful', 'moral', 'coming', 'back', 'special', 'movie', 'amount', 'heart', 'given', 'film', 'development', 'self-sacrificing', 'spirit', 'donned', 'big', 'hearted', 'wrecking', 'ball', 'such', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'watch', 'Yes', 'cried', 'eyes', 'started', 'tear', 'Ralph', 'plunged', 'Mentos', 'ceiling.Disney', 'done', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'here', 'creating', 'new', 'Toy', 'Story', 'sorts', 'instant', 'classic', 'targeted', 'boys', 'girls', 'daughters', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'parents', 'references', 'games', 'played', 'youth', 'gave', 'warm', 'feeling', 'one', 'sure', 'entertain', 'engage', 'years', 'come']",Wreck It Ralph

1525454,AOB5695UUUJ0,B00742SXOM,"Anime Lover ""D""","[16, 21]","For 30 years, Fix it Felix has been a favorite game in Litwick's arcade.  It stands with old games like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, but also with new games like Sugar Rush and Heroes Duty.  Ralph, the villan of the game, has been doing his job all these years but no one gives him any respect or even seems to like him.  In a support group for villians like him (led by Clyde of Pac-Man) he admits he would like to be a good guy for a change - which of course scares the others and asks if he was going to go Turbo (the definition of this is when a character of one game tries to take over another and both games get their plugs pulled).  But when he is not invited to the anniversary party of his game being held by the other characters, this makes Ralph leave for the ultra violent Heroes duty to get a medal and maybe the respect he craves.  But along the way things naturally do not go as planned and it is not only a race against time, since Ralph was not in his game they are scheduled to have their plug pulled, but also for Sgt. Calhoun and a love stricken Felix (to each their own) to stop a Cybug infestation from destroying the rest of the arcade.I remember when I was younger and going to the arcade with my father with a stack of quarters and playing games like Mr. Do and Street Fighter, so I was happy that this movie gave me that bit of nostalgia for the old days. AndI will admit I was a little worried about this movie as other movies based on video games were not so great (resident evil being a prime example), but as I saw the trailers I am glad I got to see the movie.  The animation was clean, the story was well written, and the life of the characters from Venellope Van Schweetz to Ryu and Ken of Street Fighter just makes you wonder if the game characters do have an after hours life.  Also I enjoyed naming all the cameo characters that I knew (from Bowser and M. Bison to classics like Q*Bert and Dig Dug).

This film was an exception. It tells the story of Ralph, the antagonist of a popular retro videogame entitled ""Fix it Felix Junior"". Ralph's job is to destroy a penthouse inhabited by a number of citizens while the protagonist, Felix Junior  is tasked with repairing  the Damage Ralph causes.At the end of everyday the game resets and the Characters are free to do as they please. The citizens of the Penthouse throw a party  in honor of Felix complete with music, dancing and a cake replica of the penthouse. Feeling left out, Ralph visits the Penthouse and convinces Felix to let him in for a piece of cake. The inhabitants treat him hostily and an argument ensues ending with Ralph destroying the cake and vowing to win a medal to prove that though he's programmed to be a bad guy, he can be a hero as well.He sets off to do so.Enough summary.Judging from the previews I expected this movie to rely on Cameos for success and not pay much attention to story but I was wrong.The story is great. It has the right balance of comedy and action. Not all of the humor was potty themed. There's what could be called slapstick and a parody of several shooter cliche's. Ralph is a very likeable character and as rounded as possible given the circumstances. In the end he becomes content with who he is in leiu of the drastic changes that usually occur in stories like this where a zero becomes an overly glamourized hero.(That's not to say EVERYTHING stays completely the same.)Ralph's main companion Vanelope von Shweets is also a loveable character. Like Ralph she also goes against her programming to achieve her dreams. While she is not a hero,  they managed to avoid  making her a Mary Sue. She resides in a japanese racing game called Sugar Rush but is never allowed to race due to be ing an alleged glitch chararacter that could put the game out of order. Despite being forbidden, she is determined to be a racer and is aided several times by Ralph.As far as content goes I can't see anything that would be too bad for a kid to watch(with the exception of the scene where the embodiment of all shooter stereotypes punches Felix Jr several times, each disfiguring his face horribly before he fixes it with his hammer but despite realistic sounds it's much more comical than  violent.  I wouldn't worry about it.)The main villan is simplistic and easily defeated but it didn't take away from the story in any way. I can't say much more without spoiling the plot but I recommend this movie.

That being said, it is a PG rating and that rating is well deserved. One of the leading ladies angrily calls her soldiers Pussy Willows, emphasizing the first part and when another character says he is going to help her she says ""like fun you are"" which again when she starts you think she's going to say something else. To most people that's probably not a big deal. Most people watch TV and vulgar movies. I am not into that and found the movie to be too vulgar at parts and quite offensive.I guess when I saw the casting list I should have expected as such, but I grew up with Disney and find it difficult to admit they have lost their touch. Everything they did used to become an instant classic, but now it seems they have a couple of hits, but a majority of misses. I did not enjoy the humor and did not really find the message to be all that inspiring. There are plenty of better movies to watch if you are looking for a good message. Veggie Tales comes to mind. They have great message and plenty of humor that even we adults can appreciate without being vulgar.Also, the bad-guy self help group was just thrown in so they could show off a few classic characters. Don't buy this movie for the sake of the nostalgia the classic characters are only in the movie for a little while at the beginning. They could have done so much more with this film!! The ending was nice, but the first half of the movie was terrible.

It has been key to their success. Just like the characters in ""Toy Story"", we all long to be needed and not necessarily loved, but liked. We want to be included. We want to know that there's somebody out there who thinks of us from time to time and quite simply, that is all that Ralph wants.Locked away inside his game between the hours of open and close of the arcade, Ralph is alone. He's a bad guy. The hero of his game, Fix-it Felix is the star. Felix is the one with the friends and who receives all the accolades. When the arcade closes up for the night, the characters can travel from game to game, they can socialize with each other, but Ralph is alone, with no friends to speak of. Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, wants people to like him. He wants people to be proud of him, but being locked away inside his game only allows him to destroy and then get thrown off a building. This triggers a nostalgic and incredibly creative adventure.""Wreck it Ralph"" never really struck me as outwardly hilarious, but the movie is endlessly entertaining and loaded with imagery and blast from the past references. Also like ""Toy Story"", another world occurs when people aren't looking and when that world takes off, the video game references from the past will go right over your child's head. The adults though, will recognize characters from Super Mario Bros, Sonic, Q*bert, Street Fighter, Joust, Frogger, Pac-Man, Burger Time, the bartender from the game Tapper and even paddle one and two from the ultra nostalgic game, Pong.Ralph means well, but like most animated movies, that doesn't always lead you in the correct direction. So, when he meets a sweet little 9-year old racer named Vanellope Von Schweetz, voiced by Sarah Silverman, he finds that he's not alone in his plight to be included. Vanellope is a glitch, a flawed character program, hidden away in the system, not allowed to play. The two of them may have formed one of the most memorable character bonds in recent history.While the movie may not be hilariously funny, ""Wreck it Ralph"" is sheer joy and fun and it taps into an emotion that many adults have forgotten and many kids know all too well.

1525538,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00742SXOM,C. Sawin,"[6, 8]","If you have any interest in ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" then video games more than likely played some sort of importance in your life at some point. The 3D computer animated comedy covers just about everything from Pong to Pac-Man to Super Mario Bros to first person shooters, 2D fighters, and racing games and everything in between. Prepare yourself for a nostalgic overload.Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the villain who smashes buildings in a game called ""Fix-It-Felix, Jr"" and it just so happens to be the video game's 30th anniversary. When the arcade closes, the characters in each game relax, party, and even visit other games and characters through the power strip they're all plugged into. Ralph is sick of being the bad guy and being treated like an outsider while hero Fix-It Felix, Jr (voiced by Jack McBrayer) gets all of the glory. Ralph eventually starts game hopping to try and prove to everyone in his game that he's worthy of better treatment, but doesn't consider the consequences of his journey or the friendships he may make along the way.Hopefully you have a chance to see this in theaters because the short, ""Paperman"" that's before the film is excellent. There's just something about animated shorts without dialogue that always seem to portray the story in a way that taps into your emotions in ways a traditional short just wouldn't be able to accomplish. ""Paperman"" has a man meet a woman at a train station on chance. They go their separate ways until he realizes she has a job interview at the building across the street. He spends the rest of the short trying to get her attention with paper airplanes. It's pretty creative and heartwarming.What's so innovative about ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is that it puts you inside the games you grew up on. Seeing how the characters interact with each other when the arcade closes is the most entertaining aspect of the film. Game Central is pretty amazing because you get to see so many recognizable characters all in one place, but the Bad-Anon support group for video game villains is the highlight. Seeing characters such as Bowser and Doctor Robotnik listen to Clyde from Pac-Man as he gives advice to Ralph or witnessing Kano perform his heart-rip fatality on a zombie is like opening the door to your childhood.The video game references are countless. Having M. Bison be the first to bring up ""going turbo"" was hilarious and seeing Ralph seek advice from the bartender in Tapper or King Candy (voiced by Alan Tudyk) use the Contra code to get into his secret vault was just amazing. Other concepts are just as brilliant such as the Nesquik sand scene and the Diet Cola Springs with falling Mentos. The comedy covers so much ground as it jumps from video game references to physical comedy (Jane Lynch's Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun punching Fix-It Felix, Jr in the face repeatedly) to the witty (Ralph hitting King Candy with his glasses after Candy put glasses on and declaring, ""You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?"" There's even some incredible food related ideas that utilize Oreos, Devil Dogs, and a particularly awesome scene where Ralph tortures Sour Bill (voiced by director Rich Moore) and references Tootsie Pops.This may be the first time dubstep has been used in a major motion picture and it's actually fit the film. When Ralph starts battling (or fleeing) from the massive Cy-Bug attack in Hero's Duty, Noisia's remix of Skrillex's ""Bug Hunt"" plays in the background and actually makes the entire sequence even more enjoyable.""Wreck-It Ralph"" is going to appeal to all ages whether you're a kid or a kid at heart. The younger audience can enjoy it for actually feeling like they're inside some of their favorite video games while adults can enjoy all of the throwbacks and references to the games of their past.

The voice acting is top-notch here; John C. Reilly is great as the title character and Jack McBrayer is perfect as Felix Fix-It Jr. In fact, there isn't one member of the voice cast that is out of place. Even Sarah Silverman, whom I'm not much of a fan of, does a great job with her character, Vanellope von Schweetz. The story does have elements that are familiar, but sets itself apart by with the insertion of original jokes and clever references.One of the things I loved most about the movie is the appeal it has for everyone, whether it be little kids, adults, video game enthusiasts, or grandparents; there's something here for everyone. Those who grew up playing classic games like Pac-Man and Tapper will be overjoyed with some of the references this movie contains. It's fantastic to see companies collaborate and allow their properties to come together, and I sincerely hope they make a sequel. I also thought it was great how the creative team incorporated various gaming elements into the movie. For example, in the same scene they will have highly modernized characters with fluid movement interacting with jittery characters in the old 8-bit style, something I'd never seen in a film.As I said, this was the best animated film of the year for me and one of the most enjoyable I've seen in a long time.

1525562,AOKXMEY6M1NQ4,B00742SXOM,Dark Helmet,"[2, 4]","I love the movie, it's the best video game movie of all time, and probably in my top 10 favorite Disney films.Other reviews have tackled the movie's plot, so I'm going to stick to reviewing the details of the 2D Blu-ray disc. I do not have a 3D set or a surround sound system, so I cannot comment on those.The picture quality on the Blu-ray is superb. No artifacts, color banding, off color skin tones or other problems that come from compression or a bad transfer. It looks like you're looking through a crystal clear glass window straight into the world of the movie. The clarity is amazing. If you're a gamer with a large TV, you'll get a lot of joy out of pausing the playback to pick out cameos and references in the backgrounds that you missed in the theater.The sound is likewise excellent. The dialog is clear as a bell, with no muddiness in the sound effects or musical score. This is a real bonus, since many of the video game references are auditory. For example, the sound effect when Sargent Calhoun charges her gun is taken from Mega Man X.Love the movie itself, but extras is where this release falls flat. There's five deleted scenes (with an optional commentary track), four promotional commercials made for Litwak's Arcade, a &#34;making of&#34; documentary that runs about 20 minutes, and the Paperman short shown before the film. There is a trivia feature that pops up on screen when you pause the movie, but it loops after around 10 minutes. Watching everything would take you about an hour, and that's if you watched the deleted scenes twice for the commentary track. I was expecting a lot more.Where are the cast interviews? The character galleries? I want to know what kind of legal wrangling they had to go through to get all those cameos. There isn't even a commentary track. Disney couldn't even get some of the staff or cast members to sit down and talk about the movie for an hour and a half?The lack of concept art is particularly annoying, because they show brief flashes of some it during the featurette and it looks really interesting! Then there's the music, which they don't talk about AT ALL. Come on Disney, you got Buckner and Garcia to record a new song for the credits, and it's not even mentioned.Maybe they'll be pushing an &#34;Ultimate Edition&#34; with all of the stuff that should have been on this release a few years from now.5 stars for the movie.2 stars for the extras.",3,Collector's edition my butt,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,2419,"['love', 'movie', 'best', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'time', 'probably', 'top', '10', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'films.Other', 'reviews', 'have', 'tackled', 'movie', 'plot', ""'m"", 'going', 'stick', 'reviewing', 'details', '2D', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'do', 'not', 'have', '3D', 'set', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'those.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'superb', 'artifacts', 'color', 'banding', 'off', 'color', 'skin', 'tones', 'other', 'problems', 'come', 'compression', 'bad', 'transfer', ""'re"", 'looking', 'crystal', 'clear', 'glass', 'window', 'straight', 'world', 'movie', 'clarity', 'amazing', ""'re"", 'gamer', 'large', 'TV', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lot', 'joy', 'pausing', 'playback', 'pick', 'out', 'cameos', 'references', 'backgrounds', 'missed', 'theater.The', 'sound', 'likewise', 'excellent', 'dialog', 'clear', 'bell', 'muddiness', 'sound', 'effects', 'musical', 'score', 'real', 'bonus', 'many', 'video', 'game', 'references', 'are', 'auditory', 'example', 'sound', 'effect', 'when', 'Sargent', 'Calhoun', 'gun', 'taken', 'Mega', 'Man', 'X.Love', 'movie', 'extras', 'where', 'release', 'flat', 'five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'optional', 'commentary', 'track', 'four', 'promotional', 'commercials', 'made', 'Litwak', 'Arcade', '34', 'making', '34', 'documentary', '20', 'minutes', 'Paperman', 'short', 'shown', 'film', 'trivia', 'feature', 'up', 'screen', 'when', 'pause', 'movie', '10', 'minutes', 'Watching', 'everything', 'would', 'take', 'hour', 'watched', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'twice', 'commentary', 'track', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'are', 'cast', 'interviews', 'character', 'galleries', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'legal', 'wrangling', 'had', 'go', 'get', 'cameos', ""n't"", 'even', 'commentary', 'track', 'Disney', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'staff', 'cast', 'members', 'sit', 'down', 'talk', 'movie', 'hour', 'half', 'lack', 'concept', 'art', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'show', 'brief', 'flashes', 'featurette', 'really', 'interesting', 'Then', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'AT', 'ALL', 'Come', 'Disney', 'got', 'Buckner', 'Garcia', 'record', 'new', 'song', 'credits', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned.Maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pushing', '34', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', '34', 'stuff', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'release', 'few', 'years', 'now.5', 'stars', 'movie.2', 'stars', 'extras']",Wreck It Ralph

The video game characters are seen leaving their video game and head home or travel to visit friends from other video games.We are introduced to Ralph (featuring the voice of John C. Reilly), the villain of the game ""Fix-It Felix, Jr."".  Ralph wrecks a building and Felix, Jr. (voiced by Jack McBrayer), with his magic hammer, fixes it all up.But for Ralph, as much as he enjoys his role in the video game, Felix, Jr. receives all the credit and is often celebrated, while he goes home to a junk yard and just watches Felix, Jr. getting noticed all the time.Ralph explains to his support group of video game villains/antagonists that he wishes that he could be a good guy, but his fellow antagonists in the support group are worried that Ralph is turning ""Turbo"".One day, as Ralph is watching Felix, Jr.'s building from afar, he notices that he is having a 30th anniversary party and is shocked why he wasn't invited.Ralph decides to crash the party and Felix, Jr. allows him to show up and eat some cake.  But other Nicelanders at the party are not thrilled that he is there because he causes nothing but trouble and breaks things.  But Ralph tells them that he wants to be a good guy but no one believes him,  They tell him to leave because Felix, Jr. is going to be presented with a medal.Ralph vows he will get a medal but no one pays him any mind.As Ralph goes to the pub, he is told that he may be able to find a medal at the lost and found but while he is looking, he sees a hysteric soldier complaining about finding cybugs for a medal.  This automatically catches Ralph's attention and when the soldier accidentally runs into a wall and knocks himself out, Ralph takes the soldiers uniform and dresses up as a soldier and enters the ""Hero's Duty"" video game.Ralph meets Sergeant Calhoun (voiced by Jane Lynch) who gets the soldiers ready for their upcoming battle.  And as the soldiers fight against the Cy-Bugs, Ralph decides to climb the game's central beacon to collect his medal, so he can show the Felix, Jr. and the Nicelanders that he received a medal.  But Ralph ends up hatching a Cy-Bug and it clings to Ralph and activates a space craft and both escapee from the ""Hero's Duty"" video game and ends up flying to the ""Sugar Rush"" video game and runs into a girl named Vannelope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman), a girl who takes his medal and plans to use it for her upcoming race.  Ralph tries to chase after her in order to get the medal back.Meanwhile, back at the ""Fix-It Felix, Jr."" video game, at the arcade, a teenage girl tries to play ""Fix-It Felix, Jr."" but without Ralph back in the video game, there is no villain and so, Litwak puts a malfunction sign to the game and this causes Felix, Jr. and the Nicelanders major concern as a malfunctioning game that is quite old and it could be the end of their game.So, Felix, Jr. goes to look for Ralph and meets with Sgt. Calhoun to find out that Ralph has led a Cy-bug to another video game.This causes Sgt. Calhoun great concern because Cy-Bug's can replicate and infect other video games and take over the game.  We see her back story comes to show that her fiance was killed in a video game when she didn't check on Cy-Bugs before her wedding.Feeling the need to stop them, she is determined in going to ""Sugar Rush"" to kill the Cy-Bug and Felix, Jr. decides to accompany her.Meanwhile, on ""Sugar Rush"", as Vanellope uses the medal to purchase a new race vehicle.  As Vanellope plans to compete, the racers at ""Sugar Rush"" refuse to allow her to race, claiming that she is not part of their game and that she is nothing but a glitch/mistake and is not supposed to exist.Ralph finds out that she lives by herself and realizes like him, no one wants to be around her.  So, the two become good friends and Ralph is determined in seeing Vanellope win the race and prove to the others that she is real and that she is a winner.But when King Candy is determined that a glitch should not win the race, so he hack's the ""Sugar Rush"" code to get Ralph's medal and warning him that if Vanellope wins the race, it will be disastrous not just for ""Sugar Rush"" but can end up killing Vanellope as she was never meant to be part of the game and that is why she is glitching.  It could also cause problems to his own video game.But with Vanellope's heart set on winning the race with the car that she and Ralph had built... Will Ralph help Vanellope win the race or will he sabotage it?  And what will happen to the game he belongs to, now that he's not in it?VIDEO:""Wreck-It Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is a film that looks incredible on Blu-ray.  Because of the way each video game setting is created, their is wonderful depth in the 3D presentation.  I have to say that this film is one of the better looking animated films in 3D.And as the Blu-ray 3D is quite impressive, the Blu-ray is also fantastic with its vibrant colors and its overall color palette.  Colors and detail are incredible, especially to see various video game characters animated and some with metallic to shiny textures, the animation for this film is fantastic.  You can see the detail on the character's skin tones to the textures of Sugar Rush, such as sugared candy hills, the textures of Ralph's clothing and more.And with a film with so much color, you would think that with pinks and reds, you would see banding.  This is not the case with ""Wreck-It Ralph"", this is a pristine looking film in HD and definitely one of the better, modern animated films on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Wreck-It Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital.  Let me just say that this is one of the most immersive soundtracks I have heard for an animated film.  The surround channels are heavily utilized during the action sequences, may it be the racers in ""Sugar Rush"" or the soldiers taking on the Cy-Bugs.  There is great use of directional, cross-panning sound and thunderous LFE that the film is immersive.Dialogue is crystal clear and understandable, as with the musical score by Henry Jackman to the ""Sugar Rush"" song by AKB48.  One of the best sounding animated films on Blu-ray!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Wreck-It-Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" come with the following special features:Paperman: Theatrical Short - (6:34) For those who watched the film in the theater (in 3D or 2D), ""Paperman"" is a theatrical short and a love story about a man who sees the woman he fell in love at first sight and tries to get her attention at a building across from his, by throwing paper airplanes.  The short is featured in both 3D and 2D.Bit by Bit: Creating the Worlds of Wreck-It Ralph - (16:40) A featurette with director Rich Moore, Producer Clark Spencer and the ""Wreck-It Ralph"" crew discussing the development, design and animation of the film.Alternate and Deleted Scenes - (15:26)  Featuring a total of four deleted and alternate scenes (all are not fully-rendered but featured via animated sketches) with optional commentary from director Rich Moore, co-writers Phil Johnston and Jim Reardon.Video Game Commercials - (2:39) Promotional commercials for ""Wreck-It Ralph"" for ""Fix-It Felix Jr."", ""Sugar Rush"", ""Hero's Duty"" and ""Fix It Felix Hammer"".Disney Intermission - (9:23) Whenever you pause ""Wreck-It Ralph"", comedian and ""The Nerdist"", ""Talking Dead"" and ""Attack of the Show"" host Chris Hardwick, discusses the video game references and Easter eggs featured in the film.EXTRAS:""Wreck-It Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" comes with a lenticular slipcover case and the Ultimate Collector's Edition comes with a Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD (presented in 2:39:1 aspect ratio, English 5.1 and DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital Language Tracks) and digital Copy, which works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.JUDGMENT CALL:When I first watched ""Wreck-It Ralph"" in the theater and then watching it again on Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray, there were so many things about this animated film that I loved.For one, it dealt with video games and featured video game character cameos throughout the film, it also featured a song from Japan's AKB48 but for the most part, the story was clever about characters having the ability to cross over to other video games (when an arcade is closed for the day).While not as deep or emotional compared to a Disney/Pixar film such as ""Toy Story 3&#8243; or ""Up"", the film is exciting, full of imagination, humorous and so much fun thanks  to its characters, character situations and for the most part, there are lessons to be learned from this film.For one, it's protagonist Ralph is a video game antagonist but he's a guy with a good heart, but because he's different from everyone else, people from his own video game, try to distance themselves from him.  Vanellope is also in the same situation, but it's how these two people viewed as different, find each other and become good friends despite the challenges they each face in their video game life.You also have the strong female soldier Sgt. Calhoun which is a pretty cool female character to be seen on an animated film.  She kicks butt but yet we learn that she is not a perfect video game character as she is trying to move past the death of her fiance (who was killed by Cy-Bugs because she failed to check the perimeter).  And then you have Felix, Jr., the hero of the old school ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" video games with a magic hammer that can fix things and also a major crush towards Sgt. Calhoun.The voice acting of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" also benefits from having talents such as John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch in the main characters roles.  But you also have other talent such as Mindy Kailing, Joe Lo Truglio, Alan Tudyk, Ed O'Neill, Dennis Haysbert and many others as voice talent for the film.As for the Blu-ray release, I have to say that this is one of the best, if not the best animated film to be presented in Blu-ray 3D.  Also, the Blu-ray itself features a colorful and vibrant scenery and full of detail.  Picture quality alone is fantastic and as for the lossless audio, definitely one of the better, immersive animated films on Blu-ray.  Solid PQ and AQ really makes this film worth owning in HD but if there was only one thing that I wished was on the Blu-ray release was more special features.  From the ""Sugar Rush"" video by AKB48 shown on YouTube on the ""Wreck-It Ralph"" channel, audio commentary or even more special features would have been nice.Granted, I  know I'm spoiled to expecting a lot from Disney animated films on Blu-ray as Disney tends to deliver.  And while there are a good number of special features in this ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" of ""Wreck-It Ralph"", I was hoping to see many more and kind of takes it away from being a 5-star Blu-ray release.Overall, Enjoyable, hilarious and all out awesome!  ""Wreck-It Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is possibly one of the best animated film on Blu-ray 3D released so far.  Vibrant, colorful, wonderful PQ and lossless audio...a fantastic Blu-ray release!",5,"(Blu-ray 3D/Blu-Ray) Enjoyable, hilarious and all out awesome!",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,12530,"['2012',

1525578,A39FTW448TRUQO,B00742SXOM,DisneyDenizen,"[19, 25]","This movie was made for my video-game-loving Aspie. She has dragged me to the theaters to see it a record five times, and a sixth trip is coming up. Set within the gaming world and allowing characters from different video games to interact, this movie validates the importance of what is most important in my daughter's world.I think this movie exceeded all expectations:1. Despite Christmas releases, it is still in the theaters.2. A sequel is in the works.3. GameStop only stocked one copy of the Wreck-It Ralph Wii game in each of their stores. A week or two after we bought ours for $30, we received a ""buy back"" e-mail for $15. I smell shortage.My daughter enjoys counting the Sonic the Hedgehog appearances throughout the movie. (There are quite a few, but most so brief that you'd better not blink.) She loves her Felix plushie. She's written ten chapters of a fan fiction. She walks around chortling to herself about the Felix/Calhoun romance. In short, she is really engaged with this movie.It also really engaged her emotions. When Ralph has his big destructive moment with Vanellope (I'm trying not to be too specific), she was in tears and turned to me and said, ""I don't like how this is making me feel."" But of course there was redemption.The film is also not horrid for adults to sit through, and that's always a major plus. It moves so quickly; the plot cleverly zips along with problem-resolution at break-neck speed. And there are plenty of humorous moments for adults, particularly a Wizard of Oz reference. In every viewing I sat through, the people laughing the loudest were the adult men.

It's a fun twist on the sentimental framework established by Toy Story, but when the sight gags, winks and grins run out it feels a bit thin. The prologue hints at something really dense, vivid, expansive and bright, especially in the bad guys' support group scene that's featured in all the trailers, but the story never truly delivers on that potential. As a small-scale adventure it's just fine, and I certainly appreciated the efforts it made to secure so many cameos from classic gaming characters. It looks great, both in full 3D and pixelated 8-bit facsimile, and the voice acting is a series of loose, warm, top-notch efforts. The concept feels like it never gets fully off the ground, though, and a long layover in one particular game world puts the brakes on what was, until then, a slick, snappy pace.

1525591,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B00742SXOM,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","I was looking forward to this movie with tremendous anticipation. As a lifelong video game player there are few popular classic arcade games I haven&#8217;t played and I mean back in the day when they were new. When I saw the preview showing Ralph sitting around the villains support group with M. Bison, Zangief, Clyde, Bowser and Dr. Eggman I was sold. The movie looked to be a &#8220;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&#8221; for video game fans and my hope for a great movie was through the roof. Nothing could have lived up to my expectation but this is a fantastic movie and one of those movies that feels like it was crafted just for me.In some ways it feels like the movie can be split in two. We have Ralph in his own 8-bit game and then later exploring areas outside his game as when he has a drink at Tapper&#8217;s bar (a game I loved). Then there is the second longer part where Ralph enters the made up games of Heroes Duty and Sugar Rush. This is where I was a touch, just a wee bit disappointed. The Heroes Duty and Sugar Rush portions are extremely well done but there is no nostalgia factor in games that don&#8217;t exist. Those few seconds of Ralph in Tapper when the bartender starts rushing around filling drinks almost brought a tear of joy to my eye. Even the scenes in the Wreck-It Ralph game felt nostalgic despite that fact that it wasn&#8217;t a real game because the designs of the characters and low frame rate movements felt classic. The problem with Heroes Duty and Sugar Rush as modern games is that they are indistinguishable from any other CG animated movie. Sugar Rush is clearly inspired by cart games of which the most notable in Mario Kart but there isn&#8217;t enough to really get my nostalgia juices flowing. Once Ralph was in Sugar Rush the video game references changed to confectionary references which wasn&#8217;t want I went to the theater for. I will say that the appearance of Beard Papa was pretty cool.I could rave on about the story and the voice acting and the animation but perhaps what stayed with me the most was the design (as weird as that may sound). I go back to Tapper&#8217;s bar and Felix&#8217;s apartment. The animators used a beautiful soft background lighting that is just gorgeous to look at. These may be the most beautifully rendered CGI scenes I have ever seen but they aren&#8217;t dramatically beautiful they just feel real and magical. There are so many video game nods you could probably spend a year trying to find all the references. I loved the voice acting particularly John C. Reilly as Wreck-It Ralph and Jack McBrayer as Fix-It Felix. I&#8217;m hoping that the sequel will focus more on the classic games but what I&#8217;ve heard is the movie may branch out into mobile and online gaming which is really not the direction I feel it should go in. I&#8217;d love to see Ralph in BurgerTime or Frogger or PaperBoy or PunchOut. Spending a few moments chatting with Mario or Mr. Do or even Popeye (who had a very successful arcade game) would be a blast. Any mild issues I may have don&#8217;t take away from this being a spectacularly fun movie that is likely Disney&#8217;s best animated film in many years.

But they really didn't give any indication of plot or characters. So I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. And Disney's track record with computer animation is not nearly as good as that of Pixar.In this case though they hit the ball right out of the park. At it's core we have a simple story about learning to appreciate who you are and what makes you special. A traditional kids movie theme that is wrapped up in some traditional children's humor. But underlying that we also have references that only the adults will get. Games that we might have played, characters we might have recognized. And a great joke about some of the sillier back stories that game characters are given.And if that isn't enough the movie gives a genuinely heart breaking scene where Ralph destroys Vanellope's dream in (he believes) and effort to save her. Throw in one of the most unlikely romances since Donkey and Dragon and you've got an all round good movie on your hands.While the animation style is not as distinctive as say Hotel Transylvania, it isn't bound to realism due to it's video game setting.

Although I work at a store that specializes in movies first and video games second, I get the strangest looks from people when I tell them that. My first reaction is hand gestures that define how much of the store is made up of Blu-rays and DVDs in relation to video games. I didn't get the job there because of my love for video games. That's why I can't say I was all that excited when I saw the trailers for &#34;Wreck-It Ralph.&#34;After 30 years of playing the bad guy in his own video game, Ralph (John C. Reilly) is ready to move on to bigger and better things. All he wants is to be accepted by the other characters of the game and be recognized as a hero instead of a villain for once. In order to prove he can be just as good as he can be bad, Ralph embarks on an adventure to other video game worlds to win an award and the respect of his associates. His journey pits him against the ruler (Alan Tudyk) of a racing game obsessed with keeping a glitching character named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from participating.I'm more than positive that &#34;Wreck-It Ralph&#34; pleases gamers with its homage to video games past and present. The characters are all charming and filmmakers did a wonderful job capturing the looks of different types of old and new games. The only thing I couldn't quite get over was why Ralph and Felix looked so new, but their companions from the 30-year-old game still stuttered a bit when walking and talking.One thing that impressed me was how animators found a way to keep the style of the different characters consistent while being from different games and decades. Each game had a unique look but still somehow fit together in the grand scheme of the film. A good example of this was the blending of the vastly different &#34;Hero's Duty&#34; and &#34;Sugar Rush&#34; worlds.The voice cast for &#34;Wreck-It Ralph&#34; is an interesting mix of actors. Instead of the usual Disney TV stars and A-list celebrities we're used to, filmmakers dug a little deeper here. John C. Reilly (&#34;Step Brothers&#34;) lends his voice to the title character while Jack McBrayer (&#34;30 Rock&#34;) plays his nemesis, Fix-It Felix, Jr. Sarah Silverman (&#34;Crank Yankers&#34;) takes on the role of mischievous racer Vanellope von Schweetz. Jane Lynch (&#34;Glee&#34;) voices Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun from &#34;Hero's Duty.&#34; It's quite a &#34;mature&#34; casting choice for a family film, but it works.Disney never skimps on its video and audio transfers. The picture is clean and crisp with vibrant colors. The 7.1 surround sound mix makes the most of all the blips, bleeps, explosions, and other sound effects video games put to use.The 4-Disc 3D Combo Pack contains all sorts of fun bonus material. The theatrical short &#34;Paperman&#34; starts things off. When the movie is paused, we're treated to a Disney Intermission entitled &#34;The Gamer's Guide to 'Wreck-It Ralph'&#34; hosted by Chris Hardwick. There are also deleted and alternate scenes and original video game commercials included.Although being a bit complex for younger viewers, &#34;Wreck-It-Ralph&#34; will win children over with its mesmerizing animation and appealing characters. Its family-friendly fun which parents who used to play &#34;Pac-Man&#34; and &#34;Super Mario Bros.&#34; can find something humorous in as well.

1525612,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00742SXOM,FNDNreview,"[2, 2]","Wreck-It Ralph, directed by Rich Moore (former director of a few episodes during the early seasons of The Simpsons), is the story of Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in an arcade video game called, Fix-It Felix, Jr.  After the arcade closes, the characters from each of the arcade&#8217;s games are able to mingle with one another in a central hub (complete with a security guard called a surge protector).  However, since the game&#8217;s creation, Ralph has only played the villain, always being defeated by Felix (Jack McBryer), not to mention having to live in the city dump.  Ralph decides he&#8217;s had enough, and wants to be able to socialize with his game&#8217;s other characters, but in able to do so, it&#8217;s recommended he win a video game medal.  On his quest to win a medal, Ralph ends up in another video game, Sugar Rush (racing game), where he meets Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a glitch character trying to make herself whole by winning a race against the villainous, King Candy (Alan Tudyk).  Jane Lynch, Ed O&#8217;Neill, Dennis Haysbert, and Adam Carolla also voice characters.The premise of Wreck-It Ralph is actually quite brilliant &#8211; although recycled.  While Toy Story tells a story of toys that come to life when people aren&#8217;t around, Wreck-It Ralph tells a story of video game characters that come to life when people aren&#8217;t around.  Essentially, it&#8217;s a recycled idea &#8211; but with a smart, different twist.  Regardless, it&#8217;s rather entertaining to have scenes where characters can jump from one video game to another.  In one particular scene, classic video game villains (M. Bison from Street Fighter, Clyde from Pac-Man, King Koopa from Super Mario Bros., etc.) are all sitting in a room &#8211; reminiscent of an alcoholics anonymous meeting &#8211; only they are dealing with being outcast super villains.  And, once we enter the video game hub, classic characters, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Ryu from Street Fighter, and the Paperboy from Paperboy, are just a few of the characters making cameos and taking part in the off-duty festivities (including drinking at a root beer bar).Wreck-It Ralph combines enjoyment both for children (of a certain age) and adults &#8211; which was once reserved only for the Disney classics.  Sure, the graphics are crisp, perfect, and full of bright, beautiful colors &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t always make a film good &#8211; let alone a classic.  This story is a throwback tribute to the classics, with a modern twist.  It&#8217;s such a unique idea that it will make you want to pull out that vintage video game console and indulge in some classic video games of old.  Graphics are so intense these days that most kids don&#8217;t even realize how much fun Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario Bros. used to be for the rest of us.Overall, Wreck-It Ralph is a terrific addition to the Disney animation family &#8211; a family that has been lackluster in recent years.  Ralph gives new life to Disney entertainment, especially since they&#8217;re mostly focused on The Avengers and Star Wars these days.  The voice work is adequate, colors are beautiful, and the kids should have a blast with this one &#8211; while allowing the adults to remember the good ol&#8217; days of video games.Overall Film Grade:  B-FNDNreview.com",4,'Wreck-It Ralph' a new Disney classic,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,3368,"['Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'directed', 'Rich', 'Moore', 'former', 'director', 'few', 'episodes', 'early', 'seasons', 'Simpsons', 'story', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'voiced', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'villain', 'arcade', 'video', 'game', 'called', 'Fix-It', 'Felix', 'Jr.', 'arcade', 'closes', 'characters', 'arcade', '8217', 's', 'games', 'are', 'able', 'mingle', 'one', 'central', 'hub', 'complete', 'security', 'guard', 'called', 'surge', 'protector', 'However', 'game', '8217', 'creation', 'Ralph', 'only', 'played', 'villain', 'always', 'being', 'defeated', 'Felix', 'Jack', 'McBryer', 'not', 'mention', 'having', 'live', 'city', 'dump', 'Ralph', '8217', 'had', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'socialize', 'game', '8217', 'other', 'characters', 'able', 'do', 'so', '8217', 's', 'recommended', 'win', 'video', 'game', 'medal', 'quest', 'win', 'medal', 'Ralph', 'up', 'video', 'game', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'racing', 'game', 'where', 'Vanellope', 'von', 'Schweetz', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'glitch', 'character', 'trying', 'make', 'herself', 'whole', 'winning', 'race', 'villainous', 'King', 'Candy', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Ed', 'O', '8217', 'Neill', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'Adam', 'Carolla', 'also', 'characters.The', 'premise', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'actually', 'quite', 'brilliant', '8211', 'recycled', 'Toy', 'Story', 'story', 'toys', 'come', 'life', 'when', 'people', 'aren', '8217', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'story', 'video', 'game', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'when', 'people', 'aren', '8217', 'Essentially', '8217', 's', 'recycled', 'idea', '8211', 'smart', 'different', 'twist', 'Regardless', '8217', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'have', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'can', 'jump', 'one', 'video', 'game', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'classic', 'video', 'game', 'villains', 'M.', 'Bison', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'Clyde', 'Pac-Man', 'King', 'Koopa', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'etc', 'are', 'sitting', 'room', '8211', 'reminiscent', 'alcoholics', 'anonymous', 'meeting', '8211', 'only', 'are', 'dealing', 'being', 'outcast', 'super', 'villains', 'once', 'enter', 'video', 'game', 'hub', 'classic', 'characters', 'including', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'Ryu', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'Paperboy', 'Paperboy', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'characters', 'making', 'cameos', 'taking', 'part', 'off-duty', 'festivities', 'including', 'drinking', 'root', 'beer', 'bar', '.Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'combines', 'enjoyment', 'children', 'certain', 'age', '8211', 'was', 'once', 'reserved', 'only', 'Disney', 'classics', 'Sure', 'graphics', 'are', 'crisp', 'perfect', 'full', 'bright', 'beautiful', 'colors', '8211', 'doesn', '8217', 'always', 'make', 'film', 'good', '8211', 'let', 'alone', 'classic', 'story', 'throwback', 'tribute', 'classics', 'modern', 'twist', '8217', 's', 'unique', 'idea', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'pull', 'out', 'vintage', 'video', 'game', 'console', 'indulge', 'classic', 'video', 'games', 'old', 'Graphics', 'are', 'so', 'intense', 'days', 'most', 'kids', 'don', '8217', 't', 'even', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'used', 'be', 'rest', 'us.Overall', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'terrific', 'addition', 'Disney', 'animation', 'family', '8211', 'family', 'been', 'lackluster', 'recent', 'years', 'Ralph', 'new', 'life', 'Disney', 'entertainment', 'especially', '8217', 'mostly', 'focused', 'Avengers', 'Star', 'Wars', 'days', 'voice', 'work', 'adequate', 'colors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'kids', 'should', 'have', 'blast', 'one', '8211', 'allowing', 'adults', 'remember', 'good', 'ol', '8217', 'days', 'video', 'games.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'B-FNDNreview.com']",Wreck It Ralph

1525614,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B00742SXOM,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[0, 0]","For a number of years now, especially since the ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!"" switch over to all computer generated animation for their feature films, Disney has appeared content to let Pixar, Dreamworks, and various other more ambitious upstart animation studios slug it out for Number One while they toodled along under the radar, producing good but not great computer generated animation films.  In fact it often seemed that Disney didn't really know what to do with computer generated animation, since most of their computer generated feature films looked like they could have been done about as well in old-fashioned ink and cell format.  Well, that all came to an end with this film, a remarkably brilliant, in part because it was such a surprise, combination of story AND computer generated format.Not unlike Pixar's Toy Story series, the premise of Wreck-It Ralph is that video game characters are alive and have lives outside arcade hours, along with certain video game character specific rules, like the fact that if you die OUTSIDE of your game, you stay dead, you don't regenerate, and the fact that ""glitches"", so-called ""mistake"" characters that allegedly aren't supposed to exist, cannot leave their games.  The movie begins with a hilarious parody of support groups as Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of the Fix-It Felix, Jr., video game, finally shows up to a meeting of BAD-ANON: One Game at a Time (Bad Guys Anonymous for video game bad guys) after years of being invited because it's the 30th anniversary of his game coming out, and he's feeling unappreciated and tired of being a bad guy.  Finding the hilarious parody ""support"" he receives from his fellow bad guys utterly useless, he returns to his game only to find that the other characters are having a 30th anniversary party...without inviting him.The upshot is that Ralph vows to do what no video game bad guy has ever done before: earn a medal.  A chance encounter gives him the opportunity to infiltrate  a brand new (and extremely violent and scary) video game Hero's Duty where after a hilariously awful first game, Ralph figures out a way to ""earn"" a medal, but in the process accidentally unleashes a threat that will destroy ALL of the games in the arcade if it isn't stopped in time.  With ultimate disaster looming, grim Calhoun of Hero's Duty (programmed with the most tragic back-story ever) and Fix-It Felix, Jr., himself must follow Ralph into another relatively new game Sugar Rush where glitch Vanellope von Schweetz has used Ralph's stolen medal to pay her entry fee into the nightly race that determines which character avatars are available for selection by the next day's players, forcing a resentful Ralph to do whatever he can to help Vanellope win in order to get his medal back.It's fun to try and recognize all of the real life video game antecedents reworked in here, and what makes it even more astonishing is when you realize that the story would never have worked if the writers had used the original video games and  characters that obviously (and sometimes not so obviously) inspired them rather than their ""made up"" but subtly different replacements.  This wasn't a case of avoiding a lawsuit or a license fee but rather a bunch of changes necessary to make the plot work.  In the end some gentle lessons are taught about the necessity of each job, appreciating the work of the people who do each necessary job, and the importance of doing your own necessary job.  More subtly much fun is had at the expense of some sacred cows, as Ralph gains satisfaction not from the selfish pursuit of meaningless medals or empty self-affirmations, but rather from sacrificing himself unselfishly to save someone else.  There's even a clever dig gotten in against the constitutional but highly questionable practice of using eminent domain for private interests buried in the Fix-It Felix, Jr., video game theme song.Sadly, Disney never quite realized what they had, and it shows among other ways in the lack of a commentary track on this bare bones one disk DVD.  It would have been nice to listen to the creators pointing out the less obvious connections to real video games and calling attention to other in jokes, but maybe that will come in a future reissue, hopefully NOT on a Dual-Layer disc this time (""slight pause"", my substantial rear end!)Note: Includes the sweet if highly illogical theatrical short ""Paperman"".",5,A Mid-Video-Game-Life

1525626,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B00742SXOM,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[3, 10]","It has been enormously easy to be a rabid Disney fan over the years, which I am, especially since the company's animation studio has never, ever produced c/r/a/p or even any cartoon movie that has never been massively huge at the box office, especially not during the Michael Eisner years or the early- and mid-2000s. With that said, it's no surprise to me that Write-It Ralph is another phat hit in the long line of Disney animated movie awesomeness! It is soooo amazingly successful as a Dreamworks-copying 3D movie that it nearly--but not quite--reaches the dizzying heights of Disney's most famous animated masterwork, Titan A.E.The plot of Write-It Ralph is super-intelligent so that only smart children will be able to appreciate it. In fact, if your child is not enrolled in the honor program at his or her local charter school, then you might want not to bring him or her to Write-It Ralph and just take him or her to a Jersey Shore drive-in marathon instead. Here is the plot: Write-It Ralph is a villain at your local arcade (do people even play arcade games anymore with that awesome Playstation Network and that even awesomer Xbox Live service?!) who is sick and tired of being a friggin villain! In fact...you could even say that he is mad as hell and...get this, get this...won't take it anymore! Really, with a plot this complex and highly developed, please don't even show up with your kids to see this unless they are enrolled in the ultra-gifted AP program at your school.To make a long story short and not spoil any plot points for your children, I'll just say that Write-It Ralph eventually solves his dilemma of being forced to be a villain, but really wanting to be an arcade game hero, for a change. He simply votes for Barack Obama, which immediately qualifies him to a ""white person who cares.""

It's a blast for fans of video games to spot the cameos, but the film's story and original characters are strong enough so that you really don't need to be a gamer to appreciate it.Wreck It Ralph is, at its core, a story about middle age crisis: a big lug who has been doing the same job for years with little or no positive recognition starts to question his life and future. He has anger issues. He goes into therapy with other video villains, including Satan (""That's pronounced '""Sa-teen,'"" he says). All that's missing from his journey is a trip to Human Resources.In Toy Story, Woody worried about being replaced. Wreck It Ralph asks, with apologies to Peggy Lee, ""Is that all there is?"" His character arc is very believable and touching, but never sentimental.Most of the film takes place in a blindingly colorful game called Sugar Rush, shown off to good advantage in Blu-ray. Clever gags abound: castle Oreo cookie soldiers who sing ""Or-ee-O, Yo-oh;"" a pit of Nestle's Quik sand; attacks by barking Devil Dogs...it goes on and on. I like the brightness, after decades of bleak, realistic fantasies.The Blu-ray disc contains all the bonus features, which, considering what a rich film this is, are not as generous as one might wish (no feature length commentary).

1525633,A13O1YCZCYT76I,B00742SXOM,Greg,"[11, 84]","...couldn't even out this script.  BURN!Seriously, though, when did the mediocre start getting lumped with the great?  When did the bar drop low enough so that such hefty praise could be tossed at such a middle-of-the-road kid's movie?  Or has it always been that way, and I've just been naive?  These are questions that I feel are important to ask, apparently.So, the long and short of it is, Wreck-it Ralph is Toy Story if it had been made by middle of the road film-makers.  After the lights go out in an arcade in some 'Anytown, USA' the video game characters are free to roam and wander and live their own lives.  After 30 years of doing the daily grind of being a video game villain, Ralph (voiced tenderly and effectively by John C. Riley) is going through something of an existential crisis - he no longer wants to be the hated villain and longs for some respect and social acceptance. It's not a new story, but this is a new and fun venue for it.  And the opening 20 minutes are pretty engaging - the characters are lively and colorful, the world behind the arcade is interesting and pretty well laid out, there's some fun nostalgic exploitation moments.  Strong stuff overall.The problems start when, you know, the PLOT finally kicks in.  Apparently, in this universe, hero's get medals at the end of video games... I've never known that to happen but, whatever, that's what they're going with.  So, through some contrived social contracts, Ralph decides HE needs a medal to finally be accepted.  This is where the movie starts to spin its wheels (PUN!) as the quest for a medal takes Ralph into a candy-coated racing game.  Here he meets a troubled young racer and the 2nd plot starts as we forget about the silly medal business and go about correcting some of the shenanigans here in Annoying Obnoxious Racing World.  Seriously, it's the least interesting place in the movie, with the least interesting characters and it's where we spend two-thirds of our time.  On top of that, the script starts getting muddled and we're introduced to a host of new 'rules' just to keep things moving forward ('glitches' can't leave their own game, for some reason.  The king can rewrite the game code, to a point) so much so that it starts to feel like playing a game with a little kid, who keeps making up new rules just so the game can keep going or, you know, they can keep winning.  Layer on a few sub-par performances by Ken-the-Intern and, ugh, Sarah Silverman and things drift from clever and engaging to just mostly bearable.But... those folks at Disney are no slouches, and they know how and when to hit he most important marks.  The visuals are slick and modern and imaginative, making the most of pixilation and other cute, fun video game idiosyncrasies.  There are some really fun and exciting sequences throughout and some tightly done action.  The emotional highpoints still, somehow, resonate which I was very surprised by.  After an hour of being entirely bored I still found myself choked up at points late in the second and late in the third acts, and that counts for a lot.  It's a little manipulative, but they push all the right buttons at the right times to make sure you stay with the film to the end... actually, it's INCREDIBLY manipulative, but it's a skill to be respected none the less.I think what hurts the most about poor Ralph here is just how shallow an experience it is.  The product placement is painfully up front; sometimes going so far as to just say the name of whatever they're trying to sell without building context around it.  The early pricks of nostalgia fade pretty quick once you realize that the old characters they've resurrected come from a small handful of games that either Disney is trying to sell or could pick up the license's to cheap.  It's a movie that was ultimately built by the marketing department first and later cleaned up by the art department and it shows.The bottom line is, Wreck-It Ralph is a mediocre kid's flick.  It's engaging and heart-string-tugging enough to keep the little one's entertained, but it lacks the punch and clarity needed to call it a 'for all ages' romp or something that will be remembered for years to come.  Growed-ups will probably be bored for long stretches as the multiple, meandering story-lines finally find their way back together for the surprisingly satisfying conclusion.  And the hipster charm of the opening minutes fades real fast, never to be seen again.  ...Also, if you think about it, the digital characters lead an awful, awful existence - even more depressing than the poor Toy Story toys.  So I seriously encourage you to NOT dwell on the realities the movie suggests and just focus on the fun aspects.  It's... too depressing otherwise.Enjoy!",3,Fix-it Felix and his Magic Hammer...,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,4754,"['could', ""n't"", 'even', 'out', 'script', 'BURN', 'Seriously', 'though', 'when', 'did', 'mediocre', 'start', 'getting', 'lumped', 'great', 'When', 'did', 'bar', 'drop', 'low', 'enough', 'so', 'such', 'hefty', 'praise', 'could', 'be', 'tossed', 'such', 'middle-of-the-road', 'kid', 'movie', 'always', 'been', 'way', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'naive', 'are', 'questions', 'feel', 'are', 'important', 'ask', 'apparently.So', 'long', 'short', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'Toy', 'Story', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'middle', 'road', 'film-makers', 'lights', 'go', 'out', 'arcade', ""'Anytown"", 'USA', 'video', 'game', 'characters', 'are', 'free', 'roam', 'wander', 'live', 'own', 'lives', '30', 'years', 'doing', 'daily', 'grind', 'being', 'video', 'game', 'villain', 'Ralph', 'voiced', 'tenderly', 'effectively', 'John', 'C.', 'Riley', 'going', 'something', 'existential', 'crisis', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'hated', 'villain', 'longs', 'respect', 'social', 'acceptance', 'not', 'new', 'story', 'new', 'fun', 'venue', 'opening', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'characters', 'are', 'lively', 'colorful', 'world', 'arcade', 'interesting', 'pretty', 'well', 'laid', 'out', 'fun', 'nostalgic', 'exploitation', 'moments', 'Strong', 'stuff', 'overall.The', 'problems', 'start', 'when', 'know', 'PLOT', 'finally', 'Apparently', 'universe', 'hero', 'get', 'medals', 'end', 'video', 'games', ""'ve"", 'never', 'known', 'happen', 'whatever', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'So', 'contrived', 'social', 'contracts', 'Ralph', 'HE', 'medal', 'finally', 'be', 'accepted', 'where', 'movie', 'spin', 'wheels', 'PUN', 'quest', 'medal', 'Ralph', 'candy-coated', 'racing', 'game', 'Here', 'troubled', 'young', 'racer', '2nd', 'plot', 'starts', 'forget', 'silly', 'medal', 'business', 'go', 'correcting', 'shenanigans', 'here', 'Annoying', 'Obnoxious', 'Racing', 'World', 'Seriously', 'least', 'interesting', 'place', 'movie', 'least', 'interesting', 'characters', 'where', 'spend', 'two-thirds', 'time', 'top', 'script', 'getting', 'muddled', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'host', 'new', ""'rules"", 'just', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'forward', ""'glitches"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'own', 'game', 'reason', 'king', 'can', 'rewrite', 'game', 'code', 'point', 'so', 'much', 'feel', 'playing', 'game', 'little', 'kid', 'who', 'making', 'up', 'new', 'rules', 'just', 'so', 'game', 'can', 'keep', 'going', 'know', 'can', 'keep', 'winning', 'Layer', 'few', 'sub-par', 'performances', 'Ken-the-Intern', 'ugh', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'things', 'drift', 'clever', 'engaging', 'just', 'mostly', 'bearable.But', 'folks', 'Disney', 'are', 'slouches', 'know', 'how', 'when', 'hit', 'most', 'important', 'marks', 'visuals', 'are', 'slick', 'modern', 'imaginative', 'making', 'most', 'pixilation', 'other', 'cute', 'fun', 'video', 'game', 'idiosyncrasies', 'are', 'really', 'fun', 'exciting', 'sequences', 'tightly', 'done', 'action', 'emotional', 'highpoints', 'still', 'somehow', 'resonate', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'hour', 'being', 'entirely', 'bored', 'still', 'found', 'choked', 'up', 'points', 'late', 'second', 'late', 'third', 'acts', 'counts', 'lot', 'little', 'manipulative', 'push', 'right', 'buttons', 'right', 'times', 'make', 'sure', 'stay', 'film', 'end', 'actually', 'INCREDIBLY', 'manipulative', 'skill', 'be', 'respected', 'none', 'less.I', 'think', 'most', 'poor', 'Ralph', 'here', 'just', 'how', 'shallow', 'experience', 'product', 'placement', 'painfully', 'up', 'front', 'sometimes', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'just', 'say', 'name', ""'re"", 'trying', 'sell', 'building', 'context', 'early', 'pricks', 'nostalgia', 'fade', 'pretty', 'quick', 'once', 'realize', 'old', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'resurrected', 'come', 'small', 'handful', 'games', 'Disney', 'trying', 'sell', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'license', 'cheap', 'movie', 'was', 'ultimately', 'built', 'marketing', 'department', 'first', 'later', 'cleaned', 'up', 'art', 'department', 'shows.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'mediocre', 'kid', 'flick', 'engaging', 'heart-string-tugging', 'enough', 'keep', 'little', 'one', 'entertained', 'punch', 'clarity', 'needed', 'call', 'ages', 'romp', 'something', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'years', 'come', 'Growed-ups', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'bored', 'long', 'stretches', 'multiple', 'meandering', 'story-lines', 'finally', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'together', 'surprisingly', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'hipster', 'charm', 'opening', 'minutes', 'fades', 'real', 'fast', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'Also', 'think', 'digital', 'characters', 'lead', 'awful', 'awful', 'existence', 'even', 'more', 'depressing', 'poor', 'Toy', 'Story', 'seriously', 'encourage', 'NOT', 'dwell', 'realities', 'movie', 'just', 'focus', 'fun', 'too', 'depressing', 'otherwise.Enjoy']",Wreck It Ralph

And that feeling of hope and of excitement when it was opened and it was a Nintendo is the same feeling that I got from watching this film. Simply put, the creators of this movie know what it was like to be a kid in the 80s, playing nintendo or some games at an arcade (I was a huge Pac-Man fan).The story revolves around a ""bad guy"" in the game Wreck It Ralph. Ralph has been wrecking for 30 years but he is bored by it and just wants to be accepted by the denizens of the house he keeps wrecking. Those people do love Fix-It-Felix, and Ralph wants some of that love. I sympathize with Ralph. I get where he is coming from and he makes for a good protagonist for our story.The story really kicks it into gear when Ralph leaves his video game, traveling down wires to a Game Junction and goes in search of a medal that he thinks will get him accepted by the people of his game. We see a world at war with alien bugs and a world of candy where people race for accolades. But something sinister is going on in the Sugar Rush. Along the way Ralph ends up causing havoc in two different games but really, he learns a few things and helps a few people and watching it all play out is really wonderful.This is the fifty-second Disney animated feature and I haven't been so excited by one since the Disney Renaissance of the late 80s when Little Mermaid, Beauty and The Beast, The Lion King and Aladdin all came out.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[7, 9]","***A few mild spoilers***TOY STORY is perhaps the finest example of this swell premise, that, when the lights go out and the humans turn away, inanimate objects achieve a life of their own. And this is why puppets have always scared the crap out of me. WRECK-IT RALPH posits that when Litwak's Arcade shuts down for the day, then it's time for the characters that populate the various video games to let their hair down and mingle at Game Central Station, a communal site linked by interconnected power cables and nexus to all the video games in Litwak's.""Hey, you moved my stump. I'm gonna wreck it."" That's motivation and intent from our main man, Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of an old school game called Fix-It Felix, Jr. Ralph is a big, ungainly guy with massive hands and feet, ideal for demolition. He stands at 9 feet tall and weighs over 600 pounds. If you put a quarter in the slot, he'll wreck the crap out of the Niceland apartment building, except that then the handyman, Fix-It Felix, Jr., repairs everything with a mere touch of his magic hammer.Sometimes it's rough being the bad guy. When the work day's done, Ralph is still vilified while Felix is feted. While Felix is invited to parties at the Niceland penthouse, Ralph sleeps and sulks in the town's garbage dump. He attends a weekly support group for video game villains and confesses that, after 30 years on the job, he's tired of playing the bad guy, of being unappreciated. And if you've seen the trailer, then you've already grinned at the unsettled reaction from Clyde, the orange Pac-Man ghost. Determined to be a hero, Ralph sneaks into the recently plugged-in, first person shooter game, Hero's Duty. He's heard that Hero's Duty grants a gold medal to the winner. He believes that a medal will shake up the status quo back in Niceland. But things don't go as planned. Ralph isn't prepared for the grit and violence in Hero's Duty. Plus, it's hard to be the hero when all you know is to wreck things. Two other things he didn't think thru. If a character dies outside of the confines of his own game, he won't regenerate. Also, Ralph's absence is noted by the arcade owner who promptly puts the Fix-It Felix game out of order. This spells doom for the residents of Niceland. It's how folks like Q*bert became homeless.Omigosh, Root Beer Tapper!! WRECK-IT RALPH is the 52nd Disney animated feature film, and this one resurrects your sense of nostalgia, especially if you were a kid of the '80s who spent his or her weeknights and -ends at the local video arcade. A huge chunk of the fun is from trying to catch all the visual references and the gaming injokes. (The sequence with the therapy circle alone is worth the price of admission.) But the film would've gotten tiresome if that's all it was. Thankfully, John C. Reilly, with his likable big lug screen persona, lends a really sympathetic voice as Wreck-It Ralph. The film's emotional core hinges on the unexpected friendship he forms with a misfit child named Vanellope von Schweetz. In the realm of the Sugar Rush kart-racing game, Vanellope is shunned because she's a glitch, an accidental programming. Nevertheless, she yearns to be a racer. She thinks she'll be a good one. She doesn't know how to drive. And now here's Wreck-It Ralph crashlanding into Sugar Rush in an escape pod.Sarah Silverman, confounding my worst expectations, is endearing (and very sardonic) as Vanellope. Maybe it helped that she and John C. Reilly were now and then allowed to improv their dialogue. If you end up with a lump in your throat and maybe misting up, well, I was close to that. And two other noteworthy voice actors: Jane Lynch as the tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun who tracks a possible threat to Sugar Rush and who also drops some of the film's most colorful quotes and Jack McBrayer who is hilarious as the determinedly goody-two-shoes Fix-It Felix. And for the trivia-heads, that's Ed Wynn whom Alan Tudyk is channeling as King Candy. Good casting.So, yeah, I'm pretty biased. This film dives straight into my wheelhouse, and I see no flaws. The animation is a seamless blending of the CG slickness found in the contemporary first person shooter game (like ""Hero's Duty"") and the more rudimentary rendered, pixel-obvious ""classic"" '80s game (like ""Fix-It Felix, Jr.""). The humor amuses on two fronts. Kids will laugh at the gags. Grown-ups will also laugh, but for grown-up reasons. WRECK-IT RALPH is highly recommended for those who relish vivid adventure stories that don't stinge on heart or nostalgia. I think I saw Dig Dug, as well.Lastly, I loved the exquisitely animated lead-in short ""Paperman."" It tells the story of an office drone who tries to catch the attention of a girl by sailing paper airplanes across the imposing gulf of a busy street in New York from his office highrise to hers.",5,...suddenly need a stack of quarters all over again...,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,4830,"['***A', 'few', 'mild', 'spoilers***TOY', 'STORY', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'example', 'swell',

Or at least he is an apartment wrecker, climbing the same apartment building for years, smashing windows and breaking masonry, only to be followed by Fix-it-Felix who repairs the damage with a magical golden hammer. After a hard day's work, what do video game characters do? Like the toys in Toy Story, they kick back and relax, leading their own lives until the arcade opens again tomorrow. Ralph's video game has reached the implausible age of 30, and the resident characters are having a party to celebrate. But they have not invited Ralph, who lives in a junk pile of broken bricks across the street from the apartment.Ralph is despondent about his role as designated bad guy, and even attends a group therapy session for video bad guys. He's advised to follow the philosophy ""I'm bad, and that's good."" But he wants to be recognized as a hero, and starts by going to Game Central, a kind of Grand Central Station where video characters can shop and recreate on their days off. It also offers the forbidden opportunity to access other video games in order to confirm his heroism. In a combat video he wrecks his way to a medal, but has it stolen by a villain and carried off to yet another video game in Candyland. The King here is a cross between the Mad Hatter and the Wizard of Oz, and just too goody-goody to be true.The big auto race known as the Sugar Rush is coming up, and here we encounter an archetype from Disney, the neglected Princess with a fatal flaw. Will Ralph become a hero? Will he rescue the Princess? Will his game avoid the dreaded un-plugging that results from becoming obsolete? Tune in to Wreck-It Ralph for the answers to these and other exciting problems that face the denizens of videoland.This offering from Disney is fast, colorful, and features a host of characters that are interesting without quite becoming loveable.

I was saying lines, singing the songs, replaying scenes in my head... I was immolation invested in this film from 10 minutes in. the first 10 minutes are a little unsure but the plot picks up and then continues to change direction and pace from their. This is a brilliant film; the characters are superbly developed, original and highly entertaining and full of their own unique wit and charm, the format is a concept well managed and creatively manipulated to produce unique story elements, the environments are original and also surprising and unexpected but refreshing and welcome. For a film about video games, it would have been easy to produce something that had worn out, loud and annoying characters (in a bad way Vanellope)and lazily devise a plot line were the characters jump form boring game to boring, poorly rendered lava filled game, trying to recharge some thing to save something or other, but they didn't!! thank goodness... Instead, the majoity of the film is set in the most unlikely game immaginable, and instead this film is a touching story about misunderstood outcasts!! like me!! and a beautiful bond that leaves you emotionally touched for what I think should be forever.I kinda want to stop here. I could go on for hours about how each character is uniquely hilarious and how the film itself is hilarious and how the CGI is the best yet and how its the best CGI film to have been made in many years (Possibly since the original Toy Story, citehtap si evard). I could go on for hours but I wont. Its great, see it, love it, let it change who you are for the better and enjoy*PRODUCT*N/APS, I'm writing this before the item is released.

1525664,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00742SXOM,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","It's very VERY rare that I find myself watching anything from Disney Animation Studios that doesn't have the Pixar logo somewhere in there, but when it came to my personal appeal for a film like WRECK-IT RALPH, I just couldn't resist. Thankfully, my non-resistance was rewarded with an eye-poppingly beautiful, wonderfully intelligent, and tremendously fun love letter to the era of arcade dominance.This film revolves around the character of Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), who is the villain of a game called FIX-IT FELIX JR., where he wrecks an apartment building in a style reminiscent of DONKEY KONG and RAMPAGE, and the character of Fix-It Felix Jr. (voiced by 30 ROCK's Jack McBrayer) just leaps from ledge to ledge and fixes everything, eventually resulting in Ralph being thrown from the building into a pile of mud. The game is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and Ralph is just tired of being separated from the other population of his game, relegated to live in a dump by himself. He's lonely. He joins a support group for other video game villains, and they try to help him through his malaise. He longs to no longer be the bad guy and to be appreciated by the people in his game, and begins a journey that crosses into different video games in pursuit of the one thing that will make the occupants of his game appreciate him: a medal. He journeys into a violent and serious first-person shooter HERO'S DUTY, populated by armored troopers led by Calhoun (voiced by GLEE's Jane Lynch) to steal the medal from that game, but ends up in a cheerful racing game called SUGAR RUSH where he meets that game's populace, including its ruler King Candy (voiced by FIREFLY/SERENITY's Alan Tudyk) and its lovable yet similarly-ostracized misfit Vannelope (voiced by Sarah Silverman). In traditional fashion, Ralph's departure from his own game may have doomed his game to be put out of order, and it also risks the candy-coated empire of SUGAR RUSH as well. In order to stop the threats to these worlds, everyone, especially Ralph, must embrace their character's attributes.As far as the themes of WRECK-IT RALPH are concerned, it certainly does harken back to other animated films, particularly the TOY STORY series in how it shows what your video game characters do once the arcade is closed. It's sometimes a little too familiar, but the inherent charm of the film and its reverence for gamer culture overcomes pretty much all of the film's flaws (of which there aren't really that many, anyway). Under the direction of Rich Moore, who makes his feature directorial debut here after years of working on shows like THE SIMPSONS and FUTURAMA, this CG-film is dazzingly animated, particularly in the brightly-colored cavity-causing land of SUGAR RUSH and the dark, apocalyptic high-def landscape of HERO'S DUTY. The voice work by everyone is excellent. The actors put so much of their personality into these characters, making them very vivid, but particularly standing out is the chameleonic work of Tudyk as villain King Candy, whose voice work on other animated work is also unrecognizable, but always excellent. The film is also packed with cameo appearances from characters from other classic video games from Sonic the Hedgehog to many of the characters from STREET FIGHTER II to TAPPER to PAC-MAN, and on and on. It's pretty much impossible to find all the different characters and games that are ""easter egged"" all over the film, which is actually one of the most fun parts of the film. Another brilliant and hilarious little moment is the using the tools of gorgeous computer animation, yet still having the apartment inhabitants of FIX-IT FELIX's game still move in stunted, 8-bit movement.Most importantly, though, the film tells a really enjoyable and smart story of people trying to defy their nature only to learn that what they needed to do was embrace who they really are. The only flaw I really found with this film was that it is a little too derivative at times. It echoes so many films of the Disney animated oeuvre, but there are very few films of the family animated variety that you can't say that about, and again, the film is just so charming that you can actually embrace some of those flaws.As someone who grew up during the era of the arcade, there's a few moments of the film that are beyond compare for taking a trip down memory lane; for instance, there are at least two time-lapse segments that show different games being put in the arcade, and I was watching, thinking ""I remember that game! That was awesome!"" quite a few times. It's always fun (and occasionally a little melancholy) to watch so much of your youth lovingly being put on display, and even on something of a pedestal.Two bonus things about the Blu-Ray disc worth mentioning: The ""intermission"" segments that Disney introduced on many of their Blu releases that start after you press the pause button are a great idea, but is done really terrifically here with uber-nerd Chris Hardwick hosting these little intermissions and giving you some neat little clues about the easter eggs within the film. Also more than worth the price of admission here is the inclusion of Disney's Oscar-winning animated short PAPERMAN, which is a return to good-old hand-drawn animation (with I believe has a blend of CG backgrounds), and is so tremendously moving and beautiful that I dare you not to tear up a little bit while watching.All in all, WRECK-IT RALPH is a very satisfying film experience, and you'll be hard-pressed to find many better animated films that came out this past year (with the exception of BRAVE, which just works better).4.5 out of 5 stars.",5,A wonderful and heartfelt tribute to the

1525702,A157TEI9T3L3IH,B00742SXOM,Joe,"[0, 0]","I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of any age, as it talks to everyone who's ever liked video games. There are plenty of vintage characters included - Qubert and Pac-Man, just to mention a few, as well as newer games that are holding the current generation of games hostage to their TVs.The story revolves around a game called Fix-It Felix Jr. and his nemesis, Wreck-It Ralph. As can be deduced from the titles, Felix Jr. is a good guy who is always fixing the damage done by a giant wrecking-ball-sized character called Ralph, who becomes jaded after 30 years of being a bad guy and getting no recognition, and leaves his game in search of adventure. Ralph finds some new friends and encounters an ancient evil in disguise. Ralph finds what he is looking for and gets to be a hero, but not in the way he thought, and in the process saves his whole world!This charming and engaging animated movie is targeted toward younger children, and has very friendly language (for the most part), but it also includes references and jokes that are very funny for adults too, and the message that Ralph learns while escaping his circumstances is not preachy at all, in my opinion.

1525706,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00742SXOM,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 1]","***This review may contain spoilers.***For many of the same reasons that the ""Toy Story"" franchise has proven to be an enduring masterpiece, the ""Video Game Story"" ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" (hereafter ""WIR"") is certain to do the same.  From seemingly dull-witted, destructive, and vilified ""bad-guy oaf"" Ralph's (John C. Reilly's) simple wish to earn a medal and subsequent respect from other video game characters, WIR explores prejudice, rejection, the need for acceptance and appreciation, compassion for fellow misfits, and the requirements of true heroism.  We've been exposed to these lessons before, but WIR is a nostalgically winning, kinetic, and ultimately poignant refresher course.In particular, I appreciated WIRs subtle reminder not to judge a book by its cover.  Resembling a human version of Donkey Kong (no offense, Ralph), Ralph might lead us to the knee-jerk  conclusion that if a character is physically impressive, he must be short on brains.  Ralph isn't.  Especially for a guy whose job it is to demolish a video game penthouse before cheerful carpenter Felix (Jack MacBrayer) can repair it, Ralph is a pretty sensitive, observant, and rational soul.  He knows it's not right that the other Fix-It Felix, Jr. characters shun him and relegate him to the nearby dump and won't even invite him in the video game's 30th anniversary party.  Ralph has tried support-group villain therapy, but it doesn't really work because the other members are resigned to a fate they think they can't control.  Even Tapper (Maurice LeMarche), Ralph's bartender confidant, has no suggestions for breaking out of the rut.However, fate literally collides with Ralph when he runs into an armored infantryman from the ""Hero's Duty"" war game, who informs him that anyone who breaches a tower in the game wins a medal.  Ralph believes that by winning a medal, he can win others' respect. Ralph takes the infantryman's place and, despite his strength, finds it tough sledding handling the non-stop battle to stop a bunch of attacking giant alien beetles (shades of ""Starship Troopers"") AND handling tough, brusque no-nonsense Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun (Jane Lynch).  Nevertheless, Ralph manages to scale the tower and win the medal.Through more ""Hero's Duty"" mishaps, Ralph lands in a fighter-type flyer with one of the alien bugs, zooms throughout the video universe and eventually crash-lands in another video-game, a candy-land race-car game named ""Sugar Rush"".  A crafty, sassy, little wannabe racer and ""glitch"" named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) seizes the medal from Ralph and uses it to earn a spot in the ""Sugar Rush"" racing derby.  As a ""glitch"", Vanellope finds it hard to literally keep herself together.  If she competes in the derby and finishes the race, even if she doesn't win, Vanellope will become a full-fledged, ""unglitched"" video racer.Although Vanellope is even more of a misfit and pariah than Ralph, naturally the two snipe at and antagonize each other at first.  Then Vanellope realizes they can help each other; if Ralph can help her build a race car and train as a racer, she can win back the medal for him as well as achieve her dream.  Ralph grudgingly agrees and a close (if still contentious) friendship blossoms.But Ralph's actions have opened a Pandora's Box of chaos for the video universe.  Without him, the Fix-It Felix, Jr. game is out of order and defunct, compelling Felix to join up with Sergeant Calhoun to seek Ralph and the lost flyer/beetle respectively.  Some video characters fear Ralph has become like ""Turbo"", a fiendishly rogue racer who has disrupted (and may still be disrupting) other video games. The seemingly kindly and addle-brained King Candy (Alan Tudyk), ruler of ""Sugar Rush"" may have a hidden sinister agenda regarding Vanellope.  The beetle Ralph accidentally brought with him to ""Sugar Rush"" may be multiplying and proliferating and threatening Candy Land's existence.  Worst of all, as a ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" video image reminds us, a video character who dies outside his game dies permanently.  Can Ralph undo the disorder he has wrought and rise above his desires to save not only Vanellope but the whole video universe, even if he has to sacrifice himself?WIR is an unbridled visual, sensory, and mental delight that again vividly reminds that  all beings (even ""bad guys"") have a purpose in the universe, that we all deserve care, attention and respect, and, as Ralph eventually and spectacularly finds out, that finding redemption and heroism means putting others' needs before our own.",5,"A Left-Out ""Lummox"" Learns About His Place in the (Video) Universe and What a ""Hero's

(In ""Brave"", the ostensible heroine of the story, Princess Merida, does nothing brave or virtuous to try to correct the mess she has created.)  In ""Wreck-It Ralph"" Disney makes a 180 degree turn: the ""hero"" Ralph puts his own life at risk to correct the mess he created.  ""WIR"" has all of the elements of great story telling - self-sacrifice, friendship, overcoming diversity (Vanellope uses her ""glitch"" disability to save Ralph from certain death), and so on.  Call me Pollyanna, but in my opinion, in order for the public to love a story, the characters should discover within themselves these virtues.  (Think ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Ratatouille"".)  Hopefully ""WIR"" will be a wake-up call to Disney to produce new animated films (and not just sequels of past glories) with good story telling along the lines of ""WIR"".The animation is superb.  I particularly like the way that ""old"" video game characters (such as Tapper (the bartender) and Gene (one of the inhabitants of Ralph's game)) are animated with non-fluid motions.While ""WIR"" includes numerous nods to various video games over the last 30 years (which gaming aficionados will no doubt enjoy), having a lack of familiarity with these games (as do I) does not detract from the story.Beyond good story telling, the story line is solid - no ""glitches"" here.",5,Superb story telling and animation,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1414,"['last', 'review', 'Disney', 'animation', 'feature', 'Brave', 'trashed', 'movie', 'very', 'poor', 'story', 'telling', 'Brave', 'ostensible', 'heroine', 'story', 'Princess', 'Merida', 'nothing', 'brave', 'virtuous', 'try', 'correct', 'mess', 'created', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'Disney', '180', 'degree', 'turn', 'hero', 'Ralph', 'own', 'life', 'risk', 'correct', 'mess', 'created', 'WIR', 'elements', 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'self-sacrifice', 'friendship', 'overcoming', 'diversity', 'Vanellope', 'glitch', 'disability', 'save', 'Ralph', 'certain', 'death', 'so', 'Call', 'Pollyanna', 'opinion', 'order', 'public', 'love', 'story', 'characters', 'should', 'discover', 'virtues', 'Think', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Ratatouille', 'Hopefully', 'WIR', 'will', 'be', 'wake-up', 'call', 'Disney', 'produce', 'new', 'animated', 'films', 'not', 'just', 'sequels', 'past', 'glories', 'good', 'story', 'telling', 'lines', 'WIR', '.The', 'animation', 'superb', 'particularly', 'way', 'old', 'video', 'game', 'characters', 'such', 'Tapper', 'bartender', 'Gene', 'one', 'inhabitants', 'Ralph', 'game', 'are', 'animated', 'non-fluid', 'motions.While', 'WIR', 'numerous', 'nods', 'various', 'video', 'games', 'last', '30', 'years', 'gaming', 'aficionados', 'will', 'doubt', 'enjoy', 'having', 'lack', 'familiarity', 'games', 'do', 'not', 'detract', 'story.Beyond', 'good', 'story', 'telling', 'story', 'line', 'solid', 'glitches', 'here']",Wreck It Ralph

1525718,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B00742SXOM,Josh,"[0, 0]","Two Years ago, if you had told me Disney (not Pixar) was making a movie with video games as characters, I would simply laugh and say ""the people at Disney have gone nuts"". Here recently however, I have found that sometimes its the movies we write off or ignore, are the main movies that should not be missed. That said, Wreck It Ralph should not be missed. It is one of Disney's best movies. I honestly do not understand how Brave won the title as Best Animated Feature at this years Academy Awards when Wreck It Ralph is clearly the better movie, but oh well.Wreck It Ralph stars John C Reily as the title character Ralph. Enter Ralph: 9 feet tall 640 something pound character in an arcade game who is a bad guy that desperately wants to be a good guy. For what its worth, his character is very likeable. Then we have Jack Mcbrayer as Fix it Felix, Jane Lynch as Sergeant Calhoun, and Sarah Silverman as the loveable Vanellope von Schweetz. Vanellope's character is also very interesting. She is a young girl who is initially an outcast because she is a ""glitch"" in the game she is in but as the movie progresses, you ultimately come to realize there is clearly more to her character than meets the eye.The story line is what this movie delivers best. It not only brings laughs, notable touching moments, and video game cameos from past and present, but it also deals with issues (like bullying) that need to be addressed and it does it very well. It also goes to show that sometimes it IS the little things that count.I have to say again, I did not expect to like this movie. But after multiple viewings, it is one I love and had to own in my collection. People young and old will enjoy Wreck It Ralph.5 Stars",5,This time DISNEY's done it again,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,1712,"['Two', 'Years', 'ago', 'had', 'told', 'Disney', 'not', 'Pixar', 'was', 'making', 'movie', 'video', 'games', 'characters', 'would', 'simply', 'laugh', 'say', 'people', 'Disney', 'have', 'gone', 'nuts', 'Here', 'recently', 'however', 'have', 'found', 'movies', 'write', 'off', 'ignore', 'are', 'main', 'movies', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'said', 'Wreck', 'Ralph', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'one', 'Disney', 'best', 'movies', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'Brave', 'won', 'title', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'years', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'when', 'Wreck', 'Ralph', 'clearly', 'better', 'movie', 'oh', 'well.Wreck', 'Ralph', 'John', 'C', 'Reily', 'title', 'character', 'Ralph', 'Enter', 'Ralph', '9', 'feet', 'tall', '640', 'something', 'pound', 'character', 'arcade', 'game', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'desperately', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'what', 'worth', 'character', 'very', 'likeable', 'Then', 'have', 'Jack', 'Mcbrayer', 'Fix', 'Felix', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Sergeant', 'Calhoun', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'loveable', 'Vanellope', 'von', 'Schweetz', 'Vanellope', 'character', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'initially', 'outcast', 'glitch', 'game', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'come', 'realize', 'clearly', 'more', 'character', 'eye.The', 'story', 'line', 'what', 'movie', 'best', 'not', 'only', 'laughs', 'notable', 'touching', 'moments', 'video', 'game', 'cameos', 'past', 'present', 'also', 'issues', 'bullying', 'need', 'be', 'addressed', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'show', 'sometimes', 'little', 'things', 'count.I', 'have', 'say', 'again', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'like', 'movie', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'one', 'love', 'had', 'own', 'collection', 'People', 'young', 'old', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Wreck', 'Ralph.5', 'Stars']",Wreck It Ralph

1525726,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00742SXOM,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Honestly, I tend not to get too excited when it comes to new releases from Disney. In my opinion, over the past few years, very few of their non-sequels have held any real value, and I&#8217;ve reached a point where I find myself just skipping them altogether, but a movie about video games? A movie centered on a video game character with multiple references to iconic franchises like Street Fighter, Sonic, and Pac Man? You don&#8217;t need to say much more than that to grab my attention. In fact, I&#8217;m surprised it took me this long to actually get around to watching Wreck-It Ralph.The story follows the titular Ralph (John C. Reilly) of the fictional arcade game, Fix-It Felix, Jr. For 30 years, Ralph has seen many games come and go, but his game has managed to keep a small amount of popularity among customers. However, after 30 years Ralph has become unsatisfied with being the bad guy. He wants to live in the nice hotel with the townspeople, he wants the pastries given to the hero Fix-It Felix, Jr. (Jack McBrayer), and he wants a little praise and recognition for his hard work. Unfortunately, after jumping games to achieve a medal, Ralph puts his game, and many others, in jeopardy.As the story progresses there are many cameos from different video game characters as well as references to video game history. For example, during the Bad-Anon support group&#8212;which is easily the most memorable segment from the entire film&#8212;you get to see appearances from Zangief and M. Bison from Street Fighter as well as Dr. Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog and the orange ghost (aka Clyde) from Pac Man. In addition, there are a few other Street Fighter sightings as well as an appearance from Frogger and Q*bert. There is obviously a great deal of nostalgic love towards classic video games here and I&#8217;m more than okay with that.What I would have liked to have seen, though, was the inclusion of actual games worlds. With the exception of Tapper and the Pac Man grid, most of the story takes place either in the Fix-It Felix, Jr. or Sugar Rush arcade cabinets. I understand that these old arcade games don&#8217;t give you much to work with, but I&#8217;m sure they could have come up with something. Plus, in my opinion, the Sugar Rush world got old really fast. Still, I thought the way these characters traveled between cabinets was very creative, as was the Game Central Station.One thing that really surprised me was the story&#8217;s pacing and structure. While Wreck-It Ralph is always pushing forward, and there&#8217;s very little down time, the story never felt rushed or unfocused. There was always a clear goal in mind, and the journey there was both structured and entertaining at the same time. Also, I really enjoyed the unpredictability of the story&#8217;s ending. While I never feared for Ralph or Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) because this is a children&#8217;s movie, I was genuinely surprised by the big plot twist near the end.With that said, though, the writing is kind of a mixed bag. On one hand, it is very creative in the way they made these different game worlds interact with each other. On the other hand, they try too hard to appeal to the younger audience. It doesn&#8217;t take a rocket scientist to realize why the main world we&#8217;re in is Sugar Rush, and there are some chunks of comedy that are obviously aimed solely at the children. The worst example would be toward the end when Ralph and Vanellope are exchanging crude names back and forth. These &#8220;creative&#8221; names range from &#8220;President Fartfeathers&#8221; to &#8220;Major Body Odor.&#8221;However, there is more than enough to get the older audience laughing as well. For example, when we first meet Sugar Rush&#8217;s main cast, there are two sets of bleachers. One that says &#8220;Assorted Fans&#8221;&#8212;a mix of different candy&#8212;and another that says &#8220;With Nuts.&#8221; The former are cheering normally while the latter is going insane. I&#8217;ll admit, I probably laughed at this longer than I should have. There were others as well, but that one stuck out the most to me.Finally, as with the writing, the voice acting is a mixed bag as well. For one, I really enjoyed John C. Reilly as Ralph and Jack McBrayer as Fix-It Felix, Jr. Both felt perfect for their roles, and they did a remarkable job with their characters. In addition, Jane Lynch was amazing as Sergeant Jean Calhoun, and Alan Tudyk&#8217;s King Candy felt strangely similar Ed Wynn&#8217;s Mad Hatter, in a good way. However, I loathed what Silverman did with Vanellope. The girl is supposed to be, like, seven years old, but she sounds like she&#8217;s 50 with a really bad cold. For me at least, every time she spoke it sounded like nails on a chalkboard.Overall Score: 8/10 - It may be true that Wreck-It Ralph has its faults, but it&#8217;s still an enjoyable experience. The characters are charming, and there&#8217;s an obvious love of classic video games, which shows in many scenes. If you&#8217;re a Disney enthusiast, a video game lover, or a mixture of the two, there&#8217;s no reason you shouldn&#8217;t give this your time. It&#8217;s definitely something I would watch again.",4,8/10 - Undeniably entertaining,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,5258,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Honestly', 'tend',

Seeing the previews, I couldn't wait to see it.Plot- Wreck-it Ralph is tired of always being the bad guy and wants to try to win a medal and show he can do good things.Characters- There are nods to some of the more retro games. Q-bert, tapper, pac man, and a few other classics made appearances.Animations- Simply incredible, what you would expect from a Disney caliber film. From such details as having a slight delay in the ""Fix it Felix, JR."" characters to the HDness of newer games. It is obvious a lot of thought was put into this aspect of the film.Here are my complaints:1. It had a good start and a strong ending, but the middle seemed lacking. After thinking about it, perhaps they spent too much time on the build up in Sugar Rush. I almost feel asleep! They could have added in visiting a few more video games, perhaps some more of the old school ones. Either that or cut some material and make it a shorter film.2. There was quite a bit of violence in it. For me this is fine, but I wonder how much you want to expose younger children to. Case in point, in hero duty the main premise of the game is to blast alien bugs. Another example is when the heroine from Hero Duty slaps Fix it Felix, jr. repeatedly to attract the laughy taffy. Talk about encouraging slapping!In the end it was a good film for an older game nerd such as myself, but I question bringing younger Disney-esque audiences to see it.

It's a story of the ""bad guy"" in an old arcade game that is living on borrowed time.  Ralph (John C. Reilly) goes to meetings of a sort of AA group for villains of arcade games, but he's determined to not be thought of as a bad guy.  The other characters in his game, ""Fix it Felix,"" don't want to associate with Ralph, and give him no credit for wrecking things so the game has a reason to exist so Felix (a really nice handiman) can fix-it.  Felix gets a medal each time he saves the day, and Ralph feels he'll be accepted if he can get a medal.  He sneaks into a commando game, and breaks all the rules to finally win a medal, but in the process releases a ""bug"" that he accidentally introduces into the sugary-sweet game of ""Sugar Rush""  Stuck in that game, and searching for his medal, he meets the Glitch, aka Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), an outcast who is adorable and irritating at the same time.  She is determined to win an upcoming race, and Ralph sees her winning as the only way to get his medal back - until King Candy convinces him otherwise.The rest of the film is brilliantly funny plot points and endearing moments as Felix and the Commando leader search for Ralph and the bug, and Ralph realizes that Vanellope is really meant to be the main character in Sugar Rush, and fights to make things right.This film is amazing, and a wonderful work of animation from Walt Disney Feature Animation.

1525754,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00742SXOM,Kenya Starflight,"[1, 1]","For whatever reason, it seems that movies based on video games almost universally fail on some level -- they either fail to be a true adaptation of the original game, they bomb at the box office, or some combination of both.  Is there some fundamental difference between video games and films that makes it ultimately impossible to adapt a video game to the big screen, or is it just a case of the filmmakers not caring?  Even films that are simply about video games, such as ""The Wizard,"" tend to be lackluster.""Wreck-It Ralph,"" while not an adaptation of any specific video game, manages to break the losing streak.  This may be the best video-game movie by a long shot, if not one of the best animated films of 2012.""Wreck-It Ralph"" stars the titular Ralph, villain of an old arcade game called ""Fix-It Felix Jr.""  Tired of being hated, feared, and ignored as a bad guy, Ralph sets out to prove he can be a hero by winning a medal in another game in the arcade.  His journey takes him first to the first-person-shooter world of ""Hero's Duty,"" then to the candy-coated racing game ""Sugar Rush,"" all the while pursued by Felix, the hero of his own game, and Calhoun, a tough and cynical soldier from Hero's Duty.  Ralph eventually befriends Vanellope, a ""glitch"" character from Sugar Rush, and agrees to help her gain recognition as a true video game character, only to uncover a darker side to the saccharine racer game... and inadvertantly bring a villain from Hero's Duty to Sugar Rush.  And in the end, it may be up to a villain and a glitch to set things right.First of all, don't be too fooled by the cover -- characters such as Sonic, Dr. Eggman, Q*bert, and M. Bison have only cameos in this film (though Q*bert does actually help get the plot rolling).  Still, it's rather fun to watch the movie and find all the references, both obvious and subtle, to classic and popular video games.  Even two of the major games in the film are obvious homages to real games (Fix-It Felix Jr. bears a strong resemblance to Donkey Kong, and Hero's Duty looks like a combination of Call of Duty and Halo).The world of the film itself is brilliantly realized -- each game is its own little world, with power cords connecting each game like an electronic train system (surge protectors serve as terminals), and there's an internal set of rules to this digital universe that makes sense.  Each game also has its own unique look, whether it's the retro, pixellated look of older games such as ""Fix-It Felix,"" slickly high-resolution and gritty games such as ""Hero's Duty"" (as gritty as a PG movie will allow, at least), or over-the-top sugary and cutesy like ""Sugar Rush.""  And if you've ever wondered what a first-person shooter or game code looks like from inside the game, this movie provides a clever visualization of both.The characters, too, are fun to get to know.  Ralph, despite technically being a villain, is adorable, and it's hard not to empathize with his desire to just be liked and accepted.  Felix, as the hero of a kid's game, is rather hilariously innocent, and actually quite a likeable character -- it would have been too easy for the filmmakers to turn him into the movie's antagonist and make him an ego-driven jerk, but thankfully they avoid that cliche.  Vanellope starts out annoying, but it's hard not to empathize with her desire to fit in and be seen as something other than a ""mistake.""  And Calhoun, though she falls into the cliche of the battle-hardened soldier with a dark past, manages to be enjoyably snarky, and seems to realize just how out of place she is in the cutesy world of Sugar Rush.This film works on quite a few levels.  It's an enjoyable kids' film (though some moments might be too scary for very young viewers), with enough clever humor and action for adults to be entertained as well.  It's also a loving tribute to retro arcade games, and contains quite a few in-jokes that hardcore gamers will appreciate.  And it also works as a sort of ""spiritual successor"" to the Toy Story films -- in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it inhabits the same universe, seeing as its concept, of playthings coming to life in the absence of humans, is quite similar.Wonderful family film, with some friendly nods to the retro and modern gamer crowd.  Highly recommended.P.S.  The theater run of this film included a black-and-white animated short called ""Paperman,"" a sweet and lighthearted cel-shaded CGI feature that's effectively told without dialogue or any color save a hint of red lipstick.  I'm thrilled to see that this will be included in the DVD release.",5,"Finally, a video game movie that's actually GOOD",1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,4590,"['reason', 'movies', 'based', 'video', 'games', 'almost', 'universally', 'fail', 'level', 'fail', 'be', 'true', 'adaptation', 'original', 'game', 'bomb', 'box', 'office', 'combination', 'there', 'fundamental', 'difference', 'video', 'games', 'films', 'ultimately', 'impossible', 'adapt', 'video', 'game', 'big', 'screen', 'just', 'case', 'filmmakers', 'not', 'caring', 'Even', 'films', 'are', 'simply', 'video', 'games', 'such', 'Wizard', 'tend', 'be', 'lackluster', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'not', 'adaptation', 'specific', 'video', 'game', 'break', 'losing', 'streak', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'video-game', 'movie', 'long', 'shot', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'films', '2012', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'titular', 'Ralph', 'villain', 'old', 'arcade', 'game', 'called', 'Fix-It', 'Felix', 'Jr.', 'Tired', 'being', 'hated', 'feared', 'ignored', 'bad', 'guy', 'Ralph', 'out', 'prove', 'can', 'be', 'hero', 'winning', 'medal', 'game', 'arcade', 'journey', 'first', 'first-person-shooter', 'world', 'Hero', 'Duty', 'then', 'candy-coated', 'racing', 'game', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'while', 'pursued', 'Felix', 'hero', 'own', 'game', 'Calhoun', 'tough', 'cynical', 'soldier', 'Hero', 'Duty', 'Ralph', 'eventually', 'Vanellope', 'glitch', 'character', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'help', 'gain', 'recognition', 'true', 'video', 'game', 'character', 'only', 'uncover', 'darker', 'side', 'saccharine', 'racer', 'game', 'inadvertantly', 'bring', 'villain', 'Hero', 'Duty', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'up', 'villain', 'glitch', 'set', 'things', 'right.First', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'fooled', 'cover', 'characters', 'such', 'Sonic', 'Dr.', 'Eggman', 'Q*bert', 'M.', 'Bison', 'have', 'only', 'cameos', 'film', 'Q*bert', 'actually', 'help', 'get', 'plot', 'rolling', 'Still', 'rather', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'references', 'obvious', 'subtle', 'classic', 'popular', 'video', 'games', 'Even', 'two', 'major', 'games', 'film', 'are', 'obvious', 'homages', 'real', 'games', 'Fix-It', 'Felix', 'Jr.', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'Hero', 'Duty', 'combination', 'Call', 'Duty', 'Halo', '.The', 'world', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'realized', 'game', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'power', 'cords', 'connecting', 'game', 'electronic', 'train', 'system', 'surge', 'protectors', 'serve', 'terminals', 'internal', 'set', 'rules', 'digital', 'universe', 'sense', 'game', 'also', 'own', 'unique', 'look', 'retro', 'pixellated', 'look', 'older', 'games', 'such', 'Fix-It', 'Felix', 'slickly', 'high-resolution', 'gritty', 'games', 'such', 'Hero', 'Duty', 'as', 'gritty', 'PG', 'movie', 'will', 'allow', 'least', 'over-the-top', 'sugary', 'cutesy', 'Sugar', 'Rush', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'first-person', 'shooter', 'game', 'code', 'game', 'movie', 'clever', 'visualization', 'both.The', 'characters', 'too', 'are', 'fun', 'get', 'know', 'Ralph', 'technically', 'being', 'villain', 'adorable', 'hard', 'not', 'empathize', 'desire', 'just', 'be', 'liked', 'accepted', 'Felix', 'hero', 'kid', 'game', 'rather', 'hilariously', 'innocent', 'actually', 'quite', 'likeable', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'easy', 'filmmakers', 'turn', 'movie', 'antagonist', 'make', 'ego-driven', 'jerk', 'thankfully', 'avoid', 'cliche', 'Vanellope', 'out', 'annoying', 'hard', 'not', 'empathize', 'desire', 'fit', 'be', 'seen', 'something', 'other', 'mistake', 'Calhoun', 'cliche', 'battle-hardened', 'soldier', 'dark', 'past', 'be', 'enjoyably', 'snarky', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'place', 'cutesy', 'world', 'Sugar', 'Rush.This', 'film', 'works', 'few', 'levels', 'enjoyable', 'kids', 'film', 'moments', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'very', 'young', 'viewers', 'enough', 'clever', 'humor', 'action', 'adults', 'be', 'entertained', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'loving', 'tribute', 'retro', 'arcade', 'games', 'quite', 'few', 'in-jokes', 'hardcore', 'gamers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'also', 'sort', 'spiritual', 'successor', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'fact', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'same', 'universe', 'seeing', 'concept', 'playthings', 'coming', 'life', 'absence', 'humans', 'quite', 'similar.Wonderful', 'family', 'film', 'friendly', 'nods', 'retro', 'modern', 'gamer', 'crowd', 'Highly', 'recommended.P.S', 'theater', 'run', 'film', 'included', 'black-and-white', 'animated', 'short', 'called', 'Paperman', 'sweet', 'lighthearted', 'cel-shaded', 'CGI', 'feature', 'effectively', 'told', 'dialogue', 'color', 'save', 'hint', 'red', 'lipstick', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'DVD', 'release']",Wreck It Ralph

The first half of the movie flowed along well, great character development, but then when he gets over to the Sugar Rush game the momentum of the film grinds down.When it was all said and done I did enjoy the movie, but when the story shifts from being about Ralph to being about Vanellope it took what seemed like a personal growth journey for Ralph and shifted it to being just another animated adventure mixed with MarioKart.If you like the retro games, remember playing Qbert and Beer Tapper, if you love you some beautiful CG, than you should check this out. Wreck It Ralph has good heart, it has a great voice cast, and very subtle humor. I looked forward to watching and wasn't disappointed, but the movie wasn't all that it could have been. Maybe I had too high of hopes being a life long gamer starting in the days of 8-bits and terrible E.T. games so this movie was speaking my language, and I think that may have been my problem, was that it started out as a homage to old video games in a modern world and at some point veered into a standard animated movie.

1525763,A2M4BJK1LPB2OW,B00742SXOM,Kit Cat,"[1, 1]","Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called ""Sugar Rush"". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever - a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).John C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the ""Sugar Rush"" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a ""glitch"" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the ""Fix-it Felix"" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as ""Hero's Duty"", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.I didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.Generally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it.",5,"BRILLIANT!

1525766,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B00742SXOM,K. Ostrowski,"[1, 6]","Wreck-it Ralph was a film that dared to dream big.  The premise, according to all the commercials, was about video game characters coming to life when the arcade closes and meeting with one another in their off hours.  In the midst of all this, a video game bad guy named Ralph decides that he's sick of being a villain and wants to become a hero and earn a medal, but where would a big, tough, giant of a man with enormous hands be able to earn a medal?Showcasing Ralph's quest, and the many encounters with characters from -real- video games, the ads for the film promised the story of a strong, powerful protagonist who faces insurmountable odds and achieves his goal of truly getting the recognition that he deserves.  There were also some brief clips of some little, candy brat doing a stupid and un-funny routine where she insults him for no reason, but at worst, we thought, she'll be like Timon and Puumba; a latecomer who's annoying at times, but doesn't disrupt the movie.Big mistake.As I saw it, there were four big factors in this movie; four things that it seemed to be trying to accomplish.1. Ralph's impressiveness as a main character.2. The fun of the journey and the search for the reward.3. The reforming of Ralph into a hero, and the handling of heroism in general in the movie; its moral center.4. The presence and relevance of the other video game characters from other video games.I'm going to be judging the film on its handling of each of these areas, since, when you get down to it, these are the areas in which the movie had a chance to really shine.1. There's no doubt that Ralph had a lot of potential as a hero, and it's been a while since we've seen a hero of his type.  He's 9 feet tall, weighs over 600 lbs, and his fists are larger than his head.  Not only that, but given the length of his arms, this is clearly the sort of bruiser who you don't want to tangle with in a straight-up fight.  Ralph has the potential to be a terrifying enemy, or an incredible hero; a man's man, who gets the job done, and almost threatens to bring the notion back into the public eye, that men can be heroes too.The only question is; how much of this potential was used?  Sadly, the answer is ""hardly any.""Ralph does get to use his great strength, speed and smashing powers on a semi-regular basis, but as for coming across as a bruiser, or a manly guy, who one might actually want to be like, there's almost none of that here.Ralph is played up, from the very start, as a comedy fall guy.  In his early attempts to acquire a medal, he blunders around, panics, trips, falls, gets yelled at, sets off traps and activates dozens of deadly enemy bug-eggs.  Still, these things can happen, even to a very impressive hero.Unfortunately, Ralph's personality is done little better.  He's portrayed largely as an unthreatening, sitcom oaf, who has his desires and all that, but never needs to be taken too seriously, and sure enough, the other characters don't take him seriously at all.  He complains about not getting cake, whines when he's stopped by the embodiment of a surge protector, and generally acts sad and mopey over his lot in life, and even when he decides to take action, it's done in more of a ""ah-ha!  I have a plan!"" way, rather than demonstrating real, strong determination to change his life.However, perhaps the worst thing about Ralph's presentation as the main character is that he's really -not- the main character.  That honor is reserved for Vanilly... Vanelly...  Sarah Silverman, who plays a bratty little girl from a candyland-inspired slot car racing game called ""Sugar Rush,"" (which, like ""Fix-it Felix Jr,"" Ralph's game, is not a real game at all.)  About a third of the way into the movie, Ralph finds himself in Sugar Rush, and then that's pretty much it.  The part of the movie that you wanted to see, about Ralph struggling to attain his goal and being a cool main character is pretty much over.The Sarah Silverman character steals Ralph's medal and runs off, trouncing and outdoing him in climbing, running and pretty much everything else with embarrassing ease.  Try to imagine your favorite baseball player getting up to bat, and being just -utterly humiliated- by a five-year-old girl with a squeaky voice, who thinks she's funny, and isn't.  As spacious as Ralph's faults may be, he's still supposed to be the main character, and we don't want to see this done to him.However, you'd better get used to it.  Sarah Silverman continues humiliating Ralph.  She's annoying and bratty, never learns a single lesson of any value, and yet, the director wants us to believe she's always right.  Sarah Silverman is annoying, even when she's -not- saddled with this kind of role.  Frankly, the whole thing from this point on made me wince, particularly since we're apparently supposed to start caring about her, and want her to succeed, even though she's already proven that she's a liar and a thief, and doesn't care about Ralph -at all.-  No.  Just no.  This movie fails to make Ralph an impressive, manly main character, because he's not nearly as impressive as he should be, comes off as more oafish than manly, and isn't even the main character.2. Is the journey any fun?  Are we excited to see whether or not Ralph will get his reward?  Well, no.  Not really.  Even at the start, Ralph's motives for wanting the medal are a little materialistic and unsatisfying.  He seems less concerned with being appreciated than with medals, and cakes and penthouses; things that you can touch.  His reasons for going on the quest just felt too physical to me.  It's not like Aladdin, who wants to be treated as more than just street scum, or Belle, who wants some excitement and something transcendent;  beyond her normal life.  These are purely material desires, and frankly, I can't sympathize.As I said, Ralph tends to panic and flee when he's confronted with difficult and dangerous circumstances, which puts a massive damper on the excitement and fun of the quest.  You might as well just admit that Ralph; whatever his potential, isn't much of a hero at this point, and of course, a fun quest that does not make.If it's not fun at -that- stage, it's certainly a great deal -less- fun when Sarah Silverman is introduced, and the movie takes a hard left turn away from the quest that it was supposed to be about.  Eventually, it's completely forgotten.Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  In many movies, the initial motivation is for riches, or power, or recognition, and the character ultimately learns that these are not as important as family and happiness, and doing the right thing.  All well and good.The problem is that in -this- movie, what replaces the medal is -not- good, wholesome values, but just Ralph's desire to be ""liked"" by Sarah Silverman, and doing things that will make her feel better.  This is a problem for two reasons.  1. Being liked is not a virtue.  2. Doing things that make people feel better is not a virtue.  This movie replaces shallow materialism with the slightly-less-shallow motive of wanting to be liked by at least one person.  A fun quest that does not make.3. What is the moral center of the movie?  Is Ralph a hero?  Is he made into a hero, and does he reform?  Is this a story of a person reforming from their evil ways?Well, no.  It's not.  The premise of the film is that all characters in video games are essentially actors playing roles.  Therefore, the heroes are often not terribly heroic, and the villains not terribly villainous, once you catch them off-duty.  Therefore, no real reforming needs to be done.  Ralph isn't a -real- villain.  He just plays one on TV.Of course, this raises several questions.  Why do the hero and the NPCs treat Ralph like an outcast outside of work hours?  Isn't that -actually- evil?  I mean, he didn't do anything wrong.  He just did what he was supposed to do; wreck the building, so Felix could fix it.  Ralph was just doing what he was hired (essentially) to do.  The reaction of the NPCs is essentially elitism on the basis of the pre-determined caste system that was programmed into them, and ultimately, that makes them the real bad guys for most of the movie.Strangely, many of the other video game villains seem similar to Ralph in that sense; not horrible people; just actors doing their jobs.Here's the problem.  Throughout the entire movie, they continue using the word ""bad"" to mean ""the role of villain in a game,"" and ""good"" to mean ""the role of hero in a game,"" and that is -not- what those words mean.  I almost got the impression that the movie was trying to imply that -real- good and evil were as insubstantial as the roles that one plays in the acting profession, which is just a total rejection of the most basic foundations of all true knowledge.  It's a false as false can be.This aspect of the film really comes to a head when Ralph performs a truly heroic act near the movie's end, while reciting the ""bad guy affirmation,"" about how he'll never be ""good,"" and the only thing he wants to be is himself.  If there is one line that can utterly kill the substance of an act of heroic self-sacrifice on the part of a main character, this is it.In the end, of course, people start to appreciate Ralph a little more, and treat him a little better, but through it all, the substance of -real- good and evil is lost in the dust.  Heroism is demonstrated, but not addressed, and the movie's moral core seems to aim, rather, at a sort of Hollywood, rich-people, anti-moralism than any sort of actual moral message that a kid could understand or benefit from.4. That brings us to the final area on which this movie should be judged; the video game characters who make appearances.  I got the impression that this movie wanted to emulate ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" which had a lot of guest-appearances by other characters from other cartoons, from Bugs Bunny to Mickey Mouse.  This is, in fact, the aspect of the film that's showcased most in the trailers; the video game guest stars, but I hope you enjoyed those trailers, because they covered -nearly all- of the guest appearances by real game characters in this movie.The bad guy meeting has a bunch of guest characters, then there are the brief scenes in game central station, and a scene in the Tapper video game.  Q-bert and his pals show up in a few more scenes, but aside from those, that's pretty much all the guest appearances you'll see, most of which, as I said, are in the film's first third, before the Sugar Rush debacle.Yes, it's charming to see these characters rendered in 3D.  Yes, it's fun to see them in a high-profile movie.  However, they don't act like the characters in the games, because they're not.  They're just actors playing roles.  As for the rest, it's a minor thrill with little or no substance behind it.  I got that thrill from the trailers, but the film had little to offer after that in this area.The other aspect that I thought would be a mainstay of the plot was traversing one video game world after another in Ralph's quest.  Guess how many he travels to.  Go ahead.  Guess.Two.Ralph goes to the bad guy meeting in the Pac-Man game, though it just looks like a blank room during the scene itself.  He then spends two scenes in the video game ""Tapper,"" where he drinks and talks to Tapper about his problems.  Apart from this, none of the worlds that Ralph visits are based off real video games, except for Fix-it Felix Jr itself, which I'm not going to count, because it's just an online game that was made to promote the film.  I'm not counting that.The only other worlds that Ralph visits are Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush, and there are no games for those.  You will never play Hero's Duty.  You will never play Sugar Rush.  They don't exist, and they never will.Roger Rabbit was a multi, mega cartoon crossover masterpiece, and a darn good story in its own right, and that's what Wreck-it Ralph could have been.  A multi, mega, video game crossover masterpiece, and a darn good story in its own right.  However, it sank its own story when it decided to be about Sarah Silverman, rather than an awesome, heroic title character, and it's certainly not the massive video game crossover that the ads suggest.ConclusionIn the final analysis, this movie fails or does poorly on nearly every level.  It's not -that bad- compared to some recent animated films, allegedly for kids, but this says more about the state of modern children's entertainment than it does about Wreck-it Ralph.  I give it a nearly halfway grade for this reason, but I have to be honest here; I consider this film to be a major disappointment.  It seemed to have great promise, and whatever else you can say about it, you can't say it made good on that promise.",2,"Unbeknownst to the audience, we've secretly replaced the main character with

My kids (ages 8 and 6) have not yet been exposed to gun games, and while I'm sure they will eventually, I just don't see why that had to be part of the plot in an animated film made for young children. The other games featured are oriented around racing, sports, or Ralph wrecking a building, and they could have just stuck with that and a few other less violent themed games.Anyway, putting that aside, this would have been a 4 to 5 star film for me. It's a creative idea, and I appreciated the fact it hasn't been done before. There's a lot of funny moments, for adults and kids, and the video theme allows for some fun animation.

They are incredibly represented here and in a very fun way. The film does have a middle section that was slow and a little off track, but with that said, `Wreck It Ralph' does have a fantastic opening and definitely a surprising and eventfully fun ending! The animation is very sharp and extremely real. (Not phot-real, but artistically real.)`Wreck It Ralph' is director Richard Moore's (Futurama, Drawn Together) first feature film coming from a broad television animation background. Taking a script from Phil Johnston (Cedar Rapids, Ghost/Aliens) and first time writer Jennifer Lee, Richard mixed a great deal of personality types and funny creative situations inside of a video game and the world they live in.The games you see in this film are all familiar to those who remember the stand-up, giant boxed TV sets you used to look down at and play your games with. The graphics were simple and the music very distinct with each game environment along with all the sound effects that only came from the 80`s. I had lots of memories of all the games!John C Reilly (Chicago, Magnolia) leads the cast as `Wreck It Ralph' himself who has the odd job of being the villain in his game. Alone, mistreated and often misunderstood he decides to get some recognition by getting an award. With the help of the hysterical Jane Lynch (Glee, 40 Year-Old Virgin) as demanding and pushy militaristic leader of grunts, Calhoun, Ralph gets a little miss directed and off course ending up in many strange games, but none are his own.Now `Wreck It Ralph' has a star in its game called Felix, voiced so sympathetically and humorously dry by Jack McBrayer (30 Rock, Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Jack's innocence and sincerity make the movie so much more fun to watch. I loved observing his take on growing a `fancy' for Jane Lynch's  Calhoun character and how slowly they realize they might just work together, as a couple.Ralph enters a game, wrongly of course, that is based a Candyland-type environment, and accidently bumps into and later, begrudgingly, befriends a small `glitch' in the program who is named Venellope, voiced amazingly perfect by Sarah Silverman (Something About Mary, School Of Rock) . She is independent, stubborn, obnoxious, not responsible and wildly out of hand, but seems to be sweet and sincere enough for Ralph to help.A special note to Alan Tudyk (Firefly, I, Robot), who plays King Candy and does an amazingly unique impression of what might be consider `The Mad Hatter' with his own twist. Alan gives such fun and flair and craziness to his candy obsessed royalty.Without giving too much away, the movie has a fun concept of group therapy for bad guys, an inventive concept on how game characters travel from one game to another and a clever plot concept on how games need to understand, they all need each other. I also loved the great detail and 3-D stylization they used to represent the accuracy of how all these old games really moved and operated.  `Wreck It Ralph' has a great family message in the really funny and creative world of 80's video games.

Ralph's endless campaign for some recognition, and self-worth is a theme that would resonate with anyone.  The loneliness he suffers tugs at the heart strings and makes you yearn for Ralph's happily ever after.  I was quite surprised at the complex story themes found in ""Wreck-It Ralph"", although given Disney's propensity for creating heart-warming and emotionally gratifying stories, I am not sure why I was so surprised.  Perhaps it was because the story takes place in a world populated with classic video game characters. I didn't think that I could feel warm and fuzzy inside while watching a movie in which M. Bison, Zangief, Smoke, Kano, Bowser, and Sonic the Hedgehog can be seen front and center.

The story is about a character in a video arcade game who plays the ""bad guy"" in the game, but after work hours (when the video game is not in use), he just wants to be a regular guy and be friends with the other characters. He joins a ""bad guy"" self-help group for some support (think AA), which is very funny, but then decides he needs to become a hero to gain some respect. All the arcade games are connected electrically through the same power strip, and in this movie, characters can move between games through this connection (although they aren't supposed to). Ralph decides to sneak into a military game temporarily so he can become a ""hero"", but things inevitably go wrong there and he ends up in a candy-land auto race game aimed at young girl arcade players. Most of the adventure takes place within this game, and it is quite funny, with a redeeming ending. As with many of the most recent Disney animations, there are unexpected (but not stupid) character twists and turns, with a plot that holds your interest (I am an adult, after all), and with smart humor and no talking down to the audience (us). It was a pleasant way to spend an hour-and-a-half.I purchased the Blu-ray version of this movie which has three discs: 3-D, regular Blu-ray, and DVD. I have a 50"" 3-D TV and a 3-D Blu-ray player; I don't use the 3-D capability much, but I did try this movie out in 3-D. I saw it in the theater in regular 2-D, so I can't compare the experience, but the 3-D seemed good and not distracting. Did it add anything to the overall movie experience? Not really. If the story is good, it's good in 2-D and 3-D, and this is a good story. Note that the colors are actually more vibrant when watching it in 2-D. The sound on the Blu-ray discs (either one) is in DTS surround sound, and it is great. I personally feel that a decent surround sound experience enhances a movie at home way more than 3-D does (I have to admit, though, I saw Disney's ""Frozen"" in the theater in 3-D and it was awesome, but you definitely need the giant theater screen for that).Oh, I also recently purchased the ""Frozen"" Blu-ray (not in 3-D), and I enjoyed watching it at home as much as in the theater.

When the humans leave the arcade center, it's revealed that they're actually alive; their world just as real as ours and much grander than what we see thru the fixed limitation of the game screen consoles.The movie centers on one particular video villain named Wreck-It Ralph whose simple pixelated existence is to break down an apartment building, while his nemesis and hero namesake of the game is Fix-It Felix Jr., the squeaky clean goodie-two-shoes who goes about repairing Ralph's two-fisted destruction. Up to the point where Felix cheerfully gathers the apartment residents into an angry mob and tossing the big guy off the roof into a dirty pool of mud.As the years pass, Ralph settles into this depressing life with no friends or family. His so-called home a literal dump made up of destroyed bricks from the job, eating food that's thrown out by the apartment residents, and sleeping in the open like some mistreated mongrel dog. His only comfort, and it's a limited one at that, is finding refuge at BadAnon - a support group for fellow villains, who, it turns out are anything but villainous.Desperate for change, any change, he embarks on obtaining the one thing a bad guy is not suppose to receive - a gold medal. It's a hugely symbolic token that Fix-It Felix receives every day and with every play of the game. Frustrated beyond even his sizable tolerance, Ralph will break from tradition and hopefully change everyone's perspective; focusing on who he is and not what his label says.But the one absolute no-no of the video game world, the one unbreakable code, is to never ""Go Turbo"". A reference to an old game character who literally went crazy, left his own malfunctioning game, invaded another and got caught. Human patrons playing the invaded game complained and both consoles were unplugged = electronic death.As Ralph embarks on his incredible journey across a variety of video environments in search of a gold medal, he discovers much more than he ever dreamed - or feared - was possible.Again, an absolutely wonderful, exciting, and fun film for all ages. The perfect blend of wonderful CGI, incredibly rich storytelling, and a touching tip-of-the-hat to the collective history of video games and its earliest fans.Personal Note:- This film seems like the penultimate descendant to those early 1930s cartoons, like ""Have You Got Any Castles?"", where characters from books came to life and interacted with one another.- Absolutely loved the first gen video characters making cameo appearances. Tender and warmly nostalgic moments when guys like Qbert, Clyde, and The Joust Knight have a last chance to once again shine in the public spotlight. Classy.- Jane Lynch = Combat Babe. Yeehaw!

1525823,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B00742SXOM,Marshall Lord,"[2, 3]","This review is based on taking my family to see ""Wreck-it Ralph"" in the cinema in 3D.My 11 year old daughter summed this film up in the words ""Tell them that it was really funny and very clever,"" and for once her twin brother agreed with her, describing the film in one word, ""Epic!"" My wife and I also enjoyed the film which works on a lot of subtle levels.As in the original ""Tron (Original Classic) [1982] [DVD]"" film, most of the characters are video game characters. The story is set in a games arcade, and ""Wreck it Ralph"" is the villain in the longest running game in the arcade, ""Fix it Felix."" Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the opponent who wrecks things: he has to try to knock down buildings faster than the hero of the game, Felix (voiced by Jack McBrayer), can mend them with his magic hammer.At the start of the film, Ralph is telling his story at a meeting of the support group for video game villains, ""Bad Anon."" When the arcade is closed, the game isn't running and all the characters in the game are living their own secret lives in the same way that, for example, characters in the ""Toy Story (Blu-ray 3D)"" films do when their kids are not around. Ralph is fed up with the fact that for thirty years he has not just been the villain in the game itself, but is treated like one by the ""Niceland"" characters when they're not all playing the game.At a party to celebrate thirty years of ""Fix it Felix,"" Ralph, provoked by one insult too many, vows that he will win a medal to prove that he can be a hero. So he visits a new game for older children/young adults, a first-person shooter called ""Hero's Duty"" where the good guys, under the command of the beautiful and very tough Sergeant Calhoun (voiced by Jane Lynch from ""Glee: The Complete First Season""), have to battle the evil Cy-Bugs.Ralph's quest for a medal takes him next to an racing arcade game for very small children called ""Sugar Rush"" where he meets the ruler of the game, ""King Candy"" voiced by Alan Tudyk (Wash from ""Serenity [DVD] [2005]"" and ""Firefly - The Complete Series [DVD] [2003] and Sonny in ""I, Robot [Blu-ray] (2004)."") Here Ralph runs afoul of a charming little girl called Vanellope who wants to take part in the race but is banned from doing so because she is regarded by the other characters as a ""glitch"" or mistake in the game's programming.But there are several things which are amiss in the world of ""Sugar Rush."" Ralph's attempts to gain a medal have unwittingly threatened the existence of his own game and several others, if not the entire arcade.King Candy warns Ralph that his actions could easily result in the customers reporting that ""Sugar Rush"" has a fault, which might possibly lead to the closure of the game. Ralph's absence has forced the arcade's owner to declare the ""Fix It Felix"" game out of order because when Ralph is not there to knock holes in the buildings, Felix has nothing to fix. To avert the permanent closure of the game, Felix comes looking for him, joined by Sergeant Calhoun, who realises that Ralph has unwittingly unleashed the most serious threat of all, one which could easily destroy first the game and world of ""Sugar Rush"" and then go on to threaten every character and game in the arcade.Two of these threats are genuine, the third is a plausible and clever trick. In the process of defeating the real threats, Ralph has to learn what is really required of a true hero ...All the best family films work on more than one level, with one set of jokes and challenges to entertain the kids and another set for the grown ups. This film managed this far better than most. Several of the characters in the game - particularly Sergeant Calhoun but she's not the only one - manage to have a dual focus. Calhoun is  simultaneously steeped in the tragic backstory of the game, which is completely real to her, making her intensely dedicated to stopping the deadly menace of the ""Cy-bugs"" she is fighting, and yet also well aware that her world is a game which must be made entertaining to the customers so they will keep playing it and that world will not be switched off by the arcade management. One of the iconic exchanges in the film is when she asks Wreck-it Ralph,""Do you know what the first rule of Hero's Duty is, soldier?""When Ralph replies ""No cuts, no buts, no coconuts?""she icily informs him that the correct answer is that you do NOT ""interfere with the first person shooter"" (e.g. you don't get the player ""killed."")The way in which characters in games written for players of very different ages interacted was brilliantly done, and the film made you care about the characters to a far greater degree than I would have thought possible. There were also a great many moments which were laugh-out-loud funny.We're so used these days to seeing fantasy worlds brought to life in a way which looks real that we rarely notice it, but the quality of the visual effects in this film was excellent.I can recommend this film as a treat for kids of all ages.",5,Brilliant family film about a video game villain who wants to be the

I may be partially at fault for this rating though. I have read many reviews of this movie and several critics praised this as one of the best ever. So of course I was expecting this amazing movie towering over other Pixar releases. SIGH. The story is uncomplicated to a point that the whole movie could have been done as a half hour cartoon with commercials. None of the characters grab you as truly memorable. The previews give the impression that Ralph goes on some epic journey and he only really visits 2 other games (if you don't count the bar), and a major portion of the movie is in a single game. While other Pixar movies seem to be designed for the young and old alike to enjoy, Wreck-it Ralph is just a kids movie. The bug war part that is directed towards the older crowd is so minimum in movie time, there's almost a &#34;stick this in for the teens&#34; feel to it.

1525858,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00742SXOM,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[9, 14]","I've been planning on seeing ""Wreck-It Ralph"" since the first trailer came out featuring Talking Heads' ""Once in a Lifetime.""  It was a clear message to Gen Xers that this was a movie for us.  The fact that it happened to be released shortly after my birthday made it a perfect opportunity to take my son to his first movie.  When we got there it was clear I wasn't the only one - there were several dads with their children in the theater.""Wreck-It Ralph"" posits the question: does Donkey Kong like his job? When you make a living being a bad guy, does that make you a BAD guy? It's a timeworn plot that worked well for ""The Incredibles"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" - the plight of modern men who are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their lot in life.  In this case it's Ralph (John C. Reilly) who has a love/hate relationship with the people who live in the building he regularly wrecks and the hero who rebuilds it, Felix (Jack McBrayer).  Despondent over his unpopularity and low social status, Ralph decides to strive for a medal in another game with visions of returning home as a hero.That game is Hero's Duty, a cross between Call of Duty and Halo. It's there that Ralph gets mixed up with tough-but-vulnerable Calhoun (Jane Lynch).  Ralph only gradually begins to understand just how much he has unbalanced the natural order of the video game universe when he ends up contaminating a racing game called Sugar Rush.""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a sly nod to the 80s heyday of coin-operated console video games, when characters had lovable quirks like speaking a nonsensical language (Q-bert), limited movement (Felix), or served beer as a form of entertainment (Tapper). At various points during the film, we see the action from a two-dimensional pixilated perspective.  This puts the film in the right frame - it's all just pixels for our entertainment, after all.""Wreck-It Ralph"" is not without its flaws.  There's a tedious romance between Felix and Calhoun, complete with flashbacks, that could have easily been excised.  The majority of the movie actually focuses on the hyper-adorable Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) in Sugar Rush, a setting which is more Candy Kingdom (from Adventure Time) than a video game -- adults looking for a heady whirl through other gamescapes will be disappointed.  Mostly, it's just too long, and all the kids in the audience got fidgety whenever there was too much dialogue.The moral of the story seems to be that the job market is tough, your role is more important than you think, and you're better off being appreciated in your old job than going for glory in your new one.  Or maybe I'm simply reading too much into it.  My son thought the movie was ""okay,"" but then he's never played Pac-Man or Donkey Kong.",4,Does Donkey Kong like his job?,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,2743,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'planning', 'seeing', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'first', 'trailer', 'came', 'out', 'featuring', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'Once', 'Lifetime', 'was', 'clear', 'message', 'Gen', 'Xers', 'was', 'movie', 'fact', 'happened', 'be', 'released', 'shortly', 'birthday', 'made', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'take', 'son', 'first', 'movie', 'When', 'got', 'was', 'clear', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'were', 'several', 'dads', 'children', 'theater', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'question', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'job', 'When', 'make', 'living', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', 'make', 'BAD', 'guy', 'timeworn', 'plot', 'worked', 'well', 'Incredibles', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'plight', 'modern', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'dissatisfied', 'lot', 'life', 'case', 'Ralph', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'who', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'building', 'regularly', 'wrecks', 'hero', 'who', 'Felix', 'Jack', 'McBrayer', 'Despondent', 'unpopularity', 'low', 'social', 'status', 'Ralph', 'strive', 'medal', 'game', 'visions', 'returning', 'home', 'hero.That', 'game', 'Hero', 'Duty', 'cross', 'Call', 'Duty', 'Halo', 'Ralph', 'mixed', 'up', 'tough-but-vulnerable', 'Calhoun', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Ralph', 'only', 'gradually', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'unbalanced', 'natural', 'order', 'video', 'game', 'universe', 'when', 'up', 'contaminating', 'racing', 'game', 'called', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'sly', 'nod', '80s', 'heyday', 'coin-operated', 'console', 'video', 'games', 'when', 'characters', 'had', 'lovable', 'quirks', 'speaking', 'nonsensical', 'language', 'Q-bert', 'limited', 'movement', 'Felix', 'served', 'beer', 'form', 'entertainment', 'Tapper', 'various', 'points', 'film', 'see', 'action', 'two-dimensional', 'pixilated', 'perspective', 'film', 'right', 'frame', 'just', 'pixels', 'entertainment', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'not', 'flaws', 'tedious', 'romance', 'Felix', 'Calhoun', 'complete', 'flashbacks', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'excised', 'majority', 'movie', 'actually', 'hyper-adorable', 'Vanellope', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'setting', 'more', 'Candy', 'Kingdom', 'Adventure', 'Time', 'video', 'game', 'adults', 'looking', 'heady', 'whirl', 'other', 'gamescapes', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Mostly', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'kids', 'audience', 'got', 'fidgety', 'whenever', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue.The', 'moral', 'story', 'be', 'job', 'market', 'tough', 'role', 'more', 'important', 'think', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'being', 'appreciated', 'old', 'job', 'going', 'glory', 'new', 'one', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'simply', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'My', 'son', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'then', 'never', 'played', 'Pac-Man', 'Donkey', 'Kong']",Wreck It Ralph

1525864,A35VJC424AGADX,B00742SXOM,"MikeB ""Metalhead""","[1, 1]","The is the most enjoyable animated movie Disney has made since they switched from traditional to CGI. As a long time gamer and a dad, there is a lot to like about Wreck-It Ralph. There are references and in-jokes galore that will delight gamers, and plenty of colorful and fun characters that will delight children of all ages. The story itself is very well done, too. I genuinely liked and cared about all the characters. The animation is some of the best I've seen from Disney, and I really like that each character and world has it's own look and style. Characters from an 8-bit game move and act differently than characters from a next-gen HD game. Every moment in Wreck-It Ralph is filled with the kind of attention to detail that comes from a genuine love of your work, and it's clear this crew loved making this movie.The thing that surprised me about Wreck-It Ralph is that the story is so engaging, and there were a few twists and surprises that I didn't see coming. The movie has heart, and it doesn't feel shoehorned in. I was also happy to see that the nerdy game references were accurate. As a gamer, it's annoying to see movies that attempt to make references to video games, but fail. Even if you're not a gamer, the movie is still great, and the story is solid enough that anyone can enjoy it, gamer or not. The music is perfect, with a mix of chip-tunes, orchestral, techno, and generally video game appropriate music. The voice acting is also great, with all the actors fitting the roles well. Sometimes celebrity voices sound out of place (like Adam Sandler in Hotel Transylvania), but that's not the case here.The Blu-ray looks fantastic. The images are crisp, the details sharp. The color is vivid without feeling over-saturated. Of all the Blu-rays I've seen, Disney Blu-rays have always looked the best. The sound is in 7.1 HD Master audio, and although I don't have a 7.1 system, I do have a nice external 2.0 stereo system, and it sounds great. Everything is clear, and all the dialogue is audible. One thing I don't like is Blu-rays that have a really wide mix, where music and loud sound effects are 100x louder than the dialogue. Here, the mix is fantastic, and the quiet parts are never too quiet, and the loud parts are never deafeningly loud. I'd give the audio/video of this Blu-ray an A+.One thing I would have liked to see is more special features. There is a short ""making of"" feature where they talk about the challenges of creating distinct world for each of the games in the move, and a little bit about designing the characters, but there is no mention of the voice cast, and no coverage of the fantastic music. If you pause the movie, an ""intermission"" features starts that tells you about little hidden ""easter eggs"" in the movie, hosted by gaming nerd Chris Hardwick. This is probably my favorite, as I am a fan of Hardwick's. There's also the short film ""Paperman"", which is beautiful, and won an Oscar. Beyond that, there's just the usual trailers and crap. I would have liked to see more in-depth features covering more aspects of making the movie, but maybe I'm just being greedy. Overall, what is here, the movie and the special features, is solid and is well worth your money.In short, go buy this movie. It is fantastic, and I can't think of a single reason you won't like it.",5,Great for the whole family,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,3325,"['most', 'enjoyable', 'animated', 'movie', 'Disney', 'made', 'switched', 'traditional', 'CGI', 'long', 'time', 'gamer', 'dad', 'lot', 'like', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'are', 'references', 'in-jokes', 'galore', 'will', 'delight', 'gamers', 'plenty', 'colorful', 'fun', 'characters', 'will', 'delight', 'children', 'ages', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'genuinely', 'liked', 'cared', 'characters', 'animation', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Disney', 'really', 'character', 'world', 'own', 'look', 'style', 'Characters', '8-bit', 'game', 'move', 'act', 'differently', 'characters', 'next-gen', 'HD', 'game', 'moment', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'filled', 'kind', 'attention', 'detail', 'genuine', 'love', 'work', 'clear', 'crew', 'loved', 'making', 'movie.The', 'thing', 'surprised', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'story', 'so', 'engaging', 'were', 'few', 'twists', 'surprises', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'movie', 'heart', ""n't"", 'feel', 'shoehorned', 'was', 'also', 'happy', 'see', 'nerdy', 'game', 'references', 'were', 'accurate', 'gamer', 'annoying', 'see', 'movies', 'attempt', 'make', 'references', 'video', 'games', 'fail', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'gamer', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'story', 'solid', 'enough', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'not', 'music', 'perfect', 'mix', 'chip-tunes', 'orchestral', 'techno', 'generally', 'video', 'game', 'appropriate', 'music', 'voice', 'acting', 'also', 'great', 'actors', 'fitting', 'roles', 'well', 'Sometimes', 'celebrity', 'voices', 'sound', 'place', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'not', 'case', 'Blu-ray', 'fantastic', 'images', 'are', 'crisp', 'details', 'sharp', 'color', 'vivid', 'feeling', 'over-saturated', 'Blu-rays', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Disney', 'Blu-rays', 'have', 'always', 'looked', 'best', 'sound', '7.1', 'HD', 'Master', 'audio', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '7.1', 'system', 'do', 'have', 'nice', 'external', '2.0', 'stereo', 'system', 'great', 'Everything', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'audible', 'One', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Blu-rays', 'have', 'really', 'wide', 'mix', 'where', 'music', 'loud', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', '100x', 'louder', 'dialogue', 'Here', 'mix', 'fantastic', 'quiet', 'parts', 'are', 'never', 'too', 'quiet', 'loud', 'parts', 'are', 'never', 'deafeningly', 'loud', ""'d"", 'give', 'audio/video', 'Blu-ray', 'A+.One', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'short', 'making', 'feature', 'where', 'talk', 'challenges', 'creating', 'distinct', 'world', 'games', 'move', 'little', 'bit', 'designing', 'characters', 'mention', 'voice', 'cast', 'coverage', 'fantastic', 'music', 'pause', 'movie', 'intermission', 'features', 'tells', 'little', 'hidden', 'easter', 'eggs', 'movie', 'hosted', 'gaming', 'nerd', 'Chris', 'Hardwick', 'probably', 'favorite', 'am', 'fan', 'Hardwick', 'also', 'short', 'film', 'Paperman', 'beautiful', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Beyond', 'just', 'usual', 'trailers', 'crap', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'in-depth', 'features', 'covering', 'more', 'aspects', 'making', 'movie', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'being', 'greedy', 'Overall', 'what', 'here', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'solid', 'well', 'worth', 'money.In', 'short', 'go', 'buy', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like']",Wreck It Ralph

Even an old fuddy-duddy like me can still appreciate well told stories with animated characters as long as there are some jokes for the oldsters and a good musical score.Our hero is actually a ""bad guy"" named Ralph (John C. Reilly) who resides within the arcade game called Fix-It Felix Jr.  His job is to wreck an apartment while Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) repairs the destruction with his magic hammer.  Ralph is tired of being ostracized by Felix and the apartment's residents.  He is told that in order to fit in he needs to win a gold medal.Ralph decides he wants to be a ""good guy"" and goes to another game in search of the medal which he accidentally does win.  He is chastised however by the hero of that game, a warrior named Calhoun (Jane Lynch) because he allowed a small mechanical spider-like creature go with him to yet another game.  In this Candy Land game he meets a young girl named Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) who is also shunned by others in the game because she is known as a glitch, which eventually could shut down the game for good.The story must resolve itself as Felix, Calhoun, Vanellope and Ralph work to correct a wrong perpetrated by King Candy (Alan Tudyk).  Oh and destroy the spider-thingies who have grown and multiplied.  The film looks great on Blu ray 1080p and has a thunderous DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 sound option.  As far as the jokes and music?  Nothing special, although I admit that some of the jokes involving the arcade games sailed over my head.  The conclusion of the movie was very good but it took a while to get rolling.

After attending a bad guy support group meeting and being shunned from the 30th anniversary party for his game, Ralph is determined to win a medal and some respect for his part in the game. The movie features many cameos from classic video games, a warm and touching story filled with action and eye popping graphics, this is a perfect movie for the family or date night (guys, if your girlfriend is not into games, let her watch this movie with you and she will have a better appreciation for  your hobby).The ultimate collector's edition comes with a Blu-ray, DVD, 3D version and digital copy, included is the short &#34;Paperman&#34; which was shown to open the movie, it is also a short and sappy story about a plain guy who meets a young woman (who looks like Anne Hathaway) and some hijinks involving paper airplanes leads them to a chance encounter, very nice. Deleted scenes and bonus documentaries round out the extras and worth a look.The visuals and sound are outstanding in Blu-ray, I watched this on a 1080p LED tv and the colors and details are amazing, you feel like you are in the game/movie, the retro feel of the Fix-It Felix game to the intensity of the Hero's Duty game really capture what arcade gaming is about, the Sugar Rush game is the best with all the colors and details of the background and the supporting characters, the writers and animators were very clever with all the details and you can tell this movie is a labor of love for all to enjoy.Finally, the heart of the movie is not only in its graphics and video game cameos but the story, I think most people have felt like Ralph (John C. Reilly), misunderstood, unappreciated and unwanted in their lives, it is nice that he tries to improve his lot in life by reaching his goals and you can really feel for him when he sees Vanellope (played beautifully by Sarah Silverman) going through something similar in her game, they form a bond and it is hard not to smile as the story unfolds and you can laugh, cry and feel good about yourself and for the characters at the end of the movie.

1525899,A286CZAI1M80R3,B00742SXOM,Neoncloudff,"[152, 173]","The Short: Wreck-It Ralph is a classic. From the slick animation, the great sense of humor, nostalgia inducing references and cameos, and the surprisingly adept and emotional story, Disney's Wreck-it Ralph is the best animated comedy since Tangled, and one of Disney's best animated films ever crafted.Street Fighter, Pac-Man, Q-bert; widely known and considered classic games. But a ""new challenger has entered the ring"" in the form of old school, Donkey Kong inspired retro arcade game, Wreck-it Ralph. Follow the misadventures of Wreck-it Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, as he attempts to become a hero by jumping though various video games. I don't want to spoil any of the plot, but it is incredibly well told and is quite surprising in the end. It has that classic Disney emotion, but with a most unique ""video game-y"" twist. In the end, Wreck-it Ralph teaches some great lessons, but it is also neither mundane nor juvenile, and that's why it's a winner.The cast here couldn't fit the characters better. John C. Reilly as the big guy Wreck-it Ralph, Sarah Silverman as the spirited and surprisingly funny Vanellope von Schweetz, Jane Lynch as the stoic and hilarious Sergeant Calhoun, and Jack McBrayer as the lovable and yet again laugh- out-loud Fix-it Felix Junior. The movie is absolutely hilarious; the performances from all of the actors fit their roles perfectly and couldn't be funnier. They couldn't have picked a better voice cast, honestly to goodness.The animation continues the high pedigree that Disney has become famous for. Its bright and lively action is wonderful to watch, and combined with great facial animations make for a great and emotional experience. But the winner here is the way that they have adapted the old- school style of video game animation into the film itself. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. It makes for a truly unique, one of a kind experience! Sony's 4K presentation is crisp and vibrant.The thing to understand though is that with its focus on video game cameos and references, don't worry! You don't have to have any knowledge of video games to understand or enjoy Wreck-it Ralph. The story and main characters are all part of the film's story and world. Rather than using the references as a crutch, they're used more as a springboard into new and unexplored fictional worlds.Granted, gamers of all ages are going to love the care and attention taken when putting in the huge amount of references, cameos, and little bits of easter eggs spritzed and scattered throughout Wreck-it Ralph, making for a truly nostalgic inducing experience.And those classic Disney trademarks, from great characters to a well told story, are all here and are much more than side attractions. The twist is great, the concepts are fresh, and the level of imagination at work revives my faith in the animated genre. There's still plenty left in this old dog after all.And so I have to end this review by asking, ""Are you tired of the same old washed up animated feature film? Feel like you're just too old for childish animated movies?"" Wreck-it Ralph is the perfect cure. And it's meant for that group of movie goers looking for something more than just another animated money pit. It's laugh out loud funny, exciting and fresh, incredibly inventive and gleefully unique at every turn.It's a classic no doubt, and Wreck-it Ralph will be one of those movies on my ""favorites"" shelf for decades to come. The true triumph? Wreck-it Ralph feels like that classic game that has been a part of my childhood ever since I can remember; the type of classic where you throw hundreds of quarters away and you honestly just don't care, because it is just that good.5/5 - Perfection; Stop reading and watch right now",5,Absolutely Fantastic!,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,3749,"['Short', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'classic', 'slick', 'animation', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'nostalgia', 'inducing', 'references', 'cameos', 'surprisingly', 'adept', 'emotional', 'story', 'Disney', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'best', 'animated', 'comedy', 'Tangled', 'one', 'Disney', 'best', 'animated', 'films', 'ever', 'crafted.Street', 'Fighter', 'Pac-Man', 'Q-bert', 'widely', 'known', 'considered', 'classic', 'games', 'new', 'challenger', 'entered', 'ring', 'form', 'old', 'school', 'Donkey', 'Kong', 'inspired', 'retro', 'arcade', 'game', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'Follow', 'misadventures', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'voiced', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'become', 'hero', 'jumping', 'various', 'video', 'games', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'plot', 'incredibly', 'well', 'told', 'quite', 'surprising', 'end', 'classic', 'Disney', 'emotion', 'most', 'unique', 'video', 'game-y', 'twist', 'end', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'great', 'lessons', 'also', 'neither', 'mundane', 'juvenile', 'why', 'winner.The', 'cast', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'fit', 'characters', 'better', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'big', 'guy', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'spirited', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'Vanellope', 'von', 'Schweetz', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'stoic', 'hilarious', 'Sergeant', 'Calhoun', 'Jack', 'McBrayer', 'lovable', 'yet', 'again', 'laugh-', 'out-loud', 'Fix-it', 'Felix', 'Junior', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'performances', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles', 'perfectly', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'funnier', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'picked', 'better', 'voice', 'cast', 'honestly', 'goodness.The', 'animation', 'high', 'pedigree', 'Disney', 'become', 'famous', 'bright', 'lively', 'action', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'combined', 'great', 'facial', 'animations', 'make', 'great', 'emotional', 'experience', 'winner', 'here', 'way', 'have', 'adapted', 'old-', 'school', 'style', 'video', 'game', 'animation', 'film', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'truly', 'unique', 'one', 'kind', 'experience', 'Sony', '4K', 'presentation', 'crisp', 'vibrant.The', 'thing', 'understand', 'though', 'focus', 'video', 'game', 'cameos', 'references', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'knowledge', 'video', 'games', 'understand', 'enjoy', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'part', 'film', 'story', 'world', 'Rather', 'using', 'references', 'crutch', ""'re"", 'used', 'more', 'springboard', 'new', 'unexplored', 'fictional', 'worlds.Granted', 'gamers', 'ages', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'care', 'attention', 'taken', 'when', 'putting', 'huge', 'amount', 'references', 'cameos', 'little', 'bits', 'easter', 'eggs', 'spritzed', 'scattered', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'making', 'truly', 'nostalgic', 'inducing', 'experience.And', 'classic', 'Disney', 'trademarks', 'great', 'characters', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'side', 'attractions', 'twist', 'great', 'concepts', 'are', 'fresh', 'level', 'imagination', 'work', 'revives', 'faith', 'animated', 'genre', 'still', 'plenty', 'left', 'old', 'dog', 'all.And', 'so', 'have', 'end', 'review', 'asking', 'Are', 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'washed', 'up', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'Feel', ""'re"", 'just', 'too', 'old', 'childish', 'animated', 'movies', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'perfect', 'cure', 'meant', 'group', 'movie', 'goers', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'animated', 'money', 'pit', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'exciting', 'fresh', 'incredibly', 'inventive', 'gleefully', 'unique', 'turn.It', 'classic', 'doubt', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'movies', 'favorites', 'shelf', 'decades', 'come', 'true', 'triumph', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'feels', 'classic', 'game', 'been', 'part', 'childhood', 'ever', 'can', 'remember', 'type', 'classic', 'where', 'throw', 'hundreds', 'quarters', 'away', 'honestly', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'just', 'good.5/5', 'Perfection', 'Stop', 'reading', 'watch', 'right', 'now']",Wreck It Ralph
1525900,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B00742SXOM,Newton Ooi,"[0, 0]","Year after year, the expectation is that Pixar will release the best animated film, with second fiddle going to either Disney or Dreamworks.  The two possible exceptions to this trend have been Dreamworks' ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and Disney's ""Tangled"".  Now we have another alternative, ""Wreck-It Ralph"", Disney's big fall release of 2012.  Following in the transformation of Disney films from fairy tale musical to more focused on action and comedy, this movie contains elements from many of the other successful animated films of the past 20 - 30 years.  First, its numerous references to video games both overt and sly hearken back to the first Shrek, and to a smaller extend, the Toy Story films, in how they feature associations to culturally known icons.  The film's ensemble cast, and their relationships on stage also bear striking semblance to prior animated hits, most noticeably Monster's Inc.  Sully corresponds to Wreck-It Ralph.  Mike Wazowski becomes Fix-It Felix, and Boo is now Venellope.  The key difference is that the relationship between Sully and Wazowski in Monster's Inc is flipped 180 degrees in Wreck-It Ralph.  For me, the best part of the movie was the soundtrack; mixing elements of hip-hop, techno, disco and the traditional video game background music, it was a key part of the film's emotional punch.  As for this blu-ray / DVD package, it contains the film, the short clip that came before the movie in the theaters, and some additional features.  Like Disney's other films, the extra/deleted scenes are just sketches with voice-overs.

1525901,A2198O25QYUPXE,B00742SXOM,Nicholas R.W. Henning,"[1, 1]","""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a computer-animated family-action film. The story takes the imaginative direction of life for video game characters during their downtime with Wreck-It Ralph the lead protagonist.Ralph (John C. Reilly) doesn't like his bad guy role and wants to find more meaning by exploring beyond his game, and uses the shared electrical power board as a junction to other games.It is his voyage of discovery which introduces him to Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) and both face different predicaments in their respective games. Their coming together is the primary feature of the narrative and as a team they help not only themselves but game characters that have become redundant.For any viewer who played a video game in the 1980s/90s there are many familiar characters who have come on hard times and like Ralph they feel a bit disenfranchised, but he and Vanellope help them rediscover themselves, which creates some interesting game scenarios and relationships as the background stories of characters across many games provides much humour, as does their interaction because they have notably different game roles.John C. Reilly has the perfect deep, gravelly voice for smash hands Ralph and Sarah Silverman gives Vanellope a playful and energetic tone, which provides an enjoyable contrast between the two characters.It is a fun movie which is original and takes video games to a new level.Nicholas R.W.

While this cliche'd line seems to reflect the simple plot in most movies (while the moral outcome does, too), the setting makes Wreck-it Ralph a wonderful, refreshing, and unique pleasure. Inside a family arcade, all the game characters (both old and new) are real, and travel among the other games when the doors have locked. Ralph, from Fix-it Felix Jr., desperately wished to be a good guy, and be rewarded, so he sets off in search of a medal. By doing this, he sets off a chain of events that puts multiple games at risk, and unveils a hidden threat.Disney has made this film equally accessible by both parents and children, and I find that wondrous. At times, Vanellope sounded quite mature, and at others, just like a tod. Soon, kids will squeal in excitement when they find a Fix-it Felix Jr. game, along with other last-gen arcade delights. In this way, the film has rendered itself timeless, if only in that small way. Although it doesn't feature many of the games themselves, you are able to see many characters, including retired ones.Being inside a game world gave the artists a great deal of freedom, but they didn't waste it. At every new turn, another extremely creative point would grab your attention, and I'm sure I missed many (which would enhance a second viewing). Another big enhancement is the 3D atmosphere. I doubted I would ever say this, but I urge you to see this in 3D, or turn around and go home. Because of all the pixel-related artwork, and 3D modeling, it is natural to have such a dimension added on. It's the perfect film to have it for!Now, for all the extra material surrounding the movie. Similar to Pixar, Disney has included an animated short right before, called ""The Paperman"". It doesn't feature any voice acting, but it's hilarious, and very well-made. I am sure you'll enjoy it. Second, the end credits are worth watching through, but not because there's an extra scene (there isn't one). It's only worth it for the visuals during the credits themselves, in 3D.In conclusion, Wreck-it Ralph is family-safe, and highly enjoyable.

I know probably I am so purintan and I got the wrong idea about the film...however, the film brings back some nostalgic memories about old video games and that is a good point in favor. Oh, I forgot to tell you that some people got sleep during the presentation, and kids obviously started to play and ran.  So, Disney has to be supervised by the old men and women that use to write, paint, and create fimls like cinderella, sleeping beauty and so on in order to have a future success. I read other comments about this film and I do not understand why I do not like the way in which Ralph has a relationship with the Little girl, there is a scene in which she invited him to her cave (or something like that) or place, and well, she is Little girl and he is an adult, probably I have to think that he is her father or uncle because our society make us to pollute our maind and sometimes things make us to have the wrong idea.

Why use DRM on stuff when it's only punishing the consumers who actually buy the products.  Disney's FastPlay feature is a misnomered and deceptive option to fool you into watching the marketing stuff before getting to the main menu.Granted it seems to be only happening on my computer, which I now use to watch all my movies, but my computer is only two years old and was installed with quality components.  Also, this doesn't happen to the majority of my other DVD's that I own or have rented, so why should it only happen for certain products from certain companies?I'm debating going through the hassle of returning this product since I used the Super Savings option for free shipping, which would obviously be charged for a return.

Not some empirical fact.I had high expectations about this film. It was well received by critics and all the hoopla in the media. However, I left the theater rather disappointed.I said it before and will say again: in a figurative sense, there's nothing original or innovative about this film. Yes, in a literal sense it's a new setting, theme and characters, but in the truer sense it's just nothing there that jumps as something fresh. Same old anthropomorphism, same old predictable plot and narrative.As for the characters, I will quote myself, if I may, from the comments below:""Woody and the cast of Toy Story are not only the pioneers but they are the industry standard. They are amazingly easy to empathize with, and there's also a human aspect to the movie in the form of a growing Andy. In Toy Story 3, this [dynamic] reached a climax that had me (a guy in his 30s) openly and abundantly crying in the theater. Lightning McQueen & Co. are also very relatable and there's something to be said about the beautiful imagery and fantastic voice acting of Luke Wilson. However, Cars 2 fell off a cliff. The plot was all over the place, the characters became detached and artificial and plastered with a tried-and-true happy ending. Wreck-It Ralph simply did not speak to me. I didn't find the characters particularly relatable, humor was [completely] absent and I just did not find any particular hook to any of the characters.""Also, I'd like to emphasize that this film is not unwatchable and if you have kids who are into video games I'm sure they'll get a kick out of it, but as an adult with hefty expectations, this film simply didn't deliver.",2,"That ""Been there, done that"" feeling",1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,1729,"['EDIT', 'Rewrite', 'emphasize', 'opinion', 'take', 'animate', 'film', 'Not', 'empirical', 'fact.I', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'received', 'critics', 'hoopla', 'media', 'However', 'left', 'theater', 'rather', 'disappointed.I', 'said', 'will', 'say', 'again', 'figurative', 'sense', 'nothing', 'original', 'innovative', 'film', 'Yes', 'literal', 'sense', 'new', 'setting', 'theme', 'characters', 'truer', 'sense', 'just', 'nothing', 'there', 'that', 'something', 'fresh', 'Same', 'old', 'anthropomorphism', 'same', 'old', 'predictable', 'plot', 'narrative.As', 'characters', 'will', 'quote', 'may', 'comments', 'Woody', 'cast', 'Toy', 'Story', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'pioneers', 'are', 'industry', 'standard', 'are', 'amazingly', 'easy', 'empathize', 'also', 'human', 'aspect', 'movie', 'form', 'growing', 'Andy', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', '[', 'dynamic', ']', 'reached', 'climax', 'had', 'guy', '30s', 'openly', 'abundantly', 'crying', 'theater', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'Co.', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'relatable', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'fantastic', 'voice', 'acting', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'However', 'Cars', '2', 'fell', 'off', 'cliff', 'plot', 'was', 'place', 'characters', 'became', 'detached', 'artificial', 'plastered', 'tried-and-true', 'happy', 'ending', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'speak', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'characters', 'particularly', 'relatable', 'humor', 'was', '[', 'completely', ']', 'absent', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'particular', 'hook', 'characters', 'Also', ""'d"", 'like', 'emphasize', 'film', 'not', 'unwatchable', 'have', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'video', 'games', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'adult', 'hefty', 'expectations', 'film', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'deliver']",Wreck It Ralph

A wonderful story, engaging and believable characters, and wonderful visuals.  There is something for everyone in this film, especially people like me who grew up playing video games since the 80's.Wreck it Ralph centers around Ralph, resident bad guy for the arcade game Fix it Felix.  Day in and day out Ralph carries on his duties of wrecking one lone building, only to be defeated by Felix and the residents all the time.  Getting tired of always being labeled and treated like a &#34;bad guy,&#34; Ralph starts game jumping in hopes of becoming a hero and earning the respect and love Felix receives.Later on, he meets Vanellope van Schweetz in the game Sugar Rush.  Vanellope is a character with her own things to prove.  As a glitch in her respective game, her goal is to show characters in her game that she can race just as good as they can; despite her problem.Throughout the movie, the question lies on what makes a person; especially what makes a person a &#34;good&#34; guy, or a &#34;bad&#34; guy.  It also show what defines a hero, and that medals and labels are not what makes a true hero to somebody.What was also great about this film is Disney really took the time and research to appeal to gamers such as myself.  Anyone who has played console and arcade games since the 1980's will go giddy with excitement with all the references Disney managed to stuff into the film.  From Bowser, Zangief, and M. Bison at the Bad Anon meeting to the &#34;Aerith Lives&#34; FVII reference in graffiti on one of the walls at the game station; there is something for everyone.Wreck it Ralph is a wonderful movie for kids and adults and it's on my top ten Disney movie list.

Reilly) is a misunderstood arcade game villain who longs to be beloved like his kind-hearted nemesis Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer), but nobody seems to like a Bad Guy. In order to order to prove himself a real hero, he ventures into the new first-person shooter game Hero's Duty to win a shiny medal, but accidentally unleashes a terrible evil that threatens the entire arcade. Wreck-It Ralph is one of the most entertaining animated films in recent years. It features a creative storyline filled with plenty of heart, emotion and humor, colorful CG animation and memorable characters. The animated movie is also homage to the videogame industry, featuring numerous video game references and iconic characters. Wreck-It Ralph also includes the voice talents of Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch, Alan Tudyk, Mindy Kaling, Joe Lo Truglio, Dennis Haysbert and Ed O'Neill.Disney's Blu-Ray release of Wreck-It Ralph is well recommended addition to your Blu-Ray collection. The animated feature is presented in 2.39:1 widescreen format. The HD transfer is truly excellent with fine crystal clarity and rich dazzling colors. The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is certainly first-rate. The key extra in this Blu-Ray release is the Academy-Award-winning animated short Paperman. Other supplemental features include the 17-minute featurette Bit by Bit: Creating the Worlds of Wreck-It Ralph, 14 minutes of deleted and alternate scenes, Disney Intermission hosted by Chris Hardwick and sneak peeks of other Disney titles.

1525979,APBDZ88BBTN4F,B00742SXOM,R. McAdams,"[1, 1]","This will be my 300th review on Amazon, and I saved it for something truly special, and that something special is Wreck-It Ralph. It is my new favorite movie, taking the crown from my last favorite movie, which reigned from 1995 until 2013. I was so awestruck by this movie that after we rented it, we bought the HD digital version from Amazon Instant Video before it was available on disc, and watched it over and over again, and I have now bought the movie on blu-ray as well (Disney is getting their money out of me) so I can watch it without having to wait for things to buffer :)This movie resonated with me in ways that I haven't experienced in a long, long time. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING ""clicked"" perfectly for me with this movie. I realize that just because I love a movie, doesn't mean everyone else will, but I will try to explain below my reasons why I love it, in the hopes that people who may not have wanted to give this movie a chance, will do so.First, the sound is just perfect. If you played video games in the 1980s, you will immediately recognize the sounds they use in the movie, and that will raise the nostalgia level for you. They also integrate those same types of sounds into the music, making the whole movie ""feel"" like a video game.Second, the themes in the movie of the misunderstood ""bad guy"" and the underdog situations are very compelling to me. [Minor spoiler] And being the father of an adopted daughter, I empathized strongly with Ralph adopting Vanellope and looking after her, and putting her goals and needs above his. I think anyone who has cared for a child will resonate with that theme.[/END: Minor spoiler]Third, the voice acting is superb. I love, LOVE Sarah Silverman, and having her voice Vanellope was just beyond genius. She has one of those voices that I would recognize anywhere, like James Earl Jones -- it is instantly recognizable. Even the supporting cast got great voice actors that fit their characters well. I especially loved Alan Tudyk's take on King Candy as a modified Mad Hatter-type character (he has stated himself that he based his character's performance on the Ed Wynn's Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland).Fourth, I loved Calhoun (the tough female soldier). I love that she is a nail-biting no-nonsense soldier who also feels vulnerable on the inside when someone calls her a ""dynamite gal."" Her side story with Felix is very believable and very touching at times.Fifth, I loved the idea of ""Bad Anon"" as a support group for ""bad guys"" in games, and seeing old favorites from Mortal Kombat, Mario, and even Pac-Man sitting around and sharing about how they ""may be bad guys, but, that doesn't make them ... bad ... guys..."" :)Sixth, I really can't get enough of the ""Toy Story"" idea of what's-going-on-when-we're-not-looking? They said so themselves in the special features of the blu-ray that they were exploring that trope with this movie, and I am more than OK with that. I find it fascinating to think of video game characters living out separate lives from their games once the humans go away ... and they've barely scratched the surface of gaming! There are MMORPGs, console games, handheld games, phone games, Flash games, and more to still explore. I can see all kinds of possibilities for a sequel.Finally, I loved the ending.[Moderate Spoiler Warning]....There are certain kinds of human actions that I think most people will say captivate their attention, send shivers running up and down their spine, and invoke a certain kind of awe -- and I would say that self sacrifice for the greater good (a'la Spock) or for a loved one, tend to rank the highest in our admiration.  The moment where Ralph makes the tough decision and realizes what the greater importance is, and what kind of honor and medals truly count, and then acts on it, is a fantastic one. The music of the moment is perfect, and the build-up to the moment is perfect, and the resolution to the action is perfect. (See, I didn't spoil it too badly ^_-)[/END: Moderate Spoiler Warning]In my opinion, Disney hit it out of the ballpark with this one. I was mildly surprised to see that Disney was behind the movie when it came out, and impressed. They have certainly come a long way from Home on the Range (widely considered to be not just one of the worst Disney movies of all time, but one of the worst animated movies of all time).I own this movie, and I love it. It is a rare gem. It is heartwarming, family-friendly comedy/action/adventure with a video game twist. There is no swearing (although there is a bit of juvenile bathroom humor I could have done without), there is no serious violence (the only things that get truly hurt or killed in the movie are monster bugs, and Disney-villains, and they just vaporize when they die), and there are no serious dark elements to the movie. It is a movie you can put on when you want to feel better about the world, and it is my new favorite movie.5 stars.",5,My new favorite movie.

Reilly as Wreck-It Ralph,Sarah Silverman as Vanellope von Schweetz,Jack McBrayer as Fix-It Felix, Jr.,Jane Lynch as Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun and Alan Tudyk as King Candy.This is a nicely done effort by the Disney Studios which I found generally to be an enchanting and entertaining opus.Kids from the 80s,now grown ups with kids themselves,will especially relate to the old style video arcade games that are revisited on screen.The story introduces us to a video arcade and one game in particular,Fix it Felix.The nemesis of the game is Wreck it Ralph.He sits high atop an apartment building and tries to wreck it.The hero Felix's schtick is to undo all the damage Ralph does.Something very similar to Donkey Kong.We soon go inside the game to see what happens after the arcade shuts down.Ralph's ""home"" is the nearby garbage dump,while Felix lives in the apartment building surrounded by many friends.The schism that exists causes Ralph to attend a ""bad-anon"" meeting to talk out his frustrations with other""baddies"".The motto of the group is to take things""one game at a time"".When Ralph returns home that night a party is in progress at the apartment building.It seems Felix and his friends are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the game.Ralph weasels himself an invite,but after an argument ensues with some tenants he storms out.After every game Felix gets a medal for winning.Ralph thinks that if he got one his street cred would rise considerably.Ralph leaves the game and goes to game central.Along the way he bumps into a soldier from Hero's Duty who has PTSD big time.After learning that one gets a medal for winning in the game,he""borrows"" the soldiers suit and joins the game.Ralph soon finds out it is harder than it looks,and after bumbling through his first play the group all leave to the start line again.Ralph learns the medal he seeks is in a tall tower.Ralph climbs the tower and gets himself the medal.However on his way out he steps on an egg which spawns a bug,which immediately clings to his face.This causes Ralph to fall into a spacecraft which flies away and eventually crash lands in a game called Sugar Rush.The female leader of the Hero's Rush game and Felix,who has shown up looking for Ralph,also follow him.In Sugar Rush Ralph's medal has ended up on the branch of a candy cane tree.On his climb up he meets a ""glitch"".When she/the glitch realizes what he's after she steals it away from him and runs off.She uses Ralph's medal to enter herself in the upcoming kart race.But the King is dead set against her racing and he tries everything to stop her.Meanwhile Ralph catches up to glitch and they come to terms with each other.In return for Ralph helping her enter and win the race,she will give Ralph his medal back.The two create a candy go kart and practice her driving.Just before the two are about the leave for the race,glitch goes back to get something for Ralph.At this moment the King shows up and gives Ralph his medal back.He also asks Ralph to stop glitch from racing.His reasoning is if she won,the entire game itself would likely be shut down when human players saw her glitching out constantly.When glitch returns he wrecks the kart and returns home,leaving poor glitch in tears.Back home practically everyone has gone,as Ralph's disappearance has left the game unplayable.As Ralph stares at the out of order sign,he throws his medal at the playing screen which has the effect of partially dropping the sign on the outside.At that moment Ralph sees a picture of glitch on the side of her game across the arcade.Funny that a glitch should be shown prominently on a game she shouldn't be in.Ralph returns to Sugar Rush to learn that the King deliberately made her a glitch,tearing her memory from the system code,long ago.Ralph finds glitch locked up in a ""fungeon"" and releases her,after some apologies.The race begins and even though she starts late,glitch hits the road running.The race never quite finishes as the bug that accompanied Ralph into Sugar Rush has now grown and spawned an army of them.Felix and the commander of Hero's Duty finally catch up with Ralph and assist him in fending off the bug attack.It is during this time we learn the King is also the hero from an old game called Turbo Time,who took over and killed off a similar game way back when,and has now ruled this one for years.The two battle,the King goes down along with the army of bugs, and Ralph gets to finally push glitch over the finish line.This reboots the game and glitches former role of the princess of the game is reinstated.Ralph returns home a happier more loved bad guy and glitch and he remain best friends forever.Many who watch this and are familiar with the old arcade games,will meet a myriad of old friends here like Sonic the Hedge Hog,Cubert,Bowser(from Mario),Pacman and more.It is obvious what demographic the producers of this film were after.It also works wonderfully with children as most of the characters here are thoroughly benign in behaviour and looks.That is why I say in the title that it is like Reboot,but without that animation's edge to it.The only fault I find with animation such as this is in the writing.The stories tend to get a little too complicated,and as the film winds down there are alot of loose ends to tie up,and some extras added on.Such as the side plot of the King and his past.If they had left it with just the King trying to marginalize glitch,that would have been sufficient.But instead they made the King into the guy from Turbo Time.All this while Felix and company are fighting bugs and Ralph is fighting for his life.I did think it was a neat touch that the King's affectation was along the lines of old comedian Ed Wynn.In fact kudos to all who voiced the film.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1.The only extra is the 10 minute animated short The Paperman,seen in theatres along with this film.All in all an enjoyable animated romp back to the heady days of arcade games of the 80s.Fix it Felix bears more than a striking resemblance to the Donkey Kong of old.Kids from the 80s,now grown up,will relate to the subject matter easily,and their children will love the film for its adventuresome theme and larger than life characters.Recommended.",4,A warm and fuzzy ReBoot!,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,6337,"['Wreck', 'Ralph',

1525982,A2J5HVQOHU4FG7,B00742SXOM,"Robert Mason ""Dr Robert""","[1, 1]","Its amazing the difference one person can make, In this case, John Lassiter's move across from Pixar to Disney has spelled the end of Pixar's extraordinary creative run and a mini revival at Disney. There have now been three Disney movies under his guidance, Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph and Frozen, and they are all pretty impressive to watch but this is the best. The problem with the other two are that they are deeply sexist - man-hating. Tangled is simply appalling in the scenes of violence enacted against the mail lead, Repunzel's repeated bashing him over the head with a frying pan, knocking him unconscious every time, would kill an ordinary person, and sends a clear message to young girls: its never ok for people to hit females, but you girls can feel free to enact physical violence on men. Frozen is worse again: the man-hating is so deeply, and unnecessarily, in its core that they seem to be losing some editorial balance.And here in the middle of these two films, which could have been completely wonderful but aren't, is the more modest but beautifully balanced Wreck-It Ralph, with very strong and lovely male and female leads, and a gentle and generous moral journey. It's not one of the very great Disney movies but a fine addition to the collection.It will certainly survive a a classic, and it won't date like the other two. It is enjoyable for children of both sexes, and Ralph's core concerns as an outsider make the film appealing to adults, without the gratuitous sarcasm of Shreck and its genre.There are problems with it: some say it should not have settled in the world of Sugar Rush, but Sugar Rush is a very interesting place to be. If I had a complaint about the film it would be that the actual game of Fix-It Felix isn't worked through sufficiently, so it isn't immediately obvious why anybody would want to play it. Others complain about the several references to The Wizard of Oz; I found them delightful. The world of Sugar Rush is obviously tilted towards an East Asian sensibility - the Hello Kitty kind of cutesy-pie worlds, but it is fun all the same.The best thing in the movie is the world of the aliens and traumatized military heroes,, and the uber-masculine female corporal who holds everything together. She's simply hilarious, and her budding respect for and then love for the hapless Fix-It Felix is one of the film's many joys. The script-writers worked hard to keep the movie entertaining throughout and perhaps the best moment is right near the end, when Felix is in jail and tries to break out with his magic hammer. It is such a delightful surprise, it reminds me of another comedy that never took one moment for granted, Back to the Future, and the scene where the Michael Fox character sees his mother's family in the fifties and his uncle as baby in a play pen, and utters the immortal line, &#34;better get used to those bars, kid.&#34;",5,The best of the recent batch of Disney hit movies,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,2892,"['amazing', 'difference', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'make', 'case', 'John', 'Lassiter', 'move', 'Pixar', 'Disney', 'spelled', 'end', 'Pixar', 'extraordinary', 'creative', 'run', 'mini', 'revival', 'Disney', 'have', 'now', 'been', 'three', 'Disney', 'movies', 'guidance', 'Tangled', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'Frozen', 'are', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'watch', 'best', 'problem', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'are', 'deeply', 'sexist', 'man-hating', 'Tangled', 'simply', 'appalling', 'scenes', 'violence', 'enacted', 'mail', 'lead', 'Repunzel', 'repeated', 'bashing', 'head', 'frying', 'pan', 'knocking', 'unconscious', 'time', 'would', 'kill', 'ordinary', 'person', 'clear', 'message', 'young', 'girls', 'never', 'ok', 'people', 'hit', 'females', 'girls', 'can', 'feel', 'free', 'enact', 'physical', 'violence', 'men', 'Frozen', 'worse', 'again', 'man-hating', 'so', 'deeply', 'unnecessarily', 'core', 'seem', 'be', 'losing', 'editorial', 'balance.And', 'here', 'middle', 'two', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'wonderful', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'modest', 'beautifully', 'balanced', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'very', 'strong', 'lovely', 'male', 'female', 'leads', 'gentle', 'generous', 'moral', 'journey', 'not', 'one', 'very', 'great', 'Disney', 'movies', 'fine', 'addition', 'collection.It', 'will', 'certainly', 'survive', 'classic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'date', 'other', 'two', 'enjoyable', 'children', 'sexes', 'Ralph', 'core', 'concerns', 'outsider', 'make', 'film', 'appealing', 'adults', 'gratuitous', 'sarcasm', 'Shreck', 'genre.There', 'are', 'problems', 'say', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'settled', 'world', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'very', 'interesting', 'place', 'be', 'had', 'complaint', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'actual', 'game', 'Fix-It', 'Felix', ""n't"", 'worked', 'sufficiently', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'obvious', 'why', 'anybody', 'would', 'want', 'play', 'Others', 'complain', 'several', 'references', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'found', 'delightful', 'world', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'obviously', 'tilted', 'towards', 'East', 'Asian', 'sensibility', 'Hello', 'Kitty', 'kind', 'cutesy-pie', 'worlds', 'fun', 'same.The', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'world', 'aliens', 'traumatized', 'military', 'heroes', 'uber-masculine', 'female', 'corporal', 'who', 'everything', 'together', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'budding', 'respect', 'then', 'love', 'hapless', 'Fix-It', 'Felix', 'one', 'film', 'many', 'joys', 'script-writers', 'worked', 'hard', 'keep', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'perhaps', 'best', 'moment', 'right', 'end', 'when', 'Felix', 'jail', 'tries', 'break', 'out', 'magic', 'hammer', 'such', 'delightful', 'surprise', 'comedy', 'never', 'took', 'one', 'moment', 'granted', 'Back', 'Future', 'scene', 'where', 'Michael', 'Fox', 'character', 'mother', 'family', 'fifties', 'uncle', 'baby', 'play', 'pen', 'immortal', 'line', '34', 'better', 'get', 'used', 'bars', 'kid.', '34']",Wreck It Ralph

After two times of restarting the entire film to get away from peppy people talking about stuff at a seemingly louder volume than I was watching the actual feature at, I was finally able to wrestle my PS3 remote into revealing the magic ""go"" button, so at least that trial is over.But seriously? For the most part, I want pause to pause and do nothing else. Battletoads raised the bar by giving you a catchy NES percussion tune, but that's about as much as I can take. And as far as I know, there's no way to disable this Blu-Ray's feature, so briefly stopping the film is going to be a ""one-two"" pause-mute affair while you step out of the room for popcorn or a drink.Bonus features also include the ""Paperman"" short.

It was just that super, amazing, great Disney film that I haven't seen for a long while.Why is this movie so good? Disney somehow managed to make a movie that works for both little kids and kept the adults still loving it too. Yes, this movie is still gears towards the little kids more, but that's okay, because most likely you're watching this with a little kid(s) anyways.Can a ""bad guy"" be really a ""good guy""? For once in his life? Forever...maybe? Let see, yes he can! Wreck-IT-Ralph is about Ralph who is a video game bad guy and he was programmed to be a bad guy and he loves it! But, after awhile of doing bad things, he starts to feel he wants to be more than just the bad guy in his game and maybe be a good guy for once? Maybe even get a shinny medal on the way.You would think a zebra can't change his strips, but nothing impossible and even more so in this movie. Ralph went through a roller coaster of events and he actually did get a medal in this new game called Hero's Duty. Maybe he didn't get the medal the way it was supposed to get it, but it's his and he earned it his way. lol You will find it very funny yourself, once you see him get it.However, in unfortunate of events happened right after Ralph gets his medal. The medal he just won, then is lost too. Now comes in Vanellope a glitch in this new game that Ralph is in called Sugar Land. Vanellope is a very funny and playful character. She is also a glitch in the game and wants to become a true racer. Ralph of course hates her because she lost Ralph's medal, but now they both need each other help. Ralph will get back his medal and Vanellope can become a true racer, if they work together. This was very funny to watch for kids and adults alike.What adults will find very funny is the video game jokes, if you were into video games back then of course. If you weren't then some of the references may fly by over yourself, but that's okay because there more to this movie than just jokes. This movie is also about friendship, wanting something so much that you do anything for, making tough choices in life, and finally self sacrificing one life to save someone else.I left out a lot of things, and it is just too much to put down.

But let me guide you through Amazon's review system as well as give you my take on the DVD.Amazon has a general policy of grouping ALL the reviews of a film together and displaying them under all the formats. Reviews start when a film plays in theaters and then often goes to the Amazon Instant (streaming version).  So I often recommend - when posting my reviews - that you sort by ""most recent"" first and then look to see which version the reviewer is discussing.  (It's listed under their review.) If you are looking for special features, etc, that will help you. This is a review of the 4-disc 3D Bluray +Blu-ray+ DVD+Digital Copy, but it should guide you in your purchase, I hope.I'm afraid that I can't yet play 3-D discs so I can't help with that disc and the digital copies are now becoming standard as well the standard DVD - which you can play in your PC without a BD drive.The BD comes with four special features which total 42 minutes: There is 16- ""Bit by Bit"" where the Disney artists explain the five new ""Worlds"" (actually video games) and how each differs. Then come 5 ""deleted"" scenes (which are actually the animated storyboard of the scenes which play with - or without - commentary (15 minutes). There are four ""fake"" commercials for the new games that appear in the film (2  minutes total). And finally the Academy Award Winning animated short -""Paperman"" (6 minutes). This last bonus has literally nothing to do with anything else on the DVD or BD (other than that it was from Disney studios) but I loved it and glad it's there.As for the film, I came of age before the video game revolution and I really don't frequent arcades so most of the clever nods to early games (okay, I KNOW Pac Man; who doesn't?) but I still enjoyed the humor and wonderful drawing. These characters seemed more real to me than the Toy Story ones from Pixar.  I would have liked a commentary track or comments from the voice over actors. The BD has the ""intermission feature"" which can be fun or annoying.  When you press ""pause"" ""host"" Chris Hardwick comes on and spends a 9 minute/11 ""chapter"" loop telling you where to find hidden game references in the film. The problem is that, when you press pause it's usually to answer the phone or leave the room momentarily and want quiet. What you get, however, is Chris chatting away (and not even facing the camera.)Since there are lots of opinions on the film, I'll let you read other views. I just hope this review was helpful in deciding if the 4 disc combo set is what you want.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Review of Bluray Combo Pack - 42-minutes of Bonuses but no full length commentary or interviews with voice actors.,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,2652,"['Okay', 'can', 'see', 'review', 'been', 'preceded', 'post', '580', 'other', 'reviews', 'let', 'guide', 'Amazon', 'review', 'system', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'take', 'DVD.Amazon', 'general', 'policy', 'grouping', 'reviews', 'film', 'together', 'displaying', 'formats', 'Reviews', 'start', 'when', 'film', 'theaters', 'then', 'often', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'streaming', 'version', 'often', 'recommend', 'when', 'posting', 'reviews', 'sort', 'most', 'recent', 'first', 'then', 'look', 'see', 'version', 'reviewer', 'discussing', 'listed', 'review', 'are', 'looking', 'special', 'features', 'etc', 'will', 'help', 'review', '4-disc', '3D', 'Bluray', '+Blu-ray+', 'DVD+Digital', 'Copy', 'should', 'guide', 'purchase', 'hope.I', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'yet', 'play', '3-D', 'discs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'disc', 'digital', 'copies', 'are', 'now', 'becoming', 'standard', 'well', 'standard', 'DVD', 'can', 'play', 'PC', 'BD', 'drive.The', 'BD', 'four', 'special', 'features', 'total', '42', 'minutes', '16-', 'Bit', 'Bit', 'where', 'Disney', 'artists', 'explain', 'five', 'new', 'Worlds', 'actually', 'games', 'how', 'differs', 'Then', 'come', '5', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'animated', 'storyboard', 'scenes', 'play', 'commentary', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'four', 'fake', 'commercials', 'new', 'games', 'appear', 'film', '2', 'minutes', 'total', 'finally', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winning', 'animated', 'short', 'Paperman', '6', 'minutes', 'last', 'bonus', 'literally', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'DVD', 'BD', 'other', 'was', 'Disney', 'studios', 'loved', 'glad', 'there.As', 'film', 'came', 'age', 'video', 'game', 'revolution', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'frequent', 'arcades', 'so', 'most', 'clever', 'nods', 'early', 'games', 'okay', 'KNOW', 'Pac', 'Man', 'who', ""n't"", 'still', 'enjoyed', 'humor', 'wonderful', 'drawing', 'characters', 'seemed', 'more', 'real', 'Toy', 'Story', 'ones', 'Pixar', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'commentary', 'track', 'comments', 'voice', 'actors', 'BD', 'intermission', 'feature', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'annoying', 'When', 'press', 'pause', 'host', 'Chris', 'Hardwick', '9', 'minute/11', 'chapter', 'loop', 'telling', 'where', 'find', 'hidden', 'game', 'references', 'film', 'problem', 'when', 'press', 'usually', 'answer', 'phone', 'leave', 'room', 'momentarily', 'want', 'quiet', 'What', 'get', 'however', 'Chris', 'chatting', 'away', 'not', 'even', 'facing', 'camera', 'are', 'lots', 'opinions', 'film', ""'ll"", 'let', 'read', 'other', 'views', 'just', 'hope', 'review', 'was', 'helpful', 'deciding', '4', 'disc', 'combo', 'set', 'what', 'want.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Wreck It Ralph
1526053,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B00742SXOM,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","The newest Disney animated feature Wreck-It Ralph centers on a video game ""bad guy,"" Ralph, who was programmed to wreck things but yearns to someday play the hero. In the previews, I admittedly thought this premise a cheesy one and a pale comparison to the technological existentialism of the TRON series.Fortunately, as with the past several Disney animated classics, I was wrong. Wreck-It Ralph is more about socially constructed labels and how we can overcome them. Only we can define ourselves, and it is never to late to change our actions to become a better person. I honestly found this to be one of the better and more meaningful messages from a Disney movie. It wasn't about Ralph being victimized or being outcast, as much as it was him proactively seeking a better way of life.In terms of its pure content, Wreck-It Ralph is a very funny and creative adventure through the world of video games. I am by no means a gamer, but I could still recognize and enjoy the different styles of games that Ralph explores. Some of the biggest laughs came from the character Sgt. Calhoun, the soldier protagonist of the fictional game Hero's Duty. As one character describes, ""she has the most tragic backstory"": her wedding was interrupted by an alien robot breaking into the church and killing her would-be husband. The entire audience, of mostly adults at my midnight premiere showing, was dying of laughter!While the movie runs a bit long, it is still a lot of fun and delivers a very powerful message. The last 15 minutes or so are emotionally powerful, as the threat of loss and sacrifice put the characters' lives at stake. Each of the characters transcend what they were programmed to do, to carry out actions and relationships that they know in their hearts are right. As the ""bad guys"" repeat at their focus group, ""I am bad, and that's good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me.""",5,"Excellent, emotionally mature new Disney film",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,1908,"['newest', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'centers', 'video', 'game', 'bad', 'guy', 'Ralph', 'who', 'was', 'programmed', 'wreck', 'things', 'yearns', 'someday', 'play', 'hero', 'previews', 'admittedly', 'thought', 'premise', 'cheesy', 'one', 'pale', 'comparison', 'technological', 'existentialism', 'TRON', 'series.Fortunately', 'past', 'several', 'Disney', 'animated', 'classics', 'was', 'wrong', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'more', 'socially', 'constructed', 'labels', 'how', 'can', 'overcome', 'Only', 'can', 'define', 'never', 'late', 'change', 'actions', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'honestly', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'more', 'meaningful', 'messages', 'Disney', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'about', 'Ralph', 'being', 'victimized', 'being', 'outcast', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'proactively', 'seeking', 'better', 'way', 'life.In', 'terms', 'pure', 'content', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'very', 'funny', 'creative', 'adventure', 'world', 'video', 'games', 'am', 'gamer', 'could', 'still', 'recognize', 'enjoy', 'different', 'styles', 'games', 'Ralph', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'came', 'character', 'Sgt', 'Calhoun', 'soldier', 'protagonist', 'fictional', 'game', 'Hero', 'Duty', 'one', 'character', 'most', 'tragic', 'backstory', 'wedding', 'was', 'interrupted', 'alien', 'robot', 'breaking', 'church', 'killing', 'would-be', 'husband', 'entire', 'audience', 'mostly', 'adults', 'midnight', 'premiere', 'showing', 'was', 'dying', 'laughter', 'movie', 'bit', 'long', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'very', 'powerful', 'message', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'threat', 'loss', 'sacrifice', 'put', 'characters', 'lives', 'stake', 'characters', 'transcend', 'what', 'were', 'programmed', 'do', 'carry', 'out', 'actions', 'relationships', 'know', 'hearts', 'are', 'right', 'bad', 'guys', 'repeat', 'focus', 'group', 'am', 'bad', 'good', 'not', 'bad', 'one', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be']",Wreck It Ralph
1526054,A2PXUPVH1NJ06Q,B00742SXOM,"Steven L. Kent ""gamereader""","[7, 9]","Wreck-It Ralph is not a movie about a video game, at least not an existing video game.  It is a movie in the fashion of Tron, a movie about the hidden world inside video games.Here is the premise:  Ralph is the heavy in a game called Fix-It Felix, a fictitious Donkey Kong-era arcade classic built into a coin-op cabinet that looks almost exactly like a Donkey Kong machine.Ralph, sensitively voiced by John C. Reily (probably best known as Will Ferrell's sidekick in Step Brothers and Talladega Nights), is tired of life as a bad guy.  As the movie begins, he confesses this  in a support group for game villains called Badanon.  Other members of the group include such video game luminaries as Kano (Mortal Kombat), Satan (Diablo), M Bison (Street Fighter II), Zangief (Street Fighter II), Doctor Ivo Robotnick (Sonic The Hedgehog), and Bowzer (Super Mario Bros).  The leading the discussion is Clyde, the orange ghost from Pac-Man.Classic game character cameos abound in Wreck-it Ralph.The place where video game characters go to socialize in this arcade is Tapper's, the bar from the Midway game Root Beer Tapper.  (For the sake of Disney audiences, the bar did not have the big Budweiser logo scene in the original version of the game, which was simply named, Tapper.  Good call, Disney.)Feeling particularly perplexed on the thirtieth anniversary of his game, Ralph would like to have people root for him for a change. Hoping to find a little solace, he decides to embark on a quest for a medal to prove he is not such an awful guy--a quest which will take him into dangerous new locales such as Hero's Duty, a game that combines the shooter-on-rails action of Time Crisis, with the art direction of Gears of War, and the monsters of Alien--an amalgam shooting game in which players enter a bleak world killing futuristic bugs.While in Hero's Duty, Ralph meets Calhoun, the meanest, toughest-talking she-soldier in the history of video games--brilliantly voiced by Jane Lynch of Glee fame.After his tour in Hero's Duty, Ralph visits the ultra sweet world of Sugar Rush, which is sort of Mario Kart set in Candyland.  There, he meets Vanellope, voiced brilliantly by Sarah Silverman, who, as a programming glitch, is shunned by the other characters in her game.He's a bad guy; she's a misfit, you can see the chemistry bonding a mile away... and no one handles these relationships as well as Disney.We'll leave the plot unspoiled from here.The obvious question that comes up is, ""Is Wreck-It Ralph a movie for video game players.  The answer is, ""Yes and No.""  When it comes to cameos and references, the folks at Disney did NOT pull out all the stops.  There are lots and lots of game characters to spot--particularly in the arcade's electrical hub and along the wall of Tapper's; but the people who made this game did not go overboard.  They kept the story first and foremost, then let squeezed in game trivia whenever they cold.One of my favorite little trivia doffs was Mr. Litwak, the arcade owner.  A soft-spoken man dressed in an NFL Ref's shirt, he was clearly inspired by Walter Day, the world's most famous arcade owner and game record historian?  (Litwak--Waltir, I know, not a perfect anagram but close.)But you do not need to know about Walter Day or games like Road Blasters and Donkey Kong to fall in love with this perfectly executed, heart-warming, imaginative look into the secret life of video games.

I also liked that the requisite sad turn of events wasn't so bad that it made me tear up or squirm in my seat as they often do.  Overall a very fun movie that won't make kids cry.

Celebrating the &#34;least among us&#34; storyline.And another movie with the moral that a &#34;glitch&#34;, something that seemingly makes one different or &#34;bad&#34; or broken, isn't necessarily what it seems.  Maybe mostly because we can't trust the powers that be to have our best interests at heart but because they live out that adage &#34;power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely&#34;.  It's a real message, and it's cynical but the kids won't pick up on this though is anyone else desiring a kids movie where the powers that be, foibled as they are, are still ultimately trustworthy?  Or is it just me?Rant aside every movie needs a good villain; I'm not sure that King Candy qualifies (voiced by a thick-tongued spit-spraying Alan Tudyk) but there are other villains here as well set against Vanellope including the programming of the giant bugs that will eat everything if left unchecked.  The most interesting, of course, is Wreck-It Ralph himself who is a villain in his own video game but he longs to be far more than his confining coding allows.  The film is both about his journey and Vanellope's, both of them fighting against the life they've been assigned to, and both needing to embrace that aspect about themselves that they loathe in order to embrace their full potential and break free of their restricting conscripts.The story is done nicely, tightly, but I am wondering here if we are feeding our kids too much of this particular line and not enough messages that brokenness means that something truly doesn't work in a useful way, that it is actually detrimental?  That is just as often if not more how our world, complicated and complex as it is, works.  Regardless, this movie is by far a delight with main characters that are allowed to inhabit some complexities (yes, even the &#34;glass half-full&#34; Fix-It Felix) and Ralph's visit to the Sugar Rush video game land will simply give you cavities and may lead to diabetes it's so chock-full of candy-coated delight!  It's the digital version of Candyland.So if you're looking for an intelligent, good-hearted kid's movie that can also be a platform to have some important discussions with your pre-teen kiddies then Wreck-It Ralph fits this bill quite nicely.

But that does not mean it was bad. No, it was better than I expected it. At first I thought it was going to be a journey movie where Ralph would meet and be accompanied by Vanellope Von Schweetz along the way. But actually...no. It turned out to be a story I hadn't seen before. Ralph helping Vanellope in a her crisis. Helping her dream come true while having to deal with the evil King Candy. ANd speaking of which, I found King Candy a very well developed villain. When I thought this was a journey movie, I wondered how King Candy would be the main villain? Would he want what Ralph was after? But when I saw that this was about helping Vanellope, I saw where it made sense. King Candy being silly throughout the movie and revealing his true identity and personality. Don't worry, I won't spoil it. I will admit though, much like ""Toy Story 3"", I thought the idea of humans unknowingly ending arcade game characters' lives was a bit frightening, especially King Candy's lie about Vanellope getting killed. That scene almost made me cry as well as Ralph destroying Vanellope's kart. But I am definetly glad Vanellope was cured in the end. I do wish this film got the Academey Award for Best Animated Feature. But hey, it did get the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature, so that has to count for something.

Constantly subjected to scorn and ridicule simply for performing the only task available to you? What if you could change that?Fix-it Felix Jr. has been a popular game in Litvak's for years. The hero and titular character, Felix (voiced by Jack McBrayer) has a magic hammer that can repair any damage done by the game's villain, Ralph. When the game is over, Felix is given a medal while Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is tossed off the roof by the tenants of the building he failed to destroy. When the arcade closes and the game is turned off, Ralph returns to his home atop a garbage heap in the nearby dump. For recreation, he visits Tapper's, a vintage game that assigns the player the role of a bartender. Also, upon our introduction to the story, Ralph makes his first visit to a support group for video game villains. Among the villains in attendance at Bad-Anon, we see M. Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter (voiced by Gerald C. Rivers and director Rich Moore respectively), a ghost from Pac-Man (voiced by Kevin Deters), and a zombie (Raymond Persi). During that meeting, he announces he no longer wants to be a bad guy. With the 30th anniversary of Fix-it Felix Jr., the tenants throw a party and ""forget"" to invite Ralph. Ralph crashes the party, in every sense of the word, and leaves soon after. Before he's left, he vows to return with a medal, something denied him by Felix and the tenants of the building he destroys. He seizes the opportunity to travel to a new game, a first-person shooter game called Hero's Duty, when a character from that game passes out in the bathroom. While at the center of Hero's Duty, Ralph is overwhelmed by the violence in modern games and refuses to heed the orders of his superior, Sergeant Calhoun (voiced by Jane Lynch). Once the arcade closes and the game ends, Ralph decides to forego the usual hurdles of Hero's Duty and steal the medal typically awarded to the winner. After stealing the medal and, unwittingly, bringing a menacing enemy insect known as a Cy-bug with him, Ralph heads to the kart-racing game Sugar Rush. It's there that he encounters the perpetually glitchy and terminally annoying Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman). Despite the initial friction, Ralph and Vanellope (Silverman) bond over their shared status as outcasts.There is, of course, more to the story including Felix's pursuit of Ralph into the various other games and his budding romance with the no-nonsense Sergeant Calhoun, the true origin of Silverman's character, and an eventual revolt in the world of Sugar Rush. All of it, and I do mean all of it, had me riveted.

The problem is that in order to do this he must leave his game which has the possibility of making his game out-of-order.I'll admit that &#34;Wreck it Ralph&#34; is not my kind of movie. Despite the video game premise, I just couldn't relate to it. This is probably because it mostly references arcade games. Although I will admit there is a scene involving Ralph going into an FPS, that is admittedly awesome. If you've never seen it before, I recommend renting it, but you probably won't feel the need to watch it again.With that said, I think this is a perfect family movie.

1526120,A3SO4SZPDNW0S3,B00742SXOM,William Krischke,"[3, 3]","Taking a page out of the ""Toy Story"" book, ""Wreck It Ralph"" is about the characters that populated our childhood, and what they do when we're not watching. (Unlike Woody and Buzz, however, these guys don't give a darn if the kids who play with them like them or not. It's just a job.) Ralph is the bad guy in a video game titled ""Fix It Felix, Jr."" that occupies space in an old-fashioned arcade - the kind that actually took quarters and was managed by a guy wearing, for some mysterious reason, a referee's striped shirt.When the arcade closes and the kids go home, the characters' lives go on. But Ralph doesn't have much of a life, because he's a bad guy, and everybody in his game hates him. The rest of the characters throw a party, but they don't invite Ralph. Instead, he goes to a Baddies Anonymous meeting, where he commiserates with Zangief (from ""Street Fighter"") and Bowser (from an endless number of ""Mario"" games) about how hard it is to be a bad guy. Zangief reminds him that ""just because you are Bad Guy, doesn't mean you are bad...guy!"" Their motto as a group is ""I'm bad, and that's good."" The meeting doesn't help Ralph much, maybe because he's not the one that needs to hear it. What they really have is a PR problem; instead of sitting in an Anonymous meeting, these bad guys really should be taking their message to the streets.Ralph decides he's going to win a medal, just like Felix does, and thus win the love and respect of the folks in his game. So he sneaks into a HALO-style first person shooter and steals the medal from the end, in the meanwhile setting off a chain of events that threaten the existence of the entire video game sub-world.This all happens in the first half hour, and, if this were just an average movie, I would be able to guess the rest of the film at this point in it. Ralph would spend the next 60(ish) minutes trying to clean up the mess he'd made, and in the process, he would save the video game world, and at the end, just when he thinks of himself as a bad guy for real, everyone would see him as a hero and they would give him the medal he so badly wanted and tried to steal.But this is a better, more interesting film than that. Ralph gets himself into trouble, and is plunged in to the candy-coated world of Sugar Rush, a go-kart racing game where nobody is quite what they seem. He loses his medal to a punk kid voiced by Sarah Silverman, and is forced into an agreement with her where if he helps her win a big race, she'll give him his medal back. But then King Candy, the ruler of Sugar Rush (voiced by Alan Tudyk, doing a spot-on and very entertaining impression of Ed Wynn from ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"") pulls him aside to explain that if the kid is allowed to win the race, it would spell doom for the entire game, as well as certain death for her. What's Ralph to do?""Wreck It Ralph"" does an excellent job of layering its exposition, so that a seemingly throwaway comment in one scene suddenly becomes an important plot point ten or twenty minutes later.  That's a pretty simple storytelling principle (though it's far too often ignored in Hollywood,) but what's really impressive is that these comments never feel like they're being dropped on purpose; it's never obvious that the screenwriters are telling us something we'll need to know later in the story.  That takes talent, and it's on display here.  ""Wreck It Ralph"" creates and inhabits a clearly unbelievable world, but it's written so well that it feels more believable, more lived in, than some movies that purport to exist in the real world.  Contrast this, for instance with ""Looper;"" that movie did a lot of things right, but the hints it dropped were so clunky and obvious that they broke the illusion; I knew what was coming well before it came, and spent nearly the last half of the film bored.Another of the things that I loved about this film was that both main characters' quest for actualization puts their respective worlds in jeopardy.  When Ralph is absent from ""Fix It Felix, Jr."" the game can't function, and the real world owner of the arcade (the guy in the referee shirt) prepares to junk it. The punk kid (I've been avoiding her name, because it's such an unholy mouthful, but for the record, it's Vanellope Von Schweetz) feels in her bones that she's a racer, but following that impulse threatens to bring her whole world down around her ears.  Their problems look like personal problems, but really, they're community problems; for both of them, the perspective of their entire community is going to need to shift before things can be restored to order and harmony.That's an awfully academic paragraph about a kids' movie.  But ""Wreck It Ralph"" isn't your run-of-the-mill kids' movie. It passed the kids' test in my house; my 4 year old likes it, though she thinks the bugs are too scary. I like it, too, because it offers something deeper, meatier and more nuanced for adult eyes.  And I'm not just talking about the '80s video game references that go right over my pre schooler's head.  This is one I won't mind watching over and over again.Random Notes:A lot of critics complained about the ""Sugar Rush,"" segment of the film, saying that it was nauseatingly bright, aimed at drawing girls into the movie, and rife with product placement.  But go-cart racing games are ALWAYS like that.  Mario Kart exists in a cartoon world, that's part of what makes it so fun.  So does Diddy Kong Racing, and CTR, the two I played the most (and love the best) those college days I was supposed to be writing essays about Kierkegaard.  As a twenty something male, I would have played Sugar Rush.  I would have obsessed over it.If I have one complaint with ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" it might be that the voice actors are a little TOO familiar, if that's possible.  Jack McBrayer makes Felix basically the same character as the one he plays on 30 Rock.  McBrayer's a funny guy, but it's disappointing he doesn't have more range.  Same with Jane Lynch; she's basically playing Sue Sylvester in an armored suit, right down to the weird verbal stylings (""Fear is a four letter word, ladies.  If you want to go pee pee in your big boy slacks, keep it to yourself"" is totally something Sue would say.)I have to admit - the nostalgia kicked in.  I had to stop the film multiple times to Wikipedia video games I had forgotten about but had spent countless hours playing when I was a kid.One thing Ralph gets wrong: Asteroids and Centipede are two of very few games from 30 years ago that are still around.Would Skrillex really play ""Celebration"" by Kool & the Gang at a party?  Hard to believe.They seem to be intentionally messing with gender stereotypes in the gamers.  A little girl plays Hero's Duty, and it's two jerk boys who tell her they're going to spend all day playing Sugar Rush.One thing that's always bothered me about ""Toy Story.""  How in the world can Buzz not be aware he's a toy if he has to go rigid and plastic every time Andy walks in the room?  Does he just black out and not remember being played with?",4,"Better, Deeper, More Layered Than Your Average Kids' Movie",1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,7062,"['Taking', 'page', 'Toy', 'Story', 'book',

Plus, these sheople actually learn that if they behave differently then what they were told they were not just reinforced differently, they have free will.  URGH!!!!  People should learn the brain works through the contingencies of reinforcement and behavior can be reinforced that espouses propaganda OR behavior is conditioned to be the opposite of what we are told OR behavior is somewhere in between DEPENDING on the circumstances, real world variables NOT mentalism or made up illusions like free will.  If people are reinforced to behave differently then the propaganda they were fed then that is how they were programmed.  Anyone can also see ""good"" and ""bad"", (what is ""good"" for you can be ""bad"" for someone else and vice versa), are relative AND the consequences that occur on schedules of reinforcement are what determines behavior, but every human I encounter is reinforced to never understand the evidence.

1526137,AP3B615GM191G,B00742SXOM,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Before the invention of home video consoles or the smartphone games that are now so ubiquitous, there was the ""arcade generation"", who controlled their pixels at the arcade via quarters.  ""Wreck-It Ralph"" taps into that ""arcade nostalgia"" by focusing on the ""downtime"" exploits of the arcade's heroes and villains.For a basic plot summary, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" follows a premise very similar to ""Toy Story"" in that when the arcade closes for the night, the characters behind the glass come to life.  In one particular game entitled ""Fix-It Felix Jr."", the ""bad guy"" character named Wreck-It Ralph (voice of John C. Reily) is having a rough time due to the fact that he is an outcast in his own game.  One day, Ralph decides to game-jump (a move that can have devastating consequences on all parties involved) in a quest to prove that he isn't all bad.  Along the way, he meets up with a ""glitch"" named Vanellope (Sarah Silverman), who helps him to understand what being a ""good guy"" is truly all about.Story-wise, this is pretty stock Disney fare.  It is a feel-good message that, at times, can get a little predictable.  The voice-overs match the characters, the plot moves along nicely, and overall it is just a well-paced film.  It is full of enough sight gags and crazy antics to hook the kiddies in right away and keep their interest throughout.Of course, the new era of Disney animation needs more than that, so the ""hook"" of this film is the nostalgia that adults will feel towards the arcade atmosphere.  The film has cameos from many past games (Bowser, Q*bert, & the Street Fighter cast being the most obvious), as well as pays homage to the ""beeps and boops"" and sometimes jerky motions of those old classics.  For true fans of the history of gaming, there are enough ""easter eggs"" hidden in the background, so to speak, to pique your interest and/or make you chuckle.Overall, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a fine film filled with humor, heart, and (most importantly) video game nostalgia.  It isn't quite as perfectly polished as some other Disney fare (thus the one-star deduction), but it still was fun to watch for both old and young.",4,Tapping Into Arcade Nostalgia,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,2135,"['invention', 'home', 'video', 'consoles', 'smartphone', 'games', 'are', 'now', 'so', 'ubiquitous', 'was', 'arcade', 'generation', 'who', 'controlled', 'pixels', 'arcade', 'quarters', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'arcade', 'nostalgia', 'focusing', 'downtime', 'exploits', 'arcade', 'heroes', 'villains.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'premise', 'very', 'similar', 'Toy', 'Story', 'when', 'arcade', 'night', 'characters', 'glass', 'come', 'life', 'one', 'particular', 'game', 'entitled', 'Fix-It', 'Felix', 'Jr.', 'bad', 'guy', 'character', 'named', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'voice', 'John', 'C.', 'Reily', 'having', 'rough', 'time', 'due', 'fact', 'outcast', 'own', 'game', 'One', 'day', 'Ralph', 'game-jump', 'move', 'can', 'have', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'parties', 'involved', 'quest', 'prove', ""n't"", 'bad', 'way', 'up', 'glitch', 'named', 'Vanellope', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'who', 'understand', 'what', 'being', 'good', 'guy', 'truly', 'about.Story-wise', 'pretty', 'stock', 'Disney', 'fare', 'feel-good', 'message', 'times', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'predictable', 'voice-overs', 'match', 'characters', 'plot', 'moves', 'along', 'nicely', 'overall', 'just', 'well-paced', 'film', 'full', 'enough', 'sight', 'gags', 'crazy', 'antics', 'hook', 'kiddies', 'right', 'away', 'keep', 'interest', 'throughout.Of', 'course', 'new', 'era', 'Disney', 'animation', 'more', 'hook', 'film', 'nostalgia', 'adults', 'will', 'feel', 'arcade', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'cameos', 'many', 'past', 'games', 'Bowser', 'Q*bert', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'cast', 'being', 'most', 'obvious', 'as', 'well', 'pays', 'homage', 'beeps', 'boops', 'sometimes', 'jerky', 'motions', 'old', 'classics', 'true', 'fans', 'history', 'gaming', 'are', 'enough', 'easter', 'eggs', 'hidden', 'background', 'so', 'speak', 'pique', 'interest', 'and/or', 'make', 'chuckle.Overall', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'fine', 'film', 'filled', 'humor', 'heart', 'most', 'importantly', 'video', 'game', 'nostalgia', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'perfectly', 'polished', 'other', 'Disney', 'fare', 'thus', 'one-star', 'deduction', 'still', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'old', 'young']",Wreck It Ralph
