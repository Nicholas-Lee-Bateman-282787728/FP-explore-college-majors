I collect children's books for their illustrations so thought this might be inspiring as well.  It is a cute story about an aunt and her niece going on vacation and creating fairy dwellings together.  The aunt, who is also the producer of the movie, sketches and works on her book throughout.  It is because of this that it became a bit shameless in self promotion and that was a distraction for me. I think it would have been better to have given the gift of sharing fairy dwellings, the relationship between aunt and niece and left the self promo and ""advertising"" out, or maybe just inserted it at the end. I think it was beautiful to see the aunt drawing the little girl though.",4,Cute,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,751,"['sweet', 'little', 'movie', 'course', 'suited', 'children', 'collect', 'children', 'books', 'illustrations', 'so', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'inspiring', 'as', 'well', 'cute', 'story', 'aunt', 'niece', 'going', 'vacation', 'creating', 'fairy', 'dwellings', 'together', 'aunt', 'who', 'also', 'producer', 'movie', 'sketches', 'book', 'became', 'bit', 'shameless', 'self', 'promotion', 'was', 'distraction', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'given', 'gift', 'sharing', 'fairy', 'dwellings', 'relationship', 'aunt', 'niece', 'left', 'self', 'promo', 'advertising', 'out', 'maybe', 'just', 'inserted', 'end', 'think', 'was', 'beautiful', 'see', 'aunt', 'drawing', 'little', 'girl']",Kristen's Fairy House The Fairy Houses Series  VHS

Kristen discovers fairy houses, which are simple, all natural constructions made for fairies.  She makes several, and then observes them regularly for signs of fairies.  She sees many signs of animal life, not fairy life.  At the very end, however, there are signs of - well, you decide!My children of course wanted to make their own fairy houses, which apparently naturalists now discourage on this particular island in Maine, but I have not stopped my children from picking up bark, twigs, fallen leaves and stones, and propping them up against the base of a tree to make their own fairy houses, particularly in our own yard.The book is a nice companion to the movie.",5,"A lovely, slow-paced story",1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,897,"['good', 'video', 'motivating', 'children', 'look', 'more', 'closely', 'natural', 'world', 'surrounding', 'them.A', 'young', 'girl', 'Kristen', 'artist', 'aunt', 'go', 'island', 'Maine', 'aunt', 'can', 'paint', 'illustrations', 'book', 'Kristen', 'fairy', 'houses', 'are', 'simple', 'natural', 'constructions', 'made', 'fairies', 'several', 'then', 'regularly', 'signs', 'fairies', 'many', 'signs', 'animal', 'life', 'not', 'fairy', 'life', 'very', 'end', 'however', 'are', 'signs', 'well', 'decide', 'children', 'course', 'wanted', 'make', 'own', 'fairy', 'houses', 'apparently', 'now', 'discourage', 'particular', 'island', 'Maine', 'have', 'not', 'stopped', 'children', 'picking', 'up', 'bark', 'twigs', 'fallen', 'leaves', 'stones', 'propping', 'up', 'base', 'tree', 'make', 'own', 'fairy', 'houses', 'particularly', 'own', 'yard.The', 'book', 'nice', 'companion', 'movie']",Kristen's Fairy House The Fairy Houses Series  VHS
