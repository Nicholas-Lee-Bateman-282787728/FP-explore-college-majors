This is a ABC Family Movie, and it stays true to it's format, mild drama, silly humor, nice people.The gazillionaire owner of a solar/green energy company takes his family, 2 grown up children from prior, widowed marriage, and baby and wife from new marriage(see parts I & II, if you can find them!) to gorgeous Puerto Rico for family time together.Of course, it's hard to get everyone on the same page in paradise: there's some mild thematic tension between what father wants and what his young, adult children seek in life; what wife wants- more babies, stay at home?, and the fact that his company is in trouble.The same main actors reprise their roles.  Gregory Harrison has aged nicely since I remember him in ""Trapper John, M.D."".  Hard to believe he'll hit 60 this year- what a great smile!The acting, editing, music are adequate, nothing memorable or emotionally stirring. The locations are great.  If you like TV family shows or Hallmark, you'll like this one.
