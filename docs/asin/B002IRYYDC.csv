Neuman, one of the great comic Presidential candidates, and a very funny guy in an understated, dead pan brand of comedy.

Unfortunately he was not allowed to present fully developed material on his own 1970 ABC show.When watching the shows I couldn't believe they were so barely professional - this was network television, after all, not a local affiliate production. When I watched the extras his son Monty revealed why. The entire half season run (13 episodes) was taped in two days. There was no time for much of anything - sets, revisions, even retakes of flubbed lines.Steve Martin was a principal writer. His mark, and the beginnings of his comedy evolution, are obvious, but I'm guessing he might have given up half of his salary to have had more time to work his ideas and the nascent material. In all honesty, and apart from nostalgia, most of the material is not all that funny, certainly not in a ""whole greater than the sum of the parts"" sort of way.The shows become even more rickety when the extras are watched. These extras, which highlight some of Pat's best pieces from other venues, suggest what his Half a Comedy Hour might have been. The extras are the highlight of the set and alone are worth the (discounted, anyway) purchase.Just remove the word Hour from the title and you'll have a good idea what to expect.",3,Pat deserved better,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1293,"['always', 'enjoyed', 'Pat', 'Paulsen', 'Smo', 'Bro', 'was', 'pro', 'deadpan', 'mistiming', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'present', 'fully', 'developed', 'material', 'own', '1970', 'ABC', 'show.When', 'watching', 'shows', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'were', 'so', 'barely', 'professional', 'was', 'network', 'television', 'not', 'local', 'affiliate', 'production', 'When', 'watched', 'extras', 'son', 'Monty', 'revealed', 'why', 'entire', 'half', 'season', 'run', '13', 'episodes', 'was', 'taped', 'two', 'days', 'was', 'time', 'much', 'anything', 'sets', 'revisions', 'even', 'retakes', 'flubbed', 'lines.Steve', 'Martin', 'was', 'principal', 'writer', 'mark', 'beginnings', 'comedy', 'evolution', 'are', 'obvious', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'half', 'salary', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'work', 'ideas', 'nascent', 'material', 'honesty', 'apart', 'nostalgia', 'most', 'material', 'not', 'funny', 'certainly', 'not', 'whole', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts', 'sort', 'way.The', 'shows', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'rickety', 'when', 'extras', 'are', 'watched', 'extras', 'highlight', 'Pat', 'best', 'pieces', 'other', 'venues', 'suggest', 'what', 'Comedy', 'Hour', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'extras', 'are', 'highlight', 'set', 'alone', 'are', 'discounted', 'anyway', 'purchase.Just', 'remove', 'word', 'Hour', 'title', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'expect']",N/A

I remember it as one of the funniest shows on televison and am eager to see how it stands the test of time. Regular routines included a takeoff on a popular series of the same period called ""Then Came Bronson"" about a disillusioned man who quits his job to travel the country on his motorcycle and ""find America."" Called ""Then Came Paulsen"" it included tongue-in-cheek titles like ""I've Got A Monkey On My Back And I Can't Stop."" Another frequent segment was called ""Hobbie Hut"" where Paulsen regularly destroyed the projects of his American Indian co-host. Interview segments included Daffy Duck and a very funny double interview with a very ratty looking Smoke the Bear and the Cookie Bear form the Andy Williams Show. I'm very excited about the opportunity to see this again.
