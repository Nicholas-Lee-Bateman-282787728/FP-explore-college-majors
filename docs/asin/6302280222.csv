305437,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,6302280222,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[38, 45]","The first Blue Lagoon was daring and a bit controversial. It showed two children growing up without adults in their lives, growing up without inhibitions, without guidance, and learning some fundamental truths without help. It dared to show full-frontal nudity (carefully!) because that seemed natural. It had the courage to confront things like child birth for child-adults who had no idea of what was going on. That's some of what makes it a classic film, one which holds up even today.This film, for all that it is a sequel, comes across as a revisionist attempt to ""clean up"" the original. It starts where the previous film left off, with a small boat being seen by a sailing vessel. Unlike the end of the previous film, where all three occupants of the boat are pronounced alive, in this film the parents are dead, and only the child survives. He is taken aboard the sailing vessel and entrusted to the care of a recently widowed woman who has an infant daughter. The woman, Sarah Hargreaves (Lisa Pelikan), and the two children, are cast adrift in a lifeboat a short while later because the ship is infected with cholera (a virtual death sentence for all aboard) - they are cast adrift in the hope they may survive. By pure happenstance (alright, by a piece of not-very-clever script-writing) they happen to arrive at an island that is supposed to look awfully familiar.This time the children grow up with Sarah to teach them right and wrong, and all about God (she was a missionary), and so forth (all the things that were ""wrong"" in the first version). Eventually Sarah contracts pneumonia and dies, but not before she has time to explain how she'd like to be buried. Time passes and we get to see the new teenagers, Lilli (Milla Jovovich) and Richard (Brian Krause - best known as Leo in the TV show Charmed) doing the same sorts of things as we saw in the first film.All in all, I cannot recommend this poor-quality remake. Buy the original, certainly, but leave this one sitting on the shelf. Perhaps the one good reason to watch this film is as an object lesson, to see what the original film could have been like, had the makers not taken the risks that they did.",3,Not as good as the original,1103068800,"12 15, 2004",2004,2176,"['first', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'was', 'daring', 'bit', 'controversial', 'showed', 'two', 'children', 'growing', 'up', 'adults', 'lives', 'growing', 'up', 'inhibitions', 'guidance', 'learning', 'fundamental', 'truths', 'help', 'dared', 'show', 'full-frontal', 'nudity', 'carefully', 'seemed', 'natural', 'had', 'courage', 'confront', 'things', 'child', 'birth', 'child-adults', 'who', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'classic', 'film', 'one', 'up', 'even', 'today.This', 'film', 'sequel', 'across', 'revisionist', 'attempt', 'clean', 'up', 'original', 'where', 'previous', 'film', 'left', 'off', 'small', 'boat', 'being', 'seen', 'sailing', 'vessel', 'end', 'previous', 'film', 'where', 'three', 'occupants', 'boat', 'are', 'pronounced', 'alive', 'film', 'parents', 'are', 'dead', 'only', 'child', 'taken', 'sailing', 'vessel', 'entrusted', 'care', 'recently', 'widowed', 'woman', 'who', 'infant', 'daughter', 'woman', 'Sarah', 'Hargreaves', 'Lisa', 'Pelikan', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'cast', 'adrift', 'lifeboat', 'short', 'while', 'later', 'ship', 'infected', 'cholera', 'virtual', 'death', 'sentence', 'aboard', 'are', 'cast', 'adrift', 'hope', 'may', 'survive', 'pure', 'happenstance', 'alright', 'piece', 'not-very-clever', 'script-writing', 'happen', 'arrive', 'island', 'supposed', 'look', 'awfully', 'familiar.This', 'time', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'Sarah', 'teach', 'right', 'wrong', 'God', 'was', 'missionary', 'so', 'forth', 'things', 'were', 'wrong', 'first', 'version', 'Eventually', 'Sarah', 'contracts', 'pneumonia', 'dies', 'not', 'time', 'explain', 'how', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'buried', 'Time', 'passes', 'get', 'see', 'new', 'teenagers', 'Lilli', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Richard', 'Brian', 'Krause', 'best', 'known', 'Leo', 'TV', 'show', 'Charmed', 'doing', 'same', 'sorts', 'things', 'saw', 'first', 'film.All', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'poor-quality', 'remake', 'Buy', 'original', 'certainly', 'leave', 'one', 'sitting', 'shelf', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'good', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'object', 'lesson', 'see', 'what', 'original', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'makers', 'not', 'taken', 'risks', 'did']",Return to the Blue Lagoon VHS

Baker ""book addict""","[1, 1]","I bought this after seeing a 47 second trailer and then reading a few 3-5 star reviews which I feel now were not well thought out. I saw a little of the acting of the two main characters, Jovovich and Krause and they are both the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. They cannot hold a candle to Chris and Brooke in ""The Blue Lagoon"" of 1984. Krause, the teen boy in the 1991 version is  arrogant, haughty and rude as an actor. I don't like Milla's eyes as they look evil all the time. Maybe that is why all of her recent movies are about evilness which seems to suit her. I can't say too much more about this because I asked for a refund due to technical problems so I did not see all of it or the part where they fall in love and have a baby. It may have gotten better but I can't see that happening from the beginning of the film. I just thought they were both wrong for these parts and should stick to the villian roles they both play in their other movies. This one required sweet and tender innocence which neither of them have.  Oh and right at the beginning there is a scene where a missionary woman murders the boatman sailing with her with a whale hook. It was horrible! Yikes! It was just a mess! I do not recommend this as a sequel to the first wonderful lagoon film. Watch that one and just enjoy the fact that they were taken back to the Island by the father of Richard.

The first was more overtly sensual and raw than this one could have been, but, it is, after all, the same movie with different actors.The son of Richard and Em, RIchard Jr., is rescued at sea when his parents (Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields) were attempting to leave their island home at the end of the first movie.  Though the rescuing ship crew asks if they were dead when they were found, someone says that they were just sleeping.  When this movie begins at that point, the two are, in fact, dead, but their son Richard Jr. is alive.  The rescuing ship sinks, and a woman with Richard Jr. and her daughter, Lilly, will be marooned on an island in the South Pacific.  The woman dies soon after of illness, and Richard and Lilly are left alone on the island, to relive just what Brooke and Chris did in the first movie.I wonder why they felt they had to make a sequal to a movie like Blue Lagoon, and if so this was more like a remake rather than the next chapter.  There are not one but two sequals (written by Henry De Vere Stacpoole in 1908, which included the first book, The Blue Lagoon, and the next two, Garden of God and The Gates of Morning).  The next book in the trilogy, as crazy as it may sound, is rather similar to their having Richard Jr. marooned again on the island but there are other things that happen to him rather than just falling for his female companion.  The story continuing is just kind of ridiculous, but then again that's the point isn't it?  I would have liked to see Richard Jr. be taken back to civilization and lead a civilized life.  THAT would be something.  And Richard Jr. and Lilly look just like their predecesors, and have every experience they had.  The only exception to this was the inclusion of the mother figure at the beginning on the island.  Here it was established that they learned some social, language, and survival skills from her, making their long existence on the island alone a little more believable.  Plus there is no suggestion of incest as it was in the first one, and they didn't have to use a fake nude Milla in some scenes.  The actors are HOT, and why wouldn't you want to see some gorgeous people having sex with other gorgeous people?  The innocence they have is rather appealing, but it was done the first time with more impact with the first movie.Even the scenery wasn't as beuatiful as the first one's, but it was still wonderful.  Who wouldn't want a sandy beach for just a day or two to lounge about on?  And with a handsome man at that.
