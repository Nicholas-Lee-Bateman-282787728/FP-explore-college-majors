586550,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00005JKIO,A. Burchfield,"[1, 1]","So many movies seem to have pretty people and music but not much plot, Collateral Damage is different. I thought the part about a terrorist strike in the U.S. was pretty well done, as was Brewer's reaction to seeing his 'family' killed. The behavior of our government all through the movie also struck me as being just the way the politicians (and CIA field types) would behave. I did like the way the FBI agent seemed more supportive to Brewer, some guys really would be that way. I do think that our hero's preparations for his trip to Columbia (what was he going to do down there, beat the guy to death with his bare hands?)could've been better and most of the Columbian action seemed pretty silly to me. Brewer keeps stumbling and falling around, most of us would, but the unlikely part is the way he keeps getting beatings that would surely break or at least crack some bones. I actually did't mind that the good guy never touched a gun, he sure made a mess of things with his improvised devices.  The back in the U.S. action scenes had a couple of surprises and I thought seemed more believable to me, no impossible beatings but a lot of pretty sensible action. This is the first Schwarzenegger as an American movie that I've seen that doesn't ignore his still obvious Austrian accent, there's a joke or two about that in the story.

I wasn't aware that all firemen were made to through a Green Beret or SWAT program, because he looks like he's taken a few courses in each. Gordon Brewer (Schwarzengger) handles guns, axes, and knives in style like he's been doing it for years, but since this is an Arnold film I'm able to forgive his characters which frequently defy all belief.In a nutshell this movie is about Brewer's revenge scheme as he hunts down the terrorists who killed his wife and child in a bombing, and tries to stop him before he strikes again. The plot isn't great, what with a fireman somehow breaking into a guerrillas home and all, but director Andrew Davis keeps the film going at a brisk pace, and it's never boring.

586555,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JKIO,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[0, 0]","I was a bit disappointed by this film for reasons that are best described as frivolous and unrelated to the film itself or its subject. The simple truth is that Arnold is getting a bit too old to play these kinds of parts. He looks a little too long in the tooth here to be believed as the father of a young son with an equally young and beautiful wife. His continuing image as the man of iron is hard to square with his actual on-screen image, which shows a man who looks all of his fifty-five years and then some. Perhaps if he were playing an aging international tycoon with a trophy wife he had earned along the way it would be more palatable, but in this scenario with him being an ordinary fireman in Southern California his situation seems laughable.So does the plot, which is tired, overwrought, and so wildly improbable that one's mind reels as the special effects shows him thinking out loud how to get into Columbia to look for his family's murderer even as he does so.  He seems to have discovered little known routes into the country on-line, so he must have one hell of a search engine.  Again, what unfolds after he makes this journey is so far-fetched that it boggles the mind. Then again, this is an Arnold movie!The action sequences are imaginative and well-choreographed, and he shows a lot of energy and strength still remaining after all his recent health woes, which makes one wonder if he isn't trying to make a point here.  His portrayal is strictly by the numbers, and we wonder where the smart and thoughtful guy we saw in ""True Lies"" or Predator"" escaped to. This is mindless entertainment, but the action is good and one can wile away two hours in the big guy's company. One only hopes his next epic effort with the return of the Terminator in ""T-3"" will give him and his career a much needed boost back into superior film making.

I mean like, I realize this scene is supposed to set us up for how much this aging Arnold loves his son, but, please, OMG, not THIS way, ok? See what I'm saying. I mean, he leaves his HOT young wife alone in bed very early in the morning to go play legos with his boy, and builds some kind of missiles system? This old  dude needs to get some serious therapy, if he WANTS to remain free and not required to visit his son only under the close supervision of some old lady and a video camera, and the kid needs a chance to get a life. Okay, so like I get it, for this miserable script writer and director, this for them are cozy family scenes setting us up for the alleged horror of Arnold losing them all, but dude, like, after the embracing in the naked shower scene, dude, like, it's hard to get all worked up about the boy getting the heck away from aging Arnold.Know what I mean?And that's not even looking at the completely wrong and stupid and awful politics underlying it all here, and the misrepresentation, the total fiction, of the politics in Colombia.

In the wake of that tragedy, this movie seems a bit anachronistic.  By itself, it is a typical Arnold actioner.  While Schwarzenegger is billed as an average Joe -- a heroic fireman -- he remains the indestructible hero that he's played countless times before.  Somehow, he takes on an entire terrorist organization -- you can figure out how it ends.  In any case, it isn't a bad movie per se.  Some good action sequences and thrills with an interesting plot twist -- one that isn't too hard to see coming as the movie progresses, but it's still interesting.  The movie attempts to be even at times -- humanizing the terrorists and problematizing the ""heroes"" -- but it is never with any sincerity and the good guys and bad guys are still pretty clear-cut.Would have been a better movie, I think, if Arnold's character was a bit darker and his antagonists, a bit more multilayered (they attempt to provide backstory for the bad characters, but without any real depth so it is hard to feel conflicted -- which is fine for an Arnie movie but for this subject matter, you wish there were more complexity).In any case, it's okay but clearly one of his weaker efforts.

Then Arnold plunges down formidable waterfalls, no doubt in preparation for how hopeless he feels tackling California's budget crisis.  And what can you say about his on-again/off-again relationship with femme fatale Francesca Neri, other than it reminds us of how he chased Ariana Huffington out of the race?It all makes sense to me now.

Or that he he&#65533;s being handled with someone like the vision of James Cameron.This one, alas, is not that movie.  I guess this one was shelved from release shortly after 9/11, because America, for some reason, didn&#65533;t need to be told that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack on our soil. I guess sometimes underestimating the intelligence of people can pay off at the box office (see &#65533;Jackass&#65533;),  but in this case Hollywood decides to pull this one for awhile because we are not &#65533;ready&#65533; to see such things.What Hollywood should have done instead is make a film that would actually challenge us about the issue about domestic terrorism.  I had my problems with &#65533;The Sum of All Fears&#65533;, but at least that movie had layer upon layer of issues that go way beyond making things go Boom.  There was no way to expect 9/11, but had Hollywood made an intelligent film to begin with on the issue, they could have shown the good their industry is capable of.But no, this one is complete formula.  Arnold is a perfect man, one who can put out a fire single-handedly while saving a kitten from a tree at the same time.  He is, of course a completely devoted family man, who&#65533;s worst fault is parking in a red zone.

586572,A228NBNLYJ8V3J,B00005JKIO,Eran Cohen,"[3, 10]","Forget the negative criticism you've heard about this movie - this is the best Schwarzenegger film of the last 10 years .A decade has past since the great ""Terminator II - Judgment Day"" had hit the screens . Schwarzenegger continued to deliver films throughout this period of time , winding up with good though more frequently bad films (apparently the worse ones have made better in the box office) . More than occasionally critics have whispered the last rites for is career , with ""Collateral Damage"" Arnold comes forward and says : ""not yet"" , but it might be one of the last times .The plot ---------In a nutshell , Columbian terrorists blow a bomb in L.A , for reasons later explained in the movie , killing Gordon Brewer's (Schwarzenegger) wife and son . On account of the incompetence of the authorities to find the ones responsible and bring them to justice , Gordon decides to engage his own enterprise to punish the bombers . Sounds familiar ? It is (more on that further on) .The movie can be divided to three parts :1 - U.S : The Tragedy .2 - Columbia : The Hunt .3 - U.S : Final Reckoning .The really interesting , entertaining and exciting stuff is in the third part , which takes place after about 1 hour and 15 minutes . Before that , the movie was the usual action flick : Okay to watch but no more . This epilogue makes the whole experience worth the while - in terms of mind-blowing action scenes and more ...Significance -------------The message of the film mirror images the message of George W. Bush in the aftermath of the Twin Tower Collapse : Do everything in your power to make the responsible ones pay .  There seems to be no doubt about that - Israel government has been doing this for ages .What does bother me though , is the maltreatment of the reasons for which the terrorist's attack in the movie happened in the first place ; The movie fails to illuminate the issues that engaged the strong and violent actions properly . Instead , it concentrates for the most part in the vengeance campaign of Schwarzenegger , probably due to its definition as an action type motion picture .I think it wouldn't be too far fetched , these days , to expect more from a movie that practically recycles the material many of its predecessors have used in the past  . Otherwise , why would they want to make a new film based on old substance ? And why should viewers rush to watch it ? Is it only to make money by riding the success wave of summer action flicks ? Either way , the producers could have done better in terms of a balanced and well-explained story .In the end , the viewer has the feeling the Americans have done wrong in Columbia and those actions have made the terrorists what they are . Nonetheless , the viewer does not understand what exactly has been done wrong , why and what will be the after effects of the events that took place in the movie . I believe these things matter in the end of the day if you really stop to think about the movie's contribution to your knowledge about the origins of terrorism . After all , you have invested nearly 2 hours of your time seeing it and would definitely prefer to acquire something to remember .I guess you can't really expect such things from the usual action movies , at least not yet .Suitability ------------The producers went out of their skins in this section ; Contrary to what you'd expect , the gory images , shocking sights and violent acts were brought down to the minimum possible without damaging the plausibility of the film . This effort makes the movie approachable for children aged 8 and higher , in my opinion . That said , I do have to point out one extremely bad tasted , redundant and disgusting scene at which a man is murdered using a snake - I advise to skip it when seeing it coming . Its absence does not hamper the wholeness of the film and I believe it was kind of a whim of the director .Special features -----------------This sector consists of two key options .One includes a number of deleted scenes that add nothing to the movie . As with previous DVD releases , here you can find the shocking images that were appropriately removed  from the film .Another one presents comprehensive interviews with the cast and crew that are interesting to watch . You get to see the side of them that is about making something they see as important and meaningful , rather than just making money .Conclusion -----------The movie should have been more successful in the box office after the 9-11 terrorists' attacks  that had made it clear that Hollywood disaster movies can become a horrifying reality . All the same , it wasn't a hit , probably due to what it lacked in substance (as I suggested),  and also because people didn't seem to buy anymore the concept saying Schwarzenegger was the man to save the day - the passage of years did show its signs on him .All told , see it for pure entertainment - as it appears to be its only true aspiration .",3,Its only true aspiration : Entertainment

586573,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JKIO,Eric,"[4, 5]","Collateral Damage is Arnold Schwarzenegger's attempt to make an &quot;important&quot; movie. This is a picture that introduces quite a few controversial topics, mostly involving terrorism, how such behavior originates, and how it relates to the United States' government; ambitious stuff for an actor mostly known for delivering trademark quips and mowing down vast armies of extras. But in the end, Collateral Damage is little more than a high-gloss B-picture about a guy out for revenge. It's better than, say, any of the Death Wish films, but that's not exactly a shining compliment.Gordy Brewer (Schwarzenegger) is a Los Angeles firefighter (you can except a gratuitous opening scene where he performs bravely in the line of duty) with a beautiful wife and young son. But his ideal life is shattered the day a terrorist bomb kills his family. The culprit, a terrorist known only as &quot;The Wolf&quot; (Cliff Curtis), is reportedly in Colombia, so Brewer goes on a South American journey to exact his revenge. Not everything goes hunky-dory as Brewer has to face gun-toting guerillas/terrorists, and discovers that &quot;The Wolf&quot; has a wife and son of his own.As far as pure escapism goes, Collateral Damage is probably the least &quot;enjoyable&quot; of Schwarzenegger's films in years. Sure, it's better than Batman and Robin and Last Action Hero, but it's a grim thriller, almost intent on making sure the audience feels depressed from beginning to end (with only a glimmer of optimism in the final scene, which I actually found kind of touching).None of the topics Collateral Damage addresses is given much thought or development, but it's interesting enough to see them present in a Scwarzenegger thriller. While Cliff Curtis' villainous &quot;Wolf&quot; is hardly given enough characterization, his brief background is compelling and mildly thought-provoking. It doesn't necessarily make him sympathetic, as might have been the filmmakers' intent, but I at least didn't view him as a complete one-dimensional monster.Schwarzenegger attempts to genuinely act, and surprisingly, he's not bad. I could never really picture the guy emoting grief (even though he did so in End of Days) but he pulls it off to a reasonably believable extent. Don't expect any of his typical smirks or deadpan one-liners. They're almost completely absent here. As &quot;The Wolf's&quot; wife, Francesca Neri is solid and convincing, but sometimes feels like little more than a plot device.The story is mostly straightforward, with maybe one twist near the end that actually surprised me. Taken simply as a tale of revenge, the script isn't really that bad; hell, you even feel sorry for the protagonist. However, viewed as an attempt to examine terrorism, the film is mostly a failure (but not an entirely uninteresting one).Most bothersome about the film (and ultimately the reason why I just can't recommend Collateral Damage) are the action sequences, which lack the &quot;oomph&quot; and energy I've come to expect from a Schwarzenegger film. His previous movie, The Sixth Day, suffered because it lacked genuine gunfights. This time around, he doesn't even pick up a gun! I'd heard the NRA was breathing down his back, but this is just ridiculous (glad to say this disturbing trend was only temporary, as Terminator 3 featured more gunplay than Schwarzenegger's last four films combined).I've always been a fan of Schwarzenegger, who radiates a screen presence that most (inarguably superior) actors can't match on their best days. Collateral Damage is strictly for his fans, but don't be surprised if even they find themselves disappointed by this serious, humorless affair.** 1/2 out of *****",2,Not a very satisfying Arnold vehicle.,1064620800,"09 27, 2003",2003,3692,"['Collateral', 'Damage', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'attempt', 'make', 'quot', 'important', 'quot', 'movie', 'picture', 'quite', 'few', 'controversial', 'topics', 'mostly', 'involving', 'terrorism', 'how', 'such', 'behavior', 'originates', 'how', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'ambitious', 'stuff', 'actor', 'mostly', 'known', 'delivering', 'trademark', 'quips', 'mowing', 'down', 'vast', 'armies', 'extras', 'end', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'little', 'more', 'high-gloss', 'B-picture', 'guy', 'out', 'revenge', 'better', 'say', 'Death', 'Wish', 'films', 'not', 'exactly', 'shining', 'compliment.Gordy', 'Brewer', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'firefighter', 'can', 'except', 'gratuitous', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'bravely', 'line', 'duty', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'ideal', 'life', 'shattered', 'day', 'terrorist', 'bomb', 'family', 'culprit', 'terrorist', 'known', 'only', 'quot', 'Wolf', 'quot', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'reportedly', 'Colombia', 'so', 'Brewer', 'South', 'American', 'journey', 'exact', 'revenge', 'Not', 'everything', 'hunky-dory', 'Brewer', 'face', 'gun-toting', 'guerillas/terrorists', 'discovers', 'quot', 'Wolf', 'quot', 'wife', 'son', 'own.As', 'far', 'pure', 'escapism', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'probably', 'least', 'quot', 'enjoyable', 'quot', 'Schwarzenegger', 'films', 'years', 'Sure', 'better', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Last', 'Action', 'Hero', 'grim', 'thriller', 'almost', 'intent', 'making', 'sure', 'audience', 'feels', 'depressed', 'beginning', 'end', 'only', 'glimmer', 'optimism', 'final', 'scene', 'actually', 'found', 'kind', 'touching', '.None', 'topics', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'given', 'much', 'thought', 'development', 'interesting', 'enough', 'see', 'present', 'Scwarzenegger', 'thriller', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'villainous', 'quot', 'Wolf', 'quot', 'hardly', 'given', 'enough', 'characterization', 'brief', 'background', 'compelling', 'mildly', 'thought-provoking', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'sympathetic', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'filmmakers', 'intent', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'view', 'complete', 'one-dimensional', 'monster.Schwarzenegger', 'attempts', 'genuinely', 'act', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'bad', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'picture', 'guy', 'emoting', 'grief', 'even', 'did', 'so', 'End', 'Days', 'off', 'reasonably', 'believable', 'extent', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'typical', 'smirks', 'deadpan', 'one-liners', ""'re"", 'almost', 'completely', 'absent', 'here', 'quot', 'Wolf', 'quot', 'wife', 'Francesca', 'Neri', 'solid', 'convincing', 'sometimes', 'feels', 'little', 'more', 'plot', 'device.The', 'story', 'mostly', 'straightforward', 'maybe', 'one', 'twist', 'end', 'actually', 'surprised', 'Taken', 'simply', 'tale', 'revenge', 'script', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'hell', 'even', 'feel', 'sorry', 'protagonist', 'However', 'viewed', 'attempt', 'examine', 'terrorism', 'film', 'mostly', 'failure', 'not', 'entirely', 'uninteresting', 'one', '.Most', 'bothersome', 'film', 'ultimately', 'reason', 'why', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'are', 'action', 'sequences', 'lack', 'quot', 'quot', 'energy', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Schwarzenegger', 'film', 'previous', 'movie', 'Sixth', 'Day', 'suffered', 'lacked', 'genuine', 'gunfights', 'time', 'around', ""n't"", 'even', 'pick', 'up', 'gun', ""'d"", 'heard', 'NRA', 'was', 'breathing', 'down', 'back', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'glad', 'say', 'disturbing', 'trend', 'was', 'only', 'temporary', 'Terminator', '3', 'featured', 'more', 'gunplay', 'Schwarzenegger', 'last', 'four', 'films', 'combined', '.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Schwarzenegger', 'who', 'screen', 'presence', 'most', 'inarguably', 'superior', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'best', 'days', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'strictly', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'even', 'find', 'disappointed', 'serious', 'humorless', 'affair', '**', '1/2', '*****']",Collateral Damage VHS
586574,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKIO,"""flickjunkie""","[10, 13]","Anyone who goes to an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie expecting stimulating dialogue and insightful human drama is only kidding himself.  Like all of Schwarzenegger's films, this is formulaic and unoriginal with great action footage.  This is an unabashed Joe-Six-Pack guy flick.  On that level it succeeds nicely.Of course, this film can't be compared strictly with mindless action flicks, because it pretends to be an international thriller, and here it fails spectacularly.  It attempts to become philosophical, perfunctorily tossing in the idea that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, but the script doesn't dwell very long on this question and quickly proceeds to the next firework show.The incursion of fireman Gordy Brewer (Arnold) into the terrorist camp is so far past implausible that it is comical.  The G-men border on goofy.  And the idea that terrorists would detonate a bomb with a cell phone is just silly.  One wrong number (or telemarketing auto-dialer) and ""wham"", mission over.The twist ending is decent and at least it is not totally predictable, unlike the rest of the film.  Director Andrew Jackson, best known for his direction of ""The Fugitive"", keeps the film moving briskly and alternates effectively between action and suspense, without letting the improbability of the script act as an impediment.Arnold is still in great shape and athletic as ever despite his heart valve replacement.  I have to give him a lot of credit.  After that surgery a lot of actors would have been happy to take less demanding roles.  Arnold simply shrugs it off and continues where he left off.  One still must wonder how long he can keep playing this kind of role.This is a meld of his two favorite characters, action hero and tough guy with a big heart.  He gives his standard performance, which is not so much a matter of acting, but rather Arnold playing Arnold with someone else's name.  Cliff Curtis is sinister as the terrorist and Francesca Neri is lovely and believable as his duplicitous wife.By Arnold standards, this is not among his best.  By international thriller standards, it is brainless and inadequate.  As an action flick it is entertaining.  Overall, however, I can't give it much more than a 6/10.  Action and Arnold junkies will want to see it.  Others will probably want to pass.",3,Decent but formulaic action flick,1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,2325,"['Anyone', 'who', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'movie', 'expecting', 'stimulating', 'dialogue', 'insightful', 'human', 'drama', 'only', 'kidding', 'Schwarzenegger', 'films', 'formulaic', 'unoriginal', 'great', 'action', 'footage', 'unabashed', 'Joe-Six-Pack', 'guy', 'flick', 'level', 'nicely.Of', 'course', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'strictly', 'mindless', 'action', 'flicks', 'be', 'international', 'thriller', 'here', 'spectacularly', 'become', 'philosophical', 'perfunctorily', 'tossing', 'idea', 'one', 'man', 'terrorist', 'man', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'script', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'very', 'long', 'question', 'quickly', 'proceeds', 'next', 'firework', 'show.The', 'incursion', 'fireman', 'Gordy', 'Brewer', 'Arnold', 'terrorist', 'camp', 'so', 'far', 'past', 'implausible', 'comical', 'G-men', 'border', 'goofy', 'idea', 'would', 'detonate', 'bomb', 'cell', 'phone', 'just', 'silly', 'One', 'wrong', 'number', 'telemarketing', 'auto-dialer', 'wham', 'mission', 'over.The', 'twist', 'ending', 'decent', 'least', 'not', 'totally', 'predictable', 'rest', 'film', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'best', 'known', 'direction', 'Fugitive', 'film', 'moving', 'briskly', 'effectively', 'action', 'suspense', 'letting', 'improbability', 'script', 'act', 'impediment.Arnold', 'still', 'great', 'shape', 'athletic', 'ever', 'heart', 'valve', 'replacement', 'have', 'give', 'lot', 'credit', 'lot', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'take', 'less', 'demanding', 'roles', 'Arnold', 'simply', 'shrugs', 'off', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'One', 'still', 'must', 'wonder', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'keep', 'playing', 'kind', 'role.This', 'meld', 'two', 'favorite', 'characters', 'action', 'hero', 'tough', 'guy', 'big', 'heart', 'standard', 'performance', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'matter', 'acting', 'rather', 'Arnold', 'playing', 'Arnold', 'someone', 'else', 'name', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'sinister', 'terrorist', 'Francesca', 'Neri', 'lovely', 'believable', 'duplicitous', 'wife.By', 'Arnold', 'standards', 'not', 'best', 'international', 'thriller', 'standards', 'brainless', 'inadequate', 'action', 'flick', 'entertaining', 'Overall', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'more', '6/10', 'Action', 'Arnold', 'junkies', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'Others', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'pass']",Collateral Damage VHS
586575,A29QA79VLQGHY6,B00005JKIO,Flipper Campbell,"[0, 0]","The gale-force winds of 9/11 buffeted Andrew Davis' ""Collateral Damage,"" turning what might have been the routine release of an Arnold Schwarzenneger action film into a Hollywood sidebar to the young century's biggest news event. ""Damage"" had obvious, ironic links to the Sept. 11 attacks: The story opens with the heroics of a fireman (Schwarzenegger) in a building that's become a fiery hell for those trapped inside. The story then moves to a foreign terrorist's bombing of a U.S. building with high civilian fatalities (the so-called collateral damage). The film even opens with an aerial view of L.A.'s twin towers, the area targeted by the terrorist, a Colombian rebel.Warner Home Video has released &#8220;Collateral Damage&#8221; in widescreen only, with enhancement for 16:9 screens. Colors are delivered capably, with some rich greens in the jungle scenes and plenty of golden flash behind the many explosions and fires. Like the video, the 5.1 audio is up to studio standards, steady but unspectacular.The disc contains a semi-documentary, &#8220;The Hero in a New Era,&#8221; in which Davis and Schwarzenegger spin their film into a new-world perspective. (Those interviews were conducted before the February boxoffice release and apparently repurposed for the DVD.)In his director's commentary, Davis hints at politically correct changes made to the film and speaks of key scenes &#8220;surviving&#8221; post-Sept. 11 cuts. He points out one jungle scene in which the terrorist leader speaks to Schwarzenegger's fireman of his patriotic motivations. Instead of ending as planned on the rebel&#8217;s speech, a new fight sequence was tacked on re-emphasizing the terrorist's viciousness and &#8220;jazzing up Schwarzenegger&#8217;s rage.&#8221; Trying to present a terrorist&#8217;s viewpoint after the real-life attacks was &#8220;very delicate,&#8221; Davis says.&#8220;Damage&#8221; was, of course, panned by Schwarzenegger&#8217;s loyal opposition, but also had its share of positive reviews, most citing the film&#8217;s clever surprise ending.

Arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview  with Byron Allen.The movie is brilliant in showing what only what  the motivation behind terrorist attacks , but  the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter  these terrorist attacks.Basically, the FBI and CIA tell Gorden Brewer(ArnoldSchwarzennger) that they are working to bring down theterrorist who killed his family, when in fact they  have no good leads on the suspect.Rather, than sitting on his butt, and waiting for  the FBI to do something, Gordon takes the law into  his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family  by going into Columbia and getting ""The Wolf"" as the  terrorist is called.There is a great scene in which Gordon goes crazyand literally beats the hell out of a cold-blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are  pure garbage by saying their ""collateral damage"".  The radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims.  I loved this scene, because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead. He probably has no  family of his nose, and doesn't know the meaning of life, except to cover his own.Now you might say to yourself what's the difference betweenArnold's character (who is going for justice) and  the terrorist well here is the big difference from  Arnold himself:""The difference between me and you is thatI am only going to kill you"".Unbelievable action and twists at the end, that you're literally be on the edge of youre seat, and just when you think the movie is over.... it's  not !!!Director Andrew Davis not only gives a fact type  based movie based on Columbia, but also a factual  based type movie that deals with Terrorism and the  lessons that we must learn to see that things like this don't happen again.In fact, most people will remember the horrible case of WallStreet Reporter , Daniel Pearl, who was executed after theU.S. failed to meet the demands of the Middle East terrorist holding.The U.S. should have gone after these terrorists like the way Arnold does in this movie. However of course not all terroristsare MiddleEastern like some racist white bigots like this personnamed Nate Howard, an Army Ranger who has been harassing people says.

586581,A330XFRJKS3APU,B00005JKIO,Igor Biryukov,"[0, 2]","The problems with this film are many. First of all, it is an angry movie, in which American anger against Al Queda is being projected on Colombian left wing guerillas. Also 'Collateral Damage' is trying to repeat a success of another Arnold's flick 'True Lies'. Unfortunately with humorless, and zombie-like hero it is hardly possible. The movie main (and only) story is Arnold's quest to Columbia to destroy the guerilla leader who planted a bomb, which killed Arnold's family in the US. That's it. Unfortunately the film is not convincing even in fulfilling this simple task. The Columbian 'terrorists' look like they were just pulled out of Miami's nightclub. The plot is less than basic and dialogs are virtually non-existent. In 'True Lies' Arnold had a funny sidekick, in this movie there is no one to fill this void. When I was younger I used to enjoy films with Schwartzenegger, but lately I came to realization that there is nothing more sad than aging Arnold without his usual crisp one-liners. Particularly Arnold who takes himself too seriously. In short, 'Collateral Damage' is a less than a mediocre movie.

586583,A2TOX3E4WZ8BSQ,B00005JKIO,"Ivan K. Samuelson ""Bolski""","[24, 24]","Let's face it. In the 80's and early 90's, when you went to see an Arnold movie, what did you expect? He was some super-hero that was unstoppable. He wasn't your average, every-day Joe on the street. You KNEW he was going to do something so out-of-the-ordinary, but it was still so much fun to watch. The human element of his character was generally never taken into account or necessary.I think with End Of Days, we got to see Arnold play a character that was NOT superhuman. Many people (and critics) panned this movie. I loved it. I thought it was excellent and it allowed Arnold to show more emotions than he did in previous movies. Plus, he wasn't some superhero cop. He was actually a down-and-out drunk.Then came The 6th Day. Again, Arnold was allowed to show some emotions that came from having your life ripped away from you. In this case, he was a man who ran a legit transportation business, taking people up to the mountains to snow board down from.Now comes Collateral Damage. Arnold plays a firefighter, Gordy Brewer, who loses what is most precious to him: his wife and son. He loses them to a heinous terrorist attack from ""The Wolf"", a Columbian terrorist.The terrorist attack happens pretty early on, but you've already been given a glimpse of how Gordy lives his life: he loves his wife and son. In a split second, that is all ripped away from him. From that point on, you see Gordy slowly change from a person who saves lives to almost becoming the same type of person as the terrorist that took his family away.The action is NOT your typical Arnold action flick with outrageous stunts. In fact, I look at this movie as being on the same lines as The Fugitive, on both the drama and the action. In fact, Andrew Davis who directed The Fugitive directs this movie.The action is there because it is an integral part of the story. It's not there to be gratuitous. The action and violence is a by-product of what terrorism can cause. In this case, Gordy is seeking revenge on the death of his family, not too much different from the revenge that ""The Wolf"" is seeking for the supposed oppression the USA has put on Columbia. You see Gordy begin to realize this as the story unfolds.Throughout the story, Gordy must rely on his skills as a fireman. He has no special-ops training from the military. He doesn't have ready access to weapons. He must use his skills and his decision-making ability as a fireman to determine how he will go after ""The Wolf"". Unlike other Arnold movies, this time around the weapons are not easily accessible to him, and his character is not superhuman. It takes every ounce of his strength, will and determination to fight back, even when the terrorists beat him down. There is a twist in the story, which I won't spoil. However, it makes you cheer even more for Gordy.The DVD shows that Warner Bros. is working on adding more features to their releases. There are two featurettes that are both enlightening and entertaining. The ""Hero"" featurette definitely touches on how this movie is probably good for America after the horrible events of 9/11. They also explain why they held back on its release in the theatres after 9/11.Still, I wish the DVD had even more special features. There are additional scenes, cast and crew info, and one theatrical trailer. This is much better than what WB has brought out in the past. I still like how they packed The Matrix with a ton of stuff. Of course, how much extra stuff could you pack into a movie such as Collateral Damage?This is a worthy purchase. I didn't see it in the theatres, but I definitely love this movie. Is it Arnold's BEST movie? Probably not, but for a movie where he plays a very human character that must rely on skills as a fireman rather than some special combat training, I would say this is his BEST work with a character who must display a wide range of emotions. Arnold is still the king of action in my book. It's just that he's doing a DIFFERENT type of action, which I feel is good for him.

Brittman ""The Bottom Line""","[2, 4]","First of all, let me get something straight, Collateral Damage is a bad film and is not even on the same plane as Commando as action movies go in general. That being said, there are some flashes of the old Schwarzenegger in Collateral Damage. This time Arnold plays a city firefighter whose family is killed in a botched assasination attempt. Arnold watches it all unfold before his very eyes and becomes obsessed with finding ""El Lobo"" or The Wolf, the man responsible for killing his wife and son. Which leads him to the jungles of Columbia where he tries to hunt and kill El Lobo. There are some plot twists along the way and eventually Arnie finds his way back to the States. The film as a whole works much better when it is set in the United States. The flow is better, the story is clearer and the goal is obtainable. The sequences in Columbia are muddled and confusing. To make matters worse, needless characters are interspersed with little or no value to the story (ala John Leguizamo and John Tuturro). The ending was surprisingly satisfying which made me think back to the glory days of Commando, Terminator and Raw Deal. There is a whole lot less violence in this Schwarzenegger installment than most but it is used in effective spurts. Anyway, the ultimate payoff is there but the journey isn't worth the reward.

If anyone else other than Arnold was doing the role of Gordy in this movie, I wouldn't rank the film that high.  The DVD contains some extra features, all are fun to look at and is interesting.  The film is very good.  Many may not like it, but I do.  Arnold plays as a fireman the loves his family, and loses them to terrorists.  Arnold plays as an action star in a different way, and I think that most don't expect this from Arnold and don't rank this movie so high.  You can easily put yourself into Arnold's shoes in this movie, and see how victims of terrorist attacks truly feel.  You see Arnold come home and sit down very depressed as he lost what is most important to him, reporters call him wanting the story(they sound ever so excited to get it from him too) while you see Arnold angry and not wanting the calls.  Eventually, you see him go and take matters into his own hands, because the government wont.  This is where business picks up.  While the movie is not up to standard in most of Arnold's films, it still contains more story, suspense, twists, and wonderful acting.  Many can also relate to this by recent terrorist attacks in the U.S.  i.e. the 9/11 attacks, or the sniper attacks.

In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, a movie about terrorism on US soil would be seen as insensitive and inappropriate, but it would also have been a bad business decision.  It seemed that this movie was marred by the taint of association.  It was also marred by the fact that it was a fairly ordinary movie.Gordy Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a New York City firefighter.  His wife and son are killed in a terrorist attack and Brewer just happened to get a look at the man believed to be the terrorist.  The terrorist who pulled off the attack is a Columbian known only as The Wolf (Cliff Curtis).  The Wolf's agenda has to do with getting the Americans (and their interests) out of his country.  Unfortunately, other than agent Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas), the intended target of the attack, nobody in the government is willing to pursue the Wolf in his own country.  In fact, Brandt is being pulled off the case and reassigned.  Brewer decides to take matters into his own hands and finds a way into Columbia and starts to track down The Wolf.Have you seen Arnold's other action movies?  Are you a fan of the genre?

Arnold plays a real guy in this movie who has a real personality, unlike in some of his others.  He is also humbled a little more, and by that I mean he gets the crap beat out of him in some scenes, so don't expect a Commando re-hash.  I'd say that this also has alot of meaning compared to Arnold's other beat-em up shoot-em up flicks.  But, you won't be let down with the action that is also included in this film, it's just more meaningful.

586591,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00005JKIO,JRP,"[1, 2]","Now it's time for me to review a movie from either 10 years ago or 20 years ago. This review is for the underrated Arnold Schwarzengger movie Collateral Damage that was suppose to be released in 2001 but due to what went on at the time it was pushed back to 2002. It was made on a $85 million budget only made $78 miilion so it didn't do all that well at all. Directed by Andrew Davis he directed Underseige, Above The Law, Code of Silence & The Fugitive among many others. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Gordon Brewer, Cliff Curtis as Claudio Perrini, Francesca Neri as Selena, Elias Koteas as Peter Brandt & Tyler Posey as Mauro. The Story is  about LA Fire Fighter Gordon Brewer who is going to pick up his son cause his wife has to go into work. There's this cop writing up parking tickets Gordon tells him I'm just here to get my son the cop smiles at him. Then a blast goes off at TheColumbian Consulate they were targeting The Consulate Chief Peter Brandt Gordon's wife & son are killed in the blast. Gordon then goes into a depression & the actng he does in these scenes is very good. A tape comes out by this guy taking responsibility for what happend. He is known as The Wolf. Going through the camera images of that day he sees that identifies the cop he saw that day & he was identifed as Claudio Perrini a Columbiann Terrorist. 1 scene I liked is where Arnold is watchin TV there interviewing this Sympmatiser for the group. Gordon goes to those offices & beats that guy up & tears that place up. Meanwhile a Committee that is in charge of operations tells Brandt it's his fault what happend his actions caused what happend they'll handle The Columbian situation with peace talks. Brandt plans a secret mission to Claudio Perrini. Gordon goes into Columbia where he is targeted by rebels where he accidently dropped his passport so he becomes a wanted man fast. Gordon runs into this woman named Selena & her son. These guys are starting stuff with her he stands up for her & then Gordon is arrested. Brandt gets word that he is in the country & he is in j  a  i  l. You have this guy  named Armstrong who  & he is suppose to fix some equipment for this D  r  u  g Runner named Felix & Gordon wants this guys I  D so he can get in there. These men that work for Claudio come in attack thej  a  i  l Gordy grabs 1 of them & uses his saw to escape his cell Armstong want him to free him he will if he gives him his I  D so he gives him the cards to allow him to get into the facility & he breaks him out. He meets Felix played by the underrated John Leguizamo he goes to fix a machine. He riggs the machine with explosives. 1 of Claudio's men tell him that he saw him & where he is at then he is killed in a twisted way. His men go to the facility to capture him but some explosions go off Felix's is killed cause 1 of Claudio's men think that he was behind it. Gordon hides under vehicle which takes him to Claudio's headquarters he drops an elxplosive into a gas tank gets out of there. He sees Selena & her son going down the street he starts yelling at her to prevent them from being in the blast. That alerts Claudio Gordon is captured. Selena as it turns out is Claudio's wife she tells him not to kill Gordon cause he saved her. She tells Gordon that Claudio is planning an attack on D  C. You also have Brandt who has found out where Claudio is at  but had left Selena helps Gordon escape Brandt launches a full scale atack on the compound. It turns out that Brandt was using Gordon's captivity as a way to take out Claudio's cartel. Gordon tells Brant that he wants to go back to The US & there coming too. So you get back to D  C  Selena tells them that he has placed a bomb in a train station which was found by a that was used as cover his real target is The  F  B  I building so Claudio goes by a Motorcycle through some tunnels. Then Selena has to go to the bathroom she tells her son to come with her but he doesn't want to go she does some kind of hand signal that makes Gordon think that's the exact way how Claudio did it in 1 of his videos & I can admit that when I 1st saw this movie that suprised me. Selena kills the lady that accompanied her to the rest r  o  om & takes her I  D. She gets to the elevator Some people try to get the doors opened Brandt is killed by her. Gordon figures otu that there is bomb in her k  iids toy. he goes & throws it out the window. He goes back after her where she made her way to the parking garage & escapes on a motorcycle. Gordon closes the gates where they can't escape the card she tok off that lady doesn't work.. He knows they will be back he cuts some gas lines. Selena shoots at him that sets off the gas & causes a big explosion. Gordon jumps in a doorway. Somehow they surived he fights both of them off he tosses her into a control panel throws an a  x into Claudio. Outside he leaves with the boy & it ends with Gordon preventing the biggest attacke in The U  S. Collateral Damage is a very underrated movie. Andrew Davis does a good job directing. Arnold Schwarzenegger does a very good job. Cliff Curtis wasn't bad. Francesca Neri wasn't bad. Eilas Koteas does a good job. The kid wasn't annoying. All around a solid movie.

Being that this movie is about terrorism (not by the middle east but Columbia) It didn't get much attention, I would assume, on purpose. But I picked this up in my local blockbuster the other day to see if Arnold still has what it takes to make a great action movie. The results:Collateral Damage is a pretty entertaining film about terrorism and bombings in the US. Arnold's family is killed as casualties for one of these bombings and Arnold goes on a rampage for justice. The movie works pretty wellfor what it is...a &quot;blowing everything up movie&quot; But it's pretty fun. Arnold is pretty god in it taking on a somehwat dramatic role of a hero and the supporting cast is acceptable and believable. What really made this movie good, is the twist at the end. A well thought out twist that makes you interested in the movie all over again. I won't spoil it and give it away but I must admit, I was surprised...and I like that in movies.The reason I am giving it three stars, is because it is a little unbelievable at times and the script could have had a little more time spent on it, I think.

Was it worth the wait, you betcha!!! This movie has suspense, plot, interesting characters and enough action to satify the diehard fans of  Arnold. The villian is very sinister as he killed his wife and kid. One should know to never do that to his family, or they shall pay dearly at the hands of this superhero. You got to watch the snake scene and the scene where Arnold does the Mike Tyson routine, which i watch over and over again. This is how you do it Mike. The visual landscape of Columbia is remarkable and very realistic. Can one survive after falling from the top of a waterfall? I wouldn't want to find out.The movie was directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed 'The Fugitive' starring Harrison Ford. He knows how to direct action/suspense movies to a tee, but i'm kinda wondering why there are so many great deleted scenes that was left out. Maybe it was too long which is why you should rent the DVD version to see those scenes too. There is a reason why both Ebert & Roeper gave this movie 'Two Thumbs Up!'. Once you see it, you will know why.

I was prepared for the ""Arnold"" movie, (""Collateral Damage"") to be terrible, since it was panned by moviegoers and critics alike.Amazingly, I thought it was a very good movie...oh, it wasn't ""True Lies"", by any stretch of the imagination, and Arnold may never have another movie nearly as good. He's a little long in the tooth for action heroes and here he's cast, believably, as a fireman who cannot let politics and our nation's uneasy relationship with Colombia intervene to stop him from revenge.  He's met a Colombian killer....just before the man blew up a NYC building, killing Arnold's (Gordy Brewer in the film) wife and child.Andrew Davis, the director, spins a good yarn, and the cast, beyond Arnold, is convincing, with excellent actors playing the guerrilla leader, his wife, and his adopted child. John Turturro, John Leguizamo and Joe Spano, all gifted actors, are given too few lines...but this is all about Gordy and his quest.His ability to succeed, given his everyman status, is a little farfetched, but you are drawn into the tale as the action switches from NYC to Colombia, and back to Washington.The director does a good job of highlighting Gordy's essential belief in humanity. Arnold has come a long way in being able to reflect this on film, and not just be a tough guy or a comedian (both of which he does well!)as he finds himself fighting for his life. Violence comes through both from the guerillas, and from the CIA, once again portrayed as bitchy and bumbling.

586605,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00005JKIO,Mike,"[20, 24]","""Collateral Damage"" (2002)The released date for this film was delayed after the tragic September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre. I had heard quite a bit about the movie and was generally looking forward to it because I enjoyed The 6th Day, Arnie's last effort. I didn't expect it to be a life-changing experience to free our fear from terrorists after the horrific events of 9/11, but I expected to be entertained.This movie far succeeded my expectations. It's more intelligent, more entertaining, more interesting, more original, more well-acted than I could ever expect. Of course one thing that did disappoint me was once again Arnie went completely soft and the motivations are all good-willed and stuff, he's not a cool bad[boy] anymore! However he still makes for a decent watch, also giving in a great performance as Gordon, our main man. Schwarzenegger was able to portray the tense expressions and great action stunts as well expect from him. But he also turned in what I found to be somewhat of a more subtle performance than usually, he had some great shock and dramatic acting scenes, and I think he could be really more than an action actor with big muscles, even if that's what we'll remember him as.As for the rest of the cast, they turn in pretty decent performances. Cliff Curtis once again playing the bad guy is generally threatening. Francesca Neri (last year's underused Hannibal star) does pretty good as the mum caught in the middle. John Turturro and John Leguizamo were great comic relief and entertained me a lot. But Leguizamo's drug-making scenes were totally unnecessary to the whole plot of the movie.This is yet another one of those twist-in-the-end movies (much like last year's The 6th Day, Arnie's box office hit) and it completely surprised me. The twist does have a couple of plot holes, but overall it worked. I was very pleased with the way it explained the twist, it made me understand the movie a whole lot better. Sometimes it doesn't make such perfect sense though.The action sequences in this movie are entertaining, and very well filmed. They also have a certain cleverness to them (they're not just there because they are) and each of them delivers in a big way. They are also very well directed and the director of photography catches the atmosphere and important shots. The editing is very good (the fire especially looked very real) and the music used the perfect instruments (refreshingly different sounds!) to portray the excitement.All that said, I felt the movie was a little too long at about 2 hours, and it had some unnecessary scenes (Elias Koteas wasn't really essential, and neither was the whole John Leguizamo drug back-story). However, this movie remained an entertaining, enjoyable, smart and thought-provoking dramatic actioner.MY GRADE: B+",4,Surprisingly a very good action movie.,1023235200,"06 5, 2002",2002,2809,"['Collateral', 'Damage', '2002', 'released', 'date', 'film', 'was', 'delayed', 'tragic', 'September', '11', 'attacks', 'World', 'Trade', 'Centre', 'had', 'heard', 'quite', 'bit', 'movie', 'was', 'generally', 'looking', 'forward', 'enjoyed', '6th', 'Day', 'Arnie', 'last', 'effort', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'life-changing', 'experience', 'free', 'fear', 'terrorists', 'horrific', 'events', '9/11', 'expected', 'be', 'entertained.This', 'movie', 'far', 'succeeded', 'expectations', 'more', 'intelligent', 'more', 'entertaining', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'original', 'more', 'well-acted', 'could', 'ever', 'expect', 'course', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'disappoint', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'Arnie', 'went', 'completely', 'soft', 'motivations', 'are', 'good-willed', 'stuff', 'not', 'cool', 'bad', '[', 'boy', ']', 'anymore', 'However', 'still', 'decent', 'watch', 'also', 'giving', 'great', 'performance', 'Gordon', 'main', 'man', 'Schwarzenegger', 'was', 'able', 'portray', 'tense', 'expressions', 'great', 'action', 'stunts', 'well', 'expect', 'also', 'turned', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'somewhat', 'more', 'subtle', 'performance', 'usually', 'had', 'great', 'shock', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'scenes', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'more', 'action', 'actor', 'big', 'muscles', 'even', 'what', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'as.As', 'rest', 'cast', 'turn', 'pretty', 'decent', 'performances', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'once', 'again', 'playing', 'bad', 'guy', 'generally', 'threatening', 'Francesca', 'Neri', 'last', 'year', 'underused', 'Hannibal', 'star', 'pretty', 'good', 'mum', 'caught', 'middle', 'John', 'Turturro', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'were', 'great', 'comic', 'relief', 'entertained', 'lot', 'Leguizamo', 'drug-making', 'scenes', 'were', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'whole', 'plot', 'movie.This', 'yet', 'one', 'twist-in-the-end', 'movies', 'much', 'last', 'year', '6th', 'Day', 'Arnie', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'completely', 'surprised', 'twist', 'have', 'couple', 'plot', 'holes', 'overall', 'worked', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'way', 'explained', 'twist', 'made', 'understand', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', ""n't"", 'make', 'such', 'perfect', 'sense', 'though.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'are', 'entertaining', 'very', 'well', 'filmed', 'also', 'have', 'certain', 'cleverness', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'there', 'are', 'delivers', 'big', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'director', 'photography', 'catches', 'atmosphere', 'important', 'shots', 'editing', 'very', 'good', 'fire', 'especially', 'looked', 'very', 'real', 'music', 'used', 'perfect', 'instruments', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'sounds', 'portray', 'excitement.All', 'said', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'about', '2', 'hours', 'had', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'essential', 'was', 'whole', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'drug', 'back-story', 'However', 'movie', 'remained', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'smart', 'thought-provoking', 'dramatic', 'actioner.MY', 'GRADE', 'B+']",Collateral Damage VHS
586606,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B00005JKIO,Mike,"[3, 3]","Collateral Damage is basically Arnold'sDie Hard...although his character Gordy Brewer is a firefighter, NOT a New York Cop like Bruce Willis' John McClane...so that automatically makes it a different movie, right? A movie with a lone firefighter standing up to terrorists versus a lone police officer standing up to terrorists is hardly the same movie at all, right?The politics of the movie are ham-fisted and cartoonish, and the release date was delayed due to the events of September 11, 2001. It's essentially a fantasy that preceded actual events, and there was talk of not releasing the film at all...but investors want a return on their investment, so it was released in 2002.The main problems with this film are:1). When a movie hinges on a ""major plot twist,"" it makes it difficult to enjoy the movie a second time, because while you're watching the opening credits, you are already dealing with a ""spoiler."" There's no ""payoff""...you got that when you watched it the first time.2). The ""major plot twist"" is every bit as ham-fisted as the movie's politics, and if you don't see it coming from a mile away, the chances are excellent that you don't watch many movies.3). In real life, when the lone firefighter follows you halfway around the world to seek vengeance and thoroughly disrupts your drug dealing operation, you don't toy with him. You pretty much eliminate him within moments of recognizing him. Firefighter Gordy is toyed with again and again and again because if the terrorists didn't toy with him, this would have ended up being a short subject, not a feature film.4). The plot gimmick of having Schwarzenegger tell the bad guy that he's going to kill him and then having the bad guy ask ""When are you going to kill me"" or ""I thought you said you were going to kill me"" (or some other variant) has been used in other Schwarzenegger films, and other action films that were not Schwarzenegger films, so there's a real slap-your-forehead ""here we go again"" moment when firefighter Gordy informs the bad guy that he's going to kill him.5). John Leguizamo's character is not believable, and this is far from his finest acting moment.6). In terms of movie terrorists, if Alan Rickman's ""Hans Gruber"" from ""Die Hard"" is a ""10"" on a ""10 Scale,"" the terrorist husband and wife couple in ""Collateral Damage"" falls somewhere around 2.5 on a 10 Scale. That's also my rating for the film, but since we can only give 2 or 3 stars, not 2.5, I'm OK with the unintended extra half-star bounce.You'll find the requisite explosions (and another plot twist in which the husband and wife are incinerated in a fireball while chasing a running lone firefighter Gordy on a motorcycle...WHO KNEW that among his other  talents, Schwarzenegger has the ability to outrun motorcycles...OR ARE THEY?)...but this is one of those movies in which the filmmakers played to the cheap seats. It's not exactly a ""so bad it's good"" movies...it's more on the side of ""so bad it's just bad""...but if you like cheesy ""Midnight Movie"" types of bad movies, this might be right up your alley.

586607,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00005JKIO,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 3]","At the time of the release of ""Collateral Damage"", director Andrew Davis had a pretty good career behind him: between 1985 and 2002, he had done good things for the careers of Chuck Norris (Code of Silence), Steven Seagal (Under Siege), Harrison Ford (The Fugitive), Michael Douglas (A Perfect Murder), and had even directed Tommy Lee Jones to his Oscar. Needless to say, the man knows how to bring out a lot in movie stars, so there were few reservations about his teaming up with the number-one action hero of our time, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Surprisingly enough, the film flopped and threatened to end Schwarzenegger's acting career on a low point beforeTerminator 3: Rise of the Machinescame out. Folks tend to write off the film's lack of success due to the fact of it being released only five months after the real-life terrorist attacks of 9/11, but I consider it a simple matter of Schwarzenegger having played too many characters, having been in too many life-threatening situations, and having acted under too many good directors for Davis to have any kind of moving effect on his style at that point.Oh, and it's not too great of a movie to begin with.The story: Gordy Brewer (Schwarzenegger) is a fireman whose family is killed in an explosion orchestrated by Colombian terrorist Claudio Perrini (Cliff Curtis,Sunshine). When the US government fails to dispense justice, Brewer travels to South America to exact personal revenge on the terrorist.For the most part, the plot is as straightforward as abovementioned, but like many Davis films, it gets political as the film progresses...and this is where I first begin to find fault with the film. Forgive me if I seem less-than-patriotic in this statement, but I am thoroughly tired of the one-dimensional and overgeneralized approach that Hollywood has taken towards terrorism for the past decades: for the most part, ""Collateral Damage"" is a throwback to the days in which we liked to assume that all terrorism was fueled by blind, unexplained, and unwarranted hatred towards America by faceless devils who hid their horns under berets or turbans. The ideology that American lives are more precious than those of people in foreign countries is strongly enforced here, with only the lamest of attempt of political correctness there to try and balance out the ethics.As far as action goes, the movie is fairly bland: Schwarzenegger doesn't even fire a gun as he flees from bad guys throughout the jungle and avoids missiles. As a matter of fact, besides throwing a few grenades and engaging in a couple of gritty brawls, he doesn't get in on the action at all, which is limited to run-of-the-mill shootouts and explosions; this qualifies the film as more of a thriller than an action title - something I wish I could have known before purchasing it. Then again, ten minutes into the movie, it didn't really surprise me too much: Schwarzenegger looks much older and greyer than he did as recently asThe 6th Day, and were it not for his return to form in ""Terminator 3"", I would have figured that he was over the hill by the time this film rolled around. Also, there are no witty one-liners or much humor of any kind to fall back on, leaving Schwarzenegger looking less vengeful and more tired than he ever has.The rest of the cast performs fairly well, though they comprise a less-than-original ensemble. Cliff Curtis is merely decent as your stereotypical Latin military-type, but luckily his prominently-featured wife (Francesca Neri, ""Hannibal"") is there to cover as a deeper and more complex character. Elias Koteas (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") has an unadmirable role as an underhanded government agent, but John Leguizamo (Executive Decision) and John Turturro (O Brother, Where Art Thou?) have likable parts to keep the movie afloat during their screentime.I wish there was more to say, but ""Collateral Damage"" may just be the most toothless Schwarzenegger vehicle ever. I really don't know how the Arnold/Davis team went wrong, but it's almost for sure that fans ofThe Terminatorwill not be fans of ""Collateral"". Schwarzenegger fans will probably already have this as a part of their collection, but non- die-hards should treat this a rental the first time around.",2,"""Damage"" to Arnold's Career",1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,4243,"['time', 'release', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Davis', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'career', '1985', '2002', 'had', 'done', 'good', 'things', 'careers', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Code', 'Silence', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Siege', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Fugitive', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Murder', 'had', 'even', 'directed', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Oscar', 'Needless', 'say', 'man', 'how', 'bring', 'out', 'lot', 'movie', 'stars', 'were', 'few', 'reservations', 'teaming', 'up', 'number-one', 'action', 'hero', 'time', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'film', 'flopped', 'threatened', 'end', 'Schwarzenegger', 'acting', 'career', 'low', 'point', 'beforeTerminator', '3', 'Rise', 'Machinescame', 'out', 'Folks', 'tend', 'write', 'off', 'film', 'lack', 'success', 'due', 'fact', 'being', 'released', 'only', 'five', 'months', 'real-life', 'terrorist', 'attacks', '9/11', 'consider', 'simple', 'matter', 'Schwarzenegger', 'having', 'played', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'having', 'been', 'too', 'many', 'life-threatening', 'situations', 'having', 'acted', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'directors', 'Davis', 'have', 'kind', 'moving', 'effect', 'style', 'point.Oh', 'not', 'too', 'great', 'movie', 'begin', 'with.The', 'story', 'Gordy', 'Brewer', 'Schwarzenegger', 'fireman', 'family', 'killed', 'explosion', 'orchestrated', 'Colombian', 'terrorist', 'Claudio', 'Perrini', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Sunshine', 'When', 'US', 'government', 'dispense', 'justice', 'Brewer', 'South', 'America', 'exact', 'personal', 'revenge', 'terrorist.For', 'most', 'part', 'plot', 'as', 'straightforward', 'abovementioned', 'many', 'Davis', 'films', 'political', 'film', 'where', 'first', 'begin', 'find', 'fault', 'film', 'Forgive', 'seem', 'less-than-patriotic', 'statement', 'am', 'thoroughly', 'tired', 'one-dimensional', 'overgeneralized', 'approach', 'Hollywood', 'taken', 'towards', 'terrorism', 'past', 'decades', 'most', 'part', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'throwback', 'days', 'liked', 'assume', 'terrorism', 'was', 'fueled', 'blind', 'unexplained', 'unwarranted', 'hatred', 'towards', 'America', 'faceless', 'devils', 'who', 'hid', 'horns', 'berets', 'turbans', 'ideology', 'American', 'lives', 'are', 'more', 'precious', 'people', 'foreign', 'countries', 'strongly', 'enforced', 'here', 'only', 'lamest', 'attempt', 'political', 'correctness', 'there', 'try', 'balance', 'out', 'ethics.As', 'far', 'action', 'movie', 'fairly', 'bland', 'Schwarzenegger', ""n't"", 'even', 'fire', 'gun', 'bad', 'guys', 'jungle', 'avoids', 'missiles', 'matter', 'fact', 'throwing', 'few', 'grenades', 'engaging', 'couple', 'gritty', 'brawls', ""n't"", 'get', 'action', 'limited', 'run-of-the-mill', 'shootouts', 'explosions', 'film', 'more', 'thriller', 'action', 'title', 'something', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'purchasing', 'Then', 'again', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'surprise', 'too', 'much', 'Schwarzenegger', 'much', 'older', 'greyer', 'did', 'as', 'recently', '6th', 'Day', 'were', 'not', 'return', 'form', 'Terminator', '3', 'would', 'have', 'figured', 'was', 'hill', 'time', 'film', 'rolled', 'around', 'Also', 'are', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'much', 'humor', 'kind', 'fall', 'back', 'leaving', 'Schwarzenegger', 'looking', 'less', 'vengeful', 'more', 'tired', 'ever', 'has.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'performs', 'fairly', 'well', 'comprise', 'less-than-original', 'ensemble', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'merely', 'decent', 'stereotypical', 'Latin', 'military-type', 'luckily', 'prominently-featured', 'wife', 'Francesca', 'Neri', 'Hannibal', 'there', 'cover', 'deeper', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'Curious', 'Case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'unadmirable', 'role', 'underhanded', 'government', 'agent', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Executive', 'Decision', 'John', 'Turturro', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'have', 'likable', 'parts', 'keep', 'movie', 'afloat', 'screentime.I', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'say', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'most', 'toothless', 'Schwarzenegger', 'vehicle', 'ever', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Arnold/Davis', 'team', 'went', 'wrong', 'almost', 'sure', 'ofThe', 'Terminatorwill', 'not', 'be', 'fans', 'Collateral', 'Schwarzenegger', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'part', 'collection', 'non-', 'die-hards', 'should', 'treat', 'rental', 'first', 'time', 'around']",Collateral Damage VHS

The movie is bad and despite marketeers' efforts to relate the contents of this dreck with the serious and life-changing terrorism of September 11, this movie lacks in every category imaginable.I am an Arnold fan, who isn't?  I don't expect to see an especially deep and thought-provoking flick.  As an Arnold fan, I expect to see a lot of action, a lot of laughs, and lots of baddies getting blowed up.  As a movie fan, I expect the story to have a plot, have character development of at least the main characters, have peripheral threads somehow tie into the main plot with some sort of conclusion, and to have some semblance of a story to tell.Collateral Damage lacks in just about every area.  The action is lukewarm.  The explosions are many, but they never seem big enough to kill the baddies nor are they timed well to help the story along.  It's almost like the director decided that there needs to be X number of explosions, so he threw them in whenever it seemed convenient.Arnold's humor is lacking severely.  Maybe it's because he just saw his family blown up in an explosion, but c'mon, this is an Arnold movie; we need those dumb puns and kindergarten jokes.  The closest we ever come to anything funny is when Arnold bites the ear off of a terrorist in an obvious reference to the Mike Tyson ear-biting incident.  It wasn't funny for Holyfield, and it isn't funny for the audience.To its credit, Collateral Damage does feature a lot of blown up bad guys.  Arnold the fireman is somehow able to fashion grenades from engine parts, but such unbelievable things can be overlooked as they are pretty standard for an Arnold movie.Plot?  What plot?  Oh you mean, Arnold's family is blown up so he has to go to Columbia and kill the terrorists?  I'm sure there are other movies made with less plot than this, but this is an Arnold vehicle so we can put up with this lack of plot if only the action were good enough.  Unfortunately the action lacks substance and the plot is just silly without it.John Turturro is given barely a minute of screen time and his character is introduced and then forgotten.  If you want to bring in a character, please figure out a way to weave that character into the main plot somehow!Same with John Leguizamo's drug making capitalist character.  His story arc goes something like &quot;Hey Arnold, how are you?  I'm a rapper.  I need you to fix these machines while I make cocaine to sell to America.  I'm not such a bad guy.  Oh, my Columbian overlords killed me.&quot;  Why couldn't he have been used better by the writer?  It doesn't take much imagination to think of much better ways to use him.This movie was disappointing in so many ways.

I was hoping for at least a typical Arnold movie, but this one falls way short of the mark.

I've seen a lot of Arnold's movies, some great, some not so great.  This one is definitely near the top.Arnold plays a firefighter whose wife and son were killed by terrorists.  This is actually a multidimensional character.  He is enraged by the killing of his wife and son and wants revenge, tries to be a killer as well, yet at his core, he remains a man who wants to save lives.  I was reminded of how good an actor Arnold can be.Yes, some parts of the plot are a stretch, but frankly, no more fantastical than the story of a kid from Austria becoming a huge Hollywood star, then California governor, all after getting through the door by way of bodybuilding.  This movie came out around the time Arnold began to let his political aspirations be known, and I can't help but think it's politics that colors many of the negative views expressed here.  Also, this movie definitely took a hit at the box office given its subject matter, following so closely on the heals of 9-11.If you're on the fence with this one, don't get turned off by some of the poor reviews here.

Columbian drug cartel as he seeks revenge for the horrible death of his wife and young son.It's a well made film,despite the fact it was slighly re-edited in keeping with the 9-11 attacks that occurred just before it was to be released in Oct.of 2001.Instead it was pushed back to Feb/02,released and was considered a flop because it didn't make back its' initial investment.This is unfortunate as the film I think deserved better.But,as they say,timing is everything;it either works for you or against you.The plot involves fireman Brewer meeting his wife and son at a plaza.He is just yards away when an explosion goes off killing his family.Inconsolable he retreats into his home after he is released from hospital having overcome injuries he himself sustained during the bombing.He vows revenge and starts probing into the bombing and supplies government officials with info which they ignore.Frustrated but armed with much information and a bit of under the table help,he flies to Columbia to kill the Columbian drug lord responsible for the death of his family.It is a long journey fraught with difficulties but he eventually makes it.One night he plants a bomb,but just before it is to go off a woman and a young boy happen on the scene and he saves them.He is subsequently captured and held prisoner.It turns out the woman and boy he saved is the wife of the terrorist he seeks.He convinces the women to bring her child with her,with him,back to Washington to testify against her husband.They make it back and are at FBI headquarters being questioned.When the woman excuses herself to go to the washroom and gestures for her boy to come with her he refuses.However this tweaks something in Brewers mind and it turns out he is right.She is in fact the terrorist who planned the explosion in L.A.which killed Brewers family and as she escapes to the basement Brewer is in hot pursuit as a bomb goes off in the building.In a huge maintenance tunnel the womans husband is waiting on a motorcycle and both speed off to escape.Closing all escape doors the pair are forced to return to Brewer who is waiting for them.In a final pitched battle Brewer does them both in;one by electrocution and the other by an axe to the chest.The film ends as Brewer carries the terrorists son out of the FBI building.Well supported our Ahhnold breezes through this thriller quite well as he gives up with alot of great action sequences.There are some brief scenes with John Leguizamo and John Turturo and New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis plays the suspected Columbian terrorist Claudio wonderfully;he being known from the Xena/Hercules series.The film has few slow spots and is well edited to keep the pace at a fairly even level.Technically the film is in its 1:77:1 a/r and the picture is clear but it can be a little grainy at times.In conclusion a worthwhile film by Schwarzenegger with a fast moving plot and good action scenes.A man who loses his family,gets his revenge and gains a partially new family in the end.Violent,but we're with him all the way.Recommended.",4,Ahhnold gets the revenge he seeks!,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,3189,"['Collateral',

586626,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JKIO,Robert Moore,"[2, 2]","While this is not one of Schwarzenegger's best films, in many ways it is one of his most interesting characters.  Unlike most of his other films, in which he persistently portrays a man who is a master warrior, adept at employing a huge range of weapons, in this one he plays a regular person who has embarked on a mission of revenge.  The fact that he is not, for a change, a super warrior enhances his character's appeal.  He may be a bit larger than most everyday individuals, but one would never mistake him for any of his other action roles.The plot overall is not nearly as exciting or tension-packed as one hopes for in an action film, though the ending was one of the better parts of the film.The cast is mildly uneven.  For the most part, the actors portraying the bad guys are all slightly more exciting than cardboard cutouts.  On the other hand, there are some good performers in supporting roles, like John Leguizamo and John Turturro.  One of my favorite actors in movies today, Elias Koteas, has a significant role, but unfortunately it is not one that takes advantage of his considerable skill (for that, see either his role as a strip club DJ in EXOTICA or his performance as a captain concerned for the welfare of his troops in THE THIN RED LINE).One thing truly bothered me in this film, and in most other films where there are over-the-top oppressive bad guys.  One member of the bad guy's army messes up, and is punished without mercy by having his mouth pried open and a poisonous snake slid down his throat.  This is the same kind of intolerance to mistakes that we have seen in a thousand other movies, and everyone of them is extremely implausible.  From Darth Vader to Goldfinger, make even a small mistake, and you get to die a spectacularly cruel death.  How devastating to morale this kind of nonsense would be!  As if any group could long be held together by absolute terror.  Even the Gestapo in Hitler's Germany was highly tolerant of the mistakes of its members.  Of course, in films, this kind of intolerance functions as a method of dehumanizing the bad guys, making them into one-dimensional entities.My other problem with the bad guys is political.  In most countries where there have been political problems of one sort or another, the problem has come far more often from the political Right than the Left.  Furthermore, the Roman Catholic Church in many cases is on the side of the Left.  But in this film, the bad guys are Leftists (notice the pictures of Lenin and Che on the walls of one of the huts), which says much more about perceptions in the United States than realities in South and Central America.Still, overall, not a bad film.  I am giving it four stars, but this is one of those cases where I would like to make it three and a half.",4,Slightly different action role for Schwarzenegger,1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,2787,"['not', 'one', 'Schwarzenegger', 'best', 'films', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'persistently', 'man', 'who', 'master', 'warrior', 'adept', 'employing', 'huge', 'range', 'weapons', 'one', 'regular', 'person', 'who', 'embarked', 'mission', 'revenge', 'fact', 'not', 'change', 'super', 'warrior', 'character', 'appeal', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'larger', 'most', 'everyday', 'individuals', 'one', 'would', 'never', 'mistake', 'other', 'action', 'roles.The', 'plot', 'overall', 'not', 'nearly', 'exciting', 'tension-packed', 'one', 'action', 'film', 'ending', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'parts', 'film.The', 'cast', 'mildly', 'uneven', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'portraying', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'slightly', 'more', 'exciting', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'good', 'performers', 'supporting', 'roles', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'John', 'Turturro', 'One', 'favorite', 'actors', 'movies', 'today', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'significant', 'role', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'one', 'advantage', 'considerable', 'skill', 'see', 'role', 'strip', 'club', 'DJ', 'EXOTICA', 'performance', 'captain', 'concerned', 'welfare', 'troops', 'THE', 'THIN', 'RED', 'LINE', '.One', 'thing', 'truly', 'bothered', 'film', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'where', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'oppressive', 'bad', 'guys', 'One', 'member', 'bad', 'guy', 'army', 'up', 'punished', 'mercy', 'having', 'mouth', 'pried', 'open', 'poisonous', 'snake', 'slid', 'down', 'throat', 'same', 'kind', 'intolerance', 'mistakes', 'have', 'seen', 'thousand', 'other', 'movies', 'everyone', 'extremely', 'implausible', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'Goldfinger', 'make', 'even', 'small', 'mistake', 'get', 'die', 'spectacularly', 'cruel', 'death', 'How', 'devastating', 'morale', 'kind', 'nonsense', 'would', 'be', 'group', 'could', 'long', 'be', 'held', 'together', 'absolute', 'terror', 'Even', 'Gestapo', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'was', 'highly', 'tolerant', 'mistakes', 'members', 'course', 'films', 'kind', 'intolerance', 'functions', 'method', 'dehumanizing', 'bad', 'guys', 'making', 'one-dimensional', 'entities.My', 'other', 'problem', 'bad', 'guys', 'political', 'most', 'countries', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'political', 'problems', 'one', 'sort', 'problem', 'come', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'political', 'Right', 'Left', 'Furthermore', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'many', 'cases', 'side', 'Left', 'film', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'Leftists', 'pictures', 'Lenin', 'Che', 'walls', 'one', 'huts', 'much', 'more', 'perceptions', 'United', 'States', 'realities', 'South', 'Central', 'America.Still', 'overall', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'am', 'giving', 'four', 'stars', 'one', 'cases', 'where', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'three', 'half']",Collateral Damage VHS
586627,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JKIO,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 2]","Okay, this is one those flicks that got pushed off because of 9-11, though it's actually so underwhelming, you come off wondering whether those execs should have just thrown caution to the winds and released it anyway (they could always blame when it flopped).  Actually ""damage"" is so fear of risk, it's incredible to think that they sold it to Schwarzennagar (did I spell that right?).  Our hero plays Gordon Brewer, a fireman whose son and wife are killed by a terrorist blast left by a Colombian guerilla known as ""El Lobo"" (""The Wolf"", not ""The Sheriff"").  His wife and kid weren't the targets of the blast - just unfortunate but hardly unexpected ""collateral damage"".  A firefighter by training, Brewer turns vengeance-minded assassin, determined to get into civil-war-torn Colombia, penetrate a huge province held by the Guerrillas, and take-out El Lobo himself.  A novice, the script allows for Gordon to make mistakes that quickly alert both El Lobo and a CIA-backed army to his presence in Columbia.  The script also fleshes out an irony that makes Brewer more valuable alive than dead to the guerrillas (who will ransom him once they inevitably capture him) and more priceless as a corpse to the Yancqui (another gringo corpse will remind American leaders that you can't negotiate with terrorists).  Otherwise, the flick is pretty much a disappointment - it's not visually exciting, there are no incredible stunts or scenes, and no memorable catch-phrases (a scene in which Brewer, in chains, meets El Lobo face-to-face for the first time only reminds us of a much better scene in ""True Lies"").  There's a self-serving CIA officer played by Elias Koteas who would have been great either as a guy who was Brewer's reluctant sidekick or a guy we knew would easily sacrifice him (instead, the character just remains two-steps behind; there's a great exchange between the two shortly near the end of the movie, but it only hints at how much more fun it could have been).  In the end, Koteas's character is one more the script purposelessly wastes (along with Johns Leguizamo and Turtorro).  The Wolf himself is no fun - he's young and undefined.

It's a good thing he changed careers. A few more stinkers like this and he wouldn't continue to work in Hollywood. Yes this is another of the movies that belong in the Lesser Schwarzenegger pile right under the 6th Day and Batman & Robin. Brain Damage is a better title for this movie because you'll need to be in order to enjoy this movie.Arnold plays surprise-a guy named John (again-don't these action heroes have any other name other than Jack or John? No Daves, Earls, or Lyles around to kick butt?) who is a firefighter who saw his family murdered by terrorists. He decides with no military training or skills to go into the Amazon rain forest to seek out the terrorists and kill them. The film tries to be complex, but goes nowhere fast. I wound up checking out of this movie around the hour mark and came back to see the ending only because nothing else was on TV. True to formula Jack kills the bad guys after spouting the clever clich&eacute;.Watching Collateral damage will give you brain damage. Avoid this waste of time at all costs.

Schwarzenegger's casting as Gordon Brewer is absurd. Of all Hollywood's middle-aged openers, he's the worst choice for the role. It specifically requires a man who is NOT a large-than-life, gun-toting action hero. This story would be gripping if it was about a Joe Average going after terrorists - Jeff Bridges, Kurt Russell, Harrison Ford, Michael Douglas, Mel Gibson or even Tim Robbins could have capably played the part. But with big Arnie at the helm, we're left wondering why he didn't pack one of those guns from ""Predator"" and why he isn't doing more. Secondly, the deleted scenes on the DVD show that plenty of good material has been excised: material that not only improves the storytelling but lends it a realistic moral ambiguity. As released, the film leaves you in no doubt that the Colombians are evil and the Americans are saints. But as written and shot, the case wasn't quite so clear. Presumably the cuts were made in response to audience previews or executive nerves. A braver studio might have bitten the bullet and released it as it stood, but who am I to argue with Warner Bros? It wasn't my money they were gambling with. And after all, that's what it's all about, right? Heaven forbid that a film might actually help us UNDERSTAND terrorism rather than just exploit it for disposable summer entertainment. Thankfully, a few movies pitching more insightful views of terror and/or America's international interests such as ""Three Kings"", ""The Siege"" and ""Arlington Road"" snuck under the radar well before September 11 and are still available in uncorrupted form.

586642,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JKIO,trebe,"[4, 5]","Suffering from a major case of bad timing, Collateral Damage, Arnold Schwarzenegger&#146;s action adventure film, was set to be released, when 911 occurred.  Due to certain plot similarities that somewhat reflected real life events, the film&#146;s producers delayed its release.  When the film finally appeared in theaters, it swiftly slid into oblivion.While this film never had a fair shot in its theatrical release, there are some reasons to give it chance in the home video market.  It presents a slightly different view of Arnold, from what we have seen in the past.  This time he is fireman, Gordon Brewer, whose wife and child are killed, in a terrorist strike against the Columbian embassy in Los Angeles.  They are part of the &#147;collateral damage&#148;.  It is a bit of a switch to see Schwarzenegger in shock, mourning the loss of his loved ones.  But soon, he is back on familiar ground, sneaking into Columbia, set on killing the terrorist responsible for the explosion.Th film has an interesting cast.  Versatile actor Cliff Curtis, from New Zealand, plays the terrorist leader Claudio Perrini, nicknamed &#147;El Lobo&#148; (the Wolf).  He has been seen in many recent films, including &#147;Training Day&#148;, &#147;Blow&#148; and &#147;Three Kings&#148;, in various ethnic roles.  Here again, he is very good.  Despite playing an utterly ruthless man, he somehow does not inspire intense feelings of hate.  His unique method for dealing with incompetence, involving a snake, is not for the squeamish.  The Wolf is at home in the jungles of Columbia, and in the streets of an American city.  A most dangerous man.Italian actress, Francesca Neri, plays Perrini&#146;s wife, Selena.  Her presence, along with her son Mauro, serve as reminders to Brewer, of the family he has lost.  Selena makes several critical moral choices, that shows her determination to do what she feels she must.  Brief, but noteworthy performances, are turned in by two others.  John Leguizamo plays a loudmouthed heroin grower, who has dreams of a musical career.  And John Turturro, steals the few scenes he appears in, as a jumpy, hustler type, mechanic.The action scenes in Columbia, while sprinkling in some elements of reality, are mostly standard Hollywood productions.  There is no mistaking this for John Sayles&#146;, &#147;Men With Guns&#148;.  Plenty of gunplay and explosions all around, as Brewer finds he has &#147;bitten off&#148; more than he can chew, taking on the guerillas in their home grounds.  Arnold&#146;s computer graphic assisted ride through the rapids, and falls of a river is a quick thrill.  Schwarzenegger should stand out among the natives, but he almost never seems the object of attention or curiosity.  When the Wolf leaves Columbia, to launch another terrorist attack, this time in Washington D.C., the scene returns to America for the finale.There are a few twists and turns, with deception and duplicity on all sides.  The finish is standard Hollywood fiction, and full of excess and implausibility.  Collateral Damage is a change of pace for Schwarzenegger, but perhaps not as significant as the producers claim.  The action is solid, with some creative special effects.  The performances, by the principal cast, are enjoyable for the most part.  And we almost reach the end, before Arnold delivers some one liners.  Gramme Revell's score adds positively to the mix.  The DVD features a standard making of featurette, as well as an informative, low key commentary by Director Andrew Davis.  Like all of us, Arnold is getting older, but he is still a capable action hero.",3,"Still doin&#146; some &#147;Damage""...",1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,3605,"['Suffering', 'major', 'case', 'bad', 'timing', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', '146', 's', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', 'was', 'set', 'be', 'released', 'when', '911', 'occurred', 'Due', 'certain', 'plot', 'similarities', 'somewhat', 'reflected', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'film', '146', 's', 'producers', 'delayed', 'release', 'When', 'film', 'finally', 'appeared', 'theaters', 'swiftly', 'slid', 'film', 'never', 'had', 'fair', 'shot', 'theatrical', 'release', 'are', 'reasons', 'give', 'chance', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'slightly', 'different', 'view', 'Arnold', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'past', 'time', 'fireman', 'Gordon', 'Brewer', 'wife', 'child', 'are', 'killed', 'terrorist', 'strike', 'Columbian', 'embassy', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'are', 'part', '147', 'collateral', 'damage', '148', 'bit', 'switch', 'see', 'Schwarzenegger', 'shock', 'mourning', 'loss', 'loved', 'ones', 'soon', 'back', 'familiar', 'ground', 'sneaking', 'Columbia', 'set', 'killing', 'terrorist', 'responsible', 'explosion.Th', 'film', 'interesting', 'cast', 'Versatile', 'actor', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'New', 'Zealand', 'terrorist', 'leader', 'Claudio', 'Perrini', 'nicknamed', '147', 'El', 'Lobo', '148', 'Wolf', 'been', 'seen', 'many', 'recent', 'films', 'including', '147', 'Training', 'Day', '148', '147', 'Blow', '148', '147', 'Three', 'Kings', '148', 'various', 'ethnic', 'roles', 'Here', 'again', 'very', 'good', 'playing', 'utterly', 'ruthless', 'man', 'somehow', 'not', 'inspire', 'intense', 'feelings', 'hate', 'unique', 'method', 'dealing', 'incompetence', 'involving', 'snake', 'not', 'squeamish', 'Wolf', 'home', 'jungles', 'Columbia', 'streets', 'American', 'city', 'most', 'dangerous', 'man.Italian', 'actress', 'Francesca', 'Neri', 'Perrini', '146', 's', 'wife', 'Selena', 'presence', 'son', 'Mauro', 'serve', 'reminders', 'Brewer', 'family', 'lost', 'Selena', 'several', 'critical', 'moral', 'choices', 'determination', 'do', 'what', 'must', 'Brief', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'are', 'turned', 'two', 'others', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'loudmouthed', 'heroin', 'grower', 'who', 'dreams', 'musical', 'career', 'John', 'Turturro', 'few', 'scenes', 'jumpy', 'hustler', 'type', 'mechanic.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'Columbia', 'sprinkling', 'elements', 'reality', 'are', 'mostly', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'mistaking', 'John', 'Sayles', '146', '147', 'Men', 'Guns', '148', 'Plenty', 'gunplay', 'explosions', 'around', 'Brewer', '147', 'bitten', 'off', '148', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'taking', 'guerillas', 'home', 'grounds', 'Arnold', '146', 's', 'computer', 'graphic', 'assisted', 'ride', 'rapids', 'falls', 'river', 'quick', 'thrill', 'Schwarzenegger', 'should', 'stand', 'out', 'natives', 'almost', 'never', 'object', 'attention', 'curiosity', 'When', 'Wolf', 'Columbia', 'launch', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'time', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'scene', 'returns', 'America', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'deception', 'duplicity', 'sides', 'finish', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fiction', 'full', 'excess', 'implausibility', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'change', 'pace', 'Schwarzenegger', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'significant', 'producers', 'claim', 'action', 'solid', 'creative', 'special', 'effects', 'performances', 'principal', 'cast', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'part', 'almost', 'reach', 'end', 'Arnold', 'one', 'liners', 'Gramme', 'Revell', 'score', 'positively', 'mix', 'DVD', 'standard', 'making', 'featurette', 'as', 'well', 'informative', 'low', 'key', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Davis', 'Arnold', 'getting', 'older', 'still', 'capable', 'action', 'hero']",Collateral Damage VHS

Partially it's due to the post 9/11 re-editing that played down the innocent civilian casualties in Arnie's quest for vengeance on Colombia terrorists, but more because it seems that the script was probably rewritten a few too many times to accommodate the Austrian Oak. Some swipes at the duplicity and counterproductive nature of American intervention in South America survive as the war hits home, but the film is ultimately content to turn its revolutionaries into cardboard fanatics (not to mention throwing in a ridiculous scene with a snake in case we don't get the point) and go for the big bangs.
