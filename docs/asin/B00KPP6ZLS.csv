1697360,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00KPP6ZLS,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[11, 14]","Preface: This review is writted with the finale episode left.For the last four years, there has been an on-again/off-again discussion about making Fox's groundbreaking action thriller 24 into a feature film. That idea kept falling apart though, and it's no wonder. The whole conceit of 24 is that it's a thriller that plays out in real time, and for a two-hour feature film, that just doesn't work. However, fans of the show, like myself, held out hope that we would see the death-defying adventures of former Federal Agent Jack Bauer (played with gusto each of the show's previous eight seasons with gusto by Kiefer Sutherland) once again in some form. Well, we got at least half of our wish. Show creators Howard Gordon and Robert Cochran, as well as executive producers Manny Coto, David Fury and Sutherland himself have created 24: LIVE ANOTHER DAY, a 12-hour/12-episode mini series which brings Jack Bauer back for half of his usual day, but with more than likely, the same amount of mayhem, chaos, destruction and thrills.While the show embraces the format, it doesn't do it immediately. For the first six minutes of the first episode, we find ourselves in London, where a CIA strike team has found a target of high value that they are looking to capture. This target is Jack Bauer. If you remember the events of the final full season of 24, Jack had been branded a traitor when he was looking to assassinate the Russian President (for reasons that are too numerous to list here), and had been helped to escape by his only living friend, the intrepid Chloe O'Brian (reprised here by the irrepressible Mary Lynn Rasjkub), and for the last four years, Jack has been on the run and under the radar. Once Bauer is captured, though, the show begins the real-time format. As per usual, Jack has his reasons for being in London on this particular day, and has his reasons for the CIA allowing his capture. The president of this season is James Heller (reprised by William Devane), the former secretary of defense and father to the one-time love of Jack's life Audrey Raines (reprised by Kim Raver), and the president, his chief of staff Mark Boudreau (Tate Donovan), who is now Audrey's husband, have come to London to make sure that the Prime Minister (Stephen Fry) and Parliament will allow the US to renew its lease on British soil for one of the bases of their drone program. However, President Heller is in danger, according to Jack. He has found out that Chloe is in CIA custody for being part of a Wikileaks-type of hacktivist group called Open Cell, and he's allowed his capture so that he may escape and free her as well so that he can enlist her help to find out what the threat is. Thrown into the mix as well is London CIA station chief Steve Navarro (Benjamin Bratt), Open Cell's figurehead Adrian Cross (Michael Wincott), as well as CIA agent Alex Morgan (Yvonne Strahovski), who is about to be transferred back to the States in disgrace, but she thinks much along the same lines as Bauer does. The threatening party consists of the family of Margot Al-Harazi (GAME OF THRONES' Michelle Fairley), who is hijacking US drones via the ultimate maguffin to attack London to retaliate for her fundamentalist husband's assassination by a Heller-ordered drone strike. Jack's past with Heller and Audrey also come into play as he seems to, once again, be the only person capable enough of stopping this destruction. So lives will be lost, sacrifices will be made, and lives will be shattered whether by the violence of the day, or the duplicity of certain characters that has remained a constant throughout 24's history. As the season comes to a close, though, a wonderful and shocking appearance by a very compelling past villain in the show's history returns to haunt Jack, Chloe and Audrey, and it makes the stakes even more personal and with even greater stakes.Make no mistake; despite the fact that it's only 12 hours long, this is VERY much 24. Everything you love about the show is here, but also everything you don't love about the show is here as well. The action beats are great, the tension is palpable, and the performances are, by and large, very good. However, the show does get extremely bogged down in its various subplots: Morgan's ex-husband's sale of secrets to China right under her nose, Heller's secret health condition, Mark's back-channel dealings with the Russians who want Bauer's head, Chloe's recent tragedy, Margot's dealings with her daughter Simone (Emily Berrington), and that the reason for Heller's visit is to RENEW A LEASE, which apparently is so important, it will be the most important part of his presidency. Really? They couldn't have thought of anything more... I don't know... seemingly important? The show's political overtones are present as well, and couldn't be more current in regards to our country's current drone policy. The show, however, is smart enough to neither approve nor condemn, but allow the viewer to be the judge.From a writing standpoint, the show has never been particularly strong in dialogue, with the exceptions of Jack and Chloe usually having the only really good lines, and that's not really different here. The characters are mostly, again also par for the course, pretty one-dimensional, until something actually happens. The actors do their best with them, such as Fairley's work with the one-note Margot, Fry as the stuffed-shirt PM, and Wincott with the initially bland Cross. The weakest link (once again) is Raver as Audrey, who has always been the least interesting or compelling of Jack's love interests. If this were a full season, they might have more time to dedicate to showing how the trauma that Jack is at least partially responsible for (back from season six, easily the show's weakest) might be brought to bear in her character, but she seems to exist either as a bland plot device or as a potential prize for Jack to win back at the expense of Mark, who is the man who had to help Audrey pick of the pieces of her life that Jack shattered. The show's brightest new star is definitely Strahovski, who is another strong female companion to Jack, smart and determined and ready to bring as much badassery as her male counterparts, much as Renee Walker was in the final season, but has a strong enough definition of character to stand out on her own. But again, it's Sutherland and Rajskub who walk away with the best moments and the best work.24: LIVE ANOTHER DAY is certainly a worthy addition to the 24 franchise, because it brought everything back for presumably one last go, and while it might not reach the heights or some of the other seasons, it's enough to keep you in suspense and keep you guessing where it will go and how it will end.",4,THE HOUR OF THE POWER OF BAUER HAS RETURNED FOR ONE MORE (HALF) DAY.,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,6737,"['Preface', 'review', 'writted', 'finale', 'episode', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'been',

Without it the serial shows may never have been done, and when 24 is in its prime it can be topped by none. Season 8 ended in a way that we have seen before with Jack wanted by everyone from shore to shore. It was not really that great of an ending at all. So I'm glad it came back for one last call.Season 9 picks up with him in London hiding out. Then he seems unable to speak or even shout. Of course it is 24 after all. So certain things are there you would expect at your hall. There is another mole that they take for a stroll. At least this one isn't jut a worker bee. So it was a bit of a different spree. Everyone ignores Jack, then when he is right, they come crawling back.The characters they decided to bring back have been great. Most of the new ones grow on you at their own rate. Although Kate is pretty much a female Jack Bauer wannabe. Nothing different about her from him than her anatomy. Seems kind of pointless to do. But she can be fun to watch too.All old storylines seem to be coming into play. The Chinese, The Russians and Audrey during the day. Of course they still ignore some that they just let go and instead bring back Cheng to tie up that past bread crumb. Everything does seem to be coming together as another bad day Jack seems to be able to weather.If you are looking for something new, you won't find it with season 9 of 24 that comes due. But if you are looking for 24 that goes back to its glory days of excellent compared to just good, that you will find at your hood. They do hit the same old plot points once again. But it is always great to have new episodes of 24 on at ones den.",5,"24 Comes Back Strong, It's Been Too Long!",1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,1767,"['Spoilers', 'ahead', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'go', 'back', 'bed.One', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'grace', 'TV', '24', 'set', 'standard', 'many', 'shows', 'now', 'see', 'serial', 'shows', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'when', '24', 'prime', 'can', 'be', 'topped', 'none', 'Season', '8', 'ended', 'way', 'have', 'seen', 'Jack', 'wanted', 'everyone', 'shore', 'shore', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'great', 'ending', ""'m"", 'glad', 'came', 'back', 'one', 'last', 'call.Season', '9', 'up', 'London', 'hiding', 'out', 'Then', 'unable', 'speak', 'even', 'shout', 'course', '24', 'So', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'there', 'would', 'expect', 'hall', 'mole', 'take', 'stroll', 'least', 'one', ""n't"", 'jut', 'worker', 'bee', 'was', 'bit', 'different', 'spree', 'Everyone', 'Jack', 'then', 'when', 'right', 'come', 'crawling', 'back.The', 'characters', 'decided', 'bring', 'back', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Most', 'new', 'ones', 'grow', 'own', 'rate', 'Kate', 'pretty', 'much', 'female', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'wannabe', 'Nothing', 'different', 'anatomy', 'Seems', 'kind', 'pointless', 'do', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'too.All', 'old', 'storylines', 'seem', 'be', 'coming', 'play', 'Chinese', 'Russians', 'Audrey', 'day', 'course', 'still', 'ignore', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'instead', 'bring', 'back', 'Cheng', 'tie', 'up', 'past', 'bread', 'crumb', 'Everything', 'seem', 'be', 'coming', 'together', 'bad', 'day', 'Jack', 'be', 'able', 'weather.If', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'season', '9', '24', 'due', 'are', 'looking', '24', 'back', 'glory', 'days', 'excellent', 'compared', 'just', 'good', 'will', 'find', 'hood', 'do', 'hit', 'same', 'old', 'plot', 'points', 'once', 'again', 'always', 'great', 'have', 'new', 'episodes', '24', 'ones', 'den']",N/A

The two hour premiere was awesome then the action kind of slows down and they get into storyline mode until episode 6 and that is the action starts to pick up again. Episode 8 is kind of a filler but does serve its purpose and Episodes 9-12 are straight up 24 action with Jack kicking butt and not worrying about taking names. I won't spoil anything for anybody but I do believe this is the best season they have had since Season 5 and is a strong candidate for top 3 of all the seasons. William Devane is excellent as president and the best since David Palmer in my opinion. If you are a 24 fan, you will not be disappointed.
