1383958,A34BUK6Q132V75,B00437IE8G,Agnes,"[2, 2]","This is the second book-to-movie adaptation that I've seen and enjoyed this year.  The other was Flipped, based on Wendelin van Draanen's book by the same title.  When I was younger, my older sister and I both adored Beverly Cleary's books (Ramona series, Ralph S. Mouse books, etc.).  I have to say, this is a wonderful and satisfactory adaptation.Ramona Quimby has a rather vivid, wonderful imagination, something that doesn't bode too well for her in school (Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy plays her teacher) and which often lands her in some rather sticky situations.  Later, the viewer discovers that her parents are having some financial issues that only get worse after her father loses his job due to downsizing.  Yet, Ramona remains unfazed and is determined to save her family by taking on some jobs of her own while her father searches for a new position.  We get some side romances between Beezus (aka Beatrice, played by Selena Gomez) and her childhood friend Henry (this one is a really minor side-plot) and between Bea (Ramona's aunt) and Hobart (Josh Duhamel's pretty much great in any role he does, so his addition adds some nice comedic moments to the movie).This is a very enjoyable movie and is also very clean.  It is rare to have a kid's movie these days that is actually rated-G (the majority are PG), and it is even rarer to have a kid's movie that doesn't have a single dirty joke.  And the cleanliness of jokes and situations does not detract from viewer enjoyment at all in this case.  Everyone in my family who watched this movie ended up loving it.  If you have a kid or teen who loves Selena Gomez, this would be a great movie for them to watch.  This could also be an excellent opportunity to get kids interested in reading (if they like the movie, they might want to try some of Beverly Cleary's books).Ramona's antics are funny and cute.  There are some sweet family moments and watching this movie left me in a good mood afterwards (had been having a bad day).  This movie is appropriate for any age; there's really nothing bad about it, and I highly recommend it.  Overall: this is another example of a book-to-movie adaptation done right.  Plus, this shows that you can make a movie funny and family-friendly without having any dirty jokes whatsoever.(A note: the title for my review has more to do with something the character's say in the movie)",4,Extraordinary,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,2380,"['second', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'year', 'other', 'was', 'Flipped', 'based', 'Wendelin', 'van', 'Draanen', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'older', 'sister', 'adored', 'Beverly', 'Cleary', 'books', 'Ramona', 'series', 'Ralph', 'S.', 'Mouse', 'books', 'etc.', 'have', 'say', 'wonderful', 'satisfactory', 'adaptation.Ramona', 'Quimby', 'rather', 'vivid', 'wonderful', 'imagination', 'something', ""n't"", 'bode', 'too', 'well', 'school', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'teacher', 'often', 'rather', 'sticky', 'situations', 'Later', 'viewer', 'parents', 'are', 'having', 'financial', 'issues', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'father', 'job', 'due', 'downsizing', 'Ramona', 'unfazed', 'determined', 'save', 'family', 'taking', 'jobs', 'own', 'father', 'searches', 'new', 'position', 'get', 'side', 'romances', 'Beezus', 'aka', 'Beatrice', 'played', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Henry', 'one', 'really', 'minor', 'side-plot', 'Bea', 'Ramona', 'aunt', 'Hobart', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'pretty', 'much', 'great', 'role', 'addition', 'nice', 'comedic', 'moments', 'movie', '.This', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'clean', 'rare', 'have', 'kid', 'movie', 'days', 'actually', 'rated-G', 'majority', 'are', 'PG', 'even', 'rarer', 'have', 'kid', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'single', 'dirty', 'joke', 'cleanliness', 'jokes', 'situations', 'not', 'detract', 'viewer', 'enjoyment', 'case', 'Everyone', 'family', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'loving', 'have', 'kid', 'teen', 'who', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'excellent', 'opportunity', 'get', 'kids', 'interested', 'reading', 'like', 'movie', 'might', 'want', 'try', 'Beverly', 'Cleary', 'books', '.Ramona', 'antics', 'are', 'funny', 'cute', 'are', 'sweet', 'family', 'moments', 'watching', 'movie', 'left', 'good', 'mood', 'afterwards', 'had', 'been', 'having', 'bad', 'day', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'age', 'really', 'nothing', 'bad', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Overall', 'example', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptation', 'done', 'right', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'funny', 'family-friendly', 'having', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'whatsoever', 'note', 'title', 'review', 'more', 'do', 'something', 'character', 'say', 'movie']",N/A

It's the fact that despite all the horrible luck Romona has, she hardly ever lets it show or lets it get her down to the point of being negative.  She's alays optimistic, encouraging, approachable and friendly.Oh yeah, she gets bad grades at school but that's because her mind is always elsewhere.  She's actually really smart- much smarter than both of her older sisters in fact.  Speaking of which... she spends quite a bit of time with her older sisters, especially the one played by Selena Gomez (named Beezus).  They're more like friends (well, except when the day comes when they both get their own bedrooms- THEN the tension begins!)If you have a child who's constantly hard on him or herself and gives up easily and is afraid to try, let the little girl played by Romona be an example how you handle crappy situations whenever they come.  Handle them by looking into the future and being positive.There's a curly-haired toity hoity classmate that Romona LOVES to pick on!  Let's be honest, you're glad someone who thinks she's so perfect gets a little reality check by having her hair pulled on among other things.  Come on admit it!Anyway, Romona finds herself involved in numerous obstacles.  She wants to feed the baby... something goes wrong.  She wants to show her classmates an egg trick at the lunchroom... something goes wrong.  She wants to operate her own lemonade stand... something goes wrong.  She wants to wash and clean her sisters boyfriends truck because of a &100 offer... you guessed it (in this case something goes REALLY wrong, haha).The main storyline is that Romona doesn't want to move away when it's discovered her father has a job offer in a faraway place.  Throughout the movie this main concept comes back and haunts Romona.It's a light comedy, and it's a pretty good one too.

1383965,AMX6OVOXFDL5Q,B00437IE8G,Ben Masters,"[0, 0]","The Blu-Ray of ""Ramona and Beezus"" is the same great film about Ramona Quimby and her big sister Beezus and their parents in their home in Portland, OR (with Vancouver as a stand-in for Portland), with Joey King in the same superb performance as before, but this edition has some new features that are included exclusively on the Blu-Ray (the features from the original DVD edition are also included):--Deleted scenes: The original DVD edition had four deleted scenes; the Blu-Ray has three more deletions, for a total of 7.--A Day in the Life of Joey King: This 5-min. feature is an insider's view of what a normal day was like for Joey King, star of ""Ramona and Beezus,"" who went by ""Pickle"" on the walkie-talkie. It shows her at makeup, in one of her homeschooling sessions (she was focused on fractions in this one), and in the process of shooting the playground rings scene with Jason Spevack (who played her friend Howie Kemp); the school scenes were shot at an actual school. One thing that I was surprised to learn about her is that she has cat allergies WRT shooting the scenes w/Picky-Picky.--Selena and Joey Audition Footage: Two scenes of Selena Gomez and Joey King in rehearsal. One is when Beezus wanted to die after Ramona embarrassed her at the lemonade stand; the other is when Ramona is opening up her lemonade stand. These were the rough cuts of the actual scenes. It should be noted that Joey was not in the hairstyle that she would have in the film as Ramona.--Fox Movie Channel Presents Life After Film School: Director Elizabeth Allen is questioned by three film students in a 22-min. interview.The other features that were carried over from the DVD edition include:--a 3-min. gag reel;--""My Ramona with Author Beverly Cleary,"" in which the author talks about how Ramona came to be popular and some of the stars of the film talk about what the books meant to them (4 min.+);--""Show and Tell Film School"" (7 min.), where director Elizabeth Allen and star Joey King present tips on how to make your own film, with a bit of an insider's view of how they made ""Ramona"";--and the original theatrical trailer.In addition to the features, the film is presented in HD on this Blu-Ray edition, and has English and French audio, and English and Spanish subtitles (the same languages as on the DVD edition). The Blu-Ray comes in a 3-pack with a copy of the original DVD edition and a digital copy for portable devices. The artwork for the Blu-Ray disc is the same as the original DVD edition, with the included DVD having somewhat different artwork (this one had Selena and Joey in a field of flowers, apparently); the digital copy shows Ramona hanging upside down from the ""Z"" and ""S"" in the title. The three discs are in a clear blue rounded square case, with the Blu-Ray and DVD on a hinged flipper, and the digital copy on its own on the right-hand inside of the case.The menu for the BD is essentially the same as for the DVD, but the options are on tiny scraps of paper.In short, whether you get this combo Blu-Ray/DVD/digital copy, or you get the original DVD edition by itself, I think that you'll be treating yourself to what I believe is one of the best films I've ever seen, with one of the greatest performances ever from a juvenile actress by the name of Joey King.",5,Ramona Blu-Ray,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,3290,"['Blu-Ray', 'Ramona', 'Beezus', 'same', 'great', 'film', 'Ramona', 'Quimby', 'big', 'sister', 'Beezus', 'parents', 'home', 'Portland', 'OR', 'Vancouver', 'stand-in', 'Portland', 'Joey', 'King', 'same', 'superb', 'performance', 'before', 'edition', 'new', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'exclusively', 'Blu-Ray', 'features', 'original', 'DVD', 'edition', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'original', 'DVD', 'edition', 'had', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Blu-Ray', 'three', 'more', 'deletions', 'total', '7.', 'Day', 'Life', 'Joey', 'King', '5-min', 'feature', 'insider', 'view', 'what', 'normal', 'day', 'was', 'Joey', 'King', 'star', 'Ramona', 'Beezus', 'who', 'went', 'Pickle', 'walkie-talkie', 'makeup', 'one', 'homeschooling', 'sessions', 'was', 'focused', 'fractions', 'one', 'process', 'shooting', 'playground', 'scene', 'Jason', 'Spevack', 'who', 'played', 'friend', 'Howie', 'Kemp', 'school', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'actual', 'school', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'cat', 'allergies', 'WRT', 'shooting', 'scenes', 'w/Picky-Picky.', 'Selena', 'Joey', 'Audition', 'Footage', 'Two', 'scenes', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'Joey', 'King', 'rehearsal', 'One', 'when', 'Beezus', 'wanted', 'die', 'Ramona', 'embarrassed', 'lemonade', 'stand', 'other', 'when', 'Ramona', 'opening', 'up', 'lemonade', 'stand', 'were', 'rough', 'cuts', 'actual', 'scenes', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Joey', 'was', 'not', 'hairstyle', 'would', 'have', 'film', 'Ramona.', 'Fox', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'Presents', 'Life', 'Film', 'School', 'Director', 'Elizabeth', 'Allen', 'questioned', 'three', 'film', 'students', '22-min', 'interview.The', 'other', 'features', 'were', 'carried', 'DVD', 'edition', 'include', '3-min', 'gag', 'reel', 'Ramona', 'Author', 'Beverly', 'Cleary', 'author', 'talks', 'how', 'Ramona', 'came', 'be', 'popular', 'stars', 'film', 'talk', 'what', 'books', 'meant', '4', 'min.+', 'Show', 'Tell', 'Film', 'School', '7', 'min', 'where', 'director', 'Elizabeth', 'Allen', 'star', 'Joey', 'King', 'present', 'tips', 'how', 'make', 'own', 'film', 'bit', 'insider', 'view', 'how', 'made', 'Ramona', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer.In', 'addition', 'features', 'film', 'presented', 'HD', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'English', 'French', 'audio', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'same', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Blu-Ray', '3-pack', 'copy', 'original', 'DVD', 'edition', 'digital', 'copy', 'portable', 'devices', 'artwork', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'same', 'original', 'DVD', 'edition', 'included', 'DVD', 'having', 'somewhat', 'different', 'artwork', 'one', 'had', 'Selena', 'Joey', 'field', 'flowers', 'apparently', 'digital', 'copy', 'shows', 'Ramona', 'hanging', 'upside', 'down', 'Z', 'S', 'title', 'three', 'discs', 'are', 'clear', 'blue', 'rounded', 'square', 'case', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'hinged', 'flipper', 'digital', 'copy', 'own', 'right-hand', 'inside', 'case.The', 'menu', 'BD', 'essentially', 'same', 'DVD', 'options', 'are', 'tiny', 'scraps', 'paper.In', 'short', 'get', 'combo', 'Blu-Ray/DVD/digital', 'copy', 'get', 'original', 'DVD', 'edition', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'treating', 'what', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'ever', 'juvenile', 'actress', 'name', 'Joey', 'King']",N/A

1383968,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00437IE8G,Chris Pandolfi,"[59, 64]","Ramona Quimby doesn't mean to cause trouble. If anything, her intentions are purely honorable. It's just that ... well, she's nine years old; she has a lot of energy, her imagination is vivid, and her goals are ambitious. The unfortunate side effect is that she makes her life and the lives of those around her chaotic. Her teenage sister, named Beatrice but saddled with the unwanted nickname of Beezus, thinks she's a pest. Her teacher, so stiffly matter-of-fact, doesn't like it when she makes up her own words, even if they happen to sound a lot more fun. Her mother, busy at home with an infant daughter, would love it if she would learn to control her enthusiasm. Even her father, so pleasant and involved with his children, would sometimes like to see her grow up just a little bit. The only one who seems to understand Ramona is her aunt Bea. Of course, it's easy to understand a rambunctious child when you don't have to live with her every day.""Ramona and Beezus,"" adapted from the books by Beverly Cleary, is a film that could have easily gone wrong, appealing to younger audiences with endless juvenile slapstick routines. But there's so much more going on here than the mischievous antics of a third grader. It tells a bright, funny, heartfelt story, and despite its innocent tone and waning nostalgia, it never plays down to its audience. It supplies little Ramona with dialogue just sharp enough to make her seem observant, but not so sharp that she sounds like a nine-year-old psychotherapist. It's sweet without becoming sappy. It makes the characters likeable but flawed at the same time. Its plot is fun but not so light-hearted that it sidesteps unfortunate realities. The target audience is young girls, but one doesn't necessarily need to have a daughter or even a family to enjoy it - one only needs to remember what it was like being an imaginative child.Ramona is played by Joey King with just the right mixture of cuteness, pluck, and clumsiness, a girl so charming and loveable that you can't help but want to be her best friend. Beezus is played by Selena Gomez not as a typecast of the mean older sister, but as a blossoming teenager with real insecurities. The two have natural onscreen chemistry. They don't play dumb. They have genuine feelings, a testament to screenwriters Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay, who clearly know a thing or two about human nature. They work just as hard on Ramona's father (John Corbett), a man who does everything he can to make his daughters feel loved and always puts a positive spin on things, even in bad times. The actual state of his well being is debatable, but the fact that he cares enough to keep smiling for his children is genuinely touching.The plot involves Ramona's well-intentioned but misguided efforts to save her house after her father loses his job. She tries selling lemonade. She tries washing the neighbor's car. Neither yield the desired results (the latter especially). She tries circling various jobs in the classified section and showing them to her father; she even encourages him to be a firefighter. She will soon notice that he's quite good at drawing cartoons, and of that, I will say no more.If there is a weakness to ""Ramona and Beezus,"" it's that we find ourselves caring about too many characters, some of whom aren't given enough screen time. There's a subplot, for example, involving Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin), her high school sweetheart Hobart (Josh Duhamel), and their attempts at forming a relationship; I liked them as individuals, and they get along wonderfully with Ramona, but the romance is so condensed that it seems almost trivial. We have the same problem with Beezus' adolescent crush on her classmate, which is bad because, as a plot point, it nicely plays into the film's themes of growth, individuality, and connection to family. It can be argued that the story is a little like Ramona Quimby herself - fun and adorable but also a bit unfocused.I also would have appreciated more moments of Ramona using her imagination. Early scenes, such as when Ramona swings across a playground jungle gym or when she bounces on her bed, feature wonderfully whimsical shots of deep canyons and floating planets; late in the film, as she walks down the street, she imagines a city skyline comprised entirely of landmarks. I refuse to believe her imagination is limited to three shots, especially after hearing her opening monologue, in which she logically and understandably describes the way she views the world.But in the grand scheme of things, these are minor complaints. Watching ""Ramona and Beezus,"" I was reminded of 2008's ""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl,"" which stirred within me the same feelings of fun, adventure, and nostalgia while maintaining a sense of reality. It also gave me everything I looked for and missed in this year's ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"" namely the sense that childhood, family, and friendship were accurately being depicted. It isn't often you come across family films that really are for the whole family and not just kids; even though I'm an adult, I left the theater feeling as if I had actually experienced something worthwhile, something that was playful but respectful at the same time.",4,"She Makes Trouble, but She Means Well",1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,5224,"['Ramona', 'Quimby', ""n't"", 'mean', 'cause',

Each one is carefully detailed and paced - even if the event would seem minor to an adult - it's treated with the importance as a child of Ramona's age would view it.In contrast, this movie pitches Cleary's plots to you like fastballs.  For example, first Ramona gets a bad report card and curses (Ramona the Brave), then she makes a mess with toothpaste (Ramona and Her Mother), and then her dad brings home Gummi Bears for her and sister to share (Ramona and Her Father), and so on.  There's also some fantasy sequences to emphasize Ramona's runaway imagination and to give the film even more of a child's eye-view perspective.The overall plot is basically borrowed from ""Ramona Forever,"" as Howie Kemp's annoying Uncle Hobart tries to (re) woo Ramona's Aunt Bea.  There's also a storyline (Ramona and Her Father) about their dad losing his job (which caused an audible gasp in my audience).  This isn't sugarcoated, although there's a happy ending for all the characters.Joey King does an outstanding job as Ramona, as does Selena Gomez as Beezus (although physically, she's too glamorous for my idea of the character), and the rest of the cast is solid, too.Adult-appropriate only material: Absolutely none, although if your kids know someone who's lost their job, they might ask questions about the bank repossessing their home.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","- A despondent Beezus: ""Who could ever love a girl named Beezus?""- Ramona, hesitantly: ""Jesus?""In Portland, Oregon dwells Ramona Quimby who is nine years, three months old and, despite her older sister Beezus' assertions, isn't at all a pest or a nuisance (except that she is). Ramona's big imagination lends to plenty of daydreaming and playacting and silly shenanigans, and the rest of the kids in her class think she's daft, her teacher rendered bemused and resigned. Ramona means well, has a big heart, comes from a loving family, but she's like Pollyanna and Walter Mitty and an incoming wrecking ball all rolled into one.The story's conflict surfaces when Ramona and Beezus' dad gets laid off and suddenly, for the Quimbys, there's penny pinching and the hovering threat of losing their house. Things like this will sometimes have a bigger impact on the children. Ramona not only becomes terrified of losing her home but, after dialogue with a snotty classmate, she also dreads the possibility of her parents divorcing and maybe having to move to Tacoma. Ramona determines to remedy all this. Everyone take cover.Based on Beverly Cleary's beloved children's books, RAMONA AND BEEZUS and its watchability rest strictly on Joey King's shoulders (Selena Gomez only has a supporting role, really). And to lift one of Ramona's made-up words, Joey King's presence makes this movie all the ""funner."" It's a fine line to toe, I think. Ramona gets into so many scrapes that inconvenience so many people that it would've been disastrous if the filmmakers had tapped the wrong girl to play her. It would've been all too easy for the audience to perceive Ramona as annoying and even unsympathetic. But Joey King is awesome and so very likable, and she works the crowd with that infectious giggle and that marvelously expressive face and a certain irrepressibility. How could you not forgive her her well-intentioned screw-ups?The rest of the cast is really good, especially John Corbett who plays Ramona's understanding, nurturing father. Ramona's interactions with her father and with her sister Beatrice (forever known as ""Beezus"") prove the backbone of the story. I enjoyed watching the sisters' relationship unfold. Ramona, always in trouble about something, fears that she'll never do as well as Beezus who always garners straight A's and is well liked by everyone. And so maybe the turning point for Ramona is when she gets those words of encouragement from Beezus at the end of that one sad evening.Oh, and somehow Ramona does manage to save the day. Go figure.Watch RAMONA AND BEEZUS and, chances are, you'll be enchanted by the wonderful Joey King. There's a comfort and a warmth in watching this movie, and you may even get caught up with the side stories, whether it's Ramona's beloved cute Aunt Bea re-sparking an old romance or Beezus kind of striking up a first one. If you want to meet an extraordinary girl bubbling over with life and imagination and who, in prepping for a princess audition, ends up in the bushes and concocts a makeshift tiara out of burrs, well, that's Ramona Quimby all over. Grown-ups will smile throughout this film. Kids will adore it. Fair warning, though, that your young 'uns may pick up Ramona's favorite curse word. Heck, I may even adopt it. There's something pretty visceral about screaming ""Ah, guts!"" to the heavens. I'm right, yeah?The DVD's bonus stuff: ""Show & Tell Film School"" is seven minutes of director Elizabeth Allen giving tips on how to make a movie and we see how she herself applied these tips to her shooting of RAMONA & BEEZUS; 4 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:04:11 minutes); a gag reel (00:02:50); ""My Ramona"" features an interview with author Beverly Cleary (00:04:14); and the theatrical trailer.",4,Ramona Quimby can be extraordinary - but you probably have to do some damage control in her wake,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,3756,"['despondent', 'Beezus', 'Who', 'could', 'ever', 'love', 'girl', 'named', 'Beezus', 'Ramona', 'hesitantly', 'Jesus', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'Ramona', 'Quimby', 'who', 'nine', 'years', 'three', 'months', 'old', 'older', 'sister', 'Beezus', 'assertions', ""n't"", 'pest', 'nuisance', 'Ramona', 'big', 'imagination', 'plenty', 'daydreaming', 'playacting', 'silly', 'shenanigans', 'rest', 'kids', 'class', 'think', 'daft', 'teacher', 'rendered', 'bemused', 'resigned', 'Ramona', 'well', 'big', 'heart', 'loving', 'family', 'Pollyanna', 'Walter', 'Mitty', 'incoming', 'wrecking', 'ball', 'rolled', 'one.The', 'story', 'conflict', 'surfaces', 'when', 'Ramona', 'Beezus', 'dad', 'laid', 'off', 'suddenly', 'Quimbys', 'penny', 'pinching', 'hovering', 'threat', 'losing', 'house', 'Things', 'will', 'sometimes', 'have', 'bigger', 'impact', 'children', 'Ramona', 'not', 'only', 'terrified', 'losing', 'home', 'dialogue', 'snotty', 'classmate', 'also', 'possibility', 'parents', 'divorcing', 'maybe', 'having', 'move', 'Tacoma', 'Ramona', 'remedy', 'Everyone', 'take', 'cover.Based', 'Beverly', 'Cleary', 'beloved', 'children', 'books', 'RAMONA', 'AND', 'BEEZUS', 'watchability', 'rest', 'strictly', 'Joey', 'King', 'shoulders', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'only', 'supporting', 'role', 'really', 'lift', 'one', 'Ramona', 'made-up', 'words', 'Joey', 'King', 'presence', 'movie', 'funner', 'fine', 'line', 'toe', 'think', 'Ramona', 'so', 'many', 'scrapes', 'inconvenience', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disastrous', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'tapped', 'wrong', 'girl', 'play', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'too', 'easy', 'audience', 'perceive', 'Ramona', 'annoying', 'even', 'unsympathetic', 'Joey', 'King', 'awesome', 'so', 'very', 'likable', 'crowd', 'infectious', 'giggle', 'marvelously', 'expressive', 'face', 'certain', 'irrepressibility', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'forgive', 'well-intentioned', 'screw-ups', 'rest', 'cast', 'really', 'good', 'especially', 'John', 'Corbett', 'who', 'Ramona', 'understanding', 'nurturing', 'father', 'Ramona', 'interactions', 'father', 'sister', 'Beatrice', 'forever', 'known', 'Beezus', 'prove', 'backbone', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'sisters', 'relationship', 'unfold', 'Ramona', 'always', 'trouble', 'something', 'fears', ""'ll"", 'never', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'Beezus', 'who', 'always', 'garners', 'straight', 'A', 'well', 'liked', 'everyone', 'so', 'maybe', 'turning', 'point', 'Ramona', 'when', 'words', 'encouragement', 'Beezus', 'end', 'one', 'sad', 'evening.Oh', 'somehow', 'Ramona', 'manage', 'save', 'day', 'Go', 'figure.Watch', 'RAMONA', 'AND', 'BEEZUS', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'be', 'enchanted', 'wonderful', 'Joey', 'King', 'comfort', 'warmth', 'watching', 'movie', 'may', 'even', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'side', 'stories', 'Ramona', 'beloved', 'cute', 'Aunt', 'Bea', 're-sparking', 'old', 'romance', 'Beezus', 'kind', 'striking', 'up', 'first', 'one', 'want', 'meet', 'extraordinary', 'girl', 'bubbling', 'life', 'imagination', 'who', 'prepping', 'princess', 'audition', 'up', 'bushes', 'makeshift', 'tiara', 'burrs', 'well', 'Ramona', 'Quimby', 'over', 'Grown-ups', 'will', 'smile', 'film', 'Kids', 'will', 'adore', 'Fair', 'warning', 'though', 'young', ""'uns"", 'may', 'pick', 'up', 'Ramona', 'favorite', 'curse', 'word', 'Heck', 'may', 'even', 'adopt', 'something', 'pretty', 'visceral', 'screaming', 'Ah', 'heavens', ""'m"", 'right', 'yeah', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Show', 'Tell', 'Film', 'School', 'seven', 'minutes', 'director', 'Elizabeth', 'Allen', 'giving', 'tips', 'how', 'make', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'applied', 'tips', 'shooting', 'RAMONA', 'BEEZUS', '4', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'totaling', '00:04:11', 'minutes', 'gag', 'reel', '00:02:50', 'Ramona', 'interview', 'author', 'Beverly', 'Cleary', '00:04:14', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

I guess I wanted to take a trip down memory lane and I'm sure glad that I did. This movie is not just for kids. Granted it doesn't have any nudity or cursing if you're into that stuff you will be disappointed BUT it does have a wonderful story if you like that kind of stuff. This is actually a movie that many people can relate to especially if you have a sibling. This movie is about Ramona which is the middle child just trying to fit in any way that she can. She feels like her older sister Beezus is perfect and her younger sister is cute no matter what she does. Ramona and Beezus is really a movie all about family which you do not find much nowadays. The entire cast had so much chemistry together and it really showed in their acting and made it all the much better to watch.

When I realized there was a Ramona movie, I had to get it. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I found that the movie was a nice mixture of some of the popular stories in the books. While the movie mixes and matches some of the various stories from the books (during which Ramona is pre-school aged and on up), the characters stay the same age - Ramona is 9 years old during the movie. Some of the content seems geared towards adults, but it seems like any good kids movie throws in something for the grown ups, and it fits well within the movie. I recommend reading all of the Ramona books before watching the movie - your little one will light up when she sees her favorite characters on screen, and when she sees some of her favorite scenes played out (i.e. the hard boiled egg).

She filled the movie with plenty of real life actions that kids encounter during growing up. Compared to stiff and boring adults, Joey King overshadowed them all with her genuine facial expressions, innate and believable reactions, and richness of motion and sound. At the climax of her family's struggle for job and payment for mortgage, Ramona proposed to her father to work as firefighter so that he could climb gigantic ladders, reach highest places, and penetrate through blazing fires to save people. Any person in the world could easily cheer up on hearing such genuine words from the mouth of a daughter comforting her Dad during his search for a job.Ramona's attempts to sell ""dilishous lemonade"" and wash cars, though ended in minor disasters in stead of bringing money,each attempt ended in connecting ongoing romances. Her lemonade's front store got her sister to get closer to the other's boyfriend. Her car washing campaign also connected two broken hearts and ended with her aunt marrying and departing to Alaska. Ramona's upset on her aunt's broken promises for being there for her forever was compounded by her simultaneous upset for losing her only known house and her parents' stressful financial episode.Ramona's dad was an excellent choice for his role. A calm, soothing figure blessed with an energetic and affectionate child struggling to keep peace in her family. While the adults were making decisions under the demands of economic forces, the children were truly impacted with lasting fear, anxiety, and despair.Despite the movie's relaxing and nurturing ambiance of an average family striving to live, raise the children, and secure their home, the movie theaters did not allow it play beyond one week when other action movies lasted many weeks.",5,"Uninhibited childhood, spiced with joy, struggle, and constant search for identity.",1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,1842,"['Ramona', 'Joey', 'King', 'could', 'be', 'animated', 'innocent', 'lively', 'child', 'filled', 'movie', 'plenty', 'real', 'life', 'actions', 'kids', 'encounter', 'growing', 'up', 'Compared', 'stiff', 'boring', 'adults', 'Joey', 'King', 'overshadowed', 'genuine', 'facial', 'expressions', 'innate', 'believable', 'reactions', 'richness', 'motion', 'sound', 'climax', 'family', 'struggle', 'job', 'payment', 'mortgage', 'Ramona', 'proposed', 'father', 'work', 'as', 'firefighter', 'could', 'climb', 'gigantic', 'ladders', 'reach', 'highest', 'places', 'penetrate', 'blazing', 'fires', 'save', 'people', 'person', 'world', 'could', 'easily', 'cheer', 'up', 'hearing', 'such', 'genuine', 'words', 'mouth', 'daughter', 'comforting', 'Dad', 'search', 'job.Ramona', 'attempts', 'sell', 'dilishous', 'lemonade', 'wash', 'cars', 'though', 'ended', 'minor', 'disasters', 'stead', 'bringing', 'money', 'attempt', 'ended', 'connecting', 'ongoing', 'romances', 'lemonade', 'front', 'store', 'got', 'sister', 'get', 'closer', 'other', 'boyfriend', 'car', 'washing', 'campaign', 'also', 'connected', 'two', 'broken', 'hearts', 'ended', 'aunt', 'marrying', 'departing', 'Alaska', 'Ramona', 'upset', 'aunt', 'broken', 'promises', 'being', 'forever', 'was', 'compounded', 'simultaneous', 'upset', 'losing', 'only', 'known', 'house', 'parents', 'stressful', 'financial', 'episode.Ramona', 'dad', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'role', 'calm', 'soothing', 'figure', 'blessed', 'energetic', 'affectionate', 'child', 'struggling', 'keep', 'peace', 'family', 'adults', 'were', 'making', 'decisions', 'demands', 'economic', 'forces', 'children', 'were', 'truly', 'impacted', 'lasting', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'despair.Despite', 'movie', 'relaxing', 'nurturing', 'ambiance', 'average', 'family', 'striving', 'live', 'raise', 'children', 'secure', 'home', 'movie', 'theaters', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'play', 'one', 'week', 'when', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'lasted', 'many', 'weeks']",N/A

Mr. Quimby was a supermarket employee who made enough for his family to live on.  He went back to school, and his wife was a clerical employee for a doctor's office.  The two girls read books in their spare time and walked to school, which they took very seriously.The movie contains almost none of Cleary's work.  It moves the setting from the world of middle class America to upper-class America.  That is itself a travesty.  It substitutes people's dreams for more money for the message of Cleary--which is that America is great because public school works well even for families who are barely scraping by.  The Quimby house in the movie looks nothing like the one in the book.  And the girls are nothing like them either.  Ramona is not a trained, cute girl in the book.  She is relentlessly plain but so intelligent that she makes you want to cheer for her.The books are so much more sophisticated than the film.  And they provide a memory of what it was like before right-wing politics took over our discourse on education, on unemployment, and on family structure.Please do your children a favor.

This movie is great, clean family fare. There was nothing objectionable and I applaud the producers for creating a movie the entire family can watch. There were a few scenes, such as Ramona dangling over a canyon that might be scary to very young children (under 5).There are wonderful discussion-starters throughout the movie. For instance, Ramona always feels the need to compare herself to her older sister, Beezus. Beezus, of course, sees Ramona as nothing more than a pesty little sister who is always causing trouble. How many children could identify themselves with either Ramona or Beezus?Some of the other children in the movie don't treat Ramona kindly and they laugh at her on more than one occasion. While this movie is not a Christian movie, it did give me the opportunity to remind my children that no matter how the world sees them, it's who they are in Christ that matters. Ephesians 2:10,  John 1:12, and 1 Samuel 16:7 came to mind. Strong family bonds and joining together when times are tough was also a good discussion starter. Family members may not always see eye to eye, but when critical matters arise, unity is crucial.Full of humor, a strong love expressed by family members for each other, some touching parts, and a bit of romance, make this a movie I would highly recommend and have added to my Mom-Approved movies list on my blog.",5,Grew up on Ramona books and couldn't wait to see the movie!,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,1462,"['Having', 'grown', 'up', 'reading', 'Ramona', 'books', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'movie', 'great', 'clean', 'family', 'fare', 'was', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'applaud', 'producers', 'creating', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'such', 'Ramona', 'dangling', 'over', 'canyon', 'might', 'be', 'scary', 'very', 'young', 'children', '5', 'are', 'wonderful', 'discussion-starters', 'movie', 'instance', 'Ramona', 'always', 'need', 'compare', 'older', 'sister', 'Beezus', 'Beezus', 'course', 'Ramona', 'nothing', 'more', 'pesty', 'little', 'sister', 'who', 'always', 'causing', 'trouble', 'How', 'many', 'children', 'could', 'identify', 'Ramona', 'Beezus', 'other', 'children', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'treat', 'Ramona', 'kindly', 'laugh', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'movie', 'not', 'Christian', 'movie', 'did', 'give', 'opportunity', 'remind', 'children', 'matter', 'how', 'world', 'who', 'are', 'Christ', 'matters', 'Ephesians', '2:10', 'John', '1:12', '1', 'Samuel', '16:7', 'came', 'mind', 'Strong', 'family', 'bonds', 'joining', 'together', 'when', 'times', 'are', 'tough', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'discussion', 'starter', 'Family', 'members', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'when', 'critical', 'matters', 'arise', 'unity', 'crucial.Full', 'humor', 'strong', 'love', 'expressed', 'family', 'members', 'other', 'touching', 'parts', 'bit', 'romance', 'make', 'movie', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'have', 'added', 'Mom-Approved', 'movies', 'list', 'blog']",N/A

Either way, I was excited to see this movie but held off seeing it in a movie theater after reading a review that was more than blahzay about the film. Now I know why.Pros: I think there were some excellent actors to play the role. I wouldn't have wanted anybody but John Corbett (plays Robert Quimby), Joey King (Ramona Quimby), Ginnifer Goodwin (Aunt Bea--loved her in ""He's Just Not That Into You""), Selena Gomez (Beezus) or Sandra Oh (Mrs. Meacham) to play those roles. I'm not that familiar with Josh Duhamel, but he's gorgeous and I thought he had great chemistry with Ginnifer.Cons: I know this is a kids' book. I get that.

I don't know any guy who'd pay a kid $100 to wash his car just to talk to a woman he ALREADY dated, or at least he'd ask for his money back. Maybe there are some guys who'd do that, but it seemed like a stretch. $10 I could handle, but $100? Really? Ramona spent a lot of time falling and Bea fell at unrealistic moments.

1384032,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00437IE8G,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","My 6.5-year-old and I have enjoyed Beverly Cleary's Ramona series of books and I thought she'd appreciate the movie, so we watched it as a family tonight. All of us, including my husband, enjoyed it. The movie combines different elements from the various Ramona books, so it is not based on just one Ramona storyline. Nevertheless, the movie flows well and is entertaining.Ramona Quimby is a precocious nine-year-old, and is credibly played by adorable young actor, Joey King. Her older sister Beezus (Beatrice) is played by Selena Gomez. The pair share great chemistry and are a joy to watch on-screen. Dad Robert is played by John Corbett, and his wife, Dorothy is played by Bridget Moynahan (both actors were also on Sex and the City). There's a baby, and aging cat Picky Picky, and the family leads an idyllic middle-class life until something unexpected happens. Dad Robert loses his job as a VP in a storage company (unlike the novels, the Quimby family here is portrayed as being upper middle class) and mom Dorothy is forced to go back to work in a medical clinic. The family is placed under great stress, resulting in family quarrels and the fear of losing their home.In her inimitable fashion, Ramona tries to help out, but each attempt fails disastrously, and finally at wits' end, Ramona makes a drastic decision. Will everything work out for the Quimby family? There's lots of funny moments, and poignant ones too, and enough entertaining moments for the entire family.",5,"Absolutely delightful, a wonderful family movie!",1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,1482,"['6.5-year-old', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Beverly', 'Cleary', 'Ramona', 'series', 'books', 'thought', ""'d"", 'appreciate', 'movie', 'watched', 'family', 'tonight', 'including', 'husband', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'combines', 'different', 'elements', 'various', 'Ramona', 'books', 'not', 'based', 'just', 'one', 'Ramona', 'storyline', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'well', 'entertaining.Ramona', 'Quimby', 'precocious', 'nine-year-old', 'credibly', 'played', 'adorable', 'young', 'actor', 'Joey', 'King', 'older', 'sister', 'Beezus', 'Beatrice', 'played', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'pair', 'share', 'great', 'chemistry', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'on-screen', 'Dad', 'Robert', 'played', 'John', 'Corbett', 'wife', 'Dorothy', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'actors', 'were', 'also', 'Sex', 'City', 'baby', 'aging', 'cat', 'Picky', 'Picky', 'family', 'idyllic', 'middle-class', 'life', 'something', 'unexpected', 'happens', 'Dad', 'Robert', 'job', 'VP', 'storage', 'company', 'novels', 'Quimby', 'family', 'here', 'portrayed', 'being', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'Dorothy', 'forced', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'medical', 'clinic', 'family', 'placed', 'great', 'stress', 'resulting', 'family', 'quarrels', 'fear', 'losing', 'home.In', 'inimitable', 'fashion', 'Ramona', 'help', 'out', 'attempt', 'disastrously', 'finally', 'wits', 'end', 'Ramona', 'drastic', 'decision', 'Will', 'everything', 'work', 'out', 'Quimby', 'family', 'lots', 'funny', 'moments', 'poignant', 'ones', 'too', 'enough', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'entire', 'family']",N/A
