The plainclothes policemen enter without a warrant and take a man away to New Scotland Yard for questioning and an identification parade. He is identified, arrested, and fingerprinted (police procedures). A detective and his girlfriend Alice go for a walk to a restaurant. Does she have another boy friend? The detective figures things out. Alice's artist boyfriend invites her in for a visit. Alice tries her hand at painting. Will she pose for a sketch after changing into another dress? Then Alice rejects his kiss. The artist takes advantage of the situation and continues to make advances. There is a struggle while Alice defends her honor. But now there is a dead body. She dresses and leaves. Was she seen by anyone? Did she leave a clue? The landlady finds the body and calls the police. Hitchcock show his style of mixing in comedy with a telephone call, and the chatter of a neighbor.A stranger shows up at her father's shop. Does he have a mate for that glove? The drama is slow-moving. The landlady is shown photographs and picks the man who left a note. This suspect flees and takes refuge in the British Museum. Will he escape? [The use of an institution as a background recurs in Hitchcock's films.] Alice decides to visit the police and tell what she knows. Will there be a sad or happy ending?

352363,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,6303042163,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[2, 3]","This film is very underrated today because not only is ""Blackmail"" a quintessential Hitchcock psychological thriller about murder and blackmail, but a superior example of silent cinema at its peak in the late 1920s.  It was actually completely finished first as a silent picture, then substantially remade with sound prior to release and then became the first British talkie.  While the sound version remains famous to this day, the original version, considered a masterpiece of high silent cinema, was forgotten after it was distributed to theaters which were not yet wired for sound.  Although the silent version exists and is available, though hard to find, this neglected sound version will have to do us for now.Hitchcock had already directed about ten silent films by 1929 including The Lodger, his first suspense thriller in the style for which he later became famous.  Hitchcock also wrote the screenplay for many of his films, and continually improved on the best and most popular aspects of his earlier work with Blackmail being one of the first resounding successes of his brilliant career.  His early silent cinema work was largely influenced by the German Expressionist style of cinema which put emphasis on lighting and shadows, often exaggerated to create sinister or evocative moods, as well as unusual and innovative camera angles and photography techniques.Earlier silent films by Hitchcock such as ""The Ring"", ""The Manxman"" and ""The Farmer's Wife"" reveal that Hitchcock had a finely-tuned sense for both humour and human nature, as well as a comprehensive understanding of human psychology.  His interest in people is manifest in the way the story and camera often linger on a character's feelings, emotional actions and reactions, thereby deeply involving the audience and creating heightened emotional suspense.  Blackmail encompasses all these carefully developed qualities, precisely balanced throughout the film to add extra dimension, stronger emotion and visual impact.  The first thirty minutes of the film gradually introduce the main characters with their feelings and relationships to each other, building up to the main event: the stabbing murder of a would-be rapist in self defense.Striking, innovative photography makes this film intriguing visually, and provocative emotionally as the audience follows every move and gesture by the unintentional murderess, Alice, and her relationship with boyfriend Frank, who happens to be the police investigator who found Alice's glove at the crime scene.  In true Hitchcock style, the plot soon twists and turns as a blackmailer who had been observing the couple comes forward, only to find things double-back onto him in the end.  With the climax of the film taking place on the dome of the British Museum, ""Blackmail"" began the Hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as a backdrop for suspense sequences and thrilling climaxes.  A worthy addition to a Hitchcock or serious early cinema collection, even on a budget label until a day both this and the original silent version are properly restored as they deserve to be.",4,A Silent film becomes a Talkie,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,3101,"['film', 'very', 'underrated', 'today', 'not', 'only', 'Blackmail', 'quintessential', 'Hitchcock', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'murder', 'blackmail', 'superior', 'example', 'silent', 'cinema', 'peak', 'late', '1920s', 'was', 'actually', 'completely', 'finished', 'first', 'silent', 'picture', 'then', 'substantially', 'remade', 'sound', 'prior', 'release', 'then', 'became', 'first', 'British', 'talkie', 'sound', 'version', 'famous', 'day', 'original', 'version', 'considered', 'masterpiece', 'high', 'silent', 'cinema', 'was', 'forgotten', 'was', 'distributed', 'theaters', 'were', 'not', 'yet', 'wired', 'sound', 'silent', 'version', 'exists', 'available', 'though', 'hard', 'find', 'neglected', 'sound', 'version', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'now.Hitchcock', 'had', 'already', 'directed', 'ten', 'silent', 'films', '1929', 'including', 'Lodger', 'first', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'style', 'later', 'became', 'famous', 'Hitchcock', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'many', 'films', 'continually', 'improved', 'best', 'most', 'popular', 'aspects', 'earlier', 'work', 'Blackmail', 'being', 'one', 'first', 'resounding', 'successes', 'brilliant', 'career', 'early', 'silent', 'cinema', 'work', 'was', 'largely', 'influenced', 'German', 'Expressionist', 'style', 'cinema', 'put', 'emphasis', 'lighting', 'shadows', 'often', 'exaggerated', 'create', 'sinister', 'evocative', 'moods', 'as', 'well', 'unusual', 'innovative', 'camera', 'angles', 'photography', 'techniques.Earlier', 'silent', 'films', 'Hitchcock', 'such', 'Ring', 'Manxman', 'Farmer', 'Wife', 'reveal', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'finely-tuned', 'sense', 'humour', 'human', 'nature', 'as', 'well', 'comprehensive', 'understanding', 'human', 'psychology', 'interest', 'people', 'manifest', 'way', 'story', 'camera', 'often', 'character', 'feelings', 'emotional', 'actions', 'reactions', 'thereby', 'deeply', 'involving', 'audience', 'creating', 'heightened', 'emotional', 'suspense', 'Blackmail', 'carefully', 'developed', 'qualities', 'precisely', 'balanced', 'film', 'add', 'extra', 'dimension', 'stronger', 'emotion', 'visual', 'impact', 'first', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'gradually', 'introduce', 'main', 'characters', 'feelings', 'relationships', 'other', 'building', 'up', 'main', 'event', 'stabbing', 'murder', 'would-be', 'rapist', 'self', 'defense.Striking', 'innovative', 'photography', 'film', 'intriguing', 'visually', 'provocative', 'emotionally', 'audience', 'move', 'gesture', 'unintentional', 'murderess', 'Alice', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'Frank', 'who', 'be', 'police', 'investigator', 'who', 'found', 'Alice', 'glove', 'crime', 'scene', 'true', 'Hitchcock', 'style', 'plot', 'soon', 'twists', 'blackmailer', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'observing', 'couple', 'forward', 'only', 'find', 'things', 'double-back', 'end', 'climax', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'dome', 'British', 'Museum', 'Blackmail', 'began', 'Hitchcock', 'tradition', 'using', 'famous', 'landmarks', 'backdrop', 'suspense', 'sequences', 'thrilling', 'climaxes', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Hitchcock', 'serious', 'early', 'cinema', 'collection', 'even', 'budget', 'label', 'day', 'original', 'silent', 'version', 'are', 'properly', 'restored', 'deserve', 'be']",N/A
352364,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6303042163,Bomojaz,"[0, 0]","This is an early Hitchcock talkie in which he developed some of the familiar trademarks and techniques that would later be associated with some of his best works. The main theme, for example, is one that Hitch would return to again and again: an innocent victim trapped within circumstances beyond his control. In this case a girl (Anny Ondra) is picked up by an artist (Cyril Richard) who takes her to his flat; when he tries to take advantage of her, she stabs him to death. Her longtime boyfriend (John Longden), who works for Scotland Yard, finds one of her gloves at the scene of the crime and keeps the evidence to himself, convinced she must be innocent. But a blackmailer has found the other glove and plans on using it to his advantage - until it's found out he's wanted by the police. A chase ensues through the British Museum up to the rotunda, where the blackmailer falls off. (This sort of chase through a well-known landmark would also be used by Hitchcock in future movies.) The acting is on the stilted side, thanks to the low-tech equipment of the day: Ondra's voice had to be dubbed in, which was done on the spot with the dubber kneeling just out of sight. There are some interesting location shots showing London in the 1920s. Not a bad picture, but is more an indication of what was yet to come than a major work in its own right.",4,Early Hitchcock,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,1351,"['early', 'Hitchcock', 'talkie', 'developed', 'familiar', 'trademarks', 'techniques', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'associated', 'best', 'works', 'main', 'theme', 'example', 'one', 'Hitch', 'would', 'return', 'again', 'again', 'innocent', 'victim', 'trapped', 'circumstances', 'control', 'case', 'girl', 'Anny', 'Ondra', 'picked', 'up', 'artist', 'Cyril', 'Richard', 'who', 'flat', 'when', 'take', 'advantage', 'her', 'stabs', 'death', 'longtime', 'boyfriend', 'John', 'Longden', 'who', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'one', 'gloves', 'scene', 'crime', 'evidence', 'convinced', 'must', 'be', 'innocent', 'blackmailer', 'found', 'other', 'glove', 'plans', 'using', 'advantage', 'found', 'wanted', 'police', 'chase', 'British', 'Museum', 'rotunda', 'where', 'blackmailer', 'off', 'sort', 'chase', 'well-known', 'landmark', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'used', 'Hitchcock', 'future', 'movies', 'acting', 'stilted', 'side', 'thanks', 'low-tech', 'equipment', 'day', 'Ondra', 'voice', 'had', 'be', 'dubbed', 'was', 'done', 'spot', 'dubber', 'kneeling', 'just', 'sight', 'are', 'interesting', 'location', 'shots', 'showing', 'London', '1920s', 'Not', 'bad', 'picture', 'more', 'indication', 'what', 'was', 'yet', 'come', 'major', 'work', 'own', 'right']",N/A
352365,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,6303042163,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[2, 3]",Alfred Hitchcock's 1929 feature Blackmail gives its viewer an early glimpse of the genius that the master director was to become. The film is a rather conventional thriller by today's standards. The plot folows the story of Alice White who kills in self defense only to have the murder blamed on a petty criminal who tries to blackmail Ms. White.Hitchcock uses his trademark style to tell his story and gives an early example of the chase that would make him famous in later films. This chase through the British Museum foreshadows later chases in such films as North By Northwest. Also  Hitchcock uses closeups in order to convey the notion that the world is closing in on his characters.The disc I viewed had some problems. This low cost version had a tendency to freeze and skip at various moments. The print and sound quality is average. The material has not been restored. Overall the disc makes a decent but not perfect viewing experience.

352366,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6303042163,calvinnme,"[12, 14]","Here's another public domain copy of one of Hitchcock's early films. The video is just entirely too fuzzy, and I don't recommend it. Won't someone take an interest in restoring Hitchcock's early films for DVD in Region 1? This film may not hold up among Hitchcock's great films from his golden years of 1948 through 1963, but compare it to any other talking picture from 1929 and then tell me what you think.The fact is, this film is shot part silent. Yes there is sound, but there is no synchronized dialogue until about ten minutes into the film when the police detective and his girlfriend who are the central characters speak to one another. Shooting the film primarily silent with synchronized effects and leaving the talking sequences for segments of the film where dialogue was necessary and then having the judgement to know how much dialogue was enough and stop at that point was something Hitchcock got from the beginning. Watch some of the long-winded speeches from some other 1929 films and realize that many of Hitchcock's contemporaries struggled with this skill.The story is a good one. Alice is feeling neglected by her detective boyfriend, and follows a handsome artist up to his flat. After some flirting the artist turns suddenly violent and assaults her. She defends herself by grabbing a knife and stabbing the man. Stunned and sure she has not been seen by anyone entering the man's flat, she attempts to erase all signs of her presence there and returns home. She mentions the incident to noone, but is weighted down with guilt.Frank, Alice's boyfriend, investigates the crime scene and sees Alice's glove. He confiscates it. Unfortunately, someone else who is not Alice has the other glove. The lovers don't discuss anything but the threat of the blackmailer until the end of the film. Like many of Hitchcock's later works, much of his art is in furtive glances and in objects that recall the crime rather than specific dialogue. An example of this is a jester in the artist's painting that Alice sees as pointing at her and thus accusing her. The jester meets Alice's eye both immediately after the crime and at the end of the film.Highly recommended as one of the best talking pictures of 1929.

352367,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,6303042163,Casey62,"[2, 2]","BLACKMAIL, released by British International in 1929, was Alfred Hitchcock's and the British film industry's first sound production, and is one of the director's greatest earlier works. Hitchcock was much more experimental during his British period than he was later in Hollywood when his films took on a slightly predictable, more formulaic style. BLACKMAIL certainly has its share of familiar Hitchcockian touches, but it offers some neat little surprises as well.Anny Ondra plays Alice White, a woman who stabs an artist (Cyril Ritchard) to death when he attempts to rape her in his studio. Her detective boyfriend, Frank Webber (John Longden) is assigned to the case and discovers evidence that implicates her but decides to cover it up. Both are put on the spot when an unsavory fellow named Tracy (Donald Calthrop) shows up with knowledge of the whole affair and attempts to blackmail the couple.Hitchcock already shows his deft handling of the new technology by using sound in creative ways, even before Fritz Lang did more celebratingly so with his M in 1931. The scene that is usually cited from BLACKMAIL is where the characters are discussing the murder over breakfast and the word ""knife "" is repeated over and over, muffling out the rest of the conversation, thereby suggesting Alice's mounting anxiety. For me though, an even more innovative use of sound occurs earlier after the stabbing when Alice abruptly encounters a drunken hobo passed out on the sidewalk - the imagery recalling the dead man in the studio. She's startled and we hear a scream which we assume is hers, but there's a quick cut and the scream overlaps into the next shot back at the crime scene where the landlady discovers the body, and we realize it's the landlady who is screaming and not Alice. Right away with his first talkie, Hitchcock is using sound to manipulate our perceptions as well as to advance the story. He used this same device later in THE THIRTY NINE STEPS (1935), when the body of the murdered lady spy is discovered and what we think is a scream turns out to be a train whistle.In BLACKMAIL, we're shown Hitchcock's brilliant use of ordinary objects as having major significance to the narrative and psychology of the characters. Alice's knack for losing her gloves, for example, figures into the plot because she leaves them behind at the crime scene, thus providing the only incriminating evidence. There's also a creepy painting of a court jester posed as laughing and pointing his finger out at us, as if saying, ""I saw what you did!"". We're first shown the painting when Alice visits the artist's studio, and after killing her would be rapist she rips a gash in it with her fingernails - as if to lash back at its accusing implications. In the ensuing events, Tracy is blamed for the killing and he dies trying to elude his pursuers. Alice, with Frank's help, literally gets away with murder (a rare thing in movies). And so the painting, in effect, stands in for Alice's conscience. The very last shot in the film is of it being hauled off as exhibit B, slashed, still laughing and pointing mockingly as if it ""knows"" the girl's secret. The fact that WE know her secret means the painting comes to represent us as well. So simple, yet as I said, brilliant.BLACKMAIL also contains a highly effective music score constructed around an agitated main theme, or leitmotiv, which accentuates action and heightens suspense. This is exemplified in the opening montage that follows Scotland Yard's routine of making an arrest and then again during the final climactic chase at The British Museum. Even more remarkable is the way music is used to depict the inner, emotional turmoil of Alice during the sequence right after the murder when she leaves the studio and staggers aimlessly through the London streets, with images of the grisly event seemingly popping up everywhere she looks. This is one of the earliest examples of the kind of dramatic underscoring that didn't become a staple in films until 1932/33.This review is based on the version of BLACKMAIL that's included in ""The Early Hitchcock Collection"" UK Region 2 DVD Edition from Optimum Home Entertainment. It is by far the best quality available on BLACKMAIL, displaying excellent sharpness and tonal range, and clear reproduction of the early sound recording.* A delightful bonus is the sound test Hitchcock made of Anny Ondra who was dubbed due to her Czech accent which, as the test reveals, wasn't so bad when one considers that Greta Garbo was a hit with her accent just a year later in ANNA CHRISTIE (1930). BLACKMAIL was also released as a silent version, and the alternate, silent ""knife scene"" is included on the disc as another extra.The other eight features in this set are all fine examples of Hitchcock's versatility and prove that the ""Master of Suspense"" was equally adept in other genres. This is especially evident with his last silent film and underrated masterpiece, THE MANXMAN (1929), which also stars the lovely Anny Ondra, and the offbeat, comedy/drama RICH AND STRANGE (1932), which is one of the few films Hitchcock didn't adapt but instead wrote himself.FOOTNOTE: Since posting this review, I have acquired the Arthaus version of BLACKMAIL from Germany and it edges out the Optimum release in all respects. It's also transfered from 35mm, and includes the rare, complete silent version, the sound test and a photo gallery. The silent version is a real revelation, as it differs in camera set-ups and action when compared with the sound version. The quality of the 35mm print is excellent, and it's accompanied by a well composed score. For the best presentation of BLACKMAIL, you can't do better than the Arthaus DVD. You'll need an all region player, though.",5,AN EARLY HITCHCOCK MASTERPIECE,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,5753,"['BLACKMAIL', 'released', 'British', 'International', '1929', 'was', 'Alfred',

It is the first British sound film that was originally shot as a silent and then remade partially with the sound which gives it a very interesting look. It is the film where Hitchcock made the appearance for the first time which would become one of his trademarks. He already used his distinctive camera angles to create memorable effects in his very early picture. As the result, ""Blackmail"" looks, sounds, moves, and feels surprisingly modern and fresh for almost 80 years old production.The film concerns a young woman Alice who began to flirt with an artist and while visiting his studio, she stabbed him to death in self-defense after she had refused his demands of posing in the nude and he would not take ""no"" for an answer.Watching the movie I also noticed that Hitchcock and Luis Bunuel had the same fetishes - looks like the old saying proved to be right, great minds think (and desire) alike.",4,Remarkable in Many Ways Early Master's Film,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,977,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Blackmail', '1929', 'movie', 'remarkable', 'many', 'ways', 'first', 'British', 'sound', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'silent', 'then', 'remade', 'partially', 'sound', 'very', 'interesting', 'look', 'film', 'where', 'Hitchcock', 'made', 'appearance', 'first', 'time', 'would', 'become', 'one', 'trademarks', 'already', 'used', 'distinctive', 'camera', 'angles', 'create', 'memorable', 'effects', 'very', 'early', 'picture', 'result', 'Blackmail', 'moves', 'feels', 'surprisingly', 'modern', 'fresh', 'almost', '80', 'years', 'old', 'production.The', 'film', 'concerns', 'young', 'woman', 'Alice', 'who', 'began', 'flirt', 'artist', 'visiting', 'studio', 'stabbed', 'death', 'self-defense', 'had', 'refused', 'demands', 'posing', 'nude', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'answer.Watching', 'movie', 'also', 'noticed', 'Hitchcock', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'had', 'same', 'fetishes', 'old', 'saying', 'proved', 'be', 'right', 'great', 'minds', 'think', 'desire', 'alike']",N/A
352370,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6303042163,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","Director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) began his career designing title cards for silent films.  In 1925 his directorial debut, THE PLEASURE GARDEN, was considered such a flop that it was shelved until the later THE LODGER, his first thriller, proved a sensation at the box office.  In 1928 Hitchcock returned to the thriller genre with BLACKMAIL.  Based on a play by Charles Bennett, it was originally designed as a silent film--but sound had begun to roar, and British Internation Pictures instructed Hitchcock to film portions with sound.  By most accounts, Hitchcock felt this was a silly sort of idea and he responded by creating what is now regarded as England's first ""all-talking"" film.The description is a bit misleading.  Although there is some background, the first few minutes of the film are clearly silent, and there are significant stretches of silence as the film progresses.  To the modern viewer, BLACKMAIL feels more like a transition between silent and sound films than a purely sound film per se.  The smoothness of the film is also hindered by the fact that actress Anny Ondra, cast when the film was a silent project, spoke with a heavy accent and had to be dubbed on the spot by Joan Barry, who stood off camera and read the lines as Ondra moved her lips.  This aside, the film also suffers from the numerous technical problems that tended to beset movies struggling with the new technology, and although Hitchcock manages these better than most of his contemporaries BLACKMAIL nonetheless has the slightly clunky quality typical of a film from this period.All the same, BLACKMAIL remains fascinating because it gives us the opportunity to see Hitchcock becoming Hitchcock.  Although he had shown a distinct flair for suspense in THE LODGER, at this point in his career Hitchcock worked in a number of genres--and would continue to do so for several more years.  Even so, BLACKMAIL marked a turning point.  In this film he begins to elaborate ideas first raised in THE LODGER and add to them as well.  In the process, he sets up a series of cinematic themes that he continued to explore throughout the bulk of his career: the risks of sexual appeal; the beautiful woman in danger and the degree to which she herself is responsible for her danger; the complicity of those who support her; being isolated in danger even as aid is nearby; unexpected violence in public places; and fear of heights--to name but a few.The story itself is quite simple.  Alice (Omby) is an attractive young woman who works as a clerk in her parents' shop.  She is dating Frank (John Longden), who is an up-and-coming detective at Scotland Yard.  But Frank seems a bit stodgy, and on a whim she accepts an invitation from an artist (Cyril Ritchard) to visit his studio.  She flirts with him but then resists his advances, and when he attempts to rape her she stabs him to death in his bed.  By chance Frank is assigned to the case and quickly knows Alice to be the killer.  He elects to help her conceal the crime--but by doing so places them at the mercy of a blackmailer.Interestingly, the film does not really assign blame per se.  Although she went out of her way to place herself in danger, we sympathize with Alice, and we hope Frank will help her.  At the same time, however, the way in which Frank ultimately decides to help her is unacceptable and demonstrates that he too is capable of murder.  It is an interesting dynamic that Hitchcock is unable to resolve within the context of this film--and one that he would play upon repeatedly and with increasing finesse as the years passed.Unfortunately, even die-hard Hitchcock fans will find BLACKMAIL difficult to watch for the simple reason that there isn't a decent print on the home market.  At worst, prints are virtually unwatchable; at best they suffer from significantly poor visual and audio elements.  Until it receives a major restoration, BLACKMAIL is perhaps best left to hardcore Hitchcock fans who are willing to endure poor quality for the sake of seeing Hitchcock become Hitchcock.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,Hitchcock Becoming Hitchcock,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,4073,"['Director', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1899-1980', 'began', 'career', 'designing', 'title', 'cards', 'silent', 'films', '1925', 'directorial', 'debut', 'THE', 'PLEASURE', 'GARDEN', 'was', 'considered', 'flop', 'was', 'shelved', 'later', 'THE', 'LODGER', 'first', 'thriller', 'proved', 'sensation', 'box', 'office', '1928', 'Hitchcock', 'returned', 'thriller', 'genre', 'BLACKMAIL', 'Based', 'play', 'Charles', 'Bennett', 'was', 'originally', 'designed', 'silent', 'film', 'sound', 'had', 'begun', 'roar', 'British', 'Internation', 'Pictures', 'instructed', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'portions', 'sound', 'most', 'accounts', 'Hitchcock', 'felt', 'was', 'silly', 'sort', 'idea', 'responded', 'creating', 'what', 'now', 'regarded', 'England', 'first', 'all-talking', 'film.The', 'description', 'bit', 'misleading', 'background', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'clearly', 'silent', 'are', 'significant', 'stretches', 'silence', 'film', 'modern', 'viewer', 'BLACKMAIL', 'more', 'transition', 'silent', 'sound', 'films', 'purely', 'sound', 'film', 'se', 'smoothness', 'film', 'also', 'hindered', 'fact', 'actress', 'Anny', 'Ondra', 'cast', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'silent', 'project', 'spoke', 'heavy', 'accent', 'had', 'be', 'dubbed', 'spot', 'Joan', 'Barry', 'who', 'stood', 'off', 'camera', 'read', 'lines', 'Ondra', 'moved', 'lips', 'aside', 'film', 'also', 'numerous', 'technical', 'problems', 'tended', 'beset', 'movies', 'struggling', 'new', 'technology', 'Hitchcock', 'better', 'most', 'contemporaries', 'BLACKMAIL', 'nonetheless', 'slightly', 'clunky', 'quality', 'typical', 'film', 'same', 'BLACKMAIL', 'fascinating', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Hitchcock', 'becoming', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'shown', 'distinct', 'flair', 'suspense', 'THE', 'LODGER', 'point', 'career', 'Hitchcock', 'worked', 'number', 'genres', 'would', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'several', 'more', 'years', 'Even', 'so', 'BLACKMAIL', 'marked', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'elaborate', 'ideas', 'first', 'raised', 'THE', 'LODGER', 'add', 'as', 'well', 'process', 'up', 'series', 'cinematic', 'themes', 'continued', 'explore', 'bulk', 'career', 'risks', 'sexual', 'appeal', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'danger', 'degree', 'responsible', 'danger', 'complicity', 'who', 'support', 'being', 'isolated', 'danger', 'even', 'aid', 'nearby', 'unexpected', 'violence', 'public', 'places', 'fear', 'heights', 'name', 'few.The', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'Alice', 'Omby', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'clerk', 'parents', 'shop', 'dating', 'Frank', 'John', 'Longden', 'who', 'up-and-coming', 'detective', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Frank', 'bit', 'stodgy', 'whim', 'invitation', 'artist', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'visit', 'studio', 'then', 'advances', 'when', 'rape', 'stabs', 'death', 'bed', 'chance', 'Frank', 'assigned', 'case', 'quickly', 'knows', 'Alice', 'be', 'killer', 'help', 'conceal', 'crime', 'doing', 'so', 'mercy', 'blackmailer.Interestingly', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'assign', 'blame', 'se', 'went', 'way', 'place', 'danger', 'sympathize', 'Alice', 'hope', 'Frank', 'will', 'help', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'way', 'Frank', 'ultimately', 'help', 'unacceptable', 'too', 'capable', 'murder', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'Hitchcock', 'unable', 'resolve', 'context', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'play', 'repeatedly', 'increasing', 'finesse', 'years', 'passed.Unfortunately', 'even', 'die-hard', 'Hitchcock', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'BLACKMAIL', 'difficult', 'watch', 'simple', 'reason', ""n't"", 'decent', 'print', 'home', 'market', 'worst', 'prints', 'are', 'virtually', 'unwatchable', 'best', 'suffer', 'significantly', 'poor', 'visual', 'audio', 'elements', 'major', 'restoration', 'BLACKMAIL', 'perhaps', 'best', 'left', 'hardcore', 'Hitchcock', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'endure', 'poor', 'quality', 'sake', 'seeing', 'Hitchcock', 'become', 'Hitchcock.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

It is worth all of the price to see the hugely innovative camera work that Hitchcock used to roll out this 1929 movie. He took a simple story that really needed no more than a stage; connected the scenes with interesting movement and understandable transitions; then held your attention with camera work decades ahead of the time. The bonus of the movie is watching the actors ham it up--especially the nasty extortionist--using a mime-expression style of acting for its' 1920s time so that the audience always, without fail, recognized the villain seducer, always taciturn hero, guilty woman, tough detective, slimey blackmailer, etal. As an extra bonus, the story made certain that nobody nice was sent to jail. If the story had been filmed today, the blackmailer would have gone up in flames after falling from the British Airlines ferris wheel, but in 1929 Hitchcock did the next best thing and . . . well, I say,  you'll have to watch the movie to see the blackmailer's appropriate finish.

The aura of elegance and innocence which emanates from her gauzy figure make her downward spiral into guilt all the more grueling to watch. Due to her heavy Czech accent, an example of which can be viewed in sound test Hitchcock made with the young actress that has now been archived by the American Film Institute, she never actually speaks a word in the film. Her dialogue instead is voiced by British actress Joan Barry. It is however the scenes in which she expresses no dialogue whatsoever that are perhaps the most memorable. The impression of fear, horror, shock, and self-resentment in Alice's eyes moments after she kills Cyril Ritchard is a perfect example of this. This in turn is followed up with the more famous `knife' scene in which Hitchcock uses a dialogue sequence involving a caustic British neighbor repeatedly uttering the word `knife', drilling it not only in our minds but Alice's as well until she can stand it no more and throws the bread-knife she is holding out of her hand in shock. It is this scene alone which makes the sound-version of Blackmail all the more memorable then its silent counterpart.Sadly, whether it is due to the inferior sound technology of the time or her own voice, Joan Barry's overlay of Alice's lines of dialogue are too squeaky and high-pitched. They don't quite match up with Ondra's mouthing of her lines, with the exception of one or two scenes. This, again, is no fault of Hitchcock who at the time of casting Czech actress Anny Ondra was making a silent picture. Since he was close friends with the actress, he couldn't bear to let her go once British International Pictures decided to make Blackmail a `talkie', so he came up with the best solution he could think of that wouldn't involve firing Miss Ondra. It's a mixed bag. It works in some respects, but on the other hand it doesn't in others.Cyril Ritchard is particularly captivating as the villain of the picture. This is viewed as one of Hitchcock's famous `against type' casting decisions which works splendidly. Upon first meeting the man, audiences, like Alice, never suspect him of being a malefactor. However, the longer Alice remains in his apartment, the more we, along with her, develop a growing suspicion of his character until it climaxes with him forcefully grabbing her and advancing himself on her.Blackmail contains at least two especially notable `slight of hand' moments cultivated by Alfred Hitchcock. First, the film contains one of the director's more memorable cameos in which a boy on a subway train pulls the hat of the director over his head, leading Hitchcock to berate the boy and his family. The boy confronts the man again, this time leaving the two engaged in a staring contest until the scene ends. Although the witty scene does end rather abruptly, perhaps even a bit clumsily, the levity of the moment works nonetheless. The other fleeting gesture of Hitchcock's is considered to be his lasting tribute to the silent picture-era which, now with the invention of `talkies', he was now embarking from in his filmmaking career. Right before Clew is about to advance on Alice, a shadow is imposed on Ritchard's face making it appear as though he had a curly mustache much in the same vein as the clich&eacute;d villains of the silent films.The rape scene in particular is especially mesmerizing. Nothing is shown however but not because of government censors. The lack of visual imagery is of Hitchcock's own volition. The eerily penetrating silence of the moment and what is not seen, leaving the diabolical deed to the device of our own imagination, is what makes this scene all the more fascinating to watch.Though certainly engaging to a point, Blackmail, as it winds down towards its conclusion, does become rather predictable. The ending however is not so much the problem. Frankly this ending is a far superior one to the original Hitchcock developed which would have had Alice, ridden with guilt, turning herself in. Instead Alice is made to rot with guilt, possibly for the rest of her miserable life. A more diabolical ending for Mr. Hitchcock then one would expect so early in his career. Audiences are made to confront the fact that Alice would have been better off having confessed to the murder and conceivably gotten off on the argument that she was acting in self-defense, which she was, rather then relying on Frank to cover it up for her and in the process causing the death of another man, whether he deserved it or not. Blackmail hits upon a common theme of Hitchcock's films; this of course is the fear police invoke in the mindset of the general public and why it is so hard for people to confess to a crime even if they were acting in good judgment.Although the ending to the film suggests that Alice is off the hook and the now deceased blackmailer has been accused of the murder, the fleeting image of Crew's last painting, a clown-like figure laughing mockingly, leaves one to assume that Alice's conscience will never be freed of the burden of her guilt. If Frank and Alice do end up getting married and live the rest of their lives together, it is understandable to suspect that it will not be a happy life in part to these events. However, on the other hand, it is just sensible to suggest that they will never end up together.",4,The Moose Hole - Classic Hitchcock,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,5428,"['vibrantly', 'beautiful',

The story is classic Hitchcock: a beautiful young girl named Alice (played by Anny Ondra but, due to her noticeable accent, voiced by Joan Barry) becomes the victim of an attempted rape by an acquaintance of hers who seems like a nice chap, but after a few drinks and a cruel trick he has her pinned to his bed. She tries to fight him off but to no avail: that is until her hand finds a sharp knife resting on a table nearby. After a couple of minutes all is quiet, and she fumbles out of the bed curtains in a daze, half undressed, and with the bloody knife in hand: her attacker lies dead. In a hazy panic she cleans up all traces of her presence at his apartment, wanders around London in a guilt-ridden shambles, sneaks back into her parent's house where she lives, and fakes it like she's been in her room all night. After news of the murder gets out in the papers: Alice is visited by her on again/off again boyfriend who just happens to be a detective at Scotland Yard (and who just happens to have been assigned the case). The young girl is also visited by a sleazy, down-on-his-luck blackmailer who was on the spot, and has evidence that she was the one who killed the guy. This is the kind of drama that Hitchcock tweaks for all it's worth: with several unforgettable scenes including the murder sequence, and the episode where Alice walks around town all night while her shame and guilt is portrayed in a series of hallucinatory images that highlights the terror of the apartmenthouse killing. Another great scene involves the police chase around the British Museum which culminates in a violent climax. And don't forget to look for Hitch himself: making his usual on-screen appearance as a bus passenger tormented by a little kid who keeps knocking the hat off his head!",4,"BLACKMAIL (BRITISH INTERNATIONAL PICTURES, LTD./1929)",1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,2172,"['REVIEW', 'BLACKMAIL', 'started', 'out', 'silent', 'film', 'technological', 'breakthroughs', 'sound', 'recording', 'director', 'Hitchcock', 'relished', 'idea', 'making', 'talking', 'picture', 'Hence', 'fact', 'first', 'several', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'mostly', 'silent', 'rest', 'film', 'presented', 'England', 'first', 'ever', 'talkie', 'supposedly', 'silent', 'print', 'available', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'classic', 'Hitchcock', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Alice', 'played', 'Anny', 'Ondra', 'due', 'noticeable', 'accent', 'voiced', 'Joan', 'Barry', 'victim', 'attempted', 'rape', 'acquaintance', 'hers', 'who', 'nice', 'chap', 'few', 'drinks', 'cruel', 'trick', 'pinned', 'bed', 'fight', 'off', 'avail', 'hand', 'sharp', 'knife', 'resting', 'table', 'nearby', 'couple', 'minutes', 'quiet', 'bed', 'daze', 'half', 'undressed', 'bloody', 'knife', 'hand', 'attacker', 'dead', 'hazy', 'panic', 'up', 'traces', 'presence', 'apartment', 'wanders', 'London', 'guilt-ridden', 'shambles', 'sneaks', 'back', 'parent', 'house', 'where', 'been', 'room', 'night', 'news', 'murder', 'out', 'papers', 'Alice', 'visited', 'again/off', 'again', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'detective', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'assigned', 'case', 'young', 'girl', 'also', 'visited', 'sleazy', 'down-on-his-luck', 'blackmailer', 'who', 'was', 'spot', 'evidence', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'killed', 'guy', 'kind', 'drama', 'Hitchcock', 'tweaks', 'worth', 'several', 'unforgettable', 'scenes', 'including', 'murder', 'sequence', 'episode', 'where', 'Alice', 'town', 'night', 'shame', 'guilt', 'portrayed', 'series', 'hallucinatory', 'images', 'highlights', 'terror', 'apartmenthouse', 'killing', 'great', 'scene', 'police', 'chase', 'British', 'Museum', 'violent', 'climax', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'look', 'Hitch', 'making', 'usual', 'on-screen', 'appearance', 'bus', 'passenger', 'tormented', 'little', 'kid', 'who', 'knocking', 'hat', 'head']",N/A
352375,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6303042163,Randy Keehn,"[9, 10]","I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock's movies.  His expertise as a director has helped create some bonafide film classics over his career.  I got a box set of early Hitchcock movies and have been (generally) enjoying them.  Some movies are noteworthy because they show the Master in the early development of his skills.  Most of them, however, are not all that enthralling to watch.  What they display in directorial talent is offset by an often lackluster plot.  ""Blackmail"" is a significant exception to the others in that regard.  ""Blackmail"" is a GOOD movie.There is much of the Hitchcock talent to be appreciated in ""Blackmail"".  Among the more impressive scenes are a murder in which virtually all of the action is behind a curtain yet there are enough details that we know exactly what is happening and why.  There's also the perpetrator's stunned response to the events and her demeanor thereafter with complements to the director and actress.  There's a chase through the British Museum that doesn't compare with some of his later movies but shows that he knows the importance of the ""chase"" as an intregal element in suspense.  There are little things as well such as how Alice, resigned to her fate, rises from her chair and an innocent shadow becomes the image of a noose around her neck.  There's the Master himself in one of his earliest and, perhaps his most obvious, cameo appearance.  All of these and many other facets help a good plot move along in an impressive manor to where we don't know how the movie ends until we behold it ourselves.""Blackmail"" was noted as the first sound picture made in England.  At first I thought that there was something wrong with my DVD because the only sound was music.  However, in time the voices emerged (almost sounding dubbed at first) and the sound improved as the movie progressed.  Regardless of the historical value of ""Blackmail"" for Hitchcock and other film buffs, this is an early movie that can be appreciated just for what it is.  I gave it 4 ""stars"" because, let's face it, as good as it is, Hitchcock went on to do a lot better.",4,Early Promise of Greatness,1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,2094,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'expertise', 'director', 'helped', 'create', 'bonafide', 'film', 'classics', 'career', 'got', 'box', 'set', 'early', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'generally', 'enjoying', 'movies', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'show', 'Master', 'early', 'development', 'skills', 'Most', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'enthralling', 'watch', 'What', 'display', 'directorial', 'talent', 'offset', 'often', 'lackluster', 'plot', 'Blackmail', 'significant', 'exception', 'others', 'regard', 'Blackmail', 'GOOD', 'movie.There', 'much', 'Hitchcock', 'talent', 'be', 'appreciated', 'Blackmail', 'more', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'are', 'murder', 'virtually', 'action', 'curtain', 'yet', 'are', 'enough', 'details', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'happening', 'why', 'also', 'perpetrator', 'stunned', 'response', 'events', 'demeanor', 'thereafter', 'complements', 'director', 'actress', 'chase', 'British', 'Museum', ""n't"", 'compare', 'later', 'movies', 'importance', 'chase', 'intregal', 'element', 'suspense', 'are', 'little', 'things', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'how', 'Alice', 'resigned', 'fate', 'chair', 'innocent', 'shadow', 'image', 'noose', 'neck', 'Master', 'one', 'earliest', 'perhaps', 'most', 'obvious', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'many', 'other', 'facets', 'help', 'good', 'plot', 'move', 'along', 'impressive', 'manor', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'behold', 'Blackmail', 'was', 'noted', 'first', 'sound', 'picture', 'made', 'England', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'only', 'sound', 'was', 'music', 'However', 'time', 'voices', 'emerged', 'almost', 'sounding', 'dubbed', 'first', 'sound', 'improved', 'movie', 'progressed', 'Regardless', 'historical', 'value', 'Blackmail', 'Hitchcock', 'other', 'film', 'buffs', 'early', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'just', 'what', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'let', 'face', 'as', 'good', 'Hitchcock', 'went', 'do', 'lot', 'better']",N/A
352376,A28OQCWHY29DN8,6303042163,Robert L. Edwards,"[4, 6]","Historically, this is genuine find - note the date: 1929.  It was Hitchcock's and England's FIRST TALKIE.Blackmail provides glimpses of the future master director's style and was decades ahead of its time, presaging the film noir classics of the late 40s and early 50s.  But what is so fascinating is the way in which Hitchcock dealt with sound, providing a transition from silent to talkie in a matter of minutes.The film begins just like so many other silent films - an orchestra providing musical cues for audience reaction. We even see people talking but don't hear them; slowly, intermittently, sound effects appear, involving cars or doors and walking (note when the first person steps out of police van, we hear the footsteps, but none for those who follow immediately) and eventually we hear talking, but we don't see the faces or mouths moving.  Then comes the moment when actors speak and we hear the words from their mouths. From then on, its full sound and sound effects.One of the stars is Cyril Ritchard, who was immortalized as Captain Hook in the 1960s TV version of Peter Pan.  He plays the piano and sings and its not faked - thats really him. But masterful Hitch (and yes, there is wonderful cameo) is the true star: the camera angles, the shots of body parts, action that is suggested (a murder with a knife that takes place behind a curtain (!)) and suggestive - surprisingly when star Anny Ondra modestly undresses behind a screen, we watch her, with no cutaway. Seeing her taking off her clothes and seeing the undergarments, which are lifted, must have been scandalous to an England still possessed by Victorian morals.The story is simple: a shopkeeper's daughter (Ondra) has a Scotland Yard detective boyfriend Frank Webber (John Longdon)  who is more interested in police work than her. On a dinner date, she had secretly arranged to meet another man, an artist (Ritchard) who invites her back to his place to see his paintings. He decides to rape her but she grabs a bread knife and kills him.The detective quickly determines that she is the killer but holds the evidence.  A criminal who witnessed enough to engage in a little blackmail complicates the plot.The film is 86 minutes and suffers some mild deterioration, but largely is both watchable and fascinating, especially for Hitch fans. The interior shots at the British museum are awesome - consider the lighting requirements to get those shots! I was also struck by the extraordinary feel of the transition from silent to talkie. Imagine being in a theatre in 1929 and experiencing that.Wow!",3,A film buff's delight.,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,2576,"['Historically', 'genuine', 'note', 'date', '1929', 'was', 'Hitchcock', 'England', 'FIRST', 'TALKIE.Blackmail', 'glimpses', 'future', 'master', 'director', 'style', 'was', 'decades', 'ahead', 'time', 'presaging', 'film', 'noir', 'classics', 'late', '40s', 'early', '50s', 'what', 'so', 'fascinating', 'way', 'Hitchcock', 'dealt', 'sound', 'providing', 'transition', 'silent', 'talkie', 'matter', 'minutes.The', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'silent', 'films', 'orchestra', 'providing', 'musical', 'cues', 'audience', 'reaction', 'even', 'see', 'people', 'talking', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'slowly', 'intermittently', 'sound', 'effects', 'appear', 'involving', 'cars', 'doors', 'walking', 'note', 'when', 'first', 'person', 'steps', 'police', 'van', 'hear', 'footsteps', 'none', 'who', 'follow', 'immediately', 'eventually', 'hear', 'talking', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'mouths', 'moving', 'Then', 'moment', 'when', 'actors', 'speak', 'hear', 'words', 'mouths', 'then', 'full', 'sound', 'sound', 'effects.One', 'stars', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'who', 'was', 'immortalized', 'Captain', 'Hook', '1960s', 'TV', 'version', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'piano', 'sings', 'not', 'faked', 'thats', 'really', 'masterful', 'Hitch', 'yes', 'wonderful', 'cameo', 'true', 'star', 'camera', 'shots', 'body', 'parts', 'action', 'suggested', 'murder', 'knife', 'place', 'curtain', 'suggestive', 'surprisingly', 'when', 'star', 'Anny', 'Ondra', 'modestly', 'screen', 'watch', 'cutaway', 'Seeing', 'taking', 'off', 'clothes', 'seeing', 'undergarments', 'are', 'lifted', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'scandalous', 'England', 'still', 'possessed', 'Victorian', 'morals.The', 'story', 'simple', 'shopkeeper', 'daughter', 'Ondra', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'detective', 'boyfriend', 'Frank', 'Webber', 'John', 'Longdon', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'police', 'work', 'dinner', 'date', 'had', 'secretly', 'arranged', 'meet', 'man', 'artist', 'Ritchard', 'who', 'back', 'place', 'see', 'paintings', 'rape', 'grabs', 'bread', 'knife', 'him.The', 'detective', 'quickly', 'determines', 'killer', 'evidence', 'criminal', 'who', 'witnessed', 'enough', 'engage', 'little', 'blackmail', 'plot.The', 'film', '86', 'minutes', 'suffers', 'mild', 'deterioration', 'largely', 'watchable', 'fascinating', 'especially', 'Hitch', 'fans', 'interior', 'shots', 'British', 'museum', 'are', 'awesome', 'consider', 'lighting', 'requirements', 'get', 'shots', 'was', 'also', 'struck', 'extraordinary', 'feel', 'transition', 'silent', 'talkie', 'Imagine', 'being', 'theatre', '1929', 'experiencing', 'that.Wow']",N/A
