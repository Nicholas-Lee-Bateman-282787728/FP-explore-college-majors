671117,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B00005O078,James Morris,"[4, 5]","After shelling my hard-earned money for this film at a premium price, I discovered that the DVD has no extras - no deleted scenes, no director's commentary, no trailers, no foreign subtitles, and no closed captioning.  And boy, could it use closed captioning!  The sound quality is so poor that half the dialogue is inaudible; the writing is so bad that you wish the rest of it were also.The acting is completely amateur, and there is not a single laugh or a plausible line in the whole script.  The film is shot on videotape (like a porno film) and doesn't look very good at all.  Oh, and the box somehow failed to mention that the whole thing runs barely 65 minutes - what a gyp!  It wouldn't have been worth a budget pricing of less than ten dollars; at the price I paid, this film was a total rip-off!  Please save your money!  If you want a fun gay Christmas movie, go for 24 Nights instead.This film was the second-worst gay film I've ever seen, following closely on the heels of Ben & Arthur (another dismal offering from the distributors, Culture Q Connection).  Both films are serious contenders for the title of worst movie ever made.No one can convince me that the three four-star reviews appearing here were not planted by friends of the producer / director.
