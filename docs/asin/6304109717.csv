Then again, I went to school in a much smaller city.Plot : Good guy merc temps for girlfriend teacher when school gangs break her kneecap.It's a good film, with some above average acting and an inevetable ending. To our Hollywood trained eyes, the fights may seem slow; the film wasn't sped up, as is usualy the case for filming fight scenes. I personaly like this; not everyone will. It has some funny scenes, mostly intentional; but these days the big car phone with the cord qualifies as funny too.The following isn't really a criticism, but more of an observation about it as a standard action flick; there arn't any real spoilers, but if you've never seen it you may want to skip this part and rent it, so you can watch with unbiased eyes:The bad guys are typical bad guys, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever to make them people. The mercs are fairly mercenary, only the leader thinks taking on a job guarding drug deals is a bad idea. The teachers are uniformly dedicated (except they only show 2 teachers and a librarian) and even with all the gunfire at school the police never do show up on screen. Everything is clear-cut, straightforward and easy to understand.

I am a big fan of Tom Berenger. He wasn't the problem in The Substitute. Neither was the rest of the cast. They were all decent and gave credible performances. It's the logic the film that kills my brain. Where are the teachers? You can't honestly have me to believe only three teachers work for the school. No assistant principals? No counselors? No anyone else? I used to work in a high school, and believe me, there is always a large personnel for a school like that. A gang of mercenaries working on a dinky rinky high school? Are we in the high school age of Miami Vice? I was fine with Class of 1984 which was a masterpiece of its genre. But, this? I don't think so.

401974,A2IY9M330NKBW6,6304109717,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","It's frustrating to watch a film that could have been really good had the producer/director turned one way instead of another. This is one of those films.Here's the scoop. Johnathan Shale (Tom Berenger) is a mercenary who works with a set crew who are being ""retired."" He's at a loss as to what to do with his life when his girlfriend, a teacher at a tough Miami school, is kneecapped by a thug. He poses as her substitute so he can find out what's happening at the school, and why the head of the local gang (Marc Anthony) would want his girl out of commission.  What he finds is a big surprise.This starts out cool because he knows squat about teaching and begins to tread water, right from the get go, with his students. When he wakes up, and begins teaching in a way that connects with them, he becomes a local hero. Then when he sees the snakes in the pit, and recruits his buds to make things right, it degrades into a violent, shoot-em-up with a dose of revenge.The performances are decent enough as is the directing. This fails at the script level. The story pretty much says you need someone tough in the classroom, but someone who is not a bully. He relates his experiences in Viet Nam to help teach history from that period. As that war was still fresh in people's minds, the kids understand. Many of them were personally affected by it. So you now have discipline and communication. This comes as a surprise, as well as a relief, to both him and his students. They all now feel involved. It seems to be working, but then the gun play in the climax comes into being it all goes down the toilet. There was a really cheap line of dialogue near the end to explain why, with untold amounts of bullets fired, and explosives detonated, it took the police so long to arrive. It was just really stupid.For my dollar, they needed to stay the course in teaching and set up the evil doers to be apprehended without all the fire power. I think this would have sent the best message.

He and his gang of similarly disturbed vets plan to bust a major drug ring in the school and take off with the cash that the principal, played by Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson, is making selling coke to his students.  Of course, Shale gets very righteous and says it's not for the money in the end.This film ultimately delivers some quality violence as the high school is reduced to a war zone for a good ten minutes with not a cop, fireman, or ambulance in sight.  Lots of people die, at some points I actually couldn't even tell who was shooting at who, but it just didn't matter.  The gang is cleaned out of the school like a cancer, exterminated by Shale and thus gratifying his need to resolve the Vietnam conflict in his mind.Expect the requisite scene of him 'reaching' the troubled students one day by talking about war and being shot and then realizing that their urban ghetto is a warzone, too.  Expect quality character acting by William Forsythe as one of Shale's whacko vet buddies who's along for the ride, evoking images of his demented turn as Richie in Out for Justice.This movie will get the job done on a slow night.  The Substitute series is now a staple of late night cable, with Treat Williams playing another (psychotic) mercenary cleaning up trouble spots in our nation's schools.

The Principal is another good one.  It's one of those rare action movies that's very easily direct-to-video material yet managed to get a theatrical release, kinda like Thomas Ian Griffith's Excessive Force.  It's a hard movie not to like(unless you're a film snob) because it's one of those movies you wish would really happen.  C'mon, it's fun to watch a badass mercenary throw some gang bangers who think they're hot stuff out a second story library window.  Makes you wish teachers really could have the authority to pound up troublemakers.  Basically this merc poses as a teacher to get revenge for the beating of his girlfriend.  Cool enough.  Then it gets a little on the unrealistic side as he uncovers a more sinister plot brewing beneath the school.  SPOILER AHEAD:(But do you really care?  This is a cliche action flick and I'm sure you'll all see this ""twist"" coming or have  seen it done before.)  A mercenary out for revenge on a gang is somewhat believable, but the principal running a big scale drug operation out of the school is pushing it a little.  That and the fact that dead kids(and teachers) are turning up by the metric ton and the cops don't ever seem to notice.  But hey, this is an action film, no need to be that critical.  I also get a laugh out of these classroom scenes.  You know what I'm talking about:  Total chaos.  Kids blasting boomboxes, throwing stuff around and telling the teacher to ""&@$# off"".  I've never been to Miami or L.A.  Do some schools really look like this?  Berenger does a decent job as the hard, take-no-B.S. mercenary.  Everyone's favorite latin singer Marc Anthony plays a gang leader, and the always likable Ernie Hudson is cool as the corrupt principal.  Hudson can do a good bad guy when he wants to.  William ""Flatop"" Forsythe is always fun to watch and here he's no exception.  The Substitute is fun.  Sure it wasn't received all that well from the critics upon it's release, but critics don't really tend to watch movies for the sake of simply enjoying them.Check it out-No message, nothing deep or enlightening here just cheap, schlocky fun(like my ex-girlfriend).",4,Dangerous Minds With A Body Count.....And Tom Berenger,1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,2255,"['like', 'Substitute', 'like', 'movies', 'where', 'tough', 'dude', 'walks', 'nasty', 'gang', 'ruled', 'school', 'kicks', 'butt', 'Principal', 'good', 'one', 'one', 'rare', 'action', 'movies', 'very', 'easily', 'direct-to-video', 'material', 'yet', 'managed', 'get', 'theatrical', 'release', 'kinda', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Griffith', 'Excessive', 'Force', 'hard', 'movie', 'not', 'like', ""'re"", 'film', 'snob', 'one', 'movies', 'wish', 'would', 'really', 'happen', ""C'mon"", 'fun', 'watch', 'badass', 'mercenary', 'throw', 'gang', 'bangers', 'who', 'think', ""'re"", 'hot', 'stuff', 'second', 'story', 'library', 'window', 'Makes', 'wish', 'teachers', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'authority', 'pound', 'up', 'troublemakers', 'Basically', 'merc', 'teacher', 'get', 'revenge', 'beating', 'girlfriend', 'Cool', 'enough', 'Then', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'side', 'more', 'sinister', 'plot', 'brewing', 'school', 'SPOILER', 'AHEAD', 'do', 'really', 'care', 'cliche', 'action', 'flick', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'see', 'twist', 'coming', 'have', 'seen', 'done', 'before', 'mercenary', 'out', 'revenge', 'gang', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'principal', 'running', 'big', 'scale', 'drug', 'operation', 'school', 'pushing', 'little', 'fact', 'dead', 'kids', 'teachers', 'are', 'turning', 'up', 'metric', 'ton', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seem', 'notice', 'hey', 'action', 'film', 'need', 'be', 'critical', 'also', 'get', 'laugh', 'classroom', 'scenes', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Total', 'chaos', 'Kids', 'blasting', 'boomboxes', 'throwing', 'stuff', 'telling', 'teacher', '@', 'off', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Miami', 'L.A.', 'Do', 'schools', 'really', 'look', 'Berenger', 'decent', 'job', 'hard', 'take-no-B.S', 'mercenary', 'Everyone', 'favorite', 'latin', 'singer', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'gang', 'leader', 'always', 'likable', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'cool', 'corrupt', 'principal', 'Hudson', 'can', 'do', 'good', 'bad', 'guy', 'when', 'William', 'Flatop', 'Forsythe', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'here', 'exception', 'Substitute', 'fun', 'Sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'received', 'well', 'critics', 'release', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'tend', 'watch', 'movies', 'sake', 'simply', 'enjoying', 'them.Check', 'out-No', 'message', 'nothing', 'deep', 'enlightening', 'here', 'just', 'cheap', 'schlocky', 'fun', 'ex-girlfriend']",The Substitute VHS

Tom Berenger eschews the angry racist persona he brought to life so ably in &quot;Platoon&quot; for a different man of action, in this case, Shales, a professional soldier with a heart and a brain.  Besieged and assaulted by teenybopper thugs who work for the local drug kingpin, his teacher girlfriend turns to the only man who might be able to stop them, forcing Shales to go undercover as a substitute teacher to root out the source of the problems.  While the script is fantasy and has very little to do with teaching, and the production values are on the &quot;B&quot; side, the able cast--including Ernie Hudson, William Forsythe, Richard Brooks, and many other familiar faces--plays it with just the right amount of humor and zeal.

401992,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,6304109717,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 1]","""FX"" director Robert Mandel's urban crime thriller ""The Substitute"" fuses elements of ""Blackboard Jungle"" with ""The Equalizer."" In ""Blackboard Jungle,"" a teacher (Glenn Ford) tangled with savage, inner-city youth. In the CBS-TV thriller series ""The Equalizer,"" an urban security expert allowed his clients to resume life without fear from assailants.Tom Berenger stars as a covert operations specialist on holiday who finds himself back into the classroom to rumble with a drug czar and his killers. The action is as fast and as furious as one of the submachine guns fired in this larger-than-life, but exciting exercise in educational reform. Mandel and ""Street Trash"" scenarist Roy Frumkes, ""Substitute 2"" scribe Rocco Simonelli, and ""Cat People"" writer Alan Ormsby have created an entertaining, suspenseful, sometimes amusing, melodrama with a minor surprise or two. ""Ghost Busters"" star Ernie Hudson registers splendidly as a corrupt high school principal who abuses his authority by allowing sales of narcotics on his premises.An earnest, forthright teacher Jane Hetzko (Diane Venora of ""True Crime"") confronts high-ranking gang-banger Juan Lacas (Marc Anthony of ""Hackers"") during a campus brawl, and he doesn't like the way that she talks to him so he threatens her. Later, as Jane is jogging by herself along the beach, a thuggish Seminole confronts her and cracks one of her knee caps with a bat. Jane's off-again, on-again boyfriend Jonathan Shale (Tom Berenger of the ""Sniper"" movies)tangles briefly with the brute before the brute escapes. Jane lands in the hospital and Shale takes care of her. Shale calls for Jane's usual substitute, but the man isn't available. Instead, Shale gets one of his mercenary buddies, Rem (Luis Guzm&aacute;n of ""Anger Management""), to put him into the school's computer system as James Smith with three diplomas from prestigious Ivy League universities.Shale has the time to devote to Jane's problem, because his men and he have completed a mission that attracted too much international attention and he has to cool it for a while. Meantime, he keeps his surviving commandos in line and out of harm's way. A job to guard drug shipments comes up, but once our virtuous hero learns that he would be killing to ensure the safe passage of narcotics, he turns the job down cold and reprimands his comrade, Joey 6 (Raymond Cruz of ""The Rock"") for setting up the interview.Instead, Shale masquerades as a substitute school teacher when he cannot get an actual substitute for Jane. He assembles his team and tells them that where drugs are concerned, money can be found in large quantities. This serves as their inducement to mobilize their special skills. Along the way, another caring teacher, Mr. Darrell Sherman (Glenn Plummer of ""Saw 2"") gets in the way of the villains, particularly Claude Rolle (Ernie Hudson of ""Ghost Busters"") and pays the ultimate price. The heroes and the villains turn the high school into a battlefield. The villains have stashed a lifetime's worth of cocaine in the school's maintenance garage and Hollan (William Forsythe of ""Once Upon A Time in America"") rigs it up with explosives so when the bad guys go to retrieve it, they are blown up. Not all of the good guys survive this bullet-riddled shoot'em up. Raymond Cruz is quite good and William Forsythe plays another one of his hot-tempered maniacs.
