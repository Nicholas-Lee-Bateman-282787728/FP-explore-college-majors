20838,AGEIT17HENDIS,0767836286,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 2]","I have been on something of a tear lately in the wake of Jeff Bridges' Oscar victory this year for his portrayal of broken-down country singer/songwriter Bad Blake in the film Crazy Hearts. In my previous reviews my main premise had been that there was a strong thread running through many of Bridges' performances that harked back to his role as future good old boy, Duane Jackson, in the classic Texas-based coming of age film The Last Picture Show and that culminated in Crazy Hearts.This film, Arlington Road, speaks to another thread, the intrepid, if sometimes foolhardy warrior prince fighting against evil (or at least the unknown). A previous well-known example was Blow-Up where he held off the Irish Republican Army (IRA) single-handedly (well, one agent in Boston anyway). This political thriller filled a niche after the tragic Oklahoma City bombings by native terrorists and before the axis shifted to 9/11 type foreign-based acts of terror. Thus, the notion to put a microscope to view a small but extensively-engaged proto-survivalist right wing-conspiracy against the federal (or state for that matter) government for some grievances had a certain timeliness then.Bridges, as an undaunted professor, out to solve some baffling mystery (and also as a grieving victim of a governmental screw-up which killed his wife) that has cropped up and ensnared him in its web and Tim Robbins as the avenger bad angel and ensnarer battle this one out. Not Bridges' best performance because he is just too manic (and the script is a little too politically heavy-handed and obvious) in the end but kind of an interesting period piece just the same.

I know that it stars two of the better actors around and on of the best supporting ladies out there, and sure, the action is well paced and it has one unbelievably great ending, but when you stack up all the faults here it becomes apparent that this is not as good as it should have been.The film is smarter than it looks, but sadly it comes off rather dull thanks to uninspired direction.The film centers around Michael Faraday, a college professor teaching an American History class on terrorism.  His wife, a former FBI agent, was killed in the line of duty and the circumstances surrounding her death have thrown Michael into a state of seeming paranoia.  This paranoia is only heightened when he meets his next door neighbors Oliver and Cheryl.  They seem sweet enough, but there is just something off that raises concern in Michael.  Everything he talks to thinks he's crazy, but is he really?I don't want to give away too much, but the movie does that for you already.  That's one of my main concerns.  We are expected throughout the first half of the film to slip into Michael's paranoia with him, and feel that he is blowing things out of proportion; but Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack won't allow us to do that.  They play their characters with so much obvious `strangeness' that it's shocking Michael is the ONLY one who thinks they are terrorists.  I love both actors, but Cusack plays Cheryl like she were a joke really, and Robbins is so unconvincing as a `normal guy' that even when he supposedly convinces Michael he's not a terrorist all he manages to do is further convince us that he is.My second issue is with the whole middle of the film, and parts of the ending as well.  It goes from this `trying to be smart' psychological thriller into this `lets be stupid' action thriller that just throws off any real tension they were trying to build.  When Hope Davis hangs up the phone and sees Joan Cusack giving her that ridiculous smile I knew that the movie was just going down hill.Now, many have mentioned that the end of the film is intelligent and well done, and I agree.  The final frames are brilliant, but brilliant to a fault.  It's so smart that it makes me hate the balance of the film even more.Why would they waste such a marvelously thought out revelation on a poorly constructed B-Grade thriller?That said, Jeff Bridges works very, very hard to elevate this movie, and he manages to get us on his side throughout.  He is convincing, even when his surroundings are not.  We believe him, and so I hate to fault the film so much because he tries so hard.  Oh well, I still love him and I respect him for giving this a try.  It seemed good on paper I'm sure.  How was he to know that Cusack and Robbins were going to make a mockery of this script?  How were we to expect that a film starring some of the most impressive talents working today was going to be such a waste of potential?In other words; watch something else.",2,Get off the road; immediately...,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,3041,"['Okay', 'look', 'objectively', 'realize', 'not', 'good', 'Please', 'do', 'know', 'two', 'better', 'actors', 'best', 'supporting', 'there', 'sure', 'action', 'well', 'paced', 'one', 'unbelievably', 'great', 'ending', 'when', 'stack', 'up', 'faults', 'here', 'apparent', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'been.The', 'film', 'smarter', 'sadly', 'rather', 'dull', 'thanks', 'uninspired', 'direction.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Michael', 'Faraday', 'college', 'professor', 'teaching', 'American', 'History', 'class', 'terrorism', 'wife', 'former', 'FBI', 'agent', 'was', 'killed', 'line', 'duty', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'death', 'have', 'thrown', 'Michael', 'state', 'seeming', 'paranoia', 'paranoia', 'only', 'heightened', 'when', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'Oliver', 'Cheryl', 'seem', 'sweet', 'enough', 'just', 'something', 'off', 'concern', 'Michael', 'Everything', 'thinks', 'crazy', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'already', 'one', 'main', 'concerns', 'are', 'expected', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'slip', 'Michael', 'paranoia', 'feel', 'blowing', 'things', 'proportion', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'do', 'play', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'obvious', 'strangeness', 'shocking', 'Michael', 'ONLY', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'terrorists', 'love', 'actors', 'Cusack', 'Cheryl', 'were', 'joke', 'really', 'Robbins', 'so', 'unconvincing', 'normal', 'guy', 'even', 'when', 'supposedly', 'Michael', 'not', 'terrorist', 'do', 'further', 'convince', 'second', 'issue', 'whole', 'middle', 'film', 'parts', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'be', 'smart', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'lets', 'be', 'stupid', 'action', 'thriller', 'just', 'off', 'real', 'tension', 'were', 'trying', 'build', 'When', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'up', 'phone', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'giving', 'ridiculous', 'smile', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'down', 'hill.Now', 'many', 'have', 'mentioned', 'end', 'film', 'intelligent', 'well', 'done', 'agree', 'final', 'frames', 'are', 'brilliant', 'brilliant', 'fault', 'so', 'smart', 'hate', 'balance', 'film', 'even', 'more.Why', 'would', 'waste', 'marvelously', 'thought', 'out', 'revelation', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'B-Grade', 'thriller', 'said', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'elevate', 'movie', 'get', 'side', 'convincing', 'even', 'when', 'surroundings', 'are', 'not', 'believe', 'so', 'hate', 'fault', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'hard', 'Oh', 'well', 'still', 'love', 'respect', 'giving', 'try', 'seemed', 'good', 'paper', ""'m"", 'sure', 'How', 'was', 'know', 'Cusack', 'Robbins', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'mockery', 'script', 'How', 'were', 'expect', 'film', 'starring', 'most', 'impressive', 'talents', 'working', 'today', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'such', 'waste', 'potential', 'other', 'words', 'watch', 'something', 'else']",N/A

True, his character went through living hell with the death of his FBI agent  wife. Yet, seeing his performance reminded me of one of his earlier movie  roles as an alcoholic.Other performances were top notch and creepy to  say the least. Tim Robbins is one of those versatile actors who can play  either villain or hero without a hitch. Joan Cusack turns in an almost  evil-comical performance as a cross between a Stepford wife and June  Cleaver; kind of a lunatic mom with a warm apple pie in one hand up front  while concealing a blunt sharp object behind her for the kill. Though, her  character is far from benign I was surprised to see her use her usual  comical appeal for such an evil character with hidden agendas.After  seeing the featurette included on the dvd, I now understand the shocking  climax of the movie.

Sporting a star-studded cast, the film creates an aura of tension and suspense that keeps the audience glued to the screen. With a thought-twisting and surprising plotline, Arlington Road reinforces the post-September 11th (even though it's a 1999 movie) mentality that terrorists lurk around every corner. Tim Robbins puts in his best performance since appearing in the critically acclaimed Shawshank Redemption, and Jeff Bridges turns in a memorable performance himself. Both are fitting, since Arlington Road is a memorable movie...Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a college professor who specializes in studying homegrown terrorists in the United States. A resident of Northern Virginia, his FBI agent wife died in the midst of a botched Ruby Ridge-style government raid. With a ten-year-old son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark), to raise, Michael becomes an expert on the mindset and methods of terrorists such as Timothy McVeigh. Studying the terrorist threat becomes the central focus of his life, and its domination of his thoughts causes Michael to develop an acute form of paranoia.But when the Arlington Road (the street where Michael lives) house next door is purchased by Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), Michael's life begins to change for the better. The friendliness of his new neighbors creates new inroads in Michael's ability to coup with the loss of his wife, and Grant becomes best friends with the Langs' son Brady (Mason Gamble). Things are going smoothly between the Faradays and the Langs until Michael catches Oliver in a petty lie. Immediately, his paranoia kicks in, and as the Langs continue their strange behavior (such as hiding a set of blueprints from him), Michael's fears get the best of him.Investigating the background of the Langs, Michael finds out that they are not who they claim to be. In fact, Oliver is actually known as William Fenimore. Convinced that the Langs are planning an attack on the FBI headquarters (one on par with the Oklahoma City bombing), Michael attempts to convince his son, his colleagues, and anyone who will listen. But no one seems to understand. Will Michael convince the FBI before it's too late? Or is he only a delusional madman living out his paranoid fantasies in the aftermath of his wife's death?Wrought with suspense and peppered with hair-raising moments, Arlington Road is a unique and compelling film. The premise is befitting of a post-September 11th terrorist film, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hollywood remakes the film using Islamic terrorists instead of the homegrown brand from this movie. With a surprise ending which will keep you guessing until the end (and probably afterward since the whole thing tends to stretch the limits of reality), Arlington Road is a fun and interesting film. Possessing a well-maintained level of suspense and an interesting set of characters, Arlington Road is a definite must-see film...The DVD Report",3,"A hair-raising, yet plot-flawed film...",1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,3152,"['Winner', 'Nicholl', 'Fellowship', 'Screenwriting', 'competition', 'sponsored', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Arts', 'Sciences', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'only', 'sixth', 'winner', 'award', 'actually', 'make', 'big', 'screen', 'Sporting', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'film', 'aura', 'tension', 'suspense', 'audience', 'glued', 'screen', 'thought-twisting', 'surprising', 'plotline', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'post-September', '11th', 'even', '1999', 'movie', 'mentality', 'lurk', 'corner', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'best', 'performance', 'appearing', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'memorable', 'performance', 'are', 'fitting', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'memorable', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Faraday', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'studying', 'homegrown', 'terrorists', 'United', 'States', 'resident', 'Northern', 'Virginia', 'FBI', 'agent', 'wife', 'died', 'midst', 'botched', 'Ruby', 'Ridge-style', 'government', 'raid', 'ten-year-old', 'son', 'Grant', 'Spencer', 'Treat', 'Clark', 'raise', 'Michael', 'expert', 'mindset', 'methods', 'terrorists', 'such', 'Timothy', 'McVeigh', 'Studying', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'central', 'focus', 'life', 'domination', 'thoughts', 'Michael', 'develop', 'acute', 'form', 'paranoia.But', 'when', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'street', 'where', 'Michael', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'purchased', 'Oliver', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Cheryl', 'Lang', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Michael', 'life', 'change', 'better', 'friendliness', 'new', 'neighbors', 'new', 'inroads', 'Michael', 'ability', 'coup', 'loss', 'wife', 'Grant', 'best', 'friends', 'Langs', 'son', 'Brady', 'Mason', 'Gamble', 'Things', 'are', 'going', 'smoothly', 'Faradays', 'Langs', 'Michael', 'catches', 'Oliver', 'petty', 'lie', 'Immediately', 'paranoia', 'kicks', 'Langs', 'continue', 'strange', 'behavior', 'such', 'hiding', 'set', 'blueprints', 'Michael', 'fears', 'get', 'best', 'him.Investigating', 'background', 'Langs', 'Michael', 'out', 'are', 'not', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'fact', 'Oliver', 'actually', 'known', 'William', 'Fenimore', 'Convinced', 'Langs', 'are', 'planning', 'attack', 'FBI', 'headquarters', 'one', 'par', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'bombing', 'Michael', 'convince', 'son', 'colleagues', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'one', 'understand', 'Will', 'Michael', 'convince', 'FBI', 'too', 'late', 'only', 'delusional', 'madman', 'living', 'out', 'paranoid', 'fantasies', 'aftermath', 'wife', 'death', 'Wrought', 'suspense', 'peppered', 'hair-raising', 'moments', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'unique', 'compelling', 'film', 'premise', 'befitting', 'post-September', '11th', 'terrorist', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'using', 'Islamic', 'terrorists', 'instead', 'homegrown', 'brand', 'movie', 'surprise', 'ending', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'end', 'probably', 'afterward', 'whole', 'thing', 'stretch', 'limits', 'reality', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'fun', 'interesting', 'film', 'Possessing', 'well-maintained', 'level', 'suspense', 'interesting', 'set', 'characters', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

Tim Robbins turns in an engaging performance and always manages to keep a small part of me on his side- no matter how evil it may be. Jeff Bridges and his character's girlfriend were a little lacking, but Robbins and the ever-fabulous Joan Cusack more than made up for it. The kids in this movie were good too- exuding a strange ""Children of the Corn"" feel despite their limited screen time.Its a timely film as well in this era of fear and terrorism- pertaining more to the una-bomber and Oklahoma City and such internal militia groups or activists, than foreign attackers such as in the World Trade Center.I found it to be generally well rounded and acted. The cinematic style was appealing, and the story engaging. I loved the use of light in the scenes, and the mis-en-scene it could create. Also, the colors of the costumes and the use of metal and decor spoke to me on a different level than the script. Each detail was telling you some additional information.

20861,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,0767836286,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","It's not a coincidence that I almost grew to hate this film; it was filled with so many coincidences that you'll feel that way too after watching.From people mysteriously bumping into each other to others being killed in mysterious ways, I grew weary.  People intuitively know that some unlikely event is bound to happen in their lives occasionally, but if you take the odds of each event -- assuming that they are independent -- and multiply those odds by all the odds of the other unlikely events occurring. . . well, you reach a near impossibility.  And to me this movie was almost impossible.But what seems really impossible (if ""impossible"" could be a relative thing; do we really need the ""really"" part?):  how did this fine group of actors read this script and still decide to make a go of it?  That really boggles the mind.  From Jeff Bridges to Tim Robbins to Joan Cusack to Hope Davis, you'd think that at least one of them would have read the script and just said, ""Phooey!""  I never read the script and that's what I said afterwards after ""seeing"" the script in my mind.It seemed to me that Mr. Bridges played the liberal guy; after all, he was a college professor.  How many professors have you met that are conservative?  And Mr. Robbins was supposed to be the hard-core right wing nut job; after all, he had a dark past after having done some ""right wing"" things.  (I always find it amusing, if not exasperating, to always portray the right as a bomb-throwing bunch.  Just look at all of the left-wing nut jobs that come out and ""demonstrate peacefully"" by trashing small businesses, like what just happened with the Trayvon Martin verdict.  But Hollywood is so far left they always want to slam the right, even if it defies logic.)  But each of these two actor's actions seem to be contradictory, so after watching, I'm not sure what the director was trying to say.I believe that the ending was changed after the fact.  Why?  I won't tell you the ending -- you'll have to find out yourself if you are foolish enough to screen this big screen mess -- but I did a double take just before the credits rolled.  I believe that the director didn't buy all the coincidences himself, and so changed the story last minute so that he could wave all of those coincidences away with one hand.

Mark Pellington had taken a big step in the right direction with this one as he pits Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins against eachother as neighbors suspicious to the other's behavior.  For those of you who haven't seen the trailer - don't.  It gives away too much of the plot and seems intent on letting us know right away who the 'bad neighbor' is.  Bridges is an eccentric father, scared by the loss of his FBI agent wife, teaching a course on militant terrorist groups.  And since his wife's passing he's grown increasingly obsessed so when he begins to suspect his neighbors aren't who they seem, he's met with skepisism from his new girlfriend and FBI buddy Whitt.  Filling the roles of the all-too-perfect family are Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, who plays her role to melvolent perfection.  But are they terrorist?  After all, Bridges is the one with the motive, he blames the feds for his wife's death.  He's the one teaching these courses, he's the one growing increasingly more paranoid and the answers aren't revealed to the very end (which offers last years best twist ending in my opinion).  This movie is fabulous to look at, the photography catpures every nuance of these great actors faces which convey so much expression and unlying thoughtfulness.  The commentary track by Bridges and Pellington offers some of the best give and take moments in the short history of DVD.

The film sets you up to expect a kind of everyday, run-of-the-mill, suburban thriller.  But then, as Jeff Bridges descends into a passionate mission to discover the truth about his next-door neighbor, fueled by an intense yearning to honor his wife by studying the ""underground"" factions in the United States, the film develops into something unusual, intelligent, and exciting.  While the acting performance of Bridges tends to get a little over the top and heavy-handed (as it often does in other films), his intensity seems strangely appropriate for this film.  As the plot thickens and begins to burn, the audience is fueled by Bridges's emotion and anger, leading all the way up to the film's incredible climax.  Seriously folks, the ending is pretty killer and forces you to think back over the entire film.This film is not ""leftist"" propaganda and it is not a film that attacks the outer limits of the conservative right.  Director Mark Pellington manages to achieve a sense of moral ambiguity.  On the one hand, we feel for Jeff Bridges: we experience his anger at the government's lack of competence in dealing with violent acts of terrorism.  We too feel frustrated by the government's attempt to pacify its citizens and instill a sense of security.  On the other hand, we shy away from the extremist tendencies of Tim Robbins and understand a need to change the system from within.  A lack of responsibility and morality in government does not warrant a violent response against unsuspecting civilians.

While THE NEGOTIATOR was the surprise hit of 1998, ARLINGTON ROAD,  at least I hope so, is going to be the sleeper of 1999-2000.The first 10  minutes of the movie reveal a great filmmaker who knows how to create  uneasiness in the audience. Uneasiness is the adequate word to qualify the  state of mind of the viewer during the whole movie. ARLINGTON ROAD could  have been another film exploring the activities of the extremist groups  that have recently appeared in the U.S.A. but, fortunately, the movie is  more an above-average thriller than a political and social study.Secret  conspiracies are one of the themes Hollywood has treated by the dozen since  50 years ; communists, KKK, CIA, FBI, The Organisation, intellectuals and  martians's plots have been discovered and heavily punished by our favorite  heroes. It seems that there will always be a worm to be crushed in the  american apple.Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges give performances that will  linger a long time in my memory, along with the strange character played by  Joan Cusack.

20877,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0767836286,D. Litton,"[0, 1]","&quot;Arlington Road&quot; is a large breath of fresh air for the suspense genre, giving new life to the meaning of the word &quot;originality.&quot; It's full of splendid ideas and plot twists, it has an ensemble of characters that we care about and watch, and it has one of the best and most satisfying movie endings I've ever seen on film. It's a story of one man's battle against his not-so-nice neighbors while also being a personal battle as he sinks into the depths of paranoia and uncertainty.Right from the beginning, the movie begins packing in the chills. A small boy is walking down the center of a road with his hand severely bloodied and scorched, when he is snatched up by Michael Faraday, a resident of Arlington Road, and rushed off to the emergency room. The scene as a whole is charged with a unique blend of close-ups and unsettling bass impacts from the soundtrack which will set the tone for the rest of the movie. Faraday soon meets the boy's parents at the hospital, Oliver and Cheryl Lang, and converses with them about their son before returning to his home, where he confides to his girlfriend Brooke that he felt bad for not knowing the boy's name.As the movie progresses, it takes its time in revealing the climax that is to come. We learn that Faraday is a college professor who teaches a class on terrorism in America. He once was married to an FBI agent who was killed in a massacre of right wing activists in the woods. His memories haunt him at certain moments in the film, but instead of dragging it out, these memories serve as the reason for which Faraday becomes so wrapped up in the true history and character of his neighbors, the Langs.A mysterious letter addressed to someone of a different name also has Oliver's name on it, which leads Faraday to discover some secret blueprints when he returns the letter to his neighbor. He begins to become more uncertain and uncomfortable with the situation, and dives into a discreet investigation of Lang's past, discovering that he changed his name numerous times, and that he was once arrested for constructing pipe bombs on his father's farm. Whlie this heavily raises his suspicions of Oliver, Oliver is able to calm Faraday's notion that he is dangerous, and sets his mind at ease with an explanation of morality for his change of name.It is at this point that the film picks up to an incredible pace, but to tell you anymore would ruin the many surprises it has to offer. Brooke begins to realize that Michael may be right in his suspicions, which leads her into danger. Faraday is given the ultimate ultimatum by Oliver, who, by this point in the movie, has every aspect of his neighbor's life bugged and tapped. He is keeping close dibs on Faraday, and it is evident by this time that Faraday is not paranoid. What he knows can destroy his life, but he is about to become someone who will be remembered on a much grander scale, and in the ending, he will serve as a model for his own teachings and opinions.Throughout the whole movie, there is never a moment where we are not involved in some sort of race against time, in which Faraday must try to bring his criminal neighbors out into the open for the world to see. This allows for a highly introspective look at Faraday, who is seen as becoming obsessed with his notions and discoveries. The people in his life, his close friends and family, do not believe him when he tries to disclose his findings, so this leaves the intensity up to actor Jeff Bridges, who carries it on his shoulders with a stunning ability all his own.The story as a whole is highly original and complex, involving and impacting. It's really two stories rolled into one: one is the struggle of a man to stop a deadly event from happening, and another is the struggle of the same man to deal with what he finds out and make sure that he is correct and not passing false judgement.

The basis of the film lies in terrorism. Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), who teaches a class in extremists at a local university, begins to suspect his neighbors Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusak) of being more than what they appear. Faraday begins to find inconsistencies in the stories Oliver gives him and what the truth reveals and the story unfolds from there.Jeff Bridges did a good job, but with a lot of heavy breathing, which I'm sure was convey panic and fear, however it tended to get on my nerves. Also in his classes, he would be talking about terrorist groups and events which they clearly must not have been able to use actual names and places where true attacks occurred, so instead they showed the faces of people we all know, but gave them different names which was intriguing, but also somewhat distracting.Tim Robbins just did a wonderful job, and I was thrilled to see him in such a good film, joined by Joan Cusak who gave an worthy performance...and even though you didn't see a whole lot of their kids, they managed to carry off a definite spookiness that really added to the atmosphere and mood of that whole house. Something else that impressed me was that such a relatively small nucleus of a cast managed to pull off such an involved plot and storyline. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film.The ending which I won't give away, but have to let it be said that I thought it was incredibly thought provoking and perfect for the film. Couldn't have been a better ending and that's important. In many cases an ending can make or break the film.

20885,A3VQLTB724O77W,0767836286,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[4, 4]","A movie like Arlington Road would probably not be made today, given the impression of sensitivity to the events of September 11 that Hollywood would like to give.  That's a pity, because many of the points made by the movie are important and timely issues worth consideration.  As one of the characters, Professor Michael Faraday (portrayed by Jeff Bridges), is a college professor teaching a course on American Terrorism, the scriptwriters have the opportunity to delve into these issues in as much detail as any Hollywood movie ever could.  Issues of personal safety, of terrorist's motivation, and of government misconduct are discussed with some sophistication; few answers are provided and even the terrorists themselves are revealed as people in search of safety.  This is not to say that Arlington Road is sympathetic to mass murderers; but it shows us the complexities of the issues.  Ultimately the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad; but that's not known to the world at large.The acting is exceptional.  Tim Robbins has long been one of my favorite actors.  I've especially appreciated his concern for the quality of the scripts he chooses and I've managed to forgive him for Mission to Mars.  Here he is at his finest, never overacting but conveying extremes from geniality to ferocity, and his understated malice is comparable to none.  Jeff Bridges makes an excellent choice as his foil.  I've tended to underrate Bridges as an actor--he certainly hasn't exercised the judgement of Robbins where scripts are concerned--but with movies such as The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Vanishing, and the Fischer King he's proven his worth.  Here he does indulge a bit in overacting, but for the most part is very convincing.Director Mark Pellington deserves much of the film's credit, beyond that of the acting and script.  Camerawork is terrific, and the whole is suffused with a sense of style and a personal vision that points the movie to its stunning conclusion.  That neither Bridges nor Robbins are Superstar Icons with Tom Cruise-like looks or Schwarzenegger-esque muscles makes the film all the more believable.Finally, the music by Angelo Badalamenti (of Twin Peaks fame) perfectly assists in creating the dramatic sense.

The film begins with Jeff Bridges's character finding a young man wandering down his street bleeding from apparent wounds from explosives. He rushes him to the hospital and is thanked heartily by the boy's parents (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), who have recently moved in on Bridges's street. Bridges portrays a college professor who teaches about conspiracies, about terrorism and modern society. His own wife had been killed in the line of duty (CIA operative), and this left him with a lot of bitterness and a son to rear on his own. As Bridges gets to know his new neighbours, he grows more and more suspicious of them and starts to delve deeper into their past. Bridges's girlfriend (played by Hope Davis) finds his suspicions to be paranoid and unfounded. However, the more he learns the more alarmed he is. He finds that these people are not at all who they claim to be. Of course it does not take long before the neighbours discover that he is digging into their lives. In fact, you get the feeling that they knew he would. Bridges is the perfect dupe and will eventually take the fall for unspeakable acts carried out by Robbins and his cohorts.

The script is good, the direction is good... but the movie as a whole left me empty and a little irritated.It's unclear what this film would like to do, aside from entertain. Should we walk out feeling that terrorists are much more complex than they seem? Should we walk out feeling unsafe and suspecting everyone? There are scenes in this movie where Jeff Bridges is teaching a class in terrorism, and he talks about how illusory our feeling of safety is... and that's fine, but I wanted one of the students to ask ""So what do you want us to do? Be afraid? Worry? Never leave the house? What?"" In that way the movie seems to want to just stir up a lot of fear without giving it any direction or offering any possible solution. Of course there ISN'T a solution, but I feel that this movie stirs up a lot of fear and paranoia just to draw the audience into some excitement, and then makes the audience feel bad for being excited by such a thing. I felt manipulated and annoyed after it ended.I also think this entire subject is a little too sensitive to be trying to milk entertainment dollars out of. If you want to make a serious drama, go ahead, but don't try to both draw us in with the promise of ""spooky terrorist thrills"" and then want to have a serious look at the issue. I was also a little bit uncomfortable with the sheer number of children-in-extreme-peril scenes. Again, if you want to treat this subject seriously, go ahead, but don't invite us to be ""thrilled"" by it.I will say that the cinematography [by Bobby Bukowski] in this film was amazing. It makes SUCH a difference simply to have some visually interesting compositions up on the screen for once, instead of having movies that have all the compositional thought of snapshots. It just gives you something to LOOK at. My favorite scenes were the one with the RED phones against the grey sky, and the fence with the grey roofs above it. Amazing! Kudos to you, guys! This was literally my favorite part of the movie.As for the ""surprise"" ending-- Woo Hoo, Big Deal.I have come to like this movie less and less since I saw it [and that was pre-9/11].

I was instantly intrigued by Arlington Road's professionality and its love for its characters. It really likes to play with your mind and even in the first few minutes or so, Arlington Road's twists and turns give you the chillie willies.  The movie explores the characters and their emotions before going into the thrills, and it worked like a charm. I wish all thrillers were like this, but Arlington Road is a rare kind, it's unique, brilliantly made and amazingly scripted. The mood and atmosphere of Arlington Road is creepy and misty and the way above-average techno horror soundtrack matches all the chilling sequences is neat. The performances are outstanding, with Jeff Bridges giving an excellent performance of a man who's paranoia is slowing killing him, while Tim Robbins is wonderfully evil and mysterious as the not-so-nice next door neighbour. Joan Cusack is a great supporting character but she should've had more to do with the evil side of things. The movie has one of the most chilling opening sequences of 1999 and the climax is brilliant and gut-punching and it is one of the best in any movie of any year. The movie scared the nachos out of me and definitely made me think about my next door neighbours. The film's goals are certainly achieved and as far as I know, it is highly praised by critics and viewers. The script is written by Ehren Kruger who also wrote Scream 3. I loved that movie but not half as much as I love this one. Ehren has done a bang-up job on his script and he packs in plenty of depth, chills and tension.

20901,A1725KPO7A5ULX,0767836286,"Jesse Kornbluth ""Head Butler""","[38, 44]","Noon. A suburb of Washington, DC, a street dotted with houses just a shade too small to be McMansions. No one is around.Wait --- here comes someone. A boy. White, of course. About 9 years old. Dressed in jeans and high-top sneakers. Walking unsteadily in the middle of the street. Lurching, really.And now we see why: blood dots his sneakers, makes a trail on the pavement.Luckily, a resident comes along --- Michael Faraday (yes, he has the same name as the great scientist who experimented with electricity and magnetism). He scoops the boy up, rushes him to the hospital. Eventually, the boy's parents show up, grateful beyond measure that the rocket their son set off wasn't more powerful --- and that they have such a good neighbor.And now we see the opening credits: distorted photos of suburban life. They look anything but peaceful. Clever movie lovers will recall shots like this in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet."" Clearly, something evil thrives alongside the barbeques.But how could that be? Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a history professor who teaches college courses in terrorism. He's widowed --- his wife was an FBI agent, killed in a botched raid --- and only recently dating a graduate student (Hope Davis). All he wants is to raise his nine-year-old son and find some peace.And the neighbors, Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) and his wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack) couldn't be nicer. They sense Faraday's loneliness, and they take steps --- inviting him over, including his son in their family outings.Until, one day.....right, the Langs are too perfect. Faraday senses that when a letter for Lang is wrongly delivered to his mailbox. It's forwarded from the University of Pennyslvania., Odd. Didn't Lang say he went to Kansas State?And so it begins: a neighbor furtively investigating his neighbor. And finding that there's something wrong in his story, that he may not be who he says he is.At the same time, Faraday is teaching his class. That bombing in St. Louis (really, the Oklahoma City bombing). Scary, wasn't it? But remember how much better you felt the next day, when the FBI produced a single suspect: ""We want one man, one name, and we want it fast because we want our security back.""Here's the problem with Farraday: He may teach terrorism, but he's a lousy detective. That is, his suspect knows what's going on. And confronts him. There's a scene in Faraday's back yard that's as menacing as any conversation on film: Faraday looking at a college year book that proves Lang has changed his name, Lang sneaking up on him. And then the reversal of expectation: It's Lang who's mad. Because he has an explanation, a damned good one. And if Faraday only had the decency to ask....What's happening? Faraday can't tell. Is Lang really a structural engineer working on a mall in Reston? Or is he a leader of a terrorist cell plotting mass murder in Washington?Then Faraday's girlfriend sees....Then Faraday's girlfriend rushes to a pay phone...Then Faraday's girlfriend turns around....The secret of thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock explained, is to give people a fear bigger than the fears they live with every day. Movies with special effects and ridiculous plots do this poorly. Movies based on brilliant ""what ifs?"" make you pee your pants. Like ""Rosemary's Baby"" --- what if a man makes a deal with Satan? Or ""Arlington Road"" --- what if your neighbor is Satan?There are critics who have called ""Arlington Road"" overheated and improbable --- especially the end. Well, it fooled me. And terrified me. The cinematography, the music, the rising paranoia of Bridges, the spookily friendly Robbins and Cusack: all the elements work together to make you scared of parking lots, mini-vans, the repairman outside your house.As for the end, it forces you to reexamine everything.

The movie adeptly plays on our paranoia -- who WOULDN'T be suspicious of the robotically smiling Tim  Robbins and Joan Cusack, let alone their daughter who apparently stepped  out of  &quot;Children of the Corn&quot;  to slum it in the suburbs?  The  set-up is wacky:  this creepy family moves in next-door to a professor of  terrorism  (portrayed by Jeff Bridges).  The overplotted movie soon renders  that coincidence less stunning.  I found myself doubting that the suburban  terrorists could so easily jerk our hero around like a puppet.  As played  (brilliantly, in my opinion)  by Bridges, this character is too high-strung  and downright mentally disturbed to be manipulated into pursuing his own  investigation of his neighbors . . . I mean, this guy looks as if he can  barely tie his shoes.  Bridges'  performance makes you uncomfortable  because his grief over his dead wife is real in an ugly, non-leading-man  way.  It's a brave job.  Robbins, on the other hand, with his militia  haircut and monotone voice doesn't convey normalcy for one second -- it's a  typical  &quot;villain&quot;  portrayal.  Acting like a real human being  would've profited the film, adding to the suspense:  as in, is he a  terrorist or isn't he?  Bridges, with his roiling eyeballs and sweaty face,  is the prime source of suspense herein.The ending, by the way, is a  cheap shot.

I started thinking about this movie recently when reading about more terror propaganda in the UK.  I was reminded of an article in the papers that described one of the 7/7 bombers as just a ""normal, average guy"" who had a regular job and loved soccer, ""just like many other young Britons, his neighbors said"".That really hits home when you watch Arlington Road.  Everybody should be aware that THEY, too, can be manipulated to ""carry the bomb into the building.""  The references to Ruby Ridge and The OK bombing in the movie reflect the time it was made/released, but it is even more meaningful after 911.The movie may seem to begin a bit slowly - that was my initial impression - and it was only afterward that I realized that this was a perfect metaphor for how ""normal life"" can totally mask what is really going on. But don't worry, it soon grabs you by the throat and doesn't let you go until the final, horrifying revelations at the end.Jeff Bridges plays his part very well - a guy so blinded by emotion that he is putty in the hands of cold-blooded manipulators.  Bridges (as the hero) thinks he's got a handle on what's going on, but in fact, this is hubris. One could say the same for most ""conspiracy theorists.""  You only know what ""they"" want you to know or figure out.Some people think the plot is too complex, too far-fetched, but I think that's not the case.  You don't need much imagination to see how such an elaborate set-up could easily be achieved in anyone's life.  There are plenty of movies that talk about that aspect of things.  The only thing is, they all make it seem like such dramatic, high adventure, that we forget that it is the mundane, the ordinary, the ho-hum existence, that veils truly evil things.The psychological slamming is all there at the end and that's exactly it; how it MUST be in real life.  Life is so ""ordinary, so boring, so tedious, so commonplace, that it lulls us into complacency.  And that is undoubtedly what the filmmaker was trying to convey... that sense of ordinariness, mundane life that covers another reality of conspiracy and evil-doing.For example, only AFTER the end of the movie do you realize that the bleeding kid at the beginning was all part of the set-up, that the terrorist/parents actually used their own child as bait, and even caused a severe injury to the child in order to make that bait more compelling.  Was the kid brain-washed or terrorized?  Probably.  What kind of monsters would do that to a child?And that makes the final scene even more chilling, where the terrorists stand there in front of the house for sale and wear their ""mask of sanity,"" saying the world is getting too scary...Yes, the good guys die and the bad guys continue on... but then, isn't that reality?",5,Realistic and Shocking!,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,2893,"['movie', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'watch', 'watched', 'years', 'ago', 'several', 'times', 'Everytime', 'impactful', 'started', 'thinking', 'movie', 'recently', 'when', 'reading', 'about', 'more', 'terror', 'propaganda', 'UK', 'was', 'reminded', 'article', 'papers', 'described', 'one', '7/7', 'bombers', 'as', 'just', 'normal', 'average', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'regular', 'job', 'loved', 'soccer', 'just', 'many', 'other', 'young', 'Britons', 'neighbors', 'said', 'really', 'home', 'when', 'watch', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'Everybody', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'THEY', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'carry', 'bomb', 'building', 'references', 'Ruby', 'Ridge', 'OK', 'bombing', 'movie', 'reflect', 'time', 'was', 'made/released', 'even', 'more', 'meaningful', '911.The', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'begin', 'bit', 'slowly', 'was', 'initial', 'impression', 'was', 'only', 'afterward', 'realized', 'was', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'how', 'normal', 'life', 'can', 'totally', 'mask', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'soon', 'grabs', 'throat', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'final', 'horrifying', 'revelations', 'end.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'guy', 'so', 'blinded', 'emotion', 'putty', 'hands', 'cold-blooded', 'manipulators', 'Bridges', 'hero', 'got', 'handle', 'what', 'going', 'fact', 'hubris', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'most', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'only', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'know', 'figure', 'out.Some', 'people', 'think', 'plot', 'too', 'complex', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'think', 'not', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'imagination', 'see', 'how', 'such', 'elaborate', 'set-up', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'achieved', 'anyone', 'life', 'are', 'plenty', 'movies', 'talk', 'aspect', 'things', 'only', 'thing', 'make', 'seem', 'such', 'dramatic', 'high', 'adventure', 'forget', 'mundane', 'ordinary', 'ho-hum', 'existence', 'truly', 'evil', 'things.The', 'psychological', 'slamming', 'there', 'end', 'exactly', 'how', 'MUST', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'Life', 'so', 'ordinary', 'so', 'boring', 'so', 'tedious', 'so', 'commonplace', 'complacency', 'undoubtedly', 'what', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'sense', 'ordinariness', 'mundane', 'life', 'reality', 'conspiracy', 'evil-doing.For', 'example', 'only', 'end', 'movie', 'do', 'realize', 'bleeding', 'kid', 'beginning', 'was', 'part', 'set-up', 'terrorist/parents', 'actually', 'used', 'own', 'child', 'bait', 'even', 'caused', 'severe', 'injury', 'child', 'order', 'make', 'bait', 'more', 'compelling', 'Was', 'kid', 'brain-washed', 'terrorized', 'Probably', 'What', 'kind', 'monsters', 'would', 'do', 'child', 'final', 'scene', 'even', 'more', 'chilling', 'where', 'terrorists', 'stand', 'there', 'front', 'house', 'sale', 'wear', 'mask', 'sanity', 'saying', 'world', 'getting', 'too', 'scary', 'Yes', 'good', 'guys', 'die', 'bad', 'guys', 'continue', 'then', ""n't"", 'reality']",N/A

Ultimately I bought it because I'm a Jeff Bridges fan.It's been several days since I watched this movie, and I can't stop thinking about all the implications of the events that transpired in this movie.  I keep stringing together ""what about this . . ."" and ""what ifs . . ."" that go way beyond the movie itself and enter into my everyday life -- the terrorism that has crept into all of our lives since 9/11.I think what is scariest about this movie is the idea that such an educated person could be so easily manipulated and used as a tool for a terrorist group.  If a man who lectures about the perils of terrorism to his students in such a thought-provoking way can be sucked into such a horrible scheme, how do we less-educated or less-perceptive individuals avoid such dangers?  As a parent, I honestly could see myself reacting exactly the same way to the boy in the street, to my child wanting to be included and have more friends, and ultimately to doing anything to protect my child who is in danger.I used to wonder how any rational human being could be sucked into these terrorist groups to the point of turning against their own country.  After watching this movie, it seems like it would be just a matter of finding a person's trigger point.  That scares me.I will be more vigilant and watchful now, more than ever before, but . . .

20922,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0767836286,magellan,"[1, 2]","Another good, although very dark, edgy and bleak, Jeff bridges movie.Bridges plays a poli-sci prof who is actually teaching a course in international terrorism, when he begins to discover evidence that his neighbor, whom he initially befriends and seems quite normal (played by Tim Robbins), isn't who he says he is, and might even be a terrorist himself.Bridges becomes obsessed with finding out who Robbins really is, and the evidence Bridges uncovers seems to point to his being a terrorist who is planning an attack on a building somewhere in Washington DC. The evidence is very circumstantial, however, and at first we might be inclined to conclude Bridges is just too sensitive and paranoid about the subject. He discusses the evidence with his girlfriend and another friend who is an agent at the FBI, and they don't find Bridges' evidence as convincing, and in fact both of them think he's just being overly paranoid, and needs to get over it.Bridges won't give up, however, and finally, in the last quarter of the movie, it becomes obvious that Robbins really is a bad guy and is definitely plotting something. Bridges sets out to stop him but in an ironic twist of fate, Robbins swaps cars with him and Bridges, unaware of the fact that Robbins has put the bomb in the trunk of Bridges' car, drives to the FBI building to warn everybody and thus becomes the unwitting accomplice in the tragedy. The bomb blows up, killing Bridges and hundreds of people in the building.Another dark side to the movie is how Bridges gets blamed for the disaster in the press, where he is portrayed as an unstable, dangerous, obsessed wacko, rather than as a concerned teacher who was just trying to warn everybody.Overall a good, although as I said, very dark, bleak, edgy and ultimately probably depressing film. The good guy dies, he fails to prevent the tragedy, and both his wife (who is killed in an earlier botched FBI raid) and his girlfriend are also dead.

The name of the director was without any doubt promising. Despite the demanding label of &quot;political thriller&quot;, having taken into consideration all the ingredients above, I was convinced that Arlington Road would offer me an enjoyable time.I admit that I finished viewing the movie with a feeling of disappointment and disbelief. To be fair, there is not doubt that Arlington Road provides a great dosage of suspense throughout its duration. But if you make the mistake and try to think of what you just saw, after the end titles, everything seems to fall apart.The basic character of our story is Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges). He is working as a professor of political history, with terrorism being its main focus. This, combined with the loss of his wife caused by a wrong judgment by FBI, renders him particularly sensitive to relevant stimuli. We can sense from the beginning that his fragile psyche will play an important role as the story evolves. After a strong opening sequence we see Faraday developing friendly relations with his new neighbors. Until the day an unexpected event puts doubts in his clouded mind. The question is clear: Are his neighbors involved in a terrorist group? That was it. Arlington Road now resorts to a series of easy clich&eacute;s. Its obvious purpose is to surprise the viewer with the known plot twist of the neighbor who is not as innocent as we thought at the beginning - or could he be innocent, after all?Tim Robbins gives a satisfactory performance in the role of the mysterious neighbor. On the other hand, Jeff Bridges, whose role as the &quot;Dude&quot; in Big Lebowski was absolutely amazing, here constantly gave me an impression of being over the top: his performance featured numerous hysteric reactions and grimaces. Some viewers may explain them based on Faraday's unstable mental condition; nevertheless they failed to convince me.Director Mark Pellington does a more than adequate job with the script he has in his hands. Still, he is capable for a lot more things as revealed by his next and undoubtedly better creation, Mothman Prophecies.I will conclude with a short comment regarding the highly praised film's closing sequence. Without revealing anything, here is what crossed my mind when watching it: Each of the terrorists should have had at least 3 Ph.D. degrees in Psychology. Only such collected knowledge would enable them to predict with the shown accuracy the reactions of so many people on so many occasions. If that was not the case, then I hope that they purchased a few lottery tickets the same day, since their success would have been certain!",2,Arlington Road should have done a lot better than this,1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,2714,"['friends', 'opinions', 'were', 'positive', 'leading', 'cast', 'added', 'sense', 'insurance', 'name', 'director', 'was', 'doubt', 'promising', 'demanding', 'label', 'quot', 'political', 'thriller', 'quot', 'having', 'taken', 'consideration', 'ingredients', 'was', 'convinced', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'would', 'offer', 'enjoyable', 'time.I', 'admit', 'finished', 'viewing', 'movie', 'feeling', 'disappointment', 'disbelief', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'doubt', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'great', 'dosage', 'suspense', 'duration', 'make', 'mistake', 'try', 'think', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'end', 'titles', 'everything', 'fall', 'apart.The', 'basic', 'character', 'story', 'Michael', 'Faraday', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'working', 'professor', 'political', 'history', 'terrorism', 'being', 'main', 'focus', 'combined', 'loss', 'wife', 'caused', 'wrong', 'judgment', 'FBI', 'particularly', 'sensitive', 'relevant', 'stimuli', 'can', 'sense', 'beginning', 'fragile', 'psyche', 'will', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'story', 'evolves', 'strong', 'opening', 'sequence', 'see', 'Faraday', 'developing', 'friendly', 'relations', 'new', 'neighbors', 'day', 'unexpected', 'event', 'doubts', 'clouded', 'mind', 'question', 'clear', 'Are', 'neighbors', 'involved', 'terrorist', 'group', 'was', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'now', 'series', 'easy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'obvious', 'purpose', 'surprise', 'viewer', 'known', 'plot', 'twist', 'neighbor', 'who', 'not', 'as', 'innocent', 'thought', 'beginning', 'could', 'be', 'innocent', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'satisfactory', 'performance', 'role', 'mysterious', 'neighbor', 'other', 'hand', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'role', 'quot', 'Dude', 'quot', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'here', 'constantly', 'gave', 'impression', 'being', 'top', 'performance', 'featured', 'numerous', 'hysteric', 'reactions', 'grimaces', 'viewers', 'may', 'explain', 'based', 'Faraday', 'unstable', 'mental', 'condition', 'failed', 'convince', 'me.Director', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'more', 'adequate', 'job', 'script', 'hands', 'Still', 'capable', 'lot', 'more', 'things', 'revealed', 'next', 'undoubtedly', 'better', 'creation', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies.I', 'will', 'conclude', 'short', 'comment', 'regarding', 'highly', 'praised', 'film', 'closing', 'sequence', 'revealing', 'anything', 'here', 'what', 'crossed', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'terrorists', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'least', '3', 'Ph.D.', 'degrees', 'Psychology', 'Only', 'such', 'collected', 'knowledge', 'would', 'enable', 'predict', 'shown', 'accuracy', 'reactions', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'occasions', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'then', 'hope', 'purchased', 'few', 'lottery', 'same', 'day', 'success', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'certain']",N/A

20925,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767836286,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","I love a great thriller. While Arlington Road is not a great one, it's a decent one. It suffers from a modern-day Hollywood plague I have dubbed The Plot Virus. This malady can occur in several ways. The people who brought the script are not bright enough to see how lacking it is. Or, the script is great, but people with egos bigger than Texas can't resists tampering with it. Or, at least one powerful executive's kid didn't like it at a preview, so it gets re-editied. Whatever the cause, the results are the usually the same. The big surprise ending isn't logical, leaving one feeling deflated and a bit cheated.Arlington Road starts off like a racehorse out of the gate. We see a dazed young boy stumbling down the middle of a suburban road. Michael Faraday [Jeff Bridges] drives up and gets out to help. Seeing that the lad is badly injured, he rushes him to the hospital. A little later, in the emergency room, he meets the boy's grateful parents, Oliver and Cheryl Lang [Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack]. Turns out they are new neighbors of Faraday's. Soon, a friendship blossoms.Faraday is already a basket case. He teaches a course in terrorism at a local university. Wouldn't you know it? His wife was killed three years earlier in a botch FBI raid on a suspected terrorist group. His young son is withdrawn, but comes back to life when he starts hanging out with the Lang's now recovered kid. As for Oliver and Cheryl, there is something not quite right about them. When Faraday gets suspicious and starts investigating, he finds himself being dragged into some very dark business.The movie's stars - Bridges, Robbins and Cusack - are among our best actors. Bridges is typically masculine yet vulnerable here, while Robbins is his usual otherworldly self. It is Cusack who shines the brightest. Her Cheryl is a woman who says kind, warm things with just the slightest lack of sincerity on her void. She's one of those people with a helpful facade who can wreak havoc in everyone's lives.Another plus is the musical score by Angelo Badalamenti and Tomandandy [Tom Hadiu and Andy Milburn]. For once, we are not bombarded by songs meant to fill a CD. The music here is pure thriller - loud, jagged and often cacophonous. It greatly enhances the mood of the film.Sadly, for all the good elements in Arlington Road, we are left with that plot. In the best of thrillers, such as this year's smash hit The Sixth Sense, even if the story may is implausible, the seemingly odd and off-kilter events that occur all make sense in a logical and surprising conclusion. You look back and think, Oh, that's why this and that happened. They fooled me until the end, and I got my money's worth.

The plot has many twists and turns. Jeff Bridges plays a collage professor who teaches a course on the history of American terrorism and begins investigating a neighbor he suspects of belonging to a right wing terrorist organization. The professor surprisingly shows how federal agents botched a raid on a family (Parsons family) it wrongly suspected of being part of a right wing terrorist group who were innocent resulting in the deaths of Parsons's wife and youngest son. He also mistakingly describes the Oklahoma bomber's attack on the federal building as using C 4 explosives rather than fertilizer which was actually used. The professor's suspicions of his neighbor were laid arrest for a while until his girlfriend was murdered by the right wing terrorist organization. The ending was meant to appease left wing extremist paranoia and convince the general public that there is a vast right wing terrorist conspiracy which cannot be uncovered by our government,1,TYPICAL  HOLLYWOOD TERRORIST PARANOIA MOVIE,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,1094,"['like', 'Jeff', 'bridges', 'read', 'movie', 'description', 'back', 'Blockbuster', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'conspiracy', 'movie', 'plot', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'collage', 'professor', 'who', 'course', 'history', 'American', 'terrorism', 'investigating', 'neighbor', 'belonging', 'right', 'wing', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'professor', 'surprisingly', 'how', 'federal', 'agents', 'botched', 'raid', 'family', 'Parsons', 'family', 'wrongly', 'suspected', 'being', 'part', 'right', 'wing', 'terrorist', 'group', 'who', 'were', 'innocent', 'resulting', 'deaths', 'Parsons', 'wife', 'youngest', 'son', 'also', 'mistakingly', 'Oklahoma', 'bomber', 'attack', 'federal', 'building', 'using', 'C', '4', 'rather', 'fertilizer', 'was', 'actually', 'used', 'professor', 'suspicions', 'neighbor', 'were', 'laid', 'arrest', 'while', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'murdered', 'right', 'wing', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'ending', 'was', 'meant', 'appease', 'left', 'wing', 'extremist', 'paranoia', 'convince', 'general', 'public', 'vast', 'right', 'wing', 'terrorist', 'conspiracy', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'uncovered', 'government']",N/A

It would ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it, guys!!!Anyway, ARLINGTON ROAD is one dark and disturbing movie, fueled with paranoia, suspicions, and mistrust.  Jeff Bridges, looking for the first time like an elderly gentleman (not old, just aging), gives a tense performance as a history teacher who lost his FBI wife in a botched raid.  He now teaches terrorism at a college in the DC area.  The movie's opening is gutwrenching from the start, but necessary to involve Bridges with his new neighbors, played like Stepford Wives by Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins.  But all is not as it seems.  Bridges is sure Robbins is a terrorist, responsible for a dreadful bombing in St. Louis, and is ultimately planning more bombings.  Bridges' live-in girl friend (Hope Davis) at first doesn't buy into Bridges' theory, but later finds proof that brings her to Bridges' side.  From there on, though, it's a frightening change of pace as Bridges races to stop Robbins' plot and save his son in the meantime.  Mark Pellington's direction is right on, and the ending is quite unexpected.This is not a conventional movie, and not one that brightens your day, but it is an intense, well-done and unusual thriller.Well made!!",5,A LONESOME ROAD,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,1296,"['First', 'raspberries', 'reviewers', 'who', 'felt', 'impelled', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'would', 'ruin', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Anyway', 'ARLINGTON', 'ROAD', 'one', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'fueled', 'paranoia', 'suspicions', 'mistrust', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'looking', 'first', 'time', 'elderly', 'gentleman', 'not', 'old', 'just', 'aging', 'tense', 'performance', 'history', 'teacher', 'who', 'lost', 'FBI', 'wife', 'botched', 'raid', 'now', 'terrorism', 'college', 'DC', 'area', 'movie', 'opening', 'gutwrenching', 'start', 'necessary', 'involve', 'Bridges', 'new', 'neighbors', 'played', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'not', 'Bridges', 'sure', 'Robbins', 'terrorist', 'responsible', 'dreadful', 'bombing', 'St.', 'Louis', 'ultimately', 'planning', 'more', 'bombings', 'Bridges', 'live-in', 'girl', 'friend', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'first', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Bridges', 'theory', 'later', 'proof', 'Bridges', 'side', 'there', 'frightening', 'change', 'pace', 'Bridges', 'stop', 'Robbins', 'plot', 'save', 'son', 'meantime', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'direction', 'right', 'ending', 'quite', 'unexpected.This', 'not', 'conventional', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'day', 'intense', 'well-done', 'unusual', 'thriller.Well', 'made']",N/A

Now, after the horrifying and unspeakable terrorist attacks on this country on September 11th, this movie is even more horrifying and hard to stomach.  Be warned; this is a very shocking and uneasy movie that you will never forget, even if you want to.&quot;Arlington Road&quot; stars Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins.  After meeting the all-too-perfect family, Bridges starts to suspect that his neighbor, Robbins, just might not be the standup guy that he appears to be.  After seeing some shocking and questioning clues to Robbins' past, he starts to suspect that a terrorist is living in his neighborhood and plans to do unspeakable damage and terror somewhere.  Is Bridges just plain paranoid, or has he stumbled on a conspiracy that can destroy many lives?  All I can say without giving too much, the ending will scare the hell out of you, and will leave you devastated.This movie was already disturbing way before September 11th, but now the movie is even more shocking and horrifying.  It shows you that terror can strike anywhere and can hide behind anyone.  Terror has no true identity and has no face.  It shows us just how little we know about the world we live in.  It also shows us that sometimes the most ordinary person can do unspeakable things.Is the movie disturbing and hard to watch?  Yes.  Will the ending either terrify or anger you?  Most likely.  But this movie succeeded in terrifying me and keeping me at the edge of my seat.  The primary goal of a thriller is to keep you guessing and on edge, no matter how gruesome and disturbing the movie may be.  I thought this was a great thriller that will never leave my mind and that it was very well directed and acted out.  Disturbing as it may be, it is a brilliant thriller that you will never forget.  There are some fine extras on the DVD, including a behind-the-scenes feature, commentary, and a theatrical trailer of the movie.  (You may want to save the trailer for when you finish the movie.  I feel that it gives away the movie a little.)I hope this review hasn't given away too many secrets, for there are many haunting ones you will encounter in this dark film.  There are many people who will hate this movie and be angered by it.  I think it's a grim reminder that we don't live in a perfect and safe world after all.

It begins with the opening sequence, when we see a little boy dazed in the street, his hand bloody, and Prof. Michael  Farraday (Jeff Bridges) comes to his aid. The boy is the son of Oliver and  Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), a nice, suburban couple. But  things start to change. Behind the faade of suburbia, Farraday, already  paranoid as a terrorism expert and as the widower of an FBI agent murdered  in a Waco-style raid, starts to suspect that the Langs are quite different  that he expected. From there, the story twists and turns towards one  disturbing conclusion.Arlington Road not only has a bizarre and twisting  story, but has a unique visual look as well, thanks to director Mark  Pellington. In fact, the film at times looks similar the the music video  for Pearl Jam's song `Jeremy', which Pellington also directed. Bridges,  perhaps the most underrated actor there is, is terrific and has a similar  role in many ways to 1994's Blown Away. Robbins is an actor who is so  versatile, that he can play both the innocent simpleton (The Hudsucker  Proxy) or a conniving senatorial candidate (Bob Roberts), here displays a  few new sides to his personality. Joan Cusack is also excellent in perhaps  what is even a creepier role.

Thankfully Mark Pellington (Director) opted for something more realistic than that stereotypical portrayal.There are no madmen, in the conventional sense, in this film, just ordinary people with grudges. People who have been hurt by the government and want to get back at it for what they perceive to be injustices. Pellington also reminds us that we are so quick to find scapegoats to blame because it gives us a sense of relief, a feeling that all is once again right with the world, and that acts of terrorism can only be carried out by `others' not by people like us. I don't want to give you the wrong impression however, because this is certainly not a didactic movie.As to the movie itself, the plot is cleverly written and you definitely feel the tension and suspense building as the movie progresses. The characters are believable and frightening because of their normality. Joan Cusack was perfectly cast as the wife of the half-sane, half mad terrorist. I still can't get forget that sinister smile of hers.  Tim Robbin's character was credible, with the right balance of insanity and reason. He definitely wasn't the `typical villain.' As for Bridges, he was the one who made this whole movie work, without him the movie would have flopped.I would highly recommend this movie, I don't give too many movies 5 stars but this one definitely deserved it. Arlington Road has a great cast, a great storyline, but best of all, it gets you to thinking about terrorism and what motivates terrorists.

It was probably the most intense movie I've ever seen. The suspense was incredible, the camera work was great (with several Hitchcock-esque shots added in the mix), the plot was nicely twisted. It was a great movie! If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, go check this movie out. It had my heart pumping at twice my optimal heart rate from the first minute of the movie. I can't really give any of the details of the movie away, because it would really ruin a lot of it. Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins were the perfect choice for both characters. I really wish I could say more about the movie, but this is the type of movie that would be ruined by knowing too much. Don't even read the cover of the movieA few words of caution: this movie is not for the faint of heart. However, if you think you are partially faint hearted, just don't watch the first 5 minutes...which (at least for me), was the most disturbing part of the movie. There are several scenes of violence, and there is blood, but the violence isn't what makes this movie so intense..it is the suspense. The camera angles and the film score make the movie almost unbearable when it comes to suspense. I could have shared my seat with several other people because I *only* used the edge of it! There are many, many &quot;jump scenes&quot; (scenes that make you jump out of your seat), despite what Screenit.com says. The language isn't great, but it isn't horrible either.

Outstanding performances by Jeff Bridges (As Michael Faraday) and Tim Robbins (Oliver Lang) highlight this taut thriller about  terrorism in America, a disturbing film instilled with a sense of loss,  fear and paranoia.  Director Mark Pellington perhaps does not mine this  vein to the depths, but there is still a silver lining in this movie, which  contains elements of two of Alfred Hitchcock's classics, ""The Man Who Knew  Too Much,"" and ""North By Northwest.""  Had this film been made forty years  ago, in fact, Hitchcock would have been at the helm and we would have had  James Stewart instead of Bridges and Richard Widmark in place of Robbins.  When Jeff Bridges stars in a thriller, you can usually bet that the project  is going to be a cut above the average fare of the genre, and this one is  no exception, arguably his best of it's kind since ""Jagged Edge.""  This is  a riveting film, and the tension builds steadily throughout as we uncover,  along with Faraday, the dark secrets which ultimately lead to an explosive  climax.  The excellent supporting cast includes Joan Cusack, Hope Davis and  Robert Gossett.

Is that to say that hollywood is politcally neutral? Is tim robbins politically neutral? What is the message here? That being white, republican and christian is a dangerous thing? That those who would blow up innocent children are not that far removed from the typical conservative? Certainly. You would have to be an idiot not to see that.Consider two quotes in this film. One by faraday the bridges character who is teaching a class on domestic terrorism. Referring to the oklahoma city bombing which is depited here as the st luois bombimg faraday puts forth his theory that the killer did not act alone. He says that the killer was a ""moderate republican."" What does that mean? That a real conservative can be expected to kill 300 people? In another quote the robbin's character, the terrorist says ""there are millions of us"" and indeed it seems that they are. These pasty faced ultra pale people are everywhere in this film manipulating your children in a boy scout group, following you everywhere you go and listening in on your phone calls. The bad guys are so smart and so large in number that in the end they not only succeed in blowing up a federal building but are able to kill and pin the crime on faraday.This film a fairly taut thriller with a pleasantly unusaul ending. The good guy doesn't win. Yes it is intense with many ultra close up shots so that you can't see who may be in the background. At first faraday is a little suspicious of his neighbors though he has little reason to be suspicious.

Schultz,"[0, 0]","I avoid calling this a good ""political"" thriller, as I think the movie director might like to bill it, because the political motivations invoked to set the villains in motion here are almost ludicrous. This movie was made before 9/11 - so the film's ""terrorists"" are presented as a ""vast right-wing conspiracy.""However even this simple-minded conception of the threat of terrorism is muddied by Jeff Bridges' fervid ranting.  Bridges plays a college professor teaching classes in government, civil liberties, and terrorism. However he seems to be almost unhinged and perhaps suspiciously complicit in terrorist acts himself as he spirals off into confused diatribes against - first lone right-wing bombers like the Unibomber - then pervasive right-wing conspiracies - then the U.S. government itself, and specifically the F.B.I. Bridges blames all these entities for his wife's death, and his lectures apparently consist of little more than projected pictures of severed limbs and bleeding bodies left in the wake of such terrorist attacks. Furthermore, he incites his students to similar suspicion and hatred. I doubt that a professor who conducted his classes in such a way would hold his job very long.So in order to enjoy this movie, it might be best to disregard all its muddled political assumptions. Just take it as a contest between some scary villains and some good guys. Then you can sit back and appreciate the very real suspense that this movie builds.""Arlington Road"" has one of the eeriest opening sequences I've seen in any movie.

However, this film is not  one of those.  You don't often find me saying &quot;wow&quot; to the movie  that I have just watched, but this film is an exception.

And this was one of those.  Tim Robbins like  always, was amazingly attractive.  Though as scary as his character was, I  was attraced to him than ever before.

So I'm astonished that so many reviewers criticize the ending.  Does every film have to leave you with a warm and fuzzy glow?  Can't a movie actually be ABOUT something?  Even something important?  Of course it can, but that sometimes means the viewer has to take a pretty solid kick in the guts.

The film opens with college professor Michael Faraday (played extremely well by Jeff Bridges) finding an child on the streets of his neighborhood with half his hand blown off due to a fireworks accident.  Faraday rushes the boy to the hospital, not knowing his identity or who his parents are.  He later finds out that the boy is the son of the all-American neighborrs Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack; in equal chilling performances that make will make your skin crawl) who have just moved across the street in on Arlington Road.As Faraday gets to know the Lang family more intimately, he begins to suspect that they are not all that they claim and seem to be.  Faraday's girlfriend (Hope Davis) believes that he is just paranoid due to the tragic death of his wife, who was gunned down by a right-wing group who was suspected to be terrorists.  The professor is uncertain what to be believe--is he really just consumed with the Langs because of a haunted past, or is Oliver really a part of a horrific terrorist conspiracy that be lethal to his community?Director Mark Pellington creates an intense, riveting film that does not skip a beat--it unravels from the very start with the eerie introduction and the truth is revealed exceptionally well with a superb, twisted finale.  The cast does an great job, especially Robbins, who is stellar as the suspected mad-bomber.

20966,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0767836286,trebe,"[6, 6]","Arlington Road is a film that takes some of the elements from the Oklahoma City bombing and the Ruby Ridge incident, and cleverly weaves them into a story of domestic terrorism and paranoia.  Delivering a message, the film explores the subject of manipulation.  Manipulation of one man, the historical record, and the audience.  The final result is an example of master planning, and anticipation of action, that is incredible.  In the end, we see that isolated &quot;facts&quot; when combined do not always add up to the &quot;truth&quot;.The story centers on Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), a professor of American history at George Washington University.  Two years ago, his wife, an FBI agent, was killed during a botched agency operation at a farmhouse.  Disillusioned with the Government, and left alone to raise a son, Faraday struggles to move on in his life with his new girlfriend Brooke (Hope Davis).  After coming to the aid of a neighbor's son, Faraday and the boy's grateful parents, Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), become friends.Soon however, Faraday becomes suspicious that Oliver Lang, a structural engineer, is not what he appears.  Faraday begins to check into his background.  His girlfriend doesn't understand his suspicions, but he can't keep himself from probing into Lang's mysterious past.  Against his better judgment, he permits his son to go on a camping trip with Lang's boy.  Events begin to snowball, and Faraday finds his life spiraling out of control.  Desperation drives him to acts of near madness, attempting to prevent a disaster, and save the life of his son.  The results are atypical, to say the least.Jeff Bridges gives a powerful performance as an obsessed man driven over the edge.  Tim Robbins, and Hope Davis are also very good, although Robbins starts to go a bit too far near the end.  Joan Cusack, was a bit harder to accept in her role.This movie succeeds in being provocative.  For these events to be credible however, we would need to believe that human action can be predicted down to the nth degree, and with near perfect timing.  Even if you can't quite swallow this pill, the film should make you think about how, through the media, we perceive events.

20968,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,0767836286,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 1]","Hollywood hasn't made a literate white-knuckled conspiracy thriller like director's Mark Pellington's ""Arlington Road"" in many moons. The genre ran out of steam in the late 1970s. The late Alan J. Pakula came closest to capturing the essence of the conspiracy thriller with two memorable efforts ""The Parallax View"" (1974) and ""All The President's Men"" (1976). Oliver Stone revived the genre briefly with ""JFK,"" but this star-studded marathon as good as it was lacked the visceral qualities of either Alfred Hitchcock's work or Pakula's pictures. Nothing about ""JFK"" surprised audiences. Stone, a filmmaker more controversial than any controversy he aroused, concerned himself more with uncovering the truth than captivating moviegoers. Indeed, David Miller's ""Executive Action"" (1973), a penny-thrifty thriller about the Kennedy assassination, entertains more than ""JFK"" on a fraction of its modest budget. Richard Donner's ""Conspiracy Theory"" (1997) and George P. Cosmatos' ""Shadow Conspiracy"" (1996) vanished almost as quickly as they showed up. Playwright David Mamet recaptured the ambiance of the conspiracy thriller with ""The Spanish Prisoner"", but the studio packed it off to the video rental shelves without much thought. Happily, after some doubts about whether it would open itself, ""Arlington Road"" made it to the big-screen. If he were alive, Alfred Hitchcock would probably applaud Mark Pellington for picking up where he left off.""Arlington Road"" appropriates many of Hitchcock's conventions. Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges of ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"") resembles the quintessential Hitchcock hero. He is an average Joe with a white-collar job. He doesn't sleep with a gun under his pillow, and he doesn't careen around in a souped-up sports car with fancy gadgets. He wears a necktie instead of a pistol. Actually, he teaches American history, and he is a widowed, single-father raising his nine-year old son, Grant Faraday (Spencer Clark Treat). Further, Hitchcock staged scenes of nail-gnawing suspense in the least dangerous settings. Remember the sun-lit cornfield in ""North by Northwest?"" Or the shower in ""Psycho?"" Or the church in ""Vertigo?"" Similarly, the action in ""Arlington Road"" takes place in areas usually considered crime free. Wide open public meeting areas, shopping malls, well-lit university classrooms, and the idyllic seclusion of the suburbs, replete with backyard barbecues and dinner parties with wholesome neighbors. The people that made ""Arlington Road"" rely on this deceptive faade of tranquility to distract audiences long enough before they hit them with the year's best paranoid thriller.""Arlington Road"" opens with chilling images of a juvenile, Brady Lang (Mason Gamble), shambling down the middle of a street in an upper-middle-class, Virginia suburb on a bright sunny day. He clutches the charred stump of his hands. Blood dribbles onto his sneakers. Driving home from George Washington University where he lectures about terrorism, Michael Faraday spot the injured youth and speeds him to the emergency room. Michael neither knows who Brady is nor where he lives. Later, at the hospital, Brady's grateful parents, Oliver (Tim Robbins of ""Mystic River"") and his wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack of ""Grosse Pointe Blank""), arrive and thank him. Initially, Michael is surprised to learn that the Langs live across the street from him. Oliver explains that Brady hurt himself while apparently fooling around with fireworks, but he dismisses the accident as nothing more than ""a failed rocketry experiment."" Gradually, a closely knit relationship develops between Michael and the Langs. At the same time, Brady and Grant become fast friends. ""Our house is your house,"" Cheryl says with irony: ""We're here for you, we really are."" At a dinner party, Faraday introduces the Langs to Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis of ""The Matador""), a former graduate student who is now his girlfriend and colleague. Cheryl compliments them; they make a cute couple. Oliver exhibits the work he does as a structural architect. Cheryl confines herself to the home as the happy housewife that never complains while she rears their two daughters and son. Apparently, the only difference between the Langs and TV's ""Brady Bunch"" is three children and a housekeeper.Meanwhile, ""Reindeer Games"" scenarist Ehren Kruger's award-winning script parcels out bits and pieces of exposition about Michael. Faraday's late wife (Laura Poe) worked for the FBI and died tragically in the line-of-duty when the Feds bungled a raid on the cabin of a suspected terrorist. ""Leah died for her country,"" Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), Leah's old partner at the FBI, consoles Michael. ""She didn't have to,"" Michael shakes his head in grief at her gravesite. Grant still suffers from the loss of his mom and bridles at the presence of Brooke, the new woman in Faraday's life. Michael himself has not totally recovered his Leah's death and pours his anxieties into his lectures about terrorism. As a history professor, Michael enjoys lecturing about domestic terrorism. He promotes conspiracy theories in the classroom and provides his students with hand-outs teeming with photos and news articles about anarchy. He refuses to believe that a single individual, no matter how resourceful, could carry out an act of terrorism on American soil without help.""The Mothman Prophecies"" director Mark Pellington acquits himself admirably as a cinematic stylist of the highest order. After a whirlwind opening, Pellington lets the dust settle and carefully lets the tension build. Although Michael and the Langs grow closer as friends, our hero ferrets out incriminating evidence about the Langs that surprises and then disturbs him. He alienates his own son and Brooke thinks that he has lost his mind. As it turns out, Oliver isn't the man that he claims to be and Michael has the college year books to prove his point. Lenser Bobby Bukowski and Pellington surround Faraday with darkness and isolate him in their pictorial compositions. Even Wit Carver has doubts about Michael's sanity and warns him that he is heading toward oblivion. Pellington frames Faraday in increasingly tighter close-ups to suggest the mental claustrophobia that his crusade is causing him. Altogether, conspiracy theorists will want to watch ""Arlington Road"" over and over, especially in light of 9/11.",5,"Incredibly Tense, White-Knuckled, Nail-Gnawer of a Tale!",1228694400,"12 8,

In light of the events of the day these days I'm surprised this movie doesn't get much press.It's an intriguing look at terrorism in a way I've never seen portrayed on film. It's heartbreaking and breathtaking often at the same time. It's finely acted, superbly directed, and completely unpredictable. Not a bad combination! The movie does border on complete unbelievability for a brief time but by the time the credits roll you will be a believer in the message.This Blu-Ray version is totally capable.

However, I have watched it again and again recently, and I have realized that it actually showed the true aspects of our reality. It is an idea that everyone can be manipulated to do what the real terrorists wanted them to do or to ""bring the bomb into the building"" without their being aware of it.I would highly recommended this movie because it is closer to what is happening in our society, including the 9/11 events and other 'terrorist' attacks.",5,Highly Recommended!,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,595,"['first', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'fact', ""'good"", 'guys', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'However', 'have', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'recently', 'have', 'realized', 'actually', 'showed', 'true', 'aspects', 'reality', 'idea', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'do', 'what', 'real', 'terrorists', 'wanted', 'do', 'bring', 'bomb', 'building', 'being', 'aware', 'it.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommended', 'movie', 'closer', 'what', 'happening', 'society', 'including', '9/11', 'events', 'other', ""'terrorist"", 'attacks']",N/A

Although the very surprising ending is dramatic and then.. well, you may find it terriboy unsatisfying.  But, I think the whole movie was overdone.  I think the actors acted like they were on steroids, especially Jeff Bridges.  At the end, you see why they had him acting so hyper, but still, it wasn't realistic.  Also, there was more than a whiff of political B.S. -- as you might expect from any movie Tim Robbins is in -- particularly when it comes to painting the FBI as bad guys and the fanatics as right-wingers.
