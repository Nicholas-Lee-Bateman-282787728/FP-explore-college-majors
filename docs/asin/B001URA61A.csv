The stars as listed are correct. Each episode was intended for a 30 minute time slot.  The set listed here is a 3 disk set from Image Entertainment and the only one currently in print.The listing here:The Swiss Family Robinson (The Complete Series)is an earlier ""out-of-print"" release of this series.  It's reportedly a 4 disk set from Morningstar Entertainment.As to which release is better?  I do not know, but typically the same material on fewer disks will indicate some compression issues although it's not uncommon for 30 minute series to have 7-9 episodes per disk as would be the case with the Image set.  I'd not avoid it for that reason alone as Image typically puts out a good quality product.The USA Irwin Allen series from 1976 on ABC with Martin Milner, Willie Aames, and Helen Hunt has not yet seen a DVD release.",4,You want info?

1239363,A48C8M5OM9ETJ,B001URA61A,"prince of reviews ""Jack""","[3, 4]",I love this TV series called Swiss Family Robinson. I think there was a good cast selection. If you want a TV series that teaches some good family values then choose this product. That episode was called Dangerous Feast. The mother had ate some poisonous oysters and got sick. Fortunately the poison was purged and she lived. There are some other episodes that deal with dying in which a mother goat died after giving birth to a kid (baby goat.) I would definitely recommend this three cd set. Every episode is a 22 minute segment. So you can see as many episodes at a time as you have time to view. Choose this TV set and enjoy.,5,I own the 3-set set dvd. great TV series,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,629,"['love', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'cast', 'selection', 'want', 'TV', 'series', 'good', 'family', 'values', 'then', 'choose', 'product', 'episode', 'was', 'called', 'Dangerous', 'Feast', 'mother', 'had', 'poisonous', 'oysters', 'got', 'sick', 'Fortunately', 'poison', 'was', 'purged', 'lived', 'are', 'other', 'episodes', 'deal', 'dying', 'mother', 'goat', 'died', 'giving', 'birth', 'kid', 'baby', 'goat', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'three', 'cd', 'set', 'episode', '22', 'minute', 'segment', 'can', 'see', 'many', 'episodes', 'time', 'have', 'time', 'view', 'Choose', 'TV', 'set', 'enjoy']",N/A
