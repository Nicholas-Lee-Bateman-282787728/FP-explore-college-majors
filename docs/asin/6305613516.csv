This, the final of the three, was definitely one of the ""good ones."" It is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance.Of the three, that initial ""Sarah,"" was the best-filmed with some beautiful cinematography. This movie didn't have that, but it had the best story in the trilogy. It had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending, all of which makes it highly recommended.The storyline is simple but well-told. The only sub-par performance was by one of the kids. It was interesting, though, to see how the kids had grown since that first movie in this trilogy.",4,"Of The Three, I Liked This Story Best",1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,736,"['enjoyed', 'two', 'three', 'movies', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'trilogy', 'final', 'three', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'good', 'ones', 'excellent', 'family', 'film', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'three', 'adult', 'stars', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Jack', 'Palance.Of', 'three', 'initial', 'Sarah', 'was', 'best-filmed', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'best', 'story', 'trilogy', 'had', 'genuinely-tearful', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'very', 'nice', 'ending', 'highly', 'recommended.The', 'storyline', 'simple', 'well-told', 'only', 'sub-par', 'performance', 'was', 'one', 'kids', 'was', 'interesting', 'though', 'see', 'how', 'kids', 'had', 'grown', 'first', 'movie', 'trilogy']","Sarah, Plain and Tall: Winter's End VHS"
471128,AJCOII5VQ1X9M,6305613516,"Cynthia Ward ""Author of Sometimes There's a Dove""","[9, 11]","The movie opens in March of 1918.  The long, bitter winter has yet to come to an end. There is an epidemic of influenza in town and the war has taken Anna's boyfriend overseas.  Much as Jacob and Sarah did, Anna waits for every letter from him while tending the sick in town.  Back home on the farm, an unexpected visitor will soon rock Sarah's family to its core.Although 'Winter's End' sounds exciting, its frightfully  dull and unprofessional.  The acting is just not up to par with the first two.  Glen Close, Christopher Walken and the entire cast shine in `Sarah Plain & Tall' and `Skylark.'  After seeing those, I suppose I was spoiled.  I expected that high quality when I bought `Winter's End' and thus, I was shocked and dismayed by this poorly acted out movie.  I've seen these actors/actresses at their best and they are very talented.  Now,  I am left baffled as to what happened here.  Did they just not care this time around?  Was it the director?  A low budget?  What?  So many questions, so little answers.  What really got me was when, `Sarah' (Glen Close) was caught out in a blizzard and almost froze to death.  The depth of emotion put into that scene wouldn't fill a tea spoon.  `Jacob' (Christopher Walken) put the most into it, but his acting was stilted, unreal and unnatural.  Yet, the all time award for stiffness and unnatural acting would be a tie between, Jack Palance (Jacob's wayward father)  and Christopher Bell (Caleb)  They did a terrible job.  To make matters worse, it looks as if the `honeymoon' is over for Sarah and Jacob in `winter's End.'  There is no more of that `spark' we enjoyed in, `Sarah Plain & Tall' and `Skylark.'  There might be one or two scenes where they shine as they once did, but for the most part, the chemistry is dead.The biggest highlight of the film was Sarah and Jacob's little girl `Cassie,' played by Emily Osment.  She seemed to be the only one who took her role seriously.  She was a natural, and very 'real' in her part.  She did a great job.  But sadly the rest of the cast  lost the magic that was, `Sarah Plain & Tall.'",3,Not up to par.,1033430400,"10 1, 2002",2002,2093,"['movie', 'March', '1918', 'long', 'bitter', 'winter', 'yet', 'come', 'end', 'epidemic', 'influenza', 'town', 'war', 'taken', 'Anna', 'boyfriend', 'overseas', 'Much', 'Jacob', 'Sarah', 'did', 'Anna', 'letter', 'tending', 'sick', 'town', 'Back', 'home', 'farm', 'unexpected', 'visitor', 'will', 'soon', 'rock', 'Sarah', 'family', 'core.Although', ""'Winter"", 'End', 'sounds', 'exciting', 'frightfully', 'dull', 'unprofessional', 'acting', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'first', 'two', 'Glen', 'Close', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'entire', 'cast', 'shine', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'Skylark', 'seeing', 'suppose', 'was', 'spoiled', 'expected', 'high', 'quality', 'when', 'bought', 'Winter', 'End', 'thus', 'was', 'shocked', 'dismayed', 'poorly', 'acted', 'out', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actors/actresses', 'best', 'are', 'very', 'talented', 'Now', 'am', 'left', 'baffled', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'Did', 'just', 'not', 'care', 'time', 'Was', 'director', 'A', 'low', 'budget', 'What', 'So', 'many', 'questions', 'so', 'little', 'answers', 'What', 'really', 'got', 'was', 'when', 'Sarah', 'Glen', 'Close', 'was', 'caught', 'out', 'blizzard', 'almost', 'froze', 'death', 'depth', 'emotion', 'put', 'scene', 'would', ""n't"", 'fill', 'tea', 'spoon', 'Jacob', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'put', 'most', 'acting', 'was', 'stilted', 'unreal', 'unnatural', 'time', 'award', 'stiffness', 'unnatural', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'tie', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'Jacob', 'wayward', 'father', 'Christopher', 'Bell', 'Caleb', 'did', 'terrible', 'job', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'honeymoon', 'Sarah', 'Jacob', 'winter', 'End', 'more', 'spark', 'enjoyed', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'Skylark', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'shine', 'once', 'did', 'most', 'part', 'chemistry', 'dead.The', 'biggest', 'highlight', 'film', 'was', 'Sarah', 'Jacob', 'little', 'girl', 'Cassie', 'played', 'Emily', 'Osment', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'took', 'role', 'seriously', 'was', 'natural', 'very', ""'real"", 'part', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'sadly', 'rest', 'cast', 'lost', 'magic', 'was', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall']","Sarah, Plain and Tall: Winter's End VHS"

471133,A281NPSIMI1C2R,6305613516,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[68, 69]","After watching the first two movies in this trilogy, you will find the third story to be a satisfying conclusion. In the first movie, Sarah and Jacob write letters, fall in love and then marry. The story deals with the loss of Jacob's wife and how Sarah is taking her place and finding her way into the hearts of his children. Skylark is the second movie in the series and deals with a family staying together despite the difficulties of farm life. They are committed to making their way on the dusty Kansas prairie.In Winter's End, the issues drift to the past and how they affect the future. Jacob's children have grown considerably and his daughter Anna (Lexi Randall) is in love with a boy who has gone off to war and she spends her time waiting for him to return home while nursing the ill in town. Caleb (Christopher Bell) is now old enough to take on more farm responsibilities. Jacob and Sarah's daughter is quite impetuous and will make you laugh as she will remind you of how Sarah was in the first movie! In dealing with life on the farm, Jacob has an accident and Sarah spends a night out in the snow.While all these issues are presenting themselves, Sarah has a calm understanding and supports Jacob while he is dealing with the challenge of forgiving his father. Their love is more mature and while the heady days of the first movie seem to have faded, they are deeply commited to one another and their children. They open their home to a stranger who they later find out is Jacob's father.Jack Palance takes center stage as Jacob's father who returns to the Witting family farm which is the only place he ever felt was home. The issues are presented in a loving way which will make you value family more and see the hurt a person can do by making the wrong choices. They can change, but they hurt the people they care most about.If you enjoyed the first two stories, I think I can safely say you will enjoy this third heartwarming tale of triumph over life's challenges. If you haven't seen the first two movies, I would recommend purchasing the trilogy. These are movies you will want to share with friends and family and watch again when you want to escape to a Kansas prairie for a few hours.~The Rebecca Review",4,Forgiveness....,992476800,"06 14, 2001",2001,2229,"['watching', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'trilogy', 'will', 'find', 'third', 'story', 'be', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'first', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'Jacob', 'write', 'letters', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'marry', 'story', 'deals', 'loss', 'Jacob', 'wife', 'how', 'Sarah', 'taking', 'place', 'finding', 'way', 'hearts', 'children', 'Skylark', 'second', 'movie', 'series', 'deals', 'family', 'staying', 'together', 'difficulties', 'farm', 'life', 'are', 'committed', 'making', 'way', 'dusty', 'Kansas', 'prairie.In', 'Winter', 'End', 'issues', 'drift', 'past', 'how', 'affect', 'future', 'Jacob', 'children', 'have', 'grown', 'considerably', 'daughter', 'Anna', 'Lexi', 'Randall', 'love', 'boy', 'who', 'gone', 'off', 'war', 'time', 'waiting', 'return', 'home', 'nursing', 'ill', 'town', 'Caleb', 'Christopher', 'Bell', 'now', 'old', 'enough', 'take', 'more', 'farm', 'responsibilities', 'Jacob', 'Sarah', 'daughter', 'quite', 'impetuous', 'will', 'make', 'will', 'remind', 'how', 'Sarah', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'dealing', 'life', 'farm', 'Jacob', 'accident', 'Sarah', 'night', 'out', 'snow.While', 'issues', 'are', 'presenting', 'Sarah', 'calm', 'understanding', 'supports', 'Jacob', 'dealing', 'challenge', 'forgiving', 'father', 'love', 'more', 'mature', 'heady', 'days', 'first', 'movie', 'seem', 'have', 'faded', 'are', 'deeply', 'commited', 'one', 'children', 'open', 'home', 'stranger', 'who', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'Jacob', 'father.Jack', 'Palance', 'center', 'stage', 'Jacob', 'father', 'who', 'Witting', 'family', 'farm', 'only', 'place', 'ever', 'felt', 'was', 'home', 'issues', 'are', 'presented', 'loving', 'way', 'will', 'make', 'value', 'family', 'more', 'see', 'hurt', 'person', 'can', 'do', 'making', 'wrong', 'choices', 'can', 'change', 'hurt', 'people', 'care', 'most', 'about.If', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'stories', 'think', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'will', 'enjoy', 'third', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'triumph', 'life', 'challenges', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'trilogy', 'are', 'movies', 'will', 'want', 'share', 'friends', 'family', 'watch', 'again', 'when', 'want', 'escape', 'Kansas', 'prairie', 'few', 'hours.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']","Sarah, Plain and Tall: Winter's End VHS"
