1186860,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001EXE2YC,B. E Jackson,"[5, 5]","Not quite just another horror movie. The Conjurer is about a man who keeps seeing images of a witch appar in his back yard shed. The people all around him including neighbors, the previous owners, and even his wifes brother all tell him ""those are just myths and stories people say to spark interest"". But the man continues going through strange occurrences and unexplainable events despite all this.The story in the beginning is about the mans wife who lost her baby, and what happens when they move to a farm house in the country to start over.What makes this movie 5 stars is quite simple- there's two major twists at the very end that will probably catch you by surprise, and the eerie build-up in the first half of the movie is quite fantastic when the man continues to see and hear things in the woods and in his shed that he can't explain. The plot builds slowly, but not TOO slow that you become bored with it. It requires a fair amount of your attention span, but it's totally worth it because of the ending. Without spoiling too much, what you probably think is going to happen to the wife is actually going to be something much different.The writers of the film were also aware what's been done a million times in other horror stories and disregarded them, such as the scenes involving a little boy who kept spying on his new neighbors. There's an explaination for his appearance and it's good writing because he doesn't play the typical ""scary kid hiding in woods planning to kill people"" that it appears he's going to play when you first see him.The acting is great all around, especially the wife who's very underrated in her performance.I wish there were more horror movies like this out there. Ones that deliver on suspense, storytelling, and fantastic endings.",5,good twist-dominated horror,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,1777,"['Not', 'quite', 'just', 'horror', 'movie', 'Conjurer', 'man', 'who', 'seeing', 'images', 'witch', 'appar', 'back', 'yard', 'shed', 'people', 'including', 'neighbors', 'previous', 'owners', 'even', 'wifes', 'brother', 'tell', 'are', 'just', 'myths', 'stories', 'people', 'say', 'spark', 'interest', 'man', 'going', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'unexplainable', 'events', 'this.The', 'story', 'beginning', 'mans', 'wife', 'who', 'lost', 'baby', 'what', 'when', 'move', 'farm', 'house', 'country', 'start', 'over.What', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'quite', 'simple-', 'two', 'major', 'twists', 'very', 'end', 'will', 'probably', 'catch', 'surprise', 'eerie', 'build-up', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'quite', 'fantastic', 'when', 'man', 'see', 'hear', 'things', 'woods', 'shed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'plot', 'slowly', 'not', 'TOO', 'slow', 'become', 'bored', 'fair', 'amount', 'attention', 'span', 'totally', 'worth', 'ending', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'probably', 'think', 'going', 'happen', 'wife', 'actually', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'much', 'different.The', 'writers', 'film', 'were', 'also', 'aware', 'what', 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'other', 'horror', 'stories', 'disregarded', 'such', 'scenes', 'involving', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'kept', 'spying', 'new', 'neighbors', 'explaination', 'appearance', 'good', 'writing', ""n't"", 'play', 'typical', 'scary', 'kid', 'hiding', 'woods', 'planning', 'kill', 'people', 'going', 'play', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'him.The', 'acting', 'great', 'around', 'especially', 'wife', 'who', 'very', 'underrated', 'performance.I', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'horror', 'movies', 'there', 'Ones', 'deliver', 'suspense', 'storytelling', 'fantastic', 'endings']",Conjurer

Strange, unexplained events take place, seemingly having to do w/ an abandoned cabin on the property. CONJURER is an excellent supernatural thriller... I think. Its the sort of movie that could be about a curse / paranormal conspiracy, or a man driven by schizophrenic delusions. After watching it twice, I'm still split evenly on which type of film it is! The makers of CONJURER have done an expert job of balancing dark, magical images w/ paranoid thinking, and less-than-sane reactions on the part of the protagonist (Andrew Bowen). I was never quite sure whether he was being tormented by a sinister entity, or simply breaking away from reality. Though the epilogue hints at a possible answer, it could just be my own misinterpretation.

'Conjurer' won't win any points for originality, but at least the makers of this film have learned a little about atmosphere and that less is more in some cases. The story of an couple who move to a remote farmhouse to heal after losing their unborn child is both chilling and pretty smart. The acting is above average, but that doesn't mean it is without its flaws. The usual ""get the H E L L out of here"" thoughts will scream through your head, but the doesn't make this film any less effective.What I thought was really impressive is how the director could evoke chills in broad daylight!

1186867,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001EXE2YC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 4]","Conjurer (Clint Hutchison, 2008)Mediocre haunted-farm flick you've probably seen a dozen times before. Young professional couple Shawn (Big Bad Wolf's Andrew Bowen) and Helen (Dangerous Curves' Maxine Bahns) Burnett need a break from the big city after Helen miscarries, so Helen's brother Frank Higgins (The Dukes of Hazzard's John Schneider) buys them some property out in the country and plans to build them a new house on the site of a Civil War-era shack that local legend has it is haunted by the ghost of a witch named Hattie. While they're waiting for the new house to get built, they're living in an older one on the property. Strange things start happening around the old cabin, but it doesn't seem like anyone but Shawn notices them. Of course.Hutchison, whose previous directorial work consists of one short and a piece of the laughably silly horror anthology Terror Tract, takes this film down well-worn horror-trope paths without ever once veering off into new or interesting material; every piece of ham-handed foreshadowing we see is bound to lead exactly where you think it will. Having a female lead who can't act her way out of a paper bag doesn't help matters, either. On the upside, the film is reasonably well shot, and Bowen is convincing as a guy who doesn't know whether he's haunted or just crazy. Maybe worth renting if you have an hour and a half to kill and there's nothing else that looks appealing at the video store, but not all that hot. **",2,"Nothing new, not even a variation on the theme.",1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,1473,"['Conjurer', 'Clint', 'Hutchison', '2008', 'Mediocre', 'haunted-farm', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'dozen', 'times', 'before', 'Young', 'professional', 'couple', 'Shawn', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'Andrew', 'Bowen', 'Helen', 'Dangerous', 'Curves', 'Maxine', 'Bahns', 'Burnett', 'need', 'break', 'big', 'city', 'Helen', 'miscarries', 'Helen', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Higgins', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'John', 'Schneider', 'property', 'out', 'country', 'plans', 'build', 'new', 'house', 'site', 'Civil', 'War-era', 'shack', 'local', 'legend', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'witch', 'named', 'Hattie', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'new', 'house', 'get', 'built', ""'re"", 'living', 'older', 'one', 'property', 'Strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'old', 'cabin', ""n't"", 'seem', 'anyone', 'Shawn', 'course.Hutchison', 'previous', 'directorial', 'work', 'one', 'short', 'piece', 'laughably', 'silly', 'horror', 'anthology', 'Terror', 'Tract', 'film', 'down', 'well-worn', 'horror-trope', 'paths', 'ever', 'once', 'veering', 'off', 'new', 'interesting', 'material', 'piece', 'ham-handed', 'foreshadowing', 'see', 'bound', 'lead', 'exactly', 'where', 'think', 'will', 'Having', 'female', 'lead', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'either', 'upside', 'film', 'reasonably', 'well', 'shot', 'Bowen', 'convincing', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'haunted', 'just', 'crazy', 'Maybe', 'worth', 'renting', 'have', 'hour', 'half', 'kill', 'nothing', 'else', 'appealing', 'video', 'store', 'not', 'hot', '**']",Conjurer
