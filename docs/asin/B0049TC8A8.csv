1390209,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B0049TC8A8,Coulter Rail,"[0, 1]","Death Frenzy is not for everyone, that's for sure. Fans of samurai anime will be desperate for a faster, more coherent storyline with constant battles. Fans of mega-violence will likely find the story bland, disjointed, and short on vampires.Shigurui is a cruel snapshot of a twisted rivalry set against the backdrop of the worst feudal Japan has to offer. Females and males are sexually exploited for recreation. Loyalty to master and clan is bred and enforced with cult-like methods. This is not Bleach, Hellsing, or Ninja Scroll. This is an artistic experiment that pays off for a select audience, myself included. But I can see how most viewers would find the eccentricity hard to swallow. If successful, I hope to warn away buyers who would hate it and help to save their money, while still attracting potential fellow appreciators from that select audience. Let's get to it:***PROS***ANIMATION/ARTResembles Ninja Scroll (movie), but more detailed and reserved. Dark and moody, the cinematography resembles films like Citizen Kane, There Will be Blood, and Kurosawa's grimmer exploits. Human anatomy is a focal point and brings the viewer uncomfortably close to the violence. There are many cutaways to dead cicadas and water dripping from bamboo, which would seem like boring gimmicks to some, but meaningful paintings to others. The nudity is not fan-service but instead drifts between tantalizing and humiliating--once again, with anatomy and cinematography being king. This is a must-watch if you're a big fan of art themed in feudal Japan . . . unless you're turned off by intrusive, disturbing imagery.MUSIC/MOODThe music is a combination of traditional Japanese instruments and terrifying tones that force scenes to linger and hold tension, creating an effective audio-narrative that insists on a constant feeling of dread. In unison with the dynamic imagery, the soundtrack reaches for a hypnotic effect aimed at keeping the viewer spellbound and nervous. On the flipside, I can also see how such unrelenting dissonance could be considered a gimmick (style in place of substance). I was spellbound and nervous.STORYDeath Frenzy is about two samurai who are fated to be obsessed rivals. Their dojo becomes the backdrop for their plans against one another, and they each develop a special style of martial art (or ""kill move"") that's been forged by their own suffering. The master of the clan is a wicked old man who slips into dementia seasonally (like a hibernating bear), urinates on himself, uses his daughter as a sounding board for his sick impulses, and is the keeper of truly threatening secrets of martial arts. Everyone obeys him out of fear and respect. *BUYER BEWARE* This series has NO ENDING. It resembles ""Berserk"" in its narrative. If you follow along only to see who the better warrior is, you will be disappointed. The purpose of the series is to explore the makings of these two monsters of combat. The viewer must theorize who would be victorious. Did I want to see them brawl to the death? Oh, hell yes. But I respect the creators' choice.***CONS***LENGTHDespite respecting the artistic integrity of the piece, I would have liked to follow these two warriors all the way to the end. I wanted to see what kind of life could be livable after such horrific upbringings.OVERDOSE OF STYLEI loved the style of this show, but even I grew tired in some areas and wished for a less disjoined narrative and more concrete explanations. Having to interpret every single shard of this story as its own painting was taxing, but necessary to understand what the creators were trying to do. Its beauty is its fault, I suppose.I was deeply moved by this work, but would recommend it sparingly. It truly is a painting. For me, the Mona Lisa is just a well-painted picture of a half-smiling, sleepy chick, but to someone else, it's a window into the soul of an era. Likewise, Shigurui's resonance depends on personal perspective. If you're curious, take the plunge. If not, walk on to safer anime. I hope this helped.I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime. If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer you straight.",5,"Bold, Intrusive Art Experiment That Pays Off for a Select Crowd",1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,4198,"['Death', 'Frenzy', 'not', 'everyone', 'sure', 'Fans', 'samurai', 'anime', 'will', 'be', 'desperate', 'faster', 'more', 'coherent', 'storyline', 'constant', 'battles', 'Fans', 'mega-violence', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'story', 'bland', 'disjointed', 'short', 'vampires.Shigurui', 'cruel', 'snapshot', 'twisted', 'rivalry', 'set', 'backdrop', 'worst', 'feudal', 'Japan', 'offer', 'Females', 'males', 'are', 'sexually', 'exploited', 'recreation', 'Loyalty', 'master', 'clan', 'bred', 'enforced', 'cult-like', 'methods', 'not', 'Bleach', 'Hellsing', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'artistic', 'experiment', 'select', 'audience', 'included', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'find', 'eccentricity', 'hard', 'swallow', 'successful', 'hope', 'warn', 'away', 'buyers', 'who', 'would', 'hate', 'help', 'save', 'money', 'still', 'attracting', 'potential', 'fellow', 'appreciators', 'select', 'audience', 'Let', 'get', '***PROS***ANIMATION/ARTResembles', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'movie', 'more', 'detailed', 'reserved', 'Dark', 'moody', 'cinematography', 'films', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'Kurosawa', 'grimmer', 'exploits', 'Human', 'anatomy', 'focal', 'point', 'viewer', 'uncomfortably', 'close', 'violence', 'are', 'many', 'cutaways', 'dead', 'cicadas', 'water', 'dripping', 'bamboo', 'would', 'seem', 'boring', 'gimmicks', 'meaningful', 'paintings', 'others', 'nudity', 'not', 'fan-service', 'instead', 'drifts', 'tantalizing', 'humiliating', 'once', 'again', 'anatomy', 'cinematography', 'being', 'king', 'must-watch', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'art', 'themed', 'feudal', 'Japan', ""'re"", 'turned', 'off', 'intrusive', 'disturbing', 'imagery.MUSIC/MOODThe', 'music', 'combination', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'instruments', 'terrifying', 'tones', 'force', 'scenes', 'linger', 'hold', 'tension', 'creating', 'effective', 'audio-narrative', 'constant', 'feeling', 'dread', 'unison', 'dynamic', 'imagery', 'soundtrack', 'hypnotic', 'effect', 'aimed', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'spellbound', 'nervous', 'flipside', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'such', 'unrelenting', 'dissonance', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'gimmick', 'style', 'place', 'substance', 'was', 'spellbound', 'nervous.STORYDeath', 'Frenzy', 'two', 'samurai', 'who', 'are', 'fated', 'be', 'obsessed', 'rivals', 'dojo', 'backdrop', 'plans', 'one', 'develop', 'special', 'style', 'martial', 'art', 'kill', 'move', 'been', 'forged', 'own', 'suffering', 'master', 'clan', 'wicked', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'dementia', 'seasonally', 'hibernating', 'bear', 'daughter', 'sounding', 'board', 'sick', 'impulses', 'keeper', 'truly', 'threatening', 'secrets', 'martial', 'arts', 'Everyone', 'obeys', 'fear', 'respect', '*BUYER', 'BEWARE*', 'series', 'ENDING', 'Berserk', 'narrative', 'follow', 'along', 'only', 'see', 'who', 'better', 'warrior', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'purpose', 'series', 'explore', 'makings', 'two', 'monsters', 'combat', 'viewer', 'must', 'theorize', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'victorious', 'Did', 'want', 'see', 'brawl', 'death', 'Oh', 'hell', 'yes', 'respect', 'creators', 'choice', '***CONS***LENGTHDespite', 'respecting', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'piece', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'follow', 'two', 'warriors', 'way', 'end', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'kind', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'livable', 'such', 'horrific', 'upbringings.OVERDOSE', 'OF', 'STYLEI', 'loved', 'style', 'show', 'even', 'grew', 'tired', 'areas', 'wished', 'less', 'disjoined', 'narrative', 'more', 'concrete', 'explanations', 'Having', 'interpret', 'single', 'shard', 'story', 'own', 'painting', 'was', 'taxing', 'necessary', 'understand', 'what', 'creators', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'beauty', 'fault', 'suppose.I', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'work', 'would', 'recommend', 'sparingly', 'truly', 'painting', 'Mona', 'Lisa', 'just', 'well-painted', 'picture', 'half-smiling', 'sleepy', 'chick', 'someone', 'else', 'window', 'soul', 'era', 'Likewise', 'Shigurui', 'resonance', 'personal', 'perspective', ""'re"", 'curious', 'take', 'plunge', 'not', 'walk', 'safer', 'anime', 'hope', 'helped.I', ""'m"", 'animator', 'writer', 'frequently', 'pour', 'stacks', 'anime', 'was', 'helpful', 'tastes', 'seem', 'align', 'follow', ""'ll"", 'try', 'steer', 'straight']",N/A

1390211,A2AT08TWXCEUDR,B0049TC8A8,djfullshred,"[3, 3]","This is one of the darkest, most disturbing anime's I have seen as far as a TV series goes. Death Frenzy is an apt title for this. We are taken back nearly 400 years in Japan to a brutal time where life is cheap, and samurai are the enforcers of the land. Make no mistake, these are not heros doing great deeds to save the people. They are ruthless cold blooded killers to be feared, and practice their lethal sword art to dispatch anyone that dishonors them or challenges them in the most ruthless & efficient of ways.This was done by studio Madhouse (one of the best), and has great visual mixes of style. We often see collages of images - sometimes going between very artfull stills, color animation, pencil drawings, etc to keep your eyes happy. Scenes of bloody graphic violence between fighters, and rather depraved treatment towards women is prevelant, so it is not for the faint of heart.The big knock for people to be aware of is this is just part of the story, and just ends abruptly as if it were planned to keep going. The story is introduced with a tournament between two legendary but severely damaged samurai who are obviously bitter rivals, then jumps back in time to tell the story of how this all developed right before the match starts. However, after 13 episodes it ends and you realize they still have quite a ways to go to tell the story completely. I did not know this before watching, so was very disappointed at the end of episode 13 after getting rather hooked on this story.

1390215,ABSYIF0ONC2AF,B0049TC8A8,Lee,"[3, 4]","This anime is a prime good example of making a good manga into good anime.[Good]The visuals - They are really nice.Storyline is very good - It's more common to have good or great visuals, especially for Japanese anime. Visuals are usually just icing. Having a great storyline is another thing that is rare. The underlying themes, metaphors, and criticism of feudal Japan is very good. (Unfortunately you won't be able to fully appreciate it until you read the full story through the comic books.) Unlike other anime, there is no corniness or segments that are randomly thrown in to cater to socially awkward adolescents. It is just solid and brutal: violence with purpose.[Bad]The visuals - It tries to stay true to the manga, which is just too violent for my tastes. Even though I don't like it, I don't think it would be the same if you removed it. I feel that it's meant to be uncomfortable.Not 'complete' - This anime series was never finished. If you want to know what happens in the very end you have to find the comics. It's a decent substitute since the anime essentially used the manga as a storyboard almost scene for scene with little variation. This 'complete' series only covers about 1/3 of the total story. The manga series wasn't perfect either because it includes a really weird side story that seemed to have been done only for filler (you'll know it when you read it - hint: it involves a ""frog"").Misc:Unlike another reviewer, I strongly disagree that this series should have been cut into 2 hours; that would have totally ruined it.

The style is extremely arty, especially during the first few episodes - many many shots of dead cicadas, etc. The pace is also extremely slow, and the ending won't make much sense unless you paid attention to one particular line from the narrator in the middle of the series. You should also take care not to be confused by the flashback near the beginning (it might be more accurate to say the show starts with a flashforward).At the same time, this show is extremely violent and depraved. Apart from various people having their guts spilled and many different body parts chopped off, there are sex scenes, including a senile old man trying to seduce his daughter, and, laughably, one instance of autofellatio. There is a serious point to the shock value, which is that the absolute obedience demanded of dojo members, combined with an obsession to be the best swordsman, leads them to make themselves into something ultimately much less than human. But the execution of these themes is always over the top and exploitative.All this means that this show is for a particular audience, and not for the mainstream. You'll know if it's for you from the above description. Even allowing for the specialised tastes this show caters to, it is less than perfect, particularly in its pacing.

1390223,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0049TC8A8,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 3]","With a backdrop of true events and based on the manga series written by Takayuki Yamaguchi, the anime series ""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is a very violent tale of lust, dark ambition and vengeance that takes place during the 1600's in the Tokugawa period. Yamaguchi took his ideas from the novel called ""Surugajyo Gozenjiai"" and with director Hiroshi Hamasaki, the two have put together a harrowingly beautiful anime series that pretty much took my breath away. The series is about the famed Kogan school of Japanese swordplay, which became famous in the Kagegawa region, mainly because of the tutelage of a mysterious swordsman named Iwamoto Kogan. Unlike the chambara films we've seen in the past, this is not a series about honor, loyalty and duty; it is a melodrama about a school, its sensei and his apprentices. IT IS NOT YOUR KID'S Anime.The series begins with two scarred warriors facing off against each other in a brutal contest to satisfy the bloodlust of a cruel lord Tadanaga Tokugawa; a blind swordsman named Irako Seigen (voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) and a one-armed swordsman called Gennosuke Fijiki (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa). These two warriors carry the scars of a very violent and twisted past. They were bitter rivals under the tutelage of sword master Kogan Iwamoto (Seizou Katou); the two aspired to attain the mastery of the Kogan style secret techniques and to be worthy of their sensei's beautiful daughter Mie (Houko Kuwashima). This is the story of these two warriors who had mortally wounded each other--physically, emotionally and psychologically, all for the honor to become the heir to the Kogan school. Now they must gird themselves for one last battle...""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is a series divided into 12 parts (2 discs). The presentation contains beautiful animation, visceral and violent swordplay, and has been noted because of the amount of graphic sex and nudity. The screenplay and direction are both beautiful and ugly. It is beautiful because it utilizes superb style in its cinematography. The colors lean towards the use of earth colors, and a little muted which adds to its brooding, intense mood and gloomy style. This has been done to reflect on the bleakness of its subject matter which brings us to its ugly face. The ugliness I speak of hover mostly around in its disquieting storyline. The subject matter is about the darkness within the ""way of Bushido"". I wouldn't say that these men are true samurai who follow the ideals of that code--these men are very human, full of lust, greed, betrayal, and ambitions. Unlike other chambara features we have been privy to, they are NOT men to be admired for their character; they may be admired for their skills but they are mostly to be feared.The screenplay by Yamaguchi is quite intense, taut and very moody. In the school, we see the workings of its inner circles, and the rules that apply to the Iwamoto residence. The feature also utilizes some very effective use of metaphors and symbolism. The Cicada is an insect used to signify apprenticeship because of its noisy, vibrating qualities. The dragonfly represents unrelenting totality because of the straight direction in its flight. The Butterfly is used to signify beauty and the unpredictable nature of one's future. I thought it was wise direction to use the ""flashing"" naked effect when one engages in swordplay--I think when fighting, one's nature is utterly exposed and one is unprotected. Sure, it also displays the movement of muscles in engagements but it was a lot more than that. The direction relies on some fragmented sequences, to further give its characters their dimensions in the story. Quite clever and ingenious, the proceedings manage to maintain its intensity in not just its graphic violence.The action sequences aren't really your run-of-the-mill choreography. Slow-motion animation, freeze frames and close-ups are utilized. The swordplay is very graphic and it never holds back. Eyes and limbs are severed, beheadings, bowels and entrails are graphically shown, and looks very reminiscent to Japanese effects we've all been privy to. Dismemberments are done quite often, as well as ""skinning"" and faces and bones being smashed in. The thing is director Hamasaki does the Blood and Gore in a very artistic kind of way, it was impressive--not too repulsive but certainly shocking. The combatants imagine just how they would react to an attack before the actual combat begins which serves as a sort of a teaser to the viewer.The feature does have its share of graphic violence towards women, but I don't think it glorifies it at all. It uses those actions to display the cruelty of its characters, most specifically sensei Kogan; who manhandles his daughter and has a lot of sex with his mistress, lady Iku (Emi Shinohara) when he is in a state on dementia. Oh, this feature has a lot of graphic sex and nudity. There are some very twisted displays of torture and violence; castrations by fire, cut-off nipples and burned breasts are what you are in for. Incest and sick desires are also hinted at. Yes, this is one disturbing anime feature and not for the weak of heart.The characters are for the most part very human, in a way they give in to their carnal desires, pride and blind obedience--it does have certain undertones about curses and karma. Irako is the prideful apprentice, who almost whose goal is to attain fame and fortune--he is also a womanizer and proves to be his main weakness. Mie is the daughter of the master swordsman, Kogan; she is dutiful and becomes imbalanced in a way. Lady Iku is the beautiful mistress of Kogan who is always taunted at by children and believes her body to be cursed. Iwamoto Kogan is the sensei who becomes demented from time to time for reasons unspecified; probably due to his very violent ways. I suppose if a hero is to be had from this feature it would be Gennosuke, the stoic pupil, ever obedient to his sensei who carries a grudge against his rival--Gennosuke is driven to master the art. Let's not forget Gonzaemon Ushimata (Yosaku Yara), his one flaw may be his blind obedience.The animation is fluid and very beautiful and it was almost photorealistic. There are no bulging, over-expressive eyes and the facial expressions speak a lot for their emotions and manner. I thought it was wise for the animators to give its characters certain features quite unique to one another. Each separate scene have a use of one color hue to express its mood, but stays within earth colors--to signify its worldly workings in its environment. If there are some flaws, it would fall on some minor details undefined and it does lack some closure.""SHIGURUI DEATH FRENZY"" is one twisted and brilliant animated production. It successfully reaches a plateau that surprisingly mixes beauty and repulsive qualities. It was almost as if this may be the final product if Akira Kurosawa and Takashi Miike had collaborated. It is so beautiful that one would be hard-pressed to say that it is all about disturbing imagery yet NONE can deny its visceral, brooding tone. It does efficiently represent what it is trying to say and gets its message across; The beauty of swordsmanship can lead to one's damnation when wielded irresponsibly. ""Shigurui Death Frenzy"" is beautiful, and magnificently executed, but it also leaves a repulsive taste in your mouth. I am very impressed as to how it managed to balance beauty and artistry with ugliness and repulsive nature. I almost didn't want the show to end.Highly Recommended!
