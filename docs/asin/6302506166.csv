Trying to incorporate other Marvel characters into the (reasonably) ""real"" universe of the Bixby series just didn't work.  OK, so this movie isn't terribly believable either, but Bixby gives his usual credible performance and the plot doesn't simply rehash the David Banner-on-the-run formula.  In fact, as Banner himself comments, he actually gets to SEE his alter-ego for the first time (via videotape).  And that's the real appeal of this surprisingly affecting story...not the dumb terrorist subplot.A sad end to a wonderful character, but certainly worth watching.",3,Best of the t.v. movies...but still not that great,1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,669,"['fan', 'original', 'series', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'first', 'two', 'reunion', 'movies', 'Trying', 'incorporate', 'other', 'Marvel', 'characters', 'reasonably', 'real', 'universe', 'Bixby', 'series', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'OK', 'movie', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'believable', 'Bixby', 'usual', 'credible', 'performance', 'plot', ""n't"", 'simply', 'rehash', 'David', 'Banner-on-the-run', 'formula', 'fact', 'Banner', 'comments', 'actually', 'SEE', 'alter-ego', 'first', 'time', 'videotape', 'real', 'appeal', 'surprisingly', 'affecting', 'story', 'not', 'dumb', 'terrorist', 'subplot.A', 'sad', 'end', 'wonderful', 'character', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

In the world of comics, death is not always permanent.  Marvel recently killed off Captain America in the comics.  I don't read Captain America, but will bet money that he is alive and well or soon to be so.  Even the Man of Steel was clobbered to death by a Hulk-like monster from Krypton and then came back after four other Supermen showed up claiming to be the real Man of Steel.  And about the same time that Superman was being clobbered by Doomsday, Batman was being clobbered by another Hulk wannabe called Bain.  He ended up clobbering Batman to the point that he crippled him, and was then defeated by another guy who was being trained by Bruce Wayne.  This guy became the new Batman and was a rougher Batman than the original. Amazingly, Bruce Wayne is miraculosly healed and fights his sucessor for the role of Batman (which he wins back).  So, getting back to the TV Hulk, this movie was not meant to be the end but ended up being the end. It is too bad.

This 1990 movie, the final time that star Bill Bixby would appear onscreen with Lou Ferrigno, continues the quest of main character Dr. David Banner to rid himself of the green mutation that takes over whenever his survival is threatened.The movie begins with Banner working as a janitor at a top secret government research lab. The scientist in charge of the research at the lab is conducting some of the same radiation experiments that led Banner to his original predicament many years before. Someone is breaking into the lab late at night and working on the experiments, helping the scientist. The scientist is shocked to discover Banner - whom he took to be a low level sanitation technician - is the one aiding in his research and, after learning of his plight, decides to help him rid himself of the monster inside.It is here that the movie takes an unfortunate tangent. Some unidentified group - they act, look and sound like the KGB - learns of the research being conducted at the lab and decides to steal it, using one of their top female agents to infiltrate the complex and steal the papers.Making her entrance into the lab at a critical point in the procedure to cure Banner a fire is started and the Hulk emerges, leading Banner on an inexorable course of action that will ultimately force him to choose between life and death and love and survival.Being a television production the picture quality on this DVD is extremely limited and it seems to be merely an extended episode of the television series. We have the same cheesy green monster make-up and the trademark slow motion sequences of the Hulk breaking through brick walls, crashing down doors and even  altering the course of a private jet.The audio is merely serviceable at best and the haunting, memorable theme music, that would play over the final credits of the televsion show, is saved until the final sad moments.The only extra features on this DVD is a ""Fox Flix"" section which includes trailers for ""Daredevil"", ""X-Men, ""X-2"" and the 2001 remake of ""Planet of the Apes"". No TV spots for the main feature are included and no cast or crew bios - both would have been welcome additions.In the end, even given its low retail price, this is really only a DVD for fans of the original series. With test audiences apparently giving the upcoming feature film poor marks, perhaps this summers box office will deliver the ultimate blow to the venerable franchise - the final death of the incredible Hulk.",3,The DVD could have been better,1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,2774,"['had', 'opportunity', 'check', 'out', 'review', 'copy', 'DVD', 'Hulk', 'storm', 'movie', 'theaters', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'popular', 'comic', 'strip', 'character', 'adventures', 'highly', 'successful', '1970s', 'television', 'series', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'have', 'begun', 'appear', 'DVD', '1990', 'movie', 'final', 'time', 'star', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'would', 'appear', 'onscreen', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'quest', 'main', 'character', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Banner', 'rid', 'green', 'mutation', 'over', 'whenever', 'survival', 'threatened.The', 'movie', 'Banner', 'working', 'janitor', 'top', 'secret', 'government', 'research', 'lab', 'scientist', 'charge', 'research', 'lab', 'conducting', 'same', 'radiation', 'experiments', 'led', 'Banner', 'original', 'predicament', 'many', 'years', 'Someone', 'breaking', 'lab', 'late', 'night', 'working', 'experiments', 'helping', 'scientist', 'scientist', 'shocked', 'discover', 'Banner', 'whom', 'took', 'be', 'low', 'level', 'sanitation', 'technician', 'one', 'aiding', 'research', 'learning', 'plight', 'help', 'rid', 'monster', 'inside.It', 'here', 'movie', 'unfortunate', 'tangent', 'unidentified', 'group', 'act', 'look', 'sound', 'KGB', 'learns', 'research', 'being', 'conducted', 'lab', 'decides', 'steal', 'using', 'one', 'top', 'female', 'agents', 'infiltrate', 'complex', 'steal', 'papers.Making', 'entrance', 'lab', 'critical', 'point', 'procedure', 'cure', 'Banner', 'fire', 'started', 'Hulk', 'emerges', 'leading', 'Banner', 'inexorable', 'course', 'action', 'will', 'ultimately', 'force', 'choose', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'survival.Being', 'television', 'production', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'extremely', 'limited', 'be', 'merely', 'extended', 'episode', 'television', 'series', 'have', 'same', 'cheesy', 'green', 'monster', 'make-up', 'trademark', 'slow', 'motion', 'sequences', 'Hulk', 'breaking', 'brick', 'walls', 'crashing', 'down', 'doors', 'even', 'altering', 'course', 'private', 'jet.The', 'audio', 'merely', 'serviceable', 'best', 'haunting', 'memorable', 'theme', 'music', 'would', 'play', 'final', 'credits', 'televsion', 'show', 'saved', 'final', 'sad', 'moments.The', 'only', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'Fox', 'Flix', 'section', 'trailers', 'Daredevil', 'X-Men', 'X-2', '2001', 'remake', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'TV', 'spots', 'main', 'feature', 'are', 'included', 'cast', 'crew', 'bios', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'end', 'even', 'given', 'low', 'retail', 'price', 'really', 'only', 'DVD', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'test', 'audiences', 'apparently', 'giving', 'upcoming', 'feature', 'film', 'poor', 'marks', 'perhaps', 'summers', 'box', 'office', 'will', 'deliver', 'ultimate', 'blow', 'venerable', 'franchise', 'final', 'death', 'incredible', 'Hulk']",N/A

316648,A3N0AXNEZVE686,6302506166,Hound Dog,"[0, 0]","Perhaps the less said about this 1990 television film the better, as David Banner finally escapes the curse of the Incredible Hulk by plummeting to his death following a small plane's explosion.  Minus the poignant performances of the late Bill Bixby and Elizabeth (Highlander: The Raven) Gracen, there isn't much else to see here, unfortunately, as co-star Lou Ferrigno's presence again is demoted to only a few quick scenes.  Per the standard TV film formula, David Banner is within arm's reach of a permanent scientific cure from his monstrous alter-ego, but it is sadly not to be.  Throw in some unsettling Russian spies (including a chilling Anna Katarina and Andreas Katsulas) as the ruthless villains, and the film demonstrates some surprisingly dark potential.  However, the all too obvious budget constraints (i.e. Bixby opts not to even show his Hulk metamorphosis on camera this time) severely limit the entertainment value of his final Hulk project.It has been reported before that Bixby intended a subsequent ""rebirth"" film featuring a talking Hulk and quite possibly Brigitte Nielsen as She-Hulk (per the few publicity photos taken of her for the role), but his failing health prematurely ended the project.  Bixby subsequently passed away of cancer in 1993, leaving a timeless and classy legacy as one of television's greatest reluctant heroes.  His last appearance as David Banner deserved a far more satisfying goodbye than this film's budget could afford him.  Yet, as its director, at least Bixby could end the saga that he and Ferrigno began together on his own terms.Rating: 4.5 **** /10.  To complete David Banner's television journey, it is worth seeing once, but the overall film is mostly a disappointment.

316651,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,6302506166,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","The Death of the Incredible Hulk is the series finale to the series that signifies the end of a hero and legend. David Banner is now working as a janitor at a high security government facility deep in Portland, Oregon under the name David Bellamy. In addition to that, he pretends to be mentally challenged. He uses this as a ploy to sneak into the facility's lab that is run by Dr. Pratt. Banner is very interested in Pratt's work and changes his nucleobase formulas on a erase board that are incorrect, unbeknownst, helping Pratt. When Pratt discovers that his formulas are being changed, he stays at the lab late at night to catch who's doing it. When he discovers that David has been sneaking into his lab, he threatens to call security unless David tells him what he's up to. David reveals his true identity to Pratt, telling him that he's Dr. David Banner. A shocked Dr. Pratt claims he can help Banner with his problem, through his guidance. David seems reluctant at first but eventually puts his trust in him.Pratt and Banner stay at the lab late one night to run a test on Banner. Enter Russian spy, Jasmine. Jasmine was ordered by ruthless communist, Kasha through Russian leader, Voshenko to infiltrate the government lab and steal Pratt's formulas to create the ""Perfect Soldier"". The infiltration leads to a physical confrontation between Pratt and Jasmine, which accidentally puts Pratt in the hospital with a coma and brings out the Hulk. After Jasmine fails to steal the formula, she's ordered to be killed by Voshenko, who just happens to be her own sister, Bella! Fate unexpectedly links Banner and Jasmine together who fall in love and build their trust in each other. After Dr. Pratt and his wife, Amy are taken hostage by Kasha and Bella and their communist cronies, David and Jasmine put it all on the line to save the lives of the Pratts. Doing so may just lead to The Death of the Incredible Hulk._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Sidenotes:- Just like the other 2 made for tv Hulk movies, The Death of The Incredible Hulk gives off a lot of elemental vibes to the movie to really draw viewers in. The Death of The Incredible Hulk takes all the moods from the previous 2 Hulk movies and mixes them into the The Death of The Incredible Hulk giving the movie a sense of drama, action, thrills, and even romance. Yes, romance as there is one brief sex scene in this movie to really draw in viewers.- This was not the planned ending for the series of The Incredible Hulk. Following this movie there were plans for another sequel titles The Rebirth/Revenge of The Incredible Hulk that would've picked right up where Death left off. Apparently that movie would've seen Hulk be given the ability to talk as well as Banner's intelligence. It's also been said that superheros such as Iron Man and Spiderman would've been in these movies as well-  The makeup artists go all out in making Lou look the creepiest he's ever been in the entire series. White contact lenses, creepy teeth, and the ugly green wig that was used in the previous 2 films were now replaced with an ugly ginger mullet wig that looks like Hulkie suffered from electric shock.- The woman who plays Jasmine in this movie isn't a very good actress. Most of her emotions in the film seem forced and bland rather than being realistic. It kind of bothers me every time I watch this. I feel like they could've found someone better to play the Jasmine character- Banner's first Hulk-Out occurs after he follows a seemingly ""homeless"" guy into a back alley. You'd think that after 5 seasons and 2 made for tv movies, Banner would've known better than to follow someone down a back alley at night.- This was the last human Hulk movie until the 2003 Summer motion-picture blockbuster, directed by Ang LeeAll in all, The Death of The Incredible Hulk is a legendary and awesome yet sad end to tv series Incredible Hulk. I was really interested in seeing the planned Rebirth of The Incredible Hulk film that was planned for 1993 but unfortunately Bill Bixby's illness and unfortunate, yet coincidental death prevented the movie from being filmed.

316655,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6302506166,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[16, 16]","""The Incredible Hulk"" ran on CBS from 1978 to 1982, starring Bill Bixby as Dr. David Bruce Banner and body builder Lou Ferrigno as his giant green alter ego.  The television series kept Banner on the run, while reporter Jack McGee (Jack Colvin) dogged his heels.  Basically it was a set up similar to ""The Fugitive,"" except every week at some point Banner would have to become the Hulk.  The key line was so obvious they worked it into the opening credits when Banner warned the reporter: ""Mr. McGee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.""  Fans certainly did, even if they never read the Marvel comic books about ol' greenskin.  When the television series went off the air NBC aired an animated version of ""The Incredible Hulk"" as part of its Saturday morning lineup that run from September 1982 to September 1985.In 1988, Bixby, Ferrigno and Colvin returned for the first in a series of television movies, ""The Incredible Hulk Returns.""  This was followed the next year by ""The Trial of the Incredible Hulk,"" which ditched the reporter character and replaced him with another Marvel superhero, Daredevil (a.k.a. Matt Murdock).  Then in 1989 we have what proved to be the last television movie of the Hulk, which makes sense when you look at the title of the film (there were rumors of a sequel, but Bixby's death in 1993 made that impossible).  Bixby directed this television movie, so you have to think this is how he wanted to the series to end.People think Banner is dead, so he is laying low, calling himself David Bellamy and working as a janitor at a high security research facility.  David seems to be a bit slow, always forgetting his thermos and leaving by the wrong exit, but he has been there for several months and the guards are used to his slow ways.  Of course this is just a pretense so that when everybody goes home he can sneak into the genetics lab.  Ostensibly he is looking for a way to reverse what has happened to him and get rid of the Hulk, but he is also helping Dr. Ronald Pratt (Philip Sterling) with his research by correcting his mistakes.  Pratt is trying to figure out who is helping him along and is surprised when he discovers it is the janitor.  But he understands perfectly when he learns that David is the famous David Banner and agrees to help.Meanwhile, there are evil foreigners who want to get their hands on Pratt's research and use it to create an army of perfect soldiers.  Kasha (Andreas Katsulas, appearing without the massive makeup we remember from ""Babylon 5"") has coerced the beautiful Jasmin (Elizabeth Gracen), mistress of disguise, to break into the lab and steal Pratt's secrets.  Even worse, Jasmin's sister, Bella (Anna Katarina), would not mind seeing her dead.  Jasmin gets into Pratt's laboratory in the middle of an experiment with Banner, which means, of course, that the Hulk is going to appear.  Now all the pieces are in play.What is somewhat surprising is that the script by Gerald Di Pego, who also did ""The Trial of the Incredible Hulk,"" turns the last half of the movie into more of a romance.  Fate has thrown David and Jasmin (pronounced ""Yasmin"" and not ""Jasmine"") together, and they fall for each other.  In terms of this plotline that seems a bit of a stretch, but then technically the first Hulk movie (i.e, it was released on video as one) was the two-part television episode with Mariette Hartley as Dr. Caroline Fields, where she dies and we all cry.  Clearly Bixby is interested in provoking that sort of response for the end of this one.There is certainly an element of pathos to the finale of this one, but the big moment is not really set up that well.  I had trouble accepting the relationship between Jasmin and David, so I had to play catch up.

Is he at the shooting range practicing aiming his tranquilizer gun so he doesn't shoot himself in the leg like he did the times before???7.

Is he Luke's Father???You get the point... a prominent character from the original series, yet again, is totally ignore by Mr. Bixby (part from a cameo in RETURN OF THE HULK).  Jack Colvin (aka Jack McGee), as you well know, is the most celebrated character actor of the 20th century and possibly of all time.  His performances with the likes of John Wayne, Charles Bronson, Burt Lancaster, Robert Redford, and Rock Hudson (to just name a few) are well documented and are considered works of genius.  One of the finest roles for Colvin is, of course, Jack McGee.  His portrayal of Jack as a disheveled, obsessed, lonely, kindhearted, determined, slightly asexual with a keen sense of style (i.e., those sunglasses from the original pilot episode), and with an extremely dark sense of humor.  Luckily for us, Colvin studied under the brilliant Michael Chekhov (RIP) and is now currently shaping the minds of young actors hoping to learn from one the absolute masters of the craft.  There may never be another Jack Colvin in my lifetime but the possibilities have improved.The movie, however, is at best an above average episode of the series (and definitely the best of the TV movies).  The whole Russian Spy thing is ridiculous but at least Banner ""gets some"" (if you know what I mean) before he dies.

Couldn't Banner have plastic surgery to keep the authorities off his trail?  I was hoping that Lou Ferrigno would have thought of this idea because as a TV movie it still could have held up.  I would have liked to see the screenplay for the sequel.  I wonder if it's available on the web. I would have loved to have seen what Bixby had intended for future movies.  It's too bad that this didn't go on because the TV movies were better than a lot of the series.  It was basically hit or miss for the four and a half years they were on the air. With the TV movies the stakes were higher and the quality was better.  The Hulk in the TV movies seemed to be more like the one in the comic and I have to say dispite all the CGI in the world the movie won't match what Bixby did in the series.,5,An Incredible ending ...too bad there wasn't a sequel,1096675200,"10 2, 2004",2004,861,"['lot', 'reviews', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'went', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'Could', ""n't"", 'Banner', 'have', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'keep', 'authorities', 'trail', 'was', 'hoping', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'idea', 'TV', 'movie', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'screenplay', 'sequel', 'wonder', 'available', 'web', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'Bixby', 'had', 'intended', 'future', 'movies', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'TV', 'movies', 'were', 'better', 'lot', 'series', 'was', 'basically', 'hit', 'miss', 'four', 'half', 'years', 'were', 'air', 'TV', 'movies', 'stakes', 'were', 'higher', 'quality', 'was', 'better', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'movies', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'one', 'comic', 'have', 'say', 'dispite', 'CGI', 'world', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'match', 'what', 'Bixby', 'did', 'series']",N/A

That is what I thought the title of the movie means. Ridding himself of the creature has always been his goal. That was what he had in mind in the movie but the experiment backfired.  Overall, the film was good. There are a few surprises.

Good movie in all yes it does have a cheesy areas but not to many.  Bill Bixby whom is no longer with us puts a finally ending to the Incredible Hulk series which he was a part of from the 70's into the 80's.  I would have like to seen another hero involved in this movie( like the Trial of The Incredible Hulk with Dare Devil in the Mix) or the Return of the incredible Hulk with Thor) but none the less it still is worth buying for any fan of this great and ground breaking serious.,5,The End....,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,550,"['movie', 'was', 'last', 'see', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'Dr', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Good', 'movie', 'yes', 'have', 'cheesy', 'areas', 'not', 'many', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'whom', 'longer', 'finally', 'ending', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'series', 'was', 'part', '70', '80', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'hero', 'involved', 'movie', 'Trial', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Dare', 'Devil', 'Mix', 'Return', 'incredible', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'none', 'less', 'still', 'worth', 'buying', 'fan', 'great', 'ground', 'breaking', 'serious']",N/A

I did always wonder though why MacGee wasn't in it. Its like he just dropped off the face of the Earth. Or maybe he finally gave up on catching the Hulk..but that's so unlike his character. Anywho I thought this was a good way to end it. Although as I later learned a few years after seeing it that they had plans for another movie entitled: ""The Rebirth of the Hulk."" But Bixby died before they could start fliming so they scrapped it. Which didn't make since to me...they could have still made it..but just had it to where another person was cursed with the curse of the Hulk. I think that would have worked really well. I had also heard rumors that they were going to make a She Hulk tv movie..but of course they never did.
