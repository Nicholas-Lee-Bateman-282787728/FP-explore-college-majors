942140,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B000BHZ2B4,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[8, 11]","Brian Herzlinger stars in and directed this engaging romantic-comedy of sorts. A romantic-comedy that also happens to be a documentary, following Brian's journey of attempting to get a date with actress Drew Barrymore. Brian's loved her since he was a kid, was a member of the fan club, and even has the original letters and pictures from joining the club. There's no doubt: Brian's the real deal. An uber-fan who really likes Drew. In the real world, the man would simply call the girl and ask for a date, but in Hollywood, there are no guarantees that you'll even be able to reach the girl!This is an engaging, sweetly made film. A movie for kids and dreamers. Certainly not for the cynical, it'll instantly make you smile and believe that anything is possible. Even if you're a virtual nobody. The lasting impact you're left with is that you're capable of doing anything that seems entirely impossible. Nothing is impossible. Improbable maybe. But never impossible.Brian Herzlinger is, simply put, a total doll. Drew would be stupid to not want to go on a date with this charming, bumbling, Jewish boy from New Jersey. And you'll be stupid not to at least crack a smile during this movie, if not jump up at the conclusion and cheer for our hero.",5,Absolutley No Reason to NOT Like This Movie!,1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,1248,"['Brian', 'Herzlinger', 'stars', 'directed', 'engaging', 'romantic-comedy', 'sorts', 'romantic-comedy', 'also', 'be', 'documentary', 'following', 'Brian', 'journey', 'attempting', 'get', 'date', 'actress', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Brian', 'loved', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'member', 'fan', 'club', 'even', 'original', 'letters', 'pictures', 'joining', 'club', 'doubt', 'Brian', 'real', 'deal', 'uber-fan', 'who', 'really', 'Drew', 'real', 'world', 'man', 'would', 'simply', 'call', 'girl', 'ask', 'date', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'guarantees', ""'ll"", 'even', 'be', 'able', 'reach', 'girl', 'engaging', 'sweetly', 'made', 'film', 'movie', 'kids', 'dreamers', 'Certainly', 'not', 'cynical', ""'ll"", 'instantly', 'make', 'smile', 'believe', 'anything', 'possible', 'Even', ""'re"", 'virtual', 'nobody', 'lasting', 'impact', ""'re"", 'left', ""'re"", 'capable', 'doing', 'anything', 'entirely', 'impossible', 'Nothing', 'impossible', 'Improbable', 'maybe', 'never', 'impossible.Brian', 'Herzlinger', 'simply', 'put', 'total', 'doll', 'Drew', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'date', 'charming', 'bumbling', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'New', 'Jersey', ""'ll"", 'be', 'stupid', 'not', 'least', 'crack', 'smile', 'movie', 'not', 'jump', 'up', 'conclusion', 'cheer', 'hero']",N/A

All true, aspiring film maker Brian Herzlinger has a huge crush on Drew Barrymore and decides to take the winnings he got from a game show, use it as a budget, and gives himself 30 days to get a date with Drew.A project such as this could be very tacky but the sincerity of his quest carries this whole film.  Brian is a charming, regular guy and the lengths to which he goes to work through people who know Drew is often hilarious.  As the film goes on you get so caught up in his venture you can't help but imagine yourself working to make a dream come true.You must watch through this whole thing to encounter the last 30 minutes that will put you on an emotional roller coaster.  I actually cried with this documentary !!  The payoff at the end will fill your heart.Original, daring, creative and filled with heart this documentary is a must for anyone who has a dream that could possibly be within reach but fear holds you back.

And not even a real date really, more like a lunch a or dinner outing with somebody whos engaged and will always be completely out of any reach for most real men.However , we arent really talking about a real man in ""My Date with Drew"". We are talking about a hyperactive, struggling, quite possibly gay, Jewish 27 year old nobody who really needs to get a life. So maybe theres hope after all for all you losers out there. That is the real message of this film.Whew ...I needed to get that off my chest. Having said that , there is no denying that ""My Date with Drew"" is a somewhat charming documentary about the underdog in all of us.The movie itself isn't that great & isn't all that entertaining....but it does have a satisfying conclusion....even if it's not the one you'd originally expect.Brian, the guy who desperately wants to meet Drew comes off as lovable......but also as a HUGE dork who ultimately should be focused on getting his S*** together instead of chasing around his childhood crush.Hopefully Brian made some money off this project or otherwise this guy is headed for trouble!This movie isn't the worst.

942144,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000BHZ2B4,Brian E. Erland,"[3, 4]","First let me begin by saying that I didn't want to waste my time viewing this film. Why would I want to sit through a true life documentary film about an obsessive-compulsive twenty something fan still suffering from a childhood crush with an actress (Drew Barrymore) I didn't really like anyway. The only reason I did was because my daughter wanted me to watch it with her, so it was one of those quality time together opportunities I simply couldn't pass on.With that all said I must now admit that I actually ended up enjoying the low-budget '03 movie, `My Date with Drew.' The main reason for this unexpected change in opinion was the star of the film, the obsessive-compulsive playing himself, Brian Herzlinger. Watching him experiencing the full range of human emotions in his quest for his dream date was an absolute delight.The film also reveals a delightful glimpse into the quirky machinations of the Hollywood lifestyle and the all important process of discovering ""who knows who"" as he assembles a string of personal connections that will ultimately lead to a face to face introduction with his beloved Drew. Watch Brian and his group of co-conspirators comb the entertainment industry in search of a way to contact the elusive star. Radio interviews, billboards, websites, endless phone calls and fake backstage passes to private parties lead the viewer on a dizzying chase as time and money evaporate and all appears lost.Definitely worth a viewing and just think how much more you'll enjoy it if you happen to be a Drew Barrymore fan.",3,A Field Guide To Meeting Your Dream Girl,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,1549,"['First', 'let', 'begin', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'viewing', 'film', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'sit', 'true', 'life', 'documentary', 'film', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'twenty', 'something', 'fan', 'still', 'suffering', 'childhood', 'crush', 'actress', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'anyway', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'was', 'daughter', 'wanted', 'watch', 'was', 'one', 'quality', 'time', 'opportunities', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'pass', 'on.With', 'said', 'must', 'now', 'admit', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'low-budget', ""'03"", 'movie', 'Date', 'Drew', 'main', 'reason', 'unexpected', 'change', 'opinion', 'was', 'star', 'film', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'playing', 'Brian', 'Herzlinger', 'Watching', 'experiencing', 'full', 'range', 'human', 'emotions', 'quest', 'dream', 'date', 'was', 'absolute', 'delight.The', 'film', 'also', 'delightful', 'glimpse', 'quirky', 'machinations', 'Hollywood', 'lifestyle', 'important', 'process', 'discovering', 'who', 'who', 'string', 'personal', 'connections', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'face', 'face', 'introduction', 'beloved', 'Drew', 'Watch', 'Brian', 'group', 'co-conspirators', 'comb', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'search', 'way', 'contact', 'elusive', 'star', 'Radio', 'interviews', 'billboards', 'websites', 'endless', 'phone', 'calls', 'fake', 'backstage', 'passes', 'private', 'parties', 'lead', 'viewer', 'dizzying', 'chase', 'time', 'money', 'evaporate', 'lost.Definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'just', 'think', 'how', 'much', 'more', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'happen', 'be', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'fan']",N/A

942147,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BHZ2B4,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 12]","I loved My Date with Drew.  Yes, it's a documentary, but it is very funny and personable and even a little bit inspirational.  We all had crushes on celebrities during our youth (and some of us, as adults, still do), and we all dreamed of meeting the superstar objects of our affections.  At 27, Brian Herzlinger still had a life-long crush on Drew Barrymore.  When he won eleven hundred bucks on a game show (with Drew Barrymore as the winning answer - that's fate, that is), he decided to use the money to pursue a dream - his dream of a date with Drew.  Yes, seeing as how he was unemployed at the time, he probably should have used the money for more practical things - bills, for example - but the guy had a dream and he went for it (which is more than a lot of us can say).  Thanks to a retailer's policy of letting you return purchases after thirty days, he got himself a camera, assembled all of his friends, and filmed his efforts to win a date with Drew within 30 days.  Is it possible for a nobody to get a date with one of the most famous people on the planet?  The odds were definitely against him.  The ups and downs of his personal quest certainly make for a uniquely entertaining experience, one which most of us can identify with in a number of ways.Brian was a nobody, but he wasn't as big a nobody as, well me, for example.  As an aspiring filmmaker, he was already out there in Hollywood fluttering around the fringes of the business, he knew several people with movie-related jobs and a range of connections, and he had a great network of friends who supported him as well as helped him with the technological aspects of the whole documentary he was making on the experience.  I thought Brian himself was quite likeable; watching him bounce back and forth between euphoria and resignation as events unfolded cannot help but take you back down memory lane a little ways.  It's not an auspicious beginning as Brian asks strangers on the street for help and advice, but his crew of supporters takes the project in hand and commences a full-court press of an effort.  They talk to people in the business, as well as folks who know someone who knows someone who knows Drew; they land interviews with the writer of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, Corey Feldman, and others who actually know Drew; they contact the folks at Drew's company; and everything else they can think of (which eventually includes a web site and radio interviews).  Brian even goes so far as to hire a Drew look-alike for a practice date to build up his confidence (it does the opposite, by the way, with the date critique supplying some of the funniest moments in the film).  All the while, Plan B consists of getting Brian in to meet Drew at the premiere of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.I had a ball watching this documentary.  Yes, it looks like an amateur documentary because that is what it is.  Eleven hundred bucks isn't going to buy you the best equipment and cameramen, you know.  I won't tell you how it all works out because it really is the journey that matters most.  One can criticize Brian for having a date with Drew rather than, say, world peace, as his biggest goal in life, but what matters is that he had the guts to go for it just as hard as he possibly could, risking embarrassment (and lots of it) and impending financial gloom and doom in the process.  No matter what our own goals are, how many of us can say the same?",5,"Unique, quirky, and very entertaining -- I loved it",1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,3435,"['loved', 'My', 'Date', 'Drew', 'Yes', 'documentary', 'very', 'funny', 'personable', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'inspirational', 'had', 'crushes', 'celebrities', 'youth', 'adults', 'still', 'do', 'dreamed', 'meeting', 'superstar', 'objects', 'affections', '27', 'Brian', 'Herzlinger', 'still', 'had', 'life-long', 'crush', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'When', 'won', 'eleven', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'game', 'show', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'winning', 'answer', 'fate', 'decided', 'use', 'money', 'pursue', 'dream', 'dream', 'date', 'Drew', 'Yes', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', 'unemployed', 'time', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'money', 'more', 'practical', 'things', 'bills', 'example', 'guy', 'had', 'dream', 'went', 'more', 'lot', 'can', 'say', 'Thanks', 'retailer', 'policy', 'letting', 'return', 'purchases', 'thirty', 'days', 'got', 'camera', 'assembled', 'friends', 'filmed', 'efforts', 'win', 'date', 'Drew', '30', 'days', 'possible', 'nobody', 'get', 'date', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'people', 'planet', 'odds', 'were', 'definitely', 'ups', 'downs', 'personal', 'quest', 'certainly', 'make', 'uniquely', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'one', 'most', 'can', 'identify', 'number', 'ways.Brian', 'was', 'nobody', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', 'nobody', 'well', 'example', 'aspiring', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'already', 'there', 'Hollywood', 'fluttering', 'fringes', 'business', 'knew', 'several', 'people', 'movie-related', 'jobs', 'range', 'connections', 'had', 'great', 'network', 'friends', 'who', 'supported', 'as', 'well', 'helped', 'technological', 'aspects', 'whole', 'documentary', 'was', 'making', 'experience', 'thought', 'Brian', 'was', 'quite', 'likeable', 'watching', 'bounce', 'back', 'forth', 'euphoria', 'resignation', 'events', 'unfolded', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'take', 'back', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'little', 'ways', 'not', 'auspicious', 'beginning', 'Brian', 'strangers', 'street', 'help', 'advice', 'crew', 'supporters', 'project', 'hand', 'full-court', 'press', 'effort', 'talk', 'people', 'business', 'as', 'well', 'folks', 'who', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'someone', 'who', 'Drew', 'land', 'interviews', 'writer', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Full', 'Throttle', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'others', 'who', 'actually', 'know', 'Drew', 'contact', 'folks', 'Drew', 'company', 'everything', 'else', 'can', 'think', 'eventually', 'web', 'site', 'radio', 'interviews', 'Brian', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'hire', 'Drew', 'look-alike', 'practice', 'date', 'build', 'up', 'confidence', 'opposite', 'way', 'date', 'critique', 'supplying', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'while', 'Plan', 'B', 'getting', 'Brian', 'meet', 'Drew', 'premiere', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Full', 'Throttle.I', 'had', 'ball', 'watching', 'documentary', 'Yes', 'amateur', 'documentary', 'what', 'Eleven', 'hundred', 'bucks', ""n't"", 'going', 'buy', 'best', 'equipment', 'cameramen', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'out', 'really', 'journey', 'most', 'One', 'can', 'criticize', 'Brian', 'having', 'date', 'Drew', 'rather', 'say', 'world', 'peace', 'biggest', 'goal', 'life', 'what', 'matters', 'had', 'guts', 'go', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'possibly', 'could', 'risking', 'embarrassment', 'lots', 'impending', 'financial', 'gloom', 'doom', 'process', 'matter', 'what', 'own', 'goals', 'are', 'how', 'many', 'can', 'say', 'same']",N/A

I narrowed it down to two documentaries: ""Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead"" and ""My Date With Drew"", having seen neither of the films before.  I DEFINITLEY made the right choice.  This movie was a breath of fresh air.  Brian Herzlinger is not a stalker, nor an obsessed fan - he is simply a guy going through a dry spell in life [unemployed, struggling financially] and rather than sitting around and being depressed while waiting for a new job/opportunity to come through, he decides to embark on a sweet and ambitious  project and films the journey.Armed with $1100, which he won on a game where the winning answer was - ironically - Drew Barrymore, Brian decides to see if he can meet his childhood crush and proceeds to work every connection available to him in persuit of this endeavor.  Fortunately for him, he seems to know a LOT more people in the film industry (albeit, on the periphery - mostly friends of friends or remote acquaintences) to get closer to Ms. Barrymore than the average person could to their favorite celeb.  He takes great pains to ensure that his approach does not make him come off as mentally unstable and clarify that he's not trying to form an actual romantic relationship with the star.  He doesn't sit ourside her house or try to get her phone number and leave tons of messages.  Instead, he contacts her production company and networks to get in touch with her and let her know about this project.Ultimately, whether or not someone will enjoy this film will depend almost entirely on whether they like it's lead character: no, not Drew Barrymore - Brian Herzlinger.  I for one found him absolutely adorable.  He reminds me of actor Scott Foley [""Noel"" from the tv series ""Felicity""].  He's a nice guy and by the end, you're really rooting for him to succeed.Even if you don't particularly care for Herzlinger, I think anyone who has gone through a lull or transition in their life/career can relate to this movie.  It's about finding hope, chasing a dream and being peristant when something seems impossible.It *does* drag a little in a couple parts [Brian spending $75 on a psychic to tell him if he'll succeed, his friends commenting on whether he should get his body hair waxed], but overall, two thumbs up!",4,A breath of fresh air,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,2330,"['Wide', 'awake', 'late', 'last', 'night', 'decided', 'flip', 'open', 'lap', 'top', 'movie', 'narrowed', 'down', 'two', 'documentaries', 'Fat', 'Sick', 'Nearly', 'Dead', 'Date', 'Drew', 'having', 'seen', 'films', 'DEFINITLEY', 'made', 'right', 'choice', 'movie', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'Brian', 'Herzlinger', 'not', 'stalker', 'obsessed', 'fan', 'simply', 'guy', 'going', 'dry', 'spell', 'life', '[', 'unemployed', 'struggling', 'financially', ']', 'rather', 'sitting', 'around', 'being', 'depressed', 'waiting', 'new', 'job/opportunity', 'come', 'embark', 'sweet', 'ambitious', 'project', 'films', 'journey.Armed', '1100', 'won', 'game', 'where', 'winning', 'answer', 'was', 'ironically', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Brian', 'see', 'can', 'meet', 'childhood', 'crush', 'proceeds', 'work', 'connection', 'available', 'persuit', 'endeavor', 'Fortunately', 'know', 'LOT', 'more', 'people', 'film', 'industry', 'albeit', 'periphery', 'mostly', 'friends', 'remote', 'acquaintences', 'get', 'closer', 'Ms.', 'Barrymore', 'average', 'person', 'could', 'favorite', 'celeb', 'great', 'pains', 'ensure', 'approach', 'not', 'make', 'come', 'off', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'clarify', 'not', 'trying', 'form', 'actual', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'star', ""n't"", 'sit', 'house', 'try', 'get', 'phone', 'number', 'leave', 'tons', 'messages', 'Instead', 'production', 'company', 'networks', 'get', 'touch', 'let', 'know', 'project.Ultimately', 'not', 'someone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'almost', 'entirely', 'like', 'lead', 'character', 'not', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Brian', 'Herzlinger', 'one', 'found', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'actor', 'Scott', 'Foley', '[', 'Noel', 'tv', 'series', 'Felicity', ']', 'nice', 'guy', 'end', ""'re"", 'really', 'rooting', 'succeed.Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'Herzlinger', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'gone', 'lull', 'transition', 'life/career', 'can', 'relate', 'movie', 'finding', 'hope', 'chasing', 'dream', 'being', 'peristant', 'when', 'something', 'impossible.It', '*does*', 'little', 'couple', 'parts', '[', 'Brian', 'spending', '75', 'psychic', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'succeed', 'friends', 'commenting', 'should', 'get', 'body', 'hair', 'waxed', ']', 'overall', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up']",N/A
942149,A2I38KW4JRUM1F,B000BHZ2B4,FLAtRich,"[1, 2]","First time director Brian Herzlinger fell for Drew Barrymore like the rest of us with one notable difference: Brian was a little kid at the time, like Drew, and his kid crush lingered.If the backstory to My Date With Drew is true, grown up Brian Herzlinger won a grand as a game show contestant and got a grand idea as well. He used his grand for a 30-day refundable down payment on a camera that he couldn't afford and started filming a quest to meet his childhood love and ask her on a date.The fact that Brian Herzlinger was just a guy from New Jersey and Drew Barrymore was a famous actress from one of the most famous families of actors and actresses on the planet slowed him down at first. When you are America's Sweetheart you can't make yourself too accessible and Ms. Barrymore wisely keeps a degree of separation between herself and most of the rest of us, no matter how much we love her.Here's where Brian Herzlinger's grand idea flares into a supernova as the documentary shifts to explore the degrees of separation between the young filmmaker and his muse.

It makes for a good story and it makes those Ordinary Joes at home feel downright okay with our normalcy. ""My Date with Drew"" is a perfect study at how being ordinary and working as hard as you can, can pay off with dream dividends fully reached. The movie is a documentary about one guy who decides after winning $1100 on a pilot show for a game show called ""Taboo"", that he will hunt down the lovely actress Drew Barrymore to gain one date with her. His life and status of ordinariness puts huge restrictions on him-his budget is the money he won (ironically because the winning answer was the esteemed actress herself) so only a bit more than a grand and 30 days (that's how long he has before the return policy on the video camera he got from Circuit City lasts). The guy is a likable sort who is an aspiring filmmaker in Hollywood that reminds one of the dude who ate McDonalds for thirty days in ""Supersize Me"". The film follows him in his pursuit of Drew and is hilarious with the six degrees of separation in full regal-something that aspiring actors and movie industry wannabes go through on a daily basis (I know so-and-so whose brother house sat for the massage therapist that knows this guy).

942153,A3G98NEA8A9K8H,B000BHZ2B4,J. Stoneking,"[4, 12]","I've been on a documentary kick lately. For example, Super Size Me was not only informative, but entertaining. It's a documentary I decided to buy, and would watch again. Maybe not often, but I would watch it again from time to time. A good documentary doesn't have to be entertaining, but it helps, but it should be informative.  I want to walk away from it learing something, anything, either about the people involved, or the subject matter they were covering.My Date With Drew? Well, the best thing I can say about it is I had an opportunity to see it for free. As documentaries go, this is pretty weak. It fails on so many levels, and the main focus of this movie is not entertaining enough to justify watching for an hour and a half, and like other reviews have pointed out, you'd have to turn your brain off to not realize how this ends.In this day and age of desk top creativity, it seems that anybody with an iota of an idea can make a movie. Get a digital camera, point and record. What else do you need? Well, Mr. Herzlinger, you should have some talent and at least a greater purpose. And this is the fault of today's media: it is making stars out of people who really don't deserve it. They lack the talent, and they really haven't gone through the proper channels to get where they are.If you like ""reality TV"" and those types of date shows, this might be for you, but neither of those interest me too much. And if those interest you, I'd still recommend it as a rental. Would you really want to own it? Does this material warrant repeated viewings?And, yes, he does come off as a stalker. I found myself thinking of other stalkers in the past who tried to get close to stars due to some obsession they have, and this was just frightening. The only thing separating Mr. Herzlinger and somebody who would get a restraining order against them is Mr. Herzlinger had a camera and some extra cash to document what he was doing, and could edit the material in a way to make it look like he's got some greater purpose. There is no great purpose behind this movie. It's a total waste.So why the two star rating, you ask? Well, you could rent worse things. I'd rather watch this movie than the latest crap fest pop corn movie out on DVD this week. It's not BAD. The pacing does keep up, and I never really found it too boring. It is ultimately interesting how he achieves his goal, but those things warrant a rental recommendation from me only. And that's if you got a free rental coming or really have nothing else to watch.The only disappointment for me in the whole package is I would love to know how this loser went from getting this rough footage on a digital camera (and who filmed the footage of him with Drew?? He only got a ticket for himself to New York, AFAIK, not his crew) to getting an exclusive deal with Blockbuster Video and getting this movie played across the world. That to me would have been a far more interesting tale, and perhaps somebody should have documented those steps and put them on the bonus DVD. Did this guy find focus in his life after he got his dream date? Does he plan on becoming a serious movie maker now, and used this as a stepping stone? In some ways, the ending is such a let down, because you expected him to get his date. What you really want to know does Mr. Herzlinger get around to getting some focus in his life after he got that silly goal out of his system?  And so all I really learned in this movie is that he gets his date, but that was the no brainer.  It leaves the subject matter empty and void.  I knew that going in, and thus the documentary really didn't provide me with any substantial information I didn't know going in.",2,Rent it,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,3689,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'documentary', 'kick', 'lately', 'example', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'decided', 'buy', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'Maybe', 'not', 'often', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'time', 'time', 'good', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'entertaining', 'should', 'be', 'informative', 'want', 'walk', 'away', 'learing', 'something', 'anything', 'people', 'involved', 'subject', 'matter', 'were', 'covering.My', 'Date', 'Drew', 'Well', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'free', 'documentaries', 'go', 'pretty', 'weak', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'not', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'justify', 'watching', 'hour', 'half', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', ""'d"", 'have', 'turn', 'brain', 'not', 'realize', 'how', 'day', 'age', 'desk', 'top', 'creativity', 'anybody', 'iota', 'idea', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'Get', 'digital', 'camera', 'point', 'record', 'What', 'else', 'do', 'need', 'Well', 'Mr.', 'Herzlinger', 'should', 'have', 'talent', 'least', 'greater', 'purpose', 'fault', 'today', 'media', 'making', 'stars', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'lack', 'talent', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'gone', 'proper', 'channels', 'get', 'where', 'are.If', 'reality', 'TV', 'types', 'date', 'shows', 'might', 'be', 'interest', 'too', 'much', 'interest', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'rental', 'Would', 'really', 'want', 'own', 'material', 'warrant', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'yes', 'come', 'off', 'stalker', 'found', 'thinking', 'other', 'stalkers', 'past', 'who', 'tried', 'get', 'close', 'stars', 'due', 'obsession', 'have', 'was', 'just', 'frightening', 'only', 'thing', 'separating', 'Mr.', 'Herzlinger', 'somebody', 'who', 'would', 'get', 'restraining', 'order', 'Mr.', 'Herzlinger', 'had', 'camera', 'extra', 'cash', 'document', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'could', 'edit', 'material', 'way', 'make', 'look', 'got', 'greater', 'purpose', 'great', 'purpose', 'movie', 'total', 'waste.So', 'why', 'two', 'star', 'rating', 'ask', 'Well', 'could', 'rent', 'worse', 'things', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'movie', 'latest', 'crap', 'fest', 'pop', 'corn', 'movie', 'DVD', 'week', 'not', 'BAD', 'pacing', 'keep', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'too', 'boring', 'ultimately', 'interesting', 'how', 'goal', 'things', 'warrant', 'rental', 'recommendation', 'only', 'got', 'free', 'rental', 'coming', 'really', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch.The', 'only', 'disappointment', 'whole', 'package', 'would', 'love', 'know', 'how', 'loser', 'went', 'getting', 'rough', 'footage', 'digital', 'camera', 'who', 'filmed', 'footage', 'Drew', 'only', 'got', 'ticket', 'New', 'York', 'AFAIK', 'not', 'crew', 'getting', 'exclusive', 'deal', 'Blockbuster', 'Video', 'getting', 'movie', 'played', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'tale', 'perhaps', 'somebody', 'should', 'have', 'documented', 'steps', 'put', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Did', 'guy', 'find', 'focus', 'life', 'got', 'dream', 'date', 'plan', 'becoming', 'serious', 'movie', 'maker', 'now', 'used', 'stepping', 'stone', 'ways', 'ending', 'such', 'let', 'down', 'expected', 'get', 'date', 'What', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'Mr.', 'Herzlinger', 'get', 'getting', 'focus', 'life', 'got', 'silly', 'goal', 'system', 'all', 'really', 'learned', 'movie', 'date', 'was', 'brainer', 'subject', 'matter', 'empty', 'void', 'knew', 'going', 'thus', 'documentary', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'substantial', 'information', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'going']",N/A

942160,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BHZ2B4,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Well, the title of the film tells you all. `My Date with Drew' is about Brian Herzlinger who wants to have a date with Drew Barrymore, star of `ET' and `Charlie's Angels.' Can he? But wait, who is this Brian Herzlinger? And why should we care?Brian Herzliner is an aspiring filmmaker from New Jersey, an ordinary American guy who suddenly decided to `take a risk' in life and get a date with Drew Barrymore he adores since his childhood. With $1,100 he won in the pilot of a quiz show and a help from his friends Brian tries to have a date with Drew Barrymore within 30 days.But you might ask -- why should we care? Right, Brian is a pretty funny person, but that is not enough for anyone to make a feature film. Still I find `My Date with Drew' interesting because the film shows what people should do (or should not to do) to make it in show business, or perhaps any other business. You can get a cell phone number of a celebrity's limo driver pretty easily; you can meet a beautician who knows Hollywood stars, or even screenwriters if you're lucky, but that does not necessarily mean that you can attain your goal. You need a right time and right place. The phrase may sound clich&eacute;d, but it is true as far as this documentary goes.For fans of charming Drew Barrymore, my advice is this: You should watch it. Skip the part of Brian's ""self-improvement,"" his fortune teller episode or a mock date with Drew's look-alike. But the film is worth your viewing because of its concluding part.`My Date with Drew' is pretty funny, entertaining film by a person who knows how to entertain viewers. Not that what Brian Herzlinger does is all recommendable. I don't use the word `stalking,' but surely not everything he does is morally desirable. The film is based on one clever idea that no one is likely to repeat now, and the cleverness includes the choice of the star (`My Date with Julia"" or ""My Date with Cameron"" sounds impossible, bringing the whole premise to the fictional world of `Notting Hill').
