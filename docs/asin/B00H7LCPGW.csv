1684384,A13ICM9ZYL3A2M,B00H7LCPGW,"DFW Mike C ""Mike C, DFW, Texas""","[5, 6]","I was delighted when I learned The Rifleman series was finally going to be made available in its entirety 55 years after it first aired.  As a young man growing up in the 50s (and not necessarily a Western fan back then), I anxiously anticipated each weekly episode.  While I enjoyed the action and adventure of the old West, I was even more impressed with the historical bent of the life of a rancher trying to make a life for himself and his son in the 1870s in New Mexico.  In Lucas McCain, this program also gave young viewers a role model and strong values to strive for and incorporate in our own lives.  Some would tend to focus on the &#34;violence&#34; in some of the episodes, but that is definitely not the gist of The Rifleman.  Thematically, this TV series is about a father-son relationship and the values the father instills in his son.  In every episode, Lucas always uses reason, logic, intelligence, negotiation, and compromise in an attempt to solve his own problems or the problems that present themselves in North Folk.  Lucas only uses force when it is absolutely necessary to defend his home, his family, his friends, or the town of North Folk.  Lucas lives responsibly and always hopes to make things better in his community; he is a peaceable man and a wise man and defends what is right and just when necessary.  It sent a great message to those of us who were young at the time.Another reason I am delighted to see this series is its value to the annals of television history.  After so many years, it can definitely be considered a classic and therefore should be preserved for future generations.  This can truly be said to be part of the Golden Age of Television with its strong writing, powerful acting (Chuck Connors, Johnny Crawford, Paul Fix), emphatic background music (Herschel Gilbert), and excellent camera work.  Good writing, good stories, and good TV series, as with things artistic, withstand the test of time.  This series does that.I was impressed with the superb dvd quality; those who worked on the original film and the digital remastering did a fine job.  All episodes were crisp and clear.  I had no problem with play or menus on any of the eight dvds.I don't have a problem with the pricing (currently $69.95) because I consider it a terrific value for the 40 episodes in Season 1 - this is only $1.75 per episode. Some people pay more than that for their monthly cellphone bills.  As with all things in the market place, if this is too pricey for your wallet, then you may want to wait until the price is more suitable to your taste.  As for me, The Rifleman Season 1, is worth every penny; but then, I'm an avid fan and am willing to pay what I consider a reasonable price for such a precious commodity.As with all other Rifleman fans, I am enthused that Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions was finally able, after much hard work, to get this first season out to us.  And I look forward with keen anticipation to the release of the other seasons and adding them to the &#34;must-haves&#34; in my collection.  I highly recommend the Official Season 1 of The Rifleman to all dedicated fans.",5,The Rifleman -  One of the Best in the Golden Age of Television,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,3135,"['was', 'delighted', 'when', 'learned', 'Rifleman', 'series', 'was', 'finally', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'entirety', '55', 'years', 'first', 'aired', 'young', 'man', 'growing', 'up', '50s', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Western', 'fan', 'back', 'then', 'anxiously', 'anticipated', 'weekly', 'episode', 'enjoyed', 'action', 'adventure', 'old', 'West', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'historical', 'bent', 'life', 'rancher', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'son', '1870s', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Lucas', 'McCain', 'program', 'also', 'gave', 'young', 'viewers', 'role', 'model', 'strong', 'values', 'strive', 'incorporate', 'own', 'lives', 'would', 'tend', 'focus', '34', 'violence', '34', 'episodes', 'definitely', 'not', 'gist', 'Rifleman', 'Thematically', 'TV', 'series', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'values', 'father', 'instills', 'son', 'episode', 'Lucas', 'always', 'reason', 'logic', 'intelligence', 'negotiation', 'compromise', 'attempt', 'solve', 'own', 'problems', 'problems', 'present', 'North', 'Folk', 'Lucas', 'only', 'force', 'when', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'defend', 'home', 'family', 'friends', 'town', 'North', 'Folk', 'Lucas', 'responsibly', 'always', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'community', 'peaceable', 'man', 'wise', 'man', 'what', 'right', 'just', 'when', 'necessary', 'sent', 'great', 'message', 'who', 'were', 'young', 'time.Another', 'reason', 'am', 'delighted', 'see', 'series', 'value', 'annals', 'television', 'history', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'can', 'definitely', 'be', 'considered', 'classic', 'therefore', 'should', 'be', 'preserved', 'future', 'generations', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'part', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Television', 'strong', 'writing', 'powerful', 'acting', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Johnny', 'Crawford', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'emphatic', 'background', 'music', 'Herschel', 'Gilbert', 'excellent', 'camera', 'work', 'Good', 'writing', 'good', 'stories', 'good', 'TV', 'series', 'things', 'artistic', 'withstand', 'test', 'time', 'series', 'that.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'superb', 'dvd', 'quality', 'who', 'worked', 'original', 'film', 'digital', 'remastering', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'episodes', 'were', 'crisp', 'clear', 'had', 'problem', 'play', 'menus', 'eight', 'dvds.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'pricing', 'currently', '69.95', 'consider', 'terrific', 'value', '40', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'only', '1.75', 'episode', 'people', 'pay', 'more', 'monthly', 'cellphone', 'bills', 'things', 'market', 'place', 'too', 'pricey', 'wallet', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'price', 'more', 'suitable', 'taste', 'Rifleman', 'Season', '1', 'worth', 'penny', 'then', ""'m"", 'avid', 'fan', 'am', 'willing', 'pay', 'what', 'consider', 'reasonable', 'price', 'such', 'precious', 'commodity.As', 'other', 'Rifleman', 'fans', 'am', 'enthused', 'Levy-Gardner-Laven', 'Productions', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'much', 'hard', 'work', 'get', 'first', 'season', 'look', 'forward', 'keen', 'anticipation', 'release', 'other', 'seasons', 'adding', '34', 'must-haves', '34', 'collection', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Official', 'Season', '1', 'Rifleman', 'dedicated', 'fans']",The Rifleman Official Season 1 (Episodes 1 - 40)

1684387,AAQMDSR9B2EDR,B00H7LCPGW,Midwest Reviewer,"[23, 24]","I bought my set from The Rifleman official website before it became available on amazon. The release was delayed for nearly a year and when the website announced the purchase price, I was shocked and thought, no way will I pay that amount for one season. I already had the MPI multi-disc sets.However, then I considered that there are 40 episodes on this set (the MPI sets had 20 episodes), it is the entire first season in the original running order, and these are on 8 one-sided discs.  If it had been marketed as individual discs each with 5 episodes on them, I'm sure the one-disc list price would have been $9.99-$14.99.  I therefore bit my lip and decided to buy it and decided if I didn't like it, wouldn't consider buying the second season when it is released (which considering how slow the production company was getting this out, could be another year).I'm glad I bought it.  The DVDs are clearly labeled identifying 5 shows on each disc, plus have different photographs on each.  The multi-fold packaging provides easy access to the discs and is secure.  There is an interesting program guide included, describing each episode, original air date, plot synopsis and the cast in that episode.I didn't expect pristine video quality and certainly not High Definition, but for 1950s-era black and white television broadcasts, the quality is quite good. The pilot episode from Zane Grey Theatre which is presented first is grainy and ragged.  The quality is better after the pilot, and really good after the first 7 or 8 earliest episodes.  Considering the age of these films and what I've seen before I think the clarity is improved.  I believe the company did as much as they could to provide quality here. I've been a fan and follower of this show since it was first broadcast, and noticed a few things here I'd never seemed to notice before, which surprises me - for example, smoke coming from the rifle in the opening sequence.  How could I not have noticed or paid any attention to that for 50+ years?!  Also in the pilot episode, behind Lucas when he is talking, it appears in the distant background that the reflection from a motorized vehicle can be seen moving from left to right along a roadway.  I also see a little more clarity revealing false backgrounds in a few scenes which I'd never noticed before.  Overall, I think the picture clarity is an improvement.Finally, seeing the episodes in their original running order instead of pulled from different years on the same discs is revealing, watching the development of the characters and the comfort level of the actors working with one another.  Johnny Crawford was a good rider at a  young age, and an extremely good actor.  He has a sincerity and genuineness some other child actors of that era didn't have (for example, Jay North, who could play the part but wasn't so convincing and looked more like acting; he suffered from a lot of personal maneuvering and mistreatment behind the scenes). Chuck Connors is likewise a great western actor, and heroic not because of the violence resolving conflicts with the rifle each episode, but for his love, caring and affection for his son, and level-headed strong sense of justice and fairness. In fact the focus of the episodes isn't on the rifle, it's the relationship between the father and son. It's obvious that Chuck Connors and Johnny Crawford worked so well together as they obviously liked each other very much.This series had a lot going for it at the time of its original broadcast, and I have never tired of it or seeing the same episodes time and again.  If you are a long-term fan, despite the cost of this DVD set, I think you will appreciate the episodes even if they are not in high definition.",5,Very glad to have this set,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,3727,"['bought', 'set', 'Rifleman', 'official', 'website', 'became', 'available', 'amazon', 'release', 'was', 'delayed', 'nearly', 'year', 'when', 'website', 'announced', 'purchase', 'price', 'was', 'shocked', 'thought', 'way', 'will', 'pay', 'amount', 'one', 'season', 'already', 'had', 'MPI', 'multi-disc', 'sets.However', 'then', 'considered', 'are', '40', 'episodes', 'set', 'MPI', 'sets', 'had', '20', 'episodes', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'original', 'running', 'order', 'are', '8', 'one-sided', 'discs', 'had', 'been', 'marketed', 'individual', 'discs', '5', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'one-disc', 'list', 'price', 'would', 'have', 'been', '9.99-', '14.99', 'therefore', 'bit', 'lip', 'decided', 'buy', 'decided', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'buying', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'released', 'considering', 'how', 'slow', 'production', 'company', 'was', 'getting', 'out', 'could', 'be', 'year', '.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'are', 'clearly', 'labeled', 'identifying', '5', 'shows', 'disc', 'have', 'different', 'photographs', 'multi-fold', 'packaging', 'easy', 'access', 'discs', 'secure', 'interesting', 'program', 'guide', 'included', 'describing', 'episode', 'original', 'air', 'date', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'cast', 'episode.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'pristine', 'video', 'quality', 'certainly', 'not', 'High', 'Definition', '1950s-era', 'black', 'white', 'television', 'broadcasts', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Zane', 'Grey', 'Theatre', 'presented', 'first', 'grainy', 'ragged', 'quality', 'better', 'pilot', 'really', 'good', 'first', '7', '8', 'earliest', 'episodes', 'Considering', 'age', 'films', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'think', 'clarity', 'improved', 'believe', 'company', 'did', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'provide', 'quality', 'here', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'follower', 'show', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'noticed', 'few', 'things', 'here', ""'d"", 'never', 'seemed', 'notice', 'example', 'smoke', 'coming', 'rifle', 'opening', 'sequence', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'noticed', 'paid', 'attention', '50+', 'years', 'Also', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Lucas', 'when', 'talking', 'distant', 'background', 'reflection', 'motorized', 'vehicle', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'moving', 'left', 'right', 'along', 'roadway', 'also', 'see', 'little', 'more', 'clarity', 'revealing', 'false', 'backgrounds', 'few', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'never', 'noticed', 'Overall', 'think', 'picture', 'clarity', 'improvement.Finally', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'original', 'running', 'order', 'instead', 'pulled', 'different', 'years', 'same', 'discs', 'revealing', 'watching', 'development', 'characters', 'comfort', 'level', 'actors', 'working', 'one', 'Johnny', 'Crawford', 'was', 'good', 'rider', 'young', 'age', 'extremely', 'good', 'actor', 'sincerity', 'genuineness', 'other', 'child', 'actors', 'era', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'example', 'Jay', 'North', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'convincing', 'looked', 'more', 'acting', 'suffered', 'lot', 'personal', 'maneuvering', 'mistreatment', 'scenes', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'likewise', 'great', 'western', 'actor', 'heroic', 'not', 'violence', 'resolving', 'conflicts', 'rifle', 'episode', 'love', 'caring', 'affection', 'son', 'level-headed', 'strong', 'sense', 'justice', 'fairness', 'fact', 'focus', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'rifle', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'obvious', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Johnny', 'Crawford', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'obviously', 'liked', 'other', 'very', 'much.This', 'series', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'time', 'original', 'broadcast', 'have', 'never', 'tired', 'seeing', 'same', 'episodes', 'time', 'again', 'are', 'long-term', 'fan', 'cost', 'DVD', 'set', 'think', 'will', 'appreciate', 'episodes', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'high', 'definition']",The Rifleman Official Season 1 (Episodes 1 - 40)
1684388,A3E3HHHYYX4AMS,B00H7LCPGW,Mike,"[5, 6]","This is one of the best western series made.Chuck Connors, a former baseball player with the Dodgers, plays Lucas McCain the Rifleman of the title. A rancher bringing up his young son, played by Johnny Crawford, alone in the old west.Plenty of action-packed episodes with guest stars like Robert Vaughn, Dennis Hopper,Leif Erickson,Dan Blocker and Michael Landon, before they both became famous on another great western series &#34;Bonanza&#34;.Connors is called the rifleman because he only uses a rifle not a six-shooter like everybody else in the west.He is a renowned sharpshooter.Trying to live a peaceful life as a rancher trouble always seems to come their way not least because his best friend is the Marshal of North Fork played by Paul Fix who was the first Doctor on &#34; Star Trek&#34; before Dr McCoy.He appeared in only one episode and then was replaced.Here he always has Connors as his backup.Also he only has use of one arm as the other was injured in a gunfight earlier in is life.In other reviews I have read there was a problem with the disc's and the picture was bad or would stick.Only a few had no problem.I took the chance and bought this show anyway in the hopes I would get a good copy .Thank goodness,I did.Don't know why others had problems.I only have a ordinary DVD player not a Blu-ray even though they say that this is compatible with normal DVD's.Since I mostly watch shows from the 50's, 60's and 70's I see no need to upgrade.My only advice is that if you want this show  buy it in the hopes that, like me, it will work.If not return the DVD and wait for the problem to be resolved by the company and see how future seasons reviews are or wait until after they release all the seasons and then they might decide to release a boxed-set of the entire series.Bonus features are the pilot of the show which aired on &#34;Zane Grey Theatre hosted by Dick Powell not seen here.The pilot is not remastered which is stated on the DVD.Chuck Connors introduces some of the episodes.Also an interview with Arthur Gardner,one of the producers of the show and a photo gallery of publicity shots and behind the scenes as well.",5,Number One with a Bullet,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,2148,"['one', 'best', 'western', 'series', 'made.Chuck', 'Connors', 'former', 'baseball', 'player', 'Dodgers', 'Lucas', 'McCain', 'Rifleman', 'title', 'rancher', 'bringing', 'up', 'young', 'son', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Crawford', 'alone', 'old', 'west.Plenty', 'action-packed', 'episodes', 'guest', 'stars', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Leif', 'Erickson', 'Dan', 'Blocker', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'became', 'famous', 'great', 'western', 'series', '34', 'Bonanza', '34', '.Connors', 'called', 'rifleman', 'only', 'rifle', 'not', 'six-shooter', 'everybody', 'else', 'west.He', 'renowned', 'sharpshooter.Trying', 'live', 'peaceful', 'life', 'rancher', 'trouble', 'always', 'come', 'way', 'not', 'least', 'best', 'friend', 'Marshal', 'North', 'Fork', 'played', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'Doctor', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', '34', 'Dr', 'McCoy.He', 'appeared', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'then', 'was', 'replaced.Here', 'always', 'Connors', 'backup.Also', 'only', 'use', 'one', 'arm', 'other', 'was', 'injured', 'gunfight', 'earlier', 'life.In', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'was', 'problem', 'disc', 'picture', 'was', 'bad', 'would', 'stick.Only', 'few', 'had', 'problem.I', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'show', 'anyway', 'hopes', 'would', 'get', 'good', 'copy', '.Thank', 'goodness', 'did.Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'others', 'had', 'problems.I', 'only', 'have', 'ordinary', 'DVD', 'player', 'not', 'Blu-ray', 'even', 'say', 'compatible', 'normal', ""DVD's.Since"", 'mostly', 'watch', 'shows', '50', '60', '70', 'see', 'need', 'upgrade.My', 'only', 'advice', 'want', 'show', 'buy', 'hopes', 'will', 'work.If', 'not', 'return', 'DVD', 'wait', 'problem', 'be', 'resolved', 'company', 'see', 'how', 'future', 'seasons', 'reviews', 'are', 'wait', 'release', 'seasons', 'then', 'might', 'decide', 'release', 'boxed-set', 'entire', 'series.Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'pilot', 'show', 'aired', '34', 'Zane', 'Grey', 'Theatre', 'hosted', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'not', 'seen', 'here.The', 'pilot', 'not', 'remastered', 'stated', 'DVD.Chuck', 'Connors', 'episodes.Also', 'interview', 'Arthur', 'Gardner', 'one', 'producers', 'show', 'photo', 'gallery', 'publicity', 'shots', 'scenes', 'as', 'well']",The Rifleman Official Season 1 (Episodes 1 - 40)

1684390,A1KD0VWHR8GCPH,B00H7LCPGW,"ntaguchi ""ntaguchi""","[7, 8]","Unfortunately my experience with The Rifleman season 1 eight-disc set has not been good.  Two of the eight discs will not playback reliably and will display on the screen of my TV ""Can not read this disc"" most of the time on disc #3 and #7.  And yes I viewed some of my 100+ DVD collection and rental DVDs before and after the noted issues with this set.  Returned to the set numerous times and the same issues persist.  No damage of the gatefold packaging or any viewable physical damage on any of the discs.Image quality was fine/good and menu and options such as individual episode play or serial play were nice touches.  The number of chapter stops, I feel, were lacking, beginning and ending themes do not have their own chapter stops making for the need to fast forward.  I believe most would not want to repeatedly keep viewing and listening to the start and end themes after some point in time.My DVD player is a Sony DVP-7700 that uses dual lasers and the TV is a Sony KV27XBR96S.  Older models to be sure and still working fine, NTSC standard non high definition.On the plus side the gatefold package has nice illustrations and the each disc has different illustrations along with the title of each episode on the disc.  The hubs hold the discs with the right amount of tension keeping disc flex minimal.  Some discs overlap another disc making for some inconvenience.My suggestion is to put effort into viewing a set ASAP so as to be well within the window of return.  This is the second DVD set I've encountered with serious playback issues.  The other set that was problematic was the entire series of the Outer Limits that was returned promptly.My largest DVD set to date is the complete original Twilight Zone episodes at twenty-eight discs.  No issues at all with the discs while the disc holding hubs do not release the discs easily, the discs tend to flex during removal from gatefold packaging.  Not a deal breaker but a pain non the less.  At least there is no disc overlap.I might be wrong but feel it should be voiced.

1684392,A192N4CVUU4K3L,B00H7LCPGW,Randy S. Roth,"[46, 48]","The Rifleman is one of my favorite TV shows of all time!  However, when I popped the first disc into my machine, I noticed a lot of horizontal banding.  These thin, combing lines make things like hat brims look jagged and distort any details like faces - especially when the faces are talking, moving, or at a distance from the camera.  Thinking I had a bad disc, I put the others into the player - and saw the same thing.  I played them in another player, and got the same result.  The banding occurs only occasionally in some of the shows, and is worse in others, but it is there - and is distracting when it pops up.  Dennis Hopper hardly looked like Dennis Hopper at times!  I own the old MPI edition of the series, and all of those episodes do look a LOT cleaner than those in this new release.  Perhaps the positive reviews on video quality were from folks who had only seen bootlegged DVDs - I really don't know.  Even so, the series is still great!  I only hope the episodes in the following seasons get cleaned up to look better!  I really feel badly about deducting stars solely due to picture quality, because the writing and acting are fantastic!  These stories shouldn't be missed!Update 14 Jan:  I returned my set, hoping the thin banding in the picture was a one-time fluke in the CDs.  Today I received the replacement set, and the combing lines are still in there, no matter what player is used.  Evidently, this must be an overall production flaw.  Amazon did an excellent job in the speed with which they sent out my re-order for replacement!  It was also unbelievable how quickly they refunded the cost of the first set, its original shipping cost and other fees!

1684395,A4A652FQLPVR0,B00H7LCPGW,"Victor Hugo ""Film Buff""","[2, 31]","I watched the rifleman when I was young and loved it. I had my own rifle (daisy air rifle) as a boy and shot hundreds and hundreds of bad guys in my imagination playing in my backyard with friends. As an adult now and rewatching the series after 30 years, I am stunned by just how violent this ""classic"" TV series was. It didn't register on me as a boy, but it does as a man. Seemingly every 30 minute episode Lucas McCain guns down one, two, three or more people without so much as batting an eye. And the law (Marshall Micha) simply lets him do so without so much as a question. What lessons are being taught here? If you don't like someone? Shoot em'. Don't like the way they look at you? Shoot em'. Don't agree with something someone says? Shoot em'. I don't know what the actual body count was for this series. How many people did Lucas McCain shoot and kill during its run? Based on the 20 or so episodes I've rewatched, I'm guessing there had to be well over a hundred easily. And all without the law bothering him or spending a single night in jail. I'm not suggesting that watching this show will turn anyone in to a killer. However I don't like the lesson it teaches that guns solve problems or that the person with the biggest or fastest gun makes the rules and decides who else lives or dies while the law turns a blind eye. In retrospect, I wouldn't let my children watch it and when I compare it with Bonanza, I'm strained to try to think of any time that Ben, Hoss and Little Joe shot anyone. I think I'll show that to them instead.",1,Time's Have Changed,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,1547,"['watched', 'rifleman', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'loved', 'had', 'own', 'rifle', 'daisy', 'air', 'rifle', 'boy', 'shot', 'hundreds', 'hundreds', 'bad', 'guys', 'imagination', 'playing', 'backyard', 'friends', 'adult', 'now', 'rewatching', 'series', '30', 'years', 'am', 'stunned', 'just', 'how', 'violent', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'register', 'boy', 'man', 'Seemingly', '30', 'minute', 'episode', 'Lucas', 'McCain', 'guns', 'down', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'more', 'people', 'so', 'much', 'batting', 'eye', 'law', 'Marshall', 'Micha', 'simply', 'do', 'so', 'so', 'much', 'question', 'What', 'lessons', 'are', 'being', 'taught', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'someone', 'Shoot', 'em', 'Do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'look', 'Shoot', 'em', 'Do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'something', 'someone', 'Shoot', 'em', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'actual', 'body', 'count', 'was', 'series', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'Lucas', 'McCain', 'shoot', 'kill', 'run', 'Based', '20', 'so', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'rewatched', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'there', 'had', 'be', 'well', 'hundred', 'easily', 'law', 'bothering', 'spending', 'single', 'night', 'jail', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'watching', 'show', 'will', 'turn', 'anyone', 'killer', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'lesson', 'guns', 'solve', 'problems', 'person', 'biggest', 'fastest', 'gun', 'rules', 'decides', 'who', 'else', 'dies', 'law', 'blind', 'eye', 'retrospect', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'children', 'watch', 'when', 'compare', 'Bonanza', ""'m"", 'strained', 'try', 'think', 'time', 'Ben', 'Hoss', 'Little', 'Joe', 'shot', 'anyone', 'think', ""'ll"", 'show', 'instead']",The Rifleman Official Season 1 (Episodes 1 - 40)
