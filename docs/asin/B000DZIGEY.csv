964049,A2DMEQZ2TTGZ34,B000DZIGEY,A. parry,"[2, 2]","This particular ""Little House on the Prairie"" mini series is nothing short of amazingly spectacular!!! This mini series will greatly appeal to those who already appreciate the book and television series, as well as persons who have never yet been familiarized with the story. This mini series illustrates a very vivid and detailed account of the early adventure and hardship encountered by the Ingalls family, prior to the ""Walnut Grove"" era. While this rendition offers an accurate portrayal of the early undertakings of the Ingalls family, this mini series truly stands upon its own merit, not needing to be harshly compared to either the books or previous long running TV series. Having mentioned that, I will say that the actresses chosen to play Laura and Mary offer strikingly familiar features and mannerisms to that of which most of us are already accustomed. The chosen cast for the remaining characters, including Charles, Caroline, and Mr. Edwards, could not have been better. Not only is the story offered to us in a grippingly realistic and detailed manner, but the overall production quality is on par with larger budget feature films. The filming locations, cinematography techniques, editing direction, wardrobe costumes, set props, etc, are all nothing short of perfection.Regarding the DVD set, . . . NICE!!! The discs are of high quality, and include very functional chapter menus. The total runtime is approximately four and a half hours in length. The DVD discs offer a pristine 16:9 format print transfer, with intensely dynamic contrast, vivid colors, and razor sharp clarity. When played using a nice upscaling player, and viewed on a decent quality HDTV, the picture display is genuinely ""HD-Like"". Overall, I would have to suggest, that the picture quality is a solid ""9.7"" out of 10, just ever so slightly shy of a truly high definition sourced image (such as Blu-Ray, or 1080P HD satellite/cable movie). I've not witnessed a ""DVD"" disc(s) with an image having this type of finite resolution clarity in quite some time. The soundtrack offered is just as brilliant as the picture image, with crystal clear dynamic audio, and without any concerns (plenty of volume range, also). JUST GREAT!!!This mini series plays out with swift pacing, extremely detailed story illustration, and modern style cinematography showing scenic images which are truly astounding. This DVD set will appeal to most persons who enjoy high quality entertainment production, not just fans of the ""Little House on the Prairie"" story arc. Definitely, more than worthy of your time!!!This ""Little House on the Prairie"" mini series happens to be virtually ""perfect"".TAKE CARE, . . .

964055,A1YLR9N1VTB7WA,B000DZIGEY,"Elliott ""I am a big bookworm, an avid reader ...","[0, 0]","I think they did really well with this new version of the classic story of Little House On The Prairie based off of the third book in the Little House series of books Little House On The Prairie. Little House has been my favorite book series,and tv series for ever since i was a kid,amd it still is. Little House captures all of the emotions,feelings,and way to treat your fellow man. I enjoy the tv series of Little House On The Prairie alot,and when i saw that they were coming out with a new version of Little House On The Prairie i didn't know if it would be as good as the tv series. I bought this watched it,and i loved it right away. It did capture the feeling of the pioneer life,the lands looked really good as prairie land,the indians were amazing,and looked like i was watching real indians. I think it really kept faithful to the feeling of the book,and the works of Laura Ingalls Wilder,and the feeling of how her life was.I also like the Pilot of the NBC Little House,which is based off the Little House On The Prairie book,but in this version they added more,and had more of the characters from the book. It was well shot,and it got the feeling on video of the prairie. I really think Kyla Chavarria was perfect as Laura and Laura to a t,and Danielle Chuchran was Mary to a T,and she looked like how i pictured Mary in my head when i read the books. I don't think the actors/actresses who played Pa,Ma,and Mr. Edwards were that good as them. I think Michael Landon,Karen Grassle,and Victor French were better. But i do think that Kyle and Melissa Gilbert are the same as Half-Pint they did  really good jobs playing her,and were really believeable as Laura. I also think that Danielle and Melissa Sue Anderson were both perfect as Mary,and both did wonderful jobs playing her. I give it five stars for capturing the pioneer time period on the prairie that Laura lived through,and that the actresses who played Laura and Mary were spot on perfect,and cute as them. So take it as one Little House fan to another,that this is worth seeing for all of us Little House and Laura Ingalls Wilder fans.",5,Little House On The Prairie is my favorite,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,2108,"['think', 'did', 'really', 'well', 'new', 'version', 'classic', 'story', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'based', 'third', 'book', 'Little', 'House', 'series', 'books', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'Little', 'House', 'been', 'favorite', 'book', 'series', 'tv', 'series', 'ever', 'i', 'was', 'kid', 'still', 'Little', 'House', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'way', 'treat', 'fellow', 'man', 'enjoy', 'tv', 'series', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'alot', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'were', 'coming', 'out', 'new', 'version', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'tv', 'series', 'bought', 'watched', 'i', 'loved', 'right', 'away', 'did', 'capture', 'feeling', 'pioneer', 'life', 'lands', 'looked', 'really', 'good', 'prairie', 'land', 'indians', 'were', 'amazing', 'looked', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'real', 'indians', 'think', 'really', 'kept', 'faithful', 'feeling', 'book', 'works', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'feeling', 'how', 'life', 'was.I', 'also', 'Pilot', 'NBC', 'Little', 'House', 'based', 'off', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'book', 'version', 'added', 'more', 'had', 'more', 'characters', 'book', 'was', 'well', 'shot', 'got', 'feeling', 'video', 'prairie', 'really', 'think', 'Kyla', 'Chavarria', 'was', 'perfect', 'Laura', 'Laura', 't', 'Danielle', 'Chuchran', 'was', 'Mary', 'T', 'looked', 'how', 'i', 'pictured', 'Mary', 'head', 'when', 'i', 'read', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actors/actresses', 'who', 'played', 'Pa', 'Ma', 'Mr.', 'Edwards', 'were', 'that', 'good', 'think', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Karen', 'Grassle', 'Victor', 'French', 'were', 'better', 'i', 'do', 'think', 'Kyle', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'are', 'same', 'Half-Pint', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'jobs', 'playing', 'were', 'really', 'believeable', 'Laura', 'also', 'think', 'Danielle', 'Melissa', 'Sue', 'Anderson', 'were', 'perfect', 'Mary', 'did', 'wonderful', 'jobs', 'playing', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'capturing', 'pioneer', 'time', 'period', 'prairie', 'Laura', 'lived', 'actresses', 'who', 'played', 'Laura', 'Mary', 'were', 'spot', 'perfect', 'cute', 'So', 'take', 'one', 'Little', 'House', 'fan', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Little', 'House', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'fans']",Little House On The Prairie

For the first time in many, many years you did ol' Walt justice!This is a fine example of how to do a period TV series correctly. If you are a fan of the original ""Little House"" series (and a very good series at that!), you will notice a distinct difference between this version and the Michael Landon version. This newer one is, from what I have read, very close to Mrs. Wilder's original stories. It's this version of ""Little House on the Prairie"" that you will find a very realistic account of pioneer life in the latter part of the 19th century,  accurately portraying what it was like to leave a comfortable setting with family and friends about, to traveling to begin life anew hundreds of miles away. Cut off from all they knew as well as having their nearest neighbors quite a distance away, the Ingalls family learn to survive on their wits and skills, coming across the local (angry) Indians, meeting a life-loving free spirit, as well as a rather curt couple from Scotland.Traveling by wagon was a trying experience, and this series shows that very well. Through cold weather, crossing a frozen river, rainstorms, the family made it after two months to their land in Kansas. You will find realistic portrayals of continued hardships and illnesses.The Indians are seen from three different angles: the Scott's hate the savages and want them all dead; The Ingalls' feel that all people - no matter what race - have good and bad in them, and that the Indians are NOT savages and should receive the respect deserved to all folks; and Mr. Edwards is somewhere in between. Not PC, but not far right, either. It also hints of the atrocities that the American government did to the Indians, and also shows that the government screwed the white folks as well.Except for Charles' extremely white teeth, all of the actors fit the time portrayed very well, including dirty and unkempt hair for the women, burly men who, you can just tell, smelled like they haven't showered in years, and even folks with foreign accents - something rarely seen in film versions of our earlier American history.Fear of the unknown, concern over food (or lack thereof), the sounds on the prairie at night, the solitude of pioneer life, the fact that one had to be of a tough stock to handle all that came, hopes and dreams - this version of Little House actually puts meat on the bones of not just the Ingalls family, but of all American Pioneers.I only wish the ratings were higher when originally shown on ABC TV back in 2005 so it could have been made into a weekly series.

While I loved the series with Michael Landon, it really wasn't true to the books, especially after Season 4. He invented characters that never existed in the Ingalls lives; also, the Ingalls family settled in Walnut Grove, MN for a few years. Their main place of residence was in De Smet, South Dakota. So yes, the original series used some of the actual names and some actual parts from the books, but it wasn't what the real Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote. Maybe the writers should have wrote ""loosely based on the books by Laura Ingalls Wilder.""However, Disney's version showed a more realistic, moving portrayal of what pioneer life and families were all about, how much they had to go through every day of their lives. It stayed true to the series, and to Laura Ingalls and her family. Who would have thought that a simple family would turn out to be one of the most celebrated American families in history?

Now I will.What did I like about this? Why will I read the books? Whereas the tv show was very shiny happy people, Waltonsy in its own way, this 6 hour (at least on tv) mini-series isn't. What I like about this is that in some ways, more than most other tv shows and movies, this shows the hardships of living through this era. Sure, the wolf scene is stupid, but it's also 2 minutes out of a 6 hour movie. Whereas the tv show was often the televised equivalent of a Hallmark card, this movie is not. Usually if you want to get a sense of the suffering, brutal conditions, weird politics and social interactions (ie. whites and Indians) you have to read a book. You can watch this movie and deeply respect them just for surviving, just as you can the... other side.That will be the line of demarcation for whether or not you like this movie, I suspect. If you want a new version of the tv show, or something that strictly follows the books (like I said, I don't know if this does) you may be disappointed. If you want more of a character study... a contextual study... the texture of their lives and a look into what it took to Go West by wagon (whether you agree with all their motivations, ideals and rationales or not), you'll like this.Also, strictly for entertainment value, I loved Mr. Edwards. This guy played the role so that Mr. Edwards was a really nice guy who just may have been a little touched in the head.With less feel-good schmaltz than the tv series, more of the American Truth comes through. The title of my review comes from one of the deepest scenes in the movie. You can feel the dominant, mainstream American consciousness  already in place. Based on the context of the question and who asks it, America's answer is (and remains) ""yes"".
