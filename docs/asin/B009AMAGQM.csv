However, she is terribly outshone by actor, Alden Ehrenreich, who plays love interest Ethan Wate.  Ehrenreich's charisma absolutely carries the film.  He is better or at least on par with the veteran actors, namely Emma Thompson, Jeremy Irons and Viola Davis.  Ethan has dreams of a dark-haired girl, and he is sees her in school.  He is overcome by Lena's quirkiness, and he seeks to protect her.  They get together, fall in love, and Ethan is engrossed in her world.  I loved the supernatural elements and special effects.  Particularly the clash between Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons.

It's like someone went and put too many commercials together and forgot what the underlying plot is supposed to be until the last moment. Ihave never read the book, so I'm not sure if the book is quite different or better written or what changes were done to convert it to film.I have heard a lot of people thinking that this is the next ""Twilight"" series, but having read the books but not having seen those movies, I can't really attest to whether ""Beautiful Creatures"" is better or worse.One thing that I can testify to is that there is one electrifying scene between Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson that's almost worth watching the entire film for. Emma Thompson gives a superb performance every second she is on screen, sadly, that's not often enough. Then again, her performance is so mesmerizing that had they given her more screen time, you'd have to make it all about her character (which seems a lot more interesting than the love story that's the central plot). Also, her calibre of acting is so much more superior that watching the other actors is too depressing. The only exception to that is Viola Davis' performance, particularly in one scene towards the end where she shows raw emotion that's quite touching.Overall, I'd recommend this film as a Redbox rental, and that's primarily for decent special effects and the aforementioned performance from Thompson.",3,Emma Thompson's performance puts everything else in the background,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,1481,"['saw', 'movie', 'screening', 'today', 'movie', 'mostly', 'fluff', 'cliches', 'lot', 'already', 'know', 'someone', 'went', 'put', 'too', 'many', 'commercials', 'together', 'forgot', 'what', 'underlying', 'plot', 'supposed', 'be', 'last', 'moment', 'Ihave', 'never', 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'book', 'quite', 'different', 'better', 'written', 'what', 'changes', 'were', 'done', 'convert', 'film.I', 'have', 'heard', 'lot', 'people', 'thinking', 'next', 'Twilight', 'series', 'having', 'read', 'books', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'attest', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'better', 'worse.One', 'thing', 'can', 'testify', 'one', 'electrifying', 'scene', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'almost', 'worth', 'watching', 'entire', 'film', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'superb', 'performance', 'second', 'screen', 'sadly', 'not', 'often', 'enough', 'Then', 'again', 'performance', 'so', 'mesmerizing', 'had', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', ""'d"", 'have', 'make', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'love', 'story', 'central', 'plot', 'Also', 'calibre', 'acting', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'superior', 'watching', 'other', 'actors', 'too', 'depressing', 'only', 'exception', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'performance', 'particularly', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'raw', 'emotion', 'quite', 'touching.Overall', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'Redbox', 'rental', 'primarily', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'aforementioned', 'performance', 'Thompson']",N/A

My wife wanted to watch this movie and I conceded simply because she bought me some pizza.The movie itself is good enough to watch, but I am not exactly raving about it right now.The character development in this movie is atrocious. I started off hating about 4 characters in the very beginning simply because their acting was terrible. I am not sure if it was the acting so much as the director's interpretation of Southern behavior, dialect and the stereotypical ""church people."" That is really what I took from some of these characters. Really heavy-handed stereotyping of Southern culture and it was a hard pill for me to swallow. I mean really, really hard to swallow.The main character also had a penchant for constantly mentioning books and trying to apply them to life. He did it way too often. I understand that someone who had something to do with this movie really had an extensive high school reading list. It was very unnecessary.Finally, one of the silliest moments to me, was a scene where the main character and the ""caster"" are out in the rain and he starts citing the movie Titanic. The main character is supposedly some ""jock"" according to the caster female protagonist and she seems to think he is a jock after quoting the Titanic. She also seems to think he is a cool kid in school. It just all seems a bit overdone and unbelievable.Anyway, if you get past the fact that this movie is way too exaggerated in too many ways, then this will be a decent experience for you with a supernatural background.",3,"Mediocre, but okay to watch.",1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,1623,"['First', 'let', 'place', 'little', 'background', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'adaptation', 'book', 'wife', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'conceded', 'simply', 'bought', 'pizza.The', 'movie', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'am', 'not', 'exactly', 'raving', 'right', 'now.The', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'atrocious', 'started', 'off', 'hating', '4', 'characters', 'very', 'beginning', 'simply', 'acting', 'was', 'terrible', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'acting', 'so', 'much', 'director', 'interpretation', 'Southern', 'behavior', 'dialect', 'stereotypical', 'church', 'people', 'really', 'what', 'took', 'characters', 'Really', 'heavy-handed', 'stereotyping', 'Southern', 'culture', 'was', 'hard', 'pill', 'swallow', 'mean', 'really', 'really', 'hard', 'swallow.The', 'main', 'character', 'also', 'had', 'penchant', 'constantly', 'mentioning', 'books', 'trying', 'apply', 'life', 'did', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'understand', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'movie', 'really', 'had', 'extensive', 'high', 'school', 'reading', 'list', 'was', 'very', 'unnecessary.Finally', 'one', 'silliest', 'moments', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'caster', 'are', 'out', 'rain', 'citing', 'movie', 'Titanic', 'main', 'character', 'supposedly', 'jock', 'according', 'caster', 'female', 'protagonist', 'think', 'jock', 'quoting', 'Titanic', 'also', 'think', 'cool', 'kid', 'school', 'just', 'bit', 'overdone', 'unbelievable.Anyway', 'get', 'fact', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'exaggerated', 'too', 'many', 'ways', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'decent', 'experience', 'supernatural', 'background']",N/A

One of them is a witch (or caster). The movie is entertaining, and the love story is just fine. I didn't saw any chemistry between the two leads, besides the movie was slow, and it gets boring sometimes (I almost fell asleep in the movie theater).

There were little things that weren't included that bugged me and there were huge things in this movie that bugged me. All in all this movie was just below average. The following rant may be a bit spoiler filled, so proceed at your own risk.Why did Lena and Ethan not conversate inside their heads? Why!? I feel like the relationship was so insubstantial in the movie and it made things just seem silly. It didn't make sense that Ethan knew that Lena was good and light and wouldn't go dark.Why didn't Ridley eat a single damn lollipop? Where were Link's drumsticks? Why was Amma so young? Those were some little things that bugged me. It was almost like when Hunger Games DIDN'T PUT MADGE IN! Why not? It would take like one minute and it would make a world of difference.Pretty much this was a movie based on bare bones of the novel.

Silva ""Superman_242""","[12, 14]","t seems that every studio is trying to replicate the success of the Twilight Saga at the box office by adapting a teen-supernatural-romance into a film franchise (fun fact, that will make you lose faith in humanity: you can now find a 'Teen Paranormal Romance' section in your local Barnes & Nobles).  I can't blame them.  The first movie only cost $37 million to make and made...wait for it...$392 million worldwide.  I saw the first three Twilight movies at the urging of my mother, and I will never get those 2 hours back.  I despise all of the ones I've seen.  They are awful cinema, bad romance, and sparkly.  However, I was intrigued by Beautiful Creatures, both by the story and the actors involved.THE GOODI was warned that the acting was going to be over-the-top and campy, so I actually appreciated the acting.  It is never a bad experience to see Emma Thompson on screen, and this is no different.  Also, the male lead (Alden Ehrenreich) is really good, adding a surprising amount of depth to what could have been a simple character.The story was somewhat cookie-cutter, but veered off the path enough that it was as intriguing as the trailer teased.THE BADI know I'm always critical of the score of a movie, but this one was bad.  In fact, it was almost on the level of Eragon, which was another Jeremy Irons movie.Viola Davis was ridiculously out of place.  Almost every scene she's in feels awkward.  If she doesn't start picking better movies to suit her style, she's going to go the way of Kevin Costner (i.e. an actor with accolades that now lives in obscurity).  There was a scene involving the town library that was so confusing and forced.One of the main message of the film is that 'Small Towns have Small Minds.'  I am sympathetic to that view because of my own upbringing.  However, the film went overboard in demonizing people of faith.  It could have been more temperate.  But, I guess that's what we should expect from Hollywood.CONCLUSIONIn comparison to other teen-paranormal-romance movies, this one is the best of the bunch.  And when compared to the other movies released so far this year (all of 2 months), it stands up pretty well.  But, it's not going to be making anyone's ""Best of the Year"" list.  It's pure popcorn, which was what I expected, and therefore I enjoyed it.  3.5/5 Stars.As a side note, if the movies released thus far are an omen of the quality of this year's films, we are in trouble.  Most in the critical community regarded 2012 to be an exceptionally good year for movies.

Having seen it I'll say it's a good not great supernatural flick that should appeal mainly to teens.  If I could draw an analogy I would say it's Ann Rice informed by Tim Burton and Tennessee Williams.  The main stars, Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert, are attractive and appealing and have definite romantic chemistry.  Good supporting cast that includes Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson, Viola Davis, et al add color to the proceedings.  Drama mixes nicely with macabre dark humor.

I had not read the book prior to watching this but am now eager to do so.Regardless, BEAUTIFUL CREATURES is vividly filmed with good performances by Alice Englert, Alden Ehrenreich, Emmy Rossum, Rachel Brosnahan, and just about everyone else. Another frequent complaint seems to be that there is not enough in the magic/special effects department: True, but the relative sparseness here adds a necessary realism and highlights what spectactics the film does have. The townspeople of Gatlin, South Carolina, are stereotypical Bible-thumping yokel-rubes, but that serves its purpose in the way it contrasts Lena (Englert), who is just about the only character who does not speak in a deep-southern accent. It also helps in how Ethan (Ehrenreich) and his buddy Link (Thomas Mann) completely defy their hickish appearances. BEAUTIFUL CREATURES captures the whole Southern Gothic tradition quite well. One way or another, the relationships in this film are very real. BEAUTIFUL CREATURES also walks the thin horror-comedy line most admirably.On the dimmer end of things, the whole texture of the film is a little slow and murky, and it would probably have been a little better with a few minutes cut here and there.",4,"""Claim the light.

1590405,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B009AMAGQM,FNDNreview,"[0, 8]","Typically, reviews begin with some kind of introduction that relates to the film being reviewed.  However, in this particular case, the film being reviewed happens to be about two families, each with teens in high school that happen to have an immediate attraction to one another - only to find one of those teens happens to be incredibly strange.  The two teens are able to move past the oddity and happen to fall in love with one another.  The problem is one of those strange individuals happens to have super powers, while the other just happens to be a mere mortal with an uncontrollable love attraction, creating a complex situation where it would simply be better off for everyone (in their small town community) if the two teens just stayed away from one another.  But, if they just stayed away from each other, there's really no reason to watch the movie - or read the book.  Does all of this HAPPEN to sound familiar?  If not, watch the Twilight Saga, and then come straight back here and finish reading this review about a completely relatable, yet unrelated film, Beautiful Creatures.Beautiful Creatures, based on the 2009 novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, stars Alice Englert as Lena Duchannes, a mysterious young girl that just moved into the small town of Gatllin, South Carolina - a traditional southern community that prides itself around the Battle of Honey Hill, during Sherman's March to the Sea in the American Civil War.  In school, Lena meets Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), a popular boy who has been having dreams about a faceless, mysterious girl - which turns out to be Lena.  Ethan instantly befriends her and discovers a number of abnormalities about Lena, her uncle Macon (Jeremy Irons), and Lena's cousin, Ridley (Emmy Rossum) - all of whom process the power of sorcery (witchcraft).  Upon her 16th birthday (which is rapidly approaching), Lena's true nature will consumer her and reveal her true self as either belonging to side of the light side or the dark.  After discovering both her mother (Emma Thompson) and her previously close cousin, Ridley, succumbed to the darkness (and are trying to turn her to the dark), Lena and Ethan do all they can to make sure she stays in the light.For a story about love and family - not to mention overused supernatural powers, the film is quite charming and enjoyable.  Obviously, this isn't the time or place to compare the differences between the film and novel, other than to say there are several differences.  Regardless, this film adaption has the potential to relate to a wide-variety of people, other than the young adults and that book readers that it's targeting.  The main theme revolve around true love and what two people will do for one another in order to be together.  The film also features a theme about the importance of family - no matter how evil or how twisted they appear to be.  When all of Lena's family members sit down for dinner, it's impeccably close to the ridiculousness of The Addams Family.  At the same time, it's incredibly ease to say, ""Wow, this really is the family from Hell.""  Jeremy Irons' character fits in well here in the role of the father figure.  His presence is nothing short of superb, and he really does ""take one for the team"" - you'll understand when you see it.  As this Liam Neeson-like father role, Irons' is the one trying to hold everything together, while the evil outside spirit (Lena's mother), tries to tear it all apart and destroy the newly in love couple.  Emmy Rossum is the flip-side of that coin, playing the evil seductress that stirs the family pot, causing nothing but havoc.In all honesty, if you gave Lena a magic wand, you could easily call her Harry Potter, not to mention it would also be incredibly easy to sit here and compare/contrast Beautiful Creatures to Twilight - but there's really no need to mention anything more about Twilight other than to say Beautiful Creatures does a better job of telling this story than Twilight.  The acting is far superior and the chemistry between Ehrenreich and Duchannes simply flows well together, and it's surprisingly believable that these two characters were preordained to find one another.  Unfortunately, the overshadowing issue holding this film back, stopping it from being the next Romeo and Juliet love story is the fact that it's simply a clich&eacute;-filled reproduction - with witchcraft, instead of Shakespearean dialogue or the use of vampires/werewolves/magic wands.Overall, Beautiful Creatures is sadly meant to cater only to readers of the novel and young adults.  Disappointingly, this novel's popularity doesn't even come close to matching the readership of Twilight or Harry Potter, leaving the margin for success to be rather slim.  At the moment, Beautiful Creatures is just the first film/adaption in a new series of young adult novels (and film series - depending on box office performance) - but for now, the sequels have yet to be published, so it's difficult to say when we or if we will ever see these characters again.  Until then, feel free to enjoy these characters and watch with confidence.Overall Grade:  C+",3,'Beautiful Creatures' a complex family affair,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,5137,"['Typically', 'begin',

1590408,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B009AMAGQM,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[1, 17]","This Valentine's Day, it's imperative that you see Beautiful Creatures because you want to celebrate this holiday that's totally in favor of only women in the best way you can. This movie reminds us all that true love is out there and possible, and available for the price of a totally over-priced movie ticket. So as you celebrate the love you have for your significant other--which was only suggested to you by lingerie companies advertising Valentine's Day erotic wear--enjoy this brilliant movie of rad amore.The story is an original work, even though it was lifted right off the pages of the novel by the same, darn name. Beautiful Creatures involves the story of a girl for whom love is impossible, mainly because she's frigid and a feminist, but also because she's a Caster, and her family's full of DARK powers. As a total coincidence--which has nothing whatsoever to do with a plot twist or plot furtherance--her 16th birthday approaches, when she's got to choose either the Dark Side of the Force or the Light Side of the Force.Being a Generation-Y teen who was raised in the entitlement era of the Obama administration and liberal ideology, however, Lena shows everyone when she decides to reject both sides! Instead, being the typical teenager today (selfish and self-centered, without any respect for hard work, values or merit), she simply has sex with every single male in the town of Gatlin. Then, she petitions the federal government to pay for all her birth control, even though Sandra Fluke was there and probably would have given her access to Plan B...maybe! In celebration of her efforts, Lena is given an award by both NOW and Planned Parenthood, and she gets a high five from none other than Obama himself (who just happens to be on a tour of Kenya). This movie was so good that it gave me goosebumps as I howled away in ecstasy and delight.This Valentine's Day, celebrate this greatest holiday of amore and lust in the purest way possible: By seeing a movie like Beautiful Creatures in order to pretend that Valentine's Day is anything but simply a contrived holiday invented by companies in order to market greeting cards, chocolates, flowers and teddy bears, which women use to get presents from men in exchange for intercourse.",5,The Only Things Beautiful About This Film Are Alice Englert's You-Know-Whats,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,2255,"['Valentine', 'Day', 'imperative', 'see', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'want', 'celebrate', 'holiday', 'totally', 'favor', 'only', 'women', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'movie', 'true', 'love', 'there', 'possible', 'available', 'price', 'totally', 'over-priced', 'movie', 'ticket', 'So', 'celebrate', 'love', 'have', 'significant', 'other', 'was', 'only', 'suggested', 'lingerie', 'companies', 'advertising', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'erotic', 'wear', 'enjoy', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'rad', 'amore.The', 'story', 'original', 'work', 'even', 'was', 'lifted', 'right', 'pages', 'novel', 'same', 'darn', 'name', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'story', 'girl', 'whom', 'love', 'impossible', 'mainly', 'frigid', 'feminist', 'also', 'Caster', 'family', 'full', 'DARK', 'powers', 'total', 'coincidence', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'plot', 'twist', 'plot', 'furtherance', '16th', 'birthday', 'approaches', 'when', 'got', 'choose', 'Dark', 'Side', 'Force', 'Light', 'Side', 'Force.Being', 'Generation-Y', 'teen', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'entitlement', 'era', 'Obama', 'administration', 'liberal', 'ideology', 'however', 'Lena', 'everyone', 'when', 'reject', 'sides', 'Instead', 'being', 'typical', 'teenager', 'today', 'selfish', 'self-centered', 'respect', 'hard', 'work', 'values', 'merit', 'simply', 'sex', 'single', 'male', 'town', 'Gatlin', 'Then', 'federal', 'government', 'pay', 'birth', 'control', 'even', 'Sandra', 'Fluke', 'was', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'access', 'Plan', 'B', 'maybe', 'celebration', 'efforts', 'Lena', 'given', 'award', 'NOW', 'Planned', 'Parenthood', 'high', 'five', 'none', 'other', 'Obama', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'tour', 'Kenya', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'gave', 'goosebumps', 'howled', 'away', 'ecstasy', 'delight.This', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'celebrate', 'greatest', 'holiday', 'amore', 'lust', 'purest', 'way', 'possible', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'order', 'pretend', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'anything', 'simply', 'contrived', 'holiday', 'invented', 'companies', 'order', 'market', 'greeting', 'cards', 'chocolates', 'flowers', 'teddy', 'bears', 'women', 'use', 'get', 'presents', 'men', 'exchange', 'intercourse']",N/A

1590410,A3BXOADDSC4BJU,B009AMAGQM,Glovely,"[3, 7]","Going in I knew this was going to be bad.  But I wondered how bad.  Well . . . [SPOILERS!] . . . the main female character Lena, who is a caster (i.e, witch) faces three challenges, none of which seems terribly urgent:1. When a female caster turns 16 she is ""claimed"": that is, she will involuntarily and irreversibly use her magic for either good or evil.  (Male casters are exempt from this for some reason.)  That's the theory.  But when Lena's cousin Ridley, who was already claimed for evil, shows up, the strict good/evil dichotomy doesn't hold up: Ridley has more or less behaved like a slut since she turned 16.  (There was an instance when she hypnotized a boy to walk in front of a speeding train, but that's in a flashback.)  If that's the extent of the evil Lena might endure, then why is everyone getting so bent out of shape?2. The claiming is the result of a curse involving Lena and her boyfriend Ethan.  Apparently his male ancestor, also named Ethan, and her female ancestor, Genevieve, were in love.  As a soldier in the Civil War, Ethan was shot.  Just as he was about to die, Genevieve cast a spell to bring him back to life.  As it happens, this is a spell they're never supposed to cast.  (So why the hell invent it?)  Just as Ethan came back to life, Genevieve turned evil and, well, killed him again.  (What a waste.)  Since then Genevieve's female descendants have had to face the claiming.  It's implied throughout the film that Lena can be prevented from becoming evil if she stays away from Ethan, but it's never quite clear what difference that would actually make.3. Lena's mother, Serafine, who was claimed for evil, has her sights set on Lena being claimed for evil as well.

Fine, I'll give them that, but I came to this movie with literally zero pre-conceptions, not knowing anything at all about it.  Didn't know that some people call it a &#34;Twilight&#34; ripoff or clone (thank goodness, because I never would have watched it), or that there was even a book, or that it was a romance.I thought that it was simply a pretty good story. Not overly deep, but fine.  Young Alden Ehrenreich was terrific in his performance; I expect to see a LOT more from this young guy over the years.  The female lead, perhaps.  The girls in the clique at school were a bit stereotypical and overdone, but...not so much so that I couldn't keep watching the film.  In any event, you could fairly easily root for the two young leads, for the standard (supernatural) good vs. evil scenario.Jeremy Irons does his usual, &#34;chew up the scenery&#34; bit, but he was perfect for this role.  I thought that the cinematography was just stellar.  Of course, Emma Thompson was her usual fab self, and a hoot to boot, as they say.  EFX were quite good.The story is simple and typical...boy meets girl, girl meets boy, girl is cursed to a dark fate.  ;-)  At least neither the boy nor girl GLITTERED in the sunlight, and they seemed to have a more-usual romance path than, &#34;I met you 5 seconds ago, and now I can't live without you, I'm marrying you at 17, having a baby before my skin clears up,&#34; etc.  The idea of sacrifice drives the movie; all the 'good' characters make sacrifices, basically, while the evil ones don't, which I thought at least had some interest behind it.  I think that Ehrenreich's portrayal really drives the emotional engagement of the film, at least, from my viewpoint.All in all, a fun movie to watch, reasonably engaging, better than most of the usual drivel, not a top-flight movie yet.  Could have been better, but, most certainly, it could have been a LOT worse.  I enjoyed this through the magic of Amazon and Roku (thank you!), and I have watched far suckier movies in my time.  A perfectly good way to use up two hours; pop up some popcorn, grab something to drink, and enjoy yourself.  If you enjoy supernatural stories, don't mind some romance, and don't come to it with a lot of preconceptions, I think it's a perfectly good little movie, under-appreciated on a lot of fronts.",4,"Having never read the book, I thought it was quite good; Ehrenreich was terrific.",1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,2407,"['Apparently', 'takeaway', 'here', 'someone', 'read', 'book', ""'d"", 'hate', 'movie', 'Fine', ""'ll"", 'give', 'came', 'movie', 'literally', 'zero', 'pre-conceptions', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'Did', ""n't"", 'know', 'people', 'call', '34', 'Twilight', '34', 'ripoff', 'clone', 'thank', 'goodness', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'was', 'even', 'book', 'was', 'romance.I', 'thought', 'was', 'simply', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'Not', 'overly', 'deep', 'fine', 'Young', 'Alden', 'Ehrenreich', 'was', 'terrific', 'performance', 'expect', 'see', 'LOT', 'more', 'young', 'guy', 'years', 'female', 'lead', 'perhaps', 'girls', 'clique', 'school', 'were', 'bit', 'stereotypical', 'overdone', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'watching', 'film', 'event', 'could', 'fairly', 'easily', 'root', 'two', 'young', 'leads', 'standard', 'supernatural', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'scenario.Jeremy', 'Irons', 'usual', '34', 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', '34', 'bit', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'thought', 'cinematography', 'was', 'just', 'stellar', 'course', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'was', 'usual', 'fab', 'self', 'hoot', 'boot', 'say', 'EFX', 'were', 'quite', 'good.The', 'story', 'simple', 'typical', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'girl', 'meets', 'boy', 'girl', 'cursed', 'dark', 'fate', 'least', 'boy', 'girl', 'GLITTERED', 'sunlight', 'seemed', 'have', 'more-usual', 'romance', 'path', '34', 'met', '5', 'seconds', 'ago', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', ""'m"", 'marrying', '17', 'having', 'baby', 'skin', 'up', '34', 'etc', 'idea', 'sacrifice', 'drives', 'movie', ""'good"", 'characters', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'basically', 'evil', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'thought', 'least', 'had', 'interest', 'think', 'Ehrenreich', 'portrayal', 'really', 'emotional', 'engagement', 'film', 'least', 'viewpoint.All', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'reasonably', 'engaging', 'better', 'most', 'usual', 'drivel', 'not', 'top-flight', 'movie', 'yet', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'most', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'LOT', 'worse', 'enjoyed', 'magic', 'Amazon', 'Roku', 'thank', 'have', 'watched', 'far', 'suckier', 'movies', 'time', 'perfectly', 'good', 'way', 'use', 'up', 'two', 'hours', 'pop', 'up', 'popcorn', 'grab', 'something', 'drink', 'enjoy', 'enjoy', 'supernatural', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'romance', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'lot', 'preconceptions', 'think', 'perfectly', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'under-appreciated', 'lot', 'fronts']",N/A

The lead plays a southern high school boy, but his southern accent is terrible--most of them were, save those few good ones mentioned before.What really drew me to this film was my fascination with witches and magic. It's a coolish story, but it has the obvious feel of teen fiction (it lacks the structure and reality of adult fiction). The story is inconsistent at times; the setting and background characters are complete stereotypes that are overdone.Furthermore, at the core of the story is an obnoxiously sexist premise that men don't have to worry about turning evil, but girls do because they lack the control of men.It also plays on this idea that one must be all good or all bad, but to be fair, it seemed to end with this idea that she was a bit of both.So, bad acting, bad philosophy, plot holes in a coolish story, it all makes for a disappointing watch overall. I did expect a little bit more but not much. I wouldn't recommend it; I don't even know why I passed up superior films that I need to watch.

The story line has been changed willy-nilly; events don't unfold chronologically, major plot points have been changed or dropped, and the ending doesn't even begin to resemble the taut conclusion to the first book. In addition, some important characters have been written out of the film version entirely while others seem to have undergone personality transplants.

1590440,A1L5WAZAL5H1SA,B009AMAGQM,Jon (Scott Reads It!),"[6, 9]","After I finished watching Beautiful Creatures, I was filled with so many emotions and feelings. Words like terrible, mediocre, ruined, disappointing were a fews of the words that kept on cropping up in my mind. The film adaptation of Beautiful Creatures is a disgrace, a mutilation of one of my favorite books.This film took so many of my favorite elements from the novel and completely cast them out the window. The gothic tone and emotion that were evident in the novel are lacking in the movie. Where was the suspense, the danger of the casters? This movie didn't feel like the book at all because it discarded so much. This movie was more of a sappy love story than the dark, paranormal tale that the book was. Instead of being dark and gritty, this movie was extremely cheesy, cliche, and ridiculous.From the get-go, I was kind of annoyed with Alden's accent and it struck me as extremely fake. People from the South don't talk like that at all, it can't help that Alden broke from his accent and acted without a several times during the movie.  He isn't a terrible actor but I'm not sure if he was right for the role of Ethan. He doesn't look 16 at all and he can't pass for a high school student at all. Alden portrayed Ethan in a melodramatic way that made the Beautiful Creatures feel so sappy and cheesy. There were one or two moments where I could tell Alden really got into character and those short moments are where he briefly shined.One of the biggest problems with this movie is the script and the plot. The director, Richard LaGravenese cut some of the best dialogue and scenes from the book. There were so many times when he put in jokes that were just so not funny. The dialogue in this movie isn't much better and I feel like LaGravenese should have just lifted dialogue from the source material. There were so many unnecessary changes that this mutilation didn't even feel like Beautiful Creatures. The ending of this movie was executed so poorly and was pretty illogical. Once again, if the director had bothered to stay true to the novel, this wouldn't have been a problem. The book has a far better ending that is fitting and an ending that actually makes sense.Don't you think, a director of a book adaptation should read all of the books in the series he/she is adapting? LaGravenese admitted in an interview that he didn't even read all of the books which is beyond ridiculous. How can you expect to make a good adaptation if you can't spend some time devoting yourself to the series? It's like trying to build a building with only bricks, you need the cement and other materials to help complete the job.The acting from Alice Englert who portrayed Lena did an okay job of portraying her. Her portrayal wasn't spot-on but it was a lot more consistent than Alden's. The real stars of Beautiful Creatures are the seasoned adult actors: Jeremy Irons, Viola Davis, and Emma Thompson. Irons truly gives his portrayal of Macon his all and it is quite evident that he captured Macon's essence perfectly. Irons's performance is truly memorable and is by far the best performance in the movie. Davis and Thompson are great but they can't compare to Irons's solid performance.Beautiful Creatures doesn't flow well at all from start to finish. Most of the movie runs at a sluggish pace and I kept getting so distracted because the movie didn't really capture my attention. I suffered through the movie in hopes that it would get slightly better. It became a teensy bit better but not much better in the 2nd half of the film. This is a movie that had great potential but it was executed so poorly. I really hope that Warner Brothers doesn't even think of making a sequel because it was that bad. As a fan of the book series, I'm extremely disappointed and repulsed by this mess of a film.

I thought that it would be another movie with a storyline like the twilight movies. While the storyline did have a few things that were a little like parts of the storyline in other movies it was different in the rest of the aspects. While they trailers for the movie made it seem a lot more exciting than it actually is i really liked it. I have watched it at least 4 times because it always keeps me intrigued.

Thomason ""Movie Family""","[3, 6]","Bowling for Movies Score: 31.5 of 300 - Ouch!What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average guy on the sofa, came up with to rate and score movies.  Using the latest technology (including a common household food processor and an expensive top of the line Italian espresso maker) and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  This review had originally been done prior to the institution of Bowling for Movies.  We re-did the review after a second watching just to provide the readers of the Bowling for Movies reviews a score, and well, you see it above.  If you bowl a 31, you basically walk in and get a beer and some nachos and watch the other people bowl.  Maybe one gutterball in there...Beautiful Creatures Blu Ray + DVD + Ultra Violet ComboMovie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):Ethan Wate is stuck in a small southern town.  He is pretty darn miserable and ready to get out as soon as he can.  He has lost his mother and his father is grieving so terribly that he is totally absent.  Then everything changes.  Lena Duchannes arrives and is the catalyst of his whole world changing.  It is a supernatural teen romance story that is not unlike Twilight, but written from the male point of view.  Lena is a caster and on her 16th birthday, which is quickly approaching, she will be claimed as either bad or good.  Ethan and Lena have to try and find a way to make sure she is claimed as good, and drama ensues.This movie is a typical teen lit novel translated to the screen.  The supernatural is woven into the standard horror that is high school, with stereotypical cheerleaders, and dumb jocks.  Lena turns the town on its head, and brings out into the open the actual family that founded the town - the Ravenwoods are bad-ass and the town would much prefer to ignore that dirty secret.What I loved:This movie visually captured the south.  I felt the mosquitos biting me.  It was sweltering.  It was gorgeous.  Loved it.Emma Thompson, Zoey Deutch and Tiffany Boone are personifications of southern women.  Trust me.  I live there.Emmy Rossum should possibly insure her legs, maybe her smile.  I dunno.  Maybe her whole body.What I did NOT like:The accents.  Really, they were tragic.The movie feels fragmented.  I got bored mid-film.  The lack of character development.Emma Thompson (no spoilers here) as another character entirely.  It felt like performance art.  It did not feel right.  Overacted at best.  Worthy of Days of Our Lives.The main character of Ethan was just awful.  Complete doofus.  He looked somewhere between stoned and dumb as a rock.  Ethan is portrayed as being well-read, a kid who reads high caliber novels and wants to escape the small town where he grew up.  But still, ignorance abounds.  One more guffaw and I kind of expected Gomer Pyle to pop out and say ""Golleee"".On the special features in the Blu Ray, the director tells us how he felt like certain things in the novels did not translate well to the screen.  While some of the movie contains parts of the book, somewhere in the middle, it just changed completely.  There were losses of entire characters, and the story was completely changed.  Apparently the book's writers enjoyed it, but I did not.*Please note that I did not review the movie as a comparison to the book.  They are different creatures entirely, one not so beautiful.  I actually re-watched the movie to do this review and removed the incredible bias I was feeling the first time I watched it.*Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

1590449,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B009AMAGQM,judy,"[0, 0]","I read Beautiful Creatures, as a book, back in September 2012. I found it intriguing, and fine, not great, but fine all the same. And I was very excited to see this film. I was even planning on seeing it open night but my plans changed, and I didn't see it till it came to Netflix, and traveled its way to my mailbox this June night. After previously viewing ""The Host"" and ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2"" I was a little worried, watching this film, that it would turn into one of those films, which I definitely didn't want. After viewing the trailer back in September, I found myself irritated by the southern accents, which actually, when you watch the movie aren't that bad. Compared to the likes of Tom Hank's in ""The Terminal"" anyway. This film will do some harm to the book though. So I warn the book readers, who read the book to NOT view this film. It  trails, deeply away from its source material, which made me mad of course. Well anyway, let's start with the dark, which include the character development, differences from the book, rushes the plot, and chemistry between the leads, flashback sequences, awkward moments, and the climax. This film feeds us little character development from anyone besides the two leads Ethan, and Lena. I mean I would have liked to see more screen-time for the character of Link (played by the excellent, Thomas Man) to develop.  As well as the beautifully, sexy Ridley, to develop. Also Macon, Emily (whose story sadly was never concluded), Amma, and Aunt Del, and Larkin. All those excellent, book characters came to the screen almost disappeared, really.  Plenty of the book characters never even made it to the screen, being axed from the book.  These excellent characters were given way less screen time then they needed and deserved. It's disappointing. As I have talked about before the film was almost completely different from the book. For starters half of the characters never made it to the film, Larkin, instead of being a dark caster, is a light caster,  Ethan's dad appears not once in the film, Amma, is the librarian, Macon, is not an Incubus, he is but a caster. Plus, half of the humanity from the book and love scenes that show Lena and Ethan, together falling in love are absent. And the ending is almost completely redone.  It's a big disappointment.  This film rushes its plot along as if it had been running late for a very important date.  Instead of having Lena, and Ethan, slowly falling in love, they are rushed and fall for each other in days, it takes time, and it lost its cute romantic story, by rushing the love. I hated the flashback scenes, it just looked fake, something you see in a b rated documentary on the History channel. Ugg. This film includes a few un-necessary scenes. While I found the scene where Emma Thompson's character brings Alden's character brownies a powerfully acted scene, and creepy, I didn't find it necessary. The climax, oh the climax. The film, suggest threw out, that the choosing ceremony, for weather you'll be light or dark, seems to be a very edge of your seat  scary thing, but what happens isn't what you had been waiting for threw out the film, or what the trailers suggest.  I thought of Ridley's character, a complete badass, looking for a fight, but what we see at the end is a cowering mouse that runs away at the first sign of Lena, getting  claimed. What the f***. Wow, like that's what I was waiting to see. And the evil Sarafine seems to promise, that she isn't going down without a completely epic battle, to the death, with magic, like in Harry Potter you know? Well what we see is a little talk of what love is, pain of course, Sarafine says. Then she gets taken out of Emma Thompson's body and disappears.  Completely disappointed with that.  I would have, liked to see Ridley get her butt beat by Lena, then watch a 5 minute battle with Sarafine, before she dies. Well anyways onto the lighter side of the story... The light stuff include, the costumes, cast, acting, chemistry, sets, opening, special effects, and the music.  The costumes. Oh the costumes are beautiful.  They are well detailed, and very much pretty to look at. I love Ridley's costumes the most. They are sexy to look at and make you just wanna look at em, and pause the movie. Aunt Del's costumes are also festinating.  The cast is spot on. Young, and beautiful rising stars, Alice Englert, and Alden Ehrenreich are great as Lena and Ethan. Just how I pictured them looking. Viola Davis makes the perfect Amma. And Thomas Mann the best Link. The real other star studders and the third and fourth best cast (besides the leads) have got to be Emmy Rossum and Jeremy Irons. Emmy Rossum looks beautiful, and stunning as Ridley. And Jeremy makes the creepiest, shut in version of Macon possible. And of course Emma Thompson, Margo Martindale, and Zoey Deutch, are excellent too. The acting is good, not great but good. Emma Thompson has got to be the best out of the lot, on the acting part. She makes her evil character scary and creepy as well as a funny villain.  She was probably the most into her role. Emmy Rossum also seemed to be having funny as the showy beautiful villain. She had style, and stole the screen. Alice Englert, and Alden Ehrenreich are excellent as the leads. They can pull of good chemistry with each other, and deepen their characters.  The chemistry in this film is great as Alice and Alden, share greatly realistic looking attraction to each other. The settings were neat, and while they might be considered a rip off of Twilights location's I just don't think that way. The locations are beautiful. I love em. The opening is good, it's introducing Ethan's narrative, and he, himself. It starts fleshing out his opinions. It started out slowly well the first five minutes. It was good. Just him. It works well. The special effects I hear were mostly practical. And they were pretty neat too. Like when Lena and Ethan were in the theater and the smoke started pouring in, and the screen turned into a battlefield and no one but Ethan and Lena can see it, well it's pretty cool.  Plus, when the glass shattered in the classroom, which was pretty cool to watch. And knowing that the glass sequence was real made it neat to watch even more.  The music in this film is great. I loved the trailers song as well as a few others that were pretty nice to listen too. Well all an all Beautiful Creatures, isn't beautiful. It's one of the better films of the year and definitely better than Twilight and The Host, it's still cheesy, and could have been made better. Also I can think of at least a whole better movie, I think I shoulda directed this, thoughts?

However based on the so-so reception from the public...I doubt it.I like it better than any of the Twilight movies or The Mortal Instruments &#34;City of Bones&#34;.

I did not read any of the books written in that category and highly doubt I will get the time or inclination to do so in the future. Yet, here I am writing an almost five star preview of Beautiful Creatures. It's an excellent movie and goes beyond the stale story of Lovers who go through hell to unite. Depending on your mind-set, you will notice allusions to many aspects of being human in this movie--love, ethics, feminism, power game, tribalism, etc. The storytelling was superb, and the main male character as well as the rest of the supporting characters did excellent job. Despite a small role, Etan's friend Link's actor outdid himself. I am no actor, but recognize a promising one when I see. That kid should try to get moe roles, and someday he may end up with an oscar. What prevented me from giving the movie five star is the ending. We, Americans can't seem to get over the obsession that every fairy tale has to have some kind of happy ending--at least that's how it seemed at the end, despite not showing any concrete happy ending [maybe a prospect of it?]. The show could appropriately have ended few minutes ahead, and that would be most fitting--a somber, yet an honorable tragedy.

Emmy Rossum brought real panache to her role as a villainess.

I had prejudged the movie and story, and assumed it was going to be another terrible/immoral teen flick. It was not. On the contrary, I thought it was funny, sweet, dramatic, creative, silly, and a great deal of fun.  Alden Ehrenreich, AKA Ethan, (the main male character) was delightful. He was very funny, charming, and cool. Some of the other characters/actors were forgettable, but overall the acting was decent. I loved the wit behind the story and a lot of the lines were great. There were a lot of one-liners that some of the older crowd will appreciate. I actually saw the movie at a prescreening for free with a group of people. Most of the people in the group were young. Normally, I try to avoid watching a movie with a lot of young people, however, in this case it was refreshing. Everyone pretty much laughed at the same places, and smiled, cheered, and cried at all of the trials and tribulations. It was a great family film for older children/teens. I do not recommend it for small children, preteens, the easily offended, or impressionable people. Frankly, I still have no intention of reading the novel. The movie was satisfying and very well made. The direction, cinematography, and effects were great. Anyone who was upset or confused by the accents or the story should have paid attention. Everything was explained and was very easy to understand. Prior to seeing the movie, I read countless reviews to determine whether it was worth watching. I must say that anyone who disliked the accents should realize that the vernacular/patois in the movie was perfectly fine. I realize many do not wish to acknowledge it but the patois in the south differs from other regions in the US. In other words, they actually speak that way. Do not be misled by the naysayers who state that the movie is terrible. This is a movie and not a novel, and therefore should be considered as two different mediums/entities. In truth, this is one of those movies that will be appreciated by fans of the supernatural, and fantasy stories.

I'm actually disappointed I didn't bother seeing it theatrically. I thought it basically looked like ""Twilight"" with witches. And while on paper that sounds like an apt comparison (both are supernatural romance movies based on young adult novels) it does do the film a disservice. I believe it's a better made and better acted film.From the trailers I thought the leads (Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert) seemed poor, with him seeming particularly terrible. To my surprise they were both great and the two had a really nice, believable chemistry. The supporting cast is also great. Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson seem to be having a great time, and Emmy Rossum is fun and sexy.From what I understand fans of the books weren't crazy about it, but I've never read the books and I loved it. I'm sad it was a box office flop as I'd love for the other books in the series to become films. I'm glad, unlike most movies based on a series of books, that ""Beautiful Creatures"" is able to stand on its own and doesn't really end with a big cliffhanger or anything (not in my opinion at least). But it would still be great to see more. It's unfortunate this had to become a victim of a terrible release date. I do believe with a different date where it didn't have to go up against another film attracting the same audience (Safe Haven) it would have performed much better. And if by some miracle they did decide to make another I do think the audience would grow as more discover the first on DVD/Blu-ray, as long as it was released amongst less competition. They'd certainly need to try and cut the budget in half though. But alas I'm not holding my breath for the series to continue, as sad as it may be. The only hope would be if sales/rentals are strong enough. ""Beautiful Creatures"" is well-worth watching though even if there probably won't be a sequel. Such an entertaining film.Technically I would rate this 4/5 stars, but I'm going with 5 to try and offset the bad ratings because it was different than the book. I get that it's hard to separate them when you've read the book but as a movie I thought this was incredibly enjoyable. I recommend trying to take it on its own merits. That's why I hate reading a book first if it's a movie or I know it's going to be a movie because usually you end up disappointed even though it's bound to be different.

If they had just edited a bit of the redundant beginning stuff, then this movie would be a clean 4 star movie.But I liked how they ended it. I felt they could end the movie as a single if they chose to because it had a typical teen angst unrequited love happily ever after ending, ish.

Also, you should know that this review will contain SPOILERS, so do not continue reading if you don't want to know why this movie doesn't do the book justice.When I first saw the movie trailer, I thought to myself it looked like something I would enjoy since I really liked the Twilight series, and I initially saw it as ""Twilight except with witches""... errr... ""Casters"".  Since the movie opening was a month away, it left me plenty of time to read the book.  I really enjoyed readingBeautiful Creaturesand read the entire book (all 550+ pages) very quickly.I knew I'd want to see this movie as soon as I could, so I was sure to make it a showing opening weekend.Overall, I REALLY did not like the movie.  I do not feel the movie even scraped the surface of the book.  It was more of a hollow shell of the literary version.  I understand that with movies you have to keep it brief because at most you have about two and a half hours to communicate the story, but this movie really butchered what was an otherwise good and entertaining story.  Having to cram several hundred pages into 2 hours is definitely a feat, but it's been done before and even done WELL before, so that is not even a great excuse for the filmmakers in this case.Things I did not like about the movie:* There was little-to-no character development and the pace was much too quick.  From the very beginning, the movie starts at a grueling pace and doesn't even give the audience a chance to soak information in and decide for themselves who these people are or what to make of the story or events.  I felt like key scenes or story lines from the book were left out that would have improved the character development exponentially.*To piggy-back on the lack of character development, there was absolutely no connection whatsoever between Lena and Ethan.  They are supposed to have such a strong emotional connection that they have dreamt about each other even before meeting each other (these dreams parlay into the following 3 books in the series), and they are supposed to even be able to telepathically talk to each other (which builds in the second story where Lena starts to shut Ethan out and he is left hurt).  This movie basically introduced the characters to each other, and then suddenly they love each other.*MAJOR character changes:-Ethan's Mom - Though deceased, Ethan's Mother is supposed to be a very pivotal character throughout the series.  She was a Caster Librarian and a genealogical expert which is important to the overall story.  Here, she is mentioned once... maybe twice and that is it.-Larkin in the book is a Dark Caster who is actually using his power of illusion to make himself look like a Light Caster.  In the end of the literary version, it becomes apparent to the Duchannes that Larkin has actually been fooling them all this time and had betrayed the family.  This parlays into Book 2 (Beautiful Darkness) where Lena drives Larkin's car because she can't bear to drive Macon's old car anymore and this leaves Ethan puzzled how she could be in something that belonged to the cousin that betrayed her and her family.  In the movie version however, Larkin is just a nice Light Caster who helped Lena in the end against Sarafine. (Did they seriously just do that?)  This is one of the biggest ones that bothered me because the feeling of betrayal is a powerful human emotion.  It reaches into your gut and pulls your insides out.  There was such a great opportunity to make the audience FEEL something, and the film makers did not capitalize on that at all.-Ethan's Dad was pretty much nonexistent in the movie.  I don't even think they cast an actor to play his dad?  Having read the book, I understand why he was in his study all the time, but people who haven't read the book will never know why.  I believe that in the book, Ethan's dad played a role in Ethan's character development... his emotional being that we never got to see in the movie.  We all know that Ethan lost his mom, but the audience is not given the opportunity to feel sorry for him because he might lose his dad too (Events in the book that included his dad towards the end were omitted from the movie).  Although his role was a small role in the book, I felt it was important nonetheless and it's a shame his character got cut out entirely of the movie.- Marian / Amma - In the film version, Marian's character was consolidated with Amma, and thus eliminated from the movie.  Again, I felt this made the story feel rushed... they didn't have enough for Amma in the movie so they made her librarian too.  Even with Marian's elimination, Amma's character was very one-dimensional.  She didn't do things that she did in the book like give the Wate family ""charms"" to ward against evil or anything.  She just mentioned a few times that she was a Seer, so I guess the audience was supposed to just take her word for it.  Character development for Amma left a lot to be desired.  The ending of the movie was also disappointing because in the end, Amma should have been there to try to help Lena, but the ending was changed (I'll get to that soon).- Mrs. Lincoln / Sarafine - The movie also consolidated Mrs. Lincoln and Sarafine into one character which completely blew my mind.  Although I know in the book it turned out that Sarafine was using Mrs. Lincoln's body, the movie made it seem like Mrs. Lincoln actually WAS Sarafine the entire time.  I couldn't understand why they did that, other than because they didn't know how to create that scene at the end where Sarafine ""steps out"" of Mrs. Lincoln's skin. It can't be that hard, could it? I'm sure the special effects nowadays could have done the job.- Boo Radley - Why did they have to get rid of the dog in the movie?! Did they forget that ""caster animals"" play a bit of an important role in the second story?- The Greats - I guess Amma didn't need The Greats in the BC movie series because Lena saved the world by casting that spell on Ethan so he would forget her.  How in the world are the filmmakers going to introduce The Greats later on when they play important roles in helping Amma, Ethan & Lena in the other stories?- The Sisters - Ethan's Great-Aunts were nowhere to be found in the Beautiful Creatures movie.  If the producers intend to use them to finish off the BC movie series, they are going to have a heck of a time introducing them (and the Greats, and the fact that Boo and the cat have magical seeing abilities, and...)MAJOR Plot changes:- Guardian Angels - The ""Guardian Angels"" in the book were eliminated. Although I don't think this was a HUGE deal, it was disappointing that the ""Guardian Angels"" were eliminated from the movie version.  In the book, I felt it really developed the characters of the girls (Emily, Savannah, etc), and emphasized the fact that Lena was basically being persecuted for no reason other than being from out of town and different.  The ""club"" also played a part in the end of the book where Link wore a ripped up Guardian Angels shirt at Lena's Surprise party (more on that later...) because it offered up a bit of irony they they were all at Lena's birthday party when they campaigned against her just days before.  In the movie version, the only ""character development"" that the girls got were lines that started with ""My mama said...."".  Cliche'.- Winter Dance / Ridley's return - The Winter Dance in the book served a purpose, in my opinion, because Lena wanted so badly to just be normal and do normal teenage things like go to the high school dance.  The dance also developed the characters of the mean high school girls and reintroduced Ridley and showed the book's audience what she was capable of.  In the book, the incident at the Winter Dance is what made them have that ""hearing"" about getting Lena expelled from school and not just the window breaking.  The winter dance and everything that happened there was completely eliminated from the film.- Breaking the Curse / Spell on Ethan- In the movie, Lena finds a cure to the curse that she shares with Amma, but doesn't tell Ethan.  How anti-climatic. In the novel, there is not a way to break the curse.  This was a pretty significant shift from the book.  In the movie, She also decided to put a spell on Ethan so that he forgets they ever loved each other because it would save him from being hurt and from being brought further into their world.  I was actually pretty shocked that the authors agreed to let them shift so significantly because nothing NEAR this happened in the book.- The Book of Moons - The Book of Moons is really significant in the book series -- all the way to the very end of the last novel.  In the movie however, it's simply used as a Caster encyclopedia where she finds a cure to the curse.  Yawn.- Lena's Birthday Party / The Ending - The book had such a completely different ending than the ending in the movie.  The book involved an elaborate plan including a surprise birthday party that was Ridley's idea to separate Lena and Ethan.  That didn't happen in the movie.  The ending was extremely different than the novel.  In the movie, Ethan is separated from Lena because he just doesn't remember them ever being together and Macon uses Larkin's illusion powers to make himself look like Ethan so that he can thwart Sarafine's plans.  After the anti-climatic scene where Lena realizes it is actually her uncle that is dead, Sarafine/Mrs. Lincoln has this weird out of body experience and Lena looks pretty evil.  The book was much better at creating tension and suspense during this scene, so this scene was such a let-down.  The movie scene was basically just a gun-shot and Uncle Macon telling Lena to ""Claim Yourself"".Before the credits roll, there is a message that tells the audience 6 months had passed, and there is a scene in the library where Ethan comes to let Amma know he is going to NY with Link to look at colleges.  Ethan briefly talks to Lena making casual chit-chat and leaves.  He drives off with Link and as he is about to leave Gaitlin, he stops and screams her name like he suddenly remembers everything.  Link also doesn't seem phased at all that 6 months ago he actually shot Lena's uncle.  (Explain that one to me!?!)I need to point out that my review of the movie is not based on how it deviated from the book (which was definitely a bummer), but to point out how the movie lacked a lot of key elements to make it a good stand-alone story.  The plot was rushed and sloppy, the characters were one-dimensional at best, and it was basically a giant small Southern town cliche with some spells sprinkled in for good measure.  Had all the right elements been in place, I would have enjoyed the movie even if differed from the book.In the end, the filmmakers took all the magic and mystery out of the novel.  They spoon-fed the audience the very basic elements of the story, and didn't allow the audience to experience what could have been a really great, magical journey.  The movie offered no suspense or conflict at all.  I would highly recommend reading the book, however, I would also recommend skipping the movie because it was such a major disappointment.",1,I can't believe the authors allowed their story to be butchered.,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,11261,"['feel', 'need', 'preface', 'saying', 'trailer', 'movie', 'made', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'Also', 'should', 'know', 'review', 'will', 'contain',

1590502,A2AK7ZFKW08HID,B009AMAGQM,movielover,"[1, 1]","Let me start off by saying that I haven't read the books and I have no intention on reading them. I also hate when movies, especially good movies, get put down due to the fan base of the books being ""let down"" by the movie. You have to look at it as two different forms of art and appreciate it for what it is.Beautiful Creatures really surprised my, due to the fact that on the back of the blu ray case it says it is a mix of Twilight and The Hunger Games. Now I didn't hate the Twilight movies, but they are definitely not in my top must watch movies, though I did really enjoy New Moon, just because the wolves are kick ass in that movie.Personally this movie had a Dark Shadows look and feel to it, which didn't bother me at all, cause I extremely enjoyed Dark Shadows, which similar to this movie, took a beating due to the fan base of the old TV series, which again was totally unfair.By now after reading the numerous other reviews you probably already know the basis of the movie. Yes it is a love story and that might turn alot of guys off, but there is plenty of kick ass scenes, and the love story really doesn't overwhelm the movie. There are something like 500 special effects shots in this movie, so there is plenty of eye candy for us guys.

1590512,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B009AMAGQM,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[11, 14]","When you think of teenage problems, what typically comes to mind? Passing a big exam, who to ask to prom, college applications, getting a driver's license --- ya know, things of the mundane sort. But Lena Duchannes isn't your average teenager and driving is the least of her problems. What the good people of Gatlin don't know is that Lena's a castor, a witch who will be claimed for either the light or the dark upon her sixteenth birthay. This claiming has the power to irrevocably change her life and the lives of all humans, because unbeknownst to her, she will be the strongest castor of all. Ethan had no idea what was in store for him when he befriended the mysterious outcast, Lena. Now he's caught up in a mystical battle between good and evil as he struggles to protect the girl he loves. Fates will forever be changed, secrets uncovered and choices made as a dark power takes hold on Lena and the town.I think most of us are aware that Beautiful Creatures was a book first and movie second. I haven't yet read the novelisation but with the recent YA book to movie boom, it's no surprise why they chose to adapt it for the silver screen. There's romance, magic, intrigue and a bevy of young, beautiful people and a setting that's to-die-for. Beautiful Creatures is a coming of age story, only what sets it apart is the tinge of paranormal romance. Think Twilight only with stronger characters and so much more substance. What more could you want? Well, some coherency for one thing. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the movie, but I've gotta admit, at times it was a little hard to follow.My biggest problem with Beautiful Creatures is that it's difficult to discern how much time has passed between scenes and timing is sort of, um, critical considering Lena's predicament. Also, it felt like huge chunks of ctitical information were missing in places though I am aware this could be because I haven't read the book. I'm just glad I went with my BFF who read the series to fill in the gaps where I was floundering. And even then, she too, had some issues with following along. So in regards to reading the book and watching the movie, I'd say you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't. Other than that though, the movie has a ton of potential and I was able to overlook many of it's smaller flaws.The strength of this movie lay in its amazing cast. Alden Ehrenreich (as Ethan) exudes this warm goofiness that endeared him to my heart. He's believable as the small-town guy with big dreams and the chemistry he shared with Englert was palpable. Alice Englert (as Lena) played the tempramental teen to perfection which is fitting for both the character's age and her precarious situation. She is, simply put, stunning. I also thought Jeremy Iron's (as Macon Ravenwood) performance was as equally powerful as his eccentric character. The only surprising performance that fell a bit flat for me was Emma Thompson's. As incredibly talented as she is, I thought she was a bit too over-the-top for my liking and it felt too theatrical for the grim nature of her character. All in all, the cast shined and played off eachother so well.If the actors don't appease you in Beautiful Creatures, the setting sure will. LaGravenese painted a perfect picture of the lazy Southern small town. Ethan described it best, ""My momma says there's two types of people that live in Gatlin, the people too stupid to leave and the ones too stuck to move,"" and I thought it was spot-on. The cinematography is haunting and ominous and magical and it plays well to the overall tone of the movie. I think it's interesting how LaGravenese tried hard not to rely too much on CGI SFX, instead, forgoing the green screen in favour of more traditional methods --- it is well noted and much appreciated! Overall, I did enjoy the movie despite being hard to follow and I'm eager to read the book series. It's a good one, just not perfect.Food for Thought: If you're looking for another Twilight, Beautiful Creatures is it --- only it's so much better. While not exactly the greatest movie-going experience, I liked it enough to hope for a sequel. Ehrenreich is charismatic and Englert stuns as the leading duo. And if the characters don't sweep you away, the charming setting will. With a bit more clarity this one would have most certainly been a winner!",3,Lacks Coherency But Not Charm!,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,4336,"['When', 'think', 'teenage', 'problems', 'what', 'typically', 'mind', 'Passing', 'big', 'exam', 'who', 'ask', 'prom', 'college', 'applications', 'getting', 'driver', 'license', 'ya', 'know', 'things', 'mundane', 'sort', 'Lena', 'Duchannes', ""n't"", 'average', 'teenager', 'driving', 'least', 'problems', 'What', 'good', 'people', 'Gatlin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Lena', 'castor', 'witch', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'claimed', 'light', 'dark', 'sixteenth', 'birthay', 'claiming', 'power', 'irrevocably', 'change', 'life', 'lives', 'humans', 'unbeknownst', 'will', 'be', 'strongest', 'castor', 'Ethan', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'store', 'when', 'befriended', 'mysterious', 'outcast', 'Lena', 'Now', 'caught', 'up', 'mystical', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'protect', 'girl', 'Fates', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'changed', 'secrets', 'uncovered', 'choices', 'made', 'dark', 'power', 'hold', 'Lena', 'town.I', 'think', 'most', 'are', 'aware', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'was', 'book', 'first', 'movie', 'second', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'read', 'novelisation', 'recent', 'YA', 'book', 'movie', 'boom', 'surprise', 'why', 'chose', 'adapt', 'silver', 'screen', 'romance', 'magic', 'intrigue', 'bevy', 'young', 'beautiful', 'people', 'setting', 'to-die-for', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'only', 'what', 'apart', 'tinge', 'paranormal', 'romance', 'Think', 'Twilight', 'only', 'stronger', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'substance', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'want', 'Well', 'coherency', 'one', 'thing', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'times', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'follow.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'difficult', 'discern', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'scenes', 'timing', 'sort', 'um', 'critical', 'considering', 'Lena', 'predicament', 'Also', 'felt', 'huge', 'chunks', 'ctitical', 'information', 'were', 'missing', 'places', 'am', 'aware', 'could', 'be', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'went', 'BFF', 'who', 'read', 'series', 'fill', 'gaps', 'where', 'was', 'floundering', 'even', 'then', 'too', 'had', 'issues', 'following', 'along', 'So', 'regards', 'reading', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'damned', 'do', ""'re"", 'damned', 'do', ""n't"", 'Other', 'movie', 'ton', 'potential', 'was', 'able', 'overlook', 'many', 'smaller', 'flaws.The', 'strength', 'movie', 'lay', 'amazing', 'cast', 'Alden', 'Ehrenreich', 'Ethan', 'warm', 'goofiness', 'endeared', 'heart', 'believable', 'small-town', 'guy', 'big', 'dreams', 'chemistry', 'shared', 'Englert', 'was', 'palpable', 'Alice', 'Englert', 'Lena', 'played', 'tempramental', 'teen', 'perfection', 'fitting', 'character', 'age', 'precarious', 'situation', 'simply', 'put', 'stunning', 'also', 'thought', 'Jeremy', 'Iron', 'Macon', 'Ravenwood', 'performance', 'was', 'equally', 'powerful', 'eccentric', 'character', 'only', 'surprising', 'performance', 'fell', 'bit', 'flat', 'was', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'liking', 'felt', 'too', 'theatrical', 'grim', 'nature', 'character', 'cast', 'shined', 'played', 'off', 'eachother', 'so', 'well.If', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'appease', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'setting', 'sure', 'will', 'LaGravenese', 'painted', 'perfect', 'picture', 'lazy', 'Southern', 'small', 'town', 'Ethan', 'described', 'best', 'momma', 'two', 'types', 'people', 'live', 'Gatlin', 'people', 'too', 'stupid', 'leave', 'ones', 'too', 'stuck', 'move', 'thought', 'was', 'spot-on', 'cinematography', 'haunting', 'ominous', 'magical', 'well', 'overall', 'tone', 'movie', 'think', 'interesting', 'how', 'LaGravenese', 'tried', 'hard', 'not', 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'CGI', 'SFX', 'instead', 'forgoing', 'green', 'screen', 'favour', 'more', 'traditional', 'methods', 'well', 'noted', 'much', 'appreciated', 'Overall', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'being', 'hard', 'follow', ""'m"", 'eager', 'read', 'book', 'series', 'good', 'one', 'just', 'not', 'perfect.Food', 'Thought', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Twilight', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'exactly', 'greatest', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'liked', 'enough', 'hope', 'sequel', 'Ehrenreich', 'charismatic', 'Englert', 'leading', 'duo', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'sweep', 'away', 'charming', 'setting', 'will', 'bit', 'more', 'clarity', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'most', 'certainly', 'been', 'winner']",N/A

After the mess that was The Blood and Chocolate movie a few years back I chose not to read them. I thought the movie was well acted, having been born and raised in the south I know it can be hard to pick up on the southern drawl. All the actors did so quite well. I am the first to admit that the southern accent sounds leeps and bounds different from those in the rest of the country and it is a hard one to pick up. I say this because of some reviews complaining about it. Yes we do really talk like that. We drop our 'r' and lengthen our o's and such. Now as for the feel and look at the movie it was very very good. I think the movie itself as a stand alone is great and that many people giving it bad reviews are those angry because it is so different than the book. And I understand after watching Blood and Chocolate i wanted to pitch my dvd player out the window, but Blood and chocolate was a good book turned into a bad movie in general. Beautiful Creatures is actually a good movie. So if you can get past that it is not like the book or if you have never read the book like myself it is very much worth the watch. The acting is dead on the cinematography is lovely and the story was good with an interesting plot.

What happened? Well for one thing some of the characters in the movie (Lena & Amma) didn't visually fit the book (a big no no for film makers). Another thing was zero chemistry between the lead actors. That chemistry that made the first Twilight movie so good was lacking here. Then you have the actual story which is complex for a YA sci-fi but is also what makes it so great. Well they took the great story from the book picked the central character that everyone loves and said ""let's leave her out of the movie, no one will ever notice""....what!?!?

When Ethan Wate, played by Alden Ehrenreich, meets a mysterious girl named Lena, he immediately falls for her. But Lena and her family have a secret. They are all Casters and when Lena turns 16 her powers will be claimed for the light or the dark. Will Lena be strong enough to change her fate, and will Ethan be strong enough to deal with what happens if she goes dark?I absolutely love Beautiful Creatures.  It is so aesthetically pleasing and the sets and costume design are beautiful. This is a far better film than I expected. It isn't just another teen romance, I believe it has something for everyone. There is quite a bit of humor in this film that is an unexpected bonus, as well as political and religious quips that I found quite entertaining. One thing that really makes this film stand out from the rest is that the main characters aren't visually perfect. They don't look like cut -outs from magazines. I found it extremely pleasing to see that there is more than looks to film stars. I love all the emotion in this film, it is definitely a tear jerker and it pulled at my heartstrings. I love that the acting in this movie. It really made me feel something beyond pure entertainment.I really enjoyed the relationship between Lena and Ethan because it feels very real and natural. My favorite character is Link, played by Thomas Mann, is by far the funniest character. He is Ethan's right hand man and is always cracking clever remarks and causing laughable moments. I love Thomas Mann from other films such as ""Hansel and Gretel,"" ""Project X,"" ""Fun Sized"" and other films, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw him in this. He has a way of making an audience laugh at awkward moments which is perfect for this movie.My favorite scene is when Ridley Duchannes comes to town. She is Lena's cousin who has become a dark Caster and is trying to assist her aunt in making sure Lena goes dark and she is quite the character. She pretty much does whatever she wants, whenever she wants and she brings an edgy quality to the quiet town where this movie takes place.I recommend Beautiful Creature for ages 13 and up. It is a bit mature for younger audiences but it is perfect for teens and adults. It will make you laugh, cry and want to fall in love.

1590540,A4FX5YCJA630V,B009AMAGQM,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","Consider this a review from someone who hasn't read a single word of the books by Kami Garcia & Margaret Stohl, but whose interest has been sufficiently piqued by this film adaptation, particularly in regards to what happens next.The story had been described to me as ""Twilight, only good"" and on sitting down to watch it soon became apparent that this was an invertedTwilight. Though it's a mortal/supernatural romance and therefore a forbidden love story, in this case it's the girl who is one of the ""beautiful creatures"" of the title, whilst the boy is the fascinated outsider who just can't stop himself from trying to untangle this inexplicable human-shaped mystery.The gist of the story: Ethan Wate lives in Gatlin, South Carolina, a backwater town with ""twelve churches and one library."" He can't wait to finish high school so he can leave for good, but his momentum slows a little when the new girl comes to town. Lena Duchannes is an instant target of gossip by his classmates, with rumours that her family are Satan-worshippers and that she's the reason for the bizarre weather patterns in the area. Naturally, all this simply piques his interest - particularly since he recognises Lena from a series of recurring dreams that he's been experiencing. He investigates further, offers her his hand in friendship, and in due course learns that she's a witch (or in preferable terms: a Caster).It is in this that the film is at its strongest: when it's concentrating on the budding attraction and mutual fascination between Ethan and Lena, helped along with some fairly snappy dialogue. Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert have great chemistry, enough to cover for the relative speed of the falling-in-love process, and they make Ethan and Lena's affection for each other easy to believe in. Neither one is remotely glamorous or conventionally good-looking, and the film isn't afraid to make them look uncool: he wears dorky reading glasses and she never goes without her dark eye-shadow.Together they capture that sweet, clumsy, sincere first love that exists between teenagers. Ethan's persistent pursuit of an initially prickly Lena could have turned sour if not portrayed carefully, but it's soon clear that it's his ability to take the weird and wonderful elements of her life in his stride that wins her over.The two of them are booklovers (Ethan reads Kurt Vonnegut, Lena recommends Charles Bukowski) and they're endearingly pretentious about it (as opposed to ""Twilight"", in which Edward and Bella's frequent comparisons of themselves to Romeo and Juliet was just plain pretentious). He's fascinated by something new and challenging, and she opens up to his simple kindness and - in her words - ""drooling charm.""In fact, it almost comes as a disappointment to learn that they have a connection based on a love affair in a past life. I believed in them as teenagers, not as epic lovers, and the ""flashbacks to a past life"" element felt completely unnecessary, almost serving to undermine the sweetness of the bond they formed in the here-and-now.Of course, this is when the plot comes a-knocking, and where the film begins to lose its steam. It transpires that in Lena's family, all the Casters go through a ceremony on their sixteenth birthday that determines whether or not they'll be claimed by the forces of the light or the dark. According to them, this is when each individual's true nature reveals itself, and in Lena's case (given her parentage and latent powers) this is a huge deal. She is rightfully terrified by her impending birthday, and though I'll give the book the benefit of the doubt and assume that there's more exploration into the ethical implications of this plot-point, it's not handled particularly well in the film itself.It's certainly not perfect. The plot is meandering, and never quite decides whether it wants to be a simple love story or a coming-of-age drama with a side order of witches and magic spells. Several characters flit in and then immediately out of the storyline without any indication of where they are/what they're doing while they're off-screen, and there is a central conceit regarding free will and destiny which really did not sit well with me. But for the most part, it's a fun ride.I suppose we'll never know how they managed to get Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson (as siblings Macon and Seraphin) on board for this, but the two of them are clearly having a blast, and if it weren't for their limited screen-time, they would have certainly stolen the film right out from under our teen protagonists. Viola Davis as Amma is sadly wasted and Emmy Rossum packs a (small) punch as Ridley in which she very much plays against type.Finally, the whole thing reminded me a bit ofPractical Magicin tone, but with a distinct Southern atmosphere: lots of fun costumes and intricate set designs: wild exteriors contrasted with pristine interiors, and a real Gothic flavour.

1590544,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B009AMAGQM,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2Based on the novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, ""Beautiful Creatures"" is a piece of Southern-fried gothic filtered through a modern sensibility. Lena Duchannes  is a mysterious teenage girl whose sudden arrival in a small South Carolina town sparks suspicion, concern and outrage among its highly conservative citizens - all but fellow high-schooler Ethan Wate, that is, who finds her a refreshing and fascinating addition to the provincial community he calls home.  An avid reader of Kurt Vonnegut, Ethan lives for the day when he'll be able to flee this lil' ole backwater town and experience what life has to offer in the great world just beyond its borders. What he doesn't count on is that excitement, in the form of Lena, will find its way into his own backyard.Director Richard Lagravenese's potpourri of a screenplay - replete with witches, sirens, magic spells, family secrets, dysfunctional relatives and Civil War reenactments - is all done in a spirit of lively good fun, filled with wit, warmth and wisdom about young love. Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert are charming as the offbeat star-crossed lovers, but it's when a group of old pros - Jeremy Irons, Viola Davis, Emma Thompson, Emmy Rossum, Eileen Atkins, Margo Martindale - takes the stage that the real fun begins (and a young pro like Emmy Rossum is a delight as well).Due most likely to budgetary constraints, the special effects occasionally come off as a trifle sub-par by Hollywood standards, and there is a whiff of the CW about the whole  project from time to time (there`s an undeniable scent of ""The Vampire Diaries"" and even of HBO`s ""True Blood"" here). There are also some lapses in continuity and logic, such as the fact that the story begins at the start of the school year, yet, in a few days' time, we've somehow already arrived at Christmas vacation (maybe it`s that old witchcraft stuff again). And one doubts that even in a deep-in-the-heart-of-Dixie state like South Carolina, the weather would be quite this warm and the landscape quite this lush in the middle of December.Still, flaws aside, ""Beautiful Creatures"" should more than satisfy its target audience of swooning tweens.",3,"Should please the ""Vampire Diaries"" crowd",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,2184,"['***1/2Based', 'novel', 'Kami', 'Garcia', 'Margaret', 'Stohl', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'piece', 'Southern-fried', 'gothic', 'filtered', 'modern', 'sensibility', 'Lena', 'Duchannes', 'mysterious', 'teenage', 'girl', 'sudden', 'arrival', 'small', 'South', 'Carolina', 'town', 'sparks', 'suspicion', 'concern', 'outrage', 'highly', 'conservative', 'citizens', 'fellow', 'high-schooler', 'Ethan', 'Wate', 'who', 'refreshing', 'fascinating', 'addition', 'provincial', 'community', 'home', 'avid', 'reader', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'Ethan', 'day', 'when', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'flee', 'lil', 'ole', 'backwater', 'town', 'experience', 'what', 'life', 'offer', 'great', 'world', 'just', 'borders', 'What', ""n't"", 'count', 'excitement', 'form', 'Lena', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'own', 'backyard.Director', 'Richard', 'Lagravenese', 'potpourri', 'screenplay', 'replete', 'witches', 'sirens', 'magic', 'spells', 'family', 'secrets', 'dysfunctional', 'relatives', 'Civil', 'War', 'reenactments', 'done', 'spirit', 'lively', 'good', 'fun', 'filled', 'wit', 'warmth', 'wisdom', 'young', 'love', 'Alden', 'Ehrenreich', 'Alice', 'Englert', 'are', 'charming', 'offbeat', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'when', 'group', 'old', 'pros', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Margo', 'Martindale', 'stage', 'real', 'fun', 'begins', 'young', 'pro', 'Emmy', 'Rossum', 'delight', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'likely', 'budgetary', 'constraints', 'special', 'effects', 'occasionally', 'come', 'off', 'trifle', 'sub-par', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'whiff', 'CW', 'whole', 'project', 'time', 'time', 's', 'undeniable', 'scent', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'even', 'HBO', 's', 'True', 'Blood', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'lapses', 'continuity', 'logic', 'such', 'fact', 'story', 'start', 'school', 'year', 'yet', 'few', 'days', 'time', ""'ve"", 'somehow', 'already', 'arrived', 'Christmas', 'vacation', 'maybe', 's', 'old', 'witchcraft', 'stuff', 'again', 'one', 'doubts', 'even', 'deep-in-the-heart-of-Dixie', 'state', 'South', 'Carolina', 'weather', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'warm', 'landscape', 'quite', 'lush', 'middle', 'December.Still', 'flaws', 'aside', 'Beautiful', 'Creatures', 'should', 'more', 'satisfy', 'target', 'audience', 'swooning', 'tweens']",N/A

1590549,A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N,B009AMAGQM,Sandy Kay,"[7, 10]","I saw this movie at an advance screening even though there were 2 strikes against my possible enjoyment:  first, I'm much older than the demographic for the movie and second, I hadn't read the book (Beautiful Creatures).  Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the movie.Because I haven't yet read the book (but intend to now that I've seen the movie), I can't comment on how true to the book it is, I can only evaluate it as a stand alone movie.  (See below for some differences I have read about in articles.)The first impressive thing is the cast.  This cast includes some amazing stars.  Jeremy Irons exuded Southern charm with a little smidgen of menace as Uncle Macon. Emma Thompson stole every scene she was in playing the dual role of Mrs. Lincoln/Sarafine and was fantastic when she was playing Sarafine playing Mrs. Lincoln (readers of the book will understand what I mean). When she and Jeremy Irons were in a scene together, it was something to watch.  Viola Davis played Amma (combined with the book character Marian who isn't in the movie), making her both a comforting figure and a little spooky.  Emmy Rossum pulled out her inner siren to play Lena's cousin Ridley.  I love Margo Martindale and wished there had been more of her role as Aunt Del.  I recognized the face, but not the name of the actress who played Gramma -- Eileen Atkins has a huge list of acting credits.  The actors who played Ethan and Lena did a great job as well, though they have much less acting experience.  If I were a teenage girl, I'd have a crush on Alden Ehrenreich or at least on his character, Ethan Wate.I suppose the previous reviewer has a point that there are a lot of cliches in the movie:  new odd girl with a secret comes to town, gets picked on by most of the popular kids, but cute boy likes her.  Yeah, we've all seen that story many times, but it doesn't mean it's boring.  You also have the added elements of magic, good vs. evil and generational curses (all of which could be cliches themselves).  The writers took those familiar themes and wove them together with witty dialogue to make what I thought was a very entertaining movie.  Next to the acting, my favorite part was the writing.  I laughed a lot during the movie, which I didn't really expect going in.I'm the wrong generation and hadn't read the book but I still really enjoyed the movie.  As much as I enjoyed it, I can only imagine how much more someone in the right age demographic or a fan of the book would love it.I have just two cautions.  First, the ""Christian"" characters do not come off well in this movie, other than perhaps the minister.  I don't personally like when characters that are supposed to represent my faith are portrayed as nasty so that was a little tough for me.  The second thing will be obvious to anyone who read the book or even watched the previews, but there is magic, some of it dark magic and the Casters could be considered witches.  I know some people have issues with that so be warned and skip this movie if you do.  Otherwise, go see this movie.Also, for the parents who are concerned about sex and violence in the movies their teens see:  Ethan and Lena do a lot of kissing but there isn't any sex.  Link also has a make-out session but again no sex.  There is some violence, especially during the Civil War battle flashbacks and in a few other scenes crucial to the plot (that I won't spoil for those who haven't read the book).  I would not consider this to have gratuitous violence but younger kids might get scared so I would keep this to older tweens and above.Update:  Now that the movie is open, there is more information available about how the movie differs from the book.  In addition to combining the characters of Amma and Marian, Ethan's Dad never appears in the movie, and one of the biggest shock scenes for me in the movie happened a completely different way in the book (not going into details because I don't like spoilers).  Also, the curse and breaking the curse are changed some from the book. It's a lot of book to fit into a 2 hour movie so don't be too hard on the writers & director.

The accents and the mannerisms were either spot on, or a mockery of the South. The scenery, filming, and set styles were gorgeous and beautifully made. The characters, while based upon the books, were loosely adapted from those characters and allowed minimal depth. Though I must say that the young man who played the lead character Ethan Wate did an excellent job. While I enjoyed the movie as it is, the screenwriters severely limited any potential franchise possibility by condensing, cropping, and bastardizing a series of books into one film. If they had allowed Beautiful Creatures the Movie, to be based sorely upon the first novel of the series by the same name, we would have serious contention for the recently vacated Harry Potter/Twilight YA throne. Any possibilities for further movies based upon the series was stopped before this movie was ever released. As an adaptation of a book onto the big screen, I have to give this film a dismal 1 star. The only thing they got right was names, places, and basic single plot (even that they severely messed up, especially the ending and the Claiming scene.) Now, no bitter resentments because I ""didn't treat the movie fairly"". I am sorry, but it was a film adaptation of A BOOK, and the only reason to do that is because the books have a large enough following to warrant the expense of a film. If you don't treat the source material with respect, then how then do you expect any kind of positive feedback from that same fan base for the movie? If the books had never existed, and this truly was a standalone film, I would have considered it a nicely done film, pleasant with a loose plot and a seductive cinematography to it.

And I watch alot of movies. There are hardly enough words to describe the atrocious mess that is Beautiful Creatures. For the record, I've read the entire Beautiful Creatures series. It's a great, refreshing read. Its fantasty, adventure, drama and tragedy really appeals to a large audience. But I'm a realist. I know book adaptations are never perfect, and some miss the mark by alot. About ten minutes into this movie though, I wanted to press stop on the dvd player. FIrst, the entire cast is badly mis-cast. Everyone, from Ethan and Lena, to even Macon. And poor, poor Amma, one of the best characters in the series was reduced to a complete stranger. And where is Ethan's dad??? The whole thing is a travesty and frankly, it made me annoyed and frustrated that I even wasted time on it.Despite the length, the film felt very rushed. Explanations happen so quickly that someone who did not read the book may have some difficulty figuring out what the heck is going on. It is a hard book to adapt. Too much happens and it's not straightforward. It's not about a lonely girl who falls for a sparkly vampire. There is no comparison and actual effort has to be made. Important elements and plotlines have dissapeared, leaving everything a muddled mess. The entire film is a let-down. The southern 'accents' are terrible and even the enormously talented Jeremy Irons sounds off throughout the film. The only one who looks to be having any fun is Emma Thompson. The effects are boring and predictable, I didn't even notice the musical score and the costumes are over the top and out of place during certain scenes.If you have read the books and not watched the film yet, I advise you to stay far, far away.

Since I have not read the book, I felt I might enjoy it more than those that had read the book, especially since I like movies in this genre.Acting:The lead actor with the southern accent thing was noticable, mainly because I have a strong southern accent. I felt it was a bit too much but did not ruin the movie. It seems to be stronger at the beginning then weaken as the movie progressed. His acting is somewhat static and monotone. No personality.The lead actress spent the majority of the movie trying to make people not like her. It worked for me as well. Even less personality.The other actors in this movie gave very lackluster performances, except for Jeremy Irons. Irons was the best part of the movie. However, this was not even close to his best.I found it very difficult to like any character in this movie except for the role of Macon by Irons. They were either bad people or uninteresting characters with brief, poor roles.Storyline:A teenage girl, a Caster (whatever that is), is going to turn good or bad on her birthday. A romance that cannot happen and a family curse is thrown in for good measure.Cinematography/Graphics/Same area: The cover/artwork for the movie is the most interesting part of this movie and it is not in the movie. No great special effects, kinda boring in that department. The tornado scene was the best computerized graphic. The location scenery was pleasant. Ravenwood Manor was disappointing. On the outside the manor appears very old, the inside is sleek and modern with almost no furniture. Costumes were lacking for everyone involved. Makeup was uninteresting. The lead actress looked like she had a home perm gone bad, then tried to brush it out. An old lady with bright purple hair?Family friendliness: If there were dirty words, I did not notice. No nekkid people nor sex. No real graphic violence nor blood/guts. People do get killed. I doubt kids will find it interesting.In my opinion, this movie failed in every department. It did not keep my attention well. At times, I considered just stopping it early. I did not care about the characters nor what happened. The ending was boring.I feel this movie ranks about a 2.
