I love it so much that I put my children on swim teams for 5 years, even when the passion for swimming was clearly mine, not theirs.  You don't go into swimming for the camaraderie, or the glory. You go into swimming because you can't not swim.  The pool draws you.Pride captured that feeling. This movie was beautiful.  The way the swimmers move through the water, the way the water drips off their hands, it really communicates a love of swimming. The determination, the perseverance, all because of a need to master the water--it's in this movie.It also mentions the black thing. That thing that's kinda lurking in the background when you're the only speck in the room.Jim Ellis didn't go into a popular black sport. In the 60s, he was the only black person on his college swim team, and sometimes was unable to compete because of it.He didn't stop swimming because of unpleasant experiences.  He couldn't. The pool kept drawing him in.  And he shared his passion with some kids.  He took what he had in his hand, and he made a difference in the lives of others.Other characters in the movie didn't understand this drive, but it was infectious.  Pretty soon everyone was cheering for these people--they recognized purpose when they saw it.And purpose brought with it hope.  And hope brought success.  After a while, the movie transcended swimming, and it became about a community coming together.

The first thing I noticed was that, even though he'd earned a degree in mathematics, Coach was willing to take any job he could to get started in the work world.  He didn't hold out for some prestige mathematics position.  Then, he proved all those potential employers who rejected him wrong by making a genuine success of the lowly job he did get.  In the end, he never used his mathematics degree in the typical way.After that, the story is about taking some unruly ghetto boys (and later also a girl) and turning them into a successful swim team.  This is a very inspiring story, with a very realistic portrayal of ghetto teens, especially black teens.  The racial element is very subtly and wisely depicted, Also, the story is full of properly depicted traditional values.

And for a while, we bought into it.

1074818,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000Q7ZNYU,Grady Harp,"[7, 7]","PRIDE does not open any new doors in the genre of film biopics of teachers who raise the status of downtrodden students to the point of genuine appreciation of self worth.  The story has been told countless times with different characters, both male and female, different races (African American, Hispanic, Caucasian, etc), and different areas of the United States.  But despite the recurring similarity of heart-on-the-sleeve stories such as this, PRIDE stands solidly on its own merits, in part due to the well developed and written screenplay by Kevin Michael Smith, Michael Gozzard, J. Mills Goodloe, and Norman Vance Jr. based on the life and contributions to society of Jim Ellis, in part due to the sensitive direction of Sunu Gonera, and in part due to the fine cast.  The idea behind the story may not be new, but PRIDE is a fine example of the genre.Opening in the 1960s we meet Jim Ellis (Terrence Howard) as a superior swimmer unable to use his gifts because of his race.  Jump 10 years forward and Ellis has finished college as a math major and seeks to teach in Philadelphia, only to face racism again. Desperate for work he accepts a 'closing down' job at a condemned Philadelphia Recreation Center tended by downtrodden Elston (Bernie Mac) who resents Ellis' intrusion into his domain.  Ellis restores the center's swimming pool and gradually initiates a swim team for troubled teens, young boys and a girl who are new to swimming and even newer to the thought that they can become someone important and rise out of their slum surroundings and influence of drug lords.  With time Ellis teaches the team not only how to swim like champions, but also how to gain faith in themselves through PDR (Pride, Determination, Resilience), eventually winning a championship as a team of African Americans in a city still plagued by racism.The cast is excellent: Terrence Howard once again proves he can create a character of complete credibility, completely immersing himself in a role with all of the subtle facilities of fine acting; Bernie Mac at last is given a serious role and rises to the level of Howard in skill; Kimberly Elise and Tom Arnold provide fine cameo roles.  But one of the treasures of this film is the cast of young actors who seem so natural that they deserve special plaudits: Brandon Fobbs, Alphonso McAuley, Regine Nehy,  Nate Parker, Kevin Phillips, and Evan Ross. Clint Eastwood's son Scott Reeves plays a pivotal role as a racist swimmer.So despite the overexposure of stories such as this, PRIDE stands out as one of the best.  It is a beautifully filmed and well-developed homage to a very worthy man and coach: PDR.

The talented Terrence Howard, complete with a early 1970's hair style with sideburns, plays Ellis who, although he has a degree in math, can only get a job at a recreational center that is going down the tubes in Philadelphia. He convinces the neighborhood kids to learn to swim and coaches them in a swimming team that soon enters competitions, both of the local and state level.Howard is a fine, fine actor, one of those rare mortals who apparently can cry almost on cue. He wept copious tears (not a part of the original script) in the film ""Hustle and Flow"" upon hearing a beautiful gospel song sung. He weeps easily here as well.""Pride"" reminded me of another true story also from the early 1970's. The inspiration for youngsters was a man whose nickname was ""Happy,"" as he always was. An extremely talented musician, he was accepted at Julliard School of Music but could not afford to go. (I suppose affirmative action did not reach that far up.) Instead he had to attend and graduated from Tennessee Tech in Nashville. Mostly by his hard work alone, he was able to pull together a college choir that sang like angels in an underfunded AME College in Florida. These young people, many of whom worked one or two jobs while attending college, inspired everyone who heard them as they toured both Florida and other states.""Pride"" is a movie not to be missed.",5,A Way Out Of No Way,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,1666,"['beginning', 'suspect', 'how', 'Pride', 'will', 'end', 'are', 'familiar', 'kind', 'inspirational', 'feel-good', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'based', 'true-to-life', 'experience', 'one', 'Jim', 'Ellis', 'who', 'taught', 'swimming', 'countless', 'African', 'American', 'teenagers', '30', 'years', 'Philadelphia', 'talented', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'complete', 'early', '1970', 'hair', 'style', 'sideburns', 'plays', 'Ellis', 'who', 'degree', 'math', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'job', 'recreational', 'center', 'going', 'down', 'tubes', 'Philadelphia', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'learn', 'swim', 'coaches', 'swimming', 'team', 'soon', 'enters', 'competitions', 'local', 'state', 'level.Howard', 'fine', 'fine', 'actor', 'one', 'rare', 'mortals', 'who', 'apparently', 'can', 'cry', 'almost', 'cue', 'wept', 'copious', 'tears', 'not', 'part', 'original', 'script', 'film', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'hearing', 'beautiful', 'gospel', 'song', 'sung', 'weeps', 'easily', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Pride', 'reminded', 'true', 'story', 'also', 'early', '1970', 'inspiration', 'youngsters', 'was', 'man', 'nickname', 'was', 'Happy', 'always', 'was', 'extremely', 'talented', 'musician', 'was', 'accepted', 'Julliard', 'School', 'Music', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'go', 'suppose', 'affirmative', 'action', 'did', 'not', 'reach', 'far', 'up', 'Instead', 'had', 'attend', 'graduated', 'Tennessee', 'Tech', 'Nashville', 'Mostly', 'hard', 'work', 'alone', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'together', 'college', 'choir', 'sang', 'angels', 'underfunded', 'AME', 'College', 'Florida', 'young', 'people', 'many', 'whom', 'worked', 'one', 'two', 'jobs', 'attending', 'college', 'inspired', 'everyone', 'who', 'heard', 'toured', 'Florida', 'other', 'states', 'Pride', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A
1074821,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000Q7ZNYU,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","""Pride"" is a good watch and is it safe to say the good outweighs the bad? For me it was, but it depends on what you are looking for in a film. ""Pride"" is inspired by the true story of Jim Ellis (Terrence Howard) who starts a swim team at the Philadelphia Department of Recreation. It's 1974 and though it was a great time for music, race relations where still a scab on our country as a whole. Mr. Ellis took it upon himself to help a group of underprivileged, urban, youth, and actually a community, take pride in themselves.That is one of the main things that work. The story. We are not talking about a high school that had a losing record but got together to win the next year. This was a group of young men who had never even been in a pool much less thought about swimming in competition. But they had a coach who believed in them and when the other side of the tracks, the city council and even their families where telling them ""no"", they said ""yes"" through their actions and determination. And by using lesser known actors it brings in the realness of the story. It is like you are looking back into the '70's on their faces. Relieving a real moment in time. The music helps a lot. The soundtrack works well with the look and style to again bring home the '70's era. The O'Jays, The Isley Brothers, The Brothers Johnson, James Brown, Aretha Franklin; music that is prominent through the film and makes it classic.What doesn't work so well for me is surprisely Terrence Howard as Coach Ellis. Howard is a fine actor but not believable in the role of coach so much. He lacks the Denzel Washington strength that most coaches exude. It doesn't have to be loud and forceful but it is there, right below the surface and Howard does not have it. Thankfully Bernie Mac is there to salvage the casting dilemma. Mac is brilliant and is an element that keeps this film from being a total acting fiasco. The other non working part of ""Pride"" is the predictability and need to have every stereotypical character imaginable. The tough kid on the edge, the weak kid wanting to be accepted, the ladies man who just wants the hook up, and the evil city council woman bent on bringing it all down. The story alone works and the writers should have gone with that strength.""Pride"" is Rated PG for thematic material, language including some racial epithets, and violence. It is safe for the family and a good way to talk to your kids about racial issues. Maybe that will keep them from making the same mistakes our parents and grandparents made. Mistakes that still amaze me to watch. The sheer idiocy of a race and culture in a modern society is baffling to the mind. I give Pride 4 out of 5 breast strokes. Though this film will not be a record breaker at times you will laugh and cry and cheer with a look at Pride.",4,"Before you can be proud of yourself, you have to earn it.",1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,2807,"['Pride', 'good', 'watch', 'safe', 'say', 'good', 'bad', 'was', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'Pride', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'Jim', 'Ellis', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'who', 'swim', 'team', 'Philadelphia', 'Department', 'Recreation', '1974', 'was', 'great', 'time', 'music', 'race', 'relations', 'where', 'still', 'scab', 'country', 'whole', 'Mr.', 'Ellis', 'took', 'help', 'group', 'underprivileged', 'urban', 'youth', 'actually', 'community', 'take', 'pride', 'themselves.That', 'one', 'main', 'things', 'work', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'talking', 'high', 'school', 'had', 'losing', 'record', 'got', 'together', 'win', 'next', 'year', 'was', 'group', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'been', 'pool', 'much', 'less', 'thought', 'swimming', 'competition', 'had', 'coach', 'who', 'believed', 'when', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', 'city', 'council', 'even', 'families', 'where', 'telling', 'said', 'yes', 'actions', 'determination', 'using', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'realness', 'story', 'are', 'looking', 'back', ""'70"", 'Relieving', 'real', 'moment', 'time', 'music', 'lot', 'soundtrack', 'well', 'look', 'style', 'again', 'bring', 'home', ""'70"", 'era', ""O'Jays"", 'Isley', 'Brothers', 'Brothers', 'Johnson', 'James', 'Brown', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'music', 'prominent', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'surprisely', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Coach', 'Ellis', 'Howard', 'fine', 'actor', 'not', 'believable', 'role', 'coach', 'so', 'much', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'strength', 'most', 'coaches', 'exude', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'loud', 'forceful', 'there', 'right', 'surface', 'Howard', 'not', 'have', 'Thankfully', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'there', 'salvage', 'casting', 'dilemma', 'Mac', 'brilliant', 'element', 'film', 'being', 'total', 'acting', 'fiasco', 'other', 'non', 'working', 'part', 'Pride', 'predictability', 'need', 'have', 'stereotypical', 'character', 'imaginable', 'tough', 'kid', 'edge', 'weak', 'kid', 'wanting', 'be', 'accepted', 'ladies', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'hook', 'up', 'evil', 'city', 'council', 'woman', 'bent', 'bringing', 'down', 'story', 'alone', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'strength', 'Pride', 'Rated', 'PG', 'thematic', 'material', 'language', 'including', 'racial', 'epithets', 'violence', 'safe', 'family', 'good', 'way', 'talk', 'kids', 'racial', 'issues', 'Maybe', 'will', 'keep', 'making', 'same', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'made', 'Mistakes', 'still', 'watch', 'sheer', 'idiocy', 'race', 'culture', 'modern', 'society', 'baffling', 'mind', 'give', 'Pride', '4', '5', 'breast', 'strokes', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'record', 'breaker', 'times', 'will', 'laugh', 'cry', 'cheer', 'look', 'Pride']",N/A

Where the odds are against someone and it seems impossible to accomplish a goal. I've seen it in kids movies, comedy, and even more serious ones like this one. To be honest they get boring after a while because you know that there are really only two outcomes, they win or they lose. Pride kills that feeling I had and made me feel pretty good. It gives you an amazing feeling watching it, I believe that feeling is pride. The film starts 10 years earlier at a very important swim meet. Terrence Howard plays Jim Ellis, a young man that just wants to compete. At the meet Jim is told by his coach that the other teams and judges don't want him to swim because he is African American. His coach supports him and tells him to swim anyway but the teams still refuse to swim and he has no competition.Now it is 1974 in Philadelphia and even after finishing college Jim is turned down for jobs he's qualified for. After a long frustrating job hunt Jim accepts a job cleaning up the Philadelphia Department of Recreation so it can be closed down in a few months. There he meets janitor Elston (Bernie Mack) who is very close to the building having been there when it was opened many years ago. Instead of tearing the building down Jim ends up really cleaning it up, even the swimming pool. The two become good friends after a while and accomplish a great thing. Jim runs into some kids who have athletic potential and some funny jokes as well. The kids just play basketball all day but now their rim is being taken down because the center is closing down.On a very hot day Jim lets them in to swim and cool off but they got a lot more than that. Jim coaches the kids on to become great swimmers and even break the same racial barrier that he suffered 10 years ago. Because there are so many characters it's a bit hard to explain everyone without making this a very long review. What I will say is that each character will definitely get to you. This is a true story that is great to see on screen. A few actors really stuck out to me, of course Kimberly Elise was great and Bernie Mack wasn't just doing comedy. Bernie did a great job in showing his love for the Rec Center and also the kids. Evan Ross showed great potential playing a character that really isn't easy. I understand that Terrence Howard got nominated for awards for Hustle & Flow but this is the film he deserves those for and I hope he gets them.The casting period was perfect; all of these actors did a great job. It's easy to take a star and fault the film because there have been so many like it before it but I won't take that star. What you'll be watching it for is to get that feeling it gives you when you see what Jim Ellis does. To see how he changed something that was dying into something that creates amazing swimmers to this day and even one that is going to the Olympics. The DVD had great quality and pretty good extras.

Jim is African American, and the white competitors in North Carolina weren't happy to be competing against him.10 years later, Jim has landed in Philadelphia.  Despite his credential to teach math, the only job he can get is cleaning out the recreation center in the poor part of town.  It's scheduled to be torn down soon.  The only person inside the building is maintenance man Elston (Bernie Mac).  The closest anyone else comes to it is playing basketball outside.That changes one day when the basketball hoops are taken down in the march toward tearing down the center.  As five of the guys stand there fuming about the loss of the hoops, Jim invites them in to use the pool.Slowly, Jim gains their trust and begins to teach them the fundamentals of swimming.  They gain enough skill to ask to go to a meet, hoping to meet women.  But do five men and one woman really have the skills to compete against all male teams who have been training for years?Okay, let's get the obvious out of the way first.  This is an underdog sports movie featuring kids from a bad neighborhood.  Picturing every cliche that normally brings to mind?  Yep, they're here.But, is this movie worth seeing?  Absolutely.As is always needed for a film like this to succeed, you need to become attached to the characters.  Jim is a sympathetic character from the start, and the youth he's working with grow on you quickly as well.  The result is a movie that truly does inspire.To top is off, the acting is great.  Terrence Howard is absolutely believable as Jim.  His drive to reach the kids comes through in every scene.  I'm not usually a Bernie Mac fan, but he did a great job as well with a part that is mostly series with a few comic bits thrown in.  And the kids were all great.I do have a couple complaints.  The minor one is the needless slowing down of the climax.  The two swimmers in the final race are slowed way down to build suspense.  And I do mean way down.  It was beyond laughable.My bigger complaint was the language.  Considering the PG rating, I was surprised by the handful of ""s"" words that littered the film.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 0]","""Pride"" recycles some familiar stereotypes and film clich&eacute;s to present a dramatization of some of the accomplishments of swimming coach Jim Ellis.  If a film fits easily into a formula, it should be well done or at least have something new or important to say.  I'll go ahead and admit that I'm a bit of a sucker for the underdog-makes-good sports movie, from ""Rocky"" to ""Glory Road"", so in fairness I'll go ahead and admit I'm willing to accept a few cosmetic blemishes in this genre.Terence Howard gives another excellent performance in the lead.  A competitive swimmer in North Carolina in the sixties, Jim Ellis met the inexcusable but expected prejudices.  In the opening we see Jim at a meet where competing teams refuse to swim in the same pool as a black man.Cut to fifteen years later we see that Jim has obtained a math degree and hopes to coach swimming.  He applies to prestigious Main Line Academy where Tom Arnold's character tells him in essence that ""his type"" couldn't coach at the school.  Jim goes to the unemployment office where he's given a temporary position wrapping things up at a Philadelphia Department of Recreation center slated for closing.The Center is dilapidated and you can see why the city would no longer want to fund it.  Bernie Mac is good as Elston, the Rec center maintenance man who is just waiting for the ax to fall, then is mad to find out from Ellis - the new guy.  Kimberly Elise is good as Sue, the girl-from-the-neighborhood-who-made-good and understands Elston's hurt at the closing of the center.  Today a city council-woman, we're told in a scene that she ""made it"" as a result of the Rec Center. But even Elston admits that no one has actually used the center in months, other than the boys who play pickup games of basketball on the courts outside.The next part of the movie gives us the set-up: Jim puts a little elbow grease into the center, even though it's closing, including cleaning and filling the swimming pool that looks like it hasn't been used or cleaned for years.  Elston gives Jim a hard time.  The boys play basketball outside - until workers remove the rim as part of the movement towards closing the center.Jim finds the boys playing a pickup ragged version of basketball water polo.  The boys rag on the guy whose job is working at the rec center where it appears there is no work.  Jim offers a suggestion for improving swimming technique to one of the prideful teens. The boy challenges the old man to a race.Much of the rest of the film can be guessed without much thought, but Howard and Mac carry us along that path in a way that made me feel glad to take the ride.  One of the chief shortcomings of the movie is lack of character development.

An idealistic coach takes a ragtag collection of recalcitrant youngsters, and through discipline, hard work, and a litany of inspirational speeches, turns them into a winning team overflowing with character and pride.  When the youths have to battle racial prejudice on top of everything else - as in ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Glory Road"" - well, that's just additional icing on the feel-good cake.It would be easy to be cynical about a movie like ""Pride.""  It clearly knows all the right buttons to push as it manipulates the emotions and stacks the decks in ways that could call into question the integrity of its makers.  Yet, for all its slavish devotion to the formula, ""Pride"" works as a movie, thanks, primarily, to the actors who approach their roles with an earnestness and sincerity that bring the concept to life on screen.Terrence Howard portrays Jim Ellis, a former competitive swimmer, who in 1974 is sent to dismantle a failing rec center run by the Philadelphia Department of Recreation.  Once there, he meets up with a group of inner city boys whom he teaches to swim, and who, as a team, make the transition from hopeless underdogs to state champions in the course of a single season.  Of course, it goes without saying that Ellis has to contend with the initial cockiness and lack of discipline of his own swimmers, but he also has to battle the prejudice of the other all-white teams against whom they compete as well as a local street hoodlum bent on drawing the boys into a life of crime.Luckily, Howard receives strong support from Bernie Mac, Tom Arnold and a handful of fine young actors who acquit themselves well in the role of the swimmers.There are times when ""Pride"" lays it on a little thick, when it seems more interested in tugging at our heartstrings than in telling a completely believable story, but I suspect that most members of the audience will be as awash in goose bumps and tears by the end of the movie as the script itself is in cliches.

And you are right, there are a lot of movies out there based on a group of teenagers facing difficult challenges and finding solace and a way to move forward in life in a sport or an art. The plot of the movie, except for a couple of unexpected turns, is pretty predictable too. But I still think that this is a film worth watching, because the story is presented with the needed level of emotion, and the acting is really good compared to other sport movies out there.The film is based on the true story of Jim Ellis and his swim team, which he built from scratch after landing in the Philadelphia Department of Recreation as a cleanup worker. Previously, Ellis had been a victim of racial discrimination and had problems with the law as a result. Now, he has to face some of the same problems when he starts coaching a group of kids that are in danger of losing their way in life. With his love and commitment, Ellis finds a way to make these teenagers understand that working as a team and giving it their all is enough to reap the well-deserved benefits.Terence Howard and Bernie Mac are both excellent in their respective roles, and the cast of kids does not disappoint. The technical aspects relating to the swimming are a little off, but that was expected. You can definitely tell that most of the actors on Ellis' team are not real swimmers, while the kids on the opposing teams are. This of course is possible because the acting needed from the opponents is fairly limited.I was a competitive swimmer for several years, so I can understand how my interest for the sport may influence my evaluation of this movie, but I still think that most people will have a good time watching it. The only group to which I would not recommend this film is to those that are not interested in swimming and that are looking for a ""new story"", since they will not find that here.",4,"""I'm tired of embarassing myself, let's get out of here""",1192060800,"10 11, 2007",2007,1953,"['know', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'say', 'same', 'concept', 'been', 'done', 'are', 'right', 'are', 'lot', 'movies', 'there', 'based', 'group', 'teenagers', 'facing', 'difficult', 'challenges', 'finding', 'solace', 'way', 'move', 'forward', 'life', 'sport', 'art', 'plot', 'movie', 'couple', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'too', 'still', 'think', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'story', 'presented', 'needed', 'level', 'emotion', 'acting', 'really', 'good', 'compared', 'other', 'sport', 'movies', 'out', 'there.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Jim', 'Ellis', 'swim', 'team', 'built', 'scratch', 'landing', 'Philadelphia', 'Department', 'Recreation', 'cleanup', 'worker', 'Previously', 'Ellis', 'had', 'been', 'victim', 'racial', 'discrimination', 'had', 'problems', 'law', 'result', 'Now', 'face', 'same', 'problems', 'when', 'coaching', 'group', 'kids', 'are', 'danger', 'losing', 'way', 'life', 'love', 'commitment', 'Ellis', 'way', 'make', 'teenagers', 'understand', 'working', 'team', 'giving', 'enough', 'reap', 'well-deserved', 'benefits.Terence', 'Howard', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'are', 'excellent', 'respective', 'roles', 'cast', 'kids', 'not', 'disappoint', 'technical', 'aspects', 'relating', 'swimming', 'are', 'little', 'off', 'was', 'expected', 'can', 'definitely', 'tell', 'most', 'actors', 'Ellis', 'team', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'swimmers', 'kids', 'opposing', 'teams', 'are', 'course', 'possible', 'acting', 'needed', 'opponents', 'fairly', 'limited.I', 'was', 'competitive', 'swimmer', 'several', 'years', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'interest', 'sport', 'may', 'influence', 'evaluation', 'movie', 'still', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'only', 'group', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'swimming', 'are', 'looking', 'new', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'here']",N/A

Terrence Howard is one of my favorite actors these days (seeHustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition), even if rap music isn't your thing).  His work here as an amateur swim coach is solid.  And the music featured throughout the movie is classic '70s soul and r&b;, so if you like that stuff - crank up the volume.What I didn't know for sure after seeing the preview - but strongly suspected - was that the movie would be formulaic and predictable.  This suspicion was confirmed after viewing the movie.  But what surprised me was just how poorly the forumla is executed.  I love this kind of movie when it's well done.  Even when I know pretty much what will happen, I can easily get caught up in the insprirational rush.  This one doesn't work, for a number of reasons.  The kids who decide to form a swim team - they aren't even allowed one personality trait each.  Sure, there is the poor student who's guardian doesn't want him to be even more distracted from his schoolwork by extracirricular activities.  But for the most part, the ensemble of young actors - and one actress - who make up the underdog swim team aren't given anything specific to do.  Well, they like swimming, but that's about it.  In fact, when the all-boys team gets a first female member, nothing even slightly interesting is done with that plot development.Bernie Mac plays the manager of the youth center - scheduled to be closed down - at which Terrence Howard and his charges train for swim meets.  Howard is a government worker who is told to close up the rec center.  Mac's character is very disgruntled by the prospect of losing the center (which is so unfrequented that he can sit around watching soap operas all day).  Later, he becomes friends with Howard and helps the swim team in what are quite frankly unspecified ways.  I liked Mac's performance quite a bit - he's funny at times, but it's mostly a dramatic performance.  But the reasons he warms up to Howard and his attempts to organize a competitive swim team are unclear.Anyway, the movie chugs along and hits all the expected plot points as Howard helps the kids learn to take pride in themselves.  The all-black team is met with harsh and disturbing racism (including racist white audience members at a swim meet who laugh derisively when one of the black swimmers injures himself).  These elements are all handled fairly perfunctorily - the strength being found primarily in the excellent acting.When it comes right down to it - swimming just doesn't translate particularly well to cinema.
