1208035,A32T2H8150OJLU,B001KKU9C8,ARH,"[13, 16]","I have been aware of the Sea Shepherd Society for nearly 20 years now.  I routinely introduced them to my environmental studies classes as we reviewed prominent environmental and conservation NGOs (non-governmental organizations).The Sea Shepherds are a self-proclaimed direct action organization whose main agenda is the protection of marine species from illegal commercial exploitation.  Their highest profile work is the protection of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.  This is the focus of the reality series ""Whale Wars"".The founder of the Sea Shepherds, Paul Watson, was one of the co-founders of Greenpeace, but he was eventually voted out of that organization because his tactics were generally viewed as being too confrontational and even counter-productive to the mainstream conservation organizations' efforts to lobby governments to take legislative and enforcement action against whaling and other marine crimes.  Paul Watson and his organization are, however, of the opinion that since governments are not stepping up to take legal action to stop illegal marine activities that NGOs have the option to do that.The Sea Shepherds use a U.N. mandate and International Whaling Commission total ban on commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary (the waters off of Antarctica) to justify using non-lethal and non-injurious methods to harass and interdict the efforts of the Japanese Whaling fleet to whale in those waters.  At the same time, the position of the Japanese government is that they are carrying out legal lethal whale research, and that they are therefore not conducting commercial whaling.  The stipulation of the lethal whaling regulations are such that all parts of any whale that is killed for research must be used.  The Japanese fleet therefore allegedly takes scientific measurements on the allowed number of Minke and Finback whales they capture each season.  The Japanese fleet includes a factory ship where whales are processed and packages for shipment back to Japan.This whaling is officially carried out by the ""Institute of Cetacean Research"" which, though an organization independent of the Japanese government, receives millions of dollars of subsidies from that government each year to carry out whaling.  it is this connection between the institute and the Japanese government that leads many governments to view Japanese ""research whaling"" to be little more than thinly disguised commercial whaling.If the Japanese fleet (including a factory ship, three harpoon chase ships, and tanker/supply ships) were unharrassed they would be able to harpoon and kill nearly 1000 Minke and Finback whales each season.  Of course, the Japanese assert that they are not engaging in commercial whaling, but as many whale products as possible, including whale meat, is sold on the open market.  it is estimated that each whale may yield a minimum of $150,000/whale, and perhaps as much as $500,000 or more apiece.  During seasons when the Sea Shepherds were taking action against the Japanese fleet, they were able to slow whaling activities enough that by the end of the season the Japanese fleet was able to capture and kill only about 1/2 of the just under 1000 whales allowable under the scientific whaling quota.  So they are making a significant difference in that regard.That's the stand-off.  Sea Shepherds are willing to put themselves at personal risk to stop whaling, with their own interpretation of the law that legalizes their actions, while the Japanese use their interpretation of the law to justify whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.  And so the stage is set.Regardless of your personal position on whaling, you have to be intrigued by this war that takes place in the southern ocean each season, and is the focus of this video series.I found this series to be fascinating.  While I am not generally an advocate of this kind of direct action, I am in complete sympathy with the basic idea that research involving lethal capture (harpooning) is no longer necessary, and is, in my personal opinion, a practice whose day is done.FYI - my professional background is in marine biology, and I have spent my career teaching at college and university levels, with teaching assignments including environmental studies, marine biology, field marine ecology, and related courses, so I'm not completely in the dark on this issue.I highly recommend taking a look at this series.  Like I said, it was fascinating, and I look forward to watching Season 2!5 stars for being  a timely topic.  It is, after all, time to leave the whales alone.If you enjoy this series you will also enjoy the documentaryThe Cove.I hope this was helpful.",5,Sea shepherds...heros or renegade

This intimate series shows their heroism as well as their humanity. It is David versus Goliath against the well-funded Japanese killing machine. I can't believe anybody has the gall to criticize their efforts. The Japanese whaling industry has no credibility. They call their killing ""research"", but all they do in this research is weigh and measure the poor beast before slicing it up into steaks bound for high-end Japanese restaurants. Each whale is worth up to a million dollars in Japan. They fire these exploding harpoons into the whales and the things explode inside of them - not very ""humane"" killing in my mind. These whalers kill every whale they can find; that's been the way of the whaling industry all along. They used to go after only the biggest whales, the Fins and the Blues, leaving the much smaller Minke whales alone. But by now all the big ones are mostly gone, so NOW they are happily harpooning the little Minkes. And when they are all gone that will be it. So kudos to Sea Shepherd for at least trying to stop them before it's too late.",5,"Sea Shepherd In Action - Real, Great Video Drama",1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,1225,"['series', 'great', 'Sea', 'Shepherd', 'volunteers', 'action', 'only', 'people', 'world', 'fighting', 'stop', 'Japanese', 'whale', 'killers', 'cold', 'Antarctic', 'seas', 'intimate', 'series', 'heroism', 'as', 'well', 'humanity', 'David', 'versus', 'Goliath', 'well-funded', 'Japanese', 'killing', 'machine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anybody', 'gall', 'criticize', 'efforts', 'Japanese', 'whaling', 'industry', 'credibility', 'call', 'killing', 'research', 'do', 'research', 'weigh', 'measure', 'poor', 'beast', 'slicing', 'up', 'steaks', 'bound', 'high-end', 'Japanese', 'restaurants', 'whale', 'worth', 'up', 'million', 'dollars', 'Japan', 'fire', 'exploding', 'harpoons', 'whales', 'things', 'explode', 'not', 'very', 'humane', 'killing', 'mind', 'whalers', 'kill', 'whale', 'can', 'find', 'been', 'way', 'whaling', 'industry', 'along', 'used', 'go', 'only', 'biggest', 'whales', 'Fins', 'Blues', 'leaving', 'much', 'smaller', 'Minke', 'whales', 'alone', 'now', 'big', 'ones', 'are', 'mostly', 'gone', 'so', 'NOW', 'are', 'happily', 'harpooning', 'little', 'Minkes', 'when', 'are', 'gone', 'will', 'be', 'So', 'kudos', 'Sea', 'Shepherd', 'least', 'trying', 'stop', 'too', 'late']",Whale Wars: Season 1

I was initially interested, but ultimately disappointed and a little surprised. There's a good documentary to be made about what is going on in the southern oceans, but this isn't it.I have heard how the Sea Shepherds are supposed to be masters of public relations, but they did not come across that way to me. I don't think the crew would last five minutes with Captain Phil on Deadliest Catch. I saw a lot of poor organization, a lack of leadership, and a startling amount of inept seamanship. One attempt to launch two boats to pursue a factory ship involved delays and confusion in launching the boats, a failure to follow basic communication protocol, a broken thumb, a broken pelvis, and, in the end, a failure to intercept the whalers.This is the Sea Shepherd's show, so self-promotion and spinning the story figure big in this series. I expected that. But I was again surprised to see it carried as far as an obviously faked shooting incident in the season finale. (It was about as believable as the word ""Research"" painted on the side of the factory whaling ship.)Animal Planet makes a token attempt to be impartial in the midst of all this, by briefly presenting the Japanese whaler's version of events. But I felt no sympathy for either side and in the end just felt sorry for the whales.",3,poor coverage of an important issue,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,1358,"['caught', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Whale', 'Wars', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'was', 'initially', 'interested', 'ultimately', 'disappointed', 'little', 'surprised', 'good', 'documentary', 'be', 'made', 'what', 'going', 'southern', 'oceans', ""n't"", 'it.I', 'have', 'heard', 'how', 'Sea', 'Shepherds', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'masters', 'public', 'relations', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'crew', 'would', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'Captain', 'Phil', 'Deadliest', 'Catch', 'saw', 'lot', 'poor', 'organization', 'lack', 'leadership', 'startling', 'amount', 'inept', 'seamanship', 'One', 'attempt', 'launch', 'two', 'boats', 'pursue', 'factory', 'ship', 'involved', 'delays', 'confusion', 'launching', 'boats', 'failure', 'follow', 'basic', 'communication', 'protocol', 'broken', 'thumb', 'broken', 'pelvis', 'end', 'failure', 'intercept', 'whalers.This', 'Sea', 'Shepherd', 'show', 'self-promotion', 'spinning', 'story', 'figure', 'big', 'series', 'expected', 'was', 'again', 'surprised', 'see', 'carried', 'as', 'far', 'obviously', 'faked', 'shooting', 'incident', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'believable', 'word', 'Research', 'painted', 'side', 'factory', 'whaling', 'ship', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'token', 'attempt', 'be', 'impartial', 'midst', 'briefly', 'presenting', 'Japanese', 'whaler', 'version', 'events', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'side', 'end', 'just', 'felt', 'sorry', 'whales']",Whale Wars: Season 1
1208038,A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ,B001KKU9C8,"Iron Man ""JON""","[26, 30]","After seeing the pilot episode on Animal Planet, I became more aware, educated and sympathetic to the plight of whales. These magnificent creatures--solemn, intelligent, peaceful and the largest mammals on earth--are vital links to the ecosystem of the seas and the oceans. They are creatures which mesmerizes the sight and stirs the imagination. History has shown us that these creatures were mercilessly hunted towards the brink extinction. It is only in recent times where laws were enacted to save the whales from forever vanishing in our Earth. Unfortunately, some countries like Japan, continue to ignore this moratorium on hunting Whales. Once you see this documentary, you will feel sick to your gut on how the whales are hunted and slaughtered in the guise of research! The Japanese has an armada of highly sophisticated, high-tech ships all dedicated to fine-tune the machinery of hunting whales.Enter the Sea Shepherd, a conservation organization headed by its founder Paul Watson, dedicated and devoted not just to the conservation and protection of whales but all other marine animals as well. The Sea Shepherd is fighting a conservation war when no other country dares to do the fighting.  This organization has been branded as pirates and terrorist. But to people who see the full extent of the unimaginable horrors of whaling, they are warriors, fighting a crusade to protect  and conserve the existence of whales.In this documentary, we will see the Ship M/V Steve Irwin, the flagship of the Sea Shepherd, named after the famous Australian Naturalist who died doing what he loves best--protecting and conserving animals of every kind. We will see the crew, several dedicated and unselfish individuals, volunteering from different countries who all have one goal in common and that is to preserve the animals that nature has given us. We will witness the effort of the Steve Irwin's crew exactly as they are unfolding, no holds barred , uncensored effort as they weave their way thru the Antartic Ocean, locating the Japanese vessels and disrupting their whaling activities. We will see the crew use several ""non-lethal"" methods of disruption--throwing stink bombs to make the decks unworkable because of the nauseating smell, laying down ropes that will disable a ship's propeller thereby making them immobile at sea and just plain low-down psychological talk on the communication systems.Although the approach of the Sea Shepherd to conservation seems unconventional, its founder Paul Watson deems it necessary. The unorthodox methods that they are employing seems to be the only one working right now to stop the massacre of whales. He constantly argues that whaling countries do not listen to diplomacy and often ignore enacted laws to these endangered animals. He always backs his claims with UN-sanctioned documentation.This is a very enlightening documentary that hit the cable TV recently that has roused my awareness in the highest levels. The world is now focusing on sustainable living. We must not discount protection and conservation in these endeavors. I highly recommend this documentary and I am pre-ordering it thru Amazon.",5,A WAR WORTH FIGHTING FOR!!,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,3156,"['seeing', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'became', 'more', 'aware', 'educated', 'sympathetic', 'plight', 'whales', 'magnificent', 'creatures', 'solemn', 'intelligent', 'peaceful', 'largest', 'mammals', 'earth', 'are', 'vital', 'links', 'ecosystem', 'seas', 'oceans', 'are', 'creatures', 'mesmerizes', 'sight', 'imagination', 'History', 'shown', 'creatures', 'were', 'mercilessly', 'hunted', 'brink', 'extinction', 'only', 'recent', 'times', 'where', 'laws', 'were', 'enacted', 'save', 'whales', 'forever', 'vanishing', 'Earth', 'Unfortunately', 'countries', 'Japan', 'continue', 'ignore', 'moratorium', 'hunting', 'Whales', 'Once', 'see', 'documentary', 'will', 'feel', 'sick', 'gut', 'how', 'whales', 'are', 'hunted', 'slaughtered', 'guise', 'research', 'Japanese', 'armada', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'high-tech', 'ships', 'dedicated', 'fine-tune', 'machinery', 'hunting', 'whales.Enter', 'Sea', 'Shepherd', 'conservation', 'organization', 'headed', 'founder', 'Paul', 'Watson', 'dedicated', 'devoted', 'not', 'just', 'conservation', 'protection', 'whales', 'other', 'marine', 'animals', 'as', 'well', 'Sea', 'Shepherd', 'fighting', 'conservation', 'war', 'when', 'other', 'country', 'dares', 'do', 'fighting', 'organization', 'been', 'branded', 'pirates', 'terrorist', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'full', 'extent', 'unimaginable', 'horrors', 'whaling', 'are', 'warriors', 'fighting', 'crusade', 'protect', 'conserve', 'existence', 'whales.In', 'documentary', 'will', 'see', 'Ship', 'M/V', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'flagship', 'Sea', 'Shepherd', 'named', 'famous', 'Australian', 'Naturalist', 'who', 'died', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'protecting', 'conserving', 'animals', 'kind', 'will', 'see', 'crew', 'several', 'dedicated', 'unselfish', 'individuals', 'volunteering', 'different', 'countries', 'who', 'have', 'one', 'goal', 'common', 'preserve', 'animals', 'nature', 'given', 'will', 'witness', 'effort', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'crew', 'exactly', 'are', 'unfolding', 'barred', 'uncensored', 'effort', 'weave', 'way', 'Antartic', 'Ocean', 'locating', 'Japanese', 'vessels', 'disrupting', 'whaling', 'activities', 'will', 'see', 'crew', 'use', 'several', 'non-lethal', 'methods', 'disruption', 'throwing', 'stink', 'bombs', 'make', 'decks', 'unworkable', 'nauseating', 'smell', 'laying', 'down', 'ropes', 'will', 'disable', 'ship', 'propeller', 'thereby', 'making', 'immobile', 'sea', 'just', 'plain', 'low-down', 'psychological', 'talk', 'communication', 'approach', 'Sea', 'Shepherd', 'conservation', 'unconventional', 'founder', 'Paul', 'Watson', 'necessary', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'are', 'employing', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'working', 'right', 'now', 'stop', 'massacre', 'whales', 'constantly', 'whaling', 'countries', 'do', 'not', 'listen', 'diplomacy', 'often', 'ignore', 'enacted', 'laws', 'endangered', 'animals', 'always', 'claims', 'UN-sanctioned', 'documentation.This', 'very', 'enlightening', 'documentary', 'hit', 'cable', 'TV', 'recently', 'roused', 'awareness', 'highest', 'levels', 'world', 'now', 'focusing', 'sustainable', 'living', 'must', 'not', 'discount', 'protection', 'conservation', 'endeavors', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'am', 'pre-ordering', 'thru', 'Amazon']",Whale Wars: Season 1

Seems that Watson was too devoted to direct action in order to save marine creatures.Well, on behalf of all the sea creatures saved from exploitation by Watson and his antics, thank you Captain Watson.Whale Wars is one attempt to give viewers a taste of these efforts during one ""whaling season.""  technically, there is no whaling, but a loophole in an international whaling treaty allows for whales to be killed for ""research,"" and that same loophole then requires all parts of the whales to be utilized.  The whale flesh ends up for sale in markets in Japan... hundreds and hundreds of whales, mostly minke whales, as I remember.Whale Wars is admittedly one-sided.  You won't really hear from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's critics (there is a brief comment from Greenpeace).  You really won't hear much from Japan (this separates it from, say,The Cove, which allows all sides to make their point without extinguishing the passions and hiding the actions of the marine mammal advocates).It's not all fun and games.  Yes, the Animal Planet exaggerates the drama like viewers expect in shows such asIce Road TruckersandDeadliest Catch.  But you see the human tension, the boredom, the danger, the injuries, the action, and the disappointments.From what was presented, it is hard for me to agree with the crew of the Steve Irwin that they saved perhaps 400-500 whales from harpooning during this season, but they certainly kept some whales from being killed.  Yay for them!The ending of this season with Watson being ""shot"" was really a let-down.  Clearly, forensic analysis of the spent bullet and the reconstruction of the ""attempted murder"" would have been very ""CSI-esque,"" and worthy of this type of show.

It wasn't until I came across Whale Wars that I was shocked to discover that it's still being practiced, unchecked and ""illegally"" in the Antarctic. Whale Wars follows the rag-tag crew of the M/V Steve Irwin(flagship of the Sea Shepherds) and her Captain Paul Watson(a founder of green peace who was kicked out do to his radical tactics)the only people dedicated enough to take action. Both sides of the conflict use loop holes in the law against each other. The whalers claim the law states that they are allowed to kill a set number of whales as long as it's for ""scientific research"". A law that they break in pretty comical ways. Japanese whaler ship simply write ""research"" on the side of their ships and hold up signs that say ""We're taking tissue samples!"" if they see that they're being videotaped. The ""Sea Shepherds"" are wise to this and take it into their own hands to stop the whaling in protected whale mating waters. It's one of those tricky things we're both sides are wrong and right at the same time. The show grabs your attention on the first episode when one of the launch boats breaks off a crane and nearly kills four of the crew. The show continues to keep its pace as we see the crew deal with faulty equipment,ice burgs, kidnapping, poor judgment and of course, the wrath of the whalers that they tick off. Whale Wars is a very fascinating show that sheds light on a subject that not many people are unaware of. Though their methods continue to be controversial, The Sea Shepherds strictly use non lethal methods and are non violent. I don't consider myself an environmentalist but by watching this show I can't help but have great respect for the Sea Shepherds. It's nice to see a group of people take action when lazy diplomacy fails, to have them act as a buffer against unchecked consumption and greed. I can't wait to follow the Steve Irwin crew on their upcoming adventures or more precisely, what the new volunteers are going to mess up. Whale Wars is a very enjoyable show and I'm sure Paul Watson and crew will find new and imaginative ways to give the whalers headaches as the show goes on.
