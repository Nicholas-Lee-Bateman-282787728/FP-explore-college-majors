857765,A358XP3X4U0X45,B00062WUVY,bookloversfriend,"[4, 10]","This movie appears to have everything: good story, important theme, popular stars; and already it is out of print again.  Why?The characters with one exception are appealing, and the casting with one exception is excellent.  Melissa and Tim are stars you like and root for.  Tim's character is caught in a quandary between loyalty to his company and loyalty to his new-found love, Melissa.  There appears to be no way to resolve this irreconcilable conflict.  The ending is smashing.So, what is it?  This is the third incarnation of this movie and already it is out of print again.  Why?The answer is obvious to most people.  Here we have a story set in a small town in Nebraska, about ordinary farm people who have lived there all their lives.  So, how did this woman farmer have a kid with a strong California accent and diction out of the Bronx and not a hint of Midwest about her?  On top of that, this child is repugnant.  It isn't merely her fish-face, but her manner.Top that off with the chorus that sings deliberately way out of tune and out of sync, and this kid is leading them.  It is grating, and it is a bad idea.  People can drag it and sing without spirit when they're depressed, and then with more spirit at the end, but they don't sing out of tune and then suddenly become musicians.The screenwriter and executive producer, Darrah Cloud, has to bear the responsibility.  She put up the money to have her screenplay produced.  She could have prevented this atrocity of casting, but didn't.  Why?Bottom line: see it anyway, but keep your remote handy ready to hit the Fast Forward button.",4,Why does this movie keep going out of print?,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,1604,"['movie', 'have', 'everything', 'good', 'story', 'important', 'theme', 'popular', 'stars', 'already', 'print', 'again', 'Why', 'characters', 'one', 'exception', 'are', 'appealing', 'casting', 'one', 'exception', 'excellent', 'Melissa', 'Tim', 'are', 'root', 'Tim', 'character', 'caught', 'quandary', 'loyalty', 'company', 'loyalty', 'new-found', 'love', 'Melissa', 'be', 'way', 'resolve', 'irreconcilable', 'conflict', 'ending', 'smashing.So', 'what', 'third', 'incarnation', 'movie', 'already', 'print', 'again', 'Why', 'answer', 'obvious', 'most', 'people', 'Here', 'have', 'story', 'set', 'small', 'town', 'Nebraska', 'ordinary', 'farm', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'lives', 'So', 'how', 'did', 'woman', 'farmer', 'have', 'kid', 'strong', 'California', 'accent', 'diction', 'Bronx', 'not', 'hint', 'Midwest', 'top', 'child', 'repugnant', ""n't"", 'merely', 'fish-face', 'manner.Top', 'off', 'chorus', 'deliberately', 'way', 'tune', 'sync', 'kid', 'leading', 'grating', 'bad', 'idea', 'People', 'can', 'drag', 'sing', 'spirit', 'when', ""'re"", 'depressed', 'then', 'more', 'spirit', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'sing', 'tune', 'then', 'suddenly', 'become', 'musicians.The', 'screenwriter', 'executive', 'producer', 'Darrah', 'Cloud', 'bear', 'responsibility', 'put', 'up', 'money', 'have', 'screenplay', 'produced', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'atrocity', 'casting', 'did', ""n't"", 'Why', 'Bottom', 'line', 'see', 'anyway', 'keep', 'remote', 'handy', 'ready', 'hit', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'button']",A Holiday for Love

Yes, yes it's mushy with the predictable ending, but it's well acted with a great fun and romantic script, some good country music by Travis Tritt who also acts, and there's plenty of snow and small town folksiness.I love Melissa Gilbert(Emma) and Tim Matheson(Jake), they're super in this, but I think the real star is the young actor who plays the daughter(Michelle Trachtenberg).  She steals the show!Plotline: Big city corporate tractor company must downsize.  They send out spies to their factories to determine who will be cut.  Jake is forced to return to his hometown in Athens, Nebraska to do the dirty work.  On the way, a blizzard hits and strands him to the mercies of single mom, Emma, and her daughter at their home.  Love blossoms, but there are problems.  Emma's engaged to the sheriff(Tritt) and of course, also works with her family and the rest of the town at the much needed tractor factory.There's lots of romance, conflict, endearing characters and comedy.  Plus, some gentle mysteries.  Who's stealing all the Christmas angels, and whatever happen to Jake's family?We love this kind of innocent, candy cane stuff.
