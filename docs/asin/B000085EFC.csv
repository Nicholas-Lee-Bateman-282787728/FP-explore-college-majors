734058,A17CKF3I5SQMCQ,B000085EFC,,"[8, 8]","I've had this program for about 3 weeks and have used it twice a week.  The Intermediate and Intermediate/Advanced routines are challenging and I am definitely feeling my ""powerhouse"" working! Pilates matwork works muscle groups that my other workouts don't, and I feel like it will help to stretch out and add flexibility to muscles that can get tight with cardio.What I really like about this Pilates program over others I've tried at home is that it has an instruction section (""introduction"") for each level where you can learn the Pilates excersices and variations for that level (how to breath, what to tighten and focus on, etc). When you're comfortable with your ability to properly perform the excersices you can start choosing from several routines at that level.  No time wasted during the actual routines to stop and demo what you need to do next.  Don't skip the intros or you may find the routines too fast or too hard or lacking instruction. Doing the intro first I found the routines to be challeging but not too fast or too hard to do.I also like that it includes routines with the Pilates arm series that uses light hand weights, and there are also routines using the ring. It keeps the variety and challenge.Even with starting at the Intermediate section, there's still lots of potential and room to grow with this DVD. I've got at least 15 workouts from 5 minutes to about 40 minutes over the Intermediate, Intermediate/Advanced and Challenging sections. It's like having your own Pilates class at home with a private instructor.

734059,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B000085EFC,CPTScott,"[9, 9]","This program ""Pilates Complete for Everyone"" by Karen Garcia (and Bodywisdom) is definitely the most versatile Pilates program out there.It has many different levels of Pilates and within each level contains many different combinations of workouts that range in length.I think if one is a total beginner that it would would be a good idea to start with something like Moira Stott's ""Stott Pilates Basics"".  Pilates is definitely a type of exercise that if you don't have the proper form you could easily strain your neck or back. Karen Garcia does show modifications on ""Pilates Complete"" so depending on the level you choose it should still be relatively safe, but a good grounding in the basics (ala ""Stott"") would still be a good idea. Stott is the best basics program that I have though I've also heard that Hilary Burnett's Beginning Pilates program is great as well.I don't currently have Hilary Burnetts Beginning program, but love her Intermediate DVD and plan on getting her Beginning program for ""light days"". Hilary Burnett is a fabulous teacher and her Intermediate program is my overall favorite single Pilates program!A few more things I'd like to mention about ""Pilates Complete""""It does tend to move a bit fast so I would recommend not worrying about keeping up at the expense of good form. I often do less repetitions than she does in order to maintain my powerhouse.Also, if you're looking for a teacher with warmth and personality this program may come across as mechanical. It is made up of a whole bunch of presequenced pieces which are then put together depending on which practice you choose. So this doesn't flow like a class the way Hilary Burnett's Intermediate or the Stott Programs do. I just wanted to mention this because this style of program may not be for everyone.All that being said, if you want a single DVD that will give you a seemingly endless amount of Pilates practices then this is well worth the purchase price. Karen Garcia, by the way, does a beautiful job of demonstrating the exercises.I use this program several times a week in addition to my daily Yoga practice and alternate it with my other Pilates programs by Stott, Burnett, Dozois, Caban, Saffell and others.",5,Unbelievably Versatile Pilates DVD!,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,2212,"['program', 'Complete', 'Everyone', 'Karen', 'Garcia', 'Bodywisdom', 'definitely', 'most', 'versatile', 'Pilates', 'program', 'out', 'there.It', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'Pilates', 'level', 'many', 'different', 'combinations', 'workouts', 'range', 'length.I', 'think', 'one', 'total', 'beginner', 'would', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'start', 'something', 'Moira', 'Stott', 'Stott', 'Pilates', 'Basics', 'Pilates', 'definitely', 'type', 'exercise', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'proper', 'form', 'could', 'easily', 'strain', 'neck', 'back', 'Karen', 'Garcia', 'show', 'modifications', 'Pilates', 'Complete', 'so', 'depending', 'level', 'choose', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'relatively', 'safe', 'good', 'grounding', 'basics', 'Stott', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'Stott', 'best', 'basics', 'program', 'have', ""'ve"", 'also', 'heard', 'Hilary', 'Burnett', 'Beginning', 'Pilates', 'program', 'great', 'well.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'currently', 'have', 'Hilary', 'Burnetts', 'Beginning', 'program', 'Intermediate', 'DVD', 'plan', 'getting', 'Beginning', 'program', 'light', 'days', 'Hilary', 'Burnett', 'fabulous', 'teacher', 'Intermediate', 'program', 'overall', 'favorite', 'single', 'Pilates', 'program', 'few', 'more', 'things', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'Pilates', 'Complete', 'tend', 'move', 'bit', 'fast', 'would', 'recommend', 'not', 'worrying', 'keeping', 'up', 'expense', 'good', 'form', 'often', 'do', 'less', 'repetitions', 'order', 'maintain', 'powerhouse.Also', ""'re"", 'looking', 'teacher', 'warmth', 'personality', 'program', 'may', 'come', 'mechanical', 'made', 'whole', 'bunch', 'presequenced', 'pieces', 'are', 'then', 'put', 'together', 'depending', 'practice', 'choose', 'So', ""n't"", 'flow', 'class', 'way', 'Hilary', 'Burnett', 'Intermediate', 'Stott', 'Programs', 'do', 'just', 'wanted', 'mention', 'style', 'program', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone.All', 'being', 'said', 'want', 'single', 'DVD', 'will', 'give', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'amount', 'Pilates', 'practices', 'then', 'well', 'purchase', 'price', 'Karen', 'Garcia', 'way', 'beautiful', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'exercises.I', 'use', 'program', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'addition', 'daily', 'Yoga', 'practice', 'alternate', 'other', 'Pilates', 'programs', 'Stott', 'Burnett', 'Dozois', 'Caban', 'Saffell', 'others']",N/A
734060,A1GLT8WEEWZTN1,B000085EFC,"Debbie the Book Devourer ""dletour7""","[13, 19]","This DVD claims to contain several different routines within each difficulty level, for a total of something like 35 routines.  Sounds great!  If only it were really true...The good:* Ms Garcia has a clear, plain voice and explains form pretty well.* The routines are of varying length, so you can pick one that will fit your schedule.The bad:* She doesn't cue breathing much -- when you should inhale and exhale.  This is very important in Pilates, and her lack in this area made some of the exercises unpleasant for me, as I couldn't remember proper breathing.* The routines really aren't all that varied; I had a hard time distinguishing among some of the ten-minute routines in the intermediate section.* In some cases, I think she does a different number of reps on each side.  And I did find that in the introduction of the intermediate section, she did only one side of leg kicks, which to me just seemed lazy.* It seemed to me that she did a lower number of reps of each exercise in order to cram more exercises into a routine.* I found most of the routines I tried, especially the shorter ones (all in the intermediate section), to be overly biased toward abdominal exercises.  Sure, everyone wants ripped abs, but that's not what Pilates is about.  It's about developing balanced strength among all the core muscles (abs, back, buttocks, and, to some extent, arm and leg muscles), and it's also about mobility and flexibility.  If this were your only Pilates DVD, you'd be pretty unbalanced.I did explore only the intermediate section, so I don't really know how the other sections are.  I guess I'd have to say I found more bad than good with this DVD.  Still, it's better than the Denise Austin ""Pilates"" video I reviewed earlier, so it gets 3 stars.  If you like the idea of some shorter routines once in a while, it'd be OK to use this DVD to supplement your regular practice.Other Pilates-type workouts I like much better are Stott Pilates (Essential Matwork for beginners; Intermediate Matwork for, well, intermediate students), and Yogilates (combination of yoga and Pilates; both the beginning and intermediate DVDs are fantastic).",3,Good and bad,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,2149,"['DVD', 'contain', 'several', 'different', 'routines', 'difficulty', 'level', 'total', 'something', '35', 'routines', 'great', 'only', 'were', 'really', 'true', 'good', '*', 'Ms', 'Garcia', 'clear', 'plain', 'voice', 'form', 'pretty', 'well', '*', 'routines', 'are', 'varying', 'length', 'can', 'pick', 'one', 'will', 'fit', 'schedule.The', 'bad', '*', ""n't"", 'cue', 'breathing', 'much', 'when', 'should', 'inhale', 'exhale', 'very', 'important', 'Pilates', 'lack', 'area', 'made', 'exercises', 'unpleasant', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'proper', 'breathing', '*', 'routines', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'varied', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'distinguishing', 'ten-minute', 'routines', 'intermediate', 'section', '*', 'cases', 'think', 'different', 'number', 'reps', 'side', 'did', 'find', 'introduction', 'intermediate', 'section', 'did', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'leg', 'kicks', 'just', 'seemed', 'lazy', '*', 'seemed', 'did', 'lower', 'number', 'reps', 'exercise', 'order', 'cram', 'more', 'exercises', 'routine', '*', 'found', 'most', 'routines', 'tried', 'especially', 'shorter', 'ones', 'intermediate', 'section', 'be', 'overly', 'biased', 'abdominal', 'exercises', 'Sure', 'everyone', 'ripped', 'abs', 'not', 'what', 'about', 'developing', 'balanced', 'strength', 'core', 'muscles', 'abs', 'back', 'buttocks', 'extent', 'arm', 'leg', 'muscles', 'also', 'mobility', 'flexibility', 'were', 'only', 'Pilates', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'be', 'pretty', 'unbalanced.I', 'did', 'explore', 'only', 'intermediate', 'section', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'other', 'sections', 'are', 'guess', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'found', 'more', 'bad', 'good', 'DVD', 'Still', 'better', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'Pilates', 'video', 'reviewed', 'earlier', '3', 'stars', 'like', 'idea', 'shorter', 'routines', 'once', 'while', ""'d"", 'be', 'OK', 'use', 'DVD', 'supplement', 'regular', 'practice.Other', 'Pilates-type', 'like', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'Stott', 'Pilates', 'Essential', 'Matwork', 'beginners', 'Intermediate', 'Matwork', 'well', 'intermediate', 'students', 'Yogilates', 'combination', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'beginning', 'intermediate', 'DVDs', 'are', 'fantastic']",N/A

Van Court ""Van""","[15, 16]","The various factions of the Pilates community can argue the merits and shortcomings of ...'s ""Pilates Complete For Everyone"" forever without coming to agreement.  This having been said, I believe that ... follows both the letter and the intent of Joseph Pilates method well, without significant injection of practices from other fitness systems.  Throughout the program on this DVD, all exercises are explained clearly and shown from several angles for greater clarity.  Overall, this video delivers clear and consise instruction on the Pilates Method with well structured and varied workout routines.As an instructional video, this one is without equal.  This video is the gold standard for formating instructional videos.There is an overall introduction with all the usual counter-litigation caveats as well as a discussion of the basic concepts.  After that, it is broken into several skill or ability levels.  Each ability level also has an introduction to explain the requirements for that level, careful descriptions of the exercises, and indications that one might not be ready for that level.  Then each level has several workouts (each clearly marked with the time required) for different objectives, blocks of time availible, and to add variety to one's workout.  Taken in sequence, the workouts provide a gradual but steady increase in degree of challenge while providing enough variety to maintain interest and not moving so quickly as to discourage the novice.

734062,A1SMM7J9VVS6VM,B000085EFC,Glenn,"[5, 8]","I bought this DVD because I was looking for Advanced level routines.  When you read the outside of the DVD you get the impression that there will be 20 ""different"" routines.  As other reviewers have noted, what you get are routines made up of bits and pieces, so when you play a full or an extended version--in other words, a session--it is cut and paste.  The film stops, goes to black, searches to find the next portion and then you're back in business. This totally ruins the flow.  Many of these ""blackouts"" come as you are building momentum, and not, for example, when you'd appreciate a moment to rest your neck. This gets worse the higher the level you play as the earlier pieces from the beginner, then the intermediate get inserted into the more advanced routines.The instructor is very good and certainly thorough overall, although she does not talk much about breathing, which is vital in Pilates. (In the advanced movements, I can't recall her talking about breathing at all.)  Her voice, which has annoyed some people, is just precise--I think she was going for a good, clear voiceover, although, when she does her 1-2-3-4 thing on The Hundred, she suddenly becomes overly cheerleadery--it is abrasive. But I could tune that out.  In the intro sections, the movements of each level are carefully explained. She does some nice things with hand weights. There's a lot of information here carefully laid out. Do wish there was more about proper breathing though.BOTTOM LINE:  I could not get past the choppity chop-chop-chop blackouts in the full routines:  That's no way to do Pilates.  And it is really too bad, because a lot is really good about this DVD. If you want to see the different movements, or if you are all right with your routine just stopping every movement or three, then this might be all right for you. Just be forewarned:  What people are saying in these reviews is true.  It sure would be great if the producers would go back and fix this DVD so that the full routines would play straight out.
