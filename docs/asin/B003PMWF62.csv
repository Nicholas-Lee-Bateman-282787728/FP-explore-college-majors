It was one of the worst atrocities during the World War II era, in less than six weeks over 300,000 people were murdered.This film, however, is accurate with what one expects of a movie. It tells the story of John Rabe, who was the appointed leader. He was picked partly because being a German Nazi it was hoped that he would have some influence over the Japanese because of the Japanese German treaty. These few westerns managed to use their little influence to save as many as they could, they saved at least 200,000. It does show what some people with minor influence can sometimes do in a crisis. What did disappoint me a bit, is that the Westerns did not just stay in the neutral zone but left and so saved many people outside the zone! Often just a Westerns appearance would stop a rape or murder. I wonder why this was written out of the movie?I thought the acting was reasonable.

Lively,"[25, 28]","I understand that but what I don't understand is why a woman named Minnie Vautrin, an American and director of the Ginling Women's Arts and Sciences College in Nanking, whose behavior was every bit as intelligent, courageous and selfless as John Rabe's during Nanking's horrific Japanese invasion, has been replaced by a fictitious Frenchwoman, who aside from foolishly endangering the whole Nanking safety zone, also has an unrequited crush on Mr. Rabe.  Why?  This is not just a minor quibble of historical accuracy.  One of the reviews here shows that this movie leaves the impression that ""Valerie Dupres"" was real.Minnie Vautrin was known by the Chinese as ""The Living Goddess of Nanking,"" and with good reason. I am baffled by the movie makers' decision to elide this extraordinary woman from the record altogether.This is not a bad movie but for the real story please read Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking.

1356959,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003PMWF62,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","'To the F&uuml;hrer of the German people. Chancellor Adolf Hitler. My F&uuml;hrer. As a loyal party member and upstanding German. I turn to you in a time of great need. The Japanese Imperial troops conquered the city of Nanking on December 12, 1937. Since then I have witnessed atrocious crimes against civilians. Please help to end this catastrophe and make an appeal to our Japanese allies in the name of humanity. With a German salute, John Rabe '  This is an actual letter, unheeded, that along with the diaries of John Rabe provide the story for this deeply moving film about the Japanese destruction of Nanking as gathered in the book ""John Rabe: Der Gute Deutsche von Nanking"" edited by Erwin Wickert and adapted for the screen and directed by the immensely gifted Florian Gallenberger.  Having just seen  Chuan Lu's  'City of Life and Death', a brilliant black and white Chinese epic film about this same period of history, it is doubly troubling to view this shameful piece of history.  JOHN RABE is after all a biography of the man the Chinese still regard as a saint for providing shelter of thousands of victims of the rape of Nanking and as such we learn much more about the German machinations in the event than in Chuan's film. Burt there is a similarity of distinction: in both films the writer/director shows that both sides of the atrocity had heroes and champions.The film shares the writing of the diary kept by John Rabe during this time frame and follows his diary as the story line.  Rabe (Ulrich Tukur in a brilliant performance) was living with his wife Dora (Dagmar Manzell) in Nanking for 27 years as the head of the Siemens Factory, a German resource for construction in China.  They were loyal to Germany, were members of the Nazi party, but lived the good life in the city: Rabe was a compassionate but focused director of the Chinese employees. He is to be retired by the Germans and replaced by a rigid, seemingly evil Werner Fliess (Mathias Herrmann). On the night of his tender farewell party the Japanese attack and it soon becomes apparent that Prince Asaka Yasuhiko (Teruyuki Kagawa)plans to decimate the city.  There are others from other nations who are working Nanking - in the university, Val&eacute;rie Dupres (Anne Consigny), in the hospital, Dr. Robert Wilson (Steve Buscemi), and in the German Embassy, the Jewish lawyer Dr. Georg Rosen (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) - as well as Chinese aligned with Rabe, Langshu (Jingchu Zhang).  When it becomes obvious that the Japanese will slaughter all the populace of the city, John Rabe gathers as many Chinese as he can into a Safety Zone where no soldiers or weapons are allowed, only the support with food and medical attention and beneficence Rabe is able to gather.  The atrocities and bombings continue until the very existence of the Safety Zone is vulnerable.  Rabe's gathering of the forces around him to protect as many citizens as he can, despite his own gradual physical failure due to his diabetes and lack of insulin, gains him the respect and admiration and love of the people of Nanking.The film spares no images of the mass executions, the beheadings,  and the sexual abuse and torture of the people of Nanking by the Japanese.  Much of the film is difficult to watch.  But even more tragic is the discovery of the information after the film is complete that John Rabe (as well as Dr. Georg Rosen) returned to Germany as undesirables in 1938 and died in poverty and abandonment by the Germans.  The cast is exemplary: many fine cameo roles played by fine actors make this film as touching than the main story.  This is a very fine cinematic achievement and deserves a global audience.

1356963,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B003PMWF62,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[32, 32]","I had to buy a copy of this one after renting it (on the suggestion of an avid customer who'd seen it). There were only two copies available and the DVD had been watched so many times that it kept pausing or jumping ahead, skipping over crucial parts. However, I was hooked by the parts I could see and was eager to watch it again when I got my brand new copy.  I wasn't disappointed and have since raved about this film, urging people to see it. As portrayed in the movie, John Rabe comes across as a man, part of the Nazi regime, who had flaws but also showed extreme courage when trying to provide a safe zone for the Nanjing Chinese. He tried to protect those that he could, attempting to lessen the mass slaughter taking place in 1937 and 1938. Historians know all too well about the hundreds of thousands of Chinese who were killed, often in the most gruesome ways imaginable, during this time period. Even though Rabe was a Nazi, you'll likely find him very sympathetic and he definitely comes across as having strong ethics and morals. He even confronts fellow Nazis who are far more cold-hearted that Rabe. He sends a written appeal to Hitler to stop the killings.He cares about the Chinese and won't sacrifice his passion to the requirements of duties as a Nazi.One warning: if you can't handle graphic details, this film may not be for you. The violence against the Chinese is shown in detail in many sections and is definitely painful to watch when at its strongest (but historically accurate from what I could find in later research).  This film is so inspiring and well done that I'd urge potential viewers to add it to a permanent collection of outstanding historical movies. It was released in only small numbers, based on the copies I could find online and off, so you should grab it while you can. It fills in many details about John Rabe, a man who was in charge of the Siemans Factory and who was not prepared for the sudden influx of Japanese. He comes across as a very ordinary man faced with extraordinary circumstances and who could not turn his back on his workers. I don't want to give away any spoilers but will add that he comes up with some wise methods which he hopes will protect his workers as well as other Chinese, although not all of his actions are foolproof. There are some scenes that brought me to tears.Some of the footage is clearly taken from actual films shot during the war. The most familiar actor in the movie for Americans may be Steve Buscemi and his performance as an American doctor is very believable. He distrusts Rabe at first and the evolution of the relationship between Rabe and the doctor is just one of the very watchable parts of this movie. The fact that this is NOT one of the most well-known parts of history for the average person also makes the film well worth viewing. I've since ordered books about Rabe so I can't note whether the film is totally accurate but one of the most intriguing parts is at the end. Rabe's life after the war is described, although this section is brief. I'm looking forward to reading Rabe's diary to compare it to the film. I'll edit this review if the diaries are far from the information portrayed in the film. Even if they are, I'd still urge those interested in suspenseful action films which are based on actual historical periods to watch this. I'll be interested in any comments from those who do and can reveal how accurately the film portrays Rabe's actions and personality. At the very least, this movie ought to leave viewers wanting to learn more about John Rabe.",4,"One of the best movies about a crucial period in history, a sleeper which is riveting, suspenseful and memorable",1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,3569,"['had', 'buy', 'copy', 'one', 'renting', 'suggestion', 'avid', 'customer', 'who', ""'d"", 'seen', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'copies', 'available', 'DVD', 'had', 'been', 'watched', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'kept', 'pausing', 'jumping', 'ahead', 'skipping', 'crucial', 'parts', 'However', 'was', 'hooked', 'parts', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'again', 'when', 'got', 'brand', 'new', 'copy', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'have', 'raved', 'film', 'urging', 'people', 'see', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'John', 'Rabe', 'across', 'man', 'part', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'who', 'had', 'flaws', 'also', 'showed', 'extreme', 'courage', 'when', 'trying', 'provide', 'safe', 'zone', 'Nanjing', 'Chinese', 'tried', 'protect', 'could', 'attempting', 'lessen', 'mass', 'slaughter', 'taking', 'place', '1937', '1938', 'Historians', 'know', 'too', 'well', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Chinese', 'who', 'were', 'killed', 'often', 'most', 'gruesome', 'ways', 'imaginable', 'time', 'period', 'Even', 'Rabe', 'was', 'Nazi', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'find', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'definitely', 'across', 'having', 'strong', 'ethics', 'morals', 'even', 'fellow', 'Nazis', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'cold-hearted', 'Rabe', 'written', 'appeal', 'Hitler', 'stop', 'killings.He', 'Chinese', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sacrifice', 'passion', 'requirements', 'duties', 'Nazi.One', 'warning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'graphic', 'details', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'violence', 'Chinese', 'shown', 'detail', 'many', 'sections', 'definitely', 'painful', 'watch', 'when', 'strongest', 'historically', 'accurate', 'what', 'could', 'find', 'later', 'research', 'film', 'so', 'inspiring', 'well', 'done', ""'d"", 'urge', 'potential', 'viewers', 'add', 'permanent', 'collection', 'outstanding', 'historical', 'movies', 'was', 'released', 'only', 'small', 'numbers', 'based', 'copies', 'could', 'find', 'online', 'off', 'should', 'grab', 'can', 'many', 'details', 'John', 'Rabe', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'charge', 'Siemans', 'Factory', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'sudden', 'influx', 'Japanese', 'across', 'very', 'ordinary', 'man', 'faced', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'turn', 'back', 'workers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'will', 'add', 'up', 'wise', 'methods', 'will', 'protect', 'workers', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'Chinese', 'not', 'actions', 'are', 'foolproof', 'are', 'scenes', 'brought', 'tears.Some', 'footage', 'clearly', 'taken', 'actual', 'films', 'shot', 'war', 'most', 'familiar', 'actor', 'movie', 'Americans', 'may', 'be', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'performance', 'American', 'doctor', 'very', 'believable', 'Rabe', 'first', 'evolution', 'relationship', 'Rabe', 'doctor', 'just', 'one', 'very', 'watchable', 'parts', 'movie', 'fact', 'NOT', 'one', 'most', 'well-known', 'parts', 'history', 'average', 'person', 'also', 'film', 'well', 'viewing', ""'ve"", 'ordered', 'books', 'Rabe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'note', 'film', 'totally', 'accurate', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'parts', 'end', 'Rabe', 'life', 'war', 'described', 'section', 'brief', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'reading', 'Rabe', 'diary', 'compare', 'film', ""'ll"", 'edit', 'review', 'diaries', 'are', 'far', 'information', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Even', 'are', ""'d"", 'still', 'urge', 'interested', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'historical', 'periods', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interested', 'comments', 'who', 'do', 'can', 'reveal', 'how', 'accurately', 'film', 'Rabe', 'actions', 'personality', 'very', 'least', 'movie', 'ought', 'leave', 'viewers', 'wanting', 'learn', 'more', 'John', 'Rabe']",N/A
1356964,A2K6VDHSE2NU4R,B003PMWF62,Nachtjager,"[5, 5]","I was vaguely familiar with the story of Rabe but this movie inspired me to do a little more study on the man - and I am VERY impressed with how accurate this movie is!  I cannot say enough good things about this movie, it is superbly filmed, the sets are magnificent, the uniforms and equipment are painstakingly accurate, and the CG work with the earlier versions of the Japanese Nakajima fighters and dive bombers is extremely good, but not perfect.  The savage behavior of the Japanese at Nanking is told here, but they have dialed the gore back quite a bit from what I was expecting so that audiences will not be completely repelled by what they see.  There are some gruesome scenes, but not as many as you see in most modern war epics and the scale of the criminal behavior of the Japanese troops is a bit underplayed.This movie is impressive in almost every respect.  The acting is fantastic, the script is extremely well done, and I absolutely loved the way they did the languages in this movie.  When Rabe and his wife or German associates are alone, they speak German and there are subtitles.  When he's with others of the international community, they speak English.  The Japanese speak Japanese with subtitles, the Chinese speak Chinese with subtitles - it's historically just as it should be - I loved that!  It made you feel very much like you were just casually observing this man's life and his personal torment to decide what was most important to him - his career?  His wife?  His duty to Germany?  His responsibility to humanity?  It is a truly incredible story that is FAR MORE deserving of being told than that of Oskar Schindler.  Rabe made no profit from his humanitarian efforts, on the contrary, he bankrupted himself in the process and died a pauper.  This man's efforts saved, conservatively, 200,000 Chinese civilians, yet he is virtually unknown outside of China because he was German, and as we know, all Germans were evil in WWII.This movie is a great tribute to the man whom history has forgotten and that the allies treated so badly after the war.

1356966,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B003PMWF62,The Mysterious Traveler,"[2, 3]","CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH (2009) Directed by Lu Chuan.In July, 1937, the Imperial Japanese Empire attacked China and, byDecember of that year, had captured the city of Nanking. In an actthat would characterize Imperial Japanese behaviour as well as beingthe first great genocide of the Second World War, the Imperial Armyproceded to rape, torture and murder over 300, 000 Chinese.This Chinese film dramatizes that horrific atrocity through multiplecharacters with a special focus on the Battle of Nanking, the massacreof Chinese POWs and the mass rape of Chinese women. Filmed in blackand white, the film also features the Nazi businessman John Rabe who,by creating an International Safety Zone managed to save the lives ofapproximately 250, 000 Chinese.JOHN RABE (2009) Directed by Florian Gallenberger.Starring Ulrich Tukur (as John Rabe), Teruyuki Kagawa (as PrinceYasuhiko Asaka) and Steve Buscemi.Another film--German this time-- about the Rape of Nanking focusingprimarily on John Rabe and his efforts to save the Chinese under hiscare. In color, remarkably there is very little repetition of materialhere and both films compliment the other. Where CITY deals primarilywith ground combat between Japanese and Chinese troops, this filmfocuses on the Japanese Air force's bombardment of civilian targets.Where CITY focused primarily on the mass murder of Chinese soldiers byshooting and the mass rapes of Chinese women, this film shows thenotorious beheading contest between two Japanese officers that waseagerly covered in the Japanese papers. Where CITY mentions it not atall, this film makes much of the irony of Nazi Germany saving peoplefrom genocide. Both films feature one good Japanese officer howeverCITY stays primarily with the lower echelon officers and this filmdramatizes the actions of the Japanese Generals and member of theImperial family who brought the massacre about.Both films are extremely good and two of the best and most originalfilms about World War 2 in years. Neither is better than the other justdifferent in style and focus.Both are highly recommended if extremely depressing.After watching these two films, two thoughts came to mind.1) Those WW 2 films made during the War and condemned as racist todaywere actually pretty on the mark. These films fit in well with suchearlier similar themed films like CHINA with Alan Ladd and DRAGONSEEDwith Katherine Hepburn.2) In America, these films could not be made as Hollywood considersany film portraying Non-Whites in a villainous light to be somehowracist and thus, by doing so, the American artistic community onceagain becomes enables and apologists for genocide. It takes Chineseand German filmmakers to make such films today.I understand the Japanese are now making a movie revealing that theRape of Nanking never happened and it is all a lie by wicked Chineseand other foreigners.",4,RAPING NANKING,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,2862,"['CITY', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'AND', 'DEATH', '2009', 'Directed', 'Lu', 'Chuan.In', 'July', '1937', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'Empire', 'attacked', 'China', 'byDecember', 'year', 'had', 'captured', 'city', 'Nanking', 'actthat', 'would', 'characterize', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'behaviour', 'as', 'well', 'beingthe', 'first', 'great', 'genocide', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Imperial', 'Armyproceded', 'rape', 'torture', 'murder', '300', '000', 'Chinese.This', 'Chinese', 'film', 'horrific', 'atrocity', 'multiplecharacters', 'special', 'focus', 'Battle', 'Nanking', 'massacreof', 'Chinese', 'POWs', 'mass', 'rape', 'Chinese', 'women', 'Filmed', 'blackand', 'white', 'film', 'also', 'Nazi', 'businessman', 'John', 'Rabe', 'who', 'creating', 'International', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'managed', 'save', 'lives', 'ofapproximately', '250', '000', 'Chinese.JOHN', 'RABE', '2009', 'Directed', 'Florian', 'Gallenberger.Starring', 'Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'John', 'Rabe', 'Teruyuki', 'Kagawa', 'PrinceYasuhiko', 'Asaka', 'Steve', 'Buscemi.Another', 'film', 'German', 'time', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'focusingprimarily', 'John', 'Rabe', 'efforts', 'save', 'Chinese', 'hiscare', 'color', 'remarkably', 'very', 'little', 'repetition', 'materialhere', 'films', 'compliment', 'other', 'Where', 'CITY', 'deals', 'primarilywith', 'ground', 'combat', 'Japanese', 'Chinese', 'troops', 'Japanese', 'Air', 'force', 'bombardment', 'civilian', 'CITY', 'focused', 'primarily', 'mass', 'murder', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'byshooting', 'mass', 'rapes', 'Chinese', 'women', 'film', 'thenotorious', 'beheading', 'contest', 'two', 'Japanese', 'officers', 'waseagerly', 'covered', 'Japanese', 'papers', 'Where', 'CITY', 'mentions', 'not', 'atall', 'film', 'much', 'irony', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'saving', 'peoplefrom', 'genocide', 'films', 'feature', 'one', 'good', 'Japanese', 'officer', 'howeverCITY', 'primarily', 'lower', 'echelon', 'officers', 'actions', 'Japanese', 'Generals', 'member', 'theImperial', 'family', 'who', 'brought', 'massacre', 'films', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'two', 'best', 'most', 'originalfilms', 'World', 'War', '2', 'years', 'better', 'other', 'justdifferent', 'style', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', 'extremely', 'depressing.After', 'watching', 'two', 'films', 'two', 'thoughts', 'came', 'mind.1', '2', 'films', 'made', 'War', 'condemned', 'racist', 'actually', 'pretty', 'mark', 'films', 'fit', 'well', 'suchearlier', 'similar', 'themed', 'films', 'CHINA', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'DRAGONSEEDwith', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn.2', 'America', 'films', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'considersany', 'film', 'portraying', 'Non-Whites', 'villainous', 'light', 'be', 'somehowracist', 'thus', 'doing', 'so', 'American', 'artistic', 'community', 'onceagain', 'becomes', 'enables', 'apologists', 'genocide', 'Chineseand', 'German', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'such', 'films', 'today.I', 'understand', 'Japanese', 'are', 'now', 'making', 'movie', 'revealing', 'theRape', 'Nanking', 'never', 'happened', 'lie', 'wicked', 'Chineseand', 'other', 'foreigners']",N/A

1356969,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003PMWF62,Z Hayes,"[6, 6]","Having readThe Good German of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe, I was eager to watch this dramatization of John Rabe's role in saving hundreds of thousands of Chinese during the massacre of Nanjing by the Japanese Imperial army in 1937. Ulrich Tukur is credible as the German businessman who opts to stay and protect the Chinese civilians by setting up a Safety Zone. This safety zone protected around 200,000 Chinese civilians (historical accounts differ as to the actual number) from almost certain death during the six-week period that the Japanese troops terrorized the city and its inhabitants. This historical event has come to be known as the Nanjing Massacre (or Nanking Massacre), and is also called the Rape of Nanking because of the thousands of women and children who were brutally assaulted by Japanese soldiers during this period.The movie itself has excerpts of Rabe's diaries as the ""narrator"" of events as they unfold. Ulrich Tukur plays John Rabe and delivers a compelling and credible performance. I liked that the movie does not overly romanticize Rabe. He is portrayed as a loyal citizen of Nazi Germany, and one who initially has hopes that his Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, will step in and put a stop to Japanese atrocities in Nanjing (Japan being Germany's ally during WW II). He is disturbed when a fellow German, Dr. Georg Rosen (Daniel Bruhl) salutes ""Heil Shitler"" and reprimands him for being unpatriotic. Of course, Rosen has good reason for his act, explaining how Hitler's anti-Semitic policies have affected his family. It paints a rather naive picture of Rabe, who having spent about 27 years in China, has not realized (or perhaps, fails to see?) the danger posed by the Nazis.Anyway, the story is not about the Nazis, but about Japanese atrocities in Nanjing, and how Rabe and a few foreigners try to save the Chinese civilians by setting up a Safety Zone. There is plenty of violence, and some archival footage woven into the narrative which is quite disturbing in its depiction of brutality and victims' suffering (but not nearly as disturbing as reading true accounts of the time, and seeing the actual historical photographs). This movie also suffers from melodramatic moments, as when a young Chinese girl tries to escape wearing a Japanese soldier's uniform, and miraculously flees to safety. Such stories may have happened, but the way it is dramatized in the movie seems a tad over the top.Despite its flaws, I felt this movie was well-acted not just by Tukur (another WW II drama with Tukur isAmena compelling drama about the Holocaust), but also the supporting cast, including Anne Consigny as Valerie Dupres, the lady who ran a Girls' College in Nanjing and fought to keep her girls safe from the Japanese soldiers. There's also the American doctor (played by Steve Buscemi) who is initially cynical about Rabe's intentions, but later comes to appreciate the man (also watch out for a wonderful duet by Rabe and the doctor, singing a song about Hitler's balls!). This is a compelling, well-acted historical drama, and merits watching for those who are interested in the subject.For those who are interested in a documentary about the Nanjing Massacre, I'd recommend:NankingBooks on the subject:The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War IITerror in Minnie Vautrin's Nanjing: Diaries and Correspondence, 1937-38",4,Compelling dramatization of John Rabe's heroism during the Nanjing Massacre,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,3366,"['Having', 'readThe', 'Good', 'German', 'Nanking', 'Diaries', 'John', 'Rabe', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'dramatization', 'John', 'Rabe', 'role', 'saving', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Chinese', 'massacre', 'Nanjing', 'Japanese', 'Imperial', 'army', '1937', 'Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'credible', 'German', 'businessman', 'who', 'stay', 'protect', 'Chinese', 'civilians', 'setting', 'up', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'safety', 'zone', 'protected', '200,000', 'Chinese', 'civilians', 'historical', 'accounts', 'differ', 'actual', 'number', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'six-week', 'period', 'Japanese', 'troops', 'terrorized', 'city', 'inhabitants', 'historical', 'event', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'Nanjing', 'Massacre', 'Nanking', 'Massacre', 'also', 'called', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'thousands', 'women', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'brutally', 'assaulted', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'period.The', 'movie', 'excerpts', 'Rabe', 'diaries', 'narrator', 'events', 'unfold', 'Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'John', 'Rabe', 'compelling', 'credible', 'performance', 'liked', 'movie', 'not', 'overly', 'romanticize', 'Rabe', 'portrayed', 'loyal', 'citizen', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'one', 'who', 'initially', 'hopes', 'Fuhrer', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'will', 'step', 'put', 'stop', 'Japanese', 'atrocities', 'Nanjing', 'Japan', 'being', 'Germany', 'ally', 'WW', 'II', 'disturbed', 'when', 'fellow', 'German', 'Dr.', 'Georg', 'Rosen', 'Daniel', 'Bruhl', 'Heil', 'Shitler', 'being', 'unpatriotic', 'course', 'Rosen', 'good', 'reason', 'act', 'explaining', 'how', 'Hitler', 'anti-Semitic', 'policies', 'have', 'affected', 'family', 'rather', 'naive', 'picture', 'Rabe', 'who', 'having', 'spent', '27', 'years', 'China', 'not', 'realized', 'perhaps', 'see', 'danger', 'posed', 'Nazis.Anyway', 'story', 'not', 'Nazis', 'Japanese', 'atrocities', 'Nanjing', 'how', 'Rabe', 'few', 'foreigners', 'try', 'save', 'Chinese', 'civilians', 'setting', 'up', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'plenty', 'violence', 'archival', 'footage', 'woven', 'narrative', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'depiction', 'brutality', 'victims', 'suffering', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'disturbing', 'reading', 'true', 'accounts', 'time', 'seeing', 'actual', 'historical', 'photographs', 'movie', 'also', 'melodramatic', 'moments', 'when', 'young', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'tries', 'escape', 'wearing', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'uniform', 'miraculously', 'flees', 'safety', 'Such', 'stories', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'way', 'dramatized', 'movie', 'tad', 'top.Despite', 'flaws', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'well-acted', 'not', 'just', 'Tukur', 'WW', 'II', 'drama', 'Tukur', 'isAmena', 'compelling', 'drama', 'Holocaust', 'also', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Anne', 'Consigny', 'Valerie', 'Dupres', 'lady', 'who', 'ran', 'Girls', 'College', 'Nanjing', 'fought', 'keep', 'girls', 'safe', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'also', 'American', 'doctor', 'played', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'initially', 'cynical', 'Rabe', 'intentions', 'later', 'appreciate', 'man', 'also', 'watch', 'out', 'wonderful', 'duet', 'Rabe', 'doctor', 'singing', 'song', 'Hitler', 'balls', 'compelling', 'well-acted', 'historical', 'drama', 'merits', 'watching', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'subject.For', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'documentary', 'Nanjing', 'Massacre', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'NankingBooks', 'subject', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'Forgotten', 'Holocaust', 'World', 'War', 'IITerror', 'Minnie', 'Vautrin', 'Nanjing', 'Diaries', 'Correspondence', '1937-38']",N/A
