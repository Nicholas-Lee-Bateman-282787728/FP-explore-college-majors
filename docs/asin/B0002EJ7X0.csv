It takes a lot to make me chortle out loud, and there are portions I thought I'd choke with laughter on, like his comments on loading the dishwasher and doing the laundry. It's definitely not safe to eat while watching this !The themes are:21 years of marriage, Momma's fixin' to lose her mind, Difference in years, Kid's grow up fast, Father and son moments, Getting old, Vicodinland, Animal Planet, Love scenes and movies, Here's your sign.Bill keeps the language pretty clean, even if some of his stories take place in the bedroom, and his facial expressions are priceless.Great fun through and through, the DVD ""extra"" is a still photo ""gallery"", and total running time is 72 minutes.",5,real life humor,1095724800,"09 21, 2004",2004,1192,"['Fresh', 'hilarious', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'top-selling', 'film', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'Ron', 'White', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'stand-up', 'best', 'filmed', 'Grove', 'Theater', 'Anaheim', 'California', 'January', '23rd', '2004.All', 'Bill', 'stories', 'are', 'family', 'centered', 'very', 'real', 'what', 'so', 'funny', 'story', 'something', 'have', 'experienced', 'one', 'way', 'observed', 'seen', 'Bill', 'keen', 'perception', 'off-beat', ""'m"", 'just', 'guy', 'humor', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'lot', 'make', 'chortle', 'out', 'loud', 'are', 'portions', 'thought', ""'d"", 'choke', 'laughter', 'comments', 'loading', 'dishwasher', 'doing', 'laundry', 'definitely', 'not', 'safe', 'eat', 'watching', 'themes', 'are:21', 'years', 'marriage', 'Momma', 'fixin', 'lose', 'mind', 'Difference', 'years', 'Kid', 'grow', 'fast', 'Father', 'son', 'moments', 'Getting', 'old', 'Vicodinland', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'Love', 'scenes', 'movies', 'Here', 'sign.Bill', 'language', 'pretty', 'clean', 'even', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'bedroom', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'priceless.Great', 'fun', 'DVD', 'extra', 'still', 'gallery', 'total', 'running', 'time', '72', 'minutes']",N/A

831773,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0002EJ7X0,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[5, 5]","Fans of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour will love this Bill Engvall DVD featuring over 72 minutes of nothing but a microphone and the family-themed, side-splitting comedy of this highly successful comedian. With sales of over two million comedy albums to his credit, as well as success with various TV shows and books, Bill Engvall knows how to make people laugh. As one of four members of the highly acclaimed Blue Collar Comedy Tour, Engvall has firmly cemented himself in the comedian's hall of fame...I first saw Bill on The Tonight Show when I was ten years old. He delivered the best stand-up routine I've ever seen, and I still remember much of it word-for-word to this day... Central to the routine was his trademark tagline ""Here's your sign"" (referring to a ""stupid sign"" handed out to people who make dumb remarks). Just like his colleague Jeff Foxworthy, Engvall has managed to keep that tagline not only going, but has done so while inventing a hilarious treasure trove of new material. This guy is just plain funny.In the Bill Engvall DVD Here's Your Sign - Live, the cutting edge comic delivers a dynamic performance worthy of his past success. Tackling the issues and themes of family, fatherhood, and marriage, he serves up a number of memorable one-liners and hilarious stories. But what makes Engvall so funny is that his humor is easy to relate to. Most people can identify with the subjects he tackles, and as everyone knows, all great humor has an element of truth in it.Engvall's DVD is good humor, and it's filled with countless stories about his family. Such as the time he took a cross-country trip with his son and unsuspectingly stopped for dinner at a topless steakhouse... You can't make this stuff up, and he delivers anecdote after hilarious anecdote. This is a comic with a bright and shining star, and all connoisseurs of stand-up comedy should assign this to their list of ""must see"" entertainment...The DVD Report",5,Utterly hilarious!,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,1945,"['Fans', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'will', 'love', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'DVD', 'featuring', '72', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'microphone', 'family-themed', 'side-splitting', 'comedy', 'highly', 'successful', 'comedian', 'sales', 'two', 'million', 'comedy', 'albums', 'credit', 'as', 'well', 'success', 'various', 'TV', 'shows', 'books', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'how', 'make', 'people', 'laugh', 'one', 'four', 'members', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'Engvall', 'firmly', 'cemented', 'comedian', 'hall', 'fame', 'first', 'saw', 'Bill', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'when', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'delivered', 'best', 'stand-up', 'routine', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'still', 'remember', 'much', 'word-for-word', 'day', 'Central', 'routine', 'was', 'trademark', 'tagline', 'Here', 'sign', 'referring', 'stupid', 'sign', 'handed', 'out', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'dumb', 'remarks', 'colleague', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'Engvall', 'managed', 'keep', 'tagline', 'not', 'only', 'going', 'done', 'so', 'inventing', 'hilarious', 'treasure', 'trove', 'new', 'material', 'guy', 'just', 'plain', 'funny.In', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'DVD', 'Here', 'Your', 'Sign', 'Live', 'cutting', 'edge', 'comic', 'delivers', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'worthy', 'past', 'success', 'Tackling', 'issues', 'themes', 'family', 'fatherhood', 'marriage', 'up', 'number', 'memorable', 'one-liners', 'hilarious', 'stories', 'what', 'so', 'funny', 'humor', 'easy', 'relate', 'Most', 'people', 'can', 'identify', 'subjects', 'everyone', 'great', 'humor', 'element', 'truth', 'it.Engvall', 'DVD', 'good', 'humor', 'filled', 'countless', 'stories', 'family', 'Such', 'time', 'took', 'cross-country', 'trip', 'son', 'unsuspectingly', 'stopped', 'dinner', 'topless', 'steakhouse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'stuff', 'up', 'anecdote', 'hilarious', 'anecdote', 'comic', 'bright', 'shining', 'star', 'connoisseurs', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'should', 'assign', 'list', 'must', 'see', 'entertainment', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

It is rare to watch or hear a show at the far end where every joke is gut-busting-laughter funny.  More commonly the listener finds about 50% of the jokes laugh-out-loud funny, 25% chuckles, and 25% merely amusing enough to keep your attention.  That's where the Bill Engvall ""Here's Your Sign"" show resided for me.  Keep in mind though I'm also his target audience for this particular show; older and married with kids. I watched it once alone, then watched it with my wife, enjoying it both times.  She's not a fan of comedy shows, finding most humor inauthentic and rehearsed-to-death, lacking spontaneity.  In contrast she thoroughly enjoyed Bill's show.Foul language doesn't offend me at all, but the absence of it in this show was refreshing.  I'm keeping the video in my watchlist to share with family visitors who are more sensitive to such matters.",4,"Laughs, chuckles, and interesting anecdotes",1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,962,"['Comedy', 'shows', 'are', 'bell', 'curve', 'ebb', 'flow', 'jokes', 'listener', 'funny', 'rare', 'watch', 'hear', 'show', 'far', 'end', 'where', 'joke', 'gut-busting-laughter', 'funny', 'More', 'commonly', 'listener', '50', '%', 'jokes', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', '25', '%', 'chuckles', '25', '%', 'merely', 'amusing', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention', 'where', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'Here', 'Your', 'Sign', 'show', 'resided', 'Keep', 'mind', ""'m"", 'also', 'target', 'audience', 'particular', 'show', 'older', 'married', 'kids', 'watched', 'once', 'alone', 'then', 'watched', 'wife', 'enjoying', 'times', 'not', 'fan', 'comedy', 'shows', 'finding', 'most', 'humor', 'inauthentic', 'rehearsed-to-death', 'lacking', 'spontaneity', 'contrast', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Bill', 'show.Foul', 'language', ""n't"", 'offend', 'absence', 'show', 'was', 'refreshing', ""'m"", 'keeping', 'video', 'watchlist', 'share', 'family', 'visitors', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'sensitive', 'such', 'matters']",N/A

Bill Engvall is simply the funniest human being on planet earth, or any other planet for that matter! He's funnier than Louie Anderson AND Sinbad! The here's your sign bit just makes me laugh until I throw up. I mean, if someone says something stupid, you say, ""Here's your sign"". That is genius. The only thing that has ever made me laugh that hard was when Kroll ran over a squirrel with his bike and taunted with a Bill Engvall bit. He's all like, ""Hey squirrel, this sidewalk doesn't say squirrel crossing, here's your sign."" The squirrel bit him and ran away, but it was still funny. You can use Bill Engvall in your daily life. I was interviewing for a fry cook position and the supervisor guy asked where I went to college. I told him, ""I'm interviewing to cook fries, I didn't go to college, Here's your sign.""

He is the first comedian to make me get philosophical since Jackie Mason's witty routines. His descriptions of family life, marriage, & the basic humor in everyday life were remarkably true & funny. I have friends who laughed so hard during his litany of differences between the first year of marriage & the twenty first that they actually had tears in their eyes. Indeed both the wives & husbands appeared to learn from his musings. How often can we say that from a comedy routine?His marriage seems to describe 80% of today's marriages? Guys can be clueless, & do fake incompetance to avoid certain tasks. Lets face it, guys don't really want to make all the decisions {like females would ever let us?} One thing he said is so true that females may find it unnerving? ""If it was not for sex they really would be in trouble, even though most would never admit it. Yes, even single males know how to play the game. His 3 basic male needs-food, sex, & sleep are spot on. We have fewer needs. Ladies,  why is that a negative?Maybe, males are more evolved than we get credit for, I'm not sure?He did leave out sports, but I guess we could survive without them?His having to shop for female toiletries with his son shows just how unsettled we males get over such private matters. I remember being 12 like his son & not having ""the discretionary gene he described."" I embarressd my father in exactly the same situation. Looking back at that semi-innocent age I could laugh heartily at my own past & see how similar guys of all generations really are.The second half was not as good as the first, but the first was so good that it still deserves 4 stars.",4,"Honest, Funny Observations.",1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,1726,"['Bill', 'Engvall', 'funniest', 'members', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Tour', 'first', 'comedian', 'make', 'get', 'philosophical', 'Jackie', 'Mason', 'witty', 'routines', 'descriptions', 'family', 'life', 'marriage', 'basic', 'humor', 'everyday', 'life', 'were', 'remarkably', 'true', 'funny', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'litany', 'differences', 'first', 'year', 'marriage', 'twenty', 'first', 'actually', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Indeed', 'wives', 'husbands', 'appeared', 'learn', 'musings', 'How', 'often', 'can', 'say', 'comedy', 'routine', 'marriage', 'describe', '80', '%', 'today', 'marriages', 'Guys', 'can', 'be', 'clueless', 'do', 'fake', 'incompetance', 'avoid', 'certain', 'tasks', 'face', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'make', 'decisions', 'females', 'would', 'ever', 'let', 'One', 'thing', 'said', 'so', 'true', 'females', 'may', 'find', 'unnerving', 'was', 'not', 'sex', 'really', 'would', 'be', 'trouble', 'even', 'most', 'would', 'never', 'admit', 'Yes', 'even', 'single', 'males', 'know', 'how', 'play', 'game', '3', 'basic', 'male', 'needs-food', 'sex', 'sleep', 'are', 'spot', 'have', 'fewer', 'needs', 'Ladies', 'why', 'negative', 'Maybe', 'males', 'are', 'more', 'evolved', 'get', 'credit', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'did', 'leave', 'out', 'sports', 'guess', 'could', 'survive', 'having', 'shop', 'female', 'toiletries', 'son', 'just', 'how', 'unsettled', 'males', 'get', 'such', 'private', 'matters', 'remember', 'being', '12', 'son', 'not', 'having', 'discretionary', 'gene', 'described', 'embarressd', 'father', 'exactly', 'same', 'situation', 'Looking', 'back', 'semi-innocent', 'age', 'could', 'laugh', 'heartily', 'own', 'past', 'see', 'how', 'similar', 'guys', 'generations', 'really', 'are.The', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'first', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'still', '4', 'stars']",N/A
