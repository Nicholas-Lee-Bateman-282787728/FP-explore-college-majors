The only reason i really rented it was because the cover art zombie from Lucio Fulci's classic ""Zombie"" was on the cover. So I thought id give it a try. Big Mistake. Weird storyline. Bad makeup effects. Little action. And who really roundhouse kicks a zombie anyways? And hey lets stay with my psycho wife after she tries to stab me and not get with the hot nurse. Yeah...ok.

Other reviewers have pointed out some of the flaws like cars driving past in the background.  Oh, if only THAT were only problem with this movie.It's boring.It took three tries to watch it all the way through; I kept falling asleep.To sum up the plot: Satan is trying to take over.  He has cracked open the door to hell and the dead are walking the earth.You won't learn this until more than an hour into the movie.Instead, you'll follow a spy who is trying to discover something important about a dead guy.  Said dead guy was trying to find his (the dead guy's) kidnapped son.  The spy is injected with the dead guy's DNA and then ""dreams"" the dead guy's life.The actors were good enough, I think.  They just didn't have much to work with.  The weakest point (other than the script) was the very poor fight scenes.  It was clear that punches and kicks didn't make contact.Corpses are forever?  It seemed more like the movie was forever.If you're looking for some good zombie flicks, let me recommend THE STINK OF FLESH, ZOMBIE HONEYMOON, and SHATTERDEAD.  They may not have the budget of this movie, but they have much better plots.",2,The Unforgivable Sin of Horror: It's Boring,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,1239,"['shame', 'good', 'technical', 'work', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'transferred', 'deserving', 'low-budget', 'film', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'flaws', 'cars', 'driving', 'past', 'background', 'Oh', 'only', 'THAT', 'were', 'only', 'problem', 'movie.It', 'boring.It', 'took', 'three', 'tries', 'watch', 'way', 'kept', 'falling', 'asleep.To', 'sum', 'up', 'plot', 'Satan', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'cracked', 'open', 'door', 'hell', 'dead', 'are', 'walking', 'earth.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', 'more', 'hour', 'movie.Instead', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'spy', 'who', 'trying', 'discover', 'something', 'important', 'dead', 'guy', 'Said', 'dead', 'guy', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'dead', 'guy', 'kidnapped', 'son', 'spy', 'injected', 'dead', 'guy', 'DNA', 'then', 'dreams', 'dead', 'guy', 'life.The', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'think', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'weakest', 'point', 'other', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'fight', 'scenes', 'was', 'clear', 'punches', 'kicks', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'contact.Corpses', 'are', 'forever', 'seemed', 'more', 'movie', 'was', 'forever.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'let', 'recommend', 'STINK', 'OF', 'FLESH', 'ZOMBIE', 'HONEYMOON', 'SHATTERDEAD', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'movie', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'plots']",N/A

I don't know which is worse, watching an Asylum film or having to endure a David DeCoteau film.  The local corporate video chain store likes to carry their videos.  Their shelves are stocked to the gills with there DVDs.  Asylum is worse because they try to hard.  They try to hard to be cool, inventive and funny.  Troma they're not.  At least David DeCoteau has a market (people who enjoy homoerotic horror films).  With name like Asylum you would think they would produce some edgy films. Not!Corpses Are Forever is filled with aging B-Movie stars andname dropping better films.  They should have copied the other films.  If they did the film makers might have made a better film.  Alas, they fall victim of trying to hard.  Maybe they should have tried harder.

So what if our obviously faked kung fu hero doesn't look like fit enough to be doing those spinkicks? The plot starts out as a sort of film-noir David Lynch-esque style film meets cheesy zombie fare. Sure, it eventually falls down into muddled stupidity, but whatever it does that so near the end of the film that it doesn't absolutely kill it all and make you angry.There's no major zombie action, they're more of a setpiece to spinkick, but the story itself is a nice little mystery which as ridiculous as it gets is still okay.If you're used to movies having higher budgets or being more tongue-in-cheek to hide its flaws, then you won't like this movie. But if you're used to the lowest of the low, you'll realize this one isn't so bad really, especially in comparison with a lot of other movies out there.It's no classic in any way, but I still enjoyed seeing it, and that's all I really need in a movie.",3,it was alright,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,981,"['CORPSES', 'ARE', 'FOREVER', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'disastrously', 'bad', 'everybody', 'So', 'what', 'obviously', 'faked', 'kung', 'fu', 'hero', ""n't"", 'look', 'fit', 'enough', 'be', 'doing', 'spinkicks', 'plot', 'out', 'sort', 'film-noir', 'David', 'Lynch-esque', 'style', 'film', 'meets', 'cheesy', 'zombie', 'fare', 'Sure', 'eventually', 'down', 'muddled', 'stupidity', 'whatever', 'so', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'kill', 'make', 'major', 'zombie', 'action', ""'re"", 'more', 'setpiece', 'spinkick', 'story', 'nice', 'little', 'mystery', 'as', 'ridiculous', 'still', 'okay.If', ""'re"", 'used', 'movies', 'having', 'higher', 'budgets', 'being', 'more', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'hide', 'flaws', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', ""'re"", 'used', 'lowest', 'low', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'one', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'really', 'especially', 'comparison', 'lot', 'other', 'movies', 'out', 'there.It', 'classic', 'way', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'really', 'need', 'movie']",N/A

That great little independent film that knocks your socks off.  You start looking at the covers and reading the backs until you say ""Hey, this looks like a winner"" and you take it home.  Well don't make the mistake I did with ""Corpses are Forever"", a truly dreadful movie that is the poster child for never judging a book, or DVD, by it's cover.The plot, what there is of it and I can only assume it took no more than a few pages of paper, perhaps written in crayon, concerns a guy who wakes up to find himself in a world overrun by zombies.  well overrun is a bit of an overstatement since you never see all that many zombies.  But here's this guy going Bruce Lee on them in the most hysterical manner.  Hysterical because he looks bad doing the moves and hysterical because the stunt coordination is so non-existent that none of the punches and kicks even remotely comes close to their target.He eventually encounters some special forces guys led by campy Richard Lynch and we get some goofball mix of spy movie and Zombie film mess.  Not even the presence of scream queens Brinke Stevens, Linnea Quigley, and Debbie Rochon can save this film.  The first two looking every bit the near 50 year olds that they are.  Jose Prendes wrote, directed, and stars in the film which comes off like a bad film school movie starring the directors friends.  Jose must have had some money to waste on this mess.
