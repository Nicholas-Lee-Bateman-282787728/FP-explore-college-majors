270931,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,6301862023,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[4, 4]","Bill Cosby is as fine a comedian as he is an activist, who also made some of thegreatestshowson television.  Sidney Poitier is a well-respected actor, who broke racial barriers with his stellar performances in the late-60s movies.  Together (with Poitier in the director seat), they couldn't make a ghost comedy work.  I wonder if this was just bad timing that ""Ghost Dad"" was released in the same year as when thatironic Patrick Swayze tearjerkercame out (a zillion-times better movie, I might add).  If this movie had been pushed back a year or so later, it probably would've been well received by the audience, but if that's the case, than the same could be said for ""Over Her Dead Body"".  Alright, ""Ghost Dad"" isn't worse than that Longoria ectoplasm, but it didn't make me spirited away in good terms.Part of the reason for my lack of enthusiasm is the way the film used the premise.  Cosby's character was killed when a satan-worshipping taxi driver crazily drove themselves off the bridge, which was quirky in a way, but there was a series of gags before it where he avoided very elaborate death traps; since this circumstance is also an elaborate death trap, it was disappointingly predictable.  Once he became a ghost, that's when the film is full of rotten Jello pudding.  According to the film, when Cosby introduced his ghost self to his kids, he can only be seen if there aren't any lights around him AND he can only talk through telepathy.  The movie is largely inconsistent on the whole seen-by-darkness aspect, since there are many scenes when he's surrounded by sunlight or even active lamps and he can still be visible to the living; as for the telepathy, while I'm not a pro on the subject, he doesn't really need to use his mouth to form audible speeches to the family who knew he's dead, and I doubt he can juggle telepathic speaking with physical action without flubbing it up.  And then there's the reveal that he can just jump back into his old body whenever he likes, which is probably the most contrived and implausible plot device just so the movie can have a happy ending.But there are other things about the film that bugs me besides just how loose the movie's concept of a ghost is described. Bill Cosby's character is established as an uncaring, overworking soon-to-learn-his-lesson-by-laws-of-probability father, who often yells at his character for distracting him or disregard their special days in the most asinine ways (a hat with shaving cream on top as a birthday cake...really?).  Trouble is, Cosby isn't convincing at playing such a character.  He has that SAME speaking HABIT of the EMPHASIZING of words and the PAUSES and the WEIRD shifting tone of his, and the faces he makes made him incapable to see him as an assertive, unruly father.  And then there's the children of the film, who seem way too humble about the fact that their daddy is dead, and soon they'll have to fend for themselves.  There's no sense of love or care in their interactions, they're incredible whiny and selfish for a good majority of the film, like the father's death isn't really a big deal.  All played for laughs, I suppose, but that's the issue I had with this movie: it's mocks the very subject of death.There's a sense of neglect and false wholesomeness surrounding ""Ghost Dad"".  When I think about the circumstances that happened within the film, it's actually very morbid.  The movie made it seem like it had a happy conclusion, but certain events preceding it meant the family is actually worse off in the end than they were in the beginning; without spoiling it, let's just say they'll be begging for food stamps.  You can't make a happy ending out of those grim prospects.",2,Too little spirit in a movie about a spirit,1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,3702,"['Bill', 'Cosby', 'as', 'fine', 'comedian', 'activist', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'thegreatestshowson', 'television', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'well-respected', 'actor', 'who', 'broke', 'racial', 'barriers', 'stellar', 'performances', 'late-60s', 'movies', 'Together', 'Poitier', 'director', 'seat', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'ghost', 'comedy', 'work', 'wonder', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'timing', 'Ghost', 'Dad', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'when', 'thatironic', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'tearjerkercame', 'out', 'zillion-times', 'better', 'movie', 'might', 'add', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'pushed', 'back', 'year', 'so', 'later', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'well', 'received', 'audience', 'case', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Dead', 'Body', 'Alright', 'Ghost', 'Dad', ""n't"", 'worse', 'Longoria', 'ectoplasm', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'spirited', 'away', 'good', 'terms.Part', 'reason', 'lack', 'enthusiasm', 'way', 'film', 'used', 'premise', 'Cosby', 'character', 'was', 'killed', 'when', 'satan-worshipping', 'taxi', 'driver', 'crazily', 'drove', 'off', 'bridge', 'was', 'quirky', 'way', 'there', 'was', 'series', 'gags', 'where', 'avoided', 'very', 'elaborate', 'death', 'traps', 'circumstance', 'also', 'elaborate', 'death', 'trap', 'was', 'disappointingly', 'predictable', 'Once', 'became', 'ghost', 'when', 'film', 'full', 'rotten', 'Jello', 'pudding', 'According', 'film', 'when', 'Cosby', 'introduced', 'ghost', 'self', 'kids', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'are', ""n't"", 'lights', 'can', 'only', 'talk', 'telepathy', 'movie', 'largely', 'inconsistent', 'whole', 'seen-by-darkness', 'aspect', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'when', 'surrounded', 'sunlight', 'even', 'active', 'lamps', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'visible', 'living', 'telepathy', ""'m"", 'not', 'pro', 'subject', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'use', 'mouth', 'form', 'audible', 'speeches', 'family', 'who', 'knew', 'dead', 'doubt', 'can', 'juggle', 'telepathic', 'speaking', 'physical', 'action', 'flubbing', 'up', 'then', 'reveal', 'can', 'just', 'jump', 'back', 'old', 'body', 'whenever', 'probably', 'most', 'contrived', 'implausible', 'plot', 'device', 'just', 'so', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'happy', 'ending.But', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'loose', 'movie', 'concept', 'ghost', 'described', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'character', 'established', 'uncaring', 'overworking', 'soon-to-learn-his-lesson-by-laws-of-probability', 'father', 'who', 'often', 'character', 'distracting', 'disregard', 'special', 'days', 'most', 'asinine', 'ways', 'hat', 'shaving', 'cream', 'top', 'birthday', 'cake', 'really', 'Trouble', 'Cosby', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'playing', 'character', 'SAME', 'speaking', 'HABIT', 'EMPHASIZING', 'words', 'PAUSES', 'WEIRD', 'shifting', 'tone', 'made', 'incapable', 'see', 'assertive', 'unruly', 'father', 'then', 'children', 'film', 'who', 'seem', 'way', 'too', 'humble', 'fact', 'daddy', 'dead', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fend', 'sense', 'love', 'care', 'interactions', ""'re"", 'incredible', 'whiny', 'selfish', 'good', 'majority', 'film', 'father', 'death', ""n't"", 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'played', 'laughs', 'suppose', 'issue', 'had', 'movie', 'very', 'subject', 'death.There', 'sense', 'neglect', 'false', 'wholesomeness', 'surrounding', 'Ghost', 'Dad', 'When', 'think', 'circumstances', 'happened', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'morbid', 'movie', 'made', 'seem', 'had', 'happy', 'conclusion', 'certain', 'events', 'preceding', 'meant', 'family', 'actually', 'worse', 'off', 'end', 'were', 'beginning', 'spoiling', 'let', 'just', 'say', ""'ll"", 'be', 'begging', 'food', 'stamps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'happy', 'ending', 'grim', 'prospects']",N/A

270948,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,6301862023,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[5, 12]","Words do not describe how bad Ghost Dad is. An extremely pitiful attempt at comedy this bland movie will have you laughing at how bad the movie is instead of laughing with the jokes. Leonard part 6 is a better film.The premise of this movie is that Cosby's workaholic dad dies and tries to help his kids. The story must have sounded good on paper. The movie presented onscreen looks like something made up by chimpanzees that got a hold of a box of crayons. There should be subtitles at the bottom of the screen of Bill Cosby movies so we can understand what Cosby s saying. I couldn't understand a word of his dialogue through all the mugging and the babbling. From what I saw, it looks like workaholic Cos gets into a cab with a psycho cabbie who drives him off a tall bridge. This turns him into Ghost Cos who can walk through walls while inanely mugging. After having the perfunctory test of his ghost abilities, he begins interacting with his bland as the Bradys family and neighbors mugging and babbling until the movie comes to the wretched end. If you can get through 20 minutes of this whole movie without stopping the VCR or DVD and throwing this movie out a window consider yourself lucky. You have built up an extremely strong tolerance for bad movies. Getting through this you just may be ready for the film disaster known as Manos: The Hands of Fate.Bill Cosby may be the man on TV, but in the movies he's never been lucky. His goofy facial mugging and crazy sounds get on your nerves. The settings of his films remind you of the white bread fantasy world of The Brady Bunch. Everything is so vanilla it's just not natural. The kids in his family have no personalities; the people are flavorless sweet cutouts like animal crackers. I wanted some sense of realism to make the story interesting.Long story short, if you're a MST3K producer looking for a film for Mike, Crow, and Tom Servo to rip into like a chainsaw tearing through a redwood this is the film for you. Everyone else get Bubba Ho Tep or Ghost.",1,I would like to talk to you... about how bad this movie is!,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,2021,"['Words', 'do', 'not', 'describe', 'how', 'bad', 'Ghost', 'Dad', 'extremely', 'pitiful', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'bland', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'instead', 'laughing', 'jokes', 'Leonard', 'part', '6', 'better', 'film.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'Cosby', 'workaholic', 'dad', 'dies', 'tries', 'help', 'kids', 'story', 'must', 'have', 'sounded', 'good', 'paper', 'movie', 'presented', 'onscreen', 'looks', 'something', 'made', 'up', 'chimpanzees', 'got', 'hold', 'box', 'crayons', 'should', 'be', 'subtitles', 'bottom', 'screen', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'movies', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'Cosby', 's', 'saying', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'dialogue', 'mugging', 'babbling', 'what', 'saw', 'workaholic', 'Cos', 'cab', 'psycho', 'cabbie', 'who', 'off', 'tall', 'bridge', 'Ghost', 'Cos', 'who', 'can', 'walk', 'walls', 'inanely', 'mugging', 'having', 'perfunctory', 'test', 'ghost', 'abilities', 'interacting', 'bland', 'Bradys', 'family', 'neighbors', 'mugging', 'babbling', 'movie', 'wretched', 'end', 'can', 'get', '20', 'minutes', 'whole', 'movie', 'stopping', 'VCR', 'DVD', 'throwing', 'movie', 'out', 'window', 'consider', 'lucky', 'have', 'built', 'up', 'extremely', 'strong', 'tolerance', 'bad', 'movies', 'Getting', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'ready', 'film', 'disaster', 'known', 'Manos', 'Hands', 'Fate.Bill', 'Cosby', 'may', 'be', 'man', 'TV', 'movies', 'never', 'been', 'lucky', 'goofy', 'facial', 'mugging', 'crazy', 'sounds', 'get', 'nerves', 'settings', 'films', 'remind', 'white', 'bread', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Everything', 'so', 'vanilla', 'just', 'not', 'natural', 'kids', 'family', 'have', 'personalities', 'people', 'are', 'flavorless', 'sweet', 'cutouts', 'animal', 'crackers', 'wanted', 'sense', 'realism', 'make', 'story', 'interesting.Long', 'story', 'short', ""'re"", 'MST3K', 'producer', 'looking', 'film', 'Mike', 'Crow', 'Tom', 'Servo', 'rip', 'chainsaw', 'tearing', 'redwood', 'film', 'Everyone', 'else', 'get', 'Bubba', 'Ho', 'Tep', 'Ghost']",N/A
