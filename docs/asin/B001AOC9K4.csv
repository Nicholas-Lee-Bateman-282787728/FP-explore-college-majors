1166569,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B001AOC9K4,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[18, 19]","The night after a guy he meets at a bar declares him to be a ""gay clich&eacute;,"" flamboyant partyboy Luke (Jesse Archer, who also co-wrote the screenplay) is bothered enough about it to ask his friends if he is ""too gay,"" but seems unlikely to take their advice.  When he meets up again with Stephen (the guy from the bar, played by Charlie David from ""Dante's Cove""), Luke finds himself - for possibly the first time in his young gay life - open to having a stable and loving monogamous relationship. Knowing Luke's track record with guys, his friends scoff at this possibility, but can also see the change in Luke since he met Stephen.  But Luke's dreams seem impossible, when he catches Stephen in several lies, including how he earns his comfortable living and fancy apartment.This is essentially a sequel to producer/director/co-writer Casper Andreas' 2004 comedy ""Slutty Summer,"" which introduced several characters, including Luke and his straight, alcoholic friend Marilyn, as well as also taking place in the trendy Chelsea area of Manhattan. There's an underlying lesson about self-acceptance and following your dreams, but the film suffers from poorly-directed overlapping stories and some incredibly cheesy dialogue, as well as a gratuitous ""nude male yoga"" scene that has nothing to do with the story. It's still fun, however, and has some interesting eye candy; I'll give it four stars out of five.",4,"Can a ""gay clich&eacute;"" find true love in Chelsea?",1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,1413,"['night', 'guy', 'bar', 'be', 'gay', 'clich', 'eacute', 'flamboyant', 'partyboy', 'Luke', 'Jesse', 'Archer', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'bothered', 'enough', 'ask', 'friends', 'too', 'gay', 'unlikely', 'take', 'advice', 'When', 'up', 'again', 'Stephen', 'guy', 'bar', 'played', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Dante', 'Cove', 'Luke', 'possibly', 'first', 'time', 'young', 'gay', 'life', 'open', 'having', 'stable', 'loving', 'monogamous', 'relationship', 'Knowing', 'Luke', 'track', 'record', 'guys', 'friends', 'scoff', 'possibility', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'change', 'Luke', 'met', 'Stephen', 'Luke', 'dreams', 'seem', 'impossible', 'when', 'Stephen', 'several', 'lies', 'including', 'how', 'comfortable', 'living', 'fancy', 'apartment.This', 'essentially', 'sequel', 'producer/director/co-writer', 'Casper', 'Andreas', '2004', 'comedy', 'Slutty', 'Summer', 'introduced', 'several', 'characters', 'including', 'Luke', 'straight', 'alcoholic', 'friend', 'Marilyn', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'taking', 'place', 'trendy', 'Chelsea', 'area', 'Manhattan', 'underlying', 'lesson', 'self-acceptance', 'following', 'dreams', 'film', 'suffers', 'poorly-directed', 'overlapping', 'stories', 'incredibly', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'gratuitous', 'nude', 'male', 'yoga', 'scene', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'still', 'fun', 'however', 'interesting', 'eye', 'candy', ""'ll"", 'give', 'four', 'five']",A Four Letter Word

1166571,A3KDKURBSY5W61,B001AOC9K4,Damon Devine,"[4, 6]","As another reviewer pointed out, the script to this film must have been written by a kid it is so predictable. There are cheap cliches throughout, which is extremely common in gay comedy these days. Black penises, the token Latino queen who uses only sexy Spanish words, the ""boa wearing queen"" etc, ENDLESS silly sex jokes, lots of failed attempts at being edgy via interracial ""relations"" and EXTREMELY unrealistic pairings and situations. Yes, it's a comedy...but it's got to at least be a LITTLE believable, right?  I live in L.A. (Hollywood) and total total queen on total queen lovin' is a rarity. Any guy in a boa in broad daylight is not gonna get laid. Period. In this film EVERYone's after the lead [ultra-flaming] guy (Luke), even another character who is at first appalled by him, is suddenly, for no good reason what-so-ever, in love with him.There is a very good looking black guy in this film (JR Rolley), but even his beautiful face cannot make up for his total lack of acting ability. The front counter gay at the sex shop (played by Cory Grant) is probably meant to be the most likable character, but in fact, he comes off as self-righteous and banal.Virginia Bryan is a great actress, but in this film, she is completely unnecessary. If her part was cut, it would have made no difference in the film.To tell you the truth--the only memorable part was just a minute or two long. There is a HILARIOUS queen (Adam Joseph) singing a song called ""Faggoty Attention.""  At first my friend and I said ""did he just say 'faggoty attention'?""This singer apparently thinks he and the song are both really sexy and it makes for a screamingly funny scene, but is interrupted by more nonsense from the script. I'm gonna look that guy up, he seems like great fun to hang out with.If this film is supposed to have a message beneath the cringe-inducing low-grade comedy, it is lost (in the over 2 hour film!).  It can never compare to a gay comedy film with a powerful message like 'But I'm A Cheerleader' or the totally precious 'Ma Vie En Rose.'

It was interesting to see what happened to these characters after their slutty summer. This film also continues the exploration of the the themes of sex and love but adds relationships and communication to the mix.  As anyone who has had any life at all knows, relationships are tricky things and honest communication is rare. The characters of Luke played by Jesse Archer and Zeke played by Cory Grant provide a counterpoint in this examination of attitudes about life and love. It is a sweet moment when when Luke rises above being a gay cliche and grows up a little.

Hooray for digital cameras and other advances, I suppose. And it doesn't feel like a home video or anything like that - it's an honesty decent movie. As much as story is important, it also helps when the video quality isn't bad and the whole things ends up feeling like an amateur adult entertainment video, if you catch my drift.The story itself is quirky, but still interesting. Andreas was a little ambitious in trying to juggle three separate stories all at the same time and I think we could have done with less of that, or perhaps those stories could have been simplified to some extent. The one that suffered the most involved Derek and Peter since all we know is that they had a bit of a fight, they spent a wee bit of time apart, and then they get back together.It's kind of funny in a sad way that Stephen's character gets away with calling Luke a gay stereotype when he embodies a gay stereotype as well. He's supposed to be the one who's more obviously into his body and also seems to take the time to meticulously pluck their eyebrows and try to look all pretty. But hey, it's a movie and we'll take what we can get.Although the Luke-Stephen story is pretty much the main arc, it still felt a little shallow and underdeveloped. Their conflicts are horribly petty, even though Luke does generally have some limited basis for being all snoopy and paranoid. But his change of character in trying to be monogamous did feel rather forced even more than it was presented to be and the ending just felt a little odd.The guys in the movie were mostly pretty fit, although more on the twinky side. So the gratuitous sex scenes weren't entirely disappointing (or at least weren't horrifying). Things are still stay on the comedy side of the equation as much as possible, so that's a good thing.
