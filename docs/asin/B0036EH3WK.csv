1327727,A2FK35LO6EG6XB,B0036EH3WK,Alt,"[0, 0]","I'm giving five stars to all six seasons of Lost because I enjoyed every single episode. Sure, I enjoyed some more than others, but every episode provoked an emotional reaction: a laugh, misty eyes, or a surprised ""wow."" The characters are sharply defined and the acting is uniformly strong. I can't think of another series in which I altered my opinion of the characters so frequently. Characters I disliked turned out to be admirable, while characters who initially seemed admirable turned out to be sketchy. My favorite character changed from week to week and, while watching one die was always upsetting, the feeling of loss was ameliorated by the rise of another.Unlike some naysayers who think a disappointing ending to the series destroys the value of each episode that preceded it, I'm not prepared to forget how frequently I was captivated, and moved, by the stories that were told about the individual lives of the island's inhabitants. And if I may be so bold as to disagree with those who think the writers of the series got ""lost"" along the way, it seems to me that the story follows a coherent arc. There are scenes in season one that attain no significance until season six. That reflects careful planning, not off-the-cuff writing.My sole gripe about Lost is that it incorporates a supernatural/mystical/religious element that, although central to the story, is not something to which I can easily relate. I'm not a big fan of the supernatural. It's just too easy to use the supernatural to explain phenomena when, with more difficulty and imagination, a reality-based explanation might be concocted. The ""smoke monster"" that turns up from time to time, the good versus evil theme, the deliberate confusion as to whether Jason or Locke might be the devil, all struck me as misplaced. The serious religious overtones of the final episode are just unnecessary. This could have been told as a time travel story with characters living parallel lives on and off the island without getting hokey about ""what comes next."" The attempt to meld science fiction and mysticism almost never works, and the effort to do so in Lost weakens the overall story. Having said that, I reaffirm my belief that displeasure with the series' resolution does not change the immense pleasure I felt watching the individual episodes that led up to it.",5,A weak ending does not destroy the value of six stellar seasons,1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,2339,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'six', 'seasons', 'Lost', 'enjoyed', 'single', 'episode', 'Sure', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'others', 'episode', 'provoked', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'laugh', 'misty', 'eyes', 'surprised', 'wow', 'characters', 'are', 'sharply', 'defined', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'strong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'series', 'altered', 'opinion', 'characters', 'so', 'frequently', 'Characters', 'disliked', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'admirable', 'characters', 'who', 'initially', 'seemed', 'admirable', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'sketchy', 'favorite', 'character', 'changed', 'week', 'week', 'watching', 'one', 'die', 'was', 'always', 'upsetting', 'feeling', 'loss', 'was', 'ameliorated', 'rise', 'another.Unlike', 'naysayers', 'who', 'think', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'series', 'value', 'episode', 'preceded', ""'m"", 'not', 'prepared', 'forget', 'how', 'frequently', 'was', 'captivated', 'moved', 'stories', 'were', 'told', 'individual', 'lives', 'island', 'inhabitants', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'bold', 'disagree', 'who', 'think', 'writers', 'series', 'got', 'lost', 'way', 'story', 'coherent', 'arc', 'are', 'scenes', 'season', 'one', 'attain', 'significance', 'season', 'six', 'careful', 'planning', 'not', 'off-the-cuff', 'writing.My', 'sole', 'gripe', 'Lost', 'supernatural/mystical/religious', 'element', 'central', 'story', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'easily', 'relate', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'supernatural', 'just', 'too', 'easy', 'use', 'supernatural', 'explain', 'phenomena', 'when', 'more', 'difficulty', 'imagination', 'reality-based', 'explanation', 'might', 'be', 'concocted', 'smoke', 'monster', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'theme', 'deliberate', 'confusion', 'Jason', 'Locke', 'might', 'be', 'devil', 'struck', 'misplaced', 'serious', 'religious', 'overtones', 'final', 'episode', 'are', 'just', 'unnecessary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'time', 'travel', 'story', 'characters', 'living', 'parallel', 'lives', 'island', 'getting', 'hokey', 'what', 'next', 'attempt', 'meld', 'science', 'fiction', 'mysticism', 'almost', 'never', 'effort', 'do', 'so', 'Lost', 'overall', 'story', 'Having', 'said', 'reaffirm', 'belief', 'displeasure', 'series', 'resolution', 'not', 'change', 'immense', 'pleasure', 'felt', 'watching', 'individual', 'led', 'up']",N/A

Suddenly, debris rains down from heaven, a worst nightmare, a plane crash, sailing with the fury of hell in the sky, exploding into the screen and bringing with it a series of characters, whose stories are about to entwine, and lead us on an adventure of hope and sacrifice and love and spirituality, and as all true things have: mystery.It is no wonder that the show was an overnight success, the first season reigning in enormous critical acclaim, fan interpretation, speculation and praise. The problem, mainly, is the length of the show, and with it, the feeling of `filler.' Dialogue that's drawn out and unnecessary, story arcs that feel `made up as they go along' and irrelevant, instances where you sit there thinking `Well that's just stupid', too much spoon feeding the audience, and really, not enough intelligence for such an expansive premise. Investing so much time in a series, instead you could watch about sixty movies, read twenty novels etc. People started turning off in season two, and based on untangling threads (Walt springs to mind) I know why.However, by the end, it all seems worth it, you've lived another life, met characters you never would have known, and like most great things, felt a peculiarity, a curiosity, about the wonder of life itself. I can say a lot of negative things about how the show ground along, knowing that it would have been a five star show, no question, if it was perhaps only three seasons with a tighter and more fluid script, but looking back at it as a finished piece of work, it did its job, it told its story, and, for my money, it ended 'pretty' well.Three and a half stars.",3,"LOST (An overview, without spoilers)",1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,1743,"['LOSTA', 'peaceful', 'breeze', 'washes', 'paradise', 'sparkling', 'sand', 'ocean', 'blue', 'clear', 'glass', 'sky', 'Suddenly', 'debris', 'rains', 'down', 'heaven', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'plane', 'crash', 'sailing', 'fury', 'hell', 'sky', 'exploding', 'screen', 'bringing', 'series', 'characters', 'stories', 'are', 'entwine', 'lead', 'adventure', 'hope', 'sacrifice', 'love', 'spirituality', 'true', 'things', 'have', 'mystery.It', 'wonder', 'show', 'was', 'overnight', 'success', 'first', 'season', 'reigning', 'enormous', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'fan', 'interpretation', 'speculation', 'praise', 'problem', 'mainly', 'length', 'show', 'feeling', 'filler', 'Dialogue', 'drawn', 'out', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'arcs', 'feel', 'made', 'up', 'go', 'along', 'irrelevant', 'instances', 'where', 'sit', 'thinking', 'Well', 'just', 'stupid', 'too', 'much', 'spoon', 'feeding', 'audience', 'really', 'not', 'enough', 'intelligence', 'such', 'expansive', 'premise', 'Investing', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'series', 'instead', 'could', 'watch', 'sixty', 'movies', 'read', 'twenty', 'novels', 'etc', 'People', 'started', 'turning', 'off', 'season', 'two', 'based', 'untangling', 'threads', 'Walt', 'springs', 'mind', 'know', 'why.However', 'end', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'life', 'met', 'characters', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'most', 'great', 'things', 'felt', 'peculiarity', 'curiosity', 'wonder', 'life', 'can', 'say', 'lot', 'negative', 'things', 'how', 'show', 'ground', 'knowing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'five', 'star', 'show', 'question', 'was', 'perhaps', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'tighter', 'more', 'fluid', 'script', 'looking', 'back', 'finished', 'piece', 'work', 'did', 'job', 'told', 'story', 'money', 'ended', ""'pretty"", 'well.Three', 'half', 'stars']",N/A

As you've heard, it comes with a Senet board and game pieces, ankh that contains hints on how to get to an easter egg on the bonus disc, a diary page from the black rock and the black light (which helps you see the hatch map on the bottom of the box as well as reveal the hints to find the extra disc).  The replica of the temple is very sturdy...and you can actually turn the lid upside-down so that the map is on top if thats your preference.What a lot of reviews fail to mention is that it's loaded with a heaping dose of nostalgia.The box that the set comes wrapped in is actually a memorial of all the characters that appeared on the show.  The episode guide has some very lovely illustrations in it, depicting what I would consider the most memorable scenes of the show.  The sleeves that the discs come in also have some of the same type of artwork.  I actually got a lump in my throat as I was flipping through these things remembering the first time we watched those scenes...remembering the people I'd discuss the episodes with and realizing we wont have any of that this year except for the mass re-watch that many of us will be participating in.Then there are the special features.  Swan Song shows everyone in Michael Giacchino's studio watching them record the soundtrack for the finale.

1327742,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0036EH3WK,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 4]","It's a vast mass of mysteries, bizarre twists and supernatural occurrences -- and it's brilliant. ""Lost: The Complete Series"" has some bumps along its way (particularly in the second season), but it blossoms once it finds its footing, and starts working towards a brain-bending, epic clash between the forces of light and darkness. Think of it as ""Swiss Family Robinson"" by way of Stephen King.A plane crashes on a remote tropical island, leaving a terrified band of survivors including a doctor named Jack (Matthew Fox), a spoiled brother and sister, a single dad and his strange son, an Iraqi ex-soldier, a Korean couple, chubby lottery winner, an escaped prisoner, a hostile con-man, a man cured of paralysis, and a junkie rocker.Unfortunately, the island has countless perils that crop up as the survivors try to survive there, and strange people are hidden in its depths. What's more, the island has a history that stretches back countless years -- there are remnants of a powerful organization called Dharma, a collection of ""Others"" living in a luxurious modern village, a metal hatch with a button that MUST be pushed, and ancient statues and temples from ancient times.The survivors do their best to keep alive and to fight back the Others, but they lose many of their number as they struggle to survive. And when a small band of them do escape the island, they find that they have somehow disrupted the island's primal forces, and even the fabric of time itself. But even when they fight their way back to the island, they find that not all is as it should be. In an effort to set things right, they must take the ultimate risk... or the evil force imprisoned on the island will destroy them all.Yes, it's a weird show -- ""Lost"" might make more sense if you're drunk or stoned, because it can swing wildly from the downright surreal to the mundane. But in the midst of shallow sitcoms and endless reality TV, it's refreshing to see a twisty-turny show like this one -- religious symbolism, horror, science fiction, and a mythic storyline that stretches through the centuries.The lush landscape is a contrast for such a dark storyline, although the writers do stumble occasionally (the first half of the second season is a total misfire). Adams never reveals everything, which keeps up the suspense, and he twines together dozens of mysteries -- the island's nature, its prior inhabitants, and its countless mysteries. Every time Adams unravels one puzzle, it just reveals a new one -- and while he fails to answer all the mysteries (Walt and the animals!), the answers to the main ones are truly spellbinding.And ""Lost"" is truly an ensemble show -- every character gets to shine (including some we don't care about), and flashbacks (and flash-forwards) reveal what makes them tick. Some like Jin, Sun and the haunted, smart-alecky Sawyer evolve into whole new people.Matthew Fox is given a lot of attention, and he is a good actor... even though the self-righteous Jack eventually gets kind of annoying. Fortunately, there's a brilliant supporting cast -- Dominic Monaghan, Jorge Garcia (""Dude, that was a Jedi moment!""), Terry O'Quinn, Evangeline Lilly, the brilliant Naveen Andrews and Josh Holloway, Yunjin Kim, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Daniel Dae Kim. Michael Emerson is awesome as the creepy-eyed Other leader, as is Henry Ian Cusick as ex-soldier/monk Desmond.""Lost"" is a well-written, well-acted show that brings a bit of mystery back into prime-time television.

1327751,AEV640MKB3I9J,B0036EH3WK,Hank Drake,"[10, 13]","As it has already been debated in reviews and on forums, I'm not going to comment on Lost as a series, other than to state that I loved it - I'd have to go back to the original Star Trek to name a series that so held my attention.  Why would I have bought the complete series on Blu-ray if it hadn't?  So, here is my review on the particulars in this collection.The 1080p image quality on Blu-ray is spectacular, far eclipsing what could be seen either on the original ABC broadcast (even HD broadcast, which was 720p) and the conventional DVD issues.  Hitherto unseen details are readily apparent here, starting in the opening minutes of the pilot, where the bamboo forest is dazzlingly clear, as is the riveting post crash sequence.  If you don't already have a Blu-ray player, this set is good incentive to get one.  From what I can see, there has been no digital noise reduction, so there are instances of grain, especially in darker sequences - but this is not distracting, and adds to the gritty realism of the show.  In short, the video quality is far above what is seen on modern series television, and looks more like a big budget movie.Audio is also superb, with 5.1 mix for English leading the pack.  Dialogue is boldly front & center, with plenty of activity in the surround channels.  But unlike many 5.1 mixes, the dialogue is never swamped.  5.1 audio is also available for French, European Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese.  Latin American Spanish is available in stereo only.There are over 30 option for subtitles, including, but not limited to, English, Spanish (both European & Latin American), Portuguese, Swedish, Thai, Korean, and a host of others.  The subtitles are offered both as dialogue only, or with descriptions for the hearing impaired.  Caveat: Not all spoken language and subtitles appear in each episode.  Options are inconsistent, which is rather annoying.Beyond the extras that came with the previous sets (bloopers, behind the scenes featurettes, interviews, all of which are ported over to the complete collection) there are some additional goodies that come with the boxed set.  For the most part, these are of the toy/game variety: a map of the island, Senet gameboard with white and black stones for playing, a log entry from the Black Rock, a black-light for viewing some hidden items, and an ankh with a hidden hieroglyphic message from Jacob - the message deals with how to find an additional disc hidden in the box.Now to the bonus disc: the disc is hidden under the map of the island on the underside of the box top.  The easiest way to get to it is to place the box top with the ""LOST"" side down on a hard surface.  While holding that in place, turn the map  turn clockwise, then carefully lift the map off the box top.  If you try to simply yank the map off the box top without turning it, you'll damage the tabs that hold the map in place.

1327754,A1UV1GD4DFXLEM,B0036EH3WK,"Hucklebarry ""Hucklebarry""","[5, 6]","With over 300 reviews its difficult to add anything not already covered.  Rather than attempt to rate the show of such a fantastic franchise years after its been off the air, I'll just say that this is one of the most amazing and influential TV series I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  I'd recommend that EVERYONE watch the pilot anyway they can and if they find it enjoyable, then this purchase will be well worth their money.But, I do want to discuss the problems I have with the actual packaging of this great show as a ""buyer beware"" section.  While it likely isn't enough to make you avoid the purchase, there are some frustrations that may lead you to the standard seasons instead of this complete collection.First, The actual discs are in a cardboard binder.  It pains me to slide out a disc on cardboard.  But the other problem is the size of the case.  Its 25 - 45% taller than a standard DVD case.  So you can't store this on a DVD shelf without turning it on its side.  This is the actual DVD case removed from the odd shaped box the extras are stored in.  I'm going to buy a multi-disc binder to keep them in, which is a bit of a shame for this nice collector's set.The ankh was a bit disappointing as it feels like very shallow plastic and easily separates in the middle.  If you actually wanted to display this, it isn't smooth enough on the bottom to stand up on its own and it comes apart too easily to wear as a necklace (plus, the place where it separates is very noticeable, even at medium distance).Next, the features on the disc are organized in a very frustrating way.  Items are not listed, they have to be scrolled through.  What's worse, completely unnecessary items are in the way.  Once you choose to watch ""episodes"" over ""features"" you are then prompted for the season.  Keep in mind you already inserted the disc to get to this point.  If you scroll to another season, it politely tells you to insert that disc.  Why?  Then, every time you start watching an episode you are asked if you want to use the feature that remembers where you left off.Additionally, there are many load screens and splash screens at the insert of each disc (one of which is a warning that some screens may take long to load).  The first disc, season 1, had multiple advertisements for the Lost series.  This was frustrating as I had purchased the entire series in a nice collector's set and was not expecting the same advertisements from the standard DVD that sold over 6 years ago.  So, after watching commercials and multiple loading/splash screens, you then have to click 4 buttons to get the show started each time (not counting the scrolling of episodes since they don't list in a menu).  With only 4 episodes on a disc, I am thinking this could have easily been organized into a more user friendly fashion.Finally, the commentary is what I was most excited about and am now equally disappointed over.  In a show shrouded in mystery and secrets which left epic details unanswered... I was giddy over hearing director/writer/actor comments that would explain some of what was going on.  No show has ever had me wanting commentary more than this one.  Sadly, after viewing the firs 10 commentaries, I've seen little other than stating the obvious, (i.e. ""this is a great scene, the actor did a good job here""), joking with other cast members (while funny at times, it adds nothing to the Lost cannon or helps with understanding the episodes in any way), or talking over the scenes with information that has nothing to do with show or content at all.  To be fair, I am enjoying the commentary, but given this series, its quite a waste of time.In summary, I'm enjoying one of the best TV moments in the history of television while I watch this set of discs, but I'm also disappointed at the treatment the physical media and contents received.",4,A 5 star show in a 3 star package,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,3856,"['300', 'reviews', 'difficult', 'add', 'anything', 'not', 'already', 'covered', 'Rather', 'attempt', 'rate', 'show', 'such', 'fantastic', 'franchise', 'years', 'been', 'air', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'amazing', 'influential', 'TV', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'EVERYONE', 'watch', 'pilot', 'can', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'then', 'purchase', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'money.But', 'do', 'want', 'discuss', 'problems', 'have', 'actual', 'packaging', 'great', 'show', 'buyer', 'beware', 'section', 'likely', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'avoid', 'purchase', 'are', 'frustrations', 'may', 'lead', 'standard', 'seasons', 'instead', 'complete', 'collection.First', 'actual', 'discs', 'are', 'cardboard', 'binder', 'slide', 'out', 'disc', 'cardboard', 'other', 'problem', 'size', 'case', '25', '45', '%', 'taller', 'standard', 'DVD', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'store', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'turning', 'side', 'actual', 'DVD', 'case', 'removed', 'odd', 'shaped', 'box', 'extras', 'are', 'stored', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'multi-disc', 'binder', 'keep', 'bit', 'shame', 'nice', 'collector', 'set.The', 'ankh', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'very', 'shallow', 'plastic', 'easily', 'separates', 'middle', 'actually', 'wanted', 'display', ""n't"", 'smooth', 'enough', 'bottom', 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'apart', 'too', 'easily', 'wear', 'necklace', 'place', 'where', 'very', 'noticeable', 'even', 'medium', 'distance', '.Next', 'features', 'disc', 'are', 'organized', 'very', 'frustrating', 'way', 'Items', 'are', 'not', 'listed', 'have', 'be', 'scrolled', 'What', 'worse', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'items', 'are', 'way', 'choose', 'watch', 'episodes', 'features', 'are', 'then', 'prompted', 'season', 'Keep', 'mind', 'already', 'inserted', 'disc', 'get', 'point', 'scroll', 'season', 'politely', 'insert', 'disc', 'Why', 'Then', 'time', 'start', 'watching', 'episode', 'are', 'asked', 'want', 'use', 'feature', 'remembers', 'where', 'left', 'off.Additionally', 'are', 'many', 'load', 'screens', 'splash', 'screens', 'insert', 'disc', 'one', 'warning', 'screens', 'may', 'take', 'long', 'load', 'first', 'disc', 'season', '1', 'had', 'multiple', 'advertisements', 'Lost', 'series', 'was', 'frustrating', 'had', 'purchased', 'entire', 'series', 'nice', 'collector', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'same', 'advertisements', 'standard', 'DVD', 'sold', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'So', 'watching', 'commercials', 'multiple', 'loading/splash', 'screens', 'then', 'have', 'click', '4', 'buttons', 'get', 'show', 'started', 'time', 'not', 'counting', 'scrolling', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'list', 'menu', 'only', '4', 'episodes', 'disc', 'am', 'thinking', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'organized', 'more', 'user', 'friendly', 'fashion.Finally', 'commentary', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'excited', 'am', 'now', 'equally', 'disappointed', 'over', 'show', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'secrets', 'left', 'epic', 'details', 'unanswered', 'was', 'giddy', 'hearing', 'director/writer/actor', 'comments', 'would', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'wanting', 'commentary', 'more', 'one', 'Sadly', 'viewing', 'firs', '10', 'commentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'little', 'other', 'stating', 'obvious', 'i.e', 'great', 'scene', 'actor', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'joking', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'funny', 'times', 'nothing', 'Lost', 'cannon', 'understanding', 'episodes', 'way', 'talking', 'scenes', 'information', 'nothing', 'do', 'show', 'content', 'be', 'fair', 'am', 'enjoying', 'commentary', 'given', 'series', 'waste', 'time.In', 'summary', ""'m"", 'enjoying', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'moments', 'history', 'television', 'watch', 'set', 'discs', ""'m"", 'also', 'disappointed', 'treatment', 'physical', 'media', 'contents', 'received']",N/A

1327757,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0036EH3WK,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","It lasted six years and it was adventurous and surprisingly eventful. With Walt Disney and ABC Studios behind the wings, we were expecting a family series and yet at the same time rather strong in plot. And we got what we expected. Right to the end and I must say this last episode &#8220;The End&#8221; was not disappointing but totally artificial to give the last kick of life with and to a happy ending though clearly beyond death. The bucket had been kicked a last time long before and everyone was lying alive and well at least six feet underground. That final magic was possible because of two elements in the series, the first one being the axiom of it and the second one being the result of a systematic treatment.The axiom is that we are stepping beyond the real world into a world that is antipodean to anything we know in real life. It is done with a plane that crosses the wrong line one day and crashes on an island that is not listed on any map. This is close to Stephen King&#8217;s Langoliers. Planes are tricky and they can cross such magnetic limits between here and over-there, I mean the real world and the other side of it that is just as alive as ours but in an inverted terrible way with a few holes in the hedge for some rabbits to come in and out.This island is a traditional myth in American culture and you will like it tremendously. It is a permanently tropical island that is, as we finally learn at the end, volcanic and there is some kind of a cork on top of the lava tap or hole that could destroy the island with a volcanic eruption that would restructure it completely. To make that lava hole or tap a menace to the whole world is maybe excessive but it is magical because we have always been fascinated by this volcanic reality and we are struck with fear every single time we hear about such an eruption. The island is in fact a series of islands, at least two and they are a microcosm of a world in which several projects have been carried out and on which several populations are living in the most hostile way possible.  The themes of the series and this island are numerous.First a mad science project, the Dharma Initiative that wants to sound Buddhist or Asian and that wants to harness the natural and powerful energy of this volcanic force for the improvement of humanity. First it wants to control the inner force so that it would no longer influence the world, cause catastrophes. That would require the presence of a permanent colony of scientists and technicians to fulfill the task. Other crazy scientific projects exist like about the case of the fertility of women since on this island all pregnant women who were impregnated on the island will die and the baby along with them. Some scientists are brought onto the island to study and solve this problem.At the same time different people are helping up that initiative or lurking behind it because there is a profit to get out of it, a commercial profit, a scientific profit that might become commercial, etc. The economic vultures are roaming around and over this island. At the same time there could be a medical profit for it because people are cured of their diseases and healed of their wounds on this island, and yet that is not that simple since at least one, Benjamin, develops a nasty cancer there and pregnant women die of their pregnancies. But it is true Benjamin goes out of the island regularly because there is one simple and single way to get out of it: with a submarine. Another mythic element that sends us back to Jules Verne and his 20,000 leagues under the sea.There are older populations too. First a shipwrecked pregnant woman who will give birth to two twin boys will arrive one day on the island, be saved by another isolated woman who lives away from some local population that lives in very primitive conditions. The latter woman who delivers the two boys kills the mother and raises the two sons as hers. One will remain faithful to her, Jacob; one will move to the other inhabitants and will start building some way to get out of the island. The woman will destroy the village and kill all the inhabitants. Then Jacob will confront his nameless brother, kill him and send him into the volcanic hole that produces light and this brother will be transformed into a smoky revengeful spirit who will only try to get out of the island. Jacob has to select a candidate for his succession because he knows, sooner or later, his brother will manage to find a way to kill him, which happens soon enough.This nameless spirit can take the form or appearance of a dead person and he uses that trick to assume the body and identity of one of the wrecked passengers from the plane.Another group that is, as such, rather short-lived is a marooned group of US soldiers who are safe keeping an Atom bomb that was abandoned here. The point is that this group is led by a certain Richard who becomes the direct associate of Jacob and as such eternal (???). Another is named Whitmore who wants to get and take possession of the power in the island to make a profit out of it. Later on a certain Benjamin arrives and will have Whitmore expelled from the island.  This Benjamin was the son of a member of the Dharma Initiative and he will cross the line and go to the US soldiers grown more or less wild, and then with these he will eliminate the people of the Dharma Initiative and he will take their equipment over with the US soldiers and Richard as his own troops.Then several lines will give Richard a very old origin and bring a Black Rock sail boat on the island, a sort of slave ship. Another scientific mission will get marooned here too and one woman will survive and give birth to a daughter who will be stolen by Benjamin and his troops. You add a couple of polar bears in this tropical island, just for fun, and a lot of boars for food. You make Whitmore plot his come back to recapture the island, the desire of the smoky spirit to get out off the island, the intrigues coming from Jacob to select his candidates and successor, and many other events to make things more complicated and even bring a real jet on the second island and you will be lost in translation, and you will enjoy it.The second interest of the series is the survival techniques of humans who don&#8217;t seem to know what cooperation and democracy mean as soon as they are in an emergency situation. The relations between the various members of every single group are explored in detail and what&#8217;s more they have plenty of opportunity because Benjamin causes a severe disruption to the time line of the island that can shift from one time to another, going back 30 years at one time, while the real world is going on three more years. Those who had escaped had a real like during these three years and most of them are brought back thirty years back onto the island and they manage, without knowing what they are doing, to bring the island back to the time of the main catastrophe that is simply erased from the world&#8217;s record and then we have the characters leading normal lives in Los Angeles at year zero while the escapees from the island live a life that goes up to year +3, while on the island, those who were trapped there are living in year -30. And there the escapees from year +3 manage to get themselves back to year -30 where they meet those that had stayed behind on the island and had been transferred thirty years backward. Imagine the situation.That&#8217;s the most important fact of this series, the systematic treatment of the plot and story. It uses all kinds of flash-backs and flash-forwards without any real pedagogical help. We navigate from one time to another, from one group to another, from one place on the island to another and we little by little build a consciousness that gets all the time more abstract and less respectful of any time line at all. We are becoming time-obsessed timeless viewers who enjoy living in some out-of-time meta-time that is like the time line of Mars and Venus merged together forward and backward. This is possible only because we are watching a TV series. That kind of timelessness is nearly impossible with the cinema for instance and would be very difficult with a book. As for that it is a very good TV series because we are able to remain afloat in a time treatment that should drown us in a sea of pebbles bombarding our brains.The last remark is about life and death. One cannot live but with the memories form the past and what happened, happened. These recollections, even when they become unconscious are always present in your mind and they come back in some flashy impulses sooner or later and repetitively. This is quite true and Sigmund Freud would agree but it is maybe slightly too behavioral for anyone&#8217;s normal taste. People seem to be more or less doomed to start all over again their own mistakes and their own behaviors and actions. The absolute symbol of this impossibility to change is Hugo who no matter where or when he will be fat because he has become fat when he started overeating when his father left him and his mother. The coming back of his father, the winning of a lottery, his sojourn in an island where there was no fat and no chocolate bars, though they managed to get some with the left over resources of the Dharma initiative, he manages to be running around and having an extremely active wild life and yet he does not lose one gram.  But James &#8220;Sawyer&#8221; is not better. Jack the doctor is just the same, etc., etc. The best character in that line of behavioral limits is the only Black character and his son: traitor by definition, he betrays several times, manages to sell his companions in exchange of his own return to the outside world, and he will of course find himself in an impossible situation that will lead him to signing up with the wrong chap, Whitmore actually, and finding himself signed up too with Whitmore&#8217;s arch-enemy and being the saboteur employed by Benjamin within the team employed by Whitmore who are supposed to go to the island, recuperate Benjamin and destroy everything and everyone.I would not say this is racial prejudice but we must say minority people are not exactly saved. There is only one black woman that is worth anything, but she is married to a white dentist. It is amazing how Walt Disney manages to be white dominant when they are producing anything that is supposed to target the majority white family audience. And I will not insist on Sayid, the Iraqi, whose portrait and role are black and bleak and saved in the last final episode by the scruff of his neck.And then the series can rewrite the Bible over and over again, with two brothers, the elder one killing the younger one and the dead younger one trying to get his vengeance and the elder one being killed by the younger one and then entrusting other humans to finally dispose of the younger one by making him human again and thus able to die or be killed.And at the end everyone, or nearly everyone, not quite everyone though, can join in some all-faith multi-affiliation church, Buddhists, Muslims and all kinds of Christians, with Jewish symbols but no real Jewish character identified as such. And it is revealed they are all dead, which explain why Claire&#8217;s son Aaron and Sun and Yin&#8217;s daughter are not present: they had been entrusted to other living outsiders in the real world before the mother Sun and the woman Kate who had taken Aaron under her protection in the absence of the mother Claire who had stayed on the island.Then we come to this vast idea that life is death in this real world and death is life on the virtual side of this real world. We can live happily ever after because we will die and be reborn in full bliss on the virtual side of this real universe, in other words we will be reborn in the cleaned up and conflict-free recollection of the island of extreme adventure and dramatic tragedy. We can see how Walt Disney and their authors are mixing, for all faith alike, but not quite for all human ethnic groups, the Christian, Buddhist and Islamic visions of life after death and life before death reunited in one single reality that does not know what a time line is and prefers a timeless tiered spatial reality.

1327758,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B0036EH3WK,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 2]","JJ Abrams is a force to be reckoned with. Based on his work on Alias, Tom Cruise handpicked him to direct Mission Impossible 3. Getting his start with Taking Care of Business, he went on to write Regarding Henry, Gone Fishin', Armageddon, and Joy Ride before going on to create his first TV series Felicity. Taking his pedigree to another level he opted to create the series Alias, and because the studio was so please with the results they asked Abrams for a show they could practically tag: Survivor/Castaway: The Series. They had worked with another writer, and they didn't care for what he came up with, so with Abrams success they asked him.To give Abrams all the credit for Lost isn't really fair. Abrams brought in Damon Lindeloff and they went to work creating something of a long term plan and a pilot. In the end, Abrams wouldn't have had anything to do with the show beyond the season 3 premiere of the show. Early on Carlton Cuse came on as show runner, taking Abrams place. Lindeloff and Cuse still worked with the template that Lindeloff and Abrams set and that template created a global zeitgeist. Until the end of the series, Lost remained a highly watched show and a critical darling.I have to be honest and say that I didn't jump on to the Lost train until late into the show's run. After the 5th season a good friend of mine lent me all five seasons to help me catch up. Needless to say I was hooked from the start. The pilot episode alone was made for $10-14 million (which happened to get ABC exec Lloyd Braun sacked), when most pilots are made for $4 million. If it weren't for that the story of the characters would have hooked me instantly. In all honesty, that's what kept me coming back and what satisfied me in the end.Lost gets a lot of recognition for its mythology, but Lost remains brilliant because it is rooted in humanity. Through every Sci-Fi, fantasy, and religious twist of the series, there are always the characters that help the audience to ground itself. The brilliant performance of Matthew Fox (who plays Jack Shepherd), Josh Holloway (James Sawyer), Jorge Garcia (Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes), and Evangeline Lilly (Kate Austen) among others help you to connect to each of these characters and follow them through the series no matter what they face. In a series that is full of mythology that can seem `otherworldly', that is very important.As much as Lost is a human story it is also mired in aforementioned mythology. While season one is almost practically straightforward with the plight of the passengers of Oceanic 815, even season two doesn't deviate too far from the path of season one, we as an audience begin to see the cracks in the lining. This isn't meant to be a bad statement it's just that Lost jumps far beyond the typical TV show. The first couple of seasons are strictly drama before the latter four seasons delve into fantasy, Sci-Fi, and even religion. With its religious tones, Lost isn't overbearing, nor is it sacrilegious. You can tell that the writers have taken religious idealism seriously and they don't opt to trivialize it or pick a particular religious affiliation to align the show with.A lot of people were disenchanted by the last season of the show, feeling that the show runners never really had a plan for the show and came up with the least satisfying ending they could think of. I'm not part of this group. Lindeloff and Cuse have admitted that they had a broad outline that allowed them to expand on elements of the Lost-verse through time; also they were pressured to expand the series beyond their initial intentions. Even with those admissions though, the ending they came up with I found extremely satisfying for the purpose of tying up the loose strings where the characters are concerned. While they might not have tied up all the strings of the mysteries of Lost mythology, I feel that doing so was unnecessary for what the series was initially going for, which was a human story.5/5Be sure to check out:Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work!",5,Lost: The Complete Series,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,4039,"['JJ', 'Abrams', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Based', 'work', 'Alias', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'handpicked', 'direct', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '3', 'Getting', 'start', 'Taking', 'Care', 'Business', 'went', 'write', 'Regarding', 'Henry', 'Gone', 'Fishin', 'Armageddon', 'Joy', 'Ride', 'going', 'create', 'first', 'TV', 'series', 'Felicity', 'Taking', 'pedigree', 'level', 'opted', 'create', 'series', 'Alias', 'studio', 'was', 'so', 'please', 'results', 'asked', 'Abrams', 'show', 'could', 'practically', 'tag', 'Survivor/Castaway', 'Series', 'had', 'worked', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'Abrams', 'success', 'asked', 'him.To', 'give', 'Abrams', 'credit', 'Lost', ""n't"", 'really', 'fair', 'Abrams', 'brought', 'Damon', 'Lindeloff', 'went', 'work', 'creating', 'something', 'long', 'term', 'plan', 'pilot', 'end', 'Abrams', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'show', 'season', '3', 'premiere', 'show', 'Early', 'Carlton', 'Cuse', 'came', 'show', 'runner', 'taking', 'Abrams', 'place', 'Lindeloff', 'Cuse', 'still', 'worked', 'template', 'Lindeloff', 'Abrams', 'set', 'template', 'created', 'global', 'zeitgeist', 'end', 'series', 'Lost', 'remained', 'highly', 'watched', 'show', 'critical', 'darling.I', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'jump', 'Lost', 'train', 'late', 'show', 'run', '5th', 'season', 'good', 'friend', 'mine', 'lent', 'five', 'seasons', 'help', 'catch', 'up', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'hooked', 'start', 'pilot', 'episode', 'alone', 'was', 'made', '10-14', 'million', 'happened', 'get', 'ABC', 'exec', 'Lloyd', 'Braun', 'sacked', 'when', 'most', 'pilots', 'are', 'made', '4', 'million', 'were', ""n't"", 'story', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'hooked', 'instantly', 'honesty', 'what', 'kept', 'coming', 'back', 'what', 'satisfied', 'end.Lost', 'lot', 'recognition', 'mythology', 'Lost', 'brilliant', 'rooted', 'humanity', 'Sci-Fi', 'fantasy', 'religious', 'twist', 'series', 'are', 'always', 'characters', 'help', 'audience', 'ground', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'who', 'Jack', 'Shepherd', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'James', 'Sawyer', 'Jorge', 'Garcia', 'Hugo', 'Hurley', 'Reyes', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'Kate', 'Austen', 'others', 'help', 'connect', 'characters', 'follow', 'series', 'matter', 'what', 'face', 'series', 'full', 'mythology', 'can', 'seem', 'otherworldly', 'very', 'important.As', 'much', 'Lost', 'human', 'story', 'also', 'mired', 'aforementioned', 'mythology', 'season', 'one', 'almost', 'practically', 'straightforward', 'plight', 'passengers', 'Oceanic', '815', 'even', 'season', 'two', ""n't"", 'deviate', 'too', 'far', 'path', 'season', 'one', 'audience', 'begin', 'see', 'cracks', 'lining', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'bad', 'statement', 'just', 'Lost', 'jumps', 'far', 'typical', 'TV', 'show', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'are', 'strictly', 'drama', 'latter', 'four', 'seasons', 'delve', 'fantasy', 'Sci-Fi', 'even', 'religion', 'religious', 'tones', 'Lost', ""n't"", 'overbearing', 'sacrilegious', 'can', 'tell', 'writers', 'have', 'taken', 'religious', 'idealism', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'opt', 'trivialize', 'pick', 'particular', 'religious', 'affiliation', 'align', 'show', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'disenchanted', 'last', 'season', 'show', 'feeling', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'plan', 'show', 'came', 'up', 'least', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'could', 'think', ""'m"", 'not', 'part', 'group', 'Lindeloff', 'Cuse', 'have', 'admitted', 'had', 'broad', 'outline', 'allowed', 'expand', 'elements', 'Lost-verse', 'time', 'also', 'were', 'pressured', 'expand', 'series', 'initial', 'intentions', 'Even', 'admissions', 'ending', 'came', 'up', 'found', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'purpose', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'strings', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'tied', 'up', 'strings', 'mysteries', 'Lost', 'mythology', 'feel', 'doing', 'so', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'what', 'series', 'was', 'initially', 'going', 'was', 'human', 'story.5/5Be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Armadillo', 'Sands', 'Intellectual', 'Properties', 'Work']",N/A

But I no longer feel as enthused about the plots as I did before.

And LOST is what one could call a ""Case Study"" for this. You can be sure that, as you watch the first and second seasons, writers had no intent - at that time - to end the story the way they did. They didn't have a clue on how to end it. Take the time and watch actor interviews at the first and second season's end and it will become obvious.And there isn't a single hint that you can honestly say ""I could have had this whole thing figured out in the first season, had I noticed this before"" - it's probably the other way around.Another thing writers tend to do is up the stakes to incredible heights in the end (in BSG, the same happened) - so that you won't feel you've been wasting your time.If you're still not convinced writers don't have a clue how the plot is going to end, just consider this: the end is not up to the writers: it's about the audiences' expectations (namely how they feel the show should end) and producers' strategies.Keep in mind every show is a ""product"".In the end, what writers have to do is make sure that the finale they ended-up-with is somehow coherent with the first seasons. And let's face it: ending LOST the way they did is the easiest way out imaginable! they didn't even have to bother ""wrapping up"" most of the subplots: our minds will make some sense of them somehow.Perhaps my bitterness can be justified in trying to find genius and art where there is none to be found: only a product, deserving as much consideration by a specialized marketing team as a new detergent.That said, still a very decent show, considering the formulaic crap we are fed everyday.",3,""" Multi Season Syndrome""",1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,1924,"['love', 'TV', 'shows', 'probably', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'tons', 'no', 'longer', 'feel', 'enthused', 'plots', 'did', 'before', 'Especially', 'Multi', 'Season', 'shows.The', 'main', 'reason', 'because', 'most', 'times', 'not', 'time', 'responsible', 'plot', 'writers', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'LOST', 'what', 'one', 'could', 'call', 'Case', 'Study', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'writers', 'had', 'intent', 'time', 'end', 'story', 'way', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'end', 'Take', 'time', 'watch', 'actor', 'interviews', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'end', 'will', 'become', 'obvious.And', ""n't"", 'single', 'hint', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'whole', 'thing', 'figured', 'out', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'noticed', 'probably', 'other', 'way', 'thing', 'writers', 'tend', 'do', 'stakes', 'incredible', 'heights', 'end', 'BSG', 'same', 'happened', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wasting', 'time.If', ""'re"", 'still', 'not', 'convinced', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'plot', 'going', 'end', 'just', 'consider', 'end', 'not', 'up', 'writers', 'audiences', 'expectations', 'namely', 'how', 'feel', 'show', 'should', 'end', 'producers', 'strategies.Keep', 'mind', 'show', 'product', 'end', 'what', 'writers', 'have', 'do', 'make', 'sure', 'finale', 'ended-up-with', 'somehow', 'coherent', 'first', 'seasons', 'let', 'face', 'ending', 'LOST', 'way', 'did', 'easiest', 'way', 'imaginable', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'bother', 'wrapping', 'up', 'most', 'subplots', 'minds', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'somehow.Perhaps', 'bitterness', 'can', 'be', 'justified', 'trying', 'find', 'genius', 'art', 'where', 'none', 'be', 'found', 'only', 'product', 'deserving', 'as', 'much', 'consideration', 'specialized', 'marketing', 'team', 'new', 'detergent.That', 'said', 'still', 'very', 'decent', 'show', 'considering', 'formulaic', 'crap', 'are', 'fed', 'everyday']",N/A

Yes, the ""not helpful"" judgment that nine times out of ten really is a ""I don't agree with you"" judgment. But here goes....My wife and I watched Lost religiously from start to finish. At times, it seemed as if a good portion of our lives revolved around it -- discussing not only the story but storytelling technique and character realization and, well, all the fundamentals of that human monument called fiction. There were hooks galore, complications and connections that seemed so delicious, and The Big Mystery that lay there, covered by that metaphorical tarp that someday we just knew would be thrown aside to display the glorious fictional construct underneath, shining in all its glory. What a load of crap that turned out to be. My reaction parallels exactly that of another reviewer who chose to give this series only one-star. I give it three, because overall it's okay. It is a wonderful ride for most of the run. There are ups and downs, of course. The flashback stories became repetitive: Yet one more escape for Kate, another paternal betrayal of Locke, and so on. And as the layers peeled off, it seemed as if we weren't going deeper into the mystery, just sideways. In the end -- in that stupid, uninspired end -- we found out there wasn't anything at all under the tarp. No payoff, which is to my mind one of those fundamental elements of fiction. The creator and audience enter into a silent pact, an agreement that says I'll take some time from you, but the time will be spent on a wondrous journey that will leave you in a place you'll be glad you visited. Well, the journey was rather wondrous most of the time, but as the cliche goes, when we got to the end there was no there there. The producers never knew where they wanted to go; they just made it up on the fly, creating one stopgap after another, until time finally ran out. If enough time has elapsed so that you aren't particularly aware of the details of this series, you might still rent or check out from a library one season after another.

But now that I've seen the epic conclusion to LOST, well, I have no choice but to reveal the ending.  Why?  Because your lives depend on it.So I'm sure you've seen what's been aired so far.  Not-Locke (""Smocke"") is plotting his escape from the island and our beloved characters are choosing sides.  A bizarre alternate reality shows Ben as a teacher and Hurley with a tremendous dose of good luck.  Viewers are speculating whether these ""flash-sideways"" will somehow converge with the island reality, causing the characters to make even bigger decisions about how their lives should progress.  But what you the viewer should be considering instead is, what does YOUR existence mean?For this is not fantasy my friends.  Oh, no; soon YOU will be making the decision of what dimension you want to exist in.  Damon and Carlton have said all along that they've known what the final scene of LOST would look like since they started the show.  Now I know why.  They've become privy to information that, if revealed to the public at large instead of just these two talented writers, would have torn the world apart with fear and anxiety.  LOST was created to prepare us for the real 'incident' that will occur just after the final episode airs in May.On May 23rd, at 11:42p.m. (23:42 military time), a massive electromagnetic burst will hit planet Earth.  When it does, time will split into at least three separate timelines.  Depending on what you're doing at that exact moment, you will be thrust into one of these dimensions.  In one, every material object you ever wanted can be yours but you will no longer be able to love.  In another, you will be with your true love but your moral compass will be askew and you'll find yourself riddled with guilt.  And in the third, all free will must be given up but you will be guaranteed a life filled with peace.  It will be your choice.If I were you, I'd pre-order the DVD box set before the incident.

1327770,A15304WZZN6MCM,B0036EH3WK,kiae,"[11, 21]","LOST will forever be one of the greats, there isn't a doubt in my mind. Lost is a milestone that we will probably never see again, at least in our lifetime, on television. It will sit with the greats such as Seinfeld, The X-Files, Cheers, and The Twilight Zone as television that changed the future of other shows.For starters, LOST would never have lasted without the internet. It was one of the first TV shows that inspired such a cult following and transformed the internet. Never before has there been a show that created such a whirlwind on the internet. It also appealed to a wide range of people, whether you be looking for an exciting, mysterious, action-packed hour of television with light comedy sprinkled in throughout, a romantic love story with touches of science-fiction, or perhaps a thought-provoking testament of faith with emphasis on characters. Whatever your interest, LOST is for you.LOST begins with the record-setting most expensive pilot ever produced, and it doesn't disappoint. It is high intensity and will draw you in to the mysterious plot and the frightening island. However, as the series progresses, you will soon discover you care about the characters and their back-stories as much, if not more, than the plot. The gist of LOST is this: 48 people survive a plane crash and it will change their lives in ways they don't even know. Each of these people were ""bad"" people before the island. There's a criminal, a torturer, a mother who was going to give up her baby, a couple with marital issues, a doctor with a God complex and the incessant need to fix everything. That's just the beginning of a very diverse cast, each getting their own episode(s) dedicated to splicing flashbacks to life before the island and the on-island plot together, giving us the chance to connect to these people and understand them in ways we never do on any other show. We really see what drives them and what motivates them. We also see how their lives are changing rapidly. The island offers them a place of redemption, a second-chance, a place to start over and make good on their past misdeeds. That's what this show is about. It's about redemption. It's about giving a second chance. It's about letting go. It's about forgiveness. It's about these people finally coming to cope with their pasts. Of course, that's not all. Theres a very rich mythology and an on-island plot that got the world abuzz. It's mysterious. It's action packed. And this island is not as it seems. Who or what lies in the jungle? The island holds many secrets that lead to a bigger plot, one bigger than you can imagine. It's not just an island. It's a place with a rich history and an enormous secret. As you learn about the mysteries the island holds as well as the mysteries the characters hold, you will begin to make theories and predictions. It's a ton of fun.The ending was very controversial. You'll either love it or hate it. All the mysteries won't be answered, but the major ones will. It would have been impossible to answer every single question (the list is very long...it gets longer after each episode.) However, the writers don't dumb the show down. You need to watch every episode and you can't fast-forward. In true LOST fashion, the answers were given, but you'll need to dig deeper to find them. The writers give you the puzzle pieces and you'll need to put them together (don't worry, the important ones are perfectly spelled out, but if you're looking for all the answers, be prepared to go back and rewatch, but trust me, they're there.) I find myself talking to people who also watch the show and were disappointed with the lack of answers, and I'll say, in response to a particular question, ""Well remember this, this and this from season 4? Or this from season 5? Well we just learned in season 6 that this happened, so obviously the answer is _____."" And then my friend will go, ""Ohhhh! That's pretty cool. I didn't catch that."" (Of course, I'm the LOST Addict that watches each season over again.)As far as the ending in regards to story and character, it was perfect. It offered the perfect resolution and I am convinced the show has ended. It was satisfying, rich, and emotional. There will be no sequels, no movie deals, no spin-offs. The ending wrapped things up neatly and pretty much said, ""This was the story we wanted to tell and this is the ending...no if, and, or buts""...and that is something true LOST fans will really appreciate.The music is beautiful. Michael Giachinno's score is phenomenal, beautiful, intense, and emotional depending on the scene. It really is fantastic.The acting is brilliant. Terry O'Quinn (John Locke) deserves an Emmy, as do the rest of the cast, but his role was believable, heartfelt, and absolutley amazing. See Episode 4 of Season 1 and you'll just get a TASTE of what I'm talking about. It gets better as the series progresses and (no pun intended) finds itself.If you watch LOST though, there is a RULE. No looking for spoilers. The best part of the show are the twists and turns. No spoilers, don't even Google it. You'll really regret it if you do.So watch LOST. Order it now, no second thoughts. It tackles the tough questions: Can people be redeemed? It asks about faith: Are you a man of science or a man of faith? Can you BELIEVE? Well, I can definitively say, you can believe in LOST. Order it now, you'll be glad you did. If you don't know too much about the show besides my review, take a leap of faith...you'll be glad you did.",5,Lost: A Television Revolution for the Ages,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,5503,"['LOST',

1327771,AGNGN6A4N5WV3,B0036EH3WK,"Kid Icarus ""The Lad from Hades""","[4, 15]","first season was tops, 2004 was a good year in general for story telling even though writer's guild was still on strike.  Abrams sort of is a kid and well, gets carried away after seasaon three.  First off, they're are far far FAR to many NEW characters that keep popping up like Muppets in a ""capor"" from Under Jim henson's table, every season.  I liked the first batch, with Sayide, Lock, Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and co. liked all of them. and I'm not going to sit here and even list every first wave's name either,(Jin, Sun, Charlie, Hurley, his ""brother in arms""lol, Claire, miss her!, Ben, and Walt  and the summer locked chic and her metrosexual brother too.(miss her too he was a good actor anyway) the stories from that era were gripping, the best ever told! But later(post 2006 though intro of newbees was annoying even then) it was sloppy and like everything on TV, Sawyer was a woose, Kate was his boss, Jack was, well, a Jerk, Loch was getting silly so on.  And above all, I(and other audiences) were slowly then totally by 2008 loosing interest, I once eagerly awiated a season's closing/opening but lately when I am called by a friend/relative and they say ""Hey lost is on, wanna watch"" I am not even interested enough to turn on the boob tube, I instead play ""Far Cry"" a game ten times better than the new plots of lost. HA!  The writing of Abrams, once was excellent, now noting but what everyone does, he has ""gone to pot"", you might say and it shows in ""Star Trek"" The movie, what a lame!  As a capeable writer, his ""distributers"" may have had a hand in ""telling him"" what to write, I don't know, same unfortunate fated ""accident' happend to John Maxell Anderson's many flop's in the '80's like ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Family Ties"" as well as ""Diffrent Strokes"" going from funny and ""cute"" to stupid and lame with formulatic ""puns"" nobody truely cared about or they were lying to themselves if they did!  I cannot imagine a writer thinking he can get by with introducing (regulars) on a regular basis for too late in the show.  In novel writing and that goes for scripts it is stated one must NEVER introduce a ""new"" protag after about half of the book.  College Writing.  Because, put simply, it distracts the audience from what they are used too. stunns them then when they get ""warmmed up"" to a ""newbie"" you go and dump the hind quarter of the plane on them! and abandon Jack Kate, Lock, ect. and that's stupid and unrealatable! anyone with a different ""opinion"" an keep it to themselves I could care less.

1327783,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B0036EH3WK,mitchell5954,"[1, 2]","Lost is an interesting and disappointing experience. It starts off very interesting, and left me wanting more. When I finished the series, I still wanted more. Lost to me is like many Stephen King novels. They have magnificent setups, but the payoff at the end is usually underwhelming, or absolutely ridiculous. Lost is not bad, but is very underwhelming.As far as the characters go I have little complaints. All the characters get development, and lots of it. More than half of Lost comprises of flashbacks or flash forwards that develop each individual character. In a way it is a problem, because sometimes it is hard to tell who the main protagonist is. Jack is supposedly the main character, but at times Benjamin or Locke feel more like the main character. Benjamin and John Locke are my favorite characters in the series. They by far the most interesting characters in the story. However, the main villain of the story, in my opinion is a bit inconsistent and underdeveloped.The production values are great. The special effects that are used are decent as well. I really got sucked into this world.The big problem with Lost is that it sets up a lot of questions and plot elements but gives no satisfying answers, or no answers at all. The first two seasons were the best. They had a lot of mystery and intrigue. Season three and beyond were still enjoyable (except season six), but the sense of mystery was mostly gone and it did not feel the same. Season six was an utter mess. Season six, being the final season was supposed to wrap everything up, but instead raised more questions while giving very few answers. The answers they do give are lame. The finale was horrible, leaving many things unexplained.Overall, Lost is a decent show, but does not live up to the hype it builds.",3,"Great Setup, but bad payoff",1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1790,"['Lost', 'interesting', 'disappointing', 'experience', 'very', 'interesting', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'When', 'finished', 'series', 'still', 'wanted', 'more', 'Lost', 'many', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'have', 'magnificent', 'setups', 'payoff', 'end', 'usually', 'underwhelming', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'Lost', 'not', 'bad', 'very', 'underwhelming.As', 'far', 'characters', 'go', 'have', 'little', 'complaints', 'characters', 'get', 'development', 'lots', 'More', 'half', 'Lost', 'comprises', 'flashbacks', 'flash', 'forwards', 'develop', 'individual', 'character', 'way', 'problem', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'tell', 'who', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Jack', 'supposedly', 'main', 'character', 'times', 'Benjamin', 'Locke', 'feel', 'more', 'main', 'character', 'Benjamin', 'John', 'Locke', 'are', 'favorite', 'characters', 'series', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'story', 'However', 'main', 'villain', 'story', 'opinion', 'bit', 'inconsistent', 'underdeveloped.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'are', 'decent', 'well', 'really', 'got', 'sucked', 'world.The', 'big', 'problem', 'Lost', 'up', 'lot', 'questions', 'plot', 'elements', 'satisfying', 'answers', 'answers', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'best', 'had', 'lot', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'Season', 'three', 'were', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'six', 'sense', 'mystery', 'was', 'mostly', 'gone', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'same', 'Season', 'six', 'was', 'utter', 'mess', 'Season', 'six', 'being', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'supposed', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'instead', 'raised', 'more', 'questions', 'giving', 'very', 'few', 'answers', 'answers', 'do', 'give', 'are', 'lame', 'finale', 'was', 'horrible', 'leaving', 'many', 'things', 'unexplained.Overall', 'Lost', 'decent', 'show', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'hype']",N/A

1327785,A1CWV11YOHMXJ2,B0036EH3WK,Nathan L. Baker,"[1, 2]","What's that? You have an opinion of the television show LOST already formed in your brain case? Such a shame as I had quite a fantastic exploration of the show and all of its intricate subplots and themes. But, since you already know what you think about the show, I won't... okay I'll stop being lame. Look, LOST invaded our every waking thoughts (err..?) because of how wildly different it was than anything else on TV. It had mystery, mystery, Dharma beer, smoke monsters, and--most important to me, although many of you will probably say ""you're only just saying that to not feel like you were raped for 6 seasons""--deeply fascinating character arcs. What allowed it to transcend the sophomore curse was being different every year, making each season stand apart from the previous while maintaining a core identity throughout the entire run. It was always LOST, but it went from being a stranded-on-a-scary-island show to being a holy-what-the-F show (simply put, of course). So now that that's out of the way, here are my experiences with the box set.The box itself is as massive as all the other reviews have made it out to be. Do you have a PS3 slim? The LOST box set is bigger than that (if I had to guess, I'd say maybe 15% bigger but who knows). Take all the guts out of the LOST box and you could fit your PS3 inside the box. If you don't have a PS3 slim, then I'm sorry I don't have a measuring tape within my reach. The upside to the massive box: it stands out. It has cool art. It's detailed--at this size it'd have to be so you know it's worth your money. The downside is, of course, that it won't fit on your standard shelf (probably--it doesn't fit on mine). So it'll have to go somewhere out in the ""open"" and you're pretty much forced to show it off. If you don't like that idea, you can always get a disc-gear to store the discs and just put the box in the closet, but...WHY would you want to hide this box?? You take off the lid and it's like a treasure chest. You have your episode guide, which to me is underwhelming--it's dark, brief, very few pictures, and doesn't list the bonus material. You pull that out and you have the actual BD sets which come in a box probably 12 x 7 (or something). Within that box are 6 slim cardboard foldouts, each with discs in disc-slots. YUCK. I hate this method of storage, which is why I store my discs elsewhere--more on that later. (I still display the case on my out-in-the-open shelf because it is that cool looking.) But there's more! On either side of where the BD box is stored, there are side storage areas. On the one side you will find game pieces for the game that Jacob and his brother played, as well as an Ankh. On the other side you'll find a Dharma blacklight and an old-looking letter, ala Richard Alpert. Yeah they're just trinkets and probably aren't worth a dime, but they're cool! What's really cool about the box though is the underside of the lid which is a raised map of the Island. Finally, the glyphs (or whatever they are) around the edges of the box make it look like an old tomb of sorts, something that could have been buried in the island somewhere.Enough about the box. You don't care about the box probably, maybe. Maybe you do. I'd talk about it more but...The bonus disc has a couple very cool features but I almost hate to talk about it because that's against the nature of the show! It's hidden (of course, and quite cleverly) so that's all I'll say. It's worth it--it's not enough to justify selling off your season sets and getting this box set, but it's definitely cool. If you're in that boat, try to find a friend who has the complete series set.My only genuine complaint, honest to goodness, comes from the cardboard-slot disc storage. Luckily for me, only one of the discs was damaged. Season 1 disc 2 had problems on 2 episodes. You have a couple routes to take if this happens to you. 1) Contact Amazon for a replacement set. I didn't want to take this route, because what if the replacement ended up having 2 bad discs? Forget that. 2) Contact Disney (contactus@disneystudiohelp.com) and they're very cool, although slow (roughly a month), to replace your disc at no charge. So that's why I rated 4-stars. Even though I got my problem disc replaced, I still don't like the slot-storage method!Overall I'm really pleased with this set. The show looks fantastic on BD and it was nice to re-watch the series marathon-style. The mysteries of course are fantastic, but the depth of the character arcs make LOST a show that you can watch numerous times and still care about.",4,Stellar box-set for a tremendously awesome program,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,4574,"['What', 'have', 'opinion', 'television', 'show', 'LOST', 'already', 'formed', 'brain', 'case', 'shame', 'had', 'quite', 'fantastic', 'exploration', 'show', 'intricate', 'subplots', 'themes', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'okay', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'being', 'lame', 'Look', 'LOST', 'invaded', 'waking', 'thoughts', 'err..', 'how', 'wildly', 'different', 'was', 'anything', 'else', 'TV', 'had', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'Dharma', 'beer', 'smoke', 'monsters', 'most', 'important', 'many', 'will', 'probably', 'say', ""'re"", 'only', 'just', 'saying', 'not', 'feel', 'were', 'raped', '6', 'seasons', 'deeply', 'fascinating', 'character', 'arcs', 'What', 'allowed', 'transcend', 'sophomore', 'curse', 'was', 'being', 'different', 'year', 'making', 'season', 'stand', 'apart', 'previous', 'maintaining', 'core', 'identity', 'entire', 'run', 'was', 'always', 'LOST', 'went', 'being', 'stranded-on-a-scary-island', 'show', 'being', 'holy-what-the-F', 'show', 'simply', 'put', 'course', 'So', 'now', 'way', 'here', 'are', 'experiences', 'box', 'set.The', 'box', 'as', 'massive', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'made', 'be', 'Do', 'have', 'PS3', 'slim', 'LOST', 'box', 'set', 'bigger', 'had', 'guess', ""'d"", 'say', 'maybe', '15', '%', 'bigger', 'who', 'Take', 'guts', 'LOST', 'box', 'could', 'fit', 'PS3', 'box', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'PS3', 'slim', 'then', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'measuring', 'tape', 'reach', 'upside', 'massive', 'box', 'out', 'cool', 'art', 'detailed', 'size', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'so', 'know', 'money', 'downside', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fit', 'standard', 'shelf', 'probably', ""n't"", 'fit', 'mine', ""'ll"", 'have', 'go', 'somewhere', 'out', 'open', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'forced', 'show', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'can', 'always', 'get', 'disc-gear', 'store', 'discs', 'just', 'put', 'box', 'closet', 'WHY', 'would', 'want', 'hide', 'box', 'take', 'off', 'lid', 'treasure', 'chest', 'have', 'episode', 'guide', 'underwhelming', 'dark', 'brief', 'very', 'few', 'pictures', ""n't"", 'list', 'bonus', 'material', 'pull', 'out', 'have', 'actual', 'BD', 'sets', 'come', 'box', 'probably', '12', 'x', '7', 'something', 'box', 'are', '6', 'slim', 'cardboard', 'foldouts', 'discs', 'disc-slots', 'YUCK', 'hate', 'method', 'storage', 'why', 'store', 'discs', 'elsewhere', 'more', 'later', 'still', 'display', 'case', 'out-in-the-open', 'shelf', 'cool', 'looking', 'more', 'side', 'where', 'BD', 'box', 'stored', 'are', 'side', 'storage', 'areas', 'one', 'side', 'will', 'find', 'game', 'pieces', 'game', 'Jacob', 'brother', 'played', 'as', 'well', 'Ankh', 'other', 'side', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Dharma', 'blacklight', 'old-looking', 'letter', 'ala', 'Richard', 'Alpert', 'Yeah', ""'re"", 'just', 'trinkets', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'dime', ""'re"", 'cool', 'What', 'really', 'cool', 'box', 'underside', 'lid', 'raised', 'map', 'Island', 'Finally', 'glyphs', 'are', 'edges', 'box', 'make', 'look', 'old', 'tomb', 'sorts', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'buried', 'island', 'somewhere.Enough', 'box', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'box', 'probably', 'maybe', 'Maybe', 'do', ""'d"", 'talk', 'more', 'bonus', 'disc', 'couple', 'very', 'cool', 'features', 'almost', 'hate', 'talk', 'nature', 'show', 'hidden', 'course', 'quite', 'cleverly', ""'ll"", 'say', 'worth', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'selling', 'off', 'season', 'sets', 'getting', 'box', 'set', 'definitely', 'cool', ""'re"", 'boat', 'try', 'find', 'friend', 'who', 'complete', 'series', 'only', 'genuine', 'complaint', 'honest', 'goodness', 'cardboard-slot', 'disc', 'storage', 'Luckily', 'only', 'one', 'discs', 'was', 'damaged', 'Season', '1', 'disc', '2', 'had', 'problems', '2', 'episodes', 'have', 'couple', 'take', '1', 'Contact', 'Amazon', 'replacement', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'route', 'what', 'replacement', 'ended', 'up', 'having', '2', 'bad', 'discs', 'Forget', '2', 'Contact', 'Disney', 'contactus', '@', 'disneystudiohelp.com', ""'re"", 'very', 'cool', 'slow', 'roughly', 'month', 'replace', 'disc', 'charge', 'why', 'rated', '4-stars', 'Even', 'got', 'problem', 'disc', 'replaced', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'slot-storage', 'method', 'Overall', ""'m"", 'really', 'pleased', 'set', 'show', 'fantastic', 'BD', 'was', 'nice', 're-watch', 'series', 'marathon-style', 'mysteries', 'course', 'are', 'fantastic', 'depth', 'character', 'arcs', 'make', 'LOST', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'numerous', 'times', 'still', 'care']",N/A

I continued to watch LOST because of the paranormal mysteries that were hinted of having very normal explanations. Well, maybe not normal but at least logical. What was the Black Smoke? Why is Ben so important? Do the dead resurrect on the Island like Jack's father or dead means dead, like Ben's daughter? Why can it there be no children getting born on the Island? What do the Numbers mean? How was Lock able to walk again and why did he have to die at the end? Why did the statue have four fingers? And what about the polar bears, the one on the island and the other fossilized with a Dharma collar in ancient Egyptian ruins.As it turns out, the creators of the series had no clue whatsoever. They kept throwing PostIts with ancient, urban and and religious mythology on the board and THEN they tried to mold the resulting pulp of ideas into a narrative. This way, something was bound to catch your interest every week. Yet, they had no idea where the story was going. Not even at the end. Well, especially at the end.I gave the series an extra star because of the very intriguing and absorbing seasons 1 through 5. The problem with Season 6 of LOST was that, during the previous seasons, it had hooked us with so many lines that we expected either a fish or at least some uneaten bait at the end of them. Most of these lines simply ended, never to be picked up ever again.No deeper meaning. No logical explanation that can tie around everything. Just a luminous steampunk spring that ""is important"".I could not put it in words until I came across Jonathan McCalmont's Blog, Ruthless Culture: LOST was nothing but CalvinBall.

I never missed an episode and I regularly visited dozens of message boards and by the end I was a regular guest on a podcast about Lost.It was a great show, with so many fantastic mysteries that just had to lead to a big picture. Season one was fantastic, season two was great, season three slipped a little, but ended on a very high note and with the promise that everything was going to be answered with the end date the gave of 6 seasons. However, by the middle of the sixth season the writers were backtracking and trying to convince us it was about the characters.Lost had great characters, it's true, but they were only part of it. The mysteries are what kept us watching. The mysteries are why we watched the show and while things like unexplained character motivations, odd circumstance and strange events happened throughout the show you had faith in the writers that it would all come together in the end. Afterall they said it would all mean something....they promised.That didn't even remotely happen. Don't lie to yourself because if you were to rewatch the show it will still be a series of confusing, almost non-sensical events. No 15 minutes of extra footage can help that. It's not a complete story it is an exercise in using the new media and cliffhangers to create a successful television show and then use that same medium to convince loyal viewers that the reasons they watched were not really the reasons.Season 6, the final season of the show is one of the worst things to ever be on television. The show had fabulous actors, but they were all zombies in this season and not just the 2 that were supposed to be. They mindlessly walked through the sets and every episode was just stalling until the final one where the writers would give us one last twist that the flash sideways was an afterlife. Not only that, but it made the first 5 seasons unrewatchable.The writers couldn't tie any of it together so they preyed upon our emotions and tried to use it against our logical brains that were screaming ""FOUL!"". It worked on some of us, those that are praising the final season, but a very large amount of people are still fuming about this after almost 3 months. How can you try and convince me that all the things we all talked about over the last 6 years didn't matter because they all ended up together after they died? What about a cohesive plot?There is no reason to buy this box set. Most of us have the first 5 good seasons on dvd, or Itunes and they are actually free on Netflix to watch instantly. So why bother? Season 6 is worse than any Star Wars prequel or Indiana Jones by a longshot, putting it in a box with all the rest of the show doesn't change anything.",1,Stick with the 5 seasons you have and forget season 6 ever happened!,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,2795,"['was', 'biggest', 'Lost', 'fan', 'knew', 'listened', 'dozens', 'podcast', 'show', 'week', 'never', 'missed', 'episode', 'regularly', 'visited', 'dozens', 'message', 'boards', 'end', 'was', 'regular', 'guest', 'podcast', 'Lost.It', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'fantastic', 'mysteries', 'just', 'had', 'lead', 'big', 'picture', 'Season', 'one', 'was', 'fantastic', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'three', 'slipped', 'little', 'ended', 'very', 'high', 'note', 'promise', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'answered', 'end', 'date', 'gave', '6', 'seasons', 'However', 'middle', 'sixth', 'season', 'writers', 'were', 'backtracking', 'trying', 'convince', 'was', 'characters.Lost', 'had', 'great', 'characters', 'true', 'were', 'only', 'part', 'mysteries', 'are', 'what', 'kept', 'watching', 'mysteries', 'are', 'why', 'watched', 'show', 'things', 'unexplained', 'character', 'motivations', 'odd', 'circumstance', 'strange', 'events', 'happened', 'show', 'had', 'faith', 'writers', 'would', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'Afterall', 'said', 'would', 'mean', 'something', 'promised.That', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'happen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'yourself', 'were', 'rewatch', 'show', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'series', 'confusing', 'almost', 'non-sensical', 'events', '15', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'can', 'help', 'not', 'complete', 'story', 'exercise', 'using', 'new', 'media', 'cliffhangers', 'create', 'successful', 'television', 'show', 'then', 'use', 'same', 'medium', 'convince', 'loyal', 'viewers', 'reasons', 'watched', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'reasons.Season', '6', 'final', 'season', 'show', 'one', 'worst', 'things', 'ever', 'be', 'television', 'show', 'had', 'fabulous', 'actors', 'were', 'zombies', 'season', 'not', 'just', '2', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'mindlessly', 'walked', 'sets', 'episode', 'was', 'just', 'stalling', 'final', 'one', 'where', 'writers', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'last', 'twist', 'flash', 'sideways', 'was', 'afterlife', 'Not', 'only', 'made', 'first', '5', 'seasons', 'unrewatchable.The', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'tie', 'together', 'preyed', 'emotions', 'tried', 'use', 'logical', 'brains', 'were', 'screaming', 'FOUL', 'worked', 'are', 'praising', 'final', 'season', 'very', 'large', 'amount', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'fuming', 'almost', '3', 'months', 'How', 'can', 'try', 'convince', 'things', 'talked', 'last', '6', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'ended', 'up', 'together', 'died', 'What', 'cohesive', 'plot', 'reason', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'Most', 'have', 'first', '5', 'good', 'seasons', 'dvd', 'Itunes', 'are', 'actually', 'free', 'Netflix', 'watch', 'instantly', 'So', 'why', 'bother', 'Season', '6', 'worse', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequel', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'longshot', 'putting', 'box', 'rest', 'show', ""n't"", 'change', 'anything']",N/A

Have given it a preliminary going-over without checking the discs first, but there's a reason I'm doing this: it's to give some of you a ""caveat emptor"" in case you were thinking of buying it. I will add to this review at a later date.My immediate gripe with this set was threefold. The first has to do with the ankh that is included. Maybe this won't come as a surprise to some, but that ankh looks like it was carved by a 7th-grader in Wood Shop class...the picture on the front of the box set tends to lead you to believe that the ankh is an accurately-carved one. Second, the relief-map replication of the island was supposed to have been mounted on an ornately-illustrated piece of carboard--all well & good, if it weren't for the fact that it was mounted crooked! Seems like it might have been put into the box before the adhesive had actually dried!Third--and absolutely infuriating to me--is that the illustration of each season of the series' folder-style containers leads you to believe that, like the individual series box sets, the DVDs are mounted on plastic with spindles. NOT THE CASE. Just like when I ordered the box set of M*A*S*H: MARTINIS & MEDICINE, the DVDs were NOT treated with TLC by the manufacturers. Instead of the disc-friendly plastic spindles, the discs were SHOVED into those hard-cardboard slots that we all know and love so much. In the MMM collection, nearly 15 of those discs were scratched so severely that they were unplayable; fortunately for me, I have one of those automated CD/DVD repair units that, more often than not, fixes the problem. I have not yet inspected the discs in this set individually (just received it about an hour ago) but, as stated, my point here is to alert all of you to these obvious breaches of quality in a box set that otherwise appears to be very nicely put together. I'm glad I got one at such a good discount, but it's beginning to look like I got what I paid for, if you get my drift.

She might come out eventually or perhaps stay there forever.  That's a premise for another enigma series.  For me, ""Lost"" was the most engaging TV series since ""The X-Files.""  Very much like ""The X-Files,"" the first series of ""Lost"" promised much more than it could ever deliver.  If ""Lost"" had lasted two seasons, what sort of end would the writers have provided us?  Startled by the success of the show, the writers weaved complex characters with a complex plot -- thereby keeping the island afloat for seven seasons.  The program is to be applauded for its addictive nature.  Surpassing all other soap operas, ""Lost"" pressed the viewer's imagination.  That the show fluctuated in style and focus from one season to the next is forgivable.  Consistency was not one of its major strengths.  From starting out as a kind of Irwin Allen-like catastrophe and survivability premise, the show eventually drifted into the supernatural.  This drift wasn't necessarily an improvement upon season one.  If I could subtract season seven, I'd give the show a full five stars.  However, the seventh season revealed the utter bankruptcy of the writers.  Perhaps from the start, no one had a clue how to end such a bold and fatiguing journey.  This is how it seems.  To resolve the unresolvable, the writers jumped the fence, offering a hollow, fatuously transcendent end to what started off as a mere adventure series.  The strange (forced?) interconnectedness of the characters created an additional layer of mystery (and unbelievability).  Ultimately, it was the characters and the actors who grew into portraying them is what drew us back to watch every episode.  This, far more than the often-times circumlocutious storyline, is what glued the audience to the series.  Any accolades must be left at the feet of the superb acting team who created a sense of realism out of a schlocky, banged-together story.",4,Lost - One Opinion,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,2005,"['wife', 'recently', 'said', 'woman', 'entering', 'shopping', 'mall', 'pilot', 'entering', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'might', 'come', 'out', 'eventually', 'perhaps', 'stay', 'there', 'forever', 'premise', 'enigma', 'series', 'Lost', 'was', 'most', 'engaging', 'TV', 'series', 'X-Files', 'Very', 'much', 'X-Files', 'first', 'series', 'Lost', 'promised', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'ever', 'deliver', 'Lost', 'had', 'lasted', 'two', 'seasons', 'what', 'sort', 'end', 'would', 'writers', 'have', 'provided', 'Startled', 'success', 'show', 'writers', 'weaved', 'complex', 'characters', 'complex', 'plot', 'thereby', 'keeping', 'island', 'afloat', 'seven', 'seasons', 'program', 'be', 'applauded', 'addictive', 'nature', 'Surpassing', 'other', 'soap', 'operas', 'Lost', 'pressed', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'show', 'fluctuated', 'style', 'focus', 'one', 'season', 'next', 'forgivable', 'Consistency', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'major', 'strengths', 'starting', 'out', 'kind', 'Irwin', 'Allen-like', 'catastrophe', 'survivability', 'premise', 'show', 'eventually', 'drifted', 'supernatural', 'drift', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'improvement', 'season', 'one', 'could', 'subtract', 'season', 'seven', ""'d"", 'give', 'show', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'seventh', 'season', 'revealed', 'utter', 'bankruptcy', 'writers', 'Perhaps', 'start', 'one', 'had', 'clue', 'how', 'end', 'bold', 'fatiguing', 'journey', 'how', 'resolve', 'unresolvable', 'writers', 'jumped', 'fence', 'offering', 'hollow', 'fatuously', 'transcendent', 'end', 'what', 'started', 'off', 'mere', 'adventure', 'series', 'strange', 'forced', 'interconnectedness', 'characters', 'created', 'additional', 'layer', 'mystery', 'unbelievability', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'characters', 'actors', 'who', 'grew', 'portraying', 'what', 'drew', 'back', 'watch', 'episode', 'far', 'more', 'often-times', 'circumlocutious', 'storyline', 'what', 'glued', 'audience', 'series', 'accolades', 'must', 'be', 'left', 'feet', 'superb', 'acting', 'team', 'who', 'created', 'sense', 'realism', 'schlocky', 'banged-together', 'story']",N/A

1327795,A2IHQ4HPY4QR5Z,B0036EH3WK,"Ryan O'Riordan ""Platform14""","[25, 51]","Lost really dropped the ball in season 6. Having now seen the series through to completion, I among many was bitterly disappointed with the series finale. The current package art tagline, ""all the mysteries will be revealed"" does not ring true as the show's wrap up acrimoniously avoids answering the mysteries long established and left unexplained and instead cops out with an ending that fans themselves had actually bettered, in the ongoing speculation over the relevance of the ""sideways"" theme of the final season.LOST is far from a perfect show. Like many, its first season is largely considered to be its strongest and from an accessibility point, this is true. Season 2 begins to wane in quality of the story with unnecessary flashbacks which reiterate the first season stories, and superfluous storylines like Sawyer and Hurley's quest for a noise-making treefrog.Season 3 sees the show begin to rev up again, with a far more balanced year of revelation vs filler and finally, a packed season finale with genuine ""WTF!"" moments...Season 4 and 5 I consider to be the best of the show. Season 4 establishes flashing forward rather than back to characters' lives, and the introduction of compelling new characters on the island including Faraday, Charlotte and Miles. Season 5 continues the brilliance of 4 but ups the ante now crossing time and space itself, with the ensemble cast divided in completely separate positions. This year features the show's 100th episode, and the remaining episodes rev up to the last annoyingly brilliant cliffhanger.So we come to season 6. The heights of the last 2 years and elaboration of the mythology, coupled with regularly returning plot holes like Walt and DHARMA led me to have huge expectations. Yet sadly, LOST season 6 suffers from what you might call ""trilogy-itus"" so common in film series' as the last part cannot match the brilliance of what came before. Conclusions, when offered, are more logical and predictable than outstanding and the series mostly suffers from three different groups of people sitting around while not actually doing anything significant.The ending encourages you to accept their denial of answering questions, of it being irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. But it doesn't sell after 6 years of waiting for the mysteries to make sense. Up to a point, Lost is an incredibly intelligent show, that for a time demanded complete concentration and recollection on behalf of its captive audience.But 'The End' doesn't deliver, and fans are left emotionally rewarded with cheap reunions, but intellectually disappointed.

I will say this: I have not watched all of it yet. Just most of the first season and I really have struggles to push myself to watch further. The story has so many bad nuances in it, that it makes me think what kind of a person wrote this. Was he delusional, does he know anything about life and society. At least half of all the decisions the main characters make do not make sense (that fact that they are lost and cut off the rest of the world does not justify them).

Despite any shortcomings or unanswered questions, I feel it was a truly great show.  I will say a few things about the packaging.  I am also disappointed, as one other reviewer was, that this was not packaged in standard Blu Ray packaging.  I've had this problem with an X-Files 60-some-odd DVD set.  It was stored in a paper ""book"", which was really no protection at all.  Packaging for Lost is similar with this product.  I feel the necessity to buy some empty cases to protect my DVDs.  So with the Lost Blu Rays.  In fact, you can buy them here at Amazon at:  [...]There is a bonus disc, where the titles of the bonus selections are listed here in the description, but it was difficult to find.  My brilliant little 9-year-old Seth saw the Ankh with the cryptic pictures inside of it and concluded that there must be some meaning to it.  He figured out that it had something to do with the lid and in following  the paper, he was able to find the hidden Blu Ray disc in the cover of the cover!  What a smartie!  Maybe I'm just dense!Then there's the ancient Egyptian game Senet, for which rules can be found on the Internet.  It was so interesting to find such an ancient game, still surviving through the millennia.  Archaeologists think they have figured out several different possible ways in which it can be played.  My boys were just having a ball.  You can use the black light to see things on the playing board that you would not otherwise be able to see!All-in-all, a great purchase.  I would only say please replace your disc book with a special set of disc holders and put your discs in them.  You can do this for $8.00 for 10 of them on Amazon, a great prics.",5,A truly wonderful addition to your Blu Ray collection,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,1750,"['wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'show', 'shortcomings', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'feel', 'was', 'truly', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'say', 'few', 'things', 'packaging', 'am', 'also', 'disappointed', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'packaged', 'standard', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'packaging', ""'ve"", 'had', 'problem', 'X-Files', '60-some-odd', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'stored', 'paper', 'book', 'was', 'really', 'protection', 'Packaging', 'Lost', 'similar', 'product', 'feel', 'necessity', 'buy', 'empty', 'cases', 'protect', 'DVDs', 'So', 'Lost', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'fact', 'can', 'buy', 'here', 'Amazon', '[', ']', 'bonus', 'disc', 'where', 'titles', 'bonus', 'selections', 'are', 'listed', 'here', 'description', 'was', 'difficult', 'find', 'My', 'brilliant', 'little', '9-year-old', 'Seth', 'saw', 'Ankh', 'cryptic', 'pictures', 'concluded', 'must', 'be', 'meaning', 'figured', 'out', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'lid', 'following', 'paper', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'hidden', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc', 'cover', 'cover', 'What', 'smartie', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'dense', 'Then', 'ancient', 'Egyptian', 'game', 'Senet', 'rules', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Internet', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'find', 'such', 'ancient', 'game', 'still', 'surviving', 'millennia', 'Archaeologists', 'think', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'several', 'different', 'possible', 'ways', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'boys', 'were', 'just', 'having', 'ball', 'can', 'use', 'black', 'light', 'see', 'things', 'playing', 'board', 'would', 'not', 'otherwise', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'All-in-all', 'great', 'purchase', 'would', 'only', 'say', 'please', 'replace', 'disc', 'book', 'special', 'set', 'disc', 'holders', 'put', 'discs', 'can', 'do', '8.00', '10', 'Amazon', 'great', 'prics']",N/A
1327800,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B0036EH3WK,Steven Herring,"[55, 72]","LOST has been an amazing ride. Never has a show sucked me in quite like Lost. From the opening episode I knew I was hooked and I never looked back. It has the best writers on the planet and they constantly keep you on your toes as you fall in love with this strange world. I can't even start to explain the amount of depth that this show is made up of. Every episode is important as it adds something new to the mythos of the series and to the characters themselves. At its core Lost is all about it's characters. Seldom does the plot get more spotlight then the characters themselves. This leads to some amazing characters that feel like real life human beings instead of fictional creations. They are all given a fair share of the spotlight through flashbacks that tell their story before the island.Lost was never a show afraid to take risks. None of the characters were ever safe and Lost took no prisoners as main cast members meet the grave with some regularity throughout the series. It also never became stale as the actual narration theme changed every season which kept the series fresh and new every week. I won't elaborate on how the theme changed, but let's just say that every season had a unique focus. The actors all should receive a lot of praise as there is never a moment where they fail to utterly shock you with their brilliance. After all the writing would be nothing without great actors to bring these characters to life, and bring them to life they did.LOST was not always perfect though. No series is as season five was a rare point where the characters were thrust into the background as the plot itself set the pace. Lost was always best when it told its story through it's characters. The rest of the series is amazing though. Even season five where it is disappointing it still finds ways to impress you with some stellar episodes mixed in.Lost constantly referenced previous episodes, which I loved. You felt really rewarded for seeing a connection that your family or friends didn't recognize. Also there are a lot of literary referenced throughout the series along with philosophy, mythology and history. It really has a deep framework that it built its story on.The main argument to the series is the most interesting part of the show. The old science vs religion is a major theme to the series. The main character Jack is a man of science. While another character Locke is a man of faith that believes everything happens for a reason. Seeing these two men argue both points throughout the series is always top notch entertainment. All of the characters evolve greatly from the person they were in the pilot to who they are in the end, but these two have the greatest arcs as both men change to understand each others point in different ways.Now without giving anything away the series finale was brilliant. Never has a finale finished off a series so perfectly. Yes some of the answers are left to ponder, but that is one thing that makes Lost great. You have to use your brain in order to figure out some of the lesser mysteries, but I assure you there are clues to be found to figure them out. We simply haven't noticed them yet. Lost is a series that has a lot of replay value as you constantly catch pieces of the puzzle that you missed before, and with plots and characters this detailed you won't mind re-watching the series for decades to come.If you've never seen the series or are just buying it to relive the greatest series of all time I highly recommend the series to fans of serialized dramas. I envy all of you new comers to Lost as you are at the beginning of the adventure. I wish I could relive it for the first time again as it is sorely missed in my life. For the rest of us that have taken the journey already we have to use this set to remember and to let go.Update: I now have the set and I am blown away. The video quality is amazing and well worth the extra money for the blu ray. The packaging is also cool and filled with secrets of its own. The bonus features look immense and I will update you on the complete running time of the whole set.",5,Best Six years of my life!!!,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,4103,"['LOST', 'been', 'amazing', 'ride', 'Never', 'show', 'sucked', 'quite', 'Lost', 'opening', 'episode', 'knew', 'was', 'hooked', 'never', 'looked', 'back', 'best', 'writers', 'planet', 'constantly', 'keep', 'toes', 'fall', 'love', 'strange', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'start', 'explain', 'amount', 'depth', 'show', 'made', 'episode', 'important', 'something', 'new', 'mythos', 'series', 'characters', 'core', 'Lost', 'characters', 'Seldom', 'plot', 'get', 'more', 'spotlight', 'then', 'characters', 'amazing', 'characters', 'feel', 'real', 'life', 'human', 'beings', 'instead', 'fictional', 'creations', 'are', 'given', 'fair', 'share', 'spotlight', 'flashbacks', 'tell', 'story', 'island.Lost', 'was', 'never', 'show', 'afraid', 'take', 'risks', 'None', 'characters', 'were', 'ever', 'safe', 'Lost', 'took', 'prisoners', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'meet', 'grave', 'regularity', 'series', 'also', 'never', 'became', 'stale', 'actual', 'narration', 'theme', 'changed', 'season', 'kept', 'series', 'fresh', 'new', 'week', 'wo', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'how', 'theme', 'changed', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'season', 'had', 'unique', 'focus', 'actors', 'should', 'receive', 'lot', 'praise', 'never', 'moment', 'where', 'fail', 'utterly', 'shock', 'brilliance', 'writing', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'great', 'actors', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'bring', 'life', 'did.LOST', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'perfect', 'series', 'season', 'five', 'was', 'rare', 'point', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'thrust', 'background', 'plot', 'set', 'pace', 'Lost', 'was', 'always', 'best', 'when', 'told', 'story', 'characters', 'rest', 'series', 'amazing', 'Even', 'season', 'five', 'where', 'disappointing', 'still', 'ways', 'impress', 'stellar', 'episodes', 'mixed', 'in.Lost', 'constantly', 'referenced', 'previous', 'episodes', 'loved', 'felt', 'really', 'rewarded', 'seeing', 'connection', 'family', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Also', 'are', 'lot', 'literary', 'referenced', 'series', 'philosophy', 'mythology', 'history', 'really', 'deep', 'framework', 'built', 'story', 'on.The', 'main', 'argument', 'series', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'show', 'old', 'science', 'vs', 'religion', 'major', 'theme', 'series', 'main', 'character', 'Jack', 'man', 'science', 'character', 'Locke', 'man', 'faith', 'everything', 'happens', 'reason', 'Seeing', 'two', 'men', 'argue', 'points', 'series', 'always', 'top', 'notch', 'entertainment', 'characters', 'evolve', 'greatly', 'person', 'were', 'pilot', 'who', 'are', 'end', 'two', 'have', 'greatest', 'arcs', 'men', 'change', 'understand', 'others', 'point', 'different', 'ways.Now', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Never', 'finale', 'finished', 'off', 'series', 'so', 'perfectly', 'Yes', 'answers', 'are', 'left', 'ponder', 'one', 'thing', 'Lost', 'great', 'have', 'use', 'brain', 'order', 'figure', 'out', 'lesser', 'mysteries', 'assure', 'are', 'clues', 'be', 'found', 'figure', 'out', 'simply', 'have', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'yet', 'Lost', 'series', 'lot', 'replay', 'value', 'constantly', 'catch', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'missed', 'plots', 'characters', 'detailed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 're-watching', 'series', 'decades', 'come.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'buying', 'relive', 'greatest', 'series', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'fans', 'serialized', 'dramas', 'envy', 'new', 'comers', 'Lost', 'are', 'beginning', 'adventure', 'wish', 'could', 'relive', 'first', 'time', 'again', 'sorely', 'missed', 'life', 'rest', 'have', 'taken', 'journey', 'already', 'have', 'use', 'set', 'remember', 'let', 'go.Update', 'now', 'have', 'set', 'am', 'blown', 'away', 'video', 'quality', 'amazing', 'well', 'extra', 'money', 'blu', 'ray', 'packaging', 'also', 'cool', 'filled', 'secrets', 'own', 'bonus', 'look', 'immense', 'will', 'update', 'complete', 'running', 'time', 'whole', 'set']",N/A

What I liked for the most part was the character development, most of the backstories and at least the setup for various intrigues.  Unfortunately this was NOT a character driven series.  What I did not like was the failure to satisfactorily close MANY tracts and issues.  For the number of viewers invested in this show a lot more care should've been taken, but instead the viewer was exploited with the pretense of something that was never to be.  On the whole most seasons were at least ""Good"", and a few fantastic. However one thing is for certain... Season 6 is a burning mess of confusion and bad writing.  It's a shame because it was an opportunity for the writers to create closure for much of what had happened.  ""Come with me"" is used at least two to three times an episode in Season 6. Endless, pointless excursions ep after ep, back/forth and back/forth across the island usually for no worthwhile reason... characters switching loyalties countless times and for no worthwhile reason.  So many in fact that I lost track and almost lost interest completely.  When you look at season 6, other than the flash sideways scenes, most of the island scenes were basically worthless.

It came packaged in a very nice outerbox (someone already posted a picture of this already) and the entire set really has a lot of nice heft to it. I particularly liked all the raised texture you can feel all over the box, which is constructed with really high-quality paper. Opening it, on the underside of the lid is an overview map of the island, but locations aren't marked on it ... just as you might see it in the air or something.Yes, I am giving this entire set five stars. I have invested lots of my time invested in the series over several years watching it, participating in online forums and listening to several podcasts. We talked about the series amongst ourselves at great length at work. I like this series because it was interesting, added a bit of mystery and suspense, action and some fun thrills. I am certainly not going to get into a great debate over the series finale or how disappointed one would be without every single question answered.If you had questions after the finale ended, well good thing this box set came out, because several things were answered in it. You get some clues in the ""New Man in Charge"" on the season 6 features, and you get some others on the box set's exclusive disc that is hidden within the packaging. I spent my entire weekend watching that disc, and I appreciate the series even more now than I did in May when the last episode aired.This whole box set is a real labor of love from the folks at Lost and ABC. They produced a quality product with SO many extras (I never laughed so hard after watching those Lost Slap Downs on the extras discs) plus hours and hours of official Lost podcasts.The only thing I couldn't find easily were directions for the Senet game. My husband had to look that up for directions. However we spent several hours yesterday playing the game together and having a good time. He and I plan on doing an entire series rewatch soon. He rarely watches television with me since our tastes differ. I think this set again is worth the five stars because we get to spend lots of time together enjoying it.

1327811,A2G741QTPSN7H7,B0036EH3WK,Van West,"[0, 3]","I never watched the series in prime time but recently completed watching via Netflix over a period of months.I have mixed emotions about the series as a whole since I found it quite entertaining and engaging at times and a bit silly and hokey at other times.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the first few seasons were the best and it feels rushed in the last couple of seasons, as though they knew they were heading for a conclusion.The best parts come when the Oceanic 815 survivors are debating and arguing about strategy and motives, many of those involving Locke, who I think was the most intriguing of all.  I had a soft spot for Hugo and Desmond, maybe because they were the most sincere and trustworthy.  Michael Emerson is terrifically evil as Ben and delivers the best one liners.The story arc in Lost was a bit hard to follow at times with all of the time shifting and double dealing, but the use of the flashback, flash-forward, and the ""flash sideways"" were excellent ways to make me understand and care about the characters on the island.  It was sad when someone died because you had grown to like them, even with all of their faults.I haven't seen the blu-ray addition, but imagine that it is quite good.  Lost is a show that lends itself to great bonus features (I got a kick out of the ""summary in 8:15"" segments).The ""Dharma Initiative"" products that helped keep the survivors alive remind me of the old generic products that used to be on store shelves in the plain cans and boxes.

To go on loving the show for five seasons and then dismissing it comletely after the turnout of season six. The vibe that six put off made it ok for me to let the show end at the end, but luckily there are still many mysteries that are left to the viewer to be solved at the end, without the aid of any clarification.  Without a doubt in my book, the best fictional Tv series that has ever been made.These cats that hate on the ending seem to have gotten way to confused, and then forgot that this show is all about opening your mind to different possibilities, that they dismiss the whole series for the slightest possibility they can explain, and then make it out like the show made it too simple. Uh-oh, look again. I'm not saying that I figured out all the answers, but anytime I re watch an episode of the near hundred twenty hours of this program, I always feel like I'm getting something new for the whole puzzle...there is substance to everything... it's like a piece of cake that weighs the same as a brick.John Locke was a small man. Follow him from the begginig to the end, and you will see how the island seduced him into becoming the center of evil and then plays him like a pawn. I honestly love what happens to Locke in season six, as he becomes the wise cracking puppet of the smoke-- who, suprise suprise, was just trying to end up with everyones soul by the end. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't thats not really of any significance, and we'll probably never find out for certain, but its the journey, not the destination that counts here. This show is a brain melter all the way through, and always interesting and fun to follow. I'm glad I waited out on buying the DVDS because now I can just grab it all up in one swoop, with whatever extras come with.

1327815,AP3B615GM191G,B0036EH3WK,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 10]","Some quick thoughts about the six seasons included in this set...Season One (5-stars): Oceanic Flight 815 crashes on an island, and the survivors begin to discover some strange mysteries about their new place of residence.  Flashbacks detail the histories of each primary cast member and provide some of the best drama of the entire series.Season Two (5-stars): The castaways successfully open and explore the mysterious ""hatch"", while the ""Others"" begin to run elbows with the cave and beach dwellers.  Continued flashbacks indicate that the ""Losties"" are inexplicably linked in some way.Season Three (5-stars): A great deal more information is gleaned about the ""Others"", while the flashbacks continue to put the past pieces together.Season Four (5-stars): Rescue seems imminent for the Losties, but ends up adding a completely new dimension to the Island mysteries.  Flashforwards provide a fascinating glimpse into the future lives of certain cast members.Season Five (5-stars): The show takes on a more sci-fi angle as time travel is introduced and the Dharma Initiative is explained in more depth.Season Six (5-stars): The epic angle of the series is referenced throughout, as the enigmatic ""Jacob"" and the history of the Island are important topics.  Viewers are helped to understand why certain castaways were ""brought"" to the Island in the first place.I consider LOST to be the greatest TV show in television history for its ability to keep its material fresh and develop incredibly interesting characters.  I've never seen a show with the ability to produce season after season of A+ quality stories without stagnating for even a moment.
