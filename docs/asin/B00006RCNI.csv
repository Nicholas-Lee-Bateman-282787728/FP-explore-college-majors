721758,A1RVT44SHQV8EC,B00006RCNI,"Able Devildog ""jackjack5""","[40, 56]","I have been an Andre Rieu fan but not after Dreaming. It is nothing but a collection of out takes which should have been included on his other CDs.One reason I have been a Rieu fan is that his DVDs feature lively concerts. The Dreaming DVD not only does not contain a live concert, the music is dull, poorly arranged and poorly played. And there is just too damn much of Rieu and too little of the orchestra.&quot;La vie est belle&quot; is one of Rieu's better DVDs. It was a concert in Berlin. The biggest gripe I have with Rieu's DVDs is that they contain only a part of the concerts, concerts which go on for two hours but less than an hour is on the DVD. Not in Dreaming. There are no concerts, only two 42 minute segments and no interesting extra features. The first segment contains some of the later music in the &quot;La vie est belle&quot; concert. Viewers of that DVD will remember that Rieu mentions that it might rain. Well it did rain and portions are shown in Dreaming.After watching this DVD I was so disgusted that I threw the DVD in the waste basket. Then I thought again. I pulled it out because I mmight give it to someone else. But then that would be such a dirty trick to do to anyone so I again threw it in the trash.",1,Excruciatingly boring,1063929600,"09 19, 2003",2003,1239,"['have', 'been', 'Andre', 'Rieu', 'fan', 'not', 'Dreaming', 'nothing', 'collection', 'out', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'other', 'CDs.One', 'reason', 'have', 'been', 'Rieu', 'fan', 'DVDs', 'feature', 'lively', 'Dreaming', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'contain', 'live', 'concert', 'music', 'dull', 'poorly', 'arranged', 'poorly', 'played', 'just', 'too', 'damn', 'much', 'Rieu', 'too', 'little', 'orchestra.', 'quot', 'La', 'vie', 'est', 'belle', 'quot', 'one', 'Rieu', 'better', 'DVDs', 'was', 'concert', 'Berlin', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'have', 'Rieu', 'DVDs', 'contain', 'only', 'part', 'concerts', 'concerts', 'go', 'two', 'hours', 'less', 'hour', 'DVD', 'Not', 'Dreaming', 'are', 'concerts', 'only', 'two', '42', 'minute', 'segments', 'interesting', 'extra', 'features', 'first', 'segment', 'later', 'music', 'quot', 'La', 'vie', 'est', 'belle', 'quot', 'concert', 'Viewers', 'DVD', 'will', 'remember', 'Rieu', 'mentions', 'might', 'rain', 'did', 'rain', 'portions', 'are', 'shown', 'Dreaming.After', 'watching', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'disgusted', 'threw', 'DVD', 'waste', 'basket', 'Then', 'thought', 'again', 'pulled', 'out', 'mmight', 'give', 'someone', 'else', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'dirty', 'trick', 'do', 'anyone', 'so', 'again', 'threw', 'trash']",N/A
721759,A96C98SCPMWLH,B00006RCNI,Almost Sixty!,"[0, 0]","Dreaming is a departure from the norm for Andre Rieu. In two parts, it gives a more personal look at the man and the value of dreams. Commentary from him is interspersed throughout, along with dreamy music played with backdrops of castles and incredible beauty. Sometimes he performs alone, other times he has members of his orchestra around him. In one delightful scene, the orchestra members' children are near their parents as they play. In another, he describes his violin, the second one made by Stradivarius! We also learn more about his family and his father, a conductor who inspired him and then encouraged Andre's desire to convey classical music in a more colorful, inviting way to the public. I would recommend this DVD if you would enjoy 90 minutes of soothing, incredibly beautiful music.",4,Dreaming is lovely and calming...,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,802,"['Dreaming', 'departure', 'norm', 'Andre', 'Rieu', 'two', 'parts', 'more', 'personal', 'look', 'man', 'value', 'dreams', 'Commentary', 'interspersed', 'dreamy', 'music', 'played', 'backdrops', 'castles', 'incredible', 'beauty', 'Sometimes', 'alone', 'other', 'times', 'members', 'orchestra', 'one', 'delightful', 'scene', 'orchestra', 'members', 'children', 'are', 'parents', 'play', 'violin', 'second', 'one', 'made', 'Stradivarius', 'also', 'learn', 'more', 'family', 'father', 'conductor', 'who', 'inspired', 'then', 'encouraged', 'Andre', 'desire', 'convey', 'classical', 'music', 'more', 'colorful', 'inviting', 'way', 'public', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'would', 'enjoy', '90', 'minutes', 'soothing', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'music']",N/A

It starts off with oneof his own compositions and I particularly like his violin.  It is one of his older programs and I think theviolin was more prominent in his earlier work.  I love the violin and enjoy hearing him play.,5,Dreaming,1368662400,"05 16, 2013",2013,307,"['have', 'DVD', 'CD', 'Dreaming', 'absolutely', 'one', 'favorites', 'oneof', 'own', 'compositions', 'particularly', 'violin', 'one', 'older', 'programs', 'think', 'theviolin', 'was', 'more', 'prominent', 'earlier', 'work', 'love', 'violin', 'enjoy', 'hearing', 'play']",N/A

However, if you are stressed by the demands of daily life and would like an escape into a dream world of lovingly-selected music set to gorgeous European scenery, this DVD makes valium unnecessary.  Sit down with a glass of wine or chamomille tea and let Andre Rieu serenade you with this collection (made around 2000).  It's fun to see Andre's sweet, open personality as he sits cross-legged in front of a crackling fireplace, telling stories between songs.  A rare, personal, artistic look at how this sensitive man interprets his music and life.",5,A Great Escape,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,637,"['short', 'attention', 'spans', 'cynical', 'tendencies', 'not', 'suitable', 'DVD', 'However', 'are', 'stressed', 'demands', 'daily', 'life', 'would', 'like', 'escape', 'dream', 'world', 'lovingly-selected', 'music', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'European', 'scenery', 'DVD', 'valium', 'unnecessary', 'Sit', 'down', 'glass', 'wine', 'chamomille', 'tea', 'let', 'Andre', 'Rieu', 'serenade', 'collection', 'made', '2000', 'fun', 'see', 'Andre', 'sweet', 'open', 'personality', 'cross-legged', 'front', 'crackling', 'fireplace', 'telling', 'stories', 'songs', 'rare', 'personal', 'artistic', 'look', 'how', 'sensitive', 'man', 'music', 'life']",N/A
