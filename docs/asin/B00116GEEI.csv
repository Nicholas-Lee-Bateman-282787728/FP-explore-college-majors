1130017,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00116GEEI,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[5, 5]","Sadly for me anyway,this was The Cosby Show's final swansong for Lisa Bonet,who would be absent from the show by the season yet to come. As one reviewer also stated this season features the largest cast The Cosby Show ever had. This also introduces the character of Cousin Pam and her best friend Charmaine (soon to be a featured character on A Different World)-not only that but the community center where they dwelled became a platform for one of the best episodes of the season;the two part closer in which Theo,newly assigned to the center tries to encourage a young man who he believes is dyslexic as himself. There are many favorite moments to be seen on this season:one of them finds Denise and Martin looking for apartments,one of which is a cramped ""crew quarters"" with a shower in the living room. Another favorite involves the two characaters again-this time revolving around a ""battle of the sexes"" in the Huxtable clan surrounding Theo throwing the couple a bachelor party.Even the grandparents get into it with them. Another of my personal favorites is a nightmare of Rudy's after she has a fight with Olivia,featuring the youngest Huxtable imagining Olivia is a semi demonic-acting rival. There are many more but I could go on and on. One great thing about this season is,with the Huxtable kids out of the house Clair and Cliff's constant (and sometimes selfishly irritating) ribes from the previous season about all the kids leaving disappear,and the show went back to being the show it started out as. With this and the accompanying season 8 DVD collectors of this series will now be able to officially complete their Cosby Show Collection!",5,A Great Cosby Season,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,1657,"['Sadly', 'anyway', 'was', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'final', 'swansong', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'absent', 'show', 'season', 'yet', 'come', 'one', 'reviewer', 'also', 'stated', 'season', 'largest', 'cast', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'ever', 'had', 'also', 'character', 'Cousin', 'Pam', 'best', 'friend', 'Charmaine', 'soon', 'be', 'featured', 'character', 'Different', 'World', 'only', 'community', 'center', 'where', 'dwelled', 'became', 'platform', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'two', 'part', 'closer', 'Theo', 'newly', 'assigned', 'center', 'encourage', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'dyslexic', 'are', 'many', 'favorite', 'moments', 'be', 'seen', 'season', 'one', 'Denise', 'Martin', 'looking', 'apartments', 'one', 'cramped', 'crew', 'quarters', 'shower', 'living', 'room', 'favorite', 'two', 'characaters', 'again-this', 'time', 'revolving', 'battle', 'sexes', 'Huxtable', 'clan', 'surrounding', 'Theo', 'throwing', 'couple', 'bachelor', 'grandparents', 'get', 'personal', 'favorites', 'nightmare', 'Rudy', 'fight', 'Olivia', 'featuring', 'youngest', 'Huxtable', 'imagining', 'Olivia', 'semi', 'demonic-acting', 'rival', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'could', 'go', 'One', 'great', 'thing', 'season', 'Huxtable', 'kids', 'house', 'Clair', 'Cliff', 'constant', 'sometimes', 'selfishly', 'irritating', 'ribes', 'previous', 'season', 'kids', 'leaving', 'disappear', 'show', 'went', 'back', 'being', 'show', 'started', 'out', 'accompanying', 'season', '8', 'DVD', 'collectors', 'series', 'will', 'now', 'be', 'able', 'officially', 'complete', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Collection']",N/A

1130019,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B00116GEEI,andy8047,"[15, 16]","The Cosby Show's seventh season premiered on September 20,1990 with the cast at its all-time largest. Erika Alexander joins as Clair Huxtable's(Phylicia Rashad) kid cousin Pamela Tucker who moves into the Huxtable household from a Brooklyn tenement. Pamela attends the same high school as the other Huxtable kids(except Rudy) did. Vanessa(Tempest Bledsoe),who went from the sophomore to the senior level during her high school years last season,leaves the Huxtable nest to attend Lincoln University. So 11-year-old Rudy(Keshia Knight Pulliam) is the only Huxtable kid left in the household(who hasn't yet left at all). Pamela occupied Vanessa's bedroom while Vanessa was away. Rudy and Olivia Kendall(Raven Symone) still share a bedroom and so do Olivia's father Martin(Joseph C. Phillips) and his wife,the former Denise Huxtable(Lisa Bonet). Theo(Malcolm Jamal Warner) is out of the Huxtable household again and back in his girlfriend Justine Phillips'(the late Michelle Thomas,recurringly). Martin half-humorously declined being given a bachelor party by Theo and Sondra's(Sabrina LeBeauf) husband Elvin Tibidaux(Geoffrey Owens). Denise,who thought Martin DID want it,was so angry with him. This results in mild arguments between the Tibidauxs and Cliff's(Bill Cosby) parents Russell(Earle Hyman,recurringly) and Anna(Clarice Taylor,recurringly). Clair believed Theo was the cause of the arguments. This happened at a backyard barbecue held at the Huxtable home(Cliff was grilling burgers and chickens). Rudy's friend Kenny(Deon Richmond,recurringly) attended the barbecue also. I believe the highest-rated episode this season was the one where the late great John Ritter and his not-yet-girlfriend/wife Amy Yasbeck guest-starred. Ritter was Ray Evans,a basketball coach with a pregnant wife(Yasbeck). In fact,Cosby and RS were the only cast members to appear in this episode(Cosby holds the record for appearing in every episode of the series). So Ray and his wife became parents and of course were congratulated by the doctor who delivered the baby,Cliff. There's also RETURN OF THE CLAIRETTES. They are Clair and an old girlfriend of hers who's married herself. The husband was played by none other then Phylicia's real-life(now-ex)husband,football great Ahmad Rashad. Silly Olivia once laundered her crayons in the Huxtables' washer(naturally,she took for granted that would be OK for the washable crayons). In the two-part season finale,Theo worked as a substitute teacher for special education students in spite of his dyslexia. You'll also see the Tibidauxs twins Winnie and Nelson again,now age 2. The other episodes are great. As for the opening montage,the one used for season 8 was filmed and intended to be used for this season. I'm sure we'll see the recycling of the season 6 opening and closing montages in this set,with a few changes in the credits,one of them being Alexander's inauguration. We will not hear Cosby quipping,""This is the best elevator music I ever heard"",like we did in the season 6 opening. By the way,since one of the season 6 episodes premiered during the season 7 run on NBC,it will be included in this set(I don't know why it was delayed). This season finished at #5,a new low. Bonet was written out of the series for good after this season(she had been fired). Denise would only be mentioned from this point on. Also,Karen Malina White made a few recurring appearances during this season and the next/last. She would later become Mrs. Malcolm Jamal Warner,who himself was dating Thomas during this time.",5,Welcome Erika!,1197590400,"12 14, 2007",2007,3544,"['Cosby', 'Show', 'seventh', 'season', 'premiered', 'September', '20,1990', 'cast', 'all-time', 'largest', 'Erika', 'Alexander', 'Clair', 'Huxtable', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'kid', 'cousin', 'Pamela', 'Tucker', 'who', 'Huxtable', 'household', 'Brooklyn', 'tenement', 'Pamela', 'same', 'high', 'school', 'other', 'Huxtable', 'kids', 'Rudy', 'did', 'Vanessa', 'Tempest', 'Bledsoe', 'who', 'went', 'sophomore', 'senior', 'level', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'last', 'season', 'Huxtable', 'nest', 'attend', 'Lincoln', 'University', 'So', '11-year-old', 'Rudy', 'Keshia', 'Knight', 'Pulliam', 'only', 'Huxtable', 'kid', 'left', 'household', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'left', 'Pamela', 'occupied', 'Vanessa', 'bedroom', 'Vanessa', 'was', 'away', 'Rudy', 'Olivia', 'Kendall', 'Raven', 'Symone', 'still', 'share', 'bedroom', 'so', 'do', 'Olivia', 'father', 'Martin', 'Joseph', 'C.', 'Phillips', 'wife', 'former', 'Denise', 'Huxtable', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'Theo', 'Malcolm', 'Jamal', 'Warner', 'Huxtable', 'household', 'again', 'back', 'girlfriend', 'Justine', 'Phillips', 'late', 'Michelle', 'Thomas', 'recurringly', 'Martin', 'half-humorously', 'declined', 'being', 'given', 'bachelor', 'party', 'Theo', 'Sondra', 'Sabrina', 'LeBeauf', 'husband', 'Elvin', 'Tibidaux', 'Geoffrey', 'Owens', 'Denise', 'who', 'thought', 'Martin', 'DID', 'want', 'was', 'so', 'angry', 'results', 'mild', 'arguments', 'Tibidauxs', 'Cliff', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'parents', 'Russell', 'Earle', 'Hyman', 'recurringly', 'Anna', 'Clarice', 'Taylor', 'recurringly', 'Clair', 'believed', 'Theo', 'was', 'cause', 'arguments', 'happened', 'backyard', 'barbecue', 'held', 'Huxtable', 'home', 'Cliff', 'was', 'grilling', 'burgers', 'chickens', 'Rudy', 'friend', 'Kenny', 'Deon', 'Richmond', 'recurringly', 'attended', 'barbecue', 'also', 'believe', 'highest-rated', 'episode', 'season', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'late', 'great', 'John', 'Ritter', 'not-yet-girlfriend/wife', 'Amy', 'Yasbeck', 'guest-starred', 'Ritter', 'was', 'Ray', 'Evans', 'basketball', 'coach', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Yasbeck', 'fact', 'Cosby', 'RS', 'were', 'only', 'cast', 'members', 'appear', 'episode', 'Cosby', 'record', 'appearing', 'episode', 'series', 'Ray', 'wife', 'became', 'parents', 'course', 'were', 'congratulated', 'doctor', 'who', 'delivered', 'baby', 'Cliff', 'also', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'CLAIRETTES', 'are', 'Clair', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'hers', 'who', 'married', 'husband', 'was', 'played', 'none', 'other', 'then', 'Phylicia', 'real-life', 'now-ex', 'husband', 'football', 'great', 'Ahmad', 'Rashad', 'Silly', 'Olivia', 'once', 'laundered', 'crayons', 'Huxtables', 'washer', 'naturally', 'took', 'granted', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'washable', 'crayons', 'two-part', 'season', 'finale', 'Theo', 'worked', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'special', 'education', 'students', 'spite', 'dyslexia', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'Tibidauxs', 'Winnie', 'Nelson', 'again', 'now', 'age', '2', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'opening', 'montage', 'one', 'used', 'season', '8', 'was', 'filmed', 'intended', 'be', 'used', 'season', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'see', 'recycling', 'season', '6', 'opening', 'closing', 'montages', 'set', 'few', 'changes', 'credits', 'one', 'being', 'Alexander', 'inauguration', 'will', 'not', 'hear', 'Cosby', 'quipping', 'best', 'elevator', 'music', 'ever', 'heard', 'did', 'season', '6', 'opening', 'way', 'one', 'season', '6', 'episodes', 'premiered', 'season', '7', 'run', 'NBC', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', 'delayed', 'season', 'finished', '5', 'new', 'low', 'Bonet', 'was', 'written', 'series', 'good', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'fired', 'Denise', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'mentioned', 'point', 'Also', 'Karen', 'Malina', 'White', 'made', 'few', 'recurring', 'appearances', 'season', 'next/last', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'Mrs.', 'Malcolm', 'Jamal', 'Warner', 'who', 'was', 'dating', 'Thomas', 'time']",N/A

When I had a chance to introduce the show to a new generation, I was surprised how much they also enjoyed the show. Thus proving to me, The Cosby Show is TIMELESS! If you need a ""family-friendly"" purchase, that you feel comfortable watching without having to mute or fast forward, the Cosby Show is that answer. Having said that, there is one episode in season 7 that does address a rather ""adult"" subject of the degradation of women in the exotic dancing profession. Note, it's very tastefully done, but might need a quick preview of the parent(s) so they know how to respond to their child(s) questions.  Still, The Cosby Show is an excellent viewing for the whole family.",5,Cosby at his best!,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,772,"['Having', 'spent', 'formable', 'years', '1980', 'watched', 'Cosby', 'religiously', 'Thursday', 'evening', 'When', 'had', 'chance', 'introduce', 'show', 'new', 'generation', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'Thus', 'proving', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'TIMELESS', 'need', 'family-friendly', 'purchase', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'having', 'mute', 'fast', 'forward', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'answer', 'Having', 'said', 'one', 'episode', 'season', '7', 'address', 'rather', 'adult', 'subject', 'degradation', 'women', 'exotic', 'dancing', 'profession', 'Note', 'very', 'tastefully', 'done', 'might', 'need', 'quick', 'preview', 'parent', 'know', 'how', 'respond', 'child', 's', 'questions', 'Still', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'excellent', 'viewing', 'whole', 'family']",N/A
1130021,A1T9PJBFBFKSGD,B00116GEEI,Auburn Niewiadomski,"[1, 1]","Can Cliff get anybody to leave the house? Another addition is made this season, Pam. (Erika Alexander) Pam is Clair's cousin and she's come to stay. Also, Theo is working at a community center, and Rudy is in her preteens. So as you can obviously tell, the Huxtable kids are growing up. And the Cosby Show's rank in the Nielsen Ratings started going down, after five consecutive seasons of being number one, the Cosby Show was placed fifth. Now I didn't have many favorite episodes from season seven, but one I can think of is ""Clair's Liberation."" Clair enters menopause and the kids are treating her like she's losing her mind, and when Cliff and Clair realize why they're treating her so strangely, Clair decides to go along with it. Another good episode is ""Nightmare on Stigwood Avenue"", this episode follows Rudy's nightmare about Olivia getting whatever she wants. But my favorite episode from season seven is ""Total Control"", John Ritter guest stars and he's fantastic in this episode. By now everyone knows there wouldn't be any bonus features, so that's that. Each disc is in a separate case as usual but there finally is a good change, each episode has episode descriptions on the DVD episode menu, but since you may not know which episodes are on this set I'll still list them below.Same Time Next Year - Airdate: 9/20/1990 - Denise takes classes at a local college, while Vanessa enrolls at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.

Gordon ""The greatest thing we ever ha...","[2, 2]","If Season 6 of The Cosby Show was a turnaround season for the cast of characters, it also paved the way for the changes that took place in Season 7.  Here we have Vanessa and Rudy both making great changes in their lives; Rudy enters sixth grade and starts getting her period; Vanessa begins college one year before the rest of her age group.Big changes for Clair as well: she accepts her second cousin Pam Tucker into the Huxtable home and - respectively begins menapause.  We also witness Sondra beginning her law degree, Elvin starting his practice and Denise taking a serious step toward becoming a teacher.Among the season's best moments are ""Bird in the Hand,"" ""Period of Adjustment,"" ""It's All in the Game,"" ""The Infantry has Landed,"" ""You Can Go Home Again,"" ""Clair's Liberation,"" ""Return of the Clairettes,"" ""Home Remedies,"" ""Nightmare on Stigwood Avenue,"" ""Cliff and Jake"" (wonderful appearance by Red Buttons) and the two-parte season finale ""Theo and the Kids.""[I'm interested in finding out if that's really Tempestt, Erika Alexander and Karen Malina White doing the groovy Supremes-meets-Ronnettes-meets-Pointer-Sisters vocals during ""Nightmare on Stigwood Avenue.""][One could almost view the first few episodes on Disc 2 as ""The Transitional Suite.""  That's when Rudy begins her period, Denise & Martin finally get the bug to live in their own home after being married a year-and-a-half, Pam starts dating a nice boy, Clair enters menapause, and Theo learns to shake off the girls to prepare for an exam.]And then, there's the silly mistake someone made in the packaging when the titles of ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" and ""Attack of the Killer 'B's"" were mismatched.

1130026,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B00116GEEI,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[2, 2]","Rudy had always been my favorite on ""The Cosby Show"" because I was only slightly younger than her, so I connected with her the most in previous seasons. However, Erika Alexander's character, Pam, stepped on the scene, and I immediately switched gears. Although it was fun to see Lisa Bonet's character, Denise Huxtable, come back into ""The Cosby Show"" as a more responsible mother and structured student, during this season I was getting older, ""A Different World"" was on, and I wanted to know about that older generation of young adults who were going to college but still at that cool age where they were hanging out, had jobs, but weren't quite full-grown adults. This was that particular season for me.Cons: I fast forwarded through pretty much all of the shows with Olivia. Of course she was very cute, but the cutesy thing got old after a few moments. I didn't need to see the episodes where she dragged out trying to cook, sneaking cake, having an invisible dog, wanting to be president and a football player, coloring on walls, arguing with Rudy, and so forth. They were boring. I loved her in the ""Home Remedies"" episode because she took me back to the earlier episodes of the Cosby Show when Rudy was the cute one, and they did musical numbers. For awhile, this season seemed like the Cosby Show was relying on kids being cute: Sondra's twins, Olivia being an adorable but bratty younger ""sibling"", and a bunch of episodes about parents having babies. Some episodes were just flat out unnecessary like ""Adventures in Babysitting"" about a pinochle tournament and the one about bowling ""There's Still No Joy in Mudville"" and appliance shopping ""Cliff and Jake."" Zzzz.I didn't think Aaron was even remotely as interesting as Lance when it came to Pam's boyfriends though. I wish Lance would've hung around on more episodes. Although Rudy and I were going through the same stuff like getting woman parts ""Same Time Next Year"" and becoming a woman ""The Infantry Has Landed,"" I focused more on my future by watching Theo and Pam. Vanessa was in and out, and I didn't really connect with her character the way I did with Pam's.Pros: However, there were plenty of episodes that I really enjoyed. Even though the ""Nightmares on Stigwood Avenue"" was another episode of look-at-how-cute-Olivia-is, I LOVED watching Pam, Charmagne, and Vanessa perform their musical numbers. I enjoyed the history that the Cosbys always brought about the Negro Leagues, school lessons about the legal system in the 1900s and African Americans' progress, and ""You Can Go Home Again"" when Denise and Martin considered moving (they were such a cute couple).I was excited to see Theo become a professor because I got to see my short-term crush (minus Immature), the late Merlin Santana (as Stanley), and The Cosby Show got heavier. ""Theo and the Kids"" Parts 1 and 2 talked about job loss, dyslexia, and I got to see Eugene of one of my favorite childhood shows ""Chris Cross"" again. But Charmagne, Pam, Lance, and Sly were my favorites!  Pam was dealing with those issues that all young girls go through: whether to lose her virginity ""Just Thinking About It"" (Parts 1 and 2); education; where/when/how to go to college ""Attack of the Killer B's""; and wanting to hang out and avoid rules ""Period of Adjustment"". Pam's character was like a slightly more hip hop version of Theo. Any episode where those two were the main characters was a favorite for me.",4,"Erika Alexander, So Glad to See You!",1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,3429,"['Rudy', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'was', 'only', 'slightly', 'younger', 'connected', 'most', 'previous', 'seasons', 'However', 'Erika', 'Alexander', 'character', 'Pam', 'stepped', 'scene', 'immediately', 'switched', 'gears', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'character', 'Denise', 'Huxtable', 'come', 'back', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'more', 'responsible', 'mother', 'structured', 'student', 'season', 'was', 'getting', 'older', 'Different', 'World', 'was', 'wanted', 'know', 'older', 'generation', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'were', 'going', 'college', 'still', 'cool', 'age', 'where', 'were', 'hanging', 'out', 'had', 'jobs', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'full-grown', 'adults', 'was', 'particular', 'season', 'me.Cons', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'pretty', 'much', 'shows', 'Olivia', 'course', 'was', 'very', 'cute', 'cutesy', 'thing', 'got', 'old', 'few', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'episodes', 'where', 'dragged', 'out', 'trying', 'cook', 'sneaking', 'cake', 'having', 'invisible', 'dog', 'wanting', 'be', 'president', 'football', 'player', 'coloring', 'walls', 'arguing', 'Rudy', 'so', 'forth', 'were', 'boring', 'loved', 'Home', 'Remedies', 'episode', 'took', 'back', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'when', 'Rudy', 'was', 'cute', 'one', 'did', 'musical', 'numbers', 'awhile', 'season', 'seemed', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'was', 'relying', 'kids', 'being', 'cute', 'Sondra', 'twins', 'Olivia', 'being', 'adorable', 'bratty', 'younger', 'sibling', 'bunch', 'episodes', 'parents', 'having', 'babies', 'episodes', 'were', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'unnecessary', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'pinochle', 'tournament', 'one', 'bowling', 'Still', 'No', 'Joy', 'Mudville', 'appliance', 'shopping', 'Cliff', 'Jake', 'Zzzz.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Aaron', 'was', 'even', 'remotely', 'as', 'interesting', 'Lance', 'when', 'came', 'Pam', 'boyfriends', 'wish', 'Lance', 'would', ""'ve"", 'hung', 'more', 'episodes', 'Rudy', 'were', 'going', 'same', 'stuff', 'getting', 'woman', 'parts', 'Same', 'Time', 'Next', 'Year', 'becoming', 'woman', 'Infantry', 'Has', 'Landed', 'focused', 'more', 'future', 'watching', 'Theo', 'Pam', 'Vanessa', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'connect', 'character', 'way', 'did', ""Pam's.Pros"", 'However', 'were', 'plenty', 'episodes', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Even', 'Nightmares', 'Stigwood', 'Avenue', 'was', 'episode', 'look-at-how-cute-Olivia-is', 'LOVED', 'watching', 'Pam', 'Charmagne', 'Vanessa', 'perform', 'musical', 'numbers', 'enjoyed', 'history', 'Cosbys', 'always', 'brought', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'school', 'lessons', 'legal', 'system', '1900s', 'African', 'Americans', 'progress', 'Can', 'Go', 'Home', 'Again', 'when', 'Denise', 'Martin', 'considered', 'moving', 'were', 'cute', 'couple', '.I', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'Theo', 'become', 'professor', 'got', 'see', 'short-term', 'crush', 'minus', 'Immature', 'late', 'Merlin', 'Santana', 'Stanley', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'got', 'heavier', 'Theo', 'Kids', '1', '2', 'talked', 'job', 'loss', 'dyslexia', 'got', 'see', 'Eugene', 'one', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'shows', 'Chris', 'Cross', 'again', 'Charmagne', 'Pam', 'Lance', 'Sly', 'were', 'favorites', 'Pam', 'was', 'dealing', 'issues', 'young', 'girls', 'go', 'lose', 'virginity', 'Just', 'Thinking', '1', '2', 'education', 'where/when/how', 'go', 'college', 'Attack', 'Killer', 'B', 'wanting', 'hang', 'out', 'avoid', 'rules', 'Period', 'Adjustment', 'Pam', 'character', 'was', 'slightly', 'more', 'hip', 'hop', 'version', 'Theo', 'Any', 'episode', 'where', 'two', 'were', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'favorite']",N/A
