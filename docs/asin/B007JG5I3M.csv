On the end of the first movie there is a heartbreaking reference to Kurt's dad without a word being spoken! The close up filming, and Sweden country side give the show a wonderful, new style. The stories are intriguing, and the mysteries well thought out. But the best and most crucial part of the show is Wallander himself. He is such a caring, sensitive man who never stops fighting the evil of the world, no matter how much it saddens him to see it.

I was leery about the BBC Wallander series, with Kenneth Branagh playing the lead role of Kurt Wallander. I am so glad I made an exception when the series was presented on Public Television. I was hooked after the first episode.I was thrilled when the series was released on DVD and I bought the set with 9 episodes from Amazon UK. Even though I have seen most of the episodes, a few times before, I am still enjoying them again. One of the plus sides of short-term memory loss is that I can watch my favorite shows over and over as I am doing with Wallander.One of the best features of the series is the breathtaking scenery of southern Sweden. It adds a unique touch I haven't found in any other series outside of documentaries.I am so glad Branagh agreed to play Wallander.

1531803,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B007JG5I3M,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","Kenneth Branagh returns as moody Swedish police detective Kurt Wallander in the BBC production &#34;Wallander 3.  Season three adapts three more of Henning Mankill's excellent detective stories, filmed on location in Sweden with primarily a British cast.  The roughly 90 minute episodes are well-executed and suspenseful, with intricate plots.The first story is &#34;An Event in Autumn&#34; in which Kurt's plan to move into a lovely little farmhouse with his girlfriend is disrupted by the discovery of a body in the garden.  The discovery of a second body on a beach leads Wallander on a chase first after the leader of a prostitution ring, then after a faceless serial killer whose identity is in doubt for the viewer until the final minutes.In the second story, &#34;The Dogs of Riga&#34;, the discovery of the mutilated corpses of two Russian mob members at sea brings a visit by a Latvian police detective.  When the detective is murdered upon his return to Latvia, Kurt is drawn into a maze of corruption and murder in the Baltic City of Riga. The search for evidence in the detective's murder will leave Kurt with a potentially lethal dilemma: whom to trust in a former police state.  The plot for both the book and this episode seems implausible at times, but the drama and suspense are worth it.In the final episode, Kurt Wallander is reunited  with his daughter Linda, in a case that involves a schoolmate of Linda, now missing.  Kurt finds a long trail of clues leading through several murders and arsons to an unpredictable group of extremists.  The answer may lie with the wife of an old friend.These BBC productions seem always to stir a bit of controversy, either for the way they are adapted from the novels, or how they differ from the Swedish versions of the same stories.  This reviewer's advice is to enjoy them on their own terms, as quality television drama.  The Swedish scenery certainly does not hurt the production values.  It helps to understand the characters if the viewer has seen earlier seasons or has read at least a couple of the novels.

Wallander to me seems to be a different sort of police detective as he is low key, methodical and he tries to be in tune with the victims and at times even the killers.This is a two disk set of DVDs that features three stories:* An Event In Autumn - Wallander moves into a new home and as he lets out his dog in the late evening the dog finds a buried skeleton on the back of his property.  Wallander has to investigate the history of the house and try to find out who the body is and how they died.  As he digs into the case he finds a link to another crime and he begins to think that he may have a serial killer on the loose....* The Dogs Of Riga - A rubber boat washes ashore with bodies in it that have been killed Russian mob style.  Their mouths are burned out by acid as a sign they were informants who talked.  Wallander has to go to the city of Riga in Latvia as the only contact he has in that country for the case was just brutally murdered in the same way as the two men in the rubber boat.  He finds a culture of crime and police corruption that may just get him killed....* Before The Frost - A woman who was the friend of Wallander's daughter shows up late one night and is asking for his help.  As Wallander turns his back the girl disappears.  Days later Wallander is called in on a bizarre murder that also involves the killing of some swans.  Evidence leads to the fact that a religious zealot who is a pyromaniac and a known institution patient is in the area and may be part of a religious cult.....My wife and I enjoyed every one of these shows and they were entertaining and good mystery stories.  Kenneth Branagh played the role of Wallander and while he plays a different sort of role of a police officer that we are used to seeing on American TV he is very good as an actor.  The surrounding cast is also very good and the storylines were good mystery stories.  The only thing that bothered me a little was that there were so many links to Wallander's home and family and the coincidences were almost too much.  I overlooked it as I enjoyed each of the stories but it is evident. The stories are quite violent and at times the scenes can be macabre so be warned if that is not your type of film or story.These three stories are very entertaining and worth watching.

All the supporting actors are well cast as well, and their performances excellent. The direction is exquisite, and the mood a mix of patient endurance and tense expectation. And all these things -- the characters, the setting, the mood -- are enough to offset what is for me plot lines that hinge too much on coincidence, chance and oversight. If you need your story to be seamless and air tight, this disc will probably make you tear your hair out. If, on the other hand, you are drawn to atmosphere and character, this will be a very nice ride.

1531835,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007JG5I3M,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[27, 28]","Kenneth Branagh has become something of an industry chameleon and his evolution in the entertainment world has been fascinating and unpredictable to watch.  Making his name by spearheading Shakespearean adaptations (his first ""Henry V"" earned him a couple of Oscar nods for Best Director and Best Actor), he branched off into more mainstream roles before becoming an A-list director of blockbusters (Thor, anyone?).  He might not have been my first choice to play Henning Mankell's enigmatic and introspective Swedish detective Wallander, but he's come to inhabit the role quite comfortably.  He was, after all, born in Northern Ireland which is quite different (even if geographically close) than Mankell's Scandinavian protagonist.  If anything, though, he epitomizes the unstable nature and world weary despair that personifies the series of books on which these mysteries are based.  It can be a showy role, but it's also one inhabited by a quiet sadness and a distinct vulnerability.  These three movies are the third grouping in a successful series.  ""Wallander"" won a BAFTA for Best Drama series in 2009 (Branagh was Emmy nominated as well) and Branagh picked up a Best Actor BAFTA in 2010 (and was Golden Globe nominated that year).Expectations, therefore, were fairly high for this new collection.  And while not my favorites from a plotting standpoint, I enjoyed spending time with Wallander again.  I understand that the methodical pacing may not be for everyone and, admittedly, the cases seem to be getting more and more outlandish and reliant on coincidence.  But the series just has an unusual feel and setting that speaks to me.  And I find the character of Wallander inherently fascinating.  I wouldn't necessarily give this my strongest endorsement if you haven't seen the other movies.  But if you have (and you've liked them), I appreciated the character journey that Wallander continues in these adaptations.This two disc set from BBC drops just days after the series wrapped on Masterpiece Mystery.  Included in the set are (1) An Event in Autumn, (2) The Dogs of Riga, and (3) and Before The Frost.An Event in Autumn:  A terrifically macabre set-up fuels this story as Wallander discovers a young girl's skeleton in his own backyard!  Now that's a real downer.  As he starts digging into the past, he finds a link to another murder and the clues to unite the grisly crimes.  I liked that this one started out so close to home and was a real cold case.The Dogs of Riga:  This episode takes us on a field trip to Latvia.  When two bodies wash ashore, a Latvian detective investigating a drug smuggling ring crosses paths with Wallander.  Another murder has Wallander traveling to Latvia (I just like writing Latvia over and over, it so rarely comes up) where he faces opposition, suspicion, ad a culture clash before uncovering the culprits.  I definitely thought the different locale brought a interesting new perspective to the proceedings.Before The Frost:  Religious zealotry (how fun) takes center stage in this rather convoluted episode that involves arson and animal cruelty.  Of course, someone from Wallander's life just happens (oh the convenience) to have ties to the maniac at the center of this unpleasant tale.  And murder is afoot.  The most contrived of this set, it still has some stark imagery that I found striking.Again, this may not represent the best the ""Wallander"" series has had to offer.  But despite its shortcomings, I still enjoyed catching up with our hero.  About 3 1/2 stars (too much convenience and happenstance propel plots forward), I'll round up for Branagh.

What he finds, however, is a den of police corruption that he must expose in order to stay alive.A friend of Wallander's estranged daughter comes to him for help in BEFORE THE FROST, and then disappears.  It's not long before it becomes apparent that she has become involved in a religious cult that employs arson as its primary weapon.The performances in this trio of films are superb, as are the striking vistas in Sweden and Latvia against which he stories take place.The 2-disc set is from BBC Video.

1531853,ADBAJLF1ZJ0TB,B007JG5I3M,Mikey,"[1, 1]","Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Kurt Wallander is quite different to his two Swedish predecessors, Rolf Lassgrd and Krister Henriksson. The Branagh adaptations are much more focused on Wallander than the Swedish ones which give more promince to the other members of the investigating team. The Lassgrd versions are much closer to the actual books than the Branagh ones. The private life of Wallander is as it is in the books in the Lassgrd versions whereas the Branagh versions have changed some of the events, switched the order in which they happened or left them out altogether.It was a good surprise to see Danish actor Sren Malling appear in the second mystery ""The Dogs of Riga"", a story which when written in the early 1990s seemed to be an accurate portrayal of Riga at the time, but twenty years later, this 2011 attempt at the story makes it seem that Riga is still stuck in 1991. Malling will be known to viewers of BBCFour Danish series The Killing and Borgen. It seems that he is the only character who correctly pronounces Wallander unlike all the others including Wallander himself.Having the characters speak in English, but with POLIS, Vardagsrum among other Swedish words displayed on various uniforms, boxes etc, it seems odd that handwritten messages are then written in English. This leads me to the belief that surely the BBC would have been better giving Branagh another role in a UK based series which would have been cheaper to produce and more conventional than having a UK cast play Swedes speaking in English, reading English but being situated among notices and signs in Swedish. This is particularly more annoying when there are already two sets of Wallander stories already made in Sweden using Swedish actors speaking in Swedish which BBCFour have also screened the majority of with English subtitles to decent sized audiences.Maybe I prefer the pure form in the SVT and TV4 versions. Having said that TV4 who had a hand in the Henriksson versions are part of the financing for the Branagh versions too and seem to enjoy decent ratings when they screen in Sweden with Swedish subtitles.The next series will be the last and will consist of ""The White Lioness"" and ""The Troubled Man"", the latter will be a two part story.One benefit of the Branagh versions is that they have helped open up the Wallander novels to a wider readership than would have exisgted had the Branagh versions not been made, so in that respect I'm happy.Enjoy.",4,Different to the Swedish versions,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,2462,"['Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'portrayal', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'quite', 'different', 'two', 'Swedish', 'predecessors', 'Rolf', 'Lassgrd', 'Krister', 'Henriksson', 'Branagh', 'adaptations', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'focused', 'Wallander', 'Swedish', 'ones', 'give', 'more', 'promince', 'other', 'members', 'investigating', 'team', 'Lassgrd', 'versions', 'are', 'much', 'closer', 'actual', 'books', 'Branagh', 'ones', 'private', 'life', 'Wallander', 'books', 'Lassgrd', 'versions', 'whereas', 'Branagh', 'versions', 'have', 'changed', 'events', 'switched', 'order', 'happened', 'left', 'out', 'altogether.It', 'was', 'good', 'surprise', 'see', 'Danish', 'actor', 'Sren', 'Malling', 'appear', 'second', 'mystery', 'Dogs', 'Riga', 'story', 'when', 'written', 'early', '1990s', 'seemed', 'be', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Riga', 'time', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', '2011', 'attempt', 'story', 'seem', 'Riga', 'still', 'stuck', '1991', 'Malling', 'will', 'be', 'known', 'viewers', 'BBCFour', 'Danish', 'series', 'Killing', 'Borgen', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'correctly', 'Wallander', 'others', 'including', 'Wallander', 'himself.Having', 'characters', 'speak', 'English', 'POLIS', 'Vardagsrum', 'other', 'Swedish', 'words', 'displayed', 'various', 'uniforms', 'boxes', 'etc', 'odd', 'handwritten', 'messages', 'are', 'then', 'written', 'English', 'belief', 'surely', 'BBC', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'giving', 'Branagh', 'role', 'UK', 'based', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cheaper', 'produce', 'more', 'conventional', 'having', 'UK', 'cast', 'play', 'Swedes', 'speaking', 'English', 'reading', 'English', 'being', 'situated', 'notices', 'signs', 'Swedish', 'particularly', 'more', 'annoying', 'when', 'are', 'already', 'two', 'sets', 'Wallander', 'stories', 'already', 'made', 'Sweden', 'using', 'Swedish', 'actors', 'speaking', 'Swedish', 'BBCFour', 'have', 'also', 'screened', 'majority', 'English', 'subtitles', 'decent', 'sized', 'audiences.Maybe', 'prefer', 'pure', 'form', 'SVT', 'TV4', 'versions', 'Having', 'said', 'TV4', 'who', 'had', 'hand', 'Henriksson', 'versions', 'are', 'part', 'financing', 'Branagh', 'versions', 'too', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'decent', 'ratings', 'when', 'screen', 'Sweden', 'Swedish', 'subtitles.The', 'next', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'will', 'consist', 'White', 'Lioness', 'Troubled', 'Man', 'latter', 'will', 'be', 'two', 'part', 'story.One', 'benefit', 'Branagh', 'versions', 'have', 'helped', 'open', 'up', 'Wallander', 'novels', 'wider', 'readership', 'would', 'have', 'exisgted', 'had', 'Branagh', 'versions', 'not', 'been', 'made', 'so', 'respect', ""'m"", 'happy.Enjoy']",N/A

Outwardly, the detective hero of Henning Mankell's Swedish novels looks more settled. But he's still the same chronically depressive, extremely emotional man who cannot manage any detachment from his work, as we will see. The three episodes in Series 3 are ""An Event in Autumn"", based on a short story published only in the Netherlands entitled ""The Grave"", ""The Dogs of Riga"", based on the novel of the same name, and ""Before the Frost"", adapted from a novel in which Wallander's daughter Linda was the protagonist. This has been changed for the film, though Linda does make an appearance.""Wallander"" is the most extreme melodrama I've ever seen on television, and it's wearing a bit thin for me. No one constantly in a state of such emotional distress could be a homicide detective. Henning Mankell has always crafted improbable, over-the-top plots, but his conspicuous reliance on implausible coincidences is lazy writing. While Kenneth Branagh is adequate in the role of Wallander, and more cuddly than the Swedish actors who have taken the role, which helps, the films hit only one note and stick with it: Wallander on an angst-fueled tear. Only in ""The Dogs of Riga"" is Wallander's angst interrupted by his disorientation. This series needs more along the lines of plot, or depth of character, or nuance, or anything that would engage the audience. The episodes are:In ""An Event in Autumn"", Wallander moves with Vanja and Peter to an idyllic country cottage. He is soon interrupted by a call about a woman's body that washed up on the beach, in pieces, apparently the result of a ship's propeller from one of the ferries. Then Wallander's dog unearths a woman's skeleton in his new garden, the victim of a gunshot wound. The woman from the ferry is identified as Marinka Nowak (Paula Videniece), a Polish prostitute who worked in Sweden. But she was not on the passenger list. Efforts to identify the skeleton in the garden lead to a previous tenant, Jan Petrus (Con O'Neill), who ran prostitutes, but no easy answers. An improbable coincidence plays too great a role, and the motive for Marinka's murder, or if the death may have been an accident, is never clear.The bodies of two murdered Latvian men float into Ystad harbor in ""The Dogs of Riva"". Their Russian mafia tattoos indicate a connection to organized crime. A narcotics investigator, Major Karlis Liepa (Sren Malling), arrives from Riga to claim the bodies. Liepa seems to recognize the men but is evasive. Wallander and Liepa are both interested in uncovering a drug smuggling route into Sweden, and Liepa returns to Riga to follow a lead. Wallander follows shortly after but finds himself in a strange culture, under surveillance by more than one party, without knowing whom to trust. Liepa's superiors, Colonels Jazeps Putnis (Arturs Skrastins) and Aleksandr Murnieks (Zoltan Butuc) seem suspicious to him. And Liepa's wife Baiba (Ingeborga Dapkunaite) seems to need his help.""Before the Frost"" opens with a gruesome scene of swans being burned to death by a man named Jannek Langas (Paul Andrew Williams). When a hiker comes upon the scene, she meets a similar fate. That night, Anna Westin (Maimie McCoy), a childhood friend of Wallander's daughter Linda (Jeany Spark), shows up in a distressed state at the detective's home. But she flees and then disappears. Wallander traces a Bible found at the scene of the murder to Langas, a Danish paranoid schizophrenic and religious fanatic. But he is proving difficult to find, and Langas' taste for burning things in the name of God may not be confined to one man. It may have a connection to Anna. Again, an absurd coincidence is a major plot element.",3,"Nice Production Values, but Poorly Conceived Plots and a One-Note Protagonist.",1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,3852,"['Wallander', '3', 'opens', 'Kurt', 'Wallander', 'moving', 'dream', 'cottage', 'country', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'years', 'Vanja', 'Saskia', 'Reeves', 'young', 'son', 'Peter', 'Albert', 'Maris', 'Outwardly', 'detective', 'hero', 'Henning', 'Mankell', 'Swedish', 'novels', 'more', 'settled', 'still', 'same', 'chronically', 'depressive', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'manage', 'detachment', 'work', 'will', 'see', 'three', 'episodes', 'Series', '3', 'are', 'Event', 'Autumn', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'published', 'only', 'Netherlands', 'entitled', 'Grave', 'Dogs', 'Riga', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Frost', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Wallander', 'daughter', 'Linda', 'was', 'protagonist', 'been', 'changed', 'film', 'Linda', 'make', 'appearance', 'Wallander', 'most', 'extreme', 'melodrama', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'wearing', 'bit', 'thin', 'one', 'constantly', 'state', 'such', 'emotional', 'distress', 'could', 'be', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Henning', 'Mankell', 'always', 'crafted', 'improbable', 'over-the-top', 'plots', 'conspicuous', 'reliance', 'implausible', 'coincidences', 'lazy', 'writing', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'adequate', 'role', 'Wallander', 'more', 'cuddly', 'Swedish', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'role', 'films', 'hit', 'only', 'one', 'note', 'stick', 'Wallander', 'angst-fueled', 'tear', 'Only', 'Dogs', 'Riga', 'Wallander', 'angst', 'interrupted', 'disorientation', 'series', 'more', 'lines', 'plot', 'depth', 'character', 'nuance', 'anything', 'would', 'engage', 'audience', 'episodes', 'are', 'Event', 'Autumn', 'Wallander', 'Vanja', 'Peter', 'idyllic', 'country', 'cottage', 'soon', 'interrupted', 'call', 'woman', 'body', 'washed', 'up', 'beach', 'pieces', 'apparently', 'result', 'ship', 'propeller', 'one', 'ferries', 'Then', 'Wallander', 'dog', 'woman', 'skeleton', 'new', 'garden', 'victim', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'woman', 'ferry', 'identified', 'Marinka', 'Nowak', 'Paula', 'Videniece', 'Polish', 'prostitute', 'who', 'worked', 'Sweden', 'was', 'not', 'passenger', 'list', 'Efforts', 'identify', 'skeleton', 'garden', 'lead', 'previous', 'tenant', 'Jan', 'Petrus', 'Con', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'ran', 'prostitutes', 'easy', 'answers', 'improbable', 'coincidence', 'plays', 'too', 'great', 'role', 'motive', 'Marinka', 'murder', 'death', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'accident', 'never', 'clear.The', 'bodies', 'two', 'murdered', 'Latvian', 'men', 'float', 'Ystad', 'harbor', 'Dogs', 'Riva', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'tattoos', 'indicate', 'connection', 'organized', 'crime', 'narcotics', 'investigator', 'Major', 'Karlis', 'Liepa', 'Sren', 'Malling', 'Riga', 'claim', 'bodies', 'Liepa', 'recognize', 'men', 'evasive', 'Wallander', 'Liepa', 'are', 'interested', 'uncovering', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'route', 'Sweden', 'Liepa', 'returns', 'Riga', 'follow', 'lead', 'Wallander', 'shortly', 'strange', 'culture', 'surveillance', 'more', 'one', 'party', 'knowing', 'whom', 'trust', 'Liepa', 'superiors', 'Colonels', 'Jazeps', 'Putnis', 'Arturs', 'Skrastins', 'Aleksandr', 'Murnieks', 'Zoltan', 'Butuc', 'seem', 'suspicious', 'Liepa', 'wife', 'Baiba', 'Ingeborga', 'Dapkunaite', 'need', 'help', 'Frost', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'swans', 'being', 'burned', 'death', 'man', 'named', 'Jannek', 'Langas', 'Paul', 'Andrew', 'Williams', 'When', 'hiker', 'scene', 'similar', 'fate', 'night', 'Anna', 'Westin', 'Maimie', 'McCoy', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Wallander', 'daughter', 'Linda', 'Jeany', 'Spark', 'up', 'distressed', 'state', 'detective', 'home', 'then', 'disappears', 'Wallander', 'Bible', 'found', 'scene', 'murder', 'Langas', 'Danish', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenic', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'proving', 'difficult', 'find', 'Langas', 'taste', 'burning', 'things', 'name', 'God', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'confined', 'one', 'man', 'may', 'have', 'connection', 'Anna', 'Again', 'absurd', 'coincidence', 'major', 'plot', 'element']",N/A

The series picks up two years later and we do see a lack of familiar faces. Tom Hiddleston and Sadie Shimmin have both left the series and the only former police official from series one and two is Sarah Smart as Anne-Britt Hoglund.Aired in 2012 series three consists of the following episodes:""""An Event in Autumn"" has Wallander investigating when a dead pregnant woman is found washed up on the beach. The victim has ties to another dead body found in Wallender's garden where he has newly moved in with his girlfriend and her young son (Saskia Reeves reprises her role as Vanja Andersson). I loved this episode because for once we get to see Wallander happy. However, once again we have him sinking back to his former unapproachable self. (5 stars).""The Dogs of Riga"" Wallander investigates when the dead bodies of some European men are found aboard a raft. We have Wallander traveling to Lativa and investigating. I honestly found the entire plot of this one to be convoluted and also the relationship that evolves between Wallander and someone else I found to just be in bad taste. You will understand after you review this episode (3 stars).""Before the Frost"" A friend of Wallandar's daughter appears asking for his help and disappears. Wallander is finally back in touch with his daughter after what appears to be several years worth of absence between series 2 and 3. The best scenes were between Wallander and his daughter. I honestly did not care about the case he was investigating. (4.5 stars).After the darkness of series two I was hoping for some more light in this series and found episode one to be the darkest episode yet.  Episode two I found way too hard to follow, but was very happy with episode three since we finally have Wallander in a good place in his personal life.

For Fossum, it is Inspector Sejer, and for Nesbo, it is Harry Hole.
