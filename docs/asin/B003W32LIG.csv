But a good fantasy or science fiction film is right up my alley. And when that film has lots of actors I know and love from my own childhood, its even better. The Jensen Project is one of those movies.My kids and I just got this movie in the mail yesterday and of course we had to watch it that night. The story is about a sixteen year old boy whose parents are scientists who worked in a secret community of geniuses. His mother had started to develop a new nanotechnology which her mentor winds up stealing. The whole family is thrown into the dangerous game of trying to retrieve the technology before it falls in the wrong hands.  The movie is filled with lots of exciting twists and turns as well as a little romance that will keep the whole family on the edge of their seats. And what makes it even more fun for parents are the appearances of  stars like Kellie Martin (from ER and Life Goes On), Patricia Richardson (from Home Improvement) and LeVar Burton (from Star Trek the Next Generation).**Complimentary product received in exchange for an honest review***",4,Fun for Family Movie Night,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,1170,"['do', ""n't"", 'always', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movies', 'kids', 'are', 'annoying', 'border', 'ridiculous', 'good', 'fantasy', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'right', 'alley', 'when', 'film', 'lots', 'actors', 'know', 'love', 'own', 'childhood', 'even', 'better', 'Jensen', 'Project', 'one', 'movies.My', 'kids', 'just', 'got', 'movie', 'mail', 'yesterday', 'course', 'had', 'watch', 'night', 'story', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'parents', 'are', 'scientists', 'who', 'worked', 'secret', 'community', 'geniuses', 'mother', 'had', 'started', 'develop', 'new', 'nanotechnology', 'mentor', 'up', 'stealing', 'whole', 'family', 'thrown', 'dangerous', 'game', 'trying', 'retrieve', 'technology', 'wrong', 'hands', 'movie', 'filled', 'lots', 'exciting', 'twists', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'romance', 'will', 'keep', 'whole', 'family', 'edge', 'seats', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'parents', 'are', 'appearances', 'stars', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'ER', 'Life', 'Goes', 'Patricia', 'Richardson', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'LeVar', 'Burton', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', '**Complimentary', 'product', 'received', 'exchange', 'honest', 'review***']",N/A
1368072,ABC8FXLD7W528,B003W32LIG,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[3, 3]","Full of on-your-seat adventure, special effects, and an intriguing plot best describes The Jensen Project, one of the several Walmart movies released for families.Claire, her husband Matt, and their son Brody become part of an effort by a secret research group known as the Jensen Project to save mankind from being implanted with nanobytes. What happens when Brody is implanted with a nanobyte? Will the team succeed in their mission before it's too late?While not my favorite of the Walmart movies (my favorite is actually Tackling the Past, which I'll be reviewing later), The Jensen Project is fun family fare that will appeal to all ages, with the exception of the very young who will likely be scared by the nonstop action/adventure scenes. There are some lessons to be learned along the way:Brody doesn't succeed very well at following this command. He lies to get out of school and sneaks off on a mission with a Jensen Project teenage apprentice. While the movie could have done a better job at reprimanding Brody for his disobedience, The Jensen Project did a great job at showing a true-to-life family struggling with managing busy workloads and in turn putting family on the back burner. It is this depiction of not making family a priority that shows the importance of showing the ones you love most how important they are to you.There is nothing objectionable in The Jensen Project, and I would recommend it for your next family night for ages eight and above.I have added this movie to my mom-approved movie listing to my wordpress blog.",4,Full of adventure!,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1552,"['Full', 'on-your-seat', 'adventure', 'special', 'effects', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'best', 'Jensen', 'Project', 'one', 'several', 'Walmart', 'movies', 'released', 'families.Claire', 'husband', 'Matt', 'son', 'Brody', 'become', 'part', 'effort', 'secret', 'research', 'group', 'known', 'Jensen', 'Project', 'save', 'mankind', 'being', 'implanted', 'nanobytes', 'What', 'when', 'Brody', 'implanted', 'nanobyte', 'Will', 'team', 'succeed', 'mission', 'too', 'late', 'not', 'favorite', 'Walmart', 'movies', 'favorite', 'actually', 'Tackling', 'Past', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reviewing', 'later', 'Jensen', 'Project', 'fun', 'family', 'fare', 'will', 'appeal', 'ages', 'exception', 'very', 'young', 'who', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'scared', 'nonstop', 'action/adventure', 'scenes', 'are', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'way', 'Brody', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'very', 'well', 'following', 'command', 'get', 'school', 'sneaks', 'off', 'mission', 'Jensen', 'Project', 'teenage', 'apprentice', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'reprimanding', 'Brody', 'disobedience', 'Jensen', 'Project', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'true-to-life', 'family', 'struggling', 'managing', 'busy', 'workloads', 'turn', 'putting', 'family', 'back', 'burner', 'depiction', 'not', 'making', 'family', 'priority', 'importance', 'showing', 'ones', 'love', 'most', 'how', 'important', 'are', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'Jensen', 'Project', 'would', 'recommend', 'next', 'family', 'night', 'ages', 'eight', 'above.I', 'have', 'added', 'movie', 'mom-approved', 'movie', 'listing', 'wordpress', 'blog']",N/A
