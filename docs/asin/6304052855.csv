What is so great about Doctor Who is that each new actor gives his own &quot;expression&quot; to the main title role.  Each new Doctor has his own quirks, his own shadows, his own mystery about him.  Think about it, there have been eight Doctors and that is wonderful.While Tom Baker was a great Doctor, for example, he was only one of many Doctors.  I have to give Sylvester McCoy a standing ovation.  While I loved the Colin Baker stories, all of them, and I hated to see him end before he could truly shine, S MyCoy gives a new additive and a new dimension to the role of the Doctor.The Doctor by now has returned to his mystery.  Just who is the Doctor? Just what is the Doctor?  Yes we think we know where he comes from, we think we know why he left his world.  But do we?  Do we indeed?  That's what's so great about Sylvester.  He's awesome as the Doctor.  He's funny and yet he can  be almost terrifying at the same time.  Think, for example, how comical he acts at first in the Greatest Show in the Galaxy, and yet suddenly he shows that he knows just what is happening and why.Ghost Light is a wonderful additive to any and all Doctor Who collections.  The story is rich, it is advanced.  The story is haunting and so fast pace at times.  While I dont agree with the Evolution lauding of the storyline (as a Christian I am a Creationist), as a fiction story, I love how it is produced in the story.",5,This is True Doctor Who,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,1451,"['Dont', 'let', 'one', 'star', 'fool', 'What', 'so', 'great', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'new', 'actor', 'own', 'quot', 'expression', 'quot', 'main', 'title', 'role', 'new', 'Doctor', 'own', 'quirks', 'own', 'shadows', 'own', 'mystery', 'Think', 'have', 'been', 'eight', 'Doctors', 'wonderful.While', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'was', 'great', 'Doctor', 'example', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'Doctors', 'have', 'give', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'standing', 'ovation', 'loved', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'stories', 'hated', 'see', 'end', 'could', 'truly', 'shine', 'S', 'MyCoy', 'new', 'additive', 'new', 'dimension', 'role', 'Doctor.The', 'Doctor', 'now', 'returned', 'mystery', 'Just', 'who', 'Doctor', 'Just', 'what', 'Doctor', 'Yes', 'think', 'know', 'where', 'think', 'know', 'why', 'left', 'world', 'do', 'Do', 'indeed', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'Sylvester', 'awesome', 'Doctor', 'funny', 'yet', 'can', 'be', 'almost', 'terrifying', 'same', 'time', 'Think', 'example', 'how', 'comical', 'first', 'Greatest', 'Show', 'Galaxy', 'yet', 'suddenly', 'just', 'what', 'happening', 'why.Ghost', 'Light', 'wonderful', 'additive', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'collections', 'story', 'rich', 'advanced', 'story', 'haunting', 'so', 'fast', 'pace', 'times', 'dont', 'agree', 'Evolution', 'lauding', 'storyline', 'Christian', 'am', 'Creationist', 'fiction', 'story', 'love', 'how', 'produced', 'story']",Doctor Who - Ghost Light VHS

398330,ABBEL5QDVTZ7R,6304052855,Connor,"[6, 6]","Much like the Curse of Fenric, this story is maligned on Amazon, yet it is such a well-done episode in many aspects, these negative reviews are rather revolting and surprising. Ghost Light is one of McCoy's best adventures from his strong final season alongside The Curse of Fenric, Survival, and Battlefield. It is a wonder Who stopped here- it was getting good!The story is very complicated but is brilliant once you get it and it will take some time to get! Luckily, the DVD is perfect for viewing the story over and over again, and the commentary really helps along with the making of feature and the deleted scenes. The story revolves around the weird happenings at a Victorian Manse in Perivale called Gabriel Chase where evolution seems to be going faster and faster and something clearly wants that to stop. With a mirage of weird and wild characters, great sets and costumes (typical BBC), and an eerie score by Mark Ayres evoking Dracula-esque feelings, Ghost Light may be baffling but it is visually beautiful and viscerally appealing, not to mention so rewarding for those who finally figure out this interesting and fantastic story.McCoy is once again great as this new, darker Doctor, and Aldred continues to impress as Ace, who is really put up center stage this episode and we learn a load about her past. Ian Hogg is great as Josiah, and the other guest actors, for the most part, do fantastic. The actor who plays Light is hammy and the story is a bit too rushed with no throwaway lines making it hard to keep up. Overall though, my complaints are few. The story is actually creepy and very dark.It's odd Doctor Who left after Season 26 when the ante was yanked up with good production, good stories, and a new darker, more adult tone. Ghost Light is a great example of a shining late of late Who. The DVD is packed with fun features and is a must buy for fans and for those naysayers who claimed to be confused.

398331,A11GO5VA74HD8K,6304052855,Crazy Fox,"[8, 11]","One of the fun things about ""Doctor Who"" is you never know where or when you'll end up next. Right from the start, the show's basic premise delightfully freed writers from the constraining laws of time and space, and that's as true of ""Ghost Light"" as it was before and (thankfully now) since. The laws of basic storytelling are another matter entirely, however. Adaptable as they are in style and fashion, they remain ironclad and immutable in substance no matter whether it's 1969 or 1989, regardless of whether the Doctor finds himself gallivanting about right here on Earth or on a distant planet, in the forgotten past or the unforeseen future--or, as the case may be, rural England in 1883. The writer and (more importantly) the script editor of ""Ghost Light"" blithely ignore all this, I'm afraid, whether from sheer laziness or a misplaced sense of what constitutes cutting-edge creativity I'm not quite certain, though I suspect the latter. In any case, the storyline (if I may call it that) suffers as a result, and what might potentially have been a great Doctor Who adventure winds up instead an unsatisfying muddled mess, a rough draft masquerading as a finished product.What makes this story so confusing? Lots of things, probably, but the key fault seems to be that the many different characters and their interrelationships are never clarified properly and so the overall significance of their words and actions remains almost utterly opaque to the viewer even as the final credits start rolling. Some mystery is good at the beginning, even preferable of course, but gradually the Doctor should unravel that mystery for himself (which he does, apparently) AND for the viewer, if by no other means then by the tried-and-true method of having him explain matters to the viewer's proxy, the Doctor's human traveling companion. Yes, borderline sexist or not, ""Ghost Light"" cries out like a banshee for one of those paternalistic moments when the companion looks confused and the Doctor kindly starts in ""well, you see, Jo..."" (or Ace, as the case may be)--these can be done quite well, too, actually, as we've already seen in another storyline from the McCoy era, ""Remembrance of the Daleks"", and that was for classic arch-enemies whom only the newest viewer would be unfamiliar with while all of the characters in our storyline here (quite a few at that, oh dear) are prior unknowns requiring some level of exposition at least. An attentive script editor would've made sure such exposition was forthcoming as well as probably advising against a dull defused climax in which the Doctor stops the obsessive-compulsive Light from wiping out all life on earth by basically just talking him out of it. Our hypothetical attentive script editor might also have taken our fledgling writer aside and kindly clued him in that assassinating Queen Victoria (as per Josiah's evil scheme) would not have ipso facto overthrown the British government: the royals have this whole bloodline succession thing so that when one dies another promptly fills the role, y'know, and anyway there's still the Prime Minister and Parliament and all.So is ""Ghost Light"" a total flop? Not entirely. Perhaps its most redeeming feature is the set design and costuming. Leave it to the BBC to get this down to a tee, but everything is wonderfully authentic and historically accurate so that you do really feel like all this sound and fury signifying whatever is sure enough transpiring in the Victorian era. The controversy surrounding Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection are part and parcel of this Victorian ambiance and yet are thoroughly integrated into the excuse for a plot in sophisticated and clever ways, most especially linking up with the inorganically alien Light's job stress and accompanying motivation to bring some stability and order to Earth's ever burgeoning profusion of lifeforms by wiping them all out (this by the way is probably one of the most uniquely weirdest and morbidly comical motivations for a ""villain"" in television history). Sylvester McCoy takes a befuddled script and makes the most of it, doing a fine job as the Doctor and still showing an immense talent for convincingly shifting from goofy to serious in a double-heartbeat in ways that almost send a chill down your spine. A perfect showcase for this occurs when Ace realizes the Doctor has kindly surprised her by taking her back to the past of a house that was her worst nightmare (kind of unsettling behavior on his part), and she asks him bitterly if there aren't things he hates: watch as he replies first with such silly offhand things as burnt toast and bus stations and then adds unrequited love, tyranny, and cruelty to the list with such utter conviction that it's like he's feeling these awful things deep down in his bones even as he utters them. A dramatically brilliant moment almost buried in the very undramatic and unbrilliant clutter around it.Finally, ""Ghost Light"" is somewhat important in terms of the show's historical development as a whole, focusing much as it does on the character and the past of the Doctor's human traveling companion, Ace. This was quite rather unusual and unprecedented at the time and was remarked as such, whereas with ""Doctor Who"" today it's a definite and prominent aspect of the show's format, especially with Rose and her circle of family and friends. In hindsight we can see this storyline as a transitional one in that regard. That said, any attempt to therefore use it to get young fans of only the new series interested in classic Who would be sorely misguided and would doubtlessly backfire. No, this one's mainly for ""Doctor Who"" DVD collectors every bit as obsessively completist as the Light and of course for diehard fans (such as myself, admittedly) who love this show even when it totally drops the ball.",3,"""Never mind.

The new series revived my interest however and I've found myself dipping back into the well, so-to-speak. This was the first Sylvester McCoy story I had ever seen but I was intrigued after reading the conflicting reviews. First off, the production quality might be even worse than '70s-era Pertwee and Tom Baker episodes. Despite any restoration that might have taken place, the videotape appears to be melting away in front of your eyes as you watch. My first impression of McCoy -- not bad, although his companion, the lantern-jawed Ace is less than, IMHO. As for the story...hmmm, I'm still mulling it over. Despite the many explanations from apologists about the mysterious and experimental nature of the tale...let's just say I believe the whole thing, at three episodes, is rushed and...missing something. Still, it's not without it's charms, I suppose. The DVD features an interesting documentary that doesn't really shine much ""light"" on the subject -- at least I didn't think so.

But getting past that the story does suffer from not enough exposition of the bad guys.  Often times, one deosn't require much exposition but just enough to know what they are.I had no real idea of who or what Josiah was, I kind of got he was evolving from the reference to his husks.  And Control, I thought Control was the ship's computer.  Still, even with the confusion over the narrative, all the performances are fun to watch.  Esp. Michael Cochrane as a confused explorer sort (no wonder he's confused, considering the story he's been written into).I think the big thing that makes the story suffer is in 1989 they didn't have the special effects to make the Angel of Light creepy enough.  What's here is fairly creepy but never quite reaches chilling except for in the deleted scenes.I never really enjoyed Sophie Aldred as the street smart companion, as people who are street smart tend to annoy me, but in this story she is much better and she doesn't wear that horrid bomber jacket, I believe it has one scene and it is draped over a chair.Sylvester McCoy, I always enjoy his performance. I think he's probably the best Doctor since Tom Baker.  But again, in spite of his performance, there seems to be something missing of his character from this story.I still think it is worth it for the Doctor Who fan (especially one who missed the original airing) but the casual fan  may be left with cold feeling and probably rightly so.",4,Not really as creepy as it should be but...,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,1704,"['odd', 'never', 'saw', 'story', 'PBS', 'run', 'so', 'real', 'treat', 'buy', 'watch', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'DVD', 'later', 'years', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen.The', 'biggest', 'critique', 'music', 'dialog', 'several', 'points', 'same', 'Fenric', 'getting', 'story', 'suffer', 'not', 'enough', 'exposition', 'bad', 'guys', 'Often', 'one', 'deos', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'exposition', 'just', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'are.I', 'had', 'real', 'idea', 'who', 'what', 'Josiah', 'was', 'kind', 'got', 'was', 'evolving', 'reference', 'husks', 'Control', 'thought', 'Control', 'was', 'ship', 'computer', 'Still', 'even', 'confusion', 'narrative', 'performances', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'Esp', 'Michael', 'Cochrane', 'confused', 'explorer', 'sort', 'wonder', 'confused', 'considering', 'story', 'been', 'written', '.I', 'think', 'big', 'thing', 'story', 'suffer', '1989', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'Angel', 'Light', 'creepy', 'enough', 'What', 'here', 'fairly', 'creepy', 'never', 'quite', 'chilling', 'deleted', 'scenes.I', 'never', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Sophie', 'Aldred', 'street', 'smart', 'companion', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'street', 'smart', 'tend', 'annoy', 'story', 'much', 'better', ""n't"", 'wear', 'horrid', 'bomber', 'jacket', 'believe', 'one', 'scene', 'draped', 'chair.Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'always', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'think', 'probably', 'best', 'Doctor', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'again', 'spite', 'performance', 'be', 'something', 'missing', 'character', 'story.I', 'still', 'think', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'missed', 'original', 'airing', 'casual', 'fan', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'cold', 'feeling', 'probably', 'rightly', 'so']",Doctor Who - Ghost Light VHS

Putting aside the fact that if you're obsessing over the plot-logic in a Doctor Who story, you're probably watching the wrong show, I figured the plot out on my first viewing of the story on VHS, having read/heard relatively little about the serial except that it was allegedly hard to comprehend but that the production values and acting were generally good.Obviously, the latter point is very much accurate, with a quality of acting and production values at very much the same level as the ""serious dramas"" the BBC was selling to Masterpiece Theatre at the time. The former assertion, though, is just nonsense as the story is in fact rather straightforward. Indeed, it feels every bit like a classic Doctor Who set-up, except perhaps that McCoy's more proactive Doctor is clearly driving events more so than in other eras of the show. In short, the remnants of an alien survey expedition share a mysterious house in Perivale with an even more dangerous force, and the Doctor wants to find out what they're all up to before too many people get hurt. I didn't need DVD extras or even the Target novelization to work this out.Regarding the script, which many critics seem to single out for derision, I find it to be among the best of the ""original"" series' entire run up there with Douglas Adams and company's hallowed ""City of Death,"" David Whitaker's ""The Crusade"" and Robert Holmes' ""The Caves of Androzani."" In particular, I find that it strikes a wonderful balance between verbal (and visual) wit and an edge of darkness to make it clear that the stakes are high. Script aside, what I find most amusing about the story is that at its heart what people seem to be criticizing it for is that it's a case where the production team assumed Doctor Who's viewers were smart enough to get it without having every element underlined and emphasized on-screen.

What was most disappointing, though, was the big build-up to some unfathomable villain who simply never materialized.  The character Light was interesting, but hardly a villain. True, he wanted to extinguish all life (and if he really was ""Light"", presumably he could do that) - but it was only because he'd grown weary of having to constantly re-catalogue everything rather than from any malevolent intent.  The character Control was even a bigger disappointment in that she seemed to be, if not a villain at least an entity that would have to be seriously dealt with before the day could be saved.  But no, a fancy pinafore was all it took to subdue her.  Bottom line: having concepts as characters never quite works out.

As a child she felt an evil that caused her to set fire to the old house and the Doctor decides to go and visit the house when it still had residents which just happen to be about a hundred years ago.The house while during the day is rather quiet it is the night in which the residents come to life. Josiah Samuel Smith owner of the home is about to entertain Reverend Matthews who is against Smith's views on evolotuion. Meanwhile Mrs. Prtichet the night house maid along with the other night servents are trying to keep famous hunter Redvers Fenn-Cooper and guest of Smith from roaming about and losing his mind.The Doctor and Ace encounter Nimrod a neaderthal butler who seems to be in Smith's employ and Smith's ward a young lady Gwendoline who rather likes Ace's modern thinking. The Doctor is trying to make sense of the strange things going on around him and why it is forbidden for anyone to enter the cellar of the home save for Smith or Nimrod. The Doctor is trying  to figure out what Smith's agenda is and the only one making any sense is Fenn-Cooper and all he seems to care about is hunting the biggest game of his life and all he seems to be looking at is a picture of Queen Victoria.Meanwhile in the very cellar of the house a being who refers to itself as ""Control"" has become loose within the home and clearly it want's something or someone and Ace seems to be the only one to get near it to make any sense of what it wants. What the Doctor and Ace discover is an anceotn spaceship that came to Earth at a point when Nimrod and his people still roamed it. And Control wasn't the only thing trapped within the ship but something else something that even Smith still fears to this day.Can the Doctor and Ace figure out what is truly happening in this house? Will Smith plans come to happen? Will Fenn-Cooper score the biggest game of all? Will Control finally be able to get what it wants?

398342,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,6304052855,Jason A. Miller,"[11, 18]","This is one of those stories that turned me into a ""Star Trek"" fan.  Honestly.  My first golden age for loving ""Doctor Who"" came between the ages of 11 and 14.  After that I started to outgrow the show (until college), but still watched weekly PBS airings on autopilot.  I even survived ""Time and the Rani"", the first airing of which I found so painful that after 30 minutes, I turned off the TV and inventoried a cigar box full of the 1980 Topps baseball card set instead.  Who needs Bonnie Langford when you have Rick Langford in a kelly green baseball jersey?I even managed to miss ""Ghost Light"" the one and only time my PBS station aired it.  I did, however, buy the novelization in 1990, and struggled through it.  The only positive thing I took away was Nimrod.  I even wrote an college admission essay about him (""Describe one historical person you'd like to spend an afternoon with"") and got accepted into SUNY Geneseo, although I didn't end up going there.""Ghost Light"", when I finally caught up with it on late-night PBS in 1994, then had the honor of being the last of the complete ""Doctor Who"" episodes I saw -- even later than ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" -- until ""Rose"" came out on BitTorrent this year.However, the DVD set of ""Ghost Light"" is a keeper.  Even if you don't like the story, the DVD provides enough grist for an amusing review (see all below entries).  The subtitles are a vast improvement on the US VHS release, the one where Control wanted her ""frames"".  The text commentary is by Martin Wiggins, not Richard Molesworth, so you know it's going to come out of left field with some great trivia.Mark Ayres, of all people, turns out to be the MVP of the audio commentary, as he critiques his own score (and check out his above quote).  The talking over the first episode drags under a few too many unrelated anecdotes, but it improves when all involved announce, at the beginning of Part Two, that they're going to try to explain things.  I will say this is the fourth time I've seen the story (fifth, if you count the novelization), and I never knew exactly what Josiah's role in the survey team was supposed to be until last night.  It's also interesting to hear from Andrew Cartmel, who laughs so enthusiastically at the gruesome fate of episode straw man Rev. Ernest Matthews.  Can we please remake this episode with Sen. Bill Frist in that role?The 45-minute making of feature intercuts interviews with the Doctor and Ace, Ayres and Cartmel, and four cast members.  Also well done is the edited Marc Platt convention panel from 1990 -- editing like this might have come in handy on the ""Curse of Fenric"" DVD!  The raw studio footage (""Shooting Ghosts"") reinforces just how tedious it must have been to be director Alan Wareing, who looks about as thrilled to be there as a retired police sergeant relegated to junior high school assistant principal.One of my criteria for judging a work of fiction is: am I rooting for the bad guys?  If I am, it's good stuff.  The bad guys here are too much of a mixed bag.  Gwendoline's motivation from scene to scene connects together about as well as the color scheme in Tom Baker's scarf.  Granted, I like her song, but there's just no reason for her at the end of Part One to stop killing people long enough to play the piano for an audience of none.  Josiah never becomes a real threat, not in those Professor Horatio Huffnagle dark goggles.  Light could be called a human anticlimax, were he human.

398344,A37UPPF989N4EB,6304052855,"JKO ""A Doctor Who Viewer""","[9, 14]","Another pair of titles from the Doctor Who library hit the DVD stands and although drawn from different eras of the programmes lengthy history, there is (unusually) a strong connection between the two that makes them an ideal pair for simultaneous release.The Leisure Hive from 1980 is the very first story to be produced and broadcast by the show's longest running producer, the highly controversial John Nathan-Turner. Ghostlight, made and broadcast nine years later was his last and indeed the last of the original series twenty-seven year run. It wouldn't be for another sixteen years that Doctor Who made it back onto UK screens in a regular series.Seeing both shows again now really highlights quite clearly the long and drawn out demise of the original series and the reasons for the inevitable cancellation. When The Leisure Hive hit the UK's BBC1 on August 30, 1980, it was in many ways the dawn of a new era. The previous three years under the aegis of producer Graham Williams had seen the show degenerate into a rather slapstick version of itself with strong storylines often let down by weak production values, design and tongue-in-cheek performances from the assembled cast, including the lead actors themselves. With the departure of both Williams and script editor Douglas Adams (on his way to greatness with The Hitchhiker's Guides) a new broom literally swept through the programme and brought some much needed seriousness and higher production values to the show. The commentary by actress Lalla Ward (Romana), Lovett Bickford (the director) and Christopher H. Bidmead (the script editor) recalls many of the changes taking place at this time and other contributions from the costume designers, graphics, special effects gurus and musicians who worked to give the show a much needed overhaul, share in this sense of excitement and regeneration. But already the signs of the problems with the new producer are evident. As everyone involved with this DVD reluctantly admit, Nathan-Turner had a great eye for visuals and PR, but had very little regard for storylines or scripts. Or at least a sense of what would or wouldn't work. Indeed, the fact that the scripts for The Leisure Hive barely fill the required four twenty-five minute episode slots is indicative of his inability in this area.Three Doctors later and Ghostlight features Sylvester McCoy as the Time Lord in the final death throes of a once great show. Here the problem is that the scripts are too long and far too complex for their intended broadcast length and savage cuts along the way during production only add to the show's mess. Again, the commentary (this time by actress Sophie Aldred (Ace), script editor Andrew Cartmel, musician Mark Ayres and author Marc Platt) goes a long way to revealing the behind the scenes problems in getting the programme to air.But that's not to say there isn't a lot to enjoy in both of these stories. Ghostlight in particular has a lot going for it, as long as you don't try too hard to understand what's going on! The writer and editor are perplexed as to why anyone should be confused, whereas everyone else contributing to the DVD, including all the lead actors, make it clear they haven't a clue what's going on! The set design, acting and direction is really first rate and was a good example of Cartmel's vision for the show, trying to bring more mystery back into the character of the Doctor and the stories themselves. It's in many ways a shame that it proved to be the end of the road. The optimism of The Leisure Hive also makes for enjoyable viewing and again the design and guest cast make it a very watchable adventure.For me, the most interesting, but also the saddest part of The Leisure Hive DVD is Lalla Ward's commentary. Opening her second season as Time Lady Romana, the show was made just months before her ill-fated and short-lived marriage to her co-star and Doctor number four, Tom Baker. Clearly, nearly twenty-five years later, she has a great deal of ill feeling towards her former husband and this spills out repeatedly as she describes the show for the DVD audience. Thankfully, the Ghostlight commentary helps explain what on Earth is going on, but in all honesty, I'm still none the wiser!Great to see the Doctor Who collection growing on DVD and if you're a fan of the show, these will be invaluable additions to your collection. If you're not, there's a lot to enjoy here and it's well worth the entrance fee! As always, the effort put into the extras is in no way diminishing with various sound options and a slew of new interviews and out-takes available. But is it just me, or are the DVD covers for the Doctor Who series getting cheaper and nastier with each release?",5,First and Last for Who's final Producer,1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,4725,"['pair', 'titles', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'library', 'hit', 'DVD', 'stands', 'drawn', 'different', 'eras', 'programmes', 'lengthy', 'history', 'unusually', 'strong', 'connection', 'two', 'ideal', 'pair', 'simultaneous', 'release.The', 'Leisure', 'Hive', '1980', 'very', 'first', 'story', 'be', 'produced', 'broadcast', 'show', 'longest', 'running', 'producer', 'highly', 'controversial', 'John', 'Nathan-Turner', 'Ghostlight', 'made', 'broadcast', 'nine', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'last', 'indeed', 'last', 'original', 'series', 'twenty-seven', 'year', 'run', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'sixteen', 'years', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'made', 'back', 'UK', 'screens', 'regular', 'series.Seeing', 'shows', 'again', 'now', 'really', 'highlights', 'quite', 'clearly', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'demise', 'original', 'series', 'reasons', 'inevitable', 'cancellation', 'When', 'Leisure', 'Hive', 'hit', 'UK', 'BBC1', 'August', '30', '1980', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'dawn', 'new', 'era', 'previous', 'three', 'years', 'aegis', 'producer', 'Graham', 'Williams', 'had', 'seen', 'show', 'degenerate', 'rather', 'slapstick', 'version', 'strong', 'storylines', 'often', 'let', 'down', 'weak', 'production', 'values', 'design', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'performances', 'assembled', 'cast', 'including', 'lead', 'actors', 'departure', 'Williams', 'script', 'editor', 'Douglas', 'Adams', 'way', 'greatness', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guides', 'new', 'broom', 'literally', 'swept', 'programme', 'brought', 'much', 'needed', 'seriousness', 'higher', 'production', 'values', 'show', 'commentary', 'actress', 'Lalla', 'Ward', 'Romana', 'Lovett', 'Bickford', 'director', 'Christopher', 'H.', 'Bidmead', 'script', 'editor', 'many', 'changes', 'taking', 'place', 'time', 'other', 'contributions', 'costume', 'designers', 'graphics', 'special', 'effects', 'gurus', 'musicians', 'who', 'worked', 'give', 'show', 'much', 'needed', 'overhaul', 'share', 'sense', 'excitement', 'regeneration', 'already', 'signs', 'problems', 'new', 'producer', 'are', 'evident', 'everyone', 'involved', 'DVD', 'reluctantly', 'admit', 'Nathan-Turner', 'had', 'great', 'eye', 'visuals', 'PR', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'regard', 'storylines', 'scripts', 'least', 'sense', 'what', 'would', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'Indeed', 'fact', 'scripts', 'Leisure', 'Hive', 'barely', 'fill', 'required', 'four', 'twenty-five', 'minute', 'episode', 'slots', 'indicative', 'inability', 'area.Three', 'Doctors', 'later', 'Ghostlight', 'features', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'Time', 'Lord', 'final', 'death', 'throes', 'once', 'great', 'show', 'Here', 'problem', 'scripts', 'are', 'too', 'long', 'far', 'too', 'complex', 'intended', 'broadcast', 'length', 'savage', 'cuts', 'way', 'production', 'only', 'show', 'mess', 'Again', 'commentary', 'time', 'actress', 'Sophie', 'Aldred', 'Ace', 'script', 'editor', 'Andrew', 'Cartmel', 'musician', 'Mark', 'Ayres', 'author', 'Marc', 'Platt', 'long', 'way', 'revealing', 'scenes', 'problems', 'getting', 'programme', 'air.But', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'lot', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'Ghostlight', 'particular', 'lot', 'going', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'writer', 'editor', 'are', 'perplexed', 'why', 'anyone', 'should', 'be', 'confused', 'everyone', 'else', 'contributing', 'DVD', 'including', 'lead', 'actors', 'make', 'clear', 'have', ""n't"", 'clue', 'what', 'going', 'set', 'design', 'acting', 'direction', 'really', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'good', 'example', 'Cartmel', 'vision', 'show', 'trying', 'bring', 'more', 'mystery', 'back', 'character', 'Doctor', 'stories', 'many', 'ways', 'shame', 'proved', 'be', 'end', 'road', 'optimism', 'Leisure', 'Hive', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'again', 'design', 'guest', 'cast', 'make', 'very', 'watchable', 'most', 'interesting', 'also', 'saddest', 'part', 'Leisure', 'Hive', 'DVD', 'Lalla', 'Ward', 'commentary', 'Opening', 'second', 'season', 'Time', 'Lady', 'Romana', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'months', 'ill-fated', 'short-lived', 'marriage', 'co-star', 'Doctor', 'number', 'four', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Clearly', 'nearly', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'later', 'great', 'deal', 'ill', 'feeling', 'former', 'husband', 'out', 'repeatedly', 'show', 'DVD', 'audience', 'Thankfully', 'Ghostlight', 'commentary', 'explain', 'what', 'Earth', 'going', 'honesty', ""'m"", 'still', 'none', 'wiser', 'Great', 'see', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'collection', 'growing', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'fan', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'invaluable', 'additions', 'collection', ""'re"", 'not', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'here', 'well', 'entrance', 'fee', 'always', 'effort', 'put', 'extras', 'way', 'diminishing', 'various', 'sound', 'options', 'slew', 'new', 'interviews', 'out-takes', 'available', 'just', 'are', 'DVD', 'covers', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'getting', 'cheaper', 'nastier', 'release']",Doctor Who -

398345,A15K1QU7XE1Z9A,6304052855,John Liosatos,"[4, 14]","Admittedly, I have not bought, or will not buy, Ghost Light on DVD.  I did own the VHS at one point, but have since donated it on to a friend, just to get it out of my collection. You see, it was taking up far too much valuable space which could be used for other more worthy Doctor Who titles, preferably from the first six Doctors.  In a sense, this colossal waste of space could be considered addition by subtraction.  Fortunately, the aforementioned friend still considers me a friend.  He didn't even charge me to take it off my hands.  Ghost Light ranks right up there with The Happiness Patrol (notice how I refrained from calling it Crappiness Patrol) as the absolute  worst Doctor Who ever.  That is, until series three of the new series, but that's for another review.  We'll simply refer to this as the armpit of the classic series.  Light needing to wipe out the human race because its evolution was making his encyclopedia outdated. What trash!  If that isn't the dumbest storyline ...  Why not do a story about a villain killing people who refuse to be happy ... Oh wait ... That's already been tried ...  Who wrote during the McCoy era?  And little annoying Ace, the worst companion ever, sulks when not blowing things up.  She's so miserable that you gotta wonder how she managed to escape being offed in The Happiness Patrol.  I never thought another companion could make me long for Melanie Bush.I'm ready for the negative votes from McCoy apologists, so bring them on.

I'm actually a very big Doctor Who fan and I had never seen Ghostlight. When I finally had a chance to see this I was truly disappointed. This long running serial had so many excellent stories that this is about the poorest example of it. For anyone thinking of watching Doctor Who for the first time give this story a go by.While watching this it appears that after Tom Baker the serial began to take a wrong turn somewhere. For those who have never seen the Doctor, start with any Tom Baker stories instead and there are plenty of DVDs available with him in it. The blame can be placed on many people for the wrong turn, sometimes I think it is producer John Nathan Turner who was on the job for far too long, but it goes deeper than that.It would be fair to explain the plot of Ghostlight, but I'm actually doing the reader a favor not doing so. It really is a convoluted drama that starts and goes nowhere. For those who don't know, the Doctor is an alien who travels through time and space in a old British police box. I will tell you this though... that this story is like many many of the other Doctor Who stories involving aliens and a space ship. Past that there really is nothing else worth revealing about it.What is the saddest about Ghostlight is reflected by Sylvester McCoy's tenure as the Doctor and that is potential. If someone said that there wasn't a good Sylvester McCoy story, they would be right, but like with Ghostlight it wasn't his fault. The scripts he had to work from, the production, and the direction are just horrible. There seemed to be some lingering effects from the firing of the previous Doctor Colin Baker which hampered the quality and creative process in the series. Colin Baker also suffered from poor scripts, and the like, but with some of those stories his true potential did come across. For poor Sylvester McCoy, it never even had a chance to emerge.There was a great lack of justice in the dismisal of Colin Baker who was the fall guy for what was wrong with Doctor Who and when the show got axed it was a vindication. Like it or not, if Ghostlight was an example of what the next season of the serial could be it was a mercy killing. Like all good things the Doctor has recently returned and puts Ghostlight in its proper place... the trash can.",1,Poor Sylvester McCoy,1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,2382,"['One', 'star', 'may', 'seem', 'harsh', 'British', 'icon', ""'d"", 'give', 'zero', 'possible', ""'m"", 'actually', 'very', 'big', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Ghostlight', 'When', 'finally', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'was', 'truly', 'disappointed', 'long', 'running', 'serial', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'excellent', 'stories', 'poorest', 'example', 'anyone', 'thinking', 'watching', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'first', 'time', 'give', 'story', 'go', 'by.While', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'serial', 'began', 'take', 'wrong', 'turn', 'somewhere', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Doctor', 'start', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'stories', 'instead', 'are', 'plenty', 'DVDs', 'available', 'blame', 'can', 'be', 'placed', 'many', 'people', 'wrong', 'turn', 'sometimes', 'think', 'producer', 'John', 'Nathan', 'Turner', 'who', 'was', 'job', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'deeper', 'that.It', 'would', 'be', 'fair', 'explain', 'plot', 'Ghostlight', ""'m"", 'actually', 'doing', 'reader', 'favor', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'really', 'convoluted', 'drama', 'nowhere', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Doctor', 'alien', 'who', 'time', 'space', 'old', 'British', 'police', 'box', 'will', 'tell', 'story', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'involving', 'aliens', 'space', 'ship', 'really', 'nothing', 'else', 'worth', 'revealing', 'it.What', 'saddest', 'Ghostlight', 'reflected', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'tenure', 'Doctor', 'potential', 'someone', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'Ghostlight', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'scripts', 'had', 'work', 'production', 'direction', 'are', 'just', 'horrible', 'seemed', 'be', 'lingering', 'effects', 'firing', 'previous', 'Doctor', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'hampered', 'quality', 'creative', 'process', 'series', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'also', 'suffered', 'poor', 'scripts', 'like', 'stories', 'true', 'potential', 'did', 'come', 'across', 'poor', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'never', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'emerge.There', 'was', 'great', 'lack', 'justice', 'dismisal', 'Colin', 'Baker', 'who', 'was', 'fall', 'guy', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'when', 'show', 'got', 'axed', 'was', 'vindication', 'not', 'Ghostlight', 'was', 'example', 'what', 'next', 'season', 'serial', 'could', 'be', 'was', 'mercy', 'killing', 'good', 'things', 'Doctor', 'recently', 'returned', 'puts', 'Ghostlight', 'proper', 'place', 'trash', 'can']",Doctor Who - Ghost Light VHS

He may still be but I don't hold him accountable. Stories like this prove the point. Ghostlight is atmospheric. But that's about all it has going for it. In the DVD extras, even the CAST admitted they didn't know what was going on. You kind of get the gist of the story but it is needlessly convoluted most of the time. Perhaps the biggest criminal involved here is the idiot who provided the music for the episode. The McCoy era's production team's biggest mistake was always their uncanny ability to lose dialogue under the incidental music. It was never a problem in any other Doctor's era, why was it during McCoy's? Everything was fine in scenes set in a studio when there was no music playing and you could hear the dialogue perfectly well, even through McCoy's sometimes THICK Scottish brogue. But all of a sudden, they turn the the mics down, the voices get lower, and crucial plot information is suddenly lost beneath incidental music. Even worse was shows like Fenric where they shot the entire thing on location and it was even TOUGHER to hear the dialogue. A sad time for the show as it was over run with unprofessional production people. Many people like this era. I think they simply don't know any better. McCoy and company thought they were just hitting their stride around this time and maybe they were but no one bothered to get them better sound people so it's probably for the best that it ended. Especially now that we have a new, well done series with Eccleston. Still if you were going to get a McCoy episode.

If you prefer to have a story spoon-fed to you, then it's probably not going to be your cup of tea. On the other hand, if you like a story that makes you think then Ghost Light is for you.Ghost Light begins the so-called ""Ace Trilogy"" that consisted of the final three stories of the original program. For the first time in Doctor Who the companion really becomes central to the storyline, mirroring the way the show would be approached when the new series began in 2005. Sylvester McCoy gives his best performance as the seventh incarnation of the Doctor and Sophie Aldred steps up her game, too, as another layer is added to Ace. The supporting cast is absolutely top notch, as well.In an era known for its often poor production Ghost Light looks pristine. The atmosphere is suitably dark and gloomy, though the title can be misleading if you take it at face value. Nothing in this story should be taken at face value, however, as layer after layer of mystery slowly unfolds. Don't be surprised if you're a little puzzled on your first viewing, particularly if you don't give it your full attention.

At the very least it's one of the more complex stories they ever did, simply because they don't stop very often to explain what's going on. Ace was always a bit smarter than the average companion, and here she proves that she can work the plot out on her own without needing to constantly ask the Doctor what's up. Why do all the older companions need to be certifiable idiots? One effect of making Ace brighter is that they needed to make the Doctor smarter to show her up, and Sylvester McCoy is definitely up to the task. He's quiet and cunning and utterly cool.We get an excellent guest cast. Most memorable for me is Michael Cochrane as Redvers Fenn-Cooper (James Fennimore-Cooper?), a great white hunter gone insane and skulking about a Victorian mansion. The mansion is eerie, populated by weird creatures and weirder humans, and some who aren't quite human. The music is a huge step up from the early-Eighties muzak, and contributes to the gloomy, spooky atmosphere.Three aliens are living on Earth, in Perivale of all places. One plots to assassinate Queen Victoria while he keeps the other two locked away. One of them, ""Control"", breaks free and wants to become more human. The third, ""Light"", gets loose and threatens to freeze all life on the Earth to stop it evolving -- it turns out that these three were a survey team, but their insane, obsessive leader could not deal with all lifeforms on Earth constantly changing and evolving, so they ended up staying much longer than they'd planned. They have a Neandertal butler as well.The story makes good use of the theory of evolution as well as Victorian anti-evolutionists.

398357,A238M34Z3X2IBD,6304052855,Thomas E. O'Sullivan,"[9, 13]","Although broadcast order places SURVIVAL as the final DOCTOR WHO story - it's really GHOST LIGHT that takes the final bow.  While SURVIVAL ends with a more upbeat and open ended ending - it's GHOST LIGHT that really helps to tie up some loose ends, character development (Ace comes full circle here) and opens a lot more doors for the future.  GHOST LIGHT is a great story - but within the WHO community there is a great divide between those that love the story and those that hate the story.  I fall somehwere in the middle, but with a strong bias towards the ""love"" side of the arguement.  Yes, there are problems with the story.  What happens, why, how and to who and what for are often muddled.  The story draws deep water on its Victorian roots, yet manages to whip around around the place like a over sugared two year old on skates - things just happen because they happen, with no real clear reason as to why.  And by the end of the story we're not so much left with an actual ending as a musing, a personal discovery.  So, if you're looking for this story to follow the same path as previous DOCTOR WHO stories and have it simply handed to you... move on.  But, if you're looking for atmosphere, tension, suspense, chills and ideas - then GHOST LIGHT is unlike many DOCTOR WHO stories that have come before it.  Running only three episodes, it's too short for all the material there, yet just long enough for it never to get too tired or simply run dry before the end (a common problem in DOCTOR WHO stories).  There just isn't enough time for the standard padding to fill it out... it just rolls on, taking you along for the ride.  It's confusing.  It's thought provoking.  It's a cheat.  It's a riddle.  It's GHOST LIGHT, and it's one of the best the series ever produced.The DVD is outfitted with all the bells and whistles we've come to expect from the series.  There is commentary and while solid, never rises to a boiling point (much of the conversation is taken up by the writer - Marc Platt - explaining the story, what was both onscreen and what had been cut, or never made it onto film).  But there are some fun moments, and one glaring error as Sylvester McCoy is not present.  Sophie Aldred does tell us that this is the story McCoy loved the most, so it's a disappointment he could not be on hand to share his thoughts.  Missing scenes add to the story and the highlight (for me at least) was SHOOTING GHOSTS a ""as it happened"" look at filming.  Here we get to see everything happen at once... direction, actions, actors working on lines, marks, stopping and starting, laughs, mistakes, and everyone trying to beat the clock and get the day done.  An excellent feature.If you're a fan of DOCTOR WHO then GHOST LIGHT is a must... if not for the story, then as history marking the end of the original series.

Shot with poor quality cameras that weren't designed to handle low-light situations (hence the graininess), it's remarkable we got what we did.But here's the problem:  I've been a WHO fan sicne 1978, at the tender age of 6.  Along comes 1989.  ""Ghost Light"" is the first story ever that I opted to watch at a later date because it was so uninvolved and unengaging.  I don't know why, especially as I managed to survive season 24 without any permanent brain damage and that season was terrible through and through.  And how that seasons 25 and 26 were geared toward a mid/late-teen audience rather than the 6 year olds the previous one had tried to court.  Of course, ""Time and the Rani"" is a fun enough romp (though being drunk on a nice cool lager helps considerably), but that review for another day...So, along comes 1998.  I sit down to watch the episode I had taped 9 years earlier.  I thought it'd be a good idea to finally say ""I'm a dateless geek who's seen them all!""And sure enough, I became a dateless geek that's seen them all... I somehow managed to sit through it.  I think I needed a drink beforehand and I surely did need to down a gallon of Long Island Iced Tea afterward; that always cheers me up...  when trying to watch a rendition of chickenscratch scripting, I think alcohol also helps to make even the most schizophrenic writing style that much more coherent...  This story isn't just lacking in the engaging category, the writing itself is either convoluted, sloppy, or both.  Let's just say ""both"" and the extra features allude to this inference as well...I will say this story LOOKS incredibly good (since when does the BBC screw up a period piece anyway?  Even the original Doctor Who story, set during the time of the caveman, looked genuine...).The music is also exceptionally good.  Indeed, I bought the standalone soundtrack when it was released in the early 1990s.  It's very atmospheric and creepy and worthy on its own.  Unfortunately, it can't make second-rate writing come across any better...This story also cemented the notion (at the time) that the series (sarcastically by annoyed fans) needed to be renamed ""Ace Who"", given its focus on Ace rather than the Doctor.  (it's also ironic to point out that while late-80s Doctor Who is often criticized for giving the companion too much needless background info and development - and it was often needless, the new BBC series (2005) has taken a lot from this era and expanded greatly on it; with people calling it sensational and successful and a triumphant return.  Okey doke, having just said that it's time for me to mix a cocktail of my favorite hard liquors and drink 'til I drop:  Brandy, Whisky, Vodka, Drambuie, Tia Maria, Cointreau and Grand Marnier.  (thank you #6 for those choices!)  And if I can stomach watching ""Ghost Light"", you'll then understand it WILL take a gallon to get me to drop...But I digress.  *hic*  There are some rather nice extras on this disc.  Especially a great commentary by cast and composer, even with the *hic* writer.  There's some insight here, but it's not the best commentary ever...But if you think the 'deleted scenes' section will *hic* reveal any resolutions to this joke of a plot that makes ""Silver Nemesis"" seem like Royal Shakespeare by comparison, don't count on it.  *hic*But while the storyline is about as coherent as *hic* an infant attempting to learn English, there are some nice lines - one in particular regarding humanity comes from the Doctor itself.  But the trouble is, set pieces and *hic* occasional lines of drool-worthy dialogue can't *hic* make up for a storyline that's a little too fresh from the cow pasture...  (hmm, drunk and retching on foul odors, how much worse can this get?)Also, don't think that the documentary ""Light in Dark Places"" will be helpful; our mystery writer (it's a mystery that he became a writer) didn't show up for this one to explain it...  :-(  And, like the 75 minute story itself, this doco is also a bit too long.This release is obviously for those fans who'll buy every release just for the sake of saying ""I have them all, nyah nyah nyah-nyah-nyah"" (like myself) or for the true fans of this story, of which there are many on both sides of the *hic* pond...There, I think I'm *hic* sober again...It's also been said that repeated viewings can help make sense of this, ahem, DISASTER.  This unfortunately goes back to the other point; who in their right mind could truly sit through this even more than once unless they were drawn in by its superficial elements and atypical, bizarre feel (ditto for the new Doctor Who series...)?Get it on sale if you can, though the 20% off isn't what I'd call terrible.  For repeat viewings, for showing your friends as an example of fine quality Doctor Who (or, let's face it, even showing your worst enemies in an attempt to turn them into pillars of salt), this particular story isn't worth the money - but if you're a completist or a reeeeeeeeeeeeal fan of this story, it's worth every penny and then some.  As for me, I wouldn't likely even spend a penny on it, but then would I even think of confusing you with British slang?  :-)(one little note:  You're more likely to enjoy my little review than you are when trying to watch the story, whose plot revolves around Ace, some one-liners featuring the Doctor, and some bafflegab regarding evolution...  it's just another form of sci-fi... and unlike most sci-fi, it's badly written out.  (and as a Christian myself, I could care less if evolution is real, if it's part of God's plan, or if it's a load of bunk.  Helping other people freely, in good faith, is why I am one.))",2,This one's a real mixed bag of a grab bag,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,5745,"['restoration', 'team', 'always', 'managed', 'work',
