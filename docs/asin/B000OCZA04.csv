Parts of this movie work and of course parts of it fall flat. The supporting cast is annoying but the true talent of this film is Mandy Moore. She holds her own as Milly, her mother is controlling, opininated, nervous, and constantly on her daughter's back about settling down and sticking to a relationship. This movie has some funny moments but don't expect it to blow you away.

1063805,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000OCZA04,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 8]","The sad thing about `Because I Said So' is that it oozes with potential yet crashes and burns in takeoff.  The pairing of the uber-talented Diane Keaton and lovable Mandy Moore should and very well could bring forth a great romantic comedy but instead proves to be one of the most painful movie watching experiences in recent memory.  Watching Keaton resort to cheesy dialog and over-the-top antics that even she can't make work is enough to make any true fan of the actress verp but it's the ridiculous way the premise is executed that makes me shiver at the thought of the two hours I lost to this train wreck.  As someone mentioned, had the film revolved more around the three daughters and less around the overbearing and somewhat sexually repressed mother then it may have been a much more rewarding film.The plot revolves around Daphne, a mother approaching her sixtieth birthday with two married daughters and then their Milly, her youngest who is still single and can't seem to keep a relationship for very long.  Daphne makes it her goal to pair Milly up with a good man, even going as far as to put out a `personal add' in order to interview men for her daughter and then secretly set her up with them.  Then Daphne meets her match when a young guitarist becomes aware of her meddling scheme and takes it upon himself to woo Milly foiling Daphne's plans.It's funny to me because as I was typing the above paragraph I realized just how funny and entertaining this movie really could have been.  On paper it sounds great but on screen it was horrendous.  The biggest problem was Keaton.  Her car chase scene alone almost brought my wife to eject the DVD it was that mind-numbing.  Diane has always had a habit of overacting, but as she proved in `Something's Gotta Give' she can reign it in to where it's enjoyable and entertaining.  Here though she possesses none of the charm that garnered her the Oscar nomination in 2003.  Here she does nothing but annoy and frustrate both her daughters and the audience.Mandy Moore is still sweet and adorable but the material she has to work with does her no favors.  In fact the only characters I really enjoyed and or cared to watch besides the sisters, who are criminally deprived of screen time, was Gabriel Macht who plays Milly's guitar-wielding boy toy and Reverend Camden who plays his father.  Stephen Collins especially really delivers here and I wish that the film itself had been better if not for the sheer excitement of seeing him in a movie.  In fact when he's on screen with Keaton she's less irritating and a little more tolerable.  There couch make-out session was a highlight and the audience is even given a glimmer of the charm we've come to love in Diane Keaton.  Alas, the film is a flop and aside from a few very spread out chuckles and the appearance of Father Camden it's a complete drag and waste of an evening in.  Skip this one and rent something with a little more substance and a lot more laughs.  My one star is for Collins.",1,"Sadly falls short, way short, of what it could have been...",1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,3004,"['sad', 'thing', 'Said', 'So', 'potential', 'yet', 'crashes', 'burns', 'takeoff', 'pairing', 'uber-talented', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'lovable', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'should', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'bring', 'forth', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'instead', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'movie', 'watching', 'experiences', 'recent', 'memory', 'Watching', 'Keaton', 'resort', 'cheesy', 'dialog', 'over-the-top', 'antics', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'work', 'enough', 'make', 'true', 'fan', 'actress', 'verp', 'ridiculous', 'way', 'premise', 'executed', 'shiver', 'thought', 'two', 'hours', 'lost', 'train', 'wreck', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'had', 'film', 'revolved', 'more', 'three', 'daughters', 'less', 'overbearing', 'somewhat', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'mother', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'rewarding', 'film.The', 'plot', 'Daphne', 'mother', 'approaching', 'sixtieth', 'birthday', 'two', 'married', 'daughters', 'then', 'Milly', 'youngest', 'who', 'still', 'single', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'relationship', 'very', 'long', 'Daphne', 'goal', 'pair', 'Milly', 'up', 'good', 'man', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'put', 'out', 'personal', 'add', 'order', 'interview', 'men', 'daughter', 'then', 'secretly', 'set', 'up', 'Then', 'Daphne', 'match', 'when', 'young', 'guitarist', 'aware', 'meddling', 'scheme', 'woo', 'Milly', 'foiling', 'Daphne', 'plans.It', 'funny', 'was', 'typing', 'paragraph', 'realized', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'paper', 'great', 'screen', 'was', 'horrendous', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'Keaton', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'alone', 'almost', 'brought', 'wife', 'eject', 'DVD', 'was', 'mind-numbing', 'Diane', 'always', 'had', 'habit', 'overacting', 'proved', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'can', 'reign', 'where', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'Here', 'none', 'charm', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '2003', 'Here', 'nothing', 'annoy', 'frustrate', 'daughters', 'audience.Mandy', 'Moore', 'still', 'sweet', 'adorable', 'material', 'work', 'favors', 'fact', 'only', 'characters', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'cared', 'watch', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', 'criminally', 'deprived', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'who', 'Milly', 'guitar-wielding', 'boy', 'toy', 'Reverend', 'Camden', 'who', 'father', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'especially', 'really', 'delivers', 'here', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'not', 'sheer', 'excitement', 'seeing', 'movie', 'fact', 'when', 'screen', 'Keaton', 'less', 'irritating', 'little', 'more', 'tolerable', 'couch', 'make-out', 'session', 'was', 'highlight', 'audience', 'even', 'given', 'glimmer', 'charm', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Alas', 'film', 'flop', 'aside', 'few', 'very', 'spread', 'out', 'chuckles', 'appearance', 'Father', 'Camden', 'complete', 'drag', 'waste', 'evening', 'Skip', 'one', 'rent', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'substance', 'lot', 'more', 'laughs', 'one', 'star', 'Collins']",N/A

Keaton is really too old to run around in tights, dance to rock music, and dig into her bottomless purse for condoms. the girls are nondescript and unforgettable. The story is the same old, same old, a copy of a copy created years ago. This mom character, though, is interfering in a sick, tiresome way, but is never really exposed as the neurotic she clearly is. She not only plays cupid for her tubby daughter, but plays peeking tom. She follows her daughter on a date, but somehow it is not funny because Keaton isn't really able to pull off this sort of weepy lunatic. The two competing boyfriends are as boring as the sisters. In fact, the entire cast lacks something. They are all dull, colorless. They lack sex appeal. Curiously, nobody seems to really work.

But they're most definitely not all that likeable.Diane Keaton's character is the most overbearing mother I've ever -- EVER -- seen on screen.  She had little to no redeeming value to her whatsoever.  I know we're supposed to feel some sympathy for her because she lost her husband and had only her kids to lend purpose to her life, but I seriously was getting ready to throw things at the screen whenever she was on.  I also screamed ""Good God, STFU already!"" at her many many times.  I mean, really.  She's THAT annoying.And that fact makes her kids really annoying too because none of them -- adults all -- can even remotely set any boundaries with her.  One is willing to accept a call from her while she's making out with a date; the other two are all too happy to be on a conference call with her at the time.""Johnny"" is also wildly annoying because he, like the girls, can't get a handle of his kid either.  I mean really, who doesn't say a single word to his out of control child when he smashes cake into a stranger's face?  That kid is going to grow up to be a horrible spoiled brat.  I guess his character was meant to be the endearing one, the one you like, the one you hope Milly ends up with, but his charm kinda gets overtaken by his inability to grow some balls with his son.And finally, ""Jason"" -- I'm sure he's written this way, so I guess doing a good job of being unlikeable -- comes across as a rich snob.  (Another reason Diane Keaton is so annoying is because she seems like him only because of his pedigree rather than his personality.)  His charm exudes more from his tossing around quaint phrases like ""Last time I was in Italy, I was in Sienna -- you've been to Sienna, right?"" and handing out expensive jewelry.So really, by the end of the movie, I just wanted to slit each of the characters' throats.  It would be a better end for them than anything the rest of their miserable existence would be.So... don't spend 90 minutes on this movie.

1063821,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000OCZA04,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 8]","When I watched Diane Keaton on Charlie Rose after 2005'sThe Family Stonewas released, I was struck by what a laser-sharp, perceptive and funny non-conformist she continues to be when she is challenged to reveal herself. What an utter comedown to see this superb actress play such a dithering, overbearing and one-track character in this dismal 2007 misfire. Ostensibly a comedy with dramatic moments, this is exactly the type of unoriginal studio-manufactured product that gets released in the post-holiday box-office wasteland. Limply directed in handbook style by Michael Lehmann (who made the sharp black comedy,Heathers, and the infamous turkey,Hudson Hawk),  there is barely a scene that rings true thanks primarily to the manipulative, formulaic screenplay by Karen Leigh Hopkins and Jessie Nelson. That this movie was ever green-lighted is the biggest wonder about the film.The paper-thin plot has Keaton portray Daphne Wilder, the single mother of three grown daughters. About to turn sixty, she has already married off her two oldest, level-headed Maggie and sex-crazed Mae, and her overprotective nature will not allow her to rest until her youngest, Milly, is married. Daphne goes to the extreme of posting an online personal ad in order to interview potential suitors and finds two prospects - passively manipulative architect Jason and deceptively casual rock musician Johnny. Daphne's blueprint for a perfect husband is Jason, but Johnny figures out how to meet Milly on his own. Milly dates both men unbeknownst to each other. The standard complications ensue, not the least of which is how Daphne's long dormant libido is awakened by Johnny's easy-going dad Joe. The rest of the cast is serviceable at best and ill-used at worst. Mandy Moore is an appealing presence as the clumsy, endearing Milly, although she is overloaded with enough cutesy idiosyncrasies to make Keaton's ownAnnie Halllook relatively unaffected.As Jason, Tom Everett Scott seems to play the same role over and over, the superficial yuppie who does not fare well upon closer inspection. By contrast, Gabriel Macht conveys the necessary sincerity to make the overly sensitive Johnny the more desirable prospect. As Maggie, Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls) has at least one running gag as the psychiatrist to a hopeless nebbish (expertly played by Tony Hale ofArrested Development) to take advantage of her comic talent, but Piper Perabo (Imagine Me & You) is little more than a glorified extra as Mae. Stephen Collins plays the too-convenient-to-be-true Joe as if he walked off the set of7th Heaven. When the movie is not dealing with Milly's eroding self-confidence, sitcom-level laughs seem to be the only aspiration that the sputtering script has. Saddest of all is Keaton who is encouraged to exaggerate all her mannerisms into a morass of fluttery excess, most conspicuously in an embarrassing meltdown scene that has her character lose her voice. The 2007 DVD is sparse on extras - a seven-minute making-of featurette, a five-minute short spotlighting the production design and food preparation, an unrelated iVillage ad and a music video of ""World Spins Madly On"" by the Weepies.",2,Inconsequential Misfire Has an Over-the-Top Keaton Dominating an Underused Cast,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,3169,"['When', 'watched', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Charlie', 'Rose', ""2005'sThe"", 'Family', 'Stonewas', 'released', 'was', 'struck', 'what', 'laser-sharp', 'perceptive', 'funny', 'non-conformist', 'be', 'when', 'challenged', 'reveal', 'What', 'utter', 'comedown', 'see', 'superb', 'actress', 'play', 'dithering', 'overbearing', 'one-track', 'character', 'dismal', '2007', 'misfire', 'Ostensibly', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'exactly', 'type', 'unoriginal', 'studio-manufactured', 'product', 'released', 'post-holiday', 'box-office', 'wasteland', 'Limply', 'directed', 'handbook', 'style', 'Michael', 'Lehmann', 'who', 'made', 'sharp', 'black', 'comedy', 'Heathers', 'infamous', 'turkey', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'barely', 'scene', 'true', 'thanks', 'primarily', 'manipulative', 'formulaic', 'screenplay', 'Karen', 'Leigh', 'Hopkins', 'Jessie', 'Nelson', 'movie', 'was', 'ever', 'green-lighted', 'biggest', 'wonder', 'film.The', 'paper-thin', 'plot', 'Keaton', 'portray', 'Daphne', 'Wilder', 'single', 'mother', 'three', 'grown', 'daughters', 'turn', 'sixty', 'already', 'married', 'off', 'two', 'oldest', 'level-headed', 'Maggie', 'sex-crazed', 'Mae', 'overprotective', 'nature', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'rest', 'youngest', 'Milly', 'married', 'Daphne', 'extreme', 'posting', 'online', 'personal', 'ad', 'order', 'interview', 'potential', 'suitors', 'two', 'prospects', 'passively', 'manipulative', 'architect', 'Jason', 'deceptively', 'casual', 'rock', 'musician', 'Johnny', 'Daphne', 'blueprint', 'perfect', 'husband', 'Jason', 'Johnny', 'out', 'how', 'meet', 'Milly', 'own', 'Milly', 'men', 'unbeknownst', 'other', 'standard', 'complications', 'ensue', 'not', 'least', 'how', 'Daphne', 'long', 'dormant', 'libido', 'awakened', 'Johnny', 'easy-going', 'dad', 'Joe', 'rest', 'cast', 'serviceable', 'best', 'ill-used', 'worst', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'appealing', 'presence', 'clumsy', 'endearing', 'Milly', 'overloaded', 'enough', 'cutesy', 'idiosyncrasies', 'make', 'Keaton', 'ownAnnie', 'Halllook', 'relatively', 'unaffected.As', 'Jason', 'Tom', 'Everett', 'Scott', 'play', 'same', 'role', 'superficial', 'yuppie', 'who', 'not', 'fare', 'well', 'closer', 'inspection', 'contrast', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'conveys', 'necessary', 'sincerity', 'make', 'overly', 'sensitive', 'Johnny', 'more', 'desirable', 'prospect', 'Maggie', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'least', 'one', 'running', 'gag', 'psychiatrist', 'hopeless', 'nebbish', 'expertly', 'played', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'ofArrested', 'Development', 'take', 'advantage', 'comic', 'talent', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Imagine', 'Me', 'little', 'more', 'glorified', 'extra', 'Mae', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'too-convenient-to-be-true', 'Joe', 'walked', 'off', 'set', 'of7th', 'Heaven', 'When', 'movie', 'not', 'dealing', 'Milly', 'eroding', 'self-confidence', 'sitcom-level', 'laughs', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'aspiration', 'sputtering', 'script', 'Saddest', 'Keaton', 'who', 'encouraged', 'exaggerate', 'mannerisms', 'morass', 'fluttery', 'excess', 'most', 'conspicuously', 'embarrassing', 'meltdown', 'scene', 'character', 'lose', 'voice', '2007', 'DVD', 'sparse', 'extras', 'seven-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'five-minute', 'short', 'spotlighting', 'production', 'design', 'food', 'preparation', 'unrelated', 'iVillage', 'ad', 'music', 'video', 'World', 'Spins', 'Madly', 'Weepies']",N/A

She is basically conducting two romantic sexual relationships at once with two guys, one of whom she should actually be with.So why should we like her or care about her?

No, don't be like that!"" I was reminded of Sliding Doors and the line ""You have to admit it, you are a morality free zone."" The character that that was aimed at was not supposed to be sympathetic. The harm he did through his own stupidity and lack of morals was incalculable. So why does this film treat the Mandy Moore character with such lightness? She deserves misery, but all she does is pout a bit and things resolve for her.Diane Keaton does a marvelous performance of a mother who would be fun to beat around the head with a heavy sand filled draught excluder.

The writers would like to have us treat it as if she was going on a few too many dinner dates, not seriously manipulating the lives of two men.I went with a female friend to see Because I Said So in the theaters because I figured I could handle a slightly silly romantic comedy, and I was willing to overlook minor flaws to get a few good laughs.  I had to look long and hard to find redeeming qualities to the movie.  Actors Gabriel Macht (as Mandy Moore's loveable, guitar-playing, easy-going romantic boyfriend) and Stephen Collins (as the father of Gabriel Macht's character and a foil to Diane Keaton's mother role) are both outstanding.  The other actors have rotten comedic timing or a forceful method that makes the reader cringe instead of laugh.  You will laugh at a few sight gags (a balloon stuck to the back of Mandy Moore's dress, anyone?), and Keaton's wardrobe is a stunning marriage of retro and modern stylings, but there is little else to hold this film together.",2,Prepare to have your IQ painfully sucked out of your brain,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,1602,"['How', 'can', 'movie', 'get', 'many', 'elements', 'wrong', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'painful', 'degree', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'talent', 'other', 'movies', 'know', 'much', 'more', 'capable', 'writers', 'think', 'comedy', 'element', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'silly', 'sight', 'gags', 'cakes', 'falling', 'people', 'heads', 'overall', 'plot', 'one', 'seriously', 'crippling', 'flaw', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'character', 'two-times', 'men', 'level', 'getting', 'engaged', 'one', 'considering', 'moving', 'viewer', 'expected', 'overlook', 'major', 'indiscretions', 'cute', 'bossed', 'family', 'writers', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'treat', 'was', 'going', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'dinner', 'dates', 'not', 'seriously', 'manipulating', 'lives', 'two', 'men.I', 'went', 'female', 'friend', 'see', 'Said', 'So', 'theaters', 'figured', 'could', 'handle', 'slightly', 'silly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'was', 'willing', 'overlook', 'minor', 'flaws', 'get', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'had', 'look', 'long', 'hard', 'find', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'movie', 'Actors', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'loveable', 'guitar-playing', 'easy-going', 'romantic', 'boyfriend', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'father', 'Gabriel', 'Macht', 'character', 'foil', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'mother', 'role', 'are', 'outstanding', 'other', 'actors', 'have', 'rotten', 'comedic', 'timing', 'forceful', 'method', 'reader', 'cringe', 'instead', 'laugh', 'will', 'laugh', 'few', 'sight', 'gags', 'balloon', 'stuck', 'back', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'dress', 'anyone', 'Keaton', 'wardrobe', 'stunning', 'marriage', 'retro', 'modern', 'stylings', 'little', 'else', 'hold', 'film', 'together']",N/A

Tell me Kate Hudson or Reese Witherspoon has a new movie out and you'll get to watch me run toward the theater. It's like that.That being said, this movie was a chick flick gone wrong. It has all the cliches. Someone is unhappy in his/her own personal life, so they compensate by trying to fix the problems of others. There's the big misunderstanding. A quirky girl and quirky guy who make it work despite life's quirks. Because I Said So has the makings of a good movie, it just doesn't follow through.Diane Keaton plays Daphne, a mother of three girls who had a bad relationship with her now [deceased/divorced?, it's never explicitly stated] long-lost husband, so she wants to make sure all of her daughters find happiness. Two of them (Lauren Graham and Piper Perabo) are already married, so she only has to worry about her youngest--Milly, a caterer played by Mandy Moore. Though Daphne has been single for years, she wants to make sure Milly is settled with a good man before she can enjoy her own life. So Daphne places a personal looking for the man who will finally make Milly happy. What she comes up with are one man who she loves--a successful architect with a bright future ahead of him--and another she can't stand--a musician who can't believe a woman would go so far as to advertise for her daughter's boyfriend/future husband. Which one do you think Milly chooses?It's not even the tactics used by this cheesy girl film, but instead the halfhearted effort put forth by the writers and the directors that make this movie so bad. Certain scenes, which were key to the plot (ie, the musician figuring out that Daphne is dating the architect), are glossed over when--in reality--the plot would have been done more justice by a little exposition. The fact that Daphne finds love (with the musician's dad, no less) has no bearing on the outcome of the film and, in fact, detracts from the big picture: this family of women who have an unstable matriarch determined to live vicariously through her daughters' lives. I feel like the movie The Upside of Anger is everything that this movie wants to be, but actually accomplishes its task. If you want to watch a film about a family of women that is well-told, well-written, and beautifully filmed, rent that one. If you want a half-hearted effort at chick flicks that doesn't even have the decency to fully flesh out its plot, rent this one.",2,The things that were good don't balance out the things that were bad,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,2449,"['am', 'person', 'who', 'chick', 'flicks', 'Tell', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'new', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'watch', 'run', 'theater', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'chick', 'flick', 'gone', 'wrong', 'cliches', 'Someone', 'unhappy', 'own', 'personal', 'life', 'compensate', 'trying', 'fix', 'problems', 'others', 'big', 'misunderstanding', 'quirky', 'girl', 'quirky', 'guy', 'who', 'make', 'work', 'life', 'quirks', 'Said', 'So', 'makings', 'good', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'follow', 'through.Diane', 'Keaton', 'Daphne', 'mother', 'three', 'girls', 'who', 'had', 'bad', 'relationship', 'now', 'deceased/divorced', 'never', 'explicitly', 'stated', ']', 'long-lost', 'husband', 'make', 'sure', 'daughters', 'find', 'happiness', 'Two', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'are', 'already', 'married', 'only', 'worry', 'youngest', 'Milly', 'caterer', 'played', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Though', 'Daphne', 'been', 'single', 'years', 'make', 'sure', 'Milly', 'settled', 'good', 'man', 'can', 'enjoy', 'own', 'life', 'Daphne', 'places', 'personal', 'looking', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'finally', 'make', 'Milly', 'happy', 'What', 'up', 'are', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'successful', 'architect', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'musician', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'woman', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'advertise', 'daughter', 'boyfriend/future', 'husband', 'Which', 'one', 'do', 'think', 'Milly', 'not', 'even', 'tactics', 'used', 'cheesy', 'girl', 'film', 'instead', 'halfhearted', 'effort', 'put', 'forth', 'writers', 'directors', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'key', 'plot', 'ie', 'musician', 'figuring', 'out', 'Daphne', 'dating', 'architect', 'are', 'glossed', 'when', 'reality', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'justice', 'little', 'exposition', 'fact', 'Daphne', 'love', 'musician', 'dad', 'less', 'bearing', 'outcome', 'film', 'fact', 'big', 'picture', 'family', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'unstable', 'matriarch', 'determined', 'live', 'vicariously', 'daughters', 'lives', 'feel', 'movie', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'everything', 'movie', 'be', 'actually', 'task', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'family', 'women', 'well-told', 'well-written', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'rent', 'one', 'want', 'half-hearted', 'effort', 'chick', 'flicks', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'decency', 'fully', 'flesh', 'out', 'plot', 'rent', 'one']",N/A

Yes, that premise does get old after awhile, and I was bored when I saw it in the theater. The second time I watched it you actually realize the other side stories.Maggie Wilder-Decker (Lauren Graham) -The oldest daughter of Daphne Wilder, and a psychiatrist who is stuck in the middle between her mother and her sister Milly when she finds out about her mother's latest scheme. Maggie also has a suicidal patient named Stuart (good for a few laughs)Mae Wilder (Piper Perabo) - The middle child and the most outspoken of the group, she is definitely in a class by herself. She prides herself on holding the record of the most orgasms in the family. Mae seems to take Maggie's side when it comes to defending their sister Milly when their mother starts to pry.Milly Wilder (Mandy Moore) - Daphne's youngest daughter, a successful chef, is unlucky in love unlike her sisters who are happily married. She's tired of being treated like a child, but is torn between the love of her mother and the need to be treated like an adult.Daphne Wilder (Diane Keaton) - A single mother of three who makes it her mission to interfere in her daughter's lives, especially young Milly. . Believing the choices her daughter is making are all wrong she decides to find the perfect man for her so she will, for once, be in a stable relationship.Johnny Dresden (Gabriel Macht) - The hunky musician who goes against Daphne's wishes for him to stay away from Milly. He teaches guitar classes and is a father to young Lionel. He has an instant attraction to Milly, who feels the same way.Joe Dresden (Stephen Collins) - Johnny's father has taken a romantic interest in Daphne and while the story mainly revolves around Milly, this gives the movie a little change of pace, especially when Daphne realizes she has feelings for him too.Jason Grant (Tom Everett Scott) - The winner of Daphne's search for the perfect mate. A driven architect with an egotistical attitude who lavishes Milly with dinners at fancy restaurants and tickets to La Boh&egrave;me. He truly believes he is Milly's perfect mate.The side stories of Maggie's suicidal patient, the attraction between Joe and Daphne, Milly's career, and the adorable antics of Johnny's son Lionel makes this movie more enjoyable if you look past the mother/daughter long enough to see there is more to this than meets the eye.I am a fan of 7th Heaven so I enjoyed Stephen Collins' portrayal of Joe. I think he was the perfect choice to play opposite Diane Keaton. It's an unexpected casting choice, but it fit the bill perfectly. After seeing this movie I can't imagine anyone else cast in their place.

We live in a world where parents refuse to let their adult ""children"" go and some ""children"" refuse to leave home when they reach adulthood (see ""Failure to Launch"" for the flip side of this crisis)!  The point of this movie (to me) is that parents must realize that their role in life is to prepare their children for adulthood, and that controlling your children's lives past adulthood is ridiculous.I think this movie makes an important statement, and if it saves even one adult ""child"" from the clutches of a well-meaning but annoyingly controlling parent, then it has served its purpose!",4,"Portrait of a pushy, annoying parent",1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,1070,"['movie', 'received', 'relatively', 'bad', 'reviews', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'played', 'mom', 'who', 'NOT', 'let', 'daughters', 'grow', 'up', 'find', 'own', 'ways', 'world', 'watched', 'movie', 'local', 'theatre', 'was', 'tempted', 'rush', 'screen', 'strangle', 'Diane', 'character', 'controlling', 'witch', 'was', 'when', 'should', 'hold', 'nature', 'role', 'actress', 'portraying', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'topic', 'was', 'extremely', 'timely', 'day', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'parents', 'refuse', 'let', 'adult', 'children', 'go', 'children', 'refuse', 'leave', 'home', 'when', 'reach', 'adulthood', 'see', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'flip', 'side', 'crisis', 'point', 'movie', 'parents', 'must', 'realize', 'role', 'life', 'prepare', 'children', 'adulthood', 'controlling', 'children', 'lives', 'adulthood', 'ridiculous.I', 'think', 'movie', 'important', 'statement', 'even', 'one', 'adult', 'child', 'clutches', 'well-meaning', 'annoyingly', 'controlling', 'parent', 'then', 'served', 'purpose']",N/A

A film this terrible does not even call for an in-depth, critical analysis.1) The women either act emotionally vacant, completely stupid or out of control. If you're looking for a film to set women back, this is it.2) The film ortrays those who seek therapy as simply pathetic. The patient who sees Millie's (Mandy Moore) therapist sister Maggie (Lauren Graham) is so sadly off the deep end that Millie asks him to, literally jump out a window. If only this were a falsehood, but it really happens. That, coupled with his deep despair, is supposed to be a subject of hilarity. Instead it is most offensive, particularly how Maggie is completely unprofessional, telling others about how pathetic he is and skipping out on his appointment. This is intended to be a real riot.3) Daphne (Keaton) in particular has the mind of a hummingbird. It is not cute or charming; it is cliched and mind-numbingly difficult to keep up with. It also feels like Keaton has done this role many times. She desperately needs a better script than this one.4) As usual, it is the hot, hunky guy who is portrayed as virtuous, while the less good-looking one is the contemptible snob. The hot guy is a guitar player, too. Isn't that a shocker? Realistic images of men tend to be absent from these kinds of movies but in a film this subpar it only aggravates the proceedings.5) There is far too much sexual innuendo and sex itself. Can't these people get some class? Daphne and Joe (Stephen Collins) even have sex on their predictable wedding day, keeping the preacher waiting. Millie also loses all credibility and sympathy when her character begins having sex with both her boyfriends, and lots of it. Daphne also somehow cannot figure out how to turn off a Web site with tons of porn on it, even returning to her computer to find it still there days later. This is not 1994. Her dog finds this so invigorating he starts humping a pillow.6) Daphne sings with her daughters at least 2 times for no apparent reason. Can anybody say ""First Wives Club?"" Collins also played Keaton's hubby in that film, by the way. Formula, anyone?7) There's too much food in the film, with many accidents that occur with cakes and souffles falling all over the place and on top of people. There is far too much reliance on the clumsiness of Daphne and Millie when carrying food for comic relief.8) This film is very insensitive to Asians. In an early scene, Daphne is insulted and physically mangled by Asian masseuses. Must we always use such stock characters we only find in movies, and must we always cast minorities to play them?9) It is far too politically correct and cliched in its trying to involve senior citizens in the emotional climax scene. So many elderly couples all start kissing each other when Moore kisses her man of choice, including a Lesbian couple thrown in for sensation and further political correctness. This scene is overtly affectatious and pseudo-heartwarming to overzealous, concocted proportions.10) Even though Daphne and her daughters don't seen tremendously rich or affluent, with Millie's character being a caterer, they all live in gorgeously furnished pads and have mighty decadent parties in their sparkling clean version of Los Angeles. It's downright insulting to the common sense of viewers.Despite this weighty list of pitfalls, Keaton does still have her moments, and Moore is at least able to act her way out of a bag. Poor Moore was in the two worst films of 2007 - this and ""License to Wed."" It's time to find better scripts. Unfortunately, they rarely fill non-arthouse cinemas anymore.There are a couple laughs here and there in ""Because I Said So""  but they are tongue-in-cheek.

I had read all the negative press on this film and was prepared for something truly dreadful.  It was far from dreadful.  A lot of the dialogue was really well written.  Perhaps the reason that my husband enjoyed it was that there are two male characters/actors (Gabriel Macht's Johnny and Stephen Collins's Joe) who really excel at neutralizing the hysteria of their female counterparts.  We see a lot of good-for-nothing guys in movies and commercials (I call it the men-are-idiots school), so it's refreshing to see a couple of really good, nice men who make the extra effort to work it out with a couple of basically good but really needy women.Personally I really had a problem with Johnny's son Lionel.  I suppose he had ADHD, although that was never really addressed, other than the line about Lionel's ""unique rhythms,"" which I hated.  Definitely a high-maintenance kid, and again it was refreshing to see Johnny and his dad raising this boy and barely batting an eye.I hated Tom Everett Scott's character, but then again, I believe I was supposed to.This is not a subtle movie, but it contains some appealing performances.

1063874,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000OCZA04,Samuel McKewon,"[17, 23]","""Because I Said So"" inhabits a level of the underworld where the neurotic run wild, calm is a four-letter word and one character is more or less identified as ""the sister who set the family record for orgasms."" It actually sickened me a little. It couldn't be any worse if each DVD came laced with anthrax.Ostensibly this is a romantic comedy - though it is the opposite of romantic and funny like a shiv to the belly - about a mother and her three daughters, the youngest of which has either rotten taste in men, or rotten luck. The mother is Diane Keaton, while the youngest daughter is Mandy Moore. It should tell you something that Moore is the best thing about the movie.Building off her mother-as-a-dictator performance in ""The Family Stone"" Keaton is Daphne, professional loon. She seems to be a baker; she lives in a million-dollar townhouse, so she must traffic angel dust, too. At any rate, she's the kind of mother who, at some point, talks simply for the sensation of mouthing words, dresses like Julie Andrews met Cruella DeVille, cries in proverbial hiccups, psychosomatically loses her voice, and eventually breaks out into song with her three daughters, who occasionally perform doo-wop numbers in front of small audiences of friends, husbands, and rotten men.Forty years ago, women like this were either put on valium, or put away.Daphne is borderline incoherent, a manipulator, and such an unhinged, meddling jack lope that she signs her daughter up for an online dating service, then screens the potential suitors. Unbeknowst to Millie (Moore), Daphne has set her up with an architect (Tom Everett Scott) who might be the blandest creep ever committed to celluloid. There's no reason to like him, and he's not interesting enough to hate.Vying for Millie's affections is a musician (Gabriel Macht). He's also a single father. Occasionally, he moonlights as a saint, teaching kids and idiots to play the guitar. Of course, Millie, a caterer who moonlights as a saint teaching  just plain idiots how to cook, sleeps around on the musician for sake of dramatic tension.Other than be a showcase for Keaton roaring id, it's hard to figure out what ""Because I Said So""  wanted to do. It apologizes for any number of Millie and Daphne's morally questionable behaviors by chalking up to them being women in love, or heat, as if this somehow makes their choices look better. Directed by Michael Lehman (a long way from ""Heathers"" or even ""Soapdish"") it revels in frank, predictable chats about sex.  Eventually, the daughters conclude that mom's meddling traces back to her need to get screwed; she's two &eacute;clairs short of a dozen because she hasn't been properly stuck in thirty years.It trades in a bunch of other irritations, too. The musician's kid seems to be autistic; he's constantly screaming or running around like he's been sprung from the bull pit in Pamplona.

If you are looking for a light comedy, do not settle for this and try to find one in which the writer was a little more creative and achieved the goal of entertaining us. I am not going to lie, when I decided to watch this I did not expect a masterpiece, but at least I was hoping to laugh a little and enjoy the time with my wife. The humor was so unoriginal and most of the performances so uninspired that the goal was not even close to being accomplished.I felt tempted to not even comment on what the movie is about, but decided to treat this as a ""normal"" review anyway. Diane Keaton plays Daphne, the mother of three good looking young women. Two of the daughters have tied the knot, but Milly has not been able to find the right man for her. Daphne is focused on helping her daughter find Mr. Right. She has the horrendous idea of publishing a personal add without her daughter's consent, to triage candidates for Milly. During these interviews, Daphne finds a successful architect she thinks is a perfect fit. But as she is going through the process, a musician that was playing at the restaurant figures out what Daphne was doing and his interest was piqued. The two guys try to conquer Milly's love, and of course, they are as different from each other as two guys can be. You can probably guess the rest of the plot.This is a really mind-numbing film, with pretty bad performances by most of the cast members. The only one that is fine in her role is Lauren Graham, who plays one Molly's sisters. Diane Keaton's performance is so over the top that it is hard to believe she is the same actress we have seen in other productions.

In addition, the auditorium was 2/3 full and still I only heard a few chuckles (the movie was supposed to be funny).The movie is about an upper class single mom and her girls. The mother, who is an over protective snob, and a pain in the rear end, is hard to believe as a character. The family is very liberal and sexually open minded. This combined with their upper class manners makes the characters difficult to relate to. The funny thing is that I don't think the family was supposed to be upper class (judging from what they were doing for a living).There are some cruel and unfunny jokes involving a mental therapy patient of Maggie (who is a therapist). I saw Borat, but the tasteless retardation jokes in Borat are obvious satire. The jokes involving the patient in ""what about Bob"" are funny, but not cruel. In this movie the ""mental patient jokes"" were humorless and just bad taste. Also Asians are portrayed in an insulting and ""not funny"" stereotypical way.The architect/engineer/analytical guy turns out to be the jerk, while the guitar playing musician turns out to be the good guy.

Nancy Meyers knew what she was doing as the latter's director, who, despite rather predictable ending, provided constant laughs and interesting characters supported by the talented actors. Now ""Because I Said So,"" directed by Michael ""Hudson Hawk"" Lehmann, gives us one of the most unfunny and annoying comedies of the year.Diane Keaton plays Daphne, an overprotective mother who, unnecessarily you'd think, worries about the future of her youngest daughter Milly played by Mandy Moore. The meddling mom sets up a date for Milly (without her knowing) with a boy by posting an ad on the net. The officious mother's ""comic"" turns are accompanied by her inability to handle her PC and her dog doing most embarrassing thing by her side.Here his film is not only unoriginal, unfunny and irritating, but impossible in more than one way. If your daughter is Mandy Moore, you don't need to ""set up"" a date. Guys would just keep coming to her, asking for a date. Yes, she sometimes laughs strangely and her mom calls it ""a kiss of death,"" but I find it charming and I believe I'm not the only one to think so. After all, it's Mandy Moore.And even if you do seek the right person for your daughter and if you do it on the internet, the chances are you meet better candidates for her date than the stereotyped characters assorted here including the one on the short list played by Tom Everett Scott. OK, I know Michael Lehmann did ""Heathers,"" refreshingly dark and original comedy, but that was about 18 years ago.But perhaps the biggest problem of the film is Diane Keaton herself, whose performance as loopy and overbearing mother failed to charm us. In ""Because I Said So"" she just keeps annoying us. As if to cover up that fact, the film also contains several slapstick jokes. In one scene Keaton's character is required to do one, a ""face in the cake"" joke that made me sad. What would Woody Allen say about it?
