We had taped this movie a long time ago when it was playing a then channel with no commercial interruptions. The channel at the time would have advertisements before and after the movie played but not during. So the taped version was the only copy we had. I have been looking literally for years for this movie and I was ecstatic to find it available. The actors Jeanne Crain, William Holden and Edmund Gwenn played their roles perfectly. Very genuine, warm and so funny. Some may consider this movie to have a simple story line, but look a little deeper and you'll see how these situations could transport to this day an age. Returning service men struggling to make ends meet with limited finances. They are trying to support a family with basic needs while at the same time trying to further their education. You learn about sacrifices people have to make, the sadness and loss due to a miscarriage and of lonely people who no longer feel needed or useful. It is a tender hearted movie, very enjoyable and a great date night movie.

1162041,A2F7XTL4KHDZME,B001990LKK,Stephen Reginald,"[8, 8]","One of the great movies that dealt with WWII veterans and their return to civilian life that is almost forgotten today. Like director George Seaton's ""Miracle on 34th Street"" the year before, ""Apartment for Peggy"" mixes drama with humor. Seaton gets a wonderful performance from Jeanne Crain. The role of Peggy fits her like a glove. If there was a movie where she deserved a Best Actress nomination, it's for this role, I think; she's a force of nature as a 19-year-old mother-to-be. William Holden as Peggy's husband Jason, and Edmund Gwenn as a retired college professor are also good, with Gwenn being particularly poignant as a lonely widower who reluctantly takes the couple into his home. I wish @Fox_Video had given this film the DVD A-treatment. It deserved a decent restoration (it was filmed in Technicolor) and commentary along with some extras. When released, the New York Times said it was one of the best films of the year. The on-demand DVD transfer is okay, with many of the interior scenes a little too dark. The sound is fine and the film itself holds up very well. Four stars for the movie, but 2.5 for the DVD quality. Still, I'm glad I purchased this DVD.
