In this particular case you couldn't get much closer to ""Magnum Force"" or ""Serpico"" if you tried. I suppose the younger crowd may see a little ""Assault on Precinct 13"", the remake, in this movie. Now given the acting talent and not to bad a presentation I still say this is worth at least a rental. I understand them reworking material for the kids who haven't watched all the previous versions of police corruption, that will make kids think, hey Justin Timberlake investigating corruption, cool, or whatever the word for that is these days. Great performances by Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. This however is not to say law enforcement officers will wonder is it really necessary to beat this nag (old horse) to death again.

990246,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FI8MPM,Grady Harp,"[15, 18]","Though this movie has a first rate roster of fine actors, special effects that are excellent, and a story line that is full of surprises, it wasn't picked up for studio distribution and went directly to DVD.  Perhaps it contains too much 'anti-police force' information, or perhaps it is juts one too many action flicks released during a glut, but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity, fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to DVD allows us to enjoy it.The theme is old: rookie reporter uncovers an inner circle of cops that are corrupt - in this case the F.R.A.T. (First Response Assault and Tactical) team, a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of Edison from its low point of crime, drugs, prostitution etc.  Working undercover the temptation of pocketing the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now, 15 years after its formation, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorizing innocent people etc.  The lead dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terrifyingly real gangster!) and his partner Rafe Deed (LL Cool J, even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor).  Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) catches wind of a 'bad mistake' and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his paper's boss Ashford (the always reliably fine Morgan Freeman).  Gradually Polack convinces Ashford and subsequently Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a consistently fine character actor) and they aid Pollack in this investigative reporting.  The closer Pollack gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall mall toward a series of unexpected results.Timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead, especially in the company of such seasoned actors.  But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey, and McDermott keep the well-oiled machine of a movie rolling to the very end.  No, it is not a great movie, but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message.

990250,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B000FI8MPM,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[2, 2]","I rarely resort to assigning a three to a product. If I feel compelled toward a three, I don't review it. This time, this product ""Edison Force"" gets a review. Why? Because in better hands, this could have been a really good film.WARNING: COULD CONTAIN SPOILER INFORMATIONWhy should it work? Here are my reasons:1. Morgan Freeman, a universally respected actor, whose presence in a film lends credence to its premise.2. Kevin Spacey, another top-notch actor, whose presence in a film lends credence to its premise.3. LL Cool J. What a hunk! Oh, excuse me. Got carried away. Body builder!4. Justin Timberlake. Just kidding!5. John Heard, who can play good or bad. Here he's bad. There's one scene in which he plays his power card until he realizes he needs to put it away  for now. You can visibly watch him make that switch from power wielder to man of humility.6. Dylan McDermott. I saw an ad last night showing that he will star in a police drama in the fall. I almost laughed after seeing him play a stark raving mad policeman in this film. I listed him in this category so I could mention that maybe he can really act. (Sorry, Dylan, I've never seen you act before. Is Dermott Mulrooney your brother?)7. Carey Ewes plays bad good. Who'd have thunk it? He is bad, isn't he? He is certainly oily, but what a sweet facade to hide that corruption.8. That's it. The actors alone should make this film work, but they don't. Whose fault is that?Why doesn't it work? Here are my reasons:1. The director David J. Burke. He also wrote the story.2. A film about corrupt police most often works. Here the corruption is played as caricature. The F.R.A.T. are so corrupt they have their own locked office area with windows looking in (for those excluded) and for looking out (to rub it in). If there really is this kind of conglomeration, for shame on that city. (First Response Assault and Tactical: Yes, members arrive on the scene first--special offices, remember?--then they respond by assaulting the bad guys and taking their drugs and money or other loot, commit murder and mayhem, then carry out tactical ploys to cover their badness. Or in the words of Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor: We bad! We bad!)3. Justin Timberlake: Here he looks too young for the part. His acting also proves a director makes the difference because Justin is excellent in ""Alpha Dog"" and certainly looks that role. Plus, his ""girlfriend"" looks more a mother than a GF.4. LL Cool J. Yes, he is on both lists, too. Why here? He has two facial expressions: lifted left brow and not lifted. He uses both expressions in potentially compromised scenes and in those when he seeks revelation and justice. Not his fault.5. McDermott's character is so out of control and so blatant about it. I blame the director. (I understand McDermott is excellent in ""The Practice."" I wouldn't have guessed it.)Enough. With such a fabulous cast of actors and potentially powerful story line, ""Edison Force"" should have worked. It did, if you like caricature. But that's just my opinion.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[5, 8]","With an all-star cast including Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, LL Cool J, Dylan McDermott and Justin Timberlake you would think there might be something worthwhile to salvage from this stereotypical crime drama.  You'd be wrong.Edison Force is the story of a city brought back from the depths with the help of its police force.  Fifteen years ago Edison was the murder capital of America, its biggest industry was the production of crystal meth, and drive-by shootings were standard practice.  This all changed with the introduction of F.R.A.T. (First Response Assault and Tactical), an undercover police agency.  They whipped their poor city back into shape, and in the meantime kept all the drugs, money, etc. for themselves and the politicians and businessmen who had a vested interest in seeing the city thrive.The crime drama centers around a F.R.A.T. operation gone wrong. Dylan McDermott plays your typical bad cop and does his very best to channel Denzel Washington in Training Day--complete with emotional breakdown. LL Cool J is his good cop partner who just wants to do the right thing.  Justin Timberlake is a novice reporter who has just stumbled upon the story that's going to make him famous. Morgan Freeman is the more experienced journalist who tries to keep him in line.Overall, this movie was overly dramatic and takes itself way too seriously. JT's performance wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, though it's pretty evident he should just stick to his day job. If you're in the mood for a mediocre crime drama, pick this one up.

Promptly after establishing its ""corrupt police force"" story, it refuses to do anything other than row its boat down the same predictable plotlines that have been established in hundreds of other movies with the same intentions and goals.  It's question -- ""When you live in a police state, who will police the police?"" -- is old, old news, and it doesn't bother trying to come up with any spice to add to the formula.The producers, it seems, tried to boost the bland backbone of their film with some big names -- Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and Justin Timberlake in one of his first big-screen roles -- but all of these guys seem to be aware that they're dawdling their fingers in a movie that, while not a dud, is also no big deal.  Kevin Spacey, especially, floats through each scene with a nonchalance that makes it seem like his role is just a favor being repayed without enthusiasm.LL Cool J is asked by the script to bear the emotional brunt of the film, and as the reluctant Inside Man (I use the term loosely), his performance only seconds the aggressively pushy job done by Dylan McDermott, who plays LL's gleefully dirty partner.  They represent the yin and the yang of the F.R.A.T. force, a group of elite, ""above-the-law"" officers who are the knuckles and the bankroll of the city they live in, a sprawling metropolis named Edison.  One tries to contain his morals, and the other his bulldog allegiance to the behind-the-scenes brutality that keeps the corrupt city fathers afloat.  Insert the plucky reporter (the waifish Timberlake, in as femmy a role as you're ever bound to see him in) who ruffles feathers by poking his nose where it doesn't belong.  Whoops!  There goes the status quo.There's honestly nothing that bad about the film, but it is so watered down by its adherence to cliche and commonness that it is good for very little other than wasting an hour and a half.  It's one of those rare movies that will neither entertain nor bore.  For die-hard film-fiends like myself, you could do a lot worse.

There is actually some nice cinematography in places as well, like when Timberlake reads over a court transcript and the witnesses show up under the transcript in black and white saying the lines Timberlake's finger is moving over down the page.  So I have given the film a 3-star rating for things like this.  Other things like the bad guys being so one-dimensional, just make me feel I cannot do better when combined with other things.

I'm strolling along, minding my own business, remembering the glory days of movies packed with great actors like ""The Usual Suspects"", ""The Generals Daughter"", or ""L.A. Confidential"".  Lo and behold, a film starring not just Morgan Freeman, but also the consistently awesome Kevin Spacey?  But wait, what is LL Cool J doing on the cover?  He's hiding Morgan and Spacey!  Wait a minute, is that Justin Timberlake in the background looking scared and meek?  After long debate with myself (and listening to my wife laugh at me because I'm considering renting a movie starring Justin Timberlake), I finally decide to give it a shot.Obviously, ""Edison Force"" doesn't hold a candle to any of the classic cop movies previously mentioned.  The plot is pretty standard fare.  A corrupt unit of cops is stealing drugs and money, murdering anyone who might get in the way or tattle on their illicit activities.  Our young hero Timberlake uncovers the corruption and discovers that it goes way higher than he ever could have imagined.  There are requisite shoot outs (complete with horrible CGI fire effects!), adequate dialog, and an acceptable ending to the whole ordeal.The problems occur exactly where you'd think they would.  Two of the best actors alive are placed next to two people who really should go back to music.  I could possibly understand, if you took a couple of really big bong hits first, how an innocent casting agent might decide LL Cool J was a good choice for this role, but there is honestly no excuse for Timberlake's presence at all.  While his acting wasn't as terrible as some other musical crossover actors in recent memory, the stigma surrounding him as an effeminate teeny bopper ruins anything he tries to do.  You will be yelling at the TV every time he tries to do anything clever or Mcguver-esque.  He also looks incredibly uncomfortable and generally ruins the tone when in a scene alone with Spacey and Freeman.  While Cool J does a decent job with the script he's been given, the storyline surrounding his character is the most annoying in the movie, so it's hard to like his character at all.  Although Freeman and Spacey have relatively small roles, their acting carries the whole movie, preventing it from being as bad as it could have been.Overall Edison Force is moderately watchable (if you try real hard to ignore everything Timberlake says or does), just realize before you rent that this movie will soon be a TNT ""Movie for Guys who Like Movies"" special.",2,Direct to DVD.

The story sounds engaging...corrupt cops and an young aspiring journalist out to expose innercity crimes.  The script however was poorly written, production executed worse. Even Hollywood heavy hitters, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, were not able to save the film.  Both are off the screen most of the time. Surprisingly, Justin Timberlake is more than competent.
