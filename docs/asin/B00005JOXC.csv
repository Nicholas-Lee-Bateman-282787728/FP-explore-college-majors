643604,ADOUBP7AMWGKU,B00005JOXC,"Adam Cole ""adamjoncole""","[5, 6]","I have nothing but praise for this show. Although it may sound like another variation of CSI, Bones only shares the same genre and that's about it. In Bones, the police procedural side of things disappears in favour of the lab work, and the mysteries are usually more fascinating than the ""Who-killed-this-guy?"" approach we usually see. (How often does a CSI plot involve underground catacombs, a serial killer who uses tumours to kill his victims, or a search for lost treasure? Just to name a few). Bones is a fun yet cerebral, often dark and often moving series, full of clever and engaging plots, and a cast of very appealing characters.The two leads are a definite source of the show's strength. Emily Deschanel as ""Bones"" has got to be the least stereotypical television heroine in years. She's all brains, totally analytical and professional, making her at once both brilliant and isolated. Bones' lack of social skills, non-existent knowledge of popular culture, and her extremely literal way of taking things makes her seem adorably naive. It is as though she's an alien transplanted to Earth who can't quite adjust to the unusual Earth people surrounding her. At first, Bones comes across as abrupt, insensitive and something of a spoilt brat (like many a professor I've known). However, as the series progresses it becomes clear that Bones' ultra-rational approach to the world is a well developed defense for a vulnerable person who, abandoned at a tender age, has had to raise herself through the hardest growing up years alone, with only her intellect to rely on.Agent Booth (David Boreanz) on the other hand, provides the human face of the team. Booth serves a number of important roles in Bones' world, aside from that of rugged hero type. With the possible exception of Angela (Bones' best friend), Booth is about the only member of the team whose feet are firmly set in reality. Although he may be lacking in the intellectual sophistry of the rest of the team, more often than not Booth is the one who pulls all the pieces of the puzzle together to solve the mystery. There is a distinct impression, particularly in the earlier episodes, that Booth also serves as the diplomatic liaison between Bones and the people in the outside world she tends to rub the wrong way. Despite being an outsider, Booth seems to have more control over Bones' team than she does, and seems to be the one person who can keep the ""squints"" as he calls them on task. Most importantly, Booth fills in the role of the overprotective big brother that Bones seems to have needed all along. (In fact, in one rather touching episode, Booth winds up rescuing Bones twice PLUS interrogates her latest date to make sure he's up to scratch).Although the series has its cliches - the hero with the dark past, the will-they-won't-they subplot - it only casually touches on them, then subverts them. Booth is a war hero who is haunted by the things he has done, but contrary to the standard cliche, he is still proud of his millitary background, fiercely devoted to his country, and seems to be better adjusted than everyone around him. Bones is an orphan, but contrary to cliche, she seems to enjoy being her own person and isn't searching for a substitute family. Bones and Booth are constantly being stuck in will-they-won't-they situations, but the scripts make it so obvious that he sees her as a bratty little sister that there is no way the cliche can be realised without a lot of Freudian implications. Even the casting of Deschanel is, in itself, quite contrary to cliche. With slightly unusual facial structure, a nublike nose and ears that stick out like wings, plus a slight gawkiness that is quite charming, she is about as far from the typical female lead look you can get. Maybe that's what makes her so convincing as a Professor at the Jeffersonian (certainly a more convincing casting than Jessica Alba or Sharon Stone). Her appearance is definitely striking, but again, more for her alien-ness than as a movie star. In short, she's perfect for the role and not just a piece of eye candy.Bones is well worth viewing. If you want an entertaining and fun story, with well-crafted characters, that actually steps outside the bounds of typical cliches, this is it. Let's hope it gets the kudos it deserves.",5,Wonderfully enjoyable and clever show,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,4302,"['have', 'nothing', 'praise', 'show', 'may', 'sound', 'variation', 'CSI', 'Bones', 'only', 'shares', 'same', 'genre', 'Bones', 'police', 'procedural', 'side', 'things', 'disappears', 'favour', 'lab', 'work', 'mysteries', 'are', 'usually', 'more', 'fascinating', 'Who-killed-this-guy', 'approach', 'usually', 'see', 'How', 'often', 'CSI', 'plot', 'involve', 'underground', 'catacombs', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'tumours', 'kill', 'victims', 'search', 'lost', 'treasure', 'Just', 'name', 'few', 'Bones', 'fun', 'yet', 'cerebral', 'often', 'dark', 'often', 'moving', 'series', 'full', 'clever', 'engaging', 'plots', 'cast', 'very', 'appealing', 'characters.The', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'definite', 'source', 'show', 'strength', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'Bones', 'got', 'be', 'least', 'stereotypical', 'television', 'heroine', 'years', 'brains', 'totally', 'analytical', 'professional', 'making', 'once', 'brilliant', 'isolated', 'Bones', 'lack', 'social', 'skills', 'non-existent', 'knowledge', 'popular', 'culture', 'extremely', 'literal', 'way', 'taking', 'things', 'seem', 'adorably', 'naive', 'alien', 'transplanted', 'Earth', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'adjust', 'unusual', 'Earth', 'people', 'surrounding', 'first', 'Bones', 'abrupt', 'insensitive', 'something', 'spoilt', 'brat', 'many', 'professor', ""'ve"", 'known', 'However', 'series', 'clear', 'Bones', 'ultra-rational', 'approach', 'world', 'well', 'developed', 'defense', 'vulnerable', 'person', 'who', 'abandoned', 'tender', 'age', 'had', 'raise', 'hardest', 'growing', 'up', 'years', 'alone', 'only', 'intellect', 'rely', 'on.Agent', 'Booth', 'David', 'Boreanz', 'other', 'hand', 'human', 'face', 'team', 'Booth', 'number', 'important', 'roles', 'Bones', 'world', 'aside', 'rugged', 'hero', 'type', 'possible', 'exception', 'Angela', 'Bones', 'best', 'friend', 'Booth', 'only', 'member', 'team', 'feet', 'are', 'firmly', 'set', 'reality', 'may', 'be', 'lacking', 'intellectual', 'sophistry', 'rest', 'team', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'Booth', 'one', 'who', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'together', 'solve', 'mystery', 'distinct', 'impression', 'particularly', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'Booth', 'also', 'diplomatic', 'liaison', 'Bones', 'people', 'outside', 'world', 'rub', 'wrong', 'way', 'being', 'outsider', 'Booth', 'have', 'more', 'control', 'Bones', 'team', 'be', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'keep', 'squints', 'task', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Booth', 'role', 'overprotective', 'big', 'brother', 'have', 'needed', 'along', 'fact', 'one', 'rather', 'touching', 'episode', 'Booth', 'up', 'rescuing', 'Bones', 'twice', 'PLUS', 'latest', 'date', 'make', 'sure', 'up', 'scratch', 'series', 'cliches', 'hero', 'dark', 'past', ""will-they-won't-they"", 'subplot', 'only', 'casually', 'touches', 'then', 'Booth', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'haunted', 'things', 'done', 'contrary', 'standard', 'cliche', 'still', 'proud', 'millitary', 'background', 'fiercely', 'devoted', 'country', 'be', 'better', 'adjusted', 'everyone', 'Bones', 'orphan', 'contrary', 'cliche', 'enjoy', 'being', 'own', 'person', ""n't"", 'searching', 'substitute', 'family', 'Bones', 'Booth', 'are', 'constantly', 'being', 'stuck', ""will-they-won't-they"", 'situations', 'scripts', 'make', 'so', 'obvious', 'bratty', 'little', 'sister', 'way', 'cliche', 'can', 'be', 'realised', 'lot', 'Freudian', 'implications', 'Even', 'casting', 'Deschanel', 'quite', 'contrary', 'cliche', 'slightly', 'unusual', 'facial', 'structure', 'nublike', 'nose', 'ears', 'stick', 'out', 'wings', 'slight', 'gawkiness', 'quite', 'charming', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'typical', 'female', 'lead', 'look', 'can', 'get', 'Maybe', 'what', 'so', 'convincing', 'Professor', 'Jeffersonian', 'certainly', 'more', 'convincing', 'casting', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'appearance', 'definitely', 'striking', 'again', 'more', 'alien-ness', 'movie', 'star', 'short', 'perfect', 'role', 'not', 'just', 'piece', 'eye', 'candy.Bones', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'want', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'story', 'well-crafted', 'characters', 'actually', 'steps', 'bounds', 'typical', 'cliches', 'Let', 'hope', 'kudos']",Bones

I think the cast clicks well together and the chemistry between Seeley and Bones is very good.  I enjoy the stories and I like the fact that it's set in DC and not NY, LA or the rest of the typical places.What I really wanted to do was give the packaging ONE star.  If I had paid the full price of $50.00 and not gotten it on sale for half that here at Amazon, I would be extremely upset.  The discs come in cheap slim cases -- 2 discs to a case.  There isn't a single printed image on the discs and you practically have to get out a magnifying glass to read the very small print around the inner hole to see which disc you are looking at.  It came without a insert that would talk about the episodes and instead it's all in small print on the back of each jewel case.There's nothing to this set.  Good thing the show stands on it's own.

643613,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B00005JOXC,Annie Feng,"[9, 16]","Bones started weak but eventually got very smart and exciting episode by episode. It was pretty obvious that the writers are brainstorming on the way as the season progresses, and wrote a few ""try-out"" episodes. But eventually they got into it, settled down with a solid ideal in where the storyline is going (and of course that's after it's being confirmed that Bones is staying for a second season YAY!) and the story became very strong.David Boreanaz, our beloved actor of Angel, has dazzled us once again with his talent of the ability to take on muli-different roles and personalities. His Booth character's silliness, humor and charm takes a while to get use to (after that depressing depressing season five of Angel can you blame me?). But it was definitely a breath of fresh air, it helped us move on, lean us away from that horridly sad reality of a fantasy (heh) and gave us a character who isn't in constant danger of sinking into hell or turn evil or being misunderstood. It was a great change, and I'm almost out of Angel withdrawal, just a few more seasons and I will be out of my depression (I think... :P). He captured that ex-sniper ex-ranger but at the same time a very normal average American perfectlly! His talent showed off in that fantastic episode Soldier In The Grave, in which his dark side and inner conflict surfaced as well as his breaking down of emotion of the ""things he did"". It was a brilliant performance.On the other hand, the Scully (so to speak) star and main character of the show, Dr. Temperance Brennen, lovingly addressed ""Bones"" by her partner Booth, was the perfect scientist. Although Emily is just not a good actor as David, she tries very very hard in trying to master her role, had lots of practice, and her acting got better. But from Woman In The Limbo, I was deeply disappointed to see that she had not shown ANY natural talent in mastering human facial expression. The writers set it up perfectlly for her- denial, grief, nostaligicism, sadness, anger... but her transformation from each emotion has no precision like that of David, so not only was it unnatural, but it made her acting very ""hard"". Before that I've always thought it was her role, that she is suppose to be like that. But sorry, you are either convinced or you are not; when you have your mother's skull in your hand, there must be at least SOME difference, but she seemed like always, with the blinking of the eyes and the firmness of the jaw (that sometimes makes it like she was yelling), it just did not go well. And it made me (sadly) realize that the reason why she's SO PERFECT for this role is simply that she LOOKED like the perfect Anthropologist. David's performance made me BELIEVE the horror of what he did, even though it wasn't something that is conceptually wrong, I was utterly convinced just how horrible it was. But Emily's performance did not waver me as much, even though her condition should've been the one that has the most appeal to me. David is just light years above Emily I'm (almost) sad to say. But heck, practice makes perfect, maybe as the series goes on Emily will get better and better, who knows, her acting is not as nearly as bad as some of the others I've seen. But I can only say that from the overall reflection of this season, she still has a way to go.This show's strength lies at the chemistry-filling character interaction. Booth and Brennen has lots, in which Booth drag Brennen further down to earth and turn her more and more into a human being (so to speak hehe), and Brennen gives Booth hope every day with her brilliancy that no matter what, they will catch the killer.The only thing (other than Emily's acting on that last episode) I did not like is the Hogins/Angela arc. It was too sudden and made the storyling too inconsistent. To be honest, as the series progress I found myself liking Hogins less and less, he is a very interesting character yes, but he just got so annoy, and then the writers feel need to have a Hogins/Angela chemisty, sorry, I really didn't like that.The cliffhanger at the season finalle set up season two very well. I only ask of the writers to not make Bones into an Alias-like scenario for the second season; basically please please don't change the characters over and over and over again and make us guess and guess and guess, believe me, that will just completely tire us out to the point of annoyance.

The opening (Pilot) episode is especially good. The first five minutes are worth the price of admission, when Booth arranges to have Brennan detained by homeland security at the Washington airport, just so he can stage a rescue for her. The plan backfires when Brennan flips the officer who tries to detain her on the airport floor.There are two or three more incidents like that in later episodes. Even better is when Brennan brandishes a huge silver revolver, which I can only guess is a 357 Magnum, but without the long barrel on Harry Callahan's revolver. Another stand-out episode is when the whole gang is trapped in the lab when it is shut down by a quarantine, over Christmas. A third is a late episode starring Adam Baldwin in his classic ""loose cannon"" kind of role which began in ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Firefly.""I actually rather like the role of Dr. Daniel Goodman as ""the Boss"" in place of Camille Saroyan, who replaces him in season 2, because she becomes, after about half a dozen episodes, not much more that ""one of the guys"" as Brennan reclaims her role as alpha dog (she is even above the ""king of the lab"" game between Zack and Hodgins).The one thing I noticed is that within that one season, Booth and Brennan got so close that Season 2 seemed to be dedicated to putting some distance between them. I also like the character of Sam Cullen, Booth's boss, who brings a sense of reality to the fact that sometimes Booth seems like he can do anything he wants, without FBI management and direction. He and his family play an especially poignant role in this season's episode 20.",5,As good as the second season.,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1715,"['watching', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'reminded', 'many', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'opening', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'especially', 'good', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'when', 'Booth', 'have', 'Brennan', 'detained', 'homeland', 'security', 'Washington', 'airport', 'just', 'can', 'stage', 'rescue', 'plan', 'when', 'Brennan', 'officer', 'who', 'detain', 'airport', 'are', 'two', 'three', 'more', 'incidents', 'later', 'episodes', 'Even', 'better', 'when', 'Brennan', 'huge', 'silver', 'revolver', 'can', 'only', 'guess', '357', 'Magnum', 'long', 'barrel', 'Harry', 'Callahan', 'revolver', 'stand-out', 'episode', 'when', 'whole', 'gang', 'trapped', 'lab', 'when', 'shut', 'down', 'quarantine', 'Christmas', 'third', 'late', 'episode', 'starring', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'classic', 'loose', 'cannon', 'kind', 'role', 'began', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Firefly', 'actually', 'rather', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Daniel', 'Goodman', 'Boss', 'place', 'Camille', 'Saroyan', 'who', 'season', '2', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'guys', 'Brennan', 'role', 'alpha', 'dog', 'even', 'king', 'lab', 'game', 'Zack', 'Hodgins', '.The', 'one', 'thing', 'noticed', 'one', 'season', 'Booth', 'Brennan', 'got', 'so', 'close', 'Season', '2', 'seemed', 'be', 'dedicated', 'putting', 'distance', 'also', 'character', 'Sam', 'Cullen', 'Booth', 'boss', 'who', 'sense', 'reality', 'fact', 'Booth', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'FBI', 'management', 'direction', 'family', 'play', 'especially', 'poignant', 'role', 'season', 'episode', '20']",Bones

However, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the first season of Bones, which seemed to get better with every new episode. People talk about the romantic chemistry between Agent Booth (David Boreanaz) and Dr. Brennan (Emily Deschanel), but personally I love the playful chemistry they have as friends. As intelligent as Dr. Brennan is, she doesn't possess a lot of people skills and is constantly being taught to appear more sympathetic and less harsh by Booth (in a kind of role reversal) and her best friend, Angela. As the season progresses, we see her opening up a little more and viewing other people as individuals rather than simply as part of the cultures she's studied. We also see the trust and friendship being built between her and Agent Booth. Though the show's subject matter is often very unpleasant, the main characters all have a certain charm that makes it very enjoyable to watch. The show also has a delightful sense of humor that I think is lacking in most of the other dramas on TV.

For now we have a forensic anthropologist and her FBI sidekick for the freshest most offbeat comedy duo I have ever seen on tv or film.  Bones and Booth are at one and the same time absolutely convincing as crime investigators and comic sidekicks.All cases involve corpses reduced to bones.  This is what brings Dr. Temperance Brennan (Bones) into investigations as she is a forensic anthropologist.  She is not a pathologist.  A pathologist works on dead bodies where the skin still remains.  Her partner is an FBI agent, Booth, who connects with people better than the ""all science all the time"" Brennan.  Brennan regularly insults just about everyone as she tends to see them as anthropology constructs instead of as people.  He is positively touchy feely and the soul of sensitivity compared to her.  She recognizes virtually no popular icons and does not even own a tv set.Next, there is an artist who works the cases too.  She reconstructs by computer and her art abilities the bones into visual three dimensional projections of what those bones would look like as a living person.  She can also recreate the crime in different scenarios of commision this way.  I find this absolutely fascinating and way better than anything being done on CSI.There are also two other highly skilled lab people.  Hodgkins specializes in bugs and particles and is as oddball as someone who holds multiple doctorates in such a field would be.  Zach is Bones's grad assistant and intern,  who has even less social skills than she but who is equally gifted with corpses reduced to bones.  The supporting cast has been well selected and grows on you over time.David Boreanaz, who play Booth, deserves special mention.  He is absolutely convincing as an FBI agent yet he can also turn into Jerry Lewis on a dime.

643631,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00005JOXC,Cubist,"[11, 11]","CSI and its various offspring continue to garner strong ratings on television as people are fascinated with how the authorities use state-of-the-art technology to solve crimes. The latest incarnation is Bones, a T.V. show that takes the CSI template and attempts to inject some humanity and characters that we actually care about. While the actual cases obviously take up most of an episode's running time, the personal details about the characters' lives are gradually revealed. The show took a few episodes to find its rhythm and fortunately its ratings were strong enough to allow it to get better.After the untimely demise of Angel, it is nice to see David Boreanaz in another successful show. While the writing isn't as strong, his natural charm is a large part of the appeal of his character. Also, his backstory - an army ranger sniper - hints at a slightly dark past. It also helps that he has excellent chemistry with co-star Emily Deschanel whose character also has an intriguing past - her parents disappeared when she was 15 years old. Deschanel is an excellent foil as she plays someone who is more comfortable in her lab surrounded by the remains of dead people than in a noisy nightclub filled with people. She clearly lacks the necessary people skills. However, Bones is hardly a helpless bookworm as she has plenty of strong opinions and is not afraid to voice them. She is also capable of defending herself physically as well.An easy comparison for Bones would be a combination of the partner dynamics of The X-Files with the formula of CSI. Where The X-Files dealt with supernatural crime, Bones deals with more natural crimes but the Mulder/Scully dynamic is certainly present in the relationship between Bones and Booth. What makes Bones work is not really the various cases but the characters and how we grow to care about what happens to them.The first disc features a commentary on the ""Pilot"" episode by executive producer Barry Josephson and creator/writer Hart Hanson. They touch upon the test screening process and how this resulted in a few changes to this episode.Disc three includes a commentary on ""Two Bodies in the Lab"" by actors David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel. They joke with each other in this relaxed track. The two actors make fun of the sexual tension between their characters. But what is evident from this track is the genuine chemistry between them and one can see how this translates to what we see on screen.The fourth disc features several featurettes including ""Bones - Inspired by the Life of Forensic Anthropologist and Author Kathy Reichs"" a profile of the woman whom the character of Bones is based on.""Character Profiles"" are text biographies on each of the main characters.""Squints"" takes a look Bones' team of scientists. It's an actual term that is used and the cast members talk about the dynamics between their respective characters. They talk about how fascinating the technology aspect is.Finally, there is ""The Real Definition,"" that examines some of the overtly technical terms from the show and defines them in plain English.",4,CSI with a Heart,1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,3090,"['CSI', 'various', 'offspring', 'continue', 'garner', 'strong', 'ratings', 'television', 'people', 'are', 'fascinated', 'how', 'authorities', 'use', 'state-of-the-art', 'technology', 'solve', 'crimes', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'Bones', 'T.V', 'show', 'CSI', 'template', 'attempts', 'inject', 'humanity', 'characters', 'actually', 'care', 'actual', 'cases', 'obviously', 'take', 'up', 'most', 'episode', 'running', 'time', 'personal', 'details', 'characters', 'lives', 'are', 'gradually', 'revealed', 'show', 'took', 'few', 'episodes', 'find', 'rhythm', 'fortunately', 'ratings', 'were', 'strong', 'enough', 'allow', 'get', 'better.After', 'untimely', 'demise', 'Angel', 'nice', 'see', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'successful', 'show', 'writing', ""n't"", 'strong', 'natural', 'charm', 'large', 'part', 'appeal', 'character', 'Also', 'backstory', 'army', 'ranger', 'sniper', 'hints', 'slightly', 'dark', 'past', 'also', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'co-star', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'also', 'intriguing', 'past', 'parents', 'disappeared', 'when', 'was', '15', 'years', 'old', 'Deschanel', 'excellent', 'foil', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'comfortable', 'lab', 'surrounded', 'remains', 'dead', 'people', 'noisy', 'nightclub', 'filled', 'people', 'clearly', 'necessary', 'people', 'skills', 'However', 'Bones', 'hardly', 'helpless', 'bookworm', 'plenty', 'strong', 'opinions', 'not', 'afraid', 'voice', 'also', 'capable', 'defending', 'physically', 'well.An', 'easy', 'comparison', 'Bones', 'would', 'be', 'combination', 'partner', 'dynamics', 'X-Files', 'formula', 'CSI', 'Where', 'X-Files', 'dealt', 'supernatural', 'crime', 'Bones', 'more', 'natural', 'crimes', 'Mulder/Scully', 'dynamic', 'certainly', 'present', 'relationship', 'Bones', 'Booth', 'What', 'Bones', 'work', 'not', 'really', 'various', 'cases', 'characters', 'how', 'grow', 'care', 'what', 'them.The', 'first', 'disc', 'commentary', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'executive', 'producer', 'Barry', 'Josephson', 'creator/writer', 'Hart', 'Hanson', 'touch', 'test', 'screening', 'process', 'how', 'resulted', 'few', 'changes', 'episode.Disc', 'three', 'commentary', 'Two', 'Bodies', 'Lab', 'actors', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'joke', 'other', 'relaxed', 'track', 'two', 'actors', 'make', 'fun', 'sexual', 'tension', 'characters', 'what', 'evident', 'track', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'what', 'see', 'screen.The', 'fourth', 'disc', 'features', 'several', 'featurettes', 'including', 'Bones', 'Inspired', 'Life', 'Forensic', 'Anthropologist', 'Author', 'Kathy', 'Reichs', 'profile', 'woman', 'whom', 'character', 'Bones', 'based', 'Character', 'Profiles', 'are', 'text', 'biographies', 'main', 'characters', 'Squints', 'look', 'Bones', 'team', 'scientists', 'actual', 'term', 'used', 'cast', 'members', 'talk', 'dynamics', 'respective', 'characters', 'talk', 'how', 'fascinating', 'technology', 'aspect', 'is.Finally', 'Real', 'Definition', 'overtly', 'technical', 'terms', 'show', 'plain', 'English']",Bones

Being a fan of David Boreanaz I thought I would give this show a try. I'm not normally a fan of crime shows but as I stated a had an interest in the cast. While I enjoyed Boreanaz in it as I knew I would I fell in love with Emily Deschanel's character. She plays one of the most interesting people on television today.The banter that goes on between these two main characters is a joy to watch. I'll even say that the two of them may have the best chemistry on tv. Boreanaz plays tough as nails but nice guy in the inside  Agent Seely Booth, and Deschanel plays Dr Temperance Brennan a forensic anthropologist. Booth who works for the FBI investigates the murders that occur and Brennan determines the cause of death and uncovers clues based on the bones.Each episode plays as a stand alone but the character dynamics build throughout the season and really is a joy to watch. As I said I'm not a huge fan of crime dramas but if for nothing else I deeply enjoyed the cast of this excellent show.

All through the series each disc reminds you to turn it over for more episodes. That is until you get to the last disc. Then there is no reminder. I tried watching this series a few times and each time at the beginning of season 2 I would get mad because the plot fell apart. It was not until I took out a magnifying glass and read in tiny print around the inner part of the last disc that I read about other episodes on the flip side.

The subject matter was intelligent, the observations of such depth and the plot to captivating that I was hooked.For a birthday gift, I decided to buy Season 1 for Alex Ariano and now we can't have enough of Bones, watching an episode per night so we may be acquiring the entire collection.Bones is based on the science of forensics with episodes that cover crimes committed where the evidence, for the most part bones, is the remains of people so disfigured or decomposed that only a group of experts could unravel the mysterious deaths.Combine a forensic anthropologist, an FBI agent, and the Smithsonian Institute experts assigned to each case and the possibilities are endless. The main characters are FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, masterfully played by David Boreanaz and Dr. Temperance Brennan, AKA Bones, played by Emily Deschanel with such appeal that we simply love her intellectual brilliance. Emily Deschanel provides a character that is honest, direct, lacking in social skills but providing direct statements with such a straight face that it is actually humorous.The episodes are based on Dr. Brennan being called to crime scenes where she examines human remains of murdered victims to solve the case. While FBI Special Agent Booth is very good in his role, he is devoid of forensic or scientific knowledge and it is that special bond that is formed between a good detective and an amazing scientist that hooks you from the start.As the episodes unfold, we become involved in the lives and relationships of the characters, finding that after a few episodes are complete, we are part of the family of Bones.Michaela Conlin playing the role of Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro, is a forensic artist that has invented a three dimensional reconstruction program that generates holograms that provide the team with a vision of the victim's features. Razor sharp technology!Erick Millegan plays the role of Zachary Uriah Addy, a graduate student who assists Dr. Brennan as he awaits his doctorate in Forensic Anthropology. Of all the characters, Zach is one of our favorites because he demonstrates extreme intelligence, an IQ of over 160, a genius, and yet, adorable in his inability to decipher the most basic of human emotions.T. J. Thyne plays the role of wealthy Jack Stanley Hodgins, an entomologist who reads spores, minerals, and bugs. He balances Zach and challenges FBI Special Agent Booth with his conspiracy theories.The special features provided with Season 1 revealed that the show is based on the real life of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs. The episodes are based on the written crime novel series written by her. The soundtrack album titled Bones Original TV Soundtrack was produced by Maria Alonte McCoy and Billy Gottlieb.",5,"Bones, a brilliant TV Series, don't miss it!",1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,2866,"['One', 'night', 'making', 'dinner', 'turned', 'TV', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'part', 'episode', 'Bones', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'intelligent', 'observations', 'such', 'depth', 'plot', 'captivating', 'was', 'hooked.For', 'birthday', 'gift', 'decided', 'buy', 'Season', '1', 'Alex', 'Ariano', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'Bones', 'watching', 'episode', 'night', 'may', 'be', 'acquiring', 'entire', 'collection.Bones', 'based', 'science', 'forensics', 'episodes', 'cover', 'crimes', 'committed', 'where', 'evidence', 'most', 'part', 'bones', 'remains', 'people', 'so', 'disfigured', 'decomposed', 'only', 'group', 'experts', 'could', 'unravel', 'mysterious', 'deaths.Combine', 'forensic', 'anthropologist', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Smithsonian', 'Institute', 'experts', 'assigned', 'case', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Seeley', 'Booth', 'masterfully', 'played', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Dr.', 'Temperance', 'Brennan', 'AKA', 'Bones', 'played', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'such', 'appeal', 'simply', 'love', 'intellectual', 'brilliance', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'honest', 'direct', 'lacking', 'social', 'skills', 'providing', 'direct', 'statements', 'straight', 'face', 'actually', 'humorous.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'based', 'Dr.', 'Brennan', 'being', 'called', 'crime', 'scenes', 'where', 'human', 'remains', 'murdered', 'victims', 'solve', 'case', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Booth', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'devoid', 'forensic', 'scientific', 'knowledge', 'special', 'bond', 'formed', 'good', 'detective', 'amazing', 'scientist', 'start.As', 'episodes', 'unfold', 'become', 'involved', 'lives', 'relationships', 'characters', 'finding', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'complete', 'are', 'part', 'family', 'Bones.Michaela', 'Conlin', 'playing', 'role', 'Angela', 'Pearly', 'Gates', 'Montenegro', 'forensic', 'artist', 'invented', 'three', 'dimensional', 'reconstruction', 'program', 'holograms', 'provide', 'team', 'vision', 'victim', 'features', 'Razor', 'sharp', 'technology', 'Erick', 'Millegan', 'role', 'Zachary', 'Uriah', 'Addy', 'graduate', 'student', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Brennan', 'doctorate', 'Forensic', 'Anthropology', 'characters', 'Zach', 'one', 'favorites', 'extreme', 'intelligence', 'IQ', '160', 'genius', 'yet', 'adorable', 'inability', 'decipher', 'most', 'basic', 'human', 'emotions.T', 'J.', 'Thyne', 'role', 'wealthy', 'Jack', 'Stanley', 'Hodgins', 'entomologist', 'who', 'spores', 'minerals', 'bugs', 'Zach', 'challenges', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Booth', 'conspiracy', 'special', 'features', 'provided', 'Season', '1', 'revealed', 'show', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'forensic', 'anthropologist', 'Kathy', 'Reichs', 'episodes', 'are', 'based', 'written', 'crime', 'novel', 'series', 'written', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'titled', 'Bones', 'Original', 'TV', 'Soundtrack', 'was', 'produced', 'Maria', 'Alonte', 'McCoy', 'Billy', 'Gottlieb']",Bones

643654,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JOXC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[278, 284]","Good to see Bones: The Complete First Season is out on dvd. I've waited for this. Debuting in September 2005 on the Fox Network, Bones very quickly garnered rave reviews and amassed a loyal following. Bones is loosely inspired by real life forensic anthropologist and author Kathy Reichs. This funny, clever, sometimes gross, and totally addictive crime drama centers around forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperence Brennan (Emily Deschanel), who toils out of the Jeffersonian Institution and, on the side, writes mysteries starring her fictional heroine (and here's the twist) Kathy Reichs. Because Brennan has an almost supernatural ability to generate accurate assumptions based on her examination of the corpse's bones, she is often consulted by the FBI on difficult, seemingly unsolvable cases. She is frequently partnered by brash wiseacre FBI Special Agent Seely Booth (David Boreanaz), who seems to hold a bias against science and those who practice in that field. It's Booth who breezily saddles Brennan with the nickname ""Bones."" Naturally intuitive and freewheeling, Booth immediately is at odds with the clinically analytical Brennan. But, despite their personality clashes, and with the aid of Brennan's gifted and quirky colleagues, the cases do get solved.It's no great secret that the palpable chemistry between Deschanel and Boreanaz is what actually propels the show and is what separates it from the other, more formulaic, dispassionate crime dramas. Every week, fans tune in for the leads'  deliciously caustic banter more so than for the weekly dose of mystery. You see, the mystery jones can be fixed by viewing any other one of the gazillion forensic dramas so currently prevalent on the airwaves. So the mystery is basically the MacGuffin that drives the show forward. But the cantankerous chemistry - that palpable ""something"" between the two leads as they hilariously bicker and wrangle - is definitely unique to this show. You won't find this sort of wicked rapport going on in any of the CSI or Law & Order shows.Emily Deschanel  is a find. I haven't seen her before but she's awfully good and ingratiating enough with her acerbic character. She imbues Brennan with a cooly detached yet vulnerable and lonely quality that intrigues and endears her to the fans. Her social awkwardness and pop culture ignorance are also quite charming. It's pretty funny that a mention made regarding a pop culture reference almost always elicits a response of ""I don't know what that means"" from the clueless Bones. And, of course, her expertise in the martial arts doesn't detract from her allure.And David Boreanaz. Yeah, I found it difficult going, at first, watching him in a new role, seeing as how I'm a fan of Buffy and Angel. But it helps that Booth isn't much like our vampire with a soul. This ex-Army Ranger Special Agent is breezy, personable, and outgoing, not brooding, tortured, and introspective like Angelus (although Booth, also, is trying to atone for past actions). So, the transition, while disconcerting for me, was ultimately smooth enough. Boreanaz brings such command, self-assurance and charm to his character that I bought into it soon enough.My favorite episodes are the pilot episode, where we are introduced to the cast; ""The Man in the Fallout Shelter"" - the team is quarantied together in the Jeffersonian during Christmas and we learn personal stuff about the characters; ""Two Bodies in the Lab"" - character development galore in this episode as Brennan dates on-line and is targeted while she works on two cases; ""The Superhero in the Alley"" - a decomposed body is found wearing a superhero costume; and ""The Woman in Limbo"" - a gripping, emotional season finale as Brennan discovers shocking facts about her parents.Special Features contain episode commentaries on the ""Pilot"" (with Exec. Producer Barry Josephson & Series Creator Hart Hanson) and ""Two Bodies in the Lab"" (with David Boreanaz & Emily Deschanel); Disc 4 has ""Squints"" - an 8-minute-long behind-the-scenes look; ""The Real Definition"" - A ""squint's"" guide to forensic terminology; and ""Bones: Inspired by the Life of Forensic Anthropologist and Author Kathy Reichs"" (with, of course, an interview with Kathy Reichs); and character profiles.So, to sum it up, this show has a lot to offer. It has a fabulous cast, great character development, and engrossing, well-crafted  storylines. The forensic geek, the drama lover, the repartee admirer, the romantic (have patience) - all can meet here and each is guaranteed to come away with something from this intense, smart, funny series.

643657,A1SCJWCMQ3W3KK,B00005JOXC,Irishgal,"[1, 1]","Since ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" debuted in October 2000, forensic shows have flooded the airwaves, each with a slightly different take on the idea of scientists solving crimes. So what makes ""Bones"" one of television's most under-rated dramas?Like most forensics shows, ""Bones"" operates on the premise that science can be used to solve crimes. Forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) is world-renowned for her work at identifying victims through their skeletal remains, and she is one of the Jeffersonian (Smithsonian)'s best scientists. Brennan, however, is not good with the living, and despite her intelligence and success as a mystery novelist, she struggles to connect with people. After working in collaboration with the FBI on a few cases, she is assigned to work with Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), a former Army sniper who is convinced that cops - not scientists - solve crimes. Booth is as smooth as he is smart, and his ability to connect with people aids him in solving crimes.It's no surprise that Booth and Brennan (whom he has sarcastically nicknamed ""Bones"" - hence the show's title) clash over just about everything, from religion to families to who is going to drive to the crime scenes. Despite their near-constant bickering, the duo manage to complement each other, and with Brennan's colleagues, the lovable ""squints"", they are succesful at their work.Along with Boreanaz and Deschanel, the series features several unforgettable characters, including conspiracy buff bug-and-slime guy Jack Hodgins (TJ Thyne), whimsy yet grounded forensic artist Angela Montenegro (Michaela Conlin), and Brennan's grad student, super-logical genius Zack Addy (Eric Millegan). However, it is the two series leads that allow the show to sparkle.So what makes ""Bones"" different from all the other forensics shows on television? It could be the witty banter between the characters, or the portrayal of Booth as the ""straight man"" in the world of scientists. It might even be the crimes that the show features. But most of all, it's the humor on the series. For once, this is a forensic drama that doesn't take itself too seriously.

643659,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JOXC,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 2]","This new series has a pilot and twenty-one more episodes, and to cover this series five years later you have to consider two things: the content of the episodes, or their subjects, and the characters and plot treatment.The subjects are always limited in one episode and they are often dealing with immediate reality. There is thus no surprise to find one essential subject is the Iraq war in 2005. This subject comes back in several episodes and these show that the war itself was not very clean and they reveal one attitude only: anything unjust has to be redressed. It has to be redressed because the victims of this injustice have the right to know and because the author of the injustice is a plain criminal, murderer most of the time. This attitude is all the more emphasized and even dramatized because Agent Booth is a veteran of the Kosovo war and has seen, experienced and suffered some such episodes.That's the second thing you have to keep in mind with this series: Agent Booth is an FBI agent but also a Kosovo survivor. He merges a very military dynamism, extremely precise work, a great sense of logic and deduction, total commitment to fairness and truth. This is also very important when they deal with the case of illegal immigration and more or less clandestine and illegal refugees from the Central American countries that have been ridden with civil wars most of the time supported on the wrong side by the US. On the wrong side, I will say because of what we know today, since today in most countries the left-leaning insurgency has politically recovered and electorally re-conquered power. In other words the US support and at times intervention was wasted and badly advised. And that has to do with Iraq where such an ill-advised intervention was going on at the time.The second main character is Doctor Temperance Brennan. She works for the Jeffersonian Institute and she is a bone specialist in all fields where bones have to be scrutinized, analyzed and reconstructed as to what they may tell about what happened to the person they belonged to once.  She is assisted by three people. First an art-trained person is there to recreate places and bodies from the remains or the memory of witnesses thanks to highly specialized software. Then another doctor trained in physics, chemistry and biology who has an extremely high level of knowledge in his fields and can analyze any matter, stuff or whatever that can reveal the circumstances of the death of a ""patient"". Finally a young intern who is working on his doctorate thesis and is also extremely and sharply specialized and informed in the physiology of the body or the skeleton of any person. The boss of the Jeffersonian institute is a Black man who used to be an archaeologist but who remains discreet on scientific matters.Yet the series avoids any kind of over-learned language that we wouldn't be able to understand. Nevertheless it uses a lot of the paraphernalia of software and computer assisted and aided visualization to make laboratory scenes palatable and even interesting.The final great point of this series is the very careful study of the relations between these people, administrative, authority, personal, even intimate relations and problems, knowing there are two women and three men and they all have personal lives. But the series insist on the background of Agent Booth but also of Dr Brennan: her parents disappeared when she was a young teenager, her brother abandoned her when he was 19 and is on probation for some crime. At the end of this first series the body of the mother is found, her death is clarified, Dr Brennan gets to some kind of reconciliation with her brother and the father remains alive, talkative on the phone but absent physically, in fact escaping justice as he would deserve due to his criminal past.  That's where the plot sickens for the second season.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,Police work is also ethical,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,4015,"['new', 'series', 'pilot', 'twenty-one', 'more', 'episodes', 'cover', 'series', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'consider', 'two', 'things', 'content', 'episodes', 'subjects', 'characters', 'plot', 'treatment.The', 'subjects', 'are', 'always', 'limited', 'one', 'episode', 'are', 'often', 'dealing', 'immediate', 'reality', 'thus', 'surprise', 'find', 'one', 'essential', 'subject', 'Iraq', 'war', '2005', 'subject', 'back', 'several', 'episodes', 'show', 'war', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'clean', 'reveal', 'one', 'attitude', 'only', 'anything', 'unjust', 'be', 'redressed', 'be', 'redressed', 'victims', 'injustice', 'have', 'right', 'know', 'author', 'injustice', 'plain', 'criminal', 'murderer', 'most', 'time', 'attitude', 'more', 'emphasized', 'even', 'dramatized', 'Agent', 'Booth', 'veteran', 'Kosovo', 'war', 'seen', 'experienced', 'suffered', 'such', 'second', 'thing', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'series', 'Agent', 'Booth', 'FBI', 'agent', 'also', 'Kosovo', 'survivor', 'very', 'military', 'dynamism', 'extremely', 'precise', 'work', 'great', 'sense', 'logic', 'deduction', 'total', 'commitment', 'fairness', 'truth', 'also', 'very', 'important', 'when', 'deal', 'case', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'more', 'less', 'clandestine', 'illegal', 'refugees', 'Central', 'American', 'countries', 'have', 'been', 'ridden', 'civil', 'wars', 'most', 'time', 'supported', 'wrong', 'side', 'US', 'wrong', 'side', 'will', 'say', 'what', 'know', 'today', 'today', 'most', 'countries', 'left-leaning', 'insurgency', 'politically', 'recovered', 'electorally', 're-conquered', 'power', 'other', 'words', 'US', 'support', 'times', 'intervention', 'was', 'wasted', 'badly', 'advised', 'do', 'Iraq', 'where', 'such', 'ill-advised', 'intervention', 'was', 'going', 'time.The', 'second', 'main', 'character', 'Doctor', 'Temperance', 'Brennan', 'Jeffersonian', 'Institute', 'bone', 'specialist', 'fields', 'where', 'bones', 'have', 'be', 'scrutinized', 'analyzed', 'reconstructed', 'what', 'may', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'person', 'belonged', 'once', 'assisted', 'three', 'people', 'First', 'art-trained', 'person', 'there', 'recreate', 'places', 'bodies', 'remains', 'memory', 'witnesses', 'thanks', 'highly', 'specialized', 'software', 'Then', 'doctor', 'trained', 'physics', 'chemistry', 'biology', 'who', 'extremely', 'high', 'level', 'knowledge', 'fields', 'can', 'analyze', 'matter', 'stuff', 'can', 'reveal', 'circumstances', 'death', 'patient', 'Finally', 'young', 'intern', 'who', 'working', 'doctorate', 'thesis', 'also', 'extremely', 'sharply', 'specialized', 'informed', 'physiology', 'body', 'skeleton', 'person', 'boss', 'Jeffersonian', 'institute', 'Black', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'archaeologist', 'who', 'discreet', 'scientific', 'matters.Yet', 'series', 'kind', 'over-learned', 'language', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'Nevertheless', 'lot', 'paraphernalia', 'software', 'computer', 'assisted', 'aided', 'visualization', 'make', 'laboratory', 'scenes', 'palatable', 'even', 'interesting.The', 'final', 'great', 'point', 'series', 'very', 'careful', 'study', 'relations', 'people', 'administrative', 'authority', 'personal', 'even', 'intimate', 'relations', 'problems', 'knowing', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'three', 'men', 'have', 'personal', 'lives', 'series', 'insist', 'background', 'Agent', 'Booth', 'also', 'Dr', 'Brennan', 'parents', 'disappeared', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'teenager', 'brother', 'abandoned', 'when', 'was', '19', 'probation', 'crime', 'end', 'first', 'series', 'body', 'mother', 'found', 'death', 'clarified', 'Dr', 'Brennan', 'kind', 'reconciliation', 'brother', 'father', 'alive', 'talkative', 'phone', 'absent', 'physically', 'fact', 'escaping', 'justice', 'would', 'deserve', 'due', 'criminal', 'past', 'where', 'plot', 'second', 'season.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",Bones

It is superbly produced with fine sets, excel. photography, sci-fi story lines,brilliant cast and humor galore that should keep many a folk happy.  The choice of Emily Deschanel who I had never heard of before (I knew of her equally beautiful sister Zooey) as Dr Temperance(Bones) Brennan along with David B. (can't spell his name!)was a brilliant bit of casting.  She is a great actress whether she is a humanitarian or a self-centered bitch.  And she is sobeautiful to watch.  Angela and Hogkins along with Mr Goodman are also great choices.  The first two seasons I call ""pristine"" because they set the table for Bones & Booth to become identifiablepersonages and develop their personalities.  Their interplay & bickering remind me much of Ron Weasley & Hermminie interplay in the HARRY POTTER series which of course I purchased in the entiretyfrom AMAZON.  Also reminds me of Capt. Kirk & Spock relationships.  Some of the sexual blather bothers me a bit for a prime time show but I guess that's the way things are today.

Then while walking through Blockbuster last sping (2006), I saw the first seasons DVD there, and thought I would check it out. It did not take long till I was totally hooked. I have seen bits and pieces of the many CSI type shows out there, and some of the real life educational programs, but they were never enough to keep me coming back.In my free time at work, I eventually watched through the entire first season. This show was VERY witty, very funny, yet very intelligent and educational in the way they connected the dots and solved crimes. Of course, having such an attractive star doesn't hurt AT ALL!Shortly after finishing eason one, the season two discs came out (perfect timing). Around the same time I decided to start setting my DVR box to record the new season episodes, and at this time got my wife to sit down long enough to watch an episode with me. After one episode, she too was hooked, so we started watching the season two discs together.Now, once the younger kids are down for the night, my wife and I brew up a pot of something hot (coffee or dandelion brew), and along with our 16 year old son, sit for a most entertaining and captivating episode either on DVD or DVR of a recorded episode. Now, with the writers strike haulting season 3 episode, my family gets to enjoy reruns from seasons 1 & 2 also.The characters all have their own witty, intelligent and qirky characteristics, and it is so entertaining to watch them interact off each other. Of course the highligh of every episode (for us) centers around the back and forth dialog between the two main characters usually in the car driving to a crime scene most every episode (season 3 has changed the pace some by putting that highlight in their sesions with the therapist...my gosh, hilarious to say the least).I am just impressed that there can be such highly educational forensics happening amidst this motley crew of squints that merge and clash to cuse such humor.Great series...heck it out for sure.",5,"Intelligent, funny AND educational",1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,2087,"['do', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'TV', 'shows', 'often', 'so', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'even', 'heard', 'anything', 'show', 'Then', 'walking', 'Blockbuster', 'last', 'sping', '2006', 'saw', 'first', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'there', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'till', 'was', 'totally', 'hooked', 'have', 'seen', 'bits', 'pieces', 'many', 'CSI', 'type', 'out', 'there', 'real', 'life', 'educational', 'programs', 'were', 'never', 'enough', 'keep', 'coming', 'back.In', 'free', 'time', 'work', 'eventually', 'watched', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'VERY', 'witty', 'very', 'funny', 'yet', 'very', 'intelligent', 'educational', 'way', 'connected', 'dots', 'solved', 'crimes', 'course', 'having', 'such', 'attractive', 'star', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'AT', 'ALL', 'Shortly', 'finishing', 'eason', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'discs', 'came', 'out', 'perfect', 'timing', 'same', 'time', 'decided', 'start', 'setting', 'DVR', 'box', 'record', 'new', 'season', 'episodes', 'time', 'got', 'wife', 'sit', 'down', 'long', 'enough', 'watch', 'episode', 'one', 'episode', 'too', 'was', 'hooked', 'started', 'watching', 'season', 'two', 'discs', 'together.Now', 'once', 'younger', 'kids', 'are', 'down', 'night', 'wife', 'brew', 'up', 'pot', 'something', 'hot', 'coffee', 'dandelion', 'brew', '16', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'sit', 'most', 'entertaining', 'captivating', 'episode', 'DVD', 'DVR', 'recorded', 'episode', 'Now', 'writers', 'strike', 'haulting', 'season', '3', 'episode', 'family', 'enjoy', 'reruns', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'also.The', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'qirky', 'characteristics', 'so', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'interact', 'off', 'other', 'course', 'highligh', 'episode', 'centers', 'back', 'forth', 'dialog', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'usually', 'car', 'driving', 'crime', 'scene', 'most', 'episode', 'season', '3', 'changed', 'pace', 'putting', 'highlight', 'sesions', 'therapist', 'gosh', 'hilarious', 'say', 'least', '.I', 'am', 'just', 'impressed', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'highly', 'educational', 'forensics', 'happening', 'amidst', 'motley', 'crew', 'squints', 'merge', 'clash', 'cuse', 'such', 'humor.Great', 'series', 'heck', 'out', 'sure']",Bones

David Boreanaz (formerly of ANGEL) plays her foil, Special Agent Seeley Booth.This series has matured since it debuted in 2005. At first just another also-ran in the CSI/NCIS/COLD CASE/FORENSIC FILES/etc. mold, BONES has developed a quirky, sassy, and comic edge all to itself. BONES is based on the real-life work of Dr. Kathy Reichs, who invented the character of Bones in her novels who in turn invents a character named Kathy Reichs in her novels. Get it?Bones Brennan is brilliant and beautiful but hyperintellectual and painfully (sometimes laughably) lacking in social skills. In the first season she comes across as mechanical and almost too aloof, but the character does mature as the season progresses. Although she still suffers from Poindexter Syndrome even now, she's lovable and incredibly sexy; if women with quadruple digit IQs turn you on this is your show. It's mine.Booth is funny and good looking and charming. Boreanaz was the original drawing card for BONES, and he acquits the role well. He names Brennan Bones out of annoyance, but soon grows fond of her (and as of 2010, love blossoms).Season one is a bit stiff, but it's entertaining.

Harris ""skytag""","[31, 34]","I really enjoy this show (4.5 stars for the show), but I have some issues with this DVD release, which is why I only gave it three stars. First, it has double-sided disks. There's no justification for cheaping out with double-sided disks on a set that's selling for $42.49 (F Troop season 1 has 6 single-sided disks and sells for $11.99). They spent money to put the box in a plastic slipcase, but then cheaped out on the disks. Ugh. Second, as much as I like David Boreanaz (he's at least as enjoyable in this as he was in Buffy or Angel), he's really annoying in the audio commentary he does with Emily Deschanel. I appreciate the insight a good commentary offers into the making of a show, but unfortunately David Boreanaz acts like a smart aleck high school kid in this commentary, cracking jokes, making stupid comments, even interrupting Emily when she's trying to say something interesting. I finally gave up listening to it after 35 minutes or so.From a technical standpoint, though, this is a very nice release. Video and sound quality are both excellent. Now, as for the show, I really like it. It's one of those shows that does a range of things well. It can be deeply touching, hilariously funny, suspenseful, action-packed, disturbing, you name it and Bones probably goes there at times and does it well (thankfully it doesn't do soap opera). Very impressive. The science is not very believable at times and the holographic stuff is a bit much, as is the notion of a forensic lab set in the middle of a room the size of a museum, but hey, it's a TV show, and it's a great set.The casting is excellent. David Boreanaz is perfect for this role and Emily Deschanel is a joy to watch (and hear -- what a great voice). Her portrayal of Brennan as passionate and brilliant, but at times innocent and clueless is amazing. And the chemistry between Booth and Brennan really works. Jonathan Adams does a great job as Dr. Daniel Goodman (wish we saw more of him), and the other characters are all enjoyable as well. Sets, special effects, and the dead bodies are well done and production values are generally high. All things considered it's definitely worth owning, but I think the current price is a bit high. There are other, equally good shows available on DVD for under $30/season, and all other shows I know in the $40+ range have single-sided disks. I should admit, though, that nowadays I think $40+ is high for any show. Fortunately I got this new for just over $30 including shipping from one of Amazon's sellers using the New and Used link.Update: Since I wrote my initial review Amazon has dropped the price to $24.97, which I consider a very good price for a current drama series that's done as well as this is (dramas typically cost more than comedies for some reason, or so it seems). At $25 I'd probably give this DVD release 3.5-4 stars if edit that part of the review.Tip: Avoid eating and drinking during Brennen's interview at the beginning of The Woman in the Car (disk 2, side 2). It's hard to laugh that hard with food in your mouth. ;-)",3,"Fun show, issues with this release",1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,3063,"['really', 'enjoy', 'show', '4.5', 'stars', 'show', 'have', 'issues', 'DVD', 'release', 'why', 'only', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'First', 'double-sided', 'disks', 'justification', 'cheaping', 'out', 'double-sided', 'disks', 'set', 'selling', '42.49', 'F', 'Troop', 'season', '1', '6', 'single-sided', 'disks', '11.99', 'spent', 'money', 'put', 'box', 'plastic', 'slipcase', 'then', 'cheaped', 'out', 'disks', 'Ugh', 'Second', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'really', 'annoying', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'appreciate', 'insight', 'good', 'commentary', 'offers', 'making', 'show', 'unfortunately', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'smart', 'aleck', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'commentary', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'making', 'stupid', 'comments', 'even', 'interrupting', 'Emily', 'when', 'trying', 'say', 'something', 'interesting', 'finally', 'gave', 'up', 'listening', '35', 'minutes', 'so.From', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'though', 'very', 'nice', 'release', 'Video', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'Now', 'show', 'really', 'one', 'shows', 'range', 'things', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'deeply', 'touching', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'suspenseful', 'action-packed', 'disturbing', 'name', 'Bones', 'probably', 'there', 'times', 'well', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'do', 'soap', 'opera', 'Very', 'impressive', 'science', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'times', 'holographic', 'stuff', 'bit', 'much', 'notion', 'forensic', 'lab', 'set', 'middle', 'room', 'size', 'museum', 'hey', 'TV', 'show', 'great', 'set.The', 'casting', 'excellent', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'perfect', 'role', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'joy', 'watch', 'hear', 'what', 'great', 'voice', 'portrayal', 'Brennan', 'passionate', 'brilliant', 'times', 'innocent', 'clueless', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'Booth', 'Brennan', 'really', 'Jonathan', 'Adams', 'great', 'job', 'Dr.', 'Daniel', 'Goodman', 'wish', 'saw', 'more', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'well', 'Sets', 'special', 'effects', 'dead', 'bodies', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'generally', 'high', 'things', 'considered', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning', 'think', 'current', 'price', 'bit', 'high', 'are', 'other', 'equally', 'good', 'shows', 'available', 'DVD', '30/season', 'other', 'shows', 'know', '40+', 'range', 'have', 'single-sided', 'disks', 'should', 'admit', 'though', 'think', '40+', 'high', 'show', 'Fortunately', 'got', 'new', 'just', '30', 'including', 'shipping', 'one', 'Amazon', 'sellers', 'using', 'New', 'Used', 'link.Update', 'wrote', 'initial', 'review', 'Amazon', 'dropped', 'price', '24.97', 'consider', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'current', 'drama', 'series', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'dramas', 'typically', 'cost', 'more', 'comedies', 'reason', 'so', '25', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'DVD', 'release', '3.5-4', 'stars', 'edit', 'part', 'review.Tip', 'Avoid', 'eating', 'drinking', 'Brennen', 'interview', 'beginning', 'Woman', 'Car', 'disk', '2', 'side', '2', 'hard', 'laugh', 'hard', 'food', 'mouth']",Bones

643679,A12SPOVUAHCNZW,B00005JOXC,Lola,"[6, 7]","I freely admit to giving this show a shot only because I loved ANGEL.  Before watching BONES, I had no expectations other than a mild anxiety that I wouldn't be able to accept David Boreanaz in a new role.  However, I surprisingly found that all the ingredients that make me sit up and pay attention were there:1.  An intelligent female lead (Bones).  While she's also pretty and funny, she has endearing flaws.  Her superwoman-esque martial arts and marksmanship abilities (she can apparently shoot better than her FBI counterpart who used to be a sniper) are blatantly over the top.  However, I have no compunction ""giving"" that to the writers since it opens the door to occasional action sequences.  Also, it helps (a little) to fill in the gaps left by ALIAS and BUFFY.2.  Science and technology are portrayed pretty realistically (for tv) and are heavily showcased in the show.  In my book, any show that says science is sexy = super hot!3.  The interaction between scientists and noscientists (Squids and FBI agents) seems pretty realistic and fun.  Their strengths pull them in opposite directions and the clash of different philosophies and approaches to a problem are handled like a well-choreographed dance - fantastic.4.  FBI role is a perfect fit for Boreanaz.  Joss Whedon (and others) have noted that David Boreanaz sparkled when the Angel character was ""petty.""  [Season 5 of Angel succeeded (in part) because of the hilariously antagonistic relationship between Angel and Spike.]  In BONES, Boreanaz now has free reign to comedy - pettiness and hilarity abound.  Emily Deschanel (Bones) plays opposite him as everything guileless and straght-edge - I can't say enough about how perfect this chemistry is.  (This type of overblown comedic writing is exactly what draws me to romance novels.  Refreshing it is to (finally) see this on tv!  As everybody will notice right away, this follows in the footsteps of the tension between the two leads of X-FILES.  Great!)5.  The Squints are SO well done.  As a scientist with a similarly abnormal IQ to the Squints on the show, I have to say that this is one of the few shows to realistically capture the personalities of scientists.  (Ok, yeah, you don't often hear scientists ""name-dropping"" their credentials or their IQs like I just did, but, on the show, it's a necessary evil of tv exposition.)  The writers of the show might have just as easily observed my lab and jotted down our (stilted) interactions to write into the show.  The little character elements that tend to drive scientists (like how they'd rather be ""right"" than ""well-liked"" not just because they like to be right but also because they need to make sure that ""right"" has a voice) are all there.  Not only do their personalitites and quirkiness actually make sense, but we are SHOWN how smart they are, not just TOLD (though we are told often).

The writing is not bad. the actors, while improving a lot over the whole series are however somewhat problematic. Indeed they are somewhat too polsihed in a visual sense and do not give off a real ""live"" feeling so to say. They come off somewhat too youthful; maybe this was intentional in order to provide a ""geeky"" feel to the crew but it is in my opinion somehwt counterproductive given the sometimes gory content. Fortunately the gore aspect is somewhat downplayed towards the end of the series and the charactes become more realistic at the same time. Also, it is difficult to forget that Boreanaz played Angel in the Buffy series where he was really perfect and the association of his face with that series renders his credibility also somewhat less.

Well, you would be wrong. ""Bones"" does much better than just following - from the first episode it actually switches to its own ways and, if put in parallel with the venerable CSI, it could very well take the lead. And here is why.First, there is Bones herself. She is incredibly inteligent, succesful, pretty, liberated, courageous woman, fully in control of her life and perfectly able to kick a bad guy's a.. without any problem if needed. In one word, she is a genius, but she also has a serious case of social autism, which makes many of her interactions with the regular society histerically funny. As a forensic anthropologist she clearly is very comfortable around the skeletons - but her relations with living are not half that succesful. And when the recent deceased are concerned, just wait for the scene when Booth takes her for an autopsy...Then, there is agent Booth. I always liked very much David Boreanaz (""Buffy"", ""Angel"") but I was a little concerned if he still can play without turning into a vampire every two minutes or so... well, he can!! His caracter is great - he is clearly a macho, good cop but clearly not genius (unlike people he works with), in principle just a honest, simple guy - but with some secrets in his past, very much in control of his life and having some really funny habits. Quite smart, handsome and with sense of humour - Booth is surprisingly likeable.Then there is the relation between Bones and Booth - I must say that I enjoy watching it almost as much as the one that existed between Mulder an Scully. They are soooo different that they simply can not stop bickering and both being smart and having humour (although for Bones it is a little... skeletic) they exchanges are a delight. Just wait to see the episode in which Bones is charged with murder!There is more. Other members of the team working in the criminal anthropology lab are as irresistible as the main characters - there is Zack, the genius young anthropologist, who is even less adapted to life in society than Bones. There is Dr Jack Hodgins, ""slime and bugs guy"", who actually is almost normal - the stress is on word ""almost"". Finally there is Angela, an adorable Eurasian girl, who actually is an artist as much as a scientist - she designed software for graphic projects and adapted it for the reconstruction of faces and bodies from remains. She is the merriest and most normal person in the lab - although the way she gets the attention of clercs in crowded offices will probably surprise you...Stories are good, some of them very hard. The atmosphere is less gloomy that in CSI and there is definitely much more humour. After watching Grissom and his team for years I really was ready for something new, as smart as CSI, but freshier, funnier, less macabre and - surprise - even more original. I bought the first season and swallowed it in a couple of evenings. I can't wait to buy the second.",5,"I must say I ended preferring ""Bones"" to CSI",1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,3073,"['are', 'fan', 'CSI', 'who', 'not', 'will', 'probably', 'look', 'sceptically', 'show', 'following', 'tracks', 'major', 'franchise', 'Well', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'Bones', 'much', 'better', 'just', 'following', 'first', 'episode', 'actually', 'own', 'ways', 'put', 'parallel', 'venerable', 'CSI', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'take', 'lead', 'here', 'why.First', 'Bones', 'incredibly', 'inteligent', 'succesful', 'pretty', 'liberated', 'courageous', 'woman', 'fully', 'control', 'life', 'perfectly', 'able', 'kick', 'bad', 'guy', 'a..', 'problem', 'needed', 'one', 'word', 'genius', 'also', 'serious', 'case', 'social', 'autism', 'many', 'interactions', 'regular', 'society', 'histerically', 'funny', 'forensic', 'anthropologist', 'clearly', 'very', 'comfortable', 'skeletons', 'relations', 'living', 'are', 'not', 'succesful', 'when', 'recent', 'deceased', 'are', 'concerned', 'just', 'wait', 'scene', 'when', 'Booth', 'autopsy', 'Then', 'agent', 'Booth', 'always', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'still', 'can', 'play', 'turning', 'vampire', 'two', 'minutes', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'caracter', 'great', 'clearly', 'macho', 'good', 'cop', 'clearly', 'not', 'genius', 'people', 'principle', 'just', 'honest', 'simple', 'guy', 'secrets', 'past', 'very', 'much', 'control', 'life', 'having', 'really', 'funny', 'habits', 'Quite', 'smart', 'handsome', 'sense', 'humour', 'Booth', 'surprisingly', 'likeable.Then', 'relation', 'Bones', 'Booth', 'must', 'say', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'existed', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'soooo', 'different', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'bickering', 'being', 'smart', 'having', 'humour', 'Bones', 'little', 'skeletic', 'exchanges', 'are', 'delight', 'Just', 'wait', 'see', 'episode', 'Bones', 'charged', 'murder', 'more', 'Other', 'members', 'team', 'working', 'criminal', 'anthropology', 'lab', 'are', 'as', 'irresistible', 'main', 'characters', 'Zack', 'genius', 'young', 'anthropologist', 'who', 'even', 'less', 'adapted', 'life', 'society', 'Bones', 'Dr', 'Jack', 'Hodgins', 'slime', 'bugs', 'guy', 'who', 'actually', 'almost', 'normal', 'stress', 'word', 'almost', 'Finally', 'Angela', 'adorable', 'Eurasian', 'girl', 'who', 'actually', 'artist', 'as', 'much', 'scientist', 'designed', 'software', 'graphic', 'projects', 'adapted', 'reconstruction', 'bodies', 'remains', 'merriest', 'most', 'normal', 'person', 'lab', 'way', 'attention', 'clercs', 'crowded', 'offices', 'will', 'probably', 'surprise', 'Stories', 'are', 'good', 'very', 'hard', 'atmosphere', 'less', 'gloomy', 'CSI', 'definitely', 'much', 'more', 'humour', 'watching', 'Grissom', 'team', 'years', 'really', 'was', 'ready', 'something', 'new', 'as', 'smart', 'CSI', 'freshier', 'funnier', 'less', 'macabre', 'surprise', 'even', 'more', 'original', 'bought', 'first', 'season', 'swallowed', 'couple', 'evenings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'buy', 'second']",Bones

It is difficult to define it, due to the fact that it has crime, drama, mistery, and even some elements of comedy and romance. Strange, I know, but it works.The two main characters in this series are Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) and Special Agent Seely Booth (David Boreanaz). Temperance Brennan is a forensic anthropologist that works at the Jeffersonian Institution, and that also happens to write whodunnits in her free time. Seely Booth works at the FBI, and used to be an Army sniper. Of course, both characters are very different, and that is probably the reason why they clash from the very first time Temperance is asked to help out in one of Booth's cases. How can an anthropologist help the FBI solve a crime? Well, the answer is in ""Bones"", and it is more than interesting :)All in all, I must say that this show is extremely engaging, and that I think it is getting better with time. I believe that you are highly likely to love ""Bones"", if you like a good thriller that has lots of action, but that also pays attention to the interaction between the characters. I must confess that I am one of those fans of ""Bones"" that cannot wait for the beginning of its second season, and I am pretty sure you will eagerly wait for the same thing if you watch this dvd.

643690,A3OOY6Y4LBUEKP,B00005JOXC,Mechelle,"[8, 10]","I picked up season one of Bones from my local Blockbuster due to friends recommendations and being a fan of David Boreanaz's from his years of playing Angel on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I have to say that this series takes some time getting used to. Not that it's complicated or boring - but it's just....blah at first. Blah is different from boring. How? No clue. Haha. It just took me some time to get into the characters and the story itself.I liked Agent Booth from the start probably due to being a fan of David's(also the fact that he's disgustingly hot helps too). But Dr. Brennan (the other lead)? She annoyed me to no end at first. She's somewhat cold and unfeeling (you later learn why). The constant comparisons between how she and Booth differ in mindsets does become a bit jarring and ""please shut up! We get it already people!"" How in the world does Angela, who is supposedly just an artist, suddenly know everything about the human body and can come up with all these things on her nifty image machine deal? Umm. Yeah. Also the first batch of episodes just seemed to have the same plot over and over again.As the season wore on...I started to become a very big fan of this show. The episodes became better written and the storylines became more interesting. The writers started to delve into the characters backgrounds, which helped the general storyline and the viewer's ability to understand why a certain character is cold or etc. Also the chemistry between the two leads - Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan - is great stuff. Eric Millegan, who plays young genius Zach Addy, is surprisingly great and funny in his role. Still, I sometimes cringe at some of the lines, especially those said by Dr. Hodgins.

In transferring her story to the tv screen, there's not a whole lot of similarity to the books.  Emily Deschanel is wonderful in the role of Temperance Brennan, a seemingly cool and aloof forensic achaeologist who can tell a lot about people from their bones.  She works with FBI agent Seely Booth, also well played by Buffy's hunk David Boreanaz.  Their romantic banter is nicely played and we soon find out that they both aren't what they often appear to be.  Brennan can be a little harsh and her lack of social aptitude hinders her relationships, but as the season proceeds, we find out a lot about her painful past, as we do with Boreanaz too.The episodes are a little slow in pace, but each one is enjoyable and the supporting cast of Michaela Carlon, TJ Thyne, Eric Millegan and Jonathan Adams are top notch.Although BONES is reminiscent of the popular CSI trilogy, it is different in many ways, as most of the victims have been dead for a while.

643700,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B00005JOXC,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 1]","Ok, my first experience with Bones was actually the Christmas episode of this season, and I admit, I thought it was weird and didn't return to the show for a long time.  But then I saw another episode, got into the show, and decided to watch it from the beginning, get all the backstory.  And I've been hooked ever since (although I regret to say lack of cable has put my behind a bit).The first season of Bones definitely introduces us to all the characters.  In fact, Bones is named after the main character of the story; Temperance Brennan, a brilliant, if socially awkward forensic anthropologist who can definitely be considered a genius.  She is the best at what she does, and that is identify people from their remains.  And FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, the one who gave Bones her nickname, needs her for cases.  So she agrees, on the condition that she gets to go into the field with him.  And thus starts a partnership that works for both of them, solving crime with his people skills and her deduction and logic.  They have the help of a few others of course, the people Bones works with in the lab, including her assistant (also an awkward genius) Zack, her friend and an artist Angela, and Jack Hodgins, who investigates blood and slime.Episodes**This section could contain spoilers, you have been warned**Pilot:  Bones and Booth investigate the murder of a woman found in the lake, who leads to someone a little bigger and badder than they may be prepared to take down.  We also get a close look at all the characters and a bit of their history.The Man in the SUV:  When a diplomat appears to have blown up a car in a terrorist attack, killing himself at the same time, Bones and Booth try to find out why.  And the clues lead them to a plot even more dangerous.A Boy in A Tree:  When a teenager is found dead of what looks to be a suicide at an exclusive private school, Booth and Brennan investigate to find out why the school seems to want to keep it a secret.  There were also plots against the boys family, convuluting the case.The Man in the Bear:  One of the more exciting episodes, Booth drags Brennan out to a small town called Aurora where the remains of a man are found in a poached bear.  More clues lead them to believe they are chasing a cannibal in the small town.A Boy in a Bush:  The remains of a small boy are found and when his foster brothers don't appear to be telling the truth multiple suspects arise.  A look into the boys history also finds some secrets that causes Brennan to relive a little bit of her past.The Man in the Wall:  When Brennan gets into a fight at a club, and exposes a dead man behind the wall, she stumbles into another case.  Drugs, music, and rivalry seem to be behind the murder.A Man on Death Row:  Howard Epps, a man that Booth arrested is about to be given a lethal injection when he implores the team to reopen  his case.  They find a lot more than they bargain for and new clues cause them to question how the case was investigated the first time.The Girl in the Fridge:  After opening a tossed fridge and finding the remains of a girl, Brennan goes head to head with an old lover and teacher on a case.  She believes that it was murder, while the old lover believes it was accidental. And the jury is hard pressed to decide who is right.The Man in the Fallout Shelter:  Ah the Christmas episode.  Now that I've watched more of the series I was able to appreciate this episode better.  When a contamination forces the team to stay in the lab over Christmas, they learn a little more about each other, and about the body that started it all.The Woman At The Airport:  The remains of a woman are found in LA, but she has been so cosmetically altered that they can't figure out who she is.  With the help of a screenwriter/FBI agent, they look for clues to see who the girl may have been once.The Woman in the Car:  A woman is found burned and her child missing.  The father is a witness on a high profile case and refuses to cooperate until his child is found.The Superhero in the Alley:  A boy, dressed as a superhero, is found in an alley where the only clues to his death are in the comic book he helped write.The Woman in the Garden:  When a gang member is pulled over with a body in the car, Booth and Brennan find it hard to investigate due to the people's fear of police.The Man on the Fairway:  After investigating an airplane crash, bone fragments are found that indicate another murder happened in the same place.  And a man who's father went missing is more than willing to help Brennan find clues to the murder.Two Bodies in the Lab:  Brennan is nearly shot while working on a mob case but it only further determines her to keep going to find the killer.  Booth wants to keep her safe but isn't prepared to keep himself safe as well.The Woman in the Tunnel:  A body is found in the tunnels beneath the city and it may be because of hidden treasure.  Booth and Brennan have to find the treasure before the murderers get away.The Skull in the Desert:  This is probably my favorite episode of the series, although it is very sad.  Angela is visiting a boyfriend out west when he goes missing and a skull appears.  She asks Brennan for help because in her gut, she thinks it may be him.The Man with the Bone:  At the bottom of a tunnel dug in pirate country, a man dies, but dies with a 300 year old finger clutched in his hand.  Had they actually found something, or was he murdered for another reason?The Man in the Morgue:  And quite possibly my least favorite of the series, for reasons I can't even quite figure out, this episode has Bones in New Orleans.  She is helping identify remains after Katrina when she wakes up in a pool of blood and has no recollection of what has happened.  But when a doctor she is working with turns up murdered, she is the main suspect.The Graft in the Girl:  The FBI main guy's daughter is in the hospital with a rare cancer.  Investigation proves it came from a bone graft, which was illegally harvested from a sick man.  Bones and Brennan have to find out what happened as it could effect quite a few more people who may have gotten transplants.The Soldier on the Grave:  A murdered soldier in Arlington cemetery has the team scrambling to find out what happened.  It also raises questions to what happened overseas when another soldier died.The Woman in Limbo:  When helping to identify remains, the skeleton of Bone's mother is identified.  This leads her to make contact with her mother and come to terms on the abandonment as a child but raises more questions than it answers.All of the episodes are pretty exciting and interesting in this series.  Sure there were some I didn't care for, but the majority kept me hooked.  And the last episode had a good tie in to make you want to watch the second season.  But because this is a forensic show, there's a lot of nasty scenes.  Some of its gory, some of its gruesome, and some of its bloody, icky, sticky, etc.  This is not a show for those people with weak stomachs.Casting was extremely well done.  I can't say there isn't any character that I don't like in this show.  I especially like Emily Deschanel as Bones.  She plays her role well and I actually identify with her a little bit when it comes to social awkwardness, although I am nowhere near a genius like her character.  David Borneaz as Booth, well he's eye candy, but he also plays the sensitive tough guy role extremely well.  He's actually the heart of the show I think and I couldn't imagine watching it without either one of them.  The side characters are all great too and I would be hard pressed to watch the show without Angela or Hodgins.  Zack is interesting, although cringe worthy in his behaviors at times.They filmed this show pretty well.  Camera shots are good and while you know you're not actually there, it doesn't always feel like you're watching tv.  Of course that could just be because of the humor thrown in making everyone seem like real people.  I do have to say that whoever they hired to put music to the episodes is doing a great job.  I love all the music and have actually downloaded several songs as a result of watching an episode.  It may actually be why I like the one episode ""The Skull in the Desert"" so much.  I am completely enamoured with the end song.A great show, but definitely one that should be watched in order.  Maybe after you get to know the characters its ok to get out of sequence, but its really hard to develop that connection if you just jump around episodes starting out.  I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes crime or medical dramas with just a small twist of humor.Review by M.

The characters are lively and outrageous, and when put together create some very interesting moments. The only thing I'd criticize are the inconsistencies.

643706,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00005JOXC,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[3, 4]","I've loved David Boreanaz ever since..well, you know when!He's back to a supporting role in this series as Special Agent Seely Booth--a former army sniper now working for the FBI. A single parent to young Parker, Booth is very much a human in this role and does show a comedic light-hearted wit, but Boreanaz again gets to play somebody who must atone for killing others in his past (the whole sniper former-career).This time, the supernatural and odd stuff gets handled by his partner, Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) a character who is closely based on real life series creator Kathy Reich's experiences solving cases as a forensic anthropologist. Yes, Brennnan is good looking and she and Boreanaz make a good couple together, but her character's obvious lack of people skills is a recurrent story arc and it speaks of Reich's own talent if the character who is supposed to be based on her own experiences constantly gets tagged with such an obviously unflattering trait. Somebody else with a monster ego would have instead gone around wanting it to be 'her show'and that particular character to be especially perfect.Twenty-two episodes are included in this 2005-2006 first season. My favorite one has to be ""The solider in the grave"" just because it could be ripped from current headlines about the war in Iraq. I'm also partial to ""Superhero in the alley"" because despite having a crowd of friends at my high school, we were the unpopular bunch who did not fit in with the status quo. Imagining thisThe ""Man in the Morgue"" is another episode which effectively touches upon current/real life events. The whole 'vodoo in New Orleans' link could seem a little contrived to some people, but having TV characters go down to an area which is still very much in the news to investigate always has been a favorite plot device of mine.Yes, I admit, I like to watch 'action/adventure/drama' shows. However, this one is so much more addictive since it intentionally injects a little bit of humor into it's periodically 'gross' storylines. I even detected a little bit of the formula from season one of 'Lois and Clark' (where two people who were not sure if they liked each other had to work together). Boreanaz can do romantic comedy!The only thing which really annoys me about 'Bones' is that the characters constantly mention they work at the 'Jeffersonian' when no such building exists for the FBI.  If the series has permission to use exterior shots of the building and it's actually named after J. Edgar Hoover, just be honest and admit that it was named after him. Its not like Hollywood would be promoting the guy through the correct building name dropping.Specific to the DVD's though, I wish that I had read the 'song replacement' comments before getting a hold of this set because the music was altered. DVD sets tend to be expensive enough as it is already despite this technology having been out on the market for a long time now. Yes, I know companies and artists are trying to make as much money as they possibly can, but a DVD set with unaltered vs. altered music is like the differences between cheddar cheese and imitation cheese product--which would they honestly want to buy let alone eat?Finally, there are featurettes, commentaries from Boreanaz and Deschanel, and character profiles. But, why oh, why are companies continuing to do double sided discs--the people who purchase season sets are the hard-core fans who play episodes over and over again. Even the most careful handling of a two sided disc wears out quicker than if it were only one-sided.",3,"No 'Bones' about it, this is a good show but DVD production quality needs work",1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,3573,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'ever', 'since..well', 'know', 'when', 'back', 'supporting', 'role', 'series', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Seely', 'Booth', 'former', 'army', 'sniper', 'now', 'working', 'FBI', 'single', 'parent', 'young', 'Parker', 'Booth', 'very', 'much', 'human', 'role', 'show', 'comedic', 'light-hearted', 'wit', 'Boreanaz', 'again', 'play', 'somebody', 'who', 'must', 'atone', 'killing', 'others', 'past', 'whole', 'sniper', 'former-career', '.This', 'time', 'supernatural', 'odd', 'stuff', 'handled', 'partner', 'Temperance', 'Brennan', 'Emily', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'who', 'closely', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'series', 'creator', 'Kathy', 'Reich', 'experiences', 'solving', 'cases', 'forensic', 'anthropologist', 'Yes', 'Brennnan', 'good', 'looking', 'Boreanaz', 'make', 'good', 'couple', 'together', 'character', 'obvious', 'lack', 'people', 'skills', 'recurrent', 'story', 'arc', 'Reich', 'own', 'talent', 'character', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'own', 'experiences', 'constantly', 'tagged', 'such', 'obviously', 'unflattering', 'trait', 'Somebody', 'else', 'monster', 'ego', 'would', 'have', 'instead', 'gone', 'wanting', 'be', ""'her"", ""show'and"", 'particular', 'character', 'be', 'especially', 'perfect.Twenty-two', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', '2005-2006', 'first', 'season', 'favorite', 'one', 'be', 'solider', 'grave', 'just', 'could', 'be', 'ripped', 'current', 'headlines', 'war', 'Iraq', ""'m"", 'also', 'partial', 'Superhero', 'alley', 'having', 'crowd', 'friends', 'high', 'school', 'were', 'unpopular', 'bunch', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'status', 'quo', 'Imagining', 'thisThe', 'Man', 'Morgue', 'episode', 'effectively', 'current/real', 'life', 'events', 'whole', ""'vodoo"", 'New', 'Orleans', 'link', 'could', 'seem', 'little', 'contrived', 'people', 'having', 'TV', 'characters', 'go', 'down', 'area', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'news', 'investigate', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'plot', 'device', 'mine.Yes', 'admit', 'like', 'watch', ""'action/adventure/drama"", 'shows', 'However', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'addictive', 'intentionally', 'little', 'bit', 'humor', 'periodically', ""'gross"", 'storylines', 'even', 'detected', 'little', 'bit', 'formula', 'season', 'one', ""'Lois"", 'Clark', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'sure', 'liked', 'other', 'had', 'work', 'together', 'Boreanaz', 'can', 'do', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'only', 'thing', 'really', ""'Bones"", 'characters', 'constantly', 'mention', 'work', ""'Jeffersonian"", 'when', 'such', 'building', 'exists', 'FBI', 'series', 'permission', 'use', 'exterior', 'shots', 'building', 'actually', 'named', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'just', 'be', 'honest', 'admit', 'was', 'named', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'be', 'promoting', 'guy', 'correct', 'building', 'name', 'dropping.Specific', 'DVD', 'wish', 'had', 'read', ""'song"", 'replacement', 'comments', 'getting', 'hold', 'set', 'music', 'was', 'altered', 'DVD', 'tend', 'be', 'expensive', 'enough', 'already', 'technology', 'having', 'been', 'out', 'market', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'Yes', 'know', 'companies', 'artists', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'much', 'money', 'possibly', 'can', 'DVD', 'set', 'unaltered', 'vs.', 'altered', 'music', 'differences', 'cheddar', 'cheese', 'imitation', 'cheese', 'product', 'would', 'honestly', 'want', 'buy', 'let', 'alone', 'eat', 'Finally', 'are', 'featurettes', 'commentaries', 'Boreanaz', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'profiles', 'why', 'oh', 'why', 'are', 'companies', 'continuing', 'do', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'people', 'who', 'purchase', 'season', 'sets', 'are', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'who', 'play', 'episodes', 'over', 'again', 'Even', 'most', 'careful', 'handling', 'two', 'sided', 'disc', 'wears', 'out', 'quicker', 'were', 'only', 'one-sided']",Bones

I think David Boreanaz is hot, and I never got to watch him in Buffy, because I don't like that genre2.  I am not a fan of CSI-type shows.  But I did watch CSI first season and thought it was excellent.3.  I have watched 6 episodes so far hoping for a turnaround, but think I will just abandon.Some people have called Bones a sexed-up CSI.  I think a better description is a dumbed-down CSI.  I do not understand the almost 5-star rating for this show.  Here are the problems I see:1.  Bad acting by Boreanaz.  I hope he was much better in Buffy.2.  Cardboard characters such as Zach.3.  Bad writing. You want to shoot the writers with some of those lines.4.  Predictable endings.  You can guess who is the murderer 90% of the time.5.  Repetitive plot cues.  Dr. Brennan always figures out a case by a ""eureka"" moment, after someone says something not related to the case.6.  Oversimplification of characters:  Dr. Brennan is so asocial she doesn't even get pop cultural references thrown at her by Booth.7.  Everyone talks about sexual chemistry between the 2.  Please....8.  When they are driving in the car, the outside looks fake.  In ""The Man in the Bear"" episode...the mountains looked pasted in the town's background.  All the corpses look fake too.Well, I could go on and on.  I really want to stop watching and then because of the rave reviews, I hesitate. I wonder if the show gets better.  Alias' first 5 episodes are horrible, and then it becomes really good.The problem is that not once, have I felt the urgency to stay up and watch the next show.  This urgency is a sure indicator of how good a tv series is.  The advantage of buying a DVD set is that you don't have to wait one whole week to catch the next episode.  Perhaps in this show's case....waiting a whole week might actually be a good thing.
