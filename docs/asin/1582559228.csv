That's all well and good, and while the information contained in the film is educational and quite interesting, the aesthetic and formatting components are completely distracting.  It all looks incredibly dated, like something that might have been produced in the 1980s.The information is quite valuable, and I do feel like I learned quite a bit from the instructional point of view (importance of a strong core, proper technique, etc.), however I could not justify paying upwards of $27 when the material is presented in so cheap a fashion.",3,Not what you might be expecting,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",2012,653,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'DVD', 'not', 'core', 'workout', 'rather', 'instructional', 'video', 'trainers', 'well', 'good', 'information', 'contained', 'film', 'educational', 'quite', 'interesting', 'aesthetic', 'formatting', 'components', 'are', 'completely', 'distracting', 'incredibly', 'dated', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'produced', '1980s.The', 'information', 'quite', 'valuable', 'do', 'feel', 'learned', 'quite', 'bit', 'instructional', 'point', 'view', 'importance', 'strong', 'core', 'proper', 'technique', 'etc', 'however', 'could', 'not', 'justify', 'paying', 'upwards', '27', 'when', 'material', 'presented', 'so', 'cheap', 'fashion']",N/A
192627,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,1582559228,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[6, 6]","I was expecting the CORE STABILITY TRAINING DVD to be along the lines of aP90X: Tony Horton's 90-Day Extreme Home Fitness Workout DVD ProgramorPOWER 90: Tony Horton's Total Body Transformation 90 Day Boot Camp Workout DVDs, both of which I enjoy, but it seems to be more of an instructional video for those who are already working with a physical therapist. However, you can do the exercises yourself but don't expect motivation or reasoning as to why you're doing the specific movement other than to strengthen your core.BTW, your core is your midsection, basically your waist, that includes your abs, lower back and spine. Strengthening this area is important for good posture and to keep injuries to a minimum when partaking in sports or other physical activities.The emphasis is on quality and not quantity, as Dr. Liebenson explains in the introduction, and the video shows you the correct and incorrect way to do the exercises. Running time on the DVD is about 34:25-minutes.You'll need some additional equipment if you plan on doing the entire routine:* Small Medicine Ball (maybe a small weight would work).* Large Exercise Ball.* Leg Band (Looks like a large rubber band that goes around your thighs like this oneCando Band Exercise Loop - 15"" Long - Green - Medium).* Balance Sport Trainer (like this oneBosu Sport 55 cm Balance Trainer).* Some Foam Padding (and a stick for balance).I don't have any of these things except for the large exercise ball, but I think you can do the exercises without the medicine ball just use a small light weight, but you'll need the leg band, large exercise ball, and the balance trainer for other exercises because the movement is dependent on those items.Objects magically appear between exercises, like the foam padding that you lie on that's on top of the yoga mat, without any explanation as to why they are there and what they're called. Maybe they're optional?Here are some heads-up about the DVD:* Issues playing on my computer, but it works fine on regular DVD player.* No interaction with the viewer. At times you feel like a voyeur just watching someone doing their physical therapy. It isn't like the P90X DVDs where the instructor, Tony Horton, is doing the exercises with you, while explaining the movements and what they're for.* Not very exciting or motivational.* You can select specific exercises and the DVD will play from there or just start at the beginning and it will automatically continue on from that point.Anyway, I think the DVD is good to help someone who experiences problems following other exercise DVDs because of limited mobility or injury or weak core. The exercises are relatively simple and non-impact, with the focus being on form, so even people who haven't worked out in a long time (or ever) should be able to complete each move. Of course, as with any instructional workout DVD, you should consult your doctor as to whether or not this would be good for you -- especially if you've had a previous injury to your back or spine or are extremely out of shape.If you're looking for a video that shows you the wrong and right way to workout, i.e. using gym equipment, this DVD does provide some instructions on working out at a gym and shows you the improper form to avoid. It goes through some of the more common exercise equipment like the rowing machine or the lat pull down bar, but this section is very short. I would've liked to have more on this topic, especially with a focus on free weights and doing common movements like bicep curls and lunges, and I thought that's what the entire DVD was about, but it isn't.The price is way too high for something that isn't very motivating and is very short. Plus you'll need to buy additional equipment, so it's averages three stars.",3,You'll Need *Equipment* And This Isn't A Commercial Type Workout DVD!,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,3763,"['was', 'expecting', 'CORE', 'STABILITY', 'TRAINING', 'DVD', 'be', 'lines', 'aP90X', 'Tony', 'Horton', '90-Day', 'Extreme', 'Home', 'Fitness', 'Workout', 'DVD', 'ProgramorPOWER', '90', 'Tony', 'Horton', 'Total', 'Body', 'Transformation', '90', 'Day', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'Workout', 'DVDs', 'enjoy', 'be', 'more', 'instructional', 'video', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'working', 'physical', 'therapist', 'However', 'can', 'do', 'exercises', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'motivation', 'reasoning', 'why', ""'re"", 'doing', 'specific', 'movement', 'other', 'strengthen', 'core.BTW', 'core', 'midsection', 'basically', 'waist', 'abs', 'lower', 'back', 'spine', 'Strengthening', 'area', 'important', 'good', 'posture', 'keep', 'injuries', 'minimum', 'when', 'partaking', 'sports', 'other', 'physical', 'activities.The', 'emphasis', 'quality', 'not', 'quantity', 'Dr.', 'Liebenson', 'introduction', 'video', 'correct', 'incorrect', 'way', 'do', 'exercises', 'Running', 'time', 'DVD', '34:25-minutes.You', ""'ll"", 'need', 'additional', 'equipment', 'plan', 'doing', 'entire', 'routine', '*', 'Small', 'Medicine', 'Ball', 'maybe', 'small', 'weight', 'would', 'work', '*', 'Large', 'Exercise', 'Ball', '*', 'Leg', 'Band', 'Looks', 'large', 'rubber', 'band', 'thighs', 'oneCando', 'Band', 'Exercise', 'Loop', '15', 'Long', 'Green', 'Medium', '*', 'Balance', 'Sport', 'Trainer', 'oneBosu', 'Sport', '55', 'cm', 'Balance', 'Trainer', 'Foam', 'Padding', 'stick', 'balance', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'things', 'large', 'exercise', 'ball', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'exercises', 'medicine', 'ball', 'just', 'use', 'small', 'light', 'weight', ""'ll"", 'need', 'leg', 'band', 'large', 'exercise', 'ball', 'balance', 'trainer', 'other', 'exercises', 'movement', 'dependent', 'items.Objects', 'magically', 'appear', 'exercises', 'foam', 'padding', 'lie', 'top', 'yoga', 'mat', 'explanation', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'what', ""'re"", 'called', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'optional', 'Here', 'are', 'heads-up', 'DVD', '*', 'Issues', 'playing', 'computer', 'fine', 'regular', 'DVD', 'player', 'interaction', 'viewer', 'times', 'feel', 'voyeur', 'just', 'watching', 'someone', 'doing', 'physical', 'therapy', ""n't"", 'P90X', 'DVDs', 'where', 'instructor', 'Tony', 'Horton', 'doing', 'exercises', 'explaining', 'movements', 'what', ""'re"", '*', 'Not', 'very', 'exciting', 'motivational', 'can', 'select', 'specific', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'will', 'play', 'there', 'just', 'start', 'beginning', 'will', 'automatically', 'continue', 'point.Anyway', 'think', 'DVD', 'good', 'help', 'someone', 'who', 'problems', 'following', 'other', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'limited', 'mobility', 'injury', 'weak', 'core', 'exercises', 'are', 'relatively', 'simple', 'non-impact', 'focus', 'being', 'form', 'so', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'out', 'long', 'time', 'ever', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'complete', 'move', 'course', 'instructional', 'workout', 'DVD', 'should', 'consult', 'doctor', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'had', 'previous', 'injury', 'back', 'spine', 'are', 'extremely', 'shape.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'video', 'wrong', 'right', 'way', 'workout', 'i.e', 'using', 'gym', 'equipment', 'DVD', 'provide', 'instructions', 'working', 'out', 'gym', 'improper', 'form', 'avoid', 'more', 'common', 'exercise', 'equipment', 'rowing', 'machine', 'lat', 'pull', 'down', 'bar', 'section', 'very', 'short', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'more', 'topic', 'especially', 'focus', 'free', 'weights', 'doing', 'common', 'movements', 'bicep', 'curls', 'lunges', 'thought', 'what', 'entire', 'DVD', 'was', 'about', ""isn't.The"", 'price', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'something', ""n't"", 'very', 'motivating', 'very', 'short', ""'ll"", 'need', 'buy', 'additional', 'equipment', 'averages', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

However, there is some very valuable stuff on this DVD, so I intend to use it as a reference.It is great fun to work out with a video; however, I love even more to draw ideas from various sources and piece together my own routines. There's a lot to be said for having things quiet so one can listen to one's body and really focus on form, body sensations of fatigue, energy, etc. (-sometimes joy and wellbeing - to good to miss!) It is particularly enjoyable to  draw from all different sources  on those days when the body feels like a concrete slab and just does not want to move...a little variety can be refreshing and inspiring.Anyway, what I did was to insert a few exercises from the DVD at a time into my exercise sessions over two or three days until I completed the DVD. The next couple of days, I exercised along with the whole DVD, pausing it often in order to work both sides of my body and, of course,  to have enough time to get up and down, get the equipment together, and be sure I really understood the instructions.I was surprised to find that in spite of my bumbling around, when it was all over, my sometimes recalcitrant body felt like a million (perhaps a trillion) dollars...refreshed, balanced, warmed up, singing inside. For me, that is a real selling point.So there is definitely much to be said for the DVD... lots of great stuff there. I don't see as much resemblance to yoga and tai chi as to mat Pilates, though, and I will definitely adapt some of the exercises just a little to make them more flowing and to incorporate some relaxation to balance all that bracing.Definitely recommended as a reference.",4,Good healthy information to draw from,1331856000,"03 16, 2012",2012,1734,"['indeed', 'unfortunate', 'DVD', 'not', 'really', 'something', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'exercise', 'along', 'However', 'very', 'valuable', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'intend', 'use', 'reference.It', 'great', 'fun', 'work', 'out', 'video', 'however', 'love', 'even', 'more', 'draw', 'ideas', 'various', 'sources', 'piece', 'together', 'own', 'routines', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'having', 'things', 'quiet', 'one', 'can', 'listen', 'one', 'body', 'really', 'focus', 'form', 'body', 'sensations', 'fatigue', 'energy', 'etc', '-sometimes', 'joy', 'wellbeing', 'good', 'miss', 'particularly', 'enjoyable', 'draw', 'different', 'sources', 'days', 'when', 'body', 'feels', 'concrete', 'slab', 'just', 'not', 'want', 'move', 'little', 'variety', 'can', 'be', 'refreshing', 'inspiring.Anyway', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'insert', 'few', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'time', 'exercise', 'sessions', 'two', 'three', 'days', 'completed', 'DVD', 'next', 'couple', 'days', 'exercised', 'along', 'whole', 'DVD', 'pausing', 'often', 'order', 'work', 'sides', 'body', 'course', 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'up', 'down', 'get', 'equipment', 'together', 'be', 'sure', 'really', 'understood', 'instructions.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'spite', 'bumbling', 'around', 'when', 'was', 'sometimes', 'recalcitrant', 'body', 'felt', 'million', 'perhaps', 'trillion', 'dollars', 'refreshed', 'balanced', 'warmed', 'up', 'singing', 'inside', 'real', 'selling', 'point.So', 'definitely', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'DVD', 'lots', 'great', 'stuff', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'much', 'resemblance', 'yoga', 'tai', 'chi', 'mat', 'Pilates', 'though', 'will', 'definitely', 'adapt', 'exercises', 'just', 'little', 'make', 'more', 'flowing', 'incorporate', 'relaxation', 'balance', 'bracing.Definitely', 'recommended', 'reference']",N/A

This DVD does not present a fast track for impressing other people.  And it is not meant to entertain.  It is a scientific approach to safely maximize your bodies fitness to function best in the real world for a full lifetime.  It also can be profitably used to safely recover from sports injuries.I would say that I wish I had this DVD when I was young, but the truth is that in those days I would not have appreciated this approach at all.  In fact, it is only now that I'm in my seventies that I have the wisdom to fully appreciate what this type of training has to offer.  (That's why I gave this review that title.)My goal now is to remain fully active and reduce the pains of aging for as long as possible.  As far as longevity: proper diet, exercise, and rest offers greater potential - but no guarantees.  I don't worry about that.  I expect to die only once.This exercise program will probably seem boring to most young people.  Be advised however, it is not always necessary to grow old to acquire wisdom.

In this DVD we are just watching the explanation and demonstration, which is terribly boring unless you are highly motivated for one of the reasons I mentioned above. Otherwise, all you have here is the tedious positioning and alignment for exercises you aren't doing and don't really know why you should.Then again, I know dozens of people who have injured themselves exercising with poor technique, overuse, burning out knees, etc. If this DVD actually gave the viewer an exercise session, maybe with Dr. Liebenson pointing out corrections and improvements in the quality of movements, it might have wider appeal.",3,A Good Resource For Anyone Interested in Core Stability Training,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,1251,"['think', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'excellent', 'resource', 'anyone', 'motivated', 'pain', 'resulting', 'injuries', 'also', 'may', 'be', 'excellent', 'training', 'professionals', 'interested', 'working', 'patients', 'increase', 'core', 'stability.The', 'exercises', 'are', 'done', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'methodically', 'lots', 'attention', 'detail.I', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Pilates', 'years', 'past', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'training', 'materials', 'meant', 'Pilates', 'instructors', 'working', 'core', 'stability', 'etc', 'training', 'materials', 'were', 'little', 'easier', 'work', 'was', 'doing', 'exercises', 'instructor', 'pointed', 'out', 'reasons', 'one', 'cautions', 'well', 'DVD', 'are', 'just', 'watching', 'explanation', 'demonstration', 'terribly', 'boring', 'are', 'highly', 'motivated', 'one', 'reasons', 'mentioned', 'above', 'Otherwise', 'all', 'have', 'here', 'tedious', 'positioning', 'alignment', 'exercises', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'should.Then', 'again', 'know', 'dozens', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'injured', 'exercising', 'poor', 'technique', 'overuse', 'burning', 'out', 'knees', 'etc', 'DVD', 'actually', 'gave', 'viewer', 'exercise', 'session', 'maybe', 'Dr.', 'Liebenson', 'pointing', 'out', 'corrections', 'improvements', 'quality', 'movements', 'might', 'have', 'wider', 'appeal']",N/A
192631,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,1582559228,buru buru piggu,"[1, 1]","This video is not what you might expect. The textbook-y cover art is perhaps the first clue. It's very different from all the mass market workout DVDs sold which usually feature impossibly fit women with toned abs and skimpy workout attire. Those videos are designed to let you exercise along to them, featuring trainers that shout out encouragements and good music to workout to. This DVD is not like that. It's basically a textbook on video and is perhaps best aimed at healthcare practitioners.The information is very educational and extensive, but it lacks pizzazz. Narrated by Craig Liebenson, a doctor of chiropractic, the presentation is very straight-forward and lecture-like... maybe something out of a sports medicine or physiotherapy course. While affable and easy to understand, he tends to be pretty dry and no-nonsense. Don't expect any jokes, banter, or asides. It's all business here. The shots are all of a model/actress doing the exercises. Sometimes he's in the shot directing her movements and sometimes it's just the actor.Production quality-wise, the DVD menu is very poorly organized. The menus aren't animated and just look like a giant numbered list. There are 7 pages of chapter listings and no pictures or thumbnail videos to let you quickly find the appropriate chapter at a glance. The entire DVD is about 35 minutes, with over 100 exercises, broken down into 16 major exercise groups. Many of the title cards cards separating chapters just look like fancied up Powerpoint slides. You definitely will not be able to exercise to this video. You have to watch the chapter, remember the exercise, then perform them on your own. It would be helpful to offer a booklet of all the different exercises. There's no insert. My balance ball came with one. This DVD should too.There's a very good intro in which he talks about how we tend to exercise for looks instead of for health (developing superficial muscles instead of core strength, emphasizing quantity of movement over quality), but no closing remarks or words of encouragement/optimism or even credits after the last exercise. It just cuts and goes back to the main menu. The DVD is 1.33 aspect ratio. The DVD length and format is not even listed on the back cover.Overall, a cut and dry informational DVD.

I found the pace to be uneven and the video to be essentially useless as a workout video. The value I did find was in its focus on proper form in every exercise.I went back to my standard core workouts with something of a new appreciation for maintaining form. I ended up watching portions of the Core Stability Training video once or twice more to refresh a couple of points, but as of this point in time I haven't touched it in weeks and don't really plan on it.If you are an instructor, physical therapist or other person working with people recovering from injury or illness, this might be a good product for you.

This is really ideal for a physical therapist or professional personal trainer.  At the same token, serious fitness enthusiasts can learn a lot from this video.  It is not meant for casual exercise enthusiasts, and it is not meant to be used as an exercise program.  The concepts and exercises that are covered here are meant to be integrated into a full physical therapy or exercise program by a knowledgeable person.While in some ways this is a basic program, there is a lot of information on proper form that seems to be glossed over quite quickly.  That is my main criticism.  The information is organized, but it could be better structured.  And there could have definitely been improvements both in the presentation and emphasis around key points about good form, which is a central concept in avoiding injury.  Dr. Liebenson is clearly knowledgeable and experienced, but as a result may lack some of the showmanship necessary to emphasize key points.Production value is indeed quite low on this DVD.  However, that is of secondary importance to a physical therapy or exercise science professional.  While there are areas for improvement of that aspect, it does not detract from the good content that is included here.  The videos may not be particularly well recorded for today's HD world, but they do provide enough visual information to allow the viewer to learn the proper way to do these exercises.The core exercises are covered in order of difficulty.  That provides the option to work through them as a comprehensive program.  Alternatively, you can choose exercises specific for your program or ailment.  As with any exercise regimen, those who are using this DVD for self-study will usually want to consult a professional about the exercises they are adding to their routine.CONCLUSIONThis is a very informative video that will be useful for the proper audience.

This is an instructional video, not a video that's intended to guide your workout.  There are several exercises and you see three or four reps of each one, then an example of poor form mistakes you might make.  I think the purpose is to watch the video, write down the exercises you want to do, then try them on your own.These are core stability exercises, obviously, drawn primarily from Yoga and Pilates.  Some of these exercises are new to me, so they might be creations of the person who developed the video.  (Or maybe I need to take more classes.)  They assume that you'll have some equipment on hand.  So far I've seen them use a mat,bands, an exercise ball,half and full foam rollers, hand weights (weight unspecified,) a stick (a broomstick would work, I think,) aBosu(one of my favorite balance devices,) and a variety ofmedicine balls.  There may have been other items I forgot about.  I wouldn't buy any of these items before watching the video.  Some of them, like the stick and Bosu, are only used with a partner, and many of them are only used for a couple of exercises.  It may be possible to substitute items around the house for some of this equipment.As others have mentioned, production values are not great.  The video looks like it was shot in a physical therapy office, the music is bland and repetitive, each exercise is one chapter with several seconds of the same graphic to remind you what the name of the exercise is, and it's a little strange to watch the instructor repeatedly poking at the abs of the person demonstrating the exercise, to illustrate tight, engaged core muscles.  The menus are difficult to navigate, at least on my DVD player and my computer, and finding one specific exercise is frustrating and time consuming.  But these are excellent core exercises, explained well, with very good examples of good and bad form.  The introduction explains why good form is necessary.

Don't get me wrong, there is some valuable information here. It is just more like watching Dr. Liebenson coach someone rather than addressing the camera.  You almost felt like you are spying on someone's personal training session.  There were times when I felt like ""Hey, what about me at home?"".The number of exercises he covers is too long to list here (approx. 58) , but I will list the general categories:1. Health Club Tips2. Exercise Basics3. The ABC's of Long Term Athletic Development4. Functional Test5. The Abdominal Brace6. All 4's-Quadruped7. The Side Bridge8. The Dying Bug9. McGill's Abdominal Curl Up10. The Superman11. Hamstring Curls12. Bridges13. The Single Leg Roll Back14. Shoulder/Upper Back Training15. Resisted Core Training16. Functional Core RoutineIn order to do this video you will need additional equipment such as a Bosu, stability ball, foam roller, weights, weighted ball, or partner to provide resistance.  Although the DVD is lengthy, the exercises themselves go very quickly.  I can't see doing this at home as a sequenced work out.  However, I can see trying out some of the exercises at home and then incorporating them little by little into my routine at the gym.Dr. Liebenson does give some good tips here for common mistakes that can hurt you at the gym.  I liked his description of the core as a circular band of support around the back, stomach, and sides which is good way to visualize it when doing any core exercises.  I noticed I even started visualizing this when I was out walking.  He also gives good step by step instruction on proper form for pushups to avoid injury.He refers to Yoga and Pilates exercises such as cat cow, side plank, bridge, and dead bug.  However, he referred to Dead Bug pose several times.  This was a loose variation at best and may be annoying to a Yoga Practitioner.Pro: there is some good information here that can be incorporated into a workout routine.Con: the presentation style which is dated, lengthy, dry, and boring, and geared more for technical instruction to physical therapy or physical trainer students.  The music is also dated.Ultimately, this is more a technical manual than a workout routine.  It would be a good DVD if you are looking to sharpen your skills and form at the gym.  It would be a terrible DVD if you are looking for a sequenced workout to do at home.",3,Highly Technical and Dry,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,2528,"['DVD', 'bit', 'misleading', 'sense', 'geared', 'towards', 'Physical', 'Therapist', 'Personal', 'Trainers', 'rather', 'sequenced', 'work', 'out', 'general', 'population', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'valuable', 'information', 'here', 'just', 'more', 'like', 'watching', 'Dr.', 'Liebenson', 'coach', 'someone', 'rather', 'addressing', 'camera', 'almost', 'felt', 'are', 'spying', 'someone', 'personal', 'training', 'session', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'Hey', 'what', 'home', '.The', 'number', 'exercises', 'too', 'long', 'list', 'here', 'approx', '58', 'will', 'list', 'general', 'categories:1', 'Health', 'Club', 'Tips2', 'Exercise', 'Basics3', 'ABC', 'Long', 'Term', 'Athletic', 'Development4', 'Functional', 'Test5', 'Abdominal', 'Brace6', ""4's-Quadruped7"", 'Side', 'Bridge8', 'Dying', 'Bug9', 'McGill', 'Abdominal', 'Curl', 'Up10', 'Superman11', 'Hamstring', 'Curls12', 'Bridges13', 'Single', 'Leg', 'Roll', 'Back14', 'Shoulder/Upper', 'Back', 'Training15', 'Resisted', 'Core', 'Training16', 'Functional', 'Core', 'RoutineIn', 'order', 'do', 'video', 'will', 'need', 'additional', 'equipment', 'such', 'Bosu', 'stability', 'ball', 'foam', 'roller', 'weights', 'weighted', 'ball', 'partner', 'provide', 'resistance', 'DVD', 'lengthy', 'exercises', 'go', 'very', 'quickly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'doing', 'home', 'sequenced', 'work', 'out', 'However', 'can', 'see', 'trying', 'out', 'exercises', 'home', 'then', 'incorporating', 'little', 'little', 'routine', 'gym.Dr', 'Liebenson', 'give', 'good', 'tips', 'here', 'common', 'mistakes', 'can', 'hurt', 'gym', 'liked', 'description', 'core', 'circular', 'band', 'support', 'back', 'stomach', 'sides', 'good', 'way', 'visualize', 'when', 'doing', 'core', 'exercises', 'noticed', 'even', 'started', 'visualizing', 'when', 'was', 'out', 'walking', 'also', 'good', 'step', 'step', 'instruction', 'proper', 'form', 'pushups', 'avoid', 'injury.He', 'refers', 'Yoga', 'Pilates', 'exercises', 'such', 'cat', 'cow', 'side', 'plank', 'bridge', 'dead', 'bug', 'However', 'referred', 'Dead', 'Bug', 'pose', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'loose', 'variation', 'best', 'may', 'be', 'annoying', 'Yoga', 'Practitioner.Pro', 'good', 'information', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'incorporated', 'workout', 'routine.Con', 'presentation', 'style', 'dated', 'lengthy', 'dry', 'boring', 'geared', 'more', 'technical', 'instruction', 'physical', 'therapy', 'physical', 'trainer', 'students', 'music', 'also', 'dated.Ultimately', 'more', 'technical', 'manual', 'workout', 'routine', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'DVD', 'are', 'looking', 'sharpen', 'skills', 'form', 'gym', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'DVD', 'are', 'looking', 'sequenced', 'workout', 'do', 'home']",N/A

It isn't really a training class you do on the mats and equipment, but instead watch on the couch, and then make sure you incorporate the right way of working out, which is what the video shows you how to do.I don't have some of the equipment you need like the Bosu ball, the leg band, or a medicine ball.I found the information was worthwhile learning and would recommend it to anyone looking for instruction on how to do proper exercises to strengthen your core.
