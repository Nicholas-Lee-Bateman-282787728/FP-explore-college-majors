And we did. The television stayed on from that Friday November 22 until after the funeral on Monday the 25th.Since that day I have watched several networks offerings and in my opinion, nothing still beats Cronkite,This is the best. If you remember that terrible day or are looking for the best network coverage, you will experience not only the assassination of a beloved President, nor television news coverage in its infancy  but true news journalism, a lost art in today's digital news idiocy.",5,Definitive 11-22-63 chronology,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,720,"['Short', 'sweet', 'are', 'looking', 'best', '34', 'happened', '34', 'network', 'coverage', 'it.I', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'awful', 'day', 'remember', 'dad', 'saying', 'were', 'going', 'watch', 'CBS', 'Cronkite', 'period', 'did', 'television', 'stayed', 'Friday', 'November', '22', 'funeral', 'Monday', '25th.Since', 'day', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'networks', 'offerings', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'still', 'Cronkite', 'best', 'remember', 'terrible', 'day', 'are', 'looking', 'best', 'network', 'coverage', 'will', 'experience', 'not', 'only', 'assassination', 'beloved', 'President', 'television', 'news', 'coverage', 'infancy', 'true', 'news', 'journalism', 'lost', 'art', 'today', 'digital', 'news', 'idiocy']",As It Happened: JFK Assassination
1677257,AAQMDSR9B2EDR,B00G6SGV3A,Midwest Reviewer,"[2, 3]","This DVD was advertised at the end of the November 2013 CBS TV broadcast of a program with the same name, which would indicate it is a copy of the program just viewed, if not an expanded version of it. It's not.It does have a longer running time than the TV show did, but it's a modern editor's condensed version of what he or she felt was important. There is 1963 CBS TV footage here that I've not seen elsewhere which I found interesting, but it seems like the progression of events is choppy here with some well-known events and footage missing.  The bonus program of the 1964 CBS TV Warren Commission results is of little interest.This DVD has an unbelievable current price of 35.99 but was discounted to 19.98 here on amazon when I bought it, which is still way too much for the content provided.  Pick up another DVD such as the remastered/restored version of ""Years Of Lightning, Day of Drums"", ""JFK 3 Shots That Changed America"", or find the documentary ""Four Days In November"" on Youtube (or hopefully as a future DVD release), rather than this DVD.",3,Not the same program broadcast on CBS TV in November 2013,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1058,"['DVD', 'was', 'advertised', 'end', 'November', '2013', 'CBS', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'program', 'same', 'name', 'would', 'indicate', 'copy', 'program', 'just', 'viewed', 'not', 'expanded', 'version', 'not.It', 'have', 'longer', 'running', 'time', 'TV', 'show', 'did', 'modern', 'editor', 'condensed', 'version', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'important', '1963', 'CBS', 'TV', 'footage', 'here', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'found', 'interesting', 'progression', 'events', 'choppy', 'here', 'well-known', 'events', 'footage', 'missing', 'bonus', 'program', '1964', 'CBS', 'TV', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'results', 'little', 'interest.This', 'DVD', 'unbelievable', 'current', 'price', '35.99', 'was', 'discounted', '19.98', 'here', 'amazon', 'when', 'bought', 'still', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'content', 'provided', 'Pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'such', 'remastered/restored', 'version', 'Years', 'Lightning', 'Day', 'Drums', 'JFK', '3', 'Shots', 'That', 'Changed', 'America', 'find', 'documentary', 'Four', 'Days', 'November', 'Youtube', 'hopefully', 'future', 'DVD', 'release', 'rather', 'DVD']",As It Happened: JFK Assassination
1677258,A2AFAKER0RLLOG,B00G6SGV3A,"R. Martin ""RedsFan4Life""","[9, 10]","I was disappointed with this DVD and it really missed its mark.  It jumped around through the four days and left our parts of the coverage.  To be quite honest, the CBS program many years ago called &#34;Four Days in November&#34; was much better.  As I recall about an hour and one half of this DVD actually covers assassination to funeral and then you see interviews with people that takes up the other half as well as Walter Cronkite's commentary about the Warren Commission.  I really wish that CBS had put more of the assassination to funeral coverage.  I really wish that CBS would put out the entire four days as it was.  I am certain that it would be expensive but I would certainly purchase it because this is a very unique time in American history.",2,Disappointed,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,758,"['was', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'really', 'missed', 'mark', 'jumped', 'four', 'days', 'left', 'parts', 'coverage', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'CBS', 'program', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'called', '34', 'Four', 'Days', 'November', '34', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'recall', 'hour', 'one', 'half', 'DVD', 'actually', 'assassination', 'funeral', 'then', 'see', 'interviews', 'people', 'up', 'other', 'half', 'as', 'well', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'commentary', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'really', 'wish', 'CBS', 'had', 'put', 'more', 'assassination', 'funeral', 'coverage', 'really', 'wish', 'CBS', 'would', 'put', 'out', 'entire', 'four', 'days', 'was', 'am', 'certain', 'would', 'be', 'expensive', 'would', 'certainly', 'purchase', 'very', 'unique', 'time', 'American', 'history']",As It Happened: JFK Assassination

How could that have been omitted? Then I saw at the end of the program the offer of this video for 3 1/2 hrs on Amazon! Looks like a LOT was left out! Did I miss any info about this program being incomplete? Of course, this is also quite a tease...Looking forward to a lot more info (3 stars since so much was left out of the tv version).",3,Much Shorter on TV!,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,655,"['Just', 'watched', 'one', 'hour', 'program', 'recorded', 'tv', 'few', 'nights', 'ago', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'new', 'CBS', 'investigation', 'was', 'good', 'review', 'theory', 'one', 'shots', 'came', 'School', 'Book', 'Depository', 'Bldg.', 'head', 'shot', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'part', 'investigation', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'Then', 'saw', 'end', 'program', 'offer', 'video', '3', '1/2', 'hrs', 'Amazon', 'LOT', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'Did', 'miss', 'info', 'program', 'being', 'incomplete', 'course', 'also', 'quite', 'tease', 'Looking', 'forward', 'lot', 'more', 'info', '3', 'stars', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'tv', 'version']",As It Happened: JFK Assassination

If the jacket had been worded differently, it would have been all right. I still would have bought it at 90 minutes. I'm tired of getting BONUS Baloney, when what I need is an accurate description of the product. An that's a wrap.The T.V. Presentation seemed to be better with more commentary about some significant observations, the one being Bobby Kennedy blowing past LBJ onto AF 1 when it landed at Andrews.
