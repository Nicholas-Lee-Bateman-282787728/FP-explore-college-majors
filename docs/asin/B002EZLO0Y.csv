1265867,AD1E5FS892L2E,B002EZLO0Y,"Brandon Blankenburg ""Author""","[2, 3]","I did some research on the 3-disc blu-ray set before buying it and learned this set only contains the first 14 episodes, along with the 26th ""making of"" episode. The kicker that makes this blu-ray release extremely odd is the fact that the DVD release contains all 26 episodes. It even has the same cover art. Why the decision was made to only release part of the series to blu, while all of it made it to DVD, is beyond my understanding. Both the blu and DVD sets have been out for a few years (the existing blu-rays even being re-released with DVD's and digital copies). Even foreign releases of this series to blu only contain these same 15 episodes, so if a complete set was planned for blu I think it would have already been released. However, it would be nice if Questar released the remaining episodes to blu-ray on two discs so owners of this set can complete their collection. Anyway, having some of the series is better than none of it.",3,Where's the Rest of It?,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,946,"['did', 'research', '3-disc', 'blu-ray', 'set', 'buying', 'learned', 'set', 'only', 'first', '14', 'episodes', '26th', 'making', 'episode', 'kicker', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'extremely', 'odd', 'fact', 'DVD', 'release', '26', 'episodes', 'even', 'same', 'cover', 'art', 'Why', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'release', 'part', 'series', 'blu', 'made', 'DVD', 'understanding', 'blu', 'DVD', 'sets', 'have', 'been', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'existing', 'blu-rays', 'even', 'being', 're-released', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copies', 'Even', 'foreign', 'releases', 'series', 'blu', 'only', 'contain', 'same', '15', 'episodes', 'so', 'complete', 'set', 'was', 'planned', 'blu', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'However', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Questar', 'released', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'blu-ray', 'two', 'discs', 'owners', 'set', 'can', 'complete', 'collection', 'Anyway', 'having', 'series', 'better', 'none']",Water Life

1265869,A2BFNWTI57900U,B002EZLO0Y,"D. E. Hill ""follower of the art of Natural Hi...","[19, 21]","This is a very disappointing production.  As other reviewers have said, it definitely is far below the quality of recent BBC productions.  In fact, very far below those lofty standards.  If you collect the several criticisms that have been posted on this, they are all correct.  First, unless you know very little about natural history, you will learn nothing from these programs.  I would not say the the narrative is error-prone, as in the narrative in some PBS Nature productions, it is just simple-minded and hard to listen to for any length of time.  In one episode, on fresh water, you will flip from shots of tropical animals to a temperate stream, with no apparent reason.  This is typical- you will be flipped from clip to clip in a sequence that may have been random!  Much of the source material was very low quality, but most of it was very good, in fact.  It is what the film editors did with these clips that boggles the viewers.  Invariably, time motion is jerky and interrupted, so that, in panning landscape shots in particular, there is no smooth motion at all.  At first I thought that this was related to digital artifacts (and there are many of those), but no, this was intentional.  If you see a good clip (and there are many), you will have only about one second at most to watch it, before you are flashed to something else.  Whoever put this together may have had a background in ""creative video editing,"" but clearly no evident appreciation for the thoughtful observation of nature by a viewer.  One would think that the theme of water movement and its impact on various ecosystems could be the basis of a meaningful production, but this one is very hard for me to watch.  Maybe other people process visual information differently than I do!  Anyway, for awesome productions see BBC productions on the Galapagos, Planet Earth, and most of the Yellowstone production.  I really enjoy watching those, as much as I find this water series difficult to enjoy.  Good natural history video?  It starts with outstanding cinematography, but also requires excellent research and thematic focus on scripts, and careful film editing to preserve the special art of this medium.

1265870,AQMI1W1RIRW90,B002EZLO0Y,D. Williams,"[2, 8]","The impressive cover of this supposed documentary got me thinking this might be another ""Planet Earth"" at a much lower price, so I took a chance on it. Boy, was I ever disappointed and angry. The quality of the production isn't even close the the Planet Earth series; the narrative is simplistic and flawed (especially with it's constant focus on a biased and flawed view of the earth's environment). It's not well produced or written and seems to just jump around without a story line or interesting treatment of the topics in the titles. The environmental agenda pushed in this series just made me angry! I struggled to watch the episodes as they continued to pour out their propaganda into many of them! I'm not anti-environment, I'm just a sensible person who recycles, doesn't kill birds and animals for sport, uses water sparingly, drives a very high mpg vehicle, and tries to make my ""footprint"" on each as light as possible. But if the environmental propaganda is your thing, you may be able to stomach this disappointing series. I'm tired of finding most of today's science and environmental information (nature documentaries, etc.) laced with propaganda which is an unfair portrayal of the truth -- I was so angry at giving money to these idiots I had to return the series and get my money back! I should have read the reviews of the series by previous purchasers. I probably would have been given a ""heads up"" about making a purchasing mistake. I usually always read the Amazon reviews on things before I make a purchasing decision. When I find a 5 star rating by a dozen or more people, usually it means that the product can be trusted to be well done, accurate and fair, and a good investment. Because I failed to check the ratings first, I got burned. Fortunately, I was able to return it and get my money back. Don't waste your money!",2,Too Much Environmental Propaganda! It Made Me Angry.
