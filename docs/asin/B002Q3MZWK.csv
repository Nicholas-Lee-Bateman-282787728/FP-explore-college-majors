Velasquez,"[7, 11]","The very likable Ashton Kutcher hasn't exactly had a successful movie career that matches his popularity, which appears to be guided towards romantic comedies, which appear these days to be a kiss of death in tinseltown. So it was a surprise - quite a surprise, I think - to see him starring in a drama. And I'm happy to say that he succeeded, with the penetrating and sincere ""Spread."" This was quite a risk he took, and I believe that it paid off.The film documents the life of one of the many young players in Hollywood, who make a living in dating and moving in with attractive, wealthy women. In this case, the player is Nikky (Kutcher), an unemployed, homeless, and, as he says, ""unreliable"" young man, who knows that he is attractive to women, and also knows how to make them fall for him. One of them is Samantha (Anne Heche), whom he meets at a club and immediately goes to live with her, taking advantage of her beauty and her money, which he pays with incredible amounts of sex. However, he also meets Heather (Margarita Levieva), and his world is turned upside down. Nikki finally meets his match and, unbeknown to him, Heather will determine his future.""Spread"" was directed by David Mackenzie, who also helmed ""Young Adam"" (2003), and who definitely can inject great eroticism in his movies. ""Spread"" is no exception, and the sex scenes are rough and tasty, with Heche, always delightful to watch, providing most of them with Kutcher, who will surprise the ladies. The film shows us part of what goes on in Hollywood on a daily basis, in which the parties doesn't always have a happy ending. The DVD also features making-of and behind the scenes mini-documentaries, and ""The World According to Nikki,"" in which Kutcher talks about the players' rules of attraction.

Nikki choses to pursue his dream by using rich (albeit still attractive) women who will support him in exchange for a willing sexual partner (and perhaps the chance to feel young again).While the film does a good job of showing how someone like Nikki could snare women who have their own dreams of caring for (and dominating) a young player, nothing explains the restlessness and the irrational decisions that Nikki makes once he has clearly snared the blue-blood attorney played beautifully by Anne Heche. Does he feel trapped in the relationship? Does he resent his benefactor? Is he simply easily bored? Does he miss the ""comfort of being sad"" as Kurt Cobain so elegantly once put it?

The character he plays is vacuous, egomaniac, and narcissistic,and Ashton knocks it out of the park.  SPREAD at its very best is unpredictable.  Though the themes and some of the characters may seem familiar the direction they take, and the development of them is refreshingly original.  Ann Heitch, another Hollywood insider I don't care for is simply amazing in the role of an exceedingly rich bachelorette who keeps the company of Kutcher's character with no allusions as to the relationship.SPREAD is a character study of youth, ambition, and empathy, growing old and success or the lack there of....and how these things can grow with you, or you can loose them.  Well acted by all of the cast members SPREAD was a pleasant surprise..and I'm glad I took the time to check it out...it's not suited for all audiences as it does have a lot of adult subject matter in it, but none of it gratuitous and all works exceptionally well in this well made well told story of Dreams, and awakenings.",4,You won't be young and handsome forever...,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,1575,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'not', 'big', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'fan..in', 'fact', 'think', 'fluke', 'have', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seem', 'give', 'bad', 'performance', 'DUDE', 'WHERE', 'MY', 'CAR', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'laugh', 'till', 'cry', 're-telling', 'broken', 'dreams', 'who', 'move', 'LA', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'make', 'big', 'simply', 'end', 'up', 'broke', 'streets', 'doing', 'what', 'ever', 'can', 'survive', 'film', 'out', 'theme', 'WHERE', 'DAY', 'TAKES', 'YOU', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'penniless', 'Lothario', 'who', 'wealthy', 'women', 'become', 'kept', 'man', 'character', 'vacuous', 'egomaniac', 'narcissistic', 'Ashton', 'park', 'SPREAD', 'very', 'best', 'unpredictable', 'themes', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', 'familiar', 'direction', 'take', 'development', 'refreshingly', 'original', 'Ann', 'Heitch', 'Hollywood', 'insider', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'simply', 'amazing', 'role', 'exceedingly', 'rich', 'bachelorette', 'who', 'company', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'allusions', 'relationship.SPREAD', 'character', 'study', 'youth', 'ambition', 'empathy', 'growing', 'old', 'success', 'lack', 'there', '.and', 'how', 'things', 'can', 'grow', 'can', 'loose', 'Well', 'acted', 'cast', 'members', 'SPREAD', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise..and', ""'m"", 'glad', 'took', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'not', 'suited', 'audiences', 'have', 'lot', 'adult', 'subject', 'matter', 'none', 'gratuitous', 'works', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'Dreams', 'awakenings']",N/A

Anyway, we watch all of these shallow people muddle through their cons and bed campaigns as Ashton's character narrates his success strategy at this lifestyle, but in the end I really did not care about any of them. Apparently, (the cover art states) our main character is hoping to find something real, but that never happens as we hop from one party, bed conquest and sleepover to the next. But - they found a way to put 7.1 sound on this film - why of all films does this get the sound some strive to hear all year but only get once or twice?The sound was outstanding. The opening sequence has a helicopter buzz hitting all seven channels, followed by a one-take night club scene (that was very well done: stairs, railing pans, reusing extras, etc.) where the music and voices travel all around you in eloquent fashion. The Blu clarity is outstanding as is the color; plenty of skin tones and dark contrasts against candlelight and such. The LA basin gets shown in all its glory several times in a decent skyline haze. The supplements are:* 16:10 minute Living the Dream (making of). Plenty of production material, hows and whys.* 5:44 minute Behind the Scenes with Ashton. Actually the only Ashton part of this was everyone else talking about how great it is to work with him...yech.* 3:53 minute World According to Nikki. As if they could find a way to get any shallower, Ashton gives the viewer a detailed training academy on how to score a gal in LA...whatever.* Commentary with cast and crew. This is actually an intermittent picture-in-picture. It is a smaller box than normal but the information is interesting and it covered a nice background on how they did the one-take shot. It comes up every few minutes and still allows you to hear what is going on in the film.You read about people claiming this has an amazing ending, a brilliant motif, outstanding neo-realism, blah, blah, blah. Just did not grab me as anything other than a well-filmed depiction of the hedonistic side of LA.If you are a fan of these pretty actresses doing their first hard R roles, than this would be your film (I remember Maragrita the most fromNoise). Watching Ashton walk around in the buff didn't work for me - but I know there is a target audience out there for this one. 2 for the film, 1.5 for the Blu specs and .5 for the supplements.

Wearing a great wardrobe, Ashton's voice is extremely deep as he wanted to give the character debth and originality. L.A. looks breathtaking as the producers wisely shot at various locales in and around Hollywood and that adds to the picture.Anne Heche has a supporting role as one of Ashton's rich girlfriends who keeps him high in the Hollywood Hills in her million dollar mansion, but soon discovers he's seeing other women and throws him out.Not a box office hit, I still enjoyed ""Spread"" tremendously.

1283378,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002Q3MZWK,Z Hayes,"[25, 28]","""Spread"" is basically a grifter movie with Ashton Kutcher playing (rather credibly I might add) Nikki, an over-confident hustler who lacks both a home and a car, and thus resorts to preying on older, successful (yet attractive) women. One of these is Anne Heche, who plays a successful attorney, Samantha, and finding Nikki's brash overtures rather charming, takes him home to her posh pad in the Hollywood Hills. Both Samantha and Nikki have hot sex all over Sam's luxurious property, and the sex scenes are pretty explicit and creative. Nikki should be happy in this arrangement, yet the viewer senses Nikki's restlessness. Instead of cementing the 'deal', Nikki inexplicably resorts to reckless acts, like having sex with another woman in Sam's bed whilst he thinks she's out of town...well, the Nikki-Samantha coupling continues, even as Nikki finds himself increasingly attracted to a waitress, Heather (Margarita Levieva) who is also hustling for money and stuff.This is where the movie sort of veers off tangent and weakens - I found Anne Heche to be an interesting character. She is outwardly confident and controlling in the relationship with Nikki, but then she reveals her own set of insecurities by some of her actions. Unfortunately, when Heather comes into the picture, Heche's Samantha recedes into the background. The Nikki-Heather relationship doesn't altogether add up - Heather reveals certain character deficits which makes one wonder why Nikki is so smitten with her (empathy perhaps?). There are other facets of their relationship that is presented as is with no credible explanation. Ultimately, it's this lack on character development and in-depth exploration that lets this movie down, though it still makes for an interesting and engaging viewing experience.",3,Has potential but lacks depth,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,1784,"['Spread', 'basically', 'grifter', 'movie', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'playing', 'rather', 'credibly', 'might', 'add', 'Nikki', 'over-confident', 'hustler', 'who', 'home', 'car', 'thus', 'resorts', 'preying', 'older', 'successful', 'yet', 'attractive', 'women', 'One', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'who', 'successful', 'attorney', 'Samantha', 'finding', 'Nikki', 'brash', 'overtures', 'rather', 'charming', 'home', 'posh', 'pad', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'Samantha', 'Nikki', 'have', 'hot', 'sex', 'Sam', 'luxurious', 'property', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'explicit', 'creative', 'Nikki', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'arrangement', 'viewer', 'Nikki', 'restlessness', 'Instead', 'cementing', ""'deal"", 'Nikki', 'inexplicably', 'reckless', 'acts', 'having', 'sex', 'woman', 'Sam', 'bed', 'whilst', 'town', 'well', 'Nikki-Samantha', 'coupling', 'even', 'Nikki', 'increasingly', 'attracted', 'waitress', 'Heather', 'Margarita', 'Levieva', 'who', 'also', 'hustling', 'money', 'stuff.This', 'where', 'movie', 'sort', 'veers', 'tangent', 'found', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'be', 'interesting', 'character', 'outwardly', 'confident', 'controlling', 'relationship', 'Nikki', 'then', 'own', 'set', 'insecurities', 'actions', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'Heather', 'picture', 'Heche', 'Samantha', 'background', 'Nikki-Heather', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'altogether', 'add', 'up', 'Heather', 'reveals', 'certain', 'character', 'deficits', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'Nikki', 'so', 'smitten', 'empathy', 'perhaps', 'are', 'other', 'facets', 'relationship', 'presented', 'credible', 'explanation', 'Ultimately', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'in-depth', 'exploration', 'movie', 'down', 'still', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A
