The direction was good. The problem was that the climax of the film was filmed with bad lighting. The last scene was unbelievable and unnecessary. Other than that the film was very entertaining.

She cares too much about what her family thinks. She finds a guy who will pretend to be her man to fool her family into believing they're a couple.I watched this movie because I like Lynn Whitfield, Glynn Turman and Essence Atkins. I was okay with their characters - Harriet, David and Kelly. Brianna (Shari Headley), Chad (Christian Keyes) and Russell (Chico Benymon) were also likable. I didn't like Susan (Denyce Lawton) or Carlton (Reign Morton).The competition between the two sisters was bothersome. Even though she acted as if she wasn't insecure, it seemed Susan was jealous of Kelly. Instead of being so concerned about Kelly's relationship, her attention should have been on her fiance.There was dialogue that suggested that there is something wrong with waiting to have sex. Not a good message to send. There is nothing wrong with waiting. There is a scene where wedding rings on fingers would have been nice;that certainly would have touched my heart.Relationships issues (couples, father/son, siblings), secrets, betrayal, fear of moving forward, and alcoholism are dealt with in this film. Funny at times. Thought-provoking at times.
