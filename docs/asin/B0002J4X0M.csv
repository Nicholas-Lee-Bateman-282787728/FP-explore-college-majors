Rules of counting, sequencing, different names of numbers are all tackled.  With the repetition, my son quickly picked up what counting is all about.  Though he hasn't started talking yet, i'd often catch him playing counting game.  He'd line up his toy cars and start pointing at them with counting aloud in his own words.  Everytime he sees roo hopping on the things as he counts, he'd hop, too, with lots of giggles.  WE love the COUNTING song as well.  It's very catchy and would linger in our tongues even days after the movie.  This is his favorite song right now that can even calm him down when he's so fuzzy in the car.  Get this you'll never be disappointed.

I'm reposting it here, because it's exactly my sentiments.I'm so annoyed, because my 4 year old who could easily count to ten, now often counts in the 'disorder' that Roo was doing when he'd 'forget'. She doesn't understand it isn't correct, she's just memorizing the movie lines.Education sacrificed for entertainment., April 10, 2006By  Soccer mom - See all my reviewsThe story line is too distracting for children to learn anything.The only children wh would benefit frim this video are children who already know how to count.This video isn't repetative enough teach 2 through 5 year olds how to recognize numbers.The parts when the character ""Roo"" gets confuses and counts in ""disorder"" can easily confuse a child just learning how to count and works against parents who count before this video.This video is for entertainment only. It sacrifices learning opportunities for a story line. It will not teach 2 to 5 year old children to recognize numbers and may confuse children who already know how to verbally count.I am very disapointed with this video.
