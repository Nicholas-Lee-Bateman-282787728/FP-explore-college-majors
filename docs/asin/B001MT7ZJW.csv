1217531,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B001MT7ZJW,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[1, 1]","The Goosebumps series consisted of low-budget special effects, bad acting, and a cut-down story due to being only 22 to 44 minutes.The episodes on this single disc are:The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight - Jodie and Mark are visiting their grandparent's farm, when twelve odd scarecrows show up.Don't Go to Sleep - Matt Amsterdam wakes up from a nap to find out that his whole reality has changed.Calling All Creeps - Ricky Beamer wants revenge on a mean girl at school. He puts her phone number in an ad for all creeps to call her, but he wasn't expecting non-humans to reply.These three tales are some of the best of the Goosebumps series. Don't Go to Sleep reminds me of an episode of the X-files, The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight is creepy, and Calling All Creeps is insane!",5,Three Tales to Give You Goosebumps!,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,773,"['Goosebumps', 'series', 'consisted', 'low-budget', 'special', 'effects', 'bad', 'acting', 'cut-down', 'story', 'due', 'being', 'only', '22', '44', 'minutes.The', 'episodes', 'single', 'disc', 'are', 'Scarecrow', 'Walks', 'Midnight', 'Jodie', 'Mark', 'are', 'visiting', 'grandparent', 'farm', 'when', 'twelve', 'odd', 'show', 'up.Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Sleep', 'Matt', 'Amsterdam', 'up', 'nap', 'find', 'out', 'whole', 'reality', 'changed.Calling', 'All', 'Creeps', 'Ricky', 'Beamer', 'revenge', 'mean', 'girl', 'school', 'phone', 'number', 'ad', 'creeps', 'call', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'non-humans', 'reply.These', 'three', 'tales', 'are', 'best', 'Goosebumps', 'series', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Sleep', 'episode', 'X-files', 'Scarecrow', 'Walks', 'Midnight', 'creepy', 'Calling', 'Creeps', 'insane']",Goosebumps: The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight

1217533,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B001MT7ZJW,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[4, 5]","The R.L. Stine ""Goosebumps"" book series has been popular for years, and my three children enjoy watching the new series on DVD.  This disc contains three scary episodes: ""The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight"", ""Don't go to Sleep"", and ""Calling all Creeps"".In the first episode, Jodie and Mark go to their grandparents' farm to spend the summer.  Upon arriving, the children sense something different from the times they were there previously.  The field is full of scary scarecrows, plus, the hired hand is acting very strangely.  But, the terror begins when the scarecrows come to life!In episode two, Mark Amsterdam is jealous of his older brother and sister getting to do whatever they wish.  Mark wants to move his bedroom to the upstairs attic.  Before moving, he goes to the attic and falls asleep.  During his nap, he has a strange dream that convinces him that things are better they way they are.In the final episode, Ricky Beamer publishes an ad in the school newspaper, hoping to get revenge against the kids who are picking on him.  Unfortunately, someone changes the ad, and now Ricky is the one getting strange phonecalls late at night.My children and I really enjoy the ""Goosebumps"" series.  The stories are scary, but not so much as to really frighten young children.  The episodes are short, so the kids maintain their attention throughout.  If you want a good, fun scare, then check out this great DVD, as well as others in the series.",4,3 Scary Tales from R.L.

It dumb on an adult level but just right for a child or most children. I had one who didn't like it because it scared her but not to the point of nightmares. but the rest never moved till it was over!,4,Goosebumps: The Scarecrow walks at Midnight,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,285,"['bought', 'Grand', 'kids', 'watch', 'when', 'come', 'visit', 'enjoyed', 'adult', 'level', 'just', 'right', 'child', 'most', 'children', 'had', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'scared', 'not', 'point', 'nightmares', 'rest', 'never', 'moved', 'till', 'was', 'over']",Goosebumps: The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight
