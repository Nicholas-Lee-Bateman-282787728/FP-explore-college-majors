So just as we're getting interested in the actual ballets, the scene is cut short. Which leaves the viewer wondering what it was exactly that made Nijinsky a legend in the first place. I found it deeply disappointing, as lots of the dance footage that was used to promote the film, is not in the final cut. It's lovely to look at, but considering that Herbert Ross had done such a good job of filming dance with The Turning Point, this is deeply ordinary.",3,nijinsky,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,615,"['big', 'probem', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'heavily', 're-edited', 'initial', 'screenings', 'huge', 'chunks', 'ballet', 'scenes', 'were', 'trimmed', 'out', 'So', 'just', ""'re"", 'getting', 'interested', 'actual', 'ballets', 'scene', 'cut', 'short', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'what', 'was', 'exactly', 'made', 'Nijinsky', 'legend', 'first', 'place', 'found', 'deeply', 'disappointing', 'lots', 'dance', 'footage', 'was', 'used', 'promote', 'film', 'not', 'final', 'cut', 'lovely', 'look', 'considering', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'had', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'filming', 'dance', 'Turning', 'Point', 'deeply', 'ordinary']",N/A
248673,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,6301272307,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[6, 6]","Vaslav Nijinsky was a genius of the ballet stage who shone brilliantly and briefly. After his mental breakdown in 1917, when the First World War and the Russian Revolution burst onto the world scene, he spent the final 35 years of his life in institutions. As the star danseur/choreographer of the Ballets Russes with his mentor/lover Sergei Diaghilev, he was a glimmering, androgynous figure in ""Specter of the Rose"" and ""Scheherezade."" He broke the musical rules inStravinsky: The Rite of SpringandDebussy: Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.In this 1980 biopic, George De La Pena stars as Nijinsky (there was going to be a biopic with Rudolf Nureyev in the lead,but it was scrapped). As a professional dancer, De La Pena is luminous. He is not pretending to be a dancer;he is the dancer. Alan Bates (Women in Love,Hamlet (1990)) is wonderful as Diaghilev, who struggles with his art, his business, and being Nijinsky's older lover. He comes across as both predatory and sympathetic, a deeply troubled genius. Jeremy Irons makes his cinematic debut as Michel Fokine. Leslie Brown stars as Romola, who comes across as a stalker. It is true she pursued Nijinsky, and when Nijinsky makes love to her to the strains ofStravinsky: Le Sacre du Printemps - Ballets by Uwe Scholz, his heterosexuality is seen as a symptom of his impending breakdown rather than healing. Romola apologizes to Diaghilev for trying to straighten out Nijinsky, but he consoles her saying that she is the best thing that happened to Vaslav. Romola is transformed from a celebrity-worshipping stalker to a compassionate caretaker.""Nijinsky"" is an electrifying biopic. The final words of the movie are of Nijinsky himself, ""I am Nijinsky of God, the clown of God.""",5,Lord of the Dance,1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,1734,"['Vaslav', 'Nijinsky', 'was', 'genius', 'ballet', 'stage', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'briefly', 'mental', 'breakdown', '1917', 'when', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'burst', 'world', 'scene', 'spent', 'final', '35', 'years', 'life', 'institutions', 'star', 'danseur/choreographer', 'Ballets', 'mentor/lover', 'Sergei', 'Diaghilev', 'was', 'glimmering', 'androgynous', 'figure', 'Specter', 'Rose', 'Scheherezade', 'broke', 'musical', 'rules', 'inStravinsky', 'Rite', 'SpringandDebussy', 'Prelude', 'Afternoon', 'Faun.In', '1980', 'biopic', 'George', 'De', 'La', 'Pena', 'Nijinsky', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'biopic', 'Rudolf', 'Nureyev', 'lead', 'was', 'scrapped', 'professional', 'dancer', 'De', 'La', 'Pena', 'luminous', 'not', 'pretending', 'be', 'dancer', 'dancer', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Women', 'Love', 'Hamlet', '1990', 'wonderful', 'Diaghilev', 'who', 'art', 'business', 'being', 'Nijinsky', 'older', 'lover', 'predatory', 'sympathetic', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'genius', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'cinematic', 'debut', 'Michel', 'Fokine', 'Leslie', 'Brown', 'stars', 'Romola', 'who', 'across', 'stalker', 'true', 'pursued', 'Nijinsky', 'when', 'Nijinsky', 'love', 'strains', 'ofStravinsky', 'Le', 'Sacre', 'du', 'Printemps', 'Ballets', 'Uwe', 'Scholz', 'heterosexuality', 'seen', 'symptom', 'impending', 'rather', 'healing', 'Romola', 'Diaghilev', 'trying', 'straighten', 'out', 'Nijinsky', 'saying', 'best', 'thing', 'happened', 'Vaslav', 'Romola', 'transformed', 'celebrity-worshipping', 'stalker', 'compassionate', 'caretaker', 'Nijinsky', 'electrifying', 'biopic', 'final', 'words', 'movie', 'are', 'Nijinsky', 'am', 'Nijinsky', 'God', 'clown', 'God']",N/A

I will say this: I saw Nijinsky upon its first release in 1980, and I was impressed enough to return to the theatre again, to see if my original impressions were accurate. I was both enchanted and more than pleased by the entire production. I've read the definitive 1970 biography Nijinsky by Richard Buckle (in fact I still own it), and this film is as close as you will ever get to seeing a portrait of his time. Not only the man, but his peers, and events that shaped and inspired his turbulent vision are portrayed with great care and thought. The colors of the film are vibrant and rich, and true to the art of Leon Bakst, principal designer to the ballet troupe. I felt like I was transported to this marvellous age, when electricity was still a wonder, great luxury liners rode the waves, and the airplane was discovering the sky while the automobile and railroads crossed the land. It was the age of Empires, yet the world still held unexplored places waiting to be mapped. The Arts really could present The Shock Of The New, while the working classes discovered their strength in strikes and unions and the wealthy lived in opulence. For me, this film worked on every level. A mirror in time, and the breakdown of an artist's mind. A distant era, a beautiful film, a sad ending... Yet we are left knowing that Nijinsky, with all his visions of light and shadow, was never left alone, never forgotten. This broken man was cared for, and still loved. We should all be so fortunate. If I have any regret about this film, it is that it has yet to be released on dvd. I sincerely hope that oversight will one day be corrected.",4,"Too Beautiful, So Fragile-  And A Visual Feast For The Eyes",1082073600,"04 16, 2004",2004,1745,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'write', 'too', 'much', 'exceptional', 'film-', 'reviewer', 'already', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'will', 'say', 'saw', 'Nijinsky', 'first', 'release', '1980', 'was', 'impressed', 'enough', 'return', 'theatre', 'again', 'see', 'original', 'impressions', 'were', 'accurate', 'was', 'enchanted', 'more', 'pleased', 'entire', 'production', ""'ve"", 'read', 'definitive', '1970', 'biography', 'Nijinsky', 'Richard', 'Buckle', 'fact', 'still', 'own', 'film', 'as', 'close', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'seeing', 'portrait', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'man', 'peers', 'events', 'shaped', 'inspired', 'turbulent', 'vision', 'are', 'portrayed', 'great', 'care', 'thought', 'colors', 'film', 'are', 'vibrant', 'rich', 'true', 'art', 'Leon', 'Bakst', 'principal', 'designer', 'ballet', 'troupe', 'felt', 'was', 'transported', 'marvellous', 'age', 'when', 'electricity', 'was', 'still', 'wonder', 'great', 'luxury', 'liners', 'rode', 'waves', 'airplane', 'was', 'discovering', 'sky', 'automobile', 'railroads', 'crossed', 'land', 'was', 'age', 'Empires', 'yet', 'world', 'still', 'held', 'unexplored', 'places', 'waiting', 'be', 'mapped', 'Arts', 'really', 'could', 'present', 'Shock', 'New', 'working', 'classes', 'discovered', 'strength', 'strikes', 'unions', 'wealthy', 'lived', 'opulence', 'film', 'worked', 'level', 'mirror', 'time', 'breakdown', 'artist', 'mind', 'distant', 'era', 'beautiful', 'film', 'sad', 'ending', 'are', 'left', 'knowing', 'Nijinsky', 'visions', 'light', 'shadow', 'was', 'never', 'left', 'alone', 'never', 'forgotten', 'broken', 'man', 'was', 'cared', 'still', 'loved', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'fortunate', 'have', 'regret', 'film', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'dvd', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'oversight', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'corrected']",N/A

248681,A2G935GMRAUIRW,6301272307,Sandy McLendon,"[63, 63]","Hard to believe that ""Nijinsky"" is now a twenty-two-year-old film; its look and performances are so fresh that it could be the latest from Ivory-Merchant.The film focuses on the period 1912-1913, when Vaslav Nijinsky was both at his height as a choreographer, and at his lowest point personally. He was under the guidance and domination of impresario Sergei Diaghilev in his work and his love life, and he was also being pursued by ballet groupie Romola de Pulzsky, who eventually met and indeed married him.The film is based on actual events, but viewers should be aware that the script takes minor liberties with historical time frames, character motivations, and events to advance its story. The production is mounted most handsomely, with the London Festival Ballet helping to recreate Nijinsky's most famous works. The ballet sequences are beautifully filmed, but many suffer from being cut very short. However, ""L'Apres-midi d'un Faune"" is presented at decent length, and there is an amazing, if too-brief, re-creation of the lost Nijinsky ballet ""Jeux"", done entirely from old photos and Valentine Gross's drawings of the original production.The major performances are beautifully detailled; George de la Pena's Nijinsky is as winning and as troubled as we believe the actual man to have been. Alan Bates' Sergei Diaghilev is charming, ruthless, and ultimately defeated. Italian ballerina Carla Fracci plays Nijinsky's dancing partner Tamara Karsavina as tender, elegant, and nobody's fool- which is, according to Fracci enthusiasts, type-casting at its best. The one performance that is somewhat vague and unformed is Leslie Browne's as Romola; it may be that she or director Herbert Ross was trying to suggest that Romola was too immature to manage the torrents of emotion she unleashed between herself, Nijinsky, and Diaghilev. Alan Badel gives his final screen performance as Diaghilev's financial backer Baron de Guinzbourg; his plummy portrayal is one of the film's chief delights.I've heard this movie described as disappointing by others, but I think the trouble stems from the history it portrays. The love triangle ends badly, with Nijinsky leaving lover Diaghilev to marry Romola, and subsequently descending into madness. This obviously is not satisfactory dramatic structure, but that's the way it happened, folks, and the movie begs, as it must, the unanswerable question of whether Nijinsky's marriage had anything to do with his illness.For those who want to know what happened after this film's story ends, Romola stood by Nijinsky for the three decades of his schizophrenia, making certain that he had the funds and the care he needed. Shepherding someone through such an illness in Central Europe over the course of two world wars was certainly an act of the most extreme devotion. As Alan Bates' Diaghilev says to Romola at the end of the movie, ""I suspect you are the best thing that could have happened to him.""Whether you agree or not, you won't regret the time spent watching this one.",4,Well Worth A Viewing,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,3016,"['Hard', 'believe', 'Nijinsky', 'now', 'twenty-two-year-old', 'film', 'look', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'fresh', 'could', 'be', 'latest', 'Ivory-Merchant.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'period', '1912-1913', 'when', 'Vaslav', 'Nijinsky', 'was', 'height', 'choreographer', 'lowest', 'point', 'personally', 'was', 'guidance', 'domination', 'impresario', 'Sergei', 'Diaghilev', 'work', 'love', 'life', 'was', 'also', 'being', 'pursued', 'ballet', 'groupie', 'Romola', 'de', 'Pulzsky', 'who', 'eventually', 'met', 'indeed', 'married', 'him.The', 'film', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'viewers', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'script', 'minor', 'liberties', 'historical', 'time', 'frames', 'character', 'motivations', 'events', 'advance', 'story', 'production', 'mounted', 'most', 'handsomely', 'London', 'Festival', 'Ballet', 'helping', 'recreate', 'Nijinsky', 'most', 'famous', 'works', 'ballet', 'sequences', 'are', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'many', 'suffer', 'being', 'cut', 'very', 'short', 'However', ""L'Apres-midi"", ""d'un"", 'Faune', 'presented', 'decent', 'length', 'amazing', 'too-brief', 're-creation', 'lost', 'Nijinsky', 'ballet', 'Jeux', 'done', 'entirely', 'old', 'photos', 'Valentine', 'Gross', 'drawings', 'original', 'production.The', 'major', 'performances', 'are', 'beautifully', 'detailled', 'George', 'la', 'Pena', 'Nijinsky', 'winning', 'as', 'troubled', 'believe', 'actual', 'man', 'have', 'been', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Sergei', 'Diaghilev', 'charming', 'ruthless', 'ultimately', 'defeated', 'Italian', 'ballerina', 'Carla', 'Fracci', 'Nijinsky', 'dancing', 'partner', 'Tamara', 'Karsavina', 'tender', 'elegant', 'nobody', 'fool-', 'according', 'Fracci', 'enthusiasts', 'type-casting', 'best', 'one', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'vague', 'unformed', 'Leslie', 'Browne', 'Romola', 'may', 'be', 'director', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'was', 'trying', 'suggest', 'Romola', 'was', 'too', 'immature', 'manage', 'torrents', 'emotion', 'unleashed', 'Nijinsky', 'Diaghilev', 'Alan', 'Badel', 'final', 'screen', 'performance', 'Diaghilev', 'financial', 'backer', 'Baron', 'Guinzbourg', 'plummy', 'portrayal', 'one', 'film', 'chief', 'delights.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', 'described', 'disappointing', 'others', 'think', 'trouble', 'history', 'love', 'triangle', 'badly', 'Nijinsky', 'leaving', 'lover', 'Diaghilev', 'marry', 'Romola', 'subsequently', 'descending', 'madness', 'obviously', 'not', 'satisfactory', 'dramatic', 'structure', 'way', 'happened', 'folks', 'movie', 'begs', 'must', 'unanswerable', 'question', 'Nijinsky', 'marriage', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'illness.For', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'story', 'Romola', 'stood', 'Nijinsky', 'three', 'decades', 'schizophrenia', 'making', 'certain', 'had', 'funds', 'care', 'needed', 'Shepherding', 'someone', 'illness', 'Central', 'Europe', 'course', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'was', 'certainly', 'act', 'most', 'extreme', 'devotion', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Diaghilev', 'Romola', 'end', 'movie', 'suspect', 'are', 'best', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'agree', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'one']",N/A
