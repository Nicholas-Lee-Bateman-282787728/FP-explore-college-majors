Aside from a couple, these act normal, talk, and aren't too interested in eating brains.I've seen some horrible b-movies that drag forever and this one isn't one of those.  It is 75 minutes long and, to me, was entertaining.  The story is puzzling and makes you shake your head.  Some of the images and scenes are just haunting in the lack of people in this old big city.  If this was seen in theaters, I'm sure there are a few moments that would make the audience jump.It's not a fantastic movie by any sense of the imagination, but it's not as bad as the two previous reviewers make it sound.",3,Not that bad.,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,688,"['love', 'zombie', 'movies', 'case', 'one', 'disappointing', 'Not', 'typical', 'zombies', 'Aside', 'couple', 'act', 'normal', 'talk', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'interested', 'eating', 'brains.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'horrible', 'b-movies', 'drag', 'forever', 'one', ""n't"", 'one', '75', 'minutes', 'long', 'was', 'entertaining', 'story', 'puzzling', 'shake', 'head', 'images', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'haunting', 'lack', 'people', 'old', 'big', 'city', 'was', 'seen', 'theaters', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'would', 'make', 'audience', 'jump.It', 'not', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'sense', 'imagination', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'two', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'make', 'sound']",Dead Don't Die VHS
243394,AKR5TCYHJ9G2H,6301017250,"Barry L. Shirley ""Barry 1965""","[1, 6]","This Made for TV movie from the mid-70s although the only memory I had of it was the symbol emblazened on the palms of the zombies...(a snake I think).  Starts out with the execution of a man and his long lost brother comes to say goodbye and to avenge his brother's death by proving his innocence.  Seeing his brother after the execution he follows his brother into a shop only to discover he's not really there. Hmmmm..... Well, he turns to the owner of a dance hall for help, a place where his brother had won a dance marathon once...turns out this guy is the ""Zombie Master""  and he likes to bring back dead people through voodoo who have unjustly died.  He apparently wants to gather enough of them to take over the world.  But, George Hamilton soon puts a stop to this, even though nobody believes him...  There are several holes here and there and you can't quite figure out what the hell is going on.  But being such a simple script, you can pretty much fill in the gaps on your own.  This movie does have somewhat of a creepy feel, but that's about as scary as this thing gets.  No blood, no guts, no brain munching... Just zombies that look like me and you.  Here's hoping they don't put this one on DVD.",2,"Made for TV Zombies: No Gore, No Cannabalism.....",1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,1214,"['Made', 'TV', 'movie', 'mid-70s', 'only', 'memory', 'had', 'was', 'symbol', 'emblazened', 'palms', 'zombies', 'snake', 'think', 'out', 'execution', 'man', 'long', 'lost', 'brother', 'say', 'goodbye', 'avenge', 'brother', 'death', 'proving', 'innocence', 'Seeing', 'brother', 'execution', 'brother', 'shop', 'only', 'discover', 'not', 'really', 'there', 'Hmmmm', '..', 'Well', 'owner', 'dance', 'hall', 'help', 'place', 'where', 'brother', 'had', 'won', 'dance', 'marathon', 'once', 'out', 'guy', 'Zombie', 'Master', 'bring', 'back', 'dead', 'people', 'voodoo', 'who', 'have', 'unjustly', 'died', 'apparently', 'gather', 'enough', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'soon', 'stop', 'even', 'nobody', 'are', 'several', 'holes', 'here', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'being', 'such', 'simple', 'script', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'fill', 'gaps', 'own', 'movie', 'have', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'feel', 'about', 'as', 'scary', 'thing', 'blood', 'guts', 'brain', 'munching', 'Just', 'zombies', 'look', 'Here', 'hoping', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'one', 'DVD']",Dead Don't Die VHS

Even for a measley $3 I feel ripped off. There is no redeeming quality in this movie, it drags and drags with no substance, not a single scary or enlightening moment. Just a really bad 70's film. It had Poor film quality, corny dialouge, ridiculous zombies (were they even trying to make them look liek zombies), boring music scores. The basis of the stroy was some guy's brother gets the electric chair. And before his brother died, he made a promise to find the real killer of his sister in law. Turns out there was some stupid plot about a zombie master. The story on the back of the box made it sound like a big epic apocalyptic movie because the &quot;Zombie Master&quot; (who's just some old ugly guy) tries to take over the world with zombies (which are just people that give you blank stares, oh yeah and there was only one zombie) Throughout the whole film I was so bored that I actually wished I was in math class! By all means avoid at all costs and if you haven't seen this pathetic excuse of a movie yet, count your blessings. The title makes it soudns like one of those artsy italian zombie films but it's not. The movie has no effect on the viewers at all. You'll just see fuzzy people talking about silly things and giving poor performances over a story that doesn't make sense.
