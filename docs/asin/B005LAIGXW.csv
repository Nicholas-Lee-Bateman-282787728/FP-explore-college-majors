It's an action adventure-romance where Reese joins an online dating service and is pursued by two government special agents (Chris Pine--yum and Tom Hardy--also yum).  The guys are also in pursuit of a Russian criminal. Both agents fall in love with Reese and use every government gadget and device to gaiin an advantage to win her over. Too bad the movie had this title as it kept me from going to see it at the theater.  Have a copy of it now and have watched it several times.

No chemistry except a little between the male leads. She picks the bad boy that she intensely dislikes at first and all we are shown is a fake kiss to make her ex jealous as a turn toward liking him. Both men are totally lying and faking to win her over and after she finds out, she is only mad for a moment and then picks one! There are a few laughs, one when Chelsea's car lands in a lake (where were the airbags?), and one when Bad Boy appears to have fallen asleep. Of course this sleeping scene has him asleep at one angle with his head back, and then with his head flat in the next angle, and then back to flat again.

And I am a sucker for a romantic comedy and have a rather high threshold of tolerance of plot holes for the sake of a cute love story or likable characters.But there is nothing really cute in this story, it's barely a love story, for that matter: the chemistry between characters is non-existent, so you really don't care who she ends up with.Like someone else said, to call it ""clich&eacute;d"" would be to pay this movie a compliment.The premise is fun, and it could be a fun little movie, but the execution of the premise is so weak that it is painful to watch.  Dialogue is something I could have written (and that is NOT saying much), characters are two-dimensional, their inner life non-existent, the girl's final decision can be guessed before she even enters the movie.Really, about 30 seconds worth of fun that you see in a trailer are about the only redeeming things about this movie.

1465907,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIGXW,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","Poor Reese Witherspoon.  It seems like her career has taken a serious nosedive since she won the Oscar back in 2005.  Before that Oscar win she was America's Sweetheart, had a lucrative career, was a memorable comedic actress who commanded with dramatic temperament and who had already secured a place in everyone's heart with her rich performances in `Election', `Legally Blond' and `Walk the Line'.  Since her win she's gotten horribly rusty and can't seem to make a decent movie, let alone put in a decent performance.She makes me uncomfortable.I'm not one who likes to pick apart an actress based on petty things, but Reese isn't aging well (she's gotten so hard looking) and so she really needs to pick roles that don't make her the center point of male attraction.  It just isn't working out for her.But, `This Means War' is far from Reese's failure alone.  No, this film doesn't work for many, many reasons.  Most of all, it's just plain stupid.  Sure, we have to expect that to a certain degree because of the trailer itself.  I don't think anyone would watch the trailer, note the target audience and assume this were a masterpiece of cinema, but one should expect a little brains with the bravado.  Sadly, this film fails to bring either.  The love triangle between Foster, Tuck and Lauren is uninteresting and the way they go about their petty competition for her heart is insufferably unintelligent.  I mean, they obviously think the audience is stupid, and so they continually insult us with ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario.  Chris Pine hasn't interested me since `Star Trek' and here he lacks nearly all charm he needs to carry his character.  Tom Hardy is the only thing that works about this film (he's sensitive, childishly charming and actually funny) but he can't make the premise, which is just so forced, work.The action scenes are slicked up and feel like a rip on something by Michael Bay, but they are laced with so much preposterousness (the final chase scene is strangely anti-climactic and the inclusion of Lauren's input makes this just silly) that they fail to make any real impact.  But this film fails mostly because of the core love story, which makes little sense, especially Lauren's final decision (even though it was expected when you consider where it leads).All in all, a dumb film can be fun if the dumb isn't so dumb it makes you feel dumb for watching it.",1,This is just dumb...,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,2410,"['Poor', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'career', 'taken', 'serious', 'nosedive', 'won', 'Oscar', 'back', '2005', 'Oscar', 'win', 'was', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'had', 'lucrative', 'career', 'was', 'memorable', 'comedic', 'actress', 'who', 'commanded', 'dramatic', 'temperament', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'secured', 'place', 'everyone', 'heart', 'rich', 'performances', 'Election', 'Legally', 'Blond', 'Walk', 'Line', 'win', 'gotten', 'horribly', 'rusty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'decent', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'put', 'decent', 'performance.She', 'uncomfortable.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'pick', 'apart', 'actress', 'based', 'petty', 'things', 'Reese', ""n't"", 'aging', 'well', 'gotten', 'so', 'hard', 'looking', 'so', 'really', 'pick', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'center', 'point', 'male', 'attraction', 'just', ""n't"", 'working', 'out', 'her.But', 'Means', 'War', 'far', 'Reese', 'failure', 'alone', 'No', 'film', ""n't"", 'work', 'many', 'many', 'reasons', 'Most', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Sure', 'have', 'expect', 'certain', 'degree', 'trailer', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'watch', 'trailer', 'note', 'target', 'audience', 'assume', 'were', 'masterpiece', 'cinema', 'one', 'should', 'expect', 'little', 'brains', 'bravado', 'Sadly', 'film', 'bring', 'either', 'love', 'triangle', 'Foster', 'Tuck', 'Lauren', 'uninteresting', 'way', 'go', 'petty', 'competition', 'heart', 'insufferably', 'unintelligent', 'mean', 'obviously', 'think', 'audience', 'stupid', 'so', 'continually', 'insult', 'ridiculous', 'scenario', 'ridiculous', 'scenario', 'Chris', 'Pine', ""n't"", 'interested', 'Star', 'Trek', 'here', 'nearly', 'charm', 'carry', 'character', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'sensitive', 'childishly', 'charming', 'actually', 'funny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'premise', 'just', 'so', 'forced', 'work.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'slicked', 'up', 'feel', 'rip', 'something', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'are', 'laced', 'so', 'much', 'preposterousness', 'final', 'chase', 'scene', 'strangely', 'anti-climactic', 'inclusion', 'Lauren', 'input', 'just', 'silly', 'fail', 'make', 'real', 'impact', 'film', 'mostly', 'core', 'love', 'story', 'little', 'sense', 'especially', 'Lauren', 'final', 'decision', 'even', 'was', 'expected', 'when', 'consider', 'where', '.All', 'dumb', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'dumb', ""n't"", 'so', 'dumb', 'feel', 'dumb', 'watching']",N/A

Something beyond..is there anything better than that after we have this or that whats next something new innovative surprising like an apothecary from ancient times, a metallurgist transmuting base materials into gold..from the opening scene in the shopping store, and is there anything bette than Tide, and the young women walk right by Tide dont even look for what..I always check the price of Tide it cleans inside out. The lead after having gone through a bad relationship..wants something beyond the generic..willing to pay for it..yet at the end all we have are romps and sex and somethings gone wrong..the men try to capture the girl like putting something in your pocket..that goes wrong..there's some sex..and even at the film's finale the two boys, men..wonder about who slept with whom..and the female may sleep here and there...these two CIA spies at the start of the film from Hong KOng to a sushi bar..and there's much action and violence..and is a fun film and you should leave it there thats all it's meant to be..it in no way tries to be that type of film serious reviewers want..viewers found it enjoyable..a young girl choosing among suitors..equally covetous..and perhaps the sex..thats all you can expect from these two..there are some fun lines on role playing..and Reese witherspoon the actress seems to play this hip chick al too well much as she was good in Vanity Fair and classic type roles..and in very short time taking on roles very swift and mastering them..like the apartment scene with the music on the large TV..roles..alter egos..thats why a writer having her in a film..knows the scenes can move swiftly and the audience will pick her up quick..but the characters never get much beyond beyond beyond..generics..these type of stories work best when a background is well written up and firmly implanted in us..but all we ever get is the surface trinity of romance..the spy from Hong KOng fizzles and seems just violence and car chase scenes and we dont know why or what is goin gon there and it seems like a chop suey movie..inundating our chracters lives..it tries to be  aglobal tale with people from different places..and scenes..and that too doesnt succeed that well..I like a movie where the heroine from Atlanta does not feel at the end she has to choose from two..but there's only one choice..she loves and is capable of loving..but we know when she passed up on the Tide..a long scene what we were in for..I think its fun watching an actress who can tap into alter egos and then return to a normal state..some are very good..they are great actresses..even when its a different person..but tap into it like from the beyond..",4,a look for something beyond...,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,3144,"['Here', 'have', 'movie', 'was', 'putting', 'off', 'watching', 'awhile',

The appeal of the story structure is part of the success since a beautiful woman in love with two men, trying to choose between them, is a never fail plot strategy. Having the two guys appeal to the audience as much as they appeal to the character played by Reese Witherspoon kept up the suspense. Male competition is also a great plot element and this film has the two fellows in competition while at the same time dependent on each other while serving as CIA agents.Reese Witherspoon is excellent, as always, but during the film I realized how often she tilts her head when talking to a man, conveying almost constant seduction.  One of the agents, played by Chris Pine is the playboy type and thus the viewer wonders whether Reese is the woman that can make this playboy settle down. He is contrasted with another CIA agent, played by Tom Hardy, a man with family instincts. Chelsea Handler plays Reese Witherspoon's best friend who offers terrible advice.This is a good romantic comedy with Reese Witherspoon in rare form.

It has beautifully shot and choreographed action scenes, it has beautiful leads characters, it has romance and it maintains a fun pace throughout. Director McG (Charlies Angels & Terminator Salvation) is an experienced action director, and he should have had and still could have a gold mine idea with ""This Means War"".The movie is essentially a Spy vs. Spy storyline with a girl in between. The problem is, they didn't do anything particularly creative with the creative idea. Two long time friends and CIA operatives, Tuck (Tom Hardy) and FDR (Chris Pine) spend most of their lives embroiled in deep secret government operations, so there is no time for love. Lauren, (Reese Witherspoon) spends most of her time embroiled in her work as a product tester. When the three of them find each other, separately, the competition for Lauren's affection begins.""This Means War"" is pure fun. If you start to think about the things happening in the movie, you're going to ruin it for yourselves. For instance, the fact that the two CIA operatives have basically tapped and wired every aspect of Lauren's life, or are using their skills to slither through her apartment while she's popping popcorn, is a little disturbing. It's a good thing they are good looking celebrities, because most men would be shot and/or locked up for such things.All in all though, ""This Means War"" is a fun time at the movies. You will laugh and you will be entertained, but you won't be challenged by the cookie-cutter and highly predictable screenplay that doesn't twist or turn. It maybe would have faired better had the movie incorporated the villan, Heinrich (Til Schweiger), into the storyline more than just the beginning and the end. The fact that the two CIA operatives were on a job and could have been putting their love interest in a lot of danger never became an issue and if it had, it would have been a better movie.",3,"Fun, Entertaining, PREDICTABLE",1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,2025,"['Means', 'War', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'date', 'movie', 'had', 'better', 'screenplay', 'still', 'something', 'genders', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'choreographed', 'action', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'leads', 'characters', 'romance', 'fun', 'pace', 'Director', 'McG', 'Charlies', 'Angels', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', 'experienced', 'action', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'gold', 'mine', 'idea', 'Means', 'War', '.The', 'movie', 'essentially', 'Spy', 'vs.', 'Spy', 'storyline', 'girl', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'particularly', 'creative', 'creative', 'idea', 'Two', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'Tuck', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'FDR', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'spend', 'most', 'lives', 'embroiled', 'deep', 'secret', 'government', 'operations', 'time', 'love', 'Lauren', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'most', 'time', 'embroiled', 'work', 'product', 'tester', 'When', 'three', 'find', 'other', 'separately', 'competition', 'Lauren', 'affection', 'Means', 'War', 'pure', 'fun', 'start', 'think', 'things', 'happening', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'ruin', 'yourselves', 'instance', 'fact', 'two', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'have', 'basically', 'tapped', 'wired', 'aspect', 'Lauren', 'life', 'are', 'using', 'skills', 'slither', 'apartment', 'popping', 'popcorn', 'little', 'disturbing', 'good', 'thing', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'celebrities', 'most', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'shot', 'and/or', 'locked', 'up', 'such', 'things.All', 'Means', 'War', 'fun', 'time', 'movies', 'will', 'laugh', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'challenged', 'cookie-cutter', 'highly', 'predictable', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'twist', 'turn', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'faired', 'better', 'had', 'movie', 'incorporated', 'villan', 'Heinrich', 'Til', 'Schweiger', 'storyline', 'more', 'just', 'beginning', 'end', 'fact', 'two', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'were', 'job', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'putting', 'love', 'interest', 'lot', 'danger', 'never', 'became', 'issue', 'had', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie']",N/A

1465952,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIGXW,C. Sawin,"[10, 14]","McG hasn't really been seen in the director's chair since Terminator Salvation hit theaters back in 2009. Audiences were split as to whether they actually enjoyed Salvation or not as critics hated it and the movie failed to make back its budget in its domestic gross. So what's the logical next step after doing a movie about the nuclear holocaust and the ongoing war between humans and humanoid machines? You could probably guess the action bit, but the romantic comedy part would probably throw you off.This Means War is the story of FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) two CIA agents who are two of the best agents in their field. FDR and Tuck are partners and best friends, but come to a gentleman's agreement when they both start dating the same woman named Lauren (Reese Witherspoon). Both FDR and Tuck begin falling for Lauren and not only begin breaking the rules that they set for one another, but use whatever means necessary to keep Lauren in their good graces.This Means War throws you right into one of FDR and Tuck's missions right from the start. The main issue becomes how dizzying the camera work is. The action hits extremely hard and is incredibly fast paced, but you have a difficult time actually following just what is transpiring in these quick cuts let alone trying to keep your wits about you. This is kind of odd since I wasn't a fan of Terminator Salvation, but felt like one of its strongest qualities was how the camera always seemed to be in the right place during the action. Maybe McG decided to regress back to his Charlie's Angels mindset for This Means War.The action heavy romantic comedy is dragged down by annoying girl talk. Lauren and her friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) do nothing but whine and complain about their lives the entire movie while also revealing they're basically the most promiscuous girls around. This Means War paints this picture of women that they all date multiple guys at once and will put out just to try and make a decision. It's pretty demeaning to women in general. Between Lauren and Trish's talks of the size of a man's private parts or a lightning round involving sex, every inch of dialogue between them is unbearable right from the start. Meanwhile, FDR and Tuck have quite a bit of immature bickering between one another as well. It becomes borderline homophobic at times and just feels very third grade for nearly half of the film. The second half becomes a little easier to digest and the highlight comes when FDR mocks Tuck's British accent.The storyline is very imbecilic, as well. Using the gadgets, technology, and basically every ounce of intelligence of the CIA to try and win over a woman is just asinine. The actual mission, which is certainly more interesting than the love triangle you're forced to endure, isn't even second fiddle. It's more like the third or fourth subplot of the movie. The FDR/Tuck/Lauren love triangle being the primary, FDR/Tuck's friendship falling apart being the secondary, Lauren trying to mull things over with Trish being the third, and Tuck trying to be a stand up family man the fourth. So that would make the actual mission the fifth subplot of the movie. How lame is that?This Means War does get a little less irritating as it progresses. The jokes get slightly less offensive and Tom Hardy still manages to be the best part of the movie. While Reese Witherspoon has to make it a point to try and jiggle around while wearing horrible clothes and singing off key and Chris Pine attempts to be the biggest womanizer he possibly can, they still manage to squeeze in Tom Hardy being a complete bad ass. The paintball scene is one of the highlights, but the most original aspect of the movie comes in one of the first (of many) dates Tuck has with Lauren. He takes her to a carnival and at the end of it takes her on the trapeze. It's actually really cool and would be a really fun first date for anyone.This Means War is a frustrating and awful excuse for entertainment.

Then the two agents, best mates, start dating the same girl. Hilarity ensues, along side some mighty fun action and some great film gags. Everyone on screen is, simply put, perfect in creating an absurdly and hardly plausible plot... and it's great!The special features are fun: a great uncensored gag reel, some opening previs work, commentary (which is quite fun, too), and for the main course - the Alternate Endings.

Based on a story by Timothy Dowling who with Simon Kinberg and Marcus Gautesen adapted it for the screen, the film in many ways seems like a parody of several film types - chick flick, espionage capers, buddy movies, and relationship studies.  The fact that it throws these ideas all into one mixing bowl and comes out not only making sense but having fun doing so makes it well worth watching,Two best friend CIA agents - FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) - find themselves in competition for the affections of the same beautiful woman, Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), an attractive but chronically unattached product testor and facilitator for focus groups whose best friend Trish (the brilliantly funny Chelsea Handler) constantly urges Lauren to date - even if on the internet. FDR and Tuck are accustomed to using whatever means necessary to complete a mission, a trait that mentality has a tendency to enter into their personal lives and when they discover Lauren's dating blog (create by Trish), they're both on it. They enter into a gentleman's agreement that stipulates they not interfere with one other, allow Lauren to choose the best man for her, and walk away from Lauren if seeing her begins to affect the men's friendship. The agreement quickly degenerates into a one-ups-man-ship contest of epic proportions thanks to the men's competitive natures and the arsenal of government resources at their disposal. Oblivious to the rivalry and the high-tech circus going on around her, Lauren desperately tries to figure out which of the two men is right for her. The behavior patterns of FDR and Tuck help make the decision - that, and the fact that Tuck has a son by a girl he cannot forget, Katie (Abigail Spencer).This is a non-stop action film filled with moments of tenderness and hilarity and espionage tactics gone awry. The superb trio of actors is supported by Angela Bassett (don't blink or you'll miss her), Til Schweiger as the bad guy on a mission against CIA, and Rosemary Harris. In the end it is all fun and laughs and solid movie making.

CIA agents against German bad guys (later associated with Serb bad guy). Germans as bad guys? Where have the writers been these past decades?(2.) CIA agents have their usual gruff, antagonistic boss; get in shoot out (massive bullets flying everywhere) with the usual, soon to be dead, half dozen bad guys at a big party (without bystanders getting hit); usual slide and shoot or roll and shoot, etc. scenes; usual helicopter on roof top (to save filming costs it just sits there); usual one bad guy escapes with usual paragliding chute; usual someone falls off of roof edge only to last second grab the edge by fingertips (not as good as Cruz in Mission ...) which incidentally is impossible - try it, but close to the ground; usual divorced dad with non-connecting son and ex-wife.(3.) The main hook is that the two CIA guys are on the look-out for females and happen to connect with the same one thus the comedic part except that the script and dialogue were so juvenile Hollywood dumb speak that I was asking myself ""Who in the world is the target audience?"" Was it the rom-com females or the action males? Could it be both?  We all know what happens to a meal recipe that is cooked to please everyone. It turns out to be mush for everyone.(4.) Usual satellite with HUD identifier info overlay on important locations e.g. CIA headquarters. Thank you Google Earth! Overdone and cheap looking.(5.) Online dating was added to contemporize the movie for whatever age group that is still enamored by the idea. Largely a LA/NY writer's thing.(6.) Poor acting, filming and directing resulting in Pine, Hardy, Handler and especially Witherspoon stuck in predictable acting role ruts. Can they do anything else? Camera angles made car chase scenes look more like what was being done in the '70s and fight scenes that were obviously fakey with punches not even close to their target.(7.) Good movies attend to detail yet, just one example, look at the final scene of the SUV rolling on the overpass then check out the shadows of the SUV, the people and the other vehicle.

1465990,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAIGXW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[11, 17]","That plenty of folks are slamming the kabonkers out of this film reinforces that old saw about how mileage may vary, how people's tastes tend to blanket the spectrum. I happen to like THIS MEANS WAR and, to go by how the theater audience kept erupting in chuckles, I have got like-minded peeps out there.Given, the premise is ridiculous. The plot is pure escapism. And the writer(s) doesn't really dedicate much thought into the espionage stuff. Til Schweiger plays the menacing but ill-defined international big bad, except that he's pretty much an afterthought. And a plot advancer.Whether or not you enjoy the movie will depend on how much you like the three leads. Me, I relish the hell out of all three. They make the film watchable and fun. Because of their appeal, the comedy bits and the romantic bits work for me. The plot ventures another case of a woman getting in the way of a perfectly fine bromance. FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy), an English gent, are CIA operatives who happen to be best friends. FDR, cool and refined, and Tuck, not as cool or refined, would take a bullet for each other. When they discover that they're dating the same woman, they even shake on a gentleman's agreement. Should romantic developments threaten their friendship, they agree to walk away from the woman.Except it's hard to walk away from Reese Witherspoon. She plays Lauren Scott, a lead product evaluator for a consumer research company. Lauren is expert with charts and numbers but unlucky in love. When prodded to go play the field by her married best friend (a raunchy Chelsea Handler whose dialogue had to be toned down for the film to earn a PG-13 rating), Lauren protests and breaks down the hazards of going out on a blind date (such as ending up in the trunk of a car or being carved into a skin suit by some maniac). The next day Lauren is horrified to learn that her best friend had put up a provocative profile of her on an online dating service.It's amusing to me that Tuck's being an Englishman works against his favor; it's usually not like that. His British descent is actually what Lauren singles out when she lists his faults to her B.F.F. (this fault becomes a running joke, as does FDR's own shortcoming). Tuck is more reserved than FDR (who is an unrepentant womanizer), and it's Tom Hardy's performance that grounds the film for whatever stretch the film is grounded. How can you not feel for a bloke what dotes on his young son and (at least in the film's beginning) pines for his ex-wife? As for Chris Pine, sorry but I've already pigeonholed him as the new Captain Kirk, and I can't help but note the Kirkness trying to emerge even in this secret agent role. Mind you, I find it all very entertaining.Much of the film centers around Lauren's progressive dates with both gentlemen, and how Tuck and FDR gradually escalate their rivalry even as their friendship crumbles. The spy versus spy stuff gets a real working over as the two spooks keep one-upping and sabotaging each other. I did think that the sprinklers gambit and the trank dart (both shown in the trailer) were played out. If this were real life, I'd be horrified with their misappropriation of CIA personnel and their rampant misuse of hi-tech CIA surveillance equipment, all to keep tabs on Lauren and unearth her innermost secrets. And for experienced CIA agents, Tuck and FDR aren't that keen to keep things on the covert. That gentleman's agreement lasted all of not a hell of a long time.But this is escapism in cinema, and so I brushed off them nagging impressions. THIS MEANS WAR succeeds on the strength of Hardy, Pine, and Witherspoon, all three of whom I thought worked with terrific chemistry in whatever combination the story threw them in. If you liked TRUE LIES and MR. & MRS. SMITH, THIS MEANS WAR shares that same spirit and sensibility, although the action sequences, unfortunately, tend to fall along the more generic lines. But I was reeled in by the romantic beats.

There's some B plot about a terrorist-slash-bad guy after them that wouldn't even pass for a filler episode of CSI. The script borrows heavily from True Lies but fails to copy the good parts that make it work, leaving us with a film that lurches violently from shooting five guys at point blank range to soppy scenes with The Witherspoon. In the midst of this, her character spends the entire film pondering the dilemma of dating two guys while her exposition sidekick Chelsea Handler gives her someone to talk to.Anyone who really works for the CIA must roll their eyes when they see poorly researched and frankly unbelievable nonsense like this. If you think the Secret Service's call girl incident in Colombia was bad, a single day in McG's intelligence agency involves wiretapping people you date, starting shootouts in Hong Kong and basically doing anything but your job (all Angela Bassett's watch, too). It makes John McClane look like a real-life cop.None of this would really matter if the characters were engaging and it was fun - but given the quality of actors here, they all phone it in and the level of chemistry is pretty low.

First off, it's got Reese Witherspoon, who I can't stand.  She's annoying, smarmy and unattractive.  Second, it's directed by McG, who for my tastes, misses in theaters (the Charlie's Angels series, Terminator Salvation).  That being said, I know McG has the potential to entertain me, having produced one of my favorite TV shows of all time, the guilty pleasure known as Fastlane.  My expectations were checked at the door.Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play off of each other quite well.  Tom Hardy I bought as a CIA agent, in terms of attitude and build.  Pine, not as much.  Reese Witherspoon is just kind of...there...as the love interest.  The story is fairly cookie-cutter like one may expect going in...two CIA agents accidentally kill a bad guy.  That bad guy's brother lives, and plots revenge.  In the meantime, the two CIA agents start dating the same girl, causing friction in their relationship.  The story is nothing new, but is adequate.They are marketing this movie as an action/romantic comedy.  The action in the movie is done very poorly - mostly quick cuts and off screen bullet wounds (for examples of how action scenes should be shot, see Haywire).  The action set pieces are few and short.  There are a few laughs, although the severely over the top character Chelsea Handler plays gets old quick.  The ending of the movie is quite ridiculous, and makes little sense...sadly, I saw what was going to happen about a mile away, so if you see a lot of movies, you can see where the movie is heading.I don't regret seeing this movie, but I probably won't watch it again.

Lucky Reese Witherspoon, to be one-third of an eternal triangle with these guys!Director McG (""Terminator Salvation,"" and ""Chuck"") certainly knows how to open a film with a bang and never slow down. Even though this is a romantic comedy, CIA activities and skirmishes are couched in enough reality that we invest a little skin in the game. But the banter and camaraderie between two hunky heroes keep it cartoony and light. Furthermore, the conversations between our heroine and her best friend are hilarious, particularly when they are being overheard by the guys.* Reese Witherspoon (""Water for Elephants"") tests products and facilitates focus groups, but she hasn't quite recovered from her last break-up. Her best friend offers sage advice that positively drips with envy.* Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") is the smooth man about town, a CIA-trained lady killer with blue eyes you could get lost in. Problem is, Reese isn't about to fall. She may be tempted, but she won't fall. ...maybe....oops....* Tom Hardy (""Inception"") is the third side of this triangle, who pretends to be a travel agent, which contributed to the end of his marriage. Now he's competing with Chris Pine for Reese's affections and not doing too badly, either, despite being British...* Chelsea Handler (lots of TV) is the best friend who keeps offering Reese all that bad, bad advice. She's so funny I'd probably try her suggestions, too! Hey, don't Volkswagens have air bags?Once again we are confronted with a PG-13 film that is fairly anatomical, but it's so funny I guess I'll forgive them. The clever script is loaded with double entendres that had us laughing out loud (""the agent has entered the premises""). To watch Hollywood's version of the high-tech power the CIA can bring into this testosterone-laden rivalry is really fun! Plus, I've never seen Ms. Witherspoon so relaxed or funny before.Expect no sweaty bodies, a snippet of profanity, lots of gunfire, some bloody fisticuffs, a bit of exciting vehicular mayhem, and even some blowie uppie stuff.

If C.I.A agents are this self-centered and immature in real life, I'm scared. Their characters use everything the C.I.A has to offer to woo Reese Witherspoon's character and also spy on her. While her character is a two timing hussy who has no problem dating both men at once.The characters aren't likeable, the action is clumsy and the film is full of romantic comedy cliches. Here's a lesson for Hardy and Pine, if you can work with Nolan and J.J Abraham's, you can say no to doing a McG (Charlie's Angels) film! While someone as hot as Witherspoon is only on a dating site if it's a fake profile! Witherspoon as a woman desperate to impress her ex, Reese, desperate, really? ?While Hardy is a little more likable since he wants to meet someone since his divorce. Pine just doesn't deserve to win Witherspoone's heart since he has more luck with women and is a self -centered jerk. He should be a good friend and just step aside but his ego is too big.A action/romantic/comedy for Valentine's Day is a nice change but not when it's lazy and not much different than any other bad romantic comedy.

1466014,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B005LAIGXW,John's Horror Corner,"[1, 1]","A romantic comedy with an action-backdrop.  It's been done before, but in the past and limited by smaller budgets and less easily achievable CGI technology.  This little date night charmer comes complete with serviceable (but admittedly, and hopefully intentionally, stupid) action--great, in fact, for a RomCom--and a good buddy dynamic between our two best friend spy-by-trade male leads:  The ever-shallow ladies' man, FDR (Chris Pine; Bottle Shock, Star Trek, Unstoppable), and the more soulful and soul-mate-y, Tuck (Tom Hardy; Inception, Warrior, Dark Knight Rises).  Both actors have proven their worth with a recent flurry of genre admixture.  Then, of course there's Lauren (Reese Witherspoon;  Water for Elephants, How Do You Know), an overly sharp, generally adorable, successful Consumer Report analyst who can't seem to find a date even though she has a great attitude and takes care of herself--oh, and she's as cute as Reese Witherspoon.  Don't find it plausible?  Don't care?  The flick simply works in its own silly way and Chelsea Handler is fantastically funny as Witherspoon's sister.The flick kicks off when Tuck and Lauren meet via ItsFate.com for their first date.  It's rather abbreviated, but quite sweet.  Shortly after, FDR bumps into Lauren, fancies her and has a womanizer meets girl-power innuendo battle which culminates in an invasion of her workplace until she agrees to a date.  Tuck and FDR find out the very next day that they like the same girl.  Neither is willing to back down so it is suggested they compete to win her affection.  And, with two newly adversely-faced best friends vying for the same woman, we found the title of this movie: This Means War!Tuck and FDR's friend dynamic is great.  It starts with the nave gentleman's agreement that if their competition over Laura affects their friendship then they both would stop pursuing her--as if!  They get together for Chips marathons and work together and really know little more than the other has to teach.  During their bro-romantic feud they both abuse their surveillance and super-spy gadgetry privileges at work.  This likely cost a lot of tax-payer dollars.Their recon leads them to all of her childhood fantasies and...some unreasonable adult fantasies as well.  Of course, being overpaid fantasy-movie spies, they make them happen with no problem while competing for her affection.  When it comes to using CIA ear-pieces (inciting the Patriot Act, for God's sake) to have their subordinates aid them, and the sabotage thereof, it got truly wonderful.  Seeing FDR try to narrate art history while Tuck listened and chimed in to distract him...simply priceless.  Overhearing their own flaws and watching themselves overcompensate on surveillance footage is nothing if not enjoyable.  To win her over they adopt milky-eyed, venerable dogs and paintball preteens into post-traumatic-stress-disorder to make up for their perceived flaws.  Thank you, Chelsea Handler, for helping to make that happen.  Handler brings up sex at the most inappropriate times and I dare not ruin how.No matter what the conflict, these brothers in arms returned to each other as besties.  The happy endings number more than one and will leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy in the standardly lame ways.  FYI, the ending is glorious!Favorite Quotes, all from Chelsea Handler except one:""Stop referring to Boggle like it's a man.  You sound like a woman who has nine cats and knits her ass off.""""You know when you know you're going to have dirty sex and it's gonna' stink?  Not like sex.  I mean like man stink, the good stuff.""""Do you think Gloria Steinham got arrested and sat in a jail cell so you could act like a little bitch?  I don't think so!""""You're not going to Hell.

She wants to get off the site but sees a guy on there that she thinks is good looking.  The guy works for the government.  Him and his friend go around taking out bad guys and saving the world.  So, the guy tells his friend he joined the site and is going on a date.  His friend and him decide that they will both go so the other can be his wing man.  But, his friend starts liking the girl as well.  Which one will be able to get the girl in the end?That's it, the entire store.  Now I know that most stories sound simple but have things from A - B that make you interested.  This is not one of those movies.  These guys have very important jobs in the government, yet they act like two children when it comes to this girl.  The one does not date much, but the other says he always has dates.  So why then is he so dispirit?  They decide they will both date her and let her choose.  They set ground rules.  The use government equipment and men to help spy.  One scene has one of the guys following the other with one of those drone things that fly's in the air.  The other guy (while in the passenger seat of a moving car) pulls out his gun and shoots down the drone.  Ok, how much do those things cost?  Are you telling me the guy can just shoot one down and get in no trouble?  In another scene the guy throws a knife directly at his friends head.  Nothing seemed real during this movie.  These guys would have gotten in so much trouble for doing any of the number of things they did.  Another thing that bothered me and my mom as well, there were never any other people in the office with the two guys.  There were desks, but not one other soul.It was such a dumb movie.

But the writing and acting in this is so hokey that I was cringing and eye-rolling a lot. My husband could barely stand it. The plot basically centers on two CIA agents who are best friends but both fall for Reese's character and end up competing for her. Maybe if they had made it more campy, like a Men in Black type thing, it would have worked. But it never seems to settle into one genre or tone - in some places it seem to be going for heartfelt romantic comedy, in other places it is slapstick, and then in still other sections it is full on action movie. Most of the time it is just BAD.Reese is charming enough, but there's not a lot of chemistry between her and either of the two male leads, so I wasn't really rooting for her to end up with either of them. I'm not sure how this ever looked good to her on paper, but maybe the original script worked better than what ended up here. Chelsea Handler has some funny moments, but adds to the oddness in tone.

1466038,AX9C10JD538D9,B005LAIGXW,Liviania,"[0, 0]","I wanted to see This Means War as soon as I saw the trailer.  I think Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hardy, and Chris Pine are all terrific actors.  I like spies and things blowing up, so those seemed liked great elements to liven up a romantic comedy.  The critics hated it, but I can't think of a single critic partial to rom coms.  Thus, I checked This Means War out once my local Redbox had a copy.Witherspoon is terrific as Lauren, a successful products tester (think Consumer Reports), who gets signed up for a dating website by her married friend.  Her first date is with Tuck (Hardy), a good-looking, charming Englishman.  After her date, she runs into FDR (Pine), and is unimpressed by his womanizing ways, but he wheedles a date out of her anyway.  Of course, the two men aren't a travel agent and boat captain like they claim - they're longtime partners in the CIA and willing to spy on each other and Lauren in order to get the girl.I thought This Means War was pretty funny, although I wasn't entirely on board with the ending.  It was pretty obvious which guy Lauren would pick, although I thought the other guy was a better choice for her.  (It's obvious because Hollywood has this thing about reuniting divorced couples.  In real life, most divorced people I know prefer to spend as little time as possible with their former partner.)Genre-wise, those hoping for a true melding of action movie and rom com will probably be disappointed.  The action is limited to the cold open and the climax.  Unless you count goofy spy antics as action.  I put those under the comedy half of the rom com label.  The couple of action scenes are pretty cool and I liked that Lauren's knowledge from her job was key to saving the day.  (If the men spying on the woman is a little uncomfortable, at least Lauren is never expected to give up her career, friends, or other interests for a relationship.)This Means War is a perfectly serviceable rom com, though it's no classic of the genre like Witherspoon's career-making Legally Blonde.  The material might be thin but the charismatic and attractive cast is more than game.  While rated PG-13, This Means War falls on the raunchy side.  Mostly verbal jokes, but there are definitely some references parents probably don't want to explain to younger teens.",4,Fun rom com with a bit of action,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2294,"['wanted', 'see', 'Means', 'War', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'trailer', 'think', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'are', 'terrific', 'actors', 'spies', 'things', 'blowing', 'up', 'seemed', 'liked', 'great', 'elements', 'liven', 'up', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'critics', 'hated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'critic', 'partial', 'rom', 'coms', 'Thus', 'checked', 'Means', 'War', 'once', 'local', 'Redbox', 'had', 'copy.Witherspoon', 'terrific', 'Lauren', 'successful', 'products', 'tester', 'think', 'Consumer', 'Reports', 'who', 'signed', 'up', 'dating', 'website', 'married', 'friend', 'first', 'date', 'Tuck', 'Hardy', 'good-looking', 'charming', 'Englishman', 'date', 'FDR', 'Pine', 'unimpressed', 'womanizing', 'ways', 'date', 'anyway', 'course', 'two', 'men', 'are', ""n't"", 'travel', 'agent', 'boat', 'captain', 'claim', ""'re"", 'longtime', 'partners', 'CIA', 'willing', 'spy', 'other', 'Lauren', 'order', 'get', 'girl.I', 'thought', 'Means', 'War', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'board', 'ending', 'was', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'guy', 'Lauren', 'would', 'pick', 'thought', 'other', 'guy', 'was', 'better', 'choice', 'obvious', 'Hollywood', 'thing', 'reuniting', 'divorced', 'couples', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'divorced', 'people', 'know', 'prefer', 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'possible', 'former', 'partner', 'Genre-wise', 'hoping', 'true', 'melding', 'action', 'movie', 'rom', 'com', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'action', 'limited', 'cold', 'open', 'climax', 'count', 'goofy', 'spy', 'antics', 'action', 'put', 'comedy', 'half', 'rom', 'com', 'label', 'couple', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'liked', 'Lauren', 'knowledge', 'job', 'was', 'key', 'saving', 'day', 'men', 'spying', 'woman', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'least', 'Lauren', 'never', 'expected', 'give', 'up', 'career', 'friends', 'other', 'interests', 'relationship', 'Means', 'War', 'perfectly', 'serviceable', 'rom', 'com', 'classic', 'genre', 'Witherspoon', 'career-making', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'material', 'might', 'be', 'thin', 'charismatic', 'attractive', 'cast', 'more', 'game', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Means', 'War', 'raunchy', 'side', 'Mostly', 'verbal', 'jokes', 'are', 'definitely', 'references', 'parents', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'explain', 'younger', 'teens']",N/A

The storyline was not original and some of it just didn't feel realistic to me but the characters, mainly the two girls were fun to watch. I loved the unique things she did on her dates. On one of the outings she went to a darkly dim lit private room with a trapeze. They played together for hours, swinging back and forth, falling laughing to the twined ropes below. On another date, she is a child with her date and his little boy at her job where She reviews products. She got out the toys, a popcorn maker where the corn just blew all over the room, squirt guns with water, spraying each other and having laughing good times. On another date she did a paintball adventure, they set it up like it was a real combat and they had to take the other side over. She had fun with her friend who didn't hide anything, she was very honest, yet that loving nurturing was not present in this film. So it was cool real, if that makes sense. I liked when Resse and her friend sat on the floor at this restaurant and the cushions were all over, they just talked and talked. I liked when she raced the classic car around the countryside. I liked when she was in a house with music that was loud and sexy, she made her popcorn and relaxed. I think that Reese's character seemed free, she sang in the city with all the people, headphones on, she didn't care about being herself. I love Gustav Klint paintings as well, so it was fun to watch such an original date. It is another neat excursion when you go to stay the weekend at an alpaca farm drinking the fresh milk eating cheese and watching the clouds scud in the sky, where birds and larks sing.

I give a lot of grace to rom coms, and don't think there's a thing wrong with escapism, but this movie failed to reach even my two-star minimum standards.

I can't believe the obnoxious characters who pass for friends in quite a few movies lately, and they don't even make me laugh.  As they say, With friends like that....And just to compare to another romance/action movie I did enjoy, take a look at Knight and Day.

1466043,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B005LAIGXW,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[4, 8]","MOVIE REVIEW #24: "" This Means War""Here is a fun and funny movie that not only had humor and action adventure but a true thread of realism between the characters. Chris Pine (Star Trek 2009, Unstoppable) and Tom Hardy (Star Trek: Nemesis, Inception) are a pair of FBI agents who accidentally start dating the same girl. Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blonde, Walk The Line) has the awkward position of dating two men who she has no idea that they know each other.What's the foil? Since both Chris and Tom work for the FBI so they have all kinds of electronic surveillance equipment at their access and quite by accident they realize they are dating the same girls. Now they make a gentlman's agreement to let the best man win - but it becomes far more competitive and actually very funny. No to mention the added intrigue of an international killer trying to kill them both.Reese has a best friend played by Chelsea Handler (Chelsea Latley, Reno 911) why hysterically guides her on her various dates with each men. The two of them discuss each date and plot the next one with hysterical commentary of each man.The movie was directed by McG (Charlie's Angels, Terminator Salvation) and it contains tight action scenes, funny dialogue and a great three-way between all of them. The bad-guy is just a small motivator to the story, but the heart is in the characters,The movie has a lot of action, fast cars, gadgets and a real heart! You understand what each character is doing, thinking and feeling and in the end - a very believable and perfect resolution is made. All within the context of being targeted by an international killer played by Til Schwieger (New Year's Eve).This was an extremely entertaining film for its genre and Reese, Chris and Tom are great on sreen together. The script has a lot of twists and surprises and the direction is sharp and tight. Fresh entertainment .

1466049,A2GL71JNGTB5TU,B005LAIGXW,"Margo ""classics lover""","[14, 19]","Let me say first that I agree with a lot of what the other reviewers have said both good and bad. The audience was quite happy with this movie, and it made for a nice date. It's a piece of fluff -- but it's bad fluff. Now, wait, I was going to give the good parts first.  Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy.  Some funny bits, like the paintball scene, the way each guy spoils the other's dates.  That's about it.  I'd add Chelsea Handler for a couple of funny remarks, but I really don't see what she's doing in the movie. Uh, and the cinematography is often very good. That's about it.The bad parts are really, really bad. For the romcom format, this is a disaster. There is no chemistry between Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon. I mean, when McG has to mount a kitchen counter to show Pine and Witherspoon how to do foreplay, you know there's a problem. There is no chemistry between Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon, either. Uh, I forgot another good thing: the chemistry between Pine and Hardy is great; they play off of each other (think Eames and Arthur in Inception)with genuine comedic talent. Which is surprising given their out of the box casting. I'd read that both men wanted to add some fluff to their resumes but they're wasted here. What they need is a vehicle that has a good script and a good director. Reese Witherspoon did the Oscar-winning June Carter Cash role years ago, and the Legally Blonde thing even longer than that. McG says she wanted to show off her sexy side here. That may have something to do with the zero chemistry thing. Plot problems: the premise is weak. Two incompetent covert-operations agents have been grounded, and so they play around with surf-dating. Would you believe -- they both fall for the same woman! Complication: they are closer than brothers, than partners, they ""would take a bullet"" for each other. However, when the time comes to test this bond, the men become twelve-year-olds and begin a series of gotcha/gotcha-back stunts. The plot has a lot of holes in it. What's Chelsea Handler doing in the movie? She provides nothing to fill out Witherspoon's character or to move the plot forward. She's given some witty impromptu lines. What's the bad-guy thing doing here? It's superfluous and badly done. The action scenes could certainly work with the stunts the two agents pull. And why is Angela Bassett in this movie? OMG The amount of wasted talent is humongous. McG's direction is, is, invisible. There is no direction here. All three of the actors try to build something with Legos, but McG insists on tearing it down.  As a director, he shoots good videos.Now for the worst criminal of all for the movie: the screenwriter(s). Let me start with the story's ending. It's ridiculous. ""Don't choose the better man,"" Handler tells her, ""choose the man who will make you better."" Is she kidding? Reese does choose one of the men, but lest the audience feel cheated for the fate of the other -- kind of ruining the romcom's happy, satisfying ending-- he is given something to look forward to without Reese. I'd say he's the guy who really wins the ""war."" I read an interview where Hardy and Pine suggest writing an ending which would have been far more satisfying, not to say really funny, but McG nixed it. He did say, though, that there would be an alternate ending on the dvd. If the dvd sells for three bucks, I'll buy it for that. (And Tom Hardy. Did I mention him?)  Oh, this is supposed to be the bad stuff. The screenwriter(s) must have been on crack. Or were paid two bucks a page. Will Smith and Reese produced this, and you'd think they'd have burned the script after reading it. Witherspoon has mentioned that when she thought one or another of the scenes ""wasn't working,"" she'd change it. I mean, she admitted that. Whoa. The dialogue is not good enough to be called cliched. It's embarrassing. Since its release, both Pine and Hardy have had the charity to damn it with faint praise. Good for them. There is no cohesive story; the plot is choppy and some scenes gratuitous. It's like a string of miscellaneous scenes that someone forgot to edit.Verdict: So-freaking-so. Have a couple of drinks before seeing this. Suspend all disbelief. Do not expect a good romcom. Do not expect comedic performances. Think back to your high-school days and the people you knew then, the popular girl, the sweet nerd, the jock, in an impossible triangle. Did you like them then?  You won't like them now, either. Save your money instead of seeing this on the big screen. Rent the dvd, pop some corn, cuddle up on the sofa, and enjoy the fluff. Just don't expect it to be good fluff. In the meantime, rent a good Hepburn-Tracy movie if you want an intelligent romcom -- and a really funny one.",2,This Means War Doesn't  (Spoilers),1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,4731,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'agree', 'lot', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'good', 'bad', 'audience', 'was', 'quite', 'happy', 'movie', 'made', 'nice', 'date', 'piece', 'fluff', 'bad', 'fluff', 'Now', 'wait', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'good', 'parts', 'first', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'funny', 'bits', 'paintball', 'scene', 'way', 'guy', 'other', 'dates', ""'d"", 'add', 'Chelsea', 'Handler', 'couple', 'funny', 'remarks', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'movie', 'Uh', 'cinematography', 'often', 'very', 'good', 'it.The', 'bad', 'parts', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'romcom', 'format', 'disaster', 'chemistry', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'mean', 'when', 'McG', 'mount', 'kitchen', 'counter', 'show', 'Pine', 'Witherspoon', 'how', 'do', 'foreplay', 'know', 'problem', 'chemistry', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'either', 'Uh', 'forgot', 'good', 'thing', 'chemistry', 'Pine', 'Hardy', 'great', 'play', 'other', 'think', 'Eames', 'Arthur', 'Inception', 'genuine', 'comedic', 'talent', 'Which', 'surprising', 'given', 'box', 'casting', ""'d"", 'read', 'men', 'wanted', 'add', 'fluff', 'resumes', ""'re"", 'wasted', 'here', 'What', 'need', 'vehicle', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'director', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'did', 'Oscar-winning', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'role', 'years', 'ago', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'thing', 'even', 'longer', 'McG', 'wanted', 'show', 'off', 'sexy', 'side', 'here', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'thing', 'Plot', 'problems', 'premise', 'weak', 'Two', 'incompetent', 'covert-operations', 'agents', 'have', 'been', 'grounded', 'so', 'play', 'surf-dating', 'Would', 'believe', 'fall', 'same', 'woman', 'Complication', 'are', 'closer', 'brothers', 'partners', 'would', 'take', 'bullet', 'other', 'However', 'when', 'time', 'test', 'bond', 'men', 'become', 'twelve-year-olds', 'begin', 'series', 'gotcha/gotcha-back', 'stunts', 'plot', 'lot', 'holes', 'What', 'Chelsea', 'Handler', 'doing', 'movie', 'nothing', 'fill', 'out', 'Witherspoon', 'character', 'move', 'plot', 'forward', 'given', 'witty', 'impromptu', 'lines', 'What', 'bad-guy', 'thing', 'doing', 'here', 'superfluous', 'badly', 'done', 'action', 'scenes', 'could', 'certainly', 'work', 'stunts', 'two', 'agents', 'pull', 'why', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'movie', 'amount', 'wasted', 'talent', 'humongous', 'McG', 'direction', 'invisible', 'direction', 'here', 'three', 'actors', 'try', 'build', 'something', 'Legos', 'McG', 'tearing', 'down', 'director', 'shoots', 'good', 'videos.Now', 'worst', 'criminal', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 's', 'Let', 'start', 'story', 'ending', 'ridiculous', 'Do', ""n't"", 'choose', 'better', 'man', 'Handler', 'choose', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'better', 'kidding', 'Reese', 'choose', 'one', 'men', 'lest', 'audience', 'feel', 'cheated', 'fate', 'other', 'kind', 'ruining', 'romcom', 'happy', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'given', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'Reese', ""'d"", 'say', 'guy', 'who', 'really', 'war', 'read', 'interview', 'where', 'Hardy', 'Pine', 'suggest', 'writing', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'not', 'say', 'really', 'funny', 'McG', 'nixed', 'did', 'say', 'though', 'would', 'be', 'alternate', 'ending', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'three', 'bucks', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Did', 'mention', 'Oh', 'supposed', 'be', 'bad', 'stuff', 'screenwriter', 's', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'crack', 'were', 'paid', 'two', 'bucks', 'page', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Reese', 'produced', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'burned', 'script', 'reading', 'Witherspoon', 'mentioned', 'when', 'thought', 'one', 'scenes', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', ""'d"", 'change', 'mean', 'admitted', 'Whoa', 'dialogue', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'called', 'cliched', 'embarrassing', 'release', 'Pine', 'Hardy', 'have', 'had', 'charity', 'damn', 'faint', 'praise', 'Good', 'cohesive', 'story', 'plot', 'choppy', 'scenes', 'gratuitous', 'string', 'miscellaneous', 'scenes', 'someone', 'forgot', 'edit.Verdict', 'So-freaking-so', 'Have', 'couple', 'drinks', 'seeing', 'Suspend', 'disbelief', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'good', 'romcom', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'comedic', 'performances', 'Think', 'back', 'high-school', 'days', 'people', 'knew', 'then', 'popular', 'girl', 'sweet', 'nerd', 'jock', 'impossible', 'triangle', 'Did', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'now', 'either', 'Save', 'money', 'instead', 'seeing', 'big', 'screen', 'Rent', 'dvd', 'pop', 'corn', 'cuddle', 'up', 'sofa', 'enjoy', 'fluff', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'good', 'fluff', 'meantime', 'rent', 'good', 'Hepburn-Tracy', 'movie', 'want', 'intelligent', 'romcom', 'really', 'funny', 'one']",N/A

He practically begs his best friend, Tuck, to let him shadow his first date with Lauren (Reese)- I kept thinking, ""Dude, get a life!"" - and then he behaves like an arrogant a** when he, by chance, meets Lauren at a video store. Lauren shuts him down, which I applauded but he keeps coming back. He gets even more stalkerish by bugging her home and following her on her dates with Tuck. The biggest thing was that he completely lies to her and says he is in to her favorite artist while getting lines fed to him through an earpiece; he lies about volunteering at an animal shelter and loving kids etc. So, basically, he makes up a person that he thinks she would like and, guess what, she falls for it!Now, Tuck is pretty stalkerish too, but at least he makes a real attempt to be genuine when around her. He takes her on fun, interesting dates, introduces her to his son, and just seems a lot more honest compared to FDR. But Lauren thinks he's boring.Guess who gets the girl in the end...The only reason I gave this 2 stars was for the scenes with Lauren and her best friend, which were pretty funny and the scenes of Tuck and Lauren's dates.

But there are many that fall into the category of fun movies that offer no redeeming value whatsoever and yet are filled with fun and energy. THIS IS WAR is one of those movies, a film that's fun to watch and may be worth watching again and yet it offers no social redeeming value. So what? It's a movie kids!FDR Foster (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) are two CIA agents for whom action comes easily. Both are experts in their field and the best agents around. They're also best friends. When an operation goes from covert to public awareness, the duo finds themselves behind desks at the home office in LA.FDR is a ladies man, always on the prowl. Tuck is more subtle with a failed marriage and young son he adores. When they find themselves stuck at home, Tuck decides its time to find someone special and pops his info, or the info he creates, on to a dating web site. There he meets Lauren (Reese Witherspoon).Lauren is an up and coming single in LA as well. Her job has her testing products for a consumer group. Her long time girlfriend Trish (Chelsea Handler) feels that she needs to get out. To give her a nudge, she posts her name and info on the same couple's web site Tuck visits but with info that Lauren isn't quite happy with.Lauren and Tuck set up a meet but Tuck has FDR as back up, hanging out in a nearby video store. The meeting goes well and ends soon after they meet with the promise of a full fledged date to follow. On the way home, Lauren stops to rent a video at the same store FDR is at. With no clue who she is, he hits on her and through a series of circumstances gets her to go out with him. The result is two best friends dating the same girl with no clue until each shows the other of their latest love interest. What follows is a game of trying to one up each other to see who gets the girl.Using the resources of the CIA the duo spy on each other's dates as well as gain information on Lauren. Using that information they both treat her to some stupendous dates doing the things she likes. Things go so well that she has a hard time deciding just who she wants to be with.While all of this unsanctioned surveillance is going on, bad guy Heinrich (Til Schweiger) is trying to find Tuck and FDR. When that opening sequence to the film went bad, the pair had killed Heinrich's brother and he's now set on revenge. Tracking down the pair to LA you know it's just a matter of time before a face off results and the chances of Lauren being in the middle of things is pretty good.The movie follows the usual Hollywood pattern of mixing comedy and action with comedy being the main focus. The situations that the heroes put themselves in trying to impress this new woman in their lives make for some funny scenes. Each time she mentions something she likes or dislikes about them, they attempt to prove her wrong by either doing what she wants to overcoming the things she might dislike about them. All in all it makes for some funny moments.Best of all with this film is the ease that the characters and actors bring to the story. It never feels forced of fake even though being fake is what most of their actions involved. I've said before the proof of a good actor is to not feel like they're acting and all three here display that in spades.More than anything the movie is fun. It delivers the right combination of action, comedy and romance that create an enjoyable watching experience. I wasn't sure what to expect from the trailer for this film and actually thought it would be something light but more mediocre than it was.

They are CIA partners, you know that there is a brotherhood that only forms when you put your life in someone else hands. That relationship is put to the test when they both fall for the same woman ... in walks femme fatal, Reese Witherspoon whose character contains that charm which has made Reese a mainstay in cinema.The plot is a road-map that lists all the main attractions along the way. You know where it's going, everyone's been there before, yet you still have fun. This movie is above all else a romantic comedy.

Tuck, a single dad is interested in falling in love again.  Lauren (Reese) is funny as a consumer product evaluator.  Her friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) makes her a dating profile on an online service to help her get back into the dating pool.  When Lauren and Tuck go on a date, on the same day, she runs into FDR who not only manages to piss her off but talks her into going on a date.  Both men are dynamic and interesting and both are go out of their way to find out what Lauren likes to one up the other by using all their resources at the agency including being able to track each other as they are on a date with her.I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would and here's why:1) Great movie for couples because it is nicely balanced with action and romance in a way that really works.2) Chelsea Handler is too funny. Wish she was in it more. It is the perfect role for her as Lauren (Reese's best friend). She is witty and deadpan. ""Oh no! I'm Yoko!"" and ""Do it for all the woman who have to have sex with the same guy every Wednesday night at 9:00 PM while eating Cheetos."" Bwahahah hysterical.4) Tons of action, explosions, gun fights, fist fights, jumping off buildings, car crashes and more.

With 3 fine actors and one great comedienne in the cast what could go wrong?  Well, a script to begin with.  A comparatively thin and smallish looking Tom Hardy (""Lawless"") and Chris Pine (""Unstoppable"") are 2 CIA agents who are temporarily put on desk assignment due to their perceived missteps on their last assignment.In addition to being partners they are also best friends.  FDR (Pine) is the ladies man whose cover is a cruise ship captain.  Tuck (Hardy) is a divorcee with a 7 year old son, looking for a relationship.  Through a series of unlikely circumstances they both zero in on Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) who tests products on a local TV show.  She evidently is having a hard time getting back in circulation after a breakup.  Her best friend (and the best thing in the movie) is played with relish by Chelsea Handler.In addition to a ridiculous script where each guy has a team of coworkers inside the agency that break all kinds of rules, regulations and laws, the movie is subject to poor editing.  The sets look pretty cool.  In fact, too cool.  I noticed some snazzy blue lights showing up in places where they shouldn't, like toasters and other appliances.  In the opening sequence the evidence of a green screen is so evident it could be used for how not to use a green screen in film class.Poor Angela Bassett is along for the ride as the guys' boss.  She doesn't do much other than bark at them once in a while.  There's a secondary plot about some nefarious type who's out for revenge because Tuck and FDR killed his brother.  This allows for the traditional car chase in the last act.  Most film watchers should be able to predict what's going to happen after the first 5-10 minutes of this movie.The Blu ray disc gives an excellent transfer.  The usual 1080p format shows a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The colors seem unusually vibrant so if you like blue and chrome you'll like the picture.

1466088,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B005LAIGXW,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[4, 7]","Overall this movie is enjoyable if you go in with the proper expectations. It's pretty obvious from the previews that this is a concept film. They have a fun concept with potential and make most of the movie about that. It isn't about well developed characters, it isn't about a meticulously crafted story, it's about the concept and making it entertaining. If you go in expecting some entertainment, and some laughs, I say this film delivers. It was actually much better than I personally had expected.The first thing I attribute to raising this film going experience above my expectations was the casting. I knew Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hardy and Chris Pine were leads cast to bring some (varying levels) of star power. I didn't expect them to put as much effort into their characters as they did. Hardy has been a breakout star lately and he plays the heart of the film in many ways. It is his character that starts the events of the film when he desires a real relationship that might lead to a wife. He plays that classic kind of hopeless romantic character but in a way that feels real and makes it fun to root for him as the apparent underdog. Pine is also a recently rising name, he is perfect at playing an unattached male who suddenly feels as if he has found something new, if only by accident. He is so confident and amazingly able to do so without being a jerk, it becomes just as easy to root for him. On top of that Pine and Hardy have a great chemistry that I wasn't expecting. A real advantage of the film was that they didn't just say these guys were supposed to be buddies, they showed it. Hardy and Pine really play off of one another as buddies up front (something not seen in the previews) which makes their increasing rivalry much more compelling. It also turns some jokes that might otherwise only merit chuckles into full out laughs. This film took some time to set up the friendship but also the respective meetings of both guys with the girl, I at first thought it was a fairly pointless exercise, why not just get to the point as advertised, but I realized later that taking that time made the rest of the film more engaging.Witherspoon may be the most guilty of having an underdeveloped character, a fault of the script more than her own, but she does an excellent job at playing a woman who is very torn between these two men. This familiar situation works well here because she sees both men as being so different. Then there is Chelsea Handler who plays herself more or less, if you like her shtick you'll enjoy her here, if you don't she isn't a major role and plays more of a sounding board for Witherspoon.The action is the kind made on a B-movie budget aspiring to emulate an A-movie. That said, I was pleased with the action overall. There was some bad CGI but things moved at a good pace (a positive trait of the entire film), action came along at all the right times to break up the comedic sequences. Nothing new or revolutionary but some solid scenes that are fun and easy to follow. It's fun watching SPY VS. SPY when they actually attempt to give these guys all the abilities and resources a spy would have at their disposal. My favorite scene, I feel it to be a standout in regards to blending action/comedy, was a paintball sequence where Hardy tries to impress Witherspoon by taking down the whole battlefield single handed. Not only did the scene strike a good comedic balance it was fun to watch and well choreographed. There is a standard b story where a major league criminal of some kind wants revenge on the guys but it is only really there to give the film a fun preliminary action scene and an ending with some explosions and higher stakes.In the end it's not hard to figure out who she ends up with based on some early set up in the film but it's not about that. This movie is about getting out and having some laughs and fun without feeling like you're being ripped off or cheated, perhaps going on cheap night helped me in that regard, but I feel I'd still be content if I'd paid full price.

1466120,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B005LAIGXW,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 9]","I don't know why, but I am surprised by how sitcomy and amateurish ""This Means War"" is.Director McG is not known for particularly well-made or subtle films (""Charlie's Angels"", the sequel,  ""Terminator: Salvation""). But his films make a lot of money. And his name is on a number of fairly successful television shows. So he continues to work.FDR (Chris Pine, ""Star Trek"", ""Bottle Shock"") and Tuck (Tom Hardy, ""Inception"", ""Warrior"") are CIA Agents and best friends. Returning home to Los Angeles, Puck decides it is time to start testing the dating waters again because it is time to find someone and settle down; everytime he sees his ex-wife and son, loneliness hits him like a ton of bricks. He posts a profile on a dating website. Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), the head of a ""Consumer Reports""-like service also recognizes it is time to do something other than work. Her pushy, salacious sister Trish (Chelsea Handler) puts her profile online, against her knowledge. When Lauren finds out, anger gives way to curiosity when she spots Tuck's profile. Tuck gets nervous and asks FDR to tag along. He agrees to wait at a nearby video store, to provide an out if necessary. Lauren and Tuck meet at a nearby caf&eacute; and get along great before they decide to go on a second date. Lauren leaves, to find a video and spend the night alone. At the video store, FDR starts hitting on her, unaware she was Tuck's date. Before you can say ""meet-cute"", both friends realize they are dating the same woman and turn it into a competition, using their CIA resources to try to one-up the other. And a terrorist (Till Schweiger) also wants to extract his revenge.Written by a slew of people and directed by McG, ""This Means War"" is a silly, completely unbelievable and unromantic ""romantic comedy"".Nothing about ""War"" works like it is supposed to. The initial date between Puck and Lauren is sweet and seems like it could lead to something. But she ends the date, so she can rent a video and spend the evening alone. Huh? If I were on a first date that was going as well as this one seems to be going, the last thing I would do would be end the date so I can spend the evening alone.But this is, of course, a necessary plot contrivance designed to get her near FDR so he can spot her and they can begin flirting. They don't really seem to have any chemistry at first, but oddly, they agree to go on a date.There never really seem to be any moments of actual romance in ""War"". Both men begin eavesdropping on Lauren's life, with the aid of CIA resources and electronics, and begin using the information they gather to make them seem sweet and thoughtful and to make their buddy seem like a cad. FDR takes her to a warehouse to view original Gustav Klimt paintings. A nice, sweet idea, but he learned of her love for the artist by eavesdropping on her. This robs the gesture of any goodwill and only makes their relationship seem creepy. Also, why a warehouse? It would be far more romantic to view these in a dramatic museum or art gallery. The warehouse does nothing but raise a series of odd questions. Rather than build any romance, these gestures only serve to establish a rhythm of FDR and Tuck trying to one up another. Maybe they should just get a room and end the misery for the rest of us.Pine and Hardy don't really act in ""War"". They are more similar to guys who are watching a football game, rooting for their team and throwing barbs at the people who root for the opposing team. I guess it is supposed to be funny.Reese Witherspoon has more to deal with... err, work with. She feels some mild (very mild) trepidation about dating two guys at once. This 'conundrum' gives her character two-dimensionality. But that really isn't enough.This is also a major stumbling block for the film. After she has what seems to be a pretty terrific first date with Tuck, she leaves the date so she can go to the video store and find something to watch that evening. Alone. Wa - haaaa? I know I have already mentioned this, but it is just a ludicrous plot point. If you are on such a great date, why wouldn't you stick around for a while and get to know each other better? But she must meet FDR, and soon, so she doesn't have time to build any overly romantic notions about Tuck.Worse, since her date with Tuck was so memorable and they seem such a good match, her initial meeting with FDR is completely the opposite. He comes on very strong and she decides to spar with him. The filmmakers are trying for a Cary Grant - Rosalind Russell type of thing. Actually, that's probably too advanced for the filmmakers. Maybe Goldie Hawn - Kurt Russell? Nope. Julia Roberts - Richard Gere? Closer. But there is simply no connection between them and it is all but impossible to understand why she would agree to go on a date with this guy. Mila Kunis - Justin Timberlake? Bingo.Even worse, because FDR and Tuck are CIA agents, the filmmakers have cobbled together meaningless business involving a terrorist (Schweiger) who comes to LA to extract revenge for the death of his brother at the hands of the two CIA agents. Throughout ""War"", there are moments tracking the man's movements, to remind us of his existence, so when he pops up in the big finale, we will remember who he is and accept him. But all of this is handled so poorly, these moments only serve to stand out like a sore thumb. Most episodes of ""Chuck"" balance the romantic subplot and the spy business much better. McG was also one of the producers of the television series, so it seems a little shocking to watch these moments which are handled so poorly. Was he trying to use material he had leftover from the TV show?Worst of all, Angela Bassett plays FDR and Tuck's boss, entitling her to pop up a few times, always cross and glowering at her two subordinates. Is this really the best work Bassett can get? If so, that is an extremely sad indictment of Hollywood.I don't get Chelsea Handler. I've never watched her show and have seen her twice-in two different things; I watched the first episode of ""Chelsea, are you there?"" the same one everyone else watched before tuning out. And now this film. In both, she seems to be around simply to nag people. Not very interesting or pleasant.""This Means War"" is a confused mess. It wants to be a romance. It wants to be a spy caper. It wants to be an action film. But it doesn't do any of these things well enough to compensate for the shortcomings of any of the other elements. In the end, it just ends up resembling a big screen version of a bad episode of ""Chuck"".If you want to pay to watch bad television on the big screen, be my guest.

1466125,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005LAIGXW,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[8, 12]","Perhaps the best part about following movies from birth to completion is that you get to see every single step along the way, both for good and ill.  For instance, This Means War, which had a script that had been floating around Hollywood for years, along the way going through so many changes that it no longer resembled the original concept. Initially titled Spy vs. Spy like the eternally bickering agents from Mad Magazine, Sam Worthington, Seth Rogen, and even Bradley Cooper saw the writing on the wall and hightailed it away from a potential disaster. McG, who remains popular because his name sounds like it should be on a fast food menu and because he made a lot of money with two flicks of hot chicks doing crazy stunts(how'd he make that work!!?), has been in love with the film since the beginning even while nobody else has.Now after what seemed like an eternity of trying to find a release date weak enough for the film to quietly settle in, we get This Means War, featuring the promising trio of Captain Kirk(Chris Pine), Bane(Tom Hardy), and Tracy Flick(Reese Witherspoon) and the results are decidedly unpromising. Hardy and Pine play Tuck and FDR Foster(seriously that's his name), two best friends and CIA agents who are like a less interesting, somewhat homoerotic version of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys. When we meet them they're undercover investigating a case that involve a global terrorist(Til Schweiger), but don't get too invested in it, because the rest of the film sure as heck doesn't.What matters is that Tuck and FDR are buds, joined at the hip. They're like The Beatles of the black ops set, until a Yoko Ono by the name of Lauren(Witherspoon) jams a monkey wrench into the spokes.  Lauren is the stereotypical rom-com hot chick who can't find a date, but for once it's pretty clear why: she's got all the personality of a sack of hammers. Her married and bored best friend, Trish(Chelsea Handler), puts her on a dating website, where she instantly meets Tuck, who as a single father can't make heads or tails of the singles scene. After the success of their first date, she hooks up with the smooth, charming FDR in a video store(they still make those!!?), and soon she's stringing both guys along like puppets.It isn't long before the two old friends discover they're dating the same girl, coming to a gentleman's agreement to see who can  win her heart. Of course it goes disastrously wrong, with both abusing the government's surveillance assets, wasting our taxpayer money, and shredding the Constitution at every turn to make sure the other doesn't ever round third base with Lauren. There's actually some good mileage that can be had from that idea, but the script is genuinely awful, and feels like it's been re-written by a bunch of folks over a number of years. Oh wait, it was. Almost from the beginning the film feels dated, with ancient jokes about the dangers of online dating, and a soundtrack that sounds like it was ripped right out of someone's Walkman(tm).It's a shame to watch two such talented stars wasting away in such throwaway material. Two, because Chris Pine is about as bland of an actor as one can be, with his helmet hair and John Doe face. He's like leading man clip art, and his character's swagger is never believable for a moment. Without the benefit of J.J. Abrams' writing, Pine disappears from view. Hardy shows some of the same ferocity he showed in Inception, but mixed with at ouch of playful goofiness that occasional works. He actually has the film's one big laugh, during a paintball game in which his CIA skills are put to lethal good use against a bunch of weekend warriors. Then, in what is basically a microcosm of the film's mediocrity, that scene is ruined by some lame genital humor that goes nowhere.The one to feel sorry for is Witherspoon, who just can't seem to find her niche anymore. Romantic comedies are usually where she butters her bread, but she's struck out wildly with the last few, only finding mild success in the period romance, Water for Elephants. McG knows how to emphasize her greater attributes, she remains beautiful and perky, but her personality makes her the equivalent of a MacGuffin. What are these two guys fighting over exactly? She's not that much of a catch. Surprisingly, it's the usually irritating Chelsea Handler who comes out unscathed, because basically she's just doing a watered down version of the routine she's been doing for years, that of the drunken skank. It's easy to knock McG for his two Charlie's Angels movies, but they were intentionally frivolous and tongue in cheek. Terminator Salvation was a disaster that killed an entire franchise. He showed some skill with his decent but forgettable football drama, We Are Marshall, but whatever he had then appears to have been flushed down the toilet.Then again, every one is pretty horrible in this movie. Tuck and FDR lie. Lauren lies. Nobody really pays for it because...well, everybody is so darn good looking. Unfortunately, This Means War isn't, so it might be a good idea to raise the white flag of surrender a little early.",2,There's a reason nobody wanted to star in this thing...,1332288000,"03 21,

1466126,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIGXW,Tsuyoshi,"[10, 14]","Two CIA agents FDR Foster and Tuck compete for the love of the same woman Lauren, using their espionage skills and the organization's high-tech weapons. And in their spare time the young agents (who are also best friends) save the world from terrorists. The agents are played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy. Their love interest is played by Reese Witherspoon. This is buddy film meets romantic comedy meets spy action. The idea seems fine enough, at least on paper.However, ""This Means War"" is a disappointment. You don't have any real action scenes. All you get is one generic shoot-out, so-so car chase and Til Schweiger as a villain who looks bored. As for the romantic aspect of the film, Reese Witherspoon is miscast. I like her, but though she does her best to infuse charm into the underwritten character, Witherspoon, known for playing brainy women, is not convincing as a woman who cannot make up her mind to choose. The same goes for the characters played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy, both talented actors. Unfortunately, they are given no chance to show their skills, comedic or otherwise.The film's supports include two Oscar nominees Angela Bassett and Rosemary Harris. Their roles are small and forgettable. Instead, the film spends pretty much time on very annoying Chelsea Handler playing Witherspoon's best friend.""This Means War"" is directed by McG. I liked his ""Charlie's Angels"" for its utter silliness which was fun. Everything about ""This Means War"" is also silly, but not much fun because everything is done in an unenthusiastic and lukewarm manner.",2,"Trying to Be Buddy Movie & Rom Com & Spy Action at the Same Time, And Succeeds as None",1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,1569,"['Two', 'CIA', 'agents', 'FDR', 'Foster', 'Tuck', 'compete', 'love', 'same', 'woman', 'Lauren', 'using', 'espionage', 'skills', 'organization', 'high-tech', 'weapons', 'spare', 'time', 'young', 'agents', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'best', 'friends', 'save', 'world', 'terrorists', 'agents', 'are', 'played', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'buddy', 'film', 'meets', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'meets', 'spy', 'action', 'idea', 'fine', 'enough', 'least', 'paper.However', 'Means', 'War', 'disappointment', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'action', 'scenes', 'get', 'one', 'generic', 'shoot-out', 'so-so', 'car', 'chase', 'Til', 'Schweiger', 'villain', 'who', 'bored', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'film', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'miscast', 'best', 'infuse', 'charm', 'underwritten', 'character', 'Witherspoon', 'known', 'playing', 'brainy', 'women', 'not', 'convincing', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'choose', 'same', 'characters', 'played', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'talented', 'actors', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'given', 'chance', 'show', 'skills', 'comedic', 'otherwise.The', 'film', 'supports', 'include', 'two', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'roles', 'are', 'small', 'forgettable', 'Instead', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'time', 'very', 'annoying', 'Chelsea', 'Handler', 'playing', 'Witherspoon', 'best', 'friend', 'Means', 'War', 'directed', 'McG', 'liked', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'utter', 'silliness', 'was', 'fun', 'Everything', 'Means', 'War', 'also', 'silly', 'not', 'much', 'fun', 'everything', 'done', 'unenthusiastic', 'lukewarm', 'manner']",N/A

Hardy is a very physical actor, Pine relaxed, and Witherspoon is sassy and take no prisoners. The performances weren't bad but, for me, the movie did not work.  It might be that the script wants to be a romantic comedy, buddy movie (gal/guy pairs), and an action/spy flick.  It adds nothing new to any of these genres. It is predictable and prosaic.  Too many coinkydinks and too much boom boon took away from the plot line.  I think we saw this same film in a better form a few years ago in when Edward Norton was contesting for a girl with his friend the priest.  I have not seen a really good romantic comedy coming out of Hollywood in a long time.  The best romance was in a film called ""Goon""...yep the knock your teeth out hockey movie.
