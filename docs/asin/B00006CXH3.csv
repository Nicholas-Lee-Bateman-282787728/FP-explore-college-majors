711800,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00006CXH3,Clare Quilty,"[7, 13]","This movie breaks my heart.It's well shot and well cast, and the actors do a good job.  It's based on the stories and novellas of Larry Brown, who is one of my favorite writers.  I've also always liked Arliss Howard, ever since I saw him in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and he gets behind the camera for this one, and stars; somehow he manages to make himself look a great deal like (what I imagine) a Brown hero would look like.  And the music on the soundtrack is fantastic.But the movie totally misses the mark.  It probably looked good on paper -- a Southern ""Barfly"" with broad, surreal touches -- but on screen it just doesn't work.The key element to Larry Brown's writing has always been simplicity.  He sketches scenes with precise characterizations, short concise images and lines of dialogue that read like a breeze.  ""Big Bad Love"" (the movie) trades all that in for flashy nonsense and makes the whole thing seem phony.  The stories whisper short sentences but the movie shouts through a bullhorn and repeats lines over and over.The film is largely based on the short novel ""92 Days,"" which is about a beer-thirsty, frustrated author who cranks out stories and gets into a whole lot of trouble without really trying to.  But where the book had, say, a moving scene with two brothers, the movie has a scene with twins... identical twins... who also dress exactly alike in nerdy shirts.  Everything in the movie is underlined, everything is QUIRKY.  By the time three characters picnic on a football field while an oblivious marching band stomps past, you'll feel you're watching one of those early 70s flicks made by straight people trying to recapture the spirit of ""Easy Rider"" with liberal amounts of inexplicable wackiness.This movie is to Brown's work what ""Where the Buffalo Roam"" is to the writings of Hunter Thompson -- they got the right ingredients, they just didn't put in the right amounts.  I suspect the filmmakers' hearts are in the right place but they misjudged the source material and amplified all the wrong things.Admission: there's one scene where a man scrapes Alpo out of a can onto a cinderblock for his dog.  The scene is a throwaway, taken from a fairly static section of the book ""Joe,"" but it seemed to me to be the only true moment in the film.  If only the rest were anywhere near as good as that.Read the books.  Skip the movie.",1,"""Almost meaning""",1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,2362,"['movie', 'breaks', 'heart.It', 'well', 'shot', 'well', 'cast', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'based', 'stories', 'novellas', 'Larry', 'Brown', 'who', 'one', 'favorite', 'writers', ""'ve"", 'also', 'always', 'liked', 'Arliss', 'Howard', 'ever', 'saw', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'camera', 'one', 'stars', 'somehow', 'make', 'look', 'great', 'deal', 'what', 'imagine', 'Brown', 'hero', 'would', 'look', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'fantastic.But', 'movie', 'totally', 'mark', 'probably', 'looked', 'good', 'paper', 'Southern', 'Barfly', 'broad', 'surreal', 'touches', 'screen', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.The', 'key', 'element', 'Larry', 'Brown', 'writing', 'always', 'been', 'simplicity', 'scenes', 'precise', 'characterizations', 'short', 'concise', 'images', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'read', 'breeze', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Love', 'movie', 'flashy', 'nonsense', 'whole', 'thing', 'seem', 'phony', 'stories', 'short', 'sentences', 'movie', 'bullhorn', 'repeats', 'lines', 'over.The', 'film', 'largely', 'based', 'short', 'novel', '92', 'Days', 'beer-thirsty', 'frustrated', 'author', 'who', 'out', 'stories', 'whole', 'lot', 'trouble', 'really', 'trying', 'where', 'book', 'had', 'say', 'moving', 'scene', 'two', 'brothers', 'movie', 'scene', 'twins', 'identical', 'twins', 'who', 'also', 'dress', 'exactly', 'alike', 'nerdy', 'shirts', 'Everything', 'movie', 'underlined', 'everything', 'QUIRKY', 'time', 'three', 'characters', 'picnic', 'football', 'field', 'oblivious', 'marching', 'band', 'stomps', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'one', 'early', '70s', 'flicks', 'made', 'straight', 'people', 'trying', 'recapture', 'spirit', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'liberal', 'amounts', 'inexplicable', 'wackiness.This', 'movie', 'Brown', 'work', 'what', 'Where', 'Buffalo', 'Roam', 'writings', 'Hunter', 'Thompson', 'got', 'right', 'ingredients', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'right', 'amounts', 'suspect', 'filmmakers', 'hearts', 'are', 'right', 'place', 'misjudged', 'source', 'material', 'amplified', 'wrong', 'things.Admission', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'man', 'Alpo', 'can', 'cinderblock', 'dog', 'scene', 'throwaway', 'taken', 'fairly', 'static', 'section', 'book', 'Joe', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'true', 'moment', 'film', 'only', 'rest', 'were', 'anywhere', 'as', 'good', 'that.Read', 'books', 'Skip', 'movie']",Big Bad Love
711801,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B00006CXH3,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[3, 12]","I am totally unaware of the writings of Larry Brown. This put me at a severe disadvantage when trying to enjoy &#65533;Big Bad Love.&#65533; The character Leon Barlow (Arliss Howard) came across as a Hunter S. Thompson without the satirical wit of the Gonzo King. Leon is a drunkard who hopes to become a respected fiction author. So far, he receives only rejection slips in the mail on almost a daily basis. He is divorced from Marilyn (Debra Winger) and they have two children. Leon&#65533;s drinking is destroying his life and everyone else's around him. We ceaselessly witness Leon&#65533;s alcohol induced fantasies and nightmares. The man is sick and needs help. Unfortunately, Leon is oblivious and indifferent about seeking a cure. Will even a tragedy do anything to motivate him to straighten out his life? Angie  Dickinson portrays his somewhat affluent codependent mother who adds to the problem by not allowing him to hit bottom. In the back of his mind, Leon knows that she will always pull his bacon out of the fire.I am not one those people who feels compelled to pretend that this sort of film is challenging, provocative, and thoughtful. As matter of fact, one should be wary whenever a professional reviewer employs these terms. It is often their way of damming with faint praise. I was so bored after the first twenty minutes that I had to force myself to endure the rest of the story. It does not stand on its own. You will probably intensely dislike ""Big Bad Love&#65533; unless you take the additional time to acquaint yourself with Larry Brown&#65533;s short stories. Also, I guess I&#65533;m tired of the peculiar hint that only serious alcoholics and drug addicts can become great writers.

711802,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00006CXH3,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[20, 20]","It is a brave, albeit sometimes foolish, thing to invest one's soul in one creative project. Arliss Howard as writer, co-producer, director, and star of this film stepped up to the plate, and blasted this one out of the park. He took a series of short stories by realist Southern writer Larry Brown, raw jangled events, and weaved a remarkable semi-cohesive odyssey from them.Howard, as director, created the kind of film that slaps you in the face. It showers you with smokey narrative, and challenges you to stay up with it. It is very cinematic, laden with lush flashbacks, Fellinisk absurdist characters frolicing about, voice-overs (some of which overlap), surrealism, and piercing symbolism. It recreated the musky flavors of Mississippi, in pace, dialect, and imagery. Some of the dialogue was clever, worth quoting, and much of it was colloquial; rife with down-home twang and swagger. Barlow, the main character, at one point said,"" I want to punch a mudhole in your ass, and stomp it dry."".Howard, as  producer, teamed up with his wife, Debra Winger, and convinced IFC to release it. Howard, as writer, collaborated with Larry Brown's brother Jim, and they transcribed all the swarthy confusion, drama, and epiphany of the short stories, overlaying them with a through-line and a fascinating protagonist engaged on a drunken angry journey from bathos to clarity.Howard, as actor, gave an intense, passionate, and unsympathetic performance; like Ed Harris in POLLOCK. We sensed the character's genius, and we were forced to wade hip deep in his imperfections. Leon Barlow was a man fighting demons, and taking heavy body punches. A wannabe writer, a Vietnam vet, an alcoholic, a deadbeat dad, a brawler, and an eccentric. He smoked too much, drank too much, and was not a responsible parent for his wonderful son and daughter. But he was also a loyal and loving friend, and a talented writer. Howard was so good in this part, Roger Ebert in his review reacted emotionally to the negativity of the character. For much of the picture Barlow was falling down drunk, literally, and Howard portrayed it masterfully. The image of Barlow haunts us; that gaunt enebreated stare, that sparkling intellect swirling below the booze, that muscular back covered in scars, his PTSD, that ever present cigarette dangling from his lips.Paul Le Mat gave one of his best performances as Monroe, the good buddy and best friend. He seemed to be quite wealthy, but after he and Barlow returned from Viet Nam, all he ever wanted to do was hang out with his friend. He became patron and caretaker. He loved the man, and he stood by him regardless of the risk. After Monroe was nearly killed when an Army truck collided with his stalled pick-up, leaving him brain damaged and remote, Barlow was cut loose. And this tragedy came on the searing heels of Barlow losing his angelic daughter to a respiratory ailment. The twin traums seemed to shake the hangover cobwebs from his psyche, forcing him to look into the abyss of his excesses. Then like a bolt of white light he received an acceptance letter for some of his writing, and the denouement was complete.Debra Winger, as Marilyn, the ex-wife, reminded us that we have missed her screen presence for far too long. Her small scene where she finally lets the grief from her daughter's death descent upon her was devastating. Thematically, Barlow, in jail, had the same moment to stare at his child's snapshot and grieve. Their co-mingled cries of loss and anguish rose together as parents, and it became doubly hard to resist one's tears. Rosanna Arquette had fun with Velma, Monroe's girlfriend, then wife. Her mixture of ditz-sexuality and geniune compassion rang true. Angie Dickinson, as the mother, Mrs. Barlow, did a credible job of joining the ensemble. Michael Parks, as the storekeeper, Mr. Aaron, was almost recognizable. Only his habitual mumbling clued us in; although to his credit he did create a memorable character. Several Tom Waits tunes, and other blues selections were used for musical tone. I wondered how Tom Waits, as actor, would have approached Mr. Aaron. One fun bit of casting had author Larry Brown playing the father, Mr. Barlow.The film is a carnival ride, and we are swept up in a maelstrom of delusion, cigarette smoke, stale beer, tragedy, humor, and whiskey. As it winds down finally, as the emotional storm abates, we are left with an odd sense of warmth, as if the arduous journey has paid off, and we are left with a sun-kissed birdsong moment on a cloudless Southern morning.",4,Tough Love,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,4548,"['brave', 'sometimes', 'foolish', 'thing', 'invest', 'one', 'soul', 'one', 'creative', 'project', 'Arliss', 'Howard',

We lived out in the country. He wanted to watch ""Pink Floyd: The Wall."" He said you had to be on drugs to really get it. He didn't have any drugs, but he said if we watched the movie really late at night, being half-awake and half-asleep, that it might give the same experience. Watching ""Big Bad Love"" reminded me of that night, even though I watched it wide awake on a Sunday afternoon. It's what ""The Wall"" might've been if Roger Waters had been a writer who'd grown up in Mississippi.I think I needed to read Larry Brown's book of short stories before I watched this so I could have better appreciated the film's narrative. Halfway through, I gave up trying to connect with any of the multiple storylines and started watching it as an expressionist portrait of a writer's struggle. This is Arliss (Men Don't Leave) Howard's directorial debut -- he also plays the main character, Barlow. Howard has been acting for over twenty years, and this seems like a film packed with all the ideas from a notebook kept during that time of scenes he'd want to direct whenever he got the opportunity. Those scenes are gorgeously shot, and are filled with powerful small moments - the opening sex scene with Marilyn (Debra Winger) in a bathtub wearing a wedding gown, Barlow and best friend Monroe (Paul Le Mat) chasing after the Flasher in their pick-up truck, the scenes with Rosanna Arquette -- but the overall narrative structure is so disjointed that it made it difficult for me to become emotionally engaged with anyone other than Barlow. This is a shame because the supporting players all deliver strong performances that are all lost in Barlow's detached, tormented, inebriated perspective. Then again, maybe that's the point. Howard inhabits Barlow on the screen and behind the camera. There's a tragedy late in the story that provides some focus, but the film never really loses its hallucinatory feel.Also, the soundtrack is worth checking out if you're into eclectic blues. In the film, there's a scene in a bar featuring the late R.L.
