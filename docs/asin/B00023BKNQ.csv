Together they create, in an early 1980s world, a believable confrontational home relationship.

So if you enjoy dialogue driven comedy, now period romantic comedy, unintentionally, this is great.Why a ""NEW"" complete collection release. Likely because so many desire it, the older copies sell for more than this new set on Amazon. Advantage to the new in that all discs fit into one shelf-saving case.SDH SUBTITLES for all 26 episodes-total about 11 hours. A keeper, not a rental.Dench is special, & shows her giftedness in this 80s series even though it's many roles and years since her 1959 debut. ""Love in a Cold Climate"" preceded, with ""As Time Goes By"", ""Angelina Ballerina"", ""Cranford"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", and ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" only a pittance of her filmography.Husband Michael Williams was also frequently acting in roles from ""Educating Rita"" and ""Henry V"" and more till he died in 2001.Susan Penhaligon plays the sister in almost all of the episodes, and can be seen reading a book ""Bouquet of Barbed Wire"", which she held the leading role when adapted for TV. That's an example of the wry wit displayed throughout the series.Her husband played by Richard Warwick, keep the romantic banter and bicker in fine tune.Like a British Ozzie and Harriet, but two decades later, and with no kids.

She plays Laura Dalton, a cerebral linguist, single, and almost 40. Her married sister is played by charming Susan Penhaligon and Richard Warwick plays her brother-in-law. At her party, her sister and brother-in-law have invited somebody to match with Laura. Michael Williams' character is blue collar working class guy with a shop, drives a van, and is adorable. I can see why Michael and Judi had such a wonderful marriage in real life. In this series which was unusual for a celebrated actress like Judi Dench in the first place, she comes across as a natural and has fun with it. Dench and Williams enjoyed working together whether on screen or on stage and had one of the best marriages in this difficult business.I will say that the series is a bit dry British humor and avoids the slapstick humor or physical comedy like some others but I enjoy that. This series is a mature, blend of comedy and relationships without going overboard. Judi's Laura can be condascending and sensitive to the fact that she's still single while her younger sister isn't anymore. Every married couple wants to fix up those who are single, don't they? Well, they find a nice, fine match with Williams and Dench whose characters probably wouldn't get together unless they tricked into it. Once Laura discovers Williams' character, the couple moves smoothly along.

822446,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B00023BKNQ,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[111, 112]","Those who are familiar with As Time Goes By will already be familiar with the writing of Bob Larbey, who also wrote A Fine Romance, and those who've enjoyed As Time Goes By will almost certainly enjoy 1980's A Fine Romance. Though not so well known, this light romantic comedy about two mismatched 40-something lonely hearts bears all the hallmarks of Larbey's classic and engaging style of writing.Briefly, Dame Judi Dench (As Time Goes By's Jean Pargetter) stars as Laura Dalton, a highly competent albeit somewhat shy, nervous and highly-strung translator with a tall, pretty, charming and very happily married younger sister named Helen, who only wants to see Laura as happy as she is. Helen and her husband Phil decide to team Laura up with Phil's friend Mike Selway, but it's a match made more out of desperation than a belief that the pair would be suitable companions. Mike (the late Michael Williams, Dame Judi's real-life husband of 30 years who died of cancer in 2001), is a shy, laid-back but very nervous, unkempt, disorganised, and socially-inept landscape gardener. He also has very little in common with Laura with respect to their likes and dislikes. The humour in the series is gentle, and it gets its ""spark"" from the tension engendered by the pairing of this seemingly unlikely couple.The set contains the all twenty-six 25-minute episodes of this sweet, charming, relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable series, which I highly recommend to fans of As Time Goes By.  Personally, although I did have a slight preference for As Time Goes By when I first saw A Fine Romance, I have found that following a second viewing of the latter series, I now enjoy it every bit as much as As Time Goes By. Both are absolutely delightful series that are a joy to curl up watch time and time again.",5,"A Very Enjoyable Light, Romantic British Comedy!",1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,1796,"['who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Time', 'Goes', 'will', 'already', 'be', 'familiar', 'writing', 'Bob', 'Larbey', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'A', 'Fine', 'Romance', 'who', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Time', 'Goes', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'enjoy', '1980', 'Fine', 'Romance', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'mismatched', '40-something', 'lonely', 'hearts', 'hallmarks', 'Larbey', 'classic', 'engaging', 'style', 'writing.Briefly', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Time', 'Goes', 'Jean', 'Pargetter', 'Laura', 'Dalton', 'highly', 'competent', 'somewhat', 'shy', 'nervous', 'highly-strung', 'translator', 'tall', 'pretty', 'charming', 'very', 'happily', 'married', 'younger', 'sister', 'named', 'Helen', 'who', 'only', 'see', 'Laura', 'as', 'happy', 'Helen', 'husband', 'Phil', 'decide', 'team', 'Laura', 'up', 'Phil', 'friend', 'Mike', 'Selway', 'match', 'made', 'more', 'desperation', 'belief', 'pair', 'would', 'be', 'suitable', 'companions', 'Mike', 'late', 'Michael', 'Williams', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'real-life', 'husband', '30', 'years', 'who', 'died', 'cancer', '2001', 'shy', 'laid-back', 'very', 'nervous', 'unkempt', 'disorganised', 'socially-inept', 'landscape', 'gardener', 'also', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'Laura', 'respect', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'humour', 'series', 'gentle', 'spark', 'tension', 'engendered', 'pairing', 'seemingly', 'unlikely', 'couple.The', 'set', 'twenty-six', '25-minute', 'episodes', 'sweet', 'charming', 'relaxing', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Time', 'Goes', 'Personally', 'did', 'have', 'slight', 'preference', 'Time', 'Goes', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'A', 'Fine', 'Romance', 'have', 'found', 'following', 'second', 'viewing', 'latter', 'series', 'now', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'Time', 'Goes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'series', 'are', 'joy', 'curl', 'up', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'again']",A Fine Romance - The Complete Collection
822447,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B00023BKNQ,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[2, 2]","I too am a BIG gan of As Time Goes By (and Judi Dench), and bought this series for that reason, and after having read the reviews here.  I logged on to echo others' sentiments- gentle, hilarious at times (the scene with the lost contact lens in the fancy restaurant is priceless), touching, and oddly romantic, but mostly wanted to say how very different Dame Dench is here- playing an immature misfit, a square peg in a round hole.  Her wonderful husband Michael Williams's is even more impressive, to my mind, nervous and nuanced, rumpled and unique, so touching and yet a delight, and this performance decades before shows like The Closer, exploring imperfect and complex people.The dialogue is sublime, nothing on American tv even comes close, wry and funny yet utterly natural.  I don't know that I'd call it a ""light"" romantic comedy, underpinned as it is by issues like loneliness, not being able to live without someone that drives you up the wall, etc.  Another reviewer opined that there was no chemistry between them- purely in the eye of the beholder I guess but I thought there was chemistry aplenty.Also wanted to add that if you like this I'll bet you'll also like the Peter Sellers movie Hoffman, also about a seemingly mismatched couple.
